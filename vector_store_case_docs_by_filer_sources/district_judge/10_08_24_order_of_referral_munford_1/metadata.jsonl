I want\n\nto help and work with the citizens of Tarrant County and the families of Tarrant County to\n\nprovide a good and accurate judiciary that follows the rules of law.\u201d\nHowever, in this case, Respondent, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, has encountered a\nseries of judicial determinations that fundamentally contradict this objective. The\nassurance to uphold a judiciary that follows the rule of law has been replaced with\ndecisions that have deprived the Respondent of due process, equitable hearings, and his\nfundamental paternal rights. Respondent respectfully moves to recuse District Judge\n\nJames Munford and Associate Judge Jeffrey Kaitcer pursuant to TAC \u00a7155.152 & TEX.\n\nR. CIV.

This motion has been filed at the earliest practicable opportunity, as the\nRespondent has exhausted all other available legal avenues without receiving any response,\nexplanation, or opposition. Respondent has given the trial court every opportunity to\ncorrect the errors made in this case and has recently discovered pertinent information\nrelated to the initial proceeding that took place on January 16th, 2024, as outlined below.\nThere are no current settings or upcoming hearings, and the case has not yet been scheduled\nfor a final trial. The Respondent\u2019s motion is verified and asserts grounds for recusal\npursuant to TEX. CIV. R. P. 18(b)b1. These grounds are not predicated solely on the judges\u2019\nprior rulings.

On December 14\", 2024, the petitioner requested a\nprotective order from James Munford, which was denied. Exhibit A. However, one month\nand two days later, Judge James Munford made an initial decision that has been\nunexplained for the last ten months.\n\nB. The initial decision at issue arose during a show cause hearing concerning an\norder of protection initiated by the petitioner, Morgan Michelle Myers, on December 22,\n2023. This hearing was originally scheduled to be presided over by Associate Judge\nJeffrey Kaitcer in the 322\" District Court of Tarrant County at 9:00 A.M. on January 16\",\n\n2024. However, due to delays caused by inclement weather as mentioned above, the\n\nproceedings were instead conducted by District Judge James Munford, as Associate\n\nJudge Jeffrey Kaitcer arrived late.\n\nC. Both parties were present and appeared without legal representation. During the\nproceedings, Judge Munford presented the parties with an agreed continuance, which\nboth parties accepted, and which was subsequently granted by Judge Munford as\nreflected in his order.

Exhibit C.\n\nD. This decision by Judge Munford undeniably raises serious questions regarding\nhis impartiality in this matter. Due process of law requires that an individual receive\nnotice and hearing before being deprived of a property right. In re the Guardianship of\nBays, 355 $.W.3d 715, 720 (Tex. App. 2011); See Grannis v. Ordean, 234 U.S. 385, 394,\n348. Ct. 779, 783, 58 L. Ed. 1363 (1914) (\"a fundamental requisite of due process of law\nis the opportunity to be heard\"). Furthermore, the Texas Family Code prohibits such an\norder before notice and hearing. TEX. FAM. CODE 105.001 (\u201c...an order may not be\nrendered under Subsection (a)(1)... except after notice and a hearing...\u201d) (referencing\n\nchild custody).\n\nE. Moreover, 6.405(b) of the Texas Family Code was not satisfied, which is a\nmandatory requirement before any hearing can take place given the original petition for\ndivorce claimed an active order of protection was currently in effect against the\nRespondent. Exhibit B, p. 7. (\u2018The petitioner shall attach to the petition a copy of each\norder described by Subsection (a)(1) in which a party to the suit or the child of a party to\nthe suit was the applicant or victim of the conduct alleged in the application... if a copy\nof the order is not available at the time of filing, the petition must state that a copy of the\norder will be filed with the court before any hearing.)

All of the procedural safeguards\n\nabove were disregarded by James Munford.\n\nF, The purpose of temporary orders with injunctive relief is not to destroy the\nstatus quo, but rather to preserve it. See Iranian Muslim Organization v. City of San\nAntonio, 615 S.W.2d 202, 208 (Tex. 1981); Davis v. Huey, 571 S.W.2d 859, 862 (Tex.\n1978); Citizens of Texas Sav. v. Fox Jacobs, 718 S.W.2d 2, 3 (Tex. App. 1985). Similarly\nto how the temporary injunction in Coyote Lake Ranch, LLC v. City of Lubbock, 498\nS.W.3d 53 (Tex. 2016) improperly denied the City its undisputed right to access\ngroundwater\u2014an essential resource\u2014Judge Munford's rulings have deprived the\nRespondent of his residency, which has served not only as the family home since 2015\nbut also as the headquarters for his business which provided for the children \u2014 an\nessential resource to their wellbeing. Furthermore, the Respondent was divested of\ncustodial rights to his children without justification. Like the injunction in Coyote, rather\n\nthan preserving the status quo, these initial rulings have done the opposite by depriving\n\nthe Respondent of his constitutional rights to property prior to due process of law. US\nCONST. AMEND XIV, \u00a7 1; TEX CONST. ART. I, \u00a7 19. Furthermore, James Munford\nprejudged critical matters that require full evidentiary hearings. TEX. FAM.

The Respondent\u2019s burden of showing of bias or impartiality to such an extent\nthat the movant was deprived of a fair trial is satisfied from Judge Munford\u2019s initial\nruling.

The threshold for recusal is \"whether a reasonable member of the public at\nlarge, knowing all the facts in the public domain concerning the judge's conduct, would\nhave a reasonable doubt that the judge is actually impartial.\" Hansen v. JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A., 346 S.W.3d 769, 776 (Tex. App.\u2014Dallas 2011, no pet.); Rodriguez v.\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., No. 04-14-00342-CV, 22 (Tex. App. Jun. 17, 2015). The\nRespondent asserts that a reasonable member of the public would indeed reasonably\ndoubt James Munford was actually impartial given that he deprived the Respondent of a\nfair trial. Thus, the Respondent\u2019s burden and threshold for recusal has been met, and\n\nJudge James Munford should be recused from this matter.\n\nI. The only reasoning provided was an oral statement regarding his personal\n\nopinion regarding the Respondent living next door to his ex-partner\u2019s grandparents,\n\nwhich is extrajudicial and comes from a biased perspective which discounted the facts of\nthe case relevant to the children\u2019s well-being. In the context of this case, recusal is\nwarranted if the trial judge's impartiality might reasonably be questioned, or he has a\npersonal bias. TEX. R. CIV. P. 18b(2). This opinion or bias was irrelevant to the well\nbeing of the children, as the grandmother, much like the children, relied on the\nRespondent\u2019s income in order to provide financial stability, and further justifies his\n\nrecusal.\nITI. QUESTIONING THE IMPARTIALITY OF JEFFREY KAITCER\n\nA. The initial ruling reset the case to January 224, 2024.

Exhibit\nD. Neither party appeared before the Jeffrey Kaitcer, and this decision was made without\n\nany input from the Respondent and without any opportunity to contest it.\n\nB. At the third trial setting on February 1, 2024, the parties arrived only to be\npresented with a settlement agreement from the Respondent\u2019s own counsel. Given that\nthe case had been delayed twice already and the ongoing damage from being unable to\nwork at full capacity was compounding by the day, the Respondent contested this\n\n7\n\nstrategy. He was informed by his attorney that the orders could be modified later and was\nurged to sign it. Left with no better alternative, the Respondent signed the agreement\nunder duress after already being deprived of his residency, children, and business since\n\nJanuary 16\", 2024. Exhibit E\n\nC. The agreement removed the children from their own home that they had resided\nin their entire life and allowed the Respondent back into the home until March 1, 2024. It\nalso established child support, and allocated financial responsibilities to the parties, to\nwhere the Respondent was left with both car payments, an unreasonable amount of time\n\nto transition from the home and with the addition of child support obligations. Exhibit E\n\nD. Due to the Respondent\u2019s counsel drafting a settlement agreement rather than\nrepresenting the interests of his client, he was terminated shortly after the third setting on\nFebruary 5, 2024, where the Respondent began to represent himself pro se.

Exhibit G\n\nE. Given that Dan Bacalis had been terminated, and that the associate judge\u2019s\nreport signed on February 1, 2024, had clear stipulations regarding its\u2019 reduction to\nwriting Exhibit G, p.5, the Respondent filed notice with the court on March 4\", 2024,\nstating that he would not be leaving the marital residence as it was not in the best\n\ninterests of his children.

This decision prompted the petitioner to run inside the family residence on\nMarch 6\", 2024, while the Respondent was walking his daughters to school on her\nvisitation time and lock the petitioner out of the home.

A neutral and\nimpartial evaluator would have acknowledged the interconnected nature of the\nRespondent's business, residency, and familial relationships as well as the impact of the\ninitial proceedings leading up to that point. Further, an impartial judge would have\nrealized that there is no logical explanation to remove a parent who relies on the\nresidency to provide for the children while simultaneously denying the evidence that\n\nwould have corroborated this need.\n\nJ. The Respondent's motion for reconsideration concluded with an illegible order,\nrequiring him to sign the temporary orders served just moments earlier by 1:30 p.m. that\nsame day. Exhibit K. Again, the order was designated as \"agreed\" despite lacking the\nRespondent's signature, was reduced outside of its\u2019 own procedural requirements ordered\nby the same judge, was reduced without any underlying motion for temporary orders ever\nserved to the Respondent and differed from the associate judge\u2019s report signed on\nFebruary 1, 2024. Rather than holding the opposing counsel and the petitioner in\ncontempt for violating Rule 13 of the Texas Rules of C"}

Rather than holding the opposing counsel and the petitioner in\ncontempt for violating Rule 13 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure for signing a\nfictitious pleading which contained false statements, Jeffrey Kaitcer deprived the\n\nRespondent of a fair trial, thus warranting his recusal from this matter.\n\nK. It is evident, based on common sense and objective evaluation of the public\nfacts regarding Jeffrey Kaitcer\u2019s conduct that no reasonable person would believe that he\n\nwas actually impartial knowing all of the facts of the case. After eight months of seeking\n\n10\n\nrelief throughout the Texas judiciary, the collective actions of Judge James Munford and\nAssociate Judge Jeffrey Kaitcer remain unexplained, and the damage is ongoing. Their\njoint recusal is necessary to ensure a fair resolution of this matter and to ensure the\n\npersistent favoritism directed towards the petitioner is abolished.\nIV. THE AFTERMATH\n\nA. Since the March 14\" hearing, the case has stalled. There has been no\nparticipation from the opposing party, and all attempted communications have failed.\nThere hasn\u2019t been any explanation for the denials in the Second Court of Appeals, leaving\nthe Respondent to continue seeking every remedy available to him to correct the\n\ndecisions presented above or receive a valid legal basis that justifies them.\n\nB. The joint managing conservatorship that the current orders outline has put the\nRespondent in massive amounts of debt. He had to stay in hotels on Thursday nights in\norder to take his Children to school on Friday mornings for his visitation period, and for\nthe extended summer visitation, rented an AIR BNB in order to provide the Children with\na stable living space. The Respondent was able to have the owner of the AIRBNB located\nat 6608 Dewsbury St. that was only 1.3 miles from the Respondent\u2019s home allow him to\nport forward the router, allowing him to work to some degree, where he"}

Given the requirements to operate his business, an alternative\nresidency would take a fair amount of time to transition to, and likewise the petitioner\n\nwould need equal amount of time to obtain full employment in order to maintain the\n\n11\n\ncurrent household. All of this was explained in the Respondent\u2019s pleadings that were\n\nbefore the court on January 16\", 2024, but were not considered. Exhibit L, Exhibit M\n\nC. Since the March 14\" hearing, the petitioner has moved additional family\nmembers into the home, has not paid rent, and has reduced her employment while\nsignificantly reducing the Respondents. On top of both James Munford and Jeffrey\nKaitcer\u2019s disregard for the law and the best interests of the children, the inadvertent\nfavoritism towards the petitioner has allowed her to further her own interests at the\nexpense of the status quo of the children. An impartial judge is required in this matter to\n\nensure that this one-sided favoritism does not continue at the expense of the children.\n\nD. On June 2 of 2024, the petitioner\u2019s grandmother contacted the Respondent\nreiterating the above. She stated that the children were not being taken care of, that the\npetitioner was not acting like herself, and that she was not paying rent. This information\nwas relayed to the Supreme Court of Texas, where the Respondent\u2019s motion for rehearing\non petition for writ of mandamus is still pending before the court, asking them to compel\nJames Munford to vacate the current orders which were entered by Associate Judge\nJeffrey Kaitcer as agreed without consent and referenced a hearing that has never taken\n\nplace.\nV.

QUESTIONS THAT REMAIN UNANSWERED\nThroughout this case, several concerning questions have arisen regarding the conduct\n\nof both judges:\n\n12\n\n. What dire circumstance compelled Judge James Munford to take up a case on\nshort notice and grant injunctions and make child custody decisions without\nknowing the facts or considering the pleadings, particularly on a day the court was\nclosed due to inclement weather when he had denied a similar request a month\n\nearlier?\n\n. Why did Judge Munford grant an agreed continuance at a protective order hearing\nand simultaneously rule against one of the parties on divorce issues without taking\n\ninto consideration the preponderance of the evidence before him?\n\n. What factual basis on the record compelled Jeffrey Kaitcer to openly make\n\nnegative statements about the Respondent regarding his children?\n\n. Why has Cooper Carter failed to respond to any of the Respondent\u2019s pleadings and\n\nneglected to file any documents on behalf of her client?\n\n. What factual basis exists on the record to supports the petitioner being granted full\n\ncustody of the children and sole use of the residence?\n\n. How can an order be issued as an \"agreed order\" after consent was explicitly\nwithdrawn, referencing a hearing that never occurred, and served to the\n\nRespondent before a scheduled hearing meant to challenge the very order?\n\n13\n\nVI. CONCLUSION\n\nThis case, as detailed in the pending motion for rehearing before the Supreme\nCourt of Texas, revolves around the core issue of accountability. What began with\nMorgan Michelle Myers attempting to avoid responsibility has now evolved into a\ntroubling scenario where both judges have repeatedly failed to recognize and correct their\nserious missteps. Attorney Cooper Carter\u2019s authority to represent the petitioner, currently\nbeing challenged through a Rule 12 motion, further deepens concerns about the integrity\n\nand fairness of these proceedings.\n\nRecusing both judges is n"}

The petitioner\u2019s actions\nhave caused unnecessary delays, destabilized her family, and inflicted significant\nemotional and financial harm on all involved. The ongoing litigation, exacerbated by a\n\nlack of judicial transparency and accountability, has only added to the hardship.\n\nDespite these issues, the Respondent holds no ill will toward any party involved.\nHis primary concern has always been, and continues to be, doing what is right for his\nchildren. The Respondent believes that with impartial judges and a renewed focus on\nfairness, this case can still be resolved justly, allowing all parties to move forward with\ndignity and integrity. The Respondent remains diligent in his commitment to securing a\n\nfair outcome that reflects the best interests of his children as the Family Code mandates.\n\n14\n\nVII.

That the clerk of the court deliver a copy of the motion for recusal to both the\nrespondent judges and the regional presiding judge, and deliver any signed orders\n\nof recusal or referral to the regional presiding judge immediately upon filing.\n\n2. That the respondent judges either recuse themselves or refer the motion to the\nregional presiding judge within three business days after the motion is filed, and\nrefrain from taking any further action in the case until the motion is decided,\n\nunless good cause is shown in writing or on the record.\n\n3.
