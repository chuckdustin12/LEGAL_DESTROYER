Accordingly, absent any swift corrective action, Honorable James Munford must \nrecuse himself from this matter, which is supported by the forthcoming facts found in the record: \n2\n\nII. RECUSAL STANDARDS AND PROCEDURE \n8. Texas appellate courts have consistently held that recusal is mandatory-not \ndiscretionary-when a judge's impartiality might reasonably be questioned (Ex parte Thuesen, \n546 S.W.3d 145 (Tex. Crim. App. 2017)). The test is whether a reasonable member of the public, \nknowing all the facts, would have a reasonable doubt about the judge's impartiality (Rodriguez v. \nNewton, NUMBER 13-19-00309-CV (Tex. App. Jul 16, 2020); In re Moore, NUMBER 13-19-\n00551-CV (Tex. App. Oct 30, 2019); Johnson-Todd v. Morgan, NO. 09-17-00168-CV, NO. 09-\n17-00194-CV (Tex. App. Dec 20, 2018); Kniatt v. State, 239 S.W.3d 910 (Tex. App. 2007); Sears \nI \nv. Nueces County SherriffOlivarez, 28 S.W.3d 611 (Tex. App. 2000)). This standard is applied \nregardless of whether actual bias exists; the appearance of bias is sufficient. \n9. When a recusal motion is filed, the judge must either recuse themselves or refer the \nmotion to another judge for decision; the challenged judge cannot unilaterally determine the \nsufficiency of the allegations (De Leon v. Aguilar, 127 S.W.3d 1 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004)). \n10. A federal lawsuit against a judge, particularly one alleging conspiracy with a party in \na RICO action, creates an immediate and substantial conflict of interest that requires the judge's \nprompt recusal from presiding over this matter, because the judge's impartiality would \nreasonably be questioned under both constitutional and statutory standards. The integrity of the \njudicial process and the appearance of fairness demand recusal in such circumstances to preserve \npublic confidence and due process, which has already been tainted b"}

The integrity of the \njudicial process and the appearance of fairness demand recusal in such circumstances to preserve \npublic confidence and due process, which has already been tainted by these proceedings. \n11. The Texas Constitution provides a foundational rule: no judge may preside over a \ncase in which they have an interest, or where there is a connection to the parties by affinity, \nconsanguinity, or prior involvement as counsel (Tex. Const. art. 5 \u00a7 11 ). This constitutional \nmandate is echoed and elaborated in the Texas Government Code, which requires a judge to \n3\n\nrecuse themselves and request assignment of another judge if they are disqualified or should \notherwise recuse (Tex. Gov't. Code \u00a7 24.002). The Texas Government Code also provides \nmechanisms for parties to object to a judge's assignment in civil cases, including divorce, and \nmandates recusal upon timely objection (Tex. Gov't. Code\u00a7 74.053). \n12. Administrative regulations reinforce these requirements, specifying that a judge is \nsubject to recusal or disqualification on the same grounds as set out in Texas Rule of Civil \nProcedure 18b, and that motions to recuse must be made promptly and supported by admissible \nfacts (1 Tex. Admin. Code\u00a7 155.152). \n13. The law is clear that the appearance of impropriety is as damaging as actual \nimpropriety. The Code of Judicial Conduct and the Texas Supreme Court have emphasized that \njudges must avoid situations where their impartiality might reasonably be questioned, as public \nconfidence in the judiciary depends on the perception of fairness and neutrality (State v. \nVolkswagen Aktiengesellschaft, 692 S. W.3d 467 (Tex. 2022); In re Moore, NUMBER 13-19-\n00551-CV (Tex. App. Oct 30, 2019)). \n15.

This elevates the conflict of interest to \nan extraordinary level, making it virtually impossible for the judge to preside without \nundermining the legitimacy of the proceedings. The public, and the parties, would have every \nreason to doubt the judge's impartiality, and the law requires recusal in such circumstances \n(Rodriguez v. Cantu (In re Rodriguez), NUMBER 13-19-00230-CV, NUMBER 13-19-00254-CV \n(Tex. App. Jun 25, 2019); Johnson-Toddv. Morgan, NO. 09-17-00168-CV, NO. 09-17-00194-CV \n(Tex. App. Dec 20, 2018)). \n16. Absent corrective action, immediate recusal is warranted, supported by the following: \n4\n\nIII. GROUNDS FOR RECUSAL \nA. WIRE FRAUD \n8. On October 7, 2024, Respondent filed a joint motion to recuse District Judge James \nMunford and Associate Judge Jeffrey Kaitcer through the electronic filing manager, serving all \nparties with one hyperlinked document containing all exhibits and notarized affidavits (DKT NO. \n227). This recusal was filed in good faith after all appellate efforts were denied without \nexplanation. See Cause No. 24-0395. \n9. On October 8, 2024, at 4:43 PM, correspondence was received from Court Coordinator \nLindsey Baker regarding an order of referral and ruling letter transmitted by District Judge James \nMunford to Regional Presiding Judge David L. Evans, declining to recuse himself from this \nmatter (DKT NOS. 228-229). This email contained an unoriginal, modified version of the joint \nmotion to recuse submitted to re:Search Texas by the Respondent, and was missing the exhibits \nand the affidavit. \n10. By CC'ing this email to coopercarter@majadmin.com on October 8, 2024, District \nJudge James Munford, through his court coordinator, relied on interstate wire communications \nbecause majadmin.com can be traced to the IP address 74.208.236.18, which IP Geolocation \nplaces in Kansas City, at coordinates 39.0997,-94.5786. Combined with the intentional alt"}

Combined with the intentional alteration \nof the pleading to withhold material exhibits/affidavit to influence the recusal outcome, the \ntransmission constitutes wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343, thereby supplying a RICO predicate \nact under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(1), committed by both Lindsey Baker and District Judge James \nMunford. At minimum, these facts plausibly allege the interstate-wire and fraud elements of this \nclaim are supported by admissible evidence, that if true, would warrant his immediate recusal, \nand no further involvement from the Court Coordinator absent any swift corrective action. \n5\n\nB. WIRE FRAUD -COUNT TWO \n11. On October 10, 2024, court coordinator Lindsey Baker transmitted an \"Amended \nOrder of Referral\" at 11: 17 AM and a second judge's ruling letter. (DKT 232, 233) This \ntransmission relied on the same interstate wires mentioned above. \n12. The original motion was once again modified, this time split into three separate files \n\"due to the size of the motion\" which was well under the 35mb limit allotted from the efile Texas \nplatform, with hyperlinks removed, affecting its' readability. \n13. When Respondent pointed these issues out, Baker confirmed the pleading had been e\u00ad\nfiled and the full document was in the court's possession (DKT NOS. 230-231 see Exhibits) \nshowing that there was no plausible reason to modify them. \nC. FAILURE TO FOLLOW MANDATORY RECUSAL PROCEDURES \n14. The primary legislative and regulatory authorities governing the handling of recusal \nmotions in Texas are Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a and various provisions of the Texas \nGovernment Code, including sections 25.00256, 29.055, and 74.059(c)(3). \n15. Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a sets out the exclusive procedure for recusal or \ndisqualification of judges in civil cases. Upon the filing of a recusal m"}

Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a sets out the exclusive procedure for recusal or \ndisqualification of judges in civil cases. Upon the filing of a recusal motion, the rule requires the \nrespondent judge, within three business days, to either recuse themselves or refer the motion to \nthe regional presiding judge. The rule further mandates that the judge must take no further action \nin the case until the motion is resolved, except for good cause stated in writing or on the record. \n16. Texas Government Code\u00a7 25.00256 (and related provisions such as\u00a7 29.055 and\u00a7 \n74.059(c)(3)) reinforce these requirements, specifying that the judge must forward the motion \nand all related documents in their original form or as certified copies to the presiding judge, and \nmay not take further action in the case until the recusal motion is resolved. \n6\n\n17. Here, modified versions were transmitted, notably missing critical elements such as \nthe notarized affidavit and exhibits showing a long list of misconduct that remains unaddressed \nto this day. Notwithstanding the federal allegations above, there is a continuous pattern showing \nthat the law is being willfully disregarded by these individuals, and enabled by the Regional \nPresiding Judge, who has permitted rulings on non-existent motions, and the continued \ninvolvement of Baker despite clear ambiguities surrounding the prior two recusal proceedings. \n18. Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a and Texas Government Code\u00a7 29.055 both require \nthe forwarding of the motion and all related documents in their original or certified form. The use \nof the term \"all\" and the requirement for original or certified copies preclude any alteration, \nomission, or selective transmission. This is further reinforced by case law, which consistently \nholds that the judge's only permissible actions \u00b7are recusal or referral, and that any other action\u00ad\nincluding any manipulation of the motion or its exhibits-is outside"}

App. May 07, 2025); In re Norman, 191 S.W.3d \n858 (Tex. App. 2006); Carson v. Gomez, 841 S.W.2d 491 (Tex. App. 1992)). \nIV.ETHICS \n19. The ethical consequences of the allegations are significant. The Texas Code of \nJudicial Conduct requires judges to comply with the law and maintain professional competence. \nIn In re Inquiry Concerning Honorable Bonnie Rangel (677 S.W.3d 918, Tex. 2023), the Texas \nSupreme Court publicly admonished a judge for filing a response to a recusal moti_on, which is \nexpressly prohibited by Rule 18a. The Court found that this single act demonstrated a lack of \ncompetence in the law and a failure to comply with legal requirements, violating Canons 2A and \n3B(2). \n7\n\n20. By analogy, in this case, a staff member who serves at the pleasure of the Judge \nfacing recusal was permitted to transmit non-original copies a government document through the \nuse of interstate wires when the law clearly prohibits such behavior. \n21. Furthermore, these actions are not isolated but build upon a growing pattern of \nmisconduct in furtherance of a broader scheme initiated by Petitioner Morgan Michelle Myers. \nV. PURSUIT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS \n22. The actions alleged herein are part of a larger, broader scheme to defraud the \nRespondent of his business and property, and this Recusal serves as both a notice to any \nindividual reading this brief that the law is not optional. Whether a judge, an attorney, a clerk, or \na coordinator -the law is not below you. \n23. In this case, several individuals have chosen to disregard the law, put their political \ninterests and bias before the Children and laws of this State, and have inadvertently assisted the \nPetitioner, Morgan Michelle Myers, in an elaborate sche"}

CONCLUSION \n24. For these reasons, Judge James Munford should be immediately recused, or in the \nalternative, correct the mistakes that have remained unaddressed for two years and remain \nunopposed on the face of the record. \n25. The record is clear: this is a one sided case, with a one sided outcome, and despite \nhaving every reason to correct the errors in the face of no opposition, this Court has chosen to \ndisregard the law, ethical standards, and has committed several predicate acts in the process \nwhich will be outlined in more detail if the subsequent federal action must be brought. \n8\n\n26. Nevertheless, the facts plead herein support recusal, as any member of the public \nknowing all of the facts of this case would clearly doubt it was conducted in an impartial manner. \nVI.PRAYER \nWHEREF9RE, all premises considered, Respondent prays that the court: \n1. Grant this motion to recuse, or in the alternative, provide corrective action to \nremedy the injustice faced by the Respondent; \n2.
