The only prior orders affecting the parties were \nissued in the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County, but those orders are void and of no legal effect. Under Texas Family Code \u00a7 201.013(b), an associate judge's order does not become final unless and until the referring district court judge signs the order. \nMoreover, the orders claim that all parties agree to the terms of the order despite \nthe Petitioner's signature being absent. In the prior proceedings (Cause Nos. 322-744263-23 in the 322nd District Court), an associate judge signed a \"temporary\" order on March 14, 2024 that purported to be an agreement between the parties. Critically, no district judge of the 322nd District Court ever signed or adopted that order, as required by law. TEX. FAM. CODE Sec. 201.013. Given this fact, the orders have no legal eff ect and M.2303 M.2303\nM.2303 M.2303 M.2303 M.2303\n\nshould be declared void by this court, or in the alternative, voidable, and vacated without \ndelay. There is effectively no valid court order currently governing the parties' residence or conservatorship rights. This Court may therefore proceed to protect the children's welfare and the parties' rights as justice requires, unimpeded by the defective 322nd District Court order.  \nFurthermore, this court has jurisdiction because the Respondent cannot argue that \nthe related cause number retains dominated jurisdiction. Texas law does allow a court to lose dominant jurisdiction if the party with the first suit proceeded in bad faith or the suit is not actively pursued. Both apply here, as demonstrated below. The first suit was unquestionably brought in bad faith, and the case hasn't been actively pursued for over six months by the opposition, leaving the children in procedural limbo and their needs unaddressed. \nII.

THE RESPONDENT'S MISCONDUCT\nPerjury and Aggravated Perjury (Tex. Penal Code \u00a7\u00a7 37.02\u2013.03) \n68. Texas law makes it a crime to make false statements under oath. Perjury\noccurs when a person, with intent to deceive, makes a false statement under oath in a proceeding where an oath is required. \n69. If the false statement is made in connection with an \"official proceeding\" and\nis material, it becomes Aggravated Perjury, a third -degree felony. In civil cases, \nknowingly submitting false affidavits or testimony can also constitute perjury and be treated as a fraud upon the court. Courts have recognized that false sworn statements in family law matters are serious misconduct, undermining the judicial process and potentially warranting sanctions or even criminal referral (e.g., Skepnek v. Mynatt, 8 S.W.3d 377, 381 (Tex. App. \u2013 El Paso 1999) (attorney sanctioned $30,000 for filing false affidavit).  \n70. Here, Respondent swore to multiple false statements under oath, meeting all\nelements of perjury and aggravated perjury. For example: \nFalse Affidavit of Indigency M.2314 M.2314\nM.2314 M.2314 M.2314 M.2314\n\n71. On December 18, 2023, Respondent filed a sworn \"Affidavit of Inability to\nPay\" court costs, claiming she had only $20 in her bank account. This statement was \nknowingly false. Just two days prior, Respondent had transferred $1,576.00 in marital funds to herself, as confirmed by text messages with her relative (Dan Branthoover) on December 16. She then appeared in court swearing she was penniless and could not afford the $400 filing fee. In that same affidavit, Respondent also lied that she alone paid cer"}

She then appeared in court swearing she was penniless and could not afford the $400 filing fee. In that same affidavit, Respondent also lied that she alone paid certain expenses (two car loans and $800 rent plus utilities), when in fact Petitioner had been paying those bills; he continued to pay for the vehicles Respondent claimed to finance on her own. Bank statements and financial records will clearly establish this fact on the merits. Respondent's counsel has never refuted these facts. Thus, Respondent made multiple false statements under oath, meeting Penal Code \u00a7 37.02. Because these affidavits were filed in court proceedings and were material to the case (securing a fee waiver and influencing the court's actions), they also qualify as aggravated perjury under \u00a7 37.03. Each false statement was material to issues before the court (Respondent'sfinancial status and credibility), satisfying the materiality requirement.  \nFalse Statements in Protective Order Filings  \n72. Respondent submitted false sworn statements in her applications for\nprotective orders. Texas Family Code \u00a7 82.009 requires that an application for a temporary ex parte protective order \"contain a detailed description of the facts\" of alleged family violence and be sworn as true by the applicant. Respondent sought an ex parte protective order on or about Dec. 14, 2023, claiming abuse, yet on Dec. 22, 2023, she was photographed laughing and playing with the children alongside Petitioner \u2013 conduct wholly inconsistent with someone in fear of imminent harm. In fact, that same day, she M.2315 M.2315\nM.2315 M.2315 M.2315 M.2315\n\nhad applied for a second protective order against the Petitioner with similar allegations. \nNo credible evidence of family violence was ever presented in thirteen months of litigation but has been used as a barrier from accessing the home where the Petitioner is needed.  \n73.

The contextual evidence of falsity (her normal familial behavior with\nPetitioner the same day she sought Protection) defeated  her sworn claims of \"fear\" or \nviolence and display that they were indeed fabricated. At the very least, her contradictory sworn assertions \u2013 e.g. claiming on Dec. 18 to have an \"active\" protective order based on family violence (to justify a divorce waiver) when in truth none existed \u2013 demonstrate a reckless disregard for the truth under oath. \n74. These false protective order filings were not isolated incidents but part of a\ncalculated strategy to remove Petitioner from the family home and children's lives. The timing of these filings \u2014immediately after the discovery of Respondent's extramarital \nrelationship with Mr. Kazlauskas\u2014reveals their true purpose: not to protect against genuine violence, but to preemptively silence Petitioner and prevent him from exposing Respondent's infidelity and financial misconduct. By falsely claiming fear while simultaneously engaging in normal family activities with Petitioner, Respondent demonstrated the fabricated nature of her allegations.  \n75. The pattern of deception is unmistakable: Respondent drained the family bank\naccount on December 15 -16, filed false indigency claims on December 18, falsely \nclaimed an existing protective order in her divorce petition that same day, then filed yet another protective order application on December 22\u2014all while continuing to interact M.2316 M.2316\nM.2316 M.2316 M.2316 M.2316\n\nnormally with Petitioner at home.

False testimony or affidavits in a civil proceeding can warrant severe\nconsequences. While the proper remedy for \"intrinsic\" fraud (false statements on issues litigated at trial) is often a new trial or sanctions rather than voiding a judgment, courts do not hesitate to act on clear perjury. Texas courts have inherent authority to address fraud on the court, and criminal prosecution for aggravated perjury is a possibility for egregious \nlies under oath. Indeed, aggravated perjury in court proceedings is a felony punishable by \n2\u201310 years' imprisonment (Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 37.03(b)). \n77. That is precisely what has occurred in this case, and Respondent should face\nsome consequences for her actions, but Petitioner believes that prolonged incarceration would not be in the best interests of his children, but that some form of legal repercussion is necessary to deter similar behavior in the future. She has made no effort to defend these claims, no effort to prosecute her case, and the Petitioner prays that this court realize the severity of this situation on those effected most: the children.  \nV. BEST INTEREST OF THE CHILDREN\n78. The Texas Family Code references \"the best interest of the child\" 109 times\nthroughout its text, and throughout the entirety of the code itself \u2013 the word \"always\" only appears once. TEX. FAM. CODE. Sec. 153.002. (The best interest of the child shall M.2317 M.2317\nM.2317 M.2317 M.2317 M.2317\n\nalways be the primary consideration of the court in determining the issues of \nconservatorship and possession of and access to the child.) \n79. Here, this statutory mandate was grossly violated by the Respondent and her\npurported counsel, who have suddenly become active in the litigation here despite remaining silent for over eight months in the parallel case destined for dismissal.  \n80.

Indeed, the instant case reveals a Mother with an agenda to erase the parent\nthe children relied on the most from their lives despite a valid legal reason, and has disregarded their livelihood in the process. \n81. Respondent's conduct constitutes a blatant violation of the \"best interest\"\nstandard mandated by Texas Family Code \u00a7\u00a7 153.001 and 153.002. Texas law declares it the public policy of this state to assure that children have frequent and continuing contact with parents who act in the child's best interest, to provide a safe and stable environment for the child, and to encourage both parents to share in raising the child. Moreover, the best interest of the child must always be the court's primary consideration in matters of conservatorship and access. Respondent has flagrantly defied these principles by prioritizing her extramarital relationship with Mr. Damen Kazlauskas over the emotional, psychological, and familial stability of her own children. \nOrchestrated Campaign of Deception at the Family's Expense \n82. The evidence reveals a disturbing pattern: Respondent orchestrated a\ncomprehensive campaign of deception that sacrificed her children's emotional well-being and family stability to pursue her extramarital relationship. This was not a series of isolated incidents but a calculated strategy that unfolded in precise sequence: M.2318 M.2318\nM.2318 M.2318 M.2318 M.2318\n\n83. First, Respondent engaged in an extramarital relationship with Mr. Kazlauskas\n(evidenced by over 6,500 text messages); \n84. Second, upon discovery of this relationship, she immediately sought\nassistance from Mr. Branthoover to draft legal documents; \n85. Third, she drained the family's financial resources ($1,576) that were intended\nfor the children's Christmas gifts; \n86. Fourth, she filed false protective order applications and a fraudulent indigency\naffidavit;  \n87. Fifth, she misrepresen"}

Fifth, she misrepresented to the court that an active protective order existed\nwhen none did; \n88. Finally, she used these fraudulent filings to remove Petitioner from the family\nhome and children's lives. \n89. Each step in this sequence was designed not to protect the children but to\nadvance Respondent's personal agenda at their expense. The children have been collateral \ndamage in Respondent's effort to reconstruct her life with Mr. Kazlauskas, who she now publicly acknowledges as her partner \"since February 2024\"\u2014a relationship that began while she was still actively living with Petitioner and the children.  \nDeception and Psychological Confusion of the Children \n90. Respondent has knowingly misled the minor children about the status of their\nfamily by telling them that she and Petitioner are already divorced, even though the divorce is not final. This deliberate falsehood serves Respondent's personal narrative but M.2319 M.2319\nM.2319 M.2319 M.2319 M.2319\n\nwreaks emotional havoc on the children. They are left in a state of confusion\u2014believing \ntheir family has been permanently fractured when in fact the legal marriage remains intact. By intentionally misrepresenting such a fundamental truth, Respondent has shown a willingness to confuse and emotionally harm her children to justify her own choices, in direct contravention of her duty to prioritize the children's emotional well-being. \nPrioritizing an Extramarital Relationship Over Family  \n91. Compounding the harm, Respondent is openly celebrating a relationship with\nMr. Kazlauskas \u2013 a man with whom she entered an extramarital relationship while still married to Petitioner.

She has flaunted this relationship and positioned Mr. Kazlauskas as \na replacement father figure to the children, celebrating milestones with him that should be \nreserved for family. In doing so, Respondent elevates her personal relationship over her children's need for stability and continuity with their real father. This behavior sends the children a disturbing message: that their father's role in their lives is interchangeable or unimportant. Such a message is detrimental to the children's best interests, as it undermines their sense of security, identity, and trust in their family structure and the close relationship that they have shared with their father throughout their lives. \nActive Alienation and Erasure of the Father  \n92. Respondent has gone to alarming lengths to minimize and erase Petitioner's\npresence in the children's lives. She has introduced Mr. Kazlauskas to the children as if he were a new parent, while simultaneously telling the children that Petitioner (their father) is no longer in their lives.

The children's current living situation\u2014being raised primarily by elderly\ngreat -grandparents rather than their capable and willing father\u2014further demonstrates \nhow Respondent's personal agenda has superseded the children's needs. Rather than allowing Petitioner to fulfill his parental role and provide daily care and support to the children, Respondent has relegated this responsibility to extended family members, depriving the children of their father's presence, guidance, and care during crucial developmental years. \n94. Respondent's systematic use of false protective orders, perjured testimony,\nand procedural manipulation has created a legal fiction that has kept Petitioner from his children for over thirteen months. This separation was not based on any legitimate safety concern or the children's best interests, but solely on Respondent's desire to reconstruct her family unit with Mr. Kazlauskas at the center \u2014effectively erasing Petitioner from the \nchildren's lives to accommodate her new relationship.

In that petition, she alleged false claims of family violence and sought a waiver of the 60-day waiting\nperiod for divorce, ostensibly to expedite temporary relief by labeling me as an abuser and claiming she had an active\norder of protection against me at the time of filing . \nOn February 1, 2024, a temporary orders hearing was held before an Associate Judge . The parties (through counsel)\nannounced an apparent agreement on temporary custody and other matters. The associate judge signed an \u201cAssociate\nJudge\u2019 s Report for T emporary Orders\u201d , titled as \u201cAgreed Temporary Orders.\u201d Importantly, this report did not itself\nconstitute a signed court order; instead, it outlined the agreed terms and directed further action before any order would\nbe final.

No district judge signed an order at that time \u2013 the associate judge\u2019s report was\nessentially a recommendation  to be formalized in a written order.  \nImmediately after the Feb 1 hearing, Respondent lost confidence in his attorney\u2019 s actions and fired his attorney.\nBelieving that the \u201cagreement\u201d did not reflect the child\u2019 s best interests or was entered under false pretenses (due to\nPetitioner \u2019s unfounded allegations), Respondent promptly withdrew his consent  to the announced terms. On February\n5, 2024, before any temporary order was signed by the court,  Respondent (now pro se) filed an Emergency Motion to\nReconsider and Vacate Temporary Orders . This motion put the court on notice that Respondent no longer consented  to\nthe supposed agreed terms and that he objected to any temporary order being entered as announced.  \nDespite this, the reconsideration was denied and no findings were ever entered.

Section 201.011 of the Texas Family Code provides that an associate judge\u2019s report \u201cmay contain the associate\njudge\u2019s findings, conclusions, or recommendations and may be in the form of a proposed order\u201d. In other words, the\nassociate judge\u2019s report (even if titled \u201cTemporary Orders\u201d) is essentially a draft or advisory decision; it does not itself\ncarry the force of a court order until the proper procedures are completed.  \nFamily Code \u00a7 201.013 unambiguously outlines how and when an associate judge\u2019s proposal becomes an order of the\ncourt. If a party timely requests a de novo hearing by the referring judge, the associate judge\u2019 s proposed order may be\nenforced in the interim (except for certain matters) pending that hearing. However , if no timely request for a de novo\nhearing is filed, the statute states that \u201cthe proposed order or judgment of the associate judge becomes the\norder or judgment of the referring court only on the referring court\u2019 s signing  the proposed order or judgment.\u201d\nThus, absent a de novo appeal, an associate judge\u2019 s recommendation must be signed by the district judge  to have any\nlegal effect. Until the judge signs it, it is merely a proposed  order , not an actual court order.  \nBecause the February 1, 2024 temporary orders were never signed or adopted by the court, Respondent was (and is)\nunder no legal obligation to follow them, and neither party could properly enforce those terms through contempt or other\nremedies. A party cannot be held in contempt for violating a non-existent court order . Here, the \u201cAgreed Temporary\nOrders\u201d are, at most, an agreement between the parties that was not entered as a judgment. When Respondent withdrew\nhis agreement (as discussed below), even that contractual underpinning fell apart.

However, only a void judgment is subject to\ncollateral attack in a separate proceeding. Browning v. Prostok, 165 S.W.3d 336, 346 (Tex. 2005)  (\u201cBrowning v.\nPlacke , 698 S.W.2d 362, 363  (Tex. 1985)\u201d)\nIn this SAPCR, Respondent is effectively collaterally attacking  the temporary orders from the divorce case by asserting\ntheir invalidity . Such a collateral challenge is permissible here because those orders are void. As the Texas Supreme\nCourt has explained, \u201cOnly a void judgment may be collaterally attacked.\u201d Id.\nAccordingly, Respondent asks this Court to formally declare  that the March 26, 2024 \u201cAgreed Temporary Orders\u201d (and\nany interlocutory rulings associated with them) in Cause No. 322-744263-23 are void, of no effect, and not binding  on\nthe parties.

It will also foreclose any attempt to enforce or rely on those non-orders (for example, in claims of violation or in\narguing res judicata). The Court has the authority in equity and under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act (T ex. Civ.\nPrac. & Rem. Code chapter 37) to declare the rights and status of the parties vis-\u00e0-vis that prior proceeding \u2013 particularly\ngiven that the SAPCR directly concerns the child who was also at issue in the divorce temporary orders. Granting such\nrelief is appropriate to prevent confusion and multiplicative litigation. Once the prior \u201corders\u201d are declared void, this Court\ncan proceed to issue fresh temporary orders for the child without any conflict or cloud from the divorce case.  \nIn sum, the prior temporary orders are a legal nullity and this Court should treat them as such. The Court\u2019s order declaring\nthem void will simply recognize the reality that, due to the procedural faults and lack of consent, those orders never had\nlegal existence. This clarification is critical to move forward in protecting the child\u2019 s welfare, as discussed next.   \nImmediate Emergency Relief Is Necessary to Protect the Child\u2019s Best Interest \nEvery day that passes without a valid temporary order is a day of potential harm or uncertainty for the child.

This dynamic, fueled by Petitioner\u2019s unproven allegations of family violence, has caused significant stress\nand instability for the child. Respondent fears that Petitioner is leveraging the appearance of an order to restrict his\ncontact with the child and to make unilateral decisions that are not in the child\u2019 s best interest. Meanwhile, the divorce\nproceeding has not moved forward to a final resolution \u2013 over 12 months  have elapsed since the March hearing, with no\ntrial setting in sight. This stalemate directly af fects the child: there is no clear court-sanctioned framework for\nconservatorship, visitation, or support, and your client has only introduced chaos into their lives.\nThis Court, now handling the SAPCR, has both the authority and the duty to step in and provide stability . Under T ex. Fam.\nCode \u00a7  105.001, \u201cthe court may make a temporary order, including the modification of a prior temporary order, for\nthe safety and welfare of the child,\u201d including orders for temporary conservatorship and possession.\nThe Family Code specifically empowers courts to act expeditiously to protect a child: if there is immediate danger to the\nchild\u2019 s physical or emotional health, the court can even issue temporary orders without notice (such as a temporary\nrestraining order) to address the emergency. Here, Respondent asserts that the child\u2019s emotional welfare is indeed in\njeopardy . The lack of a valid order has enabled Petitioner to marginalize Respondent\u2019s role in the child\u2019s life, purportedly\nunder the guise of the void temporary orders. Petitioner\u2019s false accusations of violence \u2013 never tested or proven in court \u2013\nhave created a pretext for her to limit Respondent\u2019s access.

This scenario is precisely what\nemergency temporary orders are designed to prevent. The Court should not allow a procedural quagmire to result in a\nchild effectively losing a parent or receiving inferior care.  \nMost importantly, the \u201cbest interest of the child\u201d is the paramount consideration in any conservatorship or\npossession decision. See 153.002 TEX. F AM. CODE.\nAll Texas courts must ensure that their orders first and foremost serve the child\u2019s best interest. By that standard,\ncontinuing under the shadow of void orders and parental discord is plainly not in this child\u2019 s best interest. Instead, the\nchild\u2019s best interest calls for fresh, valid temporary orders that set forth clear, fair, and safe arrangements for custody and\nvisitation while the parents\u2019  disputes are resolved. The Court should craft these orders based on current evidence and the\nchild\u2019s needs \u2013 not based on an outdated and unconsented plan from February. The Family Code\u2019s public policy (Tex.\nFam. Code \u00a7 153.001) favors frequent, continuing contact with fit parents and stable environments free of violence or\nabuse.

The mother (divorce petitioner) could argue that\nthe original court \u201chas jurisdiction\u201d over the children by virtue of the pending divorce, so the SAPCR should not proceed\nseparately. However, the void nature of the prior temporary orders is a game-changer. If those orders are void, then\nthe original case has not effectively adjudicated anything regarding the children\u2019s current custody or support. The SAPCR\npetitioner can contend that because the prior orders are null, there is no valid existing order or active management of the\nchildren\u2019s case, and the new court is free to act in the children\u2019s best interests. This is the EXACT argument made . In\neffect, the argument is that the divorce case\u2019s jurisdiction over the children lapsed into dormancy or \u201cdormant jurisdiction\u201d\ndue to your failure to prosecute the case.\nIt\u2019s important to distinguish jurisdiction  from orders . The continuing jurisdiction doctrine  would typically prevent a\ndifferent court from issuing orders if a final order existed or if another court was actively handling the case. But here the\nSAPCR is filed in the same county as the divorce. There is no risk of two different counties competing; it\u2019s an internal\nissue. The SAPCR ef fectively asks the  court to take up a new cause number and to recognize that the old cause has\nstalled and its orders are void.  \nEVEN IF the void argument fails, there is another nuance to this area of law .

Despite the lack of a final order, the\npending divorce still technically invokes the court\u2019 s jurisdiction over the children. Typically, the proper course is to revive or\ndismiss  the dormant divorce, rather than maintain a wholly separate SAPCR on the side. Texas courts adhere to the\nprinciple that the first suit filed (here, the divorce) should dominate; a later-filed suit concerning the same subject (the\nchildren) can be abated to prevent conflicting rulings. In fact, in  In re Shifflet , for example, a party attempted parallel\nlitigation regarding child custody, and the court emphasized that modifications must be filed in the court with jurisdiction\nover the original case\nThe only exception  to the one-court rule is narrow. Texas law does allow a court to lose dominant jurisdiction if the\nparty with the first suit proceeded in bad faith or the suit is not actively pursued. Both apply here. The first suit was\nunquestionably brought in bad faith, as the declaration of an active protective order being in ef fect against the\nRespondent was an intentional fabrication designed to provide your client with an advantage. Despite this, the\nTexas legislature should have prevented the first hearing from ever happening, because 6.405b of the T exas Family\nCode required your client to present the alleged order to the court BEFORE ANY HEARING. \nCONCLUSION \nThus, the SAPCR is appropriately before the court, and the only argument you made in your Response fails.
