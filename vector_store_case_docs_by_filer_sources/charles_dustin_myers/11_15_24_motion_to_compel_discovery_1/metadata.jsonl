On September 19, 2024, Respondent served Petitioner \nwith his First Request for Disclosure, Production, and \nAdmissions pursuant to Rule 190.3 of the Texas Rules of \nCivil Procedure. This request was made under the Level 2 \nDiscovery Control Plan, with the discovery period ending \nthirty days prior to the final trial date. \n4. The Respondent's First Request for Disclosure, \nProduction, and Admissions requested essential information \nand documents, which Petitioner is legally obligated to\n\nprovide. A true and correct copy of this request is \nattached to this Motion as Exhibit A. \n5.Despite the statutory requirement under 198.2(a) of\nthe Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, Petitioner has failed \nto respond or object to these requests in a timely manner. As such, Respondent now seeks an Order from this Court to compel Petitioner to comply with discovery obligations \nunder the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. \nII.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n6.On December 15, 2023, Petitioner defrauded the\nmarital estate by transferring $1,576 to a third party \nwithout Respondent's consent the week of \nChristmas, which \nresulted in the marital account being overdrawn by $800. Respondent specifically requested Petitioner to admit or \ndeny this fact in Request for Admission No. 3, which states: \n\"Admit or deny that Petitioner transferred $1,576 to Daniel \nBranthoover\u2019s PayPal account on December 15, 2023, which \nresulted in the marital bank account being overdrawn by $-\n800.\" \nPetitioner\u2019s failure to respond to this admission request \nwithin the statutory time period should result in it being\n\ndeemed admitted under Tex. R. Civ. P. 198.2(c). This \nadmission is critical to Respondent's claim that Petitioner \nmishandled marital funds and defrauded the marital estate. \n7.On December 15, 2023, Petitioner allegedly\ninfluenced her grandparents to serve an eviction notice on \nRespondent, citing a protective order and divorce petition that had not yet been filed. This is addressed in \nRequest \nfor Admission No. 5, which states: \n\"Admit or deny that over the weekend of December 15, 2023, \nPetitioner influenced her grandparents to serve an eviction \nnotice to Respondent, citing a protective order and divorce \npetition that had not yet been filed.\" \nPetitioner\u2019s lack of response to this admission request \nshould result in it being deemed admitted, supporting Respondent\u2019s claim that the eviction notice was based on \nmisleading or premature grounds. \n8\n.On March 14, 2024, Petitioner, through her attorney,\nserved Respondent with temporary orders. These orders \nincluded Respondent\u2019s alleged consent, as evidenced by his signature. However, Respondent disputes this alleged consent and the validity of these ord\ners, as noted in \nRequest for Admission No. 13, which states:\n\n\"Admit or deny that the Respondent has abi"}

However, Respondent disputes this alleged consent and the validity of these ord\ners, as noted in \nRequest for Admission No. 13, which states:\n\n\"Admit or deny that the Respondent has abided by the \ncurrent temporary orders in place to the best of his \nability, and that the child support calculations, the child \ncustody arrangements, and the current injunctions in place \nhave no legal or factual foundation.\" \nBy failing to respond to this admission request, Petitioner \nhas effectively admitted that the temporary orders and related arrangements lack a legal or factual basis. This deemed admission supports Respondent's challenge to the \nvalidity of these orders.\n \n9.Petitioner\u2019s Original Petition for Divorce, filed on\nDecember 18, 2023, allegedly contains false and misleading \nstatements regarding family violence and the existence of an active protective order. Respondent addressed this \nallegation in \nRequest for Admission No. 6, which states: \n\"Admit or deny that on December 18, 2023, the Original \nPetition for Divorce filed by Petitioner contains false and misleading statements regarding family violence and an active order of protection.\" \nPetitioner\u2019s failure to respond to this admission request \nshould lead to this fact being deemed admitted, supporting Respondent's assertion that the Original Petition for \nDivorce was filed with false claims\n.\n\n10.Similarly, Petitioner\u2019s Protective Order filed on\nDecember 22, 2023, allegedly included additional claims of \nfamily violence without any active protective order in place during the marriage. This is addressed in \nRequest for \nAdmission No. 7, which states: \n\"Admit or deny that on December 22, 2023, the Original \nProtective Order filed by Petitioner contained additional \nclaims of family violence, and at the time of filing, no \nactive order of protection existed, and no such order has existed throughout the marriage.\" \nBy not responding to this request, Petitioner has \neffectively admitted that no active p"}

CONCLUSION  \nEach of these facts corresponds directly to a specific \nRequest for Admission that Petitioner failed to respond to \nwithin the statutory time period. As such, Respondent \nrequests that these facts be deemed admitted by the Court \nunder Tex. R. Civ. P. 198.2(c), as they establish a basis \nfor Respondent\u2019s claims regarding misuse of marital assets, \nfalse statements in legal filings, and improper issuance of \ntemporary orders. \nIV.
