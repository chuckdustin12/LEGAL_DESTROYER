Never filed substantive response to any of Respondent's claims and continues to ask favors from the bench. \nII. LEGAL ANALYSIS  \nA. Dismissal for Want of Prosecution \nLegal Framework \n1. Texas courts have authority to dismiss cases for want of prosecution under both Texas \nRule of Civil Procedure 165a and the court's inherent power to manage its docket. The Texas \nSupreme Court recognized both bases for dismissal in Villarreal v. San Antonio Truck & Equipment , 994 S.W.2d 628 (Tex. 1999). M.1980 M.1980\nM.1980 M.1980 M.1980 M.1980\n\n2. A party seeking affirmative relief has a duty to prosecute the case with due diligence. \nAs stated in  In re Conner , 458 S.W.3d 532 (Tex. 2015) , \u201c[t]he issue here is whether a trial court \nabuses its discretion by refusing to grant a motion to dismiss for want of prosecution in the face \nof unmitigated and unexplained delay. We hold that it does.\u201d Id.  \n3. In family law specifically, In re Marriage of Buster , 115 S.W.3d 141 (Tex. App.\u2014\nTexarkana 2003) emphasized the importance of moving family law cases toward resolution and upheld dismissal after extended inactivity.  \nApplication to Current Case \n4. The facts strongly support dismissal for want of prosecution: \ni. The divorce case has been pending for over 16 months \nii. Petitioner's attorney has failed to prosecute the case since April 24, 2024 \niii. No substantive action taken for approximately 11 months \niv. No responses to discovery, no substantive pleadings, no trial settings \nv. The only recent action was filing a Motion to Consolidate to block emergency relief  \n5. This extended inactivity is precisely the type of conduct t"}

The only recent action was filing a Motion to Consolidate to block emergency relief  \n5. This extended inactivity is precisely the type of conduct that Texas courts have \nconsistently held, which justifies dismissal for want of prosecution. The court should dismiss the dormant divorce case and allow the new SAPCR to proceed independently to address the children's urgent needs. \n M.1981 M.1981\nM.1981 M.1981 M.1981 M.1981\n\nB. Void Orders Due to Lack of Consent  \nLegal Framework \n6. The Texas Supreme Court established in Burnaman v. Heaton, 240 S.W.2d 288, 291 \n(Tex. 1951) that: \"A valid consent judgment cannot be rendered by a court when consent of one \nof the parties is wanting. It is not sufficient to support the judgment that a party's consent thereto may at one time have been given; consent must exist at the very moment the court undertakes to make the agreement the judgment of the court.\" \n7. The Court further held: \"When a trial court has knowledge that one of the parties to a \nsuit does not consent to a judgment, it is error to render a judgment purportedly by agreement; such a judgment is a nullity.\" \n8. This principle was reaffirmed in Padilla v. LaFrance , 907 S.W.2d 454 (Tex. 1995), \nwhich confirmed that a trial court cannot render an agreed judgment after a party has withdrawn consent to a settlement.  \nApplication to Current Case \n9. The orders in this case are void under Burnaman and its progeny because: \ni. The orders claim consent of all parties but only bear signatures of the Petitioner and counsel \nii. Respondent contends he never gave consent to the orders \niii. Respondent actively opposed the terms that locked him out of his home and separated him from the children M.1982 M.1982\nM.1982 M.1982 M.1982 M.1982\n\niv.

The court was aware of the dispute regarding consent (Respondent filed an \nemergency motion challenging the basis for agreement) \n10. Under Texas law, if Respondent did not consent to the orders at the time they were \nrendered, they are void ab initio. The court should declare these orders void and vacate them. \nC. Associate Judge's Orders Never Properly Adopted  \nLegal Framework \n11. Texas Family Code \u00a7 201.013(b) explicitly states: \"Except as provided by Section \n201.007 (Powers of Associate Judge), if a request for a de novo hearing before the referring court \nis not timely filed, the proposed order or judgment of the associate judge b ecomes the order or \njudgment of the referring court only on the referring court's signing the proposed order or judgment .\" \n12. This requirement is mandatory, not discretionary. Without the District Judge's \nsignature, the Associate Judge's order remains merely a \"proposed\" order. \nApplication to Current Case \n13. The orders in this case were issued by an Associate Judge but allegedly never \nproperly adopted or signed by the referring District Court. Under Texas Family Code \u00a7 \n201.013(b), these orders never achieved the status of a final judgment of the court and have no legal effect as final orders.  \n14. This defect alone would be sufficient to challenge their validity, even without the \nconsent issues. The court should declare these orders void or vacate them due to the lack of proper adoption by the referring court. M.1983 M.1983\nM.1983 M.1983 M.1983 M.1983\n\nD. No Continuing Exclusive Jurisdiction (CEJ) \nLegal Framework \n15. Texas Family Code \u00a7 155.001(a) provides: \"A court acquires continuing, exclusive \njurisdiction over the matters provided for by this title in connection with a child on the rendition \nof a final order.\" \n16. Critically, \u00a7 155.001(d) states: \"Unless a final order has been rendered by a court of \ncontinuing, exclusive jurisdiction, a subsequent suit shall be commenced as an original proceeding.\" "}

Critically, \u00a7 155.001(d) states: \"Unless a final order has been rendered by a court of \ncontinuing, exclusive jurisdiction, a subsequent suit shall be commenced as an original proceeding.\" \n17. In In re Burk , 252 S.W.3d 736 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [14th Dist.] 2008), the court held \nthat CEJ is established only upon rendition of a final order, and temporary orders do not establish CEJ.  \nApplication to Current Case \n18. No final order was ever rendered in the divorce case because:  \ni. The Associate Judge's orders were never properly signed by the referring District Court Judge (per \u00a7 201.013(b)) \nii. The orders were void due to lack of consent (per Burnaman v. Heaton) \n19. Without a final order, the 322nd District Court never acquired CEJ over the children. \nTherefore, under \u00a7 155.001(d), the Respondent's new SAPCR was properly \"commenced as an original proceeding\" in the 233rd District Court. \n20. The motion to consolidate should be denied because the 322nd District Court does \nnot have dominant jurisdiction over the children. M.1984 M.1984\nM.1984 M.1984 M.1984 M.1984\n\nE. Exceptions to Dominant Jurisdiction \nLegal Framework \n           21. Generally, when two suits involving the same subject matter are pending in different \ncourts of equal jurisdiction, the court in which the suit was first filed has dominant jurisdiction. However, the Texas Supreme Court in Wyatt v. Shaw Plumbing Co., 760 S.W.2d 245, 247 (Tex. 1988) recognized three exceptions to this rule: \ni. Conduct by a party that estops them from asserting prior active jurisdiction \nii. Lack of persons to be joined if feasible \niii. Lack of intent to prosecute the first lawsuit \nApplication to Current Case \n         22. Even if the 322nd District Court had dominant jurisdiction (which it does not due to \nlack of CEJ), at least two exceptions to the first-filed rule apply: \nEstoppel by Conduct:  \ni. Petitioner allowed the case to become completely dormant  \nii. Failed to comply with Rule 237a's notice "}

The 233rd District Court is the appropriate forum to hear the current disputes because \nthat case was initiated specifically to address the children's urgent needs, free from the entanglements of the stalled divorce. \nF. Attorney Misconduct - Rule 12 Challenge \nLegal Framework \n24. Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 12 provides that a party may file a sworn motion \nstating that they believe a suit is being prosecuted or defended without authority. The challenged \nattorney bears the burden of proving authority to act. If the attorney fails to show authority, the court \"shall refuse to permit the attorney to appear in the cause and  shall strike the pleadings if \nno person who is authorized to prosecute or defend appears.\" \n25. These consequences are mandatory, not discretionary. The court has no choice but to \nbar the attorney and strike the pleadings upon failure to show authority. \nApplication to Current Case \n26. Respondent filed a verified Rule 12 motion on September 20, 2024, challenging \nCooper L. Carter's authority. Ms. Carter has not responded to this challenge for over 6 months. \nAdditional facts supporting the Rule 12 challenge include: \ni.

Ms. Carter lacks a current working phone number or email on file with the State Bar \nv. Ms. Carter has not produced any client authority or engagement agreement in 14 months \n27. Under Rule 12, Ms. Carter's failure to respond to the challenge requires the court to \nrefuse to permit her to appear in the case and strike all pleadings filed by her, including the \nMotion to Consolidate. \nG. Additional Attorney Misconduct  \n \nDiscovery Violations \n28. Ms. Carter failed to respond to Requests for Admissions served on September 17, \n2024, resulting in deemed admissions under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 198. She made no \neffort to withdraw or amend these deemed admissions, effectively conceding critical fa cts against \nher client.  \n29. This constitutes a violation of her duties under Rules 193.2 and 193.5 to timely \nrespond or amend discovery responses. \n M.1987 M.1987\nM.1987 M.1987 M.1987 M.1987\n\nRule 237a Violations \n30. After federal remand on December 6, 2024, Ms. Carter failed to:  \ni. File the required certified copy of the remand order with the clerk \nii. Provide Respondent with mandatory written notice of the remand \n31. This procedural violation prevents the case from moving forward properly and further \ndemonstrates Ms. Carter's neglect of basic procedural duties.  \nAbuse of Process  \n31. Ms. Carter's sudden reappearance after nearly a year of inactivity solely to block \nemergency relief suggests improper purpose. Filing a Motion to Consolidate without addressing \nsubstantive issues appears designed to delay resolution rather than advance the case.  \nThis conduct violates: \ni.

Every day that passes without corrective action leaves the children in an unstable, \nharmful environment. Consolidation would reward procedural stonewalling and cause further \ndelay. The children's best interests require prompt resolution, which can only be achieved by denying consolidation, dismissing the dormant divorce case, and allowing the new SAPCR to proceed expeditiously. \nIII. CONCLUSION AND RELIEF REQUESTED \nBased on the comprehensive legal analysis above, there are multiple independent grounds \nsupporting the Respondent's entitlement to relief: \n1.
