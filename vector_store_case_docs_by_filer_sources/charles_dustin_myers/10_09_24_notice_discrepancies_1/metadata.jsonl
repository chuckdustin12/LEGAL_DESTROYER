DISCREPANCIES IN FILING \n 1. The Respondent filed his Joint Motion for Recusal with the court on October 7, \n2024, but it has yet to be docketed on the reSearchTX platform. The file, which was \ntabbed, indexed, and hyperlinked for convenience, had a size of 19.3 MB at the time of \nsubmission. The Respondent received a receipt confirming acceptance of the filing on \nOctober 7, 2024, at 10:46 a.m. (Exhibit A).

On October 8, 2024, the Respondent received an email from the Court \nCoordinator, Ms. Lindsey Baker, confirming Judge James Munford\u2019s decision to refer the \ncase to the Regional Presiding Judge, David Evans. The email included an Order of \nReferral, signed by Judge Munford on October 8, 2024 (Exhibit B) . \n 3. Upon reviewing the email, the Respond"}

The email included an Order of \nReferral, signed by Judge Munford on October 8, 2024 (Exhibit B) . \n 3. Upon reviewing the email, the Respondent noticed that the attached Motion to \nRecuse  was missing crucial elements, specifically the affidavit and accompanying \nexhibits. Additionally, the tabs and hyperlinks were no longer present. The Respondent \nraised these discrepancies with Ms. Baker, who confirmed that the motion had been filed \nwith the exhibits, despite the Respondent not receiving any indication of this in the receipt provided. \n 4. Dissatisfied with the response, the Respondent pointed out that the file size of \nthe motion submitted on October 7, 2024, and the one sent via email differed \nsignificantly. It appeared that an unverified and modified version of the motion had been \nforwarde d to Judge Evans (Exhibit B). \n5. On the morning of October 9, 2024, the Respondent received the Order of \nReferral and correspondence to Judge Evans at 10:39 a.m., which still contained the \nsame discrepancies noted earlier (Exhibits C and D) .\n\n6. At 12:17 p.m. on the same day, Ms. Baker sent further correspondence stating:  \n\u201cAttached is correspondence from Judge Munford to Judge Evans and an \nAmended Order of Referral.  \nDue to the length of the Joint Motion to Recusal, it is being sent as three \nattachments . Thank you. \u201d Exhibit E  \n  \nDespite this explanation, the Amended Order of Referral has not been filed on the \nreSearchTX platform, raising additional concerns regarding the handling of the original motion. The reasoning provided for splitting the motion into three attachments only arose \nafter the file size discrepancy was highlighted, and there is still no confirmation that the \ncorrect version of the motion was forwarded to Judge Evans or exists within the official \ncase file.  \nII.

THE RESEARCH TX PLATFORM  \n7. The reasoning given by Ms. Baker regarding the file size raises further \nquestions. According to the District Clerk\u2019s e -filing frequently asked questions (FAQs), \nattached as Exhibit F , the following guidelines are provided : \nQ: Do you want all exhibits uploaded as separate documents or merged into one \ndocument? \nA: Merged into one document.  \n   \nQ: Should any exhibits be submitted as attachments to petition or as \nseparate filing?\n\nA: Exhibits should be merged into the lead document for a single filing. \n  \nQ: Exhibits \u2013 Are these uploaded as attachments to the petition. If yes, do you \nwant them uploaded singly or do you want all the exhibits combined into a single \ndocument? \nA: Preference is to have exhibits as part of the lead document they are filing, \nas long as they don't exceed the 35mb per envelope size limit. Lead \ndocuments get file -marked; attachments do not get file marked.  \n \nThe Respondent\u2019s original motion complied with these guidelines, as the total file size \nwas well below the 35 MB limit. However, despite this, the court opted to split the \ndocument into three parts. Additionally, the docket still shows that neither the ori ginal \nmotion to recuse nor the subsequent correspondence or amended order from Judge Munford have been properly filed or docketed.  \n8.

Given that a true copy of the Amended Order of Referral has not been filed or \ndocketed as required by Rule 21a, and in light of the contradictions between the court \ncoordinator\u2019s explanation and the FAQs, the Respondent respectfully raises these \nconcerns. The Respondent further requests clarification from the Court regarding the \npurpose of modifying the document in a manner that causes it to appear as an unverified \npleading , which is fatal to the motion. See TEX. R. CIV . P. 18a(a)(1). \nCONCLUSION  \nThe Respondent respectfully requests that the Court take immediate corrective \naction to ensure that all filings, including the Amended Order of Referral, are properly docketed in accordance with Rule 21a and that all parties, including the Respondent, have  \nfull and equal access to the court\u2019s records and filings.
