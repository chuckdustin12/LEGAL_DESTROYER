Falsifying a Statement of Inability to Pay\n2. Lying on the divorce petition\n3. Lying on the protective order.\n4. Trying to have me unlawfully evicted.\nSubsequently, on January 16, 2024, without a fair opportunity for the Petitioner to be heard due to inclement weather\nleading to court closures, Judge Munford presided over the only open court and signed a temporary order removing the\nPetitioner from his home and granting full temporary custody to Morgan Michelle Myers, herein referred to as the\nRespondent.\nThis motion contends that these temporary orders were made without considering the Petitioner's rights to a fair hearing\nas stipulated in Texas Family Code Section 152.205 and without substantial evidence to justify such drastic measures.\nLegal Grounds for Modification\nViolation of Right to Be Heard: \nThe temporary orders were made without providing the Petitioner an adequate opportunity to be heard, in violation of\nTexas Family Code Section 152.205.b.\nEven after acquiring legal counsel, Morgan was granted another continuance after not holding up her end of the\nagreement.\nBest Interest of the Children: \nThe temporary"}

The Petitioner respectfully requests the court to reverse the temporary orders regarding his eviction and the full custody\ngranted to the Respondent.\nb. Restoration of Previous Custody Arrangement:\n The Petitioner seeks the restoration of the custody arrangement that existed prior to the temporary orders, where he\nmaintained a significant role in his children's lives.\nc. Expedited Hearing: Given the urgency and significant impact on the Petitioner and his children, an expedited hearing is\nrequested.\nConclusion\nThe Petitioner respectfully urges the court to consider the detrimental impact of the current temporary orders on the\nchildren's well-being and the Petitioner's parental rights. \nThe Petitioner reaffirms his commitment to the best interest of his children and requests the court to modify the\ntemporary orders to restore the previous custody arrangement and allow him to return to his residence until a fair hearing\nimmediately, and without delay.\nRespectfully submitted,\nCharles\n______\nDan, this is absurd.
