STATEMENT OF FACTS  \n1. Respondent removed this case to the United States District Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a71446(d) on December 2, 2024, immediately suspending state court jurisdiction upon \nremoval.  \n2. Following subsequent remand from the federal court, jurisdiction would only resume in \nstate court upon filing a certified Notice of Remand pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a71447(c). \n3. No such certified Notice of Remand has been filed with the Clerk of this Court as \nrequired by federal law, nor has Respondent been properly served with such notice.

Petitioner and her counsel are procedurally unable to file or serve the required certified \nNotice of Remand electronically through the mandated Electronic Filing Manager (\"EFM\"), violating mandatory filing and service procedures as required by Texas Rule of \nCivil Procedure 21(f) . \n5. Additionally, current judicial recusal proceedings under Texas Rules of Civil Procedure 18a and 18b place jurisdictional authority for administrative issues with the Regional Presiding Judge, suspending any substantive authority by the trial court pending resolution. \n6. Due to these facts, state court jurisdiction remains suspended and cannot lawfully proceed.  \n7. Because COOPER L.
