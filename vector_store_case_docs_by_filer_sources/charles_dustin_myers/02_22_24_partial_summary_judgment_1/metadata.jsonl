Detailed herewith are the \nenumerated  facts underpinning this motion:  \n1. On December 14th, 2023, the Petitioner sought an EX -PARTE Order of \nProtection from the Court, which was judiciously denied, affirming the \nabsence of immediate threat or harm that warranted such an extraordinary \nmeasure. Undeterred by this judicial determin ation, the Petitioner proceeded \nto file for divorce on December 18th, 2023, misleadingly alleging the existence \nof an active Order of Protection against the Respondent. This deliberate \nmisrepresentation constitutes not merely an attempt to skew the legal p rocess \nin the Petitioner\u2019s favor but represents a flagrant abuse of the judicial system \ndesigned to secure an undue advantage in the divorce proceedings, which ha s \nultimately been successful.  \n \n2. On December 22nd, 2023, the Petitioner initiated a subsequent application for \na Protective Order, forming the cornerstone of litigation since the initial \nhearing on January 16th, 2024.  \n \n3.

This lack of evidence fundamentally challenges the integrity and validity of \nthe orders affectin g the lives and welfare of the children involved. The necessity for the \ncourt to vacate these orders and revert to the status quo ante is underscored by the \nfollowing critical legal argument s: \n1 . Misalignment with Texas Family Code Sec. 105.001:   \n \n1.1 The orders issued on January 16th, 2024, and continued on January \n22nd, 2024, starkly conflict with Texas Family Code Sec. 105.001, which \nunequivocally necessitates notice and a hearing prior to the issuance of \nsuch orders. This statute ensures that partie s are given a fair opportunity to \nbe heard, a fundamental aspect of due process, which was conspicuously \nabsent in this case.  \n \n2. Contravention of Texas Family Code Sec. 105.005:  \n2.1 The initial rendering of temporary orders on January 16th, 2024, did \nnot adhere to Texas Family Code Sec. 105.005 , requiring that court's \nfindings be grounded in a preponderance of the evidence  before making \nany child custody determination affecting the parent -child relationship .  \n \n2.2 The absence of evidence from the Petitioner, juxtaposed with the \ndisregard for the Respondent's timely submissions, underscores a \nsignificant deviation from this legal requirement.  \n \n3. Violation of Texas Family Code Sec. 153.002:   \n \n3.1 The proceedings failed to prioritize \"The best interest of the child,\" as \nmandated by Texas Family Code Sec. 153.002. This principle, deemed \nparamount in determining issues of conservatorship, possession, and \naccess, was overlooked.  \n \n3.2 The Respondent's work -from-home situation and the need for a  \n-4- \nCopy from re:SearchTX\n\nreasonable transition period to maintain his pivotal role in his children \u2019s \nlives were disregarded, further e"}

Equal Opportunity and Fair Hearing (Sec. 152.205 & Sec. 105.003):  \n4.1 The Texas Family Code Sec. 152.205  and Sec. 105.003  enshrine the \nnecessity for equitable procedural rights, mandating that all parties are \ngranted a fair opportunity for notification and a meaningful hearing. The \nRespondent \u2019s ability to engage fully in the hearing process and to present a \ncomprehensive defense was significantly impeded, a deviation from the \ndue process envisaged by these statutes. Consequently, the temporary \norders issued lack the foundational fairness that i s central to the justice \nsystem and contravene the legal safeguards intended to ensure balanced \nparticipation by all parties in family law proceedings.  \n \n5. Managing Conservatorship Considerations (Sec. 153.005 & Sec. 153.007):  \n5.1 In deliberations of conservatorship, Texas Family Code Sec. 153.005 \nobligates the court to deliberate thoroughly on the child \u2019s best interest, \nincluding the living circumstances and stability provided by the parents. \nAdditionally, Sec. 153.007  advocates for the establishment of a mutually \nagreed parenting plan, prioritizing the child \u2019s welfare and the continuity of \ntheir established routine.

Rules of Dispositions for Family Law Cases \u2013 (Tarrant County Rules):  \n6.1 The provisions under Rule 4.02: Trial Procedures of the Tarrant Family \nRules , specifically Part 4  concerning the disposition of family law cases, \nhave been notably contravened in the ongoing proceedings of the.
