This case was procured through fraudulent means, intended to deprive \nRespondent of custody of his children and his marital home at 6641 Anne Court, \nWatauga, Texas 76148. On January 16, 2024, Respondent was removed from the \nresidence based on court orders influenced by the false representations made in this \nmatter. Furthermore, on March 6, 2024, Petitioner unlawfully locked Respondent out of the home, exacerbating the harm caused by these proceedings. \n2. Prior to filing the divorce proceedings, Petitioner utilized Defendant \nBranthoover\u2019s PayPal account to transfer marital funds into a concealed bank account, depriving Respondent of access to financial resources. Immediately following this transfer, Petitioner submitted an Affidavit of Inability to Pay Court \nCosts (IFP Statement) to this Court. \n3. Petitioner\u2019s Original Petition for Divorce misrepresented the facts by alleging \nthe existence of an active protective order against Respondent and claiming findings \nof family violence during the marriage, both of which were demonstrably false.

Additionally, Petitioner\u2019s Application for a Protective Order relied on baseless claims of family violence that caused significant damage to Respondent\u2019s livelihood and the financial stability of the children. No supporting evidence was provided to \nsubstantiate these allegations. \n4. At the time of these filings, Petitioner was self-represented and enlisted the \nassistance of Defendant Branthoover, who is not an attorney but has extensive M.1447 M.1447\nM.1447 M.1447 M.1447 M.1447\n\n3 \n knowledge of protective orders and a documented history of falsifying government \nrecords. Branthoover\u2019s involvement included drafting and preparing legal documents designed to mislead the Court, furthering the fraudulent scheme. \n5. These actions have been detailed in the related federal lawsuit as well as within \nthis matter, where the claims remain uncontested. The issues presented in the federal case bear directly on the integrity of the proceedings before this Court. \nCONCLUSION \nConsidering the above, Respondent respectfully requests this Court to take \njudicial notice of the related federal case and should use its discretion to dismiss  this \nmatter without prejudice to avoid the continued waste of judicial resources.  \nRespondent believes further that Petitioner has no ability to prosecute the case. \nRespondent reserves the right to seek additional relief as necessary to preserve his \nlegal rights and protect the best interests of his children.  \nRespectfully submitted on this 31st day of December 2024.

After Plaintiff suffered these losses, Defendant continued to harass the\nPlaintiff by texting him throughout the proceeds he helped initiate, calling him \n\u201cpathetic\u201d and stating that he has \u201cenjoyed watching every filing get denied\u201d. This conduct is outrageous because the harm suffered by Plaintiff was a direct cause of \nDefendant\u2019s actions, and Defendant\u2019s clear interest in the case has been made apparent M.1458 M.1458\nM.1458 M.1458 M.1458 M.1458\n\n9 notwithstanding his enjoyment of the damages he has caused to Plaintiff through his \nown admission. \n38. Further, Defendant knew that Plaintiff operated his business out of his\nresidency, knew of his recent success, his close relationship with his daughters, and \nwas aware that Plaintiff was the primary breadwinner in the household, yet played an \nintegral role in his unjust removal through deceptive measures. \n39. Finally, Defendant inflicted severe emotional distress on Plaintiff by\nassisting in the act of up-ending his life by influencing his marriage to its\u2019 detriment, helping sever the close relationship he had with his children, and playing a crucial role in the destruction of Plaintiff\u2019s business he had built to provide for his family, causing reckless financial and emotional harm that has been ongoing since his involvement. \n40. Defendant\u2019s self-admitted enjoyment of Plaintiff\u2019s distress is particularly\negregious as it has affected far more than just Plaintiff\u2019s well-being, but has undone years of hard work and the damage is ongoing and is expected to persist into the future considering that the case he helped initiate is fundamentally flawed and has been stagnant for nearly 10 months. \nDAMAGES \nDefendant\u2019s actions alleged herein have caused significant and irreparable harm \nto Plaintiff and his family, who seeks redress in damages; compensatory and \nspecial, and seeks punitive damages to deter this behavior from occurring in the \nfuture.  \n41.

Under Oklahoma law, any person who suffers detriment from the unlawful\nact or omission of another may recover compensation in the form of damages. (See \nOkla. Stat. tit. 23, \u00a7 3). Plaintiff has suffered significant detriment due to Defendant's conduct, including the loss of income, increased living expense, personal and marital \nproperty, harm to his business, and harm to his familial relationships, which have all \ncaused  severe emotional distress. \nLoss of income \n43. Startin g in December 2023, the Defendant\u2019s involvement directly disrupted\nPlaintiff\u2019s ability to focus on business operations and maintain client relationships. \nThis disruption coincided with an accelerated decline in income, as reflected by \nPlaintiff\u2019s income showing a sharper drop in monthly earnings. \n44. Prior to the Defendant\u2019s involvement, Plaintiff\u2019s average monthly income\nfrom Source 1 was approximately $3,612.83 over the 13 months preceding December \n2023. Following the Defendant\u2019s involvement, Plaintiff\u2019s average monthly income \ndropped to $1,813.02, representing a significant reduction of nearly 50%. Over the subsequent 13 months, this decline resulted in a total income loss of approximately $23,397.60 (Exhibit A) as a direct result of Defendant\u2019s actions. \n45. Similarly, Plaintiff\u2019s Source 2 transaction revenue data reflects a comparable\ntrend. The annual transaction revenue dropped from $26,514.94 in 2023 to $15,099.78  \nin 2024, resulting in a loss of $11,415.16  over that period.

Combined, the total \nloss of income is projected at $67,825.69 by this time next year given all circumstances \nare the same and factoring in consequential damages. \n47. Defendant\u2019s actions have caused advertisements to stop running for\nPlaintiff\u2019s business, which have resulted in lost business opportunities and decreased website traffic, leading to lost business opportunities estimated at $14,200. (Exhibit C)  \nIncreased living expenses \n48. During the pendency of the litigation instigated by Defendant, Plaintiff has\nbeen unable to access his home, resulting in a substantial increase in living costs to remain near his children as they had been accustomed to. \n49. This forced Defendant to stay in hotels to exercise Thursday visitation and\nrequired him to rent local Airbnb locations to provide a stable living space for his children during extended periods.\n The total cost of Airbnb during the relevant period is \n$14,553.89, and additional hotel costs amount to $873.31 to maintain the status quo of \nthe Children to the best of Plaintiff\u2019s ability.

In this case, the Defendant exploited his offer of assistance to the Plaintiff,\nsubsequently diverting marital funds and orchestrating the initiation of divorce proceedings with the intent to cause harm.
