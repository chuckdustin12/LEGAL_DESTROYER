Additionally , the Texas Supreme Court in Curtis v . Gibbs, 51 1 S.W .2d 263 (T ex.\n1974) expressly carved out exceptions to dominant jurisdiction where:\nThe original case was filed in bad faith,\nThe case isn't been prosecuted;\nEquity and justice require an independent forum.\nAll three conditions are present here. The SAPCR was filed in good faith after the 322nd case became procedurally\nstalled and legally defective\u2014with no Notice of Remand, no evidentiary rulings on the children, and pending dispositive\nmotions including unopposed requests for dismissal. \nIt would be prejudicial to the children to consolidate a case that had no ability to proceed.\nThank you.\nRespectfully ,\nCharles Dustin Myers\nPro Se Petitioner\n[Quoted text hidden]4/8/25, 11:40 AM Gmail - RE ITIO MYERS CHILDREN, CAUSE NO. 233-765358-25 CL-12105\nhttps://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ik=13839461f7&view=pt&search=all&permthid=thread-f:1827488253181598941&simpl=msg-f:182748825318159894\u2026 3/3\n\nEXHIBIT 2\nCOMMUNICATIONS \nREGARDING TRO\n\nFUDST OP <chuckdustin12@gmail.com>\nCAUSE# 233-765358-25 EX-P ARTE TRO\n5 messages\nFUDST OP <chuckdustin12@gmail.com> Wed, Mar 26, 2025 at 5:48 PM\nTo: FLCCoordinator@tarrantcountytx.gov\nHello, \nThis is Charles Dustin Myers, Petitioner in the above captioned cause, and I received an automated reply deferring me to\nthis email when originally reaching out to the Honorable Coordinator .\nThe original email's purpose was to inform the Honorable Coordinator that I had just"}
