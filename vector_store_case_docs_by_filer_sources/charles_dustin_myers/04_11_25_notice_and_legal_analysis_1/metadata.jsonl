On March 28, 2025, Petitioner got ready, drove to court, paid for parking, met with \nthe coordinator, contacted opposing counsel, and everyone agreed to set the TRO for a full \nhearing on April 10, 2025, and Petiti oner went before the Associate Judge to have his emergency \nmotion heard. \n 11.

The reason provided was that \u201cthe consolidation motion was filed in the wrong court \u201d \nand that a forward -looking consolidation motion warranted outright refus al of the emergency \nTRO before her.  \n 13.

Two days later, without any notice to the parties, without any hearing set , without \naddressing the objection on file , and before transferring the case, the District Judge of this court \nsigned and filed an order titled ORDER ON MOTION TO CONSOLIDATE . \n 18. The court has shown it has the ability to act on its \u2019 own accord, but intentionally \nchose the path of most resistance.\n\n19.

A Texas district court\u2019s sua sponte consolidation of cases without notice or a hearing  \noffends fundamental due process and violates Texas procedure.

Consolidating two family law cases without giving the parties notice or a chance to be \nheard flouts this requirement and thus constitutes an abuse of discretion . The Texas Supreme \nCourt recognizes that \u201c[f]ailure to give notice violates \u2018the most rudimentary demands of due \nprocess\u201d  Armstrong v. Manzo, 380 U.S. 545, 550, 85 S.Ct. 1187, 14 L.Ed.2d 62 (1965)) . While a\n\nlack of notice or hearing may not automatically render an order void, it does render it voidable as \na due process violation. In short, entering a consolidation order on its own motion, without any \nparty setting the matter for submission or hearing, deprives the objecting party of the fair process guaranteed by Rule 21 and the Fourteenth Amendment . \n3. The judge\u2019s failure to hold a hearing here is especially egregious because Petitioner \nhad filed a written objection  in this court , and a pre -objection in the 322\nnd district court,  putting \nboth court s on notice that consolidation was contested.  \nB. Ignoring the Written Objection  \n 4. Consolidating in the face of a pending written objection \u2013 without addressing or \nformally overruling that objection \u2013 is contrary to Texas procedure and due process. Texas Rule \nof Civil Procedure 174 authorizes consolidation only \u201c[w]hen actions involving a common \nquestion of law or fact are pending before the court\u201d  and anticipates that the court will exercise \n\u201csound and legal discretion\u201d to avoid prejudice  to the parties .  \n 5.

In analogous contexts, the Texas Supreme Court has insisted that a trial court must not proceed to decide a matter while an objection or lack of consent is known and unresolved. For example, in Burnaman v. Heaton, the high court held it improper for a court to sign an agreed judgment when it knows a party has withdrawn consent; \u201c consent must exist at the very moment the court \nundertakes to make the agreement the judgment of the court \u201d.  \n6. When a trial judge is aware that one party does not consent or objects, the judge should \nrefuse to approve the proposed action without hearing the party\u2019s challenge . By analogy, the \njudge here had notice that consolidation was contested yet proceeded regardless \u2013 effectively\n\ntreating the motion as if unopposed. This undermines the purpose of Rule 174, which is to \npromote convenience without unfairly prejudicing  a party\u2019s rights . \n7. Ignoring a live objection also violates basic due process, as it denied the objecting \nparty any forum to argue why consolidation was improper (for example, due to dominant jurisdiction or prejudice). In sum, issuing the order without addressing the objecti on was a clear \nabuse of discretion . At minimum, the consolidation order is voidable for lack of due process and \nshould be vacated upon a proper challenge. If the objection went entirely unheard, the order\u2019s validity is highly suspect under Burnaman\u2019s mandate of a party\u2019s right to be heard before an adverse order .

Texas Family Code \u00a7155.201 (the continuing exclusive jurisdiction statute) requires \nthat when a SAPCR is pending in one court and a new proceeding concerning the child is filed in another court, the second action must be transferred  to the court with continuing jurisdiction. In \nfact, transfer is a necessary condition precedent to consolidation in such situations . See In the \nInterest of J.V .O. and J.R.O. III ., No. 04- 20-00346- CV (Tex. App. \u2013 San Antoni o, 2021). The \nFourth Court of Appeals recently emphasized that a motion to \u201cconsolidate\u201d an earlier SAPCR\n\nwith a later divorce implied a mandatory transfer; while labeled a consolidation, it \n\u201caccomplished the same purpose\u201d  as a transfer, and the judge signing the order was effectively \nacting on behalf of the SAPCR court to effect the required transfer . Id.  \n 10. By contrast, in our case no such transfer order or exchange of benches occurred. The \nnewer case was never properly vested  in the court that assumed control. A judge cannot \nunilaterally reach out and seize a case from another court\u2019s docket without a statutory transfer. Thus, to the extent the consolidation order was entered without a valid transfer of venue or jurisdiction , it is void (not merely voidable) for want of subject- matter jurisdiction over the \nsecond case.

Here, the \njudge consolidated into the older case sua sponte  without the new case ever being properly \ntransferred. This end- run around the usual venue transfer process is inconsistent with Curtis v. \nGibbs  and Texas\u2019s dominant -jurisdiction doctrine. It suggests the consolidation order is \nprocedurally invalid and should be treated as a nullity.  \nVoid or Voidable?  12. Given the above defects, one must determine whether the consolidation order is void \nab initio or merely voidable (subject to reversal upon direct attack). Under Texas law, an order is void if the court lacked jurisdiction or capacity to act, whereas an order issued in violation of procedural requirements (but within the court\u2019s jurisdiction) is typically voidable . Travelers Ins. \nCo. v. Joachim , 315 S.W.3d 860, 863 (Tex.2010).\n\n13. In this case, the consolidation was accomplished through serious procedural \nirregularities: no notice, no hearing, ignoring a filed objection, and, critically,  no proper transfer \nof the case between courts. The strongest argument for treating the order as void  is the lack of \njurisdictional authority to consolidate without a transfer. Because the newer SAPCR was never \nformally transferred, the judge who consolidated may have had no power over that case or the subject matter \u2013 a jurisdictional flaw rendering the order void.  14. On the other hand, to the extent the court did  have subject -matter jurisdiction , such as \nhere, the consolidation order\u2019s other defects o f no notice, hearing, or considering the objection, \nwould make it voidable for abuse of discretion, but not absolutely void.

If void, it can be attacked anytime  (even \ncollaterally); if voidable, it must be set aside through direct appellate relief. Here, the Petitioner \nhas promptly sought relief, so whether labeled void or voidable, the improper consolidation \nshould be vacated. Notably, the order\u2019s timing\u2014issued while a mandamus was pending on the TRO\u2014further indicates it was a mechanism of expediency rather than a valid judicial act , \nreinforcing that it should carry no legal force.  \nConflict with Texas Supreme Court Precedent  \n 16. By consolidating the newer action into the older one on its own motion \u2013 rather than \ndismissing or abating it \u2013  the trial judge here achieved the opposite of Curtis : instead of \neliminating the conflict, the judge effectively absorbed the second suit without following the safeguards (notice, transfer order, etc.) that Curtis  and its sister cases require. The consolidation \norder thus violates the spirit of Curtis v. Gibbs , which is to uphold the orderly administration of\n\njustice and prevent \u201cunseemly conflict\u201d between courts.

Texas \nappellate courts have recognized that they may proceed to decide an issue that is \u201ctechnically\u201d moot when the surrounding circumstances indicate manipulation or when the underlying problem is capable of repetition yet evading review. Here, the timing and method of the consolidation suggest it was done for the express purpose of \u201cmooting\u201d the mandamus complaint \nabout the TR O. Courts disfavor such tactics. As Chief Justice Hecht has observed, mandamus \nrelief acts on a judge\u2019s conduct, not merely on the existence of an order: \u201cUnlike remedies \ngranted by appeal, a mandamus writ is not an action on an order or judgment but is instead an order against the respondent to correct a clear abuse of discretion .\u201d In other words, the appellate \ncourt\u2019s mandamus jurisdiction is \u201coriginal, not derivative of the trial court\u2019s order\u201d , and \ncannot be defeated by the trial court attempting to obscure jurisdiction.  \n19. Allowing the consolidation to moot the mandamus would reward the very procedural \ntrickery that the appellate process is designed to check. The Second Court of Appeals should therefore retain jurisdiction to review the TRO issue (and the consolidation order itself, if necessary) despite the trial court\u2019s attempt to merge the cases. Texas law is clear that a trial court\n\ncannot evade appellate review  by unilateral actions. For example, in Curtis v. Gibbs  the \nSupreme Court granted mandamus to undo conflicting orders, ensuring the first court\u2019s orders \n(like a TRO or injunction) were subject to proper review . \n20.

Either route prevents a miscarriage of justice. The key point is that the Court of A ppeals\u2019 mandamus power persists  in the face of \nthese procedural anomalies. A party\u2019s right to appellate review of a void/voidable order cannot be defeated by the trial judge\u2019s self- help remedy of consolidation. If it were otherwise, a trial court \ncould always attempt to moot pending appeals or mandamus actions by hurriedly altering the status quo \u2013 a result no appellate court should countenance.  \nConclusion \nIn sum, a sua sponte consolidation under these circumstances is rife with legal error. It \nviolated the notice and hearing requirements of Rule 21, ignored a pending objection (in derogation of due process and Burnaman), defied the dominant -jurisdiction rule (Curtis v.
