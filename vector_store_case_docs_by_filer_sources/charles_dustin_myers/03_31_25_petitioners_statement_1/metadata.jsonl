The case was remanded on December 8, 2024, for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.  Exhibit 1  \n3. Rule 237a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure states:  \n\u201cWhen any cause is removed to the Federal Court and is afterwards remanded to the state \ncourt, the plaintiff  shall file  a certified copy of the order of remand with the clerk of the \nstate court and shall forthwith give written notice of such filing to the attorneys of record \nfor all adverse parties.\u201d (emphasis added)  \nIN RE: M.E.M., ET AL.    \n**CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, **   \n  \nPetitioner,   \n  \n Petitioner\u2019s Statement  \nMORGAN MICHELLE MYERS,   \n  \nRespondent.   \n  \n2025 -03-31  233-765358-25 FILED\nTARRANT COUNTY\n4/1/2025 12:00 AM\nTHOMAS A.

CARTER\u2019s authority to represent MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS has been in \nquestion since September 20, 2024, in cause number 322- 744263- 23 and is similarly in question in the \ninstant case.  \n6. COOPER L.

CARTER have filed any pleading since \nApril 24, 2024, in the divorce matter , nearly twelve months ago.  \n11. COOPER L. CARTER has left the 322nd District Court without any ability to proceed \nto final trial, thereby resulting in an inevitable dismissal for want of prosecution. Exhibit 2  \n12. COOPER L. CARTER \u2019s EFM is registered to  her prior employer\u2019s email address, \nwhich has been pointed out several times by Petitioner. Exhibit 3  \n13. The 322nd District Court of Tarrant County does not have  continuous exclusive \njurisdiction of the minor children.  \n14. The Petitioner opened a separate SAPCR before this court in March of 2025.\n\n15. Without any submissions from Respondent since April 24, 2024, COOPER L. \nCARTER suddenly submits pleadings to this court claiming bad faith and answers with a general \ndenial.  \n16. COOPER L.

The parties selected April 10, 2025, to have the hearing, and the Petitioner went \nbefore the Associate Judge to present his emergency TRO.  Exhibit 7  \n20. Prior to being called up to present, the Associate Judge left the room and conversed \nwith the court coordinator. \n21. When she returned, Petitioner was called up to present the emergency TRO. 22. Before getting a chance to speak, the Associate Judge informed the Petitioner that \nCOOPER L. CARTER had filed the consolidation motion in the wrong court and would be filing \none with the 322\nnd District Court.  \n23. The Petitioner was denied an opportunity to present his emergency TRO and  was told \nto instead file the pleading with the 322nd District Court.  \n24. The Petitioner then reminded the Associate Judge that the 322nd District Court does \nnot have the ability to proceed on the merits lacking a certified notice of remand pursuant to Rule 237a .\n\n25. The Associate Judge disagreed and refused to hear the emergency TRO.  \n26. At the close of business on March 28, 2025, nothing was ever filed with the 322nd \nDistrict Court by COOPER L. CARTER.  \n27. Petitioner and the children in this suit were denied due process outright despite being \ncorrect in his legal position. \n28. Petitioner\u2019s detriment to his position is the fact that he is self -represented.  \n29. Respondent\u2019s detriment to her position is the lack of prosecution or defense. \nII. ARGUMENT  \n30. When it comes to remand, the obligation falls on the plaintiff to file with the state \ncourt a certified copy of the order of remand. TEX. R. CIV . P. 237a; see also Kashan v.

App. Jun. 7, 2012)  (holding that rule 237a\u2019s notice \nrequirements cannot be satisfied by the district court, but must come from the plaintiff.)  \n 31.

All other facts supported by evidence have already been provided to COOPER L. \nCARTER yet  continues to not engage and instea d call in favors from t he bench.  \n \nIII. CONCLUSION \nPetitioner  traveled to this court with a prepared emergency supported by exhibits only to \nbe turned away at the eleventh hour due to his self -represented status and in the face of no real \nopposition. The children were denied due process outright, and now have been l eft without a \nremedy. The proper course of action should have been to hear the TRO and put in place protections for the minor children pending any promises of consolidation.\n\nThe above statement of facts, unless promptly rebutted by COOPER L. CARTER, warrant \nimmediate relief as duly requested in the emergency TRO through a declaratory judgement, and this court \nshould proceed with the hearing date originally set for April 10th, 2025, and the emergency TRO should be \nGRANTED without further delay.  \nCOOPER L. CARTER disrupted much needed relief for the minor children in this case with false \npromises delivered to the tribunal that directly undermined the Petitioner\u2019s due process rights. COOPER L. \nCARTER is fully aware that she cannot file anything in 322nd District Court because in doing so she would \nbe acting ultra vires.    \nPetitioner reasserts his position that COOPER L. CARTER is acting without authority, has no \nability to comply with 237a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure , and cannot explain how she is able to \nabandon a case for nearly a full calendar year, yet can suddenly show up to defend her alleged client before \nthis court for the sole purpose to prevent Petitioner\u2019s emergency TRO from being heard , which was \npermitted despite being told he could present the motion. In what sense is this appropriate when children are involved? Does the attorney\u2019s license give her a free pass to thwar"}

In what sense is this appropriate when children are involved? Does the attorney\u2019s license give her a free pass to thwart the rules and litigate in bad faith?  \nIt may be a needle in the haystack, but this case defies the initial presumption that pro -se litigants \nare not as equipped or as capable as licensed attorneys, and it is no fault of COOPER L. CARTER. The \nPetitioner reminds the court that the true culprit responsible for this circumstance remains the puppet master \nhiding in the background \u2013 the Respondent \u2013 and yet Petitioner wishes no harm to her because this litigation \nis about the children. The children need their mother, but they also need their father.  \nPerhaps the zealous passion has been misunderstood for contempt by the tribunal, but Petitioner\u2019s \nmotive runs parallel to that set forth in the Texas Family Code. However, despite the procedural quagmire, the anomalies, the pro -se status, the solution rema ins simple:  \nGrant the relief. Nobody has argued against it, Texas law demands  it, and the best interests of the \nChildren depend on it. There remains no logical or legal basis to give COOPER L. CARTER any further \ndeference in the face of Petitioner\u2019s self -represented status.  Petitioner  welcome s any response from\n\nCOOPER L. CARTER to the contrary . If such response were to be filed, it would be the first in over fourteen \nmonths of litigation.  \nIf approached from a logical standpoint, the situation can be interpreted as such:  \ni. COOPER L. CARTER is shackled by Rule 12 and Rule 237a of the \nTexas Rules of Civil Procedure  from reaching final trial. \nii. The 322nd District Court is shackled from proceeding due to Cooper \nL. Carter\u2019s failure to prosecute.  \niii. The Petitioner is shackled from his home, his children\u2019s daily lives, and his place of business under facially void orders  that claim \nconsent . \niv.
