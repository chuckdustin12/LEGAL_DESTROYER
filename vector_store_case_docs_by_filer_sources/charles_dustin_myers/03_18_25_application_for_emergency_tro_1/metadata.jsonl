P\nARTIES AND JURISDICTION\nA.Petitioner  and Next Friend\n1. Charles Dustin Myers (\u201c Petitioner \u201d) is the father of two minor children,\nM.E.M., aged eight, C.R.M., aged five,  (\u201cthe Children\u201d). The Children are under 18 and\nhave no court-appointe d guardian in this matter.

P etitioner  also br ings claims in h is \ni\nndividual  capacity as the Children\u2019s biological father. \n2. Petitioner notes tha t related cause number 322-744263-23, a suit for the\ndissolution of marriage, is procedurally stalled with the Respondent name d in the instant \ncase, Morgan Michelle Myers, being unable to prosecute her case. The current orders in \nthe related divorce matter, reflect facially void orders that claim all parties agree, yet theyCHARLES DUSTIN MYERS,  \n   petitioner and next friend of M.E.M \nand C.R.M., two minor children  \nvs. PETITIONER\u2019S ORIGINAL \nPETITION AND APPLICATION \nFOR EMERGENCY INJUNCTIVE \nRELIEF  \nMORGAN MICHELLE MYERS,  \n   respondent\n\n2 were rendered without the consent of both parties on March 14, 2024. Thus, the orders \nhave no legal effect, and the children have no legally effectuated managing conservator despite being under the court\u2019s continuous jurisdiction. Therefore, Petitioner\u2019s initiation of this suit on behalf of the minor children, M.E.M and C.R.M. as Next Friend to restore their status quo is appropriate and aligns with their best interests, Texas State policy, and the Texas Family Code.  \nB.Respondent  Morgan Michelle Myers\n3.

Morgan may be served with process at 6641 Anne Court, Watauga, \nTexas 76148, which is the matrimonial home.  \nC.Third Party  Defendant Dan Branthoover\n4. Defendant Dan Branthoover is an individual who  resides in Yukon, Oklahoma.\nBranthoover is a relative of Morgan who, as detailed below, assisted her in the wrongful acts against Petitioner  and the Children. Once liability is established, Branthoover is \nsubject to personal jurisdiction in Texas under the Texas long- arm statute because he \ncommitted tortious acts in whole or in part in Texas  that give rise to this suit. \nSpecifically, Branthoover actively aided Morgan\u2019s fraudulent court filings and interference with the Petitioner \u2019s parental rights  in Texas, causing injury in Texas, and \nthus \u201ccommitted a tort in whole or in part in this state\u201d per Tex. Civ. Prac . & Rem. Code \n\u00a7 17.042(2). He may be served pursuant to Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.

The amount in\ncontroversy exceeds the minimum jurisdictional limits of this Court.

Petitioner  further inv okes this \nCourt\u2019s equitable power to remedy fraud on the court and to protect the welfare of minor children. \nE.Venue\n6.Venue is proper in Tarrant County , Texas. The Children reside in Tarrant\nCounty, and Defendant Morgan resides in Tarrant County. Many of the wrongful acts occurred in Tarrant County (including fraudulent filings in the 322nd District Court of Tarrant Count y). Here, a related Suit Affecting the Parent -Child Relationship (the divorce \nand custody proceeding) is pending in Tarrant County (Cause No. 322-744263-23 in the 322nd Judicial District). Filing in this venue serves the interests of justice and efficie ncy. \nF.St\nanding and Capacity\n7.Petitioner , as the Children\u2019s biological father and Next Friend, is authorized to\nbring claims on their behalf . He has a justiciable interest in the custody and well -being \nof the Children. The Children have standing through Petitioner  to seek relief for the\n\n4 harms they have suffered due t o Respondent\u2019s conduct. Petitioner  also has standing on \nbehalf of his children and in his own right to seek redress for the violation of his parental \nrights and the personal damage he sustained  leading to emotional conflict for the children \nand himself. \nII. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\nMorgan Michelle Myers, Respondent and Danielle Kenneth Branthoover, Defendant, are \ncollectively referred to as \u201cDefendants\u201d.  \nG.Summary of the Dispute\n8. This case arises from an unprecedented and unjust separation of a father from\nhis children through fraud and deception upon the courts . On January 16, 2024, the \n322nd District Court of Tarrant County signed an order that ousted Petitioner  from his \nown home and effectively removed him from the Children\u2019s lives . To this day, that \ndrastic removal remains unexplained and unjustified, as it was procured by Defendant \nMorgan\u2019s false filings and has never been meaningfully examined. Petitioner  "}

To this day, that \ndrastic removal remains unexplained and unjustified, as it was procured by Defendant \nMorgan\u2019s false filings and has never been meaningfully examined. Petitioner  was given \nno real o pportunity to be heard before losing daily contact with his Children. Over a year \nhas passed, yet no court has rectified or even addressed the glaring fraud and inconsistencies  underlying the orders that separated a loving father from his kids without \ncause. \nH. Texas Policy Favors Both Parents\u2019 Involvement\n9. From the outset, it must be emphasized that Texas public policy \u201cassure[s] that\nchildren will have frequent and continuing contact with parents who have shown the \nability to act in the best interest of the child.\u201d  (Tex. Fam. Code \u00a7 153.001(a)(1)) . The\n\n5 law further provides that \u201cthe best interest of the child shall always be the primary \nconsideration\u201d  in matters of possession and access (Tex. Fam. Code \u00a7 153.002). \nPetitioner  has always acted in the Children\u2019s best interests, as evidenced by his role as \ntheir primary caregiver and provider prior to court intervention. Yet Defendants\u2019 actions \nhave flipped Texas policy on its head \u2013 rather than frequent contact with both parents, the Children have been limited to one parent\u2019s custody for over a year, with the other parent (Petitioner) effectively erased from their daily lives . This lawsuit seeks to restore the \nstatus quo ante  in line with Texas law and the Children\u2019s best interests.  \nI. Background \u2013 The Marriage and Children\n10.Petitioner  and Respondent Morgan were married for eight years and are the\nparents of two minor Children (ages 6 and 8). Prior to the events in question, Petitioner  \nwas a devoted father and the primary caregiver  to the Children. He was also the \nfamily\u2019s primary breadwinner, ensuring financial stability for the household. The family lived together at their home in Watauga, Texas.

The family lived together at their home in Watauga, Texas. The Children enjoyed a loving relationship with Petitioner , who was deeply involved in their daily routine, care, and \nupbringing. There had been no history of family violence or court intervention during the full scope of the marriage.  \nJ.Morgan\u2019s Sudden Change of Heart and Secret Preparations\n11. In early December 2023, without warning, Morgan informed Petitioner  that\nshe wanted a divorce . Her initial stated reasons were trivial (complaints about how \nPetitioner  talked to her), but soon she began condemning the entire marriage, even \nmemories she once cherished . Unbeknownst to Petitioner  at the time, Morgan was\n\n6 already engaged in extramarital relationships  with at least two individuals outside the \nmarriage: Debbie Price and Damen Kazlauskas . On or around December 12, 2023, \nPetitioner  discovered phone records showing an enormous volume of communication  \n(over 16,500 text messages) between Morgan and these individuals. Confronted with the \nlikely exposure of her infidelity and concerned about its implications, Morgan began frantically plotting to remove Petitioner  from the picture . Her goal, as evidenced by \nher actions, was to lock Petitioner  out of the marital home, isolate him from the \nChildren, and shield her own wrongdoing from scrutiny . \nK. Fraudulent and Ex Parte Court Filings (December 2023)\n12. Between December 14 and December 22, 2023, Morgan \u2013 with active help from\nDefendant Branthoover \u2013 made a series of rushed court filings  in the 322nd District \nCourt designed to obtain an upper hand through deceit . These filings were calculated to \nportray Petitioner  as an absent or dangerous spouse and to deprive him of notice or a \nchance to defend himself . In rapid succession, Morgan filed: \n\u2022a.

Exhibit 1\n13.\nPetitioner  had not even been served or informed, and there was no agreement  \u2013\nthis was a ploy to mislead the court into quicker relief. \n\u2022b. Affidavit of Inability to Pay Court Costs (Pauper\u2019s Oath):  On December 18,\n2023, Morgan filed an affidavit claiming she was indigent and unable to afford the\n\n7 ~$400 filing fee for the divorce, asserting that she had only $20 to her name and \nthat the Children \u201crelied solely on her income\u201d. Exhibit 2  \n14.This statement was a knowing falsehood . In truth, Petitioner  was the primary\nfinancial provider for the family, and Morgan had access to substantial funds. In fact, just days before, on December 16, 2023, Morgan (with Branthoover\u2019s guidance) transferred $1,576.00 in joint marital funds into a new personal bank account under her control  \nusing Branthoover\u2019s PayPal as a method to obscure her banking information. Morgan admitted in text messages with Branthoover that she moved these funds, and bank records later confirmed it . Thus, at the time she swore she was penni less, she was in possession \nof significant community assets. She also grossly misrepresented her expenses in that affidavit \u2013 claiming she alone paid the mortgage/rent and car loans \u2013 when in fact Petitioner  had been paying those bills  and continued to pay them. (Notably, one of the \nvehicles Petitioner  was paying for has been repossessed by the dealer due to financial \nhardship.) These glaring contradictions  in Morgan\u2019s pauper\u2019s affidavit demonstrate \nperjury and fraud upon the court.

Exhibit 3 . \nMorgan\u2019 s divorce case should never have even been docketed without fees, given her deceit . \n\u2022c. Original Petition for Divorce with Inconsistent Allegations:  Also on\nDecember 18, 2023, Morgan filed an Original Petition for Divorce. In it, shemade convoluted and contradictory statements regarding a protective order.\nShe alleged that she had applied for a protective order on December 14 that was\u201cundecided,\u201d yet simultaneously claimed an \u201cactive\u201d protective order finding\n\n8 family violence was in place (apparently to invoke a 60-day waiting period waiver \nfor divorce). Exhibit 4  \n15. Both cannot be true; this inconsistency should have been a red flag. Furthermore,\nif an active protective order truly existed, Texas law (Tex. Fam. Code \u00a7 6.405(b)) required Morgan to attach a copy of it to her petition . She attached no such order, \nbecause none existed \u2013 the \u201cactive\u201d protective order was a fiction . In short, Morgan was \ntelling the court whatever was convenient at the moment, truth be damned. \n\u2022d. Application for Protective Order (Second Attempt):  On December 22, 2023,\nMorgan filed yet another request \u2013 an Application for a Protective Order \u2013 in the322nd District Court. Exhibit 5\n16.This wa s perplexi ng, since just four days earlier she had implied she already ha d a\nprotective order. The second application underscores tha t Morgan was \u201cbent on  \namas\nsing m ultiple orders\u201d against Petitioner without justification.

This directly contradicts her sworn claims  \nthat she needed protection from Petitioner.  Exhibit 5.1\nL.\nBranthoover\u2019s Involvement\n\n9 17. Defendant Branthoover (Morgan\u2019s relative) played a pivotal role in this\nscheme. Immediately after Morgan\u2019s first filing on Dec. 14, she traveled to Yukon, \nOklahoma \u2013 Branthoover\u2019s location \u2013 where he \u201cassisted her in preparing subsequent filings designed to achieve the very result we see today \u2014Respondent\u2019s abrupt \nremoval from his home.\u201d. Branthoover\u2019s assistance is confirmed by his own admissions via text and is the basis of a pending lawsuit against him in Oklahoma for his role in this fraud . Exhibit 6 In essence, Branthoover acted as a co -conspirator, helping Morgan craft \nand present false evidence to Texas courts. He had actual knowledge  of Morgan\u2019s plans \nand the falsehoods in her filings, yet actively furthered them. Under Texas law, one who aids or assists in the interference with another\u2019s possessory rights in a child is jointly liable  for the damages caused (Tex. Fam. Code \u00a7 42.003). Branthoover\u2019s liability in this \naction flows from his knowing aid in Morgan\u2019s tortious conduct. \nM.\u201cAgreed\u201d Temporary Orders\n18. Making matters worse, Morgan\u2019s counsel allegedly retained on the spot\ndrafted \u201cTemporary O rders\u201d following the January 22  reset in related case 322- 744263-\n23, which purported to memorialize an agreement or hearing that never truly occurred \nand is not found within the docket sheet.

Indee d, the only signature on the Temporary\n\n10 Orders is Morgan\u2019s and her counsel\u2019s ; Petitioner \u2019s signature is absent. The orders also \nreference a motion that was never served  on Petitioner . This is clear procedural \nirregularity. These \u201cagreed\u201d Temporary Orders, entered on false pretenses, gave Morgan \ntemporary custody of the Children and possession of the home, while barring Petitioner  \nfrom both. By any measure, such orders \u2013 obtained without notice, without a genuine hearing, and predicated on false statements of agreement \u2013 lack validity . They are void \nab initio and cannot stand as a barrier to the relief Petitioner  seeks here. Morgan\u2019s misuse \nof the court\u2019s processes to rubber- stamp an unjust arrangement is part and parcel of her \ntortious conduct. \nN.Morgan\u2019s Abdication of the Truth and Procedure\n20. After securing the Temporary Orders, Morgan and her attorney effectively\nwent dark and stonewalled the litigation . They refused to participate in discovery , \nignored deposition notices, and generally failed to prosecute the divorce on the merits. \nTellingly, neither Morgan nor her counsel has ever filed any substantive response to Petitioner \u2019s numerous sworn allegations of fraud in the pending case .

The impact of Defendants\u2019 actions has been devastating and continues to\nworsen. Petitioner  lost his family, his home, and even his livelihood  as a direct result of \nthe fraudulent orders. Being evicted from his home without notice not only separated him \nfrom the Children, but also disrupted his business/employment, causing severe financial strain. The family\u2019s previously stable finances have been thrown into chaos. Petitioner  \nhas incurred substantial expenses fighting these false accusations and attempting to reunite with his Children. He has suffered extreme emotional distress, detailed further below, from the traumatic loss of his role as father and daily caregiver. \n22.The Children  have likewise suffered immensely. They went from having a\nloving father present each day to suddenly no contact at all , effectively overnight. This \nabrupt, unexplained loss of a parent\u2019s daily presence has caused the Children profound confusion, anxiety, and emotional pain. They were too young to understand why their father vanished from their lives. Family members (including Morgan\u2019s own relatives) have struggled to explain the situation to the Children, because the truth \u2013 that it was al l \nbased on lies \u2013 was concealed. Instead, the Children have been left with the impression that their father \u201cwent away\u201d or did something wrong, which is untrue and damaging to their mental well-being. The Children have essentially been deprived of a parent\u2019s love, guidance, and support for over a year  through no fault of their own.M"}

The Children now see this stranger more often than their own \nfather .\n\n12 23. This is exactly the kind of harmful disruption in a child\u2019s life that Texas law\nseeks to prevent. Texas law prioritizes frequent, meaningful contact between children \nand both parents , yet the Children\u2019s reality is the opposite. As the Texas Supreme Court \nhas recognized, children depend on \u201cthe positive benefits flowing from parental love, affection, protection, emotional support, services, companionship, care, and society\u201d from both parents . Defendants have callously stripped the Children of these benefit s from \nPetitioner . \n24. In sum, Morgan\u2019s fraudulent actions, aided by Branthoover, have caused\nunprecedented and ongoing harm . Petitioner  was the primary caregiver  and a fit, \nloving parent. There was no legitimate reason to remove him. Yet due to Defendants\u2019 tortious conduct, the Children have effectively lost a parent for over a year , and \nPetitioner  has lost irreplaceable time with his kids. This is a human tragedy as much as a \nlegal wrong. The facts are largely undisputed \u2013 Morgan has never rebutted the evidence of her lies  \u2013 and the need for relief is urgent. Every day that passes is another day of \nchildhood the Children can never get back with their father. \n25.

CAUSES OF ACTION\nCount 1: Tortious Interference with Parental Rights (Interference with \nPossessory Interest in a Child)\n\n13 26.Interference with Possessory Rights:  Petitioner  incorporates the facts above.\nTexas law expressly forbids one parent (or any person) from wrongfully depriving \nanother parent of his court-ordered possessory rights with respect to a child. Under Texas Family Code \u00a7 42.002, \u201ca person who takes or retains possession of a child or who conceals the whereabouts of a child in violation of a possessory right of another person may be liable for damages to that person.\u201d \n27. A \u201cpossessory right\u201d defined in the Family Code includes a court -ordered\nright of possession or access, as well as a parent\u2019s natural and statutory rights absent a valid court order to the contrary. Here, Petitioner  had possessory rights to his Children \nboth as a matter of law (being their father with equal rights during the marriage) and under any prior court understanding. Defendants intentionally interfered with and violated Petitioner \u2019s possessory rights by orchestrating and enforcing a situation in \nwhich Petitioner  has been excluded from the Children\u2019s lives. \n28.Morgan\u2019s Direct Interference:  Morgan took and retained sole possession of\nthe Children at a time when Petitioner  was entitled to joint possession and access on \nMarch 6\nth, 2024, Morgan acted without lawful excuse  in keeping the Children away \nfrom Petitioner  by locking him out of his own house. She violated the fundamental \npossessory right of Petitioner  to have access to his Children. Each day that she refused to \nproduce the Children to Petitioner , she was in ongoing violation of Petitioner \u2019s rights . \nNota bly, Texas law makes it a crime to knowingly violate a custody order or to keep \nchildren away from a legal custodian (Tex.

He helped draft the false pleadings that led to Petitioner \u2019s removal . He had \nactual notice  that Petitioner  had rights to possession of the Children and knew that the \nintended result of the filings was to cut off those rights. Thus, Branthoover is jointly liable for the tortious interference with Petitioner \u2019s parental rights and custody. \n30.Elements and Malice:  Defendants\u2019 conduct was willful and intentional.\nMorgan\u2019s objective from the moment she realized her infidelity might be exposed was to willfully deprive Petitioner  of possession of the Children to protect herself . She \npursued multiple legal actions not to address any real danger or harm, but as \u201cstrategic maneuvers to lock in \u2018temporary\u2019 orders\u201d ensuring Petitioner \u2019s removal  \nSuch acts were inherently malicious and without justification. Petitioner  was entitled to \nbe with his Children \u2013 instead, Defendants\u2019 actions wrongfully divested him of that entitlement . \n31.Damages (Count 1):  As a direct result of this tortious interference, Petitioner\nhas suffered damages in an amount within the jurisdictional limits of the Court.

Texas Family Code \u00a7  42.006 specifically allows recovery of mental suffering and \nanguish  for violation of possessory rights, all of which Petitioner  has experienced. These \nlosses are ongoing and increasing as the interference continues. \n32.Furthermore, Defendants acted with malice  and intent to harm Petitioner ,\nwarranting the imposition of exemplary (punitive) damages  under Tex. Fam. Code \n\u00a7 42.006(b) and Chapter 41 of the Civil Practice & Remedies Code. Defendants\u2019 conduct\nwas outrageous, deliberate, and undertaken with conscious disregard for Petitioner \u2019s \nparental rights and the Children\u2019s wellbeing. Petitioner  seeks exemplary damages  to \npunish and deter such egregious misconduct. \nCount 2: Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress  \n33.Petitioner  incorporates all prior paragraphs.

It \u201cgoes beyond all possible\n\n16 bounds of decency\u201d  and is utterly intolerable in a civilized community. Texas courts \nhave recognized that behavior calculated to destroy the bond between parent and child \ncan be outrageous. Morgan lied under oath repeatedly  (alleging nonexistent abuse, \npoverty, etc.), exploited the trust of the court , and effectively kidnapped the Children \nunder color of law . She did so with malice aforethought, aiming to cause Petitioner  the \nmaximum emotional pain \u2013 the loss of his children \u2013 as punishment for uncovering her affair . Branthoover, in turn, facilitated this scheme with knowing disregard of the harm it \nwould inflict. It is hard to conceive of a more cruel and emotionally abusive act than to falsely portray a parent as dangerous and remove his children from him without cause.

Thus, she acted with at least  reckless disregard for the near certainty of\n\n17 severe emotional harm to Petitioner . Branthoover likewise knew that helping Morgan \nperpetrate this fraud would cause Petitioner  great anguish; any reasonable person would \nrecognize that outcome as the obvious consequence of these actions. Proceeding in the \nface of that knowledge is the epitome of recklessness.  \n37.Severe Emotional Distress:  As a direct result of Defendants\u2019 outrageous\nactions, Petitioner  has suffered severe emotional distress . The distress is ongoing and \nhas manifested in depression, anxiety, humiliation, and despair. Petitioner  has \nexperienced sleeplessness, loss of appetite, and a profound sense of injustice and grief. He has been deprived of the joys of watching his children grow  \u2013 their birthdays, \nholidays, and everyday moments have been lost to him, causing an emotional void that cannot be quantified. The trauma of being falsely painted as a danger and seeing his \nchildren turned against him  has caused Petitioner  mental pain far beyond what any \nperson should bear. This distress has substantially disrupted Petitioner \u2019s daily life and \nability to function. He has required counseling/therapy to cope, and even that is insufficient to fully address the harm. The severity of Petitioner \u2019s emotional suffering \nmeets and exceeds the standard required under Texas law (which demands a high degree of mental pain and distress that is more than mere worry, anxiety, or anger). Here, Petitioner\u2019s entire familial world was unraveled maliciously \u2013 a truly catastrophic emotional injury.  \n38.No Alternative Remedy:  Petitioner  acknowledges that IIED is a \u201cgap -filler\u201d\ntort under Texas law, meant to supplement other causes of action when the co"}

To the extent any of Defendants\u2019 conduct might be deemed outside the scope of the interference\n\n18 tort or other claims, Petitioner  pleads IIED in the alternative. The emotional devastation \ninflicted on Petitioner  stems not only from the interference with custody (Count 1) but \nalso from the cumulative effect of the lies, betrayal, and abuse of process . Should the \ncourt find that any aspect of Defendants\u2019 conduct (for example, the defamatory \nimplications of false abuse allegations, or the misuse of legal process) is not fully remedied by another tort, IIED should apply to ensure Petitioner  is made whole. In any \nevent, Defendants\u2019 conduct is so egregious that public policy would allow an IIED claim to proceed. \n39. Damages (Count 2):  For this Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress,\nPetitioner  seeks to recover all damages allowable by law. This includes compensation \nfor past and future mental anguish, emotional pain and suffering, loss of enjoyment of life, and any physical symptoms or illness resulting from the severe stress. No cap on damages applies to intentional torts of this nature, and Petitioner  will ask the trier of fact \nto award a sum that reflects the enormity of the harm (in an amount far in excess of the minimum jurisdictional limits). Petitioner  also seeks punitive damages  on the IIED \nclaim, as Defendants acted willfully, maliciously, and with conscious disregard of Petitioner \u2019s rights. The Court should send a strong message that such outrageous abuse of \na parent and the court system will not be tolerated. \nCount 3: Deprivation of Support and Parental Consortium (On Behalf of the \nChildren)  \n40.Petitioner  incorporates the preceding paragraphs.

Texas law recognizes that children have a right to the \u201cpositive benefits flowing \nfrom parental love, affection, protection, emotional support, services, companionship, care, and society\u201d of their parents.  \nDepriving a child of a parent\u2019s support and companionship is a grave injury to the child. \nHere, Defendants\u2019 actions intentionally deprived the Children of the support, nurture, and companionship of their father , Petitioner . This includes both emotional support \n(parental consortium) and financial support  that Petitioner  would have provided. \n41.Intentional Deprivation:  Morgan knew that by removing Petitioner  from the\nhome and blocking all contact, she was also depriving the Children of their father\u2019s presence and support . She proceeded in spite of that, placing her own interests above \nthe Children\u2019s emotional needs. Such conduct evidences a \u201cprofound disregard for her children\u2019s needs.\u201d  Indeed, Morgan was so consumed with maintaining her fraudulent \nnarrative and pursuing extramarital relationships that she willfully ignored the harm to the Chi ldren .  \n42.

In Texas, a child is entitled to recover for loss of parental consortium when a parent is seriously injured by a third party\u2019s tort.\n\n20 43. Defendants\u2019 intentional acts inflicted a different kind of injury on Petitioner\n(reputational and relational rather than physical), but the end result for the Children is \nthe same : they have been bereft of their father\u2019s daily love, guidance, and care . The \nlaw should not countenance a situation where a tortfeasor escapes liability simply because the harm was achieved through abuse of legal process rather than physical injury. \n44.Emotional and Developmental Harm:  As detailed, the Children have\nexperienced emotional turmoil, confusion, and grief from the sudden loss of Petitioner \u2019s \ninvolvement . They have been denied the comfort of his love, bedtime stories, help with \nhomework, coaching at sports, and countless other forms of parental support that were \npart of their lives. This deprivation has likely caused lasting psychological harm, \nmanifesting in anxiety, behavioral changes, and academic impacts. They have effectively lost the  daily affection and guidance of their father , a loss that courts have recognized \nas compensable in tort when caused by wrongdoing. Additionally, by undermining Petitioner \u2019s ability to provide, Defendants have also jeopardized the Children\u2019s financial \nsupport. Petitioner , as the primary earner, would have used his income for the Children\u2019s \nbenefit \u2013 providing them a stable home, educational opportunities, and necessities. When Morgan ousted Petitioner  and commandeered the finances under false pretenses, the \nChildren\u2019s financial security was damaged.

This includes compensation for their mental anguish, emotional pain, and \nloss of  enjoyment of life during their formative years without their father . Even at their \nyoung ages, the Children have deeply felt the loss \u2013 crying for their father , asking why he \nis gone , and exhibiting signs of emotional trauma . These none conomic damages are \ninherently difficult to quantif y, but Texas law entrusts the jury to assign a monetary value\n\n22 to such losses, and courts have allowed recovery for a child\u2019s loss of a parent\u2019s \ncompanionshi p and society whe n caused by a defendant\u2019s tort.  \n48. Additionall y, to the extent the Children suffered any economic harm (such as \nloss of financial support or trust funds diminished by Defendants), they seek recovery of \nthose amounts as well. \n49. The Children also seek exemplary damages against Defendants for this\nclaim. Intentionally inflicting harm on minor children by robbing them of a parent is \nreprehensible. Morgan\u2019s actions violated her fundamental duty as a parent to act in her \nchildren\u2019s best interests, instead of using  them as l everage in he r deceit . Punitive damages \nare warranted to punish Defendants and deter others from similar conduct. \nIV. REQUEST FOR IMMEDIATE INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\n50.

No amount of money \ncan restore lost childhood moments or erase the trauma of prolonged separation. Thus, \nonly injunctive relief can prevent ongoing irreparable injury  by restoring the status quo.\n\n23 51.Likelihood of Success on the Merits:  Petitioner  has made a strong prima\nfacie showing of his case. Defendants\u2019 fraud and misconduct are essentially undisputed \n\u2013 Morgan has never denied the core factual allegations, and the documentary evidence(texts, bank records, court filings) overwhelmingly supports Petitioner\u2019s claims . \nPetitioner  has already presented much of this evidence to various courts without any \nrebuttal from Morgan. In essence, Petitioner\u2019s evidence stands unchallenged , and it \ndemonstrates that the current custody arrangement was obtained by fraud and is contrary to law . Given this, Petitioner  is exceedingly likely to prevail on the merits of his tort \nclaims and ultimately have the prior orders set aside.  \n52.Imminent, Irreparable Harm:  The harm to be enjoined is the continued\nseparation of the Children from Petitioner \u2019s custody and care , and any further acts by \nDefendants to interfere or conceal the Children. This harm is imminent and ongoing \u2013 every moment of continued separation is harm occurring in real time. It is irreparable because once passed, time with one\u2019s children cannot be recovered or adequately compensated. The Children are growing and changing; Petitioner  is missing milestones \nthat will never  repeat. Additionally, the Children\u2019s emotional well-being is at stake \u2013 \nprolonging the separation risks permanently damaging their relationship with Petitioner  \nand their trust in their parents and the l"}

Additionally, the Children\u2019s emotional well-being is at stake \u2013 \nprolonging the separation risks permanently damaging their relationship with Petitioner  \nand their trust in their parents and the legal system. Texas courts recognize that the parent -child relationship is unique and irreplaceable , and its unjust interruption \nconstitutes irreparable injury as a matter of law .  \n53. If injunctive relief is denied and Defendants are later found liable, it will be\ncold comfort to have a judgment for damages when the Children\u2019s childhood has already\n\n24 elapsed. The urgency is underscored by the fact that over a year has already been lost ; \nthe Court must act now to prevent further harm. \n54. No Adequate Remedy at Law:  Petitioner  has no adequate remedy at law for\nthe injuries described. While Petitioner  does seek monetary damages, those alone will not \nmake him or the Children whole. The law does not favor substituting dollars for parents. \nOnly the return of the Children to Petitioner \u2019s custody/possession  and the cessation of \nDefendants\u2019 interference can truly restore the status quo and serve the Children\u2019s best interests. The ongoing divorce proceeding has proven inadequate to promptly address the issue \u2013 despite Petitioner \u2019s diligent efforts, the family court has not provided timely relief\n. Thus, equita ble relief is necessary here and now.  \n55.Balance of Equities and Public Interest:  The balance of equities strongly\nfavors Petitioner  and the Children. Granting the TRO/injunction merely restores what \nshould never have been taken \u2013 a father\u2019s presence in his kids\u2019 lives \u2013 and aligns the situation with the truth (that Petitioner  poses no danger). Denying relief would reward \nfraud and allow an innocent family to suffer further. Defendants cannot claim any legitimate interest in continuing to enforce a fraudulent status quo.

Morgan may argue she w ill be inconvenienced or upset by losing sole possession, but any such \u201charm\u201d is \nself-inflicted by her misconduct and is far outweighed by the harm to the Children of \ncontinued separation. Moreover, it is in the public interest  to reunite the Children with \nPetitioner . Texas\u2019s public policy  (Tex. Fam. Code \u00a7 153.001) is to ensure children have \nfrequent contact with parents who act in their best interests ; \u2013 here, Petitioner  \nunquestionably is such a parent, and nothing suggests otherwise. The public also has an interest in deterring litigants from abusing court processes through false claims ;\n\n25 granting injunctive relief sends a message that the court will not a bide orders built on \nfraud.  \n56. Finall y, a TRO and injunction  will promote s tability f or the Children: rather \nthan the current limbo, they will have both parents available, which is presumptively \nbetter for them (and even for Morgan, who ca n also see the Children, as the goal is to \nensure both parents share time). \n 57. Requested Injunctiv e Relief: Therefore, Petitioner respectfully requests that \nthe Court enter a TRO immediately and, after notice and hearing, a temporary \ninjunction, ordering the following relief: \n\u2022a. Immediate Custody/Access:  Morgan Michelle Myers shall immediately\nsurrender the Children to Petitioner \u2019s custody . Petitioner  shall be restored to\npossession of the Children and the marital residence at 6641 Anne Court,\nWatauga, TX, forthwith. In the alternative, the Court should at least grantPetitioner  immediate and unsupervised access to the Children  on a frequent\nschedule (e.g. joint or alternating custody) pending further orders.

They shall not remove the Children from Tarrant County without Courtpermission, shall not conceal or hide the Children\u2019s location, and shall not takeany action to prevent or hinder the contact between Petitioner  and the Children.\n\n26 \u2022c. Suspension of Prior Orders:  To the extent necessary, the Court should\nsuspend the operation of the March 14 , 2024 \u201cTemporary Orders\u201d or any\nother orders  that currently limit Petitioner \u2019s access to the Children as they are\nfacially void ab initio. The Court has authority to do so because those orders were\nobtained by fraud, lack the consent of both parties, and have never served the bestinterests of the Children. The injunction should clarify that Morgan may notenforce any prior order to exclude Petitio ner from the home or children, and that\nthis Court\u2019s injunctive order supersedes any conflicting provision, and that thePetitioner\u2019s custody and access to the residence are explicitly restored pendingtrial on the merits.\n\u2022d. Preservation of Evidence:  Defendants should be enjoined from destroying or\naltering any documents, communications, or evidence relating to the matters inthis suit (including electronic evidence like text messages, emails, social mediaposts, bank records, etc.), to ensure a fair trial on the merits.
