The Respondent, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS prays the Court will\ntake swift action and intends to demonstrate through his actions how these orders suit the best interests of the children in this case.  \nH.

The P\netitioner appeared before this Court on December 14, 2023,\nrequesting an ex-p arte temporary order of protection, and subsequently filed a \nprotective order on December 22, 2023. The Respondent contends that the \nP\netitioner's narrative is an attempt to avoid accountability for her extramarital \naffairs\n which was discovered just prior to the initiation of her pleadings. \nii.While the Petitioner engaged in activities outside the marriage, the\nRespondent remained at home caring for the children. During the time the \nPetitioner pursued legal actions shortly before Christmas, the Respondent was \npreparing for the children's holiday. Since taking residence in the family home, \nt\nhe Petitioner has reportedly moved in her sister, reduced her employment to \nt\nhree hours per day, failed to complete the court-o rdered parenting course, and is \nnot contributing rent to her grandmother.
