On one hand, he \nmust seek mandamus relief respectfully compelling this Court to fulfill its\n\n3 \n ministerial duty to hear and rule on Petitioner\u2019s properly file d emergency TRO , \nwhich this Court refused to hear on March 28, 2025. The refusal came not from any \ndefect in the filing itself, but solely from representations made by opposing counsel \nregarding a future filing in another  court which she abandoned\u2014a procedural \nsleight of hand that has left children in distress and a father without an adequate \nremedy for an appeal.  \nOn the other hand, the Petitioner must prohibit the 322nd District Court from \nsetting a matter for a hearing that cannot bear a valid result through a concurrent \nWrit of Prohibition. The proper procedure wasn\u2019t followed, and cannot be \noverlooked in the face of an emergency.  \n In essence, a procedurally improper forward- looking consolidation motion \nto be filed in a different court was used to block a properly filed emergency TRO \nbefore this court.

STATEMENT OF FACTS  \n1. On January 24, 2025, after more than 11 months of inaction, Petitioner  \nfiled a Motion to  Dismiss for Want of Prosecution. The divorce case no \nsubstantive action from Respondent  since April 2024, a legal ghost ship drifting \nwithout direction or purpose. That motion wasn\u2019t attempted to be set for hearing until September of 2024, only after the Petitioner exhausted all efforts seeking relief throughout the Texas Judiciary without any participation from the opposing side. \n2.

On March 19, 2025, driven by mounting concerns about the  children\u2019s \nwelfare and learning that the 322\nnd District Court did not have continuous, \nexclusive jurisdiction over the children in this matter , Petitioner  filed a new\n\n5 \n SAPCR in this Court (Cause No. 233- 765358- 25) seeking emergency  relief for \nthe children. The very next day, March 20, 2025, Ms. Carter suddenly reappeared \nlike a character presumed missing  in the second act, filing an answer  to the \nSAPCR petition in this Court and thereby submitting to this Court\u2019s  jurisdiction \nby filing a response rather than a motion to abate.  \n3. On March 21, 2025, Petitioner  filed a verified Rule 12 motion \nchallenging Ms. Carter\u2019s  authority to represent Respondent in this matter \u2014the \nsecond such challenge,  met with the same resounding silence as the first.  \n4. On March 25, 2025, Petitioner  filed an Objection to Consolidation and \nan Ex -Parte Emergency Motion for TRO. Two days later, on March 27, 2025, \nPetitioner contacted the court coordinator, requested a date and time to present the \nmotion, and served the documents to the opposing party with the intent to present on March 28, 2025, at 9:00 A.M. before the Associate Judge of this Court.  On that \nfateful morning of March 28, 2025, Petitioner  drove to the courthouse, paid for  \nparking, met with the coordinator, communicated with opposing counsel, and secured a hearing date of April 10, 2025. Petitioner  then proceeded to the \nAssociate Judge\u2019s courtroom to present the TRO.  \n5. Before Petitioner  could present his  case\u2014before he  could speak a single \nword about  his children\u2019s welfare\u2014he  was told that Ms. Carter would be filing a \nmotion to  consolidate in the 322nd District Court, that his  motion was improperly \nbefore  the court, and that the Associate Judge refused to hear the motion.

Ms. Carter wasn\u2019t even present in the  courtroom, yet \nher words carried more weight than Petitioner\u2019s physical presence,  his properly \nfiled papers, and most importantly, the urgent needs of his  children. She stopped \nthe proceedings  with nothing more than word of mouth for the incorrect motion. \nA true showcasing of disregard for the process, and the children.  \n6. On April 2, 2025, Petitioner  filed a Pre -Objection to Motion to \nConsolidate in the 322nd District Court. Ms. Carter\u2019s motion to consolidate wasn\u2019t \nfiled with the 322nd District Court until April 3, 2025 \u2014six days after she used its \nmere possibility to  prevent this Court from hearing Petitioner\u2019s  emergency \nmotion. Her motion disregarded  Petitioner\u2019s  pre-objection entirely, as if it were \ninvisible ink on the page. \n7. On April 4, 2025, unable to acquire a ruling due to Petitioner\u2019s \nobjection, Ms. Carter  attempted to set the motion for a hearing before the 322nd \nDistrict Court. That same day, Petitioner  filed a Pre- Objection to Motion to \nTransfer in this Court, given that  a motion to transfer must come before any \nattempt at consolidation.  Ms. Carter, who had been so urgently concerned about \nconsolidation when it  served to block Petitioner\u2019s  emergency hearing, suddenly \nclaimed to be unavailable until late April\u2014causing significant delays that could \nhave been avoided had this  Court simply heard the motion before it on March 28, \n2025.\n\n7 \n 8. Throughout this period of procedural maneuvering, the  children have \nbeen  subjected to psychological manipulation and medical neglect.

Petitioner  \nhas suffered approximately $110,500 in verifiable financial damages due to being \nlocked out of his  home  and business, and it grows each day. But the  financial toll \npales in comparison to the emotional cost of watching Petitioner\u2019s  children  suffer \nwhile the courts exchange procedural ly incorrect  volleys over his head.  \nIII. ARGUMENT  \nA. The Court's Ministerial Duty  \n9. It is well- established Texas law that a trial court has a ministerial \nduty\u2014not a discretionary duty\u2014to consider and rule upon motions properly filed \nand pending before it. In re Sheppard, 193 S.W.3d 181, 183 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [1st Dist.] 2006, orig. pr oceeding); In re Chavez, 62 S.W.3d 225, 228 (Tex. \nApp.\u2014Amarillo 2001, orig. proceeding). The Texas Supreme Court has consistently held that while a court has discretion in how it rules on a motion, it has no discretion to refuse to rule at all. In re Blake ney, 254 S.W.3d 659, 661 \n(Tex. App.\u2014Texarkana 2008, orig. proceeding) (\"When a motion is properly filed and pending before a trial court, the act of considering and ruling upon that\n\n8 \n motion is a ministerial act, and mandamus may issue to compel the trial judge to \nact.\").  \n10. This principle is not merely a procedural nicety but a fundamental \ncornerstone of our judicial system. When a court refuses to hear a properly filed motion, it effectively denies access to justice itself. As the Texas courts have repeatedly emphasized,  \"A trial court's refusal to rule on a pending motion within \na reasonable amount of time constitutes a clear abuse of discretion.\" In re Bonds, \n57 S.W.3d 456, 457 (Tex. App.\u2014San Antonio 2001, orig. proceeding). This abuse is magnified exponentially when the motion concerns the welfare "}

App.\u2014San Antonio 2001, orig. proceeding). This abuse is magnified exponentially when the motion concerns the welfare of children and seeks emergency relief.  \n11. The Court's refusal to hear Petitioner's properly filed emergency TRO \non March 28, 2025, constitutes a clear failure to perform a ministerial duty. This failure is particularly concerning  given that:  \na) The motion was properly filed and noticed for hearing and the parties agreed on a date and time set for April 10\nth, 2025;  \nb) Petitioner communicated with court staff, physically appeared at the courthouse ready to present the motion and was told he could present his motion ; \n    c) The motion concerned the immediate welfare of children; and  \n    d) The refusal was based solely on representations about a future filing in another court that had not yet occurred.\n\n9 \n B. Clear Abuse of Discretion  \n12. A writ of mandamus is appropriate when a trial court clearly abuses its \ndiscretion  and there is no adequate remedy by appeal . In re Prudential Ins. Co. of \nAm., 148 S.W.3d 124, 135- 36 (Tex. 2004); Walker v. Packer, 827 S.W.2d 833, \n840 (Tex. 1992) . An abuse if discretion is clearly established from point one \nbelow, and supported by points two through eight:  \ni. First, it refused to perform its ministerial duty to hear and \nrule on a properly filed motion based solely on representations \nabout a future filing in another court. It\u2019s as if a doctor refused to \ntreat a bleeding patient because another doctor  might, at some \nfuture date, claim the patient should be treated at a different  \nhospital. \nii. Second, it failed to recognize that by answering the \nSAPCR petition in  this Court, Respondent submitted to this \nCourt\u2019s jurisdiction and should have instead filed a motion to abate \nor should have moved to transfer the case. The law doesn\u2019t allow \nfor half- measures of jurisdiction. \niii. Third, it failed to recogni"}

The law doesn\u2019t allow \nfor half- measures of jurisdiction. \niii. Third, it failed to recognize that this Court maintained \njurisdiction until any  transfer was completed pursuant to Texas \nFamily Code \u00a7 155.005( d) as no final order has been rendered in \nthe 322nd District Court. Jurisdiction  isn\u2019t a hot potato to be\n\n10 \n dropped at the first mention of another court \u2014it\u2019s a  solemn \nresponsibility that remains until properly transferred.  \niv. Fourth, it failed to recognize that the proper procedure \nfor consolidation of cases  in different courts requires a motion to \ntransfer to be filed and granted before any motion to consolidate \ncan be considered, pursuant to Texas Family Code \u00a7\u00a7 155.201 and \n6.407. The law provides a sequence, a proper order of operations, \nthat cannot be reversed or circumvented without creating \nprocedural delay, which is what the emergency TRO sought to \nprevent from occurring. \nv. Fifth, it allowed opposing counsel to circumvent proper \nlegal procedure by  influencing this Court\u2019s decision without being \npresent and without having filed any response to the emergency \nTRO  properly before  this Court. It\u2019s as if the referee in a football \ngame made a call  based on what someone in the parking lot said \nmight happen in the fourth quarter  when she had the rules of the \ngame mixed up.  \nvi. Sixth, it failed to consider that the purported \u201cagreed\u201d \norders in the divorce case  are void for lack of consent under \nBurnaman v. Heaton, 240 S.W.2d 288, 291 (Tex. 1951). A void \norder is no order at all \u2014it\u2019s a legal nullity, as insubstantial as a\n\n11 \n shadow on the wall. No court has continuous, exclusive \njurisdiction over the children in this matter.  \nvii. Seventh, it failed to recognize that the Associate \nJudge\u2019s orders in the divorce  case were never properly adopted by \nthe referring District Court as required  by Texas Family Code "}

Seventh, it failed to recognize that the Associate \nJudge\u2019s orders in the divorce  case were never properly adopted by \nthe referring District Court as required  by Texas Family Code \u00a7 \n201.013(b). An unadopted order is like an unsigned check \u2014it may \nlook official, but it carries no legal weight , yet it has been used to \nbar the Petitioner from his residence, business, and children, and \nimpose a disruptive and chaotic schedule upon the children.  \nviii. Eighth, and perhaps most troublingly, it disregarded \nthe children\u2019s best interests  in favor of procedural considerations, \ncontrary to Texas Family Code \u00a7 153.002 and has languished for \nover a year due to the opposition\u2019s failure to prosecute . \n \n12. The law is clear that in matters involving children, their welfare must \nbe the  court\u2019s primary consideration\u2014not procedural niceties, not docket \nmanagement,  and certainly not the convenience of opposing counsel. \nC. No Adequate Remedy by Appeal  \n13. When Justice Delayed Is Justice Denied  Petitioner has no adequate \nremedy by appeal for reasons that should stir the  conscience of any court:  The \nemergency nature of the injunctive relief sought requires immediate action, as\n\n12 \n Petitioner\u2019s children are suffering immediate and ongoing harm while procedural \nissues remain unresolved . In re Texas Dep\u2019t of Family & Protective Servs. , 255 \nS.W.3d 613, 615 (Tex. 2008) (granting emergency relief where children\u2019s welfare was at immediate risk).  Petitioner\u2019s children are being alienated from him,  \ncausing long-term psychological damage that cannot be undone by a favorable ruling months or years in the future. In re Scheller , 325 S.W.3d 640, 643 (Tex. \n2010) (recognizing that interference with the parent -child relationship can \nconstitute irreparable harm).  \n14.

Each  day that passes is another day the children suffer, another day their academic  \nperformance declines, another day they become more emotionally estranged  in a \nsituation that the law should\u2019ve prevented from existing to begin with. \n15. Temporary orders in family law cases are generally not appealable, \nleaving  Petitioner in a procedural trap with no exit. Waiting for a final judgment \nto appeal would allow the improper procedural tactics to succeed, causing irreparable harm to Petitioner and his children. \n16. Void orders are being enforced against Petitioner, causing ongoing \nharm that cannot be adequately remedied by appeal. In re Sw. Bell Tel. Co., 35 \nS.W.3d 602, 605 (Tex. 2000). Petitioner is caught in a procedural echo \nchamber\n\n13 \n with no effective remedy, as both courts  have effectively denied him access to the \njudicial system.

She subsequently filed an improper motion to consolidate in the \n322nd Court  without first filing the required motion to transfer, putting the  \nprocedural cart  before the horse.  She is now claiming unavailability until late \nApril in the 322nd Court, creating unnecessary delay after using the urgency of consolidation to block Petitioner\u2019s  emergency  hearing.\n\n14 \n 19.

This Court should not allow itself to be used as an instrument in such \nprocedural  gamesmanship, particularly when it involves a failure to perform a \nministerial duty required by law and when children\u2019s welfare is at stake.  \nIV. CONCLUSION \n \nThis Court\u2019s refusal to hear Petitioner\u2019s properly filed motion constitutes a  \nfailure to perform a ministerial duty for which there is no adequate remedy  \nby appeal. The proper legal procedure requires a motion to transfer to be  \nfiled and granted before any motion to consolidate can be considered, and by \nanswering the SAPCR petition in this Court, Respondent submitted to this  \nCourt\u2019s jurisdiction. \nThe children who are the subject of this proceeding are suffering \nimmediate and  ongoing harm while procedural issues remain unresolved. Each \nday that passes  without addressing the emergency concerns raised in Petitioner\u2019s \nTRO is a day  of certain  damage to the children\u2019s psychological well -being and \ndevelopment.  \nPetitioner once heard it said that the true measure of a society is found in \nhow it  treats"}

By that measure, the procedural \nlabyrinth that has prevented this Court from hearing Petitioner\u2019s emergency\n\n15 \n motion speaks  volumes about how far we have strayed from the ideal of justice. \nThe children \u2014 innocent, vulnerable, and deserving of the Court\u2019s protection\u2014\nhave instead  become collateral damage in a game of procedural chess.  \nPetitioner provides this petition not out of anger or vindictiveness, but out \nof that quiet, heavy disappointment that settles in a person\u2019s bones when they\u2019ve  \ndone everything by the book only to find the book itself has been shelved away.  \nPetitioner followed the rules. He reiterates that h e honored the procedures . He \nplaced his faith in  a system that promised justice would flow like water, clear a nd \nunobstructed, to those who seek it properly.  \nPetitioner asks this Court to remember that behind every case number, \nbehind every filing, behind every procedural rule, there are  often  real children \nwith real lives  that continue whether the courts act or not. Time doesn\u2019t stop for \nthem while  adults sort out procedural disagreements. They grow, they hurt, they \nform  memories and impressions that will shape them for a lifetime.  \nAs Mark Twain might have observed, the difference between justice \nserved and  justice delayed is the difference between a father\u2019s presence and his \nabsence,  between children thriving and children suffering, between following the \nlaw and  merely gesturing toward it.  \nV.
