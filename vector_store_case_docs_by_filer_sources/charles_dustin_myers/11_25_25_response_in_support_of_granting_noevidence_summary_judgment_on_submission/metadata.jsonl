Unopposed Statement of Facts  \n6. On December 12, 2023, Respondent, Charles Dustin Myers, discovered a significant \nvolume of text messages between Petitioner Morgan Michelle Myers and Damen Gault Kazlauskas, Petitioner\u2019s current boyfriend. See  CMR. p.254-714. \n7. In response to this discovery, the Respondent reached out to the Petitioner\u2019s Grandparents \nwith a request to talk, who admit to being \u201cblindsided\u201d by Petitioner\u2019s sudden desire for a divorce. See CMR. p.716-720. \n8. The following day, on December 13, 2023, the requested family meeting was turned into \na private meeting between the Petitioner and her family members, as evidenced by the Petitioner\u2019s text message sent on December 13, 2023, send at 9:55 P.M. CST. See CMR. p.1715.\n\n3 \n 9. Returning home around 1:30 A.M. CST, the text records show that Petitioner began \ncommunicating via text message with her Stepfather, Daniel Kenneth Branthoover of Yukon, \nOklahoma at approximately 3:29 A.M. CST. See CMR. p.278. \n10. These communications escalated the following day on December 14, 2023, totaling to \nover 90 text messaged exchanged, which is the same day that the Petitioner sought her first ex -\nparte order of protection from this Court. See CMR. p.274-278. See also CMR. p.78 \u00b6 9B. \n11.

See CMR. p.1706. (bank statement showing monetary transfer). See also \nCMR. p.2866. (unanswered request for admissions). See also CMR. p.1715. (text message from \nPetitioner admitting to monetary transfer on December 17, 2023).  \n12. The initial documents submitted to this Court on December 18, 2023, are the Original \nPetition for Divorce ( CMR. p.71-81), a Request for Uncontested Cases form (CMR. p.101-102) \nand an Affidavit of Inability to Afford Court Costs (CMR. p.84-96). \n13.

The Petitioner claimed she could not afford court costs despite admitting to a  \n  monetary transfer of $1,576 the day prior to filing this document. See Unopposed  \n  Statement of Facts \u00b6 11.  \n ii. The Petitioner claimed to be financially responsible for $1,610 in monthly   \n  expenses despite only alleging to make only $744 per month.

The Petitioner claimed to be financially responsible for the 2023 Mazda CX -5 and \n  a 2021 Mazda CX3 which the couple never owned despite this amount exceeding  \n  her alleged monthly income. See CMR. p.93 \u00b6 8. \n15. Finally, Petitioner submitted a Request for Uncontested Cases Form which \nmisrepresented that this matter is uncontested. See CMR. p.102.  \n16. Four days later on December 22, 2023, Petitioner filed for another protective order \ndespite claiming to already have an existing order of protection. See CMR. p.103-109 . \n17. In the application for protective order, Petitioner made the following misrepresentations:  \n i. The Petitioner claimed family violence occurred on December 18, 2023, yet  \n  waited four days to inform the Court despite filing for divorce on that same day.  \n  See CMR. p.108-109. \n ii.

After little communication from Dan Bacalis, Respondent reached out and informed him \nthat he would be terminating his services and shared his feelings regarding the quality of service that was being provided. See CMR. p.819 \u00b6 14. \n23. Despite these concerns, and with no recorded appearances within the case docket, the \nparties appeared on February 1, 2024, where the Respondent was presented with the sole option of a settlement agreement and was given a month back in the home. See CMR. p.229-234. \n(\u2018agreed\u2019 associate judge\u2019s report signed February 1, 2024)  \n24. Respondent \u201c\u2026disagreed with the conditions in the document and advised Mr. Bacalis \nthat he wanted to take it to trial because the petitioner did not have any evidence of family violence.

Therefore, we can gather based on the language that this agreement:  \n  i.  Required Dan Bacalis to prepare the typed written order;  \n  ii. The attorney  reviewing the proposed order would therefore be Cooper L.  \n   Carter, attorney for Petitioner.  \n  iii. If an agreement was not reached, a motion to sign was required to be filed  \n   and set within 30 days of February 1, 2024. \n27.

See CMR. p.221-222. (notice of termination of legal counsel)  \n28. Following his termination, Respondent prepared an EMERGENCY MOTION TO \nRECONSIDER EVIDENCE AND VACATE TEMPORARY ORDERS. See CMR. p.240-243. \nThis was filed alongside a brief and several exhibits that highlighted the Petitioner\u2019s dishonesty. See CMR. p.244-252.

Two days later, while walking the Children to school, Petitioner took it upon herself to \nlock the Respondent out of the marital residence and left a sign on the door.

Respondent Charles Dustin Myers  (\u201cFather\u201d) files this Reply to Petitioner Morgan \nMichelle Myers\u2019s  (\u201cMother\u201d) response to the no-evidence motion for summary judgment. After \nnearly two years of litigation, Mother\u2019s last -minute attempt to avoid summary judgment fails.\n\n11 \n She was required under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 166a(i)  to produce competent evidence \nraising a genuine fact issue on each challenged element of her claims. Instead, she offers only \nconclusory, self-serving assertions (in an affidavit and scattered exhibits) and promises of what she \u201cplans to give at trial,\u201d which do not satisfy her burden. It remains undisputed that Mother \nhas no evidence for the essential elements identified in the motion. Indeed, she ignored written discovery entirely, causing Reque sts for Admission to be deemed admitted by operation of \nlaw. Texas law does not permit a claimant to continue a lawsuit in the absence of evidence.  \n42. Because Mother\u2019s response points to nothing more than a scintilla  of proof  (at best), \nsummary judgment must  be granted as a matter of law.  \n43. Mother\u2019s eleventh -hour allegations of family violence, harassment, and even drug use  \u2013 \nraised for the first time in this response \u2013 are wholly unsubstantiated and suspect. For nearly 22 \nmonths , she produced no  police reports, medical records, witness affidavits, or other evidence to \ncorroborate her sensational claims.

She even withdrew her own protective order application rather than pursuing a finding of family violence in court. Only now, faced with dismissal  of her \ncase, does she submit a self -servin g affidavit that was drafted on March 27, 2025, and a handful \nof text messages in an effort to create a fact issue. The Court should view these belated accusations with extreme skepticism. Unsupported assertions and post hoc allegations cannot defeat a properly supported no-evidence motion. As shown bel ow, Mother\u2019s response contains no \ncompetent evidence on each element specifically challenged in the motion, and her failure to answer discovery leaves her with no factual basis  to avoid summary judgment.  \n44. Finally, Mother\u2019s current live pleadings (her Second Amended Petition for Divorce) \nundermine her own positions. She now pleads for relief that contradicts the very temporary \norders  she asks this Court to keep in place. This inconsistency underscores the lack of merit in\n\n12 \n her claims. In short, Petitioner\u2019s response falls far short of the requirements of Rule 166a(i). The \nCourt should grant summary judgment in Respondent\u2019s favor, dismissing all of Mother\u2019s unsupported claims so that Respondent may return to his home and family life, and his constitutional rights as a father and homeowner may be restored.  \nIV. No-Evidence Summary Judgment Standard s \n45. Under Rule 166a(i), once a no-evidence motion identifies the essential elements where \nno proof exists, the burden shifts to the non-movant to produce \u201cmore than a scintilla of \nevidence\u201d  raising a genuine issue of material fact on each challenged element.

Crucially, \nallegations in pleadings or mere promises of future testimony do not constitute evidence. The non-movant must present actual, admissible proof now \u2013 such as documents, affidavits, or \ndeposition testimony \u2013 to demonstrate a fact issue.

Here, Respondent\u2019s motion was timely filed after an adequate time for discovery and \nspecifically identified the elements lacking evidence. Mother was therefore required to point out \ncompetent summary judgment evidence  for each of those elements. She has not done so. As \ndetailed below, her response relies on speculation and unverified accusations rather than admissible proof. Because Mother failed to meet her burden, Rule 166a(i) mandates that \nsummary judgment be entere d in favor of Respondent.\n\n13 \n V. Mother\u2019s Complete Failure to Present Evidence on Challenged Elements  \n47. Respondent\u2019s motion challenged six essential elements of Mother\u2019s claims on which she \nbears the burden of proof. Mother\u2019s response does not present more than a scintilla of \ncompetent, admissible evidence on any  of these elements:  \ni. No Evidence of Alleged Family Violence:  Mother has produced no credible evidence \nthat any \u201cfamily violence\u201d  (as defined by Texas Family Code \u00a7\u200971.004) ever occurred \nduring the marriage. She alleges an incident on December 18, 2023, but offers nothing to substantiate it beyond her own belated accusations. There are no police reports, medical records, or third -party affidavits  to corroborate any injury or assault. In fact, Mother\u2019s \nown co"}

There are no police reports, medical records, or third -party affidavits  to corroborate any injury or assault. In fact, Mother\u2019s \nown conduct undercuts her claims \u2013 after the alleged December 18 incident, she continued living with Father  and took no immediate action consistent with being an \nabuse victim. When given the opportunity to prove family violence in court, she withdrew her application  for a protective order prior to any hearing. This withdrawal \nspeaks louder than her late -breaking statements. Mother\u2019s new accusations of harassment \nand drug use are likewise unsupported by any evidence (no witness statements, no requested drug tests, nothing) and were never properly raised until now. Unverified allegations in an affidavit  drafted several months ago \u2013 especially after a long silence \u2013 \nare not enough to raise a fact issue. At most, Mother\u2019s affidavit creates only a \u201csurmise \nor suspicion\u201d  of violence, which is legally insufficient. Because she has no competent \nevidence of any family violence, this essential element of her fault -based claims fails as a \nmatter of law.  \nii. No Evidence of an Active Protective Order or Judicial Family -Violence Finding:  \nMother cannot point to any active protective order  in effect, nor any court finding of\n\n14 \n family violence against Respondent  that was in effect at the time of filing this suit . It is \nundisputed that no court ever issued a protective order in this case. Mother did file an \nApplication for Protective Order on December 22, 2023, but she never followed through \n\u2013 the application was withdrawn before any hearing  could be held. Thus, there is no \nsigned Protective Order  in the record, and no judicial finding that family violence \noccurred. Texas law requires a formal hearing and a separate, written order to grant a family -violence protective order (Tex. Fam. Code \u00a7\u00a7\u200985.001, 85.004). Mother has neither. \nIn her response, Mother vaguely"}

Fam. Code \u00a7\u00a7\u200985.001, 85.004). Mother has neither. \nIn her response, Mother vaguely refers to a protective order as if one exists, but this is misleading. There was only a temporary ex parte  order at most (by application) which \nexpired when the February 1, 2024 agreed temporary orders were entered. Since then, no protective order exists . Mother\u2019s inability to produce an actual order or judgment \nrenders any claim or relief predicated on a protective order completely unsupported. In sum, the non-existence of a protective order is an incontrovertible fact that negates Mother\u2019s allegations to the contrary.  \niii. No Evidence of Financial Indigency (False Affidavit of Inability to Pay): Mother also failed to produce evidence that she was genuinely indigent  on the date she filed this \nsuit. In her Original Petition (filed December 18, 2023), Mother submitted a sworn Affidavit of Inability to Pay Costs  claiming extreme financial hardship. However, this \nclaim is conclusively refuted by objective facts  in the record. Just days before filing, on \nDecember 15, 2023, Mother withdrew $1,576 in marital funds  \u2013 funds which she did \nnot disclose in her indigency affidavit. She claimed to have only $21 to her name, yet \nevidence shows she had access to substantial community money. Mother has offered no bank statements, income records, or any financial documents  to support her\n\n15 \n indigency assertion. To the contrary, the available evidence (including her own \ntransactions) shows she had resources and even managed to allegedly  hire private counsel \nshortly after filing. Without any evidence substantiating \u201ctrue indigence,\u201d Mother\u2019s affidavit of inability to pay is proven false .

Texas law provides that a suit filed on a false \nindigency affidavit may be dismissed or sanctions imposed, because the Practice & \nRemedies Code does not tolerate proceeding in forma pauperis under false pretense s. At \nthe very least, the lack of evidence for indigency means Mother cannot carry any burden \ntied to her financial status or claims for relief premised on indigency. This element, too, fails as a matter of law.  \niv. No Evidence that Temporary Orders Were Properly Entered or Valid:  Mother\u2019s \nresponse leans heavily on the Temporary Orders  signed in early 2024, claiming they \nshould remain in effect and are in the children\u2019s best interest. But Mother produces no evidence that those February 1, 2024 temporary orders were obtained with the required due process  or formalities. In fact, the record shows serious irregularities with how those \norders came about. Mother cannot point to any notice or hearing  on her December 27, \n2023, motion for temporary relief that resulted in the February 1 orders , and the case \ndocket shows that the Petitioner\u2019s only appearance in this matter was on January 16, 2024. There is no transcript or reporter\u2019s record  of any evidence presented on \nFebruary 1, 2024. There is not even a file -marked copy of the temporary orders motion \nshowing it was properly served on Respondent in advance. Absent proof that Respondent received due notice and an actual evidentiary hearing was held on February 1, the resulti ng Temporary Orders \u201clack a lawful foundation.\u201d In short, Mother has no \nevidence that the procedural prerequisites (notice, an opportunity to be heard, and a\n\n16 \n hearing on the merits) were satisfied before the court signed those sweeping temporary \norders. This calls into question the validity and enforceability of the orders she seeks to uphold. Moreover, Mother repeatedly refers to the February 1 proceeding as an \u201cAgreed\u201d temporary orders hearing, yet it is undisputed that Respondent never actually a"}

Moreover, Mother repeatedly refers to the February 1 proceeding as an \u201cAgreed\u201d temporary orders hearing, yet it is undisputed that Respondent never actually agreed to \nthe terms  that were later signed. Mother has no evidence \u2013 no signed consent, no email \nacceptance, nothing \u2013 showing that Respondent approved the specific ter ms of the \n\u201cAgreed\u201d Temporary Orders that were entered on March 14, 2024. To the contrary, all evidence indicates Respondent objected  to those terms at every opportunity: the orders \nwere drafted unilaterally by Petitioner\u2019s counsel  and presented to the court without \nRespondent\u2019s signature or consent. The signature line for Respondent on the face of the order is conspicuously blank, confirming he did not sign it. Respondent has provided sworn testimony (in the mandamus record and elsewhere) that he never agre ed and \nvoiced his objections, which stands unchallenged by any evidence from Mother. Thus, Petitioner cannot demonstrate that the temporary orders were the product of a valid agreement or hearing \u2013 an essential underpinning of their legitimacy. In fact, Peti tioner\u2019s \ncounsel, Cooper L. Carter , materially altered and submitted the proposed order after the \nFebruary 1 hearing, without following proper process or obtaining Respondent\u2019s approval , which amounts to a fraud on the court. Respondent promptly filed an \nemergency motion  on February 9, 2024, to alert the Court to these improprieties and to \nvacate the temporary orders, but that motion was effectively brushed aside without any cure for the underlying due process violations  despite receiving no response from the \nopposing side . Mother\u2019s response offers no rebuttal to these facts; she does not deny the \nlack of notice or the ex parte submission of the order.

Any claims premised on the validity of the February 1, 2024 proceedings are unsupported and cannot stand, and are contradicted by the face of the record.  \nv. No Evidence that Temporary Orders Are in the Children\u2019s Best Interest:  Even \nsetting aside the procedural flaws, Mother has no evidence that the content of the current Temporary Orders (which give her exclusive occupancy of the marital home and severely limit Father\u2019s possession of the children) is in the best interest of the children . Under \nTexas law, the \u201cbest interest of the child shall always be the primary consideration\u201d  in \ndetermining conservatorship and access. Tex. Fam. Code \u00a7\u2009153.002. If Mother w ishes to \njustify the highly restrictive temporary orders, she bears the burden to prove those orders benefit the children. Yet she offers nothing  of the sort. There is no expert testimony or \nevaluation from a mental health professional supporting Mother\u2019s position. There are no statements from the children\u2019s teachers or doctors , no school or medical records \nindicating the children are better off under the current temporary arrangement. In fact, Mother disobeyed a court -ordered parenting course (which was me ant to help the \nchildren cope with the family situation), demonstrating a disregard for the children\u2019s best interests. By contrast, Respondent has continually asserted that removing the children from their father and home has been harmful to them, and Mother\u2019s own evidence inadvertently supports Respondent\u2019s concerns. For example, in one of the text/email exhibits attached to her response, Father poignantly points out that one daughter was coming to his house in distress (asking for a diaper at nearly 7 yea rs old) and that the girls \nhave been prevented from even speaking with their father\u2019s"}

Rather \nthan contradict Respondent, these communications corroborate that the current situation \nis unhealthy for the children and was imposed without proper basis. Mother has simply \nno evidence to affirmatively show that keeping Father out of the home and on a \nsupervised or restricted schedule is in the children\u2019s best interest. All she offers is  the \nrefrain that \u201cbest interest\u201d is paramount (which is true) and her own speculation that her \ncustody demands should be litigated. Speculation is not evidence. Because Mother has not met her burden to produce evidence that the temporary orders\u2019 onerous t erms benefit \nthe children, this element likewise yields to summary judgment. The Court should not allow baseless temporary orders to continue when they lack evidentiary support and, in fact, appear to be hurting the children more than helping.  \nvi. No Evidence that Respondent Violated Court Orders in Any Material Way:  In an \neffort to smear Respondent, Mother\u2019s response accuses him of various violations  of court \norders and bad acts (harassment via messages, etc.), but again she roffers no concrete evidence of any meaningful violation . The record reflects that Respondent, though \nunderstandably frustrated by being ousted from his home and limited in access to his children, largely complied  with the temporary orders to avoid further conflict.

He expresses\n\n19 anguish at how the orders are being used as a sword against him and how he will seek to \nrectify the situation through the legal process. While the tone of these communications is urgent and upset, they do not evidence any threats or violence by Respondent; rather, they show a father reacting to Mother\u2019s bad-faith litigation tactics  and the distress they \ncaused. Mother has presented no evidence that Respondent ever harmed the children or violated any court order in a manner that endangered anyone. There is no contempt order, no enforcement proceeding with findings against Respondent, nothing beyond Mother\u2019s complaints. Minor technical violations (if any) or angry words in communications do not rise to the level of creating a genuine fact issue on any claim in  this case. To defeat \nsummary judgment, Mother needed to present admissible proof  that Respondent \nbreached a legal duty or order in a way that supports a cause of action or her requested relief.

In this case, the deemed admissions effectively negate Mother\u2019s causes of action.\nAlthough the admissions themselves are in the record, a few examples are illustrative (paraphrasing due to their admitted status): Mother has admitted she has no evidence  of physical \nabuse by Respondent; admitted that no protective order was ever issued; admitted that \nRespondent did not breach any court order in a manner harming the children; and admitted that she withdrew funds around the time of filing while cla"}

Burns , 7 S.W.3d 768,  769-\n70 (Tex. App.\u2014Texarkana 1999, pet. denied). The Court is entitled to rely on the deemed admissions as undisputed facts establishing that Mother lacks evidence for her claims. In short, Mother\u2019s discovery defaults have sealed the fate of her case: she has judicially conceded the very points that entitle Respondent to summary judgment.\n\n21 VII.

In one December 2024 \nemail, for instance, Respondent admonishes Mother for \u201chid[ing] behind\u201d the one-sided orders \nwhile failing  to follow  them he rself. H e notes t hat M other was preventing the children from even \nspeaking  to their f amily ( violating  the spirit of  co-parenting) and points out that if Mother insists \non using the orders as a shield, she should at least honor all provisions of those orders.

Far from being off-t opic rants, t hese statements di rectly a lign with R espondent\u2019s l egal \nposition:  that M other misled the court t o gain unf air advantage  and has not  acted in t he children\u2019s \nbest interests. Respondent\u2019s passionate tone is the unde rstandable result of a parent who has been \nunjustly de prived of  his home an d children for an extended period.

Conclusion a nd Prayer\n53. Mother has had ample time and opportunity to develop her case, but chose not to \nparticipate in the d iscovery process. S he has com e up with nothing of  substance. The law is \nclear: w hen a claimant produces no e vidence to s upport es sential e lements of  her claims, \u201cthe \ncourt must grant the motion\u201d for no-e vidence summary judgment. M other\u2019s r esponse falls f ar \nshort of the mark \u2013 it is a compilation of excuses, contradictions , and unproven allegations \ndumped o n the Court at the last m inute. She asks the Court to ignore the rules of evidence and \nprocedure and allow her claims to proceed on mere sympathy or speculation. But Rule 166a(i ) \nwas de signed pr ecisely t o prevent  that s cenario and t o dispose of  baseless cl aims before they \nconsume more time and resources. Courts i n Texas (including in famil y law matters) do not \nhesitate to s ummarily d ismiss cl aims w hen no pr oof supports t hem.  This case is a textbook  \nexample of  one that should b e disposed of  now: Mother\u2019s ext reme allegations  (family vi olence, \netc.) remain unsubstantiated, and every objective indicator i n the record shows there is no \ngenuine fact issue for trial. \n54.

Such a judgment will finally dissolve the improperly obtained temporary orders, \nallowing Respondent to regain access to his home and children. Justice and equity demand this outcome.
