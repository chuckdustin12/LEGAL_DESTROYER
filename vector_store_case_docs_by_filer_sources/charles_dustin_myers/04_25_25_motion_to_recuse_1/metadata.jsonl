The act of \nsetting this case for final trial after sustaining over a year of irreparable harm while \nappellate proceedings remain unresolved is itself an act of partiality warranting \nmandatory recusal pursuant to Tex. R. Civ. P. 18 b(b)(1) and 18b(b)(2) on the \ngrounds that the partiality of the tribunal is reasonably in question, and there is a \nclear personal bias and prejudice exhibited towards the undersigned.  \nI.

(TAB A) However, this flies in the face of three concurrent \nmandamus proceedings pending before the Second Court of Appeals, which \nconcurrently seek redress for 1) the refusal of Hon. Kate Stone to hear a properly filed emergency TRO ( No. 02 -25-00164 -CV), to seek vacatur of the orders issued \nbeyond the court\u2019s jurisdiction by Hon.

Jeff Kaitcer on March 14, 2024 ( No. 02 -25-\n00166- CV), (TAB B)  and to reverse an improper consolidation motion granted sua \nsponte by Hon. Kenneth Newell. (No. 02 -25-00171 -CV) All three mandamus \npetitions are at the en banc rehearing stage, except for cause number 02- 25-00166 -\nCV which was denied per curiam on April 24, 2024 .\n\n6 \n Despite the upcoming setting, the exception pursuant to Tex. R. Civ. P. \n18a(b)(1)(B)(i) applies. The act of scheduling this matter for final trial itself \nconstitutes grounds for recusal by casting doubt upon the tribunal's impartiality. \nThe undersigned cou ld not have anticipated that this final trial setting would \nsuddenly arise amidst ongoing appellate proceedings, especially given that the case has remained inactive since September of 2024.  \nSignificantly, the opposing party has only recently re -engaged with the case \nafter emergency relief was requested by the undersigned in the 233rd District Court due to the continuing harm inflicted upon him and his children by these unresolved issues. Thus, this abrupt effort to proceed with final trial under the prevailing \ncircumstances starkly demonstrates judicial bias, further reinforcing the necessity \nof recusal at this juncture . \nII. PRIOR RECUSAL  \nThe undersigned must also note that this marks the second recusal motion \nfiled in this case, the first occurring on October 7, 2024, which  was denied on \nNovember 7, 2024, by visiting retiring Justice Gabriel.

PROCEDURE  \n The correct procedural framework required in these proceedings, particularly \nconsidering the irregular handling of prior matters, must be restated here:  \nFirst , pursuant to Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a(e)(1), \u201c\u2026the clerk of the court must \nimmediately deliver a copy to the respondent judge and to the presiding judge of \nthe administrative judicial region in which the court is located.\u201d Therefore, the \nundersigned formally objects to any handling from the court coordinator \nregarding these proceedings. In the prior matter there were amended referrals, \nmodified pleadings , and an otherwise straightforward process became ambiguous.  \n(TAB F) \nSecond, pursuant to Id. 18a(e)(2): \u201c[w]hen a respondent judge signs and \nfiles an order of recusal or referral, the clerk of the court must immediately deliver \na copy to the regional presiding judge.\u201d The same applies  here as to point one. No \ndisrespect is intended; this assertion is made solely insofar as the governing statute \nconfers no such authority to court coordinators.\n\n8 \n  Third , pursuant to Id.  18a(g)(6)(C), the undersigned respectfully requests \nthat this matter be set for hearing by telephone at the earliest practicable time, \nconsidering the undersigned\u2019s current financial hardship and lack of stable \nresidence.  The nature and complexity of the underlying issues are not easily \nreducible to writing, which is precisely why this matter has suffered from \nprolonged procedural silence"}

The nature and complexity of the underlying issues are not easily \nreducible to writing, which is precisely why this matter has suffered from \nprolonged procedural silence rather than meaningful discussion grounded in the record. A telephonic hearing is nece ssary to afford the Court a clearer \nunderstanding of the facts and to ensure due process is meaningfully observed.  \nFourth, should this motion be granted, the undersigned respectfully requests \nthat this case be reassigned to an entirely different judicial district, given that both \nthe 233rd and 322nd District Courts are presided over by judges directly \nimplicated in the proce dural and constitutional irregularities described herein.  \nFifth, if the Honorable Regional Presiding Judge chooses to refer t his \nmotion , the undersigned requests that the alternative language of Id.18a(g)(1 ) be \nexercised so that the motion may be referred to the Chief Justice of the Supreme \nCourt of Texas given the circumstances of this matter, as explained in more detail \nbelow.  \nFinally , pursuant to Id. 18a(f)(1)(A), the undersigned respectfully urges the \nHonorable James B. Munford to voluntarily recuse himself in order to avoid further delay and to restore confidence in the fair and impartial administration of\n\n9 \n justice , or in the alternative , vacate the March 14, 2024 orders for want of \nconsen t, and set cause number #322- 744263 -23 for a pre -trial conference no \nlater than 14- days from the decision,  effectively  rendering moot these recusal \nproceeding.  \nThe persistent and unexplained judicial inaction \u2014particularly in the face of \nrepeated requests for emergency relief \u2014has caused ongoing, irreparable harm to \nthe undersigned and his minor children.

There is no \nlogic in proceeding to final trial in the current circumstance. One party cannot \nunilaterally decide the matter, especially when they remain silent in the face of serious, un -rebutted allegations.   \nIV . GROUNDS FOR RECUSAL  \nA. STANDARD FOR RECUSAL  \nA motion to recuse is the appropriate procedural mechanism to challenge a \njudge\u2019s impartiality. Sanchez v. State , 926 S.W.2d 391, 394 (Tex. App. \u2014El Paso \n1996, pet. ref\u2019d). Under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a(a) , any party may file \na verified motion stating with particularity the grounds upon which the presiding judge should not sit.\n\n10 \n In addition to the statutory bases for recusal, the Due Process Clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment provides an independent constitutional floor: recusal is \nrequired where the probability of actual bias is too high to be constitutionally \ntolerable. Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co. , 556 U.S. 868, 872 (2009) (citing \nWithrow v. Larkin , 421 U.S. 35, 47 (1975)). That standard is met where, under the \ntotality of circumstances, a judge\u2019s continued participation creates an unacceptable \nrisk of bias\u2014whether due to pr ior involvement, one -sided procedures, or \nunchecked discretion applied to the detriment of one party.  \nHere, the cumulative record demonstrates a pattern of prejudice,  one-sided \ndecision -making, and disregard for both procedure and fundamental rights, rising \nwell beyond the constitutional threshold described in Caperton. Recusal is not merely appropriate \u2014it is required , as explained below . \nB. BIAS  \nThe level of bias against the undersigned started on day one . Without any \nfactual basis, without holding an evidentiary hearing, and without eliciting any \ntestimony from the Petitioner, the undersigned was ordered to vacate the residence \nthat same day. (TAB F) No protective order was"}

(TAB F) No protective order was ever issued, no findings of family \nviolence were made, even though Tex. Fam. Code \u00a7\u00a7\u202f83.006 and 85.001 plainly require such findings.\n\n11 \n This decision , even though temporarily, severed the parent -child relationship \nwithout any lawful basis. The Family Code\u2019s strict requirements were ignored. Tex. \nFam. Code \u00a7\u202f83.006(a) permits exclusion of a party from the home only if (1) the \napplicant files an affidavit  describing facts requiring exclusion, and (2) appears at \nthe hearing to testify to  those facts. Section 83.006(b) further requires that the court \nmake three findings: (i) the applicant resides (or recently resided) at the premises, \n(ii) the other party committed family violence within the past 30 days, and (iii) \nthere is a clear and pre sent danger of future family violence.  \nThe only thing before the court were allegations  of family violence, which \nwere never substantiated. Rather, they were leveraged into a settlement agreement that removed the children from their own home  in February of 2024.  (TAB G) A \ncourt cannot sever a parent -child bond on mere allegations . Tex. Fam Code \n153.002.

James Munford\u2019s initial decision to oust a father from his \nown home was unlawful  and instead of explain his decision or support it with legal \nauthority, he has chosen to ignore it and now moves to set the matter for final trial \nin the midst of the undersigned\u2019s attempt to seek relief from a fraudulent consent judgement where only one -half of the parties signature s appear.  (TAB B.10) This is \nnot just prejudicial;  this is such a significant level of deliberate bias that it must be \nreconciled  through recusal . The court cannot just sit on its\u2019 hands and wait for the \nundersigned to exhaust his appeal efforts  after depriving him unlawfully of his core \ninterests  protected by the  \nMoreover, the substantive  aspect of due process was violated. There is a \n\u201cstrong presumption that the best interest of a child is served by remaining with a \nfit parent.\u201d Troxe l v. Granville , 530 U.S. at 68- 69.

In the absence of any evidence or finding that Respondent was \nan unfit or dangerous parent, removing his children from him was an arbitrary \ninfringement on his fundamental liberty interest .

Ex parte Bates , 65 \nS.W.3d 133, 134- 35 (Tex. App. \u2014Amarillo  2001, orig. proceeding).  Other factors \nconsidered in determining whether a reasonable time has passed are the state of  the \ntrial court's docket and other judicial and administrative duties that must be \naddressed.  In re Villarreal,  96 S.W.3d 708, 711 (Tex. App. \u2014Amarillo  2003, orig. \nproceeding).  \nHere, in this matter, the undersigned has dispositive motions on the docket \nthat would afford him the much -needed  relief, yet the court chooses to prioritize \nmotions that favor the opposition.

In In re Conner, 458 S.W.3d 532 (Tex. \n2015) the Texas Supreme Court\u2019s statement that \"conclusive presumption of \nabandonment\" that arises from unexplained delays indicates that judges must \nactively manage their dockets to prevent such delays or ensure that they are \nadequately explained. Here, there is no explanation for t he delays and inaction. The \nopposition has no incentive to move the case forward, as they were awarded on all \ncore issues at the onset of the case \u2013  for reasons yet to be explained.   \nThe only party seeking any form of relief has been the undersigned.  \nAuthorities not only establish judicial responsibility for docket management but \nalso provide examples of judges proactively fulfilling this responsibility rather than\n\n15 \n blaming litigants for delays. The actions of the Galveston County district judges \ndescribed in Armentrout v. Murdock , 779 S.W.2d 119 (Tex. App.  \n1989) and Southern Pacific Transp. Co. v. Stoot , 530 S.W.2d 930 (Tex. \n1975) exemplify this approach. These judges \"recognized this problem, took \nresponsibility for the condition of their dockets, and moved against the troubles of delay\" by instituting systems to ensure timely case progression. This example demonstrates that effective judges take ownership of their dockets rather than \ndeflecting res ponsibility.  \nThe responsibility of judges for docket management is further emphasized \nby the accountability measures in place.  In re Rose , 144 S.W.3d 661 (Tex. \n2004) demonstrates that judges can face disciplinary action for administrative \nmisconduct, including failures related to court management. Judge Ro"}

(TAB H)  \nD. FA VORITISM TOWARD OPPOSING COUNSEL\n\n16 \n The record in this case reveals a sustained pattern of judicial favoritism \ntoward opposing counsel, warranting recusal. In Sun Exploration & Production \nCo. v. Jackson , 783 S.W.2d 202, 204 (Tex. 1989), the Texas Supreme Court \nacknowledged that while individual rulings may not rise to the level of reversible error, an appellate court may nonetheless detect from the record a clear pattern of \nfavoritism that undermines the  appearance of impartiality.  \nRecusal is required where such favoritism would cause a reasonable \nobserver to doubt the judge\u2019s neutrality. Here the level of favoritism is so high that \nthe courts below improperly grant motions sua -sponte without hearings to the \nPetitioner\u2019s benefit, when the same is done to the undersigned to his detriment. As \nthe court explained in Guillen v. Cameron County , No. 13 -16-00682 -CV (Tex. \nApp. \u2014Corpus Christi \u2013Edinburg Nov. 15, 2018, no pet.):  \n\u201cRecusal is appropriate if a reasonable member of the public at large, \nknowing all the facts in the public domain concerning the judge\u2019s conduct, would harbor doubts as to the judge\u2019s impartiality.\u201d  That standard is met here.

A consistent pattern of orders favoring one party while leaving the pro se \nlitigant\u2019s motions unresolved;  \niv.

Imagine that the very person you \nsupported for years  and who benefitted from your success suddenly claims \nfinancial indigence, asserts full responsibility for all expenses, and serves you\u2014at \nChristmas\u2014with allegations designed to remove you from your home, your \nchildren, and your livelihood.  Now imagine this: You built a business from home\u2014\nintentionally, strategically \u2014so that you coul d raise your children and be a present \nfather, not just a provider. You tailored your entire life around being there for them.  \nNow imagine the State \u2014without lawful authority \u2014rips that life away.  No \nhearing. No findings. No emergency. No evidence.  And then the State does \nnothing. It sits on its hands while you fight, alone, for over fifteen months \u2014\npleading for relief, receiving only silence . And the reason? There isn\u2019t one that \ncan be traced to the record, meaning it must be extrajudicial and derived from \nactual bias. There exists no basis for the current orders to remain in effect, yet they \nare. The court chooses to act sua sponte only when it benefits the opposing party.\n\n19 \n In a world where you take the initiative of showing up, ready to defend \nyourself\u2014your family, your home, your rights \u2014only for those rights  to be stripped \naway in the blink of an eye before being afforded the chance to defend yourself. \nNo process. No fairness. No law.   \nIs that how justice works? Is that how a divorce should begin? Because that \nis exactly what happened here . This is more than a denial of due process.

Late\nlast night, I began experiencing severe tooth pain, which has now escalated to significant facial swelling and intense\ndiscomfort. The pain is currently affecting my ability to speak, eat, and focus, making it challenging to fully participate in\ntoday\u2019s proceedings.\nSpecifically, it's my bottom left molar which the nerve is open and exposed causing significant pain.  \nI want to sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, especially given the efforts the court has made to\naccommodate this hearing. Please know that this request is made only out of necessity, and I deeply regret the timing as\nI would prefer to move the case forward.\nThis request comes with a high degree of reluctance given the unexpected technical difficulties experienced last time and\nwould not be making it if it wasn't absolutely necessary.\nThank you all for your understanding and consideration. I am committed to continuing with the hearing at the earliest\npossible opportunity as I am eager to move the case forward.\nI wanted to inform the court as soon as possible out of respect for the courts busy schedule.\nI currently am unable to locate the case on research texas,"}

That petition did not seek exclusive possession of the residence or ask that Respondent \nbe excluded from the home. Shortly thereafter, on December 22, 2023, Pet itioner filed a separate \nApplication for Protective Order  under Title 4 of the Family Code, in which she explicitly \nrequested exclusive possession of the home, removal of Respondent, and child support. The Court consolidated the protective\u2010order case into the divorce case.  \nOn January 16, 2024, the court\u2014without holding an evidentiary hearing or finding family \nviolence\u2014entered Temporary Orders granting Petitioner exclusive possession of the home and primary custody and child support, and requiring Respondent to vacate the res idence that same \nday. No protective order was ever issued and no findings of family violence were made, even though Tex. Fam. Code \u00a7\u00a7\u200983.006 and 85.001 plainly require such findings. In the weeks that followed, the court continued these arrangements and ul timately entered \u201cAgreed\u201d Temporary \nOrders (March 26, 2024) allocating parenting time and support. All of these extreme orders were based solely on Petitioner\u2019s Title 4 application (and allegations of family violence), and no amendments to the pleadings we re ever filed to convert the case into a Title 5 SAPCR. \nRespondent never received any notice or hearing on custody, possession, or support issues under Title 5.  \nII. Legal Standards\nThe trial court\u2019s authority is strictly limited by the statutes and pleadings. It may consider \nonly the claims and relief expressly pleaded by the parties, and must follow the Family Code\u2019s procedures for protective orders and SAPCRs. Subject\u2010matter jurisd iction is a threshold issue: if\n\nthe court acted beyond the law, its orders are void. A plea to the jurisdiction is decided as a \nmatter of law when the relevant facts are "}

Subject\u2010matter jurisd iction is a threshold issue: if\n\nthe court acted beyond the law, its orders are void. A plea to the jurisdiction is decided as a \nmatter of law when the relevant facts are undisputed (see Tex. Dep\u2019t of Parks & Wildlife v. Miranda, 133 S.W.3d 217, 228 (Tex. 2004)). Here, the material jurisdictional facts are not in dispute.  \nIII. Title 4 (Protective Order) Proceedings Cannot Support Custody or Support  \nUnder Texas law, a protective\u2010order proceeding (Title 4) is not  a custody (SAPCR) \nproceeding (Title 5). The San Antonio Court of Appeals recently reaffirmed that without a proper SAPCR petition under Title 5, a court may not award conservatorship, possession, or support. In Rivera v. Figueroa (Tex. App.\u2013San Antonio 2019), the court held that orders issued in a protective\u2010order case cannot support conservatorship or child\u2010support relief unless a Title 5 petition was filed and noticed. Likewise, In re Sheffie ld, 639 S.W.2d 270 (Tex. App.\u2013Dallas \n1982), long held that Title 4 and Title 5 proceedings are jurisdictionally separate: \u201ca court may not grant relief beyond the scope of the protective\u2010order statute without compliance with the SAPCR statutes\u201d (sheffield, 6 39 S.W.2d at 272- 73). Here, Petitioner\u2019s December 22 Title 4 \napplication was never amended or converted into a Title 5 petition. Respondent never waived notice or a hearing on conservatorship/possession issues. The court\u2019s decision to exclude Respondent from the home and divest him of custody on January 16, 2024 therefore had no \njurisdictional basis. In short, \u201c[w]ithout a valid protective order in place, the court lacked \njurisdiction to continue enforcing the extreme relief originally granted\u201d.  \nIV . Statutory Prerequisites for Exclusion and Protective Orders Were Not Met  \nEven if the court treated the relief as a protective\u2010order, the Family Code\u2019s strict \nrequirements were ignored. Tex. Fam. Code \u00a7\u200983.006(a) permits exclusion of a party from the\n\nhome only  if (1) the ap"}

Tex. Fam. Code \u00a7\u200983.006(a) permits exclusion of a party from the\n\nhome only  if (1) the applicant files a sworn affidavit describing facts requiring exclusion, and (2) \nappears at the hearing to testify on those facts. Section 83.006(b) further requires that the court \nmake three findings: (i) the applicant resides (or recently resi ded) at the premises, (ii) the other \nparty committed family violence within the past 30 days, and (iii) there is a clear and present danger of future family violence. Likewise, \u00a7\u200985.001(a) mandates that at the close of a protective\u2010order hearing, the court must explicitly find whether family violence occurred. If so, \nthe court \u201c shall \u201d issue a protective order against the perpetrator. In this case, none of these \nprerequisites were satisfied. Petitioner did file an application and affidavit, but no hearing on January 16 (or thereafter) produced any finding of family violence. The court did not issue a protective order as the statute requires, and instead simply extended the eviction and custody restrictions indefinitely. By failing to hold a hearing, make any family\u2010violence finding, or enter a protective order, the court \u201cbypass[ed] the statutory prerequisites\u201d entirely. Without those statutorily required findings, the January 16 \u201ckick\u2010out\u201d and custody order was outside the court\u2019s \npower. \nV . All Orders Exceeding the Pleadings or Statutory Authority Are Void\nIt is a bedrock rule that a Texas court must confine its rulings to the relief requested by \nthe pleadings and authorized by statute. Any order beyond that scope is void. The Houston First \nCourt of Appeals has stated that \u201c[a]n order purporting to grant relief beyond the pleadings is void ab initio\u201d. In Guillory v. Boykins, 442 S.W.3d 682, 690 (Tex. App.\u2013Houston [1st Dist.] 2014, no pet.), the court held that where a trial court lacks jurisdiction or statutory authorit"}

In Guillory v. Boykins, 442 S.W.3d 682, 690 (Tex. App.\u2013Houston [1st Dist.] 2014, no pet.), the court held that where a trial court lacks jurisdiction or statutory authority to grant the relief, the order is void . Similarly, In re P .M.G., 405 S.W.3d 406, 416\u201317 (Tex. App.\u2013\nTexarkana 2013, no pet.), confirms that orders entered without pleadings or outside statutory scope are null. Here, not only did the protective\u2010order pleadings not include any SAPCR claims,\n\nbut the later \u201cagreed\u201d orders on March 26, 2024 were not signed or even consented to by \nRespondent (violating Tex. R. Civ. P. 11). In short, every custody and exclusion order in this case was \u201cpredicated on a void order\u201d . As th e Second Court of Appeals recognized in In re C.L., 933 \nS.W.2d 402, 405 (Tex. App.\u2013Fort Worth 1996, no writ), an order that is void ab initio \u201ccannot form the basis for any valid subsequent judgment\u201d .  That\u2019s exactly what is happening here. The \ncourt is now moving to finalize fraud, constitutional deprivation, and is trying to finalize its\u2019 original excision of Respondent\u2019s constitutional rights. The court cannot destroy a family and then move to finalize that without a lawful basis, and over orders that are fundamentally void.  \nIV . Violation of Respondent\u2019s Constitutional Rights to Due Process and Family Integrity  \nThe trial court\u2019s actions not only violated statute but also trampled Respondent\u2019s \nfundamental constitutional rights. By evicting the Respondent from his home and effectively separating him from his children with no prior notice or opportunity to be heard , the court \ndeprived him of liberty and property without due process of law. This violates Article I, \u00a7\u200919 of the Texas Constitution  (the \u201cdue course of law\u201d guarantee) and the Fourteenth Amendment to \nthe U.S. Constitution . Now, the court seeks to finalize this fundamental error amidst an ongoing \nappeal, showing a continuous and complete disregard for the Respondent\u2019s rights.  \nA."}

Now, the court seeks to finalize this fundamental error amidst an ongoing \nappeal, showing a continuous and complete disregard for the Respondent\u2019s rights.  \nA. Deprivation of Property Without Due Process  \nThe January 16 order forced Respondent to vacate his own home on the same day it was \nissued. A person\u2019s right to occupy their home is a significant property interest, protected by due process. Yet Respondent was ousted immediately, with no notice that such  relief would be sought \nand no chance to contest the allegations. The Texas Constitution and the 14\nth Amendment both \nforbid the State from depriving any person of property without due process of law. Fuentes v. \nShevin, 407 U.S. 67, 81- 82 (1972) (even tempo rary, non- final deprivations of property require\n\nnotice and hearing absent extraordinary circumstances). While Texas law does allow ex parte \norders in truly exigent circumstances, those orders must be narrowly tailored and followed promptly by a full hearing. Here, the statutory requirements for an ex pa rte kick -out were \ndisregarded, and Respondent was left homeless and separated from his belongings based on one -\nsided assertions. This is precisely the kind of state action that due process is meant to guard against.  \nB. Deprivation of Parental Rights Without Due Process  \nEven more critically, the court\u2019s orders infringed Respondent\u2019s fundamental right to \nparent his children, also without due process. A parent\u2019s interest in the care, custody, and control of their children is fundamental . The United States Supreme Court has recognized that \u201cthe \ninterest of parents in the care, custody, and control of their children\u2026is perhaps the oldest of the \nfundamental liberty interests  recognized by this Court.\u201d Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 65 \n(2000) (plurality op.). Likewise, the Texas Supreme Court has affirmed that \u201cthe fundamental right of parents to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and contro"}

Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 65 \n(2000) (plurality op.). Likewise, the Texas Supreme Court has affirmed that \u201cthe fundamental right of parents to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children\u201d is constitutionally protected. In re C.J.C., 603 S.W.3d 804, 811 (Tex. 2020) (citing Troxel , 530 U.S. \nat 66). Governmental interference with this right is subject to strict scrutiny and must be accomplished only with rigorous procedural safeguards.  \nHere, Respondent\u2019s removal from the home effectively altered custody of the children  \nwithout any hearing or finding of unfitness. Respondent went from being an equal managing conservator of the children to having zero possession or access (by virtue of being excluded from the home and the children\u2019s presence) overnight and without notice. This is a profound deprivation of parental rights. As the U.S. Supreme Court held in Stanley v. Illinois , an unwed \nfather could not be presumed unfit and have his children taken without a hearing \u2013 \u201cthe Due\n\nProcess Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires that [a father] be given a hearing on \nhis fitness as a parent before  his children are removed from his custody.\u201d Stanley v. Illinois , 405 \nU.S. 645, 649 (1972) (emphasis added). The State \u201ccannot, consistently with due process, merely presume\u201d  a parent\u2019s unfitness or danger and bypass a hearing; \u201cparental unfitness \nmust be established on the basis of individualized proof\u201d  before a child is taken away. Id. at \n647, 649. Yet in Respondent\u2019s case, the court did exactly what Stanley  forbids \u2013 it presumed the \nnecessity of removing the father, without any adversarial testing of the evidence or finding of actual misconduct and left the determination for later (a hearing that kept getting postponed). This violated Respondent\u2019s procedural due process rights to be heard before  being deprived of \ncustody of his children.  \nMoreover, the substantive  aspect of due process was violated.

There is a \u201cstrong \npresumption that the best interest of a child is served by remaining with a fit parent.\u201d Troxel , \n530 U.S. at 68- 69. The government may not \u201cinfringe on the fundamental right of parents to \nmake child rearing decisions simply because a state judge believes a \u2018better decision\u2019 could be made .\u201d Id.  at 72 (plurality op.). In the absence of any evidence or finding that Respondent \nwas an unfit or dangerous parent, removing his children from him was an arbitrary infringement on his fundamental liberty interest. The orders entered in this case prioritized a one -sided \nallegation over a father\u2019s constitutional rights, in a manner repugnant to both the Texas and U.S. Constitutions. Article I, Section 19 of the Texas Constitution guarantees that no citizen shall be deprived of liberty or property except by the due course of the law of the land  \u2013 here, \nRespondent was deprived of both without the lawful procedures or any adjudication of wrongdoi ng.\n\nIn sum, the process (or lack thereof) employed by the court fell far short of constitutional \nrequirements. This constitutional infirmity is independently sufficient to render the court\u2019s orders \nvoid. A judgment entered in violation of due process is void a nd subject to collateral attack. \nPeralta v. Heights Medical Center, Inc., 485 U.S. 80, 84- 85 (1988) (judgment rendered without \nproper notice violates due process and is void). The proper remedy for a void order that stems from a due process violation is to  declare it a nullity and dismiss any action that cannot proceed \nwithout it.  \nVI.

Under Miranda v. Texas Dept. of Parks & Wildlife , a plea to the \njurisdiction should be granted as a matter of law if the jurisdictional facts are undisputed or uncontroverted by competent evidence. Here, there is no genuine issue that (a) no protective order was issued and no findings of family violence were made, (b) no Title 5 SAPCR notice  of \nhearing exists on the record, or  was ever on file, and (c) all of Petitioner\u2019s requests for home \nexclusion and support were styled under Title 4 and unsupported by any pleaded conservatorship claim. The court cannot \u201cproceed further on the merits\u201d without first resolving these fundamenta l \ndefects. Because these jurisdictional defects are purely legal, a full ev identiary hearing is \nunnecessary \u2013 the Court should rule as a matter of law that it never had authority to enter any of the challenged orders , vacate them accordingly, and allow the status quo to reset. Additionally, \nthe March 14, 2024, orders are a mere extension of the initial orders, which claim consent where consent is not present.
