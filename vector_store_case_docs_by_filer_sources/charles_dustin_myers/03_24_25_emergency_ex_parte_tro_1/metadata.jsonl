The only prior orders affecting the parties were issued in the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County, but those orders are void and of no legal effect.

Under Texas Family Code \u00a7 201.013(b), an associate judge's order does not become final unless and until the referring district court judge signs the order.  \nMoreover, the orders claim that all parties agree to the terms of the order despite \nthe Petitioner's signature being absent. In the prior proceedings (Cause Nos. 322- 744263-\n23 in the 322nd District Court), an associate judge signed a \"temporary\" order on March 14, 2024 that purported to be an agreement between the parties. Critically, no district judge of the 322nd District Court ever signed or adopted that order, as required by law. TEX. FAM. CODE Sec. 201.013. Given this fact, the orders have no legal eff ect and\n\nshould be declared void by this court, or in the alternative, voidable, and vacated without \ndelay. There is effectively no valid court order currently governing the parties' residence or conservatorship rights. This Court may therefore proceed to protect the children's welfare and the parties' rights as justice requires, unimpeded by the defective 322nd District Court order.  \nFurthermore, this court has jurisdiction because the Respondent cannot argue that \nthe related cause number retains dominated jurisdiction. Texas law does allow a court to lose dominant jurisdiction if the party with the first suit proceeded in bad faith or the suit is not actively pursued. Both apply here, as demonstrated below. The first suit was unquestionably brought in bad faith, and the case hasn't been actively pursued for over six months by the opposition, leaving the children in procedural limbo and their needs unaddressed.  \nII.

(these records are voluminous and will be provided at hearing)  \n2. On December 14, 2023, in response to this discovery, the Respondent made \nplans to visit the residence of an individual named DANIEL KENNETH BRANTHOOVER, her stepfather.\n\n3. During this trip, the Respondent withdrew the entirety of funds within the joint \nmarital bank account, totaling $1,576, and transferred the funds to Mr. Branthoover's \nPayPal account, which is reflected in the Petitioner's bank statements as \"dmb575\".  \n4. The Respondent and Mr. Branthoover both admitted this transaction occurred \nvia text message evidence.  \n5. The Petitioner requested the funds be returned on December 16, 2023, and \ninformed Mr. Branthoover of the fund's intent being for the Children's Christmas gifts and household bills related to Petitioner's business operations.  \n6. The intentions of the trip to Mr. Branthoover's residence located in Yukon, \nOklahoma were then made clear in his response when Mr. Branthoover informed the Respondent via text message that \"he would be getting divorced\" and that he \"hope[s] [he] can help with the paperwork.\"  \n7. On December 17, 2023, the Petitioner was served an eviction notice by the \nRespondent's grandmother, which cited a protective order and a divorce as the grounds for eviction. Exhibit 5 \n8. On December 18, 2023, the Petitioner filed for divorce in the 322nd District \nCourt of Tarrant County claiming financial indigency and waived the 60- day waiting \nperiod due to claiming an active protective order was in effect against Petitioner, as well as made the claim that she believed herself or the children would be abused or harassed if any contact info were given to Petitioner.\n\n9.

On January 19, 2024, Petitioner retained Dan Bacalis, a licensed attorney. \n16. On January 22, 2024, after the reset hearing was already supposed to have \nstarted, RESPONDENT retained COOPER L.

IMMEDIATE NEED FOR RELIEF  \n64. Every day that Petitioner remains barred from his home and children inflicts \nirreparable injury on both Petitioner and the children. Irreparable harm means an injury that cannot be adequately compensated for money damages or corrected later. That is exactly the case here.\n\n65. Petitioner is being deprived of the irreplaceable experience of parenting his \nchildren during their formative years. No amount of monetary compensation or later \nvisitation can make up for the lost time, missed milestones, and emotional bonding that has been denied for over a year. Courts have recognized that interference with custodial or visitation rights constitutes irreparable harm, as time lost with one's child is gone forever. The children are likewise losing the benefit of a father's love, guidance, and daily care \u2013 a harm that is unquestionably irreparable. If this wrongful separation continues, the \nr"}

The children are likewise losing the benefit of a father's love, guidance, and daily care \u2013 a harm that is unquestionably irreparable. If this wrongful separation continues, the \nrisk increases that the parent -child bond could be permanently damaged. Reunification \nbecomes harder as more time passes; thus the urgency is extreme.  \n66. The children have been suffering confusion, instability, and emotional distress \ndue to the sudden absence of Petitioner and the drastic changes imposed by Respondent. They went from having both parents in their daily life to seeing only one parent, with no satisfactory explanation. Respondents' insertion of a new father -figure (Mr. Kazlauskas) \nhas exacerbated their confusion and anxiety. This kind of emotional turmoil in young children can lead to long- term psychological issues \u2013 a classic irreparable injury, as the \ncourt cannot later repair the trauma inflicted on a child's sense of security. Restoring Petitioner's presence is needed now to begin healing the damage and to reassure the children that their father has not abandoned them. The more time that passes, the deeper the potential harm to the children's mental health.  \n67. Petitioner's fundamental right to maintain his familial relationship with his \nchildren (protected by the U.S. and Texas Constitutions) is being violated. Such a violation is inherently irreparable. Deprivation of one's home \u2013 being ousted without cause \u2013 is also a profound personal harm for which there is no adequate remedy at law.\n\nPetitioner has effectively been made a stranger to his own family and property based on \nfalse pretenses. If the Court does not act, the Petitioner  will continue to suffer intangible \nharms such as loss of income, anguish, and the erosion of his role as a father, none of which can be quantified or compensated later.  \nIV.

THE RESPONDENT'S MISCONDUCT  \nPerjury and Aggravated Perjury (Tex. Penal Code \u00a7\u00a7 37.02\u2013.03)  \n68. Texas law makes it a crime to make false statements under oath. Perjury \noccurs when a person, with intent to deceive, makes a false statement under oath in a proceeding where an oath is required.  \n69. If the false statement is made in connection with an \"official proceeding\" and \nis material, it becomes Aggravated Perjury, a third -degree felony. In civil cases, \nknowingly submitting false affidavits or testimony can also constitute perjury and be treated as a fraud upon the court. Courts have recognized that false sworn statements in family law matters are serious misconduct, undermining the judicial process and potentially warranting sanctions or even criminal referral (e.g., Skepnek v. Mynatt, 8 S.W.3d 377, 381 (Tex. App. \u2013 El Paso 1999) (attorney sanctioned $30,000 for filing false \naffidavit).  \n70. Here, Respondent swore to multiple false statements under oath, meeting all \nelements of perjury and aggravated perjury. For example:  \nFalse Affidavit of Indigency\n\n71. On December 18, 2023, Respondent filed a sworn \"Affidavit of Inability to \nPay\" court costs, claiming she had only $20 in her bank account. This statement was \nknowingly false. Just two days prior, Respondent had transferred $1,576.00 in marital funds to herself, as confirmed by text messages with her relative (Dan Branthoover) on December 16. She then appeared in court swearing she was penniless and could not afford the $400 filing fee. In that same affidavit, Respondent also lied that she alone paid certain expenses (two car loans and $800 rent plus utilities), when in fact Petitioner had been paying those bills; he continued to pay for the vehicles Respondent claimed to finance on her own. Bank statements and financial records will clearly establish this fact on the merits. Respondent's counsel has never refuted these facts. Thus, Re"}

Bank statements and financial records will clearly establish this fact on the merits. Respondent's counsel has never refuted these facts. Thus, Respondent made multiple false statements under oath, meeting Penal Code \u00a7 37.02. Because these affidavits were filed in court proceedings and were material to the case (securing a fee waiver and influencing the court's actions), they also qualify as aggravated perjury under \n\u00a7 37.03. Each false statement was material to issues before the court (Respondent's financial status and credibility), satisfying the materiality requirement.  \nFalse Statements in Protective Order Filings  \n72. Respondent submitted false sworn statements in her applications for \nprotective orders. Texas Family Code \u00a7 82.009 requires that an application for a temporary ex parte protective order \"contain a detailed description of the facts\" of alleged family violence and be sworn as true by the applicant. Respondent sought an ex parte protective order on or about Dec. 14, 2023, claiming abuse, yet on Dec. 22, 2023, she was photographed laughing and playing with the children alongside Petitioner \u2013 conduct wholly i nconsistent with someone in fear of imminent harm. In fact, that same day, she\n\nhad applied for a second protective order against the Petitioner with similar allegations. \nNo credible evidence of family violence was ever presented in thirteen months of litigation but has been used as a barrier from accessing the home where the Petitioner is needed.  \n73. The contextual evidence of falsity (her normal familial behavior with \nPetitioner the same day she sought Protection) defeated  her sworn claims of \"fear\" or \nviolence and display that they were indeed fabricated. At the very least, her contradictory sworn assertions \u2013 e.g. claiming on Dec. 18 to have an \"active\" protective order based on family violence (to justify a divorce waiver) when in truth none existed \u2013 demonstrate a reckless disrega"}

These false protective order filings were not isolated incidents but part of a \ncalculated strategy to remove Petitioner from the family home and children's lives. The \ntiming of these filings \u2014immediately after the discovery of Respondent's extramarital \nrelationship with Mr. Kazlauskas \u2014reveals their true purpose: not to protect against \ngenuine violence, but to preemptively silence Petitioner and prevent him from exposing Respondent's infidelity and financial misconduct. By falsely claiming fear while simultaneously engaging in normal family activities with Petitioner, Respondent demonstrated the fabricated nature of her allegations.  \n75. The pattern of deception is unmistakable: Respondent drained the family bank \naccount on December 15 -16, filed false indigency claims on December 18, falsely \nclaimed an existing protective order in her divorce petition that same day, then filed yet another protective order application on December 22\u2014all while continuing to interact\n\nnormally with Petitioner at home. This coordinated sequence of events shows a \npremeditated plan to use the legal system as a weapon against Petitioner rather than as the shield of protection it was designed to be.  \nControlling Law  \n76. False testimony or affidavits in a civil proceeding can warrant severe \nconsequences. While the proper remedy for \"intrinsic\" fraud (false statements on issues litigated at trial) is often a new trial or sanctions rather than voiding a judgment, courts do not hesitate to act on clear perjury. Texas courts have inherent authority to address fraud on the court, and criminal prosecution for aggravated perjury is a possibility for egregious \nlies under oath. Indeed, aggravated perjury in court proceedings is a felony punishable by \n2\u201310"}

Indeed, aggravated perjury in court proceedings is a felony punishable by \n2\u201310 years' imprisonment (Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 37.03(b)).  \n77. That is precisely what has occurred in this case, and Respondent should face \nsome consequences for her actions, but Petitioner believes that prolonged incarceration would not be in the best interests of his children, but that some form of legal repercussion is necessary to deter similar behavior in the future. She has made no effort to defend these claims, no effort to prosecute her case, and the Petitioner prays that this court realize the severity of this situation on those effected most: the children.  \nV. BEST INTEREST OF THE CHILDREN  \n78. The Texas Family Code references \"the best interest of the child\" 109 times \nthroughout its text, and throughout the entirety of the code itself \u2013 the word \"always\" only appears once. TEX. FAM. CODE. Sec. 153.002. (The best interest of the child shall\n\nalways be the primary consideration of the court in determining the issues of \nconservatorship and possession of and access to the child.)  \n79. Here, this statutory mandate was grossly violated by the Respondent and her \npurported counsel, who have suddenly become active in the litigation here despite remaining silent for over eight months in the parallel case destined for dismissal.  \n80. Indeed, the instant case reveals a Mother with an agenda to erase the parent \nthe children relied on the most from their lives despite a valid legal reason, and has disregarded their livelihood in the process.  \n81. Respondent's conduct constitutes a blatant violation of the \"best interest\" \nstandard mandated by Texas Family Code \u00a7\u00a7 153.001 and 153.002. Texas law declares it the public policy of this state to assure that children have frequent and continuing contact with parents who act in the child's best interest, to provide a safe and "}

Texas law declares it the public policy of this state to assure that children have frequent and continuing contact with parents who act in the child's best interest, to provide a safe and stable environment \nfor the child, and to encourage both parents to share in raising the child. Moreover, the best interest of the child must always be the court's primary consideration in matters of conservatorship and access. Respondent has flagrantly defied these principles by prioritizing her extramarital relationship with Mr. Damen Kazlauskas over the emotional, psychological, and familial stability of her own children. \nOrchestrated Campaign of Deception at the Family's Expense  \n82. The evidence reveals a disturbing pattern: Respondent orchestrated a \ncomprehensive campaign of deception that sacrificed her children's emotional well -being \nand family stability to pursue her extramarital relationship. This was not a series of isolated incidents but a calculated strategy that unfolded in precise sequence:\n\n83. First, Respondent engaged in an extramarital relationship with Mr. Kazlauskas \n(evidenced by over 6,500 text messages);  \n84. Second, upon discovery of this relationship, she immediately sought \nassistance from Mr. Branthoover to draft legal documents;  \n85. Third, she drained the family's financial resources ($1,576) that were intended \nfor the children's Christmas gifts;  \n86. Fourth, she filed false protective order applications and a fraudulent indigency \naffidavit;  \n87. Fifth, she misrepresented to the court that an active protective order existed \nwhen none did;  \n88. Finally, she used these fraudulent filings to remove Petitioner from the family \nhome and children's lives. \n89. Each step in this sequence was designed not to protect the children but to \nadvance Respondent's personal agenda at their expense. The children have been collateral \ndamage in Respondent's effort to reconstruct her life with Mr. Kazlauskas, who she now publicly acknowledges as "}

Respondent has knowingly misled the minor children about the status of their \nfamily by telling them that she and Petitioner are already divorced, even though the divorce is not final. This deliberate falsehood serves Respondent's personal narrative but\n\nwreaks emotional havoc on the children. They are left in a state of confusion\u2014believing \ntheir family has been permanently fractured when in fact the legal marriage remains intact. By intentionally misrepresenting such a fundamental truth, Respondent has shown a willingness to confuse and emotionally harm her children to justify her own choices, in direct contravention of her duty to prioritize the children's emotional well -being. \nPrioritizing an Extramarital Relationship Over Family  \n91. Compounding the harm, Respondent is openly celebrating a relationship with \nMr. Kazlauskas \u2013 a man with whom she entered an extramarital relationship while still married to Petitioner. She has flaunted this relationship and positioned Mr. Kazlauskas as \na replacement father figure to the children, celebrating milestones with him that should be \nreserved for family. In doing so, Respondent elevates her personal relationship over her children's need for stability and continuity with their real father. This behavior sends the \nchildren a disturbing message: that their father's role in their lives is interchangeable or unimportant. Such a message is detrimental to the children's best interests, as it undermines their sense of security, identity, and trust in their family structure and the close relationship that they have shared with their father"}

Respondent has gone to alarming lengths to minimize and erase Petitioner's \npresence in the children's lives. She has introduced Mr. Kazlauskas to the children as if he were a new parent, while simultaneously telling the children that Petitioner (their father) is no longer in their lives. This calculated act of alienation strikes at the very heart\n\nof Texas public policy, which seeks to ensure children maintain frequent and continuing \ncontact with both parents. \n93. Instead of fostering the father \u2013child relationship, Respondent has deliberately \nattempted to sever it. The children are being taught through Respondent's words and actions that their father has effectively disappeared and been substituted by a stranger, causing profound emotional damage and confusing the children about who their father is. This behavior is not only cruel; it is directly contrary to the children's best interests and Texas's clear directives that children benefit from the love and involvement of both parents.  \n93. The children's current living situation\u2014being raised primarily by elderly \ngreat -grandparents rather than their capable and willing father \u2014further demonstrates \nhow Respondent's personal agenda has superseded the children's needs. Rather than \nallowing Petitioner to fulfill his parental role and provide daily care and support to the children, Respondent has relegated this responsibility to extended family members, depriving the children of their father's presence, guidance, and care during crucial developmental years.  \n94. Respondent's systematic use of false protective orders, perjured testimony, \nand procedural manipulation has created a legal fiction that has kept Petitioner from his children for ov"}

Respondent's systematic use of false protective orders, perjured testimony, \nand procedural manipulation has created a legal fiction that has kept Petitioner from his children for over thirteen months. This separation was not based on any legitimate safety concern or the children's best interests, but solely on Respondent's desire to reconstruct her family unit with Mr. Kazlauskas at the center \u2014effectively erasing Petitioner from the \nchildren's lives to accommodate her new relationship.\n\n95. The harm to the children from this prolonged, unjustified separation from their \nfather cannot be overstated. Research consistently shows that children benefit from the \nactive involvement of both parents, and that unnecessary disruption of the parent -child \nbond can cause lasting psychological damage. By prioritizing her personal relationship over her children's need for both parents, Respondent has demonstrated a fundamental misalignment with the \"best interest\" standard that Texas law demands be the \"primary consideration\" in all matters affecting children.  \n96. Despite the Respondent\u2019s egregious actions, the Petitioner wishes her no ill \nwill as she is the mother of his Children and only seeks an amicable path forward that suits their best interests. As of now, the Children need their father, and this situation engineered by the Respondent shows that her fitness as a parent has been called into question, and her priorities are not in the correct place. Petitioner vows his return to the family home will only bring much needed stability to his children and will be in their best \ninterests for their day -to-day livelihood. \nVI.
