The Respondent was initially informed via email that the exhibits and affidavits  \nhad been filed. However, after the Respondent pointed out discrepancies in file size, the \nexplanation changed to the document being too large. This inconsistency raises concerns \nabout transparency and procedural fairness.  Exhibit B  \n7. As outlined in the Tarrant County FAQ , Respondent's original submission of 20 \nMB was well within the 36 MB limit, and the Respondent followed all proper e -filing \nprocedures. Despite this, the filing was forwarded to the regional judge without the \nexhibits and affidavits and later split into t hree sections due to the supposed size limit \u2014\nyet the documents were never subsequently docketed.  \nIV .
