Respondent OBJECTS to and moves to ST RIKE all evidence attached  to or referenced in \nPetitioner\u2019s summary -judgment response . Petitioner\u2019s exhibits consist of unauthenticated emails, \nscreenshots, text messages, financial documents, and third -party affidavits that were never \nproduced in discovery, are inadmissible hearsay, lack authentication, and fail to meet the \nrequirements of competent summary -judgment evidence. Each category below independently \nrequires exclusion.  \nI. AUTOMATIC EXCLUSION FOR DISCOVERY ABUSE (RULE 193.6) \n2. Evidence not timely disclosed in discovery must be excluded from all proceedings, \nincluding summary judgment, unless the proponent establishes both good cause for the failure \nand absence of unfair surprise or prejudice. This exclusion is mandatory .  \u00a7 \n\u00a7 \n\u00a7 \n\u00a7 \n\u00a7 \n\u00a7 \n\u00a7 \n\u00a7 \n \n 322-744263-23 FILED\nTARRANT COUNTY\n12/1/2025 9:12 AM\nTHOMAS A.

Accordingly, exclusion is automatic and required.  \nII. LACK OF AUTHENTICATION (RULES 901 & 902)  \n4.

LACK OF AUTHENTICATION (RULES 901 & 902)  \n4. Texas Rule of Evidence 901 requires proof that evidence is what its proponent claims. \nMerely attaching documents to a response does not authenticate them.  Screenshots, emails, text \nmessages, and PDFs are not self -authenticating  and require proof of authorship, creation, and \nintegrity.  \nIII. HEARSAY (RULES 801\u2013803)  \n5. Petitioner\u2019s exhibits consist almost entirely of out -of-court statements offered for the \ntruth of the matters asserted . Emails, texts, and unsworn statements are classic hearsay  and \ninadmissible absence  a recognized exception. No exception has been established . Even  alleged \nparty admissions remain inadmissible without proper authentication \u2014which is entirely lacking \nhere.  \nIV . IMPROPER SUMMARY -JUDGMENT EVIDENCE (RULE 166a(f))  \n6. Summary -judgment evidence must be:  \ni. Sworn,  \nii. Based on personal knowledge,  \niii. Contain admissible facts, and  \niv. Show the affiant is competent to testify.\n\n3 \n 7. Unsworn screenshots, unauthenticated documents, and narrative statements are not \ncompetent evidence and cannot be considered . Conclusory, unfounded, or legally defective \naffidavits cannot create a fact issue under any circumstance.  \nV. EFFECT ON NO -EVIDENCE SUMMARY JUDGMENT (RULE 166a(i))  \n8. Once all untimely, unauthenticated, and hearsay materials are struck, Petitioner has \nproduced no competent summary-judgment evidence on any challenged element . Under Rule \n166a(i), the Court must grant Respondent\u2019s no-evidence motion as a matter of law . \nVI. PRESERVATION OF ERROR  \n9. Accordingly, Respondent timely objects to the form, substance, and admissibility of \nPetitioner\u2019s evidence and expressly moves to strike each exhibit in its entirety , thereby \npreserving all error for appellate review. \nVII.
