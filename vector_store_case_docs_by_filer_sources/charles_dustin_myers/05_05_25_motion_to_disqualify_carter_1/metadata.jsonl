INTRODUCTION\n1. Cooper L. Carter was allegedly retained on January 22, 2024, in the lobby of the\ncourtroom minutes before a scheduled reset hearing regarding a protective order originally  filed \non December 22, 2023. This hearing was due to begin in front of Associate Judge Jeff Kaitcer . IN THE INTEREST OF M.E.M., C.R.M., two \nchildren) MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS  \nPetitioner,  \nCHARLES DUSTIN MYERS , MOTION TO DISQUALIFY COUNSEL  \nRespondent.  \n2025 -05-05 \n1322-744263-23 FILED\nTARRANT COUNTY\n5/5/2025 2:55 PM\nTHOMAS A. WILDER\nDISTRICT CLERKM.3120 M.3120\nM.3120 M.3120 M.3120 M.3120\n\nand her initial retainment led to the rescheduli ng of the matter for February 1, 2024. Her \nsignature first appears on the document entitled \u201c322ND FAMILY DISTRICT COURT \nASSOCIATE JUDGE'S REPORT\u201d. This initial pleading signed by Ms. Carter indicates that \nshe was retained in her individual capacity, further reiterated in the FIRST AMENDED \nPETITION FOR DIVORCE, filed on January 30, 2024.  Specifically, she states: \u201cIt was necessary \nfor Petitioner  to secure th e services of Cooper L. Carter, a licensed attorney, to prepare and \nprosecute this suit.\u201d (page 9) \n2. Directly below this statement appears the letterhead MARX, ALTMAN & JOHNSON,  \na law firm operated by RODERICK D. MARX, the founder. To date, Mr. Marx\u2019s signature does \nnot appear on any pleadings filed in this matter. Notably, every pleading filed for the petitioner \nhas been \u201cOn Behalf of Cooper Carter by Roderick Marx.\u201d (page 11, Exhibit 4) In total, after \nfourteen months of litigation, Ms. Carter has had the Amended Petiti"}

AMBIGUITY\n3. When turning to Ms. Carter\u2019s public social media, the ambiguity becomes apparent. On  \nher Facebook page, she claims to be a \u201cFormer Attorney at Marx, Altman & Johnson\u201d.1 On her \nLinkedIn profile, this is reiterated, where she claims to have worked for Mar x, Altman & \nJohnson from December of 2020 until July of 2022, and claims to currently be employed with \nCantey Hangar LLP as well as with \u2018Associate Attorney\u20192. Finally, when viewing her Texas State \nBar profile, she claims to be employed with Mar x Altma n & Johnson, with the last update being \n1 https://www.facebook.com/cooper.carter.94/  \n2 https://www.linkedin.com/in/cooper-c arter-5 01888150/  \n2M.3121 M.3121\nM.3121 M.3121 M.3121 M.3121\n\non November 5th, 2023. It\u2019s important to note that \u201cMarx Altman & Johnson\u201d is not the same as \n\u201cMarx, Altman & Johnson\u201d, the comma being the differentiator. These points were discussed in \nthe Rule 12 Motion to Show Authority filed and served to Ms. Carter on September 20, 2024, which remains unresolved. It\u2019s further concerning that Ms. Carter is unable to file documents herself using the Electronic Filing Manager as required by Rule 21a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, as it is registered under her prior employer\u2019s email address under Cantey Hanger. \nIII. GROUNDS FOR DISQUALIFICATION \n4. A trial court has broad discretion to determine the consequences of professional \nmisconduct. State Bar of Texas v. Kilpatrick , 874 S.W.2d 656, 659 (Tex.1994).

There is a strong \npresumption in favor of a party\u2019s right to counsel of choice, but this presumption can be overridden by considerations relating to the integrity of the judicial process and the fair administration of just ice Gonzalez v. State , 117 S.W.3d 831 (Tex. Crim. App. 2003). If an \nattorney\u2019s dishonesty threatens the fairness of the proceedings or the public\u2019s confidence in the \nlegal system, disqualification may be justified to preserve the integrity of the process.  \n 5. However, disqualification is not automatic upon a finding of dishonesty. The court \nmust find that the conduct has materially affected the proceedings or the rights of the parties. In other words, disqualification is considered a severe remedy and is reserved for cases where lesser sanctions would be inadequate to address the harm or protect the integrity of the proceedings. Courts are also mindful of the potential for disqualification motions to be used as tactical weapons and require a high standard of proof before granting such relief. See Spears v. Fourth Court of Appeals , 797 S.W.2d 654 (Tex. 1990). The courts also consider the severity and \ncircumstances of the misconduct, the harm caused to clients or the profession, and the need to deter future misconduct. See Kilpatrick . In family law matters, where the stakes are often \n3M.3122 M.3122\nM.3122 M.3122 M.3122 M.3122\n\npersonal and the proceedings can be contentious, the court\u2019s primary concern is to ensure \nfairness and the proper administration of justice.   \n6. On May 9th, 2024, Ms. Carter reached out via email correspondence and requested that \nthe Respondent fill out and sign an Income Withholding Order.  After inspection, the Respondent determined that it was defective and requested that the document be corrected. No further correspondence came from Ms. Carter regarding the IWO.  \n7.

A single pleading cannot logically have two different attorneys designated as \u201cAttorney of Record,\u201d nor can one attorney\u2019s handwritten signature be grafted onto \na block naming another attorney. The inconsistencies strongly indicate that the signature block \nwas manually altered or copied between  documents, constituting a likely forgery.  \n8. Furthermore, upon inspection of the Certificate of Service, the font sizes are different, \nand it further points to the real possibility that this document was indeed forged. The timing of the document\u2019s service and the appearance of the signatures themselv es also raise concern. In \nshort, these discrepancies, while by themselves may not seem significant \u2013 when added into the mix of issues within this case \u2013 it answers more questions than it creates.\n \n   \n4M.3123 M.3123\nM.3123 M.3123 M.3123 M.3123\n\nANALYSIS  \nFIGURE 1  \nFIGURE 2  \n9.

This suggests \nthat an attorney\u2019s signature was replicated on two different sets of printed names. Under Texas law, every pleading \u201cshall be signed by at least one attorney of record in his individual name\u201d. See Tex. R. Civ. P. 57. It is improper to list multiple attorneys under a single signature or to designate more than one attorney as the att orney of record.  \nii. Duplicate and Conflicting Names\n11. The name Holly L. Hayes  appears twice in the first block (once in script as the\nsignature and again in print as one of the listed attorneys). In the second block, Holly L. \nHayes appears only as the script signature, while CHOYA BURKLEY is the sole printed name \nwith the title \u201cAttorney of Record.\u201d Thus , one version implies Hayes is attorney of record and \nthe other implies Burkley is. This direct contradiction \u2013 the same signature line paired with two \ndifferent names \u2013 could only happen if the signature was misappropriated. No valid pleading would have one attorney sign their name while identifying another attorney as counsel. \niii. Inconsistent Formatting and Fonts\n12. The mixture of cursive and all-caps text, the placement of underlines, and the\nalignment of titles differ markedly between the two blocks. For example, one shows an ornate underline beneath \u201cHolly L. Hayes\u201d and then a column of names, while the other has a plain signature line and only \u201cCHOYA BURKLEY\u201d below it. These typographical inconsistencies are not found in standard OAG filings. Legitimate Texas OAG child- support pleadings use a single, \nuniform signature block: one typed attorney name (with SBN and contact info) and the title \n6M.3125 M.3125\nM.3125 M.3125 M.3125 M.3125\n\n\u201cAttorney o f Record,\u201d all aligned consistentl y.

Taken together , the two images show a signature block that appears to have been \ncopied or tampered with . The same handwriting is used in both, but the printed names and \n\u201cAttorney of Record\u201d designation do not match. This strongly suggests that an attorney\u2019 s actual \nsignature (Holly Hayes\u2019s) was duplicated ont o a document that falsely names Choya Burkley as \nthe attorne y of record, or vice versa. Such conduct amounts to forgery or impersonation, \nmisleading the court about who is actually representing the state. \nIV. LEGAL STANDARD  \ni. Single Attorney Signature Required (Tex. R. Civ. P. 57)\n14.Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 57 mandates that  \u201cEvery pleading of a party\nrepresented by an attorney shall be signed by at least one attorney of record in his individual \nname, with his State Bar of Texas identification number\u2026\u201d  By its plain terms, an attorney must \npersonally sign pleadings. Listing multiple attorneys under one signature line, or having two different attorneys labeled as counsel on the same document, violates this rule. In a proper signature block, the printed na me next to the SBN must match the person who signed. \nii. One Designated Attorney (Tex. Gov\u2019t Code \u00a7402.029(b))\n15. In child- support cases, the Attorney General must notify the parties of the specific\n\u201cassistant attorney general who is the attorney of record in the case\u201d. This statute assumes only one attorney-of- record at a time. The conflicting blocks here \u2013 one identifying Hayes and the \nother identifying Burkley as attorney-of-record \u2013 directly contravene this requirement. They \nfalsely present two different individuals as the State\u2019s attorney of record in the same case, which is impossible under \u00a7402.029. \n7M.3126 M.3126\nM.3126 M.3126 M.3126 M.3126\n\niii.

Standard OAG Practice\n16.The OAG\u2019s usual practice is to have a single attorney\u2019s name and signature per\npleading, with all contact information in one consistent block. Attorneys do not co-sign a single \ndocument by listing a group of names; rather , if multiple lawyers work on a case they each f ile \nseparate notices or  appearanc e forms. The aberrant f ormat shown i n the images has never be en \nused in valid OAG submissions. \n17. Becaus e Texas law a nd OAG p rocedur e require a single attorney of  record t o sign \npleadings in his or her own name, the above anomalies strongly suggest fraud. If Ms . Hayes did \nnot actuall y sign on behalf of M s. Burkley (or vice versa), then the signature block i s a \nfabrication: a signature was copied and paire d with a false printed name . This unde rmines the \nintegrity o f the pleading  and violates the  attorney -signature rules. See Te x. R. Ci v. P. 57. See also \nTex. Gov\u2019t. Code 402.029. \nV. STANDARD FOR DISQUALIFICATION  \n18. Texas courts regard a motion to disqualify counsel as an \u201cextraordinary remedy\u201d that \nshould be granted onl y for \u201ccompelling reasons.\u201d Disqualificati on impinges on a litigant\u2019s right \nto chosen counsel, so courts apply an \u201cexacti ng standard\u201d before ordering. As our Supreme Court \nexplained in In re Sande rs, 153 S. W.3d 54, 57 ( Tex. 2004), quoting Spears v. Fourt h Court , 797 \nS.W.2d 654, 656 ( Tex. 1990), \u201c[m]ere allegations of unethical conduct or evidence showing a \nremote pos sibility of  a violation  of the di sciplinary rul es will not suffice\u201d to di squalify a n \nattorne y. \n19. Nonetheless, where true misconduct has occurred \u2013 e specially misconduct directly  \naffecting the integrity of the proceeding \u2013 courts will act.

The moving \nparty bears the heavy burden of proving disqualification is warranted . Id. Respondent readily \nmeets that burden here, given Carter\u2019s admitted violations of the Rules. \n20. In disqualification motions, Texas courts consider all relevant rules: the Texas Rules \nof Civil Procedure, statutory provisions, and the Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct. Under Tex. R. Civ. P. 13, an attorney\u2019s  signature certifies that the pleading is not \ngroundless or filed for any improper purpose. Rule 13 further provides that making \u201cstatements in pleading which [the signer] know[s] to be ... false, for the purpose of securing a delay\u201d is contemptible. Similarly, Rule 57 requires eac h attorney- of-record to sign pleadings with their \nown name and bar number. Violation of these procedural rules subjects the offending attorney to sanction. Tex. R. Civ. P. 215 authorizes a court to punish contempt or sanction parties for misconduct. Additi onally, courts have inherent authority to enforce ethical standards: the Texas \nSupreme Court has instructed that trial judges have a duty \u201cto regulate the legal profession when \nappropriate via the Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct,\u201d which ar e a \u201cpreeminent \nsource for attorney disqualification\u201d even though the Rules themselves are not. \niv. Carter\u2019s actions warranting disqualification \n21. Under the Disciplinary Rules, Carter\u2019s actions are manifestly prohibited.

See \nIn re Meador , 968 S.W.2d 346, 351 (Tex. 1998) (noting that \"lawyers must be held to the highest \nstandards of honesty and candor when dealing with the courts\").  \nAdditionally, Ms. Carter\u2019s failure to appear at the March 14 hearing, failure to respond to \nchallenges, her repeated use of defective or unauthorized signature blocks, and failure to comply \nwith Rule 57 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, collectively e vidence a pattern of \nmisconduct that is not merely negligent \u2014 it is willful, strategic, and fundamentally \nprejudicial . Courts have long held that when counsel's conduct \"taints the trial,\" disqualification \nis not only permitted \u2014 it is required. In re Sanders, 153 S.W.3d 54, 57 (Tex. 2004); Spears v. Fourth Ct. of Appeals , 797 S.W.2d 654, 656 (Tex. 1990). \nUnder Rule 13  of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure , an attorney's signature certifies \nthat pleadings are grounded in fact and law and are not brought for any improper purpose.

Filing knowingly false temporary orders without a Motion to Sign, and misrepresenting an agreement \nnever made, constitutes sanctio nable conduct. See  Nath v. Tex. Children's Hosp., 446 S.W.3d \n355, 361 (Tex. 2014) (reiterating that sanctions are appropriate where pleadings are made in bad \nfaith and lack evidentiary support). \nFurthermore, the potential forgery or misappropriation of the OAG attorney\u2019s signature \nconstitutes a separate and grave violation of Rule 57 and Texas Gov\u2019t Code \u00a7 402.029. Courts have the inherent authority to sanction and disqualify attorneys for forging or misusing names to file official pleadings. State Bar of Tex. v. Kilpatrick , 874 S.W.2d 656, 659 (Tex. 1994); In re \nC.F ., Jr., 141 S.W.3d 907, 913 (Tex. App.\u2014San Antonio 2004, no pet.)

The continued presence of such an attorney in this proceeding actively prejud ices \nRespondent, impairs the integrity of the record, and casts a shadow over every action taken in the case.
