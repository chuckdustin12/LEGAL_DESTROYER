Procedural History of Deprivation  \nSince the inception of these proceedings, each physical appearance made by CHARLES \nMYERS before this Court has resulted in substantial and escalating deprivation of fundamental \nrights:  \n1.

This occurred on January 16, 2024. \n2. Second Appearance:  \nDespite efforts to present meritorious issues, proceedings were delayed , providing no \nmeaningful relief, and prolonging injury to familial and property rights  due to Petitioner, \nMORGAN MYERS, retaining counsel minutes before the scheduled reset for January 22, 2024. \nThird Appearance:  \nCHARLES MYERS  was coerced into signing a purported \"settlement agreement\"  \nunder duress  by his own attorney , without genuine consent, and under threat of further \ndeprivation, leading to his termination and subsequent challenge of the proceedings. This \noccurred on February 1, 2024. \nFourth Appearance:  \nCHARLES MYERS  appeared to challenge the fraudulent settlement ; however, despite \nthe lack of any opposition on record, relief was denied , and CHARLES MYERS was ordered to \nsign an agreement  to which he never lawfully c"}

This occurred on March 14, 2024. \n \nII. Present Circumstances Justifying Non -Appearance \nAt this time, multiple critical matters remain pending, unresolved, or have been unlawfully \ndenied, including:\n\ni. A Rule 12 challenge  to the authority of opposing counsel, leaving the question of proper \nrepresentation unresolved;  \nii. Emergency motions for relief wrongfully denied without evidentiary hearing, findings, \nor adequate process;  \niii. Procedural injuries and prejudice  inflicted upon the parties\u2019 minor child during the \nCourt\u2019s delay and refusal to act, now culminating in physical injury to the child;  \niv. Plea to the Jurisdiction  pending, which deprives the Court of authority to proceed to \nany final trial setting without proper adjudication;  \nv. Motion to Recuse, properly filed pursuant to Rule 18a, which under Texas law mandates suspension of further substantive action pending its resolution. \nGiven the Court's documented pattern of procedural violations , due process deprivations, \nand disregard for objections , any further appearance at this stage by  CHARLES MYERS  \nwould expose him to additional irreparable harm  without meaningful protection.  \n \nIII. Formal Objection and Protest  \nAccordingly, CHARLES MYERS  respectfully objects to any setting of a final trial or other \nsubstantive action until : \ni. The pending Motion to Recuse is heard and ruled upon in accordance with Rule 18a;  \nii. The Plea to the Jurisdiction  is adjudicated;  \niii. The Rule 12 challenge  to opposing counsel's authority is resolved;\n\niv.
