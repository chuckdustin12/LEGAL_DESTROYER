Texas courts have a duty to rule on properly filed motions within a reasonable \ntime  (In re Blakeney, 254 S.W.3d 659 (Tex. App. \u2014Texarkana 2008)).  \nB. Courts cannot ignore motions indefinitely , especially when they remain \nunopposed ( In re Bonds , 57 S.W.3d 456 (Tex. App.\u2014San Antonio 2001)).  \n2. Due Process Violations (14th Amendment, U.S. Constitution; Article I, \u00a7 19, Texas Constitution) \nA. The Court\u2019s refusal to issue rulings or set hearings deprives Respondent of due process rights . \nB. The failure to act on Rule 12 Motion to Show Authority means opposing counsel may be practicing unlawfully , rendering all their filings void. \n3. Failure to Act on Emergency Motions & Summary Judgment\n\n6 \n A. The Court\u2019s inaction on emergency motions for custody and residence  is a \ndirect failure of its duty to prioritize the best interest of children  (Tex. Fam. \nCode \u00a7 153.002). \nB. The Court has no discretion to ignore properly filed summary judgment \nmotions , especially when unopposed (Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(c)). There is  no \ngenuine issue of material fact , and the Respondent is entitled  to relief as a matter \nof law.  \nIII. CONTINUED SILENCE FROM OPPOSING PARTY  DESPITE GLARING MISUSE \nOF THE LEGAL SYSTEM  \n1. The opposing party in this case has refused to prosecute for over four months . \n2. The Petitioner in this case has unquestionably deceived this court into relying on false clai ms of indigency and false claims for protection. \n3. The Respondent has filed over 4,700 pages of documents that have  been ignored \noutright by the court , the opposing party, and court staff.  \n4. The Petitioner continues to neglect the children medically, continues to escape accountability for her egregious actions , and has offered no rebuttal or defense \nagainst any of the claims made against her.  \n5. The Respondent continues to s uffer monetary damages each day this situation \npersists without resolution. \n6. The court has been given ample information to jus"}

The court has been given ample information to justify an immediate ruling as required  by law, yet the Respondent continues to be stonewalled.\n\n7 \n 7. The cur rent temporary orders state all parties agree to the terms of the order, \nreference a hearing not found on the docket sheet, yet  continue to remain in effect \ndespite several pleas for correction being submitted and revie wed by court staff.  \nIV . CONCLUSION \n Respondent reasse rts that Texas Law prevents such sc enarios such as what is occurring in \nthis case from happening, yet it continues unaddressed. Respondent only asks of this court, the \nreviewing staff, and any reviewing judicial officer that Texas law s be followed, and that this \nsituation be immediately corrected . The systemic abuse  faced by the Respondent has damaged \nthe children \u2019s well -being and permitted the Petitioner to continue to get away with her immoral \nactions that have placed fraud upon this court without consequence.  \n Respondent urges this court to make swift , corrective decisions that  are warranted by \nsetting immediately ruling upon the pending motions before it and  granting the long overdue \nrelief that is both necessary a nd justified .  \n \nRespectfully submitted,  \n/s/ Charles Dustin Myers  \nCHARLES DUSTIN MYERS  \nCHUCKDUSTIN12@GMAIL.COM  \n6641 Anne Court, Watauga, Texas 76148  \n817-546-3693  \nPRO SE\n\n8 \n  \nCERTIFICATE OF SERVICE \n \nPursuant to Rule 21 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, Respondent, CHARLES \nDUSTIN MYERS, certifie s that this Notice of C ontinued O bstruction has been filed with the \nelectronic filing manager and served on the parties of record  on this 11th day of March, 2025, \nincluding:  \n \nCOOPER L.
