TEXAS PRESCEDENT  REGARDING RECUSAL \n      1. In Texas, courts operate under a foundational presumption of impartiality. \nHowever, this presumption can be overcome if a movant presents compelling evidence of \nbias that fundamentally threatens due process. The Texas Court of Appeals has emphasized this requirement: bias must be so severe that it denies the movant a fair and impartial hearing. In Interest of E.R.C., 496 S.W.3d 270, 280 (Tex. App. \u2014Texarkana 2016, pet. \ndenied); Ex parte Ellis , 275 S.W.3d 109, 117 (Tex. App. \u2014Austin 2008, no pet.). Simply \nput, due process mandates that all parties are heard by a neutral, detached judge. Brumit v. \nState , 206 S.W.3d 639, 644 -45 (Tex. Crim. App. 2006). This is not just a procedural   \nnecessity ; it\u2019s enshrined in both the U.S. Constitution and the Texas Constitution.  \n2. Texas courts use the \"reasonable person\" test to determine whether recusal is \nappropriate: Would a well- informed, impartial observer reasonably question the judge's \nimpartiality based on the known facts? Hansen v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. , 346 S.W.3d \n769, 776 (Tex. App. \u2014Dallas 2011, no pet.) (quoting Sears v. Olivarez , 28 S.W.3d 611, 615 \n(Tex. App. -Corpus Christi 2000, order) (en banc) (internal quotations and citations \nomitted). If the answer is yes, recusal is warranted. In this case, numerous procedural \nmissteps and decisions have seriously jeopardized the perception of fairness.

Texas precedent, therefore, supports a careful review to uphold the judicial integrity required by law. \n4. Without evidence admitted in this matter, and without any findings on behalf of \nthe tribunal,  the court chose to sever the parent- child relationship for one parent due to \nfalse claims made by another prior to being afforded an opportunity to present his case.\n\n2 II. ARGUMENT  \nThis case exemplifies a serious violation of core due process principles, particularly \nin the failure of the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County as a whole  to substantiate its \nrulings with factual findings or evidentiary support. Such ungrounded decisions have \nresulted in substantial harm, indicating a concerning bias that jeopardizes a fair resolution. \nThis bias has disrupted the parent -child relationship b y unjustly favoring one parent, \ndespite indications that this party has prioritized personal interests over the children\u2019s welfare, while penalizing the other without lawful basis. \nWithout any factual or legal justification for these decisions, the only reasonable \ninference is an underlying bias, likely fueled by either fraudulent pleadings submitted by the Petitioner or an extrajudicial influence not in the record. These circumstances call for \nrecusal to restore impartiality and procedural integrity. The judges\u2019 actions contravene their duties under the Texas Code of Judicial Conduct, disregarding fundamental protections enshrined in both the U.S. Constitution and Texas law. Given these considerations, \nRespondent CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS respectfully requests that the Court grant the Joint Motion to Recuse and, in the interest of judicial economy, issue judgment without a hearing  if the opposing party does not respond by a designated date  deemed appropriate by \nthe court. The Respondent further seeks pre -admission of uncontested evidence relevant to \nthis motion"}

Performing the Duties of Judicial Office Impartially and \nDiligently  \n1. There are three prongs present within Canon 3 of the Texas Rules of Judicial \nConduct. All three prongs, in general, \u201ctake precedence over all the judge's other \nactivities \u201d, and each set forth standards to be followed in during the performance of such \nduties.1 The issue is whether District Judge James Munford and Associate Judge Jeffrey \nKaitcer should be recused. The rules and analysis  of how they were applied in this case \ncan only lead a reasonable fact finder to conclude that their recusal is warranted.  \nA. PRONG 1 \u2013 ADJUDICATIVE DUTIES  \n2. The first prong is the adjudicative standard outlined in Canon 3(B) of the Texas \nCode of Judicial Conduct. Paragraph 2 requires that \u201c[a] judge should be faithful to the \nlaw and shall maintain professional competence in it,\u201d and specifies that \u201c[a] judge s hall \nnot be swayed by partisan interests, public clamor, or fear of criticism.\u201d Additionally, \nParagraph 5 mandates that a judge \u201cperform judicial duties without bias or prejudice,\u201d \nwhile Paragraph 8 ensures that \u201c[a] judge shall accord to every person who has a legal interest in a proceeding, or that person's lawyer, the right to be heard according to law.\u201d \nFurther, Paragraph 9 sets the standard that \u201c[a] judge should dispose of all judicial \nmatters promptly, efficiently and fairly.\u201d  All of these paragraphs are directly relevant and \ncan be applied in  the determination of recusal.  \n \n1 Tex.

Code Jud. Conduct Canon 3(A)\n\n4 B. PRONG 2 \u2013 ADMINISTRATIVE  DUTIES \n 3. Standards for a judge\u2019s administrative responsibilities are outlined under Canon \n3(C) of the Texas Code of Judicial Conduct. Paragraph 1 requires that \u201c[a] judge should \ndiligently and promptly discharge the judge's administrative responsibilities without b ias \nor prejudice, maintain professional competence in judicial administration, and cooperate \nwith other judges and court officials in the administration of court business.\u201d \nAdditionally, paragraph 2 mandates that a judge must ensure that \u201cstaff, court offi cials, \nand others subject to the judge's direction and control observe the standards of fidelity \nand diligence that apply to the judge and refrain from manifesting bias or prejudice in the \nperformance of their official duties.\u201d  These standards are critical to the recusal motion \nbecause they underscore the judge's obligation not only to maintain impartiality in \npersonal actions but also to actively prevent bias or prejudice in all court operations under their oversight.  \nC. PRONG 3 \u2013 DISCIPLINARY  DUTIES  \n4. Canon 3(D) of the Texas Code of Judicial Conduct outlines a judge's \ndisciplinary responsibilities, which directly relate to maintaining the ethical integrity of the judicial process. Paragraph 1 requires that if a judge has clear information that \nanother judge has violated the Code, they must take appropriate action. When the violation raises substantial concerns about the other judge's fitness for office, the judge is \nobligated to inform the State Commission on Judicial Conduct or take other suitable \nmeasures. Similarly, Paragraph 2 mandates that a judge who learns of a lawyer\u2019s serious\n\n5 breach of the Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct \u2014especially one that \nquestions the lawyer\u2019s honesty, trustworthiness, or overall fitness \u2014must repo"}

These disciplinary obligations are highly relevant to the recusal \nmotion. The standards reinforce a judge\u2019s duty to uphold ethical conduct across all roles in the judicial system, ensuring that neither judicial nor legal misconduct goes \nunaddressed. In cases where bias, impropriety, or ethical breaches by a presiding judge \nare evident, the principles in Canon 3(D) underscore the necessity of recusal to protect \nthe integrity of the proceedings and maintain the judiciary's credibility in the  eyes of the \npublic. \n5. Notwithstanding the reasons set forth in the joint motion to recuse, the \nadditional facts explained below show an intentional effort to deprive the Respondent access to justice after he has exhausted all other State remedies , and one needs to look no \nfurther than how the joint recusal motion was handled to highlight this effort  showcasing \nthe appearance of impartiality, which warrants recusal.  \nD. THE TEXAS RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE  \n6.   Pursuant to the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure 18(a)( f), the Respondent judges \nhave two options  once a motion to recuse is filed. 1) the judge  can file with the clerk an \norder of recusal or disqualification, or 2) the judge  can sign and file with the clerk an \norder referring the motion to the regional presiding judge.\n\n6 7. Rather than filing the orders of referral with the clerk of the court, they were\nforwarded from the court coordinator via email, Lindsey Baker, with out the required \ncertificate of service and remain inaccessible through the Texas Supreme Court approved \nelectronic filing manager, re:Search Texas .  \n8.

This fact was promptly pointed out  in Exhibit 1 , where the file size \ndifference can be seen from the email attachments. Click for reference. \n9.Lindsey Baker then confirmed that the exhibits and affidavits had been\nforwarded. The file size difference was then pointed out  in the last correspondence  chain  \nfound within Exhibit 1 , to which an amended order of referral followed, and the reasons \ngiven for the modification of the original motion changed due to the motion\u2019s length , \nthereby justifying the modification of the original motion into three parts. See Exhibit 2 . \nClick for reference.  \n10.Given that the very purpose of re:Search Texas is to streamline the process of\nservice and case management, it raises the question as to why the court would choose to \nutilize the platform up until the joint motion to recuse was filed. Further, the Frequently \nAsked Questions found within the District Clerk\u2019s website for electronic filing \nspecifically reiterate that e xhibits should be merged into one document with the lead \ndocument , and that the file size limit is 35mb. Given that the Respondent\u2019s original joint \nmotion to recuse was well under the maximum size of 35mb, and the joint motion was filed as one document as the clerk prefers \u2013 why was it modified  and served outside of\n\n7 the requirements of Rule 21a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure ? These facts were \nhighlighted in the Respondent\u2019s formal objection filed and served on all parties through \nthe EFM on October 10, 2024, and is attached hereto as Exhibit 3 , and  remains \nundocketed  at the time of filing this motion .

Click \nfor reference. \nE. APPLICATION OF CANON 3 AND REMEDIAL ACTION  \n13. The actions of Judges Munford and Judge Kaitcer demonstrate a clear \nde\nparture from the standards of impartiality and integrity mandated by Canon 3 of the \nTexas Code of Judicial Conduct . The facts before this court reveal a pattern of procedural \ninconsistencies and biased decision -making that stem, in large part, from the Petitioner\u2019s \nmisleading tactics \u2014an influence that these judges have inadvertently allowed to impact \ntheir rulings. Even though such information may have been obtained during the \nproceed ings, that information was kept private and never disclosed or entered into the \nrecord, leaving an appearance of impartiality, which is enough to warrant recusal. See \nRogers v. Bradley , 909 S.W.2d 872, 873 (Tex.1995) (\u201cDeclaration of Recusal\u201d by\n\n8 Gammage, J.) (noting that issue is one of perception). \u201c[B]eyond the demand that a judge \nbe impartial is the requirement that judge appear to be impartial so that no doubts or \nsuspicions exist as to the fairness or integrity of the court.\u201d; see also Sears v. Olivarez , 28 \nS.W.3d 611, 613\u2013 14 (Tex.App. -Corpus Christi 2000, no pet.). The facts outlined above \nraise serious doubts to these requirements. \n14.

Under C anon 3(B) , j udges are required to adjudicate based on impartiality and \nfactual accuracy. However, the judges\u2019 failure to critically assess the Petitioner\u2019s narrative \nof hardship, coupled with improper handling of filings, has resulted in decisions that lack \nfactual support and undermine the Respondent's rights to a fair hearing. This court now \nhas the opportunity to address this lapse by recusing the judges and ensuring the case is \noverseen with genuine impartiality. \n15. Canon 3(C)  underscores the judges' responsibility to administer the court\u2019s \noperations consistently and transparently. The irregular handling of critical filings \u2014\norders forwarded without proper certificates of service, mismanagement within the EFM system, and discrepancies in access \u2014demonstrate a failure in maintaining the procedural \nintegrity essential to a fair process. These administrative oversights have obstructed the \nRespondent\u2019s access to justice, and this court now has both the facts and the authority to \nremedy this. \n16. Finally, Canon 3(D)  obligates this court to take appropriate action if it is \nestablished that a violation has occurred within the code. The Respondent believes  that \nthe violation is merely a  product of relying on fraudulent pleadings  by the Petitioner\n\n9 mixed  with permitting a  likely unauthorized attorney to prosecute the case and  does not \nreflect on either Judge Munford or Judge Kaitcer\u2019s overall fitness for office.  \nF. A CLOSER LOOK AT CANON 3(D)(2)  \n17. A judge who receives information clearly establishing that a lawyer has \ncommitted a violation of the Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct should \ntake appropriate action. \n18. To assist in this determination, notwithstanding the current challenge to Ms. \nCarter\u2019s authority, one needs to look no further than the current temporary orders in \nplace , which is attached as Exhibit I in the original joint motion to recuse filed  on \nOctober 7,"}

On page 1, the orders read: \u201c On February 1, 2024, the Court heard Petitioner's \nmotion for temporary orders.\u201d A review of the record will show that no motion for \ntemporary orders has been served to the Respondent in this matter, no notice of hearing \nwas served to the parties regarding such a motion, and no hearing ever occurred \nregarding this motion.  \n20.

Steve Myers, a witness, was present in the conference room during this \nexchange. Neither party went before the judge on February 1\nst, 2024. See Exhibit  6.\n\n10 21. The agreement, which can be found in Exhibit E in the original joint motion to\nrecuse, had the following provisions at the bottom of page 5 of the agreement:  \n\u201cA typed written Order conforming to this Report will follow within 20 days from \nthe date this Report is signed. The Temporary Order shall be prepared by Dan Bacalis. \nEach attorney should approve the Order. The parties do not need to approve the Order.

These actions threatened the Respondent\u2019s livelihood by removing him from  \nthe residence \nhe needed to provide for his children, as well as from the home where his \nchildren had \nbeen raised with their father.

If the Respondent d id not sign, he would have faced no a lternative other than  \ncontinued  exclusion from his residence and further impairment of his ability to provide \nfor his c\nhildren. This threat was imminent. \n  \n  32. The R espondent\u2019s counsel advised him to sign the agreement instead of  \nproceeding to a hearing, leaving h im without a viable means of protection at that time. \n33. All\n elements of duress were present when the Respondent signed the\nagreement. Judge Kaitcer and Ms. Carter were aware that consent was not p resent when\n\n13 the orders were rendered yet  were entered  regardless. This disregard for procedural \nfairness and apparent partiality underscores the need for recusal.  \n34. Finally, Ms. Carter signed a pleading containing false statements, in violation \nof Rule 4.01(a) of the Texas Rules of Disciplinary Conduct. She claimed that the \nRespondent agreed to the orders, that they were based on a hearing that never occurred, \nand referenced a motion never served t o the Respondent.  This court should address these \nactions in accordance with Canon 3(D)(2) of the Texas Code of Judicial Conduct.  \nG. FINAL THOUGHTS  \n 35. According to Tex. R. Civ. P. 21(d)(a)(1), a \"court proceeding\" includes any \nappearance before the court, such as a hearing or trial. Per Tex. R. Civ. P. 21(a), every \npleading, plea, motion, or application to the court for an order\u2014whether presented as a motion, plea, or other request \u2014must be filed with the court clerk in writing, state the \ngrounds, and be noted on the docket unless presented during a hearing or trial. \n 36. Should this matter proceed to a hearing, the court must adhere to the Texas \nRules of Civil Procedure, including docketing all missing items listed in Exhibit 4 and \nfollowing the service requirements in Rule 21a when scheduling the hearing. Informal \nnotices via email only obscure the opportunity for an appeal and fail to comply with T"}

Informal \nnotices via email only obscure the opportunity for an appeal and fail to comply with Texas Civil Procedure. The court cannot continue to overlook its duty to correct these \noversights, nor can it ignore state laws to uphold decisions lacking any legal justification.\n\n14 37. It is deeply troubling that the Respondent, a self -represented litigant, must \nunderscore basic procedural requirements to ensure adherence to standard rules, while the \nPetitioner\u2019s attorney has repeatedly disregarded these processes by raising baseless \nobjections in proceedings yet remaining silent in the record. This absence of \naccountability raises questions about the attorney\u2019s commitment to ethical standards and procedural integrity, and it is perplexing that any reviewing judge could ignore the \nseverit y of the issues documented in this brief. \n38. It remains unanswered how a citizen of this state can be removed from his \nhome and stripped of custody of his children based solely on unproven accusations by the \nother parent, without the opportunity to defend himself. Our society\u2014and especially our \nchildren \u2014should not be subjected to this level of disregard by elected officials.  \n39. When such actions come from a vindictive parent willing to falsify the ir \nfinancial status and weave a false narrative for protection, the court should take \nappropriate action to prevent such deceptive actions from occurring in the future, and \nshould surely be a factor in determining their fitness as a parent. \nIV . CONCLUSION  \nRecusing Judges Munford and Kaitcer is the first step  to restore the Respondent\u2019s \nrights as all other state remedies have been exhausted. These are essential first steps this \ncourt can now take. These actions will not only uphold Canon 3(D)\u2019s  standards but will \nalso correct procedural injustices, ensuring that the case can proceed in alignment with\n\n15 the high"}

I am above 18 years of age, competent to make this affidavit, and have\npersonal knowledge of the facts stated herein, which are true and correct.\n2.Procedural Violations and Due Process Concerns\nSince the initiation of this case, I have encountered numerous proceduralirregularities that have obstructed my right to a fair hearing. I was removed from\nmy residence and separated from my children on January 16, 2024, based solely\non allegations made by the Petitioner, without any evidentiary findings or anopportunity to defend myself in a formal hearing. This deprivation of my rights\nwas executed without adherence to the foundational principles of due process.\n3.Duress in Signing the February 1, 2024, Agreement\nOn February 1, 2024, I was compelled to sign an agreement that I did not fully\n\n19 understand nor agree w ith. This a greement a llowed m e limited a ccess b ack i nto \nmy re sidence b ut resulted i n the re m oval o f m y c hildren fro m their home. My \ndecision to sign was made under duress, as I was ad vised by my attorney to accept \nthese terms rather than proceed to a hearing . Due to the potential of further \nexclusion\n from my home and livelihood, I felt I had no other viable option to \ns\nafeguard my a bility t o continue p ro viding f o r my c hildren. \n4.Bi\nas and Lack of Impartiality\nI have serious concerns regarding the impartiality of Judges Munford and Kaitcer,\nas the procedural management of this case has shown a consistent disregard for\nmy rights. My filings and objections have been met with resistance and have often\nbeen undocket ed or handled irregularly, while the Petitioner\u2019s pleadings have\nproceeded unchecked, despite containing misleading and unsubs"}

In reality, there was no formal hearing or review of evidence onthat date, and I did not give my consent to the terms as recorded. Furthermore, the\norders assert that necessary legal prerequisites were met, when, in fact, no such\nprocedural steps were observed. These inaccuracies directly impact my rights andthe fairness of these p roceedings.\n\n20 6. Unethical Conduct and Professional Misconduct  \nThe Petitioner\u2019s counsel, Ms. Carter, signed and submitted pleadings containing \nfalse statements, misrepresenting my consent to the orders and claiming that a \nhearing had occurred when it had not. This conduct violates Rule 4.01(a) of the Texas Rules of Disciplinary Conduct and Canon 3(D)(2) of the Texas Code of Judicial Conduct. Such behavior not only misleads the court but also deprives me \nof a fair and just resolution. \n7. Need for Recusal  \nGiven these procedural irregularities, false representations, and lack of impartiality demonstrated by Judges Munford and Kaitcer, I respectfully request their recusal \nfrom this case. Their actions and the management of this case have created an appearance  of partiality, depriving me of my right to due process and casting \ndoubt on the integrity of these proceedings . \n8.

Despite the emails sent to the Respondent from the court coordinator Lindsey \nBaker, there is no official receipt that the correct motion, as filed, was delivered to the \nregional judge  from either respondent.  \n 9. The motion as originally filed was mo dified for reasons that  did not remain \npersistent. The reasoning given related to file size contradicts the FAQ from the Tarrant \nCounty District Clerk. If a separate system is used to forward these files to the Re gional \nJudge, the Respondent respectfully requests that this be clarified given the severity of the \nsituation.  \nCONCLU SION  AND  REQUEST \nGiven the persistent inconsistencies, failure to properly docket the Respondent's \nfilings, and the lack of transparency surrounding the handling of crucial case documents, \nRespondent Charles Dustin Myers  formally objects to the actions of the 322nd District \nCourt and requests immediate correction of the docketing failures. Furthermore, \nRespondent requests validation that the correct motions and accompanying exhibits were \nforwarded to the regional judge  as originally filed . The files officially served to the \nRespondent via eFile do not contain the original joint motion . In light of these ongoing \nprocedural issues, Respondent reserves the right to seek further re"}

The Petitioner appeared before this \nCourt on December 14, 2023,\nrequesting an ex-p arte temporary order of protection, and subsequently filed a \nprotective order on December 22, 2023. The Respondent contends that the \nPetitioner's narrative is\n an attempt to avoid accountability for her extramarital \naffairs which was discovered\n just prior to the initiation of her pleadings. \nii.While the Petitioner engaged in activities outside the marriage, the\nRespondent remained at home caring for the children. During the time the \nPetitioner pursued legal actions shortly before Christmas, the Respondent was \npreparing for the children's holiday.

Vacate the current orders, which were entered in violation of\nthe Respondent's right to due process and a fair hearing. These \norders were rendered as \"agreed\" without the Respondent's \nconsent and are unsupported by any motion that was properly served on him. \n2. Grant the Respondent's motion for temporary orders without\nnotice or hearing to the Petitioner, restoring the status quo for the children and enabling the Respondent to meet his financial obligations  related to the Children  and allow healing to begin.  \n3. Provide a provision allowing the Respondent to return to the\nresidence at where he was \nwrongfully removed  including the option for Petitioner to reside \nthere as well if she so chooses.  \n4.Strike all pleadings from the Respondent other than the Rule 12motion to show authority and the summary judgement motion in\nthe interest of judicial economy .\n5.
