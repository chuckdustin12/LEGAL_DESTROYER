GROUNDS FOR RECUSAL  \n The Regional Presiding Judge has permitted and  recklessly tolerated an ongoing RICO \nEnterprise that continues to expand within  the Texas Judiciary due to  the collective and  willful \nneglect by the enjoined individuals to uphold their mandatory dut ies. By neglecting the \nresponsibilit ies of his pos ition of power, David L. Evans has inadvertently  aided in the furtherance \nof the RICO enterprise\u2019s  primary objective: to secure a fraudulent final decree of divorce  and \nescape accountability . \n As the record establishes, the Respondent has exhausted every appellate an d administrative \nremedy in an attempt to seek redress . Unopposed relief continues to be denied, and more  predicate \nacts in furtherance of the enterp rise\u2019s affairs continue to occur.  \n For the forthcoming reasons, David L. Evans must recuse fr om this matter :\n\n3 \n II. GROUNDS FOR RECUSAL  \nA. Disregard for Recusal Procedure  \n 1. Texas law mandates strict adherence to procedural safeguards in the recusal process to \nensure both actual and apparent judicial impartiality. When a court coordinator \u2014who is not a \nneutral party and serves at the pleasure of the judge subject to recusal \u2014handles the \nadministrative delivery of a recusal motion, this contravenes the explicit requirements of Rule \n18a("}

David L. E vans has allowed the coordinator Lindsey Baker \u2013 not the clerk \u2013 to handle \nthe duties the legislature explicitly designates to court clerks. Rule 18a(e)(2) plainly stat es that \n\u201c\u2026when a respondent judge signs and files an order of recusal or referral, the clerk of the court \nmust immediately deliver a copy to the regional presiding judge. \u201d  \n 3.

See  25-0361, 25-\n0367, 25-0378.  \n 14. In the midst of these efforts, James Munford continued to ignore the issues and after \nthe SAPCR was improperly consolidated by Judge Newell, Judge Munford chose to move the \ncase towards final deposition , which was promptly objected to and ignored the same. REC. 2480.  \n 15. These actions lead to the second recusal motion,  facially naming James Munford as \nthe respondent judge. REC. 2488.  \n 16. This time, David Evans addressed two major issues raised in an objection by the \nRespondent:  \n  i. The continued involvement of Lindsey Baker, the court coordinator;  \n  ii. The erroneous order of referral sent by Judge Kaitcer ; REC. 2620  \n 17. In his order, he argued that  \n\u201cThe court coordinators and clerks work together to assist the trial judges and the administrative \njudges. Only the judges, not the litigants, have the authority to direct the activities of the court \ncoordinators and clerks. Mr. Myers' objections regarding the involvement are overruled \u201d REC. \n3507.\n\n6 \n  18. This argument fails \u2013 because the rules of procedure does not designate any role to  \nthe Court Coordinator, and based on prior conduct \u2013 her involvement has facially created  \nambiguity in a process designe d to promote transparency and fairness . By refusing to comply \nwith the Rule 18a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure in multiple recusal proceedings \u2013 there \nis no question regarding his impartiality \u2013 it has been compromised by , what the Responde nt \nbelieves to be, political reas ons.  \n 19.

A ll that was received in response to these efforts was \u201c Denied, per curiam \u201d. \nRespondent understands that the Court of appeals has the d iscretion to is sue such explanations, \nhowever, given the scope of these issues , they cannot be addressed at final disposition, and based \non everything above, there  no reasonable possibility  that one would think that there could be a \nfair and impartial trial  given these circumstances . This will only lead to further appeals and more  \nwasted judicial resources when these issues could just be dealt with at present.  \n 21. The regional judge\u2019s repeated failure to follow mandatory recusal procedures \u2014by \ndenying hearings on recusal motions, involving non-neutral staff, and failing to provide meaningful appellate remedies \u2014constitutes a pattern of procedural irregularities that violates \nboth statutory requirements and the fundamental due process right to a fair and impartial tribunal.

The authorities provided leave no doubt that adherence to recusal procedures \nis essential to the integrity of the Texas judicial system.  \nIII.

Since December of 2023, I have repeatedly attempted to address a fraudulent scheme to divest me of my business and property interests through proper legal channels. Each time I have utilized legitimate legal pathways, I have been met with procedural irregu larities \nand violations that have prevented fair adjudication of my claims.  \n3. The Regional Presiding Judge, Honorable David L. Evans, has been directly involved in handling multiple recusal proceedings related to my case, and has consistently failed to follow the mandatory procedures required by Texas law, as detailed below.  \n4. I have exhausted all available appellate and administrative remedies in my attempts to seek redress. Despite filing multiple mandamus petitions with the Texas Supreme Court (cause numbers 25-0361, 25-0367, 25-0378, 25-0426, and 25-0458), I have received only \"Denied, per curiam\" responses without substantive consideration of the serious procedural violations occurring in my case.\n\n9 \n PROCEDURAL VIOLATIONS  \n5. On October 7, 2024, I filed a Joint Motion to Recuse Honorable Judges James Munford \nand Jeffrey Kaitcer, including supporting evidence and a properly executed affidavit as required by Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a. \n6. On October 8, 2024, at 4:42 P.M., I received correspondence from court coordinator \nLindsey Baker regarding the order of referral. Upon inspection, I discovered that both my \naffidavit and supporting exhibits had been removed from the motion that was sent to  \nRegional Judge Evans.  \n7. I immediately notified the court coordinator that the exhibits and affidavit were missing from the materials sent to Judge Evans. The coordinator confirmed that my exhibits were indeed filed electronically as one document with the lead document, in accordance with the Tarrant County District Clerk's Filing FAQ, which states: \"Same process for exhibit as initial filings - Exhibits should be merged into one document with the lead document.\"  \n8.

This time, the coordinator claimed that the \"size of the motion\" justified splitting it into three separate files, this time including the exhibits and affidavit that had been previously omitted, thereby contradicting the earlier handling of the motion.  \n10. These actions directly violated Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a(e)(2), which explicitly states: \"When a respondent judge signs and files an order of recusal or referral, the clerk of the court must immediately deliver a copy to the regional presiding jud ge.\"\n\n10 \n 11. The law does not permit a court coordinator, who serves at the pleasure of the judge \nsubject to recusal, to handle this sensitive procedural matter.

The continued involvement of Lindsey Baker, the court coordinator; and  \nb. The erroneous order of referral sent by Judge Kaitcer.  \n17. In his order, Judge Evans stated: \"The court coordinators and clerks work together to assist the trial judges and the administrative judges.

Under established Texas case law, recusal is required not only for actual bias but also \nwhere procedural irregularities create an appearance of impropriety or reasonable doubt as to a judge's impartiality.

Based on all the foregoing facts, I respectfully assert that Judge David L. Evans has \ndemonstrated a pattern of disregard for the mandatory recusal procedures established by Texas law, creating both an appearance of impropriety and reasonable doubt as to h is \nimpartiality in handling matters related to my case.  \n31. His failure to adhere to the clear requirements of Rule 18a, combined with his explicit approval of non-neutral staff handling sensitive recusal materials in contravention of the rule's plain language, constitutes grounds for recusal under Texas law.  \n32. I respectfully request that this Honorable Court:  \n  a. Grant the motion to recuse Judge David L. Evans;  \n  b. Effectuate an immediate stay of these proceedings to preserve the integrity of  \n  the Texas judiciary;  \n  c. Provide interim relief pursuant to Rule 18a(g)(4) that restores my property  \n  interests;  \n  d. Require the Petitioner and her counsel to provide a written response to the  \n  allegations contained herein; and\n\n14 \n   e. P"}
