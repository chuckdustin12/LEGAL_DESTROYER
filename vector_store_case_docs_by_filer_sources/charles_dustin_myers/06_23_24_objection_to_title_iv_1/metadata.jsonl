BACKGROUND\n1. In January of 2021, the decision to pursue a career from home came from a\ndeep desire within the Respondent to provide a dual role for his Children \u2013 being that \nof a provider and a caregiver. Leading up to that point, the Couple had alternated \nroles in providing for their children: one parent worked to support the family Morgan Michelle Myers,  \nPetitioner,  \nv. OBJECTION TO TITLE -IV \nINTERVENTION  \nCharles Dustin Myers,  \nRespondent  \n2024-06-30 \n1\n\nfinancially while the other assumed a full- time caretaker role.  However, this decision \nended up being in the best interest of the children. \n2.The harmonious arrangement was greatly facilitated by the support of\nMargie and Jesse Wilson \u2014next- door neighbors, landlords, and great -grandparents to \nthe children involved in this case. The Wilsons provided a stable and affordable \nhome at a discounted rental rate of $800 per month, laying a foundation for a \nnurturing and stable environment for the children. With regular, daily access to \nboth parents and the added benefit of their great grandparents living next door on a \ntranquil cul -de-sac in Watauga \u2014the children benefit ted from a uniquely supportive \nand loving environment , which created an ideal situation for the children's growth \nand well -being.  \n3. The new arrangement afforded the Petitioner a significant amount of time,\nwhich she allocated to becoming more involved with the PTA, eventually becoming President. The Respondent continued to pursue growth and expand his knowledge in \nthe fields of market finance, programming, SEC law, and legal transcription via \nCrowd Surf and similar platforms while"}

The Respondent continued to pursue growth and expand his knowledge in \nthe fields of market finance, programming, SEC law, and legal transcription via \nCrowd Surf and similar platforms while both parents remained daily figures in all facets of their day -to-day lives. \nII.STATUTORY PROTECTIONS\n4.The Texas Family Code references \u201cthe best interest of the child\u201d 109\nt\nimes throughout its\u2019 1,627 pages. The word \u201calways\u201d appears just once \u2013 within  Id \u00a7 \n153.002.  \n5. The language provided by Id \u2013 being unambiguous on its\u2019 face \u2013 shows a\nclear requirement by the State to meet its\u2019 statutory requirement : \n2\n\n\u201c[t]he best interest of the child shall always be the primary \nconsideration of the court in determining the issues of conservatorship and \npossession of and access to the child. \u201c Id. \n6. The\nse statutory protections \u201c\u2026are [clearly ] indicative of the wide\ndiscretion the Legislature has granted the courts to act  when the best interest of the \nchild would be served thereby.\" Lutheran Social Service, Inc. v. Meyers , 460 S.W.2d \n887 (Tex. 1970) . Despite this wide discretion, this court has chosen not to use it. \n7. Long ago, in Holley V. Adams, 544 S.W.2d 367 (Tex. 1976) the Supreme\nCourt of Texas  provided this State with a non- exhaustive list of factors that the court \nmay use in determining the best interest of the Child.  Despite these factors, the court \nhas taken into consideration none of them. \n8.In more recent jurisprudence, the United States Supreme Court in Troxel v.\nGranville , 530 U.S. 57 (2000), affirmed that under the Fourteenth Amendment, \nparents have a fundamental right to direct the care, custody, and control of their \nchildren.  \n9. When contested issues are at hand, the Texas Family Code affords litigants\nwith a reporter of record  to preserve the ability to make an effective appeal . Id \n\u00a7105.003. This  statutory mandate was ignored.\n10.When a Petitioner waives the 60 -day waiting period  for divorce claiming\nan active order of prot"}

Id \u00a7 6.405(b). Despite no such \norder existing, no hearing should have ever taken place. \nIII. STATE INTERVENTION\n3\n\n1 1. On January 16th, 2024, the State simply did what it cannot do , and failed\nto offer the State mandated protections afforded by Id. \n12. The decision rendered on 01/16/2024 was a de facto  temporary\ntermination of parental rights  prior to any evidentiary hearing taking place. \n13. The subsequent order rendered on 01/22/2024 by Judge Kaitcer\nprolonged the initial orders. \n14. On February 1st, 2024, a settlement agreement was drafted by the\nRespondent\u2019s own legal counsel, who advised the Respondent to sign the agreement, \nresulting in his immediate termination and challenge of the original agreement on \nreconsideration. A true and accurate copy of this agreement has been attached hereto as Exhibit A.  \n15. A hearing wasn\u2019t scheduled until March 14th, 2024, due to delays by our\nfriends on the other side, who have filed no opposition to any claims for relief made \nby the Respondent or allegations asserted. In fact, this was the only hearing that took \nplace in t his case.  \n16.Despite invoking the statutory protections mentioned above  at the\nhearing , the court rendere d temporary orders which were permitted to be redu ced to \nwriting  outside of their own procedural requirements ordered by the same judge by \nan attorney who had no initial desire to represent the Petitioner in the first place . \n17.Despite the hearing being contested, and notwithstanding the statutory\nrequirement for the court to provide a court reporter in such cases, this requirement was once again ignored. This omission rendered it impossible to properly raise an"}

This omission rendered it impossible to properly raise an \n4\n\nobjection to the deprivation, as the essential element needed to make the objection \nwas not provided. \n18.Given the State\u2019s initial failure to uphold its mandated requirements set\nforth in the Texas Family Code, any further Sta te intervention would lead to and has \nled to the same failure  giving the magnitude of the decision made at the onset. \n19.This court has no facts regarding the decisions made affecting the parent -\nchild relationship and therefore has not considered the best interest of the child. \nIV.CONTINUOUS DEFECT\n20.The last contact with the opposing counsel occurred on May 19th in\nresponse to a defective IWO  regarding the relevance of the orders in question. A true \nand accurate copy of these  emails has been attached hereto as Exhibit B.  \nA true and accurate copy of the defective IWO has been attached hereto as Exhibit C.  \nV.CONSENT\n21.The  consent from the Respondent is what this court relies on. Without it \u2013\nthere \u2019s no basis for any decision made. \"Once the trial court renders an agreed \njudgment, a party may not withdraw his consent if the trial court was unaware of any objection at the time of rendition. \u201d In re D.S., 76 S.W.3d 512 (Tex. App. 2002) ; see \nFirst Heights Bank, FSB v. Marom , 934 S.W.2d 843 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] \n1996, no writ). In this instance, at the time of rendition, Judge Jeffrey Kaitcer was \nwell aware of consent not being present at the time of rendition , but rendered them \nanyway . \n5\n\nVI.PREMATURITY\n22. The intervention request made by the Title-IV Agency is premature. The\ncase is currently pending review in the Supreme Court of Texas, and the Agency has \nno facts pertaining to this case  as outlined in the language of their pleading.  \n23.

Rather than intervening on an erroneous and fraudulently rendered\ntemporary order prior to any factual understanding of the case - the agency should \nconsider filing an amicus brief in support of the Respondent  with the Supreme Court \nof Texas  given the destruction c aused by the State thus far \u2013 or request findings of \nfact and conclusio ns of law from the trial court. The State \u2019s mandate to enforce  and \nestablish child support should come only second to and after affirmation that the current custodial arrangements are in the best interest of the child.  \n24. The Respondent timely requested findings of fact and conclusions of law\nregarding the current orders in question over 90 days ago which have yet to be \nanswered.  \nVII. CONCLUSION\n25. This request for intervention i s another attempt by our friends on the other\nside to have the work which should already be on file with the court completed for \nthem.  \n26. After seven months of litigation, our friends on the other side have done\nnothing but delay proceedings, file fraudulent and inaccurate pleadings, ignore civil \nprocedure, and are now trying to enforce a void order rendered outside of their own \nprocedural requirements. \n6\n\n27.The unacceptable negligence on behalf of Cooper L. Carter and the trial\ncourt as a whole all stems from the intentional, malicious, and deceptive pleadings \nfiled by the Petitioner, and \ninfluenced by Daniel Branthoover, and Margie Wilson \nresulting in direct interference with the Respondent\u2019 s constitutional rights.  \n28.No am ount of chil d support ca n replace what this State and the Petitioner\nhave willingly de stroyed with the  assistance of  Cooper L .
