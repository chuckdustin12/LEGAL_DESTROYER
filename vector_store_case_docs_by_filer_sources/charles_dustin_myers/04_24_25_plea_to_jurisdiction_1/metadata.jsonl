No protective order was ever issued and no findings of family violence were made, even though Tex. Fam. Code \u00a7\u00a7\u200983.006 and 85.001 plainly require such findings. In the weeks that followed, the court continued these arrangements and ul timately entered \u201cAgreed\u201d Temporary \nOrders (March 26, 2024) allocating parenting time and support. All of these extreme orders were based solely on Petitioner\u2019s Title 4 application (and allegations of family violence), and no amendments to the pleadings we re ever filed to convert the case into a Title 5 SAPCR. \nRespondent never received any notice or hearing on custody, possession, or support issues under Title 5.  \nII. Legal Standards\nThe trial court\u2019s authority is strictly limited by the statutes and pleadings. It may consider \nonly the claims and relief expressly pleaded by the parties, and must follow the Family Code\u2019s procedures for protective orders and SAPCRs. Subject\u2010matter jurisd iction is a threshold issue: if\n\nthe court acted beyond the law, its orders are void. A plea to the jurisdiction is decided as a \nmatter of law when the relevant facts are undisputed (see Tex. Dep\u2019t of Parks & Wildlife v. Miranda, 133 S.W.3d 217, 228 (Tex. 2004)). Here, the material jurisdictional facts are not in dispute.  \nIII. Title 4 (Protective Order) Proceedings Cannot Support Custody or Support  \nUnder Texas law, a protective\u2010order proceeding (Title 4) is not  a custody (SAPCR) \nproceeding (Title 5). The San Antonio Court of Appeals recently reaffirmed that without a proper SAPCR petition under Title 5, a court may not award conservatorship, possession, or support. In Rivera v. Figueroa (Tex. App.\u2013San Antonio 2019), the court held"}

In Rivera v. Figueroa (Tex. App.\u2013San Antonio 2019), the court held that orders issued in a protective\u2010order case cannot support conservatorship or child\u2010support relief unless a Title 5 petition was filed and noticed. Likewise, In re Sheffie ld, 639 S.W.2d 270 (Tex. App.\u2013Dallas \n1982), long held that Title 4 and Title 5 proceedings are jurisdictionally separate: \u201ca court may not grant relief beyond the scope of the protective\u2010order statute without compliance with the SAPCR statutes\u201d (sheffield, 6 39 S.W.2d at 272- 73). Here, Petitioner\u2019s December 22 Title 4 \napplication was never amended or converted into a Title 5 petition. Respondent never waived notice or a hearing on conservatorship/possession issues. The court\u2019s decision to exclude Respondent from the home and divest him of custody on January 16, 2024 therefore had no \njurisdictional basis. In short, \u201c[w]ithout a valid protective order in place, the court lacked \njurisdiction to continue enforcing the extreme relief originally granted\u201d.  \nIV . Statutory Prerequisites for Exclusion and Protective Orders Were Not Met  \nEven if the court treated the relief as a protective\u2010order, the Family Code\u2019s strict \nrequirements were ignored. Tex. Fam. Code \u00a7\u200983.006(a) permits exclusion of a party from the\n\nhome only  if (1) the applicant files a sworn affidavit describing facts requiring exclusion, and (2) \nappears at the hearing to testify on those facts. Section 83.006(b) further requires that the court \nmake three findings: (i) the applicant resides (or recently resi ded) at the premises, (ii) the other \nparty committed family violence within the past 30 days, and (iii) there is a clear and present danger of future family violence. Likewise, \u00a7\u200985.001(a) mandates that at the close of a protective\u2010order hearing, the court must explicitly find whether family violence occurred. If so, \nthe court"}

If so, \nthe court \u201c shall \u201d issue a protective order against the perpetrator. In this case, none of these \nprerequisites were satisfied. Petitioner did file an application and affidavit, but no hearing on January 16 (or thereafter) produced any finding of family violence. The court did not issue a protective order as the statute requires, and instead simply extended the eviction and custody restrictions indefinitely. By failing to hold a hearing, make any family\u2010violence finding, or enter a protective order, the court \u201cbypass[ed] the statutory prerequisites\u201d entirely. Without those statutorily required findings, the January 16 \u201ckick\u2010out\u201d and custody order was outside the court\u2019s \npower. \nV . All Orders Exceeding the Pleadings or Statutory Authority Are Void\nIt is a bedrock rule that a Texas court must confine its rulings to the relief requested by \nthe pleadings and authorized by statute. Any order beyond that scope is void. The Houston First \nCourt of Appeals has stated that \u201c[a]n order purporting to grant relief beyond the pleadings is void ab initio\u201d. In Guillory v. Boykins, 442 S.W.3d 682, 690 (Tex. App.\u2013Houston [1st Dist.] 2014, no pet.), the court held that where a trial court lacks jurisdiction or statutory authority to grant the relief, the order is void . Similarly, In re P .M.G., 405 S.W.3d 406, 416\u201317 (Tex. App.\u2013\nTexarkana 2013, no pet.), confirms that orders entered without pleadings or outside statutory scope are null. Here, not only did the protective\u2010order pleadings not include any SAPCR claims,\n\nbut the later \u201cagreed\u201d orders on March 26, 2024 were not signed or even consented to by \nRespondent (violating Tex. R. Civ. P. 11). In short, every custody and exclusion order in this case was \u201cpredicated on a void order\u201d . As th e Second Court of Appeals recognized in In re C.L."}

R. Civ. P. 11). In short, every custody and exclusion order in this case was \u201cpredicated on a void order\u201d . As th e Second Court of Appeals recognized in In re C.L., 933 \nS.W.2d 402, 405 (Tex. App.\u2013Fort Worth 1996, no writ), an order that is void ab initio \u201ccannot form the basis for any valid subsequent judgment\u201d .  That\u2019s exactly what is happening here. The \ncourt is now moving to finalize fraud, constitutional deprivation, and is trying to finalize its\u2019 original excision of Respondent\u2019s constitutional rights. The court cannot destroy a family and then move to finalize that without a lawful basis, and over orders that are fundamentally void.  \nIV . Violation of Respondent\u2019s Constitutional Rights to Due Process and Family Integrity  \nThe trial court\u2019s actions not only violated statute but also trampled Respondent\u2019s \nfundamental constitutional rights. By evicting the Respondent from his home and effectively separating him from his children with no prior notice or opportunity to be heard , the court \ndeprived him of liberty and property without due process of law. This violates Article I, \u00a7\u200919 of the Texas Constitution  (the \u201cdue course of law\u201d guarantee) and the Fourteenth Amendment to \nthe U.S. Constitution . Now, the court seeks to finalize this fundamental error amidst an ongoing \nappeal, showing a continuous and complete disregard for the Respondent\u2019s rights.  \nA. Deprivation of Property Without Due Process  \nThe January 16 order forced Respondent to vacate his own home on the same day it was \nissued. A person\u2019s right to occupy their home is a significant property interest, protected by due process. Yet Respondent was ousted immediately, with no notice that such  relief would be sought \nand no chance to contest the allegations. The Texas Constitution and the 14\nth Amendment both \nforbid the State from depriving any person of property without due process of law.

Fuentes v. \nShevin, 407 U.S. 67, 81- 82 (1972) (even tempo rary, non- final deprivations of property require\n\nnotice and hearing absent extraordinary circumstances). While Texas law does allow ex parte \norders in truly exigent circumstances, those orders must be narrowly tailored and followed promptly by a full hearing. Here, the statutory requirements for an ex pa rte kick -out were \ndisregarded, and Respondent was left homeless and separated from his belongings based on one -\nsided assertions. This is precisely the kind of state action that due process is meant to guard against.  \nB. Deprivation of Parental Rights Without Due Process  \nEven more critically, the court\u2019s orders infringed Respondent\u2019s fundamental right to \nparent his children, also without due process. A parent\u2019s interest in the care, custody, and control of their children is fundamental . The United States Supreme Court has recognized that \u201cthe \ninterest of parents in the care, custody, and control of their children\u2026is perhaps the oldest of the \nfundamental liberty interests  recognized by this Court.\u201d Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 65 \n(2000) (plurality op.). Likewise, the Texas Supreme Court has affirmed that \u201cthe fundamental right of parents to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children\u201d is constitutionally protected. In re C.J.C., 603 S.W.3d 804, 811 (Tex. 2020) (citing Troxel , 530 U.S. \nat 66). Governmental interference with this right is subject to strict scrutiny and must be accomplished only with rigorous procedural safeguards.  \nHere, Respondent\u2019s removal from the home effectively altered custody of the children  \nwithout any hearing or finding of unfitness. Respondent went from being an equal managing conservator of the children to having zero possession or access (by virtue of being excluded from the home and the children\u2019"}

Respondent went from being an equal managing conservator of the children to having zero possession or access (by virtue of being excluded from the home and the children\u2019s presence) overnight and without notice. This is a profound deprivation of parental rights. As the U.S. Supreme Court held in Stanley v. Illinois , an unwed \nfather could not be presumed unfit and have his children taken without a hearing \u2013 \u201cthe Due\n\nProcess Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires that [a father] be given a hearing on \nhis fitness as a parent before  his children are removed from his custody.\u201d Stanley v. Illinois , 405 \nU.S. 645, 649 (1972) (emphasis added). The State \u201ccannot, consistently with due process, merely presume\u201d  a parent\u2019s unfitness or danger and bypass a hearing; \u201cparental unfitness \nmust be established on the basis of individualized proof\u201d  before a child is taken away. Id. at \n647, 649. Yet in Respondent\u2019s case, the court did exactly what Stanley  forbids \u2013 it presumed the \nnecessity of removing the father, without any adversarial testing of the evidence or finding of actual misconduct and left the determination for later (a hearing that kept getting postponed). This violated Respondent\u2019s procedural due process rights to be heard before  being deprived of \ncustody of his children.  \nMoreover, the substantive  aspect of due process was violated. There is a \u201cstrong \npresumption that the best interest of a child is served by remaining with a fit parent.\u201d Troxel , \n530 U.S. at 68- 69. The government may not \u201cinfringe on the fundamental right of parents to \nmake child rearing decisions simply because a state judge believes a \u2018better decision\u2019 could be made .\u201d Id.  at 72 (plurality op.).

Article I, Section 19 of the Texas Constitution guarantees that no citizen shall be deprived of liberty or property except by the due course of the law of the land  \u2013 here, \nRespondent was deprived of both without the lawful procedures or any adjudication of wrongdoi ng.\n\nIn sum, the process (or lack thereof) employed by the court fell far short of constitutional \nrequirements. This constitutional infirmity is independently sufficient to render the court\u2019s orders \nvoid. A judgment entered in violation of due process is void a nd subject to collateral attack. \nPeralta v. Heights Medical Center, Inc., 485 U.S. 80, 84- 85 (1988) (judgment rendered without \nproper notice violates due process and is void).

Texas Dept. of Parks & Wildlife , a plea to the \njurisdiction should be granted as a matter of law if the jurisdictional facts are undisputed or uncontroverted by competent evidence. Here, there is no genuine issue that (a) no protective order was issued and no findings of family violence were made, (b) no Title 5 SAPCR notice  of \nhearing exists on the record, or  was ever on file, and (c) all of Petitioner\u2019s requests for home \nexclusion and support were styled under Title 4 and unsupported by any pleaded conservatorship claim.
