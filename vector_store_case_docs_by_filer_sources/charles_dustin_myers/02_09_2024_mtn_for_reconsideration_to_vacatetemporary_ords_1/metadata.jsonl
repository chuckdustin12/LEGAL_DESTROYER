The suit was unlawful by nature \u2075, as the grounds for eviction were based on \nfamily status,  referencing the divorce as well as  a protective order that had been \ndenied on December 14th, 2023.  The suit was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction  on \nJanuary 17th, 2024.\u2076 \n D. PROTECTIVE ORDER  \n1. This suit was the second attempt by the Petitioner  to have me removed from \nthe home , which ultimately succeeded .  \n2. The claims with in this suit mentioned se xually aggressive comments  and \nthreatening behavior. These allegations are ma terially false, as the Petitioner  \npossess es no evidence, and has presented no evidence in relation to th ese claims  \nsince the initiation of the suit. Despite this , as video and image evidence will show  \nonce a fair trial date is se t, the Petitioner and I continued to maintain stability at \nour family home and  preserved the sense o f normal cy that our daughters have \nbeen a ccustomed to their entire lives  up until January 16th, 2024 . \n The Court's decision  to remove me from my home and my children \u2019s lives on January \n16th, 202 4, albeit preliminary  and unjusti fied, bypassed  the safeguarding of the children's \nemotional, psychological, and physical well -being. This oversight is compounded by the \nPetitioner's actions . The juxtaposition of the Court's decision against the backdrop of the \nPetitioner's inattention to the children's needs illuminates a disconcerting disregard for the \nparamount principle that custody determinations should primarily serve the children's best \ninterests.

This \ndecision, unexpectedly made, awarded custody to the Petitioner, overlooking my \nconcerns about the adverse effects on our children and my work from home.

Her actions speak \nto a pattern of deceit, manipulation, and an unsettling willingness to leverage the judicial \nsystem for personal vendettas, all at the expense of the emotional and psychological well -being \nof our children.  \n \nThe court, in its decisions, inadvertently facilitated this troubling trajectory by removing me, \nCharles Dustin Myers, from the lives of our children based on unsubstantiated claims and \nwithout due consideration of my role as a devoted and stable parent. T his oversight has not \nonly disrupted the lives of our children but has also significantly impaired my ability to provide \nfor them, casting a long shadow over their future stability and welfare.  \n \nMoreover, the conduct of my Counsel  involved has further compounded these issues, \ndemonstrating a distressing disregard for the intricate dynamics and facts of this case. This has \nculminated in a situation where the paramount importance of the children's best interests and \nthe fundamental p rinciples of fairness and justice have been overshadowed by procedural \nmissteps and a lack of thorough investigation into the Petitioner's fitness as a par"}

Specifically, I respectfully request the \nCourt to:  \n1.

Scrutinize any response or new claims from the Petitioner or her counsel with the utmost \ndiligence, given the established pattern of deceitful and manipulative behavior exhibited \nby the Petitioner throughout these proceedings.  \n4. Consider awarding me full custody of our children, ensuring their continued access to a \nstable, nurturing environment, and the consistent provision of their needs, which I am \nfully committed to upholding. Furthermore, in alignment with my enduring belief i n the \nimportance of both parents in the lives of our children, I pledge to facilitate and \nencourage a healthy, constructive relationship between the children and their mother, \nprovided she demonstrates a genuine commitment to their well -being and stability . \n5.
