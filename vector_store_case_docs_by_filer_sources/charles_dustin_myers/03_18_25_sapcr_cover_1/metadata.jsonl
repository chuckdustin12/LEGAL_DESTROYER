This SAPCR is intentionally filed as a new, separate case , rather than under the \nexisting divorce cause, due to unique procedural defects in that divorce proceeding that have left \nthe children in legal and physical limbo. Immediate intervention  is required to protect the \nchildren\u2019s best interests. Below, I outline the compelling reasons \u2013 supported by law and the record \u2013 why this SAPCR must proceed separately  and be set for an emergency hearing  at \nonce, instead of being merged into the stalled divorce case. \nA. Failure of Opposing Party to Prosecute\n1. The divorce Petitioner has wholly failed to prosecute the divorce, leaving it in\nprocedural limbo.  Over a year has passed with no meaningful activity toward a final resolution. \nNotably, after the divorce case was removed to federal court and later remanded, Petitioner \nnever filed the required certified Order of Remand or gave notice of remand  as mandated by \nTexas Rule of Civil Procedure 237a. Rule 237a obligates the removing party to promptly file the \nfederal remand order with the state clerk and notify all parties, after which any defendant has 15 \ndays to answer . Petitioner\u2019s omission  of this required step has left the state court record \nincomplete and the case procedurally suspended. Indeed, due to Petitioner\u2019s inaction (and her\n\ncounsel\u2019s apparent inability to e -file; see Point 8 below), no remand notice was ever filed , so \nthe divorce court has not resumed "}

Indeed, due to Petitioner\u2019s inaction (and her\n\ncounsel\u2019s apparent inability to e -file; see Point 8 below), no remand notice was ever filed , so \nthe divorce court has not resumed jurisdiction in any practical sense . \n2. In addition, Petitioner has ignored the Texas Supreme Court\u2019s time standards  for \ntimely disposition of cases . A divorce case is expected to be resolved within 12 months , yet \nPetitioner has made no effort to advance it. She has not set a trial or even a status conference; she \nhas allowed critical deadlines to lapse. This lack of diligence violates the duty to prosecute one\u2019s claims and warrants dismissal for want of prose cution. In fact, Respondent has been forced to \nfile a Motion to Dismiss for Want of Prosecution (pending before the Court) detailing Petitioner\u2019s complete failure to move the case forward. This also remains un- responded to. \nPetitioner\u2019s inaction has left the family with no active forum  to address urgent child- related \nissues. Therefore, a separate SAPCR  is necessary to provide a functioning vehicle for relief. \nThe children cannot wait  for the Petitioner\u2019s  indifference or strategic delay to abate.  \nB. Failure to Oppose Any Relief (Legal Concession)  \n3. Throughout the divorce case, Petitioner has not opposed or responded to any of \nRespondent\u2019s filings , motions, or claims for relief. She and her counsel have remained silent in \nthe face of serious allegations and requests, effectively conceding the merits  of those issues \nunder Texas law. Respondent has raised grave claims of fraud, perjury, deception, and child neglect  against Petitioner in his pleadings, yet Petitioner\u2019s counsel has filed no response or \ndefense to these claims . Respondent also served discovery and Requests for Admissions which \nwent completely unanswered , resulting in deemed admissions. He even filed a motion to \ncompel discovery, which Petitioner again did not oppose , though unfortunately no hearing has \nyet been held . "}

By her\n\ninaction, Petitioner has implicitly admitted the validity  of Respondent\u2019s factual assertions and \nthe justness of his requests .  \n4. Texas law is clear that a party who fails to respond to motions or claims effectively \nwaives any objection and accepts the movant\u2019s evidence as true . For example, in the \nsummary judgment context, if a nonmovant files no response, the court may accept the movant\u2019s \nasserted facts as uncontroverted and render judgment if entitlement is shown; issues not timely raised in a written response are waived ; see Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(c) . The same principle applies \nhere: Petitioner\u2019s total failure to contest Respondent\u2019s filings is tantamount to a legal concession  \nof those matters . In other words, f ailure to make timely and specific objections results in waiver \nof the objections. S ee Clark v. Trailways, Inc., 774 S.W.2d 644, 647 (Tex. 1989), cert. denied, \n493 U.S. 1074, 110 S.Ct. 1122, 107 L.Ed.2d 1028 (1990) ; Hartford Accident and Indem.

Accordingly, there is no reason to keep the children waiting in the paralytic divorce case when no one is even arguing against  the relief \nRespondent seeks in this SAPCR. The SAPCR can and should proceed on the uncontroverted facts in Respondent\u2019s filings. \nC. Best Interests of the Children Demand Immediate Action\n\n6. Every day that passes with the children separated from their father is a day of \nirreparable harm.  The undisputed evidence is that the children are suffering due to \nRespondent\u2019s forced absence from the home. In the months since he was excluded, the children\u2019s \nwell-being has precipitously declined: they have fallen behind in school, missed critical medi cal \nand dental appointments, and have been emotionally traumatized by the sudden and prolonged separation from their father. No party\u2014not even Petitioner \u2014has asserted that the children would \nbe anything but better off if their father could return to care f or them. No one has argued against \nRespondent\u2019s return to the home or his involvement in the children\u2019s daily life. It is axiomatic that the best interest of the children is the paramount concern in any case affecting the parent -\nchild relationship. See Tex. Fam. Code \u00a7\u2009153.002 (mandating that \u201c[t]he best interest of the \nchild shall always be the primary consideration of the court in determining the issues of conservatorship and possession of and access to the child\u201d) ; Lenz v. Lenz , 79 S.W.3d 10, 14 \n(Tex. 2002) (emphasizing that courts must place \u201cpredominant emphasis\u201d on what best serves the \nchildren's welfare, particularly focusing on stability, emotional and educational needs, and maintaining frequent contact with fit parents).  \n7. The Texas Legislature explicitly prioritized children\u2019s best interests in all \nconservatorship and possession determinations: \u201cThe best interest of the child shall always be the primary consideration of the court in "}

Fam. Code \u00a7 153.002. Texas Supreme Court \njurisprudence confirms and expands upon this legislative directive, instructing courts to consider stability, educational continuity, emotional health, and ongoing relationships with fit parents in their best -interest analysis. See Lenz , 79 S.W.3d at 14\u201315 (holding courts must evaluate what\n\nwill best serve the child\u2019s overall welfare, ensuring a stable and emotionally supportive \nenvironment and maintaining meaningful and frequent parental contact).  \n8. Here, it is unquestionably in the children's best interests to have their loving father \nback in their daily lives without further delay. Texas public policy explicitly states that children should have frequent and continuing contact with parents who have demonstrated the ability to act in their best interest. See Tex. Fam. Code \u00a7 153.001(a)  (declaring the public policy of \nTexas to ensure frequent contact and shared duties between parents and children following separation); Lenz , 79 S.W.3d at 14\u201315 (affirming that Texas policy favors maintaining \nfrequent and meaningful parental involvement in a child's life).  \n9. Respondent has demonstrated throughout these proceedings that he is a caring, fit \nparent whose presence provides the children with stability, support for their education and health, and emotional security. By contrast, the children\u2019s current situation\u2014living apart from \nRespondent for no substantiated reason\u2014is destabilizing and harmful. Texas courts recognize the urgency of child custody matters and have repeatedly underscored that \u201cjustice demands a speedy resolution of child custody and child support issues.\u201d  In re Tex.

Simply put, the children\u2019s needs cannot wait on \nprocedural formalities or a dormant divorce case. Their welfare requires this SAPCR to be heard immediately so that orders can be promptly put in place to reunite them with their father and address their academic, emotional, and medical needs. No statute or rule forbids initiating a separate SAPCR when it is necessary to protect children's best interests. Indeed, Tex. Fam. Code \n\u00a7 153.002 and the overarching equitable duty of the Court compel swift action here . Respondent \nis ready, willing, and able to resume caring for his children, and no party has objected to him\n\ndoing so. Therefore, the Court must accept this SAPCR and schedule an immediate hearing to \nserve the children's best interests without further delay. See Lenz, 79 S.W.3d at 14\u201315 (holding courts must prioritize swift judicial actions in custody matters, protecting the best interests of children).  \nD. Fraud and Perjury Render the Prior Orders Void  \n10. The orders entered in the divorce case that currently keep Respondent out of the home \nand away from the children were obtained through fraud, misrepresentation, and even perjury . Because those orders were procured by wrongful means, they are void ab initio  and \ncannot be permitted to stand in the way of this SAPCR. Texas law does not tolerate court orders obtained by trickery or false pretenses. Notably, the temporary orders in the divorce (signed January 16, 2024 and later on March 14, 2024) were presented to the Court as \u201cagreed\u201d orders, yet Respondent never agreed to them  and never signed them. In fact, Respondent had \nexpressly opposed the relief in those orders. The \u201cagreement\u201d was a fiction creat"}

In fact, Respondent had \nexpressly opposed the relief in those orders. The \u201cagreement\u201d was a fiction created by Petitioner\u2019s counsel. The record reflects that Petitioner\u2019s counsel drafted and submitted those orders without Respondent\u2019s consent or signature , and which reference a hearing not found on \nthe docket . This is a textbook example of a fraud on the court . A judgment or order entered as \n\u201cagreed\u201d when one party actually objected is void. The Texas Supreme Court\u2019s holding in Burnaman v. Heaton is directly on point: when a trial court knows a party does not consent to a purported agreed judgment, it must refuse to sign it; any judgment rendered under such circumstances \u201cis void .\u201d Burnaman v. Heaton, 240 S.W.2d 288, 291 (Tex. 1951) . \n 11. Here, the court was misled \u2013 it was never disclosed that Respondent vehemently \ndisagreed. Without such consent the judgment is void. The law will not give effect to a \u201cparty\u2019s consent\u201d that was never actually given. Moreover, the way  those orders were obtained\n\nwas rife with material falsehoods. In her filings, Petitioner knowingly made false statements  to \nthe Court to justify excluding Respondent from the home. For example, in her Application for \nProtective Order and supporting affidavit, Petitioner grossly misrepresented the facts, painting Respondent as a danger without evidence. She alleged incidents  that never occurred or twisted \nmundane events into false claims of \u201cfamily violence.\u201d These misrepresentations were later exposed, and Petitioner has never attempted to prove them in any evidentiary hearing. Petitioner\u2019s intent was plainly to deceive the Court into granting her sole occupancy of the home and custody of the children.

Indeed, Respondent\u2019s pending Motion to Dismiss details how Petitioner \u201cknowingly made and presented fraudulent claims to the Court regarding Respondent\u2019s property, with the intent to deprive him of his interest in his home\u201d , and how \nshe acted with intent that \u201cthese false claims be given the same legal effect as valid court orders, misleading the Court and causing Respondent to be wrongfully deprived of his home and livelihood.\u201d  \n 12. These strong findings, which stand uncontroverted, show that the prior orders were \nprocured by fraud and deception. Under longstanding Texas precedent, any order obtained by \nextrinsic fraud  (fraud that effectively prevents a fair presentation of the case) is void and a \nnullity . See King Ranch, Inc. v. Chapman, 118 S.W.3d 742, 751\u201352 (Tex. 2003) (judgment \nobtained by fraud can be set aside; only extrinsic fraud \u2013 such as keeping a party away from court or concealing critical facts \u2013 justifies relief) .  \n13. Here, Petitioner\u2019s fraud was extrinsic in that it kept Respondent from participating \nfully  (the \u201cagreed\u201d order ploy) and kept the Court from learning the true facts . A litigant who \nlies to gain advantage in a court order subverts the process ; the resulting order lacks integrity \nand is void.\n\n14. In sum, the prior temporary orders that ousted Respondent were built on a \nfoundation of fraud . They should carry no weight and pose no obstacle to granting relief in this \nnew SAPCR. This Court not only has the authority to declare such orders void, it has a duty to \ndo so in order to prevent manifest injustice c. See Burnaman, 240 S.W.2d at 291. By proceeding \nwith a fresh SAPCR, the Court can consider the issues regarding the children de novo, on truthful evidence, untainted by the false premises of the earlier orders.

Restoring the True Status Quo of the Family  \n15. Relief in this SAPCR is also warranted to restore the status quo  that existed before \nPetitioner\u2019s improper actions. The \u201clast actual, peaceable status quo\u201d in this family was Respondent living in the home with the children, as a present and active father. That was the \nreality until late 2023, when Petitioner \u2013 through unilateral false allegations \u2013 removed Respondent from the household. Texas law holds that the purpose of temporary orders and injunctive relief is to maintain or restore the status quo pending trial. See In re Shifflet, 462 S.W.3d 528, 537 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [1st Dist.] 2015, orig. proceeding) (courts aim to restore the last peaceable status quo pending final trial) . \n16. Here, the true status quo ante  was the intact family unit with Respondent present. \nThe situation now \u2013 Respondent barred from the home and children \u2013 is a drastic deviation from that status quo, achieved only by contested court orders that, as shown, lack validity. Every day that Respo ndent is kept out is a day the family\u2019s natural equilibrium is disturbed further.\n\nTexas courts have intervened in analogous situations to return to the rightful status quo. For \nexample, when one party\u2019s unilateral conduct disrupts a long- standing living arrangement, courts \nrecognize that stability must be restored for the benefit of all , especially the children. See Smith \nv. McDaniel , 842 S.W.2d 7, 12 (Tex. App.\u2014Dallas 1992, no writ) (courts should preserve or \nrestore the conditions that existed prior to the controversy to protect the children\u2019s routine and sense of security). Here, restoring the status quo means allowing Respondent back into his home and parenting role immediately"}

Here, restoring the status quo means allowing Respondent back into his home and parenting role immediately . That was the \u201clast peaceable\u201d situation  before litigation \n\u2013 a state in which the children were thriving. Notably, the findings in the temporary orders hearing (held without Respondent) even indicate there were no findings of any imminent harm if Respondent were present; the exclusion was based solely on Petitioner\u2019s requested relief, not on proven misconduct by Respondent.  \n17. Thus, there is no safety- based reason to maintain the current deviation from the norm. \nBy contrast, there are powerful reasons to return to normalcy: the children\u2019s suffering would be \nalleviated, and the family\u2019s balance and stability would be reestablished. \n18. In short, equity demands that we \u201cundo\u201d  the improper disruption caused by \nPetitioner\u2019s actions. This SAPCR allows the Court to do exactly that \u2013 to realign temporary orders with reality and justice. In re Shifflet instructs that the last peaceable status quo should be restored pending trial . The last peaceable status was Respondent in the home; restoring that \nwill harm no one (again, even Petitioner did not claim any abuse or violence requiring exclusion \u2013 her application acknowledged no recent violence, only vague fears). Maintaining the current situation, by contrast, gravely harms the children and prejudices Respondent\u2019s relationship with them. Therefore, the Court should use the SAPCR proceeding to immediately reinstate Respondent to the home and his parenting time, thereby restoring the status quo  that truly\n\nserves the children\u2019s welfare. Every additional day away from that status quo is a deviation that \nthis Court can and should correct now. \nF. The Court\u2019s Duty to Act Without Delay for the Children\u2019s Welfare  \n19.

The Court\u2019s Duty to Act Without Delay for the Children\u2019s Welfare  \n19. By accepting this SAPCR as a separate case, the Court can fulfill its paramount duty \nto protect the children\u2019s welfare without procedural delay . Courts have a sacred obligation  \nto put the interests of children above rigid procedural considerations, especially in emergencies. \nThe Texas Supreme Court has emphasized that trial courts must act immediately when children\u2019s physical or emotional well- being is at stake , even if procedural complexities exist. \nIn In re Tex. Department of Family & Protective Services , for example, the Supreme Court \nadmonished that delays in custody matters are intolerable, quoting with approval the maxim: \u201cJustice demands a speedy resolution of child custody and child support issues.\u201d  210 S.W.3d \n609, 613 (Tex. 2006) . The high court in that case (a mandamus proceeding) required prompt \naction despite procedural entanglements, recognizing that a child\u2019s need for a stable, safe environment cannot be made to wait on protracted litigation maneuvers. \n20. Similarly, in Elizondo v. Monteleone , an appellate court noted that when a parent \nattempted procedural gambits to delay a custody determination, the court system should not allow those tactics to trump the child\u2019s immediate needs. Elizondo v. Monteleone , 96 S.W.3d 705, \n708 (Tex. App.\u2014Corpus Christi 2002, no pet.) (courts will not permit jurisdictional technicalities to delay emergency relief in a parent -child case). [( If citation is verified)] In that case, one party \ntried to remove the case to federal court and argued that the state court lacked jurisdiction to issue temporary orders during the interim.

The lesson is clear: procedural fencing cannot override the need for \nimmediate judicial action when children are suffering.  \n21. Here, Petitioner\u2019s inaction and the snares of the divorce case have already delayed \nrelief for far too long. The children have been without their father for several critical months of their development . The Court has the power \u2014and indeed the duty \u2014to cut through the \nprocedural morass  by creating a new SAPCR docket and promptly addressing the merits of \nconservatorship, possession, and access. There is no jurisdictional barrier to doing so: this Court has continuing jurisdiction over the children (by virtue of the ongoing divorce) and t hus can hear \na SAPCR involving them. Any concern about duplicitous litigation is mitigated by the fact that \nthe divorce case is effectively moribund; furthermore, Respondent will move to consolidate or \ndismiss the divorce once the SAPCR is in place, if appropriate. What cannot be allowed is more delay that leaves the children in a fractured situation. Our Courts are courts of equity as well as law, especially in family matters. When equity demands immediate intervention, the Court \nshould not hesitate. As the Austin Court of Appeals observed, \u201cwhen the jurisdiction of the court has been properly invoked in matters affecting minor children, the court\u2019 s primary consideration is the best interest of the children, and the court may enter any order deemed necessary to protect and conserve the welfar e of the child.\u201d  Elizondo, 96 S.W.3d at 708 (citing Tex. Fam. \nCode \u00a7\u2009105.001 on temporary orders for a child). In other words, once the Court is aware of a child in need, it must act, and act swiftly .  \n22.

Conversely, to refuse the SAP CR or to delay\n\naction because a defunct divorce petition lingers would elevate form over substance and place \nthe children at continued risk, which Texas law forbids . \n23. In sum, this Court is empowered and required to provide a forum for immediate \nrelief , and the SAPCR is the proper mechanism to do so. The Court should therefore promptly \ndocket this SAPCR as a new case and schedule an emergency hearing on temporary orders for the children.  \nG. Protective -Order Application Confirms Respondent\u2019s Joint Ownership of the Home  \n24. Even Petitioner\u2019s own filings acknowledge Respondent\u2019s legal right to return to the \nresidence. In her sworn Application for Protective Order (filed in September 2023), Petitioner explicitly affirmed that the marital residence \u201c is jointly owned or leased by the Applicant and \nRespondent .\u201d \n25. This judicial admission is significant. It means that at the time she sought exclusive \nuse of the home, Petitioner conceded that Respondent is co -owner (or co -leaseholder) of the \nproperty. There is no dispute, therefore, that Respondent has an equal property interest and legal right to occupy the home . Petitioner cannot now contradict her own sworn statement by \nsuggesting Respondent has no such right.  \n26. Why is this important? Because the prior orders granting Petitioner exclusive \npossession of the home (and excluding Respondent) stand in direct conflict with the parties\u2019 property rights and the status quo. Those orders were based not on any finding that R espondent \nlacked ownership or rights to the home, but presumably on a temporary  need for protection \n(which, as shown, was falsely claimed). With the exposure of Petitioner\u2019s allegations as false, there remains no lawful basis  to "}

With the exposure of Petitioner\u2019s allegations as false, there remains no lawful basis  to keep Respondent out of a home that he owns jointly. Texas\n\nFamily Code \u00a7\u2009153.003 states that the Court cannot condition a parent\u2019s possession of a child on \nthe payment of support or other matters unrelated to the child \u2013 likewise, the Court should not condition Respondent\u2019s access to his home (and thereby to his c hildren) on a procedurally flawed \nprior order, especially when Petitioner herself admits the home is community property . The \nprotective order application further underscores that Petitioner\u2019s sole claim to the home was through a temporary court order, not any independent right. When the predicate for that temporary order (alleged family violence) is unproven and disputed, the underlying property rights must prevail.  \n27. In equity, where two parties have equal right to possession of a property, one cannot \nexclude the other absent a valid court order supported by good cause. Here, absent the now -\nquestionable temporary orders, Respondent as joint owner would be free to live in his home. The Court should thus give weight to Petitioner\u2019s admission of joint ownership and recognize Respondent\u2019s unabated property right . This is yet another reason to allow the SAPCR to go \nforward: so that the issue of residency and possession of the home can be revisited in light of the true facts and rights of the parties. The protective order was leveraged into a settlement which both partie s did not agree to (as the record will show, if needed), meaning no long- term \nrestrictions were found warranted. What remains is a fit father who co -owns his home seeking to \nreturn  to his necessity to work and provide financially for the children .

Rule 12 Motion: Opposing Counsel Lacks Authority, Undermining the Divorce Case\n\nFinally, Respondent has filed a Rule 12 Motion  (Motion to Show Authority) in the divorce case, \nwhich is currently pending and further indicates why the existing case cannot properly proceed. \nIn that motion (filed September 20, 2024), Respondent challenged the authority of Petitioner\u2019s attorney of reco rd to act on her behalf .  \n28. This challenge was not made lightly \u2013 it is supported by evidence that Petitioner\u2019s \ncounsel never filed  the pleadings , is not authorized to practice in this matter under her current \nregistration, and may not even have a valid engagement with Petitioner. Notably, since that motion was filed, Petitioner\u2019s counsel has failed to respond to it or otherwise prove her authority . Rule 12 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure provides that an attorney challenged by \nsuch a motion must appear and show authority to act  for the client, or else be struck from the \ncase. Petitioner\u2019s counsel has not met this burden. Instead, irregularities have abounded: at a recent hearing (on Respondent\u2019s motion to recuse), Petitioner\u2019s counsel appeared without \nhaving answered the Rule 12 motion , and the Court allowed her to argue  on a motion she did \nnot respond to , but her authority remains in question.. Moreover, it came to light that Petitioner\u2019s \ncounsel has been unable to e -file pleadings on her client\u2019s behalf  because her electronic filing \naccount is in disarray (registered under a former employer\u2019s email  at Cantey Hanger yet is \nsigning pleadings for Marx, Altman, & Johnson)  . In fact, the few documents \u201cfiled\u201d in the \ndivorce case o"}

In fact, the few documents \u201cfiled\u201d in the \ndivorce case on Petitioner\u2019s side were filed  by Roderick Marx, not by the attorney herself . And \ntellingly, Petitioner\u2019s counsel failed to file the Notice of Remand  after the federal court sent the \ncase back, leaving the case hanging indefinitely . All of this demonstrates that Petitioner\u2019s counsel \nis effectively not acting with proper authority or competence  in the divorce matter.  \n29. This is critical because if Petitioner\u2019s attorney lacks authority, then Petitioner is \nessentially unrepresented  in the divorce. Her pleadings (including the Original Petition for\n\nDivorce) are subject to being stricken as null if the Rule 12 motion is granted. The entire divorce \nproceeding would be a nullity without an authorized petitioner or counsel \u2013 which is another reason it has stagnated. It would be unjust to make the childre n wait for months while this issue \nis sorted out. By contrast, in a new SAPCR, Petitioner can secure proper counsel or proceed pro se, but the Rule 12 quagmire in the divorce case can be sidestepped for now to get the children relief. The pending Rule 12 m otion underscores that the divorce case is on unstable footing. It \nis procedurally snarled by questions of representation. On the other hand, Respondent is ready to proceed in the SAPCR immediately  \u2013 he, as the petitioner in the SAPCR, obviously has \nauthority to bring it, and he will serve Petitioner directly. If Petitioner\u2019s prior counsel truly has no authority, Petitioner will have to either hire new counsel or represent herself in responding to t he \nSAPCR, but at least the case will move forward .

Equity again favors moving to a forum (the SAPCR) where all parties before the Court are indisputably authorized and the merits can be reached \nwithout distraction.  \n30. In summary on this point, Respondent\u2019s Rule 12 motion (which remains unanswered) \nindicates that the opposing attorney \u201chas no authority to act for the party\u201d \u2013 a situation which, by rule, would mandate striking her pleadings and possibly dismissing the divorce. Rather than let the case devolve into that chaos (to the children\u2019s detriment), the Court should start fresh with this SAPCR. The integrity of the proceedings  will be ensured here, because all parties will be \nproperly before the Court. Respondent is confident that once this SAPCR is active, Petitioner will either appear on her own or with legitimate counsel and the issues can finally be adjudicated on the merit s. Until then, the divorce case cannot be trusted as a vehicle for relief due to the\n\ncloud over Petitioner\u2019s representation. This factor strongly supports accepting the SAPCR as a \nstandalone action and granting the requested hearing and relief without delay. \nI. Conclusion  \n31. For all the foregoing reasons \u2013 lack of prosecution in the divorce, Petitioner\u2019s waiver \nof opposition, the children\u2019s urgent needs, the void nature of prior orders, the necessity of \nrestoring the status quo, and procedural snares in the divorce case \u2013 Respondent respectfully urges the Clerk to file the enclosed SAPCR as a new cause of action, and requests that the Court set an immediate EX -PARTE hearing on temporary orders  in this SAPCR  to issue \ninjunctive relief immediately allowing acc ess back in to the residency and children \u2019s lives. \nThe Court has abundant legal justification and equitable grounds to do so.

Every factor discussed above converges on one truth: these \nchildren need their father back and need a stable, working court order to govern their custody and care \u2013 and they need it now, not months from now. By allowing this SAPCR to proceed separately, t he Court will cut the Gordian knot that the divorce case has become and will be able \nto issue orders truly serving the children\u2019s best interests forthwith . \n32. Respondent is prepared to appear for an emergency hearing on any date and time  the \nCourt can accommodate  \u2013 preferably today . He is also prepared to file any additional supporting \ndocuments or evidence the Court may require. All necessary filing fees for this SAPCR are being paid, and service of process will be promptly effected on the opposing party. We ask only that the Clerk accept this filing  (rather than reject or re -route it to the old cause) and that the Court \nimmediately calendar the case for a hearing at the earliest possible date. If there are any\n\nquestions or if any further information is needed to facilitate this request, Respondent is at the \nCourt\u2019s disposal to provide it. \n33. Thank you very much for your prompt attention to this urgent matter. By taking swift\naction, the Clerk and Court will literally be changing the lives of two children for the better. The law and justice are on the side of moving forward with this SAPCR. Respondent implores the Court to do so without delay. \nRespectfully submitted,  \nCharles Dustin Myers\n\nEXHIBIT 1\nTRO COMMUNICATIONS\n03/21/25\n\nFUDSTOP <chuckdustin12@gmail.com>\nNotice of Temporary EX-Parte TRO\n2 messages\nFUDSTOP <chuckdustin12@gmail.com> Fri, Mar 21, 2025 at 10:44 PM\nTo: Cooper Carter <coopercarter@majadmin.com>\nMs. Carter,\nPursua"}

However, if no timely request for a de novo\nhearing is filed, the statute states that \u201cthe proposed order or judgment of the associate judge becomes the\norder or judgment of the referring court only on the referring court\u2019 s signing  the proposed order or judgment.\u201d\nThus, absent a de novo appeal, an associate judge\u2019s recommendation must be signed by the district judge  to have any\nlegal effect. Until the judge signs it, it is merely a proposed order, not an actual court order.  \nBecause the February 1, 2024 temporary orders were never signed or adopted by the court, Respondent was (and is)\nunder no legal obligation to follow them, and neither party could properly enforce those terms through contempt or other\nremedies. A party cannot be held in contempt for violating a non-existent court order. Here, the \u201cAgreed Temporary\nOrders\u201d are, at most, an agreement between the parties that was not entered as a judgment. When Respondent withdrew\nhis agreement (as discussed below), even that contractual underpinning fell apart.  The Family Code\u2019s requirements were\nnot met, and thus the purported temporary orders are void ab initio  due to lack of rendition or entry by the referring\ncourt.  \nThe stage is thus set for this Court to intervene, because as of now , there is no operative temporary order governing\nthe child\u2019s conservatorship or possession .  \nThe Purported Temporary Orders Are Void and Subject to Collateral Attack in This\nSAPCR  4/12/25, 1:06 PM Gmail - Notice of Temporary EX-Parte TRO\nhttps://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ik=13839461f7&view=pt"}

However, only a void judgment is subject tocollateral attack in a separate proceeding. Browning v. Prostok, 165 S.W.3d 336, 346 (Tex. 2005)  (\u201cBrowning v.\nPlacke , 698 S.W.2d 362, 363  (Tex. 1985) \u201d)\nIn this SAPCR, Respondent is effectively collaterally attacking  the temporary orders from the divorce case by asserting\ntheir invalidity. Such a collateral challenge is permissible here because those orders are void. As the Texas Supreme\nCourt has explained, \u201cOnly a void judgment may be collaterally attacked.\u201d Id.\nAccordingly, Respondent asks this Court to formally declare that the March 26, 2024 \u201cAgreed Temporary Orders\u201d (and\nany interlocutory rulings associated with them) in Cause No. 322-744263-23 are void, of no effect, and not binding  on\nthe parties. This declaration will remove any doubt or argument by Petitioner that those terms still govern the parties\u2019\nrights. It will also foreclose any attempt to enforce or rely on those non-orders (for example, in claims of violation or in\narguing res judicata). The Court has the authority in equity and under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act (Tex. Civ.\nPrac. & Rem. Code chapter 37) to declare the rights and status of the parties vis-\u00e0-vis that prior proceeding \u2013 particularly\ngiven that the SAPCR directly concerns"}

Granting such\nrelief is appropriate to prevent confusion and multiplicative litigation. Once the prior \u201corders\u201d are declared void, this Court\ncan proceed to issue fresh temporary orders for the child without any conflict or cloud from the divorce case.  In sum, the prior temporary orders are a legal nullity and this Court should treat them as such. The Court\u2019s order declaring\nthem void will simply recognize the reality that, due to the procedural faults and lack of consent, those orders never had\nlegal existence. This clarification is critical to move forward in protecting the child\u2019s welfare, as discussed next.   \nImmediate Emergency Relief Is Necessary to Protect the Child\u2019s Best Interest \nEvery day that passes without a valid temporary order is a day of potential harm or uncertainty for the child.  The\ncurrent situation \u2013 a divorce case stuck in limbo with no operative orders, and parents in dispute \u2013 is untenable for a\nchild\u2019s well-being.

This dynamic, fueled by Petitioner\u2019s unproven allegations of family violence, has caused significant stress\nand instability for the child. Respondent fears that Petitioner is leveraging the appearance of an order to restrict his\ncontact with the child and to make unilateral decisions that are not in the child\u2019 s best interest.

Meanwhile, the divorce\nproceeding has not moved forward to a final resolution \u2013 over 12 months have elapsed since the March hearing, with no\ntrial setting in sight. This stalemate directly affects the child: there is no clear court-sanctioned framework for\nconservatorship, visitation, or support, and your client has only introduced chaos into their lives.\nThis Court, now handling the SAPCR, has both the authority and the duty to step in and provide stability . Under Tex. Fam.\nCode \u00a7 105.001, \u201cthe court may make a temporary order, including the modification of a prior temporary order, for\nthe safety and welfare of the child,\u201d including orders for temporary conservatorship and possession.\nThe Family Code specifically empowers courts to act expeditiously to protect a child: if there is immediate danger to the\nchild\u2019s physical or emotional health, the court can even issue temporary orders without notice  (such as a temporary\nrestraining order) to address the emergency. Here, Respondent asserts that the child\u2019s emotional welfare is indeed in\njeopardy. The lack of a valid order has enabled Petitioner to marginalize Respondent\u2019s role in the child\u2019s life, purportedly\nunder the guise of the void temporary orders. Petitioner\u2019s false accusations of violence \u2013 never tested or proven in court \u2013\nhave created a pretext for her to limit Respondent\u2019s access. Consequently, the child is being unjustly deprived of time and\na relationship with Respondent, who has been a loving father with no history of abuse. This scenario is precisely what\nemergency temporary orders are designed to prevent. The Court should not allow a procedural quagmire to result in a\nchild effectively losing a parent or receiving inferior care.   \nMost importantly, the \u201cbest interest of the child\u201d is the paramount consideration  in any conservatorship or\npossession decision.

The mother (divorce petitioner) could argue that\nthe original court \u201chas jurisdiction\u201d over the children by virtue of the pending divorce, so the SAPCR should not proceed\nseparately.  However, the void nature of the prior temporary orders is a game-changer. If those orders are void, then\nthe original case has not effectively adjudicated anything regarding the children\u2019s current custody or support. The SAPCR\npetitioner can contend that because the prior orders are null, there is no valid existing order or active management of the\nchildren\u2019s case, and the new court is free to act in the children\u2019s best interests. This is the EXACT argument made . In\neffect, the argument is that the divorce case\u2019s jurisdiction over the children lapsed into dormancy or \u201cdormant jurisdiction\u201d\ndue to your failure to prosecute the case.\nIt\u2019s important to distinguish jurisdiction  from orders . The continuing jurisdiction doctrine  would typically prevent a\ndifferent court from issuing orders if a final order existed or if another court was actively handling the case. But here the\nSAPCR is filed in the same county as the divorce. There is no risk of two different counties competing; it\u2019s an internal\nissue. The SAPCR effectively asks the  court to take up a new cause number  and to recognize that the old cause has\nstalled and its orders are void.  \nEVEN IF the void argument fails, there is another nuance to this area of law. Despite the lack of a final order, the\npending divorce still technically invokes the court\u2019s jurisdiction over the children. Typically, the proper course is to revive or\ndismiss  the dormant divorce, rather than maintain a wholly separate SAPCR on the side. Texas courts adhere to the\nprinciple that the first suit filed (here, the divorce) should dominate; a later-filed suit concerning the same subject (the\nchildren) can be abated to prevent conflicting rulings.

Texas law does allow a court to lose dominant jurisdiction if the\nparty with the first suit proceeded in bad faith or the suit is not actively pursued. Both apply here.

However, I must respectfully object to the assertion that this is a mandatory consolidation.\nUnder Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 174(a), consolidation is discretionary and not automatic where doing so would cause\ndelay, injustice, or prejudice to a party. Additionally, the Texas Supreme Court in Curtis v. Gibbs, 511 S.W.2d 263 (Tex.\n1974) expressly carved out exceptions to dominant jurisdiction where:\nThe original case was filed in bad faith,\nThe case isn't been prosecuted;\nEquity and justice require an independent forum.All three conditions are present here. The SAPCR was filed in good faith after the 322nd case became procedurally\nstalled and legally defective\u2014with no Notice of Remand, no evidentiary rulings on the children, and pending dispositive\nmotions including unopposed requests for dismissal. \nIt would be prejudicial to the children to consolidate a case that had no ability to proceed.\nThank you.\nRespectfully,\nCharles Dustin Myers\nPro Se Petitioner\n[Quoted text hidden]4/8/25, 11:40 AM Gmail - RE ITIO MYERS CHILDREN, CAUSE NO. 233-765358-25 CL-12105\nhttps://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ik=13839461f7&view=pt&search=all&permthi"}

She has no legal basis to subvert Petitioner's due process rights.\nIn summary, Ms. Carter has not provided anything of substance in either Court, has not prosecuted the case, has not\nargued on behalf of her client, or followed proper procedure.\nSimply labeling the opposition as pro se and claiming that the consolidation will be filed without disclosing the above facts\nis dishonest and should not be permitted as it will only cause further unnecessary delays to the relief being sought without\nany substance being provided.3/29/25, 12:09 PM Gmail - ITIO MORGAN CHILDREN, CAUSE NO. 233-765358-25 CL-12105\nhttps://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ik=13839461f7&view=pt&search=all&permthid=thread-f:1827791302409332626&simpl=msg-f"}
