The statute clearly differentiates between the local administrative judge \nand each district or statutory county court judge, granting them separate \nauthority to establish court coordinator systems and appoint court coordinators who serve at the pleasure of their respective appointing judges.  \n      The statute specifically states that \"the local administrative judge and each \ndistrict or statutory county court judge\" may establish a court coordinator \nsystem and appoint a court coordinator for their court. This language places the \nlocal administrative judge and other judges on equal footing with respect to \ncoordinator appointments, with each having independent authority to appoint \ncoordinators for their own courts. Furthermore, subsection (b) establishes that \"each court coordinator serves at the pleasure of the judge who appointed him,\" \ncreating a direct reporting relationship between the coordinator and their specific appointing judge.  \n      The distinction between a court coordinator assigned by a district judge and \nthe administrative judge is further supported by the broader statutory context. \n"}

This complementary provision shows that Texas law establishes different administrative functions within the \ncourt system, with court administrators coopera ting with various judges,\n\nincluding \"regional, presiding, and local administrative judges.\" This \ncooperative relationship would be unnecessary if the court coordinator positions \nwere not distinct from administrative judges.  While Section 75.401 addresses \ncourt administrators rather than court coordinators directly, it provides valuable context for understanding the relationships between different judicial roles and \ncourt administrative staff in the Texas court system.  \n        I n this instance, the Respondent objected to the court coordinator handling \nthe recusal proceedings who was appointed by the same District Judge  subject \nto the recusal  when the statute set for th in the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure \nspecifically designates duties to the clerk of th e court, not the coordinator . \nII. ANALYSIS  \n      In the order overruling the objection, it was stated that \u201c [t]he court \ncoordinators and clerks work together to assist the trial court judges and the \nadministrative judges. Only the judges, not the litigants, have the autho rity to \ndirect the activities of the cou rt coordinators and clerks. \u201d Here, the court \nmisapplied the rule.

This conclusion is supported by \nmultiple aspects of the statutory language: \n1. The statute separately identifies \"the local administrative judge and each \ndistrict or statutory county court judge\" as authorities who may establish \ncourt coordinator systems and appoint court coordinators.  \n2. Each judge may appoint a coordinator specifically \"for his court,\" suggesting \na one -to-one relationship between judges and the coordinators for their \ncourts.  \n3. Each court coordinator \"serves at the pleasure of the judge who appointed him,\" creating a direct accountability relationship between the coordinator and the specific appointing judge.  \n4. The complementary provisions regarding court administrators explicitly \ndistinguish between administrative judges and the courts served by \nadministrators, requiring cooperation between them.  \n    If court coordinators were not distinct from administrative judges, it would \ncreate potential conflicts in prioritization and resource allocation. A coordinator\n\nsimultaneously answerable to both a district judge and an administrative judge \nmight face competing demands, undermining the efficiency the system is designed \nto promote.  \n    Furthermore, the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure governing recusal are \nunambiguous, and designate no responsibilities  regarding recusal proce edings to be \nhandled by the coordinator.

To overrule th is objection but permit the \nassigned judge to consider that issue on a motion not before the court would cause \nfurther delay, waste judicial resources, and effectuate the exact opposite purpose of \nthe statute invoked and used to overrule the objection. (74.102(b)) By permitting \nthe coordinator to \u2018work together \u2019 with the clerks would exceed the statutory \nauthority set forth in the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\nIII. CONCLUSION  \n      In conclusion, the legal framework governing recusal motions in Texas courts \nrequires the use of clerks, not coordinators, for handling these matters. \nAdministrative judges must comply with these requirements and cannot substitute \ncoordinators for clerks i n the recusal process.   To obtain relief through a writ of \nmandamus, the relator must establish that (1) the act he seeks to compel is ministerial, rather than discretionary, in nature and (2) no other adequate remedy at law is available. Engle v. Coker, 820 S.W.2d 247 (Tex. App. \u2014Beaumont 1991, no \npet.). An act is ministerial if it constitutes a duty clearly fixed and required by law, without the exercise of discretion or judgment.  Here, the act of following the Texas \nRules of Civil Procedure regarding the re cusal process is ministerial, and \nmandamus is the app ropriate remedy to challenge the Ma y 15, 2025,  order \noverruling the Respondent \u2019s objection for the reasons state d.
