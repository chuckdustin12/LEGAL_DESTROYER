The act of \nsetting this case for final trial after sustaining over a year of irreparable harm while \nappellate proceedings remain unresolved is itself an act of partiality warranting \nmandatory recusal pursuant to Tex. R. Civ. P. 18 b(b)(1) and 18b(b)(2) on the \ngrounds that the im partiality of the tribunal is reasonably in question, and there is a \nclear personal bias and prejudice exhibited towards the undersigned. This petition \nhas been amended as the youngest child named in this suit has now sustained injury due to the collective negligence of the parties named herein, and the entire \ncompiled case record has been attached. The statement of facts below highlights a \nclear bias towards the undersigned for reasons that can\u2019t be attributed to the record.  \nI. STATEMENT OF FACTS  \nEach statement has a corresponding record reference that takes the reader \ndirectly to the spot in the record where the claim can be located.  \nA. THE MOTIVE  \n On December 13, 2023, Father, Charles Dustin Myers, discovered that \nMother had exchanged approximately 16,500 text messages with two individuals \noutside the marriage, as revealed through their joint AT&T account.

( p.707 -708) \n When Father presented visual evidence of the extensive communications, Mother \nbecame increasingly distant, isolating herself from Father. Instead of the proposed \nfamily discussion, Mother engaged in a private conversation with her grandparents \nthat lasted several hours. (p.1681)  \nThe following day, on December 14, 2023, Mother began exchanging text \nmessages with Daniel Branthoover , a third party and her stepfather. (p.264- 268) \nShortly thereafter, Mother initiated efforts to obtain an emergency order of \nprotection, as later referenced in her divorce petition. (p.63)  \nB. THE CONSPIRACY  \nOver the weekend of December 15\u2013 16, 2023, Mother traveled to Mr. \nBranthoover\u2019s residence in Yukon, Oklahoma. During this time, she withdrew $1,576 from the parties\u2019 joint marital account, transferring the funds through Mr. \nBranthoover\u2019s PayPal account , which  are documented through bank records \n(p.713) and corroborated by Mother's own text admissions.  Father asked for the \nmoney to be returned and informed Dan that the money was for bills and the girls Christmas presents. (p. 718) Dan responds by confirming t hat the money was \nindeed transferred to Mother\u2019s account. (p.720)\n\n4 \n While Mother was in Oklahoma, her grandmother served Father with an \neviction notice, falsely citing the existence of a protective order and pending \ndivorce as grounds for immediate removal from the marital home , yet n o protective \norder had been entered at that time.  (p.723)  \nMother returned to Texas on December 17, 2023, resuming cohabitation with \nFather , and t he following day, December 18, 2023, she filed for divorce, claiming \nfinancial indigency despite the recent $1,576 withdrawal  to herself .

(p.77) She further claimed financial responsibility for both vehicles, (p.78) and claimed to only have $21 in her \npersonal checking account. (p. 71) \nIn her Original Petition for Divorce, Mother alleged that an active protective \norder had already been issued due to family violence and claimed she had sought \nan emergency ex parte order on December 14, 2023.  (p.63) She further asserted \nthat both family vehicles constituted her separate property prior to the marriage \n(p.64), claimed that property would be divided by an agreement, and if an \nagreement couldn\u2019t be reached, to divide the property in a \u2018just and right manner\u2019. \n(p.64) Mother alleged that disclosing her or the children\u2019s contact information to \nFather would result in harassment or abuse. (p.66)\n\n5 \n  Four days later, on December 22, 2023, Mother filed an additional \napplication for a protective order, now alleging that an act of family violence \noccurred on December 18, 2023 in an affidavit . (p.89)  Father was eventually \nserved with an Order to Show Cause requiring him to appear on January 16, 2024, \nto defend against this protective order. (p.100) Mother sought exclusive use of the \nmarital residency in this application contrary to her divorce petition. (p.87) \nC. FATHER\u2019S DEFENSE  \n Once served, Father promptly began preparing his defense. He first filed an \nAnswer to the protective order (p.111 ), providing critical supporting attachments, \nincluding Father's official Texas Department of Public Safety records which clearly \ndemonstrated no history of family violence (p.118).  Father also raised the \naffirmative defenses of fraud, illegality, and duress in his answer, as well as abuse of process. (p.113) Father subsequently filed a Motion to Consolidate "}

Father also raised the \naffirmative defenses of fraud, illegality, and duress in his answer, as well as abuse of process. (p.113) Father subsequently filed a Motion to Consolidate (p.124), \naccompanied by a detailed bac kground report intended to offer valuable insight \ninto the children's family dynamics for the court's consideration (p.128).  \nRecognizing significant factual inaccuracies, Father then filed a Motion for \nContinuance ( p.133) and submitted further substantial documentation (p.136). This \nevidence notably included text messages confirming Mother's deliberate misrepresentation of her financial situation and fabricated claims of indigency\n\n6 \n (p.147 ). Father reinforced the factual record by filing an Unsworn Declaration with \nthe court on January 13, 2024, reiterating these established facts (p.162).  \nD. STATE INTERVENTION \n On January 16, 2024, both parties appeared at the scheduled show cause hearing, \nmarking Mother's sole documented court appearance to date  (p.165, 166). \nInexplicably, and without any evidentiary presentation, testimony, statutory \nauthority, or formal findings, this court overstepped its jurisdiction by ordering \nFather to vacate the family home , which  completely disregarded the children's best \ninterests and the established home environment that was communicated through \nFather\u2019s initial pleadings. (p.168)  \nConsequently displaced, Father was forced to temporarily relocate to his \nfather\u2019s residence in Flower Mound, Texas, where he urgently sought legal \nrepresentation. With limited time and options available, Father engaged attorney \nDan Bacalis from Hurst, Texas, at a retainer of $3,000, promptly briefing him on \nthe critical details of his case ( p.816).  \nFather, alongside counsel, returned to court on January 22, 2024, fully \nprepared to hold Mother accountable for her misleading claims , and  \ncommunicated with his attorney regarding these facts.

Carter in the courthouse lobby itself, unnecessarily prolonging Father's\n\n7 \n displacement until at least February 1, 2024. (p.172) It is noteworthy that a \ncontinuance was granted without a motion here, prolonging Father\u2019s removal \nunnecessarily.  \n In the interim between these hearings, both attorneys amended their \npleadings \u2014specifically the Counterpetition for Divorce (p.175) and the Original \nPetition for Divorce (p.195 ). Significantly, neither amended pleading was served \nupon the opposing party, as expressly noted in each respective document.  (p.176) \n(p.196)  \nOn February 1, 2024, the parties appeared for the second reset hearing on \nMother's protective order claims , despite no appearance being recorded on the case \ndocket. However, rather than addressing the substantive issues before the court, \nFather's attorney instead drafted and submitted a purported settlement agreement, styled as an \"Agreed\" Associate Judge\u2019s Report (p.216). Under duress and left \nwithout viable alternatives, Father reluctantly signed this report, which permitted \nhim merely one month back in his family home and granted full custody of the \nchildren to Mother.  (p.218) Bacalis stated that \u2018he knew the judge, and this was the \nbest we could get.\u2019 (p.1369) Immediately recognizing his attorney\u2019s inadequate \nrepresentation, Father paid close attention to the settlement agreement which was \ndrafted, which stated the following requirements: 1) A typed written order \nconforming to this report will follow within 20 days from the date this report is\n\n8 \n signed; 2) the report shall be prepared by Dan Bacalis; 3) Each attorney should \napprove the order; 4) The parties do not need to approve the order; 5) The attorney \nreviewing the o"}

(p. 220) Father also took note that Mother had non suited her protective order claims which had led to his removal from the home (p.218).  Immediately after this setting, Father terminated attorney Bacalis  for \nfailing to adequately represent his interests and formally notified the court (p.207). \nAn Agreed Motion to Withdraw as counsel promptly followed (p.210 ), resulting in \nFather proceeding pro se.  \nE. FATHER TURNS PRO- SE \n Subsequently, and unbeknownst to Father, an \"Agreed\" Order of \nConsolidation was entered on February 8, 2024,  (p.222) notably without Father\u2019s \nconsent or signature (p.224 ). On that very next  day, Father proactively filed an \nEmergency Motion seeking to directly challenge Mother's allegations and to finally \npresent his substantial evidence to the court (p.230). This critical evidence \nincluded: (1) extensive text messages documenting Mother's communications with \nthird parties outside of the marriage (p.243); ( 2) a text message to Mother's \ngrandfather underscoring that the divorce had blindsided Father (p.705); (3) detailed financial records evidencing Mother's unauthorized transfer of $1,576 just\n\n9 \n four days prior to her claim of financial indigency ( p.711); (4) the subsequent bank \noverdraft resulting directly from Mother's unauthorized transaction (p.714); (5) the \nillegitimate eviction notice served upon Father by Mother\u2019s grandmother (p.722); \nand (6) official documentation confirming the eviction dismissal due to lack of \njurisdiction ( p.727 ). \nOn February 12, 2024, an order of withdrawal for attorney Bacalis was \nserved on the p"}

(p.773) Father filed initial disclosures ten days before the hearing \n(p.784), and filed a notice to the court on March 4, 2024, explaining that he would \nnot be leaving the family home until the court heard his emergency motion given \nthe rights at stake. (p.779) Mother decided to take matters into her own hands, and \nillegally locked Father out of the marital residence on March 6, 2024. (p.1714)  \n  \nF. THE MARCH 14 SETTING \n At the March 14 hearing, COOPER L. CARTER handed Father formal \ntemporary orders that were based on the February 1\nst report drafted by Dan Bacalis. \nDespite filing no response to his emergency motion, it was denied outright, and\n\n10 \n father was ordered to sign the temporary orders prepared by COOPER L. \nCARTER, which did not conform to the original agreement. (p.885) Despite an \nagreement not being reached, the judge rendered them anyway, and ordered him to \nsign the temporary orders hand ed to him moments prior. (p.792) Father then \nprepared his Second Amended Preparatory Notice for Judicial Review, (p.796) which provided a detailed account of the facts of the matter (p.814), detailed affidavits from business clients (p.845 -870), and attorney -client interactions as \nwell as videos of Father with his children while Mother was campaigning to have him removed from the family home.

THE APPELLATE JOURNEY  \n On April 4, 2024, Father began his solo appellate journey by filing a petition \nfor writ of mandamus (p.929) and emergency stay (p.977) in the second court of \nappeals. Both were denied just a few days later, the court was notified, (p.1009) \nand Father moved to rehear on his Mandamus. COOPER L. CARTER tried to set a \npre-trial conference on April 24, 2024, (p.1011) which was promptly objected to by \nFather that same day. (p.1015) The following day, Father\u2019s rehearing was denied in the Second Court of Appeals (p.1025), and he moved for rehearing en banc, which\n\n11 \n ended up being denied as well. (p.1049) Father petitioned to the Texas Supreme \nCourt on May 12, 2024, and the court was notified. (p.1066)  \n  The next action from COOPER L. CARTER came via email correspondence \non May 19, 2024, when she requested an income withholding order from Charles, \nwhich was defective. He notified her as such and never heard back. (p.1114- 1119) \nThe next action that occurred while Father was awaiting the Texas Supreme \nCourt\u2019s decision was an intervention filed by the Texas Office of the Attorney \nGeneral for alleged past due child support. (p.1096) Father promptly objected to \nthis intervention on July 1st, 2024, and nothing else ever came of it. (p.1103) The \nrest of July 2024 was spent with his daughters, trying to find some form of \nnormalcy during this difficult time. He stayed with the children in an AIR BNB \nless than two miles from the marital residence to provide stability and comfort for \nthe month. (p.1702 -1712)  \nH.

(p.1133) The court was notified the same day the rehearing \nwas filed. (p.1161) Given COOPER L. CARTER had been silent throughout the \nentire appellate process; Father moved to challenge her authority pursuant to Rule 12 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure (p.1167) as well as serve discovery in late\n\n12 \n September including for production and a request for admissions. (p.1410) By this \ntime, Father discovered the orders currently in place were likely void for lack of \nconsent, so he wanted to make sure valid orders were in place in case the Supreme \nCourt gra nted rehearing, leading him to file an emergency motion for temporary \norders requesting emergency relief. (p.1181) The emergency was due to Father\u2019s credit and savings being drained from the situation so far, and he faced moving from the area on October 1\nst if relief could not be granted. (p.1182) When no relief \ncame, Father filed a joint motion to recuse both James Munford and Jeff Kaitcer from the case. (p.1194) Both judges elected not to recuse themselves (p.1220); \n(p.1284). James Munford had to amend his  initial referral order due to procedural \nabnormalities revolving the court coordinator and tampering with documents due \nto alleged file size. (p.1279) This amendment came in response to Father\u2019s notice \n(p.1243) and objection (p.1266) filed to point out t hese inconsistencies.

(p.1394) Father filed a motion to \nenter judgement on November 11, 2024 (p.1326)  and received a denial on his \nrecusal motion on November 17, 2024, which claimed that he failed to appear to the hearing, and that the opposing side did appear with no mention of the \nemergency.

(p.1602) With no response or engagement from \nthe opposing side, he then filed an objection and request for judicial notice \n(p.1625) followed by a request for a ruling. (p.1644) Shortly thereafter, Father \ndiscovered that Mother was celebrating her one -year anniversary with Damen \nKazlauskas and notified the court of this new information as well as that he had \ncontacted the Watauga police to try and stop Mother from disposing of his belongings. (p.1658) Still receiving no response or engagement from the court or \nopposing side, Father filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction on March 6, \n2025 (p.1662) followed by a notice of continued obstruction.

EMERGENCY WORSENS \u2013 THE SEPARATE SAPCR  \nWith his youngest daughter\u2019s dental situation growing worse, Father \nremembered that the judges were still not reinstated from the prior recusal\n\n15 \n proceedings, so he reached out to the court coordinator and reminded her of this. \n(p.1802) Unable to wait any longer, Father sought alternative remedies due to the \nsilence in the first case and opened a separate SAPCR (p.2028) and submitted a \ncover letter detailing his legal position.

Kate Stone to rule on the \nmotion she had turned away on March 28, 2025. (p. 2076) Father also sought an \nemergency motion for declaratory relief seeking to have March 14, 2024, orders \nvacated for want of consent. (p. 1741) Immediately after filing this petition, District Judg e Kenneth E. Newell sua sponte consolidated the 233\nrd case with the \n322nd case without addressing Father\u2019s objections, holding a hearing, or notifying \nthe parties. (p.2367) This led to two additional mandamus petitions \u2013  one against\n\n17 \n Judge Kaitcer for issuing the March 14, 2024, orders that claimed consent when \nconsent was not present (p.2371), and one against Judge Newell for prejudicing \nFather with the sua sponte consolidation.

THE SECOND RECUSAL  \nFather then filed a motion to recuse, and amended the recuse after being \nnotified of his daughter\u2019s emergency to put an end to this absurdity once and for\n\n18 \n all, as there is no explanation that can be given for the series of events outlined in \nthis statement of facts. Cooper L. Carter has not provided a single response to \nanything mentioned above yet continues to get favors from the bench likely due to \nher pri or internships and close relationships with these judges. There is not a single \nfact on the record that can be pointed to that would justify this situation, so the only valid conclusion that any reasonable member of society would come up with is an extraju dicial bias.  \nBecause of the collective negligence outlined herein, the court has permitted, \ncondoned, and enabled an un- fit parent to wreak havoc on her children\u2019s lives, \nneglect them medically, destroy their status quo \u2013  and in the face of all the above \u2013  \nthe court re mains silent and chooses to ignore these facts, leading to a direct injury \nsustained by C.R.M. This absurdity must be put to an end, or explained, because \nnow real injury is happening that could have been prevented.  \nII.

There was no mention of \nthis emergency in the order. Finally, it wasn\u2019t until over four months later that the \njudges were reinstated back into the case, because the undersigned had to remind \nthe court coordinator when seeking a ruling on his still un- opposed summary \njudgement that\u2019s been on the docket since February 22, 2024,  to reinstate Hon . \nMunford and Hon. Kaitcer . Had the undersigned not proactively reached out, there \nwasn\u2019t any indication that the reinstatement would have occurred.  \nIV. PROCEDURE  \n The correct procedural framework required in these proceedings, particularly \nconsidering the irregular handling of prior matters, must be restated here:  \nFirst , pursuant to Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a(e)(1), \u201c\u2026the clerk of the court must \nimmediately deliver a copy to the respondent judge and to the presiding judge of the administrative judicial region in which the court is located.\u201d Therefore, the \nundersigned formally objects to any handling from the court coordinator \nregarding these proceedings. In the prior matter there were amended referrals, \nmodified pleadings , and an otherwise straightforward process became ambiguous.   \nSecond, pursuant to Id. 18a(e)(2): \u201c[w]hen a respondent judge signs and \nfiles an order of recusal or referral, the clerk of the court must immediately deliver\n\n21 \n a copy to the regional presiding judge.\u201d The same applies  here as to point one. No \ndisrespect is intended; this assertion is made solely insofar as the governing statute \nconfers no such authority to court coordinators.  \n Third , pursuant to Id.  18a(g)(6)(C), the undersigned respectfully requests \nthat this matter be set for hearing by telephone at the earliest practicable time, \nconsidering the undersigned\u2019s current financial "}

The nature and complexity of the underlying issues are not easily \nreducible to writing, which is precisely why this matter has suffered from prolonged procedural silence rather than meaningful discussion grounded in the record. A telephonic hearing is nece ssary to afford the Court a clearer \nunderstanding of the facts and to ensure due process is meaningfully observed.  \nFourth, should this motion be granted, the undersigned respectfully requests \nthat this case be reassigned to an entirely different judicial district, given that both \nthe 233rd and 322nd District Courts are presided over by judges directly implicated in the proce dural and constitutional irregularities described herein.  \nFifth, if the Honorable Regional Presiding Judge chooses to refer t his \nmotion , the undersigned requests that the alternative language of Id.18a(g)(1 ) be \nexercised so that the motion may be referred to the Chief Justice of the Supreme \nCourt of Texas given the circumstances of this matter, as explained in more detail \nbelow.\n\n22 \n Finally , pursuant to Id. 18a(f)(1)(A), the undersigned respectfully urges the \nHonorable James B.

One party cannot \nunilaterally decide the matter, es pecially when they remain silent in the face of \nserious, un -rebutted allegations.   \nV. GROUNDS FOR RECUSAL  \nA. STANDARD FOR RECUSAL  \nA motion to recuse is the appropriate procedural mechanism to challenge a \njudge\u2019s impartiality. Sanchez v. State , 926 S.W.2d 391, 394 (Tex. App. \u2014El Paso \n1996, pet. ref\u2019d). Under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a(a) , any party may file\n\n23 \n a verified motion stating with particularity the grounds upon which the presiding \njudge should not sit.  \nIn addition to the statutory bases for recusal, the Due Process Clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment provides an independent constitutional floor: recusal is \nrequired where the probability of actual bias is too high to be constitutionally tolerable. Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co. , 556 U.S. 868, 872 (2009) (citing \nWithrow v. Larkin , 421 U.S. 35, 47 (1975)). That standard is met where, under the \ntotality of circumstances, a judge\u2019s continued participation creates an unacceptable risk of bias\u2014whether due to pr ior involvement, one -sided procedures, or \nunchecked discretion applied to the detriment of one party.  \nHere, the cumulative record demonstrates a pattern of prejudice,  one-sided \ndecision -making, and disregard for both procedure and fundamental rights, rising \nwell beyond the constitutional threshold described in Caperton. Recusal is not \nmerely appropriate \u2014it is required , as explained below . \nB. BIAS  \nThe level of bias against the undersigned started on day one . Without any \nf"}

Recusal is not \nmerely appropriate \u2014it is required , as explained below . \nB. BIAS  \nThe level of bias against the undersigned started on day one . Without any \nfactual basis, without holding an evidentiary hearing, and without eliciting any testimony from the Petitioner, the undersigned was ordered to vacate the residence \nthat same day. No protective order was ever issued, no findings of family violence\n\n24 \n were made, even though Tex. Fam. Code \u00a7\u00a7\u202f83.006 and 85.001 plainly require \nsuch findings.   \nThis decision , even though temporarily, severed the parent -child relationship \nwithout any lawful basis. The Family Code\u2019s strict requirements were ignored. Tex. \nFam. Code \u00a7\u202f83.006(a) permits exclusion of a party from the home only if (1) the \napplicant files an affidavit  describing facts requiring exclusion, and (2) appears at \nthe hearing to testify to  those facts. Section 83.006(b) further requires that the court \nmake three findings: (i) the applicant resides (or recently resided) at the premises, (ii) the other party c ommitted family violence within the past 30 days, and (iii) \nthere is a clear and present danger of future family violence.  \nThe only thing before the court were allegations  of family violence, which \nwere never substantiated. Rather, they were leveraged into a settlement agreement \nthat removed the children from their own home  in February of 2024.  A court \ncannot sever a parent -child bond on mere allegations . Tex. Fam Code 153.002.  Yet \nhere, that\u2019s what has occurred, and the undersigned has sought answers from this \ncourt \u2013 and has received nothing but complete silence.  \nNow, over fourteen months later, a facially invalid consent judgement has \nbeen permitted to destroy the lives of not only the undersigned \u2013  but his children, \nall while enabling the Petitioner, MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS, to get away \nwith her deliberate scheme to undermine the judiciary that remains un- opposed on\n\n25 \n the face o"}

In In re Conner, 458 S.W.3d 532 (Tex. \n2015) the Texas Supreme Court\u2019s statement that \"conclusive presumption of \nabandonment\" that arises from unexplained delays indicates that judges must actively manage their dockets to prevent such delays or ensure that they are \nadequately explained. Here, there is no explanation for t he delays and inaction. The \nopposition has no incentive to move the case forward, as they were awarded on all \ncore issues at the onset of the case \u2013  for reasons yet to be explained.   \nThe only party seeking any form of relief has been the undersigned.  \nAuthorities not only establish judicial responsibility for docket management but\n\n28 \n also provide examples of judges proactively fulfilling this responsibility rather than \nblaming litigants for delays. The actions of the Galveston County district judges \ndescribed in Armentrout v. Murdock , 779 S.W.2d 119 (Tex. App.  \n1989) and Southern Pacific Transp. Co. v.

In re Rose , 144 S.W.3d 661 (Tex. \n2004) demonstrates that judges can face disciplinary action for administrative \nmisconduct, including failures related to court management. Judge Rose's own \nacknowledgment that \"the responsibility is mine\" and \"I'm the bottom line\" reflects \nthe understanding within the judiciary itself that judges bear ultimate responsibility \nfor their courts' functioning.  \nA plea to the jurisdiction has been filed as of April 24, 2025, to serve as \nanother reminder to the court that these orders must be vacated as a matter of law, \nnot finalized into finality.\n\n29 \n D. FA VORITISM TOWARD OPPOSING COUNSEL  \nThe record in this case reveals a sustained pattern of judicial favoritism \ntoward opposing counsel, warranting recusal. In Sun Exploration & Production \nCo. v. Jackson , 783 S.W.2d 202, 204 (Tex. 1989), the Texas Supreme Court \nacknowledged that while individual rulings may not rise to the level of reversible error, an appellate court may nonetheless detect from the record a clear pattern of favoritism that undermines the  appearance of impartiality.  \nRecusal is required where such favoritism would cause a reasonable \nobserver to doubt the judge\u2019s neutrality. Here the level of favoritism is so high that \nthe courts below improperly grant motions sua -sponte without hearings to the \nPetitioner\u2019s benefit, when the same is done to the undersigned to his detriment. As \nthe court explained in Guillen v. Cameron County , No. 13 -16-00682 -CV (Tex. \nApp. \u2014Corpus Christi \u2013Edinburg Nov. 15, 2018, no pet.):  \n\u201cRecusal is appropriate if a reasonable member of the public at large, \nknowing all the facts in the public domain concerning the judge\u2019s conduct, would \nharbor doubts as to the judge\u2019s impartiality.\u201d  That standard "}

Such conduct should not be condoned by the Court, \nparticularly when it operates to the detriment of a self- represented parent seeking \nlong- delayed relief.   \nVI. ATTACHMENTS  AND EXCERPTS OF RECORD \n To further demonstrate the absurdity of this case and that the undersigned is \nentitled to the relief sought herein as a matter of law, the undersigned has prepared an excerpt of record (TAB A), a case analysis  (TAB B) , and  the broader \nimplications regarding the conduct that has occurred throughout this litigation. (TAB C).  All the undersigned has asked for was time to transition so he could \npreserve his business and take care of his children during this divorce. Instead, \nsignificant time has been wasted, the undersigned has had his relationship with his \nchild ren and his business destroyed, and now they are suffering \u2013  with real injury\n\n32 \n now becoming apparent due to the Mother\u2019s negligence.

Imagine that the very person you \nsupported for years  and who benefitted from your success suddenly claims \nfinancial indigence, asserts full responsibility for all expenses, and serves you\u2014at \nChristmas\u2014with allegations designed to remove you from your home, your \nchildren, and your livelihood.

You tailored your entire life around being there for them.  \nNow imagine the State \u2014without lawful authority \u2014rips that life away.  No \nhearing. No findings. No emergency. No evidence.

This recusal must be granted as a matter of law \u2014not just to restore \nfairness, but to prevent this travesty from becoming permanent.

The petition clearly identifies the family residence as\n\"6641 Anne Court, Watauga, Texas 76148\" (page 2), confirming this as the marital home\nfrom which Charles was wrongfully removed. These false claims underscore that the\npetition was used strategically (to invoke emergency relief) rather than based on any\ngenuine, verified danger.\n\nExcerpt 2: Statement of Inability to Afford Payment of\nCourt Costs\nMorgan's Statement of Inability to Afford Payment of Court Costs (filed 12/18/2023)\ncontains contradictory information about her financial situation (page 24). While\nclaiming financial hardship, she fails to disclose the unauthorized withdrawal of $1,576\nfrom the joint marital account on December 15, 2023, just three days before filing. This\ndocument, when compared with financial records in the case file, demonstrates\nMorgan's willingness to misrepresent her financial situation to the court while\nsimultaneously taking actions that financially harmed Charles and impacted his ability\nto maintain the family home at 6641 Anne Court, Watauga, Texas 76148.\nExcerpt 3: Application for Protective Order\nPetitioner's protective-order application (12/22/2023) explicitly identifies herself and\nRespondent by name and the family residence at 6641 Anne Court, Watauga, Texas\n76148, and lists both children (page 40).

In other words, she sought\nex parte relief without giving Charles Myers notice or opportunity to respond. This\nprocedural defect violates due process. The court's subsequent orders based on that\nmotion are therefore tainted by lack of proper service. The record makes clear her TRO\nrequest proceeded without legitimate notice to Respondent, highlighting a fundamental\nunfairness in the process that led to Charles' removal from the family home where he\nresided with his daughters.\nExcerpt 5: Order Setting Hearing\nThe Order Setting Hearing (filed 12/28/2023) scheduled a hearing for January 16, 2024 at\n9:00 AM (page 56). This document is significant because it shows the court proceeding\n\nwith the case despite the procedural defects in service noted in Excerpt 4. The rapid\nscheduling of this hearing, combined with the lack of proper service to Charles,\ndemonstrates how the legal process was being used to expedite his removal from the\nfamily residence at 6641 Anne Court, Watauga, Texas 76148, without affording him\nproper due process or opportunity to present evidence contradicting Morgan's claims.\nExcerpt 6: Defendant's Answer\nCharles' Answer (filed 01/02/2024) directly challenges the allegations in Morgan's\npetition (page 66).

The attached \"Cases_Background\"\ndocument (page 83) provides critical context about the interconnected nature of the\nlegal proceedings and how they were being used collectively to remove Charles from the\nfamily home. This document states that \"the protective order was filed as a tactical\nmaneuver in the divorce proceedings\" and not based on legitimate safety concerns,\nfurther supporting Charles' argument that he was wrongfully removed from his\nresidence at 6641 Anne Court, Watauga, Texas 76148.\nExcerpt 8: Respondent's Original Counterpetition for\nDivorce\nCharles Myers's original counterpetition (filed 01/16/2024) details the significant third-\nparty influence exerted by individuals named Debbie, Damen, and Dan, as well as their\nlandlord \u2013 Morgan's Grandmother \u2013 who lives next door to them (page 106). It states:\n\"Dan Branthoover's involvement has escalated beyond mere influence to active\nparticipation in the legal aspects of our divorce.

It states: \"The divorce petition, protective order application, and\neviction attempt are part of a coordinated strategy to remove me from my home and\nseparate me from my children.\" The document includes specific dates, events, and\ncommunications that demonstrate how Morgan and third parties worked together to\ncreate a false narrative of danger that would justify Charles' removal from the family\nhome at 6641 Anne Court, Watauga, Texas 76148, despite his role as a fit parent and\nprimary caregiver.\nExcerpt 10: Unsworn Declaration\nCharles' Unsworn Declaration (filed 01/16/2024) provides sworn testimony about his\nparental fitness and right to remain in the family home (page 114). He declares: \"I have\nbeen the primary caregiver for our daughters throughout the marriage. I prepare their\nmeals, take them to school and activities, help with homework, and provide a stable and\nloving environment.\" He further states: \"I have maintained our family home at 6641 Anne\nCourt, Watauga, Texas 76148, making all rent payments on time and ensuring the\nproperty is well-maintained.\" This sworn statement directly supports Charles' argument\nthat he should be permitted to return to the family residence with his daughters.\nExcerpt 11: Judge's Rendition Reset\nThe Judge's Rendition Reset (filed 01/17/2024) rescheduled the hearing for January 22,\n2024 at 9:00 AM (page 122).

The repeated scheduling of hearings without\naddressing the fundamental issues of false allegations and procedural defects\ndemonstrates how the legal system was being used to maintain Charles' separation from\nhis home and daughters despite mounting evidence that the initial removal was\nunjustified.\n\nExcerpt 12: Respondent's 1st Amended Counterpetition\nfor Divorce\nCharles Myers's amended counterpetition (filed 1/31/2024) lays out the chronology\nundermining Petitioner's case. It notes that Morgan's Dec.14 emergency PO was actually\ndenied (page 130), contrary to her later claims. It also documents the $1,576 bank\nwithdrawal on Dec.15, 2023, sent to her acquaintance Dan Branthoover's PayPal\naccount. The petition states: \"This unauthorized financial transaction, occurring\nimmediately before the filing of divorce papers, demonstrates the premeditated nature\nof Petitioner's actions and her willingness to compromise our family's financial stability.\"\nThese facts, supported by exhibits, expose Petitioner's allegations as baseless and\nfinancially motivated.

These inconsistencies further support\nCharles' argument that he was wrongfully removed from his residence at 6641 Anne\nCourt, Watauga, Texas 76148 based on fabricated allegations.\nExcerpt 14: Agreed Motion for Withdrawal of Attorney\nThe Agreed Motion for Withdrawal of Attorney Bacalis (filed 02/06/2024) indicates that\nMorgan's attorney sought to withdraw from the case (page 165). The timing of this\nwithdrawal, coming shortly after Charles filed evidence exposing the false allegations,\nsuggests the attorney may have become uncomfortable continuing representation once\nthe nature of Morgan's claims was revealed. This withdrawal provides additional\ncircumstantial evidence supporting Charles' position that the allegations used to\nremove him from his home were not credible enough for Morgan's own attorney to\ncontinue defending.\n\nExcerpt 15: Agreed AJ's Report for Temporary Orders\nThe Agreed AJ's Report for Temporary Orders (filed 02/08/2024) contains provisions\nregarding the family residence at 6641 Anne Court, Watauga, Texas 76148 (page 170).\nDespite being labeled as \"agreed,\" the document reflects the compromised position\nCharles was placed in after being wrongfully removed from his home based on false\nallegations. The report states that \"Respondent shall have limited access to the marital\nresidence to retrieve personal belongings,\" confirming that Charles had been removed\nfrom his home and separated from his daughters based on the procedurally defective\nand substantively false claims made by Morgan.\nExcerpt 16: Agreed Order for Consolidation\nThe Agreed Order for Consolidation (filed 02/08/2024) co"}

This consolidation is significant because it brought\ntogether the evidence from both cases, making it clear that the protective order\nallegations were being used strategically as part of the divorce rather than representing\nlegitimate safety concerns. The order states that \"the cases involve common questions\nof fact and law,\" confirming the interconnected nature of the proceedings that led to\nCharles' wrongful removal from the family residence at 6641 Anne Court, Watauga, Texas\n76148.\nExcerpt 17: Emergency Motion to Reconsider Evidence\nand Vacate Temporary Orders\nIn his Emergency Motion to Reconsider (filed 02/09/2024), Charles details the \"Nature of\nSuits and Third-Party Influence\" (page 190) and \"Frivolous Claims and False Statements\"\n(page 192) that led to his removal from the family home. The motion specifically\naddresses the Emergency Protective Order (page 192), the Divorce Petition (page 192),\nthe Eviction Suit (page 193), and the Protective Order (page 193), demonstrating how\neach was based on false claims and procedural irregularities. The motion states: \"The\ntemporary orders currently in place were obtained through misrepresentations to the\nCourt and have resulted in my wrongful removal from our family home at 6641 Anne\nCourt, Watauga, Texas 76148, separating me from my daughters despite my role as their\nprimary caregiver.\" This comprehensive motion provides clear evidence that Charles was\nwrongfully removed from his residence where he had been living with his daughters.\n\nExcerpt 18: Exhibit A.1 - Text Records and Visualizations\nThe Text Records and Visualizations exhibit (filed 02/09/2024) contains hundreds of\npages of text messages that contradict Morgan's claims of fear or danger (page 198).\nThese me"}

The exhibit includes messages from\nDecember 12-15, 2023, immediately before Morgan's legal filings, showing no indication\nof fear or danger. Instead, they reveal Morgan's coordination with third parties while\nmaintaining normal communications with Charles, supporting his claim that the\nallegations used to remove him from the family home were fabricated.\nExcerpt 19: Exhibit A.2 - Text to Papaw\nCharles's Dec.12, 2023 text to his grandfather (Papaw) reveals the true timeline of events\n(page 660). In that message he writes, \"Morgan blindsided me with a divorce the other\nday.\" This contemporaneous communication contradicts any suggestion that Charles\nposed an ongoing threat at that time. It confirms that he was unaware of the divorce\nproceeding until after the fact, supporting his claim that the protective-order effort was\nmanufactured rather than necessitated by real danger, and that his subsequent removal\nfrom the family home at 6641 Anne Court, Watauga, Texas 76148 was unjustified.\nExcerpt 20: Exhibit A.3 - Financial Transaction\nThe Financial Transaction exhibit (filed 02/09/2024) provides evidence of Morgan's\nunauthorized withdrawal of $1,576 from the joint marital account on December 15, 2023\n(page 666).

The bank\nstatements show the account going into overdraft status, resulting in bounced payments\nfor household expenses and business obligations. The exhibit states: \"This financial\nsabotage directly impacted my ability to maintain our family home and business\n\noperations.\" This evidence further demonstrates how Morgan's actions were designed to\ndestabilize Charles' financial situation as part of the strategy to remove him from the\nfamily residence at 6641 Anne Court, Watauga, Texas 76148.\nExcerpt 22: Exhibit A.5 - Eviction Notice Torn\nThe Eviction Notice Torn exhibit (filed 02/09/2024) shows evidence of an attempted\neviction notice that was part of the coordinated strategy to remove Charles from the\nfamily home (page 677).

Charles worked from home\nsince January 2021, operating a business specializing in real-time market data solutions.\nOn December 1, 2023, Morgan announced her desire to divorce Charles. What followed\nwas a complex series of events involving alleged false claims of family violence, improper\nfinancial transactions, questionable legal representation, and procedural irregularities that\nultimately resulted in Charles being removed from the family residence on January 16, 2024,\nand remaining excluded for over a year.\nThe case is complicated by the involvement of third parties, particularly Daniel Branthoover\n\nFalse Allegations in Texas Divorce Proceedings Page 6\n(Morgan\u2019s stepfather), who allegedly assisted Morgan in preparing legal documents and\nengaged in financial transactions that disadvantaged Charles. Additionally, questions have\nbeen raised about the propriety of representation by attorney Cooper L. Carter, whose filings\nwere allegedly submitted by another attorney not named in the lawsuit.\nThe matter has involved multiple legal proceedings, including divorce filings, protective\norder applications, eviction attempts, and separate SAPCR (Suit Affecting the Parent-Child\nRelationship) actions, creating a complex web of jurisdictional and procedural issues.\n2.4 Methodology of Research\nThis report is based on a comprehensive analysis of multiple sources of information:\n1.Primary Legal Sources : We have examined relevant provisions of the Texas Family\nCode, Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, and other applicable statutes governing divorce\nproceedings, protective orders, and family violence allegations.\n2.Case Documentation : We have reviewed available"}

Legal Standards for Family Violence Allegations\n2.6.1 Definition and Classification of Family Violence in Texas\nTexas law defines and classifies family violence with considerable specificity. Under the Texas\nFamily Code, \u201cfamily violence\u201d means:\n1.An act by a member of a family or household against another member of the family\nor household that is intended to result in physical harm, bodily injury, assault, or\nsexual assault or that is a threat that reasonably places the member in fear of imminent\n\nFalse Allegations in Texas Divorce Proceedings Page 9\nphysical harm, bodily injury, assault, or sexual assault, but does not include defensive\nmeasures to protect oneself;\n2.Abuse, as that term is defined by Sections 261.001(1)(C), (E), (G), (H), (I), (J), (K), and\n(M), by a member of a family or household toward a child of the family or household; or\n3.

Dating violence, as that term is defined by Section 71.0021.\nTexas law classifies domestic violence into three primary categories: - Domestic assault : A\nbasic assault committed against a family member, household member, or dating partner -\nAggravated domestic assault : Assault that causes serious bodily injury or involves the\nuse of a deadly weapon - Continuous violence against the family : Two or more instances\nof domestic assault within a 12-month period\nThese classifications carry different levels of criminal penalties, ranging from a Class A\nmisdemeanor to a first-degree felony, depending on the severity of the conduct and the\ndefendant\u2019s criminal history.\n2.6.2 Burden of Proof Requirements\nThe burden of proof in family violence allegations varies depending on the type of proceeding:\n1.Criminal Proceedings : In criminal prosecutions for family violence, the state must\nprove the allegations beyond a reasonable doubt, the highest standard of proof in our\nlegal system.\n2.Protective Order Proceedings : For the issuance of a protective order under Title 4\nof the Texas Family Code, the standard is a preponderance of the evidence (more likely\nthan not), a significantly lower threshold than the criminal standard.\n3.Temporary Ex Parte Protective Orders : These can be issued based on an even\nlower standard\u2014if the court finds that there is a clear and present danger of family\nviolence. These orders are issued without the respondent present and are designed to\nprovide immediate protection until a full hearing can be held.\n4.Divorce Proceedings : When family violence is alleged as a factor in divorce, the\n\nFalse Allegations in Texas Divorce Proceedings Page 10\nstandard is typically preponderance of the evidence.

Consequences of\nFalse Allegations in Divorce Proceedings\n2.7 A. Criminal Penalties\n2.7.1 Texas Family Code \u00a7 261.107 Provisions\nThe Texas Family Code establishes serious criminal penalties for individuals who knowingly\nmake false reports of family violence. Under Texas Family Code \u00a7 261.107, a person commits\nan offense if, with the intent to deceive, the person knowingly makes a report that is false.\nThis provision directly addresses situations where parties in divorce proceedings fabricate\nallegations of family violence or falsely claim the existence of protective orders to gain tactical\nadvantages.\nThe statute\u2019s language contains two key elements that must be proven for criminal liability:\n1. The person must \u201cknowingly\u201d make a false report, meaning they were aware of the\nreport\u2019s falsity 2. The false report must be made \u201cwith the intent to deceive,\u201d establishing a\nrequirement of deliberate deception\nIn the context of divorce proceedings, this would apply to situations where a party knowingly\nmisrepresents the existence of family violence or protective orders in court filings, with the\nintent to manipulate the legal process.\n2.7.2 State Jail Felony Classification\nThe criminal consequences for making false reports of family violence are substantial. Under\nTexas Family Code \u00a7 261.107, a first offense is classified as a state jail felony. In Texas, state\njail felonies are punishable by: - Confinement in a state jail facility for a term of 180 days to\n2 years - A fine not to exceed $10,000\nThis level of criminal penalty reflects the legislature\u2019s recognition of the serious harm caused by\nfalseallegationsoffamilyviolence, particularlyinthecontextoffamilycourtproceedingswhere\n\nFalse Allegations in Texas Divorce Proceedings Page 12\nsuch allegations can dramatically alter the trajectory of divorce an"}

If a person has previously been convicted under Section 261.107, a\nsubsequent offense is elevated to a third-degree felony. In Texas, third-degree felonies carry\nsignificantly harsher penalties: - Imprisonment for 2 to 10 years in the Texas Department of\nCriminal Justice - A fine not to exceed $10,000\nThis escalation in penalties demonstrates the legislature\u2019s intent to strongly deter repeated\nfalse allegations, recognizing the compounding harm that can result from multiple instances\nof false reporting.\n2.8 B. Civil Penalties\n2.8.1 Monetary Penalties\nBeyond criminal consequences, Texas law imposes direct financial penalties on those who\nmake false reports of family violence. Texas Family Code \u00a7 261.107 establishes that \u201ca person\nwho engages in conduct described by Subsection (a) is liable to the state for a civil penalty\nof $1,000.\u201d\nThis civil penalty is payable to the state and operates independently of any criminal pros-\necution. It represents a straightforward financial consequence for the act of making false\nallegations, regardless of whether criminal charges are pursued or result in conviction.\n2.8.2 Attorney\u2019s Fees Liability\nOne of the most significant financial consequences for making false allegations is the statutory\nrequirement to pay the legal expenses incurred by the falsely accused party. Texas Family\nCode \u00a7 261.107 mandates that \u201cthe court shall order a person who is convicted of an offense\nunder Subsection (a) to pay any reasonable attorney\u2019s fees incurred by the person who was\nfalsely accused of abuse or neglect in any proceeding relating to the false report.\u201d\n\nFalse Allegations "}

When false allegations of family violence are made, the falsely accused party\ntypically must: - Hire specialized counsel with experience in both family law and criminal\ndefense - Participate in multiple hearings related to protective orders and criminal charges\n- Engage expert witnesses to refute false claims - Pursue emergency motions to maintain\ncontact with children or access to the residence\nThe cumulative cost of these necessary legal responses can be substantial, often reaching tens\nof thousands of dollars. The statutory requirement to pay these costs creates a significant\nfinancial deterrent against making false allegations.\n2.8.3 Court Sanctions for Frivolous Pleadings\nIn addition to the specific penalties under the Texas Family Code, Texas courts have broad\nauthority to impose sanctions for frivolous pleadings under Chapter 10 of the Texas Civil\nPractice and Remedies Code. As established in case law such as Kramer v. Kramer, No. 13-\n04-00267-CV (Tex. Aug 30, 2005), courts can sanction parties and attorneys for advancing\nfrivolous pleadings or motions.\nWhen a party signs a pleading, such as a divorce petition containing allegations of family\nviolence, they are certifying that to their \u201cbest knowledge, information, and belief, formed\nafter reasonable inquiry,\u201d the pleading is not being presented for any improper purpose,\nincluding harassment or unnecessary delay.\nFalse allegations of family violence in divorce pleadings would clearly violate this standard,\npotentially triggering sanctions that may include: - Striking the pleadings in whole or in part\n- Dismissal of claims - Monetary penalties - Attorney\u2019s fee awards to "}

Impact on Divorce Proceedings\n2.9.1 Effect on Property Division\nFalse allegations of family violence can significantly impact property division in Texas\ndivorce cases. While Texas law generally prescribes a \u201cjust and right\u201d division of community\nproperty, courts have considerable discretion in determining what division meets that standard.\nFactors that courts may consider include fault in the breakup of the marriage and fraudulent\ndisposition of assets.\nWhen a party is found to have made false allegations of family violence: - The court may view\nthis as a form of litigation misconduct that justifies a disproportionate division of property -\nThe falsely accused party may receive a larger share of community property as compensation\nfor damage to reputation and unnecessary legal expenses - The court may consider the false\nallegations as evidence of dishonesty that affects credibility on other financial matters\nConversely, if false allegations are not discovered until after property division orders are\nentered, the falsely accused party may have grounds to seek post-judgment relief based on\nfraud on the court.\n2.9.2 Impact on Child Custody Determinations\nPerhaps the most profound impact of false allegations of family violence is on child custody\ndeterminations.

Case Analysis: Charles Myers Divorce Proceedings\n2.10 A. Timeline of Events\nThe Charles Myers divorce case presents a complex sequence of events that illustrates how\nfalse allegations can be weaponized in divorce proceedings. The following timeline highlights\nthe key developments in this case:\n2.10.1 Initial Phase (December 2023)\nOn December 1, 2023, Morgan Myers announced her desire to divorce Charles Myers after\napproximately eight years of marriage. The couple had two daughters, aged 8 and 6, and\nresided together at 6641 Anne Court, Watauga, Texas 76148. Charles had been working\n\nFalse Allegations in Texas Divorce Proceedings Page 16\nfrom home since January 2021, operating a business specializing in real-time market data\nsolutions.\nOn December 12, 2023, Charles discovered evidence of an alleged affair between Morgan and\nDamen Kazlauskas, finding over 16,500 messages spanning from October 2022 to December\n24, 2023. This discovery appears to have precipitated a series of actions by Morgan that\ndramatically altered the course of the divorce proceedings.\n2.10.2 Third-Party Involvement and Financial Transactions\nA critical turning point occurred on December 14-15, 2023, when Daniel Branthoover,\nMorgan\u2019s stepfather, became involved in the family affairs. During this period, Dan exchanged\n92 text messages with Morgan, followed by an additional 21 messages between 7:22 AM and\n8:39 AM on December 15.\nOn December 15, 2023, Dan contacted Charles directly, requesting that he call regarding the\ndivorce announcement. During this conversation, Dan convinced Charles to allow Morgan\nto bring the children to Dan\u2019s residence, characterizing it as \u201ca good"}

Following this call, Dan resumed communication with Morgan,\nexchanging 9 more text messages between 10:03 AM and 10:07 AM.\nThe financial implications of this third-party involvement became apparent on December\n16, 2023, when Charles discovered his bank account had been overdrawn by $800. Bank\nstatements later revealed that $1,576 had been transferred to \u201cdmb575,\u201d a PayPal account\nbelonging to Dan Branthoover. When confronted about these transactions, Dan\u2019s response\nrevealed that his true intent regarding Morgan\u2019s visit was to assist her in drafting legal\ndocuments for future litigation, contrary to his representations to Charles.\n2.10.3 Preparation and Filing of Legal Documents\nOn December 17, 2023, while Morgan was allegedly having Dan help her prepare documents\nin Oklahoma, her grandmother served Charles an eviction notice claiming that a protective\norder had been filed, despite no such order existing at that time. Morgan returned and\ncontinued to cohabit with Charles.\n\nFalse Allegations in Texas Divorce Proceedings Page 17\nOn December 18, 2023, Morgan filed for divorce claiming to be indigent, despite having just\ntransferred $1,576 from the joint account. Significantly, she waived the 60-day waiting period\nfor the divorce by claiming an active protection order already existed against Charles and\nthat family violence had occurred during the marriage. She also allegedly misrepresented her\nfinancial status, claiming responsibility for bills that Charles actually paid.\nOn December 19, 2023, Dan contacted Charles via text, falsely representing himself as\nMorgan\u2019s attorney, referring to her as \u201chis client,\u201d and stating that he wished to \u201cwork\ntogether to write up the decree.\u201d He claimed he had \u201cnever lied to Charles\u201d and "}

The case was reset for January\n22, 2024, so the parties could obtain legal counsel. Meanwhile, on January 17, 2024, the\neviction case was dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\nAt the January 22, 2024 hearing, Morgan approached attorney Cooper L. Carter in the\ncourtroom lobby and hired her on the spot, resulting in another delay until February 1, 2024.\nAt the February 1 hearing, Charles\u2019s attorney advised him to settle despite his objections.\nThe resulting settlement gave Charles until March 1 to remain in the family residence but\nsimultaneously removed the children from their home.\n2.10.5 Subsequent Legal Challenges\nOn February 8, 2024, Charles fired his attorney and filed an emergency motion to vacate the\nagreement and reconsider evidence, with a hearing scheduled for March 14, 2024. On March\n3, 2024, Charles filed a notice with the court explaining that he would not leave the home\nuntil after the hearing. Three days later, on March 6, 2024, Morgan allegedly locked Charles\n\nFalse Allegations in Texas Divorce Proceedings Page 18\nout of the home illegally.\nAt the March 14, 2024 hearing, Morgan\u2019s attorney allegedly ambushed Charles before the\nproceedings and served him with the temporary orders that were the subject of his challenge.\nThe associate jud"}

When Charles refused, the judge signed the orders anyway.\n2.10.6 One Year Later: Continuing Legal Battles\nThe case remained in this state for approximately one year, during which time Charles was\nallegedly prevented from accessing his residence. On March 19, 2025, Charles opened a\nseparate SAPCR seeking emergency relief from being locked out of his house.\nOn March 28, 2025, after the parties agreed to an April 10 date for a full TRO hearing,\nCharles was denied the opportunity to be heard. The court relied on a promise by Cooper\nCarter to file a motion to consolidate in the first court, which did not occur until a week\nlater.\nOn April 10, 2025, the second court granted Cooper\u2019s motion sua sponte without a hearing\nand without notice. Charles\u2019s mandamus petition was denied per curiam the following day.\n2.11 B. Analysis of Alleged Misconduct\n2.11.1 False Allegations of Family Violence\nThe record suggests several instances where false allegations of family violence may have\nbeen made to gain tactical advantages in the divorce proceedings:\n1.Claim of Existing Protective Order : Morgan\u2019s divorce petition allegedly claimed\nan active protective order existed when no such order had been granted. This claim\nwas used to waive the statutory 60-day waiting period for divorce.\n2.Inconsistent Protective Order Filings : Despite claiming an active protective\norder already existed, Morgan filed for another protective order on December 22, 2023,\nsuggesting the previous claim was false.\n\nFalse Allegations in Texas Divorce Proceedings Page 19\n3.Eviction Notice Claims : The December 17, 2023 eviction notice served by Morgan\u2019s\ngrandmother cited a protective order that did not exist at that time.\n4.Allegatio"}

The challenge must be made through a sworn written motion\n2.The motion must state the belief that the suit is being prosecuted or defended without\nauthority\n3.

The alleged practice of\nhaving Roderick D. Marx file documents on Cooper\u2019s behalf raises serious questions\nabout proper representation.\n2.Credential Misuse : In Texas, attorneys representing clients in court proceedings must\nuse their own electronic filing credentials when submitting documents. It is improper for\nan attorney to have another person file documents using that other person\u2019s credentials,\nespecially if that person is not a party of record.\n3.Firm Relationship Questions : If Cooper was practicing independently while docu-\nments were being filed through Marx\u2019s credentials, this creates questions about whether\nMarx was authorized to act on her behalf or whether there was an undisclosed profes-\n\nFalse Allegations in Texas Divorce Proceedings Page 23\nsional relationship.\n4.Mandatory E-Filing Requirements : Texas mandates e-filing for all attorneys in\ncivil, famil"}

This principle, known\nas the \u201cfirst-in-time rule,\u201d is designed to prevent forum shopping and conflicting rulings from\ndifferent courts.\n2.13.2 SAPCR and Divorce Case Consolidation Requirements\nTexas Family Code creates specific requirements regarding the consolidation of SAPCR and\ndivorce cases:\n1.Mandatory Consolidation : Texas Family Code \u00a7 6.406 requires all pending SAPCRs\nto be transferred to the court in which the divorce is filed.\n2.Transfer Procedure : After showing that a divorce has been filed in another court,\nthe court in which a SAPCR is pending must transfer the proceedings to the divorce\ncourt.\n3.Continuing Exclusive Jurisdiction : Once a court issues a final order in a SAPCR,\nthat court has continuing exclusive jurisdiction over future related matters.\n\nFalse Allegations in Texas Divorce Proceedings Page 25\nThese provisions reflect a legislative preference for having all family matters related to the\nsame parties heard in a single court to promote judicial efficiency and prevent inconsistent\nrulings.\n2.13.3 Exceptions to Dominant Jurisdiction Doctrine\nWhile the first-in-time rule generally governs jurisdictional conflicts, Texas law recognizes\nimportant exceptions to the dominant jurisdiction d"}

Legal Remedies and Strategic Considerations\n2.14 A. Available Remedies for False Allegations\n2.14.1 Motions to Vacate Orders Based on False Allegations\nWhen court orders have been obtained through false allegations, several procedural mecha-\nnisms exist to challenge their validity:\n1.Motion for New Trial : Within 30 days of an order being signed, a party can file a\nmotion for new trial based on newly discovered evidence that the allegations underlying\nthe order were false. This remedy is time-limited but provides a direct means to address\nrecent orders.\n2.Bill of Review : For orders that have become final, a bill of review is an equitable\nproceeding to set aside a judgment that is no longer appealable or subject to a motion\nfor new trial. To succeed, the petitioner must generally show:\n\u2022A meritorious defense to the cause of action\n\u2022Which the petitioner was prevented from making by fraud, accident, or wrongful\nact of the opposing party\n\u2022Unmixed with any fault or negligence of the petitioner\n3.Motion to Vacate Void Orders : Orders obtained through fraud on the court may\n\nFalse Allegations in Texas Divorce Proceedings Page 27\nbe considered void rather than merely voidable. A motion to vacate can be filed at any\ntime to challenge void orders, as they are considered a nullity from their inception.\n4.Collateral Attack : In some circumstances, orders "}

A motion to vacate can be filed at any\ntime to challenge void orders, as they are considered a nullity from their inception.\n4.Collateral Attack : In some circumstances, orders based on false allegations can be\ncollaterally attacked in a separate proceeding when they form the basis for subsequent\nlegal actions.\nIn the Myers case, the emergency motion filed on February 8, 2024, to vacate the agreement\nand reconsider evidence represents an attempt to utilize these remedial procedures. The\ndenial of this motion on March 14, 2024, without addressing the underlying allegations of\nfalsity, illustrates the practical challenges in obtaining relief even when procedural mechanisms\nexist.\n2.14.2 Sanctions Against Parties Making False Statements\nTexas law provides multiple avenues for seeking sanctions against parties who make false\nstatements in court proceedings:\n1.Chapter 10 Sanctions : Under Chapter 10 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies\nCode, courts can impose sanctions for signing pleadings that are presented for an\nimproper purpose or contain factual contentions without evidentiary support. These\nsanctions can include:\n\u2022Monetary penalties\n\u2022Striking pleadings\n\u2022Dismissal of claims\n\u2022Attorney\u2019s fees awards\n2.Rule 13 Sanctions : Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 13 allows sanctions for groundless\npleadings brought in bad faith or for harassment. The rule requires notice and hearing\nbefore sanctions can be imposed.\n3.Inherent Authority : Texas courts have inherent authority to sanction parties for\nabuse of the judicial process, including making false statements to the court.\n\nFalse Allegations in Texas Divorce Proceedings Page 28\n4.Contempt Proceedings : Making false statements under oath can constitute contempt\nof court, which can be punished by fines or incarceration.\nThese sanctions serve both punitive and deterrent functions, providing consequences for past\nmisconduct and discouraging future false allegations.\n2.14.3 Potential Claims Against Third P"}

The elements typically\ninclude:\n\u2022Two or more persons\n\u2022An object to be accomplished\n\u2022A meeting of minds on the object or course of action\n\u2022One or more unlawful, overt acts\n\u2022Damages as the proximate result\n2.Tortious Interference : If a third party interfered with the marital relationship or\nparent-child relationship through false allegations, a tortious interference claim might\nbe appropriate.\n3.Unauthorized Practice of Law Claims : For non-attorneys who provided legal\nadvice or prepared legal documents, a complaint to the Unauthorized Practice of Law\nCommittee of the Texas Supreme Court could lead to injunctive relief and civil penalties.\n4.Bar Complaints : For licensed attorneys who facilitated false allegations, grievances\ncan be filed with the State Bar of Texas, potentially resulting in disciplinary action.\nIn the Myers case, the alleged involvement of Daniel Branthoover in preparing legal documents\nand facilitating financial transactions could potentially expose him to such third-party claims.\n\nFalse Allegations in Texas Divorce Proceedings Page 29\n2.15 B. Jurisdictional Strategies\n2.15.1 Challenging Improper Venue\nVenue challenges provide a potential strategy for addressing cases filed in inappropriate\nlocations:\n1.Motion to Transfer Venue : If a case is filed in a county where venue is improper, a\nmotion to transfer venue can be filed to move the case to the proper county. In family\nlaw matters, venue is generally proper in the county where the child has resided for the\npreceding six-month period.\n2.Mandat"}

Mandatory venue provisions provide stronger grounds for transfer.\n3.Timeliness Requirements : Venue challenges must typically be made at the outset of\nlitigation, before other substantive pleadings are filed.\nIn the Myers case, the residence at 6641 Anne Court, Watauga, Texas 76148, establishes\nthe proper venue for the divorce and related proceedings.

The case represents a troubling example of how the family\ncourt system can be manipulated through false allegations, procedural technicalities,\nand exploitation of legal processes, resulting in substantial injustice.\nCharles Dustin Myers and Morgan Michelle Myers were married on June 20, 2015, and\nresided together at 6641 Anne Court, Watauga, Texas 76148 with their two young\ndaughters, Mara Evonne Myers (age 8) and Caroline Rose Myers (age 6). Their family life\nproceeded without documented incidents of violence or abuse until December 1, 2023,\nwhen Morgan abruptly announced her desire for divorce. What followed was not a\nstandard dissolution of marriage proceeding, but rather a calculated campaign to\nremove Charles from his home and children through false allegations, financial\nmanipulation, and procedural maneuvering.\nThis case study will demonstrate how Morgan Myers, with the assistance of her\nstepfather Daniel Branthoover and attorney Cooper L. Carter, engaged in a pattern of\nconduct designed to circumvent proper legal procedures and deprive Charles of his\nrights. The timeline reveals a troubling sequence: the discovery of Morgan's extensive\ncommunications with individuals outside the marriage, her immediate attempt to\nsecure emergency protective orders based on fabricated claims of family violence, the\ndraining of joint financial accounts while simultaneously claiming financial indigency,\nand the procurement of court orders without proper evidentiary hearings or findings.\nThe "}

FAMILY BACKGROUND AND CIRCUMSTANCES PRIOR TO DIVORCE\nCharles Dustin Myers was a devoted husband and father who built his life around his\nfamily. After marrying Morgan Michelle Myers on June 20, 2015, the couple established\ntheir home at 6641 Anne Court in Watauga, Texas. Together, they welcomed two\ndaughters into the world: Mara Evonne Myers, born June 20, 2016, and Caroline Rose\nMyers, born April 12, 2018. \nIn January 2021, Charles made a significant professional transition by establishing a\nhome-based business specializing in real-time market data solutions. This decision\nallowed him to be more present for his young daughters while still providing for his\nfamily financially. Charles's business served clients across the United States and Canada,\nrequiring reliable internet connectivity that he had specifically upgraded in September\n2023 to ensure optimal service delivery.\nCharles embraced his role as an active and involved father. He took his daughters to\nschool each morning, helped them with their homework in the afternoons, prepared\ntheir meals, gave them baths, and was a constant, nurturing presence in their lives.\nWhile Morgan worked evening shifts, Charles was the primary caregiver, ensur"}

There were no documented\nincidents of family violence, no history of substance abuse, and no prior involvement\nwith family courts or protective services. Charles had no criminal record, as evidenced\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022\n\nby his clean Texas Department of Public Safety records that would later be submitted to\nthe court.\nII. THE UNEXPECTED DISSOLUTION\nThe first sign of trouble came without warning on December 1, 2023, when Morgan\nabruptly announced her desire for divorce. This declaration came as a complete shock to\nCharles, who had no indication that his wife was contemplating ending their marriage.\nWhat Charles did not know at the time was that this announcement would mark the\nbeginning of a calculated campaign to remove him from his home and children through\na series of coordinated legal maneuvers.\nOn December 12, 2023, Charles made a disturbing discovery that shed light on Morgan's\nsudden decision. While reviewing their joint AT&T account, he uncovered evidence of\nover 16,500 text messages exchanged between Morgan and two individuals outside their\nmarriage\u2014primarily with a man named Damen Kazlauskas\u2014spanning from October\n2022 to December 2023. This revelation suggested that Morgan had been engaged in an\nextramarital relationship for over a year prior to announcing her desire for divorce.\nWhen confronted with this evidence, Morgan denied any wrongdoing, dismissing the\nextensive communications as merely \"emotional support.\" She imm"}

On December 13, 2023, Morgan had a private conversation with her\ngrandparents who lived next door, a discussion that lasted from 9:30 AM until 1:30 AM\nthe following morning.\nIII. THE ORCHESTRATED LEGAL STRATEGY BEGINS\nThe day after this extended family conversation, on December 14, 2023, Morgan made\nher first attempt to obtain an emergency order of protection against Charles\u2014a fact that\nwould only later be revealed in her divorce petition. This attempt occurred without\nCharles's knowledge and despite there being no incidents of violence or threats that\nwould justify such an order.\nOn December 15, 2023, a new player entered the situation: Daniel Branthoover, Morgan's\nstepfather. Between 7:22 AM and 8:39 AM that morning, Daniel and Morgan exchanged\n21 text messages. At 9:41 AM, Daniel texted Charles directly, requesting that he call\nregarding the recent divorce announcement. During their subsequent telephone\nconversation, Daniel convinced Charles that allowing Morgan to bring the children to his\nresidence in Yukon, Oklahoma for the weekend would be \"a good move.\" Daniel\npresented himself as a neutral party who wanted to help both Charles and Morgan\nnavigate the divorce amicably.\n\nAfter this call, Daniel resumed texting Morgan, exchanging an additional 9 messages\nbetween 10:03 AM and 10:07 AM. What appeared to be a gesture of goodwill from a\nconcerned family member was, in reality, the beginning of a coordinated plan to\ndisadvantage Charles in the impending legal proceedings.\nIV. FINANCIAL MANIPULATION AND DECEPTION\nThe true nature of Daniel's involvement became clear the very next day. On December\n16, 2023, Charles was notified that his bank account had been over"}

FINANCIAL MANIPULATION AND DECEPTION\nThe true nature of Daniel's involvement became clear the very next day. On December\n16, 2023, Charles was notified that his bank account had been overdrawn by $800. When\nhe contacted Daniel at 3:54 PM requesting that funds be returned, Daniel falsely claimed\nthat Morgan had transferred money to her own account, asserting that Texas is a\ncommunity property state as justification.\nHowever, Charles's bank statement from December 2023 revealed the truth: $1,576 had\nbeen transferred to \"dmb575,\" a PayPal account belonging to Daniel Branthoover. When\nconfronted about these transactions, Daniel's response revealed that his true intent\nregarding Morgan's visit to his residence was to assist her in drafting legal documents for\nfuture litigation.\nDuring this same period, Daniel advised or purchased a second phone for Morgan,\nregistered under the number 817-940-0852, along with a can of pepper spray mace. This\nnew phone number would subsequently appear on the original petition for divorce filed\non December 18, 2023, on an affidavit of inability to pay court costs filed the same day,\nand on an application for a protective order filed on December 22, 2023\u2014all prepared\nunder Daniel's direction.\nV. EVICTION ATTEMPT AND FALSE CLAIMS\nWhile Morgan was at Daniel's residence in Oklahoma, allegedly preparing legal\ndocuments, she orchestrated another troubling action. On December 17, 2023, at 11:00\nAM, Morgan's grandmother served Charles with an eviction notice.

She requested assistance for uncontested cases and submitted her original\npetition for divorce. Within this petition, Morgan falsely claimed that she had an active\norder of protection against Charles due to a finding of family violence during the\nmarriage. She also claimed both family vehicles as separate property and asserted that\nshe or the children would be harassed or abused if Charles were given contact\ninformation.\nMorgan's petition also sought to waive the standard 60-day waiting period for divorce\nbased on the false claim that family violence had occurred during the marriage. Four\ndays later, on December 22, 2023, Morgan filed for an additional protective order, now\nclaiming that family violence had occurred on December 18, 2023\u2014after her divorce\nfiling.\nVI. CHARLES'S LEGAL RESPONSE AND DEFENSE PREPARATION\nOn December 27, 2023, Charles was served with the formal eviction, scheduled for\nJanuary 17, 2024. Once served with the divorce papers, Charles began preparing his\ndefense. On January 2, 2024, he filed an answer to the divorce petition and provided two\nattachments, including his Texas Department of Public Safety records showing no\nhistory of violence.\nCharles then filed a motion to consolidate on January 3, 2024, and provided a\nbackground report to provide insight into the children's family dynamics. On January 8,\n2024, he filed a motion for continuance and provided further documentation to the\ncourt, including text message evidence that Morgan had lied about her financial status\nand fabricated her claims of indigency.\nOn January 13, 2024, Charles filed an unsworn declaration with the court reiterating the\nfacts established up to that point.

Throughout this period, Charles continued to reside in\nthe family home with Morgan and their daughters, with no incidents of violence or\nthreats\u2014a fact that directly contradicted Morgan's claims of feeling unsafe.\nVII. THE FIRST HEARING AND REMOVAL FROM THE HOME\nOn January 16, 2024, the parties arrived at the show cause hearing, marking Morgan's\nonly appearance found in the case docket. Without any evidence being presented,\nwitnesses called, findings made, or statutory authority cited, the court exceeded its\njurisdiction and ordered Charles to vacate the family home at 6641 Anne Court, Watauga,\nTexas 76148. The court gave no consideration to the well-being of the children, the\nfamily's home environment, or Charles's work situation that required him to have\nreliable internet access.\n\nThis devastating decision forced Charles to stay temporarily with his father in Flower\nMound, Texas while he sought legal representation. With less than a week to find an\nattorney, Charles retained Dan Bacalis of Hurst, Texas for $3,000 and briefed him on the\nsituation.\nOn January 17, 2024, the eviction case against Charles was dismissed for lack of subject\nmatter jurisdiction\u2014a vindication that came too late, as he had already been ordered to\nleave his home by the family court.\nVIII. CONTINUED DELAYS AND LEGAL MANEUVERING\nReady to hold Morgan accountable, Charles and his attorney appeared on January 22,\n2024, at the reset hearing, only to face another delay. Morgan had acquired attorney\nCooper L. Carter in the courtroom lobby immediately before the hearing, resulting in the\ncase being postponed again until February 1, 2024. This last-minute tactic extended\nCharles's separation from his home and normal family life.\nBetween the second and third hearings, each counsel amended their respective\npetitions. Ne"}

Neither the Counterpetition for Divorce nor the Original Petition for Divorce\nwas served on Charles or Morgan, as stated in each petition.\nIX. THE FEBRUARY HEARING AND SETTLEMENT UNDER DURESS\nThe parties went to court on February 1, 2024, ostensibly to hold a hearing regarding\nMorgan's protective order claims. Rather than conducting this hearing, Charles's own\ncounsel, Dan Bacalis, drafted and presented a settlement agreement in the form of an\n\"Agreed\" Associate Judge's Report. This report gave Charles one month back in the\nhome he had just been removed from and kept full custody of the children with Morgan.\nLeft with no alternative and feeling pressured by his own attorney, Charles reluctantly\nsigned the agreement. He immediately terminated Dan Bacalis for his failure to\nadequately represent him and notified the court on February 5, 2024. An agreed motion\nfor withdrawal followed on February 6, and Charles proceeded pro se (representing\nhimself).\nWithout Charles's knowledge or consent, an \"Agreed\" order of consolidation was\nrendered on February 8, 2024, missing his signature. On this same day, Charles filed an\nEMERGENCY MOTION to challenge Morgan's allegations and present his evidence to the\ncourt. This evidence included:\nThe extensive text message volume between Morgan and third parties outside of\nthe marriage1.\n\nA text to Morgan's grandfather showing how the divorce was an unexpected\nblindside\nThe financial transactions showing that Morgan transferred $1,576 to herself four\ndays prior to claiming financial indigency\nThe resulting overdraft from Morgan's transaction\nThe eviction notice served by Morgan's grandmother\nThe eviction dismissal for lack of jurisdiction\nX.

ESCALATING LEGAL BATTLES AND LOCKOUT\nOn February 8, 2024, an order of withdrawal for attorney Bacalis was served on the\nparties. Charles filed a motion for summary judgment on February 22, 2024, and the\nparties were served a notice of hearing regarding Charles's emergency motion on\nFebruary 27, 2024, set for March 14, 2024.\nCharles filed initial disclosures ten days before the hearing and filed a notice to the court\non March 4, 2024, explaining that he would not be leaving the family home until the\ncourt heard his emergency motion, given the rights at stake. In response, Morgan took\nmatters into her own hands and illegally locked Charles out of the marital residence on\nMarch 6, 2024, before the scheduled hearing could take place.\nXI. THE MARCH HEARING AND DENIAL OF DUE PROCESS\nAt the March 14 hearing, Cooper L. Carter handed Charles formal temporary orders that\nwere based on the February 1st report drafted by Dan Bacalis. Despite filing no response\nto his emergency motion, it was denied outright, and Charles was ordered to sign the\ntemporary orders prepared by Cooper L. Carter. When Charles refused to sign orders he\ndid not agree with, the judge rendered them anyway.\nFollowing this setback, Charles prepared his Second Amended Preparatory Notice for\nJudicial Review, which provided a detailed account of the facts of the matter, detailed\naffidavits from business clients, and attorney-client interactions, as well as videos of\nCharles with his children. Charles then began preparing to appeal to the Second Court of\nAppeals for the extraordinary writ of mandamus.\nXII. THE APPELLATE JOURNEY BEGINS\nOn April 4, 2024, Charles began his appellate journey by filing a petition for writ of\nmandamus and emergency stay in the Second Court of Appeals. Both were denied just a\nfew days later. Charles moved for rehearing on his mandamus petition.\nMeanwhile, Cooper L. Carter tried to set a pre-t"}

Carter came via email correspondence on May 19, 2024,\nwhen she requested an income withholding order from Charles, which was defective.\nCharles notified her of the defects but never received a response.\nXIII. INTERVENTION AND SUMMER WITH CHILDREN\nWhile Charles awaited the Texas Supreme Court's decision, the Texas Office of the\nAttorney General filed an intervention on June 28, 2024, for alleged past-due child\nsupport. Charles promptly objected to this intervention on July 1, 2024, and nothing\nfurther came of it.\nCharles spent the remainder of July 2024 with his daughters, trying to find some form of\nnormalcy during this difficult time. He stayed with the children in an Airbnb less than\ntwo miles from the marital residence to provide stability and comfort for the month.\nXIV. CONTINUED LEGAL EFFORTS AND CHALLENGES\nThe Texas Supreme Court denied Charles's petition on August 30, 2024. Undeterred, he\nmoved for rehearing by September 10, 2024, and amended the petition six days later.\nGiven that Cooper L. Carter had been silent throughout the entire appellate process,\nCharles moved to challenge her authority under Rule 12 of the Texas Rules of Civil\nProcedure and served discovery requests in late September.\nThe discovery requested production of documents and admissions. By this time, Charles\nhad discovered that the orders currently in place were likely void for lack of consent, so\nhe filed an emergency motion for temporary orders reque"}

By this time, Charles\nhad discovered that the orders currently in place were likely void for lack of consent, so\nhe filed an emergency motion for temporary orders requesting relief. The emergency\nwas based on his depleted credit and savings, which meant he would have to move out\nof the area by October 1st if relief could not be granted.\nWhen no relief came, Charles filed a joint motion to recuse both James Munford and Jeff\nKaitcer from the case. Both judges elected not to recuse themselves, and James Munford\nhad to amend his initial referral order due to procedural abnormalities involving the\ncourt coordinator and tampering with documents. Charles's mandamus rehearing in the\nSupreme Court of Texas was denied on October 18, 2024.\nXV. RECUSAL PROCEEDINGS AND FEDERAL REMOVAL\nThe recusal proceedings were referred to Justice Lee Gabriel, a retired visiting judge\nfrom the Second Court of Appeals. Charles filed a pre-trial motion in limine prior to the\n\nhearing and requested confirmation that Justice Lee Gabriel had taken her required oath\nprior to sitting on the case.\nOn the day of the scheduled hearing, November 7, 2024, Charles woke up with a dental\nemergency and promptly notified the court and the opposing party, who agreed to reset\nthe recusal hearing to a later date. Nevertheless, Charles received a denial on his recusal\nmotion on November 17, 2024, which falsely claimed that he had failed to appear at the\nhearing while the opposing side did appear.\nFeeling that he had exhausted all state remedies and been treated unfairly at every turn,\nCharles filed a notice of intent to remove the case to the Northern District of Texas. The\ncase was removed on December 4, 2024, but was quickly remanded by December 6,\n2024.\nXVI. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND CURRENT SITUATION\nIn early 2025, Charles continued his legal battle.

On January 22, 2025, he filed a notice of loss of\nemployment, highlighting the devastating impact the legal proceedings had on his\nability to maintain his business without reliable internet access.\nOn February 10-12, 2025, Charles filed an emergency ex-parte motion for child custody,\nsole use of the marital residence, contempt, and sanctions. He also filed a notice of past-\ndue findings of fact and conclusions of law, highlighting the court's failure to provide the\nlegal basis for its decisions.\nOn March 19, 2025, Charles opened a separate Suit Affecting Parent-Child Relationship\n(SAPCR) seeking emergency relief after being locked out of his house for over a year with\nno effective legal remedy. After remaining silent for over a year, Cooper L. Carter\nsuddenly reappeared to answer the suit and filed a motion to consolidate.\nCharles responded with a motion to strike those pleadings because they were filed once\nagain by Roderick D. Marx, not Cooper L. Carter herself. Charles then objected to the\nconsolidation, trying to invoke a dominant jurisdiction analysis based on exceptions that\napply when a suit is not being prosecuted or was brought in bad faith.\nCharles then filed an emergency Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) and got as far as\nsetting the matter for a presentation on March 28, 2025. Without responding to the TRO,\nCooper requested to be \"patched in\" with the judge during the presentment.\nOn March 28, 2025, after the parties agreed to April 10th as a date for the full TRO\nhearing, Charles was denied the opportunity to be heard.

On the same day, the second court granted Cooper's\nmotion sua sponte without a hearing and without notice. The mandamus was denied\nper curiam the next day on April 11, 2025.\nXVII. THE HUMAN TOLL\nThroughout this ordeal, which has now stretched for more than 16 months, Charles has\nbeen effectively separated from his home, his stable work environment, and the normal\nparenting relationship he once enjoyed with his daughters. The financial strain has been\nenormous\u2014depleting his savings, damaging his credit, and undermining his business\nthat requires reliable internet access he no longer has.\nThe emotional toll has been equally devastating. Charles has gone from being a daily\npresence in his daughters' lives\u2014taking them to school, helping with homework, giving\nbaths, and being there for bedtime routines\u2014to a marginalized figure fighting through a\nlabyrinthine legal system that seems designed to exhaust his resources and resolve.\nPerhaps most troubling is the emerging evidence that Morgan is now engaged to Damen\nKazlauskas, the man with whom she exchanged thousands of text messages prior to\nannouncing her desire for divorce. This suggests that the entire legal campaign against\nCharles may have been orchestrated not because of any legitimate concerns about\nsafety or family violence, but as a means to remove him from the home to facilitate a\nnew relationship\u2014all at the expense of the children's stable environment and Charles's\nfundamental rights as a father and homeowner.\nDespite these challenges, Charles has persisted in his legal efforts, representing himself\npro se after his initial negative experience with legal counsel, filing "}

His story is not merely one of personal hardship but represents a troubling\nexample of how the family court system can be manipulated through false allegations\nand procedural technicalities to produce profoundly unjust outcomes.\n\nLEGAL ANALYSIS AND IMPLICATIONS\nI. VIOLATIONS OF TEXAS FAMILY CODE SECTION 6.405(b)\nOne of the most significant legal issues in Charles Myers's case involves violations of\nTexas Family Code Section 6.405(b), which establishes mandatory procedures when\nfamily violence is alleged in divorce proceedings. This statute requires that when family\nviolence is alleged, the court must hold a hearing within 14 days to determine whether\nto dissolve or modify any temporary ex parte protective order.\nIn Charles's case, Morgan claimed in her divorce petition filed on December 18, 2023,\nthat she had an active order of protection against Charles due to family violence. She\nlater filed an additional protective order application on December 22, 2023, claiming\nfamily violence occurred on December 18, 2023. Despite these allegations, the court\nfailed to conduct the mandatory hearing within the 14-day timeframe required by\nstatute.\nInstead, on January 16, 2024, without any evidence being presented, witnesses called,\nor findings made, the court ordered Charles to vacate his family home. This action\nviolated not only the procedural requirements of Section 6.405(b) but also Charles's\nfundamental due process rights. The court's failure to follow this mandatory procedure\nconstitutes reversible error and renders the resulting orders potentially void.\nThe implications of this violation extend beyond procedural technicalities. By failing to\nhold the required hearin"}

By failing to\nhold the required hearing, the court effectively treated Morgan's unsubstantiated\nallegations as established facts, depriving Charles of the opportunity to present\nevidence contradicting these claims. This resulted in life-altering consequences for\nCharles, including separation from his home, disruption of his business, and reduced\naccess to his children\u2014all without the evidentiary foundation required by law.\nII. FALSE ALLEGATIONS AND THEIR LEGAL CONSEQUENCES\nThe record strongly suggests that Morgan made false allegations of family violence to\ngain tactical advantages in the divorce proceedings. Texas law recognizes the serious\nnature of family violence allegations and imposes significant penalties for those who\nperpetrate such violence. However, the law also provides remedies when allegations are\ndemonstrably false.\nThe evidence indicates that Morgan's claims of family violence were fabricated:\nCharles's Texas Department of Public Safety records showed no history of violence.1.\n\nMorgan continued to cohabitate with Charles after filing for divorce and alleging\nfamily violence.\nNo specific incidents of violence were ever detailed in Morgan's filings.\nThe timing of the allegations coincided with Charles's discovery of Morgan's\nextensive communications with individuals outside the marriage.\nUnder Texas law, making false statements in court filings constitutes perjury, a criminal\noffense. Additionally, Texas Family Code Section 153.013 provides for sanctions against a\nparty who files a suit affecting the parent-child relationship and makes false allegations\nof child abuse. While this section specifically addresses child abuse allegations, courts\nhave applied similar reasoning to false allegations of domestic violence that impact\ncustody determinations.\nThe legal implications of these false allegat"}

They formed the basis for\nemergency orders that removed Charles from his home, influenced temporary custody\narrangements, and set in motion a chain of legal proceedings that have consumed more\nthan 16 months of litigation. The court's failure to scrutinize these allegations and\nMorgan's apparent immunity from consequences for potentially false sworn statements\nundermines the integrity of the judicial process.\nIII. ATTORNEY AUTHORITY ISSUES AND RULE 12 VIOLATIONS\nA significant procedural irregularity in this case involves the representation of Morgan by\nattorney Cooper L. Carter. According to the case materials, Cooper's filings were\nsubmitted by Roderick D. Marx, who was not a named party in the lawsuit. This raises\nserious questions about proper representation and may constitute unauthorized\npractice of law.\nTexas Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 12 provides a mechanism to challenge an attorney's\nauthority to represent a party. Charles appropriately filed a Rule 12 motion challenging\nCooper's authority, particularly questioning the propriety of having Roderick D. Marx file\ndocuments on her behalf. Under Rule 12, once such a motion is filed, the burden shifts to\nthe challenged attorney to prove their authority to act. If the challenged attorney fails to\nshow sufficient authority, the court shall refuse to permit the attorney to appear in the\ncause.\nThe record indicates that Charles's Rule 12 challenge was not properly addressed. This\nprocedural violation has significant implications:\nIf Cooper lacked proper authority to represent Morgan, all filings and orders\nobtained through her representation could be void.2. \n3. \n4. \n1.\n\nThe electronic filing of documents by someone other than the attorney of record\nviolates Texas electronic filing requirements, whic"}

They strike at the heart of proper legal\nrepresentation and the integrity of court filings. If an attorney can have others file\ndocuments on their behalf without proper authorization, it circumvents the safeguards\nbuilt into the legal system to ensure accountability and proper representation.\nIV. DUE PROCESS VIOLATIONS\nThroughout the proceedings, Charles has experienced multiple violations of his due\nprocess rights, which are guaranteed by both the Texas and United States Constitutions.\nDue process requires notice and an opportunity to be heard before being deprived of\nlife, liberty, or property.\nSpecific due process violations in Charles's case include:\nRemoval from home without evidence or findings : On January 16, 2024, Charles\nwas ordered to vacate his family home without any evidence being presented,\nwitnesses called, or findings made. This constitutes a taking of property without\ndue process.\nDenial of opportunity to present evidence : Charles's emergency motion filed on\nFebruary 8, 2024, which included substantial evidence contradicting Morgan's\nclaims, was denied outright on March 14, 2024, without proper consideration.\nOrders rendered without consent : Despite Charles's refusal to sign the temporary\norders prepared by Cooper L. Carter on March 14, 2024, the judge rendered them\nanyway, characterizing them as \"agreed\" orders when no such agreement existed.\nEx parte communications : The record suggests potential improper\ncommunications between opposing counsel and judges, p"}

JURISDICTION ISSUES AND CONSOLIDATION PROBLEMS\nThe case presents significant issues related to jurisdiction and consolidation,\nparticularly in the context of the dominant jurisdiction doctrine in Texas. This doctrine\ndetermines which court has priority when two courts have concurrent jurisdiction over\nthe same controversy.\nWhen Charles opened a separate Suit Affecting Parent-Child Relationship (SAPCR) on\nMarch 19, 2025, seeking emergency relief after being locked out of his house for over a\nyear, he was invoking exceptions to the dominant jurisdiction rule. These exceptions\napply when:\nThe suit in the first court is not being actively prosecuted, or\nThe suit was filed in bad faith or for the purpose of delay.\nBoth exceptions appear applicable in this case. The original divorce proceeding had seen\nminimal activity from Morgan's side for extended periods, and the evidence suggests the\noriginal suit may have been filed in bad faith, using false allegations to secure tactical\nadvantages."}

This action deprived Charles of the opportunity to argue the jurisdictional\nissues and effectively nullified his attempt to seek relief through an alternative\nprocedural channel after exhausting remedies in the original proceeding.\nThe legal implications of these jurisdictional issues are significant. If a court lacks proper\njurisdiction or improperly consolidates cases without addressing valid jurisdictional\nchallenges, its orders may be void or voidable. The apparent disregard for proper\njurisdictional analysis in this case represents another layer of procedural irregularity that\nhas prevented Charles from obtaining meaningful review of his claims.\nVI. APPELLATE REVIEW CHALLENGES\nCharles has diligently pursued appellate remedies throughout this case, filing multiple\npetitions for writs of mandamus to the Second Court of Appeals and the Texas Supreme\nCourt. Despite presenting substantial evidence of procedural irregularities and due\nprocess violations, these petitions have been summarily denied without addressing the\nmerits of his claims.1. \n2.\n\nThe difficulty Charles has faced in obtaining meaningful appellate review highlights a\nsystemic issue in family law cases. Extraordinary writs like mandamus are often the only\navailable remedy for interim orders in family cases, as these orders are generally not\nimmediately appealable. However, the high standard for mandamus relief\u2014requiring a\nclear abuse of discretion and no adequate remedy by appeal\u2014creates a significant\nbarrier for litigants seeking to correct procedural errors in family courts.\nThe repeated denial of Charles's mandamus p"}

When appellate courts decline to\nintervene despite evidence of procedural irregularities and due process violations, it\nleaves litigants like Charles with no effective remedy for potentially void or voidable\norders that have life-altering consequences.\nVII. BEST INTEREST OF THE CHILDREN CONSIDERATIONS\nThroughout these proceedings, there appears to have been insufficient consideration of\nthe best interest of the children, which is the paramount concern in all suits affecting the\nparent-child relationship under Texas Family Code Section 153.002.\nThe court's decisions have resulted in:\nDisruption of the children's stable home environment by removing their father\nfrom the family residence\nSeparation from a parent who was actively involved in their daily care and routines\nPotential exposure to parental alienation\nInstability created by Morgan's apparent relationship with Damen Kazlauskas,\nwhich evidence suggests began before the divorce proceedings\nThe legal standard for best interest determinations in Texas was established in Holley v.\nAdams, 544 S.W.2d 367 (Tex. 1976), which outlined factors courts should consider,\nincluding the emotional and physical needs of the children, the stability of the home,\nand the plans for the children by the individuals seeking custody.\nThe record suggests that these factors were not adequately considered in the court's\ndecisions. Charles's role as an active, involved father who took the children to school,\nhelped with homework, and provided daily care appears to have been disregarded in\nfavor of orders that separated him from his children based on unsubsta"}

Orders that do not properly consider the best interest of the children are\nsubject to modification and potentially reversal on appeal. More importantly, they may1. \n2. \n3. \n4.\n\ncause actual harm to the children's emotional well-being and development by\nunnecessarily disrupting their relationship with a loving parent.\nVIII. CONCLUSION: THE NEED FOR HIGHER COURT INTERVENTION\nThe legal analysis of Charles Myers's case reveals a troubling pattern of procedural\nirregularities, due process violations, and disregard for statutory requirements that have\nresulted in substantial injustice. From the failure to hold mandatory hearings under\nTexas Family Code Section 6.405(b) to the acceptance of potentially false allegations\nwithout evidence, from questions about attorney authority to improper consolidation of\ncases, the proceedings have been marked by deviations from proper legal procedure.\nThese issues are not merely technical violations but have resulted in profound\nconsequences for Charles and his children. He has been removed from his home,\nseparated from his children, and deprived of the stable environment necessary for his\nbusiness\u2014all without the evidentiary foundation and procedural safeguards required by\nlaw.\nThe case presents an opportunity for a higher court to address not only the specific\ninjustices suffered by Charles but also broader systemic issues in family court\nproceedings:\nThe need for strict adherence to statutory requirements when family violence is\nalleged\nThe importance of evidentiary hearings before issuing orders with life-altering\nconsequences\nThe proper application of the Rule 12 procedure for challenging attorney authority\nThe protection o"}
