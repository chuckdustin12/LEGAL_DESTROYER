By intentionally instigating and manipulating \nlegal proceedings, Branthoover has de monstrated a blatant disregard for lawful \nprocesses and the Plaintiff\u2019s rights.  \nIn this instance, Branthoover\u2019s actions went beyond legal disputes, extending \nto mocking and harassing the Plaintiff after destroying his livelihood.

Defendant\u2019s conduct as detailed in this complaint includes actions that \nconstitute violations of Oklahoma Statute \u00a721- 453, which criminalizes the \npreparation of false evidence with intent to present it as genuine in legal \nproceedings. Here, this is exactly what occurred when Defendant assisted Wife in \nthe preparation of her original petition for divorce which claimed an active order of protection existed against Plaintiff, and which was filed claiming Wife to be \nindigent. Defendant knew these statements  were false as by his own admission he \nfacilitated the transfer of $1,576 to her account. \n32. These documents were prepared in Yukon, Oklahoma, and then \nsubmitted to the 322\nnd District Court of Tarrant County, Texas, who relied on the \ndocuments to Plaintiff\u2019s detriment.

Defendant's selective disclosure to the Plaintiff about the discussions \nsurrounding the divorce, while concealing his significant involvement in drafting \nlegal documents for the Wife, constitutes deceit under element 3 of 76 OK Stat \u00a7 \n3(3).

Plaintiff had a legal right to the funds in the joint PNC bank account, \nincluding the specific sum of $1,576, as joint marital property.  \n36. Defendant knowingly and intentionally exercised unauthorized control \nover these funds by directing the transfer of $1,576 to his PayPal account  on \nDecember 15, 2023.\n\n37. Defendant\u2019s actions deprived Plaintiff of the use and benefit of these \nfunds, causing financial harm, including an overdraft of $800, the loss of $1,576, \nthe discontinuation of certain business advertising, and prevented him from getting \nhis children Christmas gifts as he had planned to purchase over the weekend.  \n38.

By knowingly and intentionally \ndirecting the transfer of $1,576 from the joint marital account to his PayPal account \nwithout Plaintiff\u2019s consent, Branthoover deprived Plaintiff of his rightful possession \nand control over the funds, completing the tort of conversion as described in Russell.  \nCOUNT FOUR:  INTENTIONAL INFLICTION OF EMOTIONAL \nDISTRESS  \nDefendant acted intentionally and recklessly, his conduct was extreme and \noutrageous, Plaintiff has suffered actual damages from this conduct, Plaintiff \nexperienced emotional distress, and that the emotional distress was \nsevere.

Paragraphs 1 through 29 are incorporated herein by reference.  \n  \n 41. Defendant\u2019s conduct constitutes intentional infliction of emotional \ndistress as defined in the Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 46 (1965), which states\n\nthat \u201cone who by extreme and outrageous conduct intentionally or recklessly \ncauses severe emotional distress to another is subject to liability for such \nemotional distress.\u201d. Defendant\u2019s conduct was both intentional and reckless, as the \nfraudulent documents prepared by him lead to the loss of Plaintiff\u2019s business, \nhome, and the custody of this Children.  \n 42. After Plaintiff suffered these losses, Defendant continued to harass the \nPlaintiff by texting him throughout the proceeds he helped initiate , calling him \n\u201cpathetic\u201d and stating that he has \u201cenjoyed watching every filing get denied\u201d.

Further, Defendant knew that father operated his business out of his \nresidency, and by playing a crucial role in his removal, knew that financial \ndamages would occur as a result.   \n 44. Finally, Defendant inflicted severe emotional distress on Plaintiff by \nassisting in the act of up-ending his life by influencing his marriage to its\u2019 \ndetriment, helping sever the close relationship he had with his children, and \nhelping in the destruction of Plaintiff\u2019s business he had built to provide for his\n\nfamily, causing reckless financial and emotional harm that has been ongoing since \nhis involvement.  \nDAMAGES  \nDefendant\u2019s actions alleged herein have caused significant and irreparable \nharm to Plaintiff, who is entitled to damages  compensatory and special \ndamages as a matter of law.  \n \n 45.

The annual transaction revenue dropped from $26,514.94  in 2023 \nto $15,099.78 in 2024, resulting in a loss of $11,415.16 over that period. \n50.

If the court determines that a \njury trial is required to adjudicate punitive damages, the Plaintiff requests that the \ntrial be bifurcated. Specifically, the Plaintiff seeks a preliminary bench trial to \nresolve issues of liability, compensatory damages, and special damages. Upon \nresolution of those matters, the Plaintiff requests a subsequent jury trial to \ndetermine punitive damages in accordance with \u00a723-9.1  if required by law.  \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF\n\n\n\nEXHIBIT 1\nAT&T TEXT MESSAGE \nRECORDS FROM \nPHONE# 817-507-6562\n\nAT&T\nPhone Number: 8172355189\nTotals for billing period: 290 Incoming | 191 Outgoing\nDate Contact Type Description\n12/15/2023 9:07 214.577.1485 INCOMING Mobile to Mobile\n12/15/2023 9:07 214.577.1485 INCOMING Mobile to Mobile\n12/15/2023 9:04 Dhanoolal INCOMING Mobile to Mobile\n12/15/2023 8:54 Dhanoolal OUTGOING Mobile to Mobile\n12/15/2023 8:47 madelyn OUTGOING Mobile to Mobile\n12/15/2023 8:43 madelyn OUTGOING Mobile to Mobile\n12/15/2023 8:25 Dhanoolal INCOMING Mobile to Mobile\n12/15/2023 8:23 Dhanoolal OUTGOING Mobile to Mobile\n12/15/2023 8:22 Dhanoolal INCOMING Mobile to Mobile\n12/15/2023 8:18 817-507-6562 INCOMING Mobile to Mobile\n12/15/2023 8:18 Dhanoolal OUTGOING Mobile to Mobile\n12/15/2023 8:17 Dhanoolal INCOMING Mobile to Mobile\n12/14/2023 23:18 damen INCOMING Mobile to Mobile\n12/14/2023 23:13 debbie OUTGOING Mobile to Mobile\n12/14/2023 23:13 damen OUTGOING Mobile to Mobile\n12/14/2023 23:06 debbie OUTGOING Mobile to Mobile\n12/14/2023 23:06 damen OUTGOING Mobile to Mobile\n12/14/2023 22:44 damen INCOMING Mobile to Mobile\n12/14/2023 22:37 damen OUTGOING Mobile to Mobile\n12/14/2023 22:37 debbie OUTGOING Mobile to Mobile\n12/14/2023 22:35 damen INCOMING Mobile to Mobile\n12/14/2023 22:29 debbie INCOMING Mobile to Mobile\n12/14/2023 22:29 debbie OUTGOING Mobile to Mobile\n12/14/2023 22:29 damen OUTGOI"}
