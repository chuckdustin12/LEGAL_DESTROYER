BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY \n1.  On April 28, 2025, Respondent Charles Dustin Myers filed his \"FIRST AMENDED \nMOTION TO RECUSE\" (hereinafter \"Amended Recusal Motion\"). This Amended Recusal \nMotion specifically sought the recusal of the Honorable James Munford, presiding judge of the  \nIN THE INTEREST OF M.E.M., C.R.M., two \nchildren)  \nMORGAN MICHELLE MYERS  \n  \n  \nPetitioner,   \n  \n  \nCHARLES DUSTIN MYERS,  OBJECTION TO ORDER OF \nASSIGNMENT DATED MAY 6, 2025  \n  \nRespondent.   \n  \n  \n2025 -05-06\n\n2 \n 322nd District Court, based upon grounds detailed therein and pursuant to Texas Rule of Civil \nProcedure 18b. \n2. Crucially, the Amended Recusal Motion filed on April 28, 2025, named only the \nHonorable James Munford as the judge whose recusal was sought. It did not seek the recusal of \nthe Honorable Jeffrey Kaitcer.  \n3. Prior to the issuance of the Order of Assignment, on April 29, 2025, Respondent filed \nan \"OBJECTION \u2013 RECUSAL PROCEDURE.\" Exhibit A. This objection explicitly brought to \nthe attention of the Eighth Administrative Judicial Region that, among other procedural irregularities, the Honorable Jeffrey Kaitcer was being improperly implicated in recusal \nproceedings related to the Amended Recusal Motion, as said motion did not name him. The objection highlighted that any action by Judge Kaitcer concerning the Amended Recusal Motion (which did not seek his recusal) was procedurally incorrect and suggested that the motion itself had not been substantively reviewed before such erroneous actions "}

Subsequently, on May 6, 2025, the Presiding Judge of the Eighth Administrative \nJudicial Region issued the Order of Assignment. This Order assigns the Honorable John H. Cayce to preside in and rule on:  \ni.  \"the Motion to Recuse the Honorable James Munford and the Honorable Jeffrey Kaitcer filed by Charles Dustin Myers on April 25, 2025\" and  \nii. \"the First Amended Motion to Recuse the Honorable James Munford and the Honorable Jeffrey Kaitcer filed on April 28, 2025.\" \u2013 Exhibit B  \n 5.  Despite Respondent\u2019s objections, the Court Coordinator for the 322nd District Court \nhas continued to be involved in the administrative handling and communication regarding these recusal proceedings.\n\n3 \n II. ARGUMENT AND AUTHORITIES  \nThe Order of Assignment dated May 6, 2025, is procedurally defective and based on a \nfundamental mischaracterization of the pending Amended Recusal Motion, particularly as it \npertains to the Honorable Jeffrey Kaitcer.  \n1. Mischaracterization of the Operative Pleading  \nThe Order of Assignment incorrectly states that the \"First Amended Motion to Recuse... \nfiled on April 28, 2025\" sought the recusal of both Judge Munford and Judge Kaitcer. This is factually incorrect. The Amended Recusal Motion filed by Respondent on that date sought only the recusal of Judge Munford.  \n2. Violation of TRCP 18a Requirements  \n     i. Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a(a) governs the filing of a motion to recuse. It \nrequires that such a motion \"must be verified and must state with particularity the grounds why the judge should be recused or disqualified and the specific provision of Rule 18b or other law relied on.\"  \n     ii. A motion to recuse is specific to the judge whose recusal is sought. If the Amended \nRecusal Motion did not name Judge Kaitcer, t"}

A motion to recuse is specific to the judge whose recusal is sought. If the Amended \nRecusal Motion did not name Judge Kaitcer, then there was no valid, pending motion seeking Judge Kaitcer\u2019s recusal before the Presiding Judge of the Administrative  Judicial Region upon \nwhich an assignment could be based.  \n     iii. Under TRCP 18a(f)(1), it is the \"respondent judge\" (the judge whose recusal is sought \nin a filed motion) who must either recuse or refer the motion. If Judge Kaitcer was not the respondent judge in the Amended Recusal Motion, he had no authority to take any action regarding that specific motion . \n     iv. Consequently, any referral or assignment based on the premise that the Amended \nRecusal Motion targeted Judge Kaitcer is without proper foundation under TRCP 18a.\n\n4 \n 3.  Improper Involvement of Court Coordinator in Recusal Process  \n     i. Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a meticulously details the procedural steps for recusal \nand disqualification of judges. TRCP 18a(e) specifically assigns duties related to the handling \nand delivery of recusal motions, responses, and orders of recusal or referral to the **\"clerk of the \ncourt.\"  \n     ii. TRCP 18a(e)(1) states: \"When a motion or response is filed, the **clerk of the court** \nmust immediately deliver a copy to the respondent judge and to the presiding judge of the administrative judicial region...\"  \n     iii. TRCP 18a(e)(2) states: \"When a respondent judge signs and files an order of recusal \nor referral, the **clerk of the court** must immediately deliver a copy to the regional presiding judge.\"  \n     iv. Significantly, TRCP Rule 18a makes no mention of the \"court coordinator\" and assigns \nno duties, responsibilities, or authority to a court coordinator in the recusal or disqualification \nprocess. The rule is explicit in its assignment of these administrative tasks to the \"clerk of the \ncourt.\"  \n     v. The legal principl"}

The rule is explicit in its assignment of these administrative tasks to the \"clerk of the \ncourt.\"  \n     v. The legal principle of expressio unius est exclusio alterius (the express mention of one \nthing excludes all others) suggests that where a procedural rule details the roles of specific court personnel (the clerk) and omits others (the court coordinator), the omitted personnel do not have an official, mandated role in that specific process under that rule.  \n     vi. The continued handling of any aspect of this recusal proceeding by the Court \nCoordinator, particularly after Respondent has objected to such involvement, is therefore outside the procedural framework established by TRCP 18a and is improper. Such actions us urp the\n\n5 duties explicitl y assigned to the clerk of the court and can compromise the neutrality and \nintegrity o f the recusal pr ocess. \n4. Prior  Objection  Put Region  on N otice\nThe \"OBJECTION \u2013 R ECUSAL PROCEDURE\" filed by Respondent on April 29, 2025, \nexplicitly no tified  the Administrative Region  of the e rror regarding  Judge  Kaitcer\u2019s in volvement \nbefore the Order of Assignment was issue d. The subsequent issuance of the Order of Assignment, \nwhich perpetuates this error by incorrectl y including Judge Kaitcer as a subject of the Amended \nRecusal Motion, demonstrates that the prior objection a nd the contents of the Amended R ecusal \nMotion itself may not have been fully considered . This failure to addr ess a clearly  articulated \nprocedural defect unde rmines the integrity and due process of the recusal procedure outlined in \nTRCP 18a. \n5.

THE CORRECT RECUSAL PROCEDURE\nT he Texas Rules of Civil Procedure are clear . Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a lays out the proper  \nprocedure that shall be followed when a motion to recuse is filed. Id. (e) sets forth the Duties of \nthe Clerk, which amount to delivering the motion or response Id. (e)(1), and the delivery of the  \norder of recusal or referral. Id. (e)(2).

ISSUE  \n There are two significant procedural errors that must be immediately addressed.  \nFirst , Rule 18a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure does not authorize or delegate any \nresponsibility for handling recusal matters to the court coordinator. Despite an explicit and timely \nobjection to the coordinator's involvement outlined within the pending recusal motion itself, the coordinator continues to improperly manage and influence the referral process. This unauthorized participation represents a fundamental procedural violation that undermines the neutrality and integrity of the recusal proceedings.  \nSecond, the involvement of Hon. Jeffrey Kaitcer in the current referral is entirely \nimproper and unnecessary, as the current motion for recusal specifically and explicitly names only Hon. James Munford as the respondent judge. While the current motion does refer ence a \nprior joint recusal motion historically \u2014where Hon. Kaitcer was previously named \u2014that \nreference is strictly contextual and does not constitute a renewed or active request for his recusal at this juncture. The plain language and explicit identification in the current motion leave no \nreasonable ambiguity that the recusal "}

The plain language and explicit identification in the current motion leave no \nreasonable ambiguity that the recusal sought at present involves only Judge Munford. Therefore, Judge Kaitcer\u2019s unilateral decision to decline recusal and issue a referral, despite no pending recusal against him, is procedu rally incorrect and strongly suggests the motion itself was not \nreviewed substantively before action was taken.  \nThese procedural missteps \u2014the continued improper involvement of the court coordinator \nand the erroneous implication of a second judge \u2014constitute clear violations of Rule 18a, \ncompromise the impartiality required by judicial ethics, and further evidence tha t due diligence \nwas not exercised in considering the motion as filed .\n\nIII. APPLICATION OF LAW  \n A trial court has no discretion in determining what the law is or applying the law to the \nfacts even when the law is unsettled.  In re Prudential, 148 S.W.3d at 135. Consequently, a clear \nfailure by  the trial court to analyze or apply the law correctly will constitute an abuse of \ndiscretion.  Walker v Packer , 827 S.W.2d at 840 (Tex.1992). Here, the continuous disregard for \nthe undersigned\u2019s pleadings, the Texas Constitution, the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, and the \nTexas Family Code has resulted in cumulative and severe harm: a minor child has sustained preventable injury due solely to j udicial inaction; the Petitioner continues to evade adjudication \ndespite credible, unrefuted, and well -documented allegations of fraud; and opposing counsel \u2014\nwho has never substantively responded to any pleading nor demonstrated her authority to act pursuant to Rule 12\u2014continues to receive judicial favor, undermining fundamental due process protections.

Moreover, this \nconduct demonstrates an unacceptable level of bias: a judge who was never implicated in the present recusal motion has inexplicably involved himself without justification, the court coordinator improperly continues to perform roles for which she has no lawful authority, and Texas law is repeatedly misapplied, consistently to the detriment of the undersigned and his children. This troubling pattern of behavior erodes public trust, compromises judicial integr ity, \nand necessitates immediate corrective action .\n\nIV . CONCLUSION \nThe issues necessitating this recusal  are precisely the errors and procedural misconduct \noutlined herein. The Court has repeatedly issued perfunctory orders lacking any substantive legal \nexplanation, mirroring the persistent silence and inaction of the opposing counsel. No valid legal justifi cation has been offered to explain the sustained disregard for the Texas Rules of Civil \nProcedure, the Texas Family Code, and fundamental principles of due process.
