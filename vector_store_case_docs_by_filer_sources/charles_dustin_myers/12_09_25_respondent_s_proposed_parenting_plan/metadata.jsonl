CONCLUSION ...................................................................................................... 22-23\n\n4 \n I. INTRODUCTION  \n \n1. Morgan Michelle Myers has not demonstrated that she can act in the best interests of the \nchildren because her conduct \u2014including making unsubstantiated abuse allegations, obstructing \nthe children\u2019s relationship with their father, and engaging in litigation tactics that undermine \nstability and truthfulness \u2014contravenes the statutory and judicial standards that define a parent\u2019s \nability to serve the children\u2019s welfare. Texas law and case authority require credible evidence and a demonstrated commitment to st ability, co -parenting, and honesty, all of which are lacking in \nher actions as documented in the record.  \n2. Texas law mandates that the best interests of the child are the primary consideration in all \nconservatorship and access decisions, emphasizing stability, frequent and continuing contact with both parents, and the avoidance of unnecessary restrictions unles s credible evidence of danger \nexists. The record in this case shows that Morgan Michelle Myers has repeatedly advanced unsubstantiated claims of abuse, failed to provide evidence supporting her allegations, obstructed the children\u2019s relationship with th eir father, and engaged in procedural misconduct, all of which \nundermine the statutory presumption favoring shared parenting and stability.  \n3. The relevant statutes and case law make clear that a parent who leverages false or \nunsupported allegations, manipulates protective order processes, or otherwise acts to sever the children\u2019s relationship with the other parent without credible justification is not acting in the children\u2019s best interests.

Here, Morgan \nintentionally disrupted the status quo of the children to pursue an affair, which she has prioritized over these very proceedings. The relevant statutes are discussed in detail below.\n\n5 \n II. LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK  \n4. The Texas Family Code establishes that the best interest of the child is the paramount \nconsideration in all matters of conservatorship, possession, and access (Tex. Fam. Code \u00a7 \n153.002). The public policy of Texas is to ensure children have frequent and continuing contact with parents who have shown the ability to act in their best interests, to provide a safe and stable environment, and to encourage shared parental rights and duties after separation (Tex. Fam. Code \u00a7 153.001). Any restriction or denial of a parent\u2019s access must be no greater than necessary to protect the child\u2019s best interest (Tex. Fam. Code \u00a7 153.193). 5. When allegations of abuse or family violence are made, the law requires credible \nevidence to rebut the presumption that standard possession and access serve the child\u2019s best interest ( Tex. Fam. Code \u00a7 153.004). Courts must consider whether a protective order has been \nrendered and whether there is a history or pattern of abuse, but unsupported or disproven allegations do not justify restrictions.  \n7. Texas appellate courts have repeatedly emphasized that the best -interest analysis is child -\ncentered and focuses on factors such as the stability of the home, the acts or omissions of each parent, and whether a parent fosters or undermines the child\u2019s relat ionship with the other parent \n(In re Marriage of Waters , 07-25-00057-CV (Tex. App. Nov 18, 2025);  W.G. v. Tex. Dep't of \nFamily & Protective Servs .; In re A.I.G., 135 S.W.3d 687 (Tex. App. 2003)). The Holley factors, \nwhich guide b"}

App. Nov 18, 2025);  W.G. v. Tex. Dep't of \nFamily & Protective Servs .; In re A.I.G., 135 S.W.3d 687 (Tex. App. 2003)). The Holley factors, \nwhich guide best -interest determinati ons, include the child\u2019s emotional and physical needs, the \nstability of the home, the parenting abilities of each parent, and the acts or omissions that may indicate an improper parent -child relationship. \n7. Courts have condemned conduct that obstructs a child\u2019s relationship with the other \nparent, including making false allegations, interfering with access, and using litigation as a tool\n\n6 \n to gain leverage rather than to protect the child ( Marriage of Chandler, Matter of , 914 S.W.2d \n252 (Tex. App. 1996);  Gunther v. Gunther , 478 S.W.2d 821 (Tex. Ct. App. 1972)). Such conduct \nis considered legally reprehensible and contrary to the child\u2019s best interests.  \n8. When a parent\u2019s allegations are not supported by credible evidence, and especially when \nthey are contradicted by the record or deemed admissions, courts have found that the parent has \nnot demonstrated the ability to act in the child\u2019s best interests ( Magro v. Magro, NO. 01-19-\n00701-CV (Tex. App. Dec 10, 2020);  Interest of C.S., 717 S.W.3d 1). The law also allows courts \nto infer a parent\u2019s likely future conduct from past deliberate conduct, particularly when that conduct has endangered the child\u2019s safety or well -being (In re J.J.H., No. 04-18-00738-CV (Tex. \nApp. Feb 06, 2019);  In re G.K.B., 04-21-00528-CV (Tex. App. May 04, 2022)). \n9. Here, Morgan Michelle Myers\u2019 conduct throughout the litigation has been damaging to \nthe overall well -being of the children both emotionally and financially, and the record establishes \nthat she has made no effort to rebut the claims made against her that are tied to specific elements of the Texas Family Code.  \n10.

Respondent is confident that this Court will adopt this parenting plan, and effectuate the long-needed recovery period that i s long overdue in this case. We now turn to Petitioner\u2019s \nconduct.  \n11. By adopting this parenting plan, the status quo will be restored to the last peaceful time \nprior to Morgan\u2019s intentional misrepresentations to this Court.\n\n7 \n III. PETITIONER\u2019S CONDUCT  \nA. Unsubstantiated Allegations and Lack of Credible Evidence  \n9. The record indicates that Morgan Michelle Myers has repeatedly made allegations of \nchild abuse, neglect, and family violence without providing new sworn evidence or addressing \nthe contrary proof in the mandamus record. Texas law requires that any restricti on or denial of a \nparent\u2019s access be supported by credible evidence, not speculation or disproven claims (Tex. Fam. Code \u00a7 153.004). The absence of a protective order or any finding of family violence, combined with the nonsuit of the protective -order proceeding, means there is no legal or factual \nbasis for denying or severely restricting the father\u2019s access.  \n10. The Texas Supreme Court  has held that advancing unsubstantiated or disproven \nallegations, especially when used to justify emergency relief or to gain leverage in custody disputes, is contrary to the best -interest standard and may warrant sanctions (Low v. Henry, 221 \nS.W.3d 609 (Tex. 2007)). The persistence in making such allegations, despite their refutation in the record and the lack of any credible evidence, demonstrates a disregard for the tru"}

Henry, 221 \nS.W.3d 609 (Tex. 2007)). The persistence in making such allegations, despite their refutation in the record and the lack of any credible evidence, demonstrates a disregard for the truth and the children\u2019s need for stability and a relationshi p with both parents.  \nB. Obstruction of the Parent-Child Relationship  \n11. Texas public policy and case law strongly favor frequent and continuing contact between \nchildren and both parents who are fit and able to act in the children\u2019s best interests (Tex. Fam. Code \u00a7 153.001;  In re J.R.D., 169 S.W.3d 740 (Tex. 2005)). Conduct that obstructs this \nrelationship \u2014such as blocking communication, denying access, or making false allegations to \njustify exclusion\u2014has been repeatedly condemned by Texas courts as contrary to the child\u2019s welfare ( Marriage of Chandler, Matter of , 914 S.W.2d 252 (Tex. App. 1996);  Gunther v. \nGunther , 478 S.W.2d 821 (Tex. Ct. App. 1972)).\n\n8 \n 12. The record shows that Morgan\u2019s actions resulted in the father\u2019s removal from the home \nand a significant restriction of his contact with the children, not based on any adjudicated finding \nof danger but on unsupported claims. This pattern of conduct is preci sely the type of behavior \nTexas courts have found to be legally reprehensible and inconsistent with the best interests of the child.  \nC. Instability and Manipulation of Legal Processes  \n13. Stability and permanence are paramount considerations in the best -interest analysis ( In re \nG.K.B ., 04-21-00528-CV (Tex. App. May 04, 2022)). The use of litigation tactics \u2014such as filing \nserial amended petitions with escalating allegations, failing to respond to discovery, and ignoring deemed admissions \u2014undermines the stability of the children\u2019s envir onment and the integrity of \nthe judicial process. Courts have recognized that such conduct, especially when it results in the unjustified removal of a paren t or the disruption of the children\u2019s home and financial security, is \ncontrary to the"}

Courts have recognized that such conduct, especially when it results in the unjustified removal of a paren t or the disruption of the children\u2019s home and financial security, is \ncontrary to the children\u2019s best interests ( In re Marriage of Waters , 07-25-00057-CV (Tex. App. \nNov 18, 2025);  Van Heerden v. Van Heerden, 321 S.W.3d 869 (Tex. App. 2010)). \n14. Moreover, the failure to address or rebut specific allegations of financial misconduct, \nfraud, and civil conspiracy, as well as the refusal to clarify the authority of counsel, further demonstrates a lack of commitment to transparency and the children\u2019s welfare.  \nD. Failure to Foster Co-Parenting and Shared Parental Duties  \n15. The Texas Family Code encourages parents to share in the rights and duties of raising \ntheir children after separation (Tex. Fam. Code \u00a7 153.001). The record reflects that Morgan has not only failed to foster the children\u2019s relationship with their father but has actively worked to sever it, including by introducing a new partner and attempting to install a replacement father figure. Such conduct is inconsistent with the statutory mandate and the Holley factors, which\n\n9 \n prioritize the child\u2019s need for a stable, loving relationship with both parents ( In re A.I.G., 135 \nS.W.3d 687 (Tex. App. 2003)).  \nE. Legal and Procedural Violations  \n16. The procedural record shows that Morgan\u2019s pleadings are not only substantively deficient \nbut also procedurally improper. The failure to respond to requests for admission results in those \nmatters being deemed admitted, including the absence of family violen ce and the occurrence of \nfinancial misconduct (Tex. R. Civ. P. 198.2(c)). The use of undisclosed evidence or witnesses is barred by Rule 193.6, and the lack of authority of counsel further undermines the legitimacy of her pleadings (Tex. R. Civ. P. 193.6). These violations reinforce the conclusion that Morgan has not acted in the children\u2019s best interests, as she has failed to comply wit"}

CONCLUSION \u2013 PETITIONER\u2019S CONDUCT  \n17. In sum, Morgan Michelle Myers has not demonstrated that she can act in the best \ninterests of the children under Texas law. Her conduct \u2014characterized by unsubstantiated and \ndisproven allegations, obstruction of the children\u2019s relationship with their father, manipulation of legal processes, and disregard for stability and co -parenting \u2014contravenes the statutory mandates \nand judicial standards that define a parent\u2019s ability to serve the children\u2019s welfare. Texas courts have consistently held that such behav ior justifies sanctions, restrictions, or changes in \nconservatorship, as it is fundamentally inconsistent with the best interests of the child. The record supports the conclusion that Morgan\u2019s actions have been motivated by personal or tactical advantage r ather than a genuine concern for the children\u2019s safety or well -being, and thus she has \nnot met the legal standard required to demonstrate that she can act in their best interests.\n\n10 \n 18. The forthcoming parenting plan serves the best interests of the children, aims to seek \nrestoration rather than division, and provides a comprehensive framework that will ensure the \nchildren remain in their stable, nurturing environment that they have know n their entire lives up \nuntil Morgan\u2019s deliberate actions disrupted it.  \n19. Respondent\u2019s parenting plan considers each parent, relatives, their needs, and provides \nfor an amicable resolution that puts the focus of this matter back where the Texas Family Code mandates: the best interests of the children.  \nV.

THE TRUE STATUS QUO  \nA. Family  Dynamics  \n20. Prior to Morgan\u2019s intentional lies at the onset of this case, M.E.M. and C.R.M. enjoyed an \nenvironment where both parents were a daily presence in their lives. Due to Respondent\u2019s at -\nhome work status, this enabled him to be involved in every aspect of thei r lives. For example, \nRespondent would get them ready for school, walk them to school, visit them for lunch, pick them up from school, help with homework, ensure they made it to their extracurricular activities, cooked meals, gave them baths, and read them  bedtime stories each night, as the countless \nimages and videos would show if presented to this Court.  \n21. Furthermore, the matrimonial residence resides directly next -door to Morgan\u2019s \ngrandparents, who have not participated in these proceedings and are victims themselves of Morgan\u2019s lies. Text messages and other correspondence would show that, in fact, the Re spondent \nand the grandparents were able to have amicable discussions regarding the Children during the litigation.\n\n11 \n 22. Finally, the Children\u2019s Aunt, Caitlin Wilson, resided in the backyard between 2015 and \n2025, but had no direct involvement with the Children regarding daily care throughout the \nmarriage.  \n23. Regarding finances, and contrary to Morgan\u2019s sworn affidavit of indigency, the \nRespondent was the primary breadwinner and relied on the matrimonial residence to support his family due to the need for a specific internet connection and an environment that cannot be replicated elsewhere on short notice. Morgan was aware of this necessity, as the internet within the home had just been upgraded prior to these proceedings to meet Respondent\u2019s growing business demands.

Application of Law to the Described Environment \n24. The Children\u2019s true environment  described  above \u2014where both parents were daily, hands -\non caregivers, the Respondent worked from home and was deeply involved in every aspect of the children\u2019s lives, the home was adjacent to supportive grandparents, and the family\u2019s financial stability was tied to the res idence\u2014exemplifies the type of arrangement the Texas Family Code \nseeks to protect and restore.  \nC. Frequent and Continuing Contact with Both Parents  \n25. The Family Code\u2019s public policy, as set out in \u00a7 153.001 and reinforced by \u00a7 153.251, is \nto ensure that children have frequent and continuing contact with both parents who are able to act in their best interest. The described status quo, where the Responde nt was present for school \nroutines, meals, extracurricular activities, and bedtime, and where both parents were daily presences, directly fulfills this policy. The law does not require equal division of time, but it does require that both parents have meaningful, ongoing involvement in the child\u2019s life, as confirmed in Stillwell v. Stillwell  and In re J.R.D., 169 S.W.3d 740 (Tex. 2005).\n\n12 \n D. Stability, Continuity, and Minimizing Disruption  \n26. Family Code \u00a7\u00a7 153.134 and 153.133 require courts to minimize disruption to the child\u2019s \neducation, daily routine, and social associations. The described environment \u2014where the \nchildren\u2019s routines, schooling, and social connections are maintained, and where the \nRespondent\u2019 s work-from -home status ensures ongoing stability\u2014aligns with this statutory \nmandate. The proximity to grandparents and the absence of disruption from the aunt\u2019s presence \nfurther support the stability and continuity of the children\u2019s env ironment.  \nE. Supportive Extended Family 27. Section 263.307 lists the availability of an extended family support system as a factor in \ndetermining the best interest of the child. The fac"}

Supportive Extended Family 27. Section 263.307 lists the availability of an extended family support system as a factor in \ndetermining the best interest of the child. The fact that the children\u2019s grandparents live next door and have maintained amicable relations with the Respondent, as evidenced by text messages and correspondence, provides a strong support network for the children. This is precisely the type of social support the law encourages, as it enhances the children\u2019s sense of security and belonging.  \nF. Parental Rights and Duties  \n28. Section 151.001 outlines the rights and duties of parents, including the duty to provide \ncare, control, protection, support, and education. The Respondent\u2019s daily involvement in the children\u2019s lives \u2014getting them ready for school, helping with homework, ens uring participation \nin extracurricular activities, and providing meals and bedtime care\u2014demonstrates the exercise of these statutory duties. The financial reliance on the home, including the need for a specific internet connection to support the Respon dent\u2019s work and the family\u2019s financial stability, further \naligns with the duty to provide for the children\u2019s needs.\n\n13 \n G. Presumption of Joint Managing Conservatorship  \n29. Section 153.131 creates a rebuttable presumption that appointing both parents as joint \nmanaging conservators is in the child\u2019s best interest, absent evidence of significant impairment or \nfamily violence. The described environment, with both parents active ly involved and no \nindication of harm or violence, supports the application of this presumption. The courts have consistently upheld this principle, as seen in  major cases such as  Kom v. Kom  and In re C.J.C.  \nH. Minimal Restriction on Parental Access  \n30. Section 153.193 mandates that any restriction on a parent\u2019s possession or access must be \nthe minimum necessary to protect the child\u2019s best interest.

The described status quo, where the Respondent\u2019s access is unrestricted and both parents are daily presences, is consistent with this requirement. Courts have held that broad or punitive restrictions are disfavored unless there is \nclear evidence of harm . \nI. Best Interest Factors and Holley Analysis  \n31. The \u201cHolley factors,\u201d as established in  Holley v. Adams  and codified by statute, provide a \nframework for assessing the best interest of the child. These factors include the child\u2019s emotional \nand physical needs, the stability of the home, the parental abilities of the caregivers, and the plans for the child. The described environment \u2014daily parental involvement, stable home, \nsupportive extended family, and financial security \u2014addresses each of these factors favorably.  \nJ. Financial Stability and Support  \n32. Section 151.001 also imposes a duty on parents to support their children, including \nproviding for their education and general welfare. The Respondent\u2019s role as the primary breadwinner, reliance on the home for work, and recent upgrades to the home\u2019s internet \ninfrastructure to meet business demands all contribute to the children\u2019s financial stability and\n\n14 \n future. The law recognizes the importance of a stable, supportive environment for the child\u2019s \ndevelopment.  \nK. Synthesis   \n33. Taken together, the legislative provisions and case law create a coherent legal framework \nthat prioritizes the child\u2019s best interest through frequent, continuing contact with both parents, stability in the child\u2019s environment, and the support of extended family. The described status quo\u2014where both parents are daily, hands -on caregivers, the home is stable and tailored to the \nchildren\u2019s needs, and the family\u2019s financial future is secure\u2014embodies the very environment the Family Code seeks to protect and restore.  \nL. Caveats  \n34. "}

Caveats  \n34. While the law strongly favors the described environment, there are exceptions. The \npresumption of joint managing conservatorship and frequent contact with both parents can be rebutted if there is evidence that such an arrangement would significantly impair  the child\u2019s \nphysical health or emotional development, or if there is a history of family violence. In such cases, the court may impose restrictions or allocate rights and duties differently to protect the child\u2019s best interest.  Here, the current arran gement manufactured by Morgan fits this exception.  \nVI. THE MANUFACTURED STATUS QUO  \n35. Today, the Children are not raised by their mother or their father but are now cared for by \na variety of individuals who previously had no such role in the Children\u2019s lives. For example, \nafter gaining sole use of the residency, the Mother began to effecti vely erase the Respondent \nfrom the household. She boxed up all of his belongings, began introducing her extramarital \npartner into the children\u2019s daily lives. Indeed, these allegations are unrebutted in the record.\n\n15 \n 36. They now go long periods of time without any communication with their Paternal side of \nthe family, because Mother has put forth no meaningful effort to maintain the Children\u2019s \nrelationship with Father. Mother claims these attempts to communicate and discu ss medical \nneeds for the Children are harassment, and seeks to deny his access to the Children outright with \nnewfound claims of child abuse.  \n37. The children have regressed in their schooling, the youngest child suffered a major \nmedical incident in March of 2025 because of Mother\u2019s failure to provide the necessary medical care to the children, and the only communication with the children occurs between cellular phones acquired by Mother\u2019s grandp"}

Rather than enjoy a stable environment, they have had chaos introduced into their lives, \nand the centerpiece of stability was abruptly removed by a parent with an alternative motive rather than the best interests of her children.  \n39. Their financial future, once secure and promising, has now been significantly damaged \ndue to Mother\u2019s intentional conduct, resulting in significant financial losses that directly impact the well -being of the children now and in the future.  \n40. The children have lost their Father, their great grandparents have been thrust into a \nparenting role, and their Aunt and Mother\u2019s extramarital partner now are involved in the children\u2019s lives frequently, a stark contrast to their true status quo and this States public policy. 41. This parenting plan seeks to restore stability to the children\u2019s lives, restore the \nRespondents rights and access to his home so that he may plan accordingly for the future in accordance with the children\u2019s best interests, and provide the most efficient path forward that focuses on both recovery and sustainability for all parties, including Mother.\n\n16 \n VII. RESTORATION OF THE TRUE STATUS QUO  \nA. The Simple Fact of this Case  \n42. At its core, this case is simple. Petitioner made a mistake and then lied to avoid \naccountability. Those lies \u2014that an active protective order with a finding of family violence in \nthe marriage already existed, that family violence had in fact occurred, and that she was \nfinancially indigent \u2014are the very claims she failed to support with competent evidence in the \nsummary judgment proceedings. Yet those same false assertions are what originally awarded her \nexclusive possession of the "}

Yet those same false assertions are what originally awarded her \nexclusive possession of the children and the home. The current record strips away that narrative \nand leaves no lawful basis to continue excluding Respondent from his children or their residence , \nand Mother should not enjoy these benefits designed for families in true emergency situations.  \n43. The current, litigation -driven arrangement  has introduced instability, disrupted the \nchildren\u2019s routines, and replaced parental care with a patchwork of previously uninvolved adults. The record, as described, contains no credible evidence of family violence or significant \nimpairment that justifies the ongoing exclusion of Respondent from the residence or the \nchildren\u2019s daily lives. Such evidence doesn\u2019t exist, because Respondent has never hit anyone. \nThe absence of a protective order, the lack of substantiated findings of danger, and the procedural deficiencies in the opposing party\u2019s case \u2014culminating in Petitioner\u2019s failure at summary \njudgment to prove the very allegations she used to secure exclusive possession \u2014all reinforce the \nstatutory presumption i n favor of restoring Respondent\u2019s access and the prior stable environment. \nRespondent\u2019s presence in the home poses no danger to anyone and simply restores the lawful \nstatus quo that existed before Petitioner\u2019s misrepresentations.  \n44. Texas law is clear that restrictions on a parent\u2019s access must be narrowly tailored and \nsupported by credible evidence (Tex. Fam. Code \u00a7 153.193; Fish v. Lebrie (Tex. App. Dec. 10,\n\n17 \n 2010)). Courts repeatedly reverse or modify orders that impose broad or blanket restrictions \nwithout such evidence, emphasizing that the best interest of the child is not served by unnecessary disruption or by depriving children of meaningful contact with a fit parent ( In re \nR . P. (Tex. App. Feb. 28, 2024); Stillwell v. St"}

P. (Tex. App. Feb. 28, 2024); Stillwell v. Stillwell , No. 03-17-00457-CV (Tex. App. Oct. 17, \n2018)). Where, as here, the restrictions flow from unproven allegations and strategic misrepresentations that later collapse under scrutiny, continuation of those restrictions contradicts both statute and precedent.  \n45. The Holley factors, which remain authoritative despite being codified by statute, further \nsupport restoration of the status quo. The children\u2019s emotional and physical needs, the stability of the home, the parental abilities of Respondent, and the plans for  the children all weigh in favor of \nreturning to the prior arrangement (Holley v. Adams , 544 S.W.2d 367 (Tex. 1976), codified by \nCorrales v. Department of Family and Protective Services , 155 S.W.3d 478 (Tex. App. 2004)). \nThe evidence of academic regres sion, medical neglect, and emotional harm under the current \narrangement \u2014an arrangement built on Petitioner\u2019s unproven accusations \u2014underscores the \nurgent need for corrective action and for reinstating the parent whose presence historically supported the chi ldren\u2019s stability and progress. \n46. Moreover, the proximity of the holidays amplifies the importance of stability, family \nconnection, and the opportunity for the children to experience the comfort and joy of their established home and routines. Texas courts recognize the significance of mini mizing disruption \nand preserving continuity, especially during meaningful family occasions (Tex. Fam. Code \u00a7 153.134; Bates v. Tesar , 81 S.W.3d 411 (Tex. App. 2002)). In a case where the alleged \njustification for disruption has now been exposed as unsupported, the equities and the law converge in favor of prompt restoration.\n\n18 \n B.

Why Respondent Should Be Restored  to the Residence \nRestoring Respondent to the residence and the pre -litigation status quo not only aligns with \nTexas law, it follows directly from the facts of this case. The Texas Family Code and controlling \ncase law establish that:  \ni. Best Interest and Stability.  \nThe children\u2019s best interests are served by returning them to a stable, familiar environment with daily involvement from both parents and supportive extended family (Tex. Fam. Code \u00a7 153.002; W.G. v. Tex. Dep't of Family & Protective Servs. (Tex. App. Jul. 7, 2023)). Here, Respondent\u2019s presence historically provided that stability; it is \nPetitioner\u2019s unproven allegations and the resulting litigation -driven arrangement that \nintroduced instability.  \nii. Presumption of Joint Managing Conservatorship. There is a strong presumption that both parents serve as joint managing conservators and that restrictions arise only from credible evidence of danger or significant impairment (Tex. Fam. Code \u00a7 153.131; Kom v. Kom (Tex. App. Apr. 8, 2025)). Petitioner\u2019s c laims \nof family violence and indigency \u2014assertions used to displace Respondent from the \nhome \u2014are the same claims she failed to substantiate in the summary judgment record, \nleaving the presumption intact and und isplaced.  \niii. Minimal Restriction on Access.  \nAny restriction on Respondent\u2019s access must be no greater than necessary, and the current broad exclusion lacks support in the competent evidence (Tex. Fam. Code \u00a7 153.193; Fish v. Lebrie (Tex. App. Dec. 10, 2010)). Once Petitioner\u2019s allegations fall away for lack\n\n19 \n of proof, no lawful basis remains for the extraordinary remedy of ongoing exclusion from \nthe residence and the children\u2019s daily lives.  \niv. Correction of Unjustified Interference.  \nCourts condemn and correct conduct that unjustifiably interferes with a child\u2019s \nrelationship with a parent, especially where"}

Correction of Unjustified Interference.  \nCourts condemn and correct conduct that unjustifiably interferes with a child\u2019s \nrelationship with a parent, especially where motivated by personal or tactical advantage \nrather than genuine concern for the child\u2019s welfare ( Marriage of Chandler, Matter of , 914 \nS.W.2d 252 (Tex. App. 1996)). Petitioner\u2019s initial misrepresentations and her later failure \nto verify them at summary judgment show precisely this type of unjustified interference: a tactical use of false claims t o gain the home and children, without the evidentiary \nsupport the law requires.  \nv. Material and Substantial Change.  \nThe documented instability, academic and medical regression, and introduction of new caregivers constitute a material and substantial change in circumstances, justifying modification to restore the prior arrangement (Tex. Fam. Code \u00a7 156.101; Jenkins v. Jenkins , 16 S.W.3d 473 (Tex. App. 2000)). The \u201cchange\u201d in this case arises directly from \nPetitioner\u2019s unproven narrative. Once that narrative fails, the law points back to the last stable, functioning arrangement \u2014the pre -litigation status quo with Respondent in the \nresidence.  \n47. The law does not support ongoing, broad restrictions in the absence of proven danger. \nThe facts here show that the children\u2019s best interests are served by restoring the status quo ante, returning Respondent to the residence, and reestablishing the children \u2019s routines, stability, and \nfamily connections. Respondent\u2019s presence in the home poses no danger to anyone; it simply\n\n20 \n corrects the consequences of Petitioner\u2019s initial misrepresentations and realigns the orders with \nthe actual evidence.  \nC.

Early, decisive court action prevents further deterioration and maximizes the chances of successful reunification and recovery. In this case, where the foundational allegations lack evidentiary su pport, ongoing delay only deepens harm that serves \nno legitimate protective purpose.  \n49. With the holiday season approaching, the opportunity to restore the children\u2019s sense of \nsecurity, belonging, and joy becomes especially compelling. The law\u2019s emphasis on stability, continuity, and frequent, meaningful contact with both parents is never mor e salient than during \ntimes of family significance\u2014particularly where the current disruption stems from accusations that do not survive scrutiny.  \n50. Below is the recovery plan that will re-establish the Children\u2019s status quo and preserve \ntheir well being during this process. \nVIII. THE RECOVERY PLAN  \nA. Residency  \n51. Respondent will reside at 6641 Anne Court, Watauga, Texas 76148 with the Children. \nMother may choose between cohabitation or alternative residency. The children\u2019s interests are best served with both parents in the home, as no violence or conditions exist or have ever existed that would require one parent to leave the home. If the Petitioner decides co -habitation is not an\n\n21 \n option for her, she has several other housing options available to her, including next -door and \nseveral properties owned by her Grandparents. Respondent does not have this luxury, and relies \non the home to provide for his children and care for them.  \n52. The Children are to remain in the home they have been in their entire lives, which \nremains at 6641 Anne Court, Watauga, Texas 76148. B. Daily Care  \n53.

The Children are to remain in the home they have been in their entire lives, which \nremains at 6641 Anne Court, Watauga, Texas 76148. B. Daily Care  \n53. Respondent is available twenty -four hours a day, seven days per week to care for the \nChildren given his hybrid work from home / parent from home status. Based on reasonable belief, Mother has acquired a full time job where she works outside of the home at  least four \ndays per week.  \n54. Therefore, while Mother is at work, Respondent can care for the Children so that they \nremain in the care of one of their parents for the majority of time rather than being cared for by their relatives, who can return to their normal role in the Children\u2019s  lives.  \n55. Respondent can get the Children ready for school in the mornings, walk them to school, \nvisit them for lunch, take them home from school, help with homework, provide hygienic needs, provide transportation to any extracurricular activities, schedule and mai ntain medical care, \nschedule visits with the nearby extended family, and will foster a relationship with Mother.  \n56. Mother can be with the Children while not at work and on her days off, thus providing \nthe Children with the frequent access to both parents that they have been without for nearly two years. C. Relationships  \n57. All parties are to treat each other with respect, and should not effectuate any actions that \nwould interfere with the best interests of the children. Neither party should introduce or\n\n22 \n otherwise expose the Children to any extramarital relationship until after the divorce is finalized \nto preserve their emotional stability.  \nD. Weekly Reports  \n58.

Respondent\u2019s proposed parenting plan rests firmly on Texas statutory law and controlling \nappellate authority. The best interests of the children, the presumption favoring joint managing conservatorship, the requirement of minimal restriction on access, and  the paramount importance \nof stability and continuity all point in the same direction: restoration of Respondent to the residence and reestablishment of the children\u2019s prior environment.  \n60. This case reduces to a straightforward proposition. Petitioner made a mistake, then \nattempted to shield herself from accountability by advancing false claims of an existing protective order, family violence, and financial indigency. She then failed, in sum mary judgment \nproceedings, to prove those same claims. Those misrepresentations temporarily gave her the\n\n23 \n children and the home, but they do not survive the scrutiny of the record or the standards of \nTexas law.  \n61. In the absence of credible evidence justifying ongoing restrictions, and in light of the \ndocumented harm under the current arrangement, the children\u2019s best interests and the governing \nlegal framework both support Respondent\u2019s restoration. The Court should adopt Respondent\u2019s plan, return him to the residence, and give the children what the law and the evidence already support: the stability, family connection, and hope that come from a safe, loving parent restored to his rightful place in their daily liv es. \n  Respectfully submitted,  \n  /s/ Charles Dustin Myers  \n  CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS  \n  6641 Anne Court  \n  Watauga,"}
