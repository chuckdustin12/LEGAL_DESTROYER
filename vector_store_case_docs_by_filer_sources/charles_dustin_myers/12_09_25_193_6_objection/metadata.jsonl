Respondent files this notice to ensure the record reflects the legal effect of the Court\u2019s \nruling denying Respondent\u2019s no-evidence motion.  \n2. Regardless of denial, Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 193.6 operates automatically  to \nexclude any exhibits or testimony not timely disclosed in discovery . \n3. The Texas Supreme Court has made clear that:  \ni. nondisclosed materials cannot be used at summary judgment or trial,  \nii. attaching such materials to a response does not cure nondisclosure , and \niii. exclusion is mandatory, absent a record finding of good cause or absence of unfair \nsurprise. See Fort Brown Villas III Condo. Ass\u2019n v. Gillenwater , 285 S.W.3d 879 (Tex. \n2009); Montes v. Montes , No. 04-20-00474-CV (Tex. App. Jul. 28, 2021); Alvarado v. \nFarah Mfg.

Accordingly, Respondent respectfully notes for the record that:  \nThe Court\u2019s denial of summary judgment does not authorize Petitioner to use evidence she failed to disclose. Rule 193.6 exclusion applies automatically and continues to govern trial.  \nRespondent will object at trial to any attempt to introduce nondisclosed exhibits or testimony.  \n7. It is also worth noting that the trial court has discretion to postpone trial and impose \nsanctions to cure any prejudice resulting from late disclosure, as recognized in  Alvarado v. Farah \nMfg. Co., Inc. (Tex. 1992). However, this is an alternative to exclusion and does not alter the default rule.  \n \nRespectfully submitted,  \n  /s/ Charles Dustin Myers  \n CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS  \n PRO -SE RESPONDENT  \n CHUCKDUSTIN12@GMAIL.COM  \n 817-546-3693\n\n3 \n CERTIFICATE OF SERVICE  \n \n I certify that on this 9th day of Decem ber, 2025, a true and accurate copy of this \nRESPONDENT\u2019S NOTICE OF RULE 193.6 OBJECTION AND REQUEST FOR \nCLARIFICATION  has been s erved through the state approved EFM pursuant to \u00a7 21a of the \nTexas Rules of Civil Procedure.  \nRespectfully submitted,  \n \n /s/ Charles Dustin Myers  \n CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS  \n PRO -SE RESPONDENT  \n CHUCKDUSTIN12@GMAIL.COM  \n 817-546-3693\n\nAutomated Certificate of eService\nThis automated certificate of service was created by the efiling system.\nThe filer served this document via email generated by the efiling system\non the date and to the persons listed below.
