The \nassurance to uphold a judiciary that follows the rule of law has been replaced with \ndecisions that have deprived the Respondent of due process, equitable hearings, and his \nfundamental paternal rights.

This motion has been filed at the earliest practicable opportunity, as the \nRespondent has exhausted all other available legal avenues without receiving any response, explanation, or opposition. Respondent has given the trial court every opportunity to \ncorrect the errors made in this case and  has recently discovered pertinent information \nrelated to the initial proceeding that took place on January 16th, 2024, as outlined below.  \nThere are no current settings or upcoming hearings, and the case has not yet been scheduled \nfor a final trial. The Respondent\u2019s motion is verified and asserts grounds for recusal \npursuant to TEX. CIV . R. P. 18(b)b1. These grounds are not predicated solely on the judges\u2019  \nprior rulings.

On December 14th, 2024, the petitioner requested a \nprotective order from James Munford, which was denied.  Exhibit A.  However, one month \nand two days later, Judge James Munford made an initial decision that has been unexplained for the last ten months.  \nB. The initial decision at issue arose during a show cause hearing concerning an \norder of protection initiated by the petitioner, Morgan Michelle Myers, on December 22, 2023. This hearing was originally scheduled to be presided over by Associate Judge \nJeffrey Kaitcer in the 322\nnd District Court of Tarrant County at 9:00 A.M.  on January 16th, \n2024. However, due to delays caused by inclement weather as mentioned above, the\n\n4 proceedings were instead conducted by District Judge James Munford, as Associate \nJudge Jeffrey Kaitcer arrived late.  \nC.Both parties were present and  appeared without legal representation.  During the\nproceedings,  Judge Munford presented the parties with an agreed continuance, which \nboth parties accepted,  and which was subsequently granted by Judge Munford as \nreflected in his order. However, despite granting the continuance, Judge Munford went further, issuing a series of rulings where he sua sponte consolidated the protective order \ncase with the divorce case previously filed by the petitioner on December 18, 2023.  \nExhibit B.

Exhibit C. \nD.This decision by Judge Munford undeniably raises serious questions regarding\nhis impartiality  in this matter. Due process of law requires that an individual receive \nnotice and hearing before being deprived of a property right.  In re the Guardianship of \nBays, 355 S.W.3d 715, 720 (Tex. App. 2011);\n See Grannis v. Ordean, 234 U.S. 385, 394, \n34 S. Ct. 779, 783, 58 L. Ed. 1363 (1914) (\" a fundamental requisite of due process of law \nis the opportunity to be heard\"). Furthermore, the Texas Family Code prohibits such an \norder before notice and hearing. TEX. FAM. CODE 105.001 (\u201c\u2026an order may not be rendered under Subsection (a)(1)\u2026 except after notice and a hearing\u2026\u201d) (referencing \nchild custody).\n\n5 E. Moreover , 6.405(b) of the Texas Family Code was not satisfied, which is a \nmandatory requirement before any hearing can take place given the original petition for \ndivorce claimed an active order of protection was currently in effect against the \nRespondent. Exhibit B, p. 7. (\u201cThe petitioner shall attach to the petition a copy of each \norder described by Subsection (a)(1) in which a party to the suit or the child of a party to \nthe suit was the applicant or victim of the conduct alleged in the application\u2026  if a copy \nof the order is not available at the time of filing, the petition must state that a copy of the \norder will be filed with the court before any hearing. ) All of the procedural safeguards \nabove were disregarded by James Munford. \nF.

City of Lubbock, 498 \nS.W.3d 53 ( Tex. 2016) improperly denied the City its undisputed right to access \ngroundwater\u2014an essential resource\u2014Judge Munford's rulings have deprived the \nRespondent of his residency, which has served not only as the family home since 2015 \nbut also as the headquarters for his business which provided for the children \u2013 an \nessential resource to their wellbeing. Furthermore, the Respondent was divested of \ncustodial rights to his children without justification.  Like the injunction in Coyote, rather \nthan preserving the status quo, these initial rulings have done the opposite by depriving\n\n6 \n the Respondent of his constitutional rights to property prior to due process of law . US \nCONST. AMEND XIV , \u00a7 1;  TEX CONST.  ART. I, \u00a7 19. Furthermore,  James Munford \nprejudged critical matters that require full evidentiary hearings.  TEX. FAM.

The threshold for recusal is \"whether a reasonable member of the public at \nlarge, knowing all the facts in the public domain concerning the judge's conduct, would \nhave a reasonable doubt that the judge is actually impartial.\"  Hansen v. JPMorgan Chase \nBank, N.A.,  346 S.W.3d 769, 776 (Tex. App. \u2014Dallas 2011, no pet.);  Rodriguez v. \nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. , No. 04-14-00342-CV , 22 (Tex. App. Jun. 17, 2015) . The \nRespondent asserts that a reasonable member of the public would indeed reasonably doubt James Munford was actually impartial given that he deprived the Respondent of a \nfair trial. Thus, the Respondent\u2019s burden an d threshold for recusal has been met, and \nJudge James Munford should be recused from this matter.  \nI. The only reasoning provided was an oral statement regarding his personal \nopinion regarding the Respondent living next door to his ex-partner\u2019s grandparents,\n\n7 \n which is extrajudicial and comes from a biased perspective which discounted the facts of \nthe case relevant to the children\u2019s well-being. In the context of this case, recusal is \nwarranted if the trial judge's impartiality might reasonably be questioned, or he has a personal bias.  TEX. R. CIV . P.  18b(2).  This opinion or bias was irrelevant to the well \nbeing of the children, as the grandmother, much like the children, relied on the Respondent\u2019s income in order to provide financial stability, and further justifies his \nrecusal.  \nIII. QUESTIONING THE IMPARTIALITY OF JEFFREY KAITCER  \nA. The initial ruling reset the case to January 22nd, 2024 . The Respondent retained \nthe services of Dan Bacalis, while the Petitioner arrived without any legal representation \nand retained the services of Cooper Carter in the lobby of the courtroom.

Exhibit \nD. Neither party appeared before the Jeffrey Kaitcer, and this decision was made without \nany input from the Respondent and without any opportunity to contest it.  \nB. At the third trial setting on February 1,  2024,  the parties arrived only to be \npresented with a settlement agreement from the Respondent\u2019s own counsel. Given that \nthe case had been delayed twice already and the ongoing damage from being unable to \nwork at full capacity was compounding by the day , the Respondent contested this\n\n8 \n strategy. He was informed by his attorney that the orders could be modified later and was \nurged to sign it. Left with no better alternative, the Respondent signed the agreement \nunder duress after already being deprived of his residency, children, and business since \nJanuary 16th, 2024.  Exhibit E \nC. The agreement removed the children from their own home that they had resided \nin their entire life and allowed the Respondent back into the home until March 1 , 2024.  It \nalso established child support, and allocated financial responsibilities to the parties, to \nwhere the Respondent was left with both car payments, an unreasonable amount of time \nto transition from the home and with the addition of child support obligations.

Given that Dan Bacalis had been terminated, and that the associate judge\u2019s \nreport signed on February 1, 2024,  had clear stipulations regarding its\u2019 reduction to \nwriting Exhibit G, p.5, the Respondent filed notice with the court on March 4\nth, 2024,  \nstating that he would not be leaving the marital residence as it was not in the best \ninterests of his children.

Judge Kaitcer further stated in open court, \nwhile drafting his ruling on the Respondent's motion, \"You don\u2019t care about your kids.\n\n10 \n You just care about your business.\" This remark, devoid of any evidentiary basis, exposed \na deep -seated bias that rendered impartial adjudication impossible. A  neutral and \nimpartial evaluator would have acknowledged the interconnected nature of the \nRespondent's business, residency, and familial relationships as well as the impact of the \ninitial proceedings leading up to that  point. Further,  an impartial judge would have \nrealized that there is no logical explanation to remove a parent who relies on the \nresidency to provide for the children while simultaneously denying the evidence that \nwould have corroborated this need.  \nJ. The Respondent's motion for reconsideration concluded with an illegible order, \nrequiring him to sign the temporary orders served just moments earlier by 1:30 p.m. that \nsame day. Exhibit K. Again, the order was designated as \"agreed\" despite lacking the \nRespondent's signature,  was reduced outside of its\u2019  own procedural requirements ordered \nby the same judge, was reduced without any underlying motion for temporary orders ever \nserved to the Respondent and differed from the associate judge\u2019s report signed on \nFebruary 1, 2024.

Rather than holding the opposing counsel and the petitioner in \ncontempt for violating Rule 13 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure for signing a \nfictitious pleading which contained false statements, Jeffrey Kaitcer deprived the \nRespondent of a fair trial, thus warranting his recusal from this matter.  \nK. It is evident, based on common sense and objective evaluation of the public \nfacts regarding Jeffrey Kaitcer\u2019s conduct that no reasonable person would believe that he \nwas actually impartial knowing all of the facts of the case. After eight months of seeking\n\n11 \n relief throughout the Texas judiciary, the collective actions of Judge James Munford and \nAssociate Judge Jeffrey Kaitcer remain unexplained, and the damage is ongoing.  Their \njoint recusal is necessary to ensure a fair resolution of this matter and to ensure the \npersistent favoritism directed towards the petitioner is abolished.  \nIV . THE AFTERMATH  \n A. Since the March 14th hearing, the case has stalled. There has been no \nparticipation from the opposing party , and all attempted communications have failed.   \nThere hasn\u2019t been any explanation for the denials in the Second Court of Appeals, leaving the Respondent to continue seeking every remedy available to him to correct the \ndecisions presented above or receive a valid legal basis that justifies them.   \n B. The joint managing conservatorship that the current orders outline has put the \nRespondent in massive amounts of debt.  He had to stay in hotels on Thursday nights in \norder to take his Children to school on Friday mornings for his visitation period, and for \nthe extended summer visitation, rented an AIR BNB in order to provide the Children with \na stable living space.

Given the requirements to operate his business, an alternative \nresidency would take a fair amount of time to transition to, and likewise the petitioner would need equal amount of time to obtain full employment in order to maintain the\n\n12 \n current household. All of this was explained in the Respondent\u2019s pleadings that were \nbefore the court on January 16th, 2024, but were not considered.  Exhibit L, Exhibit M \n C. Since the March 14th hearing, the petitioner has moved additional family \nmembers into the home, has not paid rent,  and has reduced her employment while \nsignificantly reducing the Respondents. On top of both James Munford and Jeffrey \nKaitcer\u2019s disregard for the law and the best interests of the children, the inadvertent \nfavoritism towards the petitioner has allowed her to further her own interests at the \nexpense of the status quo of the children. An impartial judge is required in this matter to \nensure that this one-sided favoritism does not continue at the expense of the children.  \n  D. On June 2 of 2024, the petitioner\u2019s grandmother  contacted the Respondent \nreiterating the above. She stated that the children were not being taken care of, that the petitioner was not acting like herself, and that she was not paying rent. This information was relayed to the Supreme Court of Texas, where the Respondent\u2019s motion for rehearing \non petition for writ of mandamus is still pending before the court, asking them to compel \nJames Munford to vacate the current orders which were entered by Associate Judge \nJeffrey Kaitcer as agreed without consent and referenced a hearing that has never taken \nplace.  \nV .

QUESTIONS THAT REMAIN UNANSWERED  \nThroughout this case, several concerning questions have arisen regarding the conduct \nof both judges:\n\n13 \n 1. What dire circumstance compelled Judge James Munford to take up a case on \nshort notice and grant injunctions and make child custody decisions without \nknowing the facts or considering the pleadings, particularly on a day the court was \nclosed due to inclement weather when he had denied a similar request a month \nearlier? \n2. Why did Judge Munford grant an agreed continuance at a protective order hearing and simultaneously rule against one of the parties on divorce issues without taking \ninto consideration the preponderance of the evidence before him? \n3. What factual basis on the record compelled Jeffrey Kaitcer to openly make \nnegative statements about the Respondent regarding his children? \n4. Why has Cooper Carter failed to respond to any of the Respondent\u2019s pleadings and \nneglected to file any documents on behalf of her client? \n5. What factual basis exists on the record to supports the petitioner being granted full custody of the children and sole use of the residence? \n6. How can an order be issued as an \"agreed order\" after consent was explicitly \nwithdrawn, referencing a hearing that never occurred, and served to the \nRespondent before a scheduled hearing meant to challenge the very order?\n\n14 \n VI. CONCLUSION \nThis case, as detailed in the pending motion for rehearing before the Supreme \nCourt of Texas, revolves around the core issue of accountability. What began with \nMorgan Michelle Myers attempting to avoid responsibility has now evolved into a troubling scenario where both judges have repeatedly failed to recognize and correct their \nserious missteps.

Attorney Cooper Carter\u2019s authority to represent the petitioner, currently \nbeing challenged through a Rule 12 motion, further deepens concerns about the integrity \nand fairness of these proceedings.  \nRecusing both judges is not just a procedural necessity, but a crucial step toward \nensuring that this case is reviewed impartially and that the facts are properly considered. This will allow the court to focus on the petitioner\u2019s pattern of deception and, more \nimportantly, what truly serves the best interests of the children. The petitioner\u2019s actions have caused unnecessary delays, destabilized her family, and inflicted significant \nemotional and financial harm on all involved. The ongoing litigation, exacerbated by a \nlack of judicial transparency and accountability, has only added to the hardship.  \nDespite these issues, the Respondent holds no ill will toward any party involved. \nHis primary concern has always been, and continues to be, doing what is right for his children. The Respondent believes that with impartial judges and a renewed focus on \nfairness, this case can still be resolved justly, allowing all parties to move forward with \ndignity and integrity. The Respondent remains diligent in his commitment to securing a \nfair outcome that reflects the best interests of his children as the Family Code mandates.\n\n15 \n VII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF  \nThe Respondent respectfully requests the following relief: \n1. That the clerk of the court deliver a copy of the motion for recusal to both the \nrespondent judges and the regional presiding judge, and deliver any signed orders of recusal or referral to the regional presiding judge immediately upon filing.  \n2.

Petition was filed on 2024 -12-18 under an Affidavit of Inability to pay.\u00b2 \n2. The Petitioner's action of filing for divorce under an Affidavit of Inability to pay  \nthree days  after transferring $1,576 to herself starkly contravenes the mandates \nset forth in Chapter 10, Section 10.001 of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code .

The suit was unlawful by nature \u2075, as the grounds for eviction were based on \nfamily status,  referencing the divorce as well as  a protective order that had been \ndenied on December 14th, 2023.  The suit was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction  on \nJanuary 17th, 2024.\u2076 \n D. PROTECTIVE ORDER  \n1. This suit was the second attempt by the Petitioner  to have me removed from \nthe home , which ultimately succeeded .  \n2. The claims with in this suit mentioned se xually aggressive comments  and \nthreatening behavior. These allegations are ma terially false, as the Petitioner  \npossess es no evidence, and has presented no evidence in relation to th ese claims  \nsince the initiation of the suit. Despite this , as video and image evidence will show  \nonce a fair trial date is se t, the Petitioner and I continued to maintain stability at \nour family home and  preserved the sense o f normal cy that our daughters have \nbeen a ccustomed to their entire lives  up until January 16th, 2024 . \n The Court's decision  to remove me from my home and my children \u2019s lives on January \n16th, 202 4, albeit preliminary  and unjusti fied, bypassed  the safeguarding of the children's \nemotional, psychological, and physical well -being.

On February 1st, 2024, during the third hearing, the substantive issues I had raised were \nnot addressed, nor was there any exchange of evidence between our legal representatives. \nDespite the focus of the hearing supposed to be on the protective order, the discussions \nveered into custody and child support matters. My lawyer presented the sole option of a \ntemporary return to the family home for 30 days with expanded visitation rights, coupled \nwith a child support obligation  starting in April. This outcome, which diverged significantly \nfrom the case's core issues, compelled me to reconsider my legal representation. \nConsequently, I decided to terminate my attorney's services and embarked on drafting this \nmotion myself, aiming to bring the court's  attention back to the pivotal elements of the case \nthat had thus far been neglected  while able to legally reside in my home . \n \nCONCLUSION AND PRAYER  \nIn conclusion, this motion has laid bare the stark realities and procedural aberrations that have \nmarred the essence of justice and due process in the matter of Cause No. 322 -744263 -23. \nThrough the course of these proceedings, it has become abundantly clea r that the actions taken \nby the Petitioner, Morgan Michelle Myers, have not only disregarded the welfare and best \ninterests of our children but have also illuminated her unfitness as a parent. Her actions speak \nto a pattern of deceit, manipulation, and an unsettling willingness to leverage the judicial \nsystem for personal vendettas, all at the expense of the emotional and psychological well -being \nof our children.  \n \nThe court, in its decisions, inadvertently facilitated this troubling trajectory by removing me, \nCharles Dustin Myers, from the lives of our children based on unsubstantiated claims and \nwithout due consideration of my role as a devoted and stable parent.

Breceda v. Whi, 187 S. W.3d 148, 152 \n(Tex. App. --El Paso 2006, no pet.); Kelly v. Murphy, 630 S. W.2d 759, 761 \n(Tex.

Here, however , this presumption is to be rebutted for the \nforegoing reasons: Morgan Michelle Myers,  \nPetitioner,  \nv.

WILDER\nDISTRICT CLERK\n\n2 I. Legal Basis for Rule 12 Motion\n2.Pursuant to Tex. R. Civ. P. \u00a7 12, a party may challenge an attorney\u2019s\nauthority to act on behalf of a party in a proceeding. When such a challenge is \nraised, the burden of proof shifts to the challenged attorney to demonstrate \ntheir authority to represent the party. Id. The attorney must appear before the \ntrial court and show sufficient authority to prosecute or defend the suit on \nbehalf of their client. (Breceda v. Whi (2006) 187 S. W.3d 148, 152; Kelly v. \nMurphy (1982) 630 S. W.2d 759, 761). \n3.Rule 12 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure permits any party to\nchallenge an attorney\u2019s authority to prosecute "}

Whi (2006) 187 S. W.3d 148, 152; Kelly v. \nMurphy (1982) 630 S. W.2d 759, 761). \n3.Rule 12 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure permits any party to\nchallenge an attorney\u2019s authority to prosecute or defend a lawsuit. (See Nolana \nOpen MRI Ctr., Inc. v. Pecher o (2015) No. 13-13-00552-CV , at *15). The \npurpose of a Rule 12 motion is to protect parties from groundless suits and to \npermit dismissal of suits instituted without authority. (See Nicholas v. Envtl. \nSys. (Int\u2019l) Ltd. (2016) 499 S.W.3d 888, 895; Angelina Ct y. v. McFarland \n(1964) 374 S. W.2d 417, 422\u201323). \n4.Here, the procedural inconsistencies, lack of formal notice, and\nsubmission of documents by other parties on behalf of Ms. Carter raise \nsubstantial doubts about whether she possesses the necessary authority to \nrepresent the Petitioner . Despite being allegedly retained on January 22, 2024, \nMs. Carter has not filed a formal notice of appearance, leaving her role \nambiguous. Further complicating matters, filings under her name have been \nsubmitted by others, including the founder of Marx Altman & Johnson, her \npurported former employer. Coupled with her suspiciously timed State Bar \nprofile update and lack of meaningful engagement, these facts compel the \nRespondent to seek clarification and challenge her authority under Rule 12.\n\n3 II.Procedural Basis\n5.No Formal Notice of  Appearance Filed.  Although Cooper Carter\nwas allegedly retained on January 22, 2024, she has not filed a formal Notice \nof Appearance in this case. The absence of a Notice of Appearance creates \nsubstantial ambiguity regarding her authority to represent the Petitioner, especially given the procedural irregularities discussed below.   \n6.Lack of engagement.  Throughout the proceedings, Ms. Carter\nhas cons istently failed to engage in any meaning ful way  and has failed \nto respond to any pleadings  in the suit.  \n7.Filings Sub mitted on Behalf of Cooper Carter . All court\ndocuments and pleadings attributed to Ms. Carter have "}

All court\ndocuments and pleadings attributed to Ms. Carter have been submitted \"on her \nbehalf\" by Roderick Marx , the founder of Marx Altman & Johnson . There \nis no indication that Ms. Carter  is directly involved in this matter, raising \nsignificant questions about whether she is properly authorized to act as \ncounsel for Morgan Michelle Myers.  \n8.Discr epancies in employment. On Ms. Carter \u2019s public social\nmedia,  she claims to be a former attorney for Marx Altman & Johnson and \nclaims to be employed currently with Cantey Hanger LLP.\n1 The timeliness of \nher profile aligns with the public article releas ed by Cantey Hanger LLP \n1 Ms. Carter's public LinkedIn pro\ufb01le\n\n4 themselves.2 Further, Every attorney in Texas is required by law to maintain a \ncurrent and up-to-date profile. Tex. Gov\u2019 t Code \u00a7 81. 115. Notably, Ms. \nCarter\u2019 s profile was updated on March 13th, 2024, one day prior to the only \nhearing that has occurred in this matter3 to her former employer . The \nRespondent has actively been seeking relief from the result of the \naforementioned hearing for nearly seven months without any engagement or \nany authoritative activity from Ms. Carter , thus warranting this motion.  \nIII.Prayer and Relief\n9.Given the ongoing procedural irregularities and the apparent lack of\nclarity surrounding Cooper Carter\u2019s authority to represent Petitioner Morgan \nMyers , the Respondent respectfully requests the following: \ni. The Court should schedule a hearing requiring Cooper Carter to\npersonally appear and definitively prove her authority to represent\nMorgan Myers , and to provide clarification as to who is involved in\nthe case, and in what capacity Morgan Michelle Myers is being\nrepres ented  in this matter.\nii. \"Upon [her] failure to show such authority, the  court shall refuse\nto permit the attorney to appear in  the cause,  and shall st"}
