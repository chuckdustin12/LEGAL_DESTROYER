Respondent explained how Daniel\u2019s actions had directly undermined the financial and emotional stability of the children, both currently and in the foreseeable future.

The admitted  actions of Daniel Kenneth Branthoover and Morgan \nMichelle Myers  have violated criminal statutes  under Texas law  and \nhave undermined this State\u2019s interest in protecting the best interests of the Children by deceiving this Court . The specific criminal \nviolations include:  \nDKT-215:010\n\na. Daniel Kenneth Branthoover has impersonated a public \nservant by presenting himself as an attorney and performed  \nlegal acts without a license  such as requesting discovery, \nadvising Morgan Michelle Myers to t ransfer the available \nfunds in the marital estate to herself, directly influenced the pleadings in this case , and has caused significant and \nongoing harm on the Children and the Respondent in this case.  \u201cA person commits an offense if they impersonate a \npublic servant with intent to induce another to submit to their pretended official authority or to rely on their pretended official acts. This offense is a felony of the third degree.\u201d Texas Penal Code  \u00a7 37.11.  \nb.

Both Morgan Michelle Myers and Daniel Kenneth \nBranthoover knowingly and willingly committed acts of perjury. The perjury occurred when they conspired to transfer joint finances to Morgan through Daniel\u2019s PayPal account  and immediately  following this act  proceeded to  file \nfor divorce swearing an affidavit of inability to pay costs  and \nthat an active order of protection existed against the Respondent . This affidavit was made under oath with the \nintent to deceive the court regarding her financial status , a \nclear violation of Texas Penal Code \u00a7 37.02(a)(1).  \nVIII. CONCLUSION  \n32. The actions taken by Morgan Michelle Myers and Daniel Kenneth Branthoover are not only legally reprehensible but also morally indefensible. Their calculated scheme to remove the Respondent , a \ndedicated stay -at-home father, from the lives of his children has \ncaused significant emotional and financial harm. By conspiring to fraudulently transfer joint finances, filing a deceitful affidavit of inability to pay costs, and manipulating legal pro cesses through \nperjury and impersonation, they have engaged in a toxic and egregious civil conspiracy , committed fraud, and destabilized the \nDKT-215:012\n\nlives of the minor children of this case for the sole benefit of \nMorgan Michelle Myers.  \n33. The Respondent has been the primary caregiver for his children, providing them with emotional support and stability. The deliberate efforts of Morgan and Daniel to sever this vital relationship have disrupted the children's lives, depriving them of the love and care they rely on.

This malicious intent to manipulate the court and inflict \nharm on Charles and his children cannot be overlooked.  \n34. While Margie Evonne Wilson's actions contributed to the harm caused, it is important to acknowledge that the Respondent does not believe her intent was driven by malice. The Respondent believes \nMargie was manipulated and placed in a difficult position by both Morgan and Daniel. Her inclusion into the case is necessary for the relief being sought regarding the preservation of the property.  \n35. Given the severity of these actions, it is imperative that this Court take decisive action. The Respondent respectfully requests that the \nCourt grant the relief sought, enjoin the responsible third parties, and if deemed necessary - forward the information regarding the  \ncriminal violations to the appropriate state prosecutors for further investigation . The well -being of the children and the integrity of the \nlegal system demand nothing less.  \n36. While Morgan Michelle Myers has committed criminal offenses in  \nthis State, the Respondent would request this court not pursue \nDKT-215:013\n\ncriminal charges against her as it would not serve the best interests \nof the Children.  \nXI. PRAYER AND RELIEF  \n29. Respondent requests the following relief:  \n1.
