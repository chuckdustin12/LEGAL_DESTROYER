EV ANS OF THE 8TH \nADMINISTRATIVE JUDICIAL REGION OF TEXAS:  \n COMES NOW, Respondent, Charles Dustin Myers, who respectfully submits this \nresponse in opposition to Petitioner\u2019s Motion for Sanctions and Request for Attorney\u2019s Fees, and \nin support thereof, shows the Court the following:  \nI. BACKGROUND  \n1. On January 22, 2024, Cooper L. Carter was allegedly retained by Morgan Michelle \nMyers in the lobby of the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County, where her signature first \nappears on an Associate Judge\u2019s Report. See Exhibit 1 .  \n\u00a7 \n\u00a7 \n\u00a7 \n\u00a7 \n\u00a7 \n\u00a7 \n\u00a7 \n\u00a7 \n\u00a7 \n\u00a7 \n\u00a7 \n\u00a7\n\n2 \n 2. On January 31, 2024,  RODERICK D. MARX, a party who has not made an appearance \nin this case to date, filed on behalf of Cooper Carter  a pleading entitled \u201cFirst Amended \nPetitioner for Divorce\u201d. See Exhibit 2.  \n3. This document states the follow pertaining to her \u201cservices\u201d:  \n \u201cIt was necessary for Petitioner to secure the services of Cooper L. Carter, a \n licensed  attorney, to prepare and prosecute this suit. To effect an equitable \n division of the estate of the  parties and as a part of the division, and for services \n rendered in connection with conservatorship and support of the children, \n judgment for attorney's fees, expenses, and costs through trial and appeal should \n be granted against Respondent and in favor of Petitioner for the use and benefit of \n Petitioner's attorney and be ordered pa"}

Petitioner requests \n postjudgment interest as allowed by  law.\u201d  \n- Exhibit 2 , 8-9 \u00b616.  \n4. RODERICK D. MARX has never made an appearance in this case and has filed every \ndocument on Cooper Carter\u2019s behalf. In total there has been just three documents submitted, \nwhich amount to a \u201cMotion for Pre -Trial Conference\u201d  filed on April 24, 2024, a \u201cMotion to \nConsolidate\u201d  in April of 2025, and the most recent document being the \u201cMotion for Sanctions \nand Request for Attorney\u2019s Fees\u201d on October 2, 2025, which is the motion at issue.  \n5. Cooper L. Carter, after fraudulently securing a court order from Judge Jeffrey Kaitcer on \nMarch 14, 2024, now seeks $10,000 in sanctions regarding a motion that she never responded to. Notwithstanding the fact that her motion is facially invalid for faili ng to provide exhibits \njustifying the $10,000 amount, she misrepresents to the Court that the Respondent\u2019s motions are \u201cfrivolous\u201d. See Exhibit 4 . \n6. Cooper L. Carter does not have standing to declare Respondent\u2019s motions \u201cfrivolous\u201d, as \nshe has provided no response to any of them. This is a blatant attempt to leverage her status as a licensed attorney to subvert the rule of law when, as the record cle arly shows, she has been\n\n3 \n absent from these proceedings  and has not performed any duties one would expect from an \nattorney licensed to practice law.  \nII. ANALYSIS  \n7. The record reflects that Roderick D. Marx, who has not made an appearance in the case, \nhas filed pleadings on behalf of Cooper Carter, and there is ambiguity as to whether Cooper \nCarter is the attorney of record for the petitioner. This is precisely why Cooper L. Carter was served a Rule 12 Motion on September  20"}

This is precisely why Cooper L. Carter was served a Rule 12 Motion on September  20, 2024, which she has yet to provide a response to. \nThis creates several procedural concerns : \n i.  First , if Cooper Carter is not the attorney of record, or if filings are being made  \n  by someone without authority, the request for attorney\u2019s fees and sanctions is  \n  procedurally improper and should be denied. The Texas Civil Practice and   \n  Remedies Code \u00a7 10.001 and Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 13 both require that  \n  pleadings and motions be signed by an attorney or party with proper authority,  \n  and the signature constitutes a certification of good faith and proper purpose. If a  \n  pleading or motion is filed or signed by someone who is not the attorney of record \n  or who lacks authority to represent the party, the filing is procedurally   \n  improper and may be subject to sanctions itself (Tex. Civ. Prac. and Rem. Code \u00a7  \n  10.001;  Tex. R. Civ. P. 13).  \nii.  Second, the request for attorney\u2019s fees must be supported by clear evidence of the \n services rendered and the reasonableness of the fees sought. In this case, the\n request for $10,000 in attorney\u2019s fees is based on the filing of a small number of \n documents over a two-year period, and there is no evidence provided to support \n the reasonableness or necessity of the fees. Texas courts require that attorney\u2019s\n\n4 \n  fees be reasonable and necessary, and the party seeking fees bears the burden of \n proof (Shilling v. Gough, 393 S.W.3d 555 (Tex. App. 2013)). \niii. Third , the procedural irregularity of having pleadings filed by someone who has \n not made an appearance in the case further undermines the validity of the request \n for attorney\u2019s fees and sanctions. Texas law requires strict compliance with \n procedural rules regarding representation and the signing of pleadings, and any \n deviation f"}

Civ. Prac. and Rem. \n Code \u00a7 10.001;  Tex. R. Civ. P. 13).  \n8.  The record also reflects that  Cooper L. Carter seeks $10,000 in sanctions regarding a \nmotion that 1) was never filed and 2) to which no opposition was filed. Instead, this motion for \nsanctions was filed in response to this Court\u2019s erroneous order which, for the second time, \nmisrepresented the pleadings filed by the Respondent.  \nIII. CONCLUSION  \n9. This response was more of a formality. The violations that continue to occur in this case \ncan only be attributed to a willful disregard for the law. The Court is actively choosing to condone the behavior of Cooper L. Carter to the Respondent\u2019s detriment, a nd the Court is hereby \nput on notice that Respondent will be initiating a Federal RICO Claim against Judge James Munford, Judge Jeff Kaitcer, Court Coordinator Lindsey Baker, and Attorney Cooper L. Carter.  \n10. The collective actions of these individuals have created a systemic breakdown of justice, \na mockery of the Texas legal system, and the record before this Court that has been meticulously crafted by the Respondent , exists in the public domain , and remains unopposed by any party.  \n11. For all reasons stated herein, Petitioner\u2019s Motion for Sanctions should be DENIED.\n\n5 12. A copy of this pleading will be mailed to the Tom Vandergriff Civil Courts Building 100\nN Calhoun St, 2nd Floor Fort Worth, TX 76196. \nIV. PRYER\n13.
