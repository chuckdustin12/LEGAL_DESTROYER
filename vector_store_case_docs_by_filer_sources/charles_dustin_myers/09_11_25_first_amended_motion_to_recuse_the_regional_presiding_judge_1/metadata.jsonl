By neglecting the \nresponsibilit ies of his position of power, David L. Evans has inadvertently  aided in the furtherance \nof the RICO enterprise\u2019s  primary objective: to secure a fraudulent final decree of divorce  and \nescape accountability . \nAs the record establishes, the Respondent has exhausted every appellate and administrative \nremedy in an attempt to seek redress . Unopposed relief continues to be denied, and more  predicate \nacts in furtherance of the enterp rise\u2019s affairs continue to occur.  \nFor the forthcoming reasons, David L. Evans must recuse fr om this matter :\n\n3 II. GROUNDS FOR RECUSAL\nA.Disregard for Recusal Procedure\n1.Texas law mandates strict adherence to procedural safeguards in the recusal process to\nensure both actual and apparent judicial impartiality. When a court coordinator \u2014who is not a \nneutral party and serves at the pleasure of the judge subject to recusal \u2014handles the \nadministrative delivery of a recusal motion, th"}

When a court coordinator \u2014who is not a \nneutral party and serves at the pleasure of the judge subject to recusal \u2014handles the \nadministrative delivery of a recusal motion, this contravenes the explicit requirements of Rule \n18a(e) and creates an appearance of impropriety.  \n2. David L. Evans has allowed the coordinator Lindsey Baker \u2013 not the clerk \u2013 to handle\nthe duties the legislature explicitly designates to court clerks. Rule 18a(e)(2) plainly stat es that \n\u201c\u2026when a respondent judge signs and files an order of recusal or referral, the clerk of the court must immediately deliver a copy to the regional presiding judge. \u201d  \n3. Furthermore, as Rule 18(a)(f)(3) also plainly states , \u201c\u2026if the respondent judge fails to\ncomply with a duty imposed by this rule, the movant may notify the regional presiding judge.\u201d \n4. Here, the Regional Presiding Judge was notified of and provided with a modified\nversion of the recusal motion rather than the original, and was notified of these discrepancies, but \nchose to ignore them. B.Recusal  Tampering\n5. The record facially establishes that on October 7, 2024, the Respondent filed a Joint\nMotion to Recuse Honorable Judges James Munford and Jeffrey Kaitcer from the matter and provided supporting evidence which is self -authenticating under the Texas Rules of Evidence. \n6. The following day, on October 8 at 4:42 P.M., correspondence was received from court\ncoordinator Lindsey Baker regarding the order of referral. REC. 1277\n\n4 7. Upon inspection, it was discovered that the affidavit and exhibits were both missing\nfrom the motion  which was sent to the Regional Judge, and this was quickly pointed out to the \ncoordinator.  \n8. She confirms that the exhibits were indeed filed  electronically  but as the clerk \u2019s office\nprefers \u2013 they were filed as one document, just  as the Tarrant County District Clerk \u2019s Filing FAQ \nstates : \nQ: \u201cWhat process should be used for eFiling exhibits?\u201d  \nA: \u201cSame process for exhibit a"}

See  25-0361, 25-\n0367, 25-0378.  \n 14. In the midst of these efforts, James Munford continued to ignore the issues and after \nthe SAPCR was improperly consolidated by Judge Newell, Judge Munford chose to move the case towards final deposition , which was promptly objected to and ignored the same. REC. 2480. \n 15. These actions lead to the second recusal motion,  facially naming James Munford as \nthe respondent judge. REC. 2488. \n 16. This time, David Evans addressed two major issues raised in an objection by the Respondent:   i. The continued involvement of Lindsey Baker, the court coordinator; \n  ii. The erroneous order of referral sent by Judge Kaitcer; REC. 2620  \n 17. In his order, he argued that  \n\u201cThe court coordinators and clerks work together to assist the trial judges and the administrative \njudges.

A ll that was received in response to these efforts was \u201c Denied, per curiam \u201d. \nRespondent understands that the Court of appeals has the d iscretion to is sue such explanations, \nhowever, given the scope of these issues , they cannot be addressed at final disposition, and based \non everything above, there  no reasonable possibility  that one would think that there could be a \nfair and impartial trial  given these circumstances .

The regional judge\u2019s repeated failure to follow mandatory recusal procedures \u2014by \ndenying hearings on recusal motions, involving non-neutral staff, and failing to provide meaningful appellate remedies \u2014constitutes a pattern of procedural irregularities that violates \nboth statutory requirements and the fundamental due process right to a fair and impartial tribunal.

The Regional Presiding Judge, Honorable David L. Evans, has been directly involved in\nhandling multiple recusal proceedings related to my case, and has consistently failed tofollow the mandatory procedures required by Texas law, as detailed below.\n4.I have exhausted all available appellate and administrative remedies in my attempts toseek redress. Despite filing multiple mandamus petitions with the Texas Supreme Court(cause numbers 25-0361, 25-0367, 25-0378, 25-0426, and 25-0458), I have received only\"Denied, per curiam\" responses without substantive consideration of the seriousprocedural violations occurring in my case.\n\n9 \n PROCEDURAL VIOLATIONS  \n5.

On October 8, 2024, at 4:42 P.M., I received correspondence from court coordinator \nLindsey Baker regarding the order of referral. Upon inspection, I discovered that both my \naffidavit and supporting exhibits had been removed from the motion that was sent to  \nRegional Judge Evans.  \n7. I immediately notified the court coordinator that the exhibits and affidavit were missing from the materials sent to Judge Evans.

This time, the coordinator claimed that the \"size of the motion\" justified splitting it into three separate files, this time including the exhibits and affidavit that had been previously omitted, thereby contradicting the earlier handling of the motion.  \n10. These actions directly violated Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a(e)(2), which explicitly states: \"When a respondent judge signs and files an order of recusal or referral, the clerk of the court must immediately deliver a copy to the regional presiding jud ge.\"\n\n10 \n 11. The law does not permit a court coordinator, who serves at the pleasure of the judge \nsubject to recusal, to handle this sensitive procedural matter. Instead of the neutral clerk of court processing these materials as required by statute, the court coordinator for the very judge whose impartiality was being questioned took possession of and modified the \nrecusal motion.  \nOBJECTIONS AND LACK  OF REMEDY  \n12. I timely filed formal objections to these procedural irregularities, including documentation of all email exchanges with the coordinator and the modifications made to my original motion.  \n13. My objection specifically stated that \"the explanation changed to the document being too large. This inconsistency raises concerns about transparency and procedural fairness.\"  \n14.

The continued involvement of Lindsey Baker, the court coordinator; and  \nb. The erroneous order of referral sent by Judge Kaitcer.  \n17.
