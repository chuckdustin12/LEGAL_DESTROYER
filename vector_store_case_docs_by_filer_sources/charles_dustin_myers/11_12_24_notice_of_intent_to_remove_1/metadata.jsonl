INTRODUCTION \nRespondent, Relator, Defendant; representing himself in \nhis own individual capacity as CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, hereby \nrefrains from referring to himself in third person.  \n I find it to be repugnant. In reality, I\u2019m simply a \nfather. A father who was brought into this situation during \nthe most precious time of year.  Now, while I have the \nhighest respect for the judiciary, this court, and all of \nits\u2019 participants \u2013  today you have all left me scratching \nmy head as to how after passing through two judges, a panel \nof three judges in the Second Court of Appeals followed by \nthe entire court en banc, seven Justices at the highest \nlevel of the Texas judiciary, a regional presiding Judge, \nand a visiting retired Judge, in all of their collective \nexperience, could not see the issues within this case. \n Perhaps most shocking is how after over 1,500 pages of \ndocuments, pictures, sworn statements, and most importantly \n\u2013 without any opposition or engagement with any part of it \nfrom our friends on the other side, it\u2019s not enough to \novercome the apparent, deep- seated antagonism that has only \nleft more questions unanswered and fraud unaddressed.\n\nI am here not out of disrespect, but because I was \ncompelled to be here. I am not seeking the world from this \ncourt, only answers. The relief I seek is not that of impossibility \u2013 but is that which is enshrined in the most \nfundamental protections our coun\ntry has to offer. It\u2019s a \nrelief that has been continuously denied time and time \nagain, without any explanation.  \nIn fact, the latest denial actually makes the most \nsense out of any order issued so far in this case, so for "}

However, the latest denial, albeit legally justified on face value, was made in error, and the only exhibit attached to this motion is the reasons why I \nbelieve this to be true.  \nII.ISSUE\nA. EFM ISSUES PREVENTED THE FILING OF A CONTINUANCE\n1. Exhibit A is attached hereto for the purpose of\ndemonstrating a re\n-occurring theme in this case. Not only \ndid I have every intention of coming to the hearing, but \ngiven the circumstances, did everything in my power to \ncommunicate regarding the situation.\n\n2. These efforts only came second to the rules of law. \nThe inability to access the EFM at such a crucial juncture \nwas communicated to the court and all parties relevant to \nthe matter.   \n3. Furthermore, the circumstances in this case have \nleft me in a persistent state of planning for an inevitable appeal, such as here, where a denial as issued at the first opportunity and allows the court to escape any explanation \nfor the important questions being asked of it.  \n4. Given that my access to the EFM was unavailable \nduring the crucial time that a sworn continuance should \nhave been filed, it raises more questions which require \nanswers to protect my rights that have been continuously \nviolated. For example, given the circumstances, I can\u2019t \nrely on the reason being a technicality regarding the EFM.  \nB. THE DENIAL ONLY CREATES MORE UNADDRESSED ISSUES \n5. The problem I have with this decision is that the \ndenial states that the opposing party appeared and that no \nevidence was admitted \u2013  but makes no mention of the \nagreement made by the parties, the circumstances, and as\n\nmentioned, raises more questions without any answers being \nprovided.  \n6.

This would leave one to believe that despite the \nmutual agreement, the opposing party showed up anyway and \nacted as if no agreement was made notwithstanding that it \nmentioned that she appeared by her attorney of record, which is currently under scrutiny and remains on the long \nlist of unanswered questions. \nIII. NO FURTHER STATE REMEDIES \n 7. After nearly eleven months of seeking answers, only more \nquestions have arisen.  \n 8. If the court wishes to revisit the denial of the recusal \ngiven the circumstances pointed out, or in the alternative, \nadopt the still-pending motion to enter judgement and original, unmodified joint motion to recuse, it has the discretion to do so. \n 9. I am awaiting proper service of the denial via the \nelectronic filing manager as required by law, and upon receipt \nwill be removing the case to federal district court to address the ongoing constitutional issues that the State refuses to address.\n\n10. The court in its perspective may see me as a \nnuisance, a pest, a fool. However, when taking a step back \nand looking at the full picture \u2013  it\u2019s worth a thousand \nwords, as they say: \n \nYou\u2019ll notice \u2013  no Cooper Carter. This picture is a \ncollection of all case files available on the EFM up until \nthe recusal was filed and is a combination of case numbers \n24-0395, 02-24-00149-CV, 322-744538-23, and 322- 744263-23 \nin the order in which they were filed.\n\n11. I\u2019ve genuinely tried to provide every opportunity \nto the State to rectify this situation to no avail. \n \n12. The recusal wouldn\u2019t be necessary and is not a \nreflection of the judges in this case. I\u2019ve attempted every \nother legal avenue to accomplish such task to no avail, \nwhich leads us here. I hope the court can respect that.   \n13. I hope the court will reconsider its\u2019 denial of the \nrecusal or do what is right so that the recusal will be \nmoot. Until the current orders are either vacated "}

Until the current orders are either vacated or \nlegally justified, I must continue to fight for my family, \nwhich requires that I  seek federal intervention.\n\nIV. BASIS FOR REMOVAL \n14. Defendant, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, in the above-\ncaptioned matter hereby provides notice of intent to remove \nthis action to the United States District Court for the \nNorthern District of Texas pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441(a) \nand \u00a7 1441(c)(1)(A). Removal is sought on the basis of \nsubstantial federal questions arising from alleged \nviolations of Defendant\u2019s due process rights, procedural \nnegligence, and claims of unaddressed fraudulent actions by \nPlaintiff. Defendant submits the following in support of \nremoval: \nA. Federal Question Jurisdiction Due to Violations of Due \nProcess Rights \n15. This case raises significant federal questions \nunder the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution, \nspecifically regarding Defendant\u2019s right to due process. \nDefendant asserts that his due process rights have been repeatedly violated due to procedural negligence by the state court and the imposition of an agreement that was \nobtained through fraudulent claims by Plaintiff, without proper judicial scrutiny or procedural safeguards. The\n\nstate court has taken actions that have fundamentally \ndeprived Defendant of a fair opportunity to present his \ncase, as evidenced by the following: \ni. Plaintiff\u2019s initial claims, including the \nunsubstantiated allegation of an active protective \norder, were not subjected to adequate evidentiary \nreview or discovery. Instead, these claims were used to pressure Defendant into a settlement agreement that has \nsince been revealed to be grounded in \nmisrepresentation. The lack of judicial oversight in \nthis process has effectively deprived Defendant of the \nability to defend his rights and property, consti"}

The lack of judicial oversight in \nthis process has effectively deprived Defendant of the \nability to defend his rights and property, constituting \na direct violation of due process. \nii. The state court compelled Defendant to accept \nand sign a settlement agreement that Plaintiff obtained \nthrough alleged fraudulent representations. When Defendant contested the validity of this agreement, the \ncourt disregarded his objections and ordered him to \ncomply without further review. This compelled \ncompliance without scrutiny or due process fails to\n\nmeet the fundamental fairness standards established \nunder the 14th Amendment. \niii. Plaintiff\u2019s actions, including conversion, \nperjury, fraud upon the court, and intentional \ndestruction of marital assets remain unaddressed by the \nstate court, which has shown procedural negligence in \nallowing these issues to persist without a fair review process. The absence of required discovery and \nevidentiary procedures further denies Defendant an \nopportunity to contest these fraudulent claims, \ndepriving him of a fundamental right to a fair trial.  \nB. Failure of the State Court to Provide an Adequate Remedy \n16. The state court has demonstrated an unwillingness \nor inability to provide an adequate remedy in this matter, \nas illustrated by its failure to address the core issues at \nthe heart of Defendant\u2019s claims. Defendant has repeatedly \nraised these issues before the state court, challenging the \nauthenticity of Plaintiff\u2019s claims and the procedural fairness of the settlement agreement. However, the court \nhas continually declined to address these fundamental\n\nissues, thereby failing to provide Defendant with an \neffective state remedy. \n17. Upon filing the Joint Mo tion to Recuse, the court \nchose to stop recording the pleadings on the EFM, chose ot \nmodify the Defendant\u2019 s documents upon forwarding them to \nthe 8th Administrative Regional Judge, and the state court \nis"}

The state court\u2019s avoidance of key claims\u2014 such as \nPlaintiff\u2019s conversion of marital assets, her perjurious \nstatements, and intentional destruction of community \nproperty\u2014 has further deprived Defendant of the opportunity \nto have these matters fairly adjudicated. Defendant \ncontends that these fraudulent actions go directly to the \nheart of his claims and that the state court\u2019s avoidance of \nthese matters amounts to a failure of procedural justice.\n\nThis avoidance underscores the need for federal \nintervention, as the state court has failed to uphold \nDefendant\u2019s right to due process and a fair hearing. \nC. Domestic Relations Exception Does Not Apply \n19. The Domestic Relations Exception does not bar \nfederal jurisdiction in this case, as Defendant is not \nseeking federal court adjudication of traditional family \nlaw issues such as divorce or custody. Rather, this removal \nis sought to address alleged due process violations, fraudulent claims, and procedural negligence that have \ndeprived Defendant of his federally protected rights. \nDefendant seeks federal review to rectify the imposition of \na fraudulent settlement agreement that was coerced through \nmisrepresentation, extending beyond the traditional boundaries of domestic relations issues. Therefore, the Domestic Relations Exception does not apply to preclude federal review of the due process violations and fraudulent \nact"}

Therefore, the Domestic Relations Exception does not apply to preclude federal review of the due process violations and fraudulent \nactions central to this case. \nD. Rooker- Feldman Doctrine Does Not Apply \n20. The Rooker-Feldman Doctrine does not bar removal \nbecause the state court has not issued a final judgment.\n\nAll current orders remain interlocutory, and Defendant is \nnot seeking to challenge any final state court decision. \nDefendant\u2019s removal is based on the need for federal review \nof ongoing procedural violations and due process issues that have not yet reached final adjudication in the state \ncourt. Since there is no final judgment, the Rooker- Feldman \nDoctrine does not apply to prevent federal intervention in \nthis matter. \nE. Younger Abstention Doctrine Does Not Apply \n21. The Younger Abstention Doctrine generally bars \nfederal intervention in active state proceedings. However, \nit does not apply here because Defendant is not attempting \nto disrupt the state court\u2019s core jurisdiction over family \nlaw matters. Instead, Defendant seeks federal review due to ongoing procedural violations and unaddressed fraudulent actions by Plaintiff, which infringe upon Defendant\u2019s federal rights. Federal oversight is necessary to ensure \nthe protection of Defendant\u2019s due process rights and to \naddress the state court\u2019s failure to enforce procedural \nsafeguards or address Plaintiff\u2019s fraudulent actions.\n\nF. Ambiguity and Procedural Gaps Allow Removal Beyond the \n30-Day Window \n22. The ongoing procedural ambiguity and lack of \nresolution in the state proceedings justify removal beyond \nthe standard 30- day window. The state court\u2019s failure to \nscrutinize Plaintiff\u2019s claims, enforce discovery, or \nprovide clarifying documentation has created substantial ambiguity about the true basis for Plaintiff\u2019s allegations \nand the validity of the coerced settlement agreement.

This \nambiguity effectively extends the removal window, as \nDefendant has not received adequate information to properly \naddress these ambiguous and procedurally flawed claims. \n23. Plaintiff\u2019s initial pleadings contain \nunsubstantiated claims impacting Defendant\u2019s rights, and \nthe state court\u2019s failure to require discovery has prevented Defendant from understanding the basis for these claims. Due to the state court\u2019s lack of procedural \nenforcement and transparency, Defendant\u2019s right to remove \nremains valid until clarification and compliance with \nprocedural standards are achieved.\n\n24. Additionally, Defendant notes that the state court \nhas the discretion to reconsider its prior denial, as it \nhas not been formally served in compliance with Texas Rules of Civil Procedure 21a and showcases an unwillingness to \naddress the issues herein. Should the court choose not to \nreconsider its prior ruling, Defendant intends to exercise \nhis right to remove the case to federal court upon receipt of the denial, as outlined in the present notice, pursue \nrelief from damages from Plaintiff.  \nV. CONCLUSION AND PRAYER \n In the instant case, the troubling reality of the \ncourt\u2019s initial decision will bear a lifetime of \nconsequence on the lives of the children it has left out of \nthe equation.  \nGiven the significant procedural and factual issues in this \ncase, Respondent respectfully requests the Court adopt one \nof the following remedies to ensure a fair and just \noutcome: \n1. Recuse Judges James Munford and Jeffrey Kaitcer from \nfurther proceedings, or:\n\n2. Alternatively, deny the recusal but with instructions \nthat the Honorable James Munford:  \no Vacate the current temporary orders which are \nfraudulent;  \no Adopt the temporary orders and parenting plan \nsubmitted by Respondent, designed to prioritize the children's sta"}
