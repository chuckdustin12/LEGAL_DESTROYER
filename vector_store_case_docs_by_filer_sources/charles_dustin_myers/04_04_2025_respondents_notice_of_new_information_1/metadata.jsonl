The 233\nrd district court blatantly denied the Respondent due process in the \nface o f COOPER L. CARTER \u2019s false promise.  \n14. COOPER L.

This litigation has no possible means to an end, and it should be dismissed outright so that the SAPCR may continue. \n17. There has been no filed opposition, objection, or arguments made against the Respondent\u2019s position in either suit.  \n18. The Petitioner has wasted everyone\u2019 s time, cau sed significant damage, and \nremains hidden in fear of being held accountable. \n19. The Petitioner prioritized an extramarital affair over prosecuting the divorce, and the children and Respondent have been signi ficantly harmed.  \nTherefore, this case should be dismissed as a matter of law.
