Affirmative Defenses  \n5. Without waiving the foregoing general denial, Respondent pleads the following \naffirmative defenses to Petitioner\u2019s claims:   \n     i. Waiver: Petitioner\u2019s conduct and delay in pursuing her allegations constitute a waiver \n of any claims inconsistent with that conduct. Petitioner intentionally relinquished or \n abandoned certain rights or positions (for example, by nonsuiting her prior claims and not \n actively pursuing relief for an extended period), and she cannot now revive those claims \n to Respondent\u2019s detriment.   \n     ii. Estoppel (Equitable and Judicial) : Petitioner is estopped from obtaining the relief \n she seeks because her own prior statements, filings, and conduct contradict her current \n allegations. Petitioner made representations (including in sworn statements to this or \n other courts) upon which Respondent and the Court relied, and it would be inequitable to \n allow her to assert positions contrary to those representations now. To the extent \n Petitioner previously urged a position or had facts adjudicated (such as the absence of \n family -violence findings in the protective order proceeding), she is judicially estopped  \n from taking an opposite position in this case.\n\n3 \n      iii. Laches:  Petitioner\u2019s unreasonable delay in raising certain allegations and claims has \n caused undue prejudice to Respondent. By waiting nearly two years to actively pursue \n allegations of abuse and other complaints (and only asserting them on the eve of \n significant court action), Petitioner has made it difficult or impossible for Respondent to \n adequately defend against those stale claims.

Unclean Hands:  Petitioner has acted with unclean hands by engaging in serious \n misconduct in relation to the matters before the Court. Petitioner\u2019s false accusations, \n fraud on the community, misuse of legal process, and other bad-faith litigation tactics \n directly relate to the subject of this suit and undermine her requests for equitable relief. \n The Court should deny Petitioner any equitable relief (such as a disproportionate property \n division or restrictions on Respondent) because her own conduct has been wrongful and \n in bad faith, and detrimental to the well being of the Children in this case.  \n     v. Limitations: To the extent that Petitioner\u2019s pleadings attempt to assert any causes of \n action independent of the divorce and conservatorship (for example, tort claims or other \n civil claims for damages), Respondent asserts that such claims are barred in whole or in \n part by applicable statutes of limitations . Petitioner should not be permitted to circumvent \n time limits for bringing claims by packaging them into a late-filed amended divorce \n petition. Respondent \u2019s allegations remain unrebutted on the record, and absent a \n response, Petitioner has not raised any defenses to the allegations brought against her.  \n Petitioner has shown a pattern of litigating only when to prevent an adverse ruling, and \n such conduct should not be tolerated by the Court.

Jurisdiction:  The Court has jurisdiction over this divorce proceeding, as well as over the \nchildren of the marriage, under the Texas Family Code.

Venue:  Venue is proper in Tarrant County, Texas, because it is the county of the parties\u2019 \nresidence and the county where the children reside. No other court has continuing, exclusive \njurisdiction over the children. This Court has jurisdiction to make custody dete rminations as a \nSuit Affecting the Parent -Child Relationship (\u201cSAPCR\u201d) in conjunction with the divorce.   \n8.  Protective Order Proceedings:  There are no active protective orders in effect between \nthe parties at this time. Petitioner did previously file an application for a family violence protective order (a Title IV protective order) in late 2023, but that proceeding was nonsuited and resulted in no finding of family violence. Thus, no protective order currently restrains Respondent, and no prior finding of family violence exists in this case.   \nE. Children of the Marriage   \n9.  Children:  Petitioner and Respondent are the parents of two minor children, namely \nM.E.M.  and C.R.M . M.E.M. and C.R.M. are the only children born to or adopted by the parties \nduring the marriage, and both are subjects of this suit. To the best of Respondent\u2019s knowledge, no other children were born to the Petitioner during the marriage, and Petitioner is  not pregnant at \nthis time.\n\n5 \n 10.  UCCJEA Disclosure:  In compliance with the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and \nEnforcement Act (Texas Family Code Chapter  152), Respondent states the following: The \nchildren have lived with both Petitioner and Respondent in the State of Texas for their entire \nlives (and c ertainly within the last five years).  \n11.

Residence History:  From their births until on or about March 6, 2024, the children \nresided with Petitioner or Respondent at the marital residence in Tarrant County, Texas. Since March 6, 2024, the children have resided primarily with Petitioner (their mother) in Tarrant \nCounty at the same marital residence (after Respondent  was illegally locked out by the \nPetitioner , as described below). The children have not lived outside the State of Texas at any time \nduring the past five years. Prior Custody Proceedings:  No court of any state has exercised \ncontinuing jurisdiction over the children prior to this case. Aside from the present suit, which \nincludes this SAPCR, there have been no prior or pending legal proceedings regarding custody \nor visitation of these childr en in any jurisdiction.  \n12. No CPS Conservatorship : The children are not under the managing conservatorship of \nthe Texas Department of Family and Protective Services (Child Protective Services), and, to \nRespondent\u2019s knowledge, no governmental agency or third party has claimed any custody or visitation righ ts with respect to the children.   \n13. No Prior Orders / Pending Actions:  Aside from the temporary orders issued in this case, no \nprior court orders  have been entered regarding the conservatorship, possession, or support of the \nchildren. Likewise, there is no pending action in any other court concerning the parent -child \nrelationship of these children. The temporary orders currently in place in this case (entered on or about March 24, 2024) were obtained by Petitioner through a  proceeding that lacked a full \nevidentiary hearing. Respondent asserts that those temporary orders \u2014 obtained under what he\n\n6 \n alleges were false pretenses \u2014 do not reflect the children\u2019s best interests and should be vacated \nfor intentional misrepresentations  made by the Petitioner and her alleged Counsel.   \nF.

Grounds for Divorce    \n14.  Insupportability:  Counter -Petitioner seeks a divorce on the no -fault ground of \ninsupportability, as provided by Texas Family Code \u00a7 6.001. The marriage has become insupportable due to discord or conflict of personalities between Petitioner and Respondent that has destroyed the legitimate ends of the marital relationship and prevents any reasonable expectation of reconciliation.   \n15.  Cruelty (Fault Grounds) : In the alternative, Respondent pleads the fault ground of cruel \ntreatment under Texas Family Code \u00a7  6.002. Petitioner\u2019s conduct toward Respondent during the \nmarriage has been cruel and intolerable, rendering further living together insupportable. Specific ally, Petitioner has engaged in extreme and intentionally harmful acts, including (but not \nlimited to) making false accusations of abuse, filing fraudulent or groundless legal pleadings, and causing Respondent to be excluded from the family home without a lawful basis. These actions \nconstitute cruel treatment. If proven, Petitioner\u2019s fault should be considered by the Court in making a just and right division of the community estate and in determining conservatorship and possession of the children.   \nG. Factual Background and Unrebutted Allegations    \n16.  Overview of Petitioner\u2019s Conduct:  Respondent\u2019s claims in this Third Amended \nCounter -Petition arise from a pattern of misconduct by Petitioner that, to date, remains \nessentially unrebutted in the record of this case. In late 2023 and 2024, Petitioner undertook a series of calculated action s designed to remove Respondent from the marital residence, deprive\n\n7 him of access to the parties\u2019 children, and gain an unfair advantage in this litigation. These \nactions included false claims of domestic violence, misuse of community assets, and manipulation of court procedures. Petitioner has never substantively"}

These \nactions included false claims of domestic violence, misuse of community assets, and manipulation of court procedures. Petitioner has never substantively answered or refuted the core facts underlying Respondent\u2019s allegations of this misconduct. The following facts, drawn from the court record (including the mandamus record from related appellate proceedings), are deemed or established and provide context for the re lief Respondent now seeks:   \ni. False Protective-Order Claim: Petitioner falsely asserted that an \u201cactive protective\norder\u201d was in place against Respondent, and further represented that a prior judicial finding of family violence had been made against him \u2013 when in fact no such order or finding ever existed. Petitioner did file a Title IV family -violence protective order \napplication in December 2023, but she later dropped (nonsuited) that proceeding, and it concluded with no finding of family violence or abuse by Respondent. Nevertheless, Petitioner invoked the illusion of an \u201cexisting\u201d protective order (and non-existent family -\n violence finding) to justify removing Respondent from the home and restricting his \naccess to the children. This misrepresentation was material, intentional, and patently false, and Petitioner has never corrected or explained it.   \nii. Removal of Respondent Without Legal Basis : On or about March 6, 2024,\nRespondent was excluded  from the marital residence and from the children\u2019s lives via a \nself-help eviction. The mandamus record from the appellate court confirms that \nRespondent was removed from the home \u201cwithout any factual basis, without holding an evidentiary hearing, and without eliciting any testimony\u201d from Petitioner. In other words, Petitioner orchestrated Respondent\u2019s ouster through self-help tactics and a temporary order obtained on false pretenses, rather than through any merit-based determination.\n\n8 \n  This removal violated Respondent\u2019s due process rights and disr"}

Petitioner never pursued a final protective order hearing after obtaining relief, \n effectively conceding that no true emergency or actual violence existed.  Any claims of \n an emergency now should be scrutinized by this Court.  \n    iii.  Misuse and Concealment of Community Assets:  Immediately prior to filing for \n divorce, Petitioner diverted and concealed community funds for her own use, in a manner \n designed to deprive Respondent of resources and to further Petitioner\u2019s personal \n objectives (including an extramarital relationship). Specifically, on or about December \n 15, 2023, Petitioner caused approximately $1,576 to be transferred from the parties\u2019 joint \n marital funds to a third party\u2019s PayPal account (believed to belong to Petitioner\u2019s \n stepfather, Mr. Branthoover). This transfer was done covertly in an effort to hide these \n funds from Respondent. Just days later, on December 18, 2023, Petitioner filed her \n Original Petition for Divorce, claiming to be indigent (unable to pay court fees) \n immediately after having siphoned off that $1,576. This transaction amounted to an \n actual fraud on the community estate intended to disadvantage Respondent. Petitioner has \n never denied or explained the disappearance of this money. In fact, when Respondent \n served Requests for Admission to confirm Petitioner\u2019s conduct (including the PayPal \n transfer to her stepfather\u2019s account), Petitioner failed to respond. By operation of law, \n Petitioner is deemed to have admitted  the $1,576 transfer and the related scheme to evict \n Respondent (Tex. R. Civ. P. 198.2(c)). T"}

These deemed admissions conclusively establish\n\n9 \n  that Petitioner misappropriated community funds and attempted to mislead the Court \n about the couple\u2019s financial situation.   \n    iv.  Procedural Misconduct and Bad-Faith Litigation: Petitioner effectively \n disengaged from this case for nearly two years after her initial filings, only to resurface at \n a critical juncture in an apparent effort to derail Respondent\u2019s progress. On November 24, \n 2025 \u2013 just one day before a hearing was set on Respondent\u2019s no-evidence motion for \n summary judgment \u2013 Petitioner filed a Second Amended Petition for Divorce brimming \n with brand-new allegations of long -term child abuse and neglect by Respondent. The \n timing and content of this filing strongly suggest that Petitioner sought to manufacture a \n last-minute \u201cemergency\u201d narrative to avoid an imminent adverse ruling (just as she did \n with the ex parte application at the case\u2019s outset). Notably, these late assertions flatly \n contradict the established record (including evidence in the mandamus record and \n Petitioner\u2019s deemed admissions) and were not accompanied by any new credible \n evidence. Petitioner has persisted in a discredited narrative \u2013 continuing to accuse \n Respondent of heinous conduct without evidentiary support \u2013 while ignoring the contrary \n proof on file. Texas courts have recognized such tactics as constituting bad-faith litigation \n and have approved sanctions in similar circumstances. Petitioner\u2019s Second Amended \n Petition and related filings appear calculated primarily to prolong her control over the \n residence and children, and to prevent a merits -based resolution of Respondent\u2019s claims, \n rather than to seek truth or justice.   \nH.

Best Interests of the Children  \n17.  All of the foregoing unrebutted facts demonstrate that Petitioner has subordinated the \nchildren\u2019s best interests to her own tactical aims. By falsely claiming the children were in danger\n\n10 \n and by excluding a loving parent (Respondent) from the home, Petitioner disrupted the children\u2019s \nstability and financial security without any legitimate justification. In contrast, Respondent has been the children\u2019s primary financial provider and a consist ently positive presence in their lives. \nThere is no credible evidence that Respondent has ever physically or emotionally abused the \nchildren or Petitioner. Indeed, no court or agency has made any finding of family violence or \nabuse by Respondent. Under Texas law, the best interest of the child  is \u201cthe primary \nconsideration\u201d in determinations of conservatorship, possession, and access (Tex. Fam. Code \u00a7 153.002). Moreover, absent credible evidence of a history or pattern of abuse, Texas public policy favors children having frequent and continuing contact with both parents in a safe, stable \nenvironment. Petitioner\u2019s conduct \u2013 involving false protective -order claims, a self -help eviction \nof Respondent, blocking communication between the children and Respondent, and repeated attempts to deny Responde nt access without evidence of danger \u2013 is exactly the type of behavior \nthat courts deem contrary to a child\u2019s best interests. In light of these facts, Respondent seeks the conservatorship and other relief outlined below to protect the children\u2019s welfare an d restore \nstability to their lives. (Notably, Petitioner\u2019s unilateral self -help eviction of March 6, 2024 has \nnever been substantiated with any proper evidence or justification.)   \nI.

Conservatorship Requested:  Respondent requests that he be appointed Sole Managing \nConservator of the minor children, with Petitioner to be appointed as a Possessory Conservator . \nAs sole managing conservator, Respondent would hold all rights and duties afforded by law to a managing conservator, including (but not limited to) the exclusive right to designate the children\u2019s primary residence. Respondent\u2019s appointment as sole managi ng conservator is in the \nchildren\u2019s best interest (Tex. Fam. Code \u00a7  153.002), given the circumstances described herein.\n\n11 \n Respondent is a fit and capable parent who has consistently acted in the children\u2019s best interests, \nproviding for their financial, educational, and emotional needs. By contrast, Petitioner\u2019s recent actions have destabilized the children\u2019s living situation and needlessly deprived them of their father without any legitimate cause. There is no credible evidence of any history or pattern of \nfamily violence or abuse by Respondent that would weigh against his conservatorship (see Tex. Fam. Code \u00a7 153.004). In fac t, the record affirmatively demonstrates an absence of any such \nfindings despite Petitioner\u2019s allegations to the contrary. Respondent further specifically rebuts the statutory presumption that appointing both parents as joint managing conservators is in the children\u2019s best interest (Tex. Fam. Code \u00a7  153.131).

The loss of the family home as a residence for Respondent and the children was a direct result of Petitioner\u2019s fraudulent filings and misrepresentations, not due to any conduct by Respondent that would justify removal.

Respondent has maintained (and continues to have) the financial ability to support and upkeep the home, and he is pre pared to provide a safe, stable environment there for the children. \nGranting Respondent exclusive use of the residence will ensure continuity and familiarity for the children and will help prevent further conflict between the parties.

Claims and Causes of Action Related to the Marriage    \n24.  Fraud on the Community (Waste of Assets):  Respondent asserts that Petitioner has \ncommitted fraud on the community by wrongfully disposing of, concealing, or wasting\n\n16 \n community assets, to the detriment of Respondent and the community estate. Texas Family Code \n\u00a7 7.009 provides that if a spouse has committed actual or constructive fraud on the community, the Court shall : (1) determine the value by which the community estate was depleted by the \nfraud; (2) create a \u201creconstituted estate\u201d as if the fraud had not occurred; and (3) divide the value \nof the reconstituted estate in a manner that is just and right (which may incl ude awarding a \nmoney judgment or an appropriate share of community property to the wronged spouse). In this case, Petitioner\u2019s surreptitious transfer of $1,576 in community funds on December 15, 2023, as described above, was a fraudulent depletion of the community estate. Petitioner acted with actual intent to deceive both Respondent and the Court by moving this money to a third party (Mr. Branthoover) and hiding it, all on the eve of filing for divorce. The transaction was not made for community purposes or in the ordinary course of household expenses; rather, it was done for Petitioner\u2019s personal advantage (to feign indigence and to deny Respondent access to funds). Respondent pleads that this act by Petitioner constitutes actual fraud on the community (fraud dolus ), or alternatively constructive fraud on the community (waste of community assets and \nbreach of fiduciary duty, as described below).  Petitioner further disposed of Respondent \u2019s \npersonal belongings, including clothing, tools, and other household items to be determined upon re-entry. \n25. Reconstitute"}

Petitioner further disposed of Respondent \u2019s \npersonal belongings, including clothing, tools, and other household items to be determined upon re-entry. \n25. Reconstituted Estate and Remedy:  Respondent requests that the Court make a finding of \nthe value by which the community estate was depleted due to Petitioner\u2019s fraudulent conduct, \nand that the Court reconstitute the community estate under Tex. Fam. Code \u00a7  7.009. Specifically, \nRespondent asks the Court to calculate at least $1,576.00 as the value by which Petitioner\u2019s \nactions depleted the community estate. Respondent further requests that the Court award a \ndisproportionate division of the remaining community estate in Respondent\u2019s favor, so as to\n\n17 \n compensate for this loss and achieve a just and right division. Such relief may include, for \nexample, awarding Respondent a money judgment for the $1,576 (or awarding him an equivalent amount of property or value from the marital estate to offset that loss ), plus  any additional \namounts the evidence may show Petitioner dissipated or secreted away. To the extent the \nmisappropriated funds have not been fully accounted for by Petitioner, Respondent requests an accounting and turnover of those funds. Respondent also se eks any appropriate exemplary relief \nor fee reimbursement if the Court finds that Petitioner acted willfully and maliciously in defrauding the community. The Texas Supreme Court has recognized that a spouse\u2019s intentional fraud can justify significant relie f in a divorce context, and Tex. Fam.

Petitioner breached  this fiduciary duty by willfully misusing community funds for her sole \nbenefit and by failing to be candid with Respondent (and the Court) about community finances. Specific acts of breach include: (a) withdrawing $1,576 of community funds without \nRespondent\u2019s knowledge or consent and diverting those funds to a third party\u2019s account; (b) \nattempting to hide or underreport community assets to the Court (for example, filing an \nindigency affidavit immediately after secreting away funds, thereby misrepresenting  the true \nfinancial picture); and (c) wrongfully expending community resources on personal litigation \nmaneuvers (such as obtaining legal services and ex parte orders under false pretenses) rather than \nfor legitimate community purposes. These actions were d one willfully and with intent to gain an\n\n18 \n unfair advantage in the divorce and custody dispute, to Respondent\u2019s detriment.

The $1,576 in community funds \nthat Petitioner transferred and concealed was community property in which Respondent had a \npossesso ry and ownership interest. By intentionally taking and exercising control over those \nfunds for her exclusive use (and denying Respondent access to or use of them), Petitioner committed the tort of conversion under Texas law. Petitioner\u2019s conduct meets all the elements of conversion: Respondent had a legal possessory interest in the funds; Petitioner wrongfully \nassumed and exercised dominion or control over the funds in a manner inconsistent with \nRespondent\u2019s rights; and Respondent has been deprived of the use and benefit of the funds. \nPetitioner\u2019s failure and refusal to return the $1,576 upon demand (evidenced by Respondent\u2019s \npre-suit demand and Petitioner\u2019s non -response in discovery) further confirms the wrongful nature \nof Petitioner\u2019s possession of those funds.

Under this statute, a person who knowingly makes a false report of child abuse commits an offense and may be held civilly liable, and the court may take certain remedial \nactions for the benefit of the falsely accused party.

By filing that \n amended petition \u2013 filled with accusations that directly contradict the established record \u2013 \n Petitioner persisted in a narrative that had been refuted by the evidence (including her \n own deemed admissions).

Pattern of Abuse of Process : Petitioner\u2019s pattern of conduct throughout this case \n reflects an abuse of the judicial process: she initiated claims and obtained orders based on \n false statements (e.g., the ex parte protective order and temporary custody orders), then \n abandoned those claims when challenged (e.g., nonsuiting the protective order \n proceeding) only to later raise new, inconsistent accusations, all while evading her \n discovery obligations. Texas appellate courts have upheld sanctions in analogous \n situations where a litigant files serial pleadings that ignore known facts or court orders \n and continue to accuse the opposing party without evidence.

Respondent specifically requests that the Court: (a) strike or dismiss  Petitioner\u2019s Second \nAmended Petition for Divorce (and deny Petitioner any further leave to replead in this matter) as a sanction for her bad-faith and groundless pleading; (b) award monetary sanctions  in the form of \nreimbursement to Respondent of his attorney\u2019s fees and expenses incurred because of Petitioner\u2019s frivolous filings and discovery abuse; and (c) issue any further orders deemed necessary to curb Petitioner\u2019s harassment of Respondent \u2013 such a s fines payable to the Court, or \nan injunction requiring Petitioner"}

Deemed Admissions:  The fact that Petitioner failed to timely respond to \n Respondent\u2019s  Requests for Admission (served on or about September 17, 2024), and that \n accordingly all matters in those Requests for Admission are deemed admitted  by\n\n23 operation of law (Tex. R. Civ. P. 198.2(c)). These deemed admissions include admissions \nthat Petitioner engaged in the specific misconduct alleged by Respondent (for example, the $1,576 transfer to Mr. Branthoover\u2019s account, the lack of any genuine protective order or family -violence finding, and other fraudulent actions as outlined above). Respondent \nasks that the Court acknowledge these admissions as conclusively established facts for purposes of this case. Furthermore, Respondent requests that the Court enforce Tex. R. Civ. P. 193.6, which would prohibit Petitioner from introducing any evidence or testimony on matters she failed to disclose in discovery (absent a showing of good cause or lack of unfair surprise). In practical terms, Petitioner should not be permitted to suddenly produce evidence to contradict the deemed admissions or to support her late-\n arising allegations, given her discovery defaults.  \nii.
