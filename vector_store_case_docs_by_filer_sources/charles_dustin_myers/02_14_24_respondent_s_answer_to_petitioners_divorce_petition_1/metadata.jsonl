Dates of Marriage and Separation  \n1. December 1st, 2023,  is not just inaccurate; it is a blatant  \nmisrepresentation of our living situation. Our cohabitation, verified by \nmultiple documents accepted by this Court,  continued unabated, \nreflecting a conscientious effort to preserve normalcy for our daughters \nduring an especially sensitive time. The date of separation came on \nJanuary 1 6th, 2024 \u2013 without a hearin g, which has been detrimental  and \nthe focal -point of th ese proceedings  by the Petitioner . \n7. Grounds for Divorce  \n2. Petitioner claims the marriage became insupportable due to discord or \nconflict of personalities. This is inaccurate. The divorce was announced \nwithout any prior attempt at counseling, communication, therapy, or any \nvisible signs of marital discord  around the holiday  season.  \n \n8. Children of the Marriage  \n3. The petition inaccurately asserts that  no court -ordered \nconservatorships, guardianships, or relationships affecting the children \nof this marriage  were in place at the time of filing, which is another \nblatant inac curacy  and oversight.  \n4. At the time of filing, orders were in place based on false claims from \nthe Petitioner, hindering my work and damaging the relationship with \nmy children. Opposing counsel was appointed on or around January \n22nd, 2024,  on last minute notice , which lead to a case continuance  \u2013 \nwhich extended the Tempor ary Orders currently in place at that time to \nthe reset date of February 1st, 2024.  \n \n-2- \n\u00a0\u00a0  A CERTIFIED COPY  \n   ATTEST:   \n THOMAS A.

The  request for the exclusive right to designate the primary residence \nof the children is detrimental, as the Petitioner  is employed part -time \nand has no desire to acquire full time employment and  has \ndemonstrated a pattern of deception that has destabilized the children's \nlives and  damaged my ability to provide for them , which directly \nimpacts them.  \n7. This oversight shows the consequences  of not conducting proper  \ndiscovery  by opposing Counsel , and that this case is deeply rooted in \nmisinformation , while the facts have been ignored outright.  \n11. Request for Temporary Orders and Injunction  \n8. The requests outlined in this section are baseless and appear designed \nto harass and complicate co -parenting. Cohabitation was maintained for \n45 days post -divorce announcement, disrupted only by court \nintervention on false pretenses.  Once again, the opposing Party must \nmaintain the need for protection  despite cohabiting without court \nintervention for 4 6 days , during which I was served three times . \nRespondent would ironically argue that the protection would have made \nmore sen se if been filed by himself rather than the Petitioner . \n13. Request for Temporary Orders Concerning Use of Property  \n9. The requests are baseless and appear designed to harass and \ncomplicate co -parenting. Cohabitation was maintained for 45 days post -\ndivorce announcement, disrupted only by court intervention on false \npretenses.  Once again, the opposing Party must maintain the need for \nprotection  despite cohabiting without court intervention for 4 6 days , \nduring which I was served three times .

The cohabitation achieved \naforementioned  directly contradicts the need for such orders .  \n15. Request for Temporary Orders Concerning Use of Property  \n11. Petitioner's Coun sel request ed temporary orders despite orders \nalready existing at the time of this filing. These requests were made \nwithout any hearing and are, therefore, just as all other allegations \nmade in this document, based off of  unfounded claims of F amily \nViolence.  \n16. Attorney's Fees, Expenses, Costs, and Interest  \n12. Respondent challenges the necessity and purpose of the Petitioner  \nsecuring legal services from Cooper L. Carter , as she expressed h er lack \nof desire  to represent the Petitioner for the divorce case , only seeming \ninterest ed in the Protective Order case, and wou ld questio n her desire to \nrepresent the Petitioner had it not been required by the Honorable \nJudge of this Court , as corroborated by the oversights pointed out within \nthis document.  \n17. Prayer  \n13. Petitioner's prayer, based on temporary injunctions and orders, is \nplagued by inconsistencies and contradictions, with no regard for the \nchildren's well -being.
