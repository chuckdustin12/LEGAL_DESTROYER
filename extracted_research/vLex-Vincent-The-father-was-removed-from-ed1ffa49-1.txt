Question
The father was removed from his home without following the legal eviction process. Texas law requires landlords to follow specific procedures, including providing
notice and obtaining a court order, before evicting a tenant. If the father was removed without following these procedures, it constitutes an unlawful eviction under
Texas law.
Answer (Texas)
Short response
If the father was removed from his home in Texas without the landlord providing proper notice and obtaining a court order as required by law, this constitutes an
unlawful eviction. Texas statutes and case law strictly mandate adherence to specific eviction procedures, and failure to comply renders the eviction illegal.
Summary
Texas law provides a detailed statutory framework for evicting tenants, requiring landlords to give written notice and to obtain a court order (writ of possession)
before removing a tenant from a property. Both the Texas Property Code and Texas appellate courts emphasize that these procedures must be strictly followed,
and any eviction carried out without compliance—such as removing a tenant without notice or judicial process—is considered unlawful.
If a landlord bypasses these requirements, the tenant has legal remedies, including the right to reenter the premises and the ability to pursue claims for wrongful
eviction. The law applies broadly to all residential tenancies in Texas, and courts have consistently held that strict compliance with statutory eviction procedures is
mandatory. Thus, the removal of the father without following these steps would be an unlawful eviction under Texas law.
Background and Relevant Law
Legislative and Regulatory Framework
The Texas Property Code sets out the exclusive procedures for evicting tenants. The key statutory provisions are as follows:
Notice to Vacate: Under Texas law, a landlord must provide a tenant with at least three days’ written notice to vacate before filing an eviction (forcible
detainer) suit, unless the lease specifies a different period (Tex. Prop. Code § 24.005 (2025)). This requirement applies to tenants under written or oral
agreements, tenants at will, and tenants by sufferance.
Forcible Detainer Action: If a tenant refuses to surrender possession after proper notice, the landlord must file a forcible detainer action in court. The
demand for possession must be in writing and comply with the notice requirements (Tex. Prop. Code § 24.002 (2025)).
Judicial Process and Writ of Possession: A landlord may not physically remove a tenant or prevent access to the premises except through judicial process.
Only after prevailing in court may the landlord obtain a writ of possession, which authorizes law enforcement to remove the tenant (Tex. Prop. Code § 24.0061
(2025); Tex. Prop. Code § 92.0081 (2025)).
Right of Reentry: If a landlord unlawfully locks out a tenant, the tenant may seek a writ of reentry from the justice court, allowing immediate and temporary
possession pending a final hearing (Tex. Prop. Code § 92.009 (2025)).
Special Provisions for Manufactured Home Lots: For manufactured home lots, eviction or exclusion of a tenant is only permitted after obtaining a writ of
possession under Chapter 24 (Tex. Prop. Code § 94.203 (2025)).
Administrative Regulations: For certain types of developments (e.g., HTC, TCAP, Exchange, NHTF), leases must specify that evictions require good cause
and written notice, and lockouts or seizure of property are prohibited except by judicial process (10 Tex. Admin. Code § 10.613 (2025)).
Supplementary Notice Requirements: For month-to-month tenancies, the landlord must provide notice of termination before ending the tenancy (Tex. Prop.
Code § 91.001 (2025)).
Case Law
Texas appellate courts have consistently interpreted these statutes to require strict compliance:
Strict Compliance Required: Courts have repeatedly held that because forcible detainer (eviction) is a statutory cause of action, landlords must strictly
comply with all statutory requirements, including written notice and judicial process (Brown v. Elysium Grand Apartments (Tex. App. Dec. 8, 2023); Samarripa
v. Related Mgmt. (Tex. App. Aug. 17, 2023); Mercadel v. Empire Vill. Apartments (Tex. App. Jan. 10, 2023); Perry v. Wichita Falls Hous. Auth. (Tex. App.
2022); Kennedy v. Andover Place Apartments (Tex. App. 2006)).
Elements of Forcible Detainer: To prevail in an eviction action, the landlord must prove a superior right to possession, that the tenant is holding over after
termination, that proper notice to vacate was given, and that the tenant refused to leave (Samarripa v. Related Mgmt. (Tex. App. Aug. 17, 2023); Goodwin v.
Goodwin (Tex. App. Feb. 16, 2023)).
Judicial Process is Mandatory: Landlords may not exclude tenants or prevent access to the premises except by judicial process (Coleman v. DWR
Somerset 18 LP (Tex. App. Nov. 5, 2024)).

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Remedies for Unlawful Eviction: If a landlord evicts a tenant without following the legal process, the tenant may seek reentry and may also pursue a
wrongful eviction claim, even if a judgment for possession has been entered (Garcia v. Galvan (Tex. App. May 8, 2012); Johnson v. Highland Hills Drive
Apartments (Tex. Ct. App. 1977), but see discussion of subsequent negative treatment below).
Notice Requirements: Courts have clarified that both notice to terminate the tenancy and notice to vacate are required before filing an eviction suit (Moore v.
Subia (Tex. App. May 16, 2018)).
Jurisdiction and Process: Justice courts have exclusive jurisdiction over eviction cases, and there must be strict compliance with service of process and
other procedural requirements (Landlord-Tenant Relations (2022); Civil Litigation (2022)).
Secondary Support: Secondary materials reinforce that eviction is a legal process requiring notice and a court order, and that landlords cannot forcibly
remove tenants without following these steps (Landlord/Tenant Rights (2006)).
Analysis
Statutory Requirements for Lawful Eviction
Texas law is unequivocal: a landlord must provide written notice to vacate and obtain a court order before evicting a tenant. The process is as follows:
Notice to Vacate: The landlord must give the tenant at least three days’ written notice to vacate, unless the lease specifies otherwise (Tex. Prop. Code §
24.005 (2025)). This notice must be delivered in person or by mail at the premises (Goodwin v. Goodwin (Tex. App. Feb. 16, 2023)).
Filing Suit: If the tenant does not vacate, the landlord must file a forcible detainer action in the appropriate justice court (Tex. Prop. Code § 24.002 (2025);
Landlord-Tenant Relations (2022)).
Judgment and Writ of Possession: Only after prevailing in court may the landlord obtain a writ of possession, which authorizes law enforcement to remove
the tenant. The writ cannot be issued until at least six days after judgment, and the tenant must be given at least 24 hours’ warning before execution (Tex.
Prop. Code § 24.0061 (2025)).
No Self-Help Eviction: Landlords are expressly prohibited from locking out or otherwise excluding tenants except by judicial process, with limited exceptions
for emergencies or abandonment (Tex. Prop. Code § 92.0081 (2025); Coleman v. DWR Somerset 18 LP (Tex. App. Nov. 5, 2024)).
Remedies for Tenants: If a landlord unlawfully locks out a tenant, the tenant may seek a writ of reentry and may also pursue damages for wrongful eviction
(Tex. Prop. Code § 92.009 (2025); Garcia v. Galvan (Tex. App. May 8, 2012)).
Judicial Interpretation and Strict Compliance
Texas courts have consistently held that eviction is a statutory cause of action, and landlords must strictly comply with all statutory requirements. Failure to
provide proper notice or to obtain a court order before removing a tenant renders the eviction unlawful (Brown v. Elysium Grand Apartments (Tex. App. Dec. 8,
2023); Samarripa v. Related Mgmt. (Tex. App. Aug. 17, 2023); Perry v. Wichita Falls Hous. Auth. (Tex. App. 2022); Fashakin v. Fed. Home Loan Mortg. Corp.
(Tex. App. Apr. 2, 2013); Kennedy v. Andover Place Apartments (Tex. App. 2006)).
The courts have also clarified that the right to immediate possession, as determined in a forcible detainer action, does not preclude a tenant from later challenging
the eviction as wrongful if the statutory procedures were not followed (Garcia v. Galvan (Tex. App. May 8, 2012); Johnson v. Highland Hills Drive Apartments
(Tex. Ct. App. 1977), but see below).
Application to the Scenario
If the father was removed from his home without the landlord providing the required written notice to vacate and without the landlord obtaining a court order (writ
of possession), the landlord has violated the Texas Property Code. Such an action is not only procedurally defective but is also substantively unlawful. The tenant
(the father) would be entitled to seek reentry and may have a claim for damages resulting from the unlawful eviction.
This conclusion is supported by both statutory law and a long line of appellate decisions. The courts have repeatedly emphasized that landlords must strictly
comply with the statutory eviction process, and any deviation—such as self-help eviction or exclusion without judicial process—is unlawful.
Exceptions and Caveats
There are limited exceptions where a landlord may exclude a tenant without judicial process, such as for bona fide repairs, emergencies, or if the tenant has
abandoned the premises (Tex. Prop. Code § 92.0081 (2025)). However, these exceptions are narrowly construed, and in the absence of such circumstances, the
statutory procedures must be followed.
For manufactured home lots, the law is even more explicit: eviction or exclusion is only permitted after obtaining a writ of possession (Tex. Prop. Code § 94.203
(2025)).
It is also important to note that while a judgment for possession in a forcible detainer action determines the right to immediate possession, it does not bar a
subsequent wrongful eviction claim if the landlord failed to comply with statutory requirements (Garcia v. Galvan (Tex. App. May 8, 2012); Johnson v. Highland
Hills Drive Apartments (Tex. Ct. App. 1977)). However, the authority of Johnson v. Highland Hills Drive Apartments has been stated as overruled by AAA Free
Move Ministorage, LLC v. Ois Invs., Inc. (Tex. App. 2013). While this limits the precedential value of Johnson, the principle that a wrongful eviction claim may still
be available is supported by more recent authorities such as Garcia v. Galvan.

Conclusion
Texas law is clear and consistent: landlords must strictly follow statutory procedures when evicting tenants, including providing written notice and obtaining a
court order. Any removal of a tenant without these steps is unlawful. The courts have repeatedly enforced these requirements, and tenants who are unlawfully
evicted have remedies under both statute and case law. In the scenario described, the father’s removal without adherence to these procedures constitutes an
unlawful eviction under Texas law.
Legal Authorities
Corpus Christi Housing Authority v. Lara, 267 S.W.3d 222 (Tex. App. 2008)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The housing authority contends that Texas has only one judicial eviction procedure, and, therefore, its generic notice was sufficient. We disagree.
Summary
The court disagreed with the housing authority's contention that a generic notice was sufficient for eviction under Texas law. This suggests that Texas law
requires specific procedures to be followed for eviction, which aligns with the proposition that landlords must provide proper notice and obtain a court order before
evicting a tenant.
Kennedy v. Andover Place Apartments, 203 S.W.3d 495 (Tex. App. 2006)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Under Texas Property Code section 24.002, a tenant commits a forcible detainer by refusing to surrender possession of real property after the landlord has
lawfully terminated the tenant's right to possession. See TEX. PROP. CODE ANN. § 24.002(a) (Vernon 2000). Section 24.002 also provides that a landlord must
make a written demand for possession and comply with section 24.005's requirements for a notice to vacate. Id. § 24.002(b). Because forcible detainer is a
statutory cause of action, a landlord must strictly comply with its requirements.
Summary
Requirements under Texas Property Code section 24.002 for a lawful eviction process, including the necessity for a landlord to make a written demand for
possession and comply with notice requirements. This supports the proposition that if these procedures were not followed, the eviction would be unlawful.
Johnson v. Highland Hills Drive Apartments, 552 S.W.2d 493 (Tex. Ct. App. 1977)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The proceedings under a forcible entry, or forcible detainer, shall not bar an action for trespass, damages, waste, rent or mesne profits. (emphasis added)... Our
holding, here, is consistent with the theory that a forcible detainer action is for the primary purpose of resolving who is entitled to immediate possession of the
premises... Thus, a judgment of possession is not intended to be a final determination of whether the eviction is wrongful or not; rather, it is a final determination
only with respect to the right of immediate possession...
Summary
A forcible detainer action is primarily concerned with determining the right to immediate possession of a property and does not preclude other legal actions related
to wrongful eviction. This implies that even if a judgment of possession is granted, it does not necessarily mean the eviction was lawful, and other legal remedies
may still be pursued if the eviction process was not properly followed.

Extract
Judgment of possession in a forcible detainer action is not intended to be a final determination of whether the eviction is wrongful; rather, it is a determination of
the right to immediate possession." ... "Therefore, the County Court judgment does not bar Garcia's wrongful eviction claim.

Summary
A judgment in a forcible detainer action, which determines the right to immediate possession, does not preclude a tenant from pursuing a wrongful eviction claim.
This implies that even if a landlord obtains a judgment for possession, the tenant can still challenge the eviction as wrongful if proper legal procedures were not
followed. This supports the proposition that if the father was removed without following the legal eviction process, it constitutes an unlawful eviction under Texas
law.
Brown v. Elysium Grand Apartments
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Because forcible detainer is a statutory cause of action, a landlord must strictly comply with [the statutory] requirements." Id. (quoting Kennedy v. Andover Place
Apartments, 203 S.W.3d 495, 497 (Tex. App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2006, no pet.)). "The forcible detainer statute requires the landlord provide 'at least three days'
written notice to vacate the premises before the landlord files a forcible detainer suit, unless the parties have contracted for a shorter or longer notice period in a
written lease or agreement.' § 24.005(a).
Summary
Texas law requires landlords to strictly comply with statutory requirements for eviction, including providing a written notice to vacate before filing a forcible
detainer suit. This supports the proposition that if the father was removed without following these procedures, it would constitute an unlawful eviction under Texas
law.
Goodwin v. Goodwin, 01-21-00286-CV (Tex. App. Feb 16, 2023)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The Texas Property Code describes 'forcible detainer' as the refusal to surrender real property on demand. TEX. PROP. CODE § 24.002(a). A demand for
possession of property 'must be made in writing' and 'must comply with the requirements for a notice to vacate under Section 24.005.' TEX. PROP. CODE §
24.002(b). The notice-to-vacate requirements under Section 24.005 require a landlord to give a tenant 'at least three days' written notice to vacate' before the
landlord files a forcible-detainer suit. TEX. PROP. CODE § 24.005(a), (b). The landlord must give the notice 'in person or by mail at the premises in question.'
TEX. PROP. CODE § 24.005(f).
Summary
Legal requirements for a forcible detainer, which is the legal process for eviction in Texas. It specifies that a landlord must provide a written demand for
possession and comply with notice-to-vacate requirements, including giving at least three days' written notice before filing a suit. This supports the proposition
that if these procedures were not followed, the eviction would be unlawful.

Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Before bringing a forcible detainer action against a tenant who holds over, a plaintiff must comply with two notice requirements—a notice to terminate the tenancy
at will and a notice to vacate. Id. at § 24.005(a) (West Supp. 2017); § 91.001 (West 2014). 'A landlord who files a forcible detainer suit on grounds that the tenant
is holding over beyond the end of the rental term or renewal period must... comply with the tenancy termination requirements of Section 91.001.' Id. at §
24.005(a). Section 91.001 provides a landlord or tenant may terminate a month-to-month tenancy by giving notice of termination to the other. Id. at § 91.001(a).
Summary
Legal requirements for evicting a tenant in Texas, specifically the need for a landlord to provide notice to terminate the tenancy and a notice to vacate before filing
a forcible detainer suit. This supports the proposition that if the father was removed without these procedures, it would be an unlawful eviction under Texas law.

Summary
The passage emphasizes that forcible detainer, which is the legal process for eviction in Texas, is a statutory cause of action. This means that landlords must
strictly adhere to the statutory requirements, including providing proper notice to the tenant. The passage cites specific sections of the Texas Property Code and
relevant case law, reinforcing the necessity of following these legal procedures. If the father was removed without these procedures being followed, it would
indeed constitute an unlawful eviction under Texas law.

Tex. Prop. Code § 92.009 Tex. Prop. Code § 92.009 Residential Tenant's Right of Reentry After Unlawful Lockout
Extract
If a landlord has locked a tenant out of leased premises in violation of Section PROPERTY CODE 92.0081, the tenant may recover possession of the premises
as provided by this section. ... If the tenant has complied with Subsection (b) and if the justice reasonably believes an unlawful lockout has likely occurred, the
justice may issue, ex parte, a writ of reentry that entitles the tenant to immediate and temporary possession of the premises, pending a final hearing on the
tenant's sworn complaint for reentry.
Summary
Texas law provides a specific remedy for tenants who have been unlawfully locked out of their premises. The tenant can file a sworn complaint for reentry, and if
the justice believes an unlawful lockout has occurred, they may issue a writ of reentry. This supports the proposition that removing a tenant without following the
legal eviction process, such as obtaining a court order, constitutes an unlawful eviction.
Tex. Prop. Code § 94.203 Tex. Prop. Code § 94.203 Eviction Procedures Generally
Extract
A landlord may prevent a tenant from entering the manufactured home lot, evict a tenant, or require the removal of a manufactured home from the manufactured
home lot only after obtaining a writ of possession under Chapter 24.
Summary
Texas law explicitly requires landlords to obtain a writ of possession before evicting a tenant from a manufactured home lot. This legal requirement ensures that
landlords follow due process, which includes obtaining a court order. If the father was removed without this writ, it would constitute an unlawful eviction under
Texas law.
Tex. Prop. Code § 24.002 Tex. Prop. Code § 24.002 Forcible Detainer
Extract
A person who refuses to surrender possession of real property on demand commits a forcible detainer if the person: is a tenant or a subtenant wilfully and without
force holding over after the termination of the tenant's right of possession; is a tenant at will or by sufferance, including an occupant at the time of foreclosure of a
lien superior to the tenant's lease; or is a tenant of a person who acquired possession by forcible entry. The demand for possession must be made in writing by a
person entitled to possession of the property and must comply with the requirements for notice to vacate under Section PROPERTY CODE 24.005.
Summary
Texas law requires a written demand for possession to be made by a person entitled to possession of the property. This demand must comply with the notice to
vacate requirements under Section 24.005. If these procedures are not followed, the eviction may be considered unlawful. The passage directly supports the
proposition that the father was removed without following the legal eviction process, as it outlines the necessary steps for a lawful eviction.

or by sufferance, the landlord must give the tenant at least three days' written notice to vacate before the landlord files a forcible detainer suit... In all situations in
which the entry by the occupant was a forcible entry under Section PROPERTY CODE 24.001, the person entitled to possession must give the occupant oral or
written notice to vacate before the landlord files a forcible entry and detainer suit.
Summary
Texas law mandates specific procedures for eviction, including providing a written notice to vacate before filing a forcible detainer suit. This requirement applies to
tenants under written or oral agreements, tenants at will, and situations involving forcible entry. The law ensures that tenants are given due process before being
evicted, and failure to follow these procedures constitutes an unlawful eviction.

Extract
A person commits a forcible entry and detainer if the person enters the real property of another without legal authority or by force and refuses to surrender
possession on demand.
Summary
The passage defines a forcible entry and detainer as entering real property without legal authority or by force and refusing to surrender possession. This directly
relates to the proposition that the father was removed without following the legal eviction process, as it implies that any removal without legal authority (such as a
court order) is unlawful. The passage supports the idea that proper legal procedures must be followed to evict someone from their home, aligning with the
requirements under Texas law.
Tex. Prop. Code § 91.001 Tex. Prop. Code § 91.001 Notice For Terminating Certain Tenancies
Extract
A monthly tenancy or a tenancy from month to month may be terminated by the tenant or the landlord giving notice of termination to the other.
Summary
For a monthly tenancy or a tenancy from month to month, termination requires the landlord to give notice to the tenant. This aligns with the legal requirement for
landlords to follow specific procedures, including providing notice, before evicting a tenant. If the father was removed without such notice, it would be a violation of
this provision, supporting the proposition of an unlawful eviction.
Tex. Prop. Code § 92.0081 Tex. Prop. Code § 92.0081 Removal of Property and Exclusion of Residential Tenant
Extract
A landlord may not intentionally prevent a tenant from entering the leased premises except by judicial process unless the exclusion results from: bona fide repairs,
construction, or an emergency; removing the contents of premises abandoned by a tenant; or changing the door locks on the door to the tenant's individual unit of
a tenant who is delinquent in paying at least part of the rent.
Summary
Texas law prohibits landlords from preventing tenants from entering their leased premises without judicial process, except under specific circumstances such as
bona fide repairs or emergencies. This supports the proposition that a landlord must follow legal eviction procedures, including obtaining a court order, before
evicting a tenant. If the father was removed without these procedures, it would be considered an unlawful eviction.
Landlord/Tenant Rights
Gale Encyclopedia of Everyday Law - GALE - Jeffrey Wilson - 2006-01-01
Extract
Eviction is a legal process by which a landlord may terminate a tenant's right to remain on the rental property. Ultimately, the tenant may be forcibly removed from
the property by the sheriff or other law enforcement official; however, doing so requires a formal court order. A landlord cannot forcibly evict a tenant without
proper notice. The landlord must provide written notice to the tenant of the default. If the tenant does not fix the default within a reasonable amount of time, the
landlord must file for a formal court eviction proceeding... TEXAS: Texas law requires a three-day notice for eviction for breach of the lease unless the notice
provides
