Question
1 322-744263-23 IN THE 322ND DISTRICT COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY,
TEXAS ITMOMO, Morgan Michelle Myers Petitioner, v. Charles Dustin
Myers, Respondent & in the interest of M.E.M. & C.R.M., Two minor
children. § § § § § Objection to Notice Setting A § Court Proceeding and
Docket § Control Order § § § MEMORANDUM OF LAW Petitioner, Morgan
Michelle Myers, initiated this action on December 18, 2023. She allegedly
retained the services of Cooper L. Carter on January 22, 2024. Today is
August 18, 2025, and there exists no plausible explanation as to the series of
unlawful, unethical, and unprecedented events that have transpired since
this matter’s inception. Now, before any official reinstatement by the
Regional Presiding Judge, a pending rule 12 motion against the opposing
counsel, a pending DWOP motion, a pending mandamus in the Texas
Supreme Court, a pending disqualification motion against opposing counsel,
a summary judgment, and a plea to the jurisdiction, all of which have gone
unanswered by our friends on the other side, this court – once again – seeks
to sua sponte set this matter for final trial, thereby attempting to cement the
unlawful deprivation suffered by the Respondent over the past two years.
For the forthcoming reasons, the Respondent OBJECTS to the notice setting
a court proceeding and docket control order, and in support thereof, shows
the following: 2 I. INTRODUCTION 1. The record demonstrates pervasive
violations of due process, statutory requirements, and local rules, rendering
the setting of a final trial improper and constitutionally infirm. Under Texas
law and binding precedent, the cumulative procedural and jurisdictional
defects in this matter mandate that the final trial setting be vacated until the
father’s rights to notice, hearing, and fair process are fully restored. 2. The
Respondent’s objection to the final trial setting is firmly grounded in both
statutory and constitutional law. The deprivation of his residence and
property rights without an evidentiary hearing, which occurred on January
16, 2024, lack of findings of fact, or opportunity to be heard, combined with
irregularities such as fraudulent orders falsely claiming consent,
unauthorized practice of law, recusal tampering, and dormant prosecution,
collectively amount to a systemic denial of due process and judicial integrity.
3. This court only seems to act upon receiving notice that the Respondent’s
appellate efforts were denied – which changes nothing regarding the
substantive issues herein that continue to be ignored. A denial of a
mandamus petition without any written opinion does not absolve this court
of the responsibility to address the issues. Until these issues are adjudicated
by this court – fairly and impartially – more mandamus petitions will follow,
and more recusal proceedings will be initiated until a lawful explanation is
provided for the continued stone-walling and one sided favoritism so clearly
displayed towards the opposing side. 4. Texas Family Code provisions, Texas
appellate and Supreme Court precedent, and constitutional guarantees all
require that a party be afforded notice, a meaningful opportunity to be
heard, and judicial findings before being deprived of fundamental rights.
The record here shows repeated violations of these requirements, including
ultra vires judicial acts, lack of 3 diligence by the movant, ineffective
assistance of counsel, and improper court staff conduct. Under these
circumstances, proceeding to a final trial would further entrench these

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
violations and irreparably harm the father’s rights, damage the children, and
reward the Petitioner for fraud. II. ANALYSIS OF ISSUES A. Deprivation of
Residence and Property Without Hearing or Findings 5. The father was
ordered to vacate his home based solely on unsubstantiated allegations of
family violence, without any evidentiary hearing, findings of fact, or
opportunity to be heard. This directly contravenes Texas Family Code §
85.001, which requires both a hearing and an affirmative finding of family
violence before a protective order may issue. Outside of this requirement,
this Court exceeded its’ statutory authority when ordering the Respondent
to vacate on January 16, 2024. The absence of the statutory prerequisites
renders the order void and a violation of due process (Tex. Fam. Code §
85.001; In re A.D.A., 287 S.W.3d 382, 384 (Tex. App. 2009)). 6. Moreover, the
failure to issue findings of fact and conclusions of law, despite a proper
request, is presumed harmful and constitutes reversible error unless the
record affirmatively demonstrates no injury (Anjum v. Shams-Ul-Qamar, No.
02-22-00234-CV, 2023 WL 6290132, at *3 (Tex. App. Sept. 27, 2023)). Here,
the harm is manifest: the father lost his home and property rights without
any judicial justification, and then later – was ordered to agree to a
settlement despite his clear lack of such consent. Damages have been
accruing since then, and Respondent has diligently pursued relief through
every available avenue. B. Right to De Novo Review and Failure to Provide
Relief 7. The associate judge’s order signed on March 14, 2024, was subject
to the father’s right to request a de novo hearing before the referring court
under Texas Family Code § 201.015. The 4 record indicates that the father
timely filed an emergency motion to vacate and request for de novo review,
which was ignored for a month and ultimately denied without explanation.
This failure to provide a de novo hearing or a written rationale further
violated the father’s statutory and constitutional rights ( Tex. Fam. Code §
201.015). C. Fraudulent Agreed Orders and Ineffective Assistance 8. This
court signed a unilateral ‘agreement’ containing only one side’s signature
when the signature page itself expressly states “AGREED AND CONSENTED
TO BY:”. The per curiam denials from the Second Court of Appeals regarding
these issues does not absolve this court of the responsibility to address
them, especially prior to moving this matter towards a final setting sua
sponte. 9. The associate judge compelled the father to sign an “agreed
order” that falsely recited universal consent, despite his express objection
and lack of signature. This constitutes a fraudulent order and deprives the
father of the right to contest property and parental issues on the merits.
Such conduct, especially when facilitated by the father’s own counsel acting
against his interests, raises serious concerns of ineffective assistance and
collusion, which are recognized grounds for relief in parental rights cases.
C. Dormant Prosecution and Bad Faith 10. The Mother, as movant, failed to
diligently prosecute her claims, obtaining repeated continuances without
substantive filings for over 18 months. Texas law and local rules support
dismissal for want of prosecution in such circumstances, as the case was
effectively dormant and the father’s deprivation was prolonged without
justification (In re Garcia, No. 02-20-00161-CV, 2020 WL 4812632, at *1
(Tex. App. Aug. 20, 2020)). In fact, the only recent action taken by the 5
opposing side was to suddenly prevent relief in the 233rd district court,
which ultimately resulted in two additional mandamus petitions. D. Judicial
and Staff Misconduct 11. The record details multiple instances of judicial
officers acting ultra vires—issuing orders while recusal or mandamus

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
proceedings were pending, consolidating cases sua sponte in violation of
local rules, and issuing orders without proper reinstatement. Court staff
tampered with recusal motions by removing exhibits and altering
submissions, which is not authorized under Rule 18a and undermines the
integrity of the judicial process. 12. Such conduct not only violates
procedural rules but also implicates due process and the right to a fair
tribunal. The Texas Supreme Court has held that due process violations
render judgments void and subject to collateral attack, regardless of
procedural deadlines (In re E.R., 385 S.W.3d 552, 555 (Tex. 2012)). 13.
Regarding staff misconduct – this court has yet to explain why on October 8,
2024, a modified version of a joint motion to recuse was forwarded to the
Regional Presiding Judge with missing exhibits and without the attached
affidavit. The reasons given by the Court Coordinator – Lindsey Baker –
contradict Tarrant County e-filing procedures, and directly contradicts the
Frequently Asked Questions section of the court’s website. 14. The Court
Coordinator’s continued involvement in recusal proceedings showcases a
deeper level of judicial bias and impartiality, as the Texas Rules of Civil
Procedure have no designation of responsibility for a court coordinator
regarding recusal – likely intended given the fact that coordinators are
appointed by the district judge’s whom they serve. By facilitating actions
that are otherwise reserved for court clerks, the Court Coordinator
continues to act 6 outside of her role, and furthers the one-sided favoritism
displayed by the Court, and raises a reasonable concern that the court is not
acting impartially. E. Unauthorized Practice and Void Filings 15. Opposing
counsel has filed two motions in this case. One came on April 24, 2024,
seeking to set this matter for a pre-trial conference, and a motion to
consolidate – which was granted sua sponte by the District Judge of the
233rd District Court in violation of local rules. 16. The record also shows
that opposing counsel lacks authority to act, with e-filing credentials tied to
a prior employer and later filings made by another firm without substitution
of counsel. Filings by unauthorized persons are void and further undermine
the legitimacy of the proceedings (In re Garcia, No. 02-20-00161-CV, 2020
WL 4812632, at *1 (Tex. App. Aug. 20, 2020)). F. Orders by Non-Reinstated
Judges 17. Orders issued by this Court without official reinstatement by the
regional presiding judge are void ab initio, as a judge lacks authority to act
while recusal is pending or before reinstatement. Such ultra vires acts are
subject to mandamus or other extraordinary relief (In re Garcia, No.
02-20-00161-CV, 2020 WL 4812632, at *1 (Tex. App. Aug. 20, 2020)). 18.
Furthermore, this Court continues to avoid the issues, and chose to set this
matter for final trial immediately after the Supreme Court denied four of five
pending mandamus petitions, showing a clear effort to avoid the issues
despite being fully aware of them. III. Cumulative Denial of Due Process 19.
The cumulative effect of these irregularities—fraudulent orders,
unauthorized practice, recusal tampering, dormant prosecution, ultra vires
judicial acts, and denial of notice and hearing—amounts to a systemic denial
of due process and judicial integrity. The Texas 7 Supreme Court has
recognized that such violations render judgments void and subject to
collateral attack, and that constitutional demands of due process override
statutory requirements (In re E.R., 385 S.W.3d 552, 555 (Tex. 2012)). 20.
The repeated denials by the appellate courts do not alter the facts of this
matter and supporting law. The continued disregard is not the answer, and
will only lead to more recusal proceedings and mandamus petitions until a

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
lawful explanation is handed down by a fair and impartial judge, regardless
of which level of the judiciary it comes from. IV. Conclusion 21. The setting
of a final trial under these circumstances would perpetuate and compound
the denial of the father’s constitutional and statutory rights. The record
demonstrates a pattern of procedural and jurisdictional defects, including
deprivation of residence and property without hearing or findings, lack of
diligence by the movant, ineffective assistance of counsel, fraudulent orders,
unauthorized practice, judicial and staff misconduct, and denial of notice
and opportunity to be heard, and continued disregard for the best interests
of the children. 22. Texas law, as reflected in the Family Code and binding
precedent, requires that these defects be remedied before any final trial
may proceed. The only appropriate course is to vacate the final trial setting,
restore the father’s rights to due process, and ensure that all future
proceedings comply strictly with statutory and constitutional requirements.
Failure to do so would result in irreparable harm and a breakdown of
judicial integrity, warranting extraordinary relief through additional recusal
proceedings and mandamus petitions. 23. For all these reasons, the
Respondent OBJECTS to notice of trial setting, and reserves the right to
seek additional relief through the appropriate legal channels, including but
not limited to further recusal proceedings, mandamus proceedings, and
claims brought in federal 8 court for the willful deprivation of
constitutionally protected rights and through actions taken ultra vires by
multiple judges who have yet to provide any substantive explanation for the
conduct alleged herein. 24. Therefore, the Court should VACATE this order,
and address the substantive issues as a priority and in accordance with
Texas Law. Respectfully Submitted, /s/ Charles Dustin Myers CHARLES

CHUCKDUSTIN12@GMAIL.COM PRO-SE RESPONDENT EXPLAIN AND
RESEARCH AND DRAFT WHY THE LITIGANT HAS AN ULTRA VIRES
CLAIM
Answer (Texas)
Short response
The litigant has a viable ultra vires claim because the court and its officers
allegedly acted beyond their statutory and constitutional authority—such as
issuing orders without required hearings, findings, or proper judicial
authority—rendering those actions void under Texas law. Ultra vires claims
are specifically recognized in Texas to challenge government officials,
including judges, who act without legal authority or fail to perform
ministerial duties.

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
Under Texas law, an ultra vires claim arises when a government official,
including a judge, acts outside the scope of their legal authority or fails to
perform a duty that the law prescribes with precision, leaving no room for
discretion. In this case, the respondent alleges that the court issued orders
depriving him of property and parental rights without the required
evidentiary hearing, findings of fact, or proper judicial authority, and that
certain actions were taken while recusal or reinstatement issues were
unresolved—each of which, if proven, constitutes action beyond the court’s
legal power.
The Texas Family Code and Government Code set clear procedural and
substantive requirements for protective orders, judicial recusal, and the
exercise of judicial authority. Texas appellate and Supreme Court precedent
confirm that actions taken in violation of these requirements are void and
subject to collateral attack through ultra vires claims. The respondent’s
allegations, if substantiated, fit squarely within the ultra vires doctrine, as
they challenge acts that are not discretionary but are instead contrary to
mandatory statutory and constitutional provisions.
Background and Relevant Law
Legislative Framework
Protective Orders and Due Process
The Texas Family Code requires that before a court may issue a protective
order—such as one excluding a party from their residence—the court must
hold a hearing and make an affirmative finding that family violence has
occurred and is likely to occur in the future, as set out in Tex. Fam. Code §
85.001 and § 85.021. The court’s authority to grant exclusive possession of a
residence and order a party to vacate is strictly limited to circumstances
where statutory prerequisites are met, including joint ownership or an
obligation to support the protected party or child.
Judicial Recusal and Authority
The Texas Government Code provides that when a motion for recusal or
disqualification is filed, the presiding judge must follow specific procedures,
and the judge who is the subject of the motion may not take further action in
the case until the motion is resolved (Tex. Gov't. Code § 25.00255). Similarly, 
Tex. Gov't. Code § 74.053 allows parties to object to the assignment of a
judge, and if a timely objection is filed, the assigned judge is prohibited from
hearing the case.
De Novo Review
Under Tex. Fam. Code § 201.015, a party has the right to request a de novo
hearing before the referring court after an associate judge’s order, provided

=== PAGE 6 ===

the request is timely. Failure to honor this right is a violation of statutory
procedure.
Case Law
Ultra Vires Doctrine
The Texas Supreme Court and Courts of Appeals have consistently held that
an ultra vires claim is available when a government official acts without
legal authority or fails to perform a purely ministerial act. The leading case, 
City of El Paso v. Heinrich, 284 S.W.3d 366 (Tex. 2009), establishes that such
claims are not barred by sovereign immunity and are designed to enforce
compliance with statutory or constitutional provisions, not to challenge
discretionary acts.
Subsequent cases clarify that ministerial acts are those where the law
prescribes the duty with such precision that no discretion is left to the
official (Enriquez v. Orihuela, 14-22-00868-CV, 14-23-00164-CV,
14-24-00357-CV (Tex. App. Dec 31, 2024); Hall v. McRaven, 508 S.W.3d 232
(Tex. 2017)). If an official exceeds the bounds of their granted authority or
acts in conflict with the law, those acts are ultra vires (Univ. of Tex. of
Permian Basin v. Banzhoff, No. 11-17-00325-CV (Tex. App. May 31, 2019)).
Void Orders and Judicial Authority
Orders issued by a judge who is disqualified, recused, or otherwise lacks
authority are absolutely void (Buckholts Independent School Dist. v. Glaser,
632 S.W.2d 146 (Tex. 1982); Fry v. Tucker, 146 Tex. 18). The Texas Court of
Criminal Appeals has held that a judge who has signed a voluntary recusal
order cannot take further action in the case, and any such action is ultra
vires and void (Ex parte Thuesen, 546 S.W.3d 145 (Tex. Crim. App. 2017)).
Due Process and Notice
Due process requires that parties receive notice and an opportunity to be
heard before being deprived of property or liberty interests. Failure to
provide such notice or to make required findings renders any resulting order
void and subject to collateral attack (In re Interest of K.M.L., 443 S.W.3d 101
(Tex. 2014); In re E.R., 385 S.W.3d 552 (Tex. 2012)).
Protective Orders Without Findings
Issuing a protective order without the required findings of family violence,
as mandated by Tex. Fam. Code § 85.001, is an ultra vires act and renders
the order void (In re A.D.A., 287 S.W.3d 382 (Tex. App. 2009)).

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Analysis
1. Deprivation of Residence and Property Without Hearing
or Findings
The respondent alleges that he was ordered to vacate his home based solely
on unsubstantiated allegations, without an evidentiary hearing or findings of
fact. Tex. Fam. Code § 85.001 and § 85.021 require both a hearing and an
affirmative finding of family violence before such an order may issue. The
Texas Court of Appeals has held that issuing a protective order without
these findings is beyond the court’s statutory authority and thus void (In re
A.D.A., 287 S.W.3d 382 (Tex. App. 2009)). This is a classic ultra vires
scenario: the judge is not exercising discretion within the law, but rather
acting in direct contravention of mandatory statutory requirements.
2. Orders Issued by Non-Reinstated or Disqualified Judges
The respondent claims that orders were issued while recusal or
reinstatement was pending, or by a judge who had not been properly
reinstated. Texas law is clear that a judge who has recused themselves, or is
otherwise disqualified, lacks authority to act in the case. Any orders issued
in such circumstances are absolutely void (Ex parte Thuesen, 546 S.W.3d
145 (Tex. Crim. App. 2017); Buckholts Independent School Dist. v. Glaser,
632 S.W.2d 146 (Tex. 1982); Fry v. Tucker, 146 Tex. 18). The Texas
Government Code reinforces this by prohibiting further action by a judge
after a recusal motion is filed and before it is resolved (Tex. Gov't. Code §
25.00255). Thus, any such actions are ultra vires.
3. Denial of De Novo Review
The right to a de novo hearing after an associate judge’s order is a statutory
right under Tex. Fam. Code § 201.015. If the respondent timely requested
such a hearing and the court failed to provide it, this is not a matter of
judicial discretion but a failure to perform a ministerial act required by law.
Such a failure is actionable as an ultra vires claim (Enriquez v. Orihuela,
14-22-00868-CV, 14-23-00164-CV, 14-24-00357-CV (Tex. App. Dec 31, 2024)).
4. Fraudulent or Unilateral Orders
The issuance of orders that falsely recite consent or are signed only by one
party, especially when the record shows express objection, may also be ultra
vires if the court’s action is contrary to procedural requirements or due
process. While courts have some discretion in managing their dockets, they
do not have discretion to disregard statutory or constitutional mandates
(City of El Paso v. Heinrich, 284 S.W.3d 366 (Tex. 2009)).
5. Judicial and Staff Misconduct
Allegations that court staff tampered with recusal motions or altered filings,
if proven, would also constitute ultra vires acts, as such conduct is not

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
authorized by law or court rules. The Texas Supreme Court has recognized
that due process violations, including those affecting the integrity of the
judicial process, render judgments void and subject to collateral attack (In
re E.R., 385 S.W.3d 552 (Tex. 2012)).
6. Unauthorized Practice and Void Filings
If opposing counsel acted without proper authority or e-filing credentials,
and the court accepted filings from unauthorized persons, those actions may
also be ultra vires. Texas law recognizes that filings by unauthorized persons
are void and undermine the legitimacy of proceedings (In re Garcia, No.
02-20-00161-CV, 2020 WL 4812632 (Tex. App. Aug. 20, 2020)).
7. Cumulative Denial of Due Process
The cumulative effect of these alleged irregularities—orders without
hearings or findings, actions by non-reinstated judges, denial of statutory
rights, and improper conduct by court staff—amounts to a systemic denial of
due process. Texas courts have held that such cumulative violations can
render judgments void and subject to collateral attack, and that
constitutional due process requirements override statutory deadlines or
procedural bars (In re E.R., 385 S.W.3d 552 (Tex. 2012)).
Exceptions and Caveats
It is important to note that an ultra vires claim cannot be based on mere
disagreement with a judge’s discretionary decisions; the claim must allege
actions that are clearly outside the scope of legal authority or involve the
failure to perform a ministerial act (Enriquez v. Orihuela, 14-22-00868-CV,
14-23-00164-CV, 14-24-00357-CV (Tex. App. Dec 31, 2024)). Additionally,
relief in ultra vires suits is generally limited to prospective declaratory or
injunctive relief, not retroactive remedies (Smith v. Dist. Attorney Office for
Wood Cnty., NO. 03-13-00220-CV (Tex. App. Oct 24, 2014)).
One of the cited authorities, Livingston v. Beeman, 408 S.W.3d 566 (Tex.
App. 2013), was superseded by Beeman v. Livingston, 468 S.W.3d 534 (Tex.
2015). While the general principles regarding ultra vires claims remain
valid, any reliance on the specific reasoning in Livingston should be
tempered by the subsequent Supreme Court decision, which may have
clarified or limited its application.
Conclusion
The respondent’s allegations, if substantiated, present a strong ultra vires
claim under Texas law. The court and its officers are alleged to have acted
beyond their statutory and constitutional authority by issuing orders without
required hearings or findings, acting while recusal or reinstatement was
unresolved, denying statutory rights to de novo review, and accepting filings
from unauthorized persons. Texas statutes and binding precedent make
clear that such actions are void and subject to challenge through ultra vires

claims, which are designed to enforce compliance with the law and protect
individual rights against government overreach. The respondent’s objections
are therefore well-grounded in both statutory and case law authority.
Legal Authorities
In re McKee, 248 S.W.3d 164 (Tex. 2007)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
This petition for writ of mandamus concerns the validity of an administrative
action taken by a presiding judge of an administrative judicial region after
he had voluntarily recused from the case... A judge can either voluntarily
recuse himself or, upon the filing of a verified motion for recusal, request the
assignment of another judge to hear the recusal motion. TEX.R. CIV. P.
18a(a),(c). However, absent extraordinary circumstances, a presiding judge's
order appointing a judge to hear a recusal motion is administrative — it
simply transfers the power to decide the recusal motion to another judge.
Summary
A judge who has recused themselves from a case should not take further
administrative actions unless there are extraordinary circumstances. This is
relevant to the ultra vires claim because it suggests that any actions taken
by a judge after recusal, without proper authority or extraordinary
circumstances, could be considered beyond their legal power (ultra vires).
In re Ligon, 408 S.W.3d 888 (Tex. App. 2013)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The Court of Criminal Appeals cited Guerra and article 2.08 as “instances in
which the district attorney is legally disqualified from acting.” Coleman, 246
S.W.3d at 81 & n. 12 (citing In re Guerra, 235 S.W.3d at 420–24). The Court
distinguished recusal from legal disqualification. See id. at 81. The recusal
procedure “allows the district attorney to avoid conflicts of interest and even
the appearance of impropriety by deciding not to participate in certain
cases.” Id. “The responsibility for making the decision to recuse himself is
on the district attorney himself; the trial court cannot require his recusal.”
Id. But if a prosecutor is legally disqualified from prosecuting a case—if he is
ineligible to act—the trial court is not powerless to protect the due process
rights of the defendant. See id.; Landers, 256 S.W.3d at 305, 310.

=== PAGE 10 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
The Texas Court of Appeals recognizes a distinction between recusal and
legal disqualification of a district attorney. While recusal is a voluntary
action by the district attorney to avoid conflicts of interest, legal
disqualification occurs when the district attorney is ineligible to act, and the
trial court can intervene to protect due process rights. This principle can be
applied to argue an ultra vires claim if a court or official acts beyond their
legal authority, particularly if such actions infringe upon due process rights.
Torres v. Unauthorized Practice of Law Comm. For Supreme Court of Tex.,
05-21-00651-CV (Tex. App. Sep 09, 2022)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The Unauthorized Practice of Law Committee for the Supreme Court of
Texas (UPLC) brought this suit in May 2020 alleging Torres, a non-lawyer,
was persistently attempting to represent two legal entities in litigation in the
44th Judicial District Court in Dallas County, Texas (the 'Underlying Suit').
The UPLC sought an injunction to prevent Torres from engaging in acts that
would constitute the unauthorized practice of law.
Summary
The passage discusses a case where the Unauthorized Practice of Law
Committee (UPLC) sought an injunction against an individual for engaging
in unauthorized legal representation. This is relevant to the ultra vires claim
because it highlights the legal boundaries and authority of individuals and
entities in practicing law. An ultra vires claim involves actions taken beyond
one's legal power or authority. In the context of the provided memorandum,
the Respondent alleges that certain judicial and legal actions were taken
without proper authority, which could be considered ultra vires if proven.
Monroe v. Blackmon, 946 S.W.2d 533 (Tex. App. 1997)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
If jurisdiction terminates upon a hearing on a motion to recuse and the
signing of an order as Judge Blackmon ruled, then Judge Blackmon's court
order before this court withdrawing his original order recusing Judge
Bennett and denying the motion to recuse is void for lack of jurisdiction.
This is so, because that order was entered after the first recusal hearing and
after Judge Blackmon entered the original order recusing Judge Bennett.
Further, the order denying leave to file was signed within the 30 days that

=== PAGE 11 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
the trial court has plenary powers, and without consideration that
constitutional disqualification of a judge may be raised at any time.
Summary
The passage discusses a situation where a judge's actions were deemed void
due to a lack of jurisdiction following a recusal order. This is relevant to the
ultra vires claim because it highlights that actions taken by a judge without
proper jurisdiction or authority are considered void. In the context of the
litigant's claim, if a judge acted beyond their jurisdiction or authority, such
actions could be challenged as ultra vires, meaning beyond the powers
legally granted to them.
In re Thompson., 330 S.W.3d 411 (Tex. App. 2010)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Even though I believe that Judge Baird is attempting to convene an
unauthorized and unorthodox proceeding, I do not believe that the
legislature has given us mandamus authority in these circumstances. The
government code specifically states that an appeals court 'may issue all
writs of mandamus ... against a: (1) judge of a district or county court in the
appeals district; or (2) judge of a district court who is acting as a magistrate
at a court of inquiry under Chapter 52, Code of Criminal Procedure, in the
court of appeals district.' Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 22.221(b) (West 2004).
Appellate courts have no authority 'to issue a writ of mandamus against an
official not prescribed by statute.'
Summary
The concept of ultra vires actions involves actions taken by a judge or
official that exceed their legal authority. In the context of the Texas legal
system, a judge acting without proper authority or outside the bounds of
their jurisdiction can be considered to be acting ultra vires. The passage
highlights that appellate courts have limited authority to issue writs of
mandamus, specifically against judges acting within their prescribed roles.
If a judge acts outside of these roles, such as convening unauthorized
proceedings, it may be considered ultra vires.

Armstrong argues, in his third issue, that the trial court erred in issuing a
protective order without an affirmative finding that family violence had
occurred and that family violence was likely to occur again. 'At the close of a
hearing on an application for a protective order, the court shall find
whether: (1) family violence has occurred; and (2) family violence is likely to
occur in the future.' TEX. FAM.CODE ANN. § 85.001(a) (Vernon 2008); In re
Epperson, 213 S.W.3d 541, 542 (Tex.App.-Texarkana 2007, no pet.).
Summary
The passage highlights that under Texas Family Code § 85.001(a), a court
must make an affirmative finding that family violence has occurred and is
likely to occur again before issuing a protective order. This requirement is
procedural and jurisdictional. If a court issues a protective order without
these findings, it acts beyond its statutory authority, making the order ultra
vires (beyond the powers). The litigant in the current case claims similar
procedural violations, arguing that the court acted without proper authority,
thus supporting an ultra vires claim.
In re E.R., 385 S.W.3d 552, 55 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 1130 (Tex. 2012)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
The Supreme Court has also suggested that reliance interests in a parental
rights case may be relevant even when the defendant's due process rights
were clearly breached... If, after learning that a judgment has terminated
her rights, a parent unreasonably stands mute, and granting relief from the
judgment would impair another party's substantial reliance interest, the trial
court has discretion to deny relief... Service by publication deprived L.R. of
due process. She is entitled to a new trial unless she unreasonably delayed
in seeking relief after learning of the judgment against her, and granting
relief would impair another party's substantial reliance on the judgment.
Summary
The Texas Supreme Court recognizes the importance of due process rights
in parental rights cases. The court emphasizes that a judgment can be
challenged if due process rights were violated, such as when a parent was
not given proper notice. This is relevant to ultra vires claims because if a
court acts beyond its authority, especially in violation of due process, such
actions can be challenged as ultra vires. The passage highlights that due
process violations can render judgments void, which aligns with the concept
of ultra vires actions being beyond the legal power or authority of the court.

In re Sw. Pub. Serv. , NUMBER 13-19-00111-CV (Tex. App. Apr 16, 2020)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The Court, having examined and fully considered the petition for writ of
mandamus, the response, and the reply, is of the opinion that relators have
shown themselves entitled to mandamus relief, in part, as stated here.
Accordingly, we lift the stay previously imposed in this case. We
conditionally grant the petition for writ of mandamus and we direct the trial
court to withdraw its February 19, 2019 order granting death penalty
sanctions and to conduct further proceedings in this case in accordance with
this opinion. We express no opinion as to any sanction that might be
imposed, if any, after further proceedings in this case. We deny all relief
sought with regard to the issues pertaining to recusal.
Summary
The Texas Court of Appeals conditionally granted mandamus relief, directing
the trial court to withdraw an order that was deemed ultra vires. This
indicates that the appellate court found the trial court's actions to exceed its
authority, which is a key component of an ultra vires claim. The passage
demonstrates that when a court acts beyond its jurisdiction or authority,
such actions can be challenged and potentially overturned through
mandamus relief.
In re Guerra, 235 S.W.3d 392 (Tex. App. 2007)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The absence of an impartial and disinterested prosecutor has been held to
violate a criminal defendant's due process right to a fundamentally fair trial.
Put another way, the due process rights of a criminal defendant are violated
when a prosecuting attorney who has a conflict of interest relevant to the
defendant's case prosecutes the defendant. It is clear; however, that the trial
court may not disqualify a district attorney or his staff on the basis of a
conflict of interest that does not rise to the level of a due-process violation.
Summary
The ultra vires claim can be related to actions taken by a court or its officers
that exceed their legal authority, particularly when such actions violate due
process rights. In the context of the provided passage, the ultra vires claim
could be based on the argument that the court or its officers acted beyond
their authority by allowing a prosecuting attorney with a conflict of interest

This makes sense, because any orders or judgments rendered by a judge
who is constitutionally disqualified are void and without effect. See, e.g.,
Buckholts Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Glaser, 632 S.W.2d 146, 148 (Tex.1982); Fry v.
Tucker, 146 Tex. 18, 202 S.W.2d 218, 221 (1947). Likewise, on timely
objection, the disqualification of an assigned judge who is not a retired judge
is mandatory under section 74.053(d) of the Texas Government Code and
any orders entered by a trial judge in a case in which he is disqualified are
void.
Summary
Concept of ultra vires acts in the context of judicial disqualification. It states
that any orders or judgments rendered by a judge who is constitutionally
disqualified are void and without effect. This is relevant to the ultra vires
claim because it supports the argument that actions taken by a judge
without proper authority (due to disqualification) are considered void. The
passage also highlights that the disqualification of an assigned judge who is
not a retired judge is mandatory under section 74.053(d) of the Texas
Government Code, and any orders entered by such a judge are void. This
reinforces the idea that actions taken without proper authority are ultra
vires and void.
Ex parte Thuesen, 546 S.W.3d 145 (Tex. Crim. App. 2017)
Texas Court of Criminal Appeals
Extract
In this opinion, we consider the preliminary issue of the judicial authority of
the judge who presided over habeas proceedings in this case. The judge at
issue signed an order voluntarily recusing himself from presiding over
applicant's habeas proceedings. He then sought and obtained the
appointment of a replacement judge, but subsequently signed an order
purporting to restore his own judicial authority to preside over the case. For
the reasons explained below, we hold that the judge did not have authority
to take any further action after signing the voluntary recusal order.

=== PAGE 15 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
A judge who has voluntarily recused themselves from a case does not have
the authority to take further action in that case. This principle is applicable
to the situation described in the memorandum of law, where it is alleged
that orders were issued by non-reinstated judges, which would be
considered ultra vires acts. The passage from Ex parte Thuesen supports the
argument that any actions taken by a judge after recusal, without proper
reinstatement, are beyond their authority and therefore void.

Extract
Thus, ultra vires suits do not attempt to exert control over the state—they
attempt to reassert the control of the state. Stated another way, these suits
do not seek to alter government policy but rather to enforce existing policy.
Summary
An ultra vires claim in Texas involves a suit against a state official who is
allegedly acting without legal or statutory authority. The purpose of such a
suit is not to change government policy but to enforce existing laws and
policies. This means that if a state official acts beyond their legal authority,
they are not protected by sovereign immunity, and a suit can be brought
against them to correct this overreach.

Rule 245 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure provides that a trial court
“may set contested cases on written request of any party, or on the court's
own motion, with reasonable notice of not less than forty-five days to the
parties of a first setting for trial, or by agreement of the parties.” Tex.R. Civ.
P. 245. If a timely answer has been filed in a contested case or the defendant
has otherwise made an appearance, due process rights are violated when a
judgment is subsequently entered without the party having received notice
of the setting of the case, Peralta v. Heights Med. Ctr., 485 U.S. 80, 86–87,
108 S.Ct. 896, 99 L.Ed.2d 75 (1988), even when that party previously waived
notice of citation.

Summary
Rule 245 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure requires reasonable notice of
not less than forty-five days for a first trial setting. If a party has made an
appearance in a contested case, due process rights are violated if a
judgment is entered without the party receiving notice of the trial setting.
This is relevant to the ultra vires claim because if a court acts without
providing the required notice, it may be acting beyond its legal authority,
which is the essence of an ultra vires act.

Oct 24, 2014)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
A suit seeking to compel a government official 'to comply with statutory or
constitutional provisions' is an ultra vires suit and is not protected by
sovereign immunity. City of El Paso v. Heinrich, 284 S.W.3d 366, 372 (Tex.
2009). However, relief is limited in an ultra vires suit to prospective
declaratory or injunctive relief restraining ultra vires conduct, as opposed to
retroactive relief. Id. at 374-77.
Summary
An ultra vires claim in Texas involves a suit against a government official to
ensure compliance with statutory or constitutional provisions. Such suits are
not barred by sovereign immunity, but the relief available is limited to
prospective actions, such as declaratory or injunctive relief, rather than
retroactive remedies. This is based on the precedent set by the Texas
Supreme Court in City of El Paso v. Heinrich.
City of Dall. v. Brown, 373 S.W.3d 204 (Tex. App. 2012)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
In Heinrich, the court recognized an 'ultra vires exception' to sovereign
immunity: [I]t is clear that suits to require state officials to comply with
statutory or constitutional provisions are not prohibited by sovereign
immunity even if a declaration to that effect compels the payment of money.
To fall within this ultra vires exception, a suit must not complain of a
government officer's exercise of discretion, but rather must allege, and
ultimately prove, that the officer acted without legal authority or failed to
perform a purely ministerial act.... Thus, ultra vires suits do not attempt to

reassert the control of the state. Stated another way, these suits do not seek
to alter government policy but rather to enforce existing policy.
Summary
Legal basis for the litigant's claim that certain actions by the court or its
officials were ultra vires, meaning they were beyond the legal authority
granted to them.
In re Lozano 696 S.W.3d 222
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
If a relator in a habeas corpus proceeding establishes 'the order requiring
[her] confinement is void, either because the court that issued the order
lacked jurisdiction to enter it or because it deprived relator of [her] liberty
without due process of law,' then the relator is entitled to be discharged. ...
In addition to the due process defects present in Mack, Gallegos, and Texas
Department of Family & Protective Services, we have also repeatedly held
that portions of Judge Mary Lou Alvarez’s orders in this underlying case and
other similar cases were void because they violated the Separation of
Powers Clause.
Summary
A court order can be considered void if the court lacked jurisdiction or if the
order violated due process. Additionally, orders that violate the Separation
of Powers Clause are also considered void. This is relevant to the litigant's
ultra vires claim because it suggests that if a judge acts beyond their
authority or in violation of constitutional principles, their orders can be
challenged as ultra vires, meaning beyond their legal power or authority.

Texas Supreme Court
Extract
As the Court's opinion thoroughly and accurately explains, when a trial court
renders judgment terminating parental rights based on an unrevoked
affidavit of relinquishment, Texas Family Code section 161.211(c) plainly
forecloses a collateral attack on the judgment premised on an alleged lack of
subject matter jurisdiction. I therefore join the Court's opinion, which
correctly holds that Father's collateral attack is barred by statute. I write
separately to note that it is barred for another reason as well: a court's lack
of 'jurisdiction' under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and

=== PAGE 18 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Enforcement Act (UCCJEA) does not equate to a lack of 'subject matter
jurisdiction' that deprives the court of the power to hear and decide the
case, thereby endangering a judgment's finality.
Summary
A court's lack of jurisdiction under the UCCJEA does not equate to a lack of
subject matter jurisdiction that would allow for a collateral attack on the
judgment. This indicates that ultra vires claims, which involve actions taken
without legal authority, may not be easily pursued in cases where the court
has made a jurisdictional determination, even if that determination is
alleged to be erroneous.

even in the absence of a waiver of immunity if the official's actions are ultra
vires." Hall v. McRaven, 508 S.W.3d 232, 238 (Tex. 2017). Under the "ultra

through prospective injunctive or declaratory relief. City of El Paso v.
Heinrich, 284 S.W.3d 366, 372, 374-77 (Tex. 2009). Consequently, ultra vires
suits do not attempt to exert control over the State, but rather to "reassert

Summary
In Texas, the ultra vires exception allows a claimant to bring a suit against a
state official if the official's actions are beyond their legal authority (ultra
vires). This exception is applicable even when there is no waiver of
immunity, provided the claimant seeks prospective injunctive or declaratory
relief to compel compliance with statutory or constitutional provisions. The
ultra vires claim is not about controlling the state but ensuring that state
agents act within their legal bounds.

Suits to require state officials to comply with statutory or constitutional
provisions are not prohibited by sovereign immunity. City of El Paso v.
Heinrich, 284 S.W.3d 366, 372 (Tex.2009). To fall within this “ultra vires”
exception, a suit must not complain of a government officer's exercise of

Ultra vires suits do not attempt to exert control over the State—they attempt
to reassert the control of the State. Id. Further, these types of suits cannot
be brought against the State, which retains immunity, but must be brought
against the State actors in their official capacity. Id. at 373.
Summary
An ultra vires claim in Texas involves alleging that a state official acted
without legal authority or failed to perform a ministerial act. This type of
claim is not barred by sovereign immunity because it seeks to ensure
compliance with statutory or constitutional provisions, rather than
challenging the discretion of the official. The claim must be directed at the
state actor in their official capacity, not the state itself, which retains
immunity.

To assert a valid ultra vires claim, the plaintiff 'must not complain of a

ultimately prove, that the officer acted without legal authority or failed to
perform a purely ministerial act.' City of El Paso v. Heinrich, 284 S.W.3d 366,

Extract
To come within the ultra vires exception, the plaintiff 'must not complain of a
government officer's exercise of discretion, but rather must allege, and
ultimately prove, that the officer acted without legal authority or failed to
perform a purely ministerial act.' ... The distinction between a valid ultra
vires claim and one seeking to control state action turns on (1) the particular
acts or omissions that the official is committing, as determined under the
standard of review we have previously described; and (2) construction of the
relevant statutory or constitutional provisions to determine whether those
acts are within, or beyond, the official's discretionary authority.
Summary
An ultra vires claim in Texas requires the plaintiff to demonstrate that a
government official acted without legal authority or failed to perform a
ministerial act. This is distinct from challenging an official's discretionary
actions. The claim must be based on specific acts or omissions and the
relevant statutory or constitutional provisions to determine if the actions
were beyond the official's authority.

Fry v. Tucker 146 Tex. 18
Texas Supreme Court

The rules announced in the Constitution and Statutes upon this subject are
expressed in unconditional language, and are regarded as mandatory and to
be rigidly enforced. It has long been the settled rule in this State that any
order or judgment entered by a trial judge in any case in which he is
disqualified is absolutely void.
Summary
The passage from Fry v. Tucker establishes that in Texas, any order or
judgment made by a disqualified judge is considered absolutely void. This is
a mandatory rule that is strictly enforced, as per the Texas Constitution and
Statutes. This principle is crucial in understanding ultra vires claims, as it
underscores that actions taken by a judge without proper authority (i.e.,
when disqualified) are not legally valid.
Buckholts Independent School Dist. v. Glaser, 632 S.W.2d 146 (Tex. 1982)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
The constitutional prohibition has long been held to make any order
involving judicial discretion by a constitutionally disqualified judge
'absolutely void,' 'a nullity.' Fry v. Tucker, 146 Tex. 18, 202 S.W.2d 218, 221
(1947); Templeton v. Giddings, 12 S.W. 851 (Tex.1889); Stephenson v.
Kirkham, 297 S.W. 265, 267 (Tex.Civ.App.-San Antonio 1927, writ ref'd).

Tex. Fam. Code § 85.001 Tex. Fam. Code § 85.001 Required Findings and
Orders
Extract
(a) At the close of a hearing on an application for a protective order, the
court shall find whether family violence has occurred. (b) If the court finds
that family violence has occurred, the court: shall render a protective order
as provided by Section FAMILY CODE 85.022 applying only to a person
found to have committed family violence; and may render a protective order
as provided by Section FAMILY CODE 85.021 applying to both parties that is
in the best interest of the person protected by the order or member of the
family or household of the person protected by the order.
Summary
The Texas Family Code § 85.001 outlines the requirements for a court to
issue a protective order in cases of family violence. It mandates that a court
must find whether family violence has occurred at the close of a hearing on
an application for a protective order. If family violence is found, the court is
required to render a protective order against the person found to have
committed the violence. This provision ensures that protective orders are
issued based on substantiated findings of family violence, thereby
safeguarding due process rights.
Tex. Fam. Code § 201.015 Tex. Fam. Code § 201.015 De Novo Hearing

with the clerk of the referring court a written request not later than the
third working day after the date the party receives notice of: the substance
of the associate judge's report as provided by Section FAMILY CODE
201.011; or the rendering of the temporary order, if the request concerns a
temporary order rendered by an associate judge under Section FAMILY
CODE 201.007(a)(C).
Summary
A party has the right to request a de novo hearing before the referring court
if they file a written request within three working days after receiving notice
of the associate judge's report or temporary order. This right is crucial for
ensuring that a party can challenge decisions made by an associate judge

and have the matter reviewed by the referring court. If this right is not
honored, it could be considered an ultra vires act, meaning the court or
judge acted beyond their legal authority.
Tex. Gov't. Code § 29.055 Tex. Gov't. Code § 29.055 Procedure Following
Filing of Motion; Recusal Or Disqualification Without Motion
Extract
A municipal judge who does not recuse or disqualify himself or herself: shall
forward, in original form or certified copy, an order of referral, the motion,
and all opposing and concurring statements to the regional presiding judge;
and may not take other action in the case during the time after the filing of
the motion for recusal or disqualification and before a hearing on the
motion, except for good cause stated in the order in which the action is
taken.
Summary
A judge who does not recuse or disqualify themselves must forward the
motion and related documents to the regional presiding judge and refrain
from taking further action in the case until a hearing on the motion occurs.
This indicates that any action taken by a judge after a recusal motion is
filed, but before it is resolved, could be considered ultra vires, or beyond
their legal authority, unless there is a stated good cause.

Extract
Except as provided by Subsection (b), not later than the 15th day after the
date an order of recusal or disqualification of a statutory probate court
judge is issued in a case, the presiding judge shall assign a statutory probate
court judge or a former or retired judge of a statutory probate court to hear
the case if: the judge of the statutory probate court recused himself or
herself under Section GOVERNMENT CODE 25.00255(g)(A); the judge of
the statutory probate court disqualified himself or herself under Section
GOVERNMENT CODE 25.00255 (g-1); the order was issued under Section
GOVERNMENT CODE 25.00255 (i-3); or the presiding judge receives notice
and a request for assignment from the clerk of the statutory probate court
under Section GOVERNMENT CODE 25.00255(l).

The unauthorized practice of law committee shall: keep the supreme court
and the state bar informed with respect to: (A) the unauthorized practice of
law by lay persons and lay agencies and the participation of attorneys in that
unauthorized practice of law; and (B) methods for the prevention of the
unauthorized practice of law; and seek the elimination of the unauthorized
practice of law by appropriate actions and methods, including the filing of

Summary
The Unauthorized Practice of Law Committee in Texas is responsible for
monitoring and preventing unauthorized practice of law. This includes
keeping the Supreme Court and the State Bar informed about unauthorized
practices and taking appropriate actions, such as filing suits, to eliminate
such practices. This is relevant to the litigant's ultra vires claim because if
opposing counsel is engaging in unauthorized practice, it could be
considered an ultra vires act, meaning beyond their legal authority, and thus
void.

Extract
A party in a hearing or trial in a municipal court, including a municipal court

the recusal or disqualification of the municipal judge. The grounds may
include any disability of the judge to preside over the case.

Legal basis for challenging a judge's authority in specific circumstances,
which is central to an ultra vires claim.
Tex. Civ. Prac. and Rem. Code § 30.016 Tex. Civ. Prac. and Rem. Code §
30.016 Recusal Or Disqualification of Certain Judges

=== PAGE 26 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
A judge who declines recusal after a tertiary recusal motion is filed shall
comply with applicable rules of procedure for recusal and disqualification
except that the judge shall continue to: preside over the case; sign orders in
the case; and move the case to final disposition as though a tertiary recusal
motion had not been filed.
Summary
A judge in Texas is allowed to continue presiding over a case, signing orders,
and moving the case to final disposition even after a tertiary recusal motion
is filed. This means that the judge's actions are not considered ultra vires
(beyond their legal power or authority) simply because a tertiary recusal
motion is pending. However, if the recusal motion is finally sustained, any
orders signed by the judge during the pendency of the motion must be
vacated. This provision clarifies the authority of judges in the context of
recusal motions and helps determine when actions might be considered
ultra vires.
Tex. Gov't. Code § 25.00255 Tex. Gov't. Code § 25.00255 Recusal Or
Disqualification of Judge
Extract
The presiding judge: has the authority and shall perform the functions and
duties of the presiding judge of the administrative judicial region under the
rules, including the duty to hear or rule on a referred motion of recusal or
disqualification or, subject to Subdivisions and , assign a judge to hear and
rule on a referred motion of recusal or disqualification; may assign a
presiding judge of the administrative judicial region to hear and rule on a
referred motion of recusal or disqualification only with the consent of the
presiding judge of the administrative judicial region; may not assign a judge
of a statutory probate court located in the same county as the statutory
probate court served by the judge who is the subject of the motion of recusal
or disqualification; and if the presiding judge is the subject of the motion of
recusal or disqualification, shall sign and file with the clerk an order
referring the motion to the chief justice of the supreme court for assignment
of a presiding judge of an administrative judicial region, a statutory probate
court judge, or a former or retired judge of a statutory probate court to hear
and rule on the motion, subject to Subdivisions and.
Summary
Actions taken outside these prescribed duties and limitations could be
considered ultra vires, meaning beyond the legal power or authority of the
person performing them. This is relevant to the litigant's claim of ultra vires
actions by the court, as it suggests that any judicial actions taken without

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
proper authority or in violation of these procedures could be challenged as
ultra vires.
Tex. Gov't. Code § 22.221 Tex. Gov't. Code § 22.221 Writ Power
Extract
Each court of appeals or a justice of a court of appeals may issue a writ of
mandamus and all other writs necessary to enforce the jurisdiction of the
court.
Summary
The courts of appeals in Texas have the authority to issue writs of
mandamus and other writs necessary to enforce their jurisdiction. This
power is crucial in cases where a lower court or judge may have acted
beyond their authority (ultra vires), as it allows the appellate court to
correct such actions and ensure that the lower courts are acting within their
legal boundaries.
Tex. Fam. Code § 85.022 Tex. Fam. Code § 85.022 Requirements of Order
Applying to Person Who Committed Family Violence
Extract
In a protective order, the court may order the person found to have
committed family violence to perform acts specified by the court that the
court determines are necessary or appropriate to prevent or reduce the
likelihood of family violence... In a protective order, the court may prohibit
the person found to have committed family violence from: committing family
violence; communicating... going to or near the residence or place of
employment or business of a person protected by an order... In a protective
order, the court shall suspend a license to carry a handgun issued under
Subchapter H, Chapter 411, Government Code, that is held by a person
found to have committed family violence.
Summary
The Texas Family Code § 85.022 outlines the requirements and limitations of
protective orders in cases of family violence. The court is empowered to
issue orders to prevent further violence, including prohibiting certain
actions and suspending licenses. However, these orders must be based on a
finding of family violence, and the court must adhere to statutory
requirements. If a court issues orders without meeting these prerequisites,
it may be acting beyond its legal authority, or ultra vires.

Tex. Gov't. Code § 74.053 Tex. Gov't. Code § 74.053 Objection to Judge
Assigned to a Trial Court
Extract
When a judge is assigned to a trial court under this chapter: the order of
assignment must state whether the judge is an active, former, retired, or
senior judge; and the presiding judge shall, if it is reasonable and
practicable and if time permits, give notice of the assignment to each
attorney representing a party to the case that is to be heard in whole or part
by the assigned judge. If a party to a civil case files a timely objection to the
assignment, the judge shall not hear the case.
Summary
The Texas Government Code § 74.053 provides a mechanism for parties in a
civil case to object to the assignment of a judge. If a party files a timely
objection, the assigned judge is prohibited from hearing the case. This
provision ensures that parties have a say in who presides over their case,
which is a critical aspect of ensuring impartiality and fairness in judicial
proceedings. If a judge proceeds to hear a case despite a valid objection, it
could be considered an ultra vires act, meaning the judge acted beyond their
legal authority.
Tex. Gov't. Code § 22A.005 Tex. Gov't. Code § 22A.005 Actions By Judge Or
Justice
Extract
A judge or justice of a special three-judge district court may not
independently enter a temporary restraining order, temporary injunction, or
any order that finally disposes of a claim before the court.
Summary
A judge or justice within a special three-judge district court in Texas is
restricted from independently entering certain orders, such as temporary
restraining orders, temporary injunctions, or any order that finally disposes
of a claim. This means that if a judge or justice acts beyond these
limitations, such actions could be considered ultra vires, or beyond their
legal authority. In the context of the litigant's claim, if any orders were
issued by a judge or justice that fall into these prohibited categories without
the required unanimous consent, those actions could be challenged as ultra
vires.
Tex. Gov't. Code § 22.002 Tex. Gov't. Code § 22.002 Writ Power

=== PAGE 29 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
The supreme court or a justice of the supreme court may issue writs of
procedendo and certiorari and all writs of quo warranto and mandamus
agreeable to the principles of law regulating those writs, against a statutory
county court judge, a statutory probate court judge, a district judge, a court
of appeals or a justice of a court of appeals, or any officer of state
government except the governor, the court of criminal appeals, or a judge of
the court of criminal appeals.
Summary
The Supreme Court can compel judges to act within their legal authority,
which is central to addressing ultra vires actions.
Tex. Fam. Code § 105.001 Tex. Fam. Code § 105.001 Temporary Orders
Before Final Order
Extract
In a suit, the court may make a temporary order, including the modification
of a prior temporary order, for the safety and welfare of the child, including
an order: for the temporary conservatorship of the child; for the temporary
support of the child; restraining a party from disturbing the peace of the
child or another party; prohibiting a person from removing the child beyond
a geographical area identified by the court; or for payment of reasonable
attorney's fees and expenses.
Summary
The Texas Family Code § 105.001 provides the court with the authority to
issue temporary orders for the safety and welfare of the child. However,
these orders must be made in accordance with statutory requirements,
including notice and hearing provisions. If a court issues orders without
adhering to these requirements, such actions could be considered ultra
vires, meaning beyond the legal power or authority of the court. In the
context of the litigant's claim, if the court issued orders without proper
notice, hearing, or findings, it could be argued that the court acted beyond
its authority, thus supporting an ultra vires claim.
Tex. Fam. Code § 201.007 Tex. Fam. Code § 201.007 Powers of Associate
Judge
Extract
An associate judge may, in the interest of justice, refer a case back to the
referring court regardless of whether a timely objection to the associate

=== PAGE 30 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
judge hearing the trial on the merits or presiding at a jury trial has been
made by any party.
Summary
An associate judge can refer a case back to the referring court in the
interest of justice, which implies that there are boundaries to their authority.
If an associate judge acts beyond these powers, such as making decisions or
issuing orders without proper authority or outside the scope of their
designated powers, it could be considered ultra vires, meaning beyond their
legal power or authority. This is relevant to the litigant's claim of ultra vires
actions, as it suggests that any actions taken by the judge outside of these
prescribed powers could be challenged as unauthorized.
Tex. Fam. Code § 85.021 Tex. Fam. Code § 85.021 Requirements of Order
Applying to Any Party
Extract
In a protective order, the court may: ... grant exclusive possession of a
residence to a party and, if appropriate, direct one or more parties to vacate
the residence if the residence: (A) is jointly owned or leased by the party
receiving exclusive possession and a party being denied possession; (B) is
owned or leased by the party retaining possession; or (C) is owned or leased
by the party being denied possession and that party has an obligation to
support the party or a child of the party granted possession of the residence;
Summary
The court may direct a party to vacate a residence if certain conditions are
met, such as joint ownership or lease, or an obligation to support the party
or child granted possession. The litigant's ultra vires claim may arise if the
court acted beyond its statutory authority by ordering the respondent to
vacate the residence without meeting these conditions or without an
evidentiary hearing and findings of fact, as alleged in the memorandum.
Recusal's Own Conflict of Interest
Criminal Justice - American Bar Association - Louis J. Virelli III -
2025-01-01
Extract
Recusal can be a powerful tool to remedy due process violations based on
partiality, especially in cases where the adjudicator exhibits actual or
probable bias against a party or has a personal conflict of interest. The
Supreme Court has confirmed recusal’s role in these cases but has been
reluctant to apply due process protections too broadly. The Court has

=== PAGE 31 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
applied the Due Process Clause most readily in cases where the adjudicator
had a financial interest in the outcome of...state supreme court justices. The
Court found due process violations where a state supreme court justice
participated in a case in which his largest judicial campaign donor was a
party, and where a state supreme court justice took part in the review of a
defendant’s death sentence that the justice had personally approved while
serving as the district attorney responsible for the case. In each instance,
the Court cited the justice’s 'probability of actual bias' as grounds for
recusal.
Summary
Recusal is a mechanism to address due process violations when there is a
potential for bias or conflict of interest by the adjudicator. The Supreme
Court has recognized due process violations in cases where there is a
probability of actual bias, such as financial interests or prior involvement in
the case. This is relevant to the litigant's ultra vires claim because it
suggests that actions taken by a judge without proper authority or while
biased could be considered void or subject to challenge.

Extract
Whenever any case is pending in which the district judge or criminal district
judge is disqualified from trying the case, no change of venue shall be made
necessary thereby; but the judge presiding shall certify that fact to the
presiding judge of the administrative judicial district in which the case is
pending and the presiding judge of such administrative judicial district shall
assign a judge to try such case in accordance with the provisions of Article
200a, V.A.C.S.
Summary
In Texas, when a judge is disqualified from a case, the presiding judge of the
administrative judicial district must assign another judge to the case. This
process ensures that the case is handled by a qualified judge and maintains
the integrity of the judicial process. If a judge acts without proper authority,
such as issuing orders while disqualified or without reinstatement, those
actions can be considered ultra vires, meaning beyond their legal power or
authority.

Extract
A Texas judge may be removed from presiding over a case for one of three
reasons: he is constitutionally disqualified; he is subject to a statutory strike
(as in civil cases); or he is subject to statutory disqualification or recusal
under Texas Supreme Court rules. Gaal v. State, 332 S.W.3d 448 (Tex. Crim.
App. 2011).
Summary
A judge in Texas may be removed from a case if they are constitutionally
disqualified, subject to a statutory strike, or subject to statutory
disqualification or recusal under Texas Supreme Court rules. This is relevant
to the ultra vires claim because if a judge acts without proper authority,
such as issuing orders while recusal is pending or without reinstatement,
those actions can be considered ultra vires, meaning beyond their legal
power or authority.

Summary
In Texas, once a judge has signed a voluntary recusal order, they no longer
have the authority to take any further action in the case. This is a clear
example of an ultra vires act, which refers to actions taken by a government
official or entity that exceed the scope of their legal power or authority. In
the context of the provided memorandum, if a judge continued to act after
recusal, those actions would be considered ultra vires and void.

Extract
A judge does not have authority to take any further action after signing a
voluntary recusal order. Ex parte Thuesen, 546 S.W.3d 145, 147 (Tex. Crim.
App. 2017). Interim or ancillary orders made by a regional presiding judge
regarding the recusal of a trial judge—or the reinstatement or modification
of judicial authority following a recusal—must be made in writing, signed by
the presiding judge, and entered of record in the case. Ex parte Thuesen,
546 S.W.3d at 156.
Summary
A judge in Texas does not have the authority to take further action in a case
after signing a voluntary recusal order. Any interim or ancillary orders
related to the recusal must be made in writing by the regional presiding
judge and entered into the record. This is relevant to the ultra vires claim
because if a judge acts beyond their authority, such as issuing orders after
recusal without proper reinstatement, those actions can be considered ultra
vires, meaning beyond their legal power or authority.
CHAPTER 6 Petitions for Writ of Mandamus
Practitioner's Guide to Civil Appeals in Texas - Full Court Press
Extract
Appellate courts have also held that mandamus is available when a new trial
is granted in violation of procedural and jurisdictional rules, such as a grant
of new trial after plenary power has expired. The Texas Supreme Court has
also held that mandamus is available from an order granting a new trial
'when the trial court erroneously finds that the jury's answers to special
issues are irreparably conflicting.' And the Texas Supreme Court has
reviewed the grant of a new trial motion based on juror conduct by
mandamus. • Void orders
Summary
Mandamus relief is available in Texas when there are violations of
procedural and jurisdictional rules, such as when a trial court acts beyond
its authority (ultra vires) by issuing orders after its plenary power has
expired. This is relevant to the litigant's claim of ultra vires actions by the
court, as it suggests that such actions can be challenged through mandamus
petitions.

Summary
Once a judge has signed a voluntary recusal order, they are not authorized
to take any further action in the case. This is a clear statement of the limits
of judicial authority following recusal, which is relevant to the ultra vires

recusal, those actions can be challenged as ultra vires, meaning beyond the
powers legally granted to them.

are beyond their legal authority, thus constituting ultra vires acts.
When Is Governmental Immunity Waived By The Acts Of Governmental
Officials? Ultra Vires Revisited
Extract
The Board's sovereign immunity from suit as a state agency extends to its
officials who act consistently with the law but not to those who act ultra
vires—that is, 'without legal authority or [by] fail[ing] to perform a purely
ministerial act.' An official acts without legal authority when he 'exceeds the
bounds of his granted authority or if his acts conflict with the law itself.' An
official fails to perform a ministerial act when he fails to comply with a law
that 'prescribes and defines the duties to be performed with such precision
and certainty as to leave nothing to the exercise of discretion or judgment.'

=== PAGE 35 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
An official who acts ultra vires is not acting for the state and not entitled to
its immunity.
Summary
In Texas, governmental officials are not entitled to immunity when they act
ultra vires, meaning they act without legal authority or fail to perform a
ministerial act as defined by law. This is relevant to the litigant's claim
because if the court or its officials acted beyond their legal authority or
failed to perform required duties, those actions could be considered ultra
vires, thus waiving immunity and allowing the litigant to challenge those
actions.
The Ultra Vires Exception To Sovereign Immunity In Texas
Extract
The ultra vires doctrine is a narrow exception to governmental immunity. An
ultra vires claim against a government official-that is, a suit against a
government official for acting outside his or her authority and seeking to
require the official to comply with statutory or constitutional provisions-is
not barred by immunity. Such a suit is known as an ultra vires suit. An ultra
vires claim cannot be maintained against the governmental entity directly.
Rather, it is brought against the government official. Before 2009, the Texas
Supreme Court used the phrase 'ultra vires' sparingly in connection with
suits against the state, its subdivisions, or officials. But in 2009, the Court
began to use the phrase regularly in the context of suits against
governmental entities and their officials. In City of El Paso v. Heinrich, the
court analyzed a case involving a suit for declaratory and injunctive relief
against a pension fund board and its members for allegedly unlawfully
reducing benefits. The Texas Supreme Court found that governmental
immunity did not bar the suit for prospective injunctive relief against the
pension board members in their official capacities. The court held that ultra
vires suits could not, however, be brought against the state or its political
subdivisions. That is, the suit could only be brought against government
actors in their official capacities. The Texas Supreme court defined an ultra
vires claim as 'an action to determine or protect a private party's rights
against a state official who has acted without legal or statutory authority,'
and did not confine ultra vires acts to acts taken 'outside' the agency's
jurisdictional authority.
Summary
The ultra vires doctrine allows for suits against government officials who act
outside their legal or statutory authority. This doctrine is an exception to
governmental immunity, meaning that while governmental entities
themselves are typically immune from suit, individual officials can be sued in
their official capacities if they exceed their authority. The Texas Supreme
Court has clarified that such suits are permissible for prospective injunctive

relief, as seen in the City of El Paso v. Heinrich case. This means that if a
government official in Texas acts without legal authority, a private party can
bring an ultra vires claim against that official to protect their rights.
