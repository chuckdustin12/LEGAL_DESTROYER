Question
The Plaintiff alleged a series of acts spanning from December 2023 through
May 2025, including wire fraud, Travel Act violations, and ongoing threats
and communications, all in furtherance of a single scheme to defraud and
injure the Plaintiff. To plead a valid RICO claim, a plaintiff must plausibly
allege that a defendant “(1) conducted the affairs (2) of an enterprise (3)
through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity.” (Johnson v. Heath, 56 F.4th
851, 858 (10th Cir. 2022)). A “pattern” requires both relatedness and
continuity. (H.J. Inc. v. Nw. Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 239-41 (1989)). The
judge found that the Plaintiff failed to allege a “pattern” because the
predicate acts were “isolated,” directed at a single victim, and completed
within a short period. However, the Plaintiff’s complaint specifically alleges
both closed-ended and open-ended continuity, as well as relatedness, by
stating: - “The scheme extends over a substantial period—from December
2023 through May 2025, over eighteen months.” (Complaint ¶ 86(i)) -
“Defendants Myers and Branthoover have continued to further their
racketeering activity through a series of ongoing illicit acts, demonstrating a
clear pattern of continuity and relatedness. These acts include, but are not
limited to: Myers and Branthoover continuing to engage in interstate
communications regarding case details between one another across state
lines, specifically between Texas and Oklahoma, in direct furtherance of
their fraudulent scheme to see the divorce through to its
finalization.” (Complaint ¶ 49) - “Branthoover delivering ongoing threats and
intimidation to Plaintiff regarding his legitimate attempts to seek legal relief
from the orders that were a product of the Defendants’ actions, which
occurred in December of 2023, June of 2024, December of 2024, and May of
2025.” (Complaint ¶ 49) - “The scheme also poses a threat of continued
criminal activity. Branthoover’s message on May 24, 2025, demonstrating
continued monitoring of Plaintiff’s activities and threatening future
retaliation, indicates that the racketeering activity could continue
indefinitely given that they are unable to finalize the divorce.” (Complaint ¶
86(ii)) The Plaintiff further alleges that the acts were not isolated, but part
of a coordinated, ongoing enterprise: - “The factual allegations demonstrate
the formation of an associate-in-fact enterprise between Myers and
Branthoover that satisfies the definition in 18 U.S.C. § 1961
(2025).” (Complaint ¶ 91) - “The enterprise functioned as a continuing unit
from December 2023 through May 2025, with consistent roles and
coordinated actions throughout this period.” (Complaint ¶ 91(iii)) Thus, the
Plaintiff’s complaint, when taken as true and liberally construed (as required
for pro se pleadings), plausibly alleges both relatedness and continuity
sufficient to meet the RICO “pattern” requirement. The judge erred by
disregarding these well-pleaded allegations and by focusing solely on the
initial acts, rather than the ongoing nature of the alleged scheme. 
Answer (U.S. Federal)

Short response
The Plaintiff’s complaint, when liberally construed and taken as true,
plausibly alleges both relatedness and continuity sufficient to meet the RICO
“pattern” requirement, and the judge erred by disregarding these well-
pleaded allegations and focusing solely on the initial acts. The allegations of
an ongoing scheme spanning eighteen months, involving multiple predicate
acts and a threat of continued criminal activity, are sufficient under
established RICO jurisprudence.
Summary
The RICO statute requires a plaintiff to allege a “pattern of racketeering
activity,” which consists of both relatedness and continuity. The Plaintiff’s
complaint details a series of coordinated acts over an eighteen-month
period, involving wire fraud, Travel Act violations, and ongoing threats, all in
furtherance of a single fraudulent scheme, and further alleges a threat of
continued criminal conduct—facts that, if true, satisfy both the relatedness
and continuity prongs as interpreted by the Supreme Court and federal
appellate courts.
The judge’s conclusion that the acts were “isolated,” directed at a single
victim, and completed within a short period is inconsistent with the
controlling legal standards, which recognize that a single scheme targeting
one victim can still constitute a RICO pattern if the acts are related and
either extend over a substantial period (closed-ended continuity) or pose a
threat of future criminal activity (open-ended continuity). The Plaintiff’s
allegations, including the ongoing nature of the enterprise and the threat of
future racketeering, are sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss under the
relevant authorities.
Background and Relevant Law
Statutory Framework
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), codified at
18 U.S.C. §§ 1961–1968, provides a civil cause of action for persons injured
by a “pattern of racketeering activity” conducted through an “enterprise.”
The statute defines a “pattern of racketeering activity” as requiring at least
two acts of racketeering within ten years, but the Supreme Court has
clarified that two acts alone are not necessarily sufficient; the acts must be
both related and continuous (H.J. Inc. v. Nw. Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229
(1989); Ouwinga v. Benistar 419 Plan Servs., Inc., 694 F.3d 783, 795 (6th Cir.
2012)).
Case Law
The Supreme Court in H.J. Inc. v. Nw. Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229 (1989)
established the “relationship plus continuity” test for the RICO pattern
requirement. Relatedness is satisfied if the predicate acts have similar

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods, or are otherwise
interrelated and not isolated events. Continuity can be shown in two ways:
Closed-ended continuity: A series of related predicate acts extending
over a substantial period of time.
Open-ended continuity: Predicate acts that pose a threat of
continued criminal activity into the future.
Numerous federal appellate and district courts have applied and elaborated
on these standards. For example, GICC Capital Corp. v. Technology Finance
Group, Inc., 67 F.3d 463 (2d Cir. 1995) and Heinrich v. Waiting Angels
Adoption Servs., Inc., 668 F.3d 393 (6th Cir. 2012) both reaffirm that
continuity may be closed-ended (substantial period) or open-ended (threat of
repetition). Courts have also recognized that a single scheme, even if
directed at one victim, can satisfy the pattern requirement if these elements
are met (Ashland Oil, Inc. v. Arnett, 875 F.2d 1271 (7th Cir. 1989); U.S. v.
Indelicato, 865 F.2d 1370 (2d Cir. 1989)).
The Third Circuit in Tabas v. Tabas, 47 F.3d 1280 (3d Cir. 1995) (declined to
extend on other grounds by Yucaipa Am. All. Fund I, LP v. Ehrlich, No.
16-3664 (3d Cir. Nov 15, 2017)) held that a scheme lasting over three years
was sufficient to establish closed-ended continuity, and cited with approval
cases finding periods as short as fourteen or nineteen months sufficient.
However, the subsequent treatment in Yucaipa cautions against automatic
application of Tabas to all fact patterns, particularly where the context or
nature of the scheme differs, but does not undermine its core holding
regarding duration.
Secondary Materials
Secondary sources confirm that the “pattern” requirement is intentionally
flexible, focusing on the relatedness and continuity of the acts. Both closed-
ended and open-ended continuity are recognized, and courts are instructed
to conduct a fact-specific, case-by-case analysis (Civil Rico: A Tool of
Advocacy; RICO: A Primer; Racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations
(various years)).
Analysis
1. Relatedness
The Plaintiff’s complaint alleges that Myers and Branthoover engaged in a
series of acts—wire fraud, Travel Act violations, and threats—over an
eighteen-month period, all in furtherance of a single fraudulent scheme to
injure the Plaintiff. The acts are described as coordinated, with consistent
roles and ongoing communications between the defendants, and are alleged
to have the same purpose (defrauding and injuring the Plaintiff), the same
participants (Myers and Branthoover), and the same victim (the Plaintiff).
This satisfies the relatedness prong as articulated in H.J. Inc. and its
progeny, which require that the acts be connected by purpose, participants,
• 
• 

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
or method, and not be isolated events (Chambers v. King Buick GMC, LLC,
43 F. Supp. 3d 575 (D. Md. 2014); Day v. DB Capital Grp. LLC, Civil Action
No. DKC 10-1658 (D. Md. Mar 11, 2011)). The secondary materials further
confirm that relatedness is broadly construed and does not require multiple
schemes or victims (RICO: A Primer; U.S. v. Indelicato, 865 F.2d 1370 (2d
Cir. 1989)).
2. Continuity
a. Closed-Ended Continuity
Closed-ended continuity is established by a series of related predicate acts
extending over a “substantial period of time.” The Plaintiff alleges acts from
December 2023 through May 2025—an eighteen-month period. Courts have
found that periods of fourteen, eighteen, or nineteen months can be
sufficient to establish closed-ended continuity (Tabas v. Tabas, 47 F.3d 1280
(3d Cir. 1995) (noting that a nineteen-month period was sufficient); Swistock
v. Jones, 884 F.2d 755, 759 (3d Cir. 1989) (fourteen months may suffice); 
GICC Capital Corp. v. Technology Finance Group, Inc., 67 F.3d 463 (2d Cir.
1995)). The secondary materials reinforce that a “substantial period” is a
flexible concept, but periods of a year or more are generally sufficient
(Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (1999); RICO: A
Primer).
While Tabas has been declined to extend in Yucaipa Am. All. Fund I, LP v.
Ehrlich, the subsequent case did not reject the principle that a scheme of
this duration can satisfy closed-ended continuity; rather, it cautioned against
mechanical application and emphasized the need to consider the nature of
the scheme and the context. Here, the Plaintiff’s allegations of repeated,
coordinated acts over eighteen months, with ongoing threats and
communications, fit squarely within the type of conduct recognized as
sufficient for closed-ended continuity.
b. Open-Ended Continuity
Open-ended continuity is present where the predicate acts pose a threat of
continued criminal activity into the future. The Plaintiff alleges that as of
May 2025, the defendants continued to monitor and threaten the Plaintiff,
and that the scheme could continue indefinitely if the divorce is not
finalized. This ongoing threat, coupled with the history of repeated acts,
supports a finding of open-ended continuity (Heinrich v. Waiting Angels
Adoption Servs., Inc., 668 F.3d 393 (6th Cir. 2012); Related Cos. v. Ruthling,
17-cv-4175 (S.D.N.Y. Dec 15, 2017); Gross v. Waywell, 628 F.Supp.2d 475
(S.D.N.Y. 2009)).
The Supreme Court and lower courts have repeatedly held that a threat of
future criminal conduct, even if the acts to date are limited in number or
scope, can satisfy the continuity requirement (H.J. Inc.; U.S. v. Busacca, 936
F.2d 232 (6th Cir. 1991); Olive Can Co., Inc. v. Martin, 906 F.2d 1147 (7th
Cir. 1990)). The Plaintiff’s allegations of ongoing threats and the potential

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
for continued racketeering activity are precisely the type of facts that courts
have found sufficient for open-ended continuity.
3. Single Scheme and Single Victim
The judge’s focus on the fact that the acts were directed at a single victim
and part of a single scheme is misplaced. Courts have expressly rejected the
notion that multiple victims or schemes are required. A single scheme
targeting one victim can constitute a pattern if the acts are related and
continuous (Ashland Oil, Inc. v. Arnett, 875 F.2d 1271 (7th Cir. 1989); U.S. v.
Indelicato, 865 F.2d 1370 (2d Cir. 1989); Banks v. Wolk, 918 F.2d 418 (3d Cir.
1990)). The key inquiry is whether the acts are related and whether they
amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity, not the number of
victims or schemes.
4. Pro Se Pleading Standard
The Plaintiff’s pro se status requires the court to construe the complaint
liberally and accept all well-pleaded allegations as true at the motion to
dismiss stage. The complaint’s detailed allegations of ongoing, coordinated
acts over an extended period, with a threat of future criminal conduct, are
more than sufficient to survive dismissal under the relevant standards
(Chambers v. King Buick GMC, LLC, 43 F. Supp. 3d 575 (D. Md. 2014); 
ArmorSource, LLC v. Kapah, Case No. 2:18-cv-905 (S.D. Ohio Mar 26,
2020)).
Exceptions and Caveats
While the authorities overwhelmingly support the sufficiency of the
Plaintiff’s allegations, courts retain discretion to assess the particular facts
of each case. The subsequent treatment of Tabas v. Tabas in Yucaipa Am. All.
Fund I, LP v. Ehrlich means that duration alone is not dispositive; courts
must also consider the nature of the scheme, the number and variety of
predicate acts, and whether the conduct is the type of long-term criminal
activity RICO was intended to address. However, the Plaintiff’s allegations of
repeated, coordinated acts, ongoing threats, and a continuing enterprise are
precisely the type of conduct that courts have found sufficient.
It is also important to note that while the complaint must allege facts
supporting each element, the ultimate burden of proof remains with the
Plaintiff at later stages. At the pleading stage, however, the detailed and
specific allegations in the complaint are sufficient.
Conclusion
The Plaintiff’s complaint, when liberally construed and taken as true,
plausibly alleges both relatedness and continuity sufficient to meet the RICO
“pattern” requirement. The judge erred by disregarding the ongoing nature
of the alleged scheme and focusing solely on the initial acts. The authorities
make clear that a single scheme targeting one victim, if it involves related

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
predicate acts over a substantial period or poses a threat of continued
criminal activity, satisfies the RICO pattern requirement. The Plaintiff’s
allegations of an eighteen-month scheme with ongoing threats and
communications, and a continuing enterprise, are more than sufficient to
survive a motion to dismiss under established RICO jurisprudence.
Legal Authorities
U.S. v. Busacca, 936 F.2d 232 (6th Cir. 1991)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Sixth Circuit
Extract
In the recent case of H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone, Inc., 492 U.S.
229, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989), the Supreme Court explained
RICO's pattern of racketeering activity requirement. The Court stated that a
pattern of racketeering activity can be established by showing that 'the
racketeering predicate acts are related, and that they amount to or pose a
threat of continuing criminal activity.' ... 'Continuity' is both a closed- and
open-ended concept, referring either to a closed period of repeated conduct,
or to past conduct that by its nature projects into the future with a threat of
repetition.... A party alleging a RICO violation may demonstrate continuity
over a closed period by proving a series of related predicates extending over
a substantial period of time. Predicate acts extending over a few weeks or
months and threatening no future criminal conduct do not satisfy this
requirement: Congress was concerned in RICO with long-term criminal
conduct.
Summary
Continuity can be demonstrated through either a closed period of repeated
conduct or a threat of future repetition. This aligns with the Plaintiff's
allegations of both closed-ended and open-ended continuity, as well as
relatedness, over an 18-month period, which could satisfy the RICO pattern
requirement.

In H.J. Inc., the Supreme Court outlined the basic contours of the continuity
requirement as follows: 'Continuity' is both a closed- and open-ended
concept, referring either to a closed period of repeated conduct, or to past
conduct that by its nature projects into the future with a threat of
repetition.... A party alleging a RICO violation may demonstrate continuity

over a closed period by proving a series of related predicates extending over
a substantial period of time. Predicate acts extending over a few weeks or
months and threatening no future criminal conduct do not satisfy this
requirement: Congress was concerned in RICO with long-term criminal
conduct. Often a RICO action will be brought before continuity can be
established in this way. In such cases, liability depends on whether the
threat of continuity is demonstrated.
Summary
The continuity requirement for a RICO claim can be satisfied by
demonstrating either closed-ended continuity (a series of related predicates
over a substantial period) or open-ended continuity (past conduct with a
threat of future repetition). The Plaintiff's allegations of acts spanning over
eighteen months and the threat of continued criminal activity align with the
continuity requirement as outlined in H.J. Inc.
Kehr Packages, Inc. v. Fidelcor, Inc., 926 F.2d 1406 (3rd Cir. 1991)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Third Circuit
Extract
In H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co., 492 U.S. 229, 109 S.Ct.
2893, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989), the Supreme Court stressed that a plaintiff
must show also 'that the racketeering acts are related, and that they amount
to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity.' Id. at 239, 109 S.Ct. at
2900 (emphasis in original). ... Rather, related predicate acts in furtherance
of a single scheme can constitute a pattern if the acts constitute or present
the threat of long-term continuous criminal activity. ... Continuity refers
'either to a closed period of repeated conduct, or to past conduct that by its
nature projects into the future with a threat of repetition.' Id. at 241, 109
S.Ct. at 2902. ... The Court stated flatly (492 U.S. at 242, 109 S.Ct. at 2902)
that '[a] party alleging a RICO violation may demonstrate continuity over a
closed period by proving a series of related predicates extending over a
substantial period of time.'
Summary
The Supreme Court's interpretation in H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell
Telephone Co. is crucial for understanding the "pattern" requirement under
RICO. The passage emphasizes that related predicate acts in furtherance of
a single scheme can constitute a pattern if they present a threat of long-
term continuous criminal activity. The Court's focus on continuity as a
temporal concept, where a series of related predicates extending over a
substantial period of time can demonstrate continuity, directly supports the
Plaintiff's argument that the alleged acts from December 2023 through May
2025 meet the RICO pattern requirement.

Tabas v. Tabas, 47 F.3d 1280 (3rd Cir. 1995)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Third Circuit
Extract
We conclude that a scheme lasting over three years extends over a
'substantial' period of time and therefore constitutes the type of 'long-term
criminal conduct' that RICO was enacted to address. See United States v.
Pelullo, 964 F.2d 193, 209 (3d Cir.1992) (holding that a jury could find a
nineteen month period of racketeering activity sufficient to satisfy continuity
requirement); Swistock v. Jones, 884 F.2d 755, 759 (3d Cir.1989) (fourteen
month period of conduct may be sufficient to establish closed-ended
continuity). Accordingly, we find, from the strictly durational aspect of the
scheme, that plaintiffs in the present case have made a sufficient showing to
survive summary judgment on the 'continuity' prong of the pattern analysis.
Summary
The court in "Tabas v. Tabas" found that a scheme lasting over a substantial
period, such as three years, constitutes long-term criminal conduct under
RICO. The court also referenced other cases where periods of fourteen and
nineteen months were deemed sufficient to establish continuity. This
supports the proposition that the Plaintiff's alleged scheme, spanning over
eighteen months, could meet the continuity requirement for a RICO claim.
Banks v. Wolk, 918 F.2d 418 (3rd Cir. 1990)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Third Circuit
Extract
Predicate offenses committed in furtherance of a single criminal scheme can
constitute a RICO pattern if the acts present the threat of future criminal
activity. The criminal conduct need not be ongoing. Past conduct will satisfy
the continuity requirement if 'by its nature [it] projects into the future with a
threat of repetition.'
Summary
The court in Banks v. Wolk recognized that a single scheme can satisfy the
RICO pattern requirement if it poses a threat of future criminal activity. This
aligns with the Plaintiff's argument that the alleged scheme, although
directed at a single victim, extends over a substantial period and poses a
threat of continued criminal activity, thus meeting the continuity
requirement.

Prong three — known as the 'continuity requirement' — can be satisfied
either by showing a 'closed-ended' pattern of racketeering activity (i.e., a
series of related predicate acts extending over a substantial period of time) -
or by demonstrating an 'open-ended' pattern of racketeering activity that
poses a threat of continuing criminal conduct beyond the period during
which the predicate acts were performed. H.J. Inc. v. Nw. Bell Tel. Co., 492

Summary
Continuity requirement for a RICO claim, which can be satisfied by either a
closed-ended pattern (a series of related acts over a substantial period) or
an open-ended pattern (posing a threat of continued criminal conduct). This
directly relates to the Plaintiff's allegations of both closed-ended and open-
ended continuity in their RICO claim, as they allege acts spanning over
eighteen months and a threat of continued criminal activity.
U.S. v. Indelicato, 865 F.2d 1370 (2nd Cir. 1989)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Second Circuit
Extract
For the reasons below, we conclude today that proof of two acts of
racketeering activity without more does not suffice to establish a RICO
pattern; that the concepts of relatedness and continuity are attributes of
activity, not of a RICO enterprise, and that a RICO pattern may not be
established without some showing that the racketeering acts are
interrelated and that there is continuity or a threat of continuity; that a
pattern may be established without proof of multiple schemes, multiple
episodes, or multiple transactions; and that racketeering acts that are not
widely separated in time or space may nonetheless, given other evidence of
the threat of continuity, constitute a RICO pattern.
Summary
A pattern can be established without multiple schemes or episodes, and
even acts not widely separated in time or space can form a pattern if there is
evidence of a threat of continuity. This supports the Plaintiff's argument that
their allegations of ongoing acts over an extended period demonstrate the
necessary continuity and relatedness to establish a RICO pattern.

Heinrich v. Waiting Angels Adoption Servs., Inc., 668 F.3d 393 (6th Cir.
2012)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Sixth Circuit
Extract
To establish a substantive RICO violation, a plaintiff must show “a pattern of
racketeering activity.” 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). A pattern of racketeering activity
requires, at minimum, two acts of racketeering activity within ten years of
each other. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5). While the statute defines the minimum
number of acts necessary to establish a pattern of racketeering activity, the
Supreme Court has held that the minimum two acts are not necessarily
sufficient. In order to show a “pattern” of racketeering activity, a plaintiff
must show “that the racketeering predicates are related, and that they
amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity.” H.J. Inc. v. Nw.
Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 237–39, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106 L.Ed.2d 195
(1989). ... The continuity prong of the test can be satisfied by showing either
a “close-ended” pattern (a series of related predicate acts extending over a
substantial period of time) or an “open-ended” pattern (a set of predicate
acts that poses a threat of continuing criminal conduct extending beyond the
period in which the predicate acts were performed). Id. at 241–42, 109 S.Ct.
2893.
Summary
Requirements for establishing a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO,
emphasizing the need for relatedness and continuity. It explains that
continuity can be demonstrated through either a close-ended pattern (acts
over a substantial period) or an open-ended pattern (threat of ongoing
criminal activity). This directly supports the Plaintiff's argument that their
allegations meet the RICO pattern requirement by demonstrating both
relatedness and continuity, as the alleged acts span over eighteen months
and pose a threat of continued criminal activity.

U.S. Court of Appeals — Seventh Circuit
Extract
Characterizing the Count II allegations as a single scheme does not preclude
the finding of a pattern. In SK Hand Tool Corp., we noted that it is an
exception to the general rule to find a pattern within a single scheme. 852 F.
2d at 941 (citing Jones, 845 F.2d at 758-59). However, we have done just
that in a number of cases, including this court's most recent decision on the
issue, in Deppe, 863 F.2d at 1364-66, and in Morgan, where we said 'the
mere fact that the predicate acts relate to the same overall scheme or
involve the same victim does not mean that the acts automatically fail to
satisfy the pattern requirement.' 804 F.2d at 976.

=== PAGE 11 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
The court recognizes that a single scheme can still satisfy the "pattern"
requirement for RICO claims. The passage specifically notes that even if
predicate acts relate to the same scheme or involve the same victim, they do
not automatically fail to meet the pattern requirement. This supports the
Plaintiff's argument that their allegations, which involve a single scheme
directed at one victim, can still constitute a pattern of racketeering activity.
Gross v. Waywell, 628 F.Supp.2d 475 (S.D. N.Y. 2009)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of New York
Extract
Plaintiffs must also show that they were injured in their business or property
by reason of the alleged RICO violation. See 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c); Moss v.
Morgan Stanley, 719 F.2d 5, 17 (2d Cir.1983). To satisfy the 'pattern'
requirement, the factual allegations must meet two standards: relatedness
and continuity. The pleadings must show that the predicate acts asserted are
related and amount to or pose a threat of continuing criminal activity. ...
These concepts refer 'either to a closed period of repeated conduct, or to
post-conduct that by its nature projects into the future with a threat
repetition.' Id. at 241, 109 S.Ct. 2893. Closed-ended continuity may be
demonstrated by a series of related predicate acts which occurred over a
substantial period of time. See id. Open-ended continuity requires a showing
of the existence of a threat of containing criminal activity beyond the period
during which the predicate acts were performed. See Cofacrèdit, 187 F.3d at
243.
Summary
The passage from Gross v. Waywell discusses the requirements for
establishing a "pattern" under RICO, emphasizing the need for relatedness
and continuity. It explains that continuity can be either closed-ended,
demonstrated by a series of related acts over a substantial period, or open-
ended, shown by a threat of ongoing criminal activity. This directly supports
the Plaintiff's argument that their allegations meet the RICO "pattern"
requirement by demonstrating both closed-ended and open-ended
continuity.

Extract
To allege a pattern of racketeering activity, a plaintiff must show that at
least two predicate acts occurred within ten years of each other, 18 U.S.C. §
1961(5), that the acts were related, and that they 'amount to or pose a
threat of continued criminal activity,' H.J. Inc. v. Nw. Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S.
229, 240 (1989). Acts are related if they 'have the same or similar purposes,
results, participants, victims, or methods of commission, or otherwise are
interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not isolated events.'
Id. at 240 (quoting Sedima, 473 U.S. at 496, n.14). With respect to the
continuity element, the Fourth Circuit has explained: Continuity... refers
'either to a closed period of repeated conduct, or to past conduct that by its

Summary
Requirements for establishing a "pattern of racketeering activity" under
RICO, which includes demonstrating relatedness and continuity of predicate
acts. The Plaintiff's allegations in the proposition align with these
requirements by detailing acts over an extended period, suggesting both
closed-ended and open-ended continuity, and showing relatedness through
the same scheme and participants. The passage supports the argument that
the Plaintiff's allegations could meet the RICO pattern requirement.
Chambers v. King Buick GMC, LLC, 43 F. Supp. 3d 575 (D. Md. 2014)
U.S. District Court — District of Maryland
Extract
To state a plausible claim of a pattern of racketeering activity, the plaintiff
must allege facts establishing “that the racketeering predicates are related
and that they amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity.” Cf.
H.J. Inc. v. Nw. Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 239, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106 L.Ed.2d
195 (1989) (reversing a 12(b)(6) dismissal of a RICO complaint and
discussing what a plaintiff in a RICO case must show to prove a pattern of
racketeering activity). With respect to the requirement that the predicate
acts be “related,” the Fourth Circuit has explained that “[t]he relationship
criterion may be satisfied by showing that the criminal acts ‘have the same
or similar purposes, victims, or methods of commission, or are otherwise
interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not isolated
events.’” ... A plaintiff can fulfill the continuity-of-activity requirement by
establishing either a closed or open-ended pattern. H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 241,
109 S.Ct. 2893. A “closed-ended” pattern of racketeering activity involves a
course of related predicate acts during a substantial period of time which
naturally comes to a close, while an open-ended pattern involved conduct
“that by its nature projects into the future with a threat of repetition.”

Summary
The passage discusses the requirements for establishing a pattern of
racketeering activity under RICO, specifically the need for relatedness and
continuity. It references the H.J. Inc. case, which is a key authority on this
issue, and explains that continuity can be established through either a
closed-ended or open-ended pattern. This directly supports the proposition
that the Plaintiff's allegations of a scheme spanning over eighteen months
with ongoing threats and communications could meet the RICO pattern
requirement.
Olive Can Co., Inc. v. Martin, 906 F.2d 1147 (7th Cir. 1990)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Seventh Circuit
Extract
The Supreme Court stated in Northwestern Bell that ' 'continuity' is both a
closed- and open-ended concept, referring either to a closed period of
repeated conduct, or to past conduct that by its nature projects into the
future with a threat of repetition.' Id. at 2902. 'A party alleging a RICO
violation may demonstrate continuity over a closed period by proving a
series of related predicates extending over a substantial period of time.
Predicate acts extending over a few weeks or months and threatening no
future criminal conduct do not satisfy this requirement.' Id. Alternatively, a
party may prove a pattern of racketeering activity by proving a 'specific
threat of repetition extending indefinitely into the future' or that the
'predicate acts or offenses are part of an ongoing entity's regular way of
doing business.' Id. at 2902.
Summary
The Supreme Court's interpretation of the "pattern" requirement under
RICO includes both closed-ended and open-ended continuity. The passage
supports the proposition by explaining that continuity can be demonstrated
by a series of related predicates over a substantial period or by showing a
threat of continued criminal activity. This aligns with the Plaintiff's
allegations of acts spanning over eighteen months and the threat of ongoing
criminal conduct.

L.Ed.2d 195 (1989)). The district court assumed that the Plaintiffs had
sufficiently alleged that the predicate acts were related. Addressing the
continuity prong, however, the court found that the predicate acts did not
pose a threat of continuing racketeering activity. We, too, need only address
the continuity prong of the analysis.
Summary
The court in "Abraham v. Singh" addressed the requirement of
demonstrating a "pattern of racketeering activity" under RICO, which
includes both relatedness and continuity. The passage highlights the
necessity of showing that predicate acts are related and pose a threat of
continued criminal activity, aligning with the requirements set forth in H.J.
Inc. v. Nw. Bell Tel. Co. This supports the proposition that the Plaintiff's
allegations of a pattern of racketeering activity, including both closed-ended
and open-ended continuity, should be considered sufficient to meet the RICO
"pattern" requirement.
Ouwinga v. Benistar 419 Plan Servs., Inc., 694 F.3d 783 (6th Cir. 2012)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Sixth Circuit
Extract
To establish a substantive RICO violation, a plaintiff must show “a pattern of
racketeering activity.” 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). A pattern of racketeering activity
requires, at a minimum, two acts of racketeering activity within ten years of
each other. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5) (emphasis in original). The Supreme Court
has held, however, that the minimum two acts are not necessarily sufficient
and that a plaintiff must show “that the racketeering predicates are related,
and that they amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity.” H.J.
Inc. v. Nw. Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 237–39, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106 L.Ed.2d
195 (1989) (emphasis in original). This requirement is known as the
“relationship plus continuity” test.
Summary
To establish a RICO violation, a plaintiff must demonstrate a pattern of
racketeering activity, which requires showing relatedness and continuity of
the predicate acts. The passage supports the proposition by emphasizing the
need for relatedness and continuity, which aligns with the Plaintiff's
allegations of a scheme spanning over eighteen months with ongoing illicit
acts, threats, and communications.

Summary
The passage explains the requirement for a "pattern" of racketeering
activity under RICO, which includes both relatedness and continuity. This
directly supports the proposition that the Plaintiff's allegations of a scheme
spanning over eighteen months with ongoing acts could meet the RICO
"pattern" requirement. The passage also emphasizes that the threat of
continued criminal activity is a key factor, aligning with the Plaintiff's
allegations of ongoing threats and communications.

U.S. District Court — Southern District of New York
Extract
No matter how interrelated Jones' alleged predicate acts may have been,
however, USA simply has not established the necessary 'threat of continuity'
to satisfy the requirements of a 'pattern' of racketeering activity.
Recognizing the difficulty of defining the concept of 'continuity,' the
Supreme Court, in H.J. Inc., offered the following guidance: 'Continuity' is
both a closed- and open-ended concept, referring either to a closed period of
repeated conduct, or to past conduct that by its nature projects into the
future with a threat of repetition. (Citation omitted.) It is, in either case,
centrally a temporal concept — and particularly so in the RICO context,
where what must be continuous, RICO's predicate acts or offenses, and the
relationship these predicates must bear one to another, are distinct
requirements. A party alleging a RICO violation may demonstrate continuity
over a closed period by proving a series of related predicates extending over
a substantial period of time.
Summary
Concept of continuity in the context of RICO claims, as defined by the
Supreme Court in H.J. Inc. It explains that continuity can be demonstrated
through either a closed period of repeated conduct or past conduct that

projects into the future with a threat of repetition. This aligns with the
Plaintiff's allegations of both closed-ended and open-ended continuity in
their RICO claim, as they allege a series of related acts over an 18-month
period and a threat of continued criminal activity.

Extract
The Supreme Court made a second attempt to clarify the 'pattern' concept in
H.J., Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co. In that case, the Court held
that when proving a 'pattern of racketeering activity,' RICO requires both
relationship and continuity of predicate acts as separate elements. However,
the Court recognized that proof of these factors will often overlap. The
relationship prong is defined by the connection of the defendant's criminal
acts to one another: 'continuity' is successfully proved if a prosecutor can
show actual continuity during a past, closed period of repeated conduct or
an open-ended threat of continued racketeering activity in the future.
Summary
The Supreme Court in H.J., Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co. clarified
that a "pattern" of racketeering activity under RICO requires both
relationship and continuity. The passage explains that continuity can be
shown through either a closed period of repeated conduct or an open-ended
threat of continued activity. This directly supports the Plaintiff's argument
that their allegations demonstrate both closed-ended and open-ended
continuity, as well as relatedness, which are necessary to establish a RICO
pattern.

The Supreme Court has stated that a 'pattern of racketeering' can only be
established if the predicate acts are continuous and interrelated. Thus, 'two
isolated acts of racketeering do not constitute a pattern.' In H.J. Inc. v.
Northwestern Bell Telephone Co., the Court held that the government must
establish both a relationship between the predicate acts and continuity of
those acts to prove a 'pattern of racketeering activity' for RICO purposes.
These requirements, referred to as the 'continuity plus relationship' test,
must be proven independently, but the Court has recognized that evidence

establishing the two elements will often overlap. The 'continuity' component
is met by either closed-ended continuity, defined as 'a series of related
predicates extending over a substantial period of time,' or open-ended
continuity, defined as conduct that poses a threat of extending into the
future.
Summary
The Supreme Court requires both continuity and relatedness to establish a
"pattern of racketeering activity" under RICO. The passage explains the
"continuity plus relationship" test, which aligns with the Plaintiff's
allegations of both closed-ended and open-ended continuity, as well as
relatedness. The Plaintiff's complaint alleges a series of acts over eighteen
months, which could satisfy the closed-ended continuity, and ongoing
threats, which could satisfy open-ended continuity. The passage supports the
argument that the judge may have erred by not considering the ongoing
nature of the alleged scheme.

RICO applies only where the commission of two predicate acts constitutes a
'pattern of racketeering activity.' (43) While the statutory definition of
'pattern of racketeering activity' requires at least two acts of racketeering
occurring within ten years of each other, (44) simply proving two acts may
not be sufficient to establish a RICO violation. (45) The Supreme Court has
stated that a 'pattern of racketeering' can only be established if the
predicate acts are continuous and interrelated. (46) Thus, 'two isolated acts
of racketeering do not constitute a pattern.' (47) In H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern

guidance in defining the relationship component of the pattern requirement
of RICO: '[c]riminal conduct forms a pattern if it embraces criminal acts that

Summary
The RICO Act requires a "pattern of racketeering activity," which involves

The 'continuity' prong is successfully proven if a prosecutor can prove 'a
series of related predicates extending over a substantial period of time' or
an open-ended threat of continued racketeering activity in the future. The
H.J., Inc. court suggested a case-by-case examination of this issue. Noting
that the existence of a 'threat of continued racketeering activity' is a
function of particular facts, the Court avoided a black-letter enumeration of
particular factors which may constitute a pattern.
Summary
The continuity prong of the RICO pattern requirement can be satisfied by
demonstrating either a series of related predicate acts over a substantial
period or an open-ended threat of continued racketeering activity. The
passage emphasizes the need for a case-by-case examination and highlights
that the existence of a threat of continued activity is fact-specific. This
supports the Plaintiff's argument that their allegations of acts spanning over
eighteen months and the threat of continued activity meet the continuity
requirement.

Extract
These acts must be related and continuous to constitute a pattern. The
relatedness and continuity issue first came to prominence in a famous
footnote to the Supreme Court’s decision in Sedima. In Sedima, the Court
noted that the term “pattern of racketeering activity” had been left
intentionally vague by Congress, and it invited further clarification by the
lower courts. The Court did not provide a precise definition of what
constitutes a pattern in this context. This ambiguity in the definition of the
statutory word “pattern” occasioned a split among the federal circuit courts
as they attempted to interpret and apply the civil RICO statute. Two primary
issues emerged: 1. Relatedness: This aspect of the pattern requirement
concerns whether the alleged racketeering acts are related to each other.
Courts have grappled with how closely connected these acts must be to
meet the relatedness criterion. Some circuits adopted a broad
interpretation, while others opted for a stricter nexus between the acts. 2.
Continuity: The continuity issue pertains to the temporal aspect of the
pattern. It questions whether the racketeering acts display a continuous
course of conduct over time or whether they are isolated incidents. Courts
have debated how long this course of conduct must persist to satisfy the
continuity criterion. Some circuits adopted a closed-ended approach
(requiring acts within a specific time frame), while others embraced an
open-ended approach (focusing on the threat of future racketeering
activity).
Summary
The concept of a "pattern" in RICO cases involves both relatedness and
continuity. The passage highlights that the term "pattern of racketeering
activity" is intentionally vague, leading to different interpretations by
various circuit courts. The passage also explains that relatedness involves
the connection between acts, while continuity involves the temporal aspect
and whether acts are isolated or part of a continuous course of conduct. This
directly relates to the Plaintiff's argument that their complaint alleges both
closed-ended and open-ended continuity, as well as relatedness, which the
judge failed to consider.

example, that: the racketeering acts furthered the goals of or benefitted the
enterprise, the enterprise or the defendant's role in the enterprise enabled
the defendant to commit, or facilitated the commission of, the racketeering
acts, the racketeering acts were committed at the behest of, or on behalf of,
the enterprise, or the racketeering acts had the same or similar purposes,
results, participants, victims or methods of commission. The continuity
requirement is likewise satisfied where the predicates are a regular way of
conducting the defendant's ongoing legitimate business (in the sense that it
is not a business that exists for criminal purposes), or of conducting or
participating in an ongoing and legitimate RICO 'enterprise.' A plaintiff may
demonstrate a pattern by establishment that the predicate acts pose a threat

the relatedness requirement is met as the acts are part of a coordinated
