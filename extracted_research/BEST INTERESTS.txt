Question
Petitioner’s actions have resulted in instability for the children, including
attempts to deny Respondent access without credible evidence of danger,
and have relied on inflammatory rhetoric rather than substantiated facts.
Under Texas Family Code § 153.002, the best interest of the child is the
primary consideration in determining issues of conservatorship and
possession. By pursuing litigation strategies that prioritize personal
advantage over the children’s stability and well-being, and by making
unsupported allegations that disrupt the children’s relationship with their
father, Petitioner and her counsel have acted in egregious disregard of the
children’s best interests as mandated by law.
Answer (Texas)
Short response
Texas law requires that the best interest of the child be the paramount
consideration in all conservatorship and possession matters, and conduct
that creates instability, seeks to deny access without credible evidence, or
relies on inflammatory rhetoric rather than substantiated facts is contrary to
this mandate. Litigation strategies that disrupt the parent-child relationship
or prioritize personal advantage over the child’s stability and well-being are
legally disfavored and may be sanctioned or rejected by Texas courts.
Summary
The Texas Family Code, particularly § 153.002, establishes that the best
interest of the child is the primary consideration in all decisions regarding
conservatorship and possession. Texas courts consistently interpret this
standard to require stability, evidence-based decision-making, and the
preservation of the parent-child relationship, with a strong presumption in
favor of frequent and continuing contact with both parents unless credible
evidence demonstrates that such contact would endanger the child.
Attempts to deny a parent access without substantiated evidence of danger,
or to use inflammatory and unsupported allegations in litigation, are
inconsistent with both statutory mandates and judicial precedent. Such
conduct undermines the child’s stability and well-being, and courts have
repeatedly held that these tactics are not only contrary to the child’s best
interests but may also justify modification of conservatorship or sanctions
against the offending party.

Background and Relevant Law
Legislative Framework
The Texas Family Code provides a comprehensive statutory scheme
governing conservatorship, possession, and access to children. The central
provision is § 153.002, which unequivocally states that the best interest of
the child must always be the primary consideration in determining issues of
conservatorship and possession or access, regardless of the parties involved,
proposition, authority citation (Tex. Fam. Code § 153.002).
Section 153.001 articulates the public policy of Texas, emphasizing three
core objectives: (1) ensuring children have frequent and continuing contact
with parents who act in their best interest, (2) providing a safe, stable, and
nonviolent environment, and (3) encouraging parents to share in the rights
and duties of raising their child after separation or divorce, proposition,
authority citation (Tex. Fam. Code § 153.001).
Section 153.193 further limits the court’s ability to restrict or deny a
parent’s possession or access, providing that any such restriction must not
exceed what is required to protect the child’s best interest, proposition,
authority citation (Tex. Fam. Code § 153.193). This means that any attempt
to deny or limit access must be justified by credible evidence that such
action is necessary for the child’s welfare.
Section 153.131 establishes a rebuttable presumption that appointing both
parents as joint managing conservators is in the child’s best interest, unless
there is evidence that such an arrangement would significantly impair the
child’s physical health or emotional development, proposition, authority
citation (Tex. Fam. Code § 153.131).
Section 153.134, while specifically addressing joint managing
conservatorship, requires courts to consider whether each parent can
prioritize the child’s welfare, encourage a positive relationship with the
other parent, and minimize disruptions to the child’s routine, proposition,
authority citation (Tex. Fam. Code § 153.134).
Finally, Section 107.109 governs child custody evaluations, mandating that
any opinion restricting access must be based on a thorough, evidence-based
evaluation, including interviews, observations, and collateral information,
proposition, authority citation (Tex. Fam. Code § 107.109).
Case Law
Texas appellate courts have consistently interpreted these statutory
provisions to require that conservatorship and possession decisions be
grounded in the child’s best interest, with a strong emphasis on stability,
evidence-based findings, and the preservation of the parent-child
relationship.
The Texas Supreme Court in Lenz v. Lenz, 79 S.W.3d 10 (Tex. 2002)
reaffirmed that the best interest of the child is the controlling standard, and

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
that public policy favors frequent and continuing contact with fit parents
and a stable environment. Similarly, In the Interest of V.L.K., 24 S.W.3d 338
(Tex. 2000) emphasized the importance of stability and the need to prevent
constant litigation, though it was later disapproved in part by In re C.J.C.,
603 S.W.3d 804 (Tex. 2020) to the extent it failed to fully recognize the
constitutional fit-parent presumption. However, the core best-interest and
stability principles remain authoritative.
The “Holley factors,” first articulated in Holley v. Adams, 544 S.W.2d 367
(Tex. 1976) and subsequently codified by statute, provide a non-exhaustive
list of considerations for best-interest determinations. These include the
child’s desires, emotional and physical needs, danger to the child, parental
abilities, stability of the home, and acts or omissions of the parent that may
indicate an improper parent-child relationship.
Recent appellate decisions, such as Zachery v. Zachery, 04-24-00531-CV
(Tex. App. Aug 20, 2025), In re R.P. (Tex. App. Feb 28, 2024), and Cox v. Cox
(Tex. App. Oct 10, 2023), have applied these principles to hold that
restrictions on access or modifications to conservatorship must be supported
by credible, specific evidence of harm or danger to the child. Unsupported
or inflammatory allegations, or litigation strategies that create instability or
disrupt the parent-child relationship, are consistently found to be contrary to
the child’s best interests.
Other cases, such as W.G. v. Tex. Dep't of Family & Protective Servs. (Tex.
App. Jul 7, 2023), In re R.M. (Tex. App. May 21, 2018), and In re Interest of
B.O. (Tex. App. Jun 15, 2017), further reinforce the centrality of stability and
the need for evidence-based decision-making, while condemning conduct
that injects uncertainty or instability into the child’s life.
Courts have also recognized that attempts to deny access or interfere with
the parent-child relationship without credible evidence of danger are legally
reprehensible and may justify modification of conservatorship or other
remedial action, proposition, authority citation (Marriage of Chandler,
Matter of, 914 S.W.2d 252 (Tex. App. 1996); Gunther v. Gunther, 478 S.W.2d
821 (Tex. Ct. App. 1972)).
Analysis
The Best Interest Standard and Its Application
The statutory and case law framework in Texas makes clear that the best
interest of the child is the paramount consideration in all conservatorship
and possession matters, proposition, authority citation (Tex. Fam. Code §
153.002; Lenz v. Lenz, 79 S.W.3d 10 (Tex. 2002)). This standard is not merely
aspirational; it is a binding legal requirement that governs every aspect of
judicial decision-making in this context.
The public policy of Texas, as articulated in § 153.001, is to ensure that
children have frequent and continuing contact with both parents, provided
those parents act in the child’s best interest, and to provide a stable,
nonviolent environment. Any conduct or litigation strategy that seeks to

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
deny access to a parent without credible evidence of danger, or that relies
on inflammatory rhetoric rather than substantiated facts, directly
undermines these policy goals, proposition, authority citation (Tex. Fam.
Code § 153.001).
Section 153.193 further limits the ability of courts (and, by extension,
litigants) to restrict or deny a parent’s access to their child. Any such
restriction must be narrowly tailored and supported by credible evidence
that it is necessary to protect the child’s best interest. Attempts to impose
greater restrictions than necessary, or to deny access without substantiated
evidence of harm, are inconsistent with the statutory mandate and may be
grounds for reversal or modification, proposition, authority citation (Tex.
Fam. Code § 153.193; Brandon v. Rudisel, 586 S.W.3d 94 (Tex. App. 2019)).
The presumption in favor of joint managing conservatorship, codified in §
153.131, further underscores the legal expectation that both parents will
remain actively involved in the child’s life unless there is credible evidence
that such involvement would significantly impair the child’s physical health
or emotional development. Litigation strategies that seek to rebut this
presumption without substantiated evidence are disfavored and may be
rejected by the courts, proposition, authority citation (Tex. Fam. Code §
153.131; In re C.J.C., 603 S.W.3d 804 (Tex. 2020)).
Judicial Interpretation and the Role of Evidence
Texas courts have consistently held that decisions regarding conservatorship
and possession must be based on credible, specific evidence, not on
speculation, suspicion, or inflammatory rhetoric. In In re R.P. (Tex. App. Feb
28, 2024), the court found an abuse of discretion where a parent was denied
access absent current evidence of specific actions or omissions
demonstrating harm to the child. Similarly, M. A. R. G. v. Tex. Dep't of Family
& Protective Servs. (Tex. App. Dec 11, 2020) emphasized that courts require
evidence of specific conduct likely to result in harm, and that mere suspicion
or speculation is insufficient.
The Holley factors, as articulated in Holley v. Adams, 544 S.W.2d 367 (Tex.
1976) and routinely applied in subsequent cases, provide a framework for
evaluating the best interest of the child. These factors include the child’s
desires, emotional and physical needs, danger to the child, parental abilities,
stability of the home, and acts or omissions of the parent. Notably, the
stability of the home and the acts or omissions of the parent that may
indicate an improper parent-child relationship are directly implicated when
a parent or their counsel pursues litigation strategies that create instability
or disrupt the child’s relationship with the other parent.
In Cox v. Cox (Tex. App. Oct 10, 2023), the court addressed a situation
where a parent made false allegations of abuse and attempted to interfere
with the other parent’s relationship with the children. The court found that
such conduct undermined stability and the parent-child relationship,
justifying modification of conservatorship. This case is directly on point in
condemning litigation strategies that rely on unsupported, inflammatory
allegations.

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Similarly, W.G. v. Tex. Dep't of Family & Protective Servs. (Tex. App. Jul 7,
2023) and A. C. v. Tex. Dep't of Family & Protective Servs., 577 S.W.3d 689
(Tex. App. 2019) both emphasize that stability and permanence are
paramount in the upbringing of children, and that conduct creating
uncertainty or instability endangers the child’s well-being.
Courts have also recognized that attempts to deny access or interfere with
the parent-child relationship without credible evidence of danger are legally
reprehensible and may justify modification of conservatorship or other
remedial action, proposition, authority citation (Marriage of Chandler,
Matter of, 914 S.W.2d 252 (Tex. App. 1996); Gunther v. Gunther, 478 S.W.2d
821 (Tex. Ct. App. 1972)).
Litigation Conduct and the Child’s Best Interest
Litigation strategies that prioritize personal advantage over the child’s
stability and well-being, or that rely on unsupported allegations and
inflammatory rhetoric, are inconsistent with the statutory and judicial
mandates governing conservatorship and possession. Such conduct not only
undermines the child’s stability but also disrupts the parent-child
relationship, both of which are central to the best-interest analysis.
In Patterson v. Brist, 236 S.W.3d 238 (Tex. App. 2006), the court criticized
modification efforts that lacked evidentiary support and created instability,
noting that prolonged litigation and unsupported inferences can themselves
be sources of instability. Similarly, In the Interest of V.L.K., 24 S.W.3d 338
(Tex. 2000) (though later disapproved in part by In re C.J.C., 603 S.W.3d 804
(Tex. 2020) on the fit-parent presumption) emphasized the importance of
stability and the need to prevent constant litigation.
The Texas Supreme Court in Lenz v. Lenz, 79 S.W.3d 10 (Tex. 2002) and the
appellate court in In re A.L.E., 279 S.W.3d 424 (Tex. App. 2009) both
reaffirmed that the best interest of the child is the controlling standard, and
that public policy favors frequent and continuing contact with fit parents
and a stable environment.
Attempts to deny access or impose restrictions without credible evidence of
danger are not only inconsistent with the statutory mandate but may also be
grounds for reversal or modification, as seen in Brandon v. Rudisel, 586 S.W.
3d 94 (Tex. App. 2019) and In re R.P. (Tex. App. Feb 28, 2024).
The Role of Evidence and the Limits of Judicial Discretion
Texas courts have broad discretion in determining what is in the child’s best
interest, but this discretion is not unfettered. It must be exercised within the
bounds of the statutory framework and supported by credible evidence. As
stated in In re R.M. (Tex. App. May 21, 2018), a trial court abuses its
discretion by ruling without supporting evidence.
Section 107.109 of the Family Code further reinforces the requirement for
evidence-based decision-making, mandating that any custody evaluation
supporting restrictions on access must be grounded in a thorough,

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
methodologically sound evaluation, including interviews, observations, and
collateral information, proposition, authority citation (Tex. Fam. Code §
107.109).
The appellate court in In re B.B.M., 291 S.W.3d 463 (Tex. App. 2009)
emphasized that restricting a parent’s role requires more than speculative
claims; there must be specific, identifiable conduct likely to harm the child.
Mere assertions or suspicions are insufficient.
Parental Presumption and Encouragement of Parent-Child
Relationships
The Texas Family Code and judicial precedent establish a strong
presumption in favor of joint managing conservatorship and frequent,
continuing contact with both parents, unless credible evidence demonstrates
that such arrangements would endanger the child, proposition, authority
citation (Tex. Fam. Code § 153.131; In re C.J.C., 603 S.W.3d 804 (Tex. 2020)).
Courts expect parents to encourage and accept a positive relationship
between the child and the other parent, and conduct that undermines this
expectation is viewed negatively in the best-interest analysis, proposition,
authority citation (Tex. Fam. Code § 153.134; Child Custody Basics In Texas
(2024)).
Attempts to deny access or interfere with the parent-child relationship
without credible evidence of danger are not only inconsistent with the
statutory mandate but may also be grounds for reversal or modification, as
seen in Brandon v. Rudisel, 586 S.W.3d 94 (Tex. App. 2019) and In re R.P.
(Tex. App. Feb 28, 2024).
Exceptions and Caveats
While the best-interest standard is paramount, there are exceptions where
restrictions on access or deviations from joint managing conservatorship are
justified. These include situations where credible evidence demonstrates
that a parent’s involvement would significantly impair the child’s physical
health or emotional development, or where there is a history of family
violence, proposition, authority citation (Tex. Fam. Code § 153.131).
It is also important to note that while In the Interest of V.L.K., 24 S.W.3d 338
(Tex. 2000) was disapproved in part by In re C.J.C., 603 S.W.3d 804 (Tex.
2020) for failing to fully recognize the constitutional fit-parent presumption,
the core principles regarding the best-interest standard and the importance
of stability remain authoritative.
Conclusion
Texas law is unequivocal in requiring that the best interest of the child be
the primary consideration in all conservatorship and possession matters.
Conduct that creates instability, seeks to deny access without credible
evidence, or relies on inflammatory rhetoric rather than substantiated facts

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
is contrary to both statutory mandates and judicial precedent. Litigation
strategies that disrupt the parent-child relationship or prioritize personal
advantage over the child’s stability and well-being are legally disfavored and
may be sanctioned or rejected by Texas courts. The law expects parents and
their counsel to act in a manner that promotes stability, encourages positive
relationships with both parents, and bases all claims and requests on
credible, substantiated evidence.
Legal Authorities
In the Interest of Christopher Walters, 39 S.W.3d 280 (Tex. App. 2001)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The best interest of the child is the primary consideration in determining
conservatorship and possession of and access to the child. Tex. Fam. Code
Ann. § 153.002 (Vernon 1996)." ... "It is somewhat incongruent to find that
the best interest of the child requires restrictions on a parent’s access, but
to allow complete, unsupervised access if the other parent consents." ...
"The Texas Family Code establishes a rebuttable presumption that the
standard possession order provides reasonable minimum possession of a
child and is in the best interest of the child. Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 153.252
(Vernon 1996)." ... "By its terms, Section 153.193 allows for either a denial
of possession or a restriction or limitation on possession or access. ... It must
be remembered, however, that the best interest of the child is always the
primary consideration in determining issues of possession and access. ...
Therefore, a severe restriction or limitation, even one that amounts to a
denial of access, is permissible if it is in the best interest of the child.
Summary
Texas law makes the child’s best interest the paramount consideration in
access and conservatorship decisions (§153.002). There is a rebuttable
presumption that the standard possession order is in the child’s best interest
(§153.252), placing the burden on a party seeking deviations or severe
restrictions to provide supporting evidence and specific reasons. The opinion
criticizes arrangements that effectively deny access based on the other
parent’s unilateral consent and notes that if safety is a concern, the court
should craft specific, evidence-based safeguards (e.g., supervised access)
rather than open-ended control by one parent. The court’s discussion
underscores that restrictions—including those amounting to denial—must be
justified by best-interest evidence and structured to avoid unnecessary
disruption and future litigation. This supports an argument that attempts to
deny or severely restrict the other parent’s access without credible
evidence, or through litigation tactics prioritizing leverage over stability,
contravene the best-interest mandate and the statutory presumption of
standard possession.

Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Based on our review of the record and taking into account applicable
presumptions under the Family Code, we cannot conclude that the trial
court abused its discretion in its granted relief or in making its best interest
findings. See ... Tex. Fam. Code §§ 153.004(b) ... .131(b) ('It is a rebuttable
presumption that the appointment of the parents of a child as joint
managing conservators is in the best interest of the child.') , .134 (listing
factors to consider in determining whether appointment of parents as joint
managing conservators is in child's best interest), .252(2) ('In a suit, there is
a rebuttable presumption that the standard possession order ... is in the best
interest of the child.') , .253 (allowing court to render order that does not
follow standard possession order when it is shown that standard possession
order 'unworkable or inappropriate'); Holley v. Adams, 544 S.W.2d 367,
371-72 (Tex. 1976) (listing non-exclusive factors for making best interest
determination). ... In his tenth and eleventh issues, Caldwell argues that the
trial court abused its discretion by violating sections 153.001 and 153.193 of
the Family Code. See Tex. Fam. Code §§ 153.001 (stating that public policy
of state to 'assure that children will have frequent and continuing contact
with parents who have shown the ability to act in the best interest of the
child') , .193 ('The terms of an order that denies possession of a child to a
parent or imposes restrictions or limitations on a parent's right to
possession of or access to a child may not exceed those that are required to
protect the best interest of the child.'). For the reasons stated above as to
Caldwell's sixth issue in which he challenges the trial court's best interest
findings, we overrule his tenth and eleventh issues.
Summary
The passage reinforces that Texas law centers best interest in
conservatorship/possession decisions, presumes joint managing
conservatorship and standard possession, and restricts limitations on access
to what is necessary for protection. This supports arguments that attempts
to curtail access without credible evidence, or strategies prioritizing
advantage over stability, contravene these principles. It also ties into §
153.002 via the best-interest framework and Holley factors.

the child.' Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 153.002. ... An order restricting a parent's
right to possession of or access to a child may not impose restrictions
beyond those required to protect the child's best interest. See Tex. Fam.
Code Ann. § 153.193. A trial court does not abuse its discretion in restricting
a parent's possession when the record contains some evidence to support a
finding that such restrictions are in the child's best interest. ... Here, we
conclude there was legally- and factually-sufficient evidence of a material
and substantial change in circumstances and that the almost eleven-year-old
standard possession order was not in the children's best interest. Based on
the above standards, the trial court reasonably could have concluded that
deviating from a standard possession order and setting up Father's visitation
at times mutually agreed in advance by the parties was a minimal restriction
necessary to protect the children's best interest. ... Mother was receptive to
and encouraged the children's relationship with Father's parents.
Summary
The court reaffirms § 153.002’s primacy of best interest in all
conservatorship/access decisions. It emphasizes that restrictions on a
parent's access must not exceed what is necessary to protect the child (§
153.193) and must be supported by some evidence. The court also notes
deviation from the standard possession order is permissible when supported
by best-interest factors (§§ 153.252-.256). The opinion highlights a parent
(Mother) facilitating relationships rather than obstructing access,
underscoring the legal expectation that parents support the child’s
relationship with the other parent/extended family. These principles support
arguments that litigation or conduct that seeks to deny access without
evidentiary support, or that injects instability and inflammatory allegations,
contravenes the statutory best-interest mandate and is disfavored.

Similarly, a course of conduct pursued by the manager which hampers the
ward's opportunities to favorably associate with the other parent may also
suffice. E.g., Guy v. Stubberfield, 666 S.W.2d 176, 179 (Tex.App.--Dallas
1983, no writ) (parent refusing to abide by a custody arrangement
previously agreed to); Gunther v. Gunther, 478 S.W.2d 821, 829-30

parents'); McLeod v. McLeod, 9 S.W.2d 141, 142 (Tex.Civ.App.--Eastland
1927, no writ) (denial by parent of child's access to other parent). ... To
unjustifiably interfere with the parent/child relationship is reprehensible
under the law, especially when motivated by the angst and pain inherent in a
divorce.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
The court emphasizes best-interest principles and recognizes that conduct
that inhibits a child’s ability to know and be with both parents—including
refusing to abide by custody arrangements or denying access—can justify
modification. The opinion condemns unjustified interference with the parent-
child relationship as legally reprehensible. This aligns with the proposition
that attempts to deny access without credible danger and reliance on
inflammatory, unsubstantiated claims run contrary to the child’s best
interests and stability under Texas law.

Extract
Included among these are the following: (A) the desires of the child; (B) the
emotional and physical needs of the child now and in the future; (C) the
emotional and physical danger to the child now and in the future; (D) the
parental abilities of the individuals seeking custody; (E) the programs
available to assist these individuals to promote the best interest of the child;
(F) the plans for the child by these individuals or by the agency seeking
custody; (G) the stability of the home or proposed placement; (H) the acts or
omissions of the parent which may indicate that the existing parent-child
relationship is not a proper one; and (I) any excuse for the acts or omissions
of the parent. This listing is by no means exhaustive, but does indicate a
number of considerations which either have been or would appear to be
pertinent.
Summary
The passage articulates core best-interest factors, including stability of the
home, emotional/physical needs and dangers, and parental acts or omissions
affecting the propriety of the parent-child relationship. These directly
support arguments that conduct causing instability, unsupported allegations
of danger, and rhetoric over facts are contrary to the child’s best interest.
While Holley is a termination case, its factors are broadly applied to best-
interest analyses across custody matters, aligning with Texas Family Code §
153.002’s mandate.

In determining issues of conservatorship and possession and access, the
primary consideration is always the best interest of the children. See Tex.
Fam. Code Ann. § 153.002 (West 2014) ; Lenz v. Lenz, 79 S.W.3d 10, 14 (Tex.
2002)." ... "Texas courts are to look to the following non-exhaustive list of
factors to determine the children’s best interests: (1) the desires of the
children; (2) the emotional and physical needs of the children now and in the
future; (3) the emotional and physical danger to the children now and in the
future; (4) the parental abilities of the individuals seeking custody; (5) the
programs available to assist these individuals to promote the best interest of
the children; (6) the plans for the children by the individuals seeking
custody; (7) the stability of the home; (8) the acts or omissions of the parent
that may indicate that the existing parent-child relationship is not proper;
and (9) any excuse for the acts or omissions of the parent." ... "The record
does not support the trial court’s implicit finding that this denial of all
access did not exceed what was required to protect the children’s best
interests. See Tex. Fam. Code § 153.193. Accordingly, we sustain Mother’s
third issue to the extent she challenges the trial court’s denying Mother all
possession of and access to the children.
Summary
The case reiterates that best interest under § 153.002 controls
conservatorship and access decisions and lists the Holley-type factors
focusing on stability, parental conduct, and danger. It also holds that
denying all access must be supported by evidence and limited to what is
necessary to protect the child (§ 153.193). This supports arguments against
litigation or relief that disrupts a parent-child relationship without
substantiated danger, and underscores that strategies causing instability
and seeking extreme restrictions absent sufficient evidence contravene the
best-interest mandate.

Because a trial court has broad discretion to decide the best interest of a
child in family law matters such as custody, visitation, and possession, we
review a decision to modify conservatorship for a clear abuse of that
discretion." ... "In an effort to ensure stability and continuity for children,
Texas law has imposed 'significant hurdles' before a conservatorship order
may be modified." ... "The public policy of Texas is to ensure that children
enjoy 'frequent and continuing contact with parents who have shown the
ability to act' in their child's best interest." ... "However, trial courts are
permitted to place conditions on a parent's visitation if necessary for the
child's best interest." ... "A trial court may not give one parent the unbridled
discretion, unenforceable by contempt, to decide whether the other parent

=== PAGE 12 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
may have access to, or possession of, her children. ... Thus, when a court
places restrictions or conditions on a conservator's possession rights, the
court must specifically define those terms in its decree.
Summary
The passages (1) reaffirm that best interest governs conservatorship/
possession decisions; (2) emphasize stability and continuity for children,
discouraging actions that create instability; (3) state Texas public policy
favoring frequent and continuing contact with fit parents, undermining
attempts to deny access absent necessity; and (4) prohibit giving one parent
unilateral power to deny the other parent access, supporting arguments
against litigation strategies or rhetoric aimed at obstructing contact without
substantiated danger. Together, these authorities support criticizing conduct
that disrupts the father–child relationship and prioritizes tactical advantage
over the children’s stability and best interests under § 153.002.

Texas jurisprudence underscores this fundamental right, and we too
recognize that it gives rise to a 'legal presumption' that it is in a child's best
interest to be raised by his or her parents. Although the best interest of the
child is the paramount issue in a custody determination, '[t]he presumption
is that the best interest of the children' is served 'by awarding them' to a
parent. Thus, the fit-parent presumption is 'deeply embedded in Texas law'
as part of the determination of a child's best interest." ... "The government
may not 'infringe on the fundamental right of parents to make child rearing
decisions simply because a state judge believes a ‘better decision’ could be
made.'" ... "The Court thus correctly concludes that a best-interest
determination in any proceeding involving a nonparent's request for
conservatorship or possession, over the objection of a child's fit parent, must
accord that parent the presumption that he is acting in the child's best
interest so long as that presumption has not previously been overcome." ...
"[U]nless the court finds that appointment of the parent or parents would
not be in the best interest of the child because the appointment would
significantly impair the child's physical health or emotional development, a
parent shall be appointed sole managing conservator or both parents shall
be appointed as joint managing conservators of the child.
Summary
Texas law embeds a fit-parent presumption and prioritizes a child’s best
interest, presuming stability with parents. Courts cannot undermine a fit
parent’s decisions without proof of significant impairment or overcoming the
presumption. Allegations or strategies that disrupt a child’s relationship
with a fit parent without credible evidence conflict with these principles.

Thus, conduct that denies access or leverages inflammatory, unsupported
claims runs contrary to the statutory and constitutional framework
protecting children’s stability and a fit parent’s role.
Thornton v. Cash, NO. 14-11-01092-CV (Tex. App. Apr 18, 2013)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
In child custody cases, the primary consideration of any court is the best
interest of the child. See Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 153.002 (West 2008). It is
this overarching consideration that distinguishes the present case from
those cited by Cash in her motion to dismiss." ... "The presumption that the
best interest of the child is served by awarding custody to the parent is
deeply embedded in Texas law. In re V.L.K., 24 S.W.3d 338, 341 (Tex. 2000).
The parental presumption, codified in Chapter 153 of the Family Code,
provides that the trial court must appoint a parent as sole managing
conservator or both parents as joint managing conservators unless that
appointment would not be in the best interest of the child because it would
significantly impair the child's physical health or emotional development.
See Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 153.131(a) (West 2008)." ... "Varney testified that
he now sees both of his children less than he has ever seen them before...
not only his efforts to work more... but also the amount of time M.V. spends
with the Thorntons. Varney testified that he did not believe he would be able
to have a full relationship with M.V. if the Thorntons' possession periods
remained unchanged." ... "Finally, the Thorntons address the best interest of
M.V. We conclude that the trial court had sufficient evidence to support its
decision to change the Thorntons' status from joint managing conservators
to possessory conservators... 'it is not in the best interest of the child [M.V.],
or the child [M.H.V.], that the children continue to be separated...' ... 'These
findings were supported by the Thorntons own testimony that they were not
interested in M.H.V., as well as both Cash and Varney's testimony that both
M.V. and M.H.V. were being negatively affected by M.V.'s time with the
Thorntons.'
Summary
Texas courts must prioritize the child’s best interest in conservatorship/
possession decisions (§ 153.002) and there is a strong parental presumption
favoring parents over third parties unless significant impairment is shown.
The opinion recognizes harm where litigation/possession arrangements
reduced the father’s time and impaired his relationship with the child, and
where separating siblings negatively affected both children—prompting the
court to limit third-party control to protect stability and parent-child
relationships. This supports arguments that strategies or allegations that
disrupt the child’s relationship with a parent and create instability
contravene the best-interest mandate.

03-07-00099-CV. (Tex. App. Mar 13, 2009)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
As mentioned previously, section 153.131 of the family code establishes a
presumption in favor of the appointment of a parent as a managing
conservator. Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 153.131; see also id. § 153.002 (West
2008) (explaining that 'best interest of the child shall always be the primary
consideration... in determining the issues of conservatorship'). ... In general,
there is a presumption that courts should order the standard possession
schedule found in the family code, Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 153.252 (West
2008), but if a court determines that issuing a standard possession order
would not be in the child's best interests, the court may restrict possession
or access in order to eliminate any potential danger to the child or may
completely deny possession and access, In re Walters, 39 S.W.3d at 286. ...
Further, we note that the best interest of the child is the paramount
consideration to be employed in all issues relating to 'possession of and
access to' a child, see Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 153.002 (West 2008), and that
courts are given broad discretion to determine what is in a child's best
interests, In re Herd, 537 S.W.2d 950, 952 (Tex. Civ. App.-Amarillo 1976,
writ ref'd n.r.e.), including the ability to craft orders that are dictated by the
facts presented during trial, see White v. Adcock, 666 S.W.2d 222, 225 (Tex.
App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 1984, no writ).
Summary
The case reiterates that § 153.002 makes the child’s best interest the
paramount consideration for conservatorship and possession, with
presumptions favoring parental conservatorship and standard possession (§§
153.131, 153.252). Courts may restrict or deny access only to eliminate
danger and must base deviations on facts proven at trial, not rhetoric. This
supports arguing that attempts to deny a parent access without credible
evidence of danger, or litigation strategies not grounded in substantiated
facts, contravene the statutory best-interest mandate and disrupt stability
and parent-child relationships.

The Family Code's statutory scheme focuses on the children's welfare and
best interest. TEX. FAM.CODE ANN. § 153.002 (Vernon 2005); See Lenz v.
Lenz, 79 S.W.3d 10, 14 (Tex.2002) (reiterating legislature's mandate that
best interest of child is primary consideration). Courts have generally
considered nine non-exclusive factors set out in Holley v. Adams in

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
determining the best interest of the child. 544 S.W.2d 367 (Tex.1976). ...
Texas provides that '[t]he best interest of the child shall always be the
primary consideration of the court in determining the issues of
conservatorship and possession and access to the child.' Id. § 153.002
(Vernon 2002); Lenz v. Lenz, 79 S.W.3d 10, 14 (Tex.2002) (reiterating
legislature's mandate that best interest of child is primary consideration); In
re C.Q.T.M., 25 S.W.3d 730, 734 (Tex.App.-Waco 2000, pet. denied); Long,
144 S.W.3d at 68; In re Marriage of Bertram, 981 S.W.2d at 822 ('court's
primary consideration in determining conservatorship, possession, and
access is the best interest of the child'). ... Moreover, this multi-year
litigation, plus Brist's past history of failure to support C.A.B. and to provide
health care for him, his conviction for criminal contempt, and his current
precarious financial situation in attempting to care for 4 children on a
reduced income all evince an unstable environment for C.A.B. in general and
with respect to litigation and the expenses of litigation and augur future
instability and future litigation. Not only was there no evidence at trial from
which the trial court could reasonably have drawn the inference that
modification would achieve greater stability for C.A.B. (modification factors
(G) and (J)) or would prevent litigation (modification factor (K)), all the
evidence was to the contrary.
Summary
The passages confirm that § 153.002 makes the child’s best interest the
primary consideration in conservatorship and access decisions, and they
recognize stability and litigation-induced instability as key considerations.
The court criticizes modification efforts lacking evidentiary support that
would improve stability and notes that prolonged litigation and unsupported
inferences can create or predict instability. This supports arguing that
litigation tactics prioritizing advantage over stability, and unsupported
allegations disrupting parent-child relationships, contravene the statutory
best-interest mandate.
In re Z.G., No. 02-19-00352-CV (Tex. App. Apr 01, 2021)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
A child's best interest must always be the court's primary consideration in
determining the issues of a parent's possession and access. See id. §
153.002; see also Holley v. Adams, 544 S.W.2d 367, 371-72 (Tex. 1976).
Indeed, the state's public policy is to assure that a child will have frequent
and continuing contact with parents who have shown the ability to act in his
best interest and to provide a safe, stable, and nonviolent environment for
him. Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 153.001(a). Accordingly, the court may limit the
rights and duties of a parent appointed as a conservator upon a written
finding that such a limitation is in the child's best interest. Id. § 153.072. But
an order that imposes restrictions or limitations on a parent's right to
possession of or access to his or her child 'may not exceed those that are

=== PAGE 16 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
required to protect the best interests of the child.' Id. § 153.193. ... While
Section 153.193 does not envision a complete denial of access—which is not
the case here—even a severe restriction or limitation is permissible if it is in
the child's best interest because the child's best interest 'is the primary
consideration in determining issues of possession and access.'
Summary
The passages reaffirm that (1) best interest under § 153.002 is the primary
consideration; (2) public policy under § 153.001 favors frequent and
continuing contact with fit parents to ensure stability; (3) any restriction on
access must be narrowly tailored to what is required to protect best
interests (§ 153.193); and (4) courts may limit parental rights only upon
written best-interest findings (§ 153.072). These principles support
arguments against litigation or conduct that seeks to deny or severely
restrict access absent substantiated safety concerns, and they underscore
that strategies disrupting the parent-child relationship and stability
contravene Texas policy and the best-interest mandate.
In re Interest of B.O., NO. 02-16-00485-CV (Tex. App. Jun 15, 2017)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
When a trial court determines issues related to conservatorship and
possession of and access to a child, its primary consideration must be the
child's best interest. Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 153.002 (West 2014); see id. §
153.001(a)(1) (stating that Texas's public policy is to assure that children
will have frequent and continuing contact with parents 'who have shown the
ability to act in the best interest of the child'). ... Further, in suits affecting
the parent-child relationship, there is a rebuttable presumption that a
standard possession order, as outlined in the statute, is in the best interest
of the child, but a court may deviate from the terms of the standard order if
those terms would be unworkable or inappropriate and against the child's
best interest. See Tex. Fam. Code Ann. §§ 153.252-.253 (West 2014). The
terms of an order that denies possession of a child to a parent or imposes
restrictions or limitations on a parent's right to possession of or access to a
child may not exceed those that are required to protect the best interest of
the child. Id. § 153.193 (West 2014).
Summary
The court reiterates that best interest under § 153.002 is paramount; Texas
policy favors frequent and continuing contact with fit parents; there is a
presumption favoring standard possession; and any denial or restriction of
access must be narrowly tailored and no more than necessary to protect the
child’s best interest (§ 153.193). These authorities support arguments
against litigation tactics or allegations that seek to curtail a parent’s access
without credible evidence, and they emphasize that actions undermining

interest mandate.
Zachery v. Zachery, 04-24-00531-CV (Tex. App. Aug 20, 2025)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The best interests of the children is the primary consideration in
determining conservatorship, possession, and access. Tex. Fam. Code §§
153.002, 153.134; see Lenz v. Lenz, 79 S.W.3d 10, 14 (Tex. 2002). In
determining best interests, the trial court should utilize the Holley factors as
set forth in Holley v. Adams. 544 S.W.2d 367, 371-72 (Tex. 1976). These
factors include (a) the desires of the children; (b) the emotional and physical
needs of the children now and in the future; (c) the emotional and physical
danger to the children now and in the future; (d) the parental abilities of the
individuals seeking custody; (e) the programs available to assist these
individuals to promote the best interest of the children; (f) the plans for the
children by these individuals; (g) the stability of the home; (h) the acts or
omissions of the parent which may indicate that the existing parent-child
relationship is not a proper one; and (i) any excuse for the acts or omissions
of the parent. Id.
Summary
The passage confirms that best interest is the primary consideration under §
153.002 and that courts evaluate best interest using Holley factors,
including stability of the home and parental acts/omissions indicating the
relationship is improper, as well as danger considerations. These factors
directly bear on conduct that creates instability, unjustified denial of access,
and unsupported allegations disrupting a parent-child relationship. Thus,
the passage supplies the legal framework to argue that litigation tactics and
inflammatory, unsubstantiated accusations that impair stability and access
contravene the children’s best interests.

the desires of the child; (2) the emotional and physical needs of the child

placement; (8) the acts or omissions of the parent which may indicate that
the existing parent-child relationship is not a proper one; and (9) any excuse
for the acts or omissions of the parent. Id. Proof of best interest is not
limited to these factors, nor do all factors always apply in every case.
Summary
The passages reaffirm that best interest under § 153.002 is the controlling
consideration for conservatorship and possession, and enumerate Holley
factors including stability of the home and acts/omissions of a parent
affecting the parent-child relationship. These principles support arguing that
litigation tactics or unsupported allegations that disrupt a child’s
relationship with a parent, create instability, or are not grounded in credible
danger contravene the best-interest mandate. While the case’s facts concern
appointing a possessory conservator, the legal standards apply broadly to
conduct affecting stability and parent-child relationships.

Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Father referenced false reports made by Mother to the Department of Child
Protective Services (CPS) accusing him of sexually abusing the children." ...
"In determining issues of conservatorship and possession and access, the
primary consideration is always the best interest of the children. See id. §
153.002" ... "There was evidence that Mother previously abducted the
children, was a potential risk of international abduction, made false
allegations that Father sexually abused the children, attempted to interfere
with Father’s employment, did not have a stable home, and could not
lawfully reenter the United States before the children turned eighteen.
Summary
The court reaffirmed that § 153.002 makes the child’s best interest the
primary consideration. The opinion identifies conduct by Mother—false CPS
sexual abuse allegations, prior abduction, instability, interference with
Father’s employment—that undermines stability and the parent-child
relationship, supporting modification. Such conduct aligns with the
proposition’s assertion that using unsupported, inflammatory accusations to
restrict the other parent’s access is contrary to the children’s best interests.
The appellate court treated those actions as rebutting the joint-managing-

appointing a parent as managing conservator... [but] may be rebutted by
showing that such an appointment would... 'significantly impair the child's
physical health or emotional development.' Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 153.131...
Other considerations may include parental irresponsibility... frequent moves,
bad judgment... and an unstable, disorganized, chaotic lifestyle that has and
will continue to put the child at risk.
Summary
The passage confirms § 153.002’s primacy of best interest and public policy
favoring frequent and continuing contact with both parents, undermining
unilateral attempts to deny access without evidence of danger. It emphasizes
that decisions must be grounded in supporting evidence and that instability,
bad judgment, and acts/omissions harming the parent-child relationship are
material to best-interest analysis. The Holley factors and references to
stability and acts/omissions align with arguments that inflammatory,
unsupported allegations and litigation tactics disrupting the father-child
relationship contravene the child’s best interests.

Summary
The opinion reiterates that the best interest of the child is the primary
consideration in conservatorship and possession (Tex. Fam. Code § 153.002)
and emphasizes state policy to assure frequent and continuing contact with
parents and to provide stability (§ 153.001). These principles support
arguments that litigation tactics or unsupported allegations that undermine
a child’s stability or interfere with a child’s relationship with a parent run
counter to Texas public policy and the statutory best-interest mandate.
While the passage does not address “inflammatory rhetoric” specifically, it
grounds the proposition that courts should reject strategies that disrupt

The passages establish that stability and permanence are paramount and
that conduct causing uncertainty/endangering well-being weighs against a
parent in best-interest determinations. They also require more than
speculative allegations to justify restricting a parent-child relationship.

Summary
Texas Family Code § 153.002 makes the child’s best interest the primary
consideration in conservatorship and access decisions. Courts must evaluate
best interest using Holley factors, including stability of the home, danger to
the child, and parental acts or omissions undermining a proper parent-child
relationship. These principles support arguments that litigation tactics or
unsupported allegations that destabilize the children or disrupt the father-
child relationship contravene the statutory best-interest mandate and weigh
against a party engaging in such conduct.
In re R.P.

Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Mom argues that the trial court abused its discretion by not appointing her
as a conservator or granting her access to R.P. In support of her argument,
she cites Texas Family Code sections 153.193 (requiring minimal restrictions
on a parent's possession or access) and 153.002 (requiring the best interest
of the child to be the primary consideration in conservatorship, possession,
and access determinations). ... We recognize that '[t]he best interest of the
child shall always be the primary consideration of the court in determining
the issues of conservatorship and possession of and access to the child.' Tex.
Fam. Code Ann. § 153.002... We conclude that the trial court abused its
discretion in denying Mom conservatorship and access to R.P. when the
Department offered no current evidence of specific actions or omissions by
Mom demonstrating that awarding custody to her would result in physical or
emotional harm to R.P.
Summary
The case reaffirms that best interest under § 153.002 governs
conservatorship and access; restrictions require substantiated evidence of
harm. It criticizes decisions restricting a parent’s access absent “current
evidence of specific actions or omissions” showing risk of physical or
emotional harm. This supports arguing that attempts to curtail the other
parent’s access without credible evidence contravene the best-interest
mandate and create instability, aligning with the proposition that
unsupported, inflammatory litigation tactics disregard children’s best
interests.

the best interest of the child.' Tex. Fam. Code § 153.002. ... Chapter 153 and
Chapter 156 are distinct statutory schemes that involve different issues.
Chapter 156 modification suits raise additional policy concerns such as
stability for the child and the need to prevent constant litigation in child
custody cases.
Summary
The Texas Supreme Court reiterates that § 153.002 makes the child’s best
interest the primary consideration in any conservatorship case. The Court
also emphasizes that modification proceedings implicate the child’s stability
and the need to prevent constant litigation. These principles support

arguments that litigation tactics causing instability, unnecessary conflict, or
interference with a parent-child relationship—without credible evidentiary
basis—are contrary to the statutory mandate prioritizing best interests and
stability.
In re B.B.M., 291 S.W.3d 463 (Tex. App. 2009)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The evidence cannot merely raise a suspicion or speculation of possible
harm. ... Instead, the evidence must support the logical inference that some
specific, identifiable behavior or conduct of the parent will probably harm
the child." ... "Certain past acts or omissions such as physical abuse, severe
neglect, abandonment, drug or alcohol abuse, or immoral behavior may
indicate a threat of future harm to a child." ... "Parental rights are not
absolute, and the physical and emotional well-being of the child must not be
sacrificed to preserve those rights.
Summary
The court emphasizes that restricting a parent’s role requires more than
speculative claims; there must be specific, identifiable conduct likely to
harm the child. Mere assertions that another custodian would be better are
inadequate. The opinion reinforces that while parents’ rights are important,
they yield to the child’s physical and emotional well-being. These principles
support arguments that attempts to deny a parent access without credible,
specific evidence of danger are inconsistent with Texas law and the child’s
best interest.
In the Interest of C.Q.T.M., 25 S.W.3d 730 (Tex. App. 2000)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Texas courts uniformly recognize that the parental abilities of the parent
seeking custody and the stability of her home are factors to be considered in
determining what is in the best interest of the child. ... Accordingly, evidence
regarding the conduct and abilities of a step-parent can be relevant and
admissible in a suit seeking modification of conservatorship. ... Because the
evidence in question is relevant to these issues, we believe the general rule
prohibiting the admission of res inter alios acts must bow in suits affecting
the parent-child relationship, particularly insofar as the best interest of the
child is at stake. See Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 153.002. ... Because the best
interest of the child must be the court's primary consideration, Rule 403 'is
an extraordinary remedy that must be used sparingly.' ... Nevertheless, the

=== PAGE 25 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
legislative mandate is clear that '[t]he best interest of the child shall always
be the primary consideration of the court.'
Summary
The case reaffirms that the best interest of the child under § 153.002 is the
primary consideration in conservatorship matters. Courts assess parental
abilities and stability, and they permit relevant evidence—even over typical
exclusionary rules and Rule 403 concerns—when evaluating best interest.
This supports arguments that litigation tactics or unsupported allegations
that harm stability or disrupt a parent-child relationship run counter to the
statutory mandate. The opinion’s emphasis on stability and admissibility of
conduct evidence (including of a new spouse) allows introduction of proof
that a parent’s destabilizing conduct and rhetoric undermine best interests.
Gunther v. Gunther, 478 S.W.2d 821 (Tex. Ct. App. 1972)
Texas Civil Court of Appeals
Extract
A habeas corpus suit of this kind is in reality a civil suit involving custody
with the parents as adverse parties, and the powers of the court to
adjudicate custody and visitation are automatically invoked. ... And we
recognize the respected rule that in this type of case the trial court's
judgment in determining the best interests of the children and in awarding
their custody and visitation in accordance with such determination should
be reversed only when it appears from the record as a whole that the trial
court has erred and abused its discretion under the circumstances. ... For
the welfare of the children, it is certainly necessary that children know, love,
and be with each of their parents. ... We hold that the deliberate secreting of
the children by the father from the mother for the length of time here
involved warrants the trial court's actions in changing custody, care and
control to the mother, with visitation at reasonable times and places by
appellant, Harry Gunther.
Summary
The case confirms that custody/visitation determinations center on the
children’s best interests and that courts may modify custody when a parent
engages in conduct that undermines the child’s relationship with the other
parent (e.g., deliberate secreting/denial of access). The statement that
children should know, love, and be with each parent supports condemning
litigation or conduct that disrupts that relationship absent substantiated
danger. This aligns with Texas Family Code § 153.002’s best-interest
mandate and supports characterizing actions that deny access and create
instability as contrary to the children’s best interests.

In the Interest of M.E.-M.N., Minor Child., 342 S.W.3d 254 (Tex. App. 2011)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
“While parental rights are of constitutional magnitude, they are not
absolute. Just as it is imperative for courts to recognize the constitutional
underpinnings of the parent-child relationship, it is also essential that
emotional and physical interests of the child not be sacrificed merely to
preserve that right.” In re C.H., 89 S.W.3d 17, 26 (Tex.2002). ... Stability and
permanence are paramount in the upbringing of children.
Summary
The quoted language establishes that (1) children’s emotional and physical
interests control over parental prerogatives when in tension, and (2)
stability and permanence are paramount. These principles support
arguments that litigation conduct undermining stability and the parent-child
relationship—without credible evidentiary basis—disregards the child’s best
interests as required by Texas law, including § 153.002 in conservatorship
contexts.

The Legislature has made clear that '[t]he best interest of the child shall
always be the primary consideration of the court in determining the issues
of conservatorship and possession of and access to the child.' TEX.
FAM.CODE § 153.002... Family Code § 153.001 outlines this framework by
pronouncing our public policy for all suits affecting the parent-child
relationship: (a) The public policy of this state is to: (1) assure that children
will have frequent and continuing contact with parents who have shown the
ability to act in the best interest of the child; ... The factors highlighted by
those courts thus may assist us in giving meaning to our best-interest

best interest of the child and to provide a safe, stable, and nonviolent
environment for the child. See id. § 153.001(a).
Summary
The passages reaffirm that best interest under § 153.002 governs
conservatorship and access, and that Texas public policy prioritizes frequent
and continuing contact with fit parents and a safe, stable environment (§

Summary
The cited language establishes that parental conduct creating uncertainty
and instability is detrimental to a child’s physical and emotional well-being.
This supports arguments that litigation tactics or unsupported allegations
that disrupt a parent-child relationship and create instability run contrary to
the child’s best interests under Texas Family Code § 153.002.
Tex. Fam. Code § 153.002 Tex. Fam. Code § 153.002 Best Interest of Child;
Rebuttable Presumption In Suit Between Parent and Nonparent
Extract
The best interest of the child shall always be the primary consideration of
the court in determining the issues of conservatorship and possession of and
access to the child.
Summary
Section 153.002(a) mandates that courts must prioritize the child’s best
interest in all conservatorship and possession/access determinations. Thus,
conduct and litigation strategies that create instability, attempt to deny
access without credible evidence, or rest on inflammatory rhetoric rather
than facts can be framed as contrary to the statutory mandate because they
do not further the child’s best interests. The passage supplies the governing
legal standard to argue that actions undermining stability and parent-child
relationships are legally disfavored and should be sanctioned or rejected.

Tex. Fam. Code § 153.134 Tex. Fam. Code § 153.134 Court-Ordered Joint
Conservatorship
Extract
the court may render an order appointing the parents joint managing
conservators only if the appointment is in the best interest of the child,
considering the following factors: ... the ability of the parents to give first
priority to the welfare of the child and reach shared decisions in the child's
best interest; whether each parent can encourage and accept a positive
relationship between the child and the other parent; ... include provisions to
minimize disruption of the child's education, daily routine, and association
with friends;
Summary
Section 153.134 requires courts to prioritize the child’s best interest and
consider whether each parent can put the child’s welfare first, encourage a
positive relationship with the other parent, and minimize disruptions to the
child’s routine. Attempts to deny access without credible danger,
inflammatory rhetoric, and litigation strategies that undermine the child’s
relationship with the other parent conflict with these statutory factors and
demonstrate disregard for the child’s best interests.
Tex. Fam. Code § 153.193 Tex. Fam. Code § 153.193 Minimal Restriction On
Parent's Possession Or Access
Extract
The terms of an order that denies possession of a child to a parent or
imposes restrictions or limitations on a parent's right to possession of or
access to a child may not exceed those that are required to protect the best
interest of the child.
Summary
Section 153.193 limits any denial or restriction of a parent’s possession or
access to what is necessary to protect the child’s best interest. If a party
advances restrictions or denials without credible evidence of danger, those
efforts exceed what is required to protect the child’s best interest,
contravene the statutory standard, and tend to create instability by
disrupting the parent-child relationship. This aligns with the broader best-
interest mandate (in § 153.002) by reinforcing that litigation strategies or
allegations that seek greater-than-necessary restrictions are inconsistent
with the child’s best interests.
Tex. Fam. Code § 107.109 Tex. Fam. Code § 107.109 Elements of Child
Custody Evaluation

=== PAGE 29 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
A child custody evaluator may not offer an opinion regarding
conservatorship of a child who is the subject of a suit or possession of or
access to the child unless each basic element of a child custody evaluation
as specified in this section and each additional element ordered by the
court, if any, has been completed, unless the failure to complete an element
is satisfactorily explained..." ... "The basic elements of a child custody
evaluation under this subchapter consist of: a personal interview of each
party... interviews... of each child... observation of each child... the obtaining
of information from relevant collateral sources, including the review of: (A)
relevant school records; (B) relevant physical and mental health records...
(C) relevant records of the department... (D) criminal history information...
and (E) ... information from any other collateral source that may have
relevant information; ... assessment of the relationship between each child...
and each party seeking possession of or access..." ... "The court may order
additional elements... including... balanced interviews and observations of
each child... psychometric testing... [and] the review of any other
information that the court determines is relevant.
Summary
Section 107.109 mandates that any custody opinion supporting restrictions
on possession/access must be grounded in a completed, methodologically
sound evaluation, including interviews, observations, collateral records, and
assessment of the parent–child relationship. It prohibits opinions without
these substantiating elements and requires disclosure and explanation of
any missing elements and their effect on confidence in conclusions. This
statutory emphasis on verified, balanced, and collateral-supported
information undermines litigation tactics that rely on unsubstantiated
allegations or inflammatory rhetoric to deny access. It aligns with §
153.002’s best-interest standard by requiring evidence-based assessments
before curtailing a parent’s access, thereby supporting the argument that
attempts to deny access without credible evidence disregard the children’s
best interests and stability.
Tex. Fam. Code § 153.001 Tex. Fam. Code § 153.001 Public Policy
Extract
The public policy of this state is to: assure that children will have frequent
and continuing contact with parents who have shown the ability to act in the
best interest of the child; provide a safe, stable, and nonviolent environment
for the child; and encourage parents to share in the rights and duties of
raising their child after the parents have separated or dissolved their
marriage.

=== PAGE 30 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
Texas public policy requires frequent and continuing contact with parents
who act in the child’s best interest, a safe and stable environment, and
shared parental rights and duties post-separation. Conduct that attempts to
deny access without credible danger, uses inflammatory rhetoric, or disrupts
the child’s relationship with a fit parent undermines these policy goals by
reducing contact, destabilizing the child’s environment, and discouraging
shared parenting.
Tex. Fam. Code § 153.131 Tex. Fam. Code § 153.131 Presumption that Parent
to Be Appointed Managing Conservator
Extract
(a) Subject to the prohibition in Section FAMILY CODE 153.004, unless the
court finds that appointment of the parent or parents would not be in the
best interest of the child because the appointment would significantly impair
the child's physical health or emotional development, a parent shall be
appointed sole managing conservator or both parents shall be appointed as
joint managing conservators of the child. (b) It is a rebuttable presumption
that the appointment of the parents of a child as joint managing
conservators is in the best interest of the child. A finding of a history of
family violence involving the parents of a child removes the presumption
under this subsection.
Summary
§ 153.131 creates a rebuttable presumption favoring joint managing
conservatorship between parents, absent findings that such appointment is
not in the child’s best interest due to significant impairment of physical
health or emotional development, or a history of family violence. Attempts to
deny a fit parent access without credible evidence of danger run counter to
this presumption and the best-interest standard embedded in § 153.131(a)-
(b). The statute thus supports arguments that litigation tactics aimed at
restricting the other parent’s role without substantiated facts are
inconsistent with Texas’s policy favoring joint conservatorship and the
child’s stability and well-being.
Coercive Control in High-Conflict Custody Litigation
Family Law Quarterly - American Bar Association - Gillian R.
Chadwick and Stef Sloan - 2023-01-01
Extract
The universal legal standard for child custody determinations is the “best
interest of the child.” ... [Best interest] factors ... includ[e] ... “the

=== PAGE 31 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
willingness and ability of each parent to respect and appreciate the bond
between the child and the other parent and to allow for a continuing
relationship between the child and the other parent.” ... Family law cases
involving evidence of abuse may be (and in fact, often are mistakenly)
labeled ‘high-conflict.’ Abuse cases may have high-conflict characteristics,
but they require a different set of considerations in order to promote safety
for the at[-risk parent and child].
Summary
The article confirms that the controlling standard is the child’s best interest
and highlights as a best-interest factor a parent’s willingness to support the
child’s relationship with the other parent. It also warns that allegations
framed as “high-conflict” without substantiated abuse evidence can distort
custody decision-making. These points support arguments that denying
access without credible danger evidence and using inflammatory rhetoric—
rather than substantiated facts—undermines the child’s stability and the
statutory best-interest mandate (consistent with Texas Fam. Code §
153.002).
Child Custody Basics In Texas
Extract
Joint managing conservatorship is presumed to be in a child's best interest.
In other words, it is the default. If there is evidence that joint managing
conservatorship is not in the child's best interest, a court can decide that
one parent should be sole managing conservator. For example, family
violence, alcohol or drug abuse, and similar issues weigh against joint
managing conservatorship. Other factors a court considers include the
child's physical, psychological, or emotional needs; the ability of the parents
to give first priority to the welfare of the child; whether parents encourage
and accept a positive relationship between the child and the other parent;
whether both parents participated in raising the child prior to the suit;
geographical proximity; and (if the child is 12 years of age or older) the
child's preference.
Summary
Texas presumes joint managing conservatorship as in the child’s best
interest. Courts assess whether each parent gives first priority to the child’s
welfare and whether each encourages and accepts a positive relationship
between the child and the other parent. Attempts to deny access without
credible danger or using inflammatory rhetoric instead of facts undermine
the best-interest standard and weigh against joint conservatorship.
Disrupting the child’s relationship with the other parent and failing to
prioritize the child’s welfare align with factors courts consider negatively.
