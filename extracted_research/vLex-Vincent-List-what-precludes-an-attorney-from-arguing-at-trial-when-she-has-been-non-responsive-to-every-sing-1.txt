Question
List what precludes an attorney from arguing at trial when she has been non
responsive to every single pleading filed, every single motion filed, her
authority is in question pursuant to rule 12, and she has fraudulently
misrepresented facts to the court in the current orders, which are signed
without the respondent's consent and the judges are aware of this. texas
rules of evidence should prevent her from showing up at trial and being able
to suddenly start advocating for her client despite her not participating in
any of the 6 appeals or providing any arguments or opposition to any relief
being sought throughout the entire case which has lasted 2 years
Answer (Texas)
Short response
An attorney in Texas may be precluded from arguing at trial if she has been
non-responsive to all pleadings and motions, her authority to represent a
party is successfully challenged under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 12, or if
she has engaged in misconduct such as fraudulent misrepresentation or
filing groundless pleadings, which can result in sanctions including
exclusion from participation. The Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, Civil
Practice and Remedies Code, and relevant case law provide mechanisms for
courts to sanction or disqualify attorneys under these circumstances.
Summary
Texas law provides several avenues by which an attorney may be barred
from participating at trial due to non-responsiveness, lack of authority, or
misconduct. If an attorney fails to respond to pleadings and motions, acts
without proper authority, or misrepresents facts to the court, the court may
impose sanctions that can include prohibiting the attorney from supporting
or opposing claims, striking pleadings, or even refusing to allow the attorney
to appear in the case.
The most direct mechanism is a challenge to the attorney’s authority under
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 12, which, if successful, requires the court to
refuse the attorney’s appearance. Additionally, if the attorney’s conduct
violates the certification requirements for pleadings and motions or involves
bad faith or fraudulent misrepresentation, the court may impose sanctions
under Rule 13 or Chapter 10 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code,
potentially precluding the attorney from advocating at trial.

Background and Relevant Law
Legislative and Regulatory Framework
1. Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 12 (Authority to Act):
Rule 12 allows any party to challenge the authority of an opposing attorney
to act in a case. Upon a sworn motion, the challenged attorney must appear
and demonstrate sufficient authority to represent the client. If the attorney
fails to do so, the court must refuse to permit the attorney to appear and
may strike the pleadings if no authorized person appears, effectively
precluding the attorney from participating at trial,
Catt v. Middleton, 698 S.W.3d 66 (Tex. App. Aug. 20, 2024).
2. Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code Chapter 10 (Sanctions for
Improper Pleadings):
Section 10.001 requires that every pleading or motion signed by an attorney
certifies that it is not for an improper purpose, is warranted by law, and has
evidentiary support. Section 10.004 authorizes courts to impose sanctions
for violations, including orders to refrain from certain acts, monetary
penalties, or payment of the opposing party’s expenses,
Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code §§ 10.001, 10.004.
3. Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 13 (Sanctions for Groundless or Bad
Faith Pleadings):
Rule 13 provides that attorneys may be sanctioned for filing pleadings that
are groundless and brought in bad faith or for harassment. Sanctions can
include any measure available under Rule 215(2)(b), such as striking
pleadings or prohibiting participation,
In re E. J. M., 01-23-00681-CV (Tex. App. Jul. 22, 2025);
Laub v. Pesikoff, 979 S.W.2d 686 (Tex. App. 1998).
4. Administrative Sanctioning Authority:
For contested cases before administrative law judges, Texas law authorizes
sanctions for groundless or bad faith filings, abuse of discovery, or failure to
obey orders. Sanctions may include refusing to allow the offending party to
support or oppose claims, excluding evidence, or striking pleadings or
testimony,
1 Tex. Admin. Code § 155.157;
Tex. Gov't. Code § 2003.0421.
5. Ethical Duties and Disciplinary Rules:
Attorneys are bound by ethical duties, including the duty of candor to the
tribunal and the prohibition against misleading the court with false
statements. Violations can result in disciplinary action and may also support
disqualification or sanctions in the underlying case,
Anderson Producing Inc. v. Koch Oil Co., 929 S.W.2d 416 (Tex. 1996);
HOW DO LAWYER DISCIPLINARY AGENCIES ENFORCE RULES AGAINST
LITIGATION MISCONDUCT? (2022).

Case Law
1. Challenge to Authority (Rule 12):
Texas courts have consistently held that if an attorney’s authority to act is
challenged under Rule 12, the attorney must prove authority to represent
the client. Failure to do so results in the court refusing to permit the
attorney to appear, and the court may strike pleadings if no authorized
person appears,
Catt v. Middleton, 698 S.W.3d 66 (Tex. App. 2024).
2. Sanctions for Misconduct (Rule 13 and Chapter 10):
Courts may impose sanctions for groundless, bad faith, or harassing
pleadings under Rule 13, and for violations of the certification requirements
under Chapter 10. Sanctions can include striking pleadings, prohibiting the
attorney from supporting or opposing claims, and other measures that can
effectively preclude the attorney from participating at trial,
In re E. J. M., 01-23-00681-CV (Tex. App. 2025);
Coyle v. Walker, 03-23-00599-CV (Tex. App. Jan. 24, 2025);
Laub v. Pesikoff, 979 S.W.2d 686 (Tex. App. 1998).
3. Ethical Violations and Disqualification:
If an attorney’s conduct violates ethical rules, such as by making false
statements to the court or acting as both advocate and witness, courts may
disqualify the attorney or impose other sanctions,
Anderson Producing Inc. v. Koch Oil Co., 929 S.W.2d 416 (Tex. 1996).
Analysis
1. Non-Responsiveness to Pleadings and Motions
An attorney’s failure to respond to pleadings and motions does not, by itself,
automatically preclude her from appearing at trial. However, persistent non-
responsiveness may be grounds for sanctions if it constitutes an abuse of the
judicial process, is done in bad faith, or is for the purpose of harassment or
delay. Under Rule 13 and Chapter 10, the court may sanction such conduct
by prohibiting the attorney from supporting or opposing claims, striking
pleadings, or excluding evidence,
In re E. J. M., 01-23-00681-CV (Tex. App. 2025);
Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code §§ 10.001, 10.004.
If the attorney’s non-responsiveness results in the failure to oppose relief
sought by the opposing party, the court may grant such relief by default or
summary judgment, further limiting the attorney’s ability to advocate at
trial.
2. Challenge to Authority Under Rule 12
If a party questions whether an attorney is authorized to represent a client,
Rule 12 provides a clear procedure. Upon a sworn motion, the attorney must
appear and demonstrate authority. If she cannot, the court must refuse to

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
permit her to appear, and if no authorized person appears, the court may
strike the pleadings. This is a direct and effective mechanism for precluding
an attorney from participating at trial when her authority is in question,
Catt v. Middleton, 698 S.W.3d 66 (Tex. App. 2024).
3. Fraudulent Misrepresentation and Bad Faith Conduct
If an attorney has fraudulently misrepresented facts to the court, this
constitutes a violation of the duty of candor and may also violate the
certification requirements for pleadings and motions. Under Rule 13 and
Chapter 10, the court may impose sanctions for such conduct, including
striking pleadings, prohibiting the attorney from supporting or opposing
claims, or excluding evidence. These sanctions can effectively prevent the
attorney from advocating at trial,
In re E. J. M., 01-23-00681-CV (Tex. App. 2025);
Coyle v. Walker, 03-23-00599-CV (Tex. App. 2025).
Additionally, fraudulent conduct may subject the attorney to disciplinary
proceedings and possible disqualification,
Anderson Producing Inc. v. Koch Oil Co., 929 S.W.2d 416 (Tex. 1996);
HOW DO LAWYER DISCIPLINARY AGENCIES ENFORCE RULES AGAINST
LITIGATION MISCONDUCT? (2022).
4. Orders Signed Without Consent
If orders are signed without the respondent’s consent and the court is
aware, the court may take corrective action, including vacating such orders
or imposing sanctions on the attorney responsible. The attorney’s conduct in
obtaining such orders may be grounds for sanctions or disqualification,
especially if it involves misrepresentation or lack of authority.
5. Sanctioning Authority in Administrative Proceedings
In administrative proceedings, judges have explicit authority to impose
sanctions for groundless or bad faith filings, abuse of discovery, or failure to
obey orders. Sanctions may include refusing to allow the attorney to support
or oppose claims, excluding evidence, or striking pleadings or testimony,
1 Tex. Admin. Code § 155.157;
Tex. Gov't. Code § 2003.0421.
6. Texas Rules of Evidence
While the Texas Rules of Evidence govern the admissibility of evidence, they
do not, by themselves, preclude an attorney from appearing at trial.
However, if an attorney’s conduct results in sanctions that exclude evidence
or prohibit participation, the practical effect is to prevent the attorney from
advocating at trial.

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
7. Failure to Participate in Appeals
An attorney’s failure to participate in appeals does not, by itself, preclude
her from appearing at trial in the underlying case. However, persistent non-
participation may be considered by the court in determining whether
sanctions are appropriate, especially if it reflects a pattern of bad faith or
abuse of the judicial process.
Exceptions and Caveats
Due Process: Any sanction that precludes an attorney from
participating at trial must be imposed in accordance with due process,
including notice and an opportunity to be heard.
Presumption of Good Faith: Courts generally presume that attorneys
act in good faith. The burden is on the moving party to demonstrate
bad faith, lack of authority, or misconduct sufficient to warrant
sanctions or disqualification,
Coyle v. Walker, 03-23-00599-CV (Tex. App. 2025).
Remedial Nature of Sanctions: Sanctions must be tailored to deter
the specific misconduct and should not be more severe than necessary,
Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 10.004.
Conclusion
In summary, Texas law provides multiple mechanisms for precluding an
attorney from arguing at trial when she has been non-responsive, her
authority is in question, or she has engaged in fraudulent or bad faith
conduct. The most direct methods are a successful challenge to authority
under Rule 12 and the imposition of sanctions under Rule 13 or Chapter 10
for improper pleadings or misconduct. Courts have broad discretion to
fashion appropriate sanctions, including prohibiting participation at trial,
striking pleadings, or excluding evidence. Persistent non-responsiveness,
lack of authority, and fraudulent misrepresentation are all grounds for such
sanctions, provided due process is observed. The Texas Rules of Evidence,
while not directly precluding an attorney’s appearance, work in conjunction
with these procedural and ethical rules to ensure the integrity of the judicial
process.

to sanction a party who makes statements in a pleading that they know to be
groundless or false. ... Chapter 10 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies
Code provides that the signature of an attorney or parties on a pleading or

Summary
Rule 13 and Chapter 10 provide mechanisms for sanctioning attorneys who
sign pleadings or motions that are groundless, brought in bad faith, or for
improper purposes. These rules are applicable in Texas and can be used to
preclude an attorney from arguing at trial if they have violated these
provisions.

Summary
Rule 13 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure allows a court to impose
sanctions on an attorney if they file pleadings, motions, or other papers that
are groundless and brought in bad faith or for harassment. This rule
provides a mechanism for addressing misconduct by an attorney, which
could include being non-responsive or misrepresenting facts. The sanctions
can include any appropriate measure available under Rule 215(2)(b), which
may affect the attorney's ability to argue at trial.

14-13-01125-CV, 2015 WL 971317, at *3 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.]
Feb. 26, 2015, no pet.) (mem. op.). [17, 18] Rule 12, titled 'Attorney to Show
Authority,' provides, in pertinent part: A party in a suit or proceeding
pending in a court of this state may, by sworn written motion stating that he
believes the suit or proceeding is being prosecuted or defended without
authority, cause the attorney to be cited to appear before the court and show
his authority to act …. At the hearing on the motion, the burden of proof
shall be upon the challenged attorney to show sufficient authority to
prosecute or defend the suit on behalf of the other party. Upon his failure to
show such authority, the court shall refuse to permit the attorney to appear
in the cause, and shall strike the pleadings if no person who is authorized to
prosecute or defend appears.
Summary
Under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 12, an attorney can be precluded from
arguing at trial if their authority to represent a client is successfully
challenged. The rule allows a party to file a motion requiring the attorney to
show their authority to act. If the attorney fails to demonstrate sufficient
authority, the court can refuse to permit the attorney to appear in the case
and may strike the pleadings if no authorized person appears. This is
directly relevant to the question of what precludes an attorney from arguing
at trial when their authority is in question.

Texas Supreme Court
Extract
Subject to certain exceptions, Texas Disciplinary Rule of Professional
Conduct 3.08 prohibits an attorney from representing a party in an
adjudicatory proceeding if the attorney knows or believes that he or she may
be a witness at trial. ... Moreover, any factual knowledge that the testifying
lawyer might have is highly likely to be tainted by the overall knowledge he
or she possesses about the case and by the fact that the attorney is an
advocate for his or her client, regardless of whether there is a contingency
fee. The roles of advocate and witness are inconsistent because the function

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
of an advocate is to represent vigorously the interests of the client and that
of a witness is to state facts objectively.
Summary
Texas Disciplinary Rule of Professional Conduct 3.08 can preclude an
attorney from representing a party if they are likely to be a witness at trial.
This rule highlights the conflict between the roles of advocate and witness,
which can lead to disqualification. Additionally, the passage suggests that
other rules of procedure and attorney conduct must be consulted to ensure
the process is not tainted, indicating that ethical violations such as
fraudulent misrepresentation could also lead to disqualification.

Under Chapter 10, a trial court may sanction a party or the party's attorney
who signed a pleading or motion in violation of Section 10.001, which
provides in relevant part: Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 10.001(1), (2); see
id. § 10.004(a) (authorizing court to sanction person who has signed

court's findings, we cannot conclude that the trial court failed to consider
the presumption of good faith or Coyle's burden to overcome that
presumption when it sanctioned Casey pursuant to Rule 13 and Chapter 10.
Summary
Authority of a trial court to sanction an attorney under Chapter 10 of the
Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code for signing pleadings or motions in
violation of Section 10.001. It also references Rule 13, which involves
sanctions for bad faith actions. These provisions are relevant to the question
as they provide a legal basis for precluding an attorney from arguing at trial
due to non-responsiveness, questionable authority, and fraudulent
misrepresentation.

consequences for an attorney who has been non-responsive and has
misrepresented facts, which could preclude her from effectively arguing at
trial.
Tex. Civ. Prac. and Rem. Code § 10.001 Tex. Civ. Prac. and Rem. Code §
10.001 Signing of Pleadings and Motions
Extract
The signing of a pleading or motion as required by the Texas Rules of Civil
Procedure constitutes a certificate by the signatory that to the signatory's
best knowledge, information, and belief, formed after reasonable inquiry:
the pleading or motion is not being presented for any improper purpose,
including to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in
the cost of litigation; each claim, defense, or other legal contention in the
pleading or motion is warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous
argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law or the
establishment of new law; each allegation or other factual contention in the
pleading or motion has evidentiary support or, for a specifically identified
allegation or factual contention, is likely to have evidentiary support after a
reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery; and each
denial in the pleading or motion of a factual contention is warranted on the
evidence or, for a specifically identified denial, is reasonably based on a lack
of information or belief.
Summary
The signing of pleadings and motions in Texas courts is a certification by the
attorney that the document is not for an improper purpose, is warranted by
law, has evidentiary support, and that any denials are warranted by evidence
or a reasonable lack of information. If an attorney has been non-responsive,
misrepresented facts, or acted without authority, these actions could be seen
as violations of these certifications, potentially precluding them from
effectively arguing at trial.

10.004 Violation; Sanction
Extract
A court that determines that a person has signed a pleading or motion in
violation of Section CIVIL PRACTICE AND REMEDIES CODE 10.001 may
impose a sanction on the person, a party represented by the person, or both.
The sanction must be limited to what is sufficient to deter repetition of the

=== PAGE 11 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
conduct or comparable conduct by others similarly situated. A sanction may
include any of the following: a directive to the violator to perform, or refrain
from performing, an act; an order to pay a penalty into court; and an order
to pay to the other party the amount of the reasonable expenses incurred by
the other party because of the filing of the pleading or motion, including
reasonable attorney's fees.
Summary
The court has the authority to impose sanctions on an attorney who has
violated Section 10.001 by signing a pleading or motion improperly. These
sanctions are designed to deter similar conduct in the future and can
include directives to the violator, monetary penalties, and orders to pay
reasonable expenses incurred by the other party. This suggests that if an
attorney has been non-responsive and has misrepresented facts, the court
may impose sanctions that could preclude her from effectively arguing at
trial.

Extract
A lawyer may refuse to offer evidence, other than the testimony of a
defendant in a criminal matter, that the lawyer reasonably believes is false.
Id. Comment 2 of Rule 3.3 states: This Rule sets forth the special duties of
lawyers as officers of the court to avoid conduct that undermines the
integrity of the adjudicative process. A lawyer acting as an advocate in an
adjudicative proceeding has an obligation to present the client's case with
persuasive force. Performance of that duty while maintaining confidences of
the client, however, is qualified by the advocate's duty of candor to the
tribunal. Consequently, although a lawyer in an adversary proceeding is not
required to present an impartial exposition of the law or to vouch for the
evidence submitted in a cause, the lawyer must not allow the tribunal to be
misled by false statements of law or fact or evidence that the lawyer knows
to be false. Id. at cmt. 2.
Summary
Lawyers have a duty to avoid conduct that undermines the integrity of the
adjudicative process. This includes not misleading the tribunal with false
statements of law or fact. The passage highlights the duty of candor to the
tribunal, which is relevant to the question of an attorney's conduct when
they have been non-responsive and have misrepresented facts. The passage
suggests that such conduct could preclude an attorney from effectively
arguing at trial due to the breach of ethical duties.
