Question
The mother, stepfather (Dan Branthoover), and grandparents acted in
concert to achieve a common purpose: to secure an advantage in divorce
proceedings by gaining the house and custody of the children. An
"enterprise" under RICO includes any group of individuals associated
together for a common purpose, whether formal or informal, as long as they
function as a continuing unit. (18 U.S.C. § 1961(4)). The coordinated actions
of the mother, stepfather, and grandparents to influence legal proceedings
and divest Charles of his property and custody could constitute an
association-in-fact enterprise under RICO.
Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
Based on the provided legal sources, the coordinated actions of the mother,
stepfather, and grandparents to secure an advantage in divorce proceedings
could constitute an association-in-fact enterprise under RICO if they
functioned as an ongoing organization with a common purpose. To establish
a RICO enterprise, there must be evidence of a common purpose among the
participants, relationships between them, and sufficient longevity to
accomplish their objective of influencing legal proceedings and divesting
Charles of his property and custody.
Summary
An "enterprise" under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations
Act (RICO) is broadly defined to include "any individual, partnership,
corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of
individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity" (18 U.S.C. §
1961(4)). Supreme Court precedent has established that an association-in-
fact enterprise requires evidence of a common purpose among participants,
relationships between associates, and sufficient longevity to permit these
associates to pursue the enterprise's purpose. The coordinated actions of the
mother, stepfather (Dan Branthoover), and grandparents to secure an
advantage in divorce proceedings by gaining the house and custody of
children could satisfy these criteria if they functioned as a continuing unit
with sufficient structure and organization.
To establish a RICO claim based on this enterprise theory, beyond proving
the existence of an enterprise, there would also need to be evidence of a
pattern of racketeering activity through which the enterprise conducted its
affairs. This requires showing at least two acts of racketeering within a ten-
year period that are related and continuous. If these elements can be
established, the coordinated actions of these family members could
potentially form the basis of a RICO claim, particularly if their actions were

designed to divest Charles of his property and custody rights through
improper means.
Background and Relevant Law
Legislation: RICO Statutory Framework
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) provides
the statutory framework for establishing an association-in-fact enterprise.
Under 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4), an "enterprise" is defined to include "any
individual, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, and
any union or group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal
entity." This definition is intentionally broad and encompasses both
legitimate and illegitimate organizations.
18 U.S.C. § 1962 outlines the prohibited activities under RICO, making it
unlawful for "any person through a pattern of racketeering activity or
through collection of an unlawful debt to acquire or maintain, directly or
indirectly, any interest in or control of any enterprise which is engaged in, or
the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce." Additionally,
it prohibits any person "employed by or associated with any enterprise
engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce,
to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such
enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of
unlawful debt." The statute also prohibits conspiracy to violate these
provisions.
Case Law: Defining "Enterprise" Under RICO
The Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576,
101 S.Ct. 2524, 69 L.Ed.2d 246 (1981) is seminal in defining what
constitutes an "enterprise" under RICO. In Turkette, the Court explained
that an enterprise is "an entity, for present purposes a group of persons
associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a course of
conduct." The Court further clarified that an enterprise "is proved by
evidence of an ongoing organization, formal or informal, and by evidence
that the various associates function as a continuing unit."
It is important to note that United States v. Turkette was abrogated by 
United States v. Lane, 474 U.S. 438, 106 S.Ct. 725, 88 L.Ed.2d 814 (1986).
However, the abrogation pertained to issues related to joinder of offenses
and defendants, not to Turkette's definition of "enterprise" under RICO.
Therefore, Turkette's interpretation of what constitutes an enterprise
remains valid and continues to be cited as authoritative on this specific
point.
Building upon Turkette, the Supreme Court in Boyle v. United States, 556
U.S. 938, 129 S.Ct. 2237, 173 L.Ed.2d 1265 (2009) clarified that an
association-in-fact enterprise must possess three structural features: "(1) a
purpose; (2) relationships among those associated with the enterprise; (3)
longevity sufficient to permit these associates to pursue the enterprise's

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
purpose." The Court emphasized the liberal construction of the term
"enterprise" in light of RICO's broad statement that it "includes any ... group
of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity" and the
requirement that RICO be "liberally construed to effectuate its remedial
purposes."
In U.S. v. Cauble, 706 F.2d 1322 (5th Cir. 1983), the Fifth Circuit reiterated
the Supreme Court's definition from Turkette, stating that "the existence of
an enterprise 'is proved by evidence of an ongoing organization, formal or
informal, and by evidence that the various associates function as a
continuing unit.'" This further reinforces the understanding that an
association-in-fact enterprise can be established through evidence of
coordination and continuity among its participants.
The district court in M.W. Widoff, P.C. v. Encompass Ins. Co. of America,
Case No. 10 C 8159 (N.D. Ill. Mar. 02, 2012) synthesized the requirements
for establishing an association-in-fact enterprise, noting that a plaintiff must
allege that an organization, whether formal or informal, functions as a
continuing unit. The court referenced the three structural features identified
in Boyle: purpose, relationships among associates, and sufficient longevity to
pursue the enterprise's purpose.
Similarly, in Prudential Ins. Co. of America v. US Gypsum, 711 F. Supp. 1244
(D. N.J. 1989), the court elaborated on the criteria for establishing a RICO
enterprise: "(1) there is an ongoing organization, which has a structure or
framework for making decisions and a mechanism to control the affairs of
the group on an ongoing basis; (2) that the various associates function as a
continuing unit, that is that each individual component perform a role
consistent within the organized structure, which furthers the activities of
the organization; and (3) that the enterprise is separate and distinct from
but not necessarily wholly unrelated to, the pattern of activity in which it
engages."
The district court in Allstate Ins. Co. v. AM Pugh Associates, Inc., 604 F.
Supp. 85 (M.D. Pa. 1984) noted that the majority of courts, liberally
construing the RICO statute, have found an enterprise to exist "where a
group of individuals are associated solely because they jointly commit the
predicate racketeering offenses under RICO." This interpretation suggests
that the threshold for establishing an association-in-fact enterprise may be
relatively low.
More recently, in Wacker Drive Exec. Suites, LLC v. Jones Lang LaSalle Ams.
(Ill.), LP, Case No. 18-CV-5492 (N.D. Ill. May 28, 2019), the court found
sufficient allegations of an association-in-fact enterprise where the plaintiff
alleged "regular communication and coordinated action" between the
defendants "to carry out the enterprise's...goal." This case demonstrates that
evidence of communication and coordination among participants can
support the inference of an association-in-fact enterprise.

Secondary Materials: Scholarly Interpretation of RICO
Enterprises
Secondary sources provide additional clarity on the requirements for
establishing a RICO enterprise. According to Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy
(2024), a RICO enterprise is defined as a "structured group of individuals
associated for a common purpose." This source also outlines the elements
required to establish a § 1962(c) RICO claim: an enterprise, a pattern of
racketeering activity, conduct through racketeering, and an injury to
business or property.
RICO: A Primer (2022) emphasizes that courts have interpreted the term
"enterprise" broadly to include both legitimate and illegitimate enterprises,
noting that the statutory list is "not exhaustive but merely illustrative." This
broad interpretation supports the potential application of RICO to family
members acting in concert during divorce proceedings.
Racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations (2011) explains that for
RICO purposes, an enterprise must exist independently from the
racketeering activity in which it engages, its constituents must have a
common or shared purpose, and it must have some continuity of structure or
personnel. It also notes that in Boyle v. United States, the Supreme Court
clarified that RICO association-in-fact enterprises need not have "an
ascertainable structure beyond that inherent in the pattern of racketeering
activity."
Racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations (2010) states that informal
relationships among entities may suffice to create an "associated-in-fact"
enterprise, and that such an enterprise requires a shared purpose,
continuity, and unity. According to this source, "any type of association can
satisfy the enterprise element as long as it meets this definition."
Similarly, Racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations (2000) identifies
three characteristics required for a RICO enterprise: "(1) a common or
shared purpose; (2) some continuity of structure and personnel; and (3) an
ascertainable structure distinct from that inherent in a pattern of
racketeering."
RICO - the rejection of an economic motive requirement (1995) highlights
that the Supreme Court has established that an enterprise does not require
an economic motive, which broadens the potential application of RICO to
various types of associations, including those formed for purposes related to
divorce proceedings.
Analysis: Application to the Mother,
Stepfather, and Grandparents
Establishing an Association-in-Fact Enterprise
Based on the legal framework outlined above, the coordinated actions of the
mother, stepfather (Dan Branthoover), and grandparents could constitute an

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
association-in-fact enterprise under RICO if they satisfy the criteria
established by the Supreme Court and elaborated upon by lower courts.
First, according to Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938, 129 S.Ct. 2237, 173
L.Ed.2d 1265 (2009), an association-in-fact enterprise must have a purpose.
In this case, the alleged common purpose is "to secure an advantage in
divorce proceedings by gaining the house and custody of the children." This
clear objective satisfies the purpose requirement, as it represents a shared
goal among the participants.
Second, there must be relationships among those associated with the
enterprise. The familial relationships between the mother, stepfather, and
grandparents establish a natural connection, but more importantly, their
alleged coordination to influence legal proceedings suggests a structured
relationship beyond mere family ties. As noted in Wacker Drive Exec. Suites,
LLC v. Jones Lang LaSalle Ams. (Ill.), LP, Case No. 18-CV-5492 (N.D. Ill. May
28, 2019), "regular communication and coordinated action" can support the
inference of an association-in-fact enterprise. If evidence exists of
communication and coordination among these family members regarding
strategies to gain advantages in the divorce proceedings, this would support
the relationship element.
Third, there must be longevity sufficient to permit these associates to pursue
the enterprise's purpose. Divorce proceedings often extend over a
significant period, and if the mother, stepfather, and grandparents
maintained their coordinated efforts throughout this time, this would likely
satisfy the longevity requirement. The ongoing nature of divorce
proceedings, coupled with the sustained effort to secure custody and
property rights, suggests a level of continuity that could meet this threshold.
Furthermore, according to Prudential Ins. Co. of America v. US Gypsum, 711
F. Supp. 1244 (D. N.J. 1989), a RICO enterprise requires "an ongoing
organization, which has a structure or framework for making decisions and
a mechanism to control the affairs of the group on an ongoing basis." If the
mother, stepfather, and grandparents established methods for coordinating
their actions, making decisions about strategies in the divorce proceedings,
and maintaining their collective effort over time, this would support the
finding of an enterprise structure.
It is important to note that, as clarified in Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S.
938, 129 S.Ct. 2237, 173 L.Ed.2d 1265 (2009), an association-in-fact
enterprise does not need to have "an ascertainable structure beyond that
inherent in the pattern of racketeering activity." This means that the
structure can be inferred from the pattern of activities undertaken by the
participants. If the mother, stepfather, and grandparents engaged in a
coordinated pattern of activities aimed at securing advantages in the divorce
proceedings, this pattern itself could evidence the structure necessary for
an enterprise.

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Pattern of Racketeering Activity
While the focus of the question is on whether the coordinated actions of the
family members could constitute an enterprise, it is worth noting that
establishing a RICO claim would also require evidence of a pattern of
racketeering activity. According to Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy (2024), this
requires proving "at least two acts of racketeering, as specified within the
statute, within 10 years."
RECONCEIVING COERCION-BASED CRIMINAL DEFENSES (2022) explains
that a pattern of racketeering activity requires criminal acts that "have the
same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of
commission, or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics
and are not isolated events." It also requires a "continuity" element,
"referring either to a closed period of repeated conduct, or to past conduct
that by its nature projects into the future with a threat of repetition."
Therefore, to establish a RICO claim based on the enterprise formed by the
mother, stepfather, and grandparents, there would need to be evidence of at
least two acts of racketeering activity (as defined by the statute) that are
related and continuous, and through which the enterprise conducted its
affairs. These acts would need to be among those specifically enumerated in 
18 U.S.C. § 1961(1) as "racketeering activity."
Distinctness from Pattern of Racketeering Activity
Some courts have required that a RICO enterprise be distinct from the
pattern of racketeering activity. For instance, Racketeer influenced and
corrupt organizations (2000) states that "the basic hallmark of an enterprise
for RICO purposes is that it must contain some structure distinct from the
pattern of racketeering activity that is identified in the charge."
However, as noted earlier, the Supreme Court in Boyle v. United States, 556
U.S. 938, 129 S.Ct. 2237, 173 L.Ed.2d 1265 (2009) clarified that an
association-in-fact enterprise need not have "an ascertainable structure
beyond that inherent in the pattern of racketeering activity." This suggests
that the distinctness requirement should not be interpreted too rigidly.
In the context of the mother, stepfather, and grandparents, their family
relationships and alleged coordination to influence divorce proceedings
could provide sufficient structure to distinguish the enterprise from the
specific acts of racketeering, if any such acts can be proven.
Exceptions and Caveats
Interstate Commerce Requirement
One important limitation on RICO claims is the requirement that the
enterprise be engaged in, or its activities affect, interstate or foreign
commerce. 18 U.S.C. § 1962 explicitly includes this jurisdictional element. In
a domestic dispute like a divorce proceeding, it might be challenging to

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
establish a sufficient nexus to interstate commerce. However, if the divorce
proceedings involved property in multiple states, financial transactions
across state lines, or other interstate elements, this requirement might be
satisfied.
Proving Racketeering Activity
As mentioned earlier, establishing a RICO claim requires proving a pattern
of racketeering activity, which must consist of acts specifically enumerated
in 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1). These include a variety of criminal offenses such as
mail fraud, wire fraud, and extortion, among others. In the context of
divorce proceedings, it might be challenging to establish that the actions of
the mother, stepfather, and grandparents constituted such enumerated
crimes, even if their coordinated efforts could be characterized as an
enterprise.
Standing and Injury Requirements
According to Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy (2024), "a plaintiff only has
standing to sue if they have been injured in their business or property by
conduct constituting the violation." This means that Charles would need to
show that he suffered a concrete injury to his business or property as a
result of the alleged RICO violation. While loss of property in divorce
proceedings might satisfy this requirement, the nexus between that loss and
any alleged racketeering activity would need to be established.
Conclusion
Based on the legal authorities reviewed, the coordinated actions of the
mother, stepfather (Dan Branthoover), and grandparents to secure an
advantage in divorce proceedings by gaining the house and custody of the
children could potentially constitute an association-in-fact enterprise under
RICO. This conclusion is supported by the broad definition of "enterprise"
under 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4) and the interpretations provided by Supreme
Court cases such as United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 101 S.Ct. 2524,
69 L.Ed.2d 246 (1981) and Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938, 129 S.Ct.
2237, 173 L.Ed.2d 1265 (2009).
To establish such an enterprise, there would need to be evidence of a
common purpose among the participants (which appears to be present in
the desire to secure advantages in the divorce proceedings), relationships
between the associates (which include both familial relationships and
coordination in their actions), and sufficient longevity to permit these
associates to pursue the enterprise's purpose (which may be evidenced by
ongoing efforts throughout the divorce proceedings).
However, establishing a RICO claim would require more than just proving
the existence of an enterprise. There would also need to be evidence of a
pattern of racketeering activity, consisting of at least two acts of
racketeering as defined by the statute, through which the enterprise
conducted its affairs. Additionally, the enterprise's activities would need to

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
affect interstate commerce, and Charles would need to demonstrate an
injury to his business or property resulting from the alleged RICO violation.
While the family members' coordinated actions to influence legal
proceedings and divest Charles of his property and custody could
theoretically fit within the framework of a RICO enterprise, the success of
such a claim would ultimately depend on specific facts not provided in the
question, particularly regarding the nature of the alleged racketeering
activity and its connection to interstate commerce. Nevertheless, the broad
definition of "enterprise" under RICO and the liberal construction mandated
by the statute suggest that such a theory could be viable under the right
circumstances.

reaches 'a group of persons associated together for a common purpose of
engaging in a course of conduct,' 452 U.S., at 583, 101 S.Ct. 2524, and 'is

Summary
The passage from "Boyle v. United States" clarifies that an "enterprise"
under RICO can include any group of individuals associated in fact, even if
not a legal entity. It emphasizes that such an enterprise is characterized by a
common purpose and the functioning of its members as a continuing unit.
This interpretation supports the proposition that the coordinated actions of

The term 'enterprise' is defined in 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4) as including 'any
individual, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, and
any union or group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal
entity.' ... The enterprise is an entity, for present purposes a group of
persons associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a course
of conduct. The pattern of racketeering activity is, on the other hand, a
series of criminal acts as defined by the statute. ... The former is proved by
evidence of an ongoing organization, formal or informal, and by evidence
that the various associates function as a continuing unit.
Summary
An "enterprise" can be any group of persons associated together for a
common purpose, functioning as a continuing unit. This supports the
proposition that the coordinated actions of the mother, stepfather, and
grandparents could be considered an "enterprise" under RICO if they acted
together for a common purpose, such as influencing legal proceedings to

U.S. District Court — Northern District of Illinois
Extract
WDES defines the enterprise an association-in-fact consisting of JLL and the
Unions which has a common purpose of forcing union-only labor on
commercial tenants in buildings managed by JLL. Cmplt. ¶¶ 54, 55. WDES
alleges several facts permitting a reasonable inference that JLL and the
Unions involved themselves in the affairs of the other and worked as a
distinct enterprise rather than as completely separate entities in
implementing the union only rule at JLL managed buildings. For example,
WDES alleges regular communication and coordinated action between JLL
and the Unions to carry out the enterprise's union-only goal.
Summary
The passage describes how an association-in-fact enterprise can be formed
when separate entities work together with a common purpose, involving
regular communication and coordinated actions. This aligns with the
proposition that the mother, stepfather, and grandparents could form an
association-in-fact enterprise under RICO if they acted in concert to achieve
a common purpose, such as influencing legal proceedings to gain an
advantage in divorce proceedings.

A RICO enterprise may be a legal entity or an extra-legal association in fact.
United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 583, 101, S.Ct. 2524, 69 L.Ed.2d

that an organization, formal or informal, that functions as a continuing unit.
Turkette, 452 U.S. at 583. Recently, the Supreme Court has identified the
three structural features of an association in fact for which a plaintiff must
provide sufficient factual allegations such that it is plausible to infer that the
enterprise existed: (1) a purpose; (2) relationships among those associated
with the enterprise; (3) longevity sufficient to permit these associates to
pursue the enterprise's purpose. Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938, —,

18 U.S.C. § 1962 18 U.S.C. § 1962 Prohibited Activities
Extract
It shall be unlawful for any person through a pattern of racketeering activity
or through collection of an unlawful debt to acquire or maintain, directly or
indirectly, any interest in or control of any enterprise which is engaged in, or
the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce. It shall be
unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise
engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce,
to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such
enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of
unlawful debt. It shall be unlawful for any person to conspire to violate any
of the provisions of subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section.
Summary
The RICO statute makes it unlawful for individuals to engage in a pattern of
racketeering activity to acquire or maintain control over an enterprise. The
statute also prohibits individuals associated with an enterprise from
conducting its affairs through racketeering. Additionally, it is unlawful to

conspire to violate these provisions. This supports the proposition that the
coordinated actions of the mother, stepfather, and grandparents could be
seen as forming an "enterprise" under RICO if they engaged in a pattern of
racketeering activity to influence legal proceedings and divest Charles of his
property and custody.
RICO - the rejection of an economic motive requirement.
Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology - Northwestern University,
School of Law - Randolph, Jennifer G. - 1995-03-22
Extract
RICO requires that the enterprise have an economic motive, the Court
defined enterprise as 'an entity,... a group of persons associated together for
a common purpose of engaging in a course of conduct,' which does not
require an economic motive. Thus, the Court established precedent for a
liberal reading of RICO, and specifically the term 'enterprise.'
Summary
The definition of "enterprise" under RICO does not require an economic
motive. This broad interpretation allows for the inclusion of groups of
individuals associated for a common purpose, even if that purpose is not
economic. This supports the proposition that the coordinated actions of the
mother, stepfather, and grandparents could constitute an association-in-fact
enterprise under RICO, as their common purpose was to influence legal
proceedings and gain an advantage in divorce proceedings.

RICO defines 'enterprise' to include 'any individual, partnership,
corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of
individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity... A RICO enterprise
is 'a group of persons associated together for a common purpose in a course
of conduct.'... A RICO enterprise must exhibit three basic characteristics: (1)
a common or shared purpose; (2) some continuity of structure and
personnel; and (3) an ascertainable structure distinct from that in a pattern
of racketeering.'

Summary
Definition of a RICO enterprise, which includes any group of individuals
associated together for a common purpose, whether formal or informal. It
also outlines the characteristics required for a RICO enterprise: a common
purpose, continuity of structure and personnel, and an ascertainable
structure. These elements align with the proposition that the coordinated
actions of the mother, stepfather, and grandparents could constitute an
association-in-fact enterprise under RICO, as they acted together for a
common purpose in a structured manner.

Extract
Various federal courts of appeals have identified some general attributes an
'enterprise' should possess. An enterprise should have a common purpose
among its participants, an organizational structure, and a continuity of
existence. The Supreme Court has held that the enterprise does not need to
have an economic motive. Courts have found individuals, private businesses,
sole proprietorships, foreign and domestic corporations, labor organizations,
government agencies, and other 'associations-in-fact,' to be enterprises.
Summary
An "enterprise" under RICO can include any group of individuals associated
together for a common purpose, whether formal or informal, as long as they
function as a continuing unit. The passage highlights that an enterprise
should have a common purpose, an organizational structure, and continuity
of existence, and it does not need to have an economic motive. This aligns
with the proposition that the coordinated actions of the mother, stepfather,
and grandparents could constitute an association-in-fact enterprise under
RICO.

Extract
An 'enterprise' includes 'any individual, partnership, corporation,
association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals
associated in fact although not a legal entity.'... The basic hallmark of an
enterprise for RICO purposes is that it must contain some structure distinct

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
from the pattern of racketeering activity that is identified in the charge, its
groups must have a common or shared purpose, and there must be at least
some continuity of structure or personnel... A more specific definition
requires that a RICO enterprise exhibit three characteristics: '(1) a common
or shared purpose; (2) some continuity of structure and personnel; and (3)
an ascertainable structure distinct from that inherent in a pattern of
racketeering.'
Summary
Requirements for an enterprise, including a common purpose, continuity of
structure and personnel, and a structure distinct from the racketeering
activity. This supports the proposition that the coordinated actions of the
mother, stepfather, and grandparents could be seen as an association-in-fact
enterprise under RICO, as they acted with a common purpose and continuity
to influence legal proceedings.

Informal relationships among entities may suffice to create an 'associated-in-
fact' enterprises. (95) The grouping of entities may be a legal or illegal
association. (96) In order to be an association-in-fact, the grouping must
have a shared purpose, continuity, and unity. (97) ... According to the
Supreme Court, any type of association can satisfy the enterprise element as
long as it meets this definition. (111)
Summary
RICO's definition of an "enterprise" is broad and can include informal
associations of individuals who share a common purpose and function as a
continuing unit. The passage highlights that such associations do not need
to have an economic motive or legitimate business status, and the Supreme
Court has recognized that any type of association can meet the enterprise
element if it has a shared purpose, continuity, and unity.

Extract
For RICO purposes, an enterprise must exist independently from the
racketeering activity in which it engages, its constituents must have a
common or shared purpose, and it must have some continuity of structure or
personnel. To constitute an enterprise, a group must have a mechanism for
directing the affairs of the group on an ongoing, rather than ad hoc, basis...
In order to be an association-in-fact, the grouping must have a shared
purpose, continuity, and unity... Recently, in Boyle v. United States, the
Supreme Court clarified that RICO association-in-fact enterprises need not
have 'an ascertainable structure beyond that inherent in the pattern of
racketeering activity.'
Summary
For a group to be considered an "enterprise" under RICO, it must have a
common purpose, continuity, and unity. The Supreme Court has clarified that
an association-in-fact does not need a formal structure beyond the pattern of
racketeering activity. This supports the proposition that the coordinated
actions of the mother, stepfather, and grandparents could be seen as an
association-in-fact enterprise under RICO, as they acted with a shared
purpose to influence legal proceedings.

Extract
Prosecutors prove the existence of an enterprise 'by evidence of an ongoing
organization, formal or informal, and by evidence that the various associates
function as a continuing unit.'(117) The circuits, however, disagree 'as to the
scope of an association-in-fact enterprise. Thus, they have taken differing
positions on the degree of proof necessary to establish the existence of an
enterprise that is sufficiently distinct and separate from the underlying
pattern of racketeering.'(118)
Summary
To establish a RICO enterprise, there must be evidence of an ongoing
organization, whether formal or informal, and that the associates function as
a continuing unit. This aligns with the proposition that the coordinated
actions of the mother, stepfather, and grandparents could be seen as an
association-in-fact enterprise under RICO, as they acted together for a
common purpose.

Bailey, Lisa Pritchard - 1999-06-22
Extract
A recurring issue is the type and sufficiency of proof the government must
offer to establish the existence of a RICO enterprise. Although the circuits
have not adopted a uniform definition of enterprise, they do require that the
charged RICO enterprise, in order to distinguish it from a conspiracy, have
some structure. A more specific definition requires that a RICO enterprise
exhibit three characteristics: '(1) a common or shared purpose; (2) some
continuity of structure and personnel; and (3) an ascertainable structure
distinct from that inherent in a pattern of racketeering.' When a 'legal' entity
is the enterprise under consideration, 'there is little difficulty in proving the
existence of the enterprise. Proof that the entity in question has a legal
existence satisfies the enterprise element.' In contrast, proving the existence
of an association-in-fact enterprise requires showing that 'a group of persons
associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a course of
conduct.'
Summary
Characteristics required for a RICO enterprise, which include a common
purpose, continuity of structure and personnel, and an ascertainable
structure. These elements align with the proposition that the coordinated
actions of the mother, stepfather, and grandparents could constitute an
association-in-fact enterprise under RICO.

Reflections on Reves v. Ernst & Young: its meaning and impact on
substantive, accessory, aiding abetting and conspiracy liability under RICO.
American Criminal Law Review - Georgetown University Law Center -
Blakey, G. Robert - 1996-01-01
Extract
The concept of the 'enterprise' was selected by Congress when it enacted
RICO because it desired to use 'terms and concepts of breadth.' Indeed, the
statute itself broadly describes 'enterprise' to include 'any individual,
partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or
group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.' Thus, any
legal entity may be an enterprise, and any group of persons--in any
combination of natural and legal persons--may also constitute an enterprise,
even though it is not a legal entity, by being an association-in-fact. The
definition of 'enterprise,' includes licit... The Concept of an Association-in-
fact: In United States v. Turkette, the Supreme Court's seminal association-
in-fact decision, the Court observed: '[under RICO, the] enterprise is an
entity, for present purposes a group of persons associated together for a
common purpose of engaging in a course of conduct ....' The circuit courts of
appeals are in conflict on the meaning of this sentence. Understanding that
conflict requires looking at decisions before Turkette. Decisions prior to
Turkette reflected little difficulty in finding that an association-in-fact
existed.
Summary
The definition of "enterprise" under RICO is intentionally broad,
encompassing any group of individuals associated in fact for a common
purpose, whether or not they form a legal entity. The Supreme Court's
decision in United States v. Turkette supports the idea that an association-
in-fact can exist when individuals are associated together for a common
purpose of engaging in a course of conduct. This aligns with the proposition
that the coordinated actions of the mother, stepfather, and grandparents
could constitute an association-in-fact enterprise under RICO.
Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy

The Brief - American Bar Association - 2024-01-01
Extract
A plaintiff only has standing to sue if they have been injured in their
business or property by conduct constituting the violation. To establish a §
1962(c) RICO claim, the following elements must be proven: • Enterprise: A
structured group of individuals associated for a common purpose. • Pattern
of racketeering activity: At least two acts of racketeering, as specified within
the statute, within 10 years. • Conduct: Directly or indirectly conducting the
enterprise’s affairs through racketeering. • Injury: An injury to business or
property due to the racketeering activity.
Summary
A civil RICO claim requires proving an enterprise, a pattern of racketeering
activity, conduct through racketeering, and an injury to business or property.
The passage supports the proposition by explaining that an "enterprise" can
be any structured group of individuals associated for a common purpose,
which aligns with the idea that the mother, stepfather, and grandparents
could form an association-in-fact enterprise under RICO.
RECONCEIVING COERCION-BASED CRIMINAL DEFENSES.
Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology - Northwestern University,
School of Law - Galoob, Stephen R. - 2022-03-22
Extract
The inquiry here is meant to invoke the 'pattern of racketeering activity'
element of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).
The Organized Crime Control Act (1970), which includes RICO, provides that
'criminal conduct forms a pattern if it embraces criminal acts that have the
same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of
commission, or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics
and are not isolated events.' The Supreme Court characterized this
requirement as a 'relationship' element and held that the statute further
requires a 'continuity' element, 'referring either to a closed period of
repeated conduct, or to past conduct that by its nature projects into the
future with a threat of repetition.'
Summary
The passage explains the requirements for establishing a "pattern of
racketeering activity" under RICO, which includes criminal acts that are
interrelated by purpose, participants, or methods, and are not isolated
events. It also emphasizes the need for a "relationship" and "continuity"
element, which can be demonstrated by repeated conduct or conduct that
poses a threat of future repetition. This supports the proposition that the

coordinated actions of the mother, stepfather, and grandparents could
constitute an association-in-fact enterprise under RICO if their actions were
interrelated and continuous.
RICO: A Primer

A RICO enterprise includes 'any individual, partnership, corporation,
association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals
associated in fact although not a legal entity.' Courts have interpreted
'enterprise' broadly, and the definition captures both legitimate and
illegitimate enterprises. The statutory list is not exhaustive but merely
illustrative.
Summary
The definition of a RICO enterprise is broad and includes any group of
individuals associated in fact, even if they are not a legal entity. This
supports the proposition that the coordinated actions of the mother,
stepfather, and grandparents could be considered an association-in-fact
enterprise under RICO, as they acted together for a common purpose.
