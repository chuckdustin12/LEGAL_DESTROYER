Question
Plaintiff alleged multiple predicate acts (wire fraud, Travel Act violations,
perjury/subornation of perjury) spanning at least 18 months, involving two
defendants, interstate activity, and ongoing communications and threats. To
state a civil RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), a plaintiff must plausibly
allege: (1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of
racketeering activity. (See H.J. Inc. v. Nw. Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 239
(1989); Johnson v. Heath, 56 F.4th 851, 858 (10th Cir. 2022)). The "pattern"
element requires both relatedness and continuity. Relatedness is satisfied if
predicate acts have similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or
methods, or are otherwise interrelated. Continuity can be closed-ended (a
series of related acts over a substantial period) or open-ended (acts that
threaten future repetition). (H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 239-41). The district court
erred by focusing narrowly on the temporal proximity of the initial predicate
acts and by treating subsequent communications and threats as unrelated,
rather than as evidence of ongoing racketeering activity or a threat of
continued criminal conduct. The court also failed to consider whether the
scheme, as alleged, could constitute open-ended continuity due to ongoing
threats and interference with Plaintiff’s business and property interests.
Answer (Tenth Circuit)
Short response
The district court erred by narrowly focusing on the timing of the initial
predicate acts and by failing to consider ongoing communications and
threats as evidence of a continuing racketeering scheme; under established
Supreme Court and Tenth Circuit precedent, the plaintiff’s allegations
plausibly support both the relatedness and continuity required for a RICO
“pattern,” including open-ended continuity due to ongoing threats and
interference. The court should have evaluated whether the alleged conduct,
spanning at least 18 months and involving multiple predicate acts and
ongoing threats, constituted a pattern of racketeering activity under 18
U.S.C. § 1962(c).
Summary
To state a civil RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), a plaintiff must allege
conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity, with the
“pattern” element requiring both relatedness and continuity. The authorities
make clear that relatedness is satisfied when predicate acts share similar
purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods, and continuity can be
established either by a closed period of repeated conduct (closed-ended) or
by acts that threaten future repetition (open-ended); ongoing threats and
interference with business interests are highly relevant to the continuity
analysis.

The district court’s error lay in treating subsequent communications and
threats as unrelated to the initial predicate acts, rather than as evidence of
ongoing racketeering activity or a threat of continued criminal conduct. The
case law, especially from the Supreme Court and the Tenth Circuit, requires
courts to consider the broader context of the alleged scheme—including
ongoing threats and interference—as potentially supporting open-ended
continuity, and not to focus solely on the temporal proximity of the initial
acts.
Background and Relevant Law
Statutory Framework
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), codified at
18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), prohibits any person employed by or associated with an
enterprise engaged in interstate commerce from conducting or participating
in the conduct of such enterprise’s affairs through a pattern of racketeering
activity. The statute defines “racketeering activity” to include a wide range
of federal and state crimes, such as wire fraud, Travel Act violations, and
perjury, among others (RICO: A Primer (2022-01-31); Joseph v. U.S. Pub.
Defenders Office (W.D. Okla. 2021)).
A “pattern of racketeering activity” requires at least two acts of
racketeering activity within a ten-year period (18 U.S.C. § 1961(5); UMB
Bank v. Monson, 21-CV-2504-EFM (D. Kan. Jun 04, 2025)). However, the
Supreme Court has clarified that two acts are necessary but not sufficient;
the acts must be related and must amount to or pose a threat of continued
criminal activity (H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229 (1989);
Janis v. Story & Associates, 124 F.3d 216 (10th Cir. 1993)).
Case Law: Pattern, Relatedness, and Continuity
The Supreme Court in H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229
(1989) established that a RICO “pattern” requires both “continuity plus
relationship.” The Tenth Circuit has consistently followed this framework,
requiring plaintiffs to show that predicate acts are related (i.e., they have
similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods, or are otherwise
interrelated and not isolated events) and that there is continuity (i.e., either
a closed period of repeated conduct or conduct that by its nature projects
into the future with a threat of repetition) (Johnson v. Heath, 56 F.4th 851
(10th Cir. 2022); Resolution Trust Corp. v. Stone, 998 F.2d 1534 (10th Cir.
1993); Boone v. Carlsbad Bancorporation, Inc., 972 F.2d 1545 (10th Cir.
1992)).
Relatedness is generally not a difficult hurdle; it is satisfied if the predicate
acts are part of a common scheme or share similar characteristics (Boone v.
Carlsbad Bancorporation, Inc., 972 F.2d 1545 (10th Cir. 1992); UMB Bank v.
Monson, 21-CV-2504-EFM (D. Kan. Jun 04, 2025)).

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Continuity is more demanding. It can be established in two ways:
Closed-ended continuity: A series of related predicate acts extending
over a substantial period of time. Acts over a few weeks or months are
generally insufficient; courts look for conduct spanning a significant
period, often a year or more (Resolution Trust Corp. v. Stone, 998 F.2d
1534 (10th Cir. 1993); Sil-Flo, Inc. v. SFHC, Inc., 917 F.2d 1507 (10th
Cir. 1990)).
Open-ended continuity: Conduct that, by its nature, projects into the
future with a threat of repetition. This can be shown by ongoing
threats, interference, or conduct that is the regular way of conducting
the enterprise’s business (Johnson v. Heath, 56 F.4th 851 (10th Cir.
2022); Nation v. Shah, 4:19-cv-00588-JDR-JFJ (N.D. Okla. Oct 30,
2024)).
The Tenth Circuit and district courts within its jurisdiction have repeatedly
emphasized that continuity is a fact-specific inquiry, and that ongoing
threats or interference with a plaintiff’s business or property interests may
support a finding of open-ended continuity (100 Mount Holly Bypass v. Axos
Bank, Case No. 2:20-CV-856-TS-CMR (D. Utah Jul 27, 2021); Gotfredson v.
Larsen Lp, 432 F.Supp.2d 1163 (D. Colo. 2006)).
Analysis
Application of the Pattern Requirement
Relatedness
The plaintiff’s allegations of multiple predicate acts—wire fraud, Travel Act
violations, and perjury/subornation of perjury—spanning at least 18 months,
involving two defendants, and targeting the plaintiff’s business and property
interests, satisfy the relatedness requirement. The acts are not isolated; they
are part of an alleged scheme with common purposes (to harm or defraud
the plaintiff), similar methods (fraud, threats, and perjury), and overlapping
participants and victims (UMB Bank v. Monson, 21-CV-2504-EFM (D. Kan.
Jun 04, 2025); Boone v. Carlsbad Bancorporation, Inc., 972 F.2d 1545 (10th
Cir. 1992)). The authorities make clear that relatedness is established when
predicate acts are interrelated by purpose, method, or victim, and need not
be identical in every respect (Schrag v. Dinges, 788 F.Supp. 1543 (D. Kan.
1992); RICO: A Primer (2022-01-31)).
Continuity
The more challenging question is whether the plaintiff has adequately
alleged continuity. The facts—predicate acts over at least 18 months,
ongoing communications, and threats—support both closed-ended and open-
ended continuity.
Closed-ended continuity: Courts have found that a series of related
predicate acts over a substantial period (typically more than a year) can
establish closed-ended continuity (Resolution Trust Corp. v. Stone, 998
•

• 

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
F.2d 1534 (10th Cir. 1993); Sensoria, LLC v. Kaweske, 581 F.Supp.3d
1243 (D. Colo. 2022)). Here, the alleged conduct spanned at least 18
months, which is generally sufficient to meet the “substantial period”
threshold, especially when the acts are numerous and part of a common
scheme.
Open-ended continuity: Even if the court were to find the closed-
ended period insufficient, the ongoing nature of the threats and
interference with the plaintiff’s business and property interests
supports a finding of open-ended continuity. The Tenth Circuit has held
that open-ended continuity exists where the predicate acts involve
ongoing threats, form the regular way of conducting the enterprise’s
affairs, or otherwise project into the future with a threat of repetition
(Johnson v. Heath, 56 F.4th 851 (10th Cir. 2022); Nation v. Shah, 4:19-
cv-00588-JDR-JFJ (N.D. Okla. Oct 30, 2024)). Ongoing communications
and threats, especially when they interfere with business operations,
are classic examples of conduct that may support open-ended
continuity (100 Mount Holly Bypass v. Axos Bank, Case No. 2:20-
CV-856-TS-CMR (D. Utah Jul 27, 2021)).
The district court’s error was in treating the subsequent communications
and threats as unrelated to the initial predicate acts, rather than as evidence
of a continuing scheme. The authorities make clear that the continuity
analysis must consider the entire context of the alleged conduct, including
ongoing threats and interference, not just the timing of the initial acts
(Purvis v. Hamwi, 828 F.Supp. 1479 (D. Colo. 1993); Gotfredson v. Larsen Lp,
432 F.Supp.2d 1163 (D. Colo. 2006)).
The District Court’s Error
The district court’s focus on the temporal proximity of the initial predicate
acts, to the exclusion of subsequent communications and threats, is
inconsistent with Supreme Court and Tenth Circuit precedent. The
authorities require courts to assess whether the alleged conduct, taken as a
whole, demonstrates a threat of continued criminal activity or a regular way
of conducting the enterprise’s affairs (H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co.,
492 U.S. 229 (1989); Resolution Trust Corp. v. Stone, 998 F.2d 1534 (10th
Cir. 1993)). Ongoing threats and interference are highly relevant to the
continuity analysis and may support a finding of open-ended continuity, even
if the initial acts occurred within a relatively short period (Johnson v. Heath,
56 F.4th 851 (10th Cir. 2022); Nation v. Shah, 4:19-cv-00588-JDR-JFJ (N.D.
Okla. Oct 30, 2024)).
The Tenth Circuit has also cautioned that continuity is a fact-specific inquiry,
and that courts should not impose a bright-line rule based solely on the
duration of the predicate acts (U.S. v. Smith, 413 F.3d 1253 (10th Cir. 2005)).
Although U.S. v. Smith was stated as overruled by United States v. Nissen,
555 F.Supp.3d 1174 (D. N.M. 2021), the principle that continuity is a
flexible, fact-driven concept remains valid and is supported by other binding
authorities.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Ongoing Threats and Interference as Evidence of Open-
Ended Continuity
The authorities are clear that ongoing threats and interference with a
plaintiff’s business or property interests may constitute open-ended
continuity. For example, in 100 Mount Holly Bypass v. Axos Bank, the court
found that ongoing extortive demands and threats to business operations
supported a finding of continuity. Similarly, in Johnson v. Heath and Nation v.
Shah, the courts recognized that ongoing threats or interference may
establish open-ended continuity, even if the initial predicate acts occurred
over a relatively short period.
The district court’s failure to consider whether the ongoing threats and
interference could support open-ended continuity was therefore a legal
error. The proper analysis requires consideration of whether the alleged
conduct, including ongoing communications and threats, demonstrates a
threat of continued racketeering activity (Resolution Trust Corp. v. Stone,
998 F.2d 1534 (10th Cir. 1993); Purvis v. Hamwi, 828 F.Supp. 1479 (D. Colo.
1993)).
Multiple Defendants and Interstate Activity
The involvement of multiple defendants and interstate activity further
supports the existence of a RICO enterprise and a pattern of racketeering
activity. The authorities recognize that RICO applies to both legitimate and
illegitimate enterprises, and that the statute’s reach is broad enough to
encompass schemes involving multiple actors and interstate conduct (RICO:
A Primer (2022-01-31); Torwest DBC, Inc. v. Dick, 810 F.2d 925 (10th Cir.
1987)). The presence of multiple participants and interstate communications
strengthens the inference that the alleged conduct is not isolated or
sporadic, but rather part of a coordinated scheme.
Exceptions and Caveats
While the authorities overwhelmingly support the conclusion that ongoing
threats and interference may establish open-ended continuity, there are
some caveats. The Tenth Circuit has, in certain cases, declined to find a
pattern where the alleged scheme involved only a single victim and a single
discrete objective, even if pursued through multiple illegal acts (Civil Rico: A
Tool of Advocacy (2024-01-01); Torwest DBC, Inc. v. Dick, 810 F.2d 925 (10th
Cir. 1987)). However, these cases are distinguishable where, as here, the
plaintiff alleges ongoing threats and interference with business operations,
which may support a finding of open-ended continuity.
It is also important to note that Condict v. Condict, 815 F.2d 579 (10th Cir.
1987) was stated as superseded by Maxwell v. Wilson, 766 P.2d 909 (N.M.
1988), and U.S. v. Smith, 413 F.3d 1253 (10th Cir. 2005) was stated as
overruled by United States v. Nissen, 555 F.Supp.3d 1174 (D. N.M. 2021).
However, the core principles regarding the pattern requirement, continuity,
and relatedness remain supported by more recent and binding authorities,
including Supreme Court and Tenth Circuit precedent.

Conclusion
In sum, the district court erred by focusing narrowly on the timing of the
initial predicate acts and by failing to consider ongoing communications and
threats as evidence of a continuing racketeering scheme. Under Supreme
Court and Tenth Circuit precedent, the plaintiff’s allegations plausibly
support both the relatedness and continuity required for a RICO “pattern,”
including open-ended continuity due to ongoing threats and interference.
The proper analysis requires consideration of the entire context of the
alleged conduct, including ongoing threats and interference with business
interests, and not just the temporal proximity of the initial acts. The
authorities make clear that such ongoing conduct may support a finding of a
pattern of racketeering activity under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c).
Legal Authorities
Johnson v. Heath, 56 F.4th 851 (10th Cir. 2022)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
Continuity can be either closed or open ended. Id. at 241, 109 S.Ct. 2893.
Closed-ended continuity is a closed period of repeated racketeering conduct,
while open-ended continuity consists of racketeering conduct that threatens
future repetition. Id. Plaintiffs can establish open-ended continuity by
showing that the racketeering acts involved implicit or explicit threats of
repetition, that they formed the operations of an association that exists for
criminal purposes, or that they were the defendants’ regular way of
conducting a legitimate enterprise. Id. at 242–43, 109 S.Ct. 2893.
Summary
The passage from "Johnson v. Heath" discusses the concept of continuity in
the context of RICO claims, referencing the Supreme Court's decision in H.J.
Inc. It explains that continuity can be either closed-ended or open-ended,
which is directly relevant to the proposition. The passage supports the idea
that ongoing communications and threats can be considered as evidence of
open-ended continuity, which is a key element in establishing a pattern of
racketeering activity under RICO. This aligns with the proposition that the
district court erred by not considering the ongoing nature of the alleged
racketeering activities.

To satisfy the pattern requirement of RICO, plaintiffs must show two
elements--'continuity plus relationship.' Sedima, 473 U.S. at 496 n. 14, 105
S.Ct. at 3285 n. 14. The relationship test 'is not a cumbersome one for a
RICO plaintiff. A showing that predicate acts 'have the same or similar
purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of commission, or
otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not
isolated events' is essentially all that is needed.' Feinstein v. RTC, 942 F.2d
34, 44 (1st Cir.1991) (quoting H.J. Inc.). But the continuity requirement is
more difficult to meet: The central question is whether [defendants'
activities] are 'continuous.' To establish continuity, the plaintiff must
demonstrate either 'a closed period of repeated conduct' or 'past conduct
that by its nature projects into the future with a threat of repetition.' ...
These two forms of continuity are respectively referred to as closed-ended
and open-ended continuity.
Summary
The relationship test is not difficult to meet, as it involves showing that
predicate acts are interrelated. However, the continuity requirement is more
challenging, requiring either a closed period of repeated conduct or a threat
of future repetition. This aligns with the proposition's assertion that the
district court erred by not considering the potential for open-ended
continuity due to ongoing threats and interference.
Sil-Flo, Inc. v. SFHC, Inc., 917 F.2d 1507 (10th Cir. 1990)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
Since the district court's ruling on the defendants' motion for summary
judgment in Sil-Flo I, the Supreme Court has further defined what conduct
constitutes a pattern of racketeering activity. See H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern
Bell Tel. Co., --- U.S. ----, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989). In that
case, the Court held that a RICO violation does not necessarily require more
than one scheme, although conduct involving multiple schemes will likely be
more probative. Id. at 2901; see also Phelps v. Wichita Eagle-Beacon, 886 F.
2d 1262, 1273 (10th Cir.1989). Instead, the Court focused on two
requirements: continuity and relationship. H.J. Inc., 109 S.Ct. at 2900. ... To
establish continuity, the plaintiff must demonstrate either 'a closed period of
repeated conduct' or 'past conduct that by its nature projects into the future
with a threat of repetition.' H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co., 109
S.Ct. at 2902. These two forms of continuity are respectively referred to as
closed-ended and open-ended continuity. Id. The Supreme Court held that
closed-ended continuity requires 'a series of related predicates extending
over a substantial period of time. Predicate acts extending over a few weeks
or months' are insufficient. Id. Open-ended continuity requires a clear threat
of future criminal conduct related to past criminal conduct. Id.

concept, referring either to a closed period of repeated conduct, or to past
conduct that by its nature projects into the future with a threat of repetition.
Id. at 241, 109 S.Ct. 2893. Proving continuity may be done in several ways;
there is no bright-line rule. Id. Indeed, whether this requirement is met
'depends on the specific facts of each case.' Id. at 242, 109 S.Ct. 2893.
Summary
The passage from "U.S. v. Smith" discusses the requirement for establishing
a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO, specifically focusing on the
continuity aspect. It references the Supreme Court's decision in H.J. Inc.,
which is a key authority on the pattern requirement, emphasizing that
continuity can be either closed-ended or open-ended. This directly supports
the proposition that the district court erred by not considering the ongoing
nature of the alleged racketeering activity and the potential for open-ended
continuity due to ongoing threats and interference.

The Supreme Court has elaborated on RICO's limited definition of the
'pattern' element. Although proof of at least two predicate racketeering acts
are necessary to prove a pattern, that may not be sufficient. H.J. Inc. v.

n. 14, 105 S.Ct. 3275, 3285 n. 14, 87 L.Ed.2d 346 (1985)). The Supreme
Court has concluded that Congress intended that the pattern element
'requires the showing of a relationship between the predicates, ... and the
threat of continuing activity'--that is, 'continuity plus relationship.' ... Only
the continuity prong of the pattern element is at issue in this case.
'Continuity' is both a closed- and open-ended concept: closed-ended
referring to a closed period of repeated conduct and open-ended referring to
conduct that by its nature projects into the future with a threat of repetition.
See id. at 241, 109 S.Ct. at 2902; Phelps v. Wichita Eagle-Beacon, 886 F.2d
1262, 1273 (10th Cir.1989). A party alleging a RICO violation may
demonstrate continuity over a closed period by proving a series of related
predicates extending over a substantial period of time. H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at
242, 109 S.Ct. at 2902; Phelps, 886 F.2d at 1273. Predicate acts extending
over a few weeks or months are insufficient to show closed-ended continuity.
H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 242, 109 S.Ct. at 2902. Open-ended continuity depends
upon the facts of each case, and may be established by showing that the
predicates themselves involve a distinct threat of long-term racketeering
activity, either implicit or explicit, or that the predicates are a regular way of
conducting the defendant's ongoing legitimate business or the RICO
enterprise. Id. at 242-43, 109 S.Ct. at 2902.
Summary
The passage discusses the requirements for establishing a "pattern" of
racketeering activity under RICO, specifically focusing on the continuity
aspect. It explains that continuity can be either closed-ended or open-ended,
which aligns with the proposition's assertion that the district court erred by
not considering the potential for open-ended continuity due to ongoing
threats and interference. The passage supports the idea that continuity
involves a threat of ongoing criminal conduct, which is relevant to the
plaintiff's allegations of ongoing communications and threats.

U.S. District Court — Western District of Oklahoma
Extract
To plead a valid RICO claim, a plaintiff must plausibly allege that a
defendant “(1) conducted the affairs (2) of an enterprise (3) through a
pattern (4) of racketeering activity.” ... A “pattern” requires at least two
predicate acts. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5). Predicate acts must be violations of
certain statutes, 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1), here alleged to be federal mail fraud
and wire fraud statutes. Additionally, a Plaintiff must allege facts from which
the Court can conclude the existence of a pattern, that is that the
“predicates themselves amount to, or that they otherwise constitute a threat
of, continuing racketeering activity.” H.J., Inc. v. Northwestern Bell
Telephone Co., 492 U.S. 229, 240 (1989) (emphasis original). The Supreme
Court has explained that there are two elements to finding a pattern for

RICO purposes: “continuity plus relationship.” ... Plaintiff argues the
Complaint alleges facts to support both open- and closed-ended continuity.
Summary
The passage outlines the requirements for pleading a RICO claim,
emphasizing the need for a pattern of racketeering activity, which includes
both continuity and relationship. The passage references the Supreme
Court's explanation in H.J. Inc. regarding the necessity of demonstrating
either closed-ended or open-ended continuity. This aligns with the
proposition's assertion that the district court erred by not considering the
ongoing nature of the alleged racketeering activity and threats.
Condict v. Condict, 826 F.2d 923 (10th Cir. 1987)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
In Sedima, the Supreme Court held that a violation of 1962(c) requires (1)
conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activities, and that a plaintiff to state a claim under 1962(c) must allege each
of these four elements. Sedima, 105 S.Ct. at 3285. ... However, to establish a
RICO pattern, a plaintiff must also demonstrate continuity, that is, 'the
threat of continuing activity.' Sedima, 105 S.Ct. at 3285 n. 14. This element
is derived from RICO's legislative history, which indicates that RICO does
not apply to 'sporadic activity' or to the 'isolated offender'. ... Courts
generally agree that to make an adequate showing of continuity under
Sedima, a plaintiff must demonstrate some facts from which at least a threat
of ongoing illegal conduct may be inferred.
Summary
The passage from "Condict v. Condict" reiterates the requirements for a
RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), emphasizing the need for a "pattern
of racketeering activities" which includes both relatedness and continuity.
The passage supports the proposition by highlighting the necessity of
demonstrating continuity, which can be shown through a threat of ongoing
illegal conduct. This aligns with the proposition's assertion that the district
court erred by not considering the ongoing nature of the alleged
racketeering activities and threats.

Extract
In Sedima, the Supreme Court held that a violation of 1962(c) requires (1)
conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activities, and that a plaintiff to state a claim under 1962(c) must allege each
of these four elements. Sedima, 105 S.Ct. at 3285. Our narrowing issue then
is whether, under the record before us, the plaintiffs have charged the
defendants, or any of them, with the conduct, or participation in the
conduct, of an enterprise, i.e., Condict Ranches, through a 'pattern of
racketeering activities.' In this connection, our focus is specifically directed
to the phrase 'pattern of racketeering activities,' and, even more
particularly, to the one word 'pattern.' We believe the present complaint is
deficient in these particulars, and that any evidentiary matter before the
district court strengthens that conclusion.
Summary
Requirements for a RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), specifically
focusing on the need to allege a "pattern of racketeering activities." It
references the Supreme Court's decision in Sedima, which outlines the
elements necessary for such a claim. The passage highlights the importance
of demonstrating both relatedness and continuity in the alleged racketeering
activities, which aligns with the proposition's emphasis on the need for a
pattern of related and continuous acts. The passage also notes the
deficiency in the complaint for failing to adequately allege a pattern, which
underscores the necessity of meeting these criteria.
UMB Bank v. Monson, 21-CV-2504-EFM (D. Kan. Jun 04, 2025)
U.S. District Court — District of Kansas
Extract
Racketeering activity is frequently described as 'predicate acts' which
consist of the federal and state crimes identified in 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1). UMB
presents facts supporting Defendants' involvement in several qualifying
predicate acts listed under 18 U.S.C. § 1961- namely wire fraud and financial
institution fraud... To state a 'pattern' of racketeering activity, the plaintiff
must allege 'at least two acts of racketeering activity... which occurred
within ten years.' Moreover, 'a RICO pattern requires that the racketeering
predicates relate to each other and amount to a threat of continued
racketeering activity. No pattern exists without this ‘continuity plus
relationship.'... As to the relationship requirement, predicate acts satisfy this
element when they make up one common scheme... Racketeering predicates
relate to each other if they 'have the same or similar purposes, results,
participants, victims, or methods of commission, or otherwise are
interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not isolated events.'...
Next, the Court turns to the continuity requirement. Under this prong, a
plaintiff must allege that the acts amounted to or threaten continued

racketeering activity... Either 'open-ended' or 'closed-ended' continuity can
satisfy the continuity prong.
Summary
The court in "UMB Bank v. Monson" addressed the elements required to
establish a civil RICO claim, including the necessity of alleging a pattern of
racketeering activity. The court explained that this pattern requires both
relatedness and continuity, aligning with the requirements set forth in H.J.
Inc. v. Nw. Bell Tel. Co. The passage supports the proposition by illustrating
how relatedness and continuity can be established through predicate acts
that are part of a common scheme and either threaten future repetition or
span a significant period.

U.S. District Court — District of Kansas
Extract
In H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106
L.Ed.2d 195 (1989), the Supreme Court reiterated the well-established
concept that racketeering acts form a 'pattern' in RICO where they exhibit
'continuity plus relationship.' Id. at 239, 109 S.Ct. at 2900. The 'relationship'
requirement is satisfied when the racketeering acts have 'the same or
similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of commission, or
otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not
isolated events.' Id. at 240, 109 S.Ct. at 2901 (citing Sedima, 473 U.S. at 496
n. 14, 105 S.Ct. at 3285 n. 14). With respect to the 'continuity' requirement,
the Supreme Court stated that the predicate acts must amount to, or pose a
threat of, continuing racketeering activity. Id. According to the Supreme
Court, continuity 'is both a closed- and open-ended concept, referring to a
closed period of repeated conduct, or to past conduct that by its nature
projects into the future with a threat of repetition.' Id. A RICO plaintiff 'may
demonstrate continuity over a closed period by proving a series of related
predicates extending over a substantial period of time.' Id. Predicates
extending over merely a few weeks or months, on the other hand, may
satisfy the continuity element if there is a threat of repetition in the future.
This latter concept of continuity, which occurs over an 'open period,' is
established by showing that the predicate acts are a 'regular way of
conducting the enterprise's ongoing business.'
Summary
Continuity can be demonstrated through either a closed period of repeated
conduct or an open-ended threat of future repetition. This directly supports
the proposition's argument that the district court erred by not considering
the ongoing nature of the alleged racketeering activity and threats.

In order to make out a pattern under RICO, the predicate acts must
somehow be ordered or arranged, bearing some relationship to each other,
and implicate the threat of continuing activity. H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell

2d 195 (1989). 'Continuity' is both a closed- and openended concept,
referring either to a closed period of repeated conduct, or to past conduct
that by its nature projects into the future with the threat of repetition. Id. at
241, 109 S.Ct. at 2901. But predicate acts 'extending over a few weeks or
months and threatening no future criminal conduct do not satisfy this
requirement: Congress was concerned in RICO with long-term criminal
conduct.' Id. at 242, 109 S.Ct. at 2902.
Summary
Requirements for establishing a "pattern" under RICO, emphasizing the
need for relatedness and continuity among predicate acts. It highlights that
continuity can be either closed-ended or open-ended, aligning with the
proposition's assertion that ongoing threats and interference could
demonstrate open-ended continuity. The passage also notes that short-term
acts without future threats do not meet the continuity requirement,
supporting the proposition's argument that the district court erred by not
considering the ongoing nature of the alleged scheme.

more than one scheme. H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co., --- U.S.
----, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989). The Court there reiterated its
prior holding that all that is required to constitute a pattern are two
elements--'continuity plus relationship.' Sedima, 473 U.S. at 496 n. 14, 105
S.Ct. at 3285 n. 14. There is no question that the acts complained of in this
case are related because they are all part of an alleged common scheme.
See Torwest DBC, Inc. v. Dick, 810 F.2d 925, 928 (10th Cir.1987). The
central question is whether they are 'continuous.' To establish continuity, the
plaintiff must demonstrate either 'a closed period of repeated conduct' or
'past conduct that by its nature projects into the future with a threat of
repetition.' H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co., 109 S.Ct. at 2902.
These two forms of continuity are respectively referred to as closed-ended

Summary
The passage discusses the requirements for establishing a "pattern" of
racketeering activity under RICO, specifically focusing on the elements of
"continuity plus relationship." It references the Supreme Court's decision in
H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co., which is directly relevant to the
proposition. The passage explains the concepts of closed-ended and open-
ended continuity, which are crucial for determining whether a pattern of
racketeering activity exists. This aligns with the proposition's assertion that
the district court erred by not considering the ongoing nature of the alleged
racketeering activity.
Gotfredson v. Larsen Lp, 432 F.Supp.2d 1163 (D. Colo. 2006)
U.S. District Court — District of Colorado
Extract
Here, Plaintiffs contend that they have established a pattern of racketeering
activity consisting of the following predicate acts: (1) conspiracy to commit
extortion, (2) mail and wire fraud, and (3) interstate travel in aid of
extortion... In order for Plaintiffs to prove a pattern, they must demonstrate
not only the existence of two or more predicate acts, but also that they are
related and pose at least a threat of continued criminal activity. H.J., 492
U.S. at 238-39, 109 S.Ct. 2893. Thus, Plaintiffs must show two elements
—'continuity plus relationship.'... Continuity is both a closed and open-ended
concept, referring either to a closed period of repeated conduct, or to past
conduct that by its nature projects into the future with a threat of
repetition... Open-ended continuity 'may be established by showing that the
predicates themselves involve a distinct threat of long-term racketeering
activity, either implicit or explicit, or that the predicates are a regular way of
conducting the defendant's ongoing legitimate business or the RICO
enterprise.'
Summary
Requirements for establishing a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO,
specifically the need for continuity and relationship among predicate acts. It
references the H.J. Inc. case, which is a key authority on the pattern
requirement, and explains both closed-ended and open-ended continuity.
This directly supports the proposition by highlighting the need for
relatedness and continuity in RICO claims, and it aligns with the argument
that the district court erred by not considering the ongoing nature of the
alleged racketeering activity.

Plaintiffs proceed on the 'closed-ended' concept of continuity which consists
of a closed period of repeated past conduct that extended over a substantial
length of time. Id. Regarding their Twentieth Cause of Action, Plaintiffs
assert 'a closed-ended pattern of racketeering activity that consisted of at
least fifteen distinct acts over a two-year period.' ECF 221 at 43. They
identify those fifteen distinct acts by citing ¶¶ 279-304 of the TAC, which are
the paragraph numbers for the Twentieth Cause of Action. The scheme
subject of this RICO count is defrauding Clover Top Holdings, Inc.’s
investors of their financial investment. In support of their Twenty-First
Cause of Action, Plaintiffs allege 'a closed-ended pattern of racketeering
activity that consisted of at least eleven distinct acts extending over more
than a three-year period.' Id. at 44.
Summary
Concept of "closed-ended" continuity in RICO claims, which involves a series
of related acts over a substantial period. It highlights that plaintiffs in the
case alleged multiple predicate acts over a two-year period, which supports
the notion of a pattern of racketeering activity. This aligns with the
proposition's requirement for continuity in RICO claims, either closed-ended
or open-ended. The passage also emphasizes the need for multiple predicate
acts over a significant period, which is relevant to the proposition's focus on
ongoing communications and threats as evidence of racketeering activity.

Summary
The passage from the Suddath case provides a detailed explanation of the
requirements for establishing a "pattern" of racketeering activity under
RICO, specifically addressing the concepts of relatedness and continuity. It
emphasizes the need for predicate acts to either amount to or threaten long-

U.S. District Court — Northern District of Oklahoma
Extract
More difficult to establish-and more problematic for Plaintiffs-is the
requirement that the predicate acts have sufficient “continuity” to constitute
a RICO “pattern.” See Bixler v. Foster, 596 F.3d 751, 761 (10th Cir. 2010)
(indicating that the continuity requirement “is more difficult to
meet” (citation and quotation marks omitted)). For RICO purposes,
continuity comes in one of two forms: Closed-ended continuity can be
established by alleging a “closed period of repeated racketeering conduct.”
Johnson, 56 F.4th at 859-60 (citing H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 241-43). Open-ended
continuity can be established by racketeering acts that “involved implicit or
explicit threats of repetition,” “formed the operations of an association that
exists for criminal purposes,” or were part of the defendants' “regular way
of conducting a legitimate enterprise.” Id. (citing?/. J. Inc., 492 U.S. at
241-43). A plaintiff who cannot establish one of these two forms of continuity
cannot state a viable claim under RICO. E.g., Bixler, 596 F.3d at 761
(affirming dismissal where the complaint failed to allege either the closed-
ended or open-ended continuity of predicate acts required to form a RICO
pattern).
Summary
Requirement of continuity in establishing a RICO pattern, which is a critical
element of the proposition. It explains the two forms of continuity—closed-
ended and open-ended—and references relevant case law, including Johnson
and H.J. Inc., which are also cited in the proposition. This aligns with the
proposition's assertion that the district court erred by not considering the
potential for open-ended continuity due to ongoing threats and interference.

Joseph v. U.S. Pub. Defenders Office
U.S. District Court — District of New Mexico
Extract
RICO was enacted to address “racketeering activity.” The statute defines
“racketeering activity” to encompass specified state and federal offenses,
which are referred to as predicate acts. These predicate acts include any act
indictable under enumerated federal statutes, 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961(1)(B)-(C),
(E)-(G), specified crimes chargeable under state law, § 1961(1)(A), and any

=== PAGE 18 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
offense involving bankruptcy or securities fraud or drug-related activity that
is punishable under federal law, § 1961(1)(D). Predicate acts can give rise to
a RICO claim when they are part of a “pattern of racketeering activity, ”
which is defined as a series of related predicates that together demonstrate
the existence or threat of continued criminal activity. H.J. Inc. v. N.W. Bell
Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 239 (1989).
Summary
The passage explains that RICO addresses "racketeering activity" and
defines it to include specified state and federal offenses as predicate acts. It
further clarifies that these predicate acts can form a RICO claim when they
are part of a "pattern of racketeering activity," which involves related
predicates that demonstrate continued criminal activity. This directly
supports the proposition by explaining the legal framework for establishing
a RICO claim, including the need for a pattern of related predicate acts, as
discussed in H.J. Inc. v. N.W. Bell Tel. Co.

Utah Jul 27, 2021)
U.S. District Court — District of Utah
Extract
The RICO statute defines a 'pattern of racketeering activity' as at least two
acts of racketeering activity within a ten-year period. The Supreme Court
has clarified that two predicate acts are necessary but not sufficient to show
a pattern. A pattern also requires 'that the racketeering predicates are
related, and that they amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal
activity.' Continuity requires that the predicate acts extend over a
''substantial period of time'' and that ''the predicates themselves involve a
distinct threat of long-term racketeering activity. .. [or] are a regular way of
conducting the defendant's ongoing legitimate business or the RICO
enterprise.' The court examines 'both the duration of the related predicate
acts and the extensiveness of the RICO enterprise's scheme.' ... Here, the
alleged predicate acts are interrelated pieces of a sophisticated scheme to
defraud. The activity is also continuous. There were allegedly dozens of
predicate acts occurring throughout Plaintiffs' now two-year relationship
with the Defendants and they are allegedly ongoing, as Axos continues to
refuse to commence the lease unless Plaintiffs essentially give up their right
to a functioning system and give in to allegedly extortive demands such as
releasing Axos from liability and affirming an untruth (that the project is
free of liens). Plaintiffs also plausibly allege that other customers are at risk
of falling victim to the same racket, alleging that it received information that
the Defendants had done similar deals in the past, and the structure of the
alleged scheme is obviously exportable to other victims. By pleading nearly
two years of prior racketeering activity and a clear threat of future
racketeering activity, Plaintiffs satisfactorily plead continuity.

Summary
Requirements for establishing a "pattern of racketeering activity" under the
RICO statute, emphasizing the need for relatedness and continuity. It
provides an example where the court found that the alleged predicate acts
were interrelated and continuous, supporting the notion of a sophisticated

18 U.S.C. Sec. 1962(c). A violation of section 1962(c) thus 'requires (1)
conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity.' Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479, 105 S.Ct. 3275, 3285,
87 L.Ed.2d 346 (1985). RICO defines racketeering activity as, inter alia, any
act that is indictable under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1341 (mail fraud) or 18 U.S.C.
Sec. 1343 (wire fraud). See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1961(1)(B). RICO also states that
a 'pattern of racketeering activity' requires at least two acts of racketeering
activity. ... 'As the Senate Report explained: 'The target of [RICO] is thus not
sporadic activity. The infiltration of legitimate business normally requires
more than one "racketeering activity" and the threat of continuing activity to
be effective. It is this factor of continuity plus relationship which combines
to produce a pattern.' S.Rep. No. 91-617, p. 158 (1969) (emphasis added).
Similarly, the sponsor of the Senate bill, after quoting this portion of the
Report, pointed out to his colleagues that '[t]he term "pattern" itself
requires the showing of a relationship.... So, therefore, proof of two acts of
racketeering activity, without more, does not establish a pattern....' 116
Cong.Rec. 18940 (1970) (statement of Sen. McClellan). See also id., at
35193 (statement of Rep. Poff) (RICO 'not aimed at the isolated offender');
House Hear Id. Sedima thus makes clear that a RICO violation requires
continuous and related racketeering acts.
Summary
The passage outlines the requirements for a RICO violation under 18 U.S.C.
§ 1962(c), emphasizing the necessity of demonstrating both continuity and
relatedness in the pattern of racketeering activity. The passage supports the
proposition by explaining that a pattern requires more than sporadic activity
and must show a threat of continuing activity, aligning with the proposition's
assertion that the district court erred by not considering ongoing threats
and interference as part of a continuous pattern.

The Tenth Circuit has devised a more demanding standard for showing a
pattern. Where the directors of a corporation were involved in self-dealing
by secretly purchasing real estate and fraudulently reselling it to the
company, the Tenth Circuit ruled that no pattern existed even though the
frauds had occurred over a 10-year period. Torwest DBC, Inc. v. Dick thus
rejected the Fifth Circuit’s reasoning in R.A.G.S. and refused to find a
pattern where 'the single scheme at issue involved one victim.' The court
explained: 'A scheme to achieve a single discrete objective does not in and of
itself create a threat of ongoing activity, even when that goal is pursued by
multiple illegal acts, because the scheme ends when the purpose is
accomplished.'
Summary
Tenth Circuit's approach to determining a "pattern" under civil RICO,
emphasizing the need for a threat of ongoing activity beyond a single
scheme with one victim. This aligns with the proposition's argument that the
district court erred by not considering ongoing threats and interference as
evidence of open-ended continuity. The passage supports the idea that a
pattern requires more than isolated acts and should consider the potential
for future criminal conduct.
RICO: A Primer

Among other things, 'racketeering activities' include 'any act which is
indictable under' a list of federal criminal statutes. The list covers an
expansive range of violations, for example, violations of the Hobbs Act, 18
U.S.C. ' 1951 (extortion); 18 U.S.C. ' 1341 (mail fraud) and 1343 (wire fraud);
18 U.S.C. ' 1831 (economic espionage); 18 U.S.C. ' 1832 (theft of trade
secrets); 18 U.S.C. ' 1952 (Travel Act); 18 U.S.C. ' 1956, 1957 (money
laundering); and 18 U.S.C. ' 2318-2320 (copyright infringement). Mail and
wire fraud are the most common predicate acts. ... A RICO enterprise
includes 'any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal
entity, and any union or group of individuals associated in fact although not
a legal entity.' Courts have interpreted 'enterprise' broadly, and the
definition captures both legitimate and illegitimate enterprises. The
statutory list is not exhaustive but merely illustrative. What is A RICO
'Pattern'? A 'pattern' may exist where any combination of two or more
offenses occurred within a period of time. In Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co.,
473 U.S. 479, the Supreme Court held that the RICO pattern element
requires more than merely proving two predicate acts of racketeering.
Rather, proof of 'continuity plus relationship' is necessary. Nonetheless, the
Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized that Congress had a fairly flexible

=== PAGE 21 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
concept of a pattern in mind. The Supreme Court has stated that: A 'pattern'
is an 'arrangement or order of things or activity,'. .. . It is not the number of
predicates but the relationship that they bear to each other or to some
external organizing principle that renders them 'ordered' or arranged. The
Court has further explained that '[C]riminal conduct forms a pattern if it
embraces criminal acts that have the same or similar purposes, results,
participants, victims or methods of commission, or otherwise are
interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not isolated events.'
The racketeering acts need not be similar or directly related to each other;
rather, it is sufficient that the racketeering acts are related in some way to
the affairs of the charged enterprise, including, for example, that: the
racketeering acts furthered the goals of or benefitted the enterprise, the
enterprise or the defendant's role in the enterprise enabled the defendant to
commit, or facilitated the commission of, the racketeering acts, the
racketeering acts were committed at the behest of, or on behalf of, the
enterprise, or the racketeering acts had the same or similar purposes,
results, participants, victims or methods of commission. The continuity
requirement is likewise satisfied where the predicates are a regular way of
conducting the defendant's ongoing legitimate business (in the sense that it
is not a business that exists for criminal purposes), or of conducting or
participating in an ongoing and legitimate RICO 'enterprise.' A plaintiff may
demonstrate a pattern by establishment that the predicate acts pose a threat
of continued criminal activity, which is generally demonstrated by showing
either: * Closed-ended continuity. Proving 'a series of related predicate acts
extending over a substantial period of time.' * Open-ended continuity. A
threat of 'continuing criminal activity extending indefinitely into the future,'
in light of the nature of the enterprise and predicate acts alleged.
Summary
Detailed explanation of what constitutes racketeering activities, including
wire fraud and Travel Act violations, which are relevant to the plaintiff's
allegations. It also explains the concept of a RICO enterprise and the broad
interpretation of what constitutes an enterprise. The passage further
elaborates on the "pattern" requirement, emphasizing the need for
continuity and relatedness, which aligns with the proposition's focus on
related predicate acts and continuity through ongoing threats and
communications. The explanation of closed-ended and open-ended continuity
directly supports the argument that the district court erred by not
considering the ongoing nature of the alleged racketeering activity.

definition captures both legitimate and illegitimate enterprises. The
statutory list is not exhaustive but merely illustrative. What is A RICO
'Pattern'? A 'pattern' may exist where any combination of two or more
offenses occurred within a period of time. In Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co.,
473 U.S. 479, the Supreme Court held that the RICO pattern element
requires more than merely proving two predicate acts of racketeering.
Rather, proof of 'continuity plus relationship' is necessary. Nonetheless, the
Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized that Congress had a fairly flexible
concept of a pattern in mind. The Supreme Court has stated that: A 'pattern'
is an 'arrangement or order of things or activity,'. .. . It is not the number of
predicates but the relationship that they bear to each other or to some
external organizing principle that renders them 'ordered' or arranged. The
Court has further explained that '[C]riminal conduct forms a pattern if it
embraces criminal acts that have the same or similar purposes, results,
participants, victims or methods of commission, or otherwise are
interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not isolated events.'
The racketeering acts need not be similar or directly related to each other;
rather, it is sufficient that the racketeering acts are related in some way to
the affairs of the charged enterprise, including, for example, that: the
racketeering acts furthered the goals of or benefitted the enterprise, the
enterprise or the defendant's role in the enterprise enabled the defendant to
commit, or facilitated the commission of, the racketeering acts, the
racketeering acts were committed at the behest of, or on behalf of, the
enterprise, or the racketeering acts had the same or similar purposes,
results, participants, victims or methods of commission. The continuity
requirement is likewise satisfied where the predicates are a regular way of
conducting the defendant's ongoing legitimate business (in the sense that it
is not a business that exists for criminal purposes), or of conducting or
participating in an ongoing and legitimate RICO 'enterprise.' A plaintiff may
demonstrate a pattern by establishment that the predicate acts pose a threat
of continued criminal activity, which is generally demonstrated by showing
either: * Closed-ended continuity. Proving 'a series of related predicate acts
extending over a substantial period of time.' * Open-ended continuity. A
threat of 'continuing criminal activity extending indefinitely into the future,'
in light of the nature of the enterprise and predicate acts alleged.
Summary
Detailed explanation of what constitutes racketeering activities, including
wire fraud and Travel Act violations, which are relevant to the plaintiff's
allegations. It also explains the concept of a RICO enterprise and the broad
interpretation of what constitutes an enterprise. Importantly, it discusses the
"pattern" requirement, emphasizing the need for continuity and relatedness,
which aligns with the proposition's focus on related predicate acts and the
potential for open-ended continuity due to ongoing threats and interference.
