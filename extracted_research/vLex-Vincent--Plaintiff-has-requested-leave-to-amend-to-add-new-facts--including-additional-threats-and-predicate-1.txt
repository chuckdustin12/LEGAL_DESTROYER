Question
Plaintiff has requested leave to amend to add new facts, including additional
threats and predicate acts occurring after the FAC was filed. Leave to
amend should be freely given when justice so requires, especially where new
facts may cure pleading deficiencies (Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a); Foman v. Davis,
371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962)). If the court finds the current allegations
insufficient, it should grant leave to amend to allow Plaintiff to plead
additional facts supporting open-ended continuity. 
Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
Leave to amend should be freely granted under Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 15(a) when justice so requires, particularly where new facts may
cure pleading deficiencies, unless there is a clear reason such as undue
delay, bad faith, prejudice, or futility. If the current allegations are
insufficient, the court should generally permit amendment to allow the
plaintiff to plead additional facts, including those supporting open-ended
continuity.
Summary
Federal courts apply a liberal standard to motions for leave to amend
pleadings under Rule 15(a), as articulated by the Supreme Court in Foman v.
Davis and consistently reaffirmed by circuit and district courts. Unless there
is a specific and compelling reason—such as undue delay, bad faith,
repeated failure to cure deficiencies, undue prejudice to the opposing party,
or futility—leave to amend should be granted, especially where new facts
may address deficiencies in the complaint.
This principle is particularly relevant when a plaintiff seeks to add facts that
occurred after the filing of the operative complaint, such as additional
threats or predicate acts, which may be necessary to establish elements like
open-ended continuity in a RICO claim. Courts are encouraged to allow such
amendments to ensure that claims are decided on their merits rather than
on technicalities, provided the amendment is not sought for improper
purposes and would not be futile.
Background and Relevant Law
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a)
The central legislative authority governing amendments to pleadings in
federal court is Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a). Rule 15(a)(2) provides
that, after a party has amended once as a matter of course or after the time

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
for such amendment has passed, further amendments require either the
opposing party’s written consent or the court’s leave, which “shall be freely
given when justice so requires.” This rule is designed to maximize the
opportunity for claims to be decided on their merits rather than on
procedural technicalities, as emphasized in SCO Grp., Inc. v. Int'l Bus.
Machs. Corp., 879 F.3d 1062 (10th Cir. 2018).
Supreme Court Precedent: Foman v. Davis
The Supreme Court in Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178 (1962), established the
foundational standard for granting leave to amend. The Court held that
leave should be freely given unless there is a clear reason to deny it, such as
undue delay, bad faith, dilatory motive, repeated failure to cure deficiencies
by previous amendments, undue prejudice to the opposing party, or futility
of amendment. This standard has been repeatedly cited and applied by
lower courts.
Supplemental Pleadings: Rule 15(d)
In addition to amendments under Rule 15(a), Rule 15(d) allows for
supplemental pleadings to set forth events that have occurred after the date
of the pleading to be supplemented. Courts have discretion to permit such
supplements, particularly when new facts or events are relevant to the
claims at issue, as recognized in Keith v. Volpe, 858 F.2d 467 (9th Cir. 1988).
Case Law
The liberal standard for granting leave to amend is consistently applied
across federal courts:
In Lopez v. The Rico Court Cartel, 24-cv-00411-DMS-JLB (S.D. Cal. Sep
23, 2024), the court reiterated that leave to amend should be freely
given when justice so requires, and that this policy is to be applied with
“extreme liberality,” citing both Rule 15(a) and Foman v. Davis.
Rafael Villegas Arce v. LHM Dodge Ram Avondale, CV-23-02267-PHX-
MTL (D. Ariz. Mar 11, 2024), and Navajo Health Found. - Sage Mem'l
Hosp., Inc. v. Razaghi Dev. Co., 2:19-cv-00329-GMN-EJY (D. Nev. Mar
15, 2021), both emphasize that leave to amend is generally denied only
when it is clear that the deficiencies cannot be cured by amendment.
One World, LLC v. Onoufriadis, No. 20 Civ. 5802 (CM) (S.D. N.Y. Jan 19,
2021), and Ad Astra Recovery Servs. v. Heath, 18-1145-JWB-ADM (D.
Kan. Dec 26, 2019), further confirm that the purpose of Rule 15(a) is to
allow claims to be decided on their merits, and that leave to amend
should be denied only for good reason, such as undue delay, bad faith,
futility, or prejudice.
Mohebbi v. Khazen, 50 F.Supp.3d 1234 (N.D. Cal. 2014), and Eminence
Capital, LLC v. Aspeon, Inc., 316 F.3d 1048 (9th Cir. 2003), reinforce
that the policy favoring amendment is to be applied with “extreme
liberality,” and that there is a presumption in favor of granting leave to
amend absent a strong showing of the Foman factors.

The courts have also recognized that amendments may be particularly
appropriate where new facts have arisen after the filing of the original
complaint, as in Keith v. Volpe, 858 F.2d 467 (9th Cir. 1988), which
addressed the use of supplemental pleadings under Rule 15(d).
Analysis
Liberal Standard for Leave to Amend
The overwhelming weight of authority supports the proposition that leave to
amend should be freely granted when justice so requires, especially where
new facts may cure pleading deficiencies. The Supreme Court’s decision in 
Foman v. Davis is the touchstone for this principle, and its reasoning has
been adopted and applied by every circuit and district court to consider the
issue. The courts have made clear that the default position is to allow
amendment, and that the burden is on the party opposing amendment to
demonstrate a valid reason for denial, such as undue delay, bad faith,
repeated failure to cure deficiencies, undue prejudice, or futility (Foman v.
Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962); Brown v. Kerkhoff, 504 F.Supp.2d 464 (S.D.
Iowa 2007)).
This liberal approach is designed to ensure that cases are decided on their
substantive merits rather than on technical or procedural grounds (SCO
Grp., Inc. v. Int'l Bus. Machs. Corp., 879 F.3d 1062 (10th Cir. 2018); Mohebbi
v. Khazen, 50 F.Supp.3d 1234 (N.D. Cal. 2014)). The courts have repeatedly
emphasized that amendments should be permitted where they may cure
deficiencies in the complaint, and that even if the court finds the current
allegations insufficient, it should grant leave to amend unless it is clear that
no set of additional facts could cure the deficiency (DeSoto v. Yellow Freight
Systems, Inc., 957 F.2d 655 (9th Cir. 1992); Schreiber Distributing Co. v.
Serv-Well Furniture Co., Inc., 806 F.2d 1393 (9th Cir. 1986)).
Application to New Facts and Predicate Acts
Where a plaintiff seeks to add new facts, including additional threats or
predicate acts occurring after the filing of the operative complaint, the
courts have recognized that such amendments may be necessary to
establish elements of the claim that were previously deficient. For example,
in RICO cases, the requirement of “open-ended continuity” may depend on
facts that arise after the initial complaint. Courts have permitted
amendments to add such facts, provided the amendment is not sought in bad
faith, does not unduly prejudice the opposing party, and is not futile (Boulton
v. Am. Transfer Servs., Inc., CASE NO. 14cv00175-GPC-RBB (S.D. Cal. Aug
05, 2014)).
Rule 15(d) specifically allows for supplemental pleadings to address events
that have occurred after the filing of the original complaint. The Ninth
Circuit in Keith v. Volpe held that allowing a supplemental complaint to
include such events is within the court’s discretion and is consistent with the
purpose of Rule 15 to ensure that all relevant facts are before the court
(Keith v. Volpe, 858 F.2d 467 (9th Cir. 1988)).

Factors Limiting Leave to Amend
While the standard is liberal, courts may deny leave to amend where there is
undue delay, bad faith, repeated failure to cure deficiencies, undue prejudice
to the opposing party, or futility of amendment (Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S.
178, 182 (1962); Moore v. Kayport Package Exp., Inc., 885 F.2d 531 (9th Cir.
1989)). The burden is on the party opposing amendment to demonstrate one
of these factors (Brown v. Kerkhoff, 504 F.Supp.2d 464 (S.D. Iowa 2007)).
For example, if the proposed amendment would be futile because it could
not survive a motion to dismiss, the court may deny leave (Sentementes v.
Gen. Elec. Co., CIVIL ACTION NO. 3:14-CV-00131-VLB (D. Conn. Jun 25,
2014)).
However, courts have cautioned that denial of leave to amend is an abuse of
discretion absent a strong showing of one of these factors (Firestone v.
Firestone, 76 F.3d 1205 (D.C. Cir. 1996); Eminence Capital, LLC v. Aspeon,
Inc., 316 F.3d 1048 (9th Cir. 2003)). The presumption is in favor of granting
leave, and the policy is to be applied with “extreme liberality” (Lopez v. The
Rico Court Cartel, 24-cv-00411-DMS-JLB (S.D. Cal. Sep 23, 2024); Rafael
Villegas Arce v. LHM Dodge Ram Avondale, CV-23-02267-PHX-MTL (D. Ariz.
Mar 11, 2024)).
Procedural Considerations
A party may amend its pleading once as a matter of course before a
responsive pleading is served (Connectu LLC v. Zuckerberg, 522 F.3d 82 (1st
Cir. 2008); Allwaste, Inc. v. Hecht, 65 F.3d 1523 (9th Cir. 1995)). After that,
amendment requires leave of court or the opposing party’s consent. A
motion to dismiss is not considered a responsive pleading for these purposes
(Schreiber Distributing Co. v. Serv-Well Furniture Co., Inc., 806 F.2d 1393
(9th Cir. 1986)).
If a complaint is dismissed for failure to state a claim, leave to amend should
be granted unless it is clear that the complaint’s deficiencies cannot be
cured by amendment (DeSoto v. Yellow Freight Systems, Inc., 957 F.2d 655
(9th Cir. 1992); Lopez v. Smith, 203 F.3d 1122, 2000 WL 144385 (9th Cir.
2000)). Notably, Lopez v. Smith has been overruled by statute in part by 
Melnichuk v. Kijakazi, but the general principle regarding the liberal
standard for amendment remains widely accepted and is supported by other
authorities.
Negative and Subsequent Treatment
Some cases cited have been subject to subsequent negative treatment:
Lopez v. Smith, 203 F.3d 1122 (9th Cir. 2000), was overruled by statute
in part by Melnichuk v. Kijakazi. However, the core principle regarding
the liberal standard for granting leave to amend under Rule 15(a)
remains valid and is supported by other authorities.
Wilkerson v. Shinseki, 606 F.3d 1256 (10th Cir. 2010), was declined to
extend by Freeman v. City of Cheyenne, 23-8022 (10th Cir. Feb 07,
2024). This does not undermine the general principle that leave to
• 
• 

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
amend should be freely given, as this standard is reaffirmed in more
recent and controlling authorities.
Yellow Bus Lines, Inc. v. Drivers, Chauffeurs & Helpers Local Union
639, 883 F.2d 132 (D.C. Cir. 1989), was stated as vacated by Brenner v.
Local 514, United Broth. of Carpenters and Joiners of America, 927 F.
2d 1283 (3rd Cir. 1991). While this affects the precedential value of 
Yellow Bus Lines, the principle it articulated is consistent with the
Supreme Court’s holding in Foman v. Davis and is supported by
numerous other authorities.
Accordingly, even where some cases have been limited or vacated, the
overwhelming weight of authority—including Supreme Court precedent—
supports the liberal standard for granting leave to amend.
Exceptions and Caveats
While the presumption is in favor of granting leave to amend, courts may
deny such motions where there is undue delay, bad faith, repeated failure to
cure deficiencies, undue prejudice to the opposing party, or futility of
amendment. The party opposing amendment bears the burden of
demonstrating one of these factors (Brown v. Kerkhoff, 504 F.Supp.2d 464
(S.D. Iowa 2007)). Additionally, if the proposed amendment would be futile
because it could not survive a motion to dismiss, the court may properly
deny leave (Sentementes v. Gen. Elec. Co., CIVIL ACTION NO. 3:14-
CV-00131-VLB (D. Conn. Jun 25, 2014)).
If the plaintiff has previously been granted leave to amend and has failed to
cure deficiencies, or if the amendment would cause undue prejudice to the
defendant, the court may also deny leave (Moore v. Kayport Package Exp.,
Inc., 885 F.2d 531 (9th Cir. 1989); One World, LLC v. Onoufriadis, No. 20 Civ.
5802 (CM) (S.D. N.Y. Jan 19, 2021)).
Conclusion
In summary, the federal courts apply a liberal standard to motions for leave
to amend under Rule 15(a), as established by the Supreme Court in Foman v.
Davis and consistently reaffirmed by circuit and district courts. Unless there
is a clear and compelling reason to deny leave—such as undue delay, bad
faith, repeated failure to cure deficiencies, undue prejudice, or futility—the
court should grant leave to amend, particularly where new facts may cure
pleading deficiencies. This approach ensures that claims are decided on
their merits and that plaintiffs have a fair opportunity to present all relevant
facts, including those arising after the filing of the original complaint. The
court should therefore grant leave to amend if the current allegations are
insufficient and the plaintiff seeks to add new facts supporting elements
such as open-ended continuity.

U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
Rule 15(a) declares that leave to amend 'shall be freely given when justice
so requires'; this mandate is to be heeded. ... In the absence of any apparent
or declared reason—such as undue delay, bad faith or dilatory motive on the
part of the movant, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments
previously allowed, undue prejudice to the opposing party by virtue of
allowance of the amendment, futility of amendment, etc.—the leave sought
should, as the rules require, be 'freely given.'
Summary
The passage from Foman v. Davis emphasizes the principle that leave to
amend should be freely given when justice requires it, unless there are
specific reasons to deny it, such as undue delay or prejudice. This aligns
with the proposition that if the current allegations are insufficient, the court
should allow the plaintiff to amend the complaint to include new facts that
may cure deficiencies. The passage supports the idea that amendments
should be permitted to ensure claims are tested on their merits.

however, for a number of reasons, including 'undue delay, bad faith or
dilatory motive on the part of the movant, repeated failure to cure
deficiencies by amendments previously allowed, undue prejudice to the
opposing party by virtue of allowance of the amendment, [and] futility of

986, 112 L.Ed.2d 1071 (1991). We review the denial of leave to amend after
a responsive pleading has been filed for an abuse of discretion; however, we
strictly review such denial in light of the strong policy permitting
amendment. National Abortions Fed'n v. Operation Rescue, 8 F.3d 680, 681
(9th Cir.1993). The district court denied Allwaste leave to amend its
complaint on the ground that the additional facts alleged at oral argument
were not sufficient to state a valid RICO claim. This was an abuse of
discretion. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a) entitles plaintiffs the right
to amend once as a matter of course before responsive pleadings are filed. A
motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim is not a responsive pleading.
Schreiber Distrib. v. Serv-Well Furniture Co., 806 F.2d 1393, 1401 (9th Cir.
1986). Because there were no responsive pleadings filed, Allwaste should
have been granted leave to amend.
Summary
Right of a party to amend pleadings under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
15(a), emphasizing that leave to amend should be freely given, especially
before a responsive pleading is filed. The court's decision to deny leave to
amend was considered an abuse of discretion, highlighting the strong policy
favoring amendments to cure deficiencies. This supports the proposition that
leave to amend should be granted to allow the plaintiff to add new facts and
address pleading deficiencies.

Leave to amend a complaint under Rule 15(a) 'shall be freely given when
justice so requires.' FED.R.CIV.P. 15(a); see Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178,
182, 83 S.Ct. 227, 230, 9 L.Ed.2d 222 (1962). Although the grant or denial of
leave to amend is committed to a district court's discretion, it is an abuse of
discretion to deny leave to amend unless there is sufficient reason, such as
'undue delay, bad faith or dilatory motive ... repeated failure to cure
deficiencies by [previous] amendments ... [or] futility of amendment.' Foman,
371 U.S. at 182, 83 S.Ct. at 230.
Summary
The passage emphasizes the principle that leave to amend should be freely
given when justice requires it, as per Rule 15(a) and the precedent set in
Foman v. Davis. It also highlights that denying such leave without a
justifiable reason constitutes an abuse of discretion. This aligns with the
proposition that if the current allegations are insufficient, the court should
allow the plaintiff to amend the complaint to include new facts that may
address any deficiencies.
Wilkerson v. Shinseki, 606 F.3d 1256 (10th Cir. 2010)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
A district court should refuse leave to amend 'only [upon] a showing of
undue delay, undue prejudice to the opposing party, bad faith or dilatory
motive, failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed, or
futility of amendment.'
Summary
Conditions under which a district court may deny a motion for leave to
amend a complaint. It emphasizes that leave to amend should generally be
granted unless there is a specific reason such as undue delay, prejudice, bad
faith, or futility. This aligns with the proposition that leave to amend should
be freely given when justice requires, especially to cure pleading
deficiencies.

For example, it is clear beyond hope of contradiction that the Civil Rules
permit a party to amend its complaint 'once as a matter of course at anytime
before a responsive pleading is served.' Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a). An amended
complaint, once filed, normally supersedes the antecedent complaint. ...
Amendments as of right under Rule 15(a) operate 'as a matter of course,'
and do not require a judicial imprimatur.
Summary
Permissibility of amending a complaint under Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 15(a), emphasizing that amendments can be made as a matter of
course before a responsive pleading is served. This supports the proposition
that leave to amend should be freely given, especially when new facts may
cure deficiencies. The passage also notes that an amended complaint
supersedes the original, aligning with the idea that new facts can be added
to support the case.

Bureau of Investigation, 851 F.2d 1202, 1206 (9th Cir.1988) (citations
omitted). Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a) provides that a trial court
should grant leave to amend 'freely when justice so requires.' In deciding
whether justice requires granting leave to amend, factors to be considered
include the presence or absence of undue delay, bad faith, dilatory motive,
repeated failure to cure deficiencies by previous amendments, undue
prejudice to the opposing party and futility of the proposed amendment.

Standard for granting leave to amend under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
15(a), emphasizing that leave should be granted freely when justice requires
it. It also outlines factors to consider, such as undue delay, bad faith, and
futility, which align with the proposition that new facts may cure pleading
deficiencies. The reference to Foman v. Davis supports the idea that
amendments should be allowed to address deficiencies.

Rule 15(a)(2) further indicates that '[t]he court should freely give leave [to

Consistent with this rule, we have held that '[t]he purpose of [ Rule 15(a)

decided on its merits rather than on procedural niceties.'
Summary
The passage directly references Rule 15(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure, which states that leave to amend should be freely given when
justice requires. This aligns with the proposition that amendments should be
allowed to cure deficiencies and ensure claims are decided on their merits.
The passage also emphasizes the purpose of Rule 15(a)(2) to maximize the
opportunity for claims to be decided on their merits, supporting the idea
that amendments should be permitted to add new facts that may address
pleading deficiencies.
Keith v. Volpe, 858 F.2d 467 (9th Cir. 1988)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Ninth Circuit
Extract
We hold that allowing the supplemental complaint was well within the
district court's discretion under Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(d), which is designed to
permit expansion of the scope of existing litigation to include events that
occur after the filing of the original complaint. ... Rule 15, Fed.R.Civ.P.,
authorizes supplemental complaints for such a purpose. It provides that
'[u]pon motion of a party the court may, upon reasonable notice and upon
such terms as are just, permit the party to serve a supplemental pleading
setting forth transactions or occurrences or events which have happened
since the date of the pleading sought to be supplemented.' Fed.R.Civ.P.
15(d).
Summary
Discretion afforded to district courts under Rule 15(d) to allow supplemental
complaints that include events occurring after the original complaint was
filed. This supports the proposition that leave to amend should be freely
given to include new facts that may cure pleading deficiencies, as it
emphasizes the court's discretion to expand the scope of litigation to include
new developments.

106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989)
U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
Continuity is both a closed- and open-ended concept, referring either to a
closed period of repeated conduct, or to past conduct that by its nature
projects into the future with a threat of repetition. ... A party alleging a
RICO violation may demonstrate continuity over a closed period by proving
a series of related predicates extending over a substantial period of time.
Predicate acts extending over a few weeks or months and threatening no
future criminal conduct do not satisfy this requirement: Congress was
concerned in RICO with long-term criminal conduct. Often a RICO action
will be brought before continuity can be established in this way. In such
cases, liability depends on whether the threat of continuity is demonstrated.
Summary
Concept of continuity in the context of RICO violations, explaining that
continuity can be demonstrated through a closed period of repeated conduct
or through past conduct that projects into the future with a threat of
repetition. This aligns with the proposition that if current allegations are
insufficient, a plaintiff should be allowed to amend the complaint to include
additional facts that may demonstrate open-ended continuity. The passage
supports the idea that demonstrating continuity is crucial in RICO cases and
that new facts can be relevant to establishing this continuity.

Summary
The passage confirms that the discretion to grant leave to amend pleadings
is vested in the trial court, as established in Foman v. Davis. This supports
the proposition that leave to amend should be freely given when justice
requires, especially to cure deficiencies, as it aligns with the principle that
courts have the discretion to allow amendments to ensure justice.

U.S. Court of Appeals — Sixth Circuit
Extract
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15 provides that leave to amend 'shall be
freely given when justice so requires.' Fed. R.Civ.P. 15(a). The Supreme
Court, commenting on the mandate in Rule 15(a), stated: In the absence of
any apparent or declared reason — such as undue delay, bad faith or dilatory
motive on the part of the movant, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by
amendments previously allowed, undue prejudice to the opposing party by
virtue of allowance of the amendment, futility of the amendment, etc. — the
leave sought should, as the rules require, be 'freely given.' Foman v. Davis,
371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S.Ct. 227, 9 L.Ed.2d 222 (1962).
Summary
Rule 15(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure emphasizes that leave to
amend should be freely given when justice requires it. The Supreme Court in
Foman v. Davis supports this by stating that unless there are specific
reasons such as undue delay or prejudice, amendments should be allowed.
This aligns with the proposition that if current allegations are insufficient,
leave to amend should be granted to allow the plaintiff to add new facts and
cure deficiencies.

When a court grants a motion to dismiss a complaint, it must then decide
whether to grant leave to amend. Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962)
(noting that leave to amend is within discretion of district court). Leave to
amend 'shall be freely given when justice so requires,' Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a),
and 'this policy is to be applied with extreme liberality.' Morongo Band of
Mission Indians v. Rose, 893 F.2d 1074, 1079 (9th Cir. 1990).
Summary
Standard for granting leave to amend a complaint after a motion to dismiss
has been granted. It cites Foman v. Davis and Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a),
emphasizing that leave to amend should be freely given when justice
requires, and this policy is applied with extreme liberality. This directly
supports the proposition that if the court finds the current allegations
insufficient, it should grant leave to amend to allow the plaintiff to plead
additional facts.

U.S. District Court — District of Connecticut
Extract
Although the Federal Rules provide that the court should 'freely give leave
[to amend] when justice so requires', Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2), the court may
deny leave to amend when it would be futile, or when the substance of the
claim to be amended is frivolous on its face.
Summary
The passage explicitly references Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a)(2),
which states that leave to amend should be freely given when justice
requires. This aligns with the proposition that leave to amend should be
granted to allow the plaintiff to add new facts that may cure pleading
deficiencies. The passage also notes that leave to amend can be denied if it
would be futile or if the claim is frivolous, which is consistent with the legal
standards for granting such motions.

Extract
Leave ordinarily must be granted unless one or more of the following factors
is present: (1) undue delay, (2) bad faith or dilatory motive, (3) repeated
failure to cure deficiencies by amendment, (4) undue prejudice to the
opposing party, and (5) futility of amendment. Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S.

1048, 1052 (9th Cir. 2003) (discussing Foman factors).
Summary
The passage references the Foman v. Davis case, which is a seminal case
regarding the standard for granting leave to amend under Rule 15(a). It
outlines the factors that may justify denying leave to amend, emphasizing
that leave should be freely given unless specific negative factors are
present. This aligns with the proposition that leave to amend should be
granted to allow the addition of new facts unless there are compelling
reasons not to.
Rumanek v. Fallon, CIVIL ACTION NO. 1:17-CV-123 (D. Del. Sep 17, 2018)
U.S. District Court — District of Delaware
Extract
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a)(2) directs the court to 'freely give
leave [to amend] when justice so requires.' FED. R. CIV. P. 15(a)(2). The
decision whether to grant leave to amend is committed to the sound
discretion of the district court. See Lorenz v. CSX Corp., 1 F.3d 1406, 1413
(3d Cir. 1993) (citing Bechtel v. Robinson, 886 F.2d 644, 647 (3d Cir. 1989)).
Under this standard, courts generally will grant leave to amend unless the
opposing party can establish undue delay, bad faith on the part of the
movant, futility of amendment, or prejudice to the nonmoving party.
Summary
Standard under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a)(2), which directs
courts to "freely give leave [to amend] when justice so requires." This aligns
with the proposition that leave to amend should be granted to allow the
plaintiff to add new facts, especially if they may cure pleading deficiencies.
The passage also notes that courts generally grant leave to amend unless
there are specific reasons not to, such as undue delay or futility, which
supports the idea that leave should be granted if the current allegations are
insufficient.

Boulton v. Am. Transfer Servs., Inc., CASE NO. 14cv00175-GPC-RBB (S.D.
Cal. Aug 05, 2014)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of California
Extract
Based on the reasoning below, the Court GRANTS in part and DENIES in
part Plaintiff's motion for leave to file a second amended complaint...
Defendants do not assert that granting Plaintiff leave to file a second
amendment complaint to add a civil RICO claim would be futile, sought in
bad faith, would create undue delay or otherwise prejudice Defendants.
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff's motion for leave to file a second
amended complaint to add civil RICO as a cause of action.
Summary
The court granted the plaintiff's motion for leave to amend the complaint to
add a civil RICO claim. The court's decision was based on the absence of any
assertion by the defendants that the amendment would be futile, sought in
bad faith, create undue delay, or prejudice the defendants. This aligns with
the principle that leave to amend should be freely given when justice so
requires, as stated in Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a) and supported by the precedent in
Foman v. Davis.

Finally, the plaintiff requests that if the defendants' motion is granted, that
he be given leave to replead his claims. Fed. R.Civ.P. 15(a) provides that
'leave [to amend a pleading] shall be freely given when justice so
requires.' ... Applying these standards, the Court grants the plaintiff's
motion for leave to replead. ... Curing any of these defects would revive his
claims. Accordingly, construing Rule 15 liberally, and in the interests of
justice, the plaintiff's motion for leave to replead is granted.
Summary
Court's application of Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a), which states that leave to amend
should be freely given when justice requires. The court granted the
plaintiff's motion for leave to replead, noting that curing the defects in the
original pleading would revive the claims. This aligns with the proposition
that leave to amend should be granted to allow the plaintiff to add new facts
and cure deficiencies.

F.2d 132, 280 U.S.App. D.C. 60 (D.C. Cir. 1989)
U.S. Court of Appeals — District of Columbia Circuit
Extract
Finally, we hold that the district court abused its discretion to the extent
that it relied on lack of timeliness to justify its refusal to grant leave to
amend. Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a) declares that leave to amend 'shall be freely given
when justice so requires.' As the Supreme Court forcefully stated in Foman
v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S.Ct. 227, 230, 9 L.Ed.2d 222 (1962), 'this
mandate is to be heeded.' These pleading rules were designed to facilitate a
proper decision on the merits, and the opportunity to test the merits should
ordinarily be accommodated if injustice will not otherwise result.
Summary
Principle that leave to amend should be freely given when justice requires,
as stated in Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a) and reinforced by the Supreme Court in
Foman v. Davis. The court in this case found that the district court abused its
discretion by denying leave to amend based on timeliness, emphasizing that
the rules are designed to allow a proper decision on the merits. This
supports the proposition that if current allegations are insufficient, leave to
amend should be granted to allow the plaintiff to add new facts and cure
deficiencies.

"Rule 15(a) provides that 'leave [to amend a pleading] shall be freely given
when justice so requires.' The Supreme Court has held that only 'undue
delay, bad faith, or dilatory motive on the part of the movant, repeated
failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed, undue
prejudice to the opposing party ... [or] futility of the amendment' will serve
to prevent an amendment prior to trial." Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 83
S.Ct. 227, 9 L.Ed.2d 222 (1962).
Summary
The passage from "Bernstein v. Misk" references Rule 15(a) and the
Supreme Court's decision in Foman v. Davis, which are both authoritative
sources on the standard for granting leave to amend pleadings. The passage
emphasizes that leave to amend should be freely given unless specific
exceptions apply, such as undue delay or futility. This aligns with the

U.S. Court of Appeals — Ninth Circuit
Extract
If a complaint is dismissed for failure to state a claim, leave to amend should
be granted 'unless the court determines that the allegation of other facts
consistent with the challenged pleading could not possibly cure the
deficiency.'
Summary
The passage from "DeSoto v. Yellow Freight Systems, Inc." supports the
proposition by emphasizing the principle that leave to amend should be
granted unless it is clear that no set of facts could cure the deficiencies in
the complaint. This aligns with the general rule under Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)
that amendments should be freely given when justice requires, especially
when new facts could potentially address the issues in the original pleading.

Gabrielson v. Montgomery Ward & Co., 785 F.2d 762, 765 (9th Cir.1986).
Summary
The passage highlights that the denial of leave to amend is subject to strict
review due to the strong policy favoring amendments. This aligns with the
proposition that leave to amend should be freely given when justice
requires, especially to cure deficiencies. The reference to the review for
abuse of discretion underscores the court's obligation to consider
amendments favorably unless there is a compelling reason not to.

=== PAGE 22 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
U.S. Court of Appeals — Ninth Circuit
Extract
Generally, Rule 15 advises the court that 'leave shall be freely given when
justice so requires.' This policy is 'to be applied with extreme liberality.' ...
Absent prejudice, or a strong showing of any of the remaining Foman
factors, there exists a presumption under Rule 15(a) in favor of granting
leave to amend. ... We do not quarrel with the district judge's assessment
that the First Amended Consolidated Complaint was deficient. However, we
believe that the district court did not appropriately exercise its discretion by
denying plaintiffs leave to amend where, as here, plaintiffs' allegations were
not frivolous, plaintiffs were endeavoring in good faith to meet the
heightened pleading requirements and to comply with court guidance, and,
most importantly, it appears that plaintiffs had a reasonable chance of
successfully stating a claim if given another opportunity.
Summary
The passage emphasizes the liberal policy of granting leave to amend under
Rule 15(a) unless there is a strong reason not to, such as prejudice or other
Foman factors. It highlights that the court should allow amendments when
plaintiffs are acting in good faith and have a reasonable chance of success.
This supports the proposition that leave to amend should be granted to allow
the plaintiff to add new facts and cure deficiencies.

Summary
The passage references the standard for reviewing a denial of a motion for
leave to amend under Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a), which is relevant to the proposition
that leave to amend should be freely given when justice so requires. The
mention of "review is for an abuse of discretion" indicates that the court's
decision to deny leave to amend is subject to review, supporting the idea
that such leave should be granted unless there is a clear reason not to. This
aligns with the principle that amendments should be allowed to cure
deficiencies, as stated in the proposition.

DCD Programs, Ltd. v. Leighton, 833 F.2d 183 (9th Cir. 1987)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Ninth Circuit
Extract
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a) provides that a party may amend their
complaint once 'as a matter of course' before a responsive pleading is
served, after that the 'party may amend the party's pleading only by leave of
court or by written consent of the adverse party and leave shall be freely
given when justice so requires.' Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a). Thus 'after a brief period
in which a party may amend as of right,' leave to amend lies 'within the
sound discretion of the trial court.' United States v. Webb, 655 F.2d 977, 979
(9th Cir.1981). ... This liberality in granting leave to amend is not dependent
on whether the amendment will add causes of action or parties. It is,
however, subject to the qualification that amendment of the complaint does
not cause the opposing party undue prejudice, Acri v. International Ass'n of
Machinists, 781 F.2d 1393, 1398-99 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 107

1293.
Summary
The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure encourage granting leave to amend
pleadings when justice requires it. The passage emphasizes the liberal
approach to amendments, provided they do not cause undue prejudice, are
not in bad faith, and are not futile. This aligns with the proposition that
leave to amend should be granted to allow the plaintiff to add new facts and
cure deficiencies.

Summary
Application of Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a), which states that leave to amend should be
freely given when justice requires. The court emphasizes a strong liberality
in allowing amendments, which aligns with the proposition that amendments
should be permitted to cure deficiencies and add new facts. This supports
the idea that if current allegations are insufficient, the court should allow
amendments to include additional facts.

(9th Cir. 1986)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Ninth Circuit
Extract
Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a) provides, inter alia, that 'a party may amend his pleading
once as a matter of course at any time before a responsive pleading is
served....' We have stated that '[a] motion to dismiss is not a "responsive
pleading" within the meaning of the Rule. Neither the filing nor granting of
such a motion before answer terminates the right to amend; an order of
dismissal denying leave to amend at that state is improper....' Mayes, 729 F.
2d at 607 (quoting Breier v. Northern California Bowling Proprietors'
Association, 316 F.2d 787, 789 (9th Cir.1963)). If a complaint is dismissed
for failure to state a claim, leave to amend should be granted unless the
court determines that the allegation of other facts consistent with the
challenged pleading could not possibly cure the deficiency.
Summary
Application of Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a), which allows a party to amend their
pleading before a responsive pleading is served. It emphasizes that a motion
to dismiss is not a responsive pleading, and thus, the right to amend is not
terminated by such a motion. The passage further states that leave to amend
should be granted unless it is determined that no additional facts could cure
the deficiencies in the complaint. This aligns with the proposition that leave
to amend should be freely given to allow the plaintiff to add new facts that
may address pleading deficiencies.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
several factors to be considered when applying Rule 15(a): If the underlying
facts or circumstances relied upon by a plaintiff may be a proper subject of
relief, he ought to be afforded an opportunity to test his claim on the merits.
In the absence of any apparent or declared reason--such as undue delay, bad
faith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant, repeated failure to cure
deficiencies by amendments previously allowed, undue prejudice to the
opposing party by virtue of allowance of the amendment, futility of
amendment, etc.--the leave sought should, as the rules require, be 'freely
given.'
Summary
The passage from "Lorenz v. CSX Corp." discusses the application of
Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a), which states that leave to amend should be freely given
when justice requires. The passage also references the Supreme Court's
guidance on factors to consider when deciding whether to grant leave to
amend, such as the absence of undue delay, bad faith, or futility of
amendment. This aligns with the proposition that leave to amend should be
granted to allow the plaintiff to add new facts that may cure pleading
deficiencies.

U.S. Court of Appeals — Ninth Circuit
Extract
This amendment policy is informed by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a),
which provides that leave to amend should be freely granted 'when justice
so requires.' Although Rule 15(a) gives the trial court discretion over this
matter, we have repeatedly stressed that the court must remain guided by
'the underlying purpose of Rule 15... to facilitate decision on the merits,
rather than on the pleadings or technicalities.' ... As noted above, Federal
Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a) provides that a trial court shall grant leave to
amend freely 'when justice so requires.' The Supreme Court has stated that
'this mandate is to be heeded.' Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962). In
addition, we have repeatedly held that 'a district court should grant leave to
amend even if no request to amend the pleading was made, unless it
determines that the pleading could not possibly be cured by the allegation of
other facts.'
Summary
The passage emphasizes the liberal policy of granting leave to amend under
Rule 15(a) when justice requires it. It highlights the purpose of Rule 15 to
facilitate decisions on the merits rather than on technicalities. The passage
also references the Supreme Court's mandate in Foman v. Davis that this
policy should be followed. The Ninth Circuit's precedent further supports
granting leave to amend unless it is clear that the pleading cannot be cured
by additional facts. This aligns with the proposition that leave to amend

The 'continuity' prong is satisfied by proof of either closed-ended continuity
or open-ended continuity. Closed-ended continuity is defined as 'a series of
related predicates extending over a substantial period of time.' Open-ended
continuity is defined as conduct that may last only a short period of time but
nonetheless, poses a threat of extending into the future. The Court
suggested a case-by-case examination of this issue, noting that the existence
of a 'threat of continued racketeering activity' is a function of particular
facts.
Summary
The concept of continuity in RICO cases can be satisfied by demonstrating
either closed-ended or open-ended continuity. Open-ended continuity, in
particular, is relevant to the proposition as it involves conduct that poses a
threat of extending into the future, which aligns with the Plaintiff's request
to amend the complaint to include new facts and predicate acts. The
passage supports the idea that new facts may cure pleading deficiencies by

A client may also benefit from amendment of the complaint before, or

evaluating any arguments for dismissal—or adding or amending allegations
based on further information learned during post-filing investigation.
Summary
Strategic benefits of amending a complaint, particularly in the context of
federal civil procedure. It highlights that early amendment can address
pleading deficiencies, add crucial details, and strengthen a complaint to
survive a motion to dismiss. This aligns with the proposition that leave to

or the court's leave. The court should freely give leave when justice so
requires.' ... The Court must therefore balance the relevant factors in
deciding whether to allow the First Amended Complaint. ... The record does
not present evidence of bad faith, dilatory motive, or futility. Respondent has
not opposed the motion, and the Court does not find undue prejudice to
Respondent at this juncture. Accordingly, the Court will grant Complainant's
motion.
Summary
Application of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a), which states that leave
to amend should be freely given when justice requires. The court in this case
considered factors such as the absence of bad faith, dilatory motive, futility,
and undue prejudice to the respondent, ultimately granting the motion to
amend. This aligns with the proposition that leave to amend should be
granted to cure pleading deficiencies and add new facts.

guidance in federal case law. Like the United States Court of Appeals for the
Fifth Circuit, the federal judicial circuit in which this case arises, the Court
is guided by the United States Supreme Court's reasoning in Foman v. Davis,
371 U.S. 178 . ... Specifically, the Court will give leave to amend freely '[i]n
the absence of any apparent or declared reason—such as undue delay, bad
faith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant, repeated failure to cure
deficiencies by amendments previously allowed, undue prejudice to the
opposing party by virtue of allowance of the amendment, futility of
amendment, etc.' ... Therefore, the Court gives leave to amend the
complaint. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a) ('The court should freely give leave when
justice so requires.')
Summary
Application of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a) and the Supreme
Court's decision in Foman v. Davis, which are both directly relevant to the
proposition. The passage explains that leave to amend should be freely given
unless there are specific reasons not to, such as undue delay or prejudice.
This aligns with the proposition that leave to amend should be granted to
allow the plaintiff to add new facts and cure deficiencies.

Extract
Plaintiff had requested leave to amend in a footnote. The district court
determined that a separate motion for leave to amend would be required,
but that the dismissal would be without prejudice, because new facts to
support plaintiff's claims might emerge through then-pending antitrust
litigation. ... The district court denied the motion to reconsider, but granted
leave to amend, clarifying that it 'ha[d] not yet reviewed the proposed

amended complaint if there are 'genuinely new facts that are materially
different.'
