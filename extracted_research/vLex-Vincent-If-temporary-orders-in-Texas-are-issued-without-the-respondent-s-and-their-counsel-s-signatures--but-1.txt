Question
If temporary orders in Texas are issued without the respondent's and their
counsel's signatures, but explicitly state 'as evidenced by the signatures
below all parties agreed' and 'AGREED AND CONSENTED TO' on the
signature page, are they enforceable by law enforcement?
Answer (Texas)
Short response
Temporary orders in Texas that state parties have agreed but lack the
respondent's and counsel's signatures may be legally questionable and
difficult to enforce by law enforcement, particularly if the respondent
challenges the order's validity. The enforceability depends on whether
proper notice and hearing requirements were met and whether the order
clearly and unambiguously states the terms for compliance, rather than
solely on the presence of signatures.
Summary
The enforceability of temporary orders in Texas that indicate agreement but
lack the respondent's and counsel's signatures involves complex
considerations of statutory requirements and case law principles. While
Texas Family Code provides that temporary orders are enforceable under
Chapter 157 and violations are punishable by contempt, the absence of
signatures on orders that explicitly claim agreement creates a contradiction
that may undermine their enforceability, particularly if challenged. In In re
Russell, 321 S.W.3d 846 (Tex. App. 2010), the court held that a signature
under "Approved and Agreed," standing alone, does not establish consent—
suggesting that the mere recitation of agreement without actual signatures
is even more problematic.
The enforceability question is further complicated by procedural
requirements for temporary orders, which generally require notice and
hearing before issuance. While temporary orders are binding on parties who
receive notice, the discrepancy between the stated agreement and missing
signatures raises due process concerns. For law enforcement to enforce
such orders, they must state in clear and unambiguous terms what the
respondent must do to comply, as established in Ex parte Brister, 801 S.W.2d
833 (Tex. 1990). The inconsistency between the claimed agreement and
missing signatures creates ambiguity that might render the order
unenforceable through contempt proceedings or by law enforcement.

Background and Relevant Law
Statutory Framework
The Texas Family Code provides the statutory basis for temporary orders in
family law cases. Under Section 105.001 of the Texas Family Code, a court
may issue temporary orders in suits affecting the parent-child relationship
for the safety and welfare of the child. The 2025 version of this statute
states: "Temporary orders rendered under this section are not subject to
interlocutory appeal. The violation of a temporary restraining order,
temporary injunction, or other temporary order rendered under this section
is punishable by contempt and the order is subject to and enforceable under
Chapter 157." Tex. Fam. Code § 105.001. This provision establishes that
temporary orders are enforceable and violations can be punished through
contempt proceedings, which is a significant aspect of law enforcement's
ability to enforce such orders.
The enforceability of agreed orders is specifically addressed in Section
85.005(b) of the Texas Family Code, which provides that "An agreed
protective order is enforceable civilly or criminally, regardless of whether
the court makes the findings required by Section FAMILY CODE 85.001." 
Tex. Fam. Code § 85.005(b). This provision suggests that agreed orders can
be enforced without meeting certain procedural requirements, but it does
not specifically address the necessity of signatures to validate the
agreement.
Additionally, Section 157.001 of the Texas Family Code addresses the
enforcement of temporary orders: "(a) A motion for enforcement as provided
in this chapter may be filed to enforce any provision of a temporary or final
order rendered in a suit. (b) The court may enforce by contempt any
provision of a temporary or final order." Tex. Fam. Code § 157.001(a)-(b).
The statute further clarifies that "'temporary order' includes a temporary
restraining order, standing order, injunction, and any other temporary order
rendered by a court." Tex. Fam. Code § 157.001(e). This provision
establishes the general enforceability of temporary orders in Texas, without
specifically addressing signature requirements.
Case Law on Agreement and Signatures
The Texas Court of Appeals addressed a similar issue in In re Russell, 321
S.W.3d 846 (Tex. App. 2010), where the court examined whether signatures
on a document established consent to a temporary order. The court noted:
"The August 3, 2006 temporary orders recite that '[t]he parties have agreed
to the terms of this order as evidenced by their signatures on the Associate
Judge's recommendation on file in this cause.' But nowhere in the associate
judge's report, which Chassidie and her counsel signed, is section 153.3161
or David's possible deployment mentioned. Nor does the report contain any
explicit 'agreement' as to factual allegations that would support standing
under the family code." In re Russell, 321 S.W.3d 846 (Tex. App. 2010).

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
The court in Russell went on to cite an important principle from earlier case
law: "See, e.g., Oryx Energy Co. v. Union Nat'l Bank of Tex., 895 S.W.2d 409,
416-17 (Tex.App.-San Antonio 1995, writ denied) (holding that signature
underneath heading 'Approved and Agreed,' standing alone, does not
establish consent judgment)." In re Russell, 321 S.W.3d 846 (Tex. App.
2010). This principle suggests that even when signatures are present under
a heading indicating agreement, additional evidence of consent may be
necessary to establish a true agreed order. By extension, if signatures
themselves are insufficient to establish consent, the absence of signatures
on an order claiming agreement would be even more problematic for
enforceability.
Notice and Hearing Requirements
Several Texas cases emphasize that temporary orders in suits affecting the
parent-child relationship require notice and a hearing before they can be
rendered, with limited exceptions for emergency situations. In In re Farmer,
the court stated: "In a suit affecting the parent-child relationship, the trial
court may make a temporary order for the safety and welfare of the child,
including an order modifying a prior temporary order. TEX. FAM. CODE
ANN. § 105.001(a)... Other than an emergency order sought by a
governmental entity, an order may not be rendered under section 105.001(a)
(1), (2), or (5) except after notice and a hearing. Id. § 105.001(b), (h)..." In re
Farmer.
Similarly, in In re Chester, 357 S.W.3d 103 (Tex. App. 2011), the court
emphasized: "In a suit affecting the parent-child relationship, the trial court
may make a temporary order for the safety and welfare of the child,
including an order modifying a prior temporary order. Tex. Fam.Code Ann. §
105.001(a) (West 2008). A temporary order for the conservatorship of the
child may not be rendered without notice and a hearing. Tex. Fam.Code Ann.
§ 105.001(a), (b), (h); Herring, 221 S.W.3d at 730." In re Chester, 357 S.W.3d
103 (Tex. App. 2011). This emphasizes that due process, including proper
notice and the opportunity for a hearing, is a critical component of
enforceability for temporary orders.
The court in In re K.M., NO. 12-18-00044-CV (Tex. App. Apr 18, 2018) also
reaffirmed these requirements, stating: "Other than an emergency order
sought by a governmental entity, an order may not be rendered under
section 105.001(a)(1), (2), or (5) except after notice and a hearing." In re
K.M., NO. 12-18-00044-CV (Tex. App. Apr 18, 2018).
Requirements for Enforceability by Contempt
The Texas Supreme Court has established clear principles for when an order
is enforceable through contempt proceedings, which is relevant to law
enforcement's ability to enforce temporary orders. In Ex parte Brister, 801
S.W.2d 833 (Tex. 1990), the court held: "To be enforceable by contempt a
judgment must set out the terms for compliance in clear and unambiguous
terms. See, e.g., Ex parte Reese, 701 S.W.2d 840 (Tex.1986); Ex parte Slavin,
412 S.W.2d 43 (Tex.1967). The judgment must also clearly order the party to

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
perform the required acts. See Ex parte Gorena, 595 S.W.2d 841, 845 (Tex.
1979)." Ex parte Brister, 801 S.W.2d 833 (Tex. 1990).
This principle was also applied in In re Sherry Lemons, 47 S.W.3d 202 (Tex.
App. 2001), where the court stated: "The order does not state in clear and
unambiguous terms what John Lemons must do to comply with the judgment
and thus, is unenforceable by Sherry. See Ex parte Brister, 801 S.W.2d 833,
834-35 (Tex. 1990)." In re Sherry Lemons, 47 S.W.3d 202 (Tex. App. 2001).
These cases establish that for an order to be enforceable through contempt
proceedings, it must clearly and unambiguously state what the party must
do to comply.
Binding Effect of Temporary Orders
In Ayala v. Minniti, 714 S.W.2d 452 (Tex. App. 1986), the court addressed the
binding effect of temporary injunctions: "This temporary injunction is
effective immediately and shall continue in full force and effect until further
order of this Court or until it expires by operation of law. This order shall be
binding on respondent, on respondent's attorneys, agents, servants and
employees, and on those persons in active concern [sic] or participation with
them who receive notice of this order by personal service or otherwise." 
Ayala v. Minniti, 714 S.W.2d 452 (Tex. App. 1986). This case suggests that
temporary orders can be effective and binding when the parties have agreed
and stipulated to them, and they are binding on those who receive notice of
the order.
Analysis
Legal Status of Unsigned "Agreed" Temporary Orders
The central question is whether temporary orders that state they are agreed
to but lack the signatures of the respondent and their counsel can be
enforced by law enforcement. The Texas Family Code clearly establishes that
temporary orders are enforceable under Chapter 157 and violations are
punishable by contempt. However, the absence of signatures on orders that
explicitly claim agreement creates a contradiction that may undermine their
enforceability.
The case of In re Russell, 321 S.W.3d 846 (Tex. App. 2010) is particularly
instructive. In Russell, the court examined a situation where temporary
orders recited that parties had agreed to the terms as evidenced by their
signatures, but the court found that the signatures alone did not establish
consent to all aspects of the order. The court cited the principle that
"signature underneath heading 'Approved and Agreed,' standing alone, does
not establish consent judgment." In re Russell, 321 S.W.3d 846 (Tex. App.
2010). If signatures alone are insufficient to establish consent, then the
absence of signatures on an order claiming agreement would be even more
problematic for enforceability.
The scenario described in the question presents an even greater
inconsistency: the order explicitly states "as evidenced by the signatures

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
below all parties agreed" and "AGREED AND CONSENTED TO" on the
signature page, yet the signatures of the respondent and counsel are
missing. This internal contradiction could undermine the credibility and
enforceability of the order, as it falsely claims evidence of agreement that
does not exist.
Procedural Requirements for Temporary Orders
The enforceability of temporary orders also depends on whether proper
procedural requirements were followed in their issuance. Multiple cases,
including In re Farmer, In re Chester, 357 S.W.3d 103 (Tex. App. 2011), and 
In re K.M., NO. 12-18-00044-CV (Tex. App. Apr 18, 2018), emphasize that
temporary orders require notice and a hearing before they can be rendered,
except in limited emergency situations.
If the temporary orders in question were issued without these procedural
safeguards, their enforceability would be questionable regardless of the
signature issue. The missing signatures might suggest that the respondent
did not participate in or receive notice of the proceedings, raising due
process concerns that could render the orders unenforceable.
Requirements for Contempt Enforcement
For law enforcement to enforce temporary orders through contempt
proceedings, the orders must meet certain standards of clarity and
specificity. The Texas Supreme Court established in Ex parte Brister, 801
S.W.2d 833 (Tex. 1990) that to be enforceable by contempt, a judgment must
"set out the terms for compliance in clear and unambiguous terms" and
"clearly order the party to perform the required acts." Ex parte Brister, 801
S.W.2d 833 (Tex. 1990).
The inconsistency between the claimed agreement and the missing
signatures creates ambiguity that might render the order unenforceable
through contempt proceedings. If the order falsely claims that parties
agreed "as evidenced by the signatures below" when those signatures are
absent, this could be seen as a lack of the clarity and unambiguity required
for contempt enforcement.
Binding Effect on Parties with Notice
In Ayala v. Minniti, 714 S.W.2d 452 (Tex. App. 1986), the court noted that
temporary orders are "binding on respondent, on respondent's attorneys,
agents, servants and employees, and on those persons in active concern or
participation with them who receive notice of this order by personal service
or otherwise." Ayala v. Minniti, 714 S.W.2d 452 (Tex. App. 1986). This
suggests that receipt of notice, rather than signatures, might be the key
factor in determining whether the order is binding on the respondent.
However, if the respondent never received notice of the order or had the
opportunity to participate in the proceedings, the absence of signatures
could corroborate a claim that they were not properly notified, potentially
undermining the order's enforceability.

Exceptions and Caveats
Emergency Orders
Section 105.001 of the Texas Family Code contains exceptions for
emergency orders sought by governmental entities, which may be issued
without notice and hearing. Tex. Fam. Code § 105.001. If the temporary
orders in question were issued as emergency orders by a governmental
entity, different procedural requirements would apply. However, even in
such cases, the false claim of agreement evidenced by signatures would still
present issues for enforceability.
Agreed Protective Orders
Section 85.005(b) of the Texas Family Code specifically addresses agreed
protective orders, stating they are "enforceable civilly or criminally,
regardless of whether the court makes the findings required by Section
FAMILY CODE 85.001." Tex. Fam. Code § 85.005(b). This suggests that
agreed orders may be enforced without meeting certain procedural
requirements. However, this provision assumes that the orders are
genuinely agreed to by the parties. The absence of signatures on an order
claiming agreement raises doubts about whether there was actual
agreement, potentially removing it from the scope of this provision.
Evidence of Agreement Outside the Document
It's worth noting that evidence of agreement might exist outside the four
corners of the document. For instance, the parties might have orally agreed
to the terms on the record in court, even if they did not sign the final
document. In Ayala v. Minniti, 714 S.W.2d 452 (Tex. App. 1986), the court
considered dialogue from the hearing where the parties indicated
agreement, not just the signatures on the document. However, if no such
external evidence exists, the contradiction between the claimed agreement
and missing signatures becomes more problematic.
Conclusion
Based on the provided legal authorities, temporary orders in Texas that state
they are agreed to but lack the signatures of the respondent and their
counsel present significant enforceability challenges, particularly if the
respondent contests the order's validity. While Texas Family Code Section
105.001 establishes that temporary orders are generally enforceable and
violations are punishable by contempt, the absence of signatures on orders
that explicitly claim agreement creates a contradiction that undermines
their enforceability.
The case of In re Russell, 321 S.W.3d 846 (Tex. App. 2010) suggests that
even when signatures are present, they may not be sufficient to establish
consent to all aspects of an order. By extension, the absence of signatures on
an order claiming agreement would be even more problematic for

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
enforceability, particularly given the internal contradiction created by
statements like "as evidenced by the signatures below all parties agreed"
when those signatures are absent.
For law enforcement to enforce temporary orders, they must meet the
standards established in Ex parte Brister, 801 S.W.2d 833 (Tex. 1990) - they
must "set out the terms for compliance in clear and unambiguous terms"
and "clearly order the party to perform the required acts." The inconsistency
between the claimed agreement and missing signatures creates ambiguity
that might render the order unenforceable through contempt proceedings or
by law enforcement.
Additionally, temporary orders generally require notice and hearing before
issuance, as emphasized in cases like In re Farmer, In re Chester, 357 S.W.
3d 103 (Tex. App. 2011), and In re K.M., NO. 12-18-00044-CV (Tex. App. Apr
18, 2018). If the temporary orders were issued without these procedural
safeguards, their enforceability would be questionable regardless of the
signature issue.
In conclusion, while temporary orders in Texas are generally enforceable
under Chapter 157 of the Family Code, the specific scenario described—
orders claiming agreement evidenced by signatures that are actually absent
—presents a contradiction that would likely lead to challenges in
enforcement by law enforcement, particularly if the respondent contests the
validity of the order. The false claim of agreement evidenced by signatures
that do not exist undermines the clarity and unambiguity required for
contempt enforcement under Ex parte Brister, 801 S.W.2d 833 (Tex. 1990).
Law enforcement agencies faced with such orders may be reluctant to
enforce them, particularly if the respondent raises valid objections about the
absence of signatures and the false claim of agreement.

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
The passage discusses a situation where temporary orders recited that
parties agreed to the terms, but the signatures alone did not establish an
agreed order because there was no explicit agreement on factual allegations
supporting standing. This suggests that merely stating that parties agreed,
without their signatures or explicit agreement on the record, may not be
sufficient to enforce the order.
In re Farmer
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
In a suit affecting the parent-child relationship, the trial court may make a
temporary order for the safety and welfare of the child, including an order
modifying a prior temporary order. TEX. FAM. CODE ANN. § 105.001(a).
Specifically, section 105.001(a) of the Texas Family Code provides that, in a
suit affecting the parent-child relationship, a trial court may make a
temporary order for the child's safety and welfare, including an order (1) for
the temporary conservatorship of the child, (2) for the temporary support of
the child, (3) to restrain a party from disturbing the peace of the child or
another party, (4) to prohibit a person from removing the child beyond a
geographical area identified by the court, or (5) for payment of reasonable
attorney's fees and expenses. Id. Other than an emergency order sought by
a governmental entity, an order may not be rendered under section
105.001(a)(1), (2), or (5) except after notice and a hearing. Id. § 105.001(b),
(h); see In re L.A.-K., 596 S.W.3d 387, 396 (Tex. App.-El Paso 2020, no pet.)
(concluding that Chapter 105, rather than Chapter 156, of the Texas Family
Code applies to a challenge to temporary orders denying a Father access to
and possession of the child without giving him notice and an opportunity to
be heard); In re Chester, 357 S.W.3d 103, 107 (Tex. App.- San Antonio 2011,
orig. proceeding) (noting that a parent is entitled to notice and an adversary
hearing before entry of a temporary order modifying custody); In re K.L.R.,
162 S.W.3d 291, 301 (Tex. App.-Tyler 2005, no pet.).
Summary
Temporary orders in suits affecting the parent-child relationship in Texas
require notice and a hearing before they can be rendered, except in
emergency situations. This implies that the enforceability of such orders is
contingent upon proper procedural adherence, including notice and hearing,
rather than merely the presence of signatures or statements of agreement.
In re Sherry Lemons, 47 S.W.3d 202 (Tex. App. 2001)
Texas Court of Appeals

=== PAGE 9 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
The order does not state in clear and unambiguous terms what John Lemons
must do to comply with the judgment and thus, is unenforceable by Sherry.
See Ex parte Brister, 801 S.W.2d 833, 834-35 (Tex. 1990).
Summary
For a court order to be enforceable, it must state in clear and unambiguous
terms what the parties must do to comply with the judgment. If an order
lacks clarity and specificity, it may be deemed unenforceable. This principle
is applicable to the question of whether temporary orders without signatures
but with language indicating agreement are enforceable.
In re Perricone
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Relator relies on Rules 680, 683, and 684 of the Texas Rules of Civil
Procedure to support his argument that the temporary orders signed by
Judge Moore are void. However, pursuant to Section 105.001 of the Family
Code, the trial court may issue temporary orders 'for the safety and welfare
of the child[ren], including an order... restraining a party from disturbing the
peace of the child[ren] or another party,' without including the specific
requirements about which Relator complains here.
Summary
Under Section 105.001 of the Texas Family Code, a trial court has the
authority to issue temporary orders for the safety and welfare of children
without adhering to certain procedural requirements that might otherwise
render an order void under the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. This suggests
that the absence of signatures from the respondent and their counsel does
not necessarily invalidate the temporary orders if they are issued under the
authority of Section 105.001 for the welfare of children.

In a suit affecting the parent-child relationship, a trial court may make a
temporary order for the child's safety and welfare, including an order (1) for
the temporary conservatorship of the child, (2) for the temporary support of
the child, (3) to restrain a party from disturbing the peace of the child or

another party, (4) to prohibit a person from removing the child beyond a
geographical area identified by the court, or (5) for payment of reasonable
attorney's fees and expenses. TEX. FAM. CODE ANN. § 105.001(a). The trial
court is further authorized to render temporary orders in a suit for
modification. Id. § 156.006(a) (West Supp. 2017). Other than an emergency
order sought by a governmental entity, an order may not be rendered under
section 105.001(a)(1), (2), or (5) except after notice and a hearing.
Summary
Temporary orders in suits affecting the parent-child relationship require
notice and a hearing before they can be rendered, except in emergency
situations. This suggests that the enforceability of such orders may depend
on whether proper procedures, including notice and hearing, were followed,
rather than solely on the presence of signatures.
Ayala v. Minniti, 714 S.W.2d 452 (Tex. App. 1986)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
We do not, however, reach the merits of appellant's contentions because the
record reflects that appellant agreed and stipulated to the temporary
injunction issued by the court. At the motion for temporary orders, the
following discourse occurred: ... This temporary injunction is effective
immediately and shall continue in full force and effect until further order of
this Court or until it expires by operation of law. This order shall be binding
on respondent, on respondent's attorneys, agents, servants and employees,
and on those persons in active concern [sic] or participation with them who
receive notice of this order by personal service or otherwise.
Summary
Temporary orders can be effective and binding if the parties have agreed
and stipulated to them, even if there are procedural issues such as the
absence of a bond. The enforceability of such orders is supported by the fact
that they are binding on the respondent and others who receive notice of the
order. This suggests that the agreement and stipulation to the order, as
evidenced by the language in the order, can make it enforceable.

Ex parte Brister, 801 S.W.2d 833 (Tex. 1990)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
To be enforceable by contempt a judgment must set out the terms for
compliance in clear and unambiguous terms. See, e.g., Ex parte Reese, 701
S.W.2d 840 (Tex.1986); Ex parte Slavin, 412 S.W.2d 43 (Tex.1967). The
judgment must also clearly order the party to perform the required acts. See
Ex parte Gorena, 595 S.W.2d 841, 845 (Tex.1979).
Summary
For a judgment or order to be enforceable by contempt, it must clearly and
unambiguously set out the terms for compliance and clearly order the party
to perform the required acts. This requirement is crucial for enforceability
by law enforcement, as it ensures that the parties involved have a clear
understanding of their obligations under the order.
Tex. Fam. Code § 105.001 Tex. Fam. Code § 105.001 Temporary Orders
Before Final Order
Extract
Temporary orders rendered under this section are not subject to
interlocutory appeal. The violation of a temporary restraining order,

=== PAGE 12 ===

temporary injunction, or other temporary order rendered under this section
is punishable by contempt and the order is subject to and enforceable under
Chapter 157.
Summary
Temporary orders under this section are enforceable and violations are
punishable by contempt. The passage does not specifically address the
requirement of signatures for enforceability, but it emphasizes that
temporary orders are enforceable under Chapter 157, which deals with
enforcement of court orders. The enforceability of the order does not seem
to be contingent on the presence of signatures, but rather on the order
being rendered by the court.

Extract
(b) An agreed protective order is enforceable civilly or criminally, regardless
of whether the court makes the findings required by Section FAMILY CODE
85.001.
Summary
An agreed protective order is enforceable both civilly and criminally, even if
the court does not make specific findings typically required. This suggests
that the enforceability of such orders does not necessarily depend on the
presence of signatures from all parties, as long as the order is agreed upon
and approved by the court.

Enforcement
Extract
(a) A motion for enforcement as provided in this chapter may be filed to
enforce any provision of a temporary or final order rendered in a suit. (b)
The court may enforce by contempt any provision of a temporary or final
order. (e) For purposes of this section, 'temporary order' includes a
temporary restraining order, standing order, injunction, and any other
temporary order rendered by a court.
Summary
The Texas Family Code allows for the enforcement of temporary orders
through a motion for enforcement. The court has the authority to enforce
these orders by contempt, regardless of whether the respondent's and their

counsel's signatures are present, as long as the order is rendered by a court.
The passage does not specifically address the issue of missing signatures but
emphasizes the enforceability of court-rendered orders.
