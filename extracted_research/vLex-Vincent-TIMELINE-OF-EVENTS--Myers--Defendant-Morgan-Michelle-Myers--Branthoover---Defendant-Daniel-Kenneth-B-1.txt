TIMELINE OF EVENTS “Myers” Defendant Morgan Michelle Myers
“Branthoover” Defendant Daniel Kenneth Branthover “Carter” Defendant
Cooper L. Carter “Baker” Defendant Lindsey K. Baker in her official capacity
as Court Coordinator “Munford” Defendant James B. Munford in his official
capacity as District Judge “Kaitcer” Defendant Jeffrey N. Kaitcer in his
individual capacity as Associate Judge A. The Myers-Branthoover Enterprise
1. On December 14, 2023, Defendants Morgan Michelle Myers and Daniel
Kenneth Branthoover began communicating by text message, exceeding 90
messages on December 14, 2023. The following day, they reached a meeting
of the minds in Yukon, Oklahoma, during the weekend of December 15,
2023. REC. 274-278. Defendant Branthoover’s deceptive message, in which
he falsely represented that he wished to assist Plaintiff, was sent
immediately after Myers sought, unsuccessfully, to obtain an ex parte order
of protection from the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County on December
14, 2023. REC. 78 B. Predicate Acts: Wire Fraud and Travel Act Violation 2.
Both defendants planned and agreed to meet for the purpose of drafting an
original petition for divorce and affidavit of indigency to be later submitted
to the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County with the common purpose of
having Plaintiff removed from his matrimonial residence located at 6641
Anne Court, Watauga, Texas 76148, which also serves as his place of
business, serving clients across the United States, Canada, and the United
Kingdom. 3. During defendant Myers’ interstate travel, she emptied the
marital bank account into defendant Branthoover’s PayPal account,
amounting to $1,576. REC. 723. These proceeds were used to purchase a
second phone, registered under 817-940-0852. This phone number was used
on the fraudulent pleadings prepared during defendant Myers’ stay in
Oklahoma, which she transported from Yukon, Oklahoma back to Texas on
December 17, 2023. C. Admissions 4. On December 16, 2023, Plaintiff
reached out to defendant Branthoover and requested that the $1,576 be
returned as they were needed for Christmas gifts for the children, and for
business advertising expenses for his business. REC. 728-729. In response,
defendant Branthoover admitted that the purpose of defendant Myers’ visit
was to help her prepare paperwork for divorce litigation and confirmed that
the transfer of $1,576 did in fact occur. REC. 730. D. Post-submission
Collaboration 5. On December 18, 2023, defendant Myers submitted the
fraudulently prepared original petition for divorce, and an affidavit of
indigency to the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County. After these
documents were submitted, defendant Branthoover sent a text message to
Plaintiff on December 19, 2023, holding himself out to be defendant Myers’
attorney, showing his involvement extends past the initial help in preparing
the documents. REC. 1712-1713 6. Four days later, on December 22, 2023,
defendant Myers submitted another knowingly fraudulent application for
protective to the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County. E. Significant and
Intentional Misrepresentations 7. On December 27 and December 28, 2023,
respectively, these documents were served on Plaintiff via the U.S.
Constable, and contained the following misrepresentations: i. That
defendant Myers could not afford court costs; REC. 72, REC. 85-96 ii. That
defendant Myers had an active order of protection against the Plaintiff with

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
a finding of family violence that had occurred during the marriage; REC. 78
at 10 iii. That defendant Myers was financially responsible for the family
vehicles, rent payments, utilities, and other household expenses, making
herself appear as the primary breadwinner; REC. 92 iv. That defendant
Myers would be harassed or abused if Plaintiff were given her newly
acquired phone number that was obtained while in Oklahoma; REC. 81 at
15. v. That defendant Myers and Plaintiff ceased living together on
December 1, 2023; REC. 74 at 4 vi. That family violence occurred on
December 18, 2023, in the presence of the two Children. REC. 108-109 vii.
That both family vehicles were defendant Myers’ separate property acquired
before marriage. REC. 79 at 11B F. Evidence to the Contrary 8. On the same
day Defendant Myers claimed to be in an emergency requiring the Plaintiff’s
prompt removal from the home, she can be seen at the home with Plaintiff
and the children in no state of emergency and also still cohabitating in the
marital home. REC 1715. 9. Again, on December 29, 2023, Defendant Myers
can be seen with Plaintiff at the family home, smiling and laughing with the
children in no state of emergency and still collaborating with Plaintiff in the
marital home. REC. 1735. 10. The citation for the application for protective
order ordered Respondent to show cause as to why it should not issue with a
hearing scheduled for January 16, 2024. REC. 118. 11. In response to
extensive misrepresentation above, Plaintiff prepared an original answer,
filed a motion to consolidate, and provided background information which
alleged that defendant Myers was intentionally abusing the legal process.
REC. 130-132. G. Inclement Weather and First Appearance 12. On January
15, 2024, the Tarrant County District Courts Facebook page sent out a
notice informing the members of the public that the court would be closed
on January 16, 2024, due to inclement weather. REC. 1202. 13. Unaware of
the closure at the time, the parties appeared at the 322nd District Court of
Tarrant County on January 16, 2024, and were met with a dark courtroom,
with only one judge in the building at the time of their arrival – defendant
James Munford. 14. Defendant Munford summarily ordered the Plaintiff out
of his home, inadvertently assisting the Myers-Branthoover associate-in-fact
enterprise of achieving their primary goal in having the Plaintiff removed
from his residence, despite the broader goal being to obtain a decree of
divorce to permanently divest Plaintiff of his interests. REC. 183. 15.
Defendant Munford’s initial order was baseless, made in the absence of any
emergency, without a hearing, and disregarded the Plaintiff’s pleadings,
telling the mother “you’re going to have to find evidence of family violence!”
clearly aware that this order was made without any regard to the Plaintiff’s
constitutional rights. 16. Defendant Kaitcer walked into the courtroom late
due to the inclement weather, and turned the courtroom into a laughing
matter as he began to joke with Defendant Munford, and instructed the
parties to download the AppClose app, and the matter was reset for January
22, 2024. H. Reset #1 – January 22, 2024 Setting 17. At the January 22 reset
hearing, the parties appeared only to have the case reset once more because
defendant Myers allegedly retained the services of Defendant Cooper Carter
in the lobby of the courthouse just moments before the hearing was
scheduled to begin. No appearance can be traced to this setting by either
party on the docket (REC. 1551), and once again, no hearing was held, and
the case reset for a second time to February 1, 2024. REC. 186. 18.
Defendant Kaitcer permitted attorney Dan Bacalis, Plaintiff’s prior attorney,
to fill out the Associate Judge’s Report, and the parties never went before

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
him as indicated by the case docket’s lack of appearance on this date by
either party. I. Reset #2 – February 1, 2024 Setting 19. One day prior to the
February 1 setting, both attorneys, Defendant Carter and Dan Bacalis, both
amended the petition for divorce and counterpetition for divorce without the
parties’ knowledge. (REC. 189, REC. 209) These amended documents were
similar, submitted on the same day, and raised concerns for Plaintiff
regarding his representation. 20. At the February 1 setting, both parties
were in the conference rooms outside of Defendant Kaitcer’s courtroom,
when attorney Bacalis walks in holding a settlement agreement. When
Plaintiff refused this option, and requested that they go have a hearing
before the judge. 21. This is when Bacalis stated, as witness affidavits
corroborate, that he “knows this Judge and this is the best we can get.” and
further stated “[w]e’ll be here all day. We can come back and change it
later.” 22. Outraged by this response, Plaintiff paid very close attention to
the settlement offer Bacalis was pressuring him to sign, and noticed the
following provisions: A typed written Order conforming to this Report will
follow within 20 days from the date this Report is signed. The Temporary
Order shall be prepared by DAN BACALIS. Each attorney should approve
the Order. The parties do not need to approve the Order. The attorney
reviewing the proposed Order shall have five (5) days to do so. There arc no
ten (JO) day letters. If an agreement is not reached, a Motion to Sign shall
be filed and set within thirty (30) days from the signing of this Report. IT IS
SO ORDERED (REC. 233) J. Termination of Counsel and the Emergency
Motion 23. With these provisions in mind, Plaintiff signed the document, and
immediately fired his attorney and provided notice to the court. By doing so,
he gained access back to the residency, invalidate the agreement, and was
able to use the time back in the house to run damage control on his business
operations while preparing to expose the Myers-Branthoover enterprise to
the court via a MOTION TO RECONSIDER EVIDENCE AND VACATE
TEMPORARY ORDERS, which was filed on February 9, 2024, within three
business days of the February 1 agreed associate judge’s report being
served by the clerk. REC. 240 24. In this motion, it was specifically stated
that: i. “I am seeking immediate court intervention to correct procedural e
rrors and address the misuse of the legal system by the Petitioner.” REC.
244 ii. “Particularly, Dan Branthoover became involved. He is the boyfriend
of the Petitioner’s Mother. Shortly thereafter, I received a notice from our
joint bank account stating that $1,576 had just been withdrawn. As our bank
statement for December 2023 will demonstrate – the transaction record
shows the funds being transferred directly to Mr. Branthoover’s PayPal
account” REC. 245 iii. “The Petitioner's action of filing for divorce under an
Affidavit of Inability to pay three days after transferring $1,576 to herself
starkly contravenes the mandates set forth in Chapter 10, Section 10.001 of
the Civil Practice and Remedies Code”. REC 247 at B2 iv. “The Petitioner
violated Chapter 10, Section 10.001 a second time within the same
document when she intentionally elected to waive the 60-day waiting period
claiming to have an active protective order against me that found family
violence had occurred during our marriage.” REC 247 at B3. v. “This suit
was the second attempt by the Petitioner to have me removed from the
home, which ultimately succeeded.” REC 248 at D1 25. The motion went on
to explain the factual pattern described herein, putting the court on notice
of the key issues with provided exhibits that were served to Defendant
Carter. In response to Plaintiff’s motion, he received the first of just two

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
email communications from Carter throughout the case’s history, where she
claimed she would be filing a counter motion when disclosing her availability
for the hearing. REC. 2794 No such countermotion was filed by Carter. J.
Summary Judgment and Notice of Hearing 26. By February 22, no response
had been filed by Carter, so Plaintiff filed a Partial Motion for Summary
Judgment. REC. 758. Plaintiff also submitted a proposed parenting plan as
Exhibit D. REC. 769. No response was ever received from Carter. 27. On
February 27, 2024, Defendant Munford signed and issued a notice of
hearing to the parties with the hearing set for March 14, 2024. REC. 776. K.
Plaintiff’s Notice to the Court and Defendant Myers’ Self-Help Remedies 28.
On March 3, 2024, Plaintiff notified the Court that he would not be leaving
the home as it was not in the best interests of his children. REC. 782. 29.
The following day, on March 6, 2024, while walking his daughters to school,
Myers ran inside the family home, and locked him out of the marital
residence, leaving a sign on the door that said “[y]ou should have been out
by Saturday you are now locked out!” REC. 1748. 30. Plaintiff called local
law enforcement to help him regain entry into the home, where mother
produced the agreed associate judge’s report signed on February 1, 2024,
and used it as a means to block Plaintiff’s entrance to the home. 31. To avoid
further conflict, Plaintiff was escorted into the home where he was able to
grab only his computer and a few clothes, and went to Flower Mound to
temporarily stay with his father until the hearing on his emergency motion.
L. The Hearing On Plaintiff’s Emergency Motion 32. On March 14, 2024, the
parties arrived at the 322nd District Court, and on the way into the
courtroom, defendants Myers and Carter could be seen in the conference
room, quickly shuffling papers back and forth. 33. After checking in with the
bailiff, Plaintiff turned around to see defendant Carter extending him a
document titled “Temporary Orders” that were the reduced version of the
February 1 associate judge’s report. REC. 888. 34. These orders, which were
not prepared by Dan Bacalis, which were not agreed to by the parties, which
were reduced well outside of the 20-day requirement as ordered by the
judge, and which were never filed with the clerk, stated the following
misrepresentations: i. On February 1, 2024, the Court heard Petitioner's
motion for temporary orders. ii. The parties have agreed to the terms of this
order as evidenced by the signatures below. REC. 888. iii. The Court, after
examining the record and the agreement of the parties and hearing the
evidence and argument of counsel, finds that all necessary prerequisites of
the law have been legally satisfied and that the Court has jurisdiction of this
case and of all the parties. REC. 888. iv. The dates that the parties would
have access to the family residence was altered, changing the date Plaintiff
was supposed to leave from March 1, 2024, to March 20, 2024, and
changing Myers’ date of re-entry from March 1, 2024, to March 30, 2024. v.
This modification was made to prevent Myers from being liable for illegally
locking Plaintiff out of the home on March 6, 2024. 35. On the last page of
the orders, Plaintiff’s attorney who was terminated weeks earlier did not
sign the document. Plaintiff refused to sign the document for the
forthcoming reasons: i. It claimed a hearing occurred on a motion which was
never set for a hearing or served on the Plaintiff and doesn’t exist on the
docket. ii. It was prepared by defendant Carter, not Dan Bacalis. iii. The
associate judge was presiding over a de novo request of his own prior
report. iv. The matrimonial address was incorrect, as it stated “6641 Anns
Court”, rather than 6641 Anne Court. REC. 915, REC. 922 v. The orders

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
were not in the best interests of the children. vi. Notwithstanding the
Plaintiff’s revocation of consent by filing the emergency motion, the terms
were altered right before they were rendered into effect by defendant
Kaitcer. M. Predicate Acts: Extortion 36. Defendant Kaitcer, knowing that no
response was filed, knowing that he was presiding over a hearing to which
he had no subject matter jurisdiction, and knowing that the temporary order
produced by defendant Carter contained false misrepresentations, signed
another associate judge’s report pre-drafted by defendant Carter, which
summarily denied the Plaintiff’s emergency motion, ignored the fact that
Carter had not provided a response, and within the report itself, Plaintiff
was ordered to sign the document despite raising objections to its’ contents,
and despite his consent not being present. REC. 795. 37. Finally, defendant
Kaitcer refused to consider Plaintiff’s exhibits, including six affidavits
prepared by his business clients who have been directly affected by his
inability to provide the real-time market data services his clients relied on,
who were located throughout the United States. 38. Following the hearing,
the orders were rendered into effect without Plaintiff’s signature (REC.
925) , and Plaintiff filed a request for findings of fact and conclusions of law
(REC. 883), and filed and amended a “Preparatory Notice for Judicial
Review” which recounted the factual timeline up to that point, and included
the affidavits that Kaitcer refused to accept on March 14, 2024. REC. 798,
REC. 851, REC. 854, REC. 857, REC. 860, REC. 863, REC. 867, REC. 870.
39. The orders stated they were to remain in effect until the final decree of
divorce, and Plaintiff’s journey of one-sided appeals began. N. One Sided
Appellate Efforts, and Defective IWO 40. Following the rendition of the
temporary orders on March 26, 2024, Plaintiff spent between April 8, 2024
and September 15, 2024, appealing via mandamus to the Second Court of
Appeals and the Texas Supreme Court. REC. 1010. 41. During the appellate
efforts, Carter filed one of two motions in the case, which was a motion for
pre-trial conference filed on April 24, 2024, on her behalf by Roderick D.
Marx, a party not named in the suit. REC. 1014, REC. 1016. 42. Plaintiff
immediately objected to the pre-trial conference, and no response was ever
issued by Carter or the court. REC. 1018. 43. On April 30th, Plaintiff filed his
notice of completion regarding the parenting course as ordered, despite
actively trying to vacate them. REC. 1047. No parenting course was ever
completed by Myers. 44. On May 2, 2024, Plaintiff’s en banc reconsideration
was denied in the Second Court of Appeals, and he began preparing an
appeal to the Supreme Court of Texas. REC. 1067. 45. On May 19, 2024,
Carter sent the second and last email correspondence that would be
received in the case, which falsely claimed he agreed to the orders signed
on March 14, 2024, and requested that he fill out an IWO, which Plaintiff
found to be defective. REC. 1722, REC. 1728. No further correspondence
was received by Carter. O. Fraudulent Intervention and Branthoover’s
Continued Involvement 46. On June 23rd Plaintiff filed a motion in state
court entitled MOTION FOR JOINDER OF PERSONS NEEDED FOR JUST
ADJUDICATION at 12:14 P.M. REC. 1075. This motion received no response
from Carter. 47. On June 23rd at 1:54 P.M., directly following the submission
of the motion, Branthoover texted Plaintiff stating “Lol. And here comes
another denial. Please sue me individually. Please.”, referring to the earlier
filed motion and showing his continued oversight of the case’s progression
since his initial predicate acts. 48. Four days later, on June 28, 2024, the
Texas Office of the Attorney General allegedly filed an intervention pleading,

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
claiming that Plaintiff was past due on child support, and requested
information from Plaintiff. REC. 1099. 49. Most notably, the certificate of
service to this intervention pleading was allegedly signed by Holly Hayes,
the designated attorney for the OAG, yet the name underneath the signature
line reads CHOYA BURKLEY. REC. 1102. 50. Plaintiff promptly objected to
the intervention, and never received any response from the OAG, Carter, or
the court. REC. 1106. P. Supreme Court, Rule 12, and Emergency Temporary
Orders 51. As Plaintiff continued to appeal to the Supreme Court of Texas,
all prosecution came to an end in the trial court. It wasn’t until September
15, 2024, that Plaintiff filed a first amended rehearing motion in the Texas
Supreme Court, (REC. 1136) and after noticing Carter’s lack of
participation, he began to question her authority given several ambiguities
surrounding her representation, and filed a rule 12 motion to show
authority. REC. 1170. No response was ever received to this motion from
Carter. 52. At this point, Plaintiff had been staying in Airbnb homes while he
sought relief to ensure he could remain close to his daughters during this
time. On September 26, 2024, he filed and later amended an EMERGENCY
MOTION FOR TEMPORARY ORDERS and requested expedited relief by
October 1, 2024, as that was when Plaintiff was forced to move away from
the area due to cost of living being unsustainable. REC. 1184. No response
was ever received from Carter regarding this motion. 53. By October 1,
Plaintiff had no choice but to start pursuing administrative remedies, and
thought the court was biased against him given the case’s history up to that
point. He began to prepare a Joint Motion to Recuse defendants Munford
and Kaitcer, and filed it with the clerk of the court on October 7, 2024. Q.
Predicate Act: Wire Fraud 54. On October 8, 2024, Defendant Munford
signed and forwarded a “Joint Motion to Recuse” attached to his order of
referral to regional presiding judge David L. Evans but was notably missing
the exhibits and affidavit critical to the motion. REC. 1222 55. A copy of this
exchange was sent via defendant Baker on 4:43 P.M. on October 8. REC.
1254 56. Plaintiff immediately pointed out the discrepancies between the
motion filed and the motion forwarded to David L. Evans, where she replied
and admitted that the full document had been e-filed and remains with the
court. REC. 1255 57. Unsatisfied with this response, Plaintiff further pointed
out that the filing size of the document filed and the one referring to David
L. Evans was significantly different. No further correspondence was
received by Baker until the following day. REC. 1256 58. The following day
on October 8, 2024, defendant Munford signed and filed an “Amended Order
of Referral” which had the full motion attached this time, albeit still
modified as the hyperlinks and bookmarks had been removed. REC. 1282 59.
This amended referral was sent via email correspondence by Baker at 11:17
A.M. on October 8, 2024, who stated that due to the size of the motion, it
was split into three parts. REC. 1258. This excuse directly contradicts the
standard filing procedure in Tarrant County, which was raised and
subsequently ignored in an objection. REC. 1269. No response was filed in
regard to the motion to recuse or objection by Carter. R. Recusal Denial and
More Delays, and Federal Removal 60. Justice E. Lee Gabriel was assigned
to hear the motion, which had to be rescheduled due to technical difficulties
for November 7, 2024. REC. 1306. 61. The morning of the hearing, Plaintiff
woke up with a dental emergency, and promptly notified all parties, and
requested a reset for the hearing, which everyone agreed to. REC.
1393-1396. 62. Despite this agreement, the recusal was denied for failure to

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
appear, and made no mention of the agreement or the emergency. REC.
1398. 63. With no other remedies left, Plaintiff removed the case to Federal
Court on December 2, 2024, which was quickly remanded back on
December 4, 2024. REC. 1426. 64. On December 14, 2024, defendant
Branthoover texted Plaintiff, sending a threat which stated “[w]hen things
all over, you get to deal with me.” at 2:15 P.M. REC. 1720 65. On December
16, 2024, Plaintiff initiated suit against Daniel Kenneth Branthoover in the
Western District of Oklahoma seeking relief in the form of damages from the
ongoing deprivation from his home. REC. 1451. 66. Plaintiff notified the
Texas court of this lawsuit on December 31, 2024. REC. 1446. S. Further
Delays, Motion to Dismiss for Want of Prosecution, and the Original SAPCR
67. On January 24, 2025, Plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss for want of
prosecution due to the total lack of participation in the case by the opposing
party. REC. 1527. No response was ever received from Carter on this
motion. 68. On January 29, 2025, defendant Myers began disposing of
Plaintiff’s personal belongings that remained on the family property. REC.
1629-1631. 69. On February 12, 2025, Plaintiff learned that his youngest
daughter was suffering from dental pain due to Myers’ failure to obtain
dental insurance for the children. REC. 3281. 70. By March 14, (REC.
1833-1837) the judges had still not been reinstated from the first recusal,
which lad Plaintiff to reach out to Baker to request a hearing on his
unopposed summary judgment that had been on the docket since February
22, 2024, where he had to remind her to reinstate the judges back into the
case. REC. 1833-1837. 71. Given the delays, and since the case had been
brought in bad faith initially, the Plaintiff opened an original SAPCR suit in
the 233rd District Court of Tarrant County on March 18, 2025, where he
argued for dominant jurisdiction in a cover letter sent to the clerk. REC.
2260. T. Counsel Suddenly Becomes Active 72. The very next day, defendant
Carter filed an original answer filed on her behalf by Roderick Marx. REC.
2279. The motion was a boilerplate motion, and was followed by a motion to
consolidate, which was filed in the wrong court, and was also filed on
Carter’s behalf by RODERICK D. MARX. REC. 2284. 73. The Plaintiff
immediately responded by filing a motion to strike (REC. 1957) a Rule 12
motion to show authority challenging both Carter and RODERICK D MARX’s
authority (REC. 2288) and on March 24, 2025, an emergency ex-parte TRO
to prevent Myers from barring Plaintiff’s access to the home. (REC. 2302)
No responses were ever received from Carter on these motions. 74. On
March 26, 2025, an objection was filed to Carter’s consolidation motion in
the 233rd court. REC. 1881. 75. Plaintiff reached out to the coordinator from
the 233rd and went through the process to present the motion to the judge.
REC. 2338-2341. 76. On March 29, 2025, Plaintiff appeared before Associate
Judge Kate Stone, who refused to hear Plaintiff’s emergency motion despite
no response being filed, and told him to leave the courtroom. The hearing
date scheduled for April 10, 2025, as agreed by Carter and Plaintiff (REC.
2358), was actually un-set by Stone. REC. 2361. 77. The grounds for this
outright refusal was due to Carter calling in a favor from the judge without
even being present in the courtroom, to where Stone left the room, came
back, and told the Plaintiff to leave informing him that a motion to
consolidate would be filed by Carter the following week. U. Five Concurrent
Mandamus Petitions 78. Subsequently, after he was turned away from the
courtroom, Carter’s consolidation motion wasn’t filed until April 4, 2025
(REC. 2367), resulting in two mandamus petitions to try again to have the

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
March 14, 2024, order signed by Kaitcer vacated, and to compel Kate Stone
to hear the emergency TRO. See 25-0361, 25-0367. 79. On the same day the
mandamus was filed against Stone, District Judge Kenneth Newell sua
sponte granted Carter’s consolidation motion in both courts without a
hearing, and without addressing the emergency situation for the children or
the Plaintiff’s objections, leading to a third mandamus proceeding. REC.
2393, See also 25-0378. 80. On April 23, 2025, a notice of trial setting was
served on the parties by defendant Munford in the midst of all of these
issues. REC. 1773. 81. The same day, Plaintiff filed an objection and
requested an emergency stay. REC. 2219. No response was received to this
objection by either Munford or Carter. 82. Two days later on April 25, 2025,
Plaintiff filed his second recusal motion, and amended it on April 28, 2025,
this time only against Munford, and requested that the rules of procedure be
followed, and objected to the involvement of the court coordinator given the
prior recusal’s ambiguity and significant delays caused by her involvement.
REC. 2488 No response to this motion was ever filed from Carter. 83. Baker
continued to be involved in the recusal process, this time erroneously
forwarding an order of referral from defendant Kaitcer, who was not named
in the recusal motion. REC. 2615. 84. Plaintiff immediately objected on April
29, 2025, naming two issues: 1) the coordinator was still involved, and 2) the
order of referral sent by Kaitcer was erroneous. REC. 2620. 84. Plaintiff
objected to the order of assignment of John H. Cayce (REC. 3149) which was
issued on May 7, 2025, due to the unresolves issues. REC. 2620. 85. David L.
Evans overruled this objection on May 15, 2025, leading to mandamus
petition 25-0426, a direct appeal to the Texas Supreme Court. REC. 3507.
86. On May 20, 2025, John H. Cayce summarily denied the recusal, including
the denial of a motion to recuse Kaitcer which was never filed, leading to
mandamus petition 25-0458, a second direct appeal to the Texas Supreme
Court. 87. All five petitions were denied both initially and on rehearing, and
all emergency motions to stay proceedings were dismissed. The only insights
given from the appellate courts was: “Denied, per curiam.” No response was
filed by any implicated judge or opposing counsel. V. Federal RICO Case and
the Push Towards Final Trial 88. In June of 2025, Plaintiff amended his
complaint against Daniel Kenneth Branthoover and enjoined Myers as a
defendant, which they defended pro-se. 89. Plaintiff communicated this
action with the trial court, and no further action was taken in the case until
August of 2025, when defendant Munford sua sponte set the case for final
trial on December 10, 2025. 90. Plaintiff immediately objected to this trial
setting, and moved to recuse Munford for a third time. 91. The court
coordinator continued to be involved in the process, leading to a subsequent
motion to recuse the regional presiding judge, David L. Evans. 92. Plaintiff
now prepares this suit to hold defendants accountable for their collective
actions, and to prevent their common goal from being achieved, which is to
obtain defendant Myers a final decree of divorce. 93. For the forthcoming
reasons, the conduct outlined herein constitutes conduct of an enterprise
through a pattern of racketeering activity, as several predicate acts were
committed, the enterprise shares a common purpose, and Plaintiff has
suffered direct and ongoing injury to business and property as a direct result
of the defendant’s collective predicate acts. I. INTRODUCTION The
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), codified at 18
U.S.C. §§ 1961–1964, provides a civil cause of action for any person injured
in their business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962. Section

=== PAGE 9 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
1962 prohibits any person from conducting or participating in the conduct of
an enterprise’s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity, where the
enterprise’s activities affect interstate or foreign commerce. The statute
defines “racketeering activity” to include a broad array of criminal acts,
such as mail fraud, wire fraud, extortion, obstruction of justice, and others.
To establish a civil RICO claim, a plaintiff must show: (1) conduct, (2) of an
enterprise, (3) through a pattern, (4) of racketeering activity, and (5) injury
to business or property as a result. Under RICO it is irrelevant whether
"each defendant participated in the enterprise's affairs through different,
even unrelated crimes, so long as we may reasonably infer that each crime
was intended to further the enterprise's affairs.” United States v. Elliott,
supra, 571 F.2d at 902. (5th Cir. 1978) In RICO cases involving mail fraud,
the Pghlaintiff does not need to prove personal reliance on the fraudulent
statements to establish a claim. However, causation must still be shown,
meaning that the plaintiff must demonstrate that someone relied on the
misrepresentations, which led to the injury. Take the timeline of events and
go through each violation that carter has made to the lawyers creed and
other responsibilities.
Answer (Texas)
Short response
Based on the timeline and the provided legal authorities, attorney Cooper L.
Carter’s conduct appears to have repeatedly violated core ethical and
procedural duties under Texas law, including the requirements for candor,
evidentiary support, and proper purpose in pleadings and motions, as well
as broader professional responsibilities to the court and opposing parties.
These violations are evident in Carter’s pattern of filing or facilitating
misleading, unsupported, or procedurally improper documents, failing to
respond to motions, and engaging in conduct that undermines the integrity
of the judicial process.
Summary
Attorney Carter’s actions, as detailed in the timeline, reflect a sustained
disregard for the standards set forth in the Texas Civil Practice and
Remedies Code, the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, and the ethical rules
governing attorney conduct. These standards require that all pleadings and
motions be filed in good faith, with evidentiary support, and not for
improper purposes such as harassment, delay, or to mislead the court;
Carter’s repeated failures to meet these obligations—through the
submission of misleading orders, lack of response to critical motions, and
participation in procedural irregularities—constitute clear violations.
Moreover, Carter’s conduct also appears to breach broader ethical duties,
including the prohibition against dishonesty, misrepresentation, and conduct
prejudicial to the administration of justice. The cumulative effect of these
violations is not only to undermine the fairness of the proceedings but also
to erode public confidence in the legal system, exposing Carter to potential

sanctions and disciplinary action under both statutory and professional
conduct rules.
Background and Relevant Law
Legislative and Regulatory Framework
The Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code, specifically section 10.001,
imposes a duty on attorneys signing pleadings or motions to certify that,
after reasonable inquiry, the document is not being presented for an
improper purpose (such as harassment or unnecessary delay), is warranted
by existing law or a nonfrivolous argument for changing the law, and that all
factual contentions have or are likely to have evidentiary support. Section
10.004 authorizes courts to impose sanctions for violations of these
standards, including directives to perform or refrain from certain acts,
monetary penalties, and orders to pay reasonable expenses incurred by the
opposing party as a result of the improper filing (Tex. Civ. Prac. and Rem.
Code § 10.001; Tex. Civ. Prac. and Rem. Code § 10.004).
Rule 13 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure further requires that attorneys
ensure pleadings are not groundless, brought in bad faith, or for the purpose
of harassment. The rule provides for sanctions against attorneys who violate
these requirements (In re E. J. M., 01-23-00681-CV (Tex. App. Jul 22, 2025); 
Laub v. Pesikoff, 979 S.W.2d 686 (Tex. App. 1998)).
Ethical rules, as reflected in secondary materials, prohibit attorneys from
engaging in conduct intended to disrupt the tribunal, using frivolous or
abusive procedures, making false or misleading statements, or engaging in
conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. These rules are codified
in the Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct and are reinforced
by national standards such as the ABA Model Rules ("Civil Proceedings" And
The Call Of Law; HOW DO LAWYER DISCIPLINARY AGENCIES ENFORCE
RULES AGAINST LITIGATION MISCONDUCT? OR DO THEY?).
Case Law
Texas appellate courts have consistently held that attorneys must ensure
that pleadings and motions are not filed for improper purposes, are
supported by evidence, and are not groundless or brought in bad faith.
Violations of these duties can result in sanctions under both statutory and
procedural rules (Cherry Petersen Landry Albert LLP v. Cruz, 443 S.W.3d
441 (Tex. App. 2014); Shilling v. Gough, 393 S.W.3d 555 (Tex. App. 2013)).

Analysis
1. Filing and Facilitating Misleading or Unsupported
Pleadings and Orders
Throughout the timeline, Carter is implicated in the preparation,
submission, or facilitation of multiple documents that contain significant
misrepresentations or lack evidentiary support. For example:
The “Temporary Orders” presented on March 14, 2024, contained
statements that a hearing had occurred on a motion that was never set
or served, that the parties had agreed to the terms when Plaintiff had
expressly revoked consent, and that the court had jurisdiction and all
prerequisites were satisfied despite procedural irregularities. The
orders also altered key dates to retroactively justify Myers’ self-help
eviction of Plaintiff, and included an incorrect address for the marital
home.
Carter’s involvement in amending petitions and counterpetitions
without the parties’ knowledge, and in facilitating the submission of
orders not agreed to by all parties, further demonstrates a disregard
for the requirement that all factual contentions in pleadings and
motions have evidentiary support and are not presented for improper
purposes (Tex. Civ. Prac. and Rem. Code § 10.001; Cherry Petersen
Landry Albert LLP v. Cruz, 443 S.W.3d 441 (Tex. App. 2014)).
The failure to ensure that the orders and pleadings accurately reflected
the procedural history and the parties’ positions constitutes a violation
of the duty to avoid groundless or misleading filings (In re E. J. M.,
01-23-00681-CV (Tex. App. Jul 22, 2025)).
2. Failure to Respond to Motions and Engage in the
Process
Carter repeatedly failed to respond to critical motions, including the
Plaintiff’s emergency motions, motions to reconsider, motions for summary
judgment, and objections to interventions and procedural irregularities. This
pattern of non-responsiveness is significant for several reasons:
It undermines the adversarial process and the court’s ability to make
informed decisions based on a full presentation of the issues.
It may constitute a violation of the duty to avoid unnecessary delay or
needless increase in the cost of litigation, as required by section 10.001
(Tex. Civ. Prac. and Rem. Code § 10.001).
The lack of engagement, especially when coupled with the submission
of misleading or unsupported documents, suggests an improper
purpose or at least a reckless disregard for the truth and the integrity
of the proceedings (Shilling v. Gough, 393 S.W.3d 555 (Tex. App. 2013)).

3. Participation in Procedural Irregularities and Abusive
Litigation Tactics
The timeline details Carter’s involvement in or facilitation of several
procedural irregularities, including:
Filing or allowing the filing of motions and orders in the wrong court,
or by individuals not properly authorized to represent the parties (e.g.,
filings by Roderick D. Marx on Carter’s behalf without clear authority).
Failing to respond to Rule 12 motions to show authority, which are
designed to ensure that attorneys appearing in a case are properly
authorized to do so.
Engaging in or benefiting from ex parte communications or “calling in
favors” with judges, as alleged in the March 29, 2025, incident before
Associate Judge Kate Stone, where Plaintiff was told to leave the
courtroom without his emergency motion being heard.
Allowing or facilitating the use of defective or misleading orders to
justify self-help remedies, such as Myers’ lockout of Plaintiff from the
marital home.
These actions are inconsistent with the duty to avoid conduct intended to
disrupt the tribunal, to use procedures only for legitimate purposes, and to
avoid conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice ("Civil
Proceedings" And The Call Of Law; HOW DO LAWYER DISCIPLINARY
AGENCIES ENFORCE RULES AGAINST LITIGATION MISCONDUCT? OR
DO THEY?).
4. Misrepresentation and Dishonesty
Carter’s conduct also raises serious concerns regarding misrepresentation
and dishonesty, including:
The submission of orders and communications that falsely stated
Plaintiff’s agreement to terms he had expressly rejected.
The failure to correct the record or withdraw misleading documents,
even after being put on notice of their inaccuracies.
The use of misleading statements in correspondence, such as the May
19, 2024, email claiming Plaintiff had agreed to the March 14, 2024,
orders.
Such conduct is expressly prohibited by ethical rules that bar attorneys from
making false statements of fact or law to the court or to third parties, and
from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or
misrepresentation (HOW DO LAWYER DISCIPLINARY AGENCIES
ENFORCE RULES AGAINST LITIGATION MISCONDUCT? OR DO THEY?).

5. Conduct Prejudicial to the Administration of Justice
The cumulative effect of Carter’s actions—misleading filings, procedural
abuses, non-responsiveness, and misrepresentations—constitutes conduct
prejudicial to the administration of justice. This is a broad ethical violation
that encompasses any conduct that undermines the fairness, efficiency, or
integrity of the judicial process ("Civil Proceedings" And The Call Of Law).
6. Potential Sanctions and Disciplinary Consequences
Under section 10.004 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code, a court
may impose sanctions for violations of section 10.001, including directives to
perform or refrain from certain acts, monetary penalties, and orders to pay
reasonable expenses incurred by the opposing party. Rule 13 of the Texas
Rules of Civil Procedure also authorizes sanctions for groundless or bad
faith filings (Tex. Civ. Prac. and Rem. Code § 10.004; Laub v. Pesikoff, 979
S.W.2d 686 (Tex. App. 1998)).
Additionally, violations of the ethical rules may subject Carter to disciplinary
action by the State Bar of Texas, including suspension or disbarment in
egregious cases.
Exceptions and Caveats
It is important to note that the imposition of sanctions or disciplinary action
requires a finding by the court or disciplinary authority that the attorney’s
conduct violated the relevant standards. In some instances, an attorney may
be able to demonstrate that any misstatements or procedural errors were
inadvertent or the result of reasonable reliance on information provided by
the client or co-counsel. However, the pattern and persistence of the
conduct described in the timeline make such defenses less plausible.
Furthermore, some of the allegations regarding Carter’s conduct (such as ex
parte communications or “calling in favors”) may be difficult to prove
without direct evidence. The analysis above is based on the facts as
presented in the timeline and the legal standards provided.
Conclusion
Attorney Cooper L. Carter’s conduct, as detailed in the timeline, reflects
multiple and repeated violations of the duties imposed by Texas law and
ethical rules governing attorney conduct. These include the submission of
misleading or unsupported pleadings and orders, failure to respond to
motions, participation in procedural abuses, misrepresentation, and conduct
prejudicial to the administration of justice. Such actions expose Carter to
potential sanctions under the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code and
the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, as well as disciplinary action for
violations of professional conduct rules. The seriousness and persistence of
these violations undermine the integrity of the judicial process and warrant
close scrutiny by both the courts and disciplinary authorities.
