Question
Petitioner has repeatedly filed amended pleadings containing allegations of
abuse and neglect, despite a lack of supporting evidence and in the face of a
substantial mandamus record refuting these claims. Texas Rule of Civil
Procedure 13 prohibits the filing of pleadings that are groundless and
brought in bad faith or for the purpose of harassment. Sanctions may be
imposed for violations. Chapter 10 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies
Code authorizes sanctions against parties and attorneys who sign or file
pleadings for improper purposes, such as to harass or cause unnecessary
delay, or who make factual contentions without evidentiary support. The
repeated filing of unsubstantiated and refuted allegations, especially after
being confronted with contrary evidence, demonstrates a flagrant disregard
for the law and constitutes bad-faith litigation, warranting sanctions under
Rule 13 and Chapter 10.
Answer (Texas)
Short response
Repeatedly filing amended pleadings alleging abuse and neglect without
evidentiary support, especially when such allegations are contradicted by
the record, constitutes sanctionable conduct under both Texas Rule of Civil
Procedure 13 and Chapter 10 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies
Code. Texas courts have consistently held that such conduct demonstrates
bad faith or improper purpose and warrants the imposition of sanctions.
Summary
Texas law strictly prohibits the filing of pleadings that are groundless and
brought in bad faith or for the purpose of harassment, as set forth in Rule 13
of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure and Chapter 10 of the Texas Civil
Practice and Remedies Code. When a party repeatedly files unsubstantiated
allegations—particularly after being confronted with contrary evidence—this
conduct is viewed as a flagrant disregard for the law and is subject to
sanctions designed to deter such abuse of the judicial process.
The legislative framework and case law make clear that both attorneys and
parties are required to ensure that every factual allegation in a pleading has
evidentiary support or is likely to have such support after reasonable
investigation. Persisting in making allegations that are refuted by the
record, or failing to withdraw them after contrary evidence is presented, is
considered bad-faith litigation or an improper purpose, justifying sanctions
under both Rule 13 and Chapter 10.

Background and Relevant Law
Legislative Framework
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 13 establishes that the signature of an
attorney or party on a pleading certifies that, to the best of their knowledge
and after reasonable inquiry, the pleading is not groundless and brought in
bad faith or for the purpose of harassment. If this rule is violated, the court
must impose an appropriate sanction after notice and hearing, and the
particulars of the sanction must be stated in the order. The rule presumes
pleadings are filed in good faith, but this presumption can be overcome by
evidence to the contrary. "Groundless" is defined as having no basis in law or
fact and not being warranted by a good faith argument for the extension,
modification, or reversal of existing law (Tex. R. Civ. P. 13).
Chapter 10 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code further
reinforces these requirements. Section 10.001 provides that the signing of a
pleading or motion certifies that it is not being presented for any improper
purpose, such as harassment or causing unnecessary delay, and that each
factual contention has evidentiary support or is likely to have such support
after reasonable investigation. Section 10.004 authorizes the court to
impose sanctions for violations, which may include directives to perform or
refrain from acts, payment of penalties, or payment of the opposing party’s
reasonable expenses and attorney’s fees. The sanctions must be sufficient to
deter repetition of the conduct (Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code §§ 10.001,
10.004). Section 10.002 outlines the procedure for seeking sanctions, either
by motion or on the court’s own initiative, and allows for the recovery of
reasonable expenses and attorney’s fees by the prevailing party (Tex. Civ.
Prac. & Rem. Code § 10.002).
Section 9.011, while less frequently invoked, similarly certifies that
pleadings are not groundless, not brought in bad faith, and not for
harassment or other improper purposes (Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code §
9.011).
Case Law
Texas appellate and Supreme Court decisions have repeatedly affirmed and
clarified the standards for imposing sanctions under Rule 13 and Chapter
10. The courts have emphasized several key points:
Certification and Reasonable Inquiry: The act of signing a pleading
certifies that the attorney or party has conducted a reasonable inquiry
and that each factual contention is supported by evidence or is likely to
be after further investigation (Low v. Henry, 221 S.W.3d 609, 614–15
(Tex. 2007); Nath v. Tex. Children's Hosp., 446 S.W.3d 355, 362–63 (Tex.
2014)).
Improper Purpose and Bad Faith: Both Rule 13 and Chapter 10
prohibit filings made for improper purposes, such as harassment or
unnecessary delay. Courts have equated "improper purpose" under
Chapter 10 with "bad faith" under Rule 13 (Christopher Pace v. Aces

Autos, LLC, No. 05-22-00234-CV (Tex. App. Mar. 22, 2024); Sullivan v.
Arguello Hope & Assocs., PLLC, No. 03-18-00144-CV (Tex. App. Dec. 7,
2018)).
Evidentiary Support: Sanctions are appropriate when factual
contentions in pleadings lack evidentiary support, especially when the
party persists in making such allegations after being confronted with
contrary evidence (Low v. Henry, 221 S.W.3d at 614–15; Darnell v.
Broberg, 565 S.W.3d 450, 456–57 (Tex. App. 2018)).
Presumption of Good Faith and Burden of Proof: There is a
presumption that pleadings are filed in good faith, but the party
seeking sanctions bears the burden of overcoming this presumption by
showing groundlessness and bad faith or improper purpose (GTE
Communications Systems Corp. v. Tanner, 856 S.W.2d 725, 730 (Tex.
1993); R.M. Dudley Const. Co., Inc. v. Dawson, 258 S.W.3d 694, 709
(Tex. App. 2008)).
Evidentiary Hearing Requirement: Before imposing sanctions,
courts are required to hold an evidentiary hearing to assess the motives
and credibility of the person signing the allegedly groundless pleading,
considering all facts and circumstances at the time of filing
(Christopher Pace v. Aces Autos, LLC, No. 05-22-00234-CV (Tex. App.
Mar. 22, 2024); Accurate Valve Serv., Inc. v. Gilmore, No. 13-17-00440-
CV (Tex. App. May 9, 2019)).
Analysis
Application of Law to Repeated, Unsupported Allegations
The scenario described—where a petitioner repeatedly files amended
pleadings alleging abuse and neglect without supporting evidence, and in
the face of a substantial record refuting those claims—falls squarely within
the conduct targeted by both Rule 13 and Chapter 10.
1. Lack of Evidentiary Support and Reasonable Inquiry
Under both Rule 13 and Chapter 10, every factual allegation in a pleading
must have evidentiary support or, at minimum, be likely to have such
support after reasonable investigation. Persisting in making allegations that
are directly contradicted by the record, especially after being confronted
with contrary evidence, demonstrates a failure to conduct a reasonable
inquiry and a lack of evidentiary support (Low v. Henry, 221 S.W.3d at 614–
15; Darnell v. Broberg, 565 S.W.3d at 456–57). The Texas Supreme Court has
specifically held that continuing to assert allegations after obtaining
information that negates those claims is sanctionable under Chapter 10
(Low v. Henry, 221 S.W.3d at 614–15).
2. Improper Purpose and Bad Faith
Filing pleadings for the purpose of harassment, to cause unnecessary delay,
or to needlessly increase the cost of litigation is prohibited. When a party
continues to file unsubstantiated allegations after being presented with
evidence to the contrary, courts have found this to be indicative of bad faith
•

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
or an improper purpose (Christopher Pace v. Aces Autos, LLC, No.
05-22-00234-CV (Tex. App. Mar. 22, 2024); Nath v. Tex. Children's Hosp.,
446 S.W.3d at 362–63). The courts have equated "improper purpose" under
Chapter 10 with "bad faith" under Rule 13, and both frameworks authorize
sanctions for such conduct (Sullivan v. Arguello Hope & Assocs., PLLC, No.
03-18-00144-CV (Tex. App. Dec. 7, 2018)).
3. Repeated Filings and Escalation of Sanctionable Conduct
The repeated nature of the filings exacerbates the violation. Texas courts
have recognized that sanctions are particularly appropriate where a party
persists in making allegations that have been refuted by the record or where
the party fails to withdraw such allegations after being confronted with
contrary evidence (Low v. Henry, 221 S.W.3d at 614–15; In re A.C.B., 103
S.W.3d 570, 574–75 (Tex. App. 2003)). The legislative framework also
emphasizes deterrence of repeated or comparable conduct by others (Tex.
Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 10.004; Dike v. Peltier Chevrolet Inc., 343 S.W.3d
179, 193 (Tex. App. 2011)).
4. Sanctions Procedure and Due Process
Before imposing sanctions, the court must provide notice and an opportunity
for hearing, and must make specific findings of good cause in the sanction
order (Tex. R. Civ. P. 13; Nath v. Tex. Children's Hosp., 446 S.W.3d at 362–
63). The party seeking sanctions bears the burden of overcoming the
presumption of good faith by showing that the pleadings are groundless and
brought in bad faith or for harassment (GTE Communications Systems Corp.
v. Tanner, 856 S.W.2d at 731).
5. Scope and Nature of Sanctions
Sanctions may include non-monetary directives, penalties, or fee-shifting,
but must be limited to what is sufficient to deter repetition of the conduct
(Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 10.004). The court may not impose monetary
sanctions against a represented party under Chapter 10, and must ensure
that the sanction is not excessive and relates directly to the abuse found
(Nath v. Tex. Children's Hosp., 446 S.W.3d at 362–63).
Illustrative Case Applications
In Low v. Henry, 221 S.W.3d 609 (Tex. 2007), the Texas Supreme Court
upheld sanctions where an attorney continued to assert allegations that
were disproved by evidence, finding that this violated the certification
requirements of Chapter 10.
In In re A.C.B., 103 S.W.3d 570 (Tex. App. 2003), the court affirmed
sanctions where a party filed a pleading without verifying the facts and
persisted after being presented with evidence disproving the claim,
characterizing the conduct as groundless and in bad faith.
In Darnell v. Broberg, 565 S.W.3d 450 (Tex. App. 2018), the court held
that even a single factual contention in a pleading that lacks
evidentiary support can warrant sanctions under Chapter 10, and that
• 
• 
• 

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Rule 13 requires a finding of bad faith or improper purpose in addition
to groundlessness.
Presumption of Good Faith and Burden of Proof
While there is a presumption that pleadings are filed in good faith, this
presumption is rebuttable. The party seeking sanctions must demonstrate
both the groundlessness of the pleadings and the improper motive or bad
faith behind their filing (GTE Communications Systems Corp. v. Tanner, 856
S.W.2d at 731; R.M. Dudley Const. Co., Inc. v. Dawson, 258 S.W.3d at 709).
The repeated filing of allegations that are unsupported and refuted by the
record is strong evidence of bad faith or improper purpose.
Distinction Between Rule 13 and Chapter 10
Rule 13 requires a showing that the pleading is both groundless and brought
in bad faith or for harassment, while Chapter 10 allows for sanctions if the
pleading is filed for an improper purpose or lacks evidentiary support, even
without a specific finding of bad faith (Darnell v. Broberg, 565 S.W.3d at
456–57; Mann v. Kendall Home Builders Constr. Partners I, Ltd., 464 S.W.3d
84, 90 (Tex. App. 2015)). However, in practice, the standards are closely
aligned, and courts often analyze motions for sanctions under both
frameworks simultaneously (Christopher Pace v. Aces Autos, LLC, No.
05-22-00234-CV (Tex. App. Mar. 22, 2024)).
Negative Treatment of Authorities
It is important to note that Mattly v. Spiegel Inc., 19 S.W.3d 890 (Tex. App.
2000) has been disavowed by the Texas Supreme Court in Martin v. Tex.
Dept. of Family & Protective, 176 S.W.3d 390 (Tex. 2004). While Mattly
articulated the standard for Rule 13 sanctions and the presumption of good
faith, its authority is limited, and reliance should instead be placed on more
recent and controlling Supreme Court and appellate decisions such as Low
v. Henry and Nath v. Tex. Children's Hosp..
Exceptions and Caveats
Evidentiary Hearing Requirement: Sanctions cannot be imposed
without notice and an opportunity for hearing, and the court must make
specific findings of good cause in the sanction order (Tex. R. Civ. P. 13; 
Christopher Pace v. Aces Autos, LLC, No. 05-22-00234-CV (Tex. App.
Mar. 22, 2024)).
Scope of Sanctions: Sanctions must be proportionate and limited to
what is necessary to deter repetition of the conduct. Monetary
sanctions may not be imposed against a represented party under
Chapter 10 (Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 10.004).
Presumption of Good Faith: The presumption of good faith in filing
pleadings means that sanctions are not automatic; the moving party
must provide evidence to overcome this presumption (GTE
Communications Systems Corp. v. Tanner, 856 S.W.2d at 731).

Alternative Pleading: Texas law does not permit a party to allege
claims with no factual basis simply as an alternative to claims that do
have support (Low v. Henry, 221 S.W.3d at 614–15).
Conclusion
Texas law, through both Rule 13 and Chapter 10, strictly prohibits the filing
of pleadings that are groundless, brought in bad faith, or for improper
purposes such as harassment or delay. The repeated filing of
unsubstantiated and refuted allegations—especially after being confronted
with contrary evidence—constitutes a clear violation of these rules and is
sanctionable. Courts are empowered and, in appropriate cases, required to
impose sanctions to deter such conduct, provided that due process is
observed and the sanctions are proportionate. The authorities make clear
that both attorneys and parties have a duty to ensure that every factual
allegation in a pleading is supported by evidence or is likely to be after
reasonable investigation, and that persistence in making baseless
allegations in the face of contrary evidence is a hallmark of bad-faith
litigation warranting sanctions.

courts shall impose sanctions for violations. Rule 13 directs courts to assess
the facts known at filing. This supports sanctioning repeated,
unsubstantiated allegations made despite contrary evidence as bad-faith or
improper-purpose filings under Rule 13 and Chapter 10.

Dec 07, 2018)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Rule 13 authorizes the imposition of sanctions against an attorney who files
a pleading that is (1) both groundless and brought in bad faith; or (2)
groundless and brought for the purpose of harassment... Rule 13 does not
permit sanctions on the issue of groundlessness alone." ... "The burden is on
the movant to establish not only the frivolity of its opponent's claim but also
the improper motives underlying the decision to file the suit, motion, or

legal or factual support." ... "‘Improper purpose’ under chapter 10 is the
equivalent of ‘bad faith’ under rule 13.
Summary
The opinion confirms that Rule 13 sanctions are proper when pleadings are
both groundless and brought in bad faith or for harassment, and that
Chapter 10 authorizes sanctions for improper purpose or lack of factual
support. It equates “improper purpose” under Chapter 10 with “bad faith”
under Rule 13. These standards support sanctioning repeated filings of
unsubstantiated allegations, particularly after contrary evidence exists, as
indicative of bad faith/harassment and lack of evidentiary support.
GTE Communications Systems Corp. v. Tanner, 856 S.W.2d 725 (Tex. 1993)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
Rule 13 states in pertinent part: The signatures of attorneys or parties
constitute a certificate by them that they have read the pleading, motion, or
other paper; that to the best of their knowledge, information, and belief
formed after reasonable inquiry the instrument is not groundless and
brought in bad faith or groundless and brought for the purpose of
harassment.... If a pleading, motion or other paper is signed in violation of
this rule, the court, upon motion or upon its own initiative, after notice and
hearing, shall impose an appropriate sanction available under Rule 215-2b,
upon the person who signed it, a represented party, or both. ... To impose

sanctions under Rule 13, the district court was also required to find that
GCSC's assertions were made in bad faith or for the purpose of
harassment. ... Rule 13 prescribes that courts presume that papers are filed
in good faith. Thus, the burden is on the party moving for sanctions to
overcome this presumption.
Summary
The case confirms that Rule 13 prohibits groundless filings made in bad faith
or for harassment and authorizes sanctions upon violation, while clarifying
the evidentiary standards (presumption of good faith and need for specific
findings). This supports the proposition’s legal framework for sanctioning
repeated, unsubstantiated pleadings in bad faith, especially after contrary
evidence is presented.
Mattly v Spiegel Inc., 19 S.W.3d 890 (Tex. App. 2000)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
A party cannot obtain rule 13 sanctions unless the party proves that the
claims are groundless and that the opposing party brought the claim in bad
faith or to harass the party. See Tex. R. Civ. P.13. One purpose of rule 13 is to
check abuses in the pleading process. ... [R]ule 13 authorizes sanctions ...
against an attorney, a represented party, or both, who files a pleading that is
groundless and brought in bad faith or groundless and brought for the
purpose of harassment. The trial court must examine the circumstances
existing when the litigant filed the pleadings to determine whether rule 13
sanctions are proper." ... "Bad faith does not exist when a party exercises
bad judgment or negligence; 'it is the conscious doing of a wrong for
dishonest, discriminatory, or malicious purposes.' ... Courts must presume
that papers are filed in good faith, and the party moving for sanctions bears
the burden of overcoming this presumption." ... "A request for rule 13
sanctions under the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure is also a request for
affirmative relief." ... "However, in a patently meritless suit, some courts
have held that failing to nonsuit may constitute some evidence supporting
sanctions.
Summary
The case articulates Rule 13’s prohibition on groundless pleadings filed in
bad faith or for harassment and confirms courts’ authority to sanction
attorneys/parties. It explains the bad-faith standard, presumption of good
faith, and that sanctions are affirmative relief. It also notes that persistence
in a patently meritless suit (e.g., failing to nonsuit) can evidence
sanctionable conduct. These points support sanctioning repeated filings of
unsubstantiated allegations contrary to an established record. While the
passage does not cite Chapter 10, its Rule 13 analysis directly supports the

the trial court erred (1) in finding Perring's suit against Judge Gonzales
violated section 10.005 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code and
rule 13 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure... In its order dated June 7,
2004, the trial court awarded sanctions against appellant pursuant to rule
13 and section 10.01 and included the following findings... 7. [Appellant]
filed a pleading which was groundless in violation of Tex. R. Civ. P. 13; 8. The
allegations in the pleading filed against Judge Gonzales were not warranted
by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for the extension, modification
or reversal of existing law; 9. None of the allegations made had evidentiary
support; ... Similarly, rule 13 allows a court to impose sanctions on counsel
for pleadings, motions, or other papers signed and filed that are groundless
and brought in bad faith or groundless and brought for the purpose of
harassment... 'Groundless' for purposes of this rule means no basis in law or
fact... 'The party seeking sanctions bears the burden of overcoming the
presumption of good faith in the filing of pleadings.' ... Here, the trial court
concluded that appellant's claims against Judge Gonzales were frivolous,
groundless and brought in bad faith and for purpose of harassment.
Summary
The court affirmed sanctions under Rule 13 and Chapter 10 where pleadings
were groundless, not warranted by law, and lacked evidentiary support, and
were brought in bad faith/for harassment. This supports sanctioning
repeated unsubstantiated allegations, especially when contradicted by the
record, as bad-faith litigation under Rule 13 and Chapter 10.

claims made. We affirm the trial court's determination that chapter 10 was
violated...
Summary
The passages establish: (1) Chapter 10 requires reasonable inquiry and
evidentiary support for each factual allegation; (2) filing allegations
disproved by evidence violates Chapter 10; (3) sanctions are authorized
under Chapter 10 and Rule 13 for groundless or improper-purpose
pleadings; (4) improper purposes include harassment and unnecessary
delay; (5) alternative pleading does not excuse factually baseless allegations;
and (6) continuing to assert allegations after being confronted with contrary
evidence demonstrates sanctionable conduct. This directly supports
sanctioning repeated, unsubstantiated abuse/neglect allegations refuted by
a mandamus record.

or the allegations... did not have evidentiary support." "Moreover, even if we
were to apply the more stringent standards set forth in Rule 13... which
require a finding that the petition was filed in bad faith and/or for an
improper purpose, the record here supports such a finding." "As such, a trial
court may sanction an attorney under Chapter 10 for making a factual
contention—even an isolated one—in a pleading that has no evidentiary
support... (upholding sanctions for making factual contentions in pleadings
that had no evidentiary support)... sanctions under Chapter 10 may be based
on a finding that a pleading contained misrepresentations of the facts.
Summary
The passages confirm that (1) Chapter 10 authorizes sanctions when
pleadings are filed for improper purposes or without evidentiary support and
does not require proof of subjective bad faith; (2) Rule 13 authorizes
sanctions for groundless pleadings brought in bad faith or to harass,
defining “groundless” as lacking basis in law or fact; (3) courts may sanction
even specific factual contentions in pleadings that lack evidentiary support;
and (4) the appellate court affirmed sanctions under both frameworks where
allegations lacked evidentiary support, aligning with the proposition that
repeated, unsubstantiated allegations in the face of contrary evidence
warrant sanctions.
Nath v. Tex. Children's Hosp., 446 S.W.3d 355 (Tex. 2014)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
Both Chapter 10 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code and Texas
Rule of Civil Procedure 13 are applicable to this case… Chapter 10 allows
sanctions for pleadings filed with an improper purpose or that lack legal or
factual support. It provides that upon signing a pleading or motion, a
signatory attests that: Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.Code § 10.001. Pleadings that
violate these Chapter 10 requirements are sanctionable. Id. § 10.004(a). But
a court may not sanction a represented party under section 10.001 for
unfounded legal contentions. Id. § 10.004(d). Rule 13 provides that
pleadings that are groundless and in bad faith, intended to harass, or false
when made are also sanctionable… The amount of a sanction is limited only
by the trial court's duty to act within its sound discretion… the trial court
must ensure that the sanction: (1) relates directly to the abuse found; and
(2) is not excessive." "See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.Code § 10.001 (providing
that signing a pleading or motion certifies that 'the pleading or motion is not

being presented for any improper purpose, ... [and] each allegation or other
factual contention in the pleading or motion has evidentiary support or… is
likely to have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further
investigation or discovery').
Summary
The Court confirms that Chapter 10 and Rule 13 authorize sanctions for
pleadings filed for improper purposes (harassment, delay) and for factual
contentions lacking evidentiary support. It emphasizes that signing certifies
evidentiary support and proper purpose, and that violations are
sanctionable. This supports sanctioning repeated, unsubstantiated
allegations made despite contrary evidence as bad-faith litigation
warranting sanctions, subject to due-process and proportionality
constraints.

Similarly, to award sanctions under Chapter 10, it must be shown that: (1)
the pleading or motion was brought for an improper purpose; (2) there were
no grounds for the legal arguments advanced; or (3) the factual allegations
or denials lacked evidentiary support. See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.Code Ann. §
10.001 ... Chapter 10 specifies that one of the aims for imposition of
sanctions for the filing of frivolous or groundless pleadings is to “deter
repetition of the conduct or comparable conduct by others similarly
situated.” ... To impose sanctions under Rule 13 of the Texas Rules of Civil
Procedure, the proponent of sanctions must establish that the suit was
groundless and brought (1) in bad faith or (2) for purposes of harassment.
Tex.R. Civ. P. 13. A pleading is groundless when it has no basis in law or in
fact. Tex.R. Civ. P. 13. ... Although Rule 13 requires a party to have filed a
groundless pleading brought in bad faith or a groundless pleading for
harassment, sanctions under Chapter 10 can be awarded if the suit was filed
for an improper purpose, even if the suit was not frivolous.
Summary
The case sets out the legal thresholds for sanctions under Rule 13
(groundless + bad faith/harassment) and Chapter 10 (improper purpose or
lack of evidentiary support), and notes deterrence of repeated conduct as a
statutory aim. This supports sanctioning repeated, unsubstantiated
pleadings, especially when evidentiary support is lacking or when filings
persist for improper purposes notwithstanding contrary evidence.

Rule 13 authorizes a trial court to impose sanctions against an attorney, a
represented party, or both, who file a groundless pleading brought in bad
faith or brought for the purpose of harassment. TEX.R. CIV. P. 13. 'The
imposition of Rule 13 sanctions involves the satisfaction of a two-part test.
First, the party moving for sanctions must demonstrate that the opposing
party's filings are groundless, and second, it must be shown that the
pleadings were filed either in bad faith or for the purposes of
harassment.'" ... "Under section 10.001, signing a pleading or motion
constitutes a certificate by the signatory that to the signatory's best
knowledge, information, and belief, formed after reasonable inquiry: (1) the
pleading or motion is not being presented for any improper purpose,
including to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in
the cost of litigation; ... (3) each allegation or other factual contention in the
pleading or motion has evidentiary support or, for a specifically identified
allegation or factual contention, is likely to have evidentiary support after a
reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery." ... "Sanctions
under chapter 10 are reviewed for abuse of discretion." ... "Rule 13 directs a
trial court to presume that a pleading was filed in good faith... 'Thus, the
burden is on the party moving for sanctions to overcome this presumption.'
Summary
The passages set out controlling standards: Rule 13 permits sanctions for
pleadings that are both groundless and filed in bad faith or to harass;
Chapter 10 certifies that filings are not for improper purposes and that
factual contentions have evidentiary support, with sanctions available for
violations. These principles support sanctioning repeated unsubstantiated
allegations refuted by the record as bad-faith, harassing filings lacking
evidentiary support.

contention in the pleading or motion is warranted by existing law or by a
nonfrivolous argument..." ... "Akinwamide next argues that Transportation
presented no evidence that he brought the 2014 motion for an improper
purpose—such as for harassment or in bad faith—or that the motion lacked
an arguable basis in law or fact. Here, in its order imposing sanctions, the
trial court found that Akinwamide's 2014 motion to set aside the 2000
judgment was a frivolous pleading that “was filed for an improper purpose
to include but not limited to harass” Transportation." ... "See Nath, 446 S.W.
3d at 369 (stating that Chapter 10 “provides that a claim the lacks a legal or
factual basis—without more—is sanctionable”); Parker, 233 S.W.3d at 540
(“[H]arassment means that the pleading was intended to annoy, alarm, and
abuse another person.”). Because we hold that the trial court's decision to
sanction Akinwamide pursuant to Chapter 10 had evidentiary support, we
need not consider whether sanctions were proper pursuant to Rule 13.
Summary
The case confirms (1) Rule 13 authorizes sanctions for groundless/bad-faith
pleadings; (2) Chapter 10 authorizes sanctions when pleadings are filed for
improper purposes (e.g., to harass) or lack factual/legal support; (3) a trial
court may find filings frivolous and harassing and impose sanctions; and (4)
a claim lacking legal or factual basis alone is sanctionable under Chapter 10.
This supports sanctioning repeated, unsubstantiated allegations contrary to
the record as bad-faith, harassing litigation.

Chapter 10 provides in pertinent part: 'A court that determines that a
person has signed a pleading or motion in violation of Section 10.001 may
impose a sanction on the person, a party represented by the person, or

establishes that a pleading or motion was brought for an improper purpose.
Id. § 10.001(1). Reasonable inquiry should be made by the party and

Summary
The passages define and affirm the availability of sanctions when a party
files pleadings without evidentiary support, for improper purposes, or that
are groundless or brought in bad faith. They confirm courts may sanction
both signers and represented parties, and that attorney’s fees may be
awarded. This supports imposing sanctions for repeated, unsubstantiated
allegations contrary to an evidentiary record.

We review the imposition of sanctions under Chapter 10 of the Texas Civil
Practice and Remedies Code under the same standard we review sanctions
under Rule 13—abuse of discretion.... 'The degree of discretion afforded by
the trial court is... greater when sanctions are imposed for groundless
pleadings than when imposed for discovery abuse.' ... Under Chapter 10, a
court may impose monetary sanctions upon a showing that a party has filed
a pleading for an improper purpose or asserted a claim without evidentiary
support TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE §§ 10.001(1), (3); 10.004(a). To
comply with Chapter 10, the party and the attorney filing the pleading must
undertake a 'reasonable inquiry' to ensure the pleading does not violate the
Chapter 10 prohibitions.... In addition, the filing party and attorney must
undertake a reasonable inquiry to make certain the claims set forth in the
filing have evidentiary support. ... A party seeking sanctions under Rule 13
must show that the pleading is groundless and filed in bad faith or for
purposes of harassment. TEX. R. CIV. P. 13.... A groundless pleading has 'no
basis in law or fact and [is] not warranted by good faith argument for the
extension, modification, or reversal of existing law.' ... 'A party acts in bad
faith when discovery puts him on notice that his understanding of the facts
may be incorrect, and he does not make reasonable inquiry into the facts
before filing a pleading.' ... A court may accordingly find bad faith where a
party asserts a claim with knowledge that the evidence fails to support the
claim. ... The Court concludes that, as set forth above, Nath brought this
groundless case in bad faith, without evidentiary support and for an
improper purpose... Nath's improper purposes provide an independent
ground for sanctions under Chapter 10. ... Furthermore, the Court concludes
that his bad faith satisfies the second prong of the test for levying sanctions
under Rule 13.

Summary
The passages set out the legal standards: Rule 13 requires pleadings not be
groundless and not filed in bad faith or to harass; Chapter 10 requires
reasonable inquiry and evidentiary support and prohibits filings for
improper purposes. They also explain bad faith when a party persists after
being put on notice by discovery that facts are unsupported. The court’s
findings that Nath filed groundless claims without evidentiary support and
for improper purposes, warranting sanctions, directly support sanctioning
repeated unsubstantiated allegations, especially after contrary evidence is
shown.

We presume that the pleadings and other papers are filed in good faith...
The signatures of attorneys or parties constitute a certificate by them that

that the claim has 'no basis in law or fact and not warranted by good faith

faith is the conscious doing of a wrong for dishonest, discriminatory, or
malicious purposes; bad faith does not exist when a party merely exercises
bad judgment or is negligent.' ... 'The plaintiff's petition alone cannot

Rule 13 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure requires that the trial court

motion for sanctions filed after a party is non-suited as long as the trial court
does so within its plenary powers...)
Summary
The case articulates Rule 13’s certification, defines “groundless” and “bad
faith,” and confirms sanctions are available when filings are groundless and
in bad faith or for harassment. It also underscores the need for an
evidentiary hearing to assess motives and clarifies the court’s authority to
impose sanctions even after nonsuit. These principles support sanctions for
repeated, unsubstantiated allegations contrary to evidence, aligning with
the proposition’s Rule 13/Chapter 10 framework (while the passage focuses
on Rule 13, the standards dovetail with Chapter 10).

We presume that the pleadings and other papers are filed in good faith... To

not affect the trial court's authority to act on a pending sanctions motion; it

Summary
The case explains Rule 13’s certification, defines “groundless” and “bad
faith,” and confirms that sanctions may be imposed upon overcoming the
presumption of good faith, typically after an evidentiary hearing assessing
motives. It also confirms courts can impose sanctions post-nonsuit. This
supports sanctioning repeated, unsubstantiated allegations filed despite
contrary evidence as groundless and in bad faith/for harassment, fitting Rule
13 (and by analogy complements Chapter 10’s improper purpose/evidentiary
support requirements).

The court did not state the rule it relied upon in sanctioning the AG, but it
appears to have done so under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 13, which
authorizes a trial court to impose sanctions against an attorney, a

paper brought in bad faith or brought for the purpose of harassment. TEX.R.

seeking the AG's assistance or claiming that Binder was in arrears; and the
AG's refusal to withdraw the writ after meeting with Binder and being
presented with evidence that he was not in arrears can be described in no
other terms except groundless and in bad faith. Accordingly, we hold that
the trial court did not abuse its discretion in sanctioning the AG under these
circumstances.
Summary
The court affirms Rule 13 sanctions where a party filed a paper without
verifying facts and persisted after being confronted with evidence
disproving the claim, characterizing the conduct as “groundless and in bad
faith.” This supports sanctioning repeated, unsubstantiated allegations
refuted by the record. While the passage does not cite Chapter 10, its
reasoning aligns with Chapter 10’s standards (improper purpose; lack of
evidentiary support).
Shilling v. Gough, 393 S.W.3d 555 (Tex. App. 2013)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Chapter 10 of the civil practice and remedies code can provide statutory
authority for a sanction based upon a party's filing suit for improper
purposes. The chapter begins with a statement of the standard for properly
bringing a pleading or motion: The signing of a pleading or motion as
required by the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure constitutes a certificate by
the signatory that to the signatory's best knowledge, information, and belief,
formed after reasonable inquiry: (1) the pleading or motion is not being
presented for any improper purpose, including to harass or to cause
unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation. (2) each
claim, defense, or other legal contention in the pleading or motion is
warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for the extension,
modification, or reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law; ...
We conclude that if the trial court intended to award Gough attorney's fees
as a sanction under chapter 10 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies
Code, it failed to follow the mandatory procedures of that chapter. Thus, the
court abused its discretion, and the sanction cannot stand.
Summary
The case confirms that Chapter 10 authorizes sanctions for pleadings filed
for improper purposes (harassment, delay) and requires factual contentions
to have evidentiary support, aligning with the proposition that repeated
unsubstantiated allegations can warrant sanctions. It also cautions that
courts must follow Chapter 10’s mandatory procedures, relevant to ensuring
any sanction is imposed correctly.

Summary
The passages restate black-letter Texas law: Chapter 10 authorizes
sanctions when pleadings are filed for improper purposes or lack evidentiary
support, and Rule 13 authorizes sanctions for pleadings that are groundless
and filed in bad faith or to harass. This supports the proposition that
repeated, unsubstantiated allegations—especially when refuted by record
evidence—can warrant sanctions under Rule 13 and Chapter 10.

The passages restate the governing sanctions standards under Rule 13 and
Chapter 10: pleadings must not be for improper purpose and must have
evidentiary support; groundless, bad-faith, or harassing filings are
sanctionable. They also note the presumption of good faith and burden to
overcome it, which frames how to argue sanctions where a party repeatedly
files refuted, unsupported allegations.

Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 13 provides in pertinent part as follows: The
signatures of attorneys or parties constitute a certificate by them that they
have read the pleading, motion, or other paper; that to the best of their
knowledge, information, and belief formed after reasonable inquiry the
instrument is not groundless and brought in bad faith or groundless and
brought for the purpose of harassment... If a pleading, motion or other
paper is signed in violation of this rule, the court, upon motion or upon its
own initiative, after notice and hearing, shall impose an appropriate
sanction available under Rule 215-2b... Because the sanctions imposed are
not available under Rule 13, the trial court abused its discretion in basing
the sanctions award under Rule 13. We accordingly reverse the portion of
the judgment awarding sanctions pursuant to Rule 13, for the sanctions can
be affirmed, if at all, only under Chapter 10. B. Chapter 10 Chapter 10 of the
Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code provides as follows: Id. § 10.001. 'A
party may make a motion for sanctions, describing the specific conduct
violating Section 10.001.' Id. § 10.002.
Summary
The passage confirms (1) Rule 13’s certification that pleadings must not be
groundless or brought in bad faith/for harassment and that violations
require sanctions; (2) Chapter 10 authorizes sanctions for conduct violating
§10.001 and provides a mechanism for moving for sanctions; and (3) courts
must impose sanctions under the correct authority (Rule 13 sanctions must
be among those listed in Rule 215.2(b); otherwise, sanctions can be affirmed
under Chapter 10). This supports the proposition that filings lacking
evidentiary support and made for improper purposes can warrant sanctions
under Rule 13 and Chapter 10.

Mann v. Kendall Home Builders Constr. Partners I, Ltd., 464 S.W.3d 84 (Tex.
App. 2015)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Under Rule 13, the signatures of attorneys or parties on a pleading, motion,
or other paper “constitute a certificate by them that they have read the
[instrument, and] that to the best of their knowledge, information, and belief
formed after reasonable inquiry the instrument is not groundless and
brought in bad faith or groundless and brought for the purpose of
harassment.” Tex. R. Civ. P. 13. “If a pleading, motion or other paper is
signed in violation of this rule, the court, upon motion or upon its own
initiative, after notice and hearing, shall impose an appropriate sanction ...
upon the person who signed it, a represented party, or both.” ... “In addition
to proving groundlessness, a party seeking sanctions also must prove that
the challenged document was signed in bad faith or for the purpose of
harassment. ... To meet this burden, the party seeking sanctions must
overcome the presumption that the challenged document was filed in good
faith.” ... “A narrower scope applies under Chapter 10 of the Texas Civil
Practice and Remedies Code, which, like Rule 13, also governs sanctions.
Under Chapter 10, entitled “Sanctions for Frivolous Pleadings and Motions,”
sanctions are available if a single claim, defense, or legal contention is
unwarranted by existing law and there is no nonfrivolous argument for the
extension, modification, or reversal of existing law or the establishment of
new law.”
Summary
The case explains that Rule 13 prohibits signing and filing groundless
pleadings brought in bad faith or for harassment and requires sanctions if
violated. It also clarifies the need to prove bad faith/harassment and
overcome the good-faith presumption. The concurrence distinguishes Rule
13’s instrument-wide focus from Chapter 10’s claim-by-claim authority,
supporting sanctions when particular allegations lack evidentiary support or
are for improper purposes—fitting repeated unsubstantiated allegations
after contrary evidence.

Summary
The passages confirm that (1) Rule 13 prohibits pleadings that are
groundless and brought in bad faith or for harassment and mandates
sanctions upon violation; (2) Chapter 10 imposes similar certification
requirements and authorizes sanctions for improper purposes and lack of
evidentiary support, with “improper purpose” equated to “bad faith”; (3)
courts analyze Rule 13 and Chapter 10 sanctions similarly; and (4) an
evidentiary hearing is required to assess the filer’s motives and credibility in
light of available facts. This supports sanctioning repeated unsubstantiated
allegations, especially when contrary evidence exists.

10.004, 10.005. Appellees requested sanctions of $9,300 for attorney's fees
and $150 in court costs 'to deter this type of conduct and establish to the
Plaintiff that the filing of a frivolous complaint and/or lawsuit is a very
serious matter.' ... Appellant further contends the trial court erred in failing
to state in its order any reason for imposing sanctions. Rule 13 clearly
states, 'No sanctions under this rule may be imposed except for good cause,

The passage confirms that Texas Rule 13 and Chapter 10 authorize

the sanctionable conduct, aligning with the proposition that groundless, bad-
faith pleadings warrant sanctions. It also reflects the deterrent purpose of
sanctions for frivolous complaints.
Tex. Civ. Prac. and Rem. Code § 9.011 Tex. Civ. Prac. and Rem. Code § 9.011
Signing of Pleadings
Extract
The signing of a pleading as required by the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure
constitutes a certificate by the signatory that to the signatory's best
knowledge, information, and belief, formed after reasonable inquiry, the
pleading is not: groundless and brought in bad faith; groundless and
brought for the purpose of harassment; or groundless and interposed for any
improper purpose, such as to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase
in the cost of litigation.
Summary
Each signed pleading certifies it is not groundless, not in bad faith, and not
for harassment or other improper purposes. Repeated filings of allegations
lacking evidentiary support, especially after contrary record evidence,
violate this certification and support sanctions under Rule 13 and Chapter
10. Section 9.011 aligns with and reinforces those sanctions regimes by
defining the certification obligations and improper-purpose constraints.
Tex. Civ. Prac. and Rem. Code § 10.001 Tex. Civ. Prac. and Rem. Code §
10.001 Signing of Pleadings and Motions
Extract
The signing of a pleading or motion as required by the Texas Rules of Civil
Procedure constitutes a certificate by the signatory that to the signatory's
best knowledge, information, and belief, formed after reasonable inquiry:
the pleading or motion is not being presented for any improper purpose,
including to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in
the cost of litigation; each claim, defense, or other legal contention in the
pleading or motion is warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous
argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law or the

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
establishment of new law; each allegation or other factual contention in the
pleading or motion has evidentiary support or, for a specifically identified
allegation or factual contention, is likely to have evidentiary support after a
reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery; and each
denial in the pleading or motion of a factual contention is warranted on the
evidence or, for a specifically identified denial, is reasonably based on a lack
of information or belief.
Summary
Section 10.001 deems the signing of a pleading a certification that the filing
is not for an improper purpose (e.g., harassment, delay) and that factual
contentions have evidentiary support (or will after reasonable discovery).
Repeated filings asserting abuse/neglect without evidentiary support,
particularly after contrary record evidence, indicate violations of these
certifications—both the improper purpose prong and the evidentiary support
prong—thus fitting within Chapter 10’s sanctionable conduct and supporting
sanctions alongside Rule 13.
Tex. Civ. Prac. and Rem. Code § 10.002 Tex. Civ. Prac. and Rem. Code §
10.002 Motion For Sanctions
Extract
(a) A party may make a motion for sanctions, describing the specific conduct
violating Section CIVIL PRACTICE AND REMEDIES CODE 10.001. (b) The
court on its own initiative may enter an order describing the specific
conduct that appears to violate Section CIVIL PRACTICE AND REMEDIES
CODE 10.001 and direct the alleged violator to show cause why the conduct
has not violated that section. (c) The court may award to a party prevailing
on a motion under this section the reasonable expenses and attorney's fees
incurred in presenting or opposing the motion, and if no due diligence is
shown the court may award to the prevailing party all costs for
inconvenience, harassment, and out-of-pocket expenses incurred or caused
by the subject litigation.
Summary
Section 10.002 authorizes parties (and the court sua sponte) to seek and
impose sanctions for conduct violating Section 10.001. It expressly allows
fee shifting and additional costs where no due diligence is shown, including
for inconvenience and harassment, aligning with the proposition’s claim that
Chapter 10 permits sanctions for pleadings filed to harass or without
evidentiary support. This supports sanctioning repeated, unsubstantiated
allegations refuted by the record as bad-faith litigation.
Tex. Civ. Prac. and Rem. Code § 9.012 Tex. Civ. Prac. and Rem. Code § 9.012
Violation; Sanction

=== PAGE 26 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
the court may on its own motion, or shall on the motion of any party to the
action, determine if a pleading has been signed in violation of any one of the
standards prescribed by Section CIVIL PRACTICE AND REMEDIES CODE
9.011. ... If the court determines that a pleading has been signed in violation
of any one of the standards prescribed by Section CIVIL PRACTICE AND
REMEDIES CODE 9.011, the court shall, not earlier than 90 days after the
date of the determination, ... impose an appropriate sanction on the
signatory, a represented party, or both. ... The sanction may include ... the
striking of a pleading or the offending portion thereof; ... the dismissal of a
party; or an order to pay ... reasonable expenses ... including costs,
reasonable attorney's fees, witness fees, fees of experts, and deposition
expenses. ... This section does not apply to any proceeding to which Section
CIVIL PRACTICE AND REMEDIES CODE 10.004 or Rule 13, Texas Rules of
Civil Procedure, applies.
Summary
The passage confirms courts must determine and impose sanctions for
pleadings signed in violation of § 9.011 standards, including striking
pleadings, dismissal, and fee-shifting. It also clarifies that § 9.012 does not
apply where Chapter 10 (§ 10.004) or Rule 13 applies, underscoring that
Texas provides overlapping sanctions regimes for groundless or bad-faith
pleadings. This supports the proposition that Texas law authorizes sanctions
for repeated, unsupported allegations and that Rule 13 and Chapter 10 are
appropriate vehicles; § 9.012 corroborates the availability and nature of
sanctions and the procedural mechanism for determining violations.
Tex. Civ. Prac. and Rem. Code § 10.004 Tex. Civ. Prac. and Rem. Code §
10.004 Violation; Sanction
Extract
A court that determines that a person has signed a pleading or motion in
violation of Section CIVIL PRACTICE AND REMEDIES CODE 10.001 may
impose a sanction on the person, a party represented by the person, or both.
The sanction must be limited to what is sufficient to deter repetition of the
conduct or comparable conduct by others similarly situated. A sanction may
include any of the following: a directive to the violator to perform, or refrain
from performing, an act; an order to pay a penalty into court; and an order
to pay to the other party the amount of the reasonable expenses incurred by
the other party because of the filing of the pleading or motion, including
reasonable attorney's fees. The court may not award monetary sanctions
against a represented party for a violation of Section CIVIL PRACTICE AND
REMEDIES CODE 10.001. The court may not award monetary sanctions on
its own initiative unless the court issues its order to show cause before a
voluntary dismissal or settlement of the claims made by or against the party
or the party's attorney who is to be sanctioned. The filing of a general denial

=== PAGE 27 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
under Rule 92, Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, shall not be deemed a
violation of this chapter.
Summary
Section 10.004 authorizes courts to impose sanctions when a pleading or
motion violates § 10.001, which includes filings for improper purposes (e.g.,
harassment or unnecessary delay) or factual contentions without evidentiary
support. The statute specifies available sanctions (directives, penalties, and
fee-shifting) aimed at deterring repetition—aligning with the proposition
that repeated, unsubstantiated allegations warrant sanctions. It also clarifies
limits (no monetary sanctions against represented parties; show-cause
requirement for court-initiated sanctions; general denial safe harbor), which
frames how sanctions may be imposed for repetitive, unsupported
allegations.
Sanctions for nonfrivolous complaints? Implications for the improper
purpose prong of Rule 11.
Albany Law Review - Albany Law School - Kruzansky, Barbara
Comninos - 1998-06-22
Extract
Rule 11 prohibits the filing of pleadings that are not reasonably based in the
law or in fact and forbids the filing of pleadings that are interposed for any
improper purpose, such as to harass or cause unnecessary delay or needless
increased cost of litigation. The language of Rule 11 is mandatory; if a
district court concludes that a party or attorney filed a pleading or other
document for an improper purpose, then the court must impose a sanction....
Thus, the Seventh Circuit concluded, a district court need not find a claim to
be frivolous in order for the filer's conduct..." ... "Even if there is an arguable
legal and factual basis for a motion, an attorney or party violates Rule 11 by
presenting that motion to the court for an improper purpose.
Summary
The quoted passages establish that pleadings lacking factual basis or filed
for improper purposes (harassment, delay) are sanctionable, and sanctions
can be imposed even if the claims are not frivolous if the purpose is
improper. This mirrors Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 13 and Texas Civil
Practice & Remedies Code Chapter 10, both of which prohibit groundless
filings, improper purposes, and unsupported factual contentions, and
authorize sanctions. The article’s discussion of Rule 11’s improper purpose
prong supports the argument that repeated, unsubstantiated allegations—
especially in the face of contrary evidence—reflect bad faith and warrant
sanctions.

The Dick Law Firm and its Client Sanctioned
Extract
Standard moved to recover attorney’s fees under the Texas Rules of Civil
Procedure, the Texas Insurance Code, the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies
Code, and the DTPA, asserting that Aleman had filed a frivolous lawsuit,
which was sanctionable conduct... Due to Aleman and her counsel’s failure
to support by any claim pled in this lawsuit and the failure to identify any
effort to investigate a basis in law or fact to support the pleadings, the court
found that there was no evidentiary support for any claim pled by Aleman in
this lawsuit and that the lawsuit was brought for an improper purpose,
including to cause unnecessary delay and the needless increase of the cost
of litigation. In addition the court found that the Expert Designations filed by
Aleman and her attorneys, Dick and the Dick Law Firm, were misleading
and contained false information about designated witnesses.
Summary
The passage shows a Texas court imposing sanctions where claims lacked
evidentiary support and were pursued for improper purposes (e.g., delay
and increasing costs), aligning with Rule 13’s prohibition on groundless,
bad-faith pleadings and Chapter 10’s ban on filings for improper purposes or
without factual support. It supports the argument that repeatedly filing
unsubstantiated allegations, especially when refuted and unsupported,
warrants sanctions.
The Rare Abuse of the Appraisal Process
Extract
In addition, counsel for Plaintiff violated Tex.R.Civ.P. 13 by signing and filing
pleadings that were groundless, brought in bad faith, or brought for the
purpose of harassment. ... Under these circumstances, the Court has
discretion to strike the Plaintiffs pleadings and dismiss the case under
Tex.R.Civ.P. 215.2(b). The Court determined that based on multiple violations
of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure and violations of the Court’s orders,
there are no lesser sanctions that would fully promote compliance. ... The
court then struck Mitchell’s pleadings and dismissed his case with prejudice.
Summary
The passage explicitly states a Texas court found a violation of Rule 13 for
groundless and bad-faith pleadings and imposed severe sanctions (striking
pleadings and dismissal with prejudice) after repeated violations and
ineffectiveness of lesser sanctions. This supports the proposition that Texas
courts may sanction repetitive, unsubstantiated, harassing pleadings under
Rule 13, and that courts may escalate to striking pleadings/dismissal when
lesser sanctions are inadequate. While the passage does not cite Chapter 10

expressly, it corroborates the Rule 13 arm of the proposition and the
availability of sanctions for improper pleadings.
Rule 13. Effect of Signing Pleadings, Motions and Other Papers; Sanctions
Extract
The signatures of attorneys or parties constitute a certificate by them that
they have read the pleading, motion, or other paper; that to the best of their
knowledge, information, and belief formed after reasonable inquiry the
instrument is not groundless and brought in bad faith or groundless and
brought for the purpose of harassment. ... If a pleading, motion or other
paper is signed in violation of this rule, the court, upon motion or upon its
own initiative, after notice and hearing, shall impose an appropriate
sanction ... Courts shall presume that pleadings, motions, and other papers
are filed in good faith. No sanctions under this rule may be imposed except
for good cause, the particulars of which must be stated in the sanction
order. 'Groundless' for purposes of this rule means no basis in law or fact
and not warranted by good faith argument for the extension, modification,
or reversal of existing law.
Summary
The passage defines the signer’s certification duty, prohibits pleadings that
are groundless and brought in bad faith or for harassment, and mandates
sanctions for violations after notice and hearing. It also defines “groundless”
as having no basis in law or fact. Repeated filings of allegations lacking
evidentiary support—especially when refuted by a mandamus record—fit
within “groundless” and bad-faith/harassment purposes, supporting
sanctions under Rule 13. While Chapter 10 is not quoted here, Rule 13
independently supports sanctions for the described conduct.
