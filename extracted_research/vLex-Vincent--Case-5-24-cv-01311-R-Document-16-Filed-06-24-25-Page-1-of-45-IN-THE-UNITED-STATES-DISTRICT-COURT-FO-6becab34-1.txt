matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331, as
Plaintiff's claims arise under the laws of the United States, specifically the
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C. §
1964(c) and§ 1964(d), which explicitly grants federal courts jurisdiction over
civil RICO actions. Further, jurisdiction is established under 18 U.S.C. §
1965, which provides for nationwide service of process and jurisdiction in
RICO actions, thereby ensuring that all Defendants, regardless of their
physical location within the United States, are subject to the jurisdiction of
this Court. 2. Venue is proper in the United States District Court for the
Western District of Oklahoma pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 1965(a) and 28 U.S.C.

this litigation lies a deliberate and orchestrated scheme by Defendants

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Morgan Michelle Myers and Daniel Kenneth Branthoover, who strategically
chose to displace Plaintiff from his home and destabilize his financial and
familial security. Branthoover administered and Myers meticulously
executed a calculated plan involving interstate travel, fraudulent affidavits,
deliberate petjury, asset diversion, and systematic manipulation of multiple
Texas state courts to escape accountability for her actions. 12. To carry out
this scheme, Myers enlisted the assistance of Daniel Kenneth Branthoover, a
resident of Yukon Oklahoma, who has a prior history regarding violations of
protective orders and tampering with government documents. For no other
reason than to escape accountability for her affair, Myers spun an elaborate
web of lies and weaponized her family and court procedures designed to
help victims of abuse. 13. What emerges from the evidence is not a domestic
dispute gone awry, but a textbook criminal enterprise created within this
Court's Jurisdiction. This is the story of how a person corruptly influenced
the very courts designed to protect familiestransforming them into
instruments of fraud, extortion, and systematic theft. It is a tale of how two
individuals, connected by a common goal, orchestrated a seventeen-month
reign of terror that began in Oklahoma and was carried out in the Texas
courts. 14. The Defendants did not merely lie to courts-they constructed an
elaborate criminal enterprise with defined roles, coordinated operations,
and a singular mission: to strip Plaintiff of eve1ything he held dear through
the systematic corruption of judicial 4 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R Document 16
Filed 06/24/25 Page 5 of 45 proceedings. They engaged in laundering funds
across state lines while concurrently submitting fraudulent indigency claims.
They did not just fabricate allegations-they manufactured an entire false
narrative of domestic violence, complete with non-existent protective orders
and imaginary threats, all while the supposed "victim" continued to share a
bed with her alleged "abuser." 15. This case shows how the family court
system can be perverted by those willing to commit federal crimes to
achieve their goals. It reveals how easily the sacred trust placed in sworn
affidavits can be shattered by defendants who view perjury not as a crime,
but as a tool. Most importantly, it demonstrates that when domestic
relations become the vehicle for interstate racketeering, federal intervention
is not just appropriate-it is essential. 16. This is not a story about a marriage
that failed. This is simply the product of a litigant who values her
extramarital relationships over morality, and who chose to weaponize her
family against Plaintiff for the sole purpose of escaping accountability. 17.
After extensive research and vigorous advocacy, Plaintiff asserts that
Defendants engaged in racketeering activity through an organized
enterprise, seeking relief to prevent its finalization. Against all odds, and in
support of this preliminruy statement, Plaintiff alleges the following: 5 Case
5:24-cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 6 of 45 IV.
FACTUALALLEGATIONS A. Enterprise Formation and Initial Criminal
Coordination (December 14-15, 2023) 18. Defendant Branthoover possesses
extensive knowledge of protective order procedmes and requirements due to
his prior criminal convictions involving violations of such orders. This
knowledge would prove instrumental in the enterprise's systematic
manipulation of protective order proceedings. 19. On December 14, 2023,
immediately following Plaintiffs discovery of Defendant Myers' extramarital
affair, she initiated the criminal enterprise by taking two coordinated
actions: first, she opened a private bank account in her sole name to
facilitate asset concealment; and second, she commenced intensive

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
interstate communications with Defendant Branthoover via text messaging.
The scope and intensity of these communications-totaling 92 text messages
exchanged between Branthoover's registered number 940-312-3434 and
Myers' registered number 817-235-5189 on this single daydemonstrates the
deliberate and coordinated nature of their criminal planning. 20. While
coordinating with Branthoover, Defendant Myers tried to secure an exparte
protective order against Plaintiff, without legitimate cause. This action
marks the enterprise's first attempt to manipulate judicial proceedings
through false allegations. 21. Despite having just sought emergency
protection from Plaintiff hours earlier, Myers casually reminded him of their
child's school field trip scheduled for the following day, thereby creating a
facade of normalcy designed to conceal her fraudulent intentions and
prevent suspicion of the enterprise's activities. 6 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R
Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 7 of 45 B. Interstate Criminal
Coordination and Financial Crimes (December 15-16, 2023) 22. On
December 15, 2023, at precisely 9:51 A.M. CST, Defendant Branthoover
contacted Plaintiff directly, employing calculated deception by stating, "I've
been where you are before. I want to help both of you." This communication,
referencing Myers' December 1, 2023 divorce announcement, was designed
to establish false pretenses for Myers' planned interstate travel to Oklahoma
for criminal coordination purposes. 23. During this deceptive phone
conversation, Branthoover established the operational framework for the
next phase of the criminal scheme by atl'anging for Myers to visit his
Oklahoma residence over the weekend of December 15, 2023. The stated
purpose-"providing space" to Myers-was a deliberate misrepresentation
designed to conceal the true criminal purpose of coordinating fraudulent
document preparation and enterprise operations. 24. Having no reason to
suspect Branthoover's dishonest intentions, Plaintiff unwittingly facilitated
the enterprise's criminal coordination by agreeing to Myers' travel to
Oklahoma. 25. Immediately following Branthoover's deceptive phone call,
the enterprise executed its first major financial crime. Plaintiff received
notification that Myers had transfetl'ed $1,576 from the parties' joint marital
PNC account to Branthoover's Pay Pal account (usemame "dmb575"),
completely depleting the account balance. This interstate wire transfer
represents a critical predicate act, utilizing interstate commerce to further
the criminal scheme while simultaneously depriving Plaintiff of operating
funds necessary for his legitimate business operations, household bills, and
Christmas gifts. 7 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 8
of 45 26. The immediate and devastating impact of this financial crime
became apparent on December 16, 2023, when Plaintiff received notification
that the joint marital PNC account was overdrawn by $800.00. Concurrently,
Plaintiff discovered that advertisements for his legitimate home-based
business had ceased running due to payment failure directly caused by the
enterprise's theft of operating funds. This demonstrates the enterprise's
deliberate intent to cause maximum financial harm to Plaintiff. 27. The
criminal nature of this financial transaction is conclusively established by
documentary evidence. The PNC bank statement for December 2023
provides irrefutable proof of the unauthorized withdrawal, documenting the
precise date, amount, and destination of the :fraudulent transfer. 28. The
direct connection between Defendant Branthoover and this financial crime is
established through multiple forms of evidence. The PayPal identifier
"dmb575" appearing on Plaintiffs bank statement directly corresponds to

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Branthoover's Pay Pal account, creating an unbreakable evidentiary chain
linking him to the illicit financial transaction, c01Toborated by his own
admissions in subsequent text communications. 29. On December 16, 2023,
at precisely 3:54 P.M. CST, Plaintiff made a goodfaith attempt to resolve the
situation amicably by sending a detailed text message to Defendant
Branthoover. This communication explicitly requested the return of the
fraudulently transferred $1,576, detailed the intended legitimate use of
these funds, described the financial hardship caused by the theft (including
late bills and business disruption), explained Plaintiff's inability to work due
to the severe emotional distress 8 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed
06/24/25 Page 9 of 45 caused by Defendants' criminal actions, and
expressed his sincere desire for an amicable resolution during the holiday
season. 30. Defendant Branthoover's response to this reasonable request
revealed the true criminal nature of the enterprise. In a callous and
dismissive reply, Branthoover stated, "You Are Getting Divorced ... " followed
by, "I hope I can help with the paperwork and make things go as smoothly as
possible." Far from the helpful assistance initially promised, this
communication constituted a direct threat and overt act in furtherance of
the criminal conspiracy, demonstrating Branthoover's intent to exploit
Plaintiffs financial distress for the enterprise's benefit while utilizing
interstate communications to further the scheme. 31. This communication
also establishes Branthoover's unauthorized practice of law across state
lines. At no time relevant to this litigation has Defendant Branthoover
possessed a license to practice law in any jurisdiction within the United
States. His statements regarding "paperwork" and making legal proceedings
"go as smoothly as possible" constitute clear evidence of unauthorized legal
practice and demonstrate his administrative role in directing the
enterprise's criminal activities. C. Coordinated Eviction Attempt Fraud and
Interstate Document Transportation (December 17, 2023) 32. On December
17, 2023, at approximately 11 :00 A.M., Plaintiff was served with an eviction
notice by the grandmother of Myers, who is also the landlord of the
matrimonial residence, which contained the following false information: 1. A
purported "lease violation," which was entirely fabricated as no 9 Case 5:24-
cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 10 of 45 valid lease
agreement existed between Plaintiff and Wilson; 11. The assertion that
"Granddaughter getting divorced," referring to Defendant Myers, as a basis
for eviction; iii. The false claim that a "Protective order has been filed." 1v.
The directive that "He must leave. She and the girls may stay,"
demonstrating the clear intent to dispossess Plaintiff for the benefit ofMyers.
33. The coordinated and premeditated nature of this eviction fraud is
established by the timing of its execution. At the precise moment this
fraudulent notice was being served in Texas, Defendant Myers was
physically present in Oklahoma with Defendant Branthoover, actively
collaborating in the preparation of the very fraudulent court documents
referenced in the eviction notice. 34. Myers' knowledge of the fraudulent
nature of the eviction attempt is conclusively established. She possessed
actual knowledge that no valid lease agreement existed, and she had actual
knowledge that neither divorce proceedings nor protective orders had been
filed at the time of service, making her participation in the eviction fraud a
knowing and willful criminal act. 35. On December 17, 2023, Defendant
Myers completed the interstate transportation phase of the criminal scheme
by transporting the fraudulent court documents prepared in Oklahoma back

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
across state lines to Texas. These documents, including the Original Petition
for Divorce and Affidavit oflndigency, were specifically 10 Case 5:24-
cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 11 of 45 prepared with the
intent of submitting them to Texas state courts to further the enterprise's
fraudulent manipulation of judicial proceedings. 36. Upon her return to
Texas, Myers demonstrated her control over the eviction fraud by personally
destroying the fraudulent eviction notice. She physically tore the notice in
half and wrote "VOID" on it in black marker, providing clear evidence of her
influence over and coordination of the fraudulent eviction attempt
orchestrated during her absence in Oklahoma. D. Operational Security and
Document Preparation (December 17-18, 2023) 37. As part of the
enterprise's operational security measures, Defendant Myers returned from
Oklahoma equipped with a canister of pepper spray, designed to support the
false narrative of domestic violence that would be central to the fraudulent
comt documents prepared during her Oklahoma visit. 38. During her
Oklahoma visit, Defendant Myers acquired a secondary phone number
(817-940-0852) as a deliberate operational security measure. This
acquisition, which she explicitly disclosed to Plaintiff, constituted an overt
act in furtherance of the criminal enterprise, designed to facilitate
clandestine communications related to the fraudulent scheme while
concealing the enterprise's ongoing criminal coordination from detection.
39. This newly acquired secondary phone number became an integral
component of the fraudulent court documents prepared under Defendant
Branthoover's direct administrative oversight. The systematic use of this
number across multiple fraudulent legal documents demonstrates the
coordinated nature of the enterprise's document 11 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R
Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 12 of 45 preparation activities. These
documents, prepared in Oklahoma with the specific intent of unlawfully
influencing Texas legal proceedings, included: 1. An "Original Petition for
Divorce" dated December 18, 2023, containing numerous material false
statements designed to deceive the Texas courts; 11. An "Affidavit
oflndigency" dated December 18, 2023, containing deliberate
misrepresentations regarding Myers' financial status to defraud the court of
legitimate filing fees; iii. A "Request for Uncontested Cases" dated
December 18, 2023, fraudulently filed despite the complete absence of any
communication between the parties regarding divorce proceedings; 1v. An
"Application for Protective Order" dated December 22, 2023, containing
entirely fabricated allegations of family violence. E. Unauthorized Practice
of Law and Intimidation (December 18, 2023) 42. 40. Following the filing of
the initial fraudulent divorce documents on December 18, 2023, Defendant
Branthoover escalated his unauthorized practice of law by sending Plaintiff a
text message asserting legal representation and attempting to control all
future communications. The message stated: "Charlie, its come to my
understanding you have retained an attorney. I'm sure he has told you that
all further communication should take place between attorneys. I must
formally ask you refrain from discussing details of this case with my client
moving forward and only communicate with me or your attorney." 12 Case
5:24-cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 13 of 45 This
communication was a deliberate attempt to isolate Plaintiff from direct
communication with Myers and to control the flow of information, thereby
hindering Plaintiff's ability to uncover the full extent of the fraudulent
scheme. This communication also evidences that Branthoover's role went

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
beyond helping Myers prepare the documents by seeing them through to
their submission and asserting an administrative role over the proceedings
to intimidate Plaintiff. F. Service Through Official Channels and Continued
Deception (December 22-28, 2023) 41. In furtherance of the criminal
scheme, and despite continuing to cohabitate with Plaintiff in the marital
residence, Defendant Myers deliberately utilized official constable service to
effectuate service of the fraudulent divorce petition and protective order
application, which occurred on December 27, 2023. This calculated use of
official legal processes to serve fraudulent documents while maintaining the
deceptive facade of normalcy at home demonstrates the sophisticated and
deliberate nature of the enterprise's operations. 42. The enterprise's
manipulation of official legal processes continued when Myers, despite
residing next door to Plaintiff, deliberately influenced and coordinated the
constable service of the fraudulent eviction documents, which occurred on
December 28, 2023. This systematic abuse of official legal processes while
maintaining physical proximity and continued cohabitation reveals the
calculated and deceptive nature of the enterprise's operations. 13 Case 5:24-
cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 14 of 45 G. Systematic False
Statements in Sworn Court Documents (December 18, 2023) 43. When
reviewing the documents prepared in part by Branthoover and filed with the
court by Myers, there existed several false statements and were intended to
deceive the court and prejudice Plaintiff in furtherance of the scheme to
dispose him of his property interests. Specifically, these false statements
included, but were not limited to: 1. The assertion that the spouses had
ceased living together on December 1, 2023, when in fact they were still
residing together at the marital home on that date and for several weeks
thereafter. 11. The claim that Defendant Myers owned both family vehicles
as her separate property prior to the marriage, which was demonstrably
false as these vehicles were acquired during the marriage and constituted
community property, paid for by Plaintiff. m. The representation that
Defendant Myers had an active order of protection against Plaintiff with a
judicial finding that family violence had occurred during the marriage, which
was fabricated and without any basis in fact or law. 1v. The assertion that
the children or Defendant Myers would be subjected to harassment or abuse
if Plaintiff were provided with her second phone number (817-940-0852)
acquired in Oklahoma, which was a baseless and manipulative claim
designed to conceal her communications related to the fraudulent scheme.
14 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 15 of 45 44.
Concurrently with the fraudulent divorce petition, Defendant Myers, again
with the administrative oversight and full knowledge of Defendant
Branthoover, filed a fraudulent "Affidavit of Indigency" with the court. This
affidavit contained material misrepresentations regarding Defendant Myers'
fmancial status, all of which were known to be false at the time of filing and
were intended to defraud the court and avoid legitimate court costs.
Specifically, these false statements included: 1. The claim that Defendant
Myers was financially indigent and unable to pay comi costs, despite her
access to and control over substantial marital assets. 11. The representation
that Defendant Myers was solely responsible for all family living expenses,
including rent, utilities, food, and other living expenses, when in fact,
Plaintiff was the primary breadwinner of the household at that time. 111.
The asse1tion that Defendant Myers was solely responsible for both car
payments, which she has no payment history to suppmi such a claim. H.

Escalation Through Fabricated Violence Allegations (December 22, 2023)
45. On December 22, 2023, despite having claimed in her divorce petition to
already possess an active protective order, Myers filed an "Application for
Protective Order," revealing the contradictory and fabricated nature of her
previous representations while escalating the enterprise's fraudulent
manipulation of judicial proceedings. 15 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R Document 16
Filed 06/24/25 Page 16 of 45 46. Upon review, defendant Myers made
additional false statements within the sworn document, all intended to
further deceive the court and secure an unwarranted protective order
against Plaintiff to effectuate the enterprises' goal of divesting him of his
property interests. These false statements included, but were not limited to:
i. The claim that family violence occurred on December 18, 2023, in the
presence of the children, which was entirely false and fabricated. 11. The
assertion that family violence occurred prior to December 18, 2023, which
was also false and without any factual basis. 111. The request that Plaintiff
take a battering intervention program. I. Achievement of Primary Criminal
Objective (January 16, 2024) 47. On January 16, 2024, the enterprise's
criminal scheme achieved its primary objective when Plaintiff appeared
before the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County and was ordered to vacate
the family residence. Significantly, this order was entered without any
evidentiary hearing and without judicial findings regarding the allegations
contained in the fraudulent documents, demonstrating that the court's
decision was based entirely on the false information systematically
presented by the Defendants. 48. The causal relationship between the
Defendant's fraudulent representations and this judicial outcome is
conclusively established. The misinformation presented to the court through
the coordinated fraudulent documents was the sole basis for the comt's
decision, providing Myers with the exact advantage that she and
Branthoover had anticipated and planned through significant and intentional
misrepresentations. 16 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed 06/24/25
Page 17 of 45 J. Ongoing Pattern of Racketeering Activity and Continuity
( January 2024 - Present) 49. Between January 16, 2024, and the present
day, Defendants Myers and Branthoover have continued to further their
racketeering activity through a series of ongoing illicit acts, demonstrating a
clear pattern of continuity and relatedness. These acts include, but are not
limited to: 1. Myers and Branthoover continuing to engage in interstate
communications regarding case details between one another across state
lines, specifically between Texas and Oklahoma, in direct fwtherance of
their :fraudulent scheme to see the divorce through to its finalization. 11.
Branthoover delivering ongoing threats and intimidation to Plaintiff
regarding his legitimate attempts to seek legal relief from the orders that
were a product of the Defendants' actions, which occurred in December of
2023, June of 2024, December of 2024, and May of 2025. 111. Making direct
statements such as "I've been enjoying watching every filing get denied" by
Branthoover, showing the malicious intent behind his involvement as
Plaintiff sought relief for their coordinated actions. 50. On June 23, 2024,
Defendant Branthoover continued his pattern of harassment and
intimidation by sending Plaintiff a text message stating, "Loi. And here
comes 17 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 18 of 45
another denial," in direct reference to Plaintiffs court filing seeking to enjoin
Branthoover as a party to the divorce proceedings. This communication
provides conclusive evidence of Branthoover's continued awareness of and

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
active involvement in the Texas legal proceedings, his ongoing monitoring of
court filings, and his malicious intent to mock and intimidate Plaintiff's
efforts to seek justice through legitimate legal channels. 51. On December
12, 2024, Branthoover escalated his threatening communications by sending
Plaintiff a message stating, "When things all over you get to deal with me.
Just a heads up," demonstrating the enterprise's ongoing criminal intent and
explicit threats of future retaliation against Plaintiff for his efforts to expose
and seek relief from their criminal activities. 52. Most recently, on May 24,
2025, Branthoover sent Plaintiff a message stating, "Where's my lawsuit?
Heard your vm about me. File it. Let's do this:)" This communication
demonstrates the enterprise's continued operation, Branthoover's ongoing
monitoring of Plaintiffs activities, and his explicit challenge and threat
regarding potential legal action, providing clear evidence of the enterprise's
ongoing criminal intent and the continuing threat posed to Plaintiff. 53. As a
direct result of the actions outlined above, Plaintiff has sustained substantial
injury to his business and property. 54. Plaintiff now turns to discuss the
elements of RICO and the alleged predicate acts committed by the
Defendants in this matter. 18 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed
06/24/25 Page 19 of 45 V. INTRODUCTION TO RICO 55. Plaintiff realleges
and incorporates by reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1
through 54 above, as if fully set forth herein. 56. The Racketeer Influenced
and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) requires proof of a "pattern of
racketeering activity," which the Supreme Court has consistently held
consists of two essential elements: relatedness and continuity of predicate
acts. Based on the provided facts and the applicable law, the Defendants'
series of related acts spanning from December 2023 through May 2025
(approximately 18 months) satisfies both the relatedness requirement ( as
the acts share similar purposes, participants, and methods) and the
continuity requirement (as they extend over a substantial period of time)
necessary to establish a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO as
explained in more detail below. 57. For there to be a pattern of racketeering
activity, there must be conduct committed by an enterprise that is prohibited
under 18 U.S.C. § 1961. In the instant matter, Defendants are alleged to
have committed several predicate acts, including wire fraud, violations of
the Travel Act, and perjury/subordination of perjury to support a pattern of
racketeering activity, as explained in more detail below. VI. PREDICATE ACT
- WIRE FRAUD (18 U.S.C. § 1343) 58. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by
reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 57 above, as if
fully set forth herein. 59. The relevant federal statutes in this analysis are 18
U.S.C. § 1343 (Wire Fraud) and 18 U.S.C. § 1961 (RICO Definitions). 19 Case
5:24-cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 20 of 45 60. Title 18
U.S.C. § 1343 states: "Whoever, having devised or intending to devise any
scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means
of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, transmits or
causes to be transmitted by means of wire, radio, or television
communication in interstate or foreign commerce, any writings, signs,
signals, pictures, or sounds for the purpose of executing such scheme or
artifice, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years,
or both." 61. The facts above establish all three elements of wire fraud
under 18 U.S.C. § 1343-a scheme to defraud, use of interstate wire
communications, and intent to deprive another of money or property-
qualifying it as a RICO predicate act under 18 U.S.C. § 1961. A. Scheme to

=== PAGE 9 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Defraud 62. The first element of wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343 is the
existence of "a scheme to defraud." As noted in United States v. Greenberg,
835 F.3d 295 (2nd Cir. 2016), this constitutes an "essential element" of the
crime. In the present case, Myers transferred $1,576 from a joint marital
PNC account to Branthoover's PayPal account, depleting the account
entirely. This transfer was not an isolated action but was accompanied by "a
series of coordinated text messages and phone calls" between Myers and
Branthoover regarding the scheme, and followed after a deceptive message
was sent from Branthoover to Plaintiff. 63. The coordination between the
parties through multiple communications channels demonstrates a
deliberate plan rather than a spontaneous or inadvertent action. As
a1ticulated in Mail and Wire Fraud, a "scheme to defraud requires a
material falsehood, material misrepresentation, or the concealment of a
material fact." By 20 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed 06/24/25
Page 21 of 45 transferring funds from a joint marital account without
apparent authorization from the joint account holder, Myers engaged in
conduct that reflects the concealment of material facts regarding the
disposition of marital assets. 64. The scheme in this case specifically
targeted marital funds, and community property, which are legally
considered shared property between spouses. By depleting the account,
Myers intentionally deprived the Plaintiff of access to funds to which he was
legally entitled. This satisfies the requirement that the scheme have "money
or property as the object of the scheme" as stated in Smulley v. Fed Haus.
Fin. Agency, 17-2666 (2nd Cir. Oct 05, 2018). B. Use of Interstate Wire
Communications 65. The second element of wire fraud requires the "use of
the mails or wires to further the scheme." United States v. Greenberg, 835 F.
3d 295 (2nd Cir. 2016). The facts demonstrate that Myers used interstate
wire communications in two distinct ways: 1. The transfer of $1,576 was
"executed via interstate wire (bank to Pay Pal)," which constitutes an
electronic transmission across state lines. 11. The transfer "was
accompanied by a series of coordinated text messages and phone calls
between Myers (in Texas) and Branthoover (in Oklahoma) regarding the
scheme." 66. Wire transmissions include interstate telephone calls or
electronic transmissions. Furthermore, internet communications satisfy the
interstate nexus 21 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page
22 of 45 requirement, even in the absence of proof that a fraudulent
communication traveled through out-of-state servers. 67. The interstate
nature of these communications is established by the fact that Myers was in
Texas while Branthoover was in Oklahoma during their communications
about the scheme. This satisfies the jurisdictional requirement that the wire
communication cross state lines. C. Intend to Defraud 68. The third element
requires that the defendant acted "with the intent to defraud." As stated in
US. v. Blackmon, 839 F.2d 900 (2nd Cir. 1988), the wire fraud statute
requires that the defendant "be a party to some kind of scheme to defraud, a
requirement that includes a high degree of scienter and moral culpability."
69. Here, Branthoover specifically stated that he wanted to help Plaintiff,
which he knew was not a true statement at the time. The fact that text and
phone communications were used to deceive Plaintiff into believing that
Myers' interstate travel would be beneficial for him further supports a
scheme to defraud, because the transfer of funds occmTed after this false
extension of help from Branthoover. 70. In summary, the facts presented
establish all required elements of wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343,

=== PAGE 10 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
qualifying it as a predicate act for RICO purposes under 18 U.S.C. § 1961,
committed by both Defendants. D. Potential Defenses 71. One potential
defense might be that Myers, as a joint account holder, had legal authority
to transfer funds from the account. However, this authority does not extend
to 22 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 23 of 45
depleting the account for personal gain in coordination with a third party
with the intent to deprive the other account holder of their rightful access to
the funds. The joint nature of the account creates a fiduciary duty to act in
good faith regarding the shared asset. That fiduciary duty was willingly
violated when Myers chose to transfer the funds to Branthoover's Pay Pal,
and then later to herself. The appropriate method would have been for
Myers to transfer the funds directly to herself, but she avoided this to
conceal her bank account information in furtherance of a broader scheme.
72. This argument fails because the proceeds from the transfer were used to
acquire a second phone in furtherance of the broader scheme. VII.
PREDICATE ACT-VIOLATION OF THE TRAVEL ACT (18 U.S.C. § 1952) 73.
Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations contained in
paragraphs 1 through 72 above, as if fully set forth herein. 74. The Travel
Act, codified at 18 U.S.C. § 1952, criminalizes interstate travel or the use of
interstate facilities with the intent to promote, manage, establish, carry on,
or facilitate unlawful activity, followed by the performance or attempted
performance of such acts. According to 18 U.S.C. § 1952: "Whoever travels
in interstate or foreign commerce or uses the mail or any facility in
interstate or foreign commerce, with intent to- ... otherwise promote,
manage, establish, carry on, or facilitate the promotion, management,
establishment, or can-ying on, of any unlawful activity, and thereafter
performs or attempts to perform- ... an act described in paragraph or shall
be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both ... " 75.
The statute has three essential elements: 1. Interstate travel or use of
interstate facilities 23 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed 06/24/25
Page 24 of 45 ii. Intent to promote, manage, establish, carry on, or facilitate
unlawful activity iii. Subsequent performance or attempted performance of
acts in fmtherance of the unlawful activity 76. For a Travel Act violation to
serve as a RICO predicate act, it must be "indictable" under 18 U.S.C. §
1952. Myers' conduct, as analyzed above, satisfies all elements of a Travel
Act violation: 1. Myers engaged in interstate travel between Texas and
Oklahoma. 11. Myers traveled with the specific intent to coordinate the
preparation of fraudulent court documents and execute a criminal scheme.
Under United States v. Compton, 355 F.2d 872 (6th Cir. 1966), this intent
can be inferred from "evidence of a substantial course of illegal conduct,
occurring a reasonable time before and after an act of interstate travel." The
preparation of fraudulent court documents falls within the definition of
"unlawful activity" under the Travel Act, as it involves fraud, which is
indictable under state law. iii. After the interstate travel, Myers engaged in
overt acts to fu1ther the unlawful activity by preparing fraudulent legal
documents and coordinating the fraudulent scheme. As U.S. v. Admon, 940 F.
2d 1121 (8th Cir. 1991) clarified, the conduct after travel need not itself be
unlawful but must further the unlawful activity. The preparation and use of
fraudulent documents clearly meet this requirement. 24 Case 5:24-cv-01311-
R Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 25 of 45 77. Given that Myers' conduct
satisfies all elements of a Travel Act violation, this violation qualifies as an
"indictable" offense under 18 U.S.C. § 1952. As such, it constitutes a valid

=== PAGE 11 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
predicate act for RICO purposes under 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1). 78. The Supreme
Court's explanation in Perrin v. United States, 444 U.S. 37 ( 1979) that the
Travel Act was intended to provide "a second layer of enforcement" for
interstate criminal activity underscores the significance of federalizing
crimes that cross state lines. Myers' conduct, involving interstate travel for
the purpose of engaging in fraudulent activities, is precisely the type of
behavior that the Travel Act was designed to address. VIII. PATTERN OF
RACKETEERING ACTIVITY 79. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by
reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 78 above, as if
fully set forth herein. 80. A "pattern of racketeering activity" requires at
least two acts of "racketeering activity" occun'ing within a ten-year period.
18 U.S.C. § 1961 (2025) ('"pattern of racketeering activity' requires at least
two acts of racketeering activity, one of which occwTed after the effective
date of this chapter and the last of which occurred within ten years
( excluding any period of imprisonment) after the commission of a prior act
of racketeering activity"). 81. However, the mere existence of two predicate
acts is not automatically sufficient to establish a pattern. As explained in
Bonton v. Archer Chrysler Plymouth, Inc., 889 F.Supp. 995 (S.D. Tex. 1995):
25 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 26 of 45
"Although at least two acts of racketeering are necessary to constitute a
pattern, two acts may not be sufficient. Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., 473
U.S. 479,496 n. 14, 105 S.Ct. 3275, 3285 n. 14, 87 L.Ed.2d 346 (1985).
RICO's legislative history leaves no doubt that 'there is something to a RICO
pattern beyond simply the number of predicate acts involved."' 82. Instead,
courts have established that to prove a pattern, the predicate acts must be
both related and continuous. Bustos v. Invierte En Tex. , 4:22-CV-02690 (S.D.
Tex. Jun 03, 2024) ("To rise to the level of 'racketeering activity' there must
be two or more predicate acts that are: (1) related; and (2) amount to or
pose a threat of continued criminal activity."). A. Establishing a Pattern of
Racketeering Activity 83. The factual allegations identify several instances
that constitute wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343 and violations of the Travel
Act under 18 U.S.C. § 1952: 1. The extensive text message communications
(92 exchanges) on December 14, 2023, between Myers and Branthoover
using interstate wire facilities to coordinate their scheme. 11. Branthoover's
deceptive phone call to Plaintiff on December 15, 2023, where he falsely
stated, "I've been where you are before. I want to help both of you," to
facilitate Myers' interstate travel to Oklahoma. 111. The interstate wire
transfer of $1,576 from the joint marital account to Branthoover's PayPal
account, which was executed to deprive Plaintiff of funds. 26 Case 5:24-
cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 27 of 45 iv. Branthoover's text
messages to Plaintiff on December 16, 2023, refusing to return the
transferred funds and offering to "help with the paperwork." v.
Branthoover's text message on December 18, 2023, falsely claiming to be a
legal representative. v1. The ongoing interstate communications between
Myers and Branthoover to further their fraudulent scheme, continuing
through May 2025. 84. The factual allegations also demonstrate potential
Travel Act violations: 1. Myers' interstate travel from Texas to Oklahoma on
December 15, 2023, with the intent to prepare fraudulent court documents.
11. The interstate transportation of fraudulent documents from Oklahoma
back to Texas on December 17, 2023, intended for filing in Texas courts. iii.
The use of interstate facilities (phone calls, text messages) to coordinate and
further the fraudulent scheme. B. Relatedness of Predicate Acts 85. The

=== PAGE 12 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
predicate acts of wire fraud and Travel Act violations are clearly related,
meeting the standard outlined in Bonton v. Archer Chrysler Plymouth, Inc.,
889 F.Supp. 995 (S.D. Tex. 1995). They share: 27 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R
Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 28 of 45 i. Common Purpose: All acts were
directed toward depriving Plaintiff of his property rights and manipulating
judicial proceedings to benefit Myers in divorce proceedings. 11. Same
Participants: Myers and Branthoover were the consistent actors in all
predicate acts. 111. Same Victim: All acts targeted Plaintiff, causing him
financial harm and depriving him of legal rights. 1v. Similar Methods: The
acts consistently involved deception, misrepresentation, and the
manipulation of legal processes. v. Temporal Connection: The acts occurred
in a logical sequence, beginning on December 14, 2023, and continuing
through May 2025. C. Continuity of Racketeering Activity 86. The pattern of
racketeering activity demonstrates both closed-ended and openended
continuity: 1. Closed-ended Continuity: The scheme extends over a
substantial period- from December 2023 through May 2025, over eighteen
months. This satisfies the requirement for "a series of related predicate acts
extending over a substantial period of time" as described in RICO: A Primer
(2022). 2 2 https://freemanlaw.com/rico-a-primer/ 28 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R
Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 29 of 45 11. Open-ended Continuity: The
scheme also poses a threat of continued criminal activity. Branthoover's
message on May 24, 2025, demonstrating continued monitoring of Plaintiffs
activities and threatening future retaliation, indicates that the racketeering
activity could continue indefinitely given that they are unable to finalize the
divorce. This satisfies the alternative requirement for "a threat of continuing
criminal activity extending indefinitely into the future" noted in RICO: A
Primer (2022). D. Role of Perjury and Subornation of Perjury 87. While
perjury and subornation of perjury in state court proceedings are not
themselves listed as predicate acts under RICO, they form an integral part of
the overall criminal scheme and help establish the pattern of racketeering
activity when considered alongside the actual predicate acts of wire fraud
and Travel Act violations. 88. As explained in RICO: A Primer (2022),
racketeering acts need not be similar or directly related to each other; they
must simply be "related in some way to the affairs of the charged
enterprise." The perjury and subornation of perjury evident in the fraudulent
court filings- including the false statements in the divorce petition, the
Affidavit oflndigency, and the Application for Protective Order-are directly
related to the predicate acts of wire fraud and Travel Act violations. They
share the same purpose, involve the same participants, target the same
victim, and form part of the same overall scheme. For example: 29 Case
5:24-cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 30 of 45 1. The
fraudulent court documents were prepared during Myers' interstate travel
to Oklahoma, connecting the perjury to the Travel Act violation. 11. The
false statements in these documents were discussed and planned via
interstate wire communications, connecting the perjury to the wire fraud.
111. The deceptive interstate wire transfer of funds was executed to support
Myers during the divorce proceedings initiated through fraudulent filings. iv.
The perjerous statements were influenced by Branthoover, connecting
subordination of perjury to the predicate acts. 89. These connections
demonstrate how the non-predicate acts of perjury committed by Myers and
subornation of perjury alleged against Branthoover, while not sufficient
alone to establish a RICO violation, contribute to the overall pattern of

=== PAGE 13 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
racketeering activity when combined with the predicate acts of wire fraud
and Travel Act violations alleged by the Defendants. IX. ESTABLISHING AN
ASSOCIATE-IN-FACT ENTERPRISE 90. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates
by reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 89 above, as
if fully set forth herein. 30 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed
06/24/25 Page 31 of 45 A. Formation of the Enterprise 91. The factual
allegations demonstrate the formation of an associate-in-fact enterprise
between Myers and Branthoover that satisfies the definition in 18 U.S.C. §
1961 (2025). i. Myers and Branthoover associated for the common purpose
of depriving Plaintiff of his property rights through the manipulation of legal
proceedings. This shared objective is evident from their coordinated actions
beginning on December 14, 2023, immediately following Plaintiffs discovery
of Myers' affair. ii. Though informal, the enterprise had a clear
organizational structure as 1) Myers acted as the "inside" operative, with
direct access to marital assets and the ability to file fraudulent court
documents in Texas. 2) Branthoover served as the "outside" operative,
providing administrative oversight, expertise on protective orders due to his
prior criminal history (Paragraph 18), and a base of operations in Oklahoma.
3) Their respective roles complemented each other and demonstrated an
organized approach to their criminal scheme. iii. The enterprise functioned
as a continuing unit from December 2023 through May 2025, with
consistent roles and coordinated actions throughout this period. 31 Case
5:24-cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 32 of 45 B. Maintenance
of the Enterprise 92. The enterprise was maintained through several key
mechanisms: 1. Continuous Communication: Myers and Branthoover
maintained regular interstate communications throughout the scheme,
beginning with the 92 text messages on December 14, 2023, and continuing
through May 2025. 11. Financial Support: The interstate wire transfer of
$1,576 from the joint marital account to Branthoover's Pay Pal account
provided financial resources to support the enterprise's activities. 111.
Operational Security Measures: The enterprise implemented specific
measures to protect its operations: 1) Myers acquired a secondary phone
number during her Oklahoma visit (Paragraph 38). 1v. Myers returned with
pepper spray to support the false domestic violence narrative (Paragraph
37). v. Branthoover attempted to control communications by falsely claiming
legal representation (Paragraph 40). v1. Geographic Distribution: The
enterprise maintained operations across state lines, with activities in both
Texas and Oklahoma, enhancing its ability to avoid detection and complicate
legal responses. 32 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page
33 of 45 C. Enterprise Distinct from Racketeering Activity 93. As Allstate
Ins. Co. v. Donovan, CIVIL ACTION NO. H-12-0432 (S.D. Tex. Jul 03, 2012)
reiterates, a RICO enterprise must be an entity 'separate and apart from the
alleged pattern of racketeering'-not merely a conduit for the predicate acts
themselves. The nature and duration of the Myers-Branthoover operation
exhibits all three required elements: a separate organizational purpose,
defined roles within an enduring structure, and coordinated decision-making
extending beyond the January 16, 2024 initial outcome, with the finalization
of the scheme still pending. X. CLAIMS FOR RELIEF COUNT 1: VIOLATION
OF 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) Against All Defendants 94. Plaintiff realleges and
incorporates by reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through
93 above, as if fully set forth herein. 95. At all relevant times, Plaintiff was a
person within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961(3) and 1964(c). 96. At all

=== PAGE 14 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
relevant times, each Defendant was a person within the meaning of 18
U.S.C. §§ 1961(3) and 1962(c). 97. As set forth above, Defendants Myers and
Branthoover formed an associationin- fact enterprise within the meaning of
18 U.S.C. § 1961(4) (the "Enterprise"). The Enterprise was engaged in, and
its activities affected, interstate commerce. 98. The Enterprise had an
ascertainable structure separate and apart from the pattern of racketeering
activity in which the Defendants engaged. The Enterprise 33 Case 5:24-
cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 34 of 45 maintained an
existence beyond that which was necessary to commit the predicate acts
constituting the pattern of racketeering activity. 99. In furtherance of the
fraudulent scheme, each Defendant conducted or participated, directly or
indirectly, in the conduct of the Enterprise's affairs through a pattern of
racketeering activity within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961(1), 1961(5),
and 1962(c). 100. As detailed above, the Defendants committed multiple
related acts of wire fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1343 and Travel Act
violations under 18 U.S.C. § 1952, and further committed acts of perjury and
subordinated perjury in furtherance of the scheme, constituting a pattern of
racketeering activity as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5). 101. The predicate
acts committed by the Defendants were related to each other in that they
had the same or similar purposes (to defraud Plaintiff of his property
interests and manipulate judicial proceedings), involved the same
participants (Defendants Myers and Branthoover), targeted the same victim
(Plaintiff), employed similar methods ( deception, misrepresentation, and
manipulation of legal processes), and were not isolated events. 102. The
predicate acts committed by the Defendants demonstrate both closedended
continuity, spanning over eighteen months from December 2023 through
May 2025, and open-ended continuity, as evidenced by the ongoing threats
and monitoring activities continuing through May 2025, with the potential
for continued criminal activity in the future. 34 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R
Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 35 of 45 103. The Defendants participated
in the operation and management of the Enterprise by making decisions on
behalf of the Enterprise and by directing its affairs. Specifically: 1.
Defendant Myers directed the Enterprise by initiating the criminal scheme,
communicating the scheme's objectives to Branthoover, opening a private
bank account, transferring marital funds, traveling interstate to coordinate
fraudulent document preparation, and filing fraudulent legal documents in
Texas courts. 11. Defendant Branthoover directed the Enterprise by
providing administrative oversight of the scheme, offering his expertise on
protective order procedures, coordinating Myers' interstate travel, receiving
and retaining fraudulently transferred funds, preparing fraudulent legal
documents, and attempting to exert control over communications related to
the legal proceedings. l04. As a direct and proximate result of the
Defendants' violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), Plaintiff has been injured in his
business and property in an amount to be dete1mined at trial. Specifically,
Plaintiff has suffered: 1. Loss of $1,576 fraudulently transferred from the
joint marital account; 11. Business losses resulting from the disrnption of his
home-based business operations; 111. Additional financial damages
resulting from the overdrawn account 35 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R Document
16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 36 of 45 and associated fees; 1v. Loss of real and
personal property rights through the fraudulent manipulation of judicial
proceedings; v1. Ongoing damages resulting from the continued operation
of the Enterprise. 105. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c), Plaintiff is entitled to

=== PAGE 15 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
recover from the Defendants threefold the damages sustained, explained in
more detail below. COUNT 2: VIOLATION OF 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d) Against All
Defendants 106. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the
allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 105 above, as if fully set forth
herein. 107. Beginning on December 14, 2023, and continuing through at
least May 24, 2025, the Defendants knowingly, willfully, and unlawfully
conspired to violate 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), that is, to conduct and participate,
directly and indirectly, in the conduct of the affairs of the Enterprise,
through a pattern of racketeering activity, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d),
as explained above. 108. The conspiracy between Myers and Branthoover
was formed on or about December 14, 2023, evidenced by the intensive
communications (92 text messages) exchanged between them immediately
following Plaintiffs discovery of Myers' extramarital affair. These
communications---documented in Plaintiff's possession and available for
production at the appropriate stage---demonstrate the deliberate and
coordinated formation of the conspiracy. 36 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R Document
16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 37 of 45 109. Each Defendant agreed that they
would commit at least two acts of racketeering activity in the conduct of the
affairs of the Enterprise. The agreement can be infened from the
Defendants' coordinated actions, including: 1. The systematic coordination
of their activities through interstate communications; 11. The division of
responsibilities within the Enterprise; iii. The implementation of operational
security measures; IV. The consistent pattern of actions furthering the
fraudulent scheme; v. The ongoing coordination over an eighteen-month
period. 110. In furtherance of the conspiracy, the Defendants committed
numerous overt acts, including but not limited to: I. Myers opening a private
bank account to facilitate asset concealment on December 14, 2023 and
sharing these details with Branthoover; ii. Myers and Branthoover
exchanging 92 text messages on December 14, 2023, to coordinate their
criminal plans; m. Branthoover placing a deceptive phone call to Plaintiff on
December 15, 2023; IV. Myers executing an interstate wire transfer of
$1,576 to Branthoover's PayPal account on December 15, 2023; v. Myers
traveling interstate to Oklahoma on December 15, 2023, to coordinate with
Branthoover; vi. Myers and Branthoover preparing fraudulent cowt
documents in 37 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 38
of 45 Oklahoma on December 16-17, 2023 to be later submitted in Texas
courts on December 18,22; vu. Myers transporting the fraudulent
documents back to Texas on December 17, 2023; vm. Branthoover sending
threatening text messages to Plaintiff on December 18, 2023; 1x. Myers
filing fraudulent documents with Texas courts on December 18, 2023; x.
Myers filing a fraudulent Application for Protective Order on December 22,
2023; x1. Branthoover continuing to send threatening communications to
Plaintiff through May 24, 2025. 111. As a direct and proximate result of the
Defendants' conspiracy in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d), Plaintiff has been
injured in his business and property. The injuries suffered by Plaintiff include
but are not limited to: 1. Loss of $1,576 fraudulently transferred from the
joint marital account; ii. Business losses resulting from the dismption of his
home-based business operations; iii. Additional financial damages resulting
from the overdrawn account and associated fees; 1v. Loss of real and
personal property rights through the fraudulent 38 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R
Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 39 of 45 manipulation of judicial
proceedings; v. Ongoing economic harm resulting from the continued

=== PAGE 16 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
operation of the Enterprise. 112. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c), Plaintiff is
entitled to recover from the Defendants threefold the damages sustained,
explained in more detail below. XI. Damages 113. Plaintiff realleges and
incorporates by reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through
112 above, as if fully set forth herein. 114. As a direct result of the
racketeering activity alleged herein, the Plaintiff has sustained substantial
injury to his business operations, suffered significant credit decrease, has
lost business opportunities, had his personal belongings destroyed, has had
one vehicle repossessed, and has been subject to transient and unstable
housing. A. Damage to Business Operations 11 5. In January of 2021,
Plaintiff founded a digital financial analytics business from his home,
focused on delivering real-time stock market data, automated technical
indicators, and live market commentary to retail traders and boutique
investment groups across the United States and Canada. His monetization
model included tiered subscription plans, custom data feed licensing, and
API endpoints that offered real-time market data. 116. By 2022, client
demand and revenue growth began outpacing Plaintiff's initial architecture.
In response, Plaintiff made the strategic decision to pause direct
monetization in early 2023 to reinvest in infrastructure and ensure the
platform could handle commercial-scale traffic. This included: 39 Case 5:24-
cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 40 of 45 1. Designing and
deploying asynchronous financial signal algorithms, 11. Mastering
asynchronous programming, PostgreSQL and NoSQL systems for storage
and efficiency purposes, iii. Building websocket-based dashboards for live
data streaming, iv. Drafting licensing terms for premium indicator access
and reseller API use. v. Building pa1tnerships and affiliations with similar
businesses in the market-data space. This period of reinvestment came at
significant cost: Plaintiff temporarily sacrificed a revenue stream that had
reached $12,000 per month at its peak in exchange for longterm scalability.
Plaintiff anticipated a short-term revenue dip, which he strategically
absorbed in reliance on his imminent reentry to market. 117. By September
of 2023, Plaintiff had completed core backend optimization and UI
integrations and obtained an affiliate marketing partnership with polygon.io
and was prepared to scale user acquisition and marketing. This readiness
marked a significant inflection point in Plaintiff's commercial trajectory. 118.
Plaintiff reasonably projected a return to $9,000-$10,000/month by mid-
2024, with a 24-month growth model targeting $170,124.59 in revenue
through subscriptions and data services alone. This forecast was based not
on speculation, but on verified revenue history, platform readiness, and
documented user engagement trends. 119. As part of Defendants'
coordinated scheme to deprive Plaintiff of his home and operational
capacity, Plaintiff was wrongfully and suddenly removed from the family 40
Case 5:24-cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 41 of 45 residence
in January 2024, despite Defendants' full knowledge that he operated an
active and income-generating business from that location. This action
caused a direct and immediate injury to Plaintiff's business, cutting off his
ability to scale as planned. Instead of growing, Plaintiff's revenue collapsed.
120. The removal was executed without warning or legal justification and
had an immediate effect on Plaintiff's operations. Although the core data
systems were technically portable, the business depended on commercial-
grade internet, low-latency upload speeds, and a consistent, uninterrupted
digital environment to support real-time financial analytics, streaming, and

=== PAGE 17 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
API-based services. Following the removal, Plaintiff was unable to find
alternate housing with sufficient bandwidth. Attempts to work from
temporary family residences failed, as Plaintiff's usage either exceeded
available internet capacity or interfered with household connectivity, making
it impossible to maintain stable service. Without the ability to stream,
deliver data products, or support his clients, Plaintiffs revenue quickly
declined and client engagement deteriorated. 121. Between September and
December 2023, Plaintiff earned $10,529.72, averaging $2,632.43 per
month - his baseline earnings during the period of restructuring. Based on
past performance, technical stability, and confirmed subscriber growth
through marketing strategies, Plaintiff reasonably projected returning to
$5,000/month by mid- 2024, with stable, scalable performance continuing
through 2025. 122. Under a conservative model, had the business not been
disrupted by Defendants' interference, Plaintiff would have earned: 41 Case
5:24-cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 42 of 45 1.
Approximately $15,794.58 during the first half of 2024 (maintaining his pre-
removal baseline), ii. Approximately $24,000.00 during the second half of
2024 (with moderate growth to $4,000/month), 111. And approximately
$60,000.00 across 2025 (at $5,000/month). This yields a total projected
income of$99,794.58 for the 18-month period following the wrongful
removal. 123. Accordingly, Plaintiff seeks recovery of $99,794.58 in lost
business income directly caused by Defendants' pattern of racketeering
activity described above. B. Damages - Fraudulent Transfer and Cessation of
Business Advertisements 124. As noted above, Defendants coordinated in
emptying the joint marital PNC bank account, transferring $1,576.00 from
Plaintiff to a Pay Pal account controlled by Daniel Kenneth Branthoover,
which was subsequently routed to Morgan Michelle Myers. These funds
were used to purchase a second phone for Myers, enabling concealed
communication and coordination between Defendants in furtherance of their
scheme to defraud Plaintiff and obstruct his business operations.
Accordingly, Plaintiff therefore seeks recovery of the full amount of
$1,576.00. D. Damages - Total 126. As a direct result of the Defendants'
coordinated and fraudulent conduct detailed above, Plaintiff has sustained
total economic losses in the amount of one hundred and one thousand three
hundred seventy dollars and fifty-eight cents. ($101,370.58). This 42 Case
5:24-cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 43 of 45 includes: i. $99,
794.58 in lost business income caused by Defendant's actions leading to
Plaintiff's wrongful removal from his residence and the destruction of his
operational infrastructure over the last 18 months; 11. $1,576.00 in marital
funds fraudulently transferred from Plaintiff's joint bank account in
furtherance of a scheme to defraud. 127. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c),
Plaintiff is entitled to treble damages for injuries sustained to his business
and property because of Defendants' racketeering activity. Accordingly,
Plaintiff seeks an award of treble damages in the total estimated amount of
three hundred and four thousand, one hundred and eleven dollars and
seventyfour cents ($304,111.74) to be further clarified at trial. 128. All
damages referenced herein are based on verifiable records and financial
documentation. Plaintiff will produce supporting evidence and exhibits at
the appropriate stage of these proceedings or at trial. Xll. PRAYER FOR
RELIEF 129. WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Charles Dustin Myers respectfully
requests that this Court enter judgment against Defendants Daniel Kenneth
Branthoover and Morgan Michelle Myers as follows: 1. For a specific finding

ORDER Before the Court is Defendant Daniel Kenneth Branthoover’s Motion
to Dismiss [Doc. No. 18], as well as Defendant Morgan Michelle Myers’
Motion to Dismiss [Doc. No. 24]. Plaintiff Charles Dustin Myers responded
[Doc. Nos. 21 & 28], and Defendant Branthoover filed a reply brief [Doc. No.
25]. The matter is now at issue.1 For the reasons that follow, the Motions
are GRANTED. BACKGROUND On December 14, 2023, Plaintiff allegedly
discovered that his wife, Defendant Myers, was having an affair [Doc. No.
16, ¶ 19]. That same day, Defendant Myers opened a private bank account
and exchanged several text messages with Defendant Branthoover. Id. The
next day, Defendant Myers transferred $1,576.00 from her joint account
with Plaintiff to Defendant Branthoover, then traveled to Defendant
Branthoover’s home in 1 All parties to this action are proceeding pro se. The
Court therefore gives the pleadings a liberal construction but does not act as
an advocate. See Hall v. Bellmon, 935 F.2d 1106, 1110 (10th Cir. 1991). Case

draft allegedly fraudulent legal documents. Id. ¶¶ 23, 25. This transfer
caused the account to be overdrawn, which harmed Plaintiff’s business. Id. ¶
26. Plaintiff contends that this transfer constitutes wire fraud in violation of
18 U.S.C. § 1343, and that Defendant Myers’ trip to Oklahoma violated the
Travel Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1952. Id. ¶¶ 25, 59, 74. On December 17, 2023,
Defendant Myers allegedly “completed the interstate transportation phase
of the criminal scheme by transporting the fraudulent court documents
prepared in Oklahoma back across state lines to Texas. Id. ¶ 35. These
documents were filed in a Texas court the next day. Id. ¶ 39. On January 16,
2024, Plaintiff was ordered to vacate the home he shared with Defendant

Myers. Id. ¶ 47. According to Plaintiff, this marked the achievement of
Defendants’ primary criminal objective. Id. ¶¶ 47-48. Plaintiff filed this civil
RICO suit under 18 U.S.C. §§ 1962(c) and (d). Defendants have moved to
dismiss for failure to state a claim and improper venue.2 LEGAL STANDARD
Dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) is proper when a complaint fails “to state a
claim upon which relief can be granted[.]” Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). “To
survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the complaint ‘must contain sufficient factual
matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its
face.’” Brown v. City of Tulsa, 124 F.4th 1251, 1263 (10th Cir. 2025) (quoting
Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009)). And while the Court “must
accept the truth of all properly alleged facts and draw all reasonable
inferences in 2 The Court notes that based on Plaintiff’s allegations, a
substantial part of the events giving rise to the litigation occurred in this
District, and therefore venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2). Case
5:24-cv-01311-R Document 29 Filed 08/28/25 Page 2 of 8 3 the plaintiff’s
favor, the plaintiff still ‘must nudge the claim across the line from
conceivable or speculative to plausible.’” Id. (quoting Brooks v. Mentor
Worldwide LLC, 985 F.3d 1272, 1281 (10th Cir. 2021)). “Mere ‘labels and
conclusions’ or ‘formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action’ will
not suffice.” Id. (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570
(2007)). DISCUSSION “To plead a valid RICO claim, a plaintiff must
plausibly allege that a defendant ‘(1) conducted the affairs (2) of an
enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity.’” Johnson v.
Heath, 56 F.4th 851, 858 (10th Cir. 2022) (quoting George v. Urb. Settlement
Servs., 833 F.3d 1242, 1248 (10th Cir. 2016)). Because the Court finds that
Plaintiff did not adequately allege a pattern of racketeering activity, it tailors
its analysis to that element. “[A] RICO pattern requires that the racketeering
predicates relate to each other and amount to a threat of continued
racketeering activity.” Id. (citing H.J. Inc. v. Nw. Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229,
239 (1989)). “[R]acketeering predicates relate to each other if they ‘have the
same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of
commission, or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics
and are not isolated events.’” Id. at 859 (quoting H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 240).
“Predicate acts satisfy the relationship requirement when they make up one
common scheme.” Id. (citing Sil-Flo, Inc. v. SFHC, Inc., 917 F.2d 1507, 1516
(10th Cir. 1990)). The standard is “‘not a cumbersome one.’” Id. (quoting
Bixler v. Foster, 596 F.3d 751, 761 (10th Cir. 2010)). Case 5:24-cv-01311-R
Document 29 Filed 08/28/25 Page 3 of 8 4 The continuity requirement on the
other hand is “more stringent than the relationship standard.” Id. (citing
Bixler, 596 F.3d at 761). Continuity “‘depends on the facts of each case[],’”
id. (quoting H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 241-42), and “can be either closed or open
ended[,]” id. (citing H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 241). “Closed-ended continuity is a
closed period of repeated racketeering conduct, while open-ended continuity
consists of racketeering conduct that threatens future repetition.” Id. (citing
H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 241). “Plaintiffs can establish open-ended continuity by
showing that the racketeering acts involved implicit or explicit threats of
repetition, that they formed the operations of an association that exists for
criminal purposes, or that they were the defendants’ regular way of
conducting a legitimate enterprise.” Id. at 859-60 (citing H.J. Inc., 492 U.S.
at 242-43). “[C]losed-ended continuity consists of a closed period of
repeated, related racketeering acts that do not necessarily threaten future
repetition.” Id. at 860 (citing H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 241-42). And “[b]ecause

=== PAGE 20 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
RICO targets long-term racketeering conduct, closed-ended continuity
requires a series of related racketeering acts over a ‘substantial period of
time.’” Id. (quoting H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 242). Two factors are relevant to
determine whether there is closed-ended continuity: “the duration of the
related predicate acts and the extensiveness of the racketeering scheme. Id.
(citation omitted). Regarding the first factor, “predicate acts extending over
a few weeks or months do not show closed-ended continuity.” Poindexter v.
Stuteville, No. CIV-12-0031-F, 2012 WL 13035041, at *7 (W.D. Okla. May 10,
2012) (citing Resol. Tr. Corp. v. Stone, 998 F.2d 1534, 1543 (10th Cir. 1993)),
abrogated on other grounds by Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938 (2009)).
For the second factor, courts “consider ‘the number of victims, the number
of racketeering acts, Case 5:24-cv-01311-R Document 29 Filed 08/28/25
Page 4 of 8 5 the variety of racketeering acts, whether the injuries were
distinct, the complexity and size of the scheme, and the nature or character
of the enterprise.’” Johnson, 56 F.4th at 860 (quoting Resol. Tr. Corp., 998 F.
2d at 1543). Plaintiff alleges that Defendants’ “scheme extends over a
substantial period of time—from December 2023 through May 2025, over
eighteen months[,]” Doc. No. 16, ¶ 86(i). The predicate acts—wire fraud and
violation of the Travel Act—took place within days of each other in
December of 2023. Id. ¶¶ 83-84. Plaintiff claims that Defendants’ alleged
scheme “achieved its primary criminal objective” on January 16, 2024, when
he was ordered to vacate the family home. Id. ¶ 47. So it took just over one
month from the formation of the alleged enterprise to complete its primary
goal. Nevertheless, Plaintiff points to the following to demonstrate the
duration of the scheme: • Defendants’ continued interstate communication
regarding the case “in direct furtherance of their fraudulent scheme to see
the divorce through to its finalization[;]” • Defendant Branthoover’s June 23,
2024, text message to Plaintiff stating “Lol. And here comes another
denial[;]” • Defendant Branthoover’s December 12, 2024, text message to
Plaintiff stating "When things all over you get to deal with me. Just a heads
up[;]” • Defendant Branthoover’s statement “I’ve been enjoying watching
every filing get denied[;]” and • Defendant Branthoover’s May 24, 2025, text
message to Plaintiff stating “Where’s my lawsuit? Heard your vm about me.
File it. Let’s do this :)[.]” Id. ¶¶ 49-52. But the communications between
Defendants and the text messages from Defendant Branthoover are not
related to the initial scheme, nor do they show continuity sufficient to
demonstrate a pattern of racketeering activities. Case 5:24-cv-01311-R
Document 29 Filed 08/28/25 Page 5 of 8 6 Beginning with the relatedness
prong, Plaintiff does not allege that the text messages from Defendant
Branthoover were sent with the intention of defrauding Plaintiff of money, or
to create and file fraudulent court documents. See Doc. No. 16, ¶ 101
(claiming that the purpose of the predicate acts was “to defraud Plaintiff of
his property interests and manipulate judicial proceedings”). Instead, he
alleges that these texts evidence retaliation, malice, and involvement in the
Texas litigation. Id. ¶¶ 49-52. Aside from being temporally distinct, the
messages are distinct in character from the initial alleged scheme and do
not evidence criminal conduct. And as for the alleged interstate
communications between Defendants regarding the case, this allegation is
conclusory and does not demonstrate that the communications relate to the
initial common scheme to defraud Plaintiff and to file false documents
created across state lines. Id. ¶ 101. Accordingly, Plaintiff has failed to meet
the bar of relatedness sufficient to show a pattern of racketeering activity.3

=== PAGE 21 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
The same is true for the continuity prong of the pattern requirement.
Plaintiff points to the text messages from Defendant Branthoover and the
continuing communication between Defendants as evidence of an implicit or
explicit threat of repetition. But these messages—while taunting—do not
plausibly support a continuing threat of criminal conduct. Neither do the
vaguely pled claims of continued communications between Defendants. So
Plaintiff fails to demonstrate open-ended continuity. 3 Plaintiff alleges that
perjury and subornation of perjury sufficiently connect the predicate acts of
wire fraud and violation of the Travel Act. Doc. No. 16, ¶¶ 87-88. Assuming
without deciding that is true, he still does not relate the text messages and
on-going communication to the predicate acts that were performed in
December of 2023 and successfully completed in January of 2024. Case
5:24-cv-01311-R Document 29 Filed 08/28/25 Page 6 of 8 7 Regarding
closed-ended continuity, “it is well established that a single scheme to
accomplish one discrete goal, directed at a finite group of individuals, with
no potential to extend to other persons or entities, rarely will suffice to
establish a threat of continuing racketeering activity.” Pagel v. Wash. Mut.
Bank, Inc., 153 F. App’x 498, 502 (10th Cir. 2005) (collecting cases). Plaintiff
alleges a scheme that achieved its primary objective within one month of its
formation, harmed only one victim, had no potential to harm others, involved
two predicate acts of an isolated nature, and consisted of two individuals.
And even if the scheme lasted over 18 months, when considering the factors
set out in Resolution Trust, Plaintiff alleges “at best…a closed-ended series
of predicate acts constituting a single scheme to accomplish a discrete goal
directed at only one individual with no potential to extend to other persons
or entities.” Poindexter, 2012 WL 13035041, at *7 (citing Hall v. Witteman,
584 F.3d 859, 867-68 (10th Cir. 2009)). This is insufficient to establish
closed-ended continuity. “Courts have uniformly and consistently held that
schemes involving a single, narrow purpose and one or few participants
directed towards a single victim do not satisfy the RICO requirement of a
closed or open pattern of continuity.” Skurkey v. Daniel, No. CIV-22-496-R,
2023 WL 101946, at *6 (W.D. Okla. Jan. 4, 2023) (citation and quotation
marks omitted). Because that is the exact scheme Plaintiff alleges, he has
failed to plead a viable civil RICO claim regarding Defendants’ purported
scheme.4 4 Plaintiff’s claims for conspiracy under § 1962(d) likewise fails.
See Skurkey, 2023 WL 101946, at *6 (“Because Plaintiff has no viable claim
under § 1962(c), the subsection (d) conspiracy claim fails as a matter of
law.”). Case 5:24-cv-01311-R Document 29 Filed 08/28/25 Page 7 of 8 8
CONCLUSION Accordingly, Defendants’ Motions are GRANTED, and this
case is DISMISSED.5 IT IS SO ORDERED this 28th day of August, 2025. 5

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Short response
The district judge misconstrued the plaintiff’s complaint by improperly
narrowing the scope of the alleged RICO scheme, disregarding the pleaded
continuity and relatedness of predicate acts, and resolving factual disputes
about the pattern of racketeering activity that should have been left to a jury
under Tenth Circuit precedent. The dismissal should be reversed on appeal
because the complaint plausibly alleged a pattern of racketeering activity—
both closed- and open-ended continuity—sufficient to survive a Rule 12(b)(6)
motion.
Summary
The district court dismissed the plaintiff’s civil RICO complaint, finding that
the alleged scheme was a single, short-lived effort directed at one victim,
with no threat of continued criminal activity, and thus failed to plead a
“pattern of racketeering activity” as required by 18 U.S.C. § 1962. However,
the judge erred by (1) failing to credit the complaint’s detailed allegations of
ongoing, related predicate acts spanning over 18 months, (2) misapplying
the continuity and relatedness requirements under Tenth Circuit and
Supreme Court precedent, and (3) deciding factual issues about the
scheme’s scope and duration that are reserved for the jury.
On appeal, the plaintiff should argue that the complaint, when liberally
construed and all reasonable inferences drawn in his favor, plausibly alleged
a pattern of racketeering activity under the standards set by the Tenth
Circuit and Supreme Court. The complaint described multiple, related acts
of wire fraud and Travel Act violations, as well as ongoing threats and
coordination, which—taken as true—are sufficient to state a RICO claim and
require reversal of the dismissal.
Background and Relevant Law
Statutory Framework
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) provides a
civil cause of action for any person injured in business or property by reason
of a violation of section 1962, with treble damages available (18 U.S.C. §
1964). To state a claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), a plaintiff must allege: (1)
conduct, (2) of an enterprise, (3) through a pattern, (4) of racketeering
activity (18 U.S.C. § 1962; 18 U.S.C. § 1961).
A “pattern of racketeering activity” requires at least two predicate acts
within ten years (18 U.S.C. § 1961(5)), but the Supreme Court has made
clear that two acts are necessary but not always sufficient. The acts must be
both related and continuous (H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., as
summarized in Schrag v. Dinges, 788 F.Supp. 1543 (D. Kan. 1992) and 
Kaplan v. Reed, 28 F.Supp.2d 1191 (D. Colo. 1998)). Predicate acts include
wire fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343) and Travel Act violations (18 U.S.C. § 1952).

=== PAGE 23 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
The “relationship” requirement is met if the acts have similar purposes,
results, participants, victims, or methods, or are otherwise interrelated
(UMB Bank v. Monson, 21-CV-2504-EFM (D. Kan. Jun 04, 2025); Schrag v.
Dinges). The “continuity” requirement can be satisfied by either a closed
period of repeated conduct (closed-ended continuity) or a threat of future
repetition (open-ended continuity) (Nation v. Shah, 4:19-cv-00588-JDR-JFJ
(N.D. Okla. Oct 30, 2024); Kaplan v. Reed).
Tenth Circuit and Supreme Court Precedent
The Tenth Circuit has repeatedly held that whether a pattern of racketeering
activity exists is generally a question of fact for the jury (In re Epipen, 336
F.Supp.3d 1256 (D. Kan. 2018); Resolution Trust Corp. v. Stone, 998 F.2d
1534, 1543 (10th Cir. 1993)). The relationship prong is “not a cumbersome
one” (UMB Bank v. Monson), and continuity can be shown by a series of
related acts over a substantial period (closed-ended) or by acts that threaten
future repetition (open-ended) (Johnson v. Heath, 56 F.4th 851, 858-60 (10th
Cir. 2022); H.J. Inc.).
The Tenth Circuit has also cautioned that courts should not resolve factual
disputes about the scope, duration, or extensiveness of the alleged
racketeering scheme at the motion to dismiss stage (In re Epipen). The
plausibility standard under Rule 12(b)(6) requires only that the complaint
state a plausible—not probable—claim, and courts must draw all reasonable
inferences in the plaintiff’s favor (Brown v. City of Tulsa, 124 F.4th 1251,
1263 (10th Cir. 2025)).
Analysis
1. The District Judge Misconstrued the Complaint’s
Allegations
The district judge dismissed the complaint, reasoning that the alleged
scheme was a “single, narrow purpose” directed at one victim, achieved its
primary objective within a month, and thus did not satisfy the continuity
requirement for a RICO pattern. The judge further found that subsequent
communications and threats were not sufficiently related to the initial
predicate acts and did not evidence ongoing criminal conduct.
However, this analysis mischaracterizes the complaint in several ways:
Duration and Continuity: The complaint alleged a series of related
acts—wire fraud, Travel Act violations, and ongoing threats and
coordination—spanning from December 2023 through at least May
2025. The plaintiff specifically pleaded that the defendants continued to
communicate, coordinate, and threaten him in furtherance of their
scheme for over 18 months, not just during a brief window in December
2023 and January 2024. Under Tenth Circuit law, continuity can be
established by a series of related acts over a substantial period or by a
threat of future repetition (Johnson v. Heath; Nation v. Shah; Schrag v.
Dinges).
• 

=== PAGE 24 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Relatedness: The complaint described predicate acts (wire fraud,
Travel Act violations) and subsequent acts (threats, ongoing
coordination) that shared the same purpose (depriving the plaintiff of
property and manipulating judicial proceedings), the same participants
(Myers and Branthoover), the same victim (the plaintiff), and similar
methods (deception, fraud, and manipulation of legal processes). This
satisfies the “relationship” requirement, which is not a high bar (UMB
Bank v. Monson; Kaplan v. Reed).
Open-Ended Continuity: The complaint alleged that the defendants’
conduct posed a threat of continued criminal activity, as evidenced by
ongoing threats, monitoring, and coordination even after the initial
objective was achieved. The Tenth Circuit recognizes that open-ended
continuity can be established by acts that threaten future repetition or
are the regular way of conducting the enterprise’s affairs (Johnson v.
Heath; Nation v. Shah).
Closed-Ended Continuity: The complaint also alleged a series of
related predicate acts over a substantial period (18 months), which, if
proven, could satisfy closed-ended continuity (Schrag v. Dinges; Kaplan
v. Reed).
Factual Disputes for the Jury: The judge’s order resolved factual
disputes about the scope, duration, and extensiveness of the scheme—
issues that are for the jury, not the court, at the pleading stage (In re
Epipen; Resolution Trust Corp.).
2. The Judge’s Legal Reasoning Conflicts with Tenth Circuit
Authority
The judge relied on cases such as Skurkey v. Daniel and Poindexter v.
Stuteville to conclude that a single scheme with a discrete goal, directed at
one victim, rarely suffices for RICO continuity. However, the Tenth Circuit
has also held that the pattern requirement is a flexible, case-specific inquiry,
and that the existence of a pattern is generally a question of fact for the jury
(In re Epipen; Resolution Trust Corp.). The Supreme Court in H.J. Inc.
emphasized that continuity can be shown by either a closed period of
repeated conduct or a threat of future repetition, and that the pattern
requirement should be liberally construed to effectuate RICO’s remedial
purposes (Racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations. (1995-01-01)).
The judge’s order also failed to credit the complaint’s allegations of ongoing
threats and coordination as evidence of open-ended continuity. The Tenth
Circuit has recognized that even a small number of related predicates
occurring close together in time can establish open-ended continuity if they
include a specific threat of repetition extending indefinitely into the future
(Chapter 4. Elements of Cause of Action).
3. The Complaint Satisfies the Plausibility Standard
Under Rule 12(b)(6), the court must accept all well-pleaded facts as true and
draw all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff’s favor (Brown v. City of
•

Tulsa). The plausibility standard is lower than probability, and the court may
not dismiss a complaint simply because it finds a different version of events
more plausible ('Plausible' Deniability). Here, the complaint set out detailed
factual allegations of a coordinated, ongoing scheme involving multiple
predicate acts, ongoing threats, and continued coordination, all of which
must be accepted as true at the pleading stage.
4. The Pattern Requirement Is a Jury Question
The Tenth Circuit has repeatedly held that whether a pattern of racketeering
activity exists is a question of fact for the jury (In re Epipen; Resolution
Trust Corp.). The district judge erred by resolving this issue on a motion to
dismiss, especially where the complaint plausibly alleged both relatedness
and continuity.
5. The Complaint Pleads Sufficient Predicate Acts
The complaint alleged at least two predicate acts—wire fraud and Travel Act
violations—within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1), as well as ongoing
acts in furtherance of the scheme. The Tenth Circuit has recognized that
wire fraud and Travel Act violations are valid predicate acts for RICO
purposes (18 U.S.C. § 1961; Sundance Servs., Inc. v. Roach, Civ. No. 10-110
JP/CEG (D. N.M. Sep 16, 2011)).
Exceptions and Caveats
While the Tenth Circuit has sometimes affirmed dismissals of RICO claims
where the scheme was truly short-lived, involved only one victim, and posed
no threat of continued activity (Hall v. Witteman, 569 F.Supp.2d 1208 (D.
Kan. 2008); Gotfredson v. Larsen Lp, 432 F.Supp.2d 1163 (D. Colo. 2006)),
those cases are distinguishable where, as here, the complaint alleges
ongoing threats, coordination, and acts over a substantial period. The
judge’s order did not adequately address these distinguishing features.
Conclusion
The district judge erred by misconstruing the plaintiff’s complaint, failing to
credit the detailed allegations of ongoing, related predicate acts, and
resolving factual issues about the pattern of racketeering activity that are
for the jury. Under Tenth Circuit and Supreme Court precedent, the
complaint plausibly alleged a pattern of racketeering activity—both closed-
and open-ended continuity—sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss. The
dismissal should be reversed on appeal, and the case remanded for further
proceedings.

U.S. District Court — District of New Mexico
Extract
The Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals has set forth the elements for mail and
wire fraud as follows: The elements of federal mail fraud as defined in 18
U.S.C. §1341 are (1) a scheme or artifice to defraud or obtain property by
means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, (2) an
intent to defraud, and (3) use of the mails to execute the scheme. The first
and second elements of federal mail and wire fraud are identical. The third
element of wire fraud as defined in 18 U.S.C. §1343 is the use of interstate
wire or radio communications to execute the scheme.
Summary
The Tenth Circuit requires a scheme to defraud, intent to defraud, and use
of interstate communications to execute the scheme for wire fraud. The
district judge in the Myers case dismissed the RICO claim, finding that the
alleged predicate acts did not demonstrate a pattern of racketeering activity.
However, the complaint detailed a scheme involving wire fraud and
interstate travel, which could satisfy the elements of wire fraud under 18
U.S.C. §1343. The judge may have misconstrued the continuity and
relatedness of the predicate acts, as the complaint alleged ongoing
communications and threats, which could indicate a pattern of racketeering
activity.

N.M. Mar 27, 2013)
U.S. District Court — District of New Mexico
Extract
To establish a substantive RICO violation, a plaintiff must show that there
was 'a pattern of racketeering activity.' 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). At least two
predicate acts of racketeering activity are required but not necessarily
sufficient to demonstrate a pattern. Heinrich v. Waiting Angels Adoption
Servs., Inc., 668 F.3d 393, 409 (6th Cir. 2012). 'RICO is not aimed at the
isolated offender,' so, in addition to the predicate acts, a plaintiff must show
that the racketeering predicates are related and amount to 'a threat of
continuing activity.' Tal, 453 F.3d at 1267-68 (quoting Resolution Trust Corp.
v. Stone, 998 F.2d 1534, 1544 (10th Cir. 1993)). This test has come to be
called the 'continuity plus relationship' test.
Summary
The passage explains that to establish a RICO claim, a plaintiff must
demonstrate a pattern of racketeering activity, which requires at least two
predicate acts that are related and amount to a threat of continuing activity.

=== PAGE 27 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
This is known as the "continuity plus relationship" test. The district judge
dismissed the RICO claim because the alleged scheme was short-term,
involved a single victim, and did not demonstrate a threat of ongoing
criminal activity. However, the plaintiff could argue on appeal that the
scheme's duration and the ongoing communications between defendants
suggest a threat of continued activity, thus meeting the continuity
requirement.
Reeder v. Kermit Johnson, Alphagraphics, Inc., 723 F.Supp. 1428 (D. Utah
1989)
U.S. District Court — District of Utah
Extract
To state a valid RICO claim, the plaintiffs must allege (1) conduct (2) of an
enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity. Sedima, S.P.R.L.
v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479, 496, 105 S.Ct. 3275, 3285, 87 L.Ed.2d 346
(1985). The defendants first allege that the plaintiffs have not sufficiently
pleaded facts demonstrating a pattern of racketeering activity. 'Pattern' as
used in RICO is a flexible, case-specific term, one that courts have
continually struggled with to arrive at a workable definition. The definition
of 'pattern of racketeering activity' contained in the RICO statute states that
a pattern requires at least two acts of racketeering activity. 18 U.S.C. §
1961(5). The Supreme Court has stated that this section does not mean that
two acts are always sufficient, but instead suggests that two acts are
necessary; in other words, two acts constitute the threshold requirement.
Sedima, 473 U.S. at 496 n. 14, 105 S.Ct. at 3285 n. 14. Interpreting the
legislative history of RICO in Sedima, the Supreme Court wrote that
sporadic activity does not constitute a pattern. Instead, a plaintiff relying on
RICO must demonstrate continuity plus relationship which combine to
produce a pattern of racketeering activity. Id.
Summary
Two acts are necessary but not always sufficient to establish a pattern. The
court must consider whether the acts demonstrate continuity and are
related to each other.
Agristor Leasing v. Meuli, 634 F.Supp. 1208 (D. Kan. 1986)
U.S. District Court — District of Kansas
Extract
The threshold requirement under 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5) of establishing a
'pattern of racketeering activity' is the showing of at least two predicate
acts. However, as the Supreme Court noted in Sedima, 'Proof of two acts of

racketeering activity, without more, does not establish a pattern.' 473 U.S. at
___, n. 14, 105 S.Ct. at 3285, n. 14, 87 L.Ed.2d at 358, n. 14 (quoting 116
Cong.Rec. 18,940 (1970) (statement of Sen. McClelland)). 'The target of
RICO is ... not sporadic activity, the infiltration of legitimate business
normally requires more than one `racketeering activity' and the threat of
continuing activity to be effective. It is this factor of continuity plus
relationship which combines to produce a pattern.'
Summary
To establish a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO, it is not enough
to simply show two predicate acts. There must be continuity and
relationship among the acts, indicating more than sporadic activity. The acts
must be part of a continuous scheme or have the potential for ongoing
criminal activity.
Kaplan v. Reed, 28 F.Supp.2d 1191 (D. Colo. 1998)
U.S. District Court — District of Colorado
Extract
To adequately plead a 'pattern of racketeering activity', a plaintiff must
allege facts to show that a RICO defendant committed two or more predicate
acts, that the predicate acts are related and that they amount to or pose a
threat of continued criminal activity. H.J., Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co.,
492 U.S. 229, 239, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989); Resolution Trust
Corp., 998 F.2d at 1543. The 'relationship' requirement is satisfied by
allegations the alleged predicate acts have 'the same or similar purposes,
results, participants, victims, or methods of commission, or otherwise are
interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not isolated events.'
Summary
Clear explanation of what is required to establish a pattern of racketeering
activity under RICO. It emphasizes the need for related predicate acts that
pose a threat of continued criminal activity. The district judge in the current
case found that the plaintiff failed to demonstrate a pattern of racketeering
activity because the alleged scheme was directed at a single victim, had no
potential to harm others, and was completed within a short period. The
passage from Kaplan v. Reed supports the judge's reasoning, as it highlights
the importance of continuity and the potential for ongoing criminal activity,
which were lacking in the plaintiff's allegations.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
To prove a pattern of racketeering activity for purposes of RICO, a plaintiff
must show that the defendants committed at least two predicate acts within
a ten year period that are related and amount to or pose a threat of
continued criminal activity. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5). Even assuming, for purposes
of this motion, that the Florida Fund's clean-up actions were criminal
predicate acts, plaintiffs cannot prevail because the Florida Fund's predicate
acts are neither related to the criminal acts of Robinson and Harrison, nor
do they pose a threat of continued criminal activity as required by RICO.
Summary
To establish a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO, a plaintiff must
demonstrate that the defendants committed at least two predicate acts
within a ten-year period that are related and pose a threat of continued
criminal activity. The passage emphasizes the need for relatedness and
continuity in the predicate acts to establish a RICO pattern.
Snyder v. Acord Corp., Civil Action No. 1:14-cv-01736-JLK (D. Colo. Jan 15,
2016)
U.S. District Court — District of Colorado
Extract
The elements of a civil RICO claim are (1) investment in, control of, or
conduct of (2) an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity. 18 U.S.C. § 1962(a), (b), & (c); see Tal v. Hogan, 453 F.3d 1244, 1261
(10th Cir. 2006). 'Racketeering activity' is defined in 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1)(B)
as any 'act which is indictable' under federal law and specifically includes
mail fraud and wire fraud. Tal, 453 F.3d at 1261.
Summary
Necessary elements for a civil RICO claim, which include the conduct of an
enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. The district judge
dismissed the plaintiff's claim for failing to establish a pattern of
racketeering activity, specifically the continuity requirement. The passage
from Snyder v. Acord Corp. provides insight into what constitutes a pattern
of racketeering activity, which includes related and continuous predicate
acts. The judge found that the plaintiff's allegations did not demonstrate a
pattern because the scheme was short-lived, targeted a single victim, and
did not pose a threat of continued criminal activity. The plaintiff could argue
on appeal that the judge misapplied the continuity requirement by not
considering the ongoing communications and threats as part of the pattern.
However, the judge's reasoning aligns with the precedent that a single
scheme with a narrow purpose and limited scope does not satisfy the RICO
pattern requirement.

U.S. District Court — District of Kansas
Extract
For these reasons alone, plaintiffs' RICO claims must be dismissed. Even if
plaintiffs had sufficiently alleged a predicate racketeering activity, however,
their RICO claims would fail for other reasons. For example plaintiffs do not
properly allege a 'pattern' of racketeering activity. A 'pattern' presumes
repeated activity, not merely repeated acts to carry out the same scheme.
Meyer, 647 F.Supp. at 974-75; see also Northern Trust Bank/O'Hare v. Inryco
Inc., 615 F.Supp. 828, 831 (N.D.Ill.1985). Plaintiffs allege only repeated acts
to carry out one scheme — ACFG's deprivation of plaintiffs' civil and
property rights—rather than repeated activity. The Supreme Court has held
that to establish a 'pattern' under RICO, a plaintiff must show that the
predicates themselves amount to or otherwise constitute a threat of
continuing racketeering activity.
Summary
To establish a "pattern" under RICO, a plaintiff must show that the predicate
acts themselves amount to or otherwise constitute a threat of continuing
racketeering activity. The passage emphasizes that a pattern requires
repeated activity, not merely repeated acts to carry out the same scheme.
This is relevant to the question of whether the district judge erred in
dismissing the RICO claim for lack of a pattern of racketeering activity.

U.S. District Court — District of Colorado
Extract
RICO allows private parties to bring civil actions for treble damages for
violations of sections 1962(c) and (d). See 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c). 'To state a

In re Epipen, 336 F.Supp.3d 1256 (D. Kan. 2018)
U.S. District Court — District of Kansas
Extract
Defendants next argue that the Class Complaint never alleges a 'pattern of
racketeering activity,' as 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) requires. The RICO statute
defines a 'pattern' of racketeering as 'at least two acts of racketeering
activity, ... which occurred within ten years' of one another. 18 U.S.C. §
1961(5). But 'proof of two or more predicate acts [is] not sufficient to prove
a pattern unless there is a relationship between the predicate acts and a
threat of continuing activity.' ... See George v. Urban Settlement Servs., 833
F.3d 1242 1254–57 (10th Cir. 2016) (holding that plaintiffs adequately
alleged a pattern of racketeering activity because their complaint asserted
defendants committed several acts of mail and wire fraud while executing a
fraudulent scheme to deny Home Affordable Modification Program loans to
eligible borrowers); see also Resolution Tr. Corp., 998 F.2d at 1543 (holding
that sufficient evidence of a pattern of racketeering activity existed to
support the jury's finding because the 'jury could find that the wire fraud
activity was associated with on-going acts of fraud'). Also, our Circuit
recognizes that '[w]hether a pattern [of racketeering activity] exists is a
question of fact for the jury to determine.' Resolution Tr. Corp., 998 F.2d at
1543; see also Tal, 453 F.3d at 1268 (holding that 'because the extensiveness
of the threat is a question of fact' the court would 'assume for the purposes
of this opinion that the predicate acts alleged ... establish a pattern of
racketeering activity').
Summary
The Tenth Circuit recognizes that whether a pattern of racketeering activity
exists is a question of fact for the jury to determine. The passage also
highlights that a pattern requires a relationship between predicate acts and
a threat of continuing activity. The district judge in the current case
dismissed the RICO claim, finding that the plaintiff failed to demonstrate a
pattern of racketeering activity. However, the Tenth Circuit precedent
suggests that the determination of a pattern is a factual question for the
jury, not a legal question for the court to decide at the motion to dismiss
stage.

Suddath v. Oklahome Homebuilders, LLC, CIV-24-745-SLP (W.D. Okla. Nov
08, 2024)
U.S. District Court — Western District of Oklahoma
Extract
RICO provides a civil cause of action for treble damages to anyone injured
“by reason of” certain racketeering activity. 18 U.S.C. §§ 1964(c), 1962. “To
plead a valid RICO claim, a plaintiff must plausibly allege that a defendant
(1) conducted the affairs (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of
racketeering activity.” Johnson v. Heath, 56 F.4th 851, 858 (10th Cir. 2022)
(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Defendants challenge, inter
alia, the sufficiency of Plaintiffs' allegations with respect to the third element
- a “pattern” of racketeering activity. “A ‘pattern' requires at least two
predicate acts.” Bixler v. Foster, 596 F.3d 751, 761 (10th Cir. 2010) (citing 18
U.S.C. § 1961(5)). And those predicate acts themselves must amount to or
otherwise constitute a threat of continuing racketeering activity. Id. This
continuity requirement expresses congressional intent that “RICO reach
activities that amount to or threaten long-term criminal activity.” Id. (citing
H.J., Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tele. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 243 n. 4 (1989)).
Summary
To establish a RICO claim, a plaintiff must demonstrate a pattern of
racketeering activity, which requires at least two predicate acts that amount
to or threaten long-term criminal activity. The continuity requirement is
crucial, and the acts must either show closed-ended continuity (a series of
related predicates over a substantial period) or open-ended continuity (a
threat of future criminal conduct). The district judge found that the
plaintiff's allegations did not meet these requirements, as the scheme was
directed at a single victim with no potential to extend to others, and the
alleged acts did not demonstrate a threat of continued criminal activity.
Nation v. Shah, 4:19-cv-00588-JDR-JFJ (N.D. Okla. Oct 30, 2024)
U.S. District Court — Northern District of Oklahoma
Extract
The Court, begins-and ends-by considering whether Plaintiffs have satisfied
their burden of alleging facts that, if true, would establish a “pattern” of
racketeering activity, which is an essential element of each of their RICO
claims. See Tal, 453 F.3d at 1269 (recognizing that, to survive a motion to
dismiss, a civil RICO claim must allege, among other things, a pattern of
racketeering activity). While “[determining what constitutes a RICO pattern
is no easy task,” it is clear that, at a minimum, a RICO pattern requires
multiple “racketeering predicates” that “relate to each other and amount to
a threat of continued racketeering activity.” ... More difficult to establish-and
more problematic for Plaintiffs-is the requirement that the predicate acts

=== PAGE 33 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
have sufficient “continuity” to constitute a RICO “pattern.” See Bixler v.
Foster, 596 F.3d 751, 761 (10th Cir. 2010) (indicating that the continuity
requirement “is more difficult to meet” (citation and quotation marks
omitted)). For RICO purposes, continuity comes in one of two forms: Closed-
ended continuity can be established by alleging a “closed period of repeated
racketeering conduct.” Johnson, 56 F.4th at 859-60 (citing H.J. Inc., 492 U.S.
at 241-43). Open-ended continuity can be established by racketeering acts
that “involved implicit or explicit threats of repetition,” “formed the
operations of an association that exists for criminal purposes,” or were part
of the defendants' “regular way of conducting a legitimate enterprise.”
Summary
Requirements for establishing a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO,
emphasizing the need for relatedness and continuity. It explains that
continuity can be either closed-ended or open-ended, with closed-ended
continuity requiring a closed period of repeated racketeering conduct, and
open-ended continuity involving threats of repetition or being part of a
regular way of conducting business. The passage highlights that establishing
continuity is more challenging than establishing relatedness.
Thompson v. Wyoming Alaska, Inc., 652 F.Supp. 1222 (D. Utah 1987)
U.S. District Court — District of Utah
Extract
In Torwest DBC, Inc. v. Dick, 810 F.2d 925 (10th Cir.1986), the Tenth Circuit
stressed in a single scheme case that the 'continuity' requirement of pattern
requires demonstration of 'facts from which at least a threat of ongoing
illegal conduct may be inferred,' and that the single scheme would have to
involve 'continuous behavior.' In this case pattern fails because the acts
complained of were not ongoing and could not be said to constitute the
regular way in which defendants conduct business.
Summary
For a RICO claim to succeed, particularly in the Tenth Circuit, there must be
a demonstration of continuity, which requires showing a threat of ongoing
illegal conduct or continuous behavior. The district judge in the current case
found that the alleged scheme achieved its primary objective within a short
period and did not demonstrate a threat of ongoing illegal conduct or
continuous behavior. This aligns with the Tenth Circuit's requirement for
continuity in RICO cases.
Skurkey v. Daniel
U.S. District Court — Western District of Oklahoma

=== PAGE 34 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
Defendants next argue the Complaint fails to allege a “pattern of
racketeering.” A “pattern” requires at least two predicate acts. 18 U.S.C. §
1961(5). Predicate acts must be violations of certain statutes, 18 U.S.C. §
1961(1), here alleged to be federal mail fraud and wire fraud statutes.
Additionally, a Plaintiff must allege facts from which the Court can conclude
the existence of a pattern, that is that the “predicates themselves amount to,
or that they otherwise constitute a threat of, continuing racketeering
activity.” H.J., Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co., 492 U.S. 229, 240
(1989) (emphasis original). The Supreme Court has explained that there are
two elements to finding a pattern for RICO purposes: “continuity plus
relationship.”
Summary
To establish a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO, a plaintiff must
demonstrate both continuity and relationship among predicate acts. The
passage highlights that a single scheme directed at one individual with no
potential to extend to others typically does not satisfy the RICO requirement
of a pattern of continuity. This is relevant to the district judge's decision, as
the judge found that the plaintiff's allegations did not meet the continuity
requirement, given the single scheme and single victim involved.
UMB Bank v. Monson, 21-CV-2504-EFM (D. Kan. Jun 04, 2025)
U.S. District Court — District of Kansas
Extract
To state a 'pattern' of racketeering activity, the plaintiff must allege 'at least
two acts of racketeering activity... which occurred within ten years.'
Moreover, 'a RICO pattern requires that the racketeering predicates relate
to each other and amount to a threat of continued racketeering activity. No
pattern exists without this ‘continuity plus relationship.’' As to the
relationship requirement, predicate acts satisfy this element when they
make up one common scheme. Racketeering predicates relate to each other
if they 'have the same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or
methods of commission, or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing
characteristics and are not isolated events.' 'The relationship test is not a
cumbersome one for a RICO plaintiff.'
Summary
To establish a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO, a plaintiff must
demonstrate that the predicate acts are related and amount to a threat of
continued racketeering activity. The relationship requirement is not difficult
to meet, as it only requires that the acts make up one common scheme and
share similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods. The

continuity requirement, however, is more stringent and requires either a
closed-ended or open-ended continuity, which involves repeated acts over a
substantial period or a threat of future repetition.

U.S. District Court — District of Colorado
Extract
In order to make out a pattern under RICO, the predicate acts must
somehow be ordered or arranged, bearing some relationship to each other,
and implicate the threat of continuing activity. H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell
Telephone Co., 492 U.S. 229, 238-239, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 2900-2901, 106 L.Ed.
2d 195 (1989). 'Continuity' is both a closed- and openended concept,
referring either to a closed period of repeated conduct, or to past conduct
that by its nature projects into the future with the threat of repetition. Id. at
241, 109 S.Ct. at 2901. But predicate acts 'extending over a few weeks or
months and threatening no future criminal conduct do not satisfy this
requirement: Congress was concerned in RICO with long-term criminal
conduct.' Id. at 242, 109 S.Ct. at 2902.
Summary
Predicate acts extending over a short period without a threat of future
criminal conduct do not satisfy the continuity requirement. This is relevant
to the district judge's decision, as the judge found that the alleged scheme
achieved its primary objective within a short period and did not demonstrate
a threat of continued criminal activity.

In H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106
L.Ed.2d 195 (1989), the Supreme Court reiterated the well-established
concept that racketeering acts form a 'pattern' in RICO where they exhibit
'continuity plus relationship.' Id. at 239, 109 S.Ct. at 2900. The 'relationship'
requirement is satisfied when the racketeering acts have 'the same or
similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of commission, or
otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not
isolated events.' Id. at 240, 109 S.Ct. at 2901 (citing Sedima, 473 U.S. at 496
n. 14, 105 S.Ct. at 3285 n. 14). With respect to the 'continuity' requirement,
the Supreme Court stated that the predicate acts must amount to, or pose a
threat of, continuing racketeering activity. Id. According to the Supreme
Court, continuity 'is both a closed- and open-ended concept, referring to a

=== PAGE 36 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
closed period of repeated conduct, or to past conduct that by its nature
projects into the future with a threat of repetition.' Id. A RICO plaintiff 'may
demonstrate continuity over a closed period by proving a series of related
predicates extending over a substantial period of time.' Id. Predicates
extending over merely a few weeks or months, on the other hand, may
satisfy the continuity element if there is a threat of repetition in the future.
This latter concept of continuity, which occurs over an 'open period,' is
established by showing that the predicate acts are a 'regular way of
conducting the enterprise's ongoing business.'
Summary
Continuity can be either closed-ended or open-ended, and it provides
criteria for establishing each type. This is relevant to the question of
whether the district judge erred in dismissing the RICO claim for lack of a
pattern of racketeering activity.
Gotfredson v. Larsen Lp, 432 F.Supp.2d 1163 (D. Colo. 2006)

Extract
Here, Plaintiffs vaguely contend that their complaint sufficiently alleges both
a closed and open-ended scheme. (Pls.' Resp. to Def. M. Larsen's Br. at 8-9.)
Thus, I evaluate both concepts. 'A party alleging a RICO violation may
demonstrate continuity over a closed period by proving a series of related
predicates extending over a substantial period of time. Predicate acts
extending over a few weeks or months and threatening no future criminal

2893. The facts, as alleged by Plaintiffs, do not satisfy the continuity
requirement. Plaintiffs have not sufficiently pled a threat of 'future criminal
conduct.' See id. Plaintiffs essentially allege a closed-ended series of
predicate acts. Specifically, viewing the complaint in a light most favorable
to Plaintiffs, Plaintiffs' complaint asserts a closed-ended series of predicate
acts constituting a single scheme—false or fraudulent claims and a sham
arbitration—to accomplish a discrete goal—garner a large sum of money
from Plaintiffs—directed at a finite group of individuals—Plaintiff Gotfredson
and his company, Plaintiff Trim Work Specialty, Inc—'`with no potential to
extend to other persons or entities.'
Summary
To establish a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO, a plaintiff must
demonstrate continuity, which can be either closed-ended or open-ended.
Closed-ended continuity requires a series of related predicate acts extending
over a substantial period of time, and acts extending over a few weeks or
months without a threat of future criminal conduct do not satisfy this
requirement. The passage also highlights that a single scheme directed at a

finite group of individuals with no potential to extend to others does not
establish continuity.

Alternatively, even if Plaintiff can demonstrate proximate cause, the Court
concludes that Plaintiff has failed to establish the necessary pattern of
racketeering activity. 'To prove a 'pattern of racketeering activity' a plaintiff
or prosecutor must show both 'relationship' and 'continuity'—that the
racketeering predicates are related, and that they either constitute or
threaten long-term criminal activity.' H.J. Inc. v. Nw. Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S.
229, 230 (1989). As the Supreme Court explained, Relationship and
continuity are two distinct requirements, though their proof will often
overlap. RICO's notion of relationship is [that] 'criminal conduct forms a
pattern if it embraces criminal acts that have the same or similar purposes,
results, participants, victims, or methods of commission, or otherwise are
interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not isolated events.' 18

Summary
To establish a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO, a plaintiff must
demonstrate both a relationship and continuity among the predicate acts.
The relationship requirement involves showing that the acts have similar
purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods, while continuity
involves demonstrating that the acts either constitute or threaten long-term
criminal activity. The passage suggests that the plaintiff in the Tso case
failed to establish these elements, which is similar to the issue in the current
case where the judge found that the plaintiff's allegations did not
demonstrate a pattern of racketeering activity.

U.S. District Court — District of Colorado
Extract
Plaintiffs’ description of a single fraud scheme affects claims’ plausibility in
another respect: whether the alleged fraudulent acts accomplished a
discrete goal (which RICO would not cover) or whether they constitute a
pattern of racketeering activity (which RICO does concern). Erikson v.
Farmers Group, Inc., 151 F. App'x 672 (10th Cir. 2005). To establish the
'pattern' element, a plaintiff not only must show multiple predicate acts, 'but
also that the predicates themselves amount to, or that they otherwise

reflects Congress’ concern over long-term criminal activity. Boone v.
Carlsbad Bancorporation, Inc., 972 F.2d 1545, 1556 (10th Cir. 1992).
Summary
To establish a RICO claim, a plaintiff must demonstrate a pattern of
racketeering activity, which requires showing both relatedness and
continuity. The passage emphasizes that a single scheme with a discrete
goal, directed at a finite group of individuals, does not satisfy the continuity
requirement for a RICO pattern. This is relevant to the district judge's
decision, as the judge found that the plaintiff's allegations did not
demonstrate a pattern of racketeering activity due to the lack of continuity.

Summary
For civil RICO liability, a person does not need to be formally convicted of a
predicate act. However, the predicate acts must extend over a substantial
period of time and affect more than a single victim, aiming to accomplish
more than one discrete goal. This is relevant to the plaintiff's case because
the district judge dismissed the case on the grounds that the alleged scheme
was directed at a single victim and achieved its primary objective within a
short period, which the judge found insufficient to establish a pattern of
racketeering activity.

U.S. District Court — District of Utah

=== PAGE 39 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
A private civil action under RICO is grounded upon the premise that a party
has twice engaged in 'racketeering activity'. The Act defines 'racketeering
activity' as behavior 'indictable' under specified provisions of the United
States Code. Before a court can assess the merit of a plaintiff's treble
damages claim it must determine whether there is probable cause to believe
the named defendant committed the alleged predicate crimes. That
determination is possible only if the factual basis of those 'acts of
racketeering' is set out with particularity. Thus, a factual statement similar
to a bill of particulars is needed in pleadings that allege a violation of the
RICO treble damages provision.
Summary
The passage highlights the necessity for a plaintiff in a RICO case to set out
the factual basis of alleged racketeering activities with particularity. This is
crucial for the court to determine whether there is probable cause to believe
the defendant committed the alleged predicate crimes. The district judge
dismissed the plaintiff's RICO claim, likely due to a perceived lack of
continuity and relatedness in the alleged racketeering activities. However,
the plaintiff's complaint did allege a series of related acts over an extended
period, which could potentially satisfy the continuity requirement if the
factual basis is sufficiently particularized. The 10th Circuit precedent
emphasizes the need for detailed factual allegations, which the plaintiff may
argue were present or could be amended to meet this standard.
Hall v. Witteman, 569 F.Supp.2d 1208 (D. Kan. 2008)
U.S. District Court — District of Kansas
Extract
In a RICO case, the complaint must allege continuity. Duran v. Carris, 238 F.
3d 1268, 1271 (10th Cir.2001). At best, what plaintiff alleges is a closed-
ended series of predicate acts constituting a single scheme to accomplish a
discrete goal [publication of the Responsive Advertisement in lieu of
Plaintiff's Advertisement] directed at only one individual [the plaintiff] with
no potential to extend to other persons or entities. See Boone v. Carlsbad
Bancorporation, Inc., 972 F.2d 1545, 1556 (10th Cir.1992). Therefore, the
allegations of the Complaint do not show sufficient continuity to sustain
plaintiff's RICO claim.
Summary
The passage from Hall v. Witteman emphasizes the necessity of
demonstrating continuity in RICO claims, either through a closed-ended
series of related acts over a substantial period or through open-ended
continuity that suggests a threat of ongoing criminal activity. The district

=== PAGE 40 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
judge in the current case found that the plaintiff's allegations did not
demonstrate continuity, as the scheme was directed at a single individual,
achieved its primary objective within a short period, and did not pose a
threat of continued criminal activity. This aligns with the reasoning in Hall v.
Witteman, where a single scheme directed at one individual with no
potential to extend to others was insufficient to establish continuity.

Summary
Wire fraud involves a scheme to defraud using interstate wire
communications. This is relevant to the plaintiff's claim that the defendants
engaged in wire fraud as part of a RICO violation. The district judge
dismissed the RICO claim for lack of a pattern of racketeering activity, which
requires related and continuous predicate acts. The plaintiff alleged wire
fraud and a violation of the Travel Act as predicate acts. The judge found
that the alleged scheme was a single, short-lived effort with a discrete goal,
which does not satisfy the continuity requirement for a RICO pattern.
However, the plaintiff argues that the scheme extended over 18 months and
involved ongoing communications and threats, which could suggest
continuity.

The venue for a RICO action can be in any district where the defendant
resides, is found, has an agent, or transacts affairs. This is relevant to the
question of whether the district judge erred in dismissing the case for
improper venue, as the passage suggests that the venue could be proper if
any of these conditions are met.

Summary
The RICO Act prohibits individuals from engaging in a pattern of
racketeering activity to acquire or maintain control over an enterprise
affecting interstate commerce. This is relevant to the plaintiff's allegations
that the defendants engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity through
wire fraud and violations of the Travel Act. The district judge's dismissal of

Summary
The statute provides a private right of action for individuals injured in their
business or property by a RICO violation. It allows for the recovery of treble
damages and costs, which is relevant to the plaintiff's claim for damages due
to the alleged RICO violations by the defendants. The district judge's

Summary
The Travel Act criminalizes interstate travel or the use of interstate facilities
with the intent to promote or facilitate unlawful activity. This is relevant to
the plaintiff's claim that Defendant Myers' trip to Oklahoma violated the

applicability of the Travel Act to the alleged scheme, which involved
interstate travel to prepare fraudulent documents.

Extract
Although 'racketeering activity' is an easily defined concept, a 'pattern of
racketeering activity' has proven more complicated. The statutory text
states that a ''pattern of racketeering activity' requires at least two acts of
racketeering activity, one of which occurred after the effective date of this
chapter and the last of which occurred within ten years (excluding any
period of imprisonment) after the commission of a prior act of racketeering
activity.' The Supreme Court's biggest contribution to the 'pattern' element
came in H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co., which involved a RICO
class action by telephone customers alleging that their telephone company
rigged rates by bribing utilities commissioners. In its holding, the Court
determined that [section] 1961(5)'s 'pattern of racketeering activity'
required more than simply the commission of two predicate acts; a pattern
is not merely a checklist of racketeering acts that must be proved by the
government. At the outset, the Court adopted an idea from past precedent
that although 'two acts are necessary [for a pattern], they may not be
sufficient.' The Court also noted that although something more than two
predicate acts was required, the pattern requirement was a 'flexible'
concept that could be proven in multiple ways. Looking at the legislative
history, the Court held that 'to prove a pattern of racketeering activity a
plaintiff or prosecutor must show that the racketeering predicates are
related, and that they amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal
activity.' This introduced two new requirements for a pattern of racketeering
activity: a relationship component and a continuity component.
Summary
The Supreme Court in H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co. clarified
that a "pattern of racketeering activity" under RICO requires more than just
two predicate acts. The acts must be related and pose a threat of continued
criminal activity, introducing the relationship and continuity components.
This means that even if two predicate acts are present, they must be part of
a broader scheme that shows continuity and relatedness.

Summary
To establish a "pattern of racketeering activity" under RICO, both
relationship and continuity must be demonstrated. The relationship prong
requires that the acts have similar purposes, results, participants, victims,
or methods. Continuity can be shown through repeated conduct over a
closed period or a threat of continued activity. The district judge found that
the plaintiff failed to demonstrate a pattern of racketeering activity because
the alleged scheme was completed within a short period, involved a single
victim, and did not pose a threat of continued criminal activity. However, the
judge may have erred by not fully considering whether the alleged acts were
sufficiently related and whether the continuity requirement could be met
through the ongoing communications and threats, which could suggest a
threat of continued activity.

The Court rejected a narrow reading of the phrase 'pattern of racketeering

or that the predicate acts be 'indicative of an organized crime perpetrator.'

that requires a 'plaintiff or prosecutor [merely to] prove [a] continuity of
racketeering activity, or its threat, simpliciter.'

relationship and continuity of predicate acts must be demonstrated. The
relationship prong requires a connection between the defendant's criminal
acts, while continuity can be shown through repeated conduct over a closed
period or an open-ended threat of continued activity. The district judge in
the case at hand found that the plaintiff failed to demonstrate a pattern of
racketeering activity, particularly the continuity aspect, as the alleged
scheme was short-lived and directed at a single victim. The judge's decision
aligns with the requirement that a RICO pattern must involve more than
isolated or short-term conduct.

Extract
Congress has mandated that RICO 'be liberally construed to effectuate its
remedial purposes.'(23) In the past, some courts have read the statute as
narrowly limited to 'organized criminals.' These courts discouraged RICO
actions arising out of 'garden variety' commercial disputes or fraud.(24)
However, in Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co.(25) the Supreme Court attempted
to halt this trend by concluding that RICO applies to legitimate businesses.
(26)... The Supreme Court made a second attempt to clarify the 'pattern'
concept. In H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co.,(56) the Court
confronted a civil RICO action brought against Northwestern Bell for
allegedly bribing public utility commission officials.(57)... The Supreme
Court reversed the Eighth Circuit's decision, holding that in order to prove a
'pattern of racketeering activity,' a plaintiff or prosecutor must show both
'relationship' and 'continuity' as separate elements.(59) However, the Court

RICO should be liberally construed to effectuate its remedial purposes, and
the Supreme Court has clarified that RICO applies to legitimate businesses,
not just organized criminals. The Supreme Court has also clarified the
"pattern" requirement, emphasizing the need for both "relationship" and
"continuity" as separate elements, but recognizing that these factors often

Summary
For a RICO claim to demonstrate a pattern of racketeering activity, there
must be either closed-ended continuity (a series of related predicates over a
substantial period) or open-ended continuity (a threat of continued
racketeering activity). The district judge found that the plaintiff's allegations
did not meet these requirements, as the scheme was completed within a
short period and did not threaten future criminal conduct. However, the
passage suggests that even a small number of related predicates occurring
close together in time can establish open-ended continuity if they include a
specific threat of repetition extending indefinitely into the future.

community... In addition to criminal actions, RICO permits private plaintiffs
and the government to seek redress in a civil action... Under section 1964,
the Attorney General or 'any person injured in his business or property by
reason of a violation of section 1962' may bring a civil action in either state
or federal court for redress... The two most controversial elements of RICO
continue to be the 'pattern' and 'enterprise' requirements... A 'pattern of
racketeering activity' requires two or more predicate acts of 'racketeering
activity.'
Summary
The RICO statute is designed to combat organized crime by allowing both
criminal and civil actions against those engaged in a pattern of racketeering
activity. The statute requires at least two predicate acts to establish a
pattern, and these acts must be related and continuous. The passage
highlights the importance of the "pattern" and "enterprise" requirements,
which are often the most challenging elements to prove in a RICO case.
'Plausible' Deniability
Litigation - American Bar Association - Michael J. Miarmi -
2021-01-01
Extract
The Second Circuit vacated the judgment, holding that even if the initial
complaint did not afford a plausible inference of conspiracy, the proposed
amended complaint did. In so ruling, the court of appeals articulated
important principles guiding the plausibility analysis. The Second Circuit
instructed that '[b]ecause plausibility is a standard lower than probability, a
given set of actions may well be subject to diverging interpretations, each of
which is plausible.' 680 F.3d 162, 184 (2d Cir. 2012). Further, '[t]he choice
between two plausible inferences that may be drawn from factual
allegations is not a choice to be made by the court on a Rule 12(b)(6)
motion,' and a court 'may not properly dismiss a complaint that states a
plausible version of the events merely because the court finds a different
version more plausible.' Id. at 185.

Summary
The plausibility standard is lower than probability, and courts should not
dismiss a complaint simply because they find a different version of events
more plausible. The choice between plausible inferences is not for the court
to make at the motion to dismiss stage. This principle suggests that the
district judge may have erred by dismissing the complaint based on a
preference for a more plausible version of events rather than considering
whether the plaintiff's version was plausible.
Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy
The Brief - American Bar Association - 2024-01-01
Extract
A scheme to achieve a single discrete objective does not in and of itself
create a threat of ongoing activity, even when that goal is pursued by
multiple illegal acts, because the scheme ends when the purpose is
accomplished.
Summary
The Tenth Circuit has held that a single scheme aimed at achieving a
discrete objective does not satisfy the continuity requirement for a RICO
pattern. The district judge in the case at hand found that the plaintiff's
allegations did not demonstrate a pattern of racketeering activity because
the scheme was directed at a single victim, had a single objective, and was
completed within a short time frame. This aligns with the Tenth Circuit's
interpretation that such a scheme does not pose a threat of ongoing activity,
which is necessary to establish a RICO pattern.

Extract
In contrast, Twombly required plaintiffs to provide specific factual
allegations of any civil conspiracy that, in addition, made out a plausible
claim. (269) Civil complaints alleging conspiracy have been routinely
dismissed for being too conclusory. For example, in Xtreme Power Plan Trust
v. Schindler, (270) the court stated, 'circumstances of conspiracy [must] be
plead[ed] with specificity.' (271) Similarly, the court in Atlantic International
Movers, LLC v. Ocean World Lines, Inc., (272) stated that '[p]laintiff's
complaint largely fails to attribute specific actions to any of the parties and

=== PAGE 51 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
makes no specific allegations supporting the existence of an agreement
between them.' (273)
Summary
The Twombly and Iqbal decisions require plaintiffs in civil cases to provide
specific factual allegations to make out a plausible claim. This heightened
pleading standard means that complaints that are too conclusory or fail to
attribute specific actions to parties are likely to be dismissed. The district
judge's decision to dismiss the plaintiff's complaint may have been
influenced by these standards, as the judge found that the plaintiff failed to
adequately allege a pattern of racketeering activity.
RICO: A Primer
Extract
Mail and wire fraud are the most common predicate acts... The racketeering
acts need not be similar or directly related to each other; rather, it is
sufficient that the racketeering acts are related in some way to the affairs of
the charged enterprise, including, for example, that: the racketeering acts
furthered the goals of or benefitted the enterprise, the enterprise or the
defendant's role in the enterprise enabled the defendant to commit, or
facilitated the commission of, the racketeering acts, the racketeering acts
were committed at the behest of, or on behalf of, the enterprise, or the
racketeering acts had the same or similar purposes, results, participants,
victims or methods of commission.
Summary
For a RICO claim, the racketeering acts do not need to be directly related to
each other but must be related to the affairs of the enterprise. The passage
suggests that the acts should further the goals of the enterprise or be
committed on behalf of the enterprise. This is relevant to the plaintiff's claim
that the acts of wire fraud and violation of the Travel Act were part of a
scheme to defraud him and manipulate judicial proceedings, which could be
seen as related to the affairs of the alleged enterprise.

Arsenal

Second, to prove most types of RICO claims, the plaintiff must plead that the
defendant committed some qualifying criminal action, the most common of
which is mail, wire or securities fraud. Business deals gone sour do not
count. Rather, the plaintiff must be able to prove the elements of the
asserted crime, and often an intent to defraud. If there is nothing criminal in

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
nature about the complained-of conduct, RICO should not apply. It is an
abuse of the RICO statute to attempt to shoehorn ordinary business or
contractual disputes into a civil RICO claim. Third, the plaintiff must plead a
pattern of racketeering activity for most RICO claims. If the alleged conduct
occurred once or twice, or was not continuous, it cannot form a pattern of
conduct sufficient to support a RICO claim. And oftentimes, because there is
a fraud component, those instances must be particularly identified in the
plaintiff's pleading—a barrier that can prove difficult to accomplish.
Summary
For a RICO claim to be valid, the plaintiff must demonstrate a pattern of
racketeering activity, which requires more than isolated or sporadic acts.
The conduct must be criminal in nature, and the plaintiff must prove the
elements of the asserted crime, such as wire fraud. The passage emphasizes
the difficulty of meeting these requirements and warns against using RICO
for ordinary business disputes.
Defending Civil RICO Claims: A Defense Plan Should Be In Every Business's
Arsenal
Extract
First, to bring a civil RICO claim, a plaintiff must demonstrate that their
business or property was injured as a result of a RICO violation. In other
words, there must be some sort of concrete financial loss directly flowing
from the purported violation to support a RICO claim. Thus, if a plaintiff
does not have a concrete financial loss, then the RICO claim must be
dismissed. Asserting personal injuries, such as emotion distress, is
insufficient. Second, to prove most types of RICO claims, the plaintiff must
plead that the defendant committed some qualifying criminal action, the
most common of which is mail, wire or securities fraud. Business deals gone
sour do not count. Rather, the plaintiff must be able to prove the elements of
the asserted crime, and often an intent to defraud. If there is nothing
criminal in nature about the complained-of conduct, RICO should not apply.

Summary
Requirements for a civil RICO claim, emphasizing the need for a concrete
financial loss, a qualifying criminal action, and a pattern of racketeering
activity. The district judge dismissed the case because the plaintiff failed to

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
demonstrate a pattern of racketeering activity, which is consistent with the
requirements outlined in the passage. The judge found that the alleged
scheme was a single, narrow purpose directed at one individual, which does
not satisfy the continuity requirement for a RICO claim.
RICO: A Primer
Extract
The racketeering acts need not be similar or directly related to each other;
rather, it is sufficient that the racketeering acts are related in some way to
the affairs of the charged enterprise, including, for example, that: the
racketeering acts furthered the goals of or benefitted the enterprise, the
enterprise or the defendant's role in the enterprise enabled the defendant to
commit, or facilitated the commission of, the racketeering acts, the
racketeering acts were committed at the behest of, or on behalf of, the
enterprise, or the racketeering acts had the same or similar purposes,
results, participants, victims or methods of commission. The continuity
requirement is likewise satisfied where the predicates are a regular way of
conducting the defendant's ongoing legitimate business (in the sense that it
is not a business that exists for criminal purposes), or of conducting or
participating in an ongoing and legitimate RICO 'enterprise.' A plaintiff may
demonstrate a pattern by establishment that the predicate acts pose a threat
of continued criminal activity, which is generally demonstrated by showing
either: * Closed-ended continuity. Proving 'a series of related predicate acts
extending over a substantial period of time.' * Open-ended continuity. A
threat of 'continuing criminal activity extending indefinitely into the future,'
in light of the nature of the enterprise and predicate acts alleged.
Summary
The passage provides insight into the requirements for establishing a
pattern of racketeering activity under RICO. It clarifies that the racketeering
acts do not need to be similar or directly related but must be related to the
affairs of the charged enterprise. The passage also explains the continuity
requirement, which can be satisfied by either closed-ended continuity (a
series of related predicate acts over a substantial period) or open-ended
continuity (a threat of continuing criminal activity). This information is
relevant to the question of whether the district judge misconstrued the
plaintiff's complaint regarding the pattern of racketeering activity.
SCOTUS Resolves Circuit Split On How To Assess Domestic Injury Under
RICO
Extract
The Supreme Court rejected the Seventh Circuit's approach and sided with
the Ninth Circuit. Yegiazaryan, slip op. at 7-8. The Court held that

=== PAGE 54 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
'determining whether a plaintiff has alleged a domestic injury [for purposes
of RICO] is a context-specific inquiry that turns largely on the particular
facts alleged in a complaint.' Id. at 8. This means that district courts must
consider the 'circumstances surrounding the alleged injury to assess
whether it arose in the United States.' Id. 'If those circumstances sufficiently
ground the injury in the United States, such that it is clear the injury arose
domestically, then the plaintiff has alleged a domestic injury.' Id. at 9-10.
Notably, because the analysis is contextual and 'the range of predicate acts'
for RICO is quite expansive, 'no set of factors can capture the relevant
considerations for all cases.' Id. at 10.
Summary
The Supreme Court emphasizes a context-specific inquiry to determine
whether a plaintiff has alleged a domestic injury under RICO. This requires
district courts to consider the specific circumstances surrounding the
alleged injury to assess whether it arose in the United States. The analysis is
contextual, and no set of factors can capture the relevant considerations for
all cases, indicating that each case must be evaluated on its own merits.
Complex AKS/Stark Complaint Survives Rule 9(b) Particularity Challenge ' A
Guide For FCA Complaints
Extract
Generally, a complaint will survive a motion to dismiss if it states a plausible
claim and allows a court to reasonably infer the defendant's liability for the
allegations made therein. Merely reciting the elements of a cause of action
followed by a general statement of liability is insufficient. Further, where a
complaint alleges claims under the FCA, Rule 9(b) of the Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure ('Rule 9(b)') applies and requires that the complaining party
'state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake.'
Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b). As noted by the court, Rule 9(b) imposes a more exacting
pleading standard and requires the complaint to allege facts as to time,
place, and substance of the defendant's alleged fraud, specifically the details
of the defendant's allegedly fraudulent acts, when they occurred, and who
engaged in them.
Summary
For a complaint to survive a motion to dismiss, it must state a plausible
claim and allow the court to reasonably infer the defendant's liability. In
cases involving fraud, Rule 9(b) requires that the complaint state with
particularity the circumstances constituting fraud, including the time, place,
and substance of the alleged fraudulent acts. This standard is more exacting
than the general pleading standard and requires specific details about the
alleged fraud.
