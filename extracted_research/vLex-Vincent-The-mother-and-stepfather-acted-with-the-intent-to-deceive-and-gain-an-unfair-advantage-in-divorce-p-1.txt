Question
The mother and stepfather acted with the intent to deceive and gain an
unfair advantage in divorce proceedings, as evidenced by the use of
concealed financial transactions, preparation of pleadings in another state,
and coordination with the grandparents to serve an eviction notice.
Predicate acts such as wire fraud require proof of intent to defraud, which
can be inferred from deceptive actions and the use of interstate
communications. (18 U.S.C. § 1343). The use of concealed financial
transactions and interstate communications to further the scheme
demonstrates the requisite intent to defraud, supporting the claim of wire
fraud as a predicate act under RICO.
Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
The intent to defraud required for wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343 can be
inferred from the mother and stepfather's deceptive actions including
concealed financial transactions, preparation of pleadings in another state,
and coordination with grandparents on an eviction notice, establishing wire
fraud as a predicate act under RICO. These actions, combined with the use
of interstate wire communications, satisfy the elements of wire fraud by
demonstrating a scheme to defraud with specific intent to deceive and gain
unfair advantage in divorce proceedings.
Summary
The actions described—concealed financial transactions, preparation of
pleadings in another state, and coordination with grandparents to serve an
eviction notice—can support a finding of intent to defraud required for wire
fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343, thereby establishing wire fraud as a predicate
act under RICO. The law clearly states that wire fraud requires proof of: (1)
a scheme to defraud, (2) intent to defraud, and (3) use of interstate wire
communications in furtherance of that scheme. The mother and stepfather's
deceptive actions, particularly when coupled with interstate
communications, demonstrate the requisite specific intent to deceive and
cheat necessary to satisfy the intent element of wire fraud.
Courts have consistently held that intent to defraud can be inferred from the
totality of circumstances, including attempts to conceal activities or making
misrepresentations. The coordination between parties across state lines and
the concealment of financial transactions provide substantial evidence of
intent to deceive. Given that wire fraud is explicitly listed as a predicate act
under RICO's definition of "racketeering activity" in 18 U.S.C. § 1961, and
that a "pattern of racketeering activity" requires at least two such acts, the
described behavior could form the basis of a viable RICO claim if the other
elements of RICO are also satisfied.

Background and Relevant Law
Legislation
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) and the
wire fraud statute provide the foundation for analyzing whether the actions
of the mother and stepfather constitute wire fraud as a predicate act under
RICO.
Wire Fraud Statute: 18 U.S.C. § 1343
Under 18 U.S.C. § 1343, wire fraud is defined as:
"Whoever, having devised or intending to devise any scheme or
artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of
false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises,
transmits or causes to be transmitted by means of wire, radio, or
television communication in interstate or foreign commerce, any
writings, signs, signals, pictures, or sounds for the purpose of
executing such scheme or artifice, shall be fined under this title or
imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both." 18 U.S.C. § 1343
(2025)
This statute establishes that wire fraud requires a scheme to defraud, use of
interstate wire communications, and the intent to defraud.
RICO Definitions: 18 U.S.C. § 1961
RICO defines "racketeering activity" to include:
"(B) any act which is indictable under any of the following
provisions of title 18, United States Code: ... section 1343 (relating
to wire fraud)..." 18 U.S.C. § 1961 (2025)
Additionally, a "pattern of racketeering activity" is defined as:
"[requiring] at least two acts of racketeering activity, one of which
occurred after the effective date of this chapter and the last of
which occurred within ten years (excluding any period of
imprisonment) after the commission of a prior act of racketeering
activity." 18 U.S.C. § 1961 (2025)
RICO Prohibited Activities: 18 U.S.C. § 1962
RICO prohibits various activities related to racketeering:
"It shall be unlawful for any person through a pattern of
racketeering activity or through collection of an unlawful debt to
acquire or maintain, directly or indirectly, any interest in or
control of any enterprise which is engaged in, or the activities of

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
which affect, interstate or foreign commerce." 18 U.S.C. § 1962
(2025)
Money Laundering: 18 U.S.C. § 1956
This statute may be relevant to the concealed financial transactions:
"Whoever, knowing that the property involved in a financial
transaction represents the proceeds of some form of unlawful
activity, conducts or attempts to conduct such a financial
transaction which in fact involves the proceeds of specified
unlawful activity—(A)(i) with the intent to promote the carrying on
of specified unlawful activity; or... (B) knowing that the transaction
is designed in whole or in part—(i) to conceal or disguise the
nature, the location, the source, the ownership, or the control of
the proceeds of specified unlawful activity..." 18 U.S.C. § 1956
(2025)
This statute criminalizes financial transactions designed to conceal the
nature, location, source, ownership, or control of proceeds from unlawful
activities.
Case Law
Elements of Wire Fraud
Multiple courts have outlined the essential elements of wire fraud. The
Ninth Circuit in United States v. Miller, 953 F.3d 1095 (9th Cir. 2020) held
that "the wire fraud statute, in plain and simple language, criminalizes the
use of interstate wires to further, not mere deception, but a scheme or
artifice to defraud or obtain money or property, i.e., in every day parlance, to
cheat someone out of something valuable." The court emphasized that wire
fraud requires "intent not only to make false statements or utilize other
forms of deception, but also to deprive a victim of money or property by
means of those deceptions. In other words, a defendant must intend to
deceive and cheat."
This standard was reaffirmed in United States v. Saini, 23 F.4th 1155 (9th
Cir. 2022), which stated that "intent to defraud" under the wire fraud statute
"requires the intent to deceive and cheat." The court defined "intent to
defraud" as "an intention to deceive another person, and to induce such
other person, in reliance upon such deception, to assume, create, transfer,
alter or terminate a right, obligation or power with reference to property."
The Sixth Circuit in United States v. Faulkenberry, 614 F.3d 573 (6th Cir.
2010) identified three elements of wire fraud:
"the defendant devised or willfully participated in a scheme to defraud"
"he used or caused to be used an interstate wire communication 'in
furtherance of the scheme'"
"he intended 'to deprive a victim of money or property'"

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Similarly, in United States v. Daniel, 329 F.3d 480 (6th Cir. 2003), the court
stated that to convict a defendant of wire fraud, the government must prove
"(1) a scheme or artifice to defraud; (2) use of interstate wire
communications in furtherance of the scheme; and (3) intent to deprive a
victim of money or property."
The Eighth Circuit in United States v. Proffit, 49 F.3d 404 (8th Cir. 1995)
elaborated on these elements, listing "four essential elements to the crime of
wire fraud":
"that the defendant voluntarily and intentionally devised or participated
in a scheme to defraud another out of money"
"that the defendant did so with the intent to defraud"
"that it was reasonably foreseeable that interstate wire communications
would be used"
"that interstate wire communications were in fact used"
Intent to Defraud
Courts have provided guidance on how to establish intent to defraud. In 
Schuster v. Anderson, 378 F.Supp.2d 1070 (N.D. Iowa 2005), the court stated
that "No single fact need demonstrate the defendant's intent; rather, intent
to defraud can be discerned by examining the totality of the circumstances
surrounding the defendant's activities."
The article Mail and Wire Fraud (2023) explains that intent to defraud
"involves 'a willful act . . . with the specific intent to deceive or cheat,
usually for the purpose of getting financial gain for one's self or causing
financial loss to another.'"
Another article, Mail and wire fraud (2012), clarifies that "Intent may be
inferred from evidence indicating that the defendant attempted to conceal
activity or from the defendant's misrepresentations."
Wire Communications Requirement
Regarding the interstate wire communications requirement, United States v.
Daniel, 329 F.3d 480 (6th Cir. 2003) specified that the wire fraud statute
requires that the wire communication be employed "for the purpose of
executing such scheme or artifice." This means that "the scheme's
completion or the prevention of its detection must have depended in some
way on the charged mailing."
Similarly, in United States v. Frey, 42 F.3d 795 (3rd Cir. 1994), the court
stated that "mailings [and wirings] which facilitate concealment of the
scheme are covered by the statute."
In P.R. Med. Emergency Grp., Inc. v. Iglesia Episcopal Puertorriquena, Inc.,
Civil No. 14-1616 (FAB) (D. P.R. Jun 16, 2016), the court noted that "the use
of the mails need not be an essential element of the scheme but need only be
'incident to an essential part of the scheme' or 'a step in the plot.'"

RICO Requirements
For RICO claims, United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 101 S.Ct. 2524, 69
L.Ed.2d 246 (1981) established that "In order to secure a conviction under
RICO, the Government must prove both the existence of an 'enterprise' and
the connected 'pattern of racketeering activity.'" It's important to note that 
United States v. Turkette was abrogated by United States v. Lane, 474 U.S.
438, 106 S.Ct. 725, 88 L.Ed.2d 814 (1986). However, the abrogation related
to issues of misjoinder under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 8, not the
core RICO requirements discussed in Turkette, so this specific aspect of the 
Turkette decision remains good law.
Norfe Grp. Corp. v. R.Y. Espinosa Inc., Civil No. 19-1897 (BJM) (D. P.R. May
07, 2021) summarized RICO liability as having "four essential elements: '(1)
conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity.'" The court explained that "racketeering activity" includes numerous
illegal acts, including wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343.
In Hlista v. Safeguard Props., LLC, No. 15-1812 (3rd Cir. May 05, 2016), the
court stated that "A plaintiff bringing a substantive RICO claim under §
1962(c) must allege '(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern
(4) of racketeering activity.'" Furthermore, a pattern of racketeering activity
"'requires at least two acts of racketeering activity within a ten-year
period.'"
Wire Fraud as a Predicate Act
Nutrition Distribution LLC v. Custom Nutraceuticals LLC, 194 F.Supp.3d 952
(D. Ariz. 2016) clarified that "Pleading a pattern of racketeering activity
requires the plaintiff to allege that the defendant participated in at least two
acts that were chargeable under the enumerated federal statutes. The
plaintiff must adequately plead the elements of each predicate act, satisfying
the pleading standard that would apply if the predicate act were a stand-
alone claim."
RICO: A Primer (2022) confirms that "Mail and wire fraud are the most
common predicate acts" under RICO.
Beth Israel Medical Center v. Smith, 576 F.Supp. 1061 (S.D. N.Y. 1983)
addressed whether separate acts of mail and wire fraud arising from a
common nucleus of facts could be considered separate predicate RICO acts.
The court concluded that they could, reasoning that "the plain language of
the statute refers to 'any act which is indictable' under the mail or wire
fraud statutes, without a qualification that each act must occur in a different
factual situation."

Analysis
The Elements of Wire Fraud Applied to the Facts
Based on the case law and statutory provisions outlined above, the actions of
the mother and stepfather—concealed financial transactions, preparation of
pleadings in another state, and coordination with grandparents to serve an
eviction notice—must be analyzed against the three core elements of wire
fraud:
1. A Scheme to Defraud
The concealed financial transactions, preparation of pleadings in another
state, and coordination with grandparents to serve an eviction notice
collectively indicate a coordinated scheme designed to gain unfair
advantage in divorce proceedings. As stated in United States v. Miller, 953 F.
3d 1095 (9th Cir. 2020), a scheme to defraud involves actions intended to
"cheat someone out of something valuable." In this case, the scheme
appears designed to deprive the other party in the divorce proceedings of
their fair share of marital assets or other legal rights.
The concealed financial transactions may fall within the scope of 18 U.S.C. §
1956, which criminalizes transactions designed to "conceal or disguise the
nature, the location, the source, the ownership, or the control" of assets.
This concealment in the context of divorce proceedings strongly suggests a
scheme to defraud.
2. Intent to Defraud
The intent to defraud is a critical element of wire fraud. As established in 
United States v. Saini, 23 F.4th 1155 (9th Cir. 2022), "intent to defraud"
means "an intention to deceive another person, and to induce such other
person, in reliance upon such deception, to assume, create, transfer, alter or
terminate a right, obligation or power with reference to property."
The facts present multiple indicators of intent to defraud:
Concealed financial transactions: As noted in Mail and wire fraud
(2012), "Intent may be inferred from evidence indicating that the
defendant attempted to conceal activity." The concealment of financial
transactions is a direct attempt to hide information that would be
material to the divorce proceedings.
Preparation of pleadings in another state: This suggests an attempt
to manipulate jurisdiction or venue to gain procedural advantage,
demonstrating intent to use deceptive means to gain advantage.
Coordination with grandparents to serve an eviction notice: This
coordination indicates a broader scheme involving multiple parties,
further suggesting intentional planning to gain unfair advantage.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Schuster v. Anderson, 378 F.Supp.2d 1070 (N.D. Iowa 2005) emphasizes that
intent to defraud "can be discerned by examining the totality of the
circumstances surrounding the defendant's activities." The combination of
these actions, when viewed together, provides substantial evidence of intent
to deceive and cheat the other party in the divorce proceedings.
3. Use of Interstate Wire Communications
For wire fraud to be established, the scheme must involve the use of
interstate wire communications. Based on the facts provided, the
preparation of pleadings in another state and coordination with
grandparents strongly suggest the use of interstate communications.
United States v. Daniel, 329 F.3d 480 (6th Cir. 2003) clarified that the wire
communication must be employed "for the purpose of executing such
scheme or artifice," meaning that "the scheme's completion or the
prevention of its detection must have depended in some way on the charged
mailing [or wiring]." If the mother and stepfather used phone calls, emails,
text messages, or other electronic communications across state lines to
coordinate their activities, this element would be satisfied.
P.R. Med. Emergency Grp., Inc. v. Iglesia Episcopal Puertorriquena, Inc.,
Civil No. 14-1616 (FAB) (D. P.R. Jun 16, 2016) emphasized that the use of
wires need not be "an essential element of the scheme but need only be
'incident to an essential part of the scheme' or 'a step in the plot.'"
Therefore, even routine communications used to coordinate the scheme
would satisfy this element.
Wire Fraud as a Predicate Act Under RICO
Having established that the mother and stepfather's actions could constitute
wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343, the next step is to determine whether
this can serve as a predicate act under RICO.
As defined in 18 U.S.C. § 1961 (2025), "racketeering activity" explicitly
includes "any act which is indictable under... section 1343 (relating to wire
fraud)." Therefore, wire fraud clearly qualifies as a predicate act under
RICO.
A "pattern of racketeering activity" requires at least two predicate acts. As
clarified in Beth Israel Medical Center v. Smith, 576 F.Supp. 1061 (S.D. N.Y.
1983), separate acts of wire fraud arising from the same scheme can qualify
as separate predicate acts. Therefore, if the mother and stepfather engaged
in multiple instances of interstate wire communications in furtherance of
their scheme, this could establish the required pattern.
Norfe Grp. Corp. v. R.Y. Espinosa Inc., Civil No. 19-1897 (BJM) (D. P.R. May
07, 2021) summarized RICO liability as requiring "(1) conduct (2) of an
enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity." The mother,
stepfather, and potentially the grandparents could constitute an "enterprise"
under RICO if they associated for the common purpose of defrauding the
other party in the divorce proceedings.

Exceptions and Caveats
Proof of Actual Harm May Not Be Required
It is important to note that United States v. Ames Sintering Co., 927 F.2d 232
(6th Cir. 1990) established that "The government need only charge that the
defendant intended to defraud the victim of money or property, not that the
victim was actually deprived of money or property." Therefore, even if the
scheme was unsuccessful or discovered before significant harm occurred,
wire fraud could still be established.
Reliance Not Required for RICO Claims Based on Wire
Fraud
The Supreme Court in Bridge v. Phoenix Bond & Indem. Co., 553 U.S. 639
(2008) held that "A plaintiff asserting a RICO claim predicated on mail fraud
need not show, either as an element of its claim or as a prerequisite to
establishing proximate causation, that it relied on the defendant's alleged
misrepresentations." This principle extends to wire fraud as well, meaning
that the other party in the divorce proceedings would not need to prove they
relied on the misrepresentations for a RICO claim to succeed.
RICO's Other Requirements
While wire fraud may establish a predicate act under RICO, a successful
RICO claim requires additional elements beyond the scope of this analysis.
As stated in Jones v. Ram Med., Inc., 75 UCC Rep.Serv.2d 707, 807 F.Supp.
2d 501 (D. S.C. 2011), a RICO claim requires "(1) a violation of 18 U.S.C. §
1962, (2) an injury to business or property, and (3) that the injury was
caused by the violation of § 1962." The analysis here focuses primarily on
whether the actions constitute wire fraud as a predicate act, not whether all
elements of a RICO claim are satisfied.
Defending Civil RICO Claims: A Defense Plan Should Be In Every Business's
Arsenal (2022) cautions that "Business deals gone sour do not count" for
RICO claims. However, intentional fraudulent conduct, such as the actions
described here, goes beyond mere business disputes and could satisfy
RICO's requirements.
Conclusion
The actions of the mother and stepfather—concealed financial transactions,
preparation of pleadings in another state, and coordination with
grandparents to serve an eviction notice—provide substantial evidence of
intent to defraud as required for wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343. If these
actions involved interstate wire communications, they would satisfy all
elements of wire fraud:
A scheme to defraud, as evidenced by the coordinated efforts to gain
unfair advantage in divorce proceedings.
1. 

=== PAGE 9 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Intent to defraud, which can be inferred from the concealment of
financial transactions and other deceptive actions.
Use of interstate wire communications in furtherance of the scheme,
which is likely given the interstate nature of the activities.
As wire fraud is explicitly listed as a predicate act under RICO in 18 U.S.C. §
1961, and multiple instances of wire communications could establish the
required pattern of racketeering activity, the actions described could
support a claim of wire fraud as a predicate act under RICO.
The coordinated nature of the activities, involving multiple parties (mother,
stepfather, and grandparents) working together for a common purpose,
could establish the existence of an "enterprise" as required by RICO. If the
other elements of RICO are also satisfied—notably, injury to business or
property resulting from the violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1962—a RICO claim
based on wire fraud as a predicate act could be viable.
In conclusion, the mother and stepfather's deceptive actions in the divorce
proceedings, when coupled with interstate wire communications,
demonstrate the requisite intent to defraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343, thereby
supporting the claim of wire fraud as a predicate act under RICO.
Legal Authorities
Morley v. Cohen, 888 F.2d 1006 (4th Cir. 1989)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fourth Circuit
Extract
The offenses of mail and wire fraud require use of the mails or wires coupled
with an intent to defraud. See 18 U.S.C. Secs. 1341, 1343. ... The key is
whether the communication occurred 'for the purpose of executing the
scheme.' ... Cohen also urges that the evidence fails to support a finding of
intent to defraud. ... Viewing it all, we believe that the evidence was
sufficient to support a jury finding that Cohen acted with intent to defraud.
We therefore conclude that the district court did not err in refusing to grant
a judgment notwithstanding the verdict due to insufficient proof of the
predicate acts for Morley's RICO claim.
Summary
The offenses of mail and wire fraud require both the use of mails or wires
and an intent to defraud. The passage emphasizes that communications
must occur "for the purpose of executing the scheme" to meet the
requirements of these offenses. The court found sufficient evidence to
support a finding of intent to defraud, which is crucial for establishing
predicate acts under RICO. This aligns with the proposition that concealed
financial transactions and interstate communications can demonstrate the
requisite intent to defraud.

P.R. Med. Emergency Grp., Inc. v. Iglesia Episcopal Puertorriquena, Inc.,
Civil No. 14-1616 (FAB) (D. P.R. Jun 16, 2016)
U.S. District Court — District of Puerto Rico
Extract
The elements of mail and wire fraud are (1) a scheme to defraud; (2)
knowing and willful participation in the scheme with the intent to defraud;
and (3) the use of the mails or interstate wire in furtherance of the
fraudulent scheme. See Bonilla v. Volvo Car Corp., 150 F.3d 62, 66 (1st Cir.
1998). ... The third element of mail and wire fraud is the use of the mails or
interstate wire in furtherance of a fraudulent scheme. See 18 U.S.C. § 1341
(mail fraud); id. § 1343 (wire fraud). For this element to be met, 'the use of
the mails need not be an essential element of the scheme but need only be
'incident to an essential part of the scheme' or 'a step in the plot.'
Summary
The use of mails or wires need not be central to the scheme but must be a
step in the plot. This supports the proposition by showing that concealed
financial transactions and interstate communications can demonstrate the
requisite intent to defraud.
United States v. Saini, 23 F.4th 1155 (9th Cir. 2022)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Ninth Circuit
Extract
In Miller, we held that the intent to defraud under the wire fraud statute, 18
U.S.C. § 1343, 'requires the intent to deceive and cheat.' 953 F.3d at 1103. ...
'Intent to defraud' means 'an intention to deceive another person, and to
induce such other person, in reliance upon such deception, to assume,
create, transfer, alter or terminate a right, obligation or power with
reference to property.' ... Based on these definitions, the ordinary meaning
of an 'intent to defraud' as used in § 1029(a)(3) and (4) is an intent to
deprive a person of money or property by deception.
Summary
For wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343, there must be an intent to deceive
and cheat, which aligns with the proposition that the mother and stepfather
acted with intent to deceive in the divorce proceedings. The passage
supports the idea that concealed financial transactions and interstate
communications can demonstrate the requisite intent to defraud, which is
necessary for establishing wire fraud as a predicate act under RICO.

United States v. Weimert, 819 F.3d 351 (7th Cir. 2016)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Seventh Circuit
Extract
The wire fraud statute prohibits schemes to defraud or to obtain money or
property by means of 'false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or
promises' if interstate wire or electronic communications are used to
execute the scheme. 18 U.S.C. § 1343. To convict a person under § 1343, the
government must prove that he '(1) was involved in a scheme to defraud; (2)
had an intent to defraud; and (3) used the wires in furtherance of that
scheme.' United States v. Faruki, 803 F.3d 847, 852 (7th Cir.2015), quoting
Durham, 766 F.3d at 678. To prove a scheme to defraud, the government
must show that Weimert made a material false statement,
misrepresentation, or promise, or concealed a material fact.
Summary
Elements required to prove wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343, which
include involvement in a scheme to defraud, intent to defraud, and the use
of interstate communications to further the scheme. The passage also
emphasizes the need for a material false statement, misrepresentation, or
concealment of a material fact. These elements align with the proposition
that the mother and stepfather's actions, such as concealed financial
transactions and interstate communications, demonstrate the requisite
intent to defraud, supporting the claim of wire fraud as a predicate act
under RICO.
U.S. v. Treadwell, 593 F.3d 990 (9th Cir. 2010)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Ninth Circuit
Extract
According to the federal wire fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1343, any person
who 'having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to
defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent
pretenses, representations, or promises, transmits or causes to be
transmitted by means of wire, radio, or television communication in
interstate or foreign commerce, any writings, signs, signals, pictures, or
sounds for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice,' is guilty of
wire fraud. Conviction under § 1343 means a defendant must have intended
'to defraud' his victim. See United States v. Oren, 893 F.2d 1057, 1061 (9th
Cir.1990). 'To defraud' under § 1343 encompasses 'any scheme to deprive
another of money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses,
representations, or promises.'

=== PAGE 12 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
The use of interstate communications to execute such a scheme is a critical
element of wire fraud. This supports the proposition by showing that
concealed financial transactions and interstate communications, as part of a
scheme to deceive, can demonstrate the requisite intent to defraud under 18
U.S.C. § 1343.
U.S. v. Ashman, 979 F.2d 469 (7th Cir. 1993)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Seventh Circuit
Extract
In order to convict defendants of mail fraud, the jury had to find that they
had a specific intent to defraud. United States v. Johnson, 927 F.2d 999,
1003 (7th Cir.1991). On appeal, we are obliged to view the evidence, and all
reasonable inferences from it, in the light most favorable to the government
and may overturn the finding of intent 'only if the record contains no
evidence, regardless of how it is weighed, from which the jury could find
guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.' United States v. Wiehoff, 748 F.2d 1158,
1160-61 (7th Cir.1984). ... As we shall see, there was indeed sufficient
evidence from which the jury could infer that the defendants intended the
necessary result of their actions.
Summary
The court requires proof of specific intent to defraud to convict someone of
mail or wire fraud. This intent can be inferred from the actions and the
necessary results of those actions, even if the defendants did not explicitly
state their intent to defraud. The passage supports the proposition by
illustrating that intent to defraud can be inferred from deceptive actions,
such as concealed financial transactions and interstate communications,
which are relevant to the claim of wire fraud as a predicate act under RICO.
U.S. v. Daniel, 329 F.3d 480 (6th Cir. 2003)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Sixth Circuit
Extract
To convict a defendant of wire fraud, the government must prove '(1) a
scheme or artifice to defraud; (2) use of interstate wire communications in
furtherance of the scheme; and (3) intent to deprive a victim of money or
property.' United States v. Prince, 214 F.3d 740, 747-48 (6th Cir.2000)
(footnote omitted). ... The government also provided sufficient evidence of
the use of an interstate electronic communication in furtherance of the
scheme to defraud — Daniel's attempt by fax to elicit a letter that would

apparently authorize his actions. The wire fraud statute requires that the
wire communication be employed 'for the purpose of executing such scheme
or artifice.' 18 U.S.C. § 1343. This means that the communication must be
sufficiently related to the scheme, which is to say that 'the scheme's
completion or the prevention of its detection must have depended in some
way on the charged mailing.' United States v. Castile, 795 F.2d 1273, 1278
(6th Cir.1986).
Summary
Clear framework for proving wire fraud, which aligns with the proposition
that the mother and stepfather's actions could constitute wire fraud if they
used interstate communications to further their deceptive scheme in the
divorce proceedings.
United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 101 S.Ct. 2524, 69 L.Ed.2d 246
(1981)
U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
In order to secure a conviction under RICO, the Government must prove
both the existence of an 'enterprise' and the connected 'pattern of
racketeering activity.' The enterprise is an entity, for present purposes a
group of persons associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a
course of conduct. The pattern of racketeering activity is, on the other hand,
a series of criminal acts as defined by the statute. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1) (1976
ed., Supp. III). The former is proved by evidence of an ongoing organization,
formal or informal, and by evidence that the various associates function as a
continuing unit. The latter is proved by evidence of the requisite number of
acts of racketeering committed by the participants in the enterprise.
Summary
The U.S. Supreme Court in United States v. Turkette clarified that for a
RICO conviction, there must be proof of both an "enterprise" and a "pattern
of racketeering activity." This supports the proposition by establishing that
the actions of the mother and stepfather, if they constitute a series of
criminal acts (such as wire fraud), could be seen as part of a pattern of
racketeering activity. The passage also emphasizes that an enterprise can be
a group of persons associated for a common purpose, which aligns with the
coordinated actions described in the proposition.

Extract
Like the mail fraud statute from which it is derived, the wire fraud statute,
in plain and simple language, criminalizes the use of interstate wires to
further, not mere deception, but a scheme or artifice to defraud or obtain
money or property, i.e., in every day parlance, to cheat someone out of
something valuable. It follows that to be guilty of wire fraud, a defendant
must act with the intent not only to make false statements or utilize other
forms of deception, but also to deprive a victim of money or property by
means of those deceptions. In other words, a defendant must intend to
deceive and cheat.
Summary
The Ninth Circuit has clarified that wire fraud requires the specific intent to
deceive and cheat, meaning the defendant must intend to deprive the victim
of money or property through deception. This aligns with the proposition
that the mother and stepfather's actions, involving concealed financial
transactions and interstate communications, demonstrate the requisite
intent to defraud, supporting a claim of wire fraud as a predicate act under
RICO.

U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
Held: A plaintiff asserting a RICO claim predicated on mail fraud need not
show, either as an element of its claim or as a prerequisite to establishing
proximate causation, that it relied on the defendant's alleged
misrepresentations. ... Using the mail to execute or attempt to execute a
scheme to defraud is indictable as mail fraud, and hence a predicate
racketeering act under RICO, even if no one relied on any
misrepresentation... The upshot is that RICO provides a private right of
action for treble damages to any person injured in his business or property
by reason of the conduct of a qualifying enterprise's affairs through a
pattern of acts indictable as mail fraud. Mail fraud, in turn, occurs whenever
a person, 'having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to
defraud,' uses the mail 'for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice
or attempting so to do.' § 1341.
Summary
Under RICO, a plaintiff does not need to prove reliance on
misrepresentations to establish a claim predicated on mail fraud. The use of
mail or wire communications to execute a scheme to defraud is sufficient to

=== PAGE 15 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
constitute a predicate act under RICO. This supports the proposition that
concealed financial transactions and interstate communications, if used to
further a scheme to defraud, can demonstrate the requisite intent to
defraud, thus supporting a claim of wire fraud as a predicate act under
RICO.
Inc v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Company, 492 U.S. 229, 109 S.Ct. 2893,
106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989)
U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
RICO renders criminally and civilly liable 'any person' who uses or invests
income derived 'from a pattern of racketeering activity' to acquire an
interest in or to operate an enterprise engaged in interstate commerce, §
1962(a); who acquires or maintains an interest in or control of such an
enterprise 'through a pattern of racketeering activity,' § 1962(b); who, being
employed by or associated with such an enterprise, conducts or participates
in the conduct of its affairs 'through a pattern of racketeering activity,' §
1962(c); or, finally, who conspires to violate the first three subsections of §
1962, § 1962(d).
Summary
RICO can be applied to individuals who engage in a pattern of racketeering
activity, which includes predicate acts like wire fraud. The passage
highlights the liability of individuals who use or invest income derived from
such activities to operate or control an enterprise engaged in interstate
commerce. This supports the proposition that the mother and stepfather's
actions, involving concealed financial transactions and interstate
communications, could be considered a pattern of racketeering activity
under RICO.
Chambers v. King Buick GMC, LLC, 43 F. Supp. 3d 575 (D. Md. 2014)
U.S. District Court — District of Maryland
Extract
To plead mail or wire fraud, a plaintiff must show: (1) a scheme disclosing
intent to defraud; and (2) the use, respectively, of the mails or interstate
wires in furtherance of the scheme. ... In the context of a RICO action, the
mailings or wirings do not need to contain the misrepresentations that
defrauded the plaintiff, but they must be in furtherance of the fraudulent,
material misrepresentation upon which the plaintiff justifiably relied to her
detriment.

=== PAGE 16 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
The communications themselves do not need to contain the fraudulent
misrepresentations, but they must further the fraudulent scheme. This
supports the proposition that concealed financial transactions and interstate
communications can demonstrate the requisite intent to defraud, aligning
with the requirements for wire fraud under RICO.
Sedima v. Imrex Company, Inc, 473 U.S. 479, 105 S.Ct. 3275, 87 L.Ed.2d 346
(1985)
U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
Under the Court's opinion today, two fraudulent mailings or uses of the
wires occurring within 10 years of each other might constitute a 'pattern of
racketeering activity,' § 1961(5), leading to civil RICO liability. See § 1964(c).
The effects of making a mere two instances of mail or wire fraud potentially
actionable under civil RICO are staggering, because in recent years the
Courts of Appeals have 'tolerated an extraordinary expansion of mail and
wire fraud statutes to permit federal prosecution for conduct that some had
thought was subject only to state criminal and civil law.'
Summary
The U.S. Supreme Court recognizes that even two instances of mail or wire
fraud can constitute a "pattern of racketeering activity" under RICO. This
supports the proposition that the use of concealed financial transactions and
interstate communications, if proven to be fraudulent, can demonstrate the
requisite intent to defraud, thereby supporting a claim of wire fraud as a
predicate act under RICO. The passage highlights the broad interpretation
of mail and wire fraud statutes, which aligns with the proposition's assertion
of deceptive actions and interstate communications being used to further a
fraudulent scheme.
Schuster v. Anderson, 378 F.Supp.2d 1070 (N.D. Iowa 2005)
U.S. District Court — Northern District of Iowa
Extract
Further, mail and wire fraud are established by showing the following four
elements: (1) a scheme to defraud; (2) intent to defraud; (3) reasonable
foreseeability that the mails or wires would be used; and (4) use of the mails
or wires in furtherance of the scheme. ... A showing of an intent to defraud
is critical to establishment of the predicate acts of wire fraud: No single fact
need demonstrate the defendant's intent; rather, intent to defraud can be

=== PAGE 17 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
discerned by examining the totality of the circumstances surrounding the
defendant's activities.
Summary
To establish wire fraud as a predicate act under RICO, there must be a
scheme to defraud, intent to defraud, foreseeability of using mails or wires,
and actual use of mails or wires in furtherance of the scheme. The passage
emphasizes that intent to defraud can be inferred from the totality of
circumstances, which aligns with the proposition that deceptive actions and
concealed transactions can demonstrate the requisite intent to defraud.
Nutrition Distribution LLC v. Custom Nutraceuticals LLC, 194 F.Supp.3d 952
(D. Ariz. 2016)
U.S. District Court — District of Arizona
Extract
RICO makes it unlawful for 'any person employed by or associated with any
enterprise engaged in...interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or
participate...in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of
racketeering activity.' 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). 'Racketeering activity' includes
any of several listed crimes 'which is chargeable under State law and
punishable by imprisonment for more than one year,' as well as any act
chargeable under one of several enumerated federal statutes. § 1961(1). A
'pattern of racketeering activity' requires at least two acts of racketeering
activity, which must be 'related' and 'amount to or pose a threat of continued
criminal activity.' ... Pleading a pattern of racketeering activity requires the
plaintiff to allege that the defendant participated in at least two acts that
were chargeable under the enumerated federal statutes. The plaintiff must
adequately plead the elements of each predicate act, satisfying the pleading
standard that would apply if the predicate act were a stand-alone claim.
Summary
Requirements for establishing a RICO claim, specifically the need to
demonstrate a pattern of racketeering activity, which includes at least two
predicate acts chargeable under federal statutes. Wire fraud, as a predicate
act, requires proof of intent to defraud, which can be inferred from
deceptive actions and the use of interstate communications. The passage
supports the proposition by explaining the legal framework for RICO claims
and the necessity of demonstrating intent and a pattern of racketeering
activity.

'requires at least two acts of racketeering activity within a ten-year period.'
Id. (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5)); see Banks v. Wolk, 918 F.2d 418, 421 (3d
Cir. 1990) ('[N]o defendant can be liable under RICO unless he participated
in two or more predicate offenses sufficient to constitute a pattern.'). These
are known as 'predicate acts' and 'may include, inter alia, federal mail fraud
under 18 U.S.C. § 1341 or federal wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343.' Lum v.
Bank of Am., 361 F.3d 217, 223 (3d Cir. 2004), abrogated in part on other
grounds by Twombly, 550 U.S. at 557; 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1) (defining
'racketeering activity'). Where, as here, the predicate acts alleged are mail
and wire fraud, plaintiffs are subject to the heightened pleading standard for
fraud set forth in Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b), which states that 'a party must state
with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud.' Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b);
e.g., Lum, 361 F.3d at 223. The elements of mail or wire fraud are: '(1) a
scheme to defraud; (2) use of the mails [or wires] to further that scheme;
and (3) fraudulent intent.' United States v. Pharis, 298 F.3d 228, 234 (3d Cir.
2002). Although '[a] scheme or artifice to defraud need not be fraudulent on
its face, [it] must involve some sort of fraudulent misrepresentation or
omission reasonably calculated to deceive persons of ordinary prudence and
comprehension.' Lum, 361 F.3d at 223 (internal quotation marks omitted).
Summary
To support a RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), a plaintiff must
demonstrate conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering
activity, which includes at least two predicate acts such as wire fraud. The
elements of wire fraud include a scheme to defraud, use of wires to further
the scheme, and fraudulent intent. The passage explains that fraudulent
intent can be inferred from deceptive actions and omissions. This aligns with
the proposition that the mother and stepfather's actions, including
concealed financial transactions and interstate communications,
demonstrate the requisite intent to defraud, supporting a wire fraud claim
as a predicate act under RICO.

Orthopedics, 781 F.3d at 528 (citing 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1)). Among these are
mail and wire fraud, 18 U.S.C. §§ 1341, 1343, which are the relevant
predicate acts in Norfe's amended complaint. Mail fraud 'occurs whenever a
person, 'having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to
defraud,' uses the mail 'for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice
or attempting so to do.' Bridge v. Phoenix Bond & Indem. Co., 553 U.S. 639,
647 (2008) (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 1341). 'The gravamen of the offense is the
scheme to defraud, and any mailing that is incident to an essential part of
the scheme satisfies the mailing element [] even if the mailing itself
contain[s] no false information.' Id. (citation and internal quotation marks
omitted). Similarly, 'to make out a civil claim under RICO by way of wire
fraud, a plaintiff must allege that a group of defendants 'engaged in a
scheme to defraud with the specific intent to defraud and that they used...
the interstate wires in furtherance of the scheme.'
Summary
RICO claims require proof of a scheme to defraud, which can be
demonstrated through mail and wire fraud. The passage explains that the
intent to defraud can be inferred from the use of mail or wire
communications in furtherance of the scheme, even if the communications
themselves do not contain false information. This supports the proposition
that concealed financial transactions and interstate communications can
demonstrate the requisite intent to defraud under RICO.
Beth Israel Medical Center v. Smith, 576 F.Supp. 1061 (S.D. N.Y. 1983)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of New York
Extract
Movants' contention that separate acts of mail and wire fraud arising out of
a common nucleus of facts cannot be considered separate predicate RICO
acts is without merit. This contention has been specifically rejected by the
Courts of Appeals of at least two Circuits, for reasons which are clear. First,
the plain language of the statute refers to 'any act which is indictable' under
the mail or wire fraud statutes, without a qualification that each act must
occur in a different factual situation. Second, it would contradict the
requirement of a 'pattern of racketeering activity' to hold that the acts
making up the pattern must take place in unconnected factual
circumstances. It follows that the instant complaint, by alleging violations of
both the mail and wire fraud statutes, adequately alleges the two predicate
RICO acts required to establish a pattern of racketeering activity.
Summary
The passage from Beth Israel Medical Center v. Smith clarifies that separate
acts of mail and wire fraud, even if arising from a common nucleus of facts,
can be considered separate predicate acts under RICO. This supports the
proposition that the use of concealed financial transactions and interstate

=== PAGE 20 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
communications, as part of a scheme to defraud, can constitute wire fraud
as a predicate act under RICO. The court's rejection of the argument that
such acts must occur in different factual situations reinforces the idea that
deceptive actions and interstate communications can demonstrate the
requisite intent to defraud.

S.C. 2011)
U.S. District Court — District of South Carolina
Extract
To establish a claim under RICO, a plaintiff must show: (1) a violation of 18
U.S.C. § 1962, (2) an injury to business or property, and (3) that the injury
was caused by the violation of § 1962. ... Defendants next contend that
Plaintiffs have failed to plead a “pattern of racketeering,” which requires a
series of identifiable predicate acts that fall within the scope of 18 U.S.C. §
1961. ... As to the claim of wire fraud, 18 U.S.C. § 1343 states, “Whoever,
having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud, or
for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses ...
transmits or causes to be transmitted by means of wire, radio, or television
communication in interstate or foreign commerce, any writings, signs,
signal, pictures, or sounds for the purpose of executing such scheme or
artifice” shall be guilty of wire fraud. For a wire fraud claim, the plaintiff
must allege “1) a scheme to defraud and 2) the use of a wire communication
in furtherance of that scheme.”
Summary
Wire fraud involves a scheme to defraud and the use of wire
communications to further that scheme. This aligns with the proposition that
the mother and stepfather's actions, involving concealed financial
transactions and interstate communications, could be seen as a scheme to
defraud, thus supporting a wire fraud claim under RICO.

U.S. District Court — Northern District of California
Extract
Wire fraud and mail fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1341 and 1343,
respectively, can serve as predicate offenses. Plaintiffs, however, have failed
to allege facts to raise the reasonable inference that defendants committed
at least two instances of either offense. Wire fraud and mail fraud share the
same elements: (1) that the defendant formed a scheme to defraud; (2) used
the United States wires [for wire fraud] or United States mail [for mail
fraud] in furtherance of the scheme; and (3) did so with a specific intent to
deceive or defraud.
Summary
Elements required to establish wire fraud, which aligns with the proposition
that the mother and stepfather's actions could be considered wire fraud if

States mails or caused a use of the United States mails in furtherance of the
scheme; and (3) the defendants did so with the specific intent to deceive or
defraud. ... Similarly, a wire fraud violation consists of (1) the formation of a
scheme or artifice to defraud; (2) use of the United States wires or causing a
use of the United States wires in furtherance of the scheme; and (3) specific
intent to deceive or defraud.
Summary
Necessary elements to establish mail and wire fraud as predicate acts under
RICO, which include the formation of a scheme to defraud and the use of
mail or wire communications with the specific intent to deceive. This directly
supports the proposition that the mother and stepfather's actions, involving
concealed financial transactions and interstate communications, could
demonstrate the requisite intent to defraud, thus supporting a claim of wire
fraud under RICO.
U.S. v. Proffit, 49 F.3d 404 (8th Cir. 1995)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Eighth Circuit
Extract
the four essential elements to the crime of wire fraud are: (1) that the
defendant voluntarily and intentionally devised or participated in a scheme
to defraud another out of money; (2) that the defendant did so with the
intent to defraud; (3) that it was reasonably foreseeable that interstate wire
communications would be used; and (4) that interstate wire communications
were in fact used.
Summary
Essential elements required to establish wire fraud, which include the intent
to defraud and the use of interstate wire communications. These elements
are directly relevant to the proposition, which involves allegations of wire
fraud as a predicate act under RICO. The passage supports the proposition
by providing a legal framework for understanding how intent to defraud and
the use of interstate communications can be established in a wire fraud
case.

To prove a wire fraud offense under § 1343, the government must establish:
(1) a scheme to defraud; and (2) use of wire communications in furtherance

of the scheme. ... In addition, the government must prove that the scheme
must have intended to deprive a victim of money or property. ... The
government need only charge that the defendant intended to defraud the
victim of money or property, not that the victim was actually deprived of
money or property.
Summary
To establish a wire fraud offense under 18 U.S.C. § 1343, it is necessary to
demonstrate a scheme to defraud and the use of wire communications in
furtherance of that scheme. Importantly, the intent to defraud is a critical
element, and it is not necessary for the victim to have actually been deprived
of money or property. This aligns with the proposition that the mother and
stepfather's actions, including concealed financial transactions and
interstate communications, demonstrate the requisite intent to defraud,
supporting the claim of wire fraud as a predicate act under RICO.
U.S. v. Frey, 42 F.3d 795 (3rd Cir. 1994)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Third Circuit
Extract
The elements required to support a conviction under the mail fraud statute,
18 U.S.C. Sec. 1341, are: 1) a scheme to defraud; and 2) the use of the mails
for the purpose of executing, or attempting to execute, the scheme. ... The
wire fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1343, is identical to the mail fraud statute
except it speaks of communications transmitted by wire. ... The mailing, or
wiring, could support a mail or wire fraud conviction 'if the mailing is part of
executing the fraud, or closely related to the scheme ... even though the
mailing was also related to a valid business purpose.' ... '[M]ailings [and
wirings] which facilitate concealment of the scheme are covered by the
statute.'
Summary
Elements required to establish mail and wire fraud, emphasizing that a
scheme to defraud and the use of mail or wire communications to execute or
conceal the scheme are necessary. The passage also clarifies that even
routine business communications can be considered part of the fraud if they
facilitate the scheme. This supports the proposition by showing that
concealed financial transactions and interstate communications, if used to
further a fraudulent scheme, can demonstrate the intent to defraud required
for wire fraud under RICO.

States v. Durham, 766 F.3d 672, 678 (7th Cir.2014). ... Yet, the federal wire
fraud statute states: Whoever, having devised or intending to devise any
scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means
of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, transmits or
causes to be transmitted by means of wire ... any writings, signs, signals,
pictures, or sounds for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice,
shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both.
Summary
Clear legal standard for establishing wire fraud, which aligns with the
proposition that concealed financial transactions and interstate
communications can demonstrate intent to defraud, thus supporting a wire
fraud claim as a predicate act under RICO.
Banks v. Wolk, 918 F.2d 418 (3rd Cir. 1990)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Third Circuit
Extract
The gravamen of the complaint was that Wolk and the Cohens concealed
Wolk's involvement with the buyers in an attempt to gain a favorable price
for the AP Building. The complaint also alleged that James Weiner, the
attorney for the buyers, participated in this fraud. The RICO claim was
based on allegations that all defendants committed two or more unspecified
acts of mail and wire fraud in carrying out the scheme... Predicate offenses
committed in furtherance of a single criminal scheme can constitute a RICO
pattern if the acts present the threat of future criminal activity. The criminal
conduct need not be ongoing. Past conduct will satisfy the continuity
requirement if 'by its nature [it] projects into the future with a threat of
repetition.'
Summary
Use of concealed actions and fraudulent schemes to gain an advantage,
which aligns with the proposition that the mother and stepfather acted with
intent to deceive. It highlights that predicate acts like wire fraud can be part
of a RICO claim if they show a pattern of racketeering activity, even if the
scheme is not ongoing but poses a threat of future criminal activity. This
supports the idea that concealed financial transactions and interstate
communications can demonstrate intent to defraud.

Oren concedes, as he must, that reliance is not a necessary element of the
wire fraud offense. See United States v. Halbert, 712 F.2d 388, 390 (9th Cir.
1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1005, 104 S.Ct. 997, 79 L.Ed.2d 230 (1984). He
argues instead that the district court should have admitted it as relevant to
Oren's intent to defraud. He further views this evidence as relevant to the
question of whether his misrepresentations were material.
Summary
Reliance is not a necessary element for a wire fraud conviction, which aligns
with the proposition that intent to defraud can be inferred from deceptive
actions. The passage also highlights the importance of intent to defraud and
material misrepresentations, which are relevant to establishing wire fraud
as a predicate act under RICO. This supports the proposition that concealed
financial transactions and interstate communications can demonstrate the
requisite intent to defraud.
United States v. Maddux, 917 F.3d 437 (6th Cir. 2019)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Sixth Circuit
Extract
To recover on a RICO claim, a plaintiff must make two showings: first, that
the defendant committed one of the statute's 'so-called predicate acts,'
which include mail or wire fraud; and second, that the predicate act was the
'proximate cause' of the plaintiff's injury. ... But that holding is inapposite
here, because—unlike the RICO statute—the mail and wire fraud statutes do
not require any proof that the defendant's fraud caused losses for the victim.
See Pasquantino, 544 U.S. at 371, 125 S.Ct. 1766 ('[T]he wire fraud statute
punishes the scheme, not its success' (internal citation and quotation marks
omitted)).
Summary
For a RICO claim, a predicate act such as wire fraud must be established.
Importantly, the wire fraud statute does not require proof that the fraud
caused losses to the victim; it punishes the scheme itself. This supports the
proposition that the intent to defraud can be inferred from the scheme's
deceptive actions, such as concealed financial transactions and interstate
communications, without needing to show actual harm to the victim.

United States v. Faulkenberry, 614 F.3d 573 (6th Cir. 2010)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Sixth Circuit
Extract
Faulkenberry challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his
conviction for wire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1343. That section
provides in relevant part: 'Whoever, having devised ... any scheme or artifice
to defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or
fraudulent pretenses, [or] representations ... transmits or causes to be
transmitted by means of wire ... in interstate or foreign commerce, any
writings ... for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice,' shall be
subject to imprisonment. ... The first element of wire fraud, then, is that the
defendant devised or willfully participated in a scheme to defraud. The
second is that he used or caused to be used an interstate wire
communication 'in furtherance of the scheme'; and the third, that he
intended 'to deprive a victim of money or property.'
Summary
The elements of wire fraud include devising or participating in a scheme to
defraud, using interstate wire communications to further the scheme, and
intending to deprive a victim of money or property. These elements align
with the proposition that the mother and stepfather's actions, including
concealed financial transactions and interstate communications,
demonstrate the requisite intent to defraud, supporting a claim of wire fraud
as a predicate act under RICO.
U.S. v. Prince, 214 F.3d 740 (6th Cir. 1999)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Sixth Circuit
Extract
In this case, the indictment identifies wire fraud as the underlying felony
from which the proceeds were derived. The elements of wire fraud, as
prescribed under 18 U.S.C. section 1343, are as follows: (1) a scheme or
artifice to defraud; (2) use of interstate wire communications in furtherance
of the scheme; and (3) intent to deprive a victim of money or property.

Summary
Elements of wire fraud, which include a scheme to defraud, the use of
interstate communications, and the intent to deprive a victim of money or
property. These elements align with the proposition that the mother and
stepfather engaged in deceptive actions and used interstate communications

In re Insurance Brokerage Antitrust Litig., 618 F.3d 300 (3rd Cir. 2010)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Third Circuit
Extract
According to the RICO statute, a “pattern of racketeering activity” requires
at least two acts of racketeering activity within a ten-year period. 18 U.S.C. §
1961(5). “These predicate acts of racketeering may include, inter alia,
federal mail fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1341 or federal wire fraud under 18
U.S.C. § 1343.” Lum, 361 F.3d at 223; see 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1) (defining
“racketeering activity”). Plaintiffs assert that the defendant brokers in both
the Commercial Case and Employee Benefits Case committed “numerous
acts of mail and wire fraud” in furtherance of the enterprises to which they
allegedly belonged.
Summary
The RICO statute requires at least two acts of racketeering activity, which
can include wire fraud, to establish a pattern of racketeering activity. The
passage supports the proposition by highlighting that wire fraud, which
involves intent to defraud through interstate communications, can serve as a
predicate act under RICO. This aligns with the proposition's assertion that
concealed financial transactions and interstate communications demonstrate
the requisite intent to defraud.
18 U.S.C. § 1343 18 U.S.C. § 1343 Fraud By Wire, Radio, Or Television
Extract
Whoever, having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to

under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both.
Summary
18 U.S.C. § 1343 outlines the federal crime of wire fraud, which involves
devising a scheme to defraud and using interstate wire communications to
execute that scheme. The passage supports the proposition by highlighting
that intent to defraud can be inferred from the use of interstate

18 U.S.C. § 1961 18 U.S.C. § 1961 Definitions
Extract
As used in this chapter- 'racketeering activity' means ... (B) any act which is
indictable under any of the following provisions of title 18, United States
Code: ... section 1343 (relating to wire fraud), ... 'pattern of racketeering
activity' requires at least two acts of racketeering activity, one of which
occurred after the effective date of this chapter and the last of which
occurred within ten years (excluding any period of imprisonment) after the
commission of a prior act of racketeering activity;
Summary
The definition of "racketeering activity" under RICO includes acts indictable
under section 1343, which relates to wire fraud. The passage also explains
that a "pattern of racketeering activity" requires at least two acts of such
activity. This supports the proposition by establishing that wire fraud, as a
predicate act, can be part of a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO,
which is relevant to the claim that the mother and stepfather's actions could
constitute such a pattern.
18 U.S.C. § 1962 18 U.S.C. § 1962 Prohibited Activities
Extract
It shall be unlawful for any person through a pattern of racketeering activity
or through collection of an unlawful debt to acquire or maintain, directly or
indirectly, any interest in or control of any enterprise which is engaged in, or
the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce.
Summary
18 U.S.C. § 1962 outlines unlawful activities related to racketeering,
including acquiring or maintaining control of an enterprise through a
pattern of racketeering activity. This supports the proposition by
establishing that using concealed financial transactions and interstate
communications to further a scheme can be considered a pattern of
racketeering activity, which is relevant to the claim of wire fraud as a
predicate act under RICO.

18 U.S.C. § 1956 18 U.S.C. § 1956 Laundering of Monetary Instruments
Extract
Whoever, knowing that the property involved in a financial transaction
represents the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity, conducts or
attempts to conduct such a financial transaction which in fact involves the
proceeds of specified unlawful activity-(A)(i) with the intent to promote the
carrying on of specified unlawful activity; or... (B) knowing that the
transaction is designed in whole or in part-(i) to conceal or disguise the
nature, the location, the source, the ownership, or the control of the
proceeds of specified unlawful activity; or (ii) to avoid a transaction
reporting requirement under State or Federal law, shall be sentenced to a
fine of not more than $500,000 or twice the value of the property involved in
the transaction, whichever is greater, or imprisonment for not more than
twenty years, or both.
Summary
The passage from 18 U.S.C. § 1956 discusses the criminalization of financial
transactions that are conducted with the knowledge that they involve
proceeds from unlawful activities and are designed to conceal or disguise
the nature, location, source, ownership, or control of those proceeds. This
aligns with the proposition that the mother and stepfather engaged in
concealed financial transactions with the intent to deceive and gain an
unfair advantage. The statute provides a legal basis for considering such
actions as predicate acts under RICO, particularly when they involve
interstate communications or transactions.

MAIL AND WIRE FRAUD
American Criminal Law Review - Georgetown University Law Center -
2021-07-01
Extract
Evidence that the defendant attempted to conceal activity or make
misrepresentations may allow courts to infer intent to defraud. The
government may introduce evidence of a victim’s actual financial loss as
proof of an intent to defraud, though this information is not required. A
defendant’s failure to take steps to ameliorate such a loss may also be
relevant to intent. Moreover, absent substantial prejudice, evidence of bad
acts—whether before or after the charged offense—are admissible to
demonstrate intent.
Summary
The concealment of activities and misrepresentations can be used to infer
intent to defraud, which is a critical element in proving wire fraud. The
passage also highlights that evidence of financial loss and failure to mitigate
such loss can further support the inference of intent. This aligns with the
proposition that the mother and stepfather's actions, including concealed
financial transactions and interstate communications, demonstrate the
requisite intent to defraud.
Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy
The Brief - American Bar Association - 2024-01-01
Extract
A violation of § 1962(c), the section on which Sedima relies, requires (1)
conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity. The plaintiff must allege each of the elements to state a claim. They
are all equally essential components, and the complaint will fail if any one of
them is not adequately pleaded. In particular, RICO claims based on mail or
wire fraud must comport with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b)’s
requirement that allegations involving fraud be pleaded with particularity...
RICO’s broad definition of racketeering activity and the act’s reference to
mail and wire fraud as predicate offenses begs the question: Why not RICO?
That is, should the plaintiff consider adding a RICO count to an existing
state cause of action? Moreover, since an action under RICO arises under
federal law, a plaintiff can elect to have access to federal court.

Summary
Elements required to establish a RICO violation under § 1962(c),
emphasizing the need for conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of
racketeering activity, which includes mail and wire fraud. It highlights the
necessity of pleading fraud with particularity under Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 9(b). The passage also suggests the strategic advantage of adding
a RICO count to a state cause of action due to its broad applicability and
access to federal court. This supports the proposition by indicating that
concealed financial transactions and interstate communications, if part of a
fraudulent scheme, could constitute wire fraud as a predicate act under
RICO.
Theft offenses
Defending Specific Crimes - James Publishing - Timothy E. Zerillo -

Extract
Wire fraud, 18 U.S.C. §1343, is very similar to the mail fraud statute. It adds
the requirement of the use of an interstate telephone call or electronic
communication made in furtherance of the scheme. See United States v.
Briscoe, 65 F.3d 576, 583 (7th Cir. 1995) (citing United States v. Ames
Sintering Co., 927 F.2d 232, 234 (6th Cir. 1990) (per curiam)); United States
v. Frey, 42 F.3d 795, 797 (3d Cir. 1994). According to United States v. Profit,
49 F.3d 404, 406 n. 1 (8th Cir. 1995), there are four elements of a wire fraud
case: (1) that the defendant voluntarily and intentionally devised or
participated in a scheme to defraud another out of money, (2) that the
defendant did so with the intent to defraud, (3) that it was reasonably
foreseeable that interstate wire communications would be used, and (4) that
interstate wire communications were in fact used.
Summary
Elements necessary to establish wire fraud, which aligns with the
proposition that the mother and stepfather's actions could constitute wire
fraud if they used interstate communications to further their deceptive
scheme in the divorce proceedings.

Extract
the wire fraud statute provides for harsher penalties than do both CEA
Section 4c(a)(5)(C) and the commodities fraud statute--the former authorizes
imprisonment of up to 30 years for wire fraud affecting a financial
institution... the wire fraud statute, which criminalizes any scheme to
defraud that affects interstate or foreign commerce, has a broader
jurisdictional reach... wire fraud does not require proof of a false statement.
Such statements are proscribed, but so is 'the omission or concealment of
material information, even absent an affirmative duty to disclose, if the
omission was intended to induce a false belief and action to the advantage of
the schemer and the disadvantage of the victim.'
Summary
The passage explains that wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343 does not
require an express misrepresentation but can be based on the omission or
concealment of material information intended to deceive. This aligns with
the proposition that concealed financial transactions and interstate
communications can demonstrate intent to defraud. The passage also
highlights the broad jurisdictional reach of the wire fraud statute, which
supports its applicability in cases involving interstate communications, such
as those described in the proposition.

Desai acted with a high degree of scienter. &#34;Scienter is &#39;a mental
state embracing intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud.&#39;&#34; At
the time of his guilty plea, Desai admitted that his misrepresentations were
&#34;made knowingly and willfully with the intent to defraud various
investors of money and property.&#34; In his civil case, the district court
found that in addition to &#34;misappropriat[ing]. .. investors&#39; funds

Summary
Concept of scienter, which is a mental state involving intent to deceive,
manipulate, or defraud. Desai's actions, including knowingly and willfully
making misrepresentations to defraud investors and attempting to conceal
the true value of accounts, demonstrate a high degree of scienter. This is
relevant to the proposition as it provides a parallel in demonstrating intent

Extract
See SEC v. Steadman, 967 F.2d 636, 641-42 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (scienter is 'an
intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud'). See, e.g., United States v.
Stergios, 659 F.3d 127, 132 (1st Cir. 2011) (stating that elements of mail
fraud include 'knowing and willful participation in [a] scheme [to defraud]
with the specific intent to defraud'); United States v. Miller, 953 F.3d 1095,
1098-99, 1101-03 (9th Cir. 2020) (holding that wire fraud requires specific
intent to deceive and cheat).
Summary
The legal concept of "scienter," or intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud,
is a critical element in proving wire fraud. The passage cites federal court
decisions that clarify the necessity of demonstrating a specific intent to
defraud in cases of mail and wire fraud. This supports the proposition by
establishing that concealed financial transactions and interstate
communications, if done with the intent to deceive, can meet the legal
threshold for wire fraud, which is a predicate act under RICO.

transactions and interstate communications to further a scheme can
demonstrate the requisite intent to defraud. This aligns with the claim that
such actions can support a wire fraud charge under RICO.

Extract
Second, to prove most types of RICO claims, the plaintiff must plead that the
defendant committed some qualifying criminal action, the most common of
which is mail, wire or securities fraud. Business deals gone sour do not
count. Rather, the plaintiff must be able to prove the elements of the
asserted crime, and often an intent to defraud. If there is nothing criminal in
nature about the complained-of conduct, RICO should not apply.
Summary
For a RICO claim to be valid, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the
defendant committed a qualifying criminal action, such as wire fraud, which
requires proving the intent to defraud. This aligns with the proposition that
the mother and stepfather's actions, including concealed financial
transactions and interstate communications, could demonstrate the
requisite intent to defraud, thus supporting a wire fraud claim as a predicate
act under RICO.
