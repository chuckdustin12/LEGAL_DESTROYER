Question
Morgan Michelle Myers, Margie Evonne Wilson, and Danielle Kenneth
Branthoover each played a role in preparing, submitting, and coordinating
the use of false documents. Under RICO, a person must participate in the
operation or management of the enterprise to be held liable (Reves v. Ernst
& Young, 507 U.S. 170 (1993)). The active roles of the individuals in
preparing and submitting false documents indicate their participation in the
operation or management of the enterprise.
Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
Individuals who actively prepare and submit false documents can be held
liable under RICO as they are participating in the operation or management
of the enterprise under the Reves test. The roles played by Morgan Michelle
Myers, Margie Evonne Wilson, and Danielle Kenneth Branthoover in
preparing, submitting, and coordinating the use of false documents likely
constitute sufficient participation to meet the "operation or management"
test established in Reves v. Ernst & Young.
Summary
Under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO),
specifically 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), a person must "conduct or participate,
directly or indirectly, in the conduct of [the] enterprise's affairs through a
pattern of racketeering activity" to be held liable. The Supreme Court in 
Reves v. Ernst & Young established the "operation or management" test,
which requires that a defendant have "some part in directing the
enterprise's affairs" to be liable under RICO. This test does not limit liability
to upper management or those with formal positions in the enterprise but
extends to those who play some role in directing the enterprise's affairs,
including lower-rung participants operating under the direction of upper
management.
The activities of Morgan Michelle Myers, Margie Evonne Wilson, and
Danielle Kenneth Branthoover in preparing, submitting, and coordinating
the use of false documents likely constitute participation in the operation or
management of the enterprise under RICO. Multiple courts have held that
active involvement in an enterprise's core activities, such as preparing and
submitting false documents, can satisfy the Reves test even for individuals
who are not in positions of upper management. Their direct involvement in
these activities indicates they had "some part in directing the enterprise's
affairs," as required by the Supreme Court, particularly if these activities
were integral to the enterprise's pattern of racketeering activity.

Background and Relevant Law
Legislation
RICO's core provision relevant to this analysis is 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), which
states: "It shall be unlawful for any person employed by or associated with
any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or
foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the
conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering
activity or collection of unlawful debt." 18 U.S.C. § 1962 (2025). This
provision establishes the fundamental requirement that a defendant must
participate in the conduct of the enterprise's affairs through a pattern of
racketeering activity to be liable under RICO.
Case Law
The Supreme Court's decision in Reves v. Ernst & Young, 507 U.S. 170
(1993) established the authoritative test for determining whether a
defendant's actions constitute participation in the "conduct of such
enterprise's affairs" as required by § 1962(c). The Court held that to conduct
or participate in the conduct of an enterprise's affairs, "one must have some
part in directing those affairs." The Court further explained:
"Of course, the word 'participate' makes clear that RICO liability is not
limited to those with primary responsibility for the enterprise's affairs, just
as the phrase 'directly or indirectly' makes clear that RICO liability is not
limited to those with a formal position in the enterprise, but some part in
directing the enterprise's affairs is required. The 'operation or management'
test expresses this requirement in a formulation that is easy to apply." Reves
v. Ernst & Young, 507 U.S. 170, 179 (1993).
This "operation or management" test does not restrict liability to those at
the top of an organization. The Supreme Court specifically noted that: "An
enterprise is 'operated' not just by upper management but also by lower
rung participants in the enterprise who are under the direction of upper
management." Reves v. Ernst & Young, 507 U.S. 170, 184 (1993). This
clarification is crucial for understanding how individuals at various levels of
an enterprise may be subject to RICO liability.
The Ninth Circuit in U.S. v. Fernandez, 388 F.3d 1199 (9th Cir. 2004)
reiterated this interpretation of the Reves test, stating that RICO liability
"was limited to 'those who participate in the operation or management of an
enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity.'" U.S. v. Fernandez,
388 F.3d 1199, 1228 (9th Cir. 2004). However, it's important to note that
Fernandez has been stated as abrogated by Aliff v. Vervent, Inc., 20-cv-697-
DMS-AHG (S.D. Cal. Aug 22, 2022), though the abrogation likely relates to
other aspects of the decision and not the interpretation of the Reves test,
which remains consistent with Supreme Court precedent.
The Second Circuit in U.S. v. Diaz, 176 F.3d 52 (2nd Cir. 1999) also
emphasized that liability extends beyond upper management: "The Court

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
recognized that those who operate or direct a RICO enterprise sufficient to
conduct its affairs are not limited to 'upper management,' but might also be
'lower rung participants in the enterprise who are under the direction of
upper management.'" U.S. v. Diaz, 176 F.3d 52, 92 (2nd Cir. 1999).
Similarly, the Eighth Circuit in Handeen v. Lemaire, 112 F.3d 1339 (8th Cir.
1997) confirmed that "Liability under § 1962(c) extends only to those
persons associated with or employed by an enterprise who 'conduct or
participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs
through a pattern of racketeering activity.'" Handeen v. Lemaire, 112 F.3d
1339, 1347 (8th Cir. 1997).
In U.S. v. Darden, 70 F.3d 1507 (8th Cir. 1995), the court elaborated on the
scope of the operation or management test, noting that "An enterprise is
operated not just by upper management. An enterprise is also operated by
lower-rung participants who are under the direction of upper management." 
U.S. v. Darden, 70 F.3d 1507, 1543 (8th Cir. 1995).
The Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576
(1981) is also relevant for understanding the scope of RICO's application.
The Court interpreted § 1962(c) as making it unlawful "for any person
employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities
of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate,
directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a
pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt." United States
v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 580 (1981). However, it's important to note that
Turkette was abrogated by United States v. Lane, 474 U.S. 438 (1986),
though the abrogation likely relates to other aspects of the decision and not
this interpretation of § 1962(c).
In a more recent case, Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938 (2009), the
Supreme Court reiterated that RICO "makes it 'unlawful for any person
employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities
of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate,
directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a
pattern of racketeering activity.'" Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938, 944
(2009). The Court emphasized that an enterprise includes "any group of
individuals associated for a common purpose of engaging in a course of
conduct." Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938, 944 (2009).
Recent district court decisions have continued to apply the Reves test
consistently. In Pabst v. The Peoples Gas Light & Coke Co., 22-CV-01124
(N.D. Ill. Mar 31, 2024), the court stated that "To state a valid RICO claim,
Plaintiffs must allege that Mareno (the new RICO 'person') conducted or
participated in the enterprise's affairs. 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). To satisfy this
requirement, Plaintiffs must meet the 'operation-or-management' test set
forth in Reves, which requires a showing, for substantive RICO violations,
that each defendant conducted or participated in the conduct of the
enterprise's affairs, i.e., in the 'operation or management of the enterprise
itself.'" In another recent case, Hellman v. Cortland Realty Invs., 1:22-
cv-08341 (ALC) (S.D. N.Y. Mar 27, 2024), the court held that a defendant
"must 'have some part in directing' the enterprise's affairs... and 'is liable

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
under RICO if he or she has discretionary authority in carrying out the
instructions of the [enterprise's] principals, or played some part in directing
the affairs of the RICO enterprise.'"
The Fifth Circuit in U.S. v. Cauble, 706 F.2d 1322 (5th Cir. 1983) provided
additional context for determining when a defendant's actions indicate
participation in the enterprise's affairs: "RICO criminalizes the conduct of an
enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity and not merely the
defendant's engaging in racketeering activity. Therefore, there must be a
nexus between the enterprise, the defendant, and the pattern of
racketeering activity." U.S. v. Cauble, 706 F.2d 1322, 1332 (5th Cir. 1983).
Secondary Materials
Secondary sources provide further clarification on the elements of a RICO
claim and the interpretation of the "operation or management" test. Civil
Rico: A Tool of Advocacy (2024) outlines that "To establish a § 1962(c) RICO
claim, the following elements must be proven: • Enterprise: A structured
group of individuals associated for a common purpose. • Pattern of
racketeering activity: At least two acts of racketeering, as specified within
the statute, within 10 years. • Conduct: Directly or indirectly conducting the
enterprise's affairs through racketeering."
Similarly, RICO: A Primer (2022) states that "To prove a violation of Section
1962(c), a plaintiff must prove the following elements: ... The defendant
conducted or participated, either directly or indirectly, in the conduct of the
affairs of the enterprise; and The defendant participated in the affairs of the
enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of
unlawful debt."
The article Reflections on Reves v. Ernst & Young: its meaning and impact
on substantive, accessory, aiding abetting and conspiracy liability under
RICO (1996) emphasizes that "The Court held that just as the 'operation or
management' test is not limited to those with significant control over the
enterprise, 'liability under Section 1962(c) is not limited to upper
management.' The Court pointed out that '[a]n enterprise is 'operated' not
just by upper management but also by lower-rung participants in the
enterprise who are under the direction of upper management.'"
A more recent secondary source, RACKETEER INFLUENCED AND
CORRUPT ORGANIZATIONS (2021), notes that "In Reves v. Ernst & Young,
the Supreme Court held that the nexus between a pattern of racketeering
activity and the enterprise exists only when the defendant participates in the
management or operation of the enterprise. The defendant does not need a
primary responsibility nor a formal position within the enterprise to
participate in its affairs; however, 'some part in directing the enterprise's
affairs is required.'"

Analysis
Application of the Reves "Operation or Management" Test
To determine whether Morgan Michelle Myers, Margie Evonne Wilson, and
Danielle Kenneth Branthoover can be held liable under RICO § 1962(c), we
must apply the "operation or management" test established in Reves v. Ernst
& Young. The key question is whether their roles in preparing, submitting,
and coordinating the use of false documents constitute participation in the
operation or management of the enterprise.
The Supreme Court in Reves established that a defendant must have "some
part in directing the enterprise's affairs" to be held liable under RICO, but
explicitly noted that liability is "not limited to those with primary
responsibility for the enterprise's affairs" and "not limited to those with a
formal position in the enterprise." Reves v. Ernst & Young, 507 U.S. 170, 179
(1993). Furthermore, the Court clarified that an enterprise is operated not
just by upper management but also by "lower rung participants in the
enterprise who are under the direction of upper management." Reves v.
Ernst & Young, 507 U.S. 170, 184 (1993).
The activities described—preparing, submitting, and coordinating the use of
false documents—are substantive activities that directly further the
enterprise's affairs, particularly if the enterprise's pattern of racketeering
activity involves fraud or deception. These are not peripheral activities but
actions that are integral to the operation of the enterprise if its criminal
purpose involves the use of false documents.
In Hellman v. Cortland Realty Invs., 1:22-cv-08341 (ALC) (S.D. N.Y. Mar 27,
2024), the court held that a defendant "is liable under RICO if he or she has
discretionary authority in carrying out the instructions of the [enterprise's]
principals, or played some part in directing the affairs of the RICO
enterprise." The preparation and submission of false documents almost
certainly involves discretionary authority—decisions about what information
to falsify, how to present it, and when and where to submit it. This
discretionary element suggests that Myers, Wilson, and Branthoover were
not merely following explicit instructions but were exercising judgment in
furthering the enterprise's affairs.
The Eighth Circuit in U.S. v. Darden, 70 F.3d 1507 (8th Cir. 1995)
emphasized that enterprises are operated by both upper management and
"lower-rung participants who are under the direction of upper
management." U.S. v. Darden, 70 F.3d 1507, 1543 (8th Cir. 1995). This
supports the proposition that even if Myers, Wilson, and Branthoover were
not in leadership positions within the enterprise, their active roles in
preparing and submitting false documents could still constitute participation
in the operation of the enterprise.
Additionally, Pabst v. The Peoples Gas Light & Coke Co. (N.D. Ill. Mar 29,
2024) notes that "where 'persons associate 'in fact' for criminal purposes
[forming a RICO enterprise], each person' may also be 'held liable under
RICO for his, her or its participation in conducting the affairs of the

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
association-in-fact through a pattern of racketeering activity.'" This supports
the view that all three individuals could be held liable for their roles in the
enterprise's activities.
The Nature of the Activities: Preparing and Submitting
False Documents
The specific activities of preparing, submitting, and coordinating the use of
false documents are particularly significant in determining whether they
constitute participation in the operation or management of the enterprise.
These activities are not passive or ministerial tasks but involve active
decision-making and furthering the core activities of the enterprise.
If the enterprise's pattern of racketeering activity involves fraud, false
statements, or other deceptive practices, then the preparation and
submission of false documents would be central to the enterprise's affairs,
not peripheral. In such cases, individuals responsible for these activities
would be directly participating in the operation of the enterprise.
The Fifth Circuit in U.S. v. Cauble, 706 F.2d 1322 (5th Cir. 1983) emphasized
that "RICO criminalizes the conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of
racketeering activity and not merely the defendant's engaging in
racketeering activity. Therefore, there must be a nexus between the
enterprise, the defendant, and the pattern of racketeering activity." U.S. v.
Cauble, 706 F.2d 1322, 1332 (5th Cir. 1983). In this case, the preparation
and submission of false documents establishes a clear nexus between the
individuals, the enterprise, and the pattern of racketeering activity if these
documents were part of the predicate acts constituting the pattern.
Lower-Rung Participants and RICO Liability
A critical aspect of the Reves test, as interpreted by subsequent courts, is
that liability extends to lower-rung participants who operate under the
direction of upper management. The preparation and submission of false
documents, even if done at the direction of others within the enterprise, can
constitute participation in the operation of the enterprise if these activities
involve discretionary authority or decision-making.
In U.S. v. Diaz, 176 F.3d 52 (2nd Cir. 1999), the court recognized that
liability extends to "lower rung participants in the enterprise who are under
the direction of upper management." U.S. v. Diaz, 176 F.3d 52, 92 (2nd Cir.
1999). This supports the proposition that even if Myers, Wilson, and
Branthoover were not in leadership positions, their active involvement in
preparing and submitting false documents could still make them liable
under RICO.
The article Reflections on Reves v. Ernst & Young (1996) emphasizes that
"The Court held that just as the 'operation or management' test is not
limited to those with significant control over the enterprise, 'liability under
Section 1962(c) is not limited to upper management.'" This further supports
the view that individuals at various levels within the enterprise can be held
liable if they participate in its operation.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
The Coordination Element: A Higher Level of Involvement
The fact that Myers, Wilson, and Branthoover were involved in
"coordinating" the use of false documents suggests a higher level of
involvement that goes beyond mere preparation or submission. Coordination
implies strategic planning, oversight, and direction—activities that align
closely with the management aspect of the "operation or management" test.
As noted in RACKETEER INFLUENCED AND CORRUPT ORGANIZATIONS
(2021), "The defendant does not need a primary responsibility nor a formal
position within the enterprise to participate in its affairs; however, 'some
part in directing the enterprise's affairs is required.'" Coordination activities
strongly suggest a role in directing some aspect of the enterprise's affairs,
which would satisfy the Reves test.
Exceptions and Caveats
Ministerial Actions vs. Discretionary Authority
While the Reves test extends liability to lower-rung participants, there is a
distinction between those who merely perform ministerial tasks under
explicit direction and those who exercise discretionary authority. If Myers,
Wilson, and Branthoover were merely following step-by-step instructions
without any discretion, their activities might not rise to the level of
participation in operation or management.
However, the preparation, submission, and coordination of false documents
typically involve decision-making and discretion, which would support a
finding of participation in operation or management. As illustrated in 
Chapter 4. Elements of Cause of Action, "A defendant whose role in a
racketeering conspiracy does not involve operation or management may be
guilty under § 1962(d) where he knows the general nature of the conspiracy
and that the conspiracy extends beyond his individual role." This suggests
that even if their roles did not meet the operation or management test under
§ 1962(c), they might still be liable under RICO's conspiracy provision.
Degree of Involvement and Decision-Making Authority
The extent of Myers, Wilson, and Branthoover's involvement and their level
of decision-making authority are critical factors in determining whether they
participated in the operation or management of the enterprise. As noted in 
Racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations (1998), "actions involving a
low degree of decision-making may not constitute participation in the affairs
of the enterprise."
If their roles were limited to clerical or administrative tasks with minimal
discretion, this might not satisfy the Reves test. However, if they had
significant responsibility for the content of the false documents, the timing
and manner of their submission, or the coordination of their use, this would
strongly suggest participation in operation or management.

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Knowledge of the Enterprise's Criminal Purpose
Another relevant factor is the knowledge of Myers, Wilson, and Branthoover
regarding the enterprise's criminal purpose. If they were aware that they
were preparing and submitting false documents as part of a pattern of
racketeering activity, this would strengthen the argument that they were
participating in the operation or management of the enterprise.
As discussed in Chapter 4. Elements of Cause of Action, "A defendant whose
role in a racketeering conspiracy does not involve operation or management
may be guilty under § 1962(d) where he knows the general nature of the
conspiracy and that the conspiracy extends beyond his individual role."
Knowledge of the enterprise's criminal purpose, combined with active
involvement in preparing and submitting false documents, would support
liability under RICO.
Conclusion
Based on the provided materials, Morgan Michelle Myers, Margie Evonne
Wilson, and Danielle Kenneth Branthoover's roles in preparing, submitting,
and coordinating the use of false documents likely constitute participation in
the operation or management of the enterprise under the Reves test, making
them potentially liable under RICO § 1962(c).
The Supreme Court in Reves v. Ernst & Young, 507 U.S. 170 (1993)
established that liability under RICO extends to those who have "some part
in directing the enterprise's affairs," which includes not only upper
management but also "lower rung participants in the enterprise who are
under the direction of upper management." The preparation, submission,
and coordination of false documents are activities that involve discretion
and decision-making, going beyond mere ministerial tasks, and directly
contribute to the enterprise's affairs, particularly if the enterprise's pattern
of racketeering activity involves fraud or deception.
Recent district court decisions, such as Hellman v. Cortland Realty Invs.,
1:22-cv-08341 (ALC) (S.D. N.Y. Mar 27, 2024), have confirmed that a
defendant "is liable under RICO if he or she has discretionary authority in
carrying out the instructions of the [enterprise's] principals, or played some
part in directing the affairs of the RICO enterprise."
Furthermore, as emphasized in U.S. v. Darden, 70 F.3d 1507 (8th Cir. 1995),
enterprises are operated by both upper management and "lower-rung
participants who are under the direction of upper management." The active
roles of Myers, Wilson, and Branthoover in preparing, submitting, and
coordinating the use of false documents strongly suggest they had more
than a peripheral role in the enterprise's affairs, especially if these
documents were central to the enterprise's pattern of racketeering activity.
In conclusion, the active roles played by Myers, Wilson, and Branthoover in
preparing, submitting, and coordinating the use of false documents indicate
their participation in the operation or management of the enterprise,

satisfying the requirements for liability under RICO § 1962(c) as established
in Reves v. Ernst & Young and subsequently interpreted by federal courts.

U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
Once we understand the word 'conduct' to require some degree of direction
and the word 'participate' to require some part in that direction, the
meaning of § 1962(c) comes into focus. In order to 'participate, directly or
indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs,' one must have some
part in directing those affairs. Of course, the word 'participate' makes clear
that RICO liability is not limited to those with primary responsibility for the
enterprise's affairs, just as the phrase 'directly or indirectly' makes clear
that RICO liability is not limited to those with a formal position in the
enterprise, but some part in directing the enterprise's affairs is required.
The 'operation or management' test expresses this requirement in a
formulation that is easy to apply.
Summary
The Supreme Court in Reves v. Ernst & Young clarified that for RICO liability
under § 1962(c), an individual must have some part in directing the
enterprise's affairs. This does not require a formal position or primary
responsibility but does require participation in the operation or management
of the enterprise. The active roles of individuals in preparing and submitting
false documents could indicate their participation in the operation or
management of the enterprise, thus supporting the proposition.

Summary
Individuals who conduct or participate in the conduct of an enterprise's
affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity can be held liable. This
supports the proposition that individuals actively involved in preparing and

or management of the enterprise.
United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 101 S.Ct. 2524, 69 L.Ed.2d 246
(1981)
U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
Chapter 96 of Title 18 of the United States Code, entitled Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO), was added to Title 18 by the
Organized Crime Control Act of 1970. Title 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), which is part
of RICO, makes it unlawful 'for any person employed by or associated with
any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or
foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the
conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering
activity or collection of unlawful debt.'
Summary
RICO's application is not limited to legitimate enterprises but includes
criminal organizations as well. This supports the proposition that individuals
involved in preparing and submitting false documents as part of a criminal
enterprise can be held liable under RICO, as their actions constitute
participation in the enterprise's affairs.

U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
RICO makes it 'unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any
enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign
commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of
such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.' 18 U.S.C.
§ 1962(c) (emphasis added). ... In light of these statutory features, we
explained in Turkette that 'an enterprise includes any union or group of
individuals associated in fact' and that RICO reaches 'a group of persons
associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a course of
conduct.' 452 U.S., at 580, 583, 101 S.Ct. 2524. Such an enterprise, we said,

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
'is proved by evidence of an ongoing organization, formal or informal, and by
evidence that the various associates function as a continuing unit.' Id., at
583, 101 S.Ct. 2524.
Summary
RICO's definition of an enterprise includes any group of individuals
associated for a common purpose, and participation in the conduct of the
enterprise's affairs can be direct or indirect. The passage emphasizes that
an enterprise can be informal and that individuals can be part of it if they
function as a continuing unit. This supports the proposition that individuals
who actively prepare and submit false documents are participating in the
operation or management of the enterprise, as they are engaging in a course
of conduct with a common purpose.

Mere involvement in an enterprise's decisions is insufficient unless it
involves actual participation in the operation or management. This supports
the proposition that the active roles of the individuals in preparing and
submitting false documents could indicate their participation in the
operation or management of the enterprise, thus potentially meeting the
RICO liability threshold.
Hellman v. Cortland Realty Invs., 1:22-cv-08341 (ALC) (S.D. N.Y. Mar 27,
2024)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of New York
Extract
A RICO defendant is liable for participation in the 'operation or management
of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity.' Reves v. Ernst &
Young, 507 U.S. 170, 184 (1993). A defendant must 'have some part in
directing' the enterprise's affairs, id. at 179, and 'is liable under RICO if he
or she has discretionary authority in carrying out the instructions of the
[enterprise's] principals, or played some part in directing the affairs of the
RICO enterprise.'
Summary
For a defendant to be held liable under RICO, they must participate in the
operation or management of the enterprise. This includes having some part
in directing the enterprise's affairs or having discretionary authority in
carrying out the instructions of the enterprise's principals. The passage
directly supports the proposition that individuals who play active roles in
preparing and submitting false documents could be seen as participating in
the operation or management of the enterprise, thus meeting the RICO
liability criteria.
U.S. v. Darden, 70 F.3d 1507 (8th Cir. 1995)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Eighth Circuit

=== PAGE 13 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
To 'conduct or participate, directly or indirectly in the conduct of the
enterprise's affairs,' one must participate in the operation or management of
the enterprise itself. An enterprise is operated not just by upper
management. An enterprise is also operated by lower-rung participants who
are under the direction of upper management. ... As the Court in Reves
noted, however, liability under the RICO statute is not limited to the kingpin;
an enterprise is also operated 'by lower-rung participants in the enterprise
who are under the direction of upper management.'
Summary
Participation in the operation or management of an enterprise under RICO is
not limited to those in control or upper management. Lower-rung
participants who perform acts necessary or helpful to the enterprise's
operation can also be held liable if they are under the direction of upper
management. This supports the proposition that individuals involved in
preparing and submitting false documents could be seen as participating in
the operation or management of the enterprise.
U.S. v. Diaz, 176 F.3d 52 (2nd Cir. 1999)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Second Circuit
Extract
In Reves v. Ernst & Young, 507 U.S. 170, 113 S.Ct. 1163, 122 L.Ed.2d 525
(1993), the Supreme Court held that 'to conduct or participate, directly or
indirectly, in the conduct of [an] enterprise's affairs,' [as required by] §
1962(c), one must participate in the operation or management of the
enterprise itself," id. at 185, 113 S.Ct. 1163, and at a minimum must play
'some part in directing the enterprise's affairs,' id. at 179, 113 S.Ct. 1163.
The Court recognized that those who operate or direct a RICO enterprise
sufficient to conduct its affairs are not limited to 'upper management,' but
might also be 'lower rung participants in the enterprise who are under the
direction of upper management.' Id. at 184, 113 S.Ct. 1163.
Summary
Under the Reves test, liability under RICO is not limited to those in upper
management but can extend to lower-level participants who play a role in
directing the enterprise's affairs. This supports the proposition that
individuals who actively prepare and submit false documents could be seen
as participating in the operation or management of the enterprise, even if
they are not in a traditional managerial role.
Pabst v. The Peoples Gas Light & Coke Co.

=== PAGE 14 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
U.S. District Court — Northern District of Illinois
Extract
This is true because “a corporation and an association-in-fact” can “differ
substantially with respect to the ‘person’ element” and where “persons
associate ‘in fact’ for criminal purposes [forming a RICO enterprise], each
person” may also be “held liable under RICO for his, her or its participation
in conducting the affairs of the association-in-fact through a pattern of
racketeering activity.”
Summary
Individuals who associate in fact for criminal purposes can be held liable
under RICO for their participation in conducting the affairs of the
association-in-fact through a pattern of racketeering activity. This supports
the proposition that individuals who actively participate in preparing and
submitting false documents are participating in the operation or
management of the enterprise.
Pabst v. The Peoples Gas Light & Coke Co., 22-CV-01124 (N.D. Ill. Mar 31,
2024)
U.S. District Court — Northern District of Illinois
Extract
To state a valid RICO claim, Plaintiffs must allege that Mareno (the new
RICO “person”) conducted or participated in the enterprise's affairs. 18
U.S.C. § 1962(c). To satisfy this requirement, Plaintiffs must meet the
“operation-or-management” test set forth in Reves, []which requires a
showing, for substantive RICO violations, that each defendant conducted or
participated in the conduct of the enterprise's affairs, i.e., in the “operation
or management of the enterprise itself.”
Summary
To hold someone liable under RICO, it must be shown that they participated
in the operation or management of the enterprise. This aligns with the Reves
v. Ernst & Young decision, which is a key precedent in RICO cases. The
passage supports the proposition by emphasizing the necessity of
demonstrating active participation in the enterprise's affairs, which is
relevant to the roles of Morgan Michelle Myers, Margie Evonne Wilson, and
Danielle Kenneth Branthoover in preparing and submitting false documents.

U.S. District Court — Central District of California

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
To satisfy the conduct element, the defendant 'must have some part in
directing [the] affairs' of the enterprise. See United States v. Fernandez, 388
F.3d 1199, 1228 (9th Cir. 2004) (emphasis added) (quoting Reves v. Ernst &
Young, 507 U.S. 170, 184, 113 S.Ct. 1163, 122 L.Ed.2d 525 (1993) ). 'A
defendant need not be in charge of or have 'significant control over or within
[the] enterprise.'
Summary
Under RICO, a defendant must have some part in directing the affairs of the
enterprise, but it is not necessary for them to have significant control or be
in charge. This aligns with the proposition that the individuals' active roles
in preparing and submitting false documents could be seen as participating
in the operation or management of the enterprise, even if they were not in
charge.
U.S. v. Cauble, 706 F.2d 1322 (5th Cir. 1983)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
RICO criminalizes the conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of
racketeering activity and not merely the defendant's engaging in
racketeering activity. Therefore, there must be a nexus between the
enterprise, the defendant, and the pattern of racketeering activity. The mere
fact that a defendant works for a legitimate enterprise and commits
racketeering acts while on the business premises does not establish that the
affairs of the enterprise have been conducted 'through' a pattern of
racketeering activity.
Summary
For RICO liability, there must be a connection between the enterprise, the
defendant, and the pattern of racketeering activity. This supports the
proposition that individuals who actively participate in preparing and
submitting false documents are engaging in conduct that could be
considered part of the operation or management of the enterprise, thus
meeting the RICO requirement of participation in the enterprise's affairs.

Extract
In Reves v. Ernst & Young, 507 U.S. 170, 184, 113 S.Ct. 1163, 122 L.Ed.2d
525 (1993), the Supreme Court held that liability under § 1962(c), for
substantive violations of the RICO statute, was limited to 'those who
participate in the operation or management of an enterprise through a
pattern of racketeering activity.' After reasoning that '[i]n order to
`participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's
affairs,' one must have some part in directing those affairs,' id. at 179, 113
S.Ct. 1163 (quoting § 1962(c)), the Court cautioned that its adoption of the
'operation or management' test did not mean that liability was limited to
upper management. 'An enterprise is 'operated' not just by upper
management but also by lower rung participants in the enterprise who are
under the direction of upper management.'
Summary
The Supreme Court's decision in Reves v. Ernst & Young established that
RICO liability is not limited to those in upper management but extends to
any participants who have a role in directing the enterprise's affairs. This
includes lower-level participants who are involved in the operation or
management of the enterprise. The passage from U.S. v. Fernandez
reiterates this interpretation, emphasizing that individuals who play active
roles in the enterprise's activities, such as preparing and submitting false
documents, can be held liable under RICO.
18 U.S.C. § 1962 18 U.S.C. § 1962 Prohibited Activities
Extract
It shall be unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any
enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign
commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of
such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity or
collection of unlawful debt.
Summary
The passage from 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) makes it unlawful for any person
associated with an enterprise to participate in the conduct of the
enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity. This aligns
with the proposition that individuals who actively prepare and submit false
documents are participating in the operation or management of the
enterprise, as their actions contribute to the enterprise's racketeering
activities. The statute's broad language encompasses direct or indirect
participation, which supports the argument that the individuals' roles in
document preparation and submission are sufficient for RICO liability.

Chapter 4. Elements of Cause of Action
Civil RICO: A Definitive Guide. Fifth Edition - American Bar
Association - Gregory P. Joseph
Extract
The late Chief Judge Becker of the Third Circuit properly observed that,
when an organizational entity is involved, it is important to bear in mind the
directive of Reves v. Ernst & Young, 507 U.S. 170, 183 (1993), that the
defendant must be involved in the operation and management of the
enterprise... In Reves v. Ernst & Young, 507 U.S. 170, 183 (1993), the
Supreme Court declared that there is no liability under § 1962(c) 'unless one
has participated in the operation or management of the enterprise itself'... A
defendant whose role in a racketeering conspiracy does not involve
operation or management may be guilty under § 1962(d) where he knows
the general nature of the conspiracy and that the conspiracy extends beyond
his individual role.
Summary
The operation-or-management test from Reves v. Ernst & Young is crucial in
determining liability under RICO. The passages emphasize that a defendant
must be involved in the operation or management of the enterprise to be
held liable under § 1962(c). However, under § 1962(d), a defendant may still
be guilty of conspiracy if they are aware of the general nature of the
conspiracy, even if they do not manage or operate the enterprise. This
supports the proposition that the active roles of the individuals in preparing
and submitting false documents could indicate their participation in the
operation or management of the enterprise.

Allison, Bridget - 1998-03-22
Extract
The Supreme Court, in Reves, held that the requisite nexus exists only when
the defendant's predicate acts 'rise to the level' of participation in the
management or operation of the enterprise. Although RICO liability is not
solely laid upon those with primary responsibility for the enterprise's affairs,
to 'conduct or participate' in the affairs of the enterprise, one must play
some role in directing the affairs of the enterprise. Thus, under this test,
actions involving a low degree of decision-making may not constitute
participation in the affairs of the enterprise.

=== PAGE 18 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
RICO liability can extend beyond those with primary responsibility, to
include those who play a role in directing the enterprise's affairs. This
supports the proposition that individuals who actively prepare and submit
false documents could be seen as participating in the operation or
management of the enterprise, thus meeting the Reves standard.

American Criminal Law Review - Georgetown University Law Center -
2021-07-01
Extract
In Reves v. Ernst & Young, the Supreme Court held that the nexus between a
pattern of racketeering activity and the enterprise exists only when the
defendant participates in the management or operation of the enterprise.
The defendant does not need a primary responsibility nor a formal position
within the enterprise to participate in its affairs; however, 'some part in
directing the enterprise’s affairs is required.' ... While acknowledging that
'lower rung' employees who operate the enterprise 'under the direction of
upper management' may be deemed to participate in the enterprise, the
Reves Court explicitly declined to decide how far the operation or
management test extends down the corporate chain of command.
Summary
The Reves decision establishes that participation in the operation or
management of an enterprise does not require a formal position or primary
responsibility. It is sufficient for individuals to have some role in directing
the enterprise's affairs. This supports the proposition that individuals
involved in preparing and submitting false documents could be seen as
participating in the operation or management of the enterprise, thus
meeting the RICO liability criteria.

Extract
The Court held that just as the 'operation or management' test is not limited
to those with significant control over the enterprise, 'liability under Section

'[a]n enterprise is 'operated' not just by upper management but also by

lower-rung participants in the enterprise who are under the direction of
upper management.'
Summary
The "operation or management" test under RICO is not limited to those in
upper management. It extends to lower-rung participants who play roles
under the direction of upper management. This interpretation supports the
proposition that individuals like Morgan Michelle Myers, Margie Evonne
Wilson, and Danielle Kenneth Branthoover, who actively participated in
preparing and submitting false documents, could be seen as participating in
the operation or management of the enterprise.
Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy
The Brief - American Bar Association - 2024-01-01
Extract
A violation of § 1962(c), the section on which Sedima relies, requires (1)
conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity. The plaintiff must allege each of the elements to state a claim. They
are all equally essential components, and the complaint will fail if any one of
them is not adequately pleaded... To establish a § 1962(c) RICO claim, the
following elements must be proven: • Enterprise: A structured group of
individuals associated for a common purpose. • Pattern of racketeering
activity: At least two acts of racketeering, as specified within the statute,
within 10 years. • Conduct: Directly or indirectly conducting the enterprise’s
affairs through racketeering.
Summary
Essential elements required to state a RICO claim, including the need for
conduct that involves directly or indirectly managing the enterprise's affairs
through racketeering. This aligns with the proposition that the individuals'
active roles in preparing and submitting false documents could indicate
their participation in the operation or management of the enterprise.

Summary
For a RICO violation under Section 1962(c), it is necessary to show that the
defendant conducted or participated in the conduct of the enterprise's
affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity. The passage supports the
proposition by indicating that active roles in preparing and submitting false
documents could be seen as participating in the conduct of the enterprise's
affairs, which aligns with the requirements for liability under RICO.
RICO: A Primer
Extract
Under section 1962(c), it is a violation to conduct the affairs of an enterprise
affecting interstate or foreign commerce 'through' a pattern of racketeering
activity or through the alternative theory of collection of an unlawful debt.
To prove a violation of Section 1962(c), a plaintiff must prove the following
elements: * Existence of an enterprise; * The enterprise engaged in, or its
activities affected, interstate or foreign commerce; * The defendant was
employed by or was associated with the enterprise; * The defendant
conducted or participated, either directly or indirectly, in the conduct of the
affairs of the enterprise; and * The defendant participated in the affairs of
the enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of
unlawful debt.
Summary
Elements required to establish a violation under Section 1962(c) of RICO,
which includes the requirement that the defendant conducted or
participated in the conduct of the affairs of the enterprise through a pattern
of racketeering activity. This directly supports the proposition that
individuals who play active roles in preparing and submitting false
documents can be seen as participating in the operation or management of
the enterprise, thus meeting the criteria for liability under RICO.
