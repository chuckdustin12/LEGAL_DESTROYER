Question
The ongoing procedural irregularities and judicial inaction have caused
irreparable harm to the respondent and his children, and have undermined
the fairness of the proceedings. Recusal is required not only to remedy
actual bias but also to restore public confidence in the judiciary and prevent
further harm to the parties (Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co., 556 U.S. 868,
872 (2009)). Recusal of Judge Evans is necessary to restore confidence in
the administration of justice and to prevent further irreparable harm to the
respondent and his family.
Answer (Texas)
Short response
Recusal of Judge Evans is warranted under both Texas and federal law when
ongoing procedural irregularities and judicial inaction have caused
irreparable harm and undermined the fairness of proceedings, as both
actual and apparent bias threaten public confidence in the judiciary. The
authorities provided establish that recusal is necessary not only to remedy
actual bias but also to restore the integrity of the judicial process and
prevent further harm to the parties involved.
Summary
The legal framework in Texas, supported by federal due process principles,
mandates recusal when a judge’s impartiality might reasonably be
questioned or when there is a probability of bias that is constitutionally
intolerable. This standard is objective and is designed to protect both the
actual fairness of proceedings and the public’s perception of judicial
integrity, especially where procedural irregularities and judicial inaction
have caused or risk causing irreparable harm.
Case law from the Texas Supreme Court and the U.S. Supreme Court, as
well as relevant administrative decisions, consistently emphasize that
recusal is essential not only to address actual bias but also to prevent the
appearance of impropriety and to maintain public trust in the judiciary. The
authorities further clarify that recusal is a necessary remedy to prevent
further harm to litigants and to restore confidence in the administration of
justice, particularly in cases where ongoing judicial conduct has undermined
the fairness of the proceedings.

Background and Relevant Law
Legislative and Regulatory Framework
The Texas Constitution provides a mechanism for the removal of district
court judges who are incompetent, guilty of partiality, or fail to perform their
duties, underscoring the importance of judicial impartiality and the need for
remedies when a judge’s conduct undermines the administration of justice
(Tex. Const. art. 15 § 6). While removal is a severe remedy, the constitutional
provision reflects the broader principle that judicial misconduct, including
partiality and inaction, must be addressed to maintain the legitimacy of the
courts.
Procedurally, Texas law sets out the grounds and process for recusal in Rule
18b of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, which is incorporated by
reference in administrative regulations (1 Tex. Admin. Code § 155.152). Rule
18b requires recusal when a judge’s impartiality might reasonably be
questioned or when the judge has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a
party or the subject matter. The process ensures that if a judge does not
voluntarily recuse, another judge is assigned to rule on the motion, and, if
recusal is found warranted, a new presiding judge is appointed.
Case Law
The Texas Supreme Court has repeatedly affirmed the imperative and
objective nature of the recusal standard. In Rogers v. Bradley, 909 S.W.2d
872 (Tex. 1995), the court held that a judge must recuse if their impartiality
might reasonably be questioned, emphasizing that the standard is not
subjective but based on whether a reasonable person, aware of all
circumstances, would doubt the judge’s impartiality. This principle is echoed
in Hensley v. St. Comm'n on Jud. Conduct, 692 S.W.3d 184 (Tex. 2024),
which also cites the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Caperton v. A.T.
Massey Coal Co., 556 U.S. 868 (2009), establishing a federal due process
right to recusal when the probability of actual bias is too high to be
constitutionally tolerable.
The Texas Supreme Court has further articulated the foundational role of
public confidence in the judiciary. In Sun Exploration and Production Co. v.
Jackson, 783 S.W.2d 202 (Tex. 1989), the court stated that the legitimacy of
the judicial process depends on public respect and confidence in the
system’s impartiality and fairness. Judicial decisions rendered under
circumstances suggesting bias or favoritism undermine the integrity of the
courts and erode public trust.
The court in Thoma, In re, 873 S.W.2d 477 (Tex. 1994) reinforced that judges
must observe high standards of conduct to preserve the integrity and
independence of the judiciary, and must act in ways that promote public
confidence in their impartiality.

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Administrative Decisions
Administrative decisions reinforce these principles. In Baker v. Soc. Sec.
Admin., 080422 MSPB, CH-1221-17-0318-W-1, the court found that denying
relief in the face of judicial impropriety risks injustice in other cases and
undermines public confidence in the judicial process. The decision
emphasized that the appearance of impropriety is itself a sufficient ground
for recusal, as it is precisely what the recusal statutes are intended to
prevent.
Secondary Materials
Secondary materials support the view that recusal is a necessary remedy to
address both actual and perceived bias, and to restore public confidence in
the judiciary. They highlight that even the appearance of bias or impropriety
can undermine the legitimacy of the courts and the fairness of proceedings.
Analysis
Objective Standard for Recusal
The legal standard for recusal in Texas is objective: a judge must step aside
if their impartiality might reasonably be questioned, regardless of their own
subjective belief in their ability to be fair (Rogers v. Bradley, 909 S.W.2d 872
(Tex. 1995)). This standard is designed to protect not only the actual fairness
of proceedings but also the public’s perception of fairness, which is essential
for maintaining confidence in the judicial system (Sun Exploration and
Production Co. v. Jackson, 783 S.W.2d 202 (Tex. 1989)).
The U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co., 556
U.S. 868 (2009)—explicitly cited in the user’s proposition and referenced in
Texas Supreme Court decisions—establishes that due process may require
recusal even in the absence of proven actual bias, if the probability of bias is
too high to be constitutionally tolerable. This principle has been reaffirmed
in subsequent cases, including Rippo v. Baker, 580 U.S. ___, 137 S.Ct. 905
(2017), and is reflected in Texas law and practice (Hensley v. St. Comm'n on
Jud. Conduct, 692 S.W.3d 184 (Tex. 2024); Pretrial Motions (2021-08-16)).
Procedural Irregularities and Judicial Inaction
Where there are ongoing procedural irregularities and judicial inaction that
have caused irreparable harm to a party and their family, the fairness of the
proceedings is called into question. Texas law and federal due process
principles both recognize that such circumstances can create an appearance
of impropriety or bias, even if actual bias is not established (Pretrial Motions
(2020-08-16); Baker v. Soc. Sec. Admin., 080422 MSPB, CH-1221-17-0318-
W-1). The risk of further harm to the parties, coupled with the undermining
of public confidence in the judiciary, makes recusal not only appropriate but
necessary to restore the integrity of the process.

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
The Texas Supreme Court has made clear that the judiciary must avoid even
the appearance of impropriety, as public trust is easily eroded by
perceptions of bias or unfairness (Sun Exploration and Production Co. v.
Jackson, 783 S.W.2d 202 (Tex. 1989)). This is particularly important in cases
involving families and children, where the stakes are high and the
consequences of judicial inaction or irregularity can be severe and lasting.
Restoration of Public Confidence
Recusal serves not only to remedy actual bias but also to restore public
confidence in the administration of justice. The Texas Supreme Court has
repeatedly emphasized that the legitimacy of the courts depends on public
perception of their fairness and impartiality (Thoma, In re, 873 S.W.2d 477
(Tex. 1994); In re Rose, 144 S.W.3d 661 (Tex. 2004)). Disciplinary and
recusal procedures are designed to reassure the public that judicial
misconduct or the appearance of bias will not be tolerated.
Administrative decisions further support this view, noting that providing
relief in cases of judicial impropriety can prevent future injustices and
encourage judges to recuse themselves promptly when grounds for
disqualification arise (Baker v. Soc. Sec. Admin., 080422 MSPB,
CH-1221-17-0318-W-1). The appearance-based standard for recusal is
critical: if a reasonable, fully informed observer would doubt the judge’s
impartiality, recusal is required to maintain the legitimacy of the process
(Judicial Disqualification and Legitimacy (2023-07-01)).
Due Process and Irreparable Harm
The Due Process Clause of the U.S. Constitution sometimes demands recusal
even in the absence of actual bias, particularly when the probability of bias
is too high to be constitutionally acceptable (Pretrial Motions (2021-08-16); 
Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co., 556 U.S. 868 (2009)). This is especially
true where procedural irregularities and judicial inaction have caused or
risk causing irreparable harm to the parties, as due process requires not
only the absence of actual bias but also the absence of circumstances that
would lead a reasonable person to question the fairness of the proceedings.
The Texas Supreme Court has recognized that certain judicial actions, such
as the imposition of gag orders, require specific findings of imminent and
irreparable harm to the judicial process (Davenport v. Garcia, 834 S.W.2d 4
(Tex. 1992)). Although this case was later declined to be extended in In re
Houston Chronicle Pub. Co., 64 S.W.3d 103 (Tex. App. 2001), the principle
that irreparable harm to the fairness of proceedings justifies judicial
intervention remains relevant, particularly in the context of recusal.
Compliance with Recusal Procedures
Judges are required to comply with established procedures for recusal, as
set out in the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure and the Code of Judicial
Conduct (In re Inquiry Concerning Honorable Bonnie Rangel CJC No., 677
S.W.3d 918 (Tex. 2023)). Failure to follow these procedures can itself

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
undermine public confidence and may be grounds for disciplinary action.
The process ensures that motions for recusal are considered by a neutral
judge and that, if recusal is warranted, a new presiding judge is appointed
to restore fairness to the proceedings (1 Tex. Admin. Code § 155.152).
Exceptions and Caveats
While the authorities overwhelmingly support recusal where impartiality is
reasonably questioned or where procedural irregularities have caused
irreparable harm, it is important to note that not every procedural misstep
or delay will justify recusal. The standard remains whether a reasonable
person, fully informed of the circumstances, would doubt the judge’s
impartiality (Rogers v. Bradley, 909 S.W.2d 872 (Tex. 1995)). Additionally, the
Texas Supreme Court’s decision in Davenport v. Garcia, 834 S.W.2d 4 (Tex.
1992)—which discusses the need for specific findings of irreparable harm—
was later declined to be extended in In re Houston Chronicle Pub. Co., 64
S.W.3d 103 (Tex. App. 2001). This limits its application, but the underlying
principle that irreparable harm to the fairness of proceedings justifies
judicial intervention remains persuasive in the context of recusal.
Conclusion
In summary, the legal authorities provided establish that recusal is required
not only to remedy actual bias but also to address the appearance of
impropriety and to restore public confidence in the judiciary, particularly
where ongoing procedural irregularities and judicial inaction have caused or
risk causing irreparable harm to the parties. The objective standard for
recusal, grounded in both Texas law and federal due process principles,
mandates that a judge must step aside whenever their impartiality might
reasonably be questioned. This is essential to maintain the integrity of the
judicial process, prevent further harm to the parties, and uphold the
legitimacy of the courts. Recusal of Judge Evans is therefore necessary to
restore confidence in the administration of justice and to prevent further
irreparable harm to the respondent and his family.

Summary
The passage from "Rogers v. Bradley" emphasizes that under Texas Rule of
Civil Procedure 18b(2)(a), a judge must recuse themselves if their
impartiality might reasonably be questioned. This is an objective standard,
meaning it does not depend on the judge's personal feelings but rather on
whether a reasonable person would doubt the judge's impartiality. This
aligns with the proposition that recusal is necessary to restore public
confidence in the judiciary and prevent further harm, as it underscores the
importance of maintaining impartiality and public trust in judicial
proceedings.

Summary
The passage from "Hensley v. St. Comm'n on Jud. Conduct" discusses the
conditions under which a judge must recuse themselves, specifically when
their impartiality might reasonably be questioned or when there is a
personal bias. It also references the Caperton case, which establishes a
federal due process right to recusal when the probability of actual bias is too
high. This supports the proposition that recusal is necessary to address
actual bias and restore public confidence in the judiciary, as well as to
prevent further harm to the parties involved.

Summary
The passage from Davenport v. Garcia emphasizes the necessity of
demonstrating imminent and irreparable harm to the judicial process to
justify certain judicial actions, such as gag orders. This aligns with the
proposition that procedural irregularities and judicial inaction causing
irreparable harm can undermine the fairness of proceedings. The
requirement for specific findings of harm supports the argument for recusal
to restore fairness and public confidence.
In re Rose, 144 S.W.3d 661 (Tex. 2004)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
The purpose of sanctions in cases of judicial discipline is to preserve the
integrity and independence of the judiciary and to restore and reaffirm
public confidence in the administration of justice. The discipline we impose
must be designed to announce publicly our recognition that there has been
misconduct; it must be sufficient to deter respondent from engaging in such
conduct; and it must discourage others from engaging in similar conduct in
the future. Thus, we discipline a judge not for purposes of vengeance or
retribution, but to instruct the public and all judges, ourselves included, of
the importance of the function performed by judges in a free society. We
discipline a judge to reassure the public that judicial misconduct is neither
permitted nor condoned.
Summary
The Texas Supreme Court emphasizes the importance of maintaining public
confidence in the judiciary by disciplining judges who engage in misconduct.
This aligns with the proposition that recusal is necessary to restore public
confidence and prevent further harm, as it highlights the judiciary's role in
ensuring fairness and integrity in legal proceedings.

litigant attempts to recuse a trial judge. Those procedures appear in Rule
18a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. And, the subpart in play is that
stating: '[t]he judge whose recusal or disqualification is sought should not
file a response to the motion.' TEX. R. CIV. PROC. 18a(c)(2). No one disputes
that Judge Rangel filed a response. She admitted as much and explained she
'was not aware of that' provision.

high to be constitutionally tolerable. Rippo v. Baker, 580 U.S. ___, 137 S.Ct.
905, 907, 197 L.Ed.2d 167 (2017).
Summary
The passage highlights that recusal is necessary not only in cases of actual
bias but also when the probability of bias is too high to be constitutionally
acceptable. This aligns with the proposition that recusal is needed to restore
public confidence and prevent further harm, even if actual bias is not
proven. The reference to the Due Process Clause and the case of Rippo v.
Baker supports the argument that procedural fairness and public confidence
are critical considerations in recusal decisions.

Extract
For the second factor, the risk that denying relief would cause injustice in
other cases, the Court found that providing relief may prevent injustices in
future cases by encouraging judges to promptly recuse themselves when
grounds for disqualification arise. In a discussion that implicated the third
factor, the risk of undermining public confidence in the judicial process, the
Court found that the facts at hand created 'precisely the kind of appearance
of impropriety that § 455(a) was intended to prevent. The violation [was]
neither insubstantial nor excusable.' The Supreme Court therefore affirmed
the decision to vacate the original judgment.
