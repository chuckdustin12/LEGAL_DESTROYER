Question
Plaintiff’s allegations describe a scheme with multiple steps, ongoing
coordination, and repeated acts over an extended period, not a single,
isolated event. While courts are skeptical of RICO claims based on a single
scheme with a single victim and a discrete goal, the Supreme Court and
Tenth Circuit have not adopted a categorical rule barring such claims. The
key inquiry is whether the acts, as alleged, amount to or pose a threat of
continued criminal activity. (See H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 241-42; Resolution
Trust Corp. v. Stone, 998 F.2d 1534, 1543 (10th Cir. 1993)). The district
court erred by treating the "single scheme" doctrine as dispositive, rather
than considering whether the facts as alleged could plausibly support a
finding of continuity, especially given the ongoing nature of the alleged
conduct and the repeated use of interstate facilities to further the scheme.
Answer (Tenth Circuit)
Short response
The Supreme Court and Tenth Circuit have expressly rejected a categorical
bar on RICO claims based solely on the presence of a single scheme or
single victim; instead, the central inquiry is whether the alleged acts
demonstrate or threaten continued criminal activity. The district court erred
by treating the "single scheme" doctrine as dispositive, rather than
evaluating whether the facts plausibly support a finding of continuity under
the standards articulated in H.J. Inc. and Tenth Circuit precedent.
Summary
Courts in the Tenth Circuit, following Supreme Court guidance, have
consistently held that the existence of a single scheme, even with a single
victim and a discrete goal, does not automatically preclude a RICO claim.
The key legal test is whether the alleged conduct amounts to or poses a
threat of continued racketeering activity, assessed through the concepts of
"closed-ended" and "open-ended" continuity.
The district court's reliance on the "single scheme" doctrine as a dispositive
bar was misplaced. Instead, courts must examine the duration,
extensiveness, and nature of the alleged conduct to determine if it plausibly
supports a finding of continuity—especially where the scheme involves
multiple steps, ongoing coordination, and repeated acts over time. The
authorities make clear that continuity, not the number of schemes or victims,
is the controlling inquiry.

Background and Relevant Law
Statutory Framework
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C.
§§ 1961–1968, requires a plaintiff to allege (1) conduct, (2) of an enterprise,
(3) through a pattern, (4) of racketeering activity. The statute defines a
"pattern of racketeering activity" as requiring at least two acts of
racketeering activity within ten years, but courts have interpreted this to
require more than just two isolated acts; there must be "continuity plus
relationship" among the acts, and a threat of ongoing criminal activity
(Bixler v. Foster, 596 F.3d 751, 761 (10th Cir. 2010); 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5)).
Supreme Court Precedent
The Supreme Court in H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co., 492 U.S.
229 (1989), clarified that RICO does not require multiple schemes, multiple
victims, or multiple goals. Instead, the focus is on whether the predicate
acts are related and whether they amount to or pose a threat of continued
criminal activity. The Court rejected the Eighth Circuit’s rigid "multiple
schemes" test, emphasizing a flexible approach centered on continuity—
either "closed-ended" (a series of related acts over a substantial period) or
"open-ended" (conduct that by its nature projects into the future with a
threat of repetition).
Tenth Circuit Precedent
The Tenth Circuit has repeatedly followed the Supreme Court’s guidance,
holding that the existence of a single scheme or single victim does not
categorically bar a RICO claim. Instead, the court must assess whether the
alleged acts demonstrate continuity, considering factors such as the
duration, extensiveness, and nature of the scheme (Resolution Trust Corp. v.
Stone, 998 F.2d 1534, 1543 (10th Cir. 1993); Johnson v. Heath, 56 F.4th 851,
860 (10th Cir. 2022); Phelps v. Wichita Eagle-Beacon, 886 F.2d 1262, 1273
(10th Cir. 1989)).
Case Law
Supreme Court: H.J. Inc.
In H.J. Inc., the Supreme Court held that a RICO pattern requires both
relationship and continuity. The Court explicitly rejected a rule that would
require multiple schemes or victims, stating that continuity is a flexible
concept that can be satisfied by either a closed period of repeated conduct
or by conduct that threatens future repetition. The Court emphasized that
the focus should be on whether the acts, as alleged, amount to or pose a
threat of continued criminal activity, not on the number of schemes or
victims involved.

Tenth Circuit: Resolution Trust Corp. v. Stone and Progeny
The Tenth Circuit in Resolution Trust Corp. v. Stone, 998 F.2d 1534 (10th
Cir. 1993), adopted the Supreme Court’s approach, holding that continuity
can be shown by a series of related predicate acts over a substantial period
(closed-ended continuity) or by acts that threaten future repetition (open-
ended continuity). The court further explained that the complexity, size, and
ongoing management of a scheme are relevant to the continuity analysis.
Subsequent Tenth Circuit cases have reinforced this approach:
Johnson v. Heath, 56 F.4th 851 (10th Cir. 2022): The court held that the
existence of a single scheme does not preclude a finding of closed-
ended continuity if the conduct reflects a regular way of conducting
business and involves repeated acts over time.
Bixler v. Foster, 596 F.3d 751 (10th Cir. 2010): The court reiterated that
continuity is both a closed- and open-ended concept, and that the key
inquiry is whether the acts amount to or threaten long-term criminal
activity.
Tal v. Hogan, 453 F.3d 1244 (10th Cir. 2006): The court emphasized
that two predicate acts are not sufficient unless they are related and
pose a threat of continued criminal activity, and that the duration and
extensiveness of the scheme are critical factors.
Phelps v. Wichita Eagle-Beacon, 886 F.2d 1262 (10th Cir. 1989): The
court confirmed that a RICO violation does not require more than one
scheme, and the central question is whether the acts are continuous.
Other Tenth Circuit cases, such as Edwards v. First Nat. Bank, Bartlesville,
Oklahoma, 872 F.2d 347 (10th Cir. 1989) and Torwest DBC, Inc. v. Dick, 810
F.2d 925 (10th Cir. 1987), have recognized that a single scheme involving
one victim can satisfy the continuity requirement if the scheme is open-
ended or ongoing.
District Court and Supplementary Authority
District courts within the Tenth Circuit have consistently applied these
principles, refusing to treat the "single scheme" doctrine as dispositive. For
example, in Suddath v. Oklahome Homebuilders, LLC, CIV-24-745-SLP (W.D.
Okla. Nov 08, 2024), the court emphasized that the pattern requirement is
met if the predicate acts amount to or threaten long-term criminal activity,
and that continuity can be shown through either a closed period of repeated
conduct or conduct that threatens future repetition.
Similarly, in Skurkey v. Daniel, the court noted that no single factor is
dispositive in determining continuity, and that courts should consider the
number of victims, number and variety of acts, distinctiveness of injuries,
and complexity and size of the scheme.

Analysis
The "Single Scheme" Doctrine Is Not Dispositive
The Supreme Court and Tenth Circuit have made clear that the mere
presence of a single scheme, single victim, or discrete goal does not
automatically defeat a RICO claim. The Supreme Court in H.J. Inc. explicitly
rejected the Eighth Circuit’s "multiple schemes" test, holding that continuity
is the controlling inquiry. The Tenth Circuit has followed this approach,
repeatedly stating that a single scheme can suffice if it demonstrates the
requisite continuity (Resolution Trust Corp. v. Stone, 998 F.2d 1534 (10th
Cir. 1993); Johnson v. Heath, 56 F.4th 851 (10th Cir. 2022); Phelps v. Wichita
Eagle-Beacon, 886 F.2d 1262 (10th Cir. 1989)).
Secondary materials confirm this interpretation, noting that the Supreme
Court and all nine Justices in H.J. Inc. agreed that a single scheme can
support a RICO claim if the continuity requirement is met (The resurrection
of the 'single scheme' exclusion to RICO's pattern requirement; Rico and the
Prime: Taking a Bite Out of Crime?).
Continuity: The Central Inquiry
The continuity requirement is satisfied in two ways:
Closed-Ended Continuity: This is shown by a series of related
predicate acts extending over a substantial period. Courts look at the
duration of the conduct, the number and variety of acts, the number of
victims, the complexity and size of the scheme, and whether the acts
are distinct or repetitive (Resolution Trust Corp. v. Stone, 998 F.2d
1534 (10th Cir. 1993); Skurkey v. Daniel; RICO: A Primer).
Open-Ended Continuity: This is present where the conduct, by its
nature, projects into the future with a threat of repetition. This can be
shown if the acts are part of the defendant’s regular way of conducting
business, or if the scheme is ongoing and does not have a single, finite
goal (H.J. Inc.; Johnson v. Heath, 56 F.4th 851 (10th Cir. 2022); Edwards
v. First Nat. Bank, Bartlesville, Oklahoma, 872 F.2d 347 (10th Cir.
1989)).
The Tenth Circuit has emphasized that continuity is a fact-specific inquiry,
and courts must consider the totality of the circumstances, including the
duration and extensiveness of the scheme (U.S. v. Smith, 413 F.3d 1253
(10th Cir. 2005); Tal v. Hogan, 453 F.3d 1244 (10th Cir. 2006)). Notably, U.S.
v. Smith has been stated as overruled by a later case, but the principle that
continuity is a fact-specific inquiry remains consistent with Supreme Court
and other Tenth Circuit authority.
Application to the Alleged Facts
Where a plaintiff alleges a scheme with multiple steps, ongoing
coordination, and repeated acts over an extended period, these facts are
1. 
2. 

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
highly relevant to the continuity analysis. Courts must assess whether the
alleged conduct amounts to or poses a threat of continued criminal activity,
considering the duration, complexity, and ongoing nature of the scheme
(Resolution Trust Corp. v. Stone, 998 F.2d 1534 (10th Cir. 1993); Skurkey v.
Daniel; Suddath v. Oklahome Homebuilders, LLC, CIV-24-745-SLP (W.D.
Okla. Nov 08, 2024)).
If the scheme involves repeated use of interstate facilities, ongoing
management, and multiple predicate acts over time, these factors weigh in
favor of finding continuity. The presence of a single scheme or victim does
not negate the possibility of continuity if the conduct is ongoing or threatens
future repetition (Johnson v. Heath, 56 F.4th 851 (10th Cir. 2022); Tal v.
Hogan, 453 F.3d 1244 (10th Cir. 2006)).
District Court Error
The district court erred by treating the "single scheme" doctrine as
dispositive. Both Supreme Court and Tenth Circuit precedent require courts
to examine the facts as alleged to determine whether they plausibly support
a finding of continuity. Dismissing a RICO claim solely because it involves a
single scheme or victim is contrary to controlling authority (H.J. Inc.; 
Resolution Trust Corp. v. Stone, 998 F.2d 1534 (10th Cir. 1993); Phelps v.
Wichita Eagle-Beacon, 886 F.2d 1262 (10th Cir. 1989)).
Exceptions and Caveats
While the presence of a single scheme or victim does not categorically bar a
RICO claim, courts remain skeptical of RICO claims where the scheme is
short-lived, involves only a few acts, or has a single, discrete objective that,
once achieved, ends the conduct (Pitts v. Turner and Boisseau Chartered,
850 F.2d 650 (10th Cir. 1988); Condict v. Condict, 826 F.2d 923 (10th Cir.
1987)). In such cases, courts require additional evidence that the scheme
was not an isolated occurrence and that there is a threat of ongoing criminal
activity.
It is also important to note that Condict v. Condict, 815 F.2d 579 (10th Cir.
1987) has been stated as superseded by a later New Mexico Supreme Court
case, but the general principle that continuity requires more than a single,
isolated act remains consistent with Supreme Court and Tenth Circuit
authority.
Conclusion
The Supreme Court and Tenth Circuit have unequivocally held that the
existence of a single scheme, single victim, or discrete goal does not
automatically preclude a RICO claim. The central inquiry is whether the
alleged acts amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity,
assessed through the concepts of closed-ended and open-ended continuity.
The district court erred by treating the "single scheme" doctrine as
dispositive; instead, it should have evaluated whether the facts as alleged
plausibly support a finding of continuity, especially given the ongoing nature

and repeated acts described in the complaint. Courts must conduct a fact-
specific analysis, considering the duration, extensiveness, and nature of the
alleged conduct, in line with Supreme Court and Tenth Circuit precedent.

U.S. District Court — District of New Mexico
Extract
To serve as a basis for a RICO claim, the predicate acts identified in a
complaint must provide a reasonable basis to conclude that the members of
the alleged enterprise will continue to engage in criminal activity. See
Jacksonville v. Bellsouth Telecomm., 372 F.3d 1250, 1265 (11th Cir.2004)
(threat of ongoing criminal activity is “crucial to a valid RICO claim in order
to ensure that the crime alleged is the sort of offense that RICO is designed
to address....”). To establish this element, a plaintiff must either allege that
the defendants engaged in a pattern of criminal activity over a substantial
period of time, such that it would be reasonable to assume that such conduct
would continue, or set forth specific facts that would support the conclusion
that the defendants are likely to engage in future criminal activity.
Summary
The passage emphasizes the importance of demonstrating a threat of
ongoing criminal activity to support a RICO claim. It aligns with the
proposition by highlighting that the key inquiry is whether the acts, as
alleged, amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity. This
supports the argument that the district court should not have treated the
"single scheme" doctrine as dispositive without considering the potential for
continuity in the alleged conduct.

U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
In any event, the existence of a single scheme would not preclude closed-
ended continuity. The issue of continuity focuses on whether the predicate
acts constitute 'a regular way of conducting defendant's ongoing legitimate
business.' H.J. Inc. v. Nw. Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 243, 109 S.Ct. 2893,
106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989). So even when the predicate acts 'arise under a
single scheme,' closed-ended continuity may exist when the conduct reflects
a regular way of conducting business. Menasco, Inc. v. Wasserman, 886 F.2d
681, 684 (4th Cir. 1989). And the third amended complaint alleges 'a years-
long pattern' of fraudulent business practices at both the gas station and tire

shop. Appellant's App'x vol. 1, at 51. That pattern could reflect closed-ended
continuity even if Mr. Heath had used only a single fraudulent scheme.
Summary
The existence of a single scheme does not automatically preclude a finding
of closed-ended continuity. It emphasizes that the focus should be on
whether the predicate acts reflect a regular way of conducting business,
which aligns with the proposition that the key inquiry is whether the acts
amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity. The passage also
references the Supreme Court's decision in H.J. Inc., supporting the idea
that a single scheme can still meet the continuity requirement if it reflects
ongoing business practices.

U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
Only the continuity prong of the pattern element is at issue in this case.
'Continuity' is both a closed- and open-ended concept: closed-ended
referring to a closed period of repeated conduct and open-ended referring to
conduct that by its nature projects into the future with a threat of
repetition. ... A party alleging a RICO violation may demonstrate continuity
over a closed period by proving a series of related predicates extending over
a substantial period of time. ... The complexity and size of the scheme also
favors a finding of continuity. The scheme involved the participation of
several perpetrators--PIIGI, PAC, and the IBG defendants. It involved
extensive planning and ongoing management to juggle incoming investor
premiums for the EARs while paying out enough interest to keep the scheme
afloat. ... Overall, through this scheme, PAC sold approximately $100 million
in EARs with feature similar to those bought by Standard Federal. The
complexity and sheer magnitude of the scheme therefore favors a finding of
continuity.
Summary
Concept of "continuity" in RICO cases, emphasizing that continuity can be
demonstrated through a series of related predicates over a substantial
period. It highlights that the complexity, size, and ongoing nature of a
scheme can support a finding of continuity, which aligns with the proposition
that a single scheme with multiple steps and ongoing coordination can meet
the RICO pattern requirement.

Predicate acts must also 'amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal
activity' in order to establish a pattern of racketeering activity. H.J., 492 U.S.
at 239, 109 S.Ct. 2893. 'Continuity' is both a closed—and open-ended

look to two especially relevant factors when performing continuity analyses.
Resolution Trust Corp. v. Stone, 998 F.2d 1534, 1543 (10th Cir.1993). First,
'we consider the duration of the related predicate acts.' Id. Related
predicate acts that span only a few weeks or months, and that do not pose a
future threat of criminal conduct, do not meet this test. H.J., 492 U.S. at 242,
109 S.Ct. 2893. Second, we consider 'the extensiveness of the RICO
enterprise's scheme.' Resolution Trust Corp., 998 F.2d at 1543.
Summary
The Tenth Circuit considers both closed and open-ended continuity in
determining a pattern of racketeering activity. The court emphasizes that
continuity can be established through various means and is dependent on
the specific facts of each case. The passage also highlights the importance of
considering the duration and extensiveness of the scheme, aligning with the
proposition that a single scheme with ongoing coordination and repeated
acts can support a RICO claim if it demonstrates continuity.

A RICO claim 'must allege a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1962, which consists of
four elements: (1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of
racketeering activity.' Gillmor, 490 F.3d at 797 (quotation omitted). A
'pattern' requires at least two predicate acts. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5). In
addition, '[t]o satisfy RICO's pattern requirement, [a plaintiff must] allege
not only that the defendants had committed two or more predicate acts, but
also that the predicates themselves amount to, or that they otherwise
constitute a threat of, continuing racketeering activity.' Hall v. Witteman,

Summary
"continuity" can be shown through either a closed period of repeated
conduct or conduct that poses a threat of future repetition. This aligns with
the proposition that the key inquiry is whether the acts amount to or pose a
threat of continued criminal activity, rather than being dismissed solely
based on the "single scheme" doctrine.

Extract
Since the district court's ruling on the defendants' motion for summary
judgment in Sil-Flo I, the Supreme Court has further defined what conduct
constitutes a pattern of racketeering activity. See H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern
Bell Tel. Co., --- U.S. ----, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989). In that
case, the Court held that a RICO violation does not necessarily require more
than one scheme, although conduct involving multiple schemes will likely be
more probative. Id. at 2901; see also Phelps v. Wichita Eagle-Beacon, 886 F.
2d 1262, 1273 (10th Cir.1989). Instead, the Court focused on two
requirements: continuity and relationship. H.J. Inc., 109 S.Ct. at 2900.
Summary
The passage references the Supreme Court's decision in H.J. Inc., which
clarifies that a RICO violation does not necessarily require multiple
schemes. Instead, the focus is on continuity and relationship, which aligns
with the proposition that the key inquiry is whether the acts amount to or
pose a threat of continued criminal activity. This supports the idea that a
single scheme can suffice if it demonstrates continuity, thus challenging the
district court's reliance on the "single scheme" doctrine as dispositive.

As a final point, we question whether Plaintiffs' allegations of predicate acts
satisfied the requirement of 'a pattern of racketeering activity.' A 'pattern' of
racketeering is defined as 'at least two acts of racketeering activity,... which
occurred within ten years' of each other. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5). However,
because 'RICO is not aimed at the isolated offender,' Resolution Trust Corp.,

998 F.2d at 1544, proof of two or more predicate acts are not sufficient to
prove a pattern unless there is a relationship between the predicate acts and
a threat of continuing activity. H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492
U.S. 229, 239, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989); Duran v. Carris, 238
F.3d 1268, 1271 (10th Cir.2001). Continuity of threat requires both proof of
'a series of related predicates extending over a substantial period of time,'
as well as a 'showing that the predicates themselves involve a distinct threat
of long-term racketeering activity... or that the predicates are a regular way
of conducting the defendant's ongoing legitimate business or the RICO
enterprise.' Resolution Trust Corp., 998 F.2d at 1543. To determine
continuity we examine both the duration of the related predicate acts and
the extensiveness of the RICO enterprise's scheme.
Summary
Requirement for a "pattern of racketeering activity" under RICO,
emphasizing that it is not enough to simply allege two predicate acts.
Instead, there must be a relationship between the acts and a threat of
continued criminal activity. This aligns with the proposition that the key
inquiry is whether the acts pose a threat of continued criminal activity,
rather than being a single, isolated event. The passage also references the
need for a series of related predicates over a substantial period, supporting
the idea of ongoing coordination and repeated acts.

U.S. District Court — District of Utah
Extract
To form a 'pattern,' the commission of predicate acts or episodes of
criminality must be sufficiently continuous and interrelated. That is, a RICO
or RICE 'pattern' requires planned, ongoing, continuing crime and the threat
of continuing criminal conduct, as opposed to sporadic, isolated criminal
episodes or events. ... As Sedima suggests, the reality and threat of
recurring interrelated criminal acts by the defendant are essential to
establish that the defendant carried on a 'pattern of racketeering activity.'
Otherwise, the continuity and relationship implicit in the concept of 'pattern'
would be meaningless.
Summary
The passage emphasizes the necessity of demonstrating a pattern of
racketeering activity that is continuous and interrelated, rather than
isolated or sporadic. This aligns with the proposition that a single scheme
with ongoing coordination and repeated acts over time can meet the RICO
pattern requirement if it poses a threat of continued criminal activity. The
passage supports the idea that the district court should not have dismissed
the claim based solely on the "single scheme" doctrine without considering
the continuity and threat of ongoing criminal conduct.

U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
A violation of section 1962(c) thus 'requires (1) conduct (2) of an enterprise
(3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity.' Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex
Co., 473 U.S. 479, 105 S.Ct. 3275, 3285, 87 L.Ed.2d 346 (1985). RICO
defines racketeering activity as, inter alia, any act that is indictable under
18 U.S.C. Sec. 1341 (mail fraud) or 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1343 (wire fraud). See 18
U.S.C. Sec. 1961(1)(B). RICO also states that a ' "pattern of racketeering
activity" requires at least two acts of racketeering activity.' 18 U.S.C. Sec.
1961(5). ... [T]o establish a RICO pattern, a plaintiff must also demonstrate
continuity, that is, 'the threat of continuing activity.' Sedima, 105 S.Ct. at
3285 n. 14. This element is derived from RICO's legislative history, which
indicates that RICO does not apply to 'sporadic activity' or to the 'isolated
offender'. Id. The continuity requirement has been the source of
considerable difficulty. Courts generally agree that to make an adequate
showing of continuity under Sedima, a plaintiff must demonstrate some facts
from which at least a threat of ongoing illegal conduct may be inferred. A
scheme to achieve a single discrete objective does not in and of itself create
a threat of ongoing activity, even when that goal is pursued by multiple
illegal acts, because the scheme ends when the purpose is accomplished.
Summary
A single scheme with a discrete objective does not automatically imply
continuity unless there is a threat of ongoing activity. This aligns with the
proposition that the district court should not have treated the "single
scheme" doctrine as dispositive without considering the potential for
continued criminal activity.

U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
In subsequent cases, courts have struggled to implement Sedima's directive
to develop a meaningful concept of pattern based on continuity plus
relationship. Development of a uniform concept has been hampered by
Sedima's instruction to read limitations into the statutory definition even
though the Act is to be broadly construed, see id. at 3286, by the myriad of
diverse fact patterns underlying civil RICO suits, and by the abstract nature
of the Court's references to continuity and relationship. ... A more difficult
question is presented when the RICO claim is based on one scheme
involving one victim, but the plan contemplates open-ended fraudulent

activity and does not have a single goal that, when achieved, will bring the
activity to an end. Some courts have found that such an ongoing scheme is
itself sufficient to satisfy the continuity element of a RICO pattern.
Summary
Challenges courts face in interpreting the continuity requirement for RICO
claims, emphasizing that a single scheme with an open-ended fraudulent
activity can satisfy the continuity element. This aligns with the proposition
that the key inquiry is whether the acts pose a threat of continued criminal
activity, rather than being dismissed solely because they involve a single
scheme or victim.
Condict v. Condict, 815 F.2d 579 (10th Cir. 1987)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
A more difficult question is presented when the RICO claim is based on one
scheme involving one victim, but the plan contemplates open-ended
fraudulent activity and does not have a single goal that, when achieved, will
bring the activity to an end. Some courts have found that such an ongoing
scheme is itself sufficient to satisfy the continuity element of a RICO pattern.
See, e.g., Morgan v. Bank of Waukegan, 804 F.2d 970, 976 (7th Cir.1986);
see also Illinois Dept. of Revenue v. Phillips, 771 F.2d 312 (7th Cir.1985).
Summary
Complexity of RICO claims involving a single scheme with one victim but
with open-ended fraudulent activity. It highlights that some courts have
found such ongoing schemes sufficient to satisfy the continuity requirement
of a RICO pattern. This aligns with the proposition that the key inquiry is
whether the acts pose a threat of continued criminal activity, rather than
being dismissed solely based on the "single scheme" doctrine.
Condict v. Condict, 826 F.2d 923 (10th Cir. 1987)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
The implication is that while two acts are necessary, they may not be
sufficient. Indeed, in common parlance two of anything do not generally
form a 'pattern.' The legislative history supports the view that two isolated
acts of racketeering activity do not constitute a pattern. As the Senate
Report explained: 'The target of [RICO] is thus not sporadic activity. The
infiltration of legitimate business normally requires more than one

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
'racketeering activity' and the threat of continuing activity to be effective. It
is this factor of continuity plus relationship which combines to produce a
pattern.' ... Courts generally agree that to make an adequate showing of
continuity under Sedima, a plaintiff must demonstrate some facts from
which at least a threat of ongoing illegal conduct may be inferred. A scheme
to achieve a single discrete objective does not in and of itself create a threat
of ongoing activity, even when that goal is pursued by multiple illegal acts,
because the scheme ends when the purpose is accomplished. Courts that
have considered a RICO claim grounded on this type of scheme have
therefore required some additional evidence showing that the scheme was
not an isolated occurrence.
Summary
Necessity of demonstrating continuity and relationship to establish a pattern
of racketeering activity under RICO. It emphasizes that two acts alone are
not sufficient to establish a pattern and that there must be a threat of
ongoing illegal conduct. This aligns with the proposition that the key inquiry
is whether the acts amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity,
rather than being a single, isolated event. The passage supports the idea
that the district court should not have treated the "single scheme" doctrine
as dispositive without considering the potential for continuity.

More difficult to establish-and more problematic for Plaintiffs-is the
requirement that the predicate acts have sufficient “continuity” to constitute
a RICO “pattern.” See Bixler v. Foster, 596 F.3d 751, 761 (10th Cir. 2010)
(indicating that the continuity requirement “is more difficult to
meet” (citation and quotation marks omitted)). For RICO purposes,
continuity comes in one of two forms: Closed-ended continuity can be
established by alleging a “closed period of repeated racketeering conduct.”
Johnson, 56 F.4th at 859-60 (citing H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 241-43). Open-ended
continuity can be established by racketeering acts that “involved implicit or
explicit threats of repetition,” “formed the operations of an association that
exists for criminal purposes,” or were part of the defendants' “regular way
of conducting a legitimate enterprise.”
Summary
Requirement of "continuity" in establishing a RICO pattern, which is central
to the proposition. It explains that continuity can be either closed-ended or
open-ended, aligning with the proposition's emphasis on the need to assess
whether acts pose a threat of continued criminal activity. The passage
references H.J. Inc., a Supreme Court case, supporting the idea that
continuity is a key inquiry rather than a categorical bar based on a single
scheme.
Skurkey v. Daniel
U.S. District Court — Western District of Oklahoma
Extract
To plead a valid RICO claim, a plaintiff must plausibly allege that a
defendant “(1) conducted the affairs (2) of an enterprise (3) through a
pattern (4) of racketeering activity.” ... The Supreme Court has explained
that there are two elements to finding a pattern for RICO purposes:
“continuity plus relationship.” ... Plaintiff argues the Complaint alleges facts
to support both open- and closed-ended continuity. ... closed-ended
continuity consists of a closed period of repeated, related racketeering acts
that do not necessarily threaten future repetition. ... Because RICO targets
long-term racketeering conduct, closed-ended continuity requires a series of
related racketeering acts over a “substantial period of time.” ... In
evaluating whether the Plaintiff has pled sufficient facts to support the
extensiveness prong the Court considers “'the number of victims, the
number of racketeering acts, the variety of racketeering acts, whether the
injuries were distinct, the complexity and size of the scheme, and the nature
or character of the enterprise.” ... No factor is required or dispositive; the
factors merely guide [the court] in seeking “a natural and commonsense
result.”

Summary
Requirements for a valid RICO claim, emphasizing the need for a "pattern"
of racketeering activity, which includes "continuity plus relationship." It
discusses both open- and closed-ended continuity, noting that closed-ended

U.S. District Court — District of Kansas
Extract
In H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106
L.Ed.2d 195 (1989), the Supreme Court reiterated the well-established
concept that racketeering acts form a 'pattern' in RICO where they exhibit
'continuity plus relationship.' Id. at 239, 109 S.Ct. at 2900. The 'relationship'
requirement is satisfied when the racketeering acts have 'the same or
similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of commission, or
otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not
isolated events.' Id. at 240, 109 S.Ct. at 2901 (citing Sedima, 473 U.S. at 496
n. 14, 105 S.Ct. at 3285 n. 14). With respect to the 'continuity' requirement,
the Supreme Court stated that the predicate acts must amount to, or pose a
threat of, continuing racketeering activity. Id. According to the Supreme
Court, continuity 'is both a closed- and open-ended concept, referring to a
closed period of repeated conduct, or to past conduct that by its nature
projects into the future with a threat of repetition.' Id. A RICO plaintiff 'may
demonstrate continuity over a closed period by proving a series of related
predicates extending over a substantial period of time.' Id. Predicates
extending over merely a few weeks or months, on the other hand, may
satisfy the continuity element if there is a threat of repetition in the future.
This latter concept of continuity, which occurs over an 'open period,' is
established by showing that the predicate acts are a 'regular way of
conducting the enterprise's ongoing business.'
Summary
Requirements for establishing a "pattern" of racketeering activity under
RICO, emphasizing the need for "continuity plus relationship." It explains
that continuity can be demonstrated through either a closed period of
repeated conduct or an open period where past conduct projects into the
future with a threat of repetition. This aligns with the proposition that the
key inquiry is whether the acts, as alleged, amount to or pose a threat of
continued criminal activity, rather than being dismissed solely based on the
"single scheme" doctrine.

U.S. District Court — District of Colorado
Extract
In order to make out a pattern under RICO, the predicate acts must
somehow be ordered or arranged, bearing some relationship to each other,
and implicate the threat of continuing activity. H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell
Telephone Co., 492 U.S. 229, 238-239, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 2900-2901, 106 L.Ed.
2d 195 (1989). 'Continuity' is both a closed- and openended concept,
referring either to a closed period of repeated conduct, or to past conduct
that by its nature projects into the future with the threat of repetition. Id. at
241, 109 S.Ct. at 2901. However, in H.J. Inc., the Supreme Court appeared
to discourage such narrow constructions, noting that Congress had defined
'pattern of criminal conduct' only in terms of the relationship between the
criminal acts, thus conceiving of 'pattern' as a 'flexible concept' that is not so
narrow as to exclude activities performed by only one person or activities
without an organized crime nexus. 492 U.S. at 245-46, 109 S.Ct. at 2903-04.
Summary
Requirement for a "pattern" of racketeering activity under RICO,
emphasizing the need for predicate acts to be related and to pose a threat of
continued criminal activity. It highlights the Supreme Court's view that the
concept of a "pattern" is flexible and not limited to activities involving
organized crime or multiple actors. This supports the proposition by
indicating that a single scheme with a single victim can still meet the RICO
pattern requirement if it involves ongoing or repeated conduct that poses a
threat of future criminal activity.

In order for Plaintiffs to prove a pattern, they must demonstrate not only the
existence of two or more predicate acts, but also that they are related and
pose at least a threat of continued criminal activity. H.J., 492 U.S. at 238-39,
109 S.Ct. 2893. Thus, Plaintiffs must show two elements—'continuity plus
relationship.' Feinstein v. RTC, 942 F.2d 34, 44 (1st Cir.1991). ... Continuity
is both a closed and open-ended concept, referring either to a closed period
of repeated conduct, or to past conduct that by its nature projects into the
future with a threat of repetition. It is, in either case, centrally a temporal
concept—and particularly so in the RICO context, where what must be
continuous, RICO's predicate acts or offenses, and the relationship these
predicates must bear one to another, are distinct requirements. H.J., 492
U.S. at 241-42, 109 S.Ct. 2893.
Summary
Requirement for proving a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO,
emphasizing the need for continuity and relationship among predicate acts.
It references the Supreme Court's decision in H.J. Inc., which is central to
understanding the continuity requirement. The passage also highlights that
continuity can be either closed or open-ended, which aligns with the
proposition's focus on ongoing coordination and repeated acts over time.
The reference to Resolution Trust Corp. v. Stone further supports the idea
that the Tenth Circuit considers the duration and extensiveness of the
scheme in evaluating continuity.

Plaintiffs’ description of a single fraud scheme affects claims’ plausibility in
another respect: whether the alleged fraudulent acts accomplished a
discrete goal (which RICO would not cover) or whether they constitute a
pattern of racketeering activity (which RICO does concern). Erikson v.
Farmers Group, Inc., 151 F. App'x 672 (10th Cir. 2005). To establish the
'pattern' element, a plaintiff not only must show multiple predicate acts, 'but
also that the predicates themselves amount to, or that they otherwise
constitute a threat of, continuing racketeering activity.' Bixler, 596 F.3d at
761 (internal citation omitted) (emphasis in the original). This element
reflects Congress’ concern over long-term criminal activity. Boone v.
Carlsbad Bancorporation, Inc., 972 F.2d 1545, 1556 (10th Cir. 1992).
Summary
Distinction between a single scheme with a discrete goal and a pattern of
racketeering activity, which is central to the proposition. It emphasizes that
a pattern requires multiple predicate acts that either amount to or pose a
threat of continued criminal activity, aligning with the proposition's focus on
ongoing coordination and repeated acts over time. The passage also
references relevant Tenth Circuit case law, supporting the idea that the
court has not adopted a categorical rule barring claims based on a single

The Supreme Court has recently held that a RICO violation does not require
more than one scheme. H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co., --- U.S.
----, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989). The Court there reiterated its
prior holding that all that is required to constitute a pattern are two
elements--'continuity plus relationship.' Sedima, 473 U.S. at 496 n. 14, 105
S.Ct. at 3285 n. 14. There is no question that the acts complained of in this
case are related because they are all part of an alleged common scheme.
See Torwest DBC, Inc. v. Dick, 810 F.2d 925, 928 (10th Cir.1987). The
central question is whether they are 'continuous.'
Summary
A RICO violation does not necessitate multiple schemes, as long as there is
continuity and relationship among the acts. This aligns with the proposition
that a single scheme can suffice if it demonstrates continuity, which is a key
inquiry in RICO claims. The passage supports the idea that the district court
should not have dismissed the claim solely based on the "single scheme"
doctrine without considering the continuity of the alleged acts.

Stone, 998 F.2d 1534, 1543 (10th Cir. 1993) (holding duration and
extensiveness 'are particularly relevant to the determination of continuity').
Extensiveness is determined by considering the number of victims, the
number of acts, the variety of acts, the distinctiveness of the injuries, and
the complexity of the scheme.
Summary
The passage references key cases, H.J. Inc. and Resolution Trust Corp. v.
Stone, which are pivotal in understanding the continuity requirement under
RICO. It highlights that continuity can be established through either closed-
ended or open-ended continuity, and that the duration and extensiveness of
the scheme are critical factors. This aligns with the proposition that a single
scheme can still meet RICO's pattern requirement if it shows a threat of
continued criminal activity.

Extract
The Supreme Court reversed the Eighth Circuit in H.J., holding that
'although proof that a RICO defendant has been involved in multiple
criminal schemes would certainly be highly relevant to the inquiry into the
continuity of the defendant's racketeering activity, it is implausible to
suppose that Congress thought continuity might be shown only by proof of
multiple schemes.' ... Declaring that Congress intended the courts to 'take a
flexible approach' in identifying 'patterns' of racketeering activity, the Court
held that 'a plaintiff or prosecutor must prove ... continuity of racketeering
activity, or its threat.' ... In a closed-ended case, a plaintiff can demonstrate
continuity by showing the commission of predicate acts over 'a substantial
period of time'; in an open-ended case, a plaintiff can demonstrate continuity
by showing the commission of predicate acts over a shorter period of time if
the threat of continuity still exists.
Summary
The Supreme Court in H.J. Inc. rejected the notion that continuity in RICO
cases requires proof of multiple schemes. Instead, the Court emphasized a
flexible approach, focusing on whether there is continuity or a threat of
continuity in the racketeering activity. This aligns with the proposition that a
single scheme with ongoing coordination and repeated acts can still meet
the continuity requirement if it poses a threat of continued criminal activity.

Justice Scalia, along with Justices Rehnquist, O'Connor, and Kennedy, did
agree that the Eighth Circuit's 'single scheme' exclusion from RICO was
improper. '[T]he Court is correct in saying that nothing in [RICO] supports
the proposition that predicate acts constituting part of a single scheme (or
single episode) can never support a cause of action under RICO.' Thus, all
nine of the Justices of the Court agreed that single schemes of racketeering
activity could establish a RICO violation, and that the Eight Circuit's
multiple scheme requirement was invalid.

Utah Bar Journal - Utah State Bar - 1991-00-00
Extract
In H.J., Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co. the Court addressed the
standard for a RICO pattern. The Court rejected a 'separate schemes' test in
favor of a 'separate acts' test, so that two or more predicate acts within a
single scheme could support a RICO complaint. In endorsing the single
scheme, separate acts standard, the Court stated that 'to prove a pattern of
racketeering activity a plaintiff or prosecutor must show that the
racketeering predicates are related, and that they amount to or pose a
threat of continued criminal activity.'
Summary
The passage from the document discusses the Supreme Court's decision in
H.J., Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co., which is directly relevant to
the proposition. The Court's rejection of the "separate schemes" test in favor
of a "separate acts" test supports the idea that a single scheme with multiple
acts can constitute a RICO pattern if the acts are related and pose a threat
of continued criminal activity. This aligns with the proposition that the
district court erred by focusing solely on the "single scheme" doctrine
without considering the continuity and threat of ongoing criminal activity.

Summary
Interpretation of the "pattern" requirement in RICO cases, emphasizing that
multiple violations within a single scheme can still constitute a pattern if
they demonstrate continuity and pose a threat of ongoing criminal activity.
This aligns with the proposition that a single scheme with repeated acts over
time can meet the RICO pattern requirement, contrary to a categorical rule
barring such claims.

H.J. Inc. dwelled upon the continuity element, however, at some length. It
rejected the Eighth Circuit’s “multiple schemes” test as needlessly rigid. The
H.J. Court stressed that “[w]hat a plaintiff or prosecutor must prove is
continuity of racketeering activity, or its threat, simpliciter.” Id. at 240–41
(Court’s emphasis). Under the “less inflexible approach” adopted in H.J. Inc.,
continuity is “both a closed- and open-ended concept.” Id. at 241. Closed-
ended continuity refers “to a closed period of repeated conduct,” while
open-ended continuity denotes “past conduct that by its nature projects into

The passage from H.J. Inc. emphasizes the importance of continuity in RICO
claims, rejecting a rigid "multiple schemes" requirement and instead
focusing on whether there is continuity or a threat of continued criminal

Damages
Colorado Lawyer - Colorado Bar Association - 1986-00-00
Extract
The Court stated that 'while two [racketeering] acts are necessary, they may
not be sufficient' to establish a pattern. The majority indicated that a pattern
requires continuity and relationship and embraces acts ''that have the same
or similar purposes, results, participants, victims or methods of commission,
or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not
isolated events.' Justice Powell suggested that 'pattern' should be
interpreted: as requiring that (i) the racketeering acts be related to each
other, (ii) they be part of some common scheme, and (iii) some sort of
continuity between the acts or a threat of continuing criminal activity must
be shown.
Summary
Requirement for a pattern in RICO claims, emphasizing the need for
continuity and relationship among racketeering acts. It highlights that a
pattern involves acts that are interrelated and not isolated, aligning with the
proposition that a single scheme with ongoing coordination and repeated
acts can meet the pattern requirement if it poses a threat of continued
criminal activity. This supports the idea that the district court should not
have treated the "single scheme" doctrine as dispositive without considering
the continuity and threat of ongoing criminal activity.

The inquiry here is meant to invoke the 'pattern of racketeering activity'
element of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).
The Organized Crime Control Act (1970), which includes RICO, provides that
'criminal conduct forms a pattern if it embraces criminal acts that have the
same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of
commission, or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics
and are not isolated events.' The Supreme Court characterized this
requirement as a 'relationship' element and held that the statute further
requires a 'continuity' element, 'referring either to a closed period of
repeated conduct, or to past conduct that by its nature projects into the
future with a threat of repetition.'

Summary
The passage explains the requirements for establishing a "pattern of

"relationship" and "continuity" element. This aligns with the proposition that
the key inquiry is whether the acts amount to or pose a threat of continued
criminal activity. The passage supports the idea that a single scheme can

Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy
The Brief - American Bar Association - 2024-01-01
Extract
These acts must be related and continuous to constitute a pattern. The
relatedness and continuity issue first came to prominence in a famous
footnote to the Supreme Court’s decision in Sedima. In Sedima, the Court
noted that the term “pattern of racketeering activity” had been left
intentionally vague by Congress, and it invited further clarification by the
lower courts. The Court did not provide a precise definition of what
constitutes a pattern in this context. This ambiguity in the definition of the
statutory word “pattern” occasioned a split among the federal circuit courts
as they attempted to interpret and apply the civil RICO statute. Two primary
issues emerged: 1. Relatedness: This aspect of the pattern requirement
concerns whether the alleged racketeering acts are related to each other.
Courts have grappled with how closely connected these acts must be to
meet the relatedness criterion. Some circuits adopted a broad
interpretation, while others opted for a stricter nexus between the acts. 2.
Continuity: The continuity issue pertains to the temporal aspect of the
pattern. It questions whether the racketeering acts display a continuous
course of conduct over time or whether they are isolated incidents. Courts
have debated how long this course of conduct must persist to satisfy the
continuity criterion. Some circuits adopted a closed-ended approach
(requiring acts within a specific time frame), while others embraced an
open-ended approach (focusing on the threat of future racketeering
activity).
Summary
Concepts of relatedness and continuity in the context of RICO claims, which
are central to determining whether a pattern of racketeering activity exists.
The passage highlights the ambiguity in the statutory definition of "pattern"
and notes that different circuits have adopted varying interpretations. This
supports the proposition by emphasizing that the key inquiry is whether the
acts amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity, rather than
being a single, isolated event. The passage aligns with the idea that the
Tenth Circuit has not adopted a categorical rule barring claims based on a

The continuity requirement is likewise satisfied where the predicates are a
regular way of conducting the defendant's ongoing legitimate business (in
the sense that it is not a business that exists for criminal purposes), or of
conducting or participating in an ongoing and legitimate RICO 'enterprise.'
A plaintiff may demonstrate a pattern by establishment that the predicate
acts pose a threat of continued criminal activity, which is generally
demonstrated by showing either: * Closed-ended continuity. Proving 'a series
of related predicate acts extending over a substantial period of time.' *
Open-ended continuity. A threat of 'continuing criminal activity extending
indefinitely into the future,' in light of the nature of the enterprise and
predicate acts alleged.
Summary
The passage explains the concept of continuity in RICO claims, which is
crucial for establishing a pattern of racketeering activity. It outlines two
types of continuity: closed-ended, which involves a series of related acts
over a substantial period, and open-ended, which involves a threat of
ongoing criminal activity. This directly supports the proposition that the key
inquiry in RICO claims is whether the acts pose a threat of continued
criminal activity, rather than being dismissed solely based on the "single
scheme" doctrine.
