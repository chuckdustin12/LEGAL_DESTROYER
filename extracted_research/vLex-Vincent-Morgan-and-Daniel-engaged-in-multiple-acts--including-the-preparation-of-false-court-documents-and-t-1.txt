Question
Morgan and Daniel engaged in multiple acts, including the preparation of
false court documents and the use of those documents in legal proceedings.
Under 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1), "racketeering activity" includes acts indictable
under certain provisions of Title 18, such as mail fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1341)
and wire fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343). The preparation and use of false court
documents likely involved fraudulent communications (e.g., mail or
electronic communications), which could qualify as predicate acts of mail or
wire fraud under RICO.
Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
The preparation and use of false court documents by Morgan and Daniel
likely constitutes "racketeering activity" under RICO if these actions
involved the use of mail or electronic communications in furtherance of a
scheme to defraud, which would qualify as predicate acts of mail fraud (18
U.S.C. § 1341) or wire fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343). Their multiple acts could
establish the required "pattern of racketeering activity" needed for RICO
liability if they are related and amount to or threaten continued criminal
activity.
Summary
Based on the provided materials, Morgan and Daniel's actions in preparing
and using false court documents in legal proceedings could qualify as
"racketeering activity" under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act (RICO) if these actions involved the use of mail or wire
communications in furtherance of a scheme to defraud. The definition of
"racketeering activity" under 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1) explicitly includes acts
indictable under the mail fraud statute (18 U.S.C. § 1341) and the wire fraud
statute (18 U.S.C. § 1343). If Morgan and Daniel used mail, private carriers,
or electronic communications to prepare or transmit these false court
documents as part of a fraudulent scheme, their actions could constitute
predicate acts of mail or wire fraud under RICO.
To establish a RICO violation, however, more than isolated predicate acts is
required. The predicate acts must form a "pattern of racketeering activity,"
which requires at least two acts of racketeering activity within a ten-year
period that are related and amount to or threaten continued criminal
activity. If Morgan and Daniel engaged in multiple acts involving fraudulent
communications through mail or wire in furtherance of their scheme to
prepare and use false court documents, and these acts were related and
posed a threat of continued criminal activity, their conduct could satisfy the
requirements for a RICO violation.

Background and Relevant Law
Legislation
The RICO statute defines "racketeering activity" to include various federal
criminal offenses, including mail fraud and wire fraud. According to the
current version of 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1), as provided in the materials:
"'racketeering activity' means... (B) any act which is indictable under any of
the following provisions of title 18, United States Code:... section 1341
(relating to mail fraud), section 1343 (relating to wire fraud)..." 18 U.S.C. §
1961 Definitions, 18 U.S.C. § 1961. This definition establishes that acts
indictable under the mail fraud or wire fraud statutes qualify as predicate
acts of racketeering activity under RICO.
The mail fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1341, prohibits: "Whoever, having
devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for
obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses,
representations, or promises... for the purpose of executing such scheme or
artifice or attempting so to do, places in any post office or authorized
depository for mail matter, any matter or thing whatever to be sent or
delivered by the Postal Service, or deposits or causes to be deposited any
matter or thing whatever to be sent or delivered by any private or
commercial interstate carrier... shall be fined under this title or imprisoned
not more than 20 years, or both." 18 U.S.C. § 1341 Frauds and Swindles, 18
U.S.C. § 1341.
Similarly, the wire fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1343, prohibits: "Whoever,
having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud, or
for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses,
representations, or promises, transmits or causes to be transmitted by
means of wire, radio, or television communication in interstate or foreign
commerce, any writings, signs, signals, pictures, or sounds for the purpose
of executing such scheme or artifice, shall be fined under this title or
imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both." 18 U.S.C. § 1343 Fraud By
Wire, Radio, Or Television, 18 U.S.C. § 1343.
Case Law
The Supreme Court has provided guidance on what constitutes a "pattern of
racketeering activity" under RICO. In Inc v. Northwestern Bell Telephone
Company, 492 U.S. 229, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989), the Court
held that "RICO's legislative history, however, establishes that Congress
intended that to prove a 'pattern of racketeering activity' a plaintiff or
prosecutor must show both 'relationship' and 'continuity'—that the
racketeering predicates are related, and that they either constitute or
threaten long-term criminal activity..." The Court also acknowledged that
RICO's expansive uses "appear to be primarily the result of the breadth of
the predicate offenses, in particular the inclusion of wire, mail, and
securities fraud..."

In Bridge v. Phoenix Bond & Indem. Co., 553 U.S. 639, 128 S.Ct. 2131, 170
L.Ed.2d 1012 (2008), the Supreme Court clarified that "a plaintiff asserting
a RICO claim predicated on mail fraud need not show, either as an element
of its claim or as a prerequisite to establishing proximate causation, that it
relied on the defendant's alleged misrepresentations." The Court explained
that mail fraud "occurs whenever a person, 'having devised or intending to
devise any scheme or artifice to defraud,' uses the mail 'for the purpose of
executing such scheme or artifice.'"
Lower courts have further elaborated on what constitutes mail and wire
fraud as predicate acts under RICO. In Doe v. Varsity Brands, LLC, U.S.
District Court — District of South Carolina (2023), the court stated: "RICO is
founded on the concept of racketeering activity... The RICO statute contains
an exhaustive list of predicate acts that qualify as 'racketeering activity.' 18
U.S.C. § 1961(1). Included in the list is 'any act which is indictable under' 18
U.S.C. § 1341 (mail fraud) or 18 U.S.C. § 1343 (wire fraud). 18 U.S.C. §
1961(1)(B)."
In Norfe Grp. Corp. v. R.Y. Espinosa Inc., Civil No. 19-1897 (BJM) (D. P.R.
May 07, 2021), the court explained: "RICO liability breaks down to four
essential elements: '(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4)
of racketeering activity.' Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479, 496
(1985)." The court further specified that mail fraud "occurs whenever a
person, 'having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to
defraud,' uses the mail 'for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice
or attempting so to do.'" Similarly, for wire fraud, a plaintiff must allege that
defendants "engaged in a scheme to defraud with the specific intent to
defraud and that they used... the interstate wires in furtherance of the
scheme."
Uselmann v. Pop, 495 F.Supp.3d 528 (E.D. Mich. 2020) reiterated that "RICO
defines 'racketeering activity' to include a multitude of offenses that are
either 'chargeable' under certain state criminal laws or 'indictable' under
specified federal criminal laws. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1). Both the mail fraud
statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1341, and the wire fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1343, are
listed as predicate racketeering offenses under RICO."
The elements of mail and wire fraud were further elucidated in Westchester
Cnty. Independence Party v. Astorino, 137 F.Supp.3d 586 (S.D. N.Y. 2015):
"The elements of wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343 are (i) a scheme to
defraud (ii) to get money or property, (iii) furthered by the use of interstate
wires... The elements of mail fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1341 are identical,
except that mail fraud must be furthered by use of the mails."
In Hall v. Witteman, 569 F.Supp.2d 1208 (D. Kan. 2008), the court explained
that to establish the predicate act of mail fraud, a plaintiff must allege "(1)
the existence of a scheme or artifice to defraud or obtain money or property
by false pretenses, representations or promises, and (2) use of the United
States mails for the purpose of executing the scheme." Similarly, the
elements of wire fraud "are very similar, but require that the defendant use
interstate wire, radio or television communications in furtherance of the
scheme to defraud."

It's important to note that U.S. v. Massa, 740 F.2d 629 (8th Cir. 1984), which
stated that for mail fraud, "it is not necessary that the scheme contemplated
the use of the mails as an essential element," but rather "it is enough if the
mailing is 'incident to an essential part of the scheme,'" was stated as
overruled by United States v. Reichel, 911 F.3d 910 (8th Cir. 2018).
However, the principle that the mailing need only be incident to an essential
part of the scheme is still valid law, as it was initially established by the
Supreme Court in Pereira v. United States, 347 U.S. 1 (1954), which has not
been overruled on this point.
Similarly, United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 101 S.Ct. 2524, 69 L.Ed.
2d 246 (1981), which discussed the elements of a RICO violation, was
abrogated by United States v. Lane, 474 U.S. 438 (1986). However, Lane
addressed issues of misjoinder under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure
8(b) and did not affect Turkette's core holdings regarding the definition of
an "enterprise" and a "pattern of racketeering activity" under RICO.
P & P MARKETING, INC. v. Ditton, 746 F. Supp. 1354 (N.D. Ill. 1990) further
clarified that for mail and wire fraud, "it is not required that the false
representations be sent through the U.S. mails or made through the use of
interstate wires." Instead, "it is only necessary to have a scheme to defraud
coupled with a mailing or use of interstate wires in furtherance of the
scheme and the use of the mails or interstate wires need not be an essential
part of the scheme, but it is sufficient if such use is incident to an essential
component of the scheme."
Ashland Oil, Inc. v. Arnett, 875 F.2d 1271 (7th Cir. 1989) emphasized that "in
mail and wire fraud, each mailing or interstate communication is a separate
indictable offense, even if each relates to the same scheme to defraud, and
even if the defendant did not control the number of mailings or
communications."
Federal Ins. Co. v. Webne, 513 F.Supp.2d 921 (N.D. Ohio 2007) outlined that
under RICO, a plaintiff must allege "at least two predicate acts occurring
within a ten year time period" to establish "racketeering activity." The court
confirmed that "mail fraud, wire fraud, money laundering, and racketeering
are included in the definition of 'racketeering activity' in § 1961."
U.S. v. Reifler, 446 F.3d 65 (2nd Cir. 2006) noted that to prove a RICO
offense, the government must show a "pattern of racketeering activity,"
which is interpreted to mean "multiple racketeering predicates—which can
be part of a single scheme—that are related and that amount to, or threaten
the likelihood of, continued criminal activity."
U.S. v. Goldin Industries, Inc., 219 F.3d 1271 (11th Cir. 2000) illustrated how
mail fraud can establish RICO liability, noting that the defendants "violated
RICO by sending invoices and checks to the customers who had been
cheated in the Goldin Corporations' various schemes. The invoices and
checks fraudulently misrepresented the amounts actually due to the victims
of these schemes."
Wisdom v. First Midwest Bank, of Poplar Bluff, 167 F.3d 402 (8th Cir. 1999)
explained that when pled as RICO predicate acts, mail and wire fraud

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
require showing: "(1) a plan or scheme to defraud, (2) intent to defraud, (3)
reasonable foreseeability that the mail or wires will be used, and (4) actual
use of the mail or wires to further the scheme."
U.S. v. Palumbo Bros., Inc., 145 F.3d 850 (7th Cir. 1998) emphasized that
"separate violations of other federal and state criminal statutes are the
predicate acts upon which a pattern of racketeering activity is created" and
that "RICO specifically identifies mail fraud as a predicate act for liability."
Adler v. Berg Harmon Associates, 790 F.Supp. 1222 (S.D. N.Y. 1992) outlined
the elements necessary to state a claim under RICO: "(1) that the defendant
(2) through the commission of two or more acts (3) constituting a
'pattern' (4) of 'racketeering activity' (5) directly or indirectly invests in, or
maintains an interest in, or participates in (6) an 'enterprise' (7) the
activities of which affect interstate or foreign commerce."
Al-Kazemi v. General Acceptance & Inv. Corp., 633 F. Supp. 540 (D. D.C.
1986) confirmed that under RICO, "racketeering activity" is defined to
include mail fraud and wire fraud, and that evidence showing "a scheme to
defraud and the mailing or transmission by wire of a document or
communication for the purpose of executing the scheme" satisfies the
requirements of the mail and wire fraud statutes.
U.S. v. Hewes, 729 F.2d 1302 (11th Cir. 1984) illustrated a case where
defendants were charged with RICO conspiracy and substantive RICO
violations, along with "numerous counts of mail and wire fraud." The court
noted that the "overt acts and substantive predicate crimes that were
alleged in the indictment to have furthered the pattern of racketeering were
sufficiently connected that their interrelationship constituted an offense of a
series of acts or transactions."
Administrative Decisions
An administrative decision in Matter of [Name redacted] (2017) stated that
mail fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1341 occurs when "a person, 'having devised or
intending to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud,' uses the mail 'for the
purpose of executing such scheme or artifice.'"
Secondary Materials
Secondary materials provide additional context and interpretation of the
RICO statute and its application to mail and wire fraud. "Civil Rico: A Tool of
Advocacy" (2024) explains that "Section 1961(1) outlines the definition of
'racketeering activity' and enumerates various predicate acts that can
establish a pattern of racketeering. These predicate acts encompass a wide
range of criminal activities, including but not limited to mail fraud, wire
fraud, bribery, extortion, and money laundering."
"RICO: A Primer" (2022) emphasizes that "'racketeering activities' include
'any act which is indictable under' a list of federal criminal statutes" and
specifically notes that "mail and wire fraud are the most common predicate
acts."

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
"MAIL AND WIRE FRAUD" (2021) confirms that "mail and wire fraud are
predicate felonies under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act ('RICO')."
"Theft offenses" (2020) outlines the elements of mail fraud under 18 U.S.C.
§1341, which "requires that the defendant devise or intend to devise a
scheme to defraud (or to perform specified fraudulent acts), and that the
defendant use the mail for the purpose of executing, or attempting to
execute, the scheme to defraud." Similarly, wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. §1343
requires "the scheme or artifice and 3) use of interstate wire
communications."
"Mail and wire fraud" (2014) notes that "the character, language, and scope
of the mail and wire fraud statutes are similar" and that "legal analysis and
case law on mail fraud are equally applicable to wire fraud." The article
explains that for mail or wire fraud, "the government must show beyond a
reasonable doubt that the defendant perpetrated: (i) a scheme to defraud by
means of a material deception; (ii) with the intent to defraud; (iii) while
using the mails, private commercial carriers, and/or wires in furtherance of
that scheme; (iv) that did result or would have resulted in the loss of money
or property or the deprivation of honest services."
"Chapter 4. Elements of Cause of Action" explains that "mail and wire fraud
are the two most frequently alleged predicate acts" under RICO and that
"the actual violation is the mailing, which must relate to the underlying
fraudulent scheme."
Analysis
Based on the provided materials, the preparation and use of false court
documents by Morgan and Daniel could qualify as "racketeering activity"
under RICO if their actions involved the use of mail or electronic
communications in furtherance of a scheme to defraud.
Predicate Acts of Mail and Wire Fraud
The RICO statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1), explicitly includes acts indictable
under the mail fraud statute (18 U.S.C. § 1341) and the wire fraud statute
(18 U.S.C. § 1343) as predicate acts of "racketeering activity." As confirmed
by multiple sources, including Doe v. Varsity Brands, LLC (2023), Uselmann
v. Pop, 495 F.Supp.3d 528 (E.D. Mich. 2020), and Westchester Cnty.
Independence Party v. Astorino, 137 F.Supp.3d 586 (S.D. N.Y. 2015), mail
and wire fraud are established predicate acts under RICO.
If Morgan and Daniel used mail, private carriers, or electronic
communications in connection with their preparation and use of false court
documents, their actions could constitute mail or wire fraud. The mail fraud
statute prohibits using the mail "for the purpose of executing" a scheme to
defraud, while the wire fraud statute prohibits transmitting "by means of
wire, radio, or television communication" any writings or signals "for the
purpose of executing such scheme or artifice."

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
The elements of mail fraud, as outlined in Hall v. Witteman, 569 F.Supp.2d
1208 (D. Kan. 2008) and other sources, include: (1) the existence of a
scheme to defraud, and (2) the use of the United States mails for the
purpose of executing the scheme. Similarly, wire fraud requires: (1) a
scheme to defraud, and (2) the use of interstate wire communications in
furtherance of the scheme.
Morgan and Daniel's preparation of false court documents could constitute a
"scheme to defraud" if they intended to deceive the court or other parties in
the legal proceedings. As noted in P & P MARKETING, INC. v. Ditton, 746 F.
Supp. 1354 (N.D. Ill. 1990), "it is not required that the false representations
be sent through the U.S. mails or made through the use of interstate wires."
Instead, what matters is whether there was "a scheme to defraud coupled
with a mailing or use of interstate wires in furtherance of the scheme."
Moreover, as clarified in Bridge v. Phoenix Bond & Indem. Co., 553 U.S. 639
(2008), a plaintiff asserting a RICO claim based on mail fraud does not need
to show reliance on the defendant's misrepresentations. The focus is on
whether the defendant used the mail for the purpose of executing a scheme
to defraud.
Pattern of Racketeering Activity
For Morgan and Daniel's actions to constitute a RICO violation, they must
form a "pattern of racketeering activity." According to Federal Ins. Co. v.
Webne, 513 F.Supp.2d 921 (N.D. Ohio 2007) and other sources, this requires
at least two predicate acts occurring within a ten-year period.
Furthermore, as established in Inc v. Northwestern Bell Telephone
Company, 492 U.S. 229 (1989), these predicate acts must show both
"relationship" and "continuity"—they must be related and either constitute
or threaten long-term criminal activity. U.S. v. Reifler, 446 F.3d 65 (2nd Cir.
2006) notes that these predicate acts can be "part of a single scheme" as
long as they are related and "amount to, or threaten the likelihood of,
continued criminal activity."
If Morgan and Daniel engaged in multiple acts involving the preparation and
use of false court documents, and these acts involved the use of mail or
electronic communications, they could establish the required pattern. As
noted in Ashland Oil, Inc. v. Arnett, 875 F.2d 1271 (7th Cir. 1989), "in mail
and wire fraud, each mailing or interstate communication is a separate
indictable offense, even if each relates to the same scheme to defraud."
Application to Morgan and Daniel's Actions
Based on the information provided, Morgan and Daniel engaged in multiple
acts, including the preparation of false court documents and the use of those
documents in legal proceedings. If they used mail or electronic
communications in connection with these activities, their actions could
qualify as predicate acts of mail or wire fraud under RICO.

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
For example, if they:
Mailed the false court documents to the court or other parties
Used private carriers like FedEx to deliver the documents
Submitted the documents electronically through a court's electronic
filing system
Communicated about the preparation or use of the false documents via
email, phone, or other electronic means
Any of these actions could potentially satisfy the mail or wire element of
mail or wire fraud.
Moreover, if these actions were part of a related series of acts that posed a
threat of continued criminal activity, they could establish the required
"pattern of racketeering activity" under RICO.
Exceptions and Caveats
There are several important considerations and potential limitations to
classify Morgan and Daniel's actions as "racketeering activity" under RICO:
Intent to Defraud: As outlined in Wisdom v. First Midwest Bank, of
Poplar Bluff, 167 F.3d 402 (8th Cir. 1999) and other sources, mail and
wire fraud require intent to defraud. If Morgan and Daniel did not act
with the requisite fraudulent intent, their actions may not constitute
mail or wire fraud, even if they used mail or electronic communications.
Connection to the Scheme: The use of mail or electronic
communications must be "in furtherance of" or "for the purpose of
executing" the fraudulent scheme. If the communications were merely
incidental and not connected to the fraudulent scheme, they may not
satisfy this requirement. However, as noted in the overruled case U.S. v.
Massa, 740 F.2d 629 (8th Cir. 1984), "it is enough if the mailing is
'incident to an essential part of the scheme.'" While Massa was
overruled, this specific principle originated from Supreme Court
precedent in Pereira v. United States and remains valid law.
Interstate Commerce: For wire fraud, the communication must be "in
interstate or foreign commerce." If the electronic communications were
purely intrastate, they might not satisfy this element of wire fraud.
Relationship and Continuity: As established in Inc v. Northwestern
Bell Telephone Company, 492 U.S. 229 (1989), the predicate acts must
show both "relationship" and "continuity." If Morgan and Daniel's
actions were isolated or unrelated, they may not establish the required
pattern of racketeering activity.
Enterprise Requirement: RICO liability requires conduct of an
enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. As noted in Norfe
Grp. Corp. v. R.Y. Espinosa Inc. (2021), RICO liability breaks down to
four essential elements: "(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
pattern (4) of racketeering activity." If there is no enterprise involved in
Morgan and Daniel's actions, RICO may not apply.
Conclusion
Based on the provided materials, the preparation and use of false court
documents by Morgan and Daniel could qualify as "racketeering activity"
under RICO if their actions involved the use of mail or electronic
communications in furtherance of a scheme to defraud.
The RICO statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1), explicitly includes acts indictable
under the mail fraud statute (18 U.S.C. § 1341) and the wire fraud statute
(18 U.S.C. § 1343) as predicate acts of "racketeering activity." If Morgan and
Daniel used mail, private carriers, or electronic communications to prepare
or transmit the false court documents as part of a fraudulent scheme, their
actions could constitute predicate acts of mail or wire fraud under RICO.
Moreover, if they engaged in multiple related acts involving fraudulent
communications, and these acts posed a threat of continued criminal
activity, their conduct could establish the required "pattern of racketeering
activity" under RICO.
However, the application of RICO would depend on specific factual details,
such as whether Morgan and Daniel acted with fraudulent intent, whether
the use of mail or electronic communications was sufficiently connected to
the fraudulent scheme, and whether their activities involved an enterprise.
Without these specific details, it is not possible to make a definitive
determination of RICO liability.
In summary, while the preparation and use of false court documents could
potentially qualify as predicate acts of mail or wire fraud under RICO if they
involved fraudulent communications, a complete analysis would require
additional factual details about Morgan and Daniel's specific actions and
intent.
Legal Authorities
Wisdom v. First Midwest Bank, of Poplar Bluff, 167 F.3d 402 (8th Cir. 1999)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Eighth Circuit
Extract
In defining 'racketeering activity,' § 1961(1) lists the predicate acts that will
support a RICO claim. The Wisdoms' pro se complaint alleges that the
defendants' racketeering activity included numerous instances of mail fraud,
wire fraud, extortion, and violations of Truth In Lending. Acts indictable
under the mail fraud, wire fraud, and extortion statutes are among the
enumerated predicate acts... When pled as RICO predicate acts, mail and
wire fraud require a showing of: (1) a plan or scheme to defraud, (2) intent

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
to defraud, (3) reasonable foreseeability that the mail or wires will be used,
and (4) actual use of the mail or wires to further the scheme.
Summary
Elements required to establish mail and wire fraud as predicate acts, which
include a scheme to defraud, intent, foreseeability of mail or wire use, and
actual use of mail or wires. This supports the proposition that Morgan and
Daniel's actions, if involving fraudulent communications, could qualify as
predicate acts under RICO.
Ashland Oil, Inc. v. Arnett, 875 F.2d 1271 (7th Cir. 1989)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Seventh Circuit
Extract
RICO includes as 'racketeering activity' any act indictable under the mail
and wire fraud statutes. 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1961(1)(B). In mail and wire fraud,
each mailing or interstate communication is a separate indictable offense,
even if each relates to the same scheme to defraud, and even if the
defendant did not control the number of mailings or communications.
Summary
The passage from "Ashland Oil, Inc. v. Arnett" clarifies that under RICO, acts
of mail and wire fraud are considered "racketeering activity" as defined in
18 U.S.C. § 1961(1)(B). Each act of mailing or wire communication related to
a fraudulent scheme is a separate indictable offense. This supports the
proposition that Morgan and Daniel's preparation and use of false court
documents, if involving mail or electronic communications, could qualify as
predicate acts of mail or wire fraud under RICO.
P &amp; P MARKETING, INC. v. Ditton, 746 F. Supp. 1354 (N.D. Ill. 1990)
U.S. District Court — Northern District of Illinois
Extract
For purposes of the predicate acts of mail and wire fraud, 18 USC §§ 1341
and 1343, it is not required that the false representations be sent through
the U.S. mails or made through the use of interstate wires. U.S. v. Lea, 618 F.
2d 426, 430 (7th Cir.1980). It is only necessary to have a scheme to defraud
coupled with a mailing or use of interstate wires in furtherance of the
scheme and the use of the mails or interstate wires need not be an essential
part of the scheme, but it is sufficient if such use is incident to an essential
component of the scheme. Id. The defendant need not have personally used

=== PAGE 11 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
the mails or interstate wires, it is sufficient that their use by others was
reasonably foreseeable. U.S. v. Massa, 740 F.2d 629, 642 n. 7 (8th Cir.1984).
Summary
For mail and wire fraud to be considered predicate acts under RICO, it is not
necessary for the fraudulent representations themselves to be sent through
the mail or wires. Instead, there must be a scheme to defraud, and the use
of mail or wires must further that scheme. This aligns with the proposition
that Morgan and Daniel's preparation and use of false court documents
could involve mail or wire fraud if such communications were used in
furtherance of their fraudulent scheme. The passage also notes that the
defendant does not need to personally use the mails or wires, which
supports the idea that Morgan and Daniel could be liable if the use of such
communications was reasonably foreseeable.
U.S. v. Hewes, 729 F.2d 1302 (11th Cir. 1984)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Eleventh Circuit
Extract
The indictment charged the named defendants with conspiring to participate
in the affairs of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity
('RICO conspiracy'), 18 U.S.C.A. Sec. 1962(d), violation of the RICO statute's
substantive provisions, 18 U.S.C.A. Sec. 1962(c), numerous counts of mail
and wire fraud, 18 U.S.C.A. Secs. 1341 and 1343... The allegation in the
RICO conspiracy count was that the defendant[s] agreed to further a
racketeering enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. The
diverse parties were tied together through the overall scheme and the
concept of the illegal enterprise. The overt acts and substantive predicate
crimes that were alleged in the indictment to have furthered the pattern of
racketeering were sufficiently connected that their interrelationship
constituted an offense of a series of acts or transactions.
Summary
The defendants in "U.S. v. Hewes" were charged and convicted under RICO
for engaging in a pattern of racketeering activity, which included mail and
wire fraud. The court found that the defendants' actions were part of a
scheme to further a racketeering enterprise, and the mail and wire fraud
charges were integral to establishing the pattern of racketeering activity.
This supports the proposition that similar acts, such as the preparation and
use of false court documents involving fraudulent communications, could
qualify as predicate acts under RICO.

=== PAGE 12 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
U.S. Court of Appeals — Seventh Circuit
Extract
Separate violations of other federal and state criminal statutes are the
predicate acts upon which a pattern of racketeering activity is created.
Those predicate acts involve conduct that is otherwise 'chargeable' or
'indictable' and violations that are 'punishable' pursuant to independent
criminal statutes, and RICO specifically identifies mail fraud as a predicate
act for liability. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1). A RICO offense involves the relationship
of those predicate acts in a pattern of criminal activity.
Summary
The court recognizes mail fraud as a predicate act under RICO, which is
relevant to establishing a pattern of racketeering activity. The passage
discusses how separate violations of federal statutes, like mail fraud, can
serve as predicate acts for RICO liability. This supports the proposition that
fraudulent communications, such as those involved in the preparation and
use of false court documents, could qualify as predicate acts under RICO.
Sedima v. Imrex Company, Inc, 473 U.S. 479, 105 S.Ct. 3275, 87 L.Ed.2d 346
(1985)
U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C.
§§ 1961-1968, which is directed at 'racketeering activity'—defined in §
1961(1) to encompass, inter alia, acts 'indictable' under specific federal
criminal provisions, including mail and wire fraud—provides in § 1964(c) for
a private civil action to recover treble damages by any person injured in his
business or property 'by reason of a violation of section 1962.' Section
1962(c) prohibits conducting or participating in the conduct of an enterprise
'through a pattern of racketeering activity.'
Summary
RICO defines "racketeering activity" to include acts indictable under federal
criminal provisions, such as mail and wire fraud. The case highlights that
RICO allows for civil actions when a person is injured by a violation of
section 1962, which involves conducting an enterprise through a pattern of
racketeering activity. This supports the proposition that Morgan and Daniel's
actions, if involving mail or wire fraud, could qualify as predicate acts under
RICO.

United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 101 S.Ct. 2524, 69 L.Ed.2d 246
(1981)
U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
Chapter 96 of Title 18 of the United States Code, entitled Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO), was added to Title 18 by the
Organized Crime Control Act of 1970. Title 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), which is part
of RICO, makes it unlawful 'for any person employed by or associated with
any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or
foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the
conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering
activity or collection of unlawful debt.' The term 'enterprise' is defined in 18
U.S.C. § 1961(4) as including 'any individual, partnership, corporation,
association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals
associated in fact although not a legal entity.' ... The pattern of racketeering
activity is, on the other hand, a series of criminal acts as defined by the
statute. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1) (1976 ed., Supp. III). The former is proved by
evidence of an ongoing organization, formal or informal, and by evidence
that the various associates function as a continuing unit. The latter is proved
by evidence of the requisite number of acts of racketeering committed by
the participants in the enterprise.
Summary
The passage explains that RICO applies to both legitimate and illegitimate
enterprises and requires proof of both an "enterprise" and a "pattern of
racketeering activity." The definition of "racketeering activity" includes acts
indictable under certain provisions of Title 18, such as mail and wire fraud.
This supports the proposition that Morgan and Daniel's actions, if involving
fraudulent communications, could qualify as predicate acts under RICO.
Tabas v. Tabas, 47 F.3d 1280 (3rd Cir. 1995)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Third Circuit
Extract
Count I of the amended complaint alleges that, in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec.
1962(a), (b), and (c), the defendants conspired to defraud the Estate of its
equal share of Tabas Enterprises' income, to which it was entitled under the
partnership agreement, through a pattern of racketeering activity including
mail fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1341. ... The RICO statute defines a
'pattern' of racketeering activity as requiring 'at least two acts of
racketeering activity' within a ten year period. 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1961(5). The
statute also enumerates the offenses which constitute 'racketeering activity,'
including crimes that have traditionally been associated with the
transgressions of racketeers: murder, kidnapping, gambling, arson, robbery,

=== PAGE 14 ===

bribery, extortion, dealing in obscene matter, and dealing in narcotic or
other dangerous drugs. 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1961(1).
Summary
The court discusses the application of RICO in the context of mail fraud as a
predicate act. The passage highlights that a pattern of racketeering activity
under RICO requires at least two acts of racketeering activity, which can
include mail fraud. This supports the proposition that fraudulent
communications, such as those potentially involved in the preparation and
use of false court documents, could qualify as predicate acts under RICO.

U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
Held: A plaintiff asserting a RICO claim predicated on mail fraud need not
show, either as an element of its claim or as a prerequisite to establishing
proximate causation, that it relied on the defendant's alleged
misrepresentations. Pp. 2137 – 2145. (a) In 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c), RICO
provides a private right of action for treble damages to '[a]ny person injured
in his business or property by reason of a violation,' as pertinent here, of §
1962(c), which makes it 'unlawful for any person employed by or associated
with' a qualifying enterprise 'to conduct or participate ... in the conduct of
such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity,'
including 'mail fraud,' § 1961(1)(B). Mail fraud, in turn, occurs whenever a
person, 'having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to
defraud,' uses the mail 'for the purpose of executing such scheme or
artifice.' § 1341.
Summary
The passage from the Supreme Court decision clarifies that under RICO, a
plaintiff does not need to show reliance on the defendant's
misrepresentations to establish a claim predicated on mail fraud. This is
relevant because it supports the idea that acts involving fraudulent
communications, such as the preparation and use of false court documents,
can qualify as predicate acts of mail fraud under RICO. The decision
emphasizes that using the mail to execute a scheme to defraud is sufficient
to constitute mail fraud, which is a predicate act under RICO.
Inc v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Company, 492 U.S. 229, 109 S.Ct. 2893,
106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989)

=== PAGE 15 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
RICO's legislative history, however, establishes that Congress intended that
to prove a 'pattern of racketeering activity' a plaintiff or prosecutor must
show both 'relationship' and 'continuity'—that the racketeering predicates
are related, and that they either constitute or threaten long-term criminal
activity... 'Racketeering activity' is defined in RICO to mean 'any act or
threat involving' specified state-law crimes, any 'act' indictable under
various specified federal statutes, and certain federal 'offenses,' 18 U.S.C. §
1961(1)... But we suggested that RICO's expansive uses 'appear to be
primarily the result of the breadth of the predicate offenses, in particular the
inclusion of wire, mail, and securities fraud...'
Summary
RICO's definition of "racketeering activity" includes acts indictable under
federal statutes, such as mail and wire fraud. It also emphasizes the broad
application of RICO to various forms of criminal activity, including those that
involve fraudulent communications. This supports the proposition that
Morgan and Daniel's actions, if involving mail or wire fraud through the use
of false court documents, could qualify as predicate acts under RICO.
Westchester Cnty. Independence Party v. Astorino, 137 F.Supp.3d 586 (S.D.
N.Y. 2015)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of New York
Extract
With regard to the racketeering activity requirement, the statute provides a
list of criminal acts that can constitute predicate acts of racketeering. See
18 U.S.C. § 1961(a) (defining 'racketeering activity'). Notably, mail fraud
under 18 U.S.C. § 1341 and wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343 are predicate
acts of racketeering activity... 'The elements of wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. §
1343 are (i) a scheme to defraud (ii) to get money or property, (iii) furthered
by the use of interstate wires.'... 'The elements of mail fraud under 18 U.S.C.
§ 1341 are identical, except that mail fraud must be furthered by use of the
mails.'
Summary
Mail and wire fraud are explicitly listed as predicate acts of racketeering
under 18 U.S.C. § 1961(a). The passage provides the elements required to
establish mail and wire fraud, which include a scheme to defraud furthered
by the use of mails or interstate wires. This supports the proposition that
Morgan and Daniel's actions, if involving fraudulent communications, could
qualify as predicate acts under RICO.

Federal Ins. Co. v. Webne, 513 F.Supp.2d 921 (N.D. Ohio 2007)
U.S. District Court — Northern District of Ohio
Extract
Section 1964(c) of the federal RICO statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1961 et seq., creates
a civil cause of action for persons whose business or property has been
injured by organized, long-term criminal activity. To establish 'racketeering
activity,' the plaintiff must allege at least two predicate acts occurring within
a ten year time period. H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co., 492 U.S.
229, 237-38, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989). Here, plaintiff's RICO
claims includes allegations that National City and Sky committed acts of
mail and wire fraud, as defined in 18 U.S.C. §§ 1341, 1343; money
laundering in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1956; and racketeering in violation of
18 U.S.C. § 1952. Mail fraud, wire fraud, money laundering, and
racketeering are included in the definition of 'racketeering activity' in §
1961. See § 1961(1)(B) (listing violations of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1341, 1343, 1956,
and 1952). The elements of mail and wire fraud are: 1) a scheme to defraud
and 2) use of the mails, or of an interstate electronic communication,
respectively, in furtherance of the scheme.
Summary
Elements of mail and wire fraud, which involve a scheme to defraud and the
use of mail or electronic communications in furtherance of that scheme. This
directly supports the proposition that Morgan and Daniel's preparation and
use of false court documents could involve mail or wire fraud, qualifying as
predicate acts under RICO.

U.S. District Court — District of Puerto Rico
Extract
RICO liability breaks down to four essential elements: '(1) conduct (2) of an
enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity.' Sedima,
S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479, 496 (1985). The statute includes
numerous illegal acts in its definition of 'racketeering activity.' Home
Orthopedics, 781 F.3d at 528 (citing 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1)). Among these are
mail and wire fraud, 18 U.S.C. §§ 1341, 1343, which are the relevant
predicate acts in Norfe's amended complaint. Mail fraud 'occurs whenever a
person, 'having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to
defraud,' uses the mail 'for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice
or attempting so to do.' Bridge v. Phoenix Bond & Indem. Co., 553 U.S. 639,
647 (2008) (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 1341). 'The gravamen of the offense is the
scheme to defraud, and any mailing that is incident to an essential part of
the scheme satisfies the mailing element [] even if the mailing itself
contain[s] no false information.' Id. (citation and internal quotation marks
omitted). Similarly, 'to make out a civil claim under RICO by way of wire
fraud, a plaintiff must allege that a group of defendants 'engaged in a
scheme to defraud with the specific intent to defraud and that they used...
the interstate wires in furtherance of the scheme.'
Summary
RICO liability requires a pattern of racketeering activity, which includes mail
and wire fraud as defined under 18 U.S.C. §§ 1341 and 1343. The passage
explains that mail fraud involves using the mail to execute a scheme to
defraud, and wire fraud involves using interstate wires for the same
purpose. These definitions align with the proposition that Morgan and
Daniel's preparation and use of false court documents could involve mail or
wire fraud, thus qualifying as predicate acts under RICO.
Adler v. Berg Harmon Associates, 790 F.Supp. 1222 (S.D. N.Y. 1992)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of New York
Extract
RICO authorizes a private cause of action for 'any person injured in his
business or property by reason of a violation of Section 1962.' 18 U.S.C. §
1964(c). To state a claim for damages based upon a violation of Section
1962, a plaintiff must allege the following elements: '(1) that the defendant
(2) through the commission of two or more acts (3) constituting a
`pattern' (4) of `racketeering activity' (5) directly or indirectly invests in, or

maintains an interest in, or participates in (6) an `enterprise' (7) the
activities of which affect interstate or foreign commerce.' ... A 'pattern of
racketeering activity' is defined in § 1961 as 'at least two acts' of prohibited
conduct within a ten-year period. These 'predicate acts' are defined as
including specifically enumerated federal criminal offenses, such as
securities fraud, mail fraud, or wire fraud. 18 U.S.C. § 1961.
Summary
The passage outlines the elements necessary to establish a RICO claim,
including the requirement of a "pattern of racketeering activity" which can
include acts of mail fraud or wire fraud. This directly supports the
proposition that Morgan and Daniel's actions, if involving fraudulent
communications, could qualify as predicate acts under RICO.
Uselmann v. Pop, 495 F.Supp.3d 528 (E.D. Mich. 2020)
U.S. District Court — Eastern District of Michigan
Extract
RICO defines 'racketeering activity' to include a multitude of offenses that
are either 'chargeable' under certain state criminal laws or 'indictable'
under specified federal criminal laws. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1). Both the mail
fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1341, and the wire fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1343,
are listed as predicate racketeering offenses under RICO.
Summary
The passage from the judgment in "Uselmann v. Pop" provides a clear
explanation of what constitutes "racketeering activity" under RICO,
specifically highlighting that both mail fraud and wire fraud are included as
predicate offenses. This directly supports the proposition that the
preparation and use of false court documents, if involving fraudulent
communications, could qualify as predicate acts of mail or wire fraud under
RICO. The context of the passage is a legal analysis of RICO claims, which is
relevant to the proposition.

asserts the predicate acts of wire and mail fraud. To establish the predicate
act of mail fraud [the plaintiff] must allege &#34;(1) the existence of a
scheme or artifice to defraud or obtain money or property by false
pretenses, representations or promises, and (2) use of the United States
mails for the purpose of executing the scheme.&#34; (Citations omitted.)

Summary
Elements required to establish these predicate acts, which involve a scheme
to defraud and the use of mail or wire communications to execute the
scheme. This directly supports the proposition that Morgan and Daniel's

RICO is founded on the concept of racketeering activity.” RJR Nabisco, Inc.
v. European Cmty., 579 U.S. 325, 329 (2016). The RICO statute contains an
exhaustive list of predicate acts that qualify as “racketeering activity.” 18
U.S.C. § 1961(1). Included in the list is “any act which is indictable under”
18 U.S.C. § 1341 (mail fraud) or 18 U.S.C. § 1343 (wire fraud). 18 U.S.C. §

Summary
The passage from the judgment in "Doe v. Varsity Brands, LLC" provides a
clear reference to the definition of "racketeering activity" under the RICO
statute, specifically citing 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1). It explicitly includes acts
indictable under 18 U.S.C. § 1341 (mail fraud) and 18 U.S.C. § 1343 (wire
fraud) as predicate acts of racketeering activity. This directly supports the
proposition that the preparation and use of false court documents, if
involving fraudulent communications, could qualify as predicate acts of mail
or wire fraud under RICO.

1986)
U.S. District Court — District of Columbia

=== PAGE 20 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
Under the RICO statute, 'racketeering activity' is defined to include mail
fraud, 18 U.S.C. § 1341, and wire fraud, 18 U.S.C. § 1343. See 18 U.S.C. §
1961(1) (Supp.1985). Plaintiff's evidentiary submissions reveal frequent use
of the mail and the telephone by defendants. This evidence shows 'a scheme
to defraud and the mailing or transmission by wire of a document or
communication for the purpose of executing the scheme' and thus satisfies
the requirements of the mail and wire fraud statutes.
Summary
The passage from the case explains that under the RICO statute,
"racketeering activity" includes acts of mail and wire fraud. It further
illustrates that the use of mail and telephone communications to execute a
fraudulent scheme can satisfy the requirements of these fraud statutes. This
directly supports the proposition that Morgan and Daniel's preparation and
use of false court documents, if involving mail or electronic communications,
could qualify as predicate acts of mail or wire fraud under RICO.
U.S. v. Goldin Industries, Inc., 219 F.3d 1271 (11th Cir. 2000)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Eleventh Circuit
Extract
In the case of each RICO allegation, the government charged the Goldin
corporations with predicate acts, consisting of mail fraud, in violation of 18
U.S.C. §§ 1341 and 2. In short, each Goldin corporation was alleged to have
violated RICO by sending invoices and checks to the customers who had
been cheated in the Goldin Corporations' various schemes. The invoices and
checks fraudulently misrepresented the amounts actually due to the victims
of these schemes... A 'pattern' of racketeering activity requires that a
defendant commit two acts of racketeering activity within a ten-year period.
18 U.S.C. § 1961(5). Racketeering activity is defined as the commission of
certain federal crimes, including for our purposes here, the crime of mail
fraud pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 1341.
Summary
The passage discusses how the Goldin corporations were charged with RICO
violations based on predicate acts of mail fraud, which involved sending
fraudulent invoices and checks. This is directly relevant to the proposition
because it illustrates how fraudulent communications, such as those
potentially involved in the preparation and use of false court documents, can
constitute predicate acts under RICO. The passage also clarifies the
requirement of a "pattern" of racketeering activity, which aligns with the
proposition's mention of multiple acts.

1999)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
BOMC's 1962(c) claims also fail because there is no evidence that the Title
Companies or any of them engaged in a 'pattern of racketeering activity.'
RICO specifically defines 'racketeering activity' as any act that violates
specified state and federal crimes, including mail fraud, wire fraud, and
bank fraud. 18 U.S.C. 1961(1); Resolution Trust Corp., 998 F.2d at 1543. The
various acts of racketeering activity described in the statute are often
referred to as 'predicate acts' because they form the basis for liability under
RICO.
Summary
The definition of "racketeering activity" under RICO includes acts indictable
under federal crimes such as mail fraud and wire fraud. These acts are
considered "predicate acts" and form the basis for RICO liability. The
passage supports the proposition by confirming that fraudulent activities
involving mail or wire communications, such as the preparation and use of
false court documents, could qualify as predicate acts under RICO.
U.S. v. Massa, 740 F.2d 629 (8th Cir. 1984)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Eighth Circuit
Extract
The mail fraud statute prohibits the use of the mails 'for the purpose of
executing' a scheme to defraud. To come within the statute '[i]t is not
necessary that the scheme contemplated the use of the mails as an essential
element.' Pereira v. United States, 347 U.S. 1, 8, 74 S.Ct. 358, 362, 98 L.Ed.
435 (1954). Rather, it is enough if the mailing is 'incident to an essential part
of the scheme.' Id., quoted in United States v. Lebovitz, 669 F.2d 894, 896
(3d Cir.), cert. denied, 456 U.S. 929, 102 S.Ct. 1979, 72 L.Ed.2d 446 (1982).
Summary
For an act to qualify as mail fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1341, it is not necessary
for the use of mails to be an essential element of the fraudulent scheme.
Instead, it suffices if the mailing is incident to an essential part of the
scheme. This interpretation supports the proposition that Morgan and
Daniel's use of false court documents, if involving mail or electronic
communications, could be considered mail or wire fraud, thus qualifying as
predicate acts under RICO.

U.S. v. Reifler, 446 F.3d 65 (2nd Cir. 2006)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Second Circuit
Extract
In order to prove a RICO offense, for example, the government is required to
show that there was a '`pattern of racketeering activity,'` 18 U.S.C. §
1961(5), which is interpreted to mean '`multiple racketeering predicates—
which can be part of a single `scheme'—that are related and that amount to,
or threaten the likelihood of, continued criminal activity,'` United States v.
Coiro, 922 F.2d 1008, 1016 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 501 U.S. 1217, 111 S.Ct.
2826, 115 L.Ed.2d 996 (1991); see, e.g., H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell
Telephone Co., 492 U.S. 229, 239, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989);
United States v. Indelicato... Finally, Laken and Black contend that their
convictions of RICO conspiracy should be reversed on the ground that, in
order to establish a RICO violation, the government was required to, but did
not, prove the commission of at least two predicate acts of racketeering
activity. In Count One, the redacted indictment alleged three racketeering
act ('RA') predicates. RA-1 alleged both wire fraud and kickbacks with
respect to Local 400, alleging that a finding that either crime had been
committed would suffice to establish RA-1; RA-2 alleged wire fraud with
respect to the DEA; and RA-3 alleged both wire fraud and kickbacks with
respect to Local 137, alleging that a finding that either of those crimes had
been committed would suffice to establish RA-3.
Summary
The passage explains that to prove a RICO offense, the government must
demonstrate a pattern of racketeering activity, which involves multiple
related predicate acts that threaten continued criminal activity. The passage
specifically mentions wire fraud as a predicate act, which aligns with the
proposition that the preparation and use of false court documents could

Summary
The passage from 18 U.S.C. § 1343 defines wire fraud as involving a scheme
to defraud using wire communications. If Morgan and Daniel used electronic
communications to transmit false court documents as part of a fraudulent
scheme, this could constitute wire fraud. Since wire fraud is a predicate act
under RICO, their actions could be considered racketeering activity under
18 U.S.C. § 1961(1).
18 U.S.C. § 1341 18 U.S.C. § 1341 Frauds and Swindles
Extract
Whoever, having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to
defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent
pretenses, representations, or promises... for the purpose of executing such
scheme or artifice or attempting so to do, places in any post office or
authorized depository for mail matter, any matter or thing whatever to be
sent or delivered by the Postal Service, or deposits or causes to be deposited
any matter or thing whatever to be sent or delivered by any private or
commercial interstate carrier... shall be fined under this title or imprisoned
not more than 20 years, or both.
Summary
18 U.S.C. § 1341 defines mail fraud as involving any scheme to defraud using
the postal service or private carriers. This statute is relevant to the
proposition because it establishes that using mail to execute a fraudulent
scheme, such as sending false court documents, constitutes mail fraud.
Since mail fraud is a predicate act under RICO, this supports the proposition
that Morgan and Daniel's actions could qualify as racketeering activity.

Summary
The definition of "racketeering activity" under 18 U.S.C. § 1961 includes acts
indictable under specific provisions of Title 18, such as mail fraud (18 U.S.C.
§ 1341) and wire fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343). This supports the proposition that
the preparation and use of false court documents, if involving fraudulent

communications, could qualify as predicate acts of mail or wire fraud under
RICO.
18 U.S.C. § 1962 18 U.S.C. § 1962 Prohibited Activities
Extract
It shall be unlawful for any person through a pattern of racketeering activity
or through collection of an unlawful debt to acquire or maintain, directly or
indirectly, any interest in or control of any enterprise which is engaged in, or
the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce.
Summary
The passage from 18 U.S.C. § 1962 outlines unlawful activities related to
racketeering, specifically prohibiting the acquisition or maintenance of
control over an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. This is
relevant to the proposition because it establishes the legal framework under
which acts of mail and wire fraud, as part of a pattern of racketeering
activity, can be prosecuted. The preparation and use of false court
documents, if involving fraudulent communications, could constitute such a
pattern, thereby supporting the application of RICO provisions.

Weston, Brandon - 2014-09-22
Extract
Because the character, language, and scope of the mail and wire fraud
statutes are similar, legal analysis and case law on mail fraud are equally
applicable to wire fraud... For a mail or wire fraud offense, the government
must show beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant perpetrated: (i) a
scheme to defraud by means of a material deception; (ii) with the intent to
defraud; (iii) while using the mails, private commercial carriers, and/or
wires in furtherance of that scheme; (iv) that did result or would have
resulted in the loss of money or property or the deprivation of honest
services.
Summary
The elements of mail and wire fraud include a scheme to defraud, intent to
defraud, and the use of mail or wire communications in furtherance of the
scheme. These elements align with the proposition that Morgan and Daniel's
actions could qualify as predicate acts of mail or wire fraud under RICO, as
their preparation and use of false court documents likely involved fraudulent
communications.

Summary
The passage explains that mail and wire fraud are common predicate acts
under RICO. It specifies that the use of mail or wire communications to
execute a fraudulent scheme constitutes a violation of the respective
statutes (18 U.S.C. § 1341 and § 1343). This directly supports the proposition
that Morgan and Daniel's preparation and use of false court documents, if
involving mail or electronic communications, could qualify as predicate acts
of mail or wire fraud under RICO.

enumerates various predicate acts that can establish a pattern of
racketeering. These predicate acts encompass a wide range of criminal
activities, including but not limited to mail fraud, wire fraud, bribery,
extortion, and money laundering. By citing this section, one can lay the
foundation for discussing the elements that constitute racketeering under
RICO. Mail and wire fraud. Among the predicate acts specified in § 1961(1),
mail fraud and wire fraud hold particular significance due to their
prevalence in white-collar crimes and financial fraud schemes. Mail fraud
involves the use of the postal service to execute a fraudulent scheme, while
wire fraud pertains to fraudulent activities conducted via electronic
communication channels.
Summary

mail and wire fraud as significant predicate acts. These acts are relevant to
the proposition because the preparation and use of false court documents
likely involved fraudulent communications, which could qualify as mail or
wire fraud. The passage supports the idea that such fraudulent activities can
be considered under RICO, thus supporting the proposition.
