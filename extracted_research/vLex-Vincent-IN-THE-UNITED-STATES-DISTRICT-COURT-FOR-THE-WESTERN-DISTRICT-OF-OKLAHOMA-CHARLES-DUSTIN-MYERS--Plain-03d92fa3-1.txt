Question
IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT
OF OKLAHOMA CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, Plaintiff, v. DANIEL KENNETH
BRANTHOOVER & MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS, Defendants. § § § § Case
No. CIV-24-1311-R § § § § RULE 59(e) MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION
The Court’s order granting dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) rested on the
conclusion that the alleged RICO enterprise ceased to function once Plaintiff
was ordered to vacate the home, treating the scheme as a single, narrow
effort with a discrete goal and no ongoing threat. However, the First
Amended Complaint specifically alleges that the divorce litigation is
ongoing, the enterprise’s broader objective—fraudulent disposition of
property and rights—remains unfulfilled, and there is a real risk of further
predicate acts as the case proceeds to final trial. Under binding Supreme
Court and Tenth Circuit authority, these facts plausibly support a claim of
open-ended continuity and a pattern of racketeering activity, which the
Court did not address. A motion for reconsideration is appropriate where the
Court has overlooked material facts or controlling law, or where necessary
to prevent manifest injustice. Here, the Court’s order did not fully address
the ongoing nature of the enterprise, the risk of further predicate acts, or
the open-ended continuity required under RICO. Reconsideration should be
GRANTED to allow the case to proceed on the merits, as the well-pleaded
allegations in the First Amended Complaint are sufficient to survive a
motion to dismiss under the applicable legal standards. I. Background and
Relevant Law A. RICO Pattern Requirement: Relationship and Continuity 1.
To state a civil RICO claim, a plaintiff must allege that the defendant
conducted the affairs of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering
activity, which requires at least two predicate acts that are both related and
continuous (George v. Urban Settlement Servs., 833 F.3d 1242, 1248 (10th
Cir. 2016); Johnson v. Heath, 56 F.4th 851, 858 (10th Cir. 2022)). The
Supreme Court in H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229 (1989)
clarified that “continuity” can be either closed-ended (a series of related acts
over a substantial period) or open-ended (a threat of continuing criminal
activity into the future). The Tenth Circuit has consistently applied this
“continuity plus relationship” test (Resolution Trust Corp. v. Stone, 998 F.2d
1534, 1543 (10th Cir. 1993); Tal v. Hogan, 453 F.3d 1244, 1267–68 (10th Cir.
2006)). 2. The “relationship” prong is satisfied when the predicate acts have
similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods, or are otherwise
interrelated and not isolated events (Schrag v. Dinges, 788 F.Supp. 1543,
1556 (D. Kan. 1992)). The “continuity” prong is more stringent and can be
established in two ways: (1) closed-ended continuity, which requires a series
of related predicate acts over a substantial period, or (2) open-ended
continuity, which requires a threat of continued racketeering activity into
the future (Resolution Trust Corp. v. Stone, 998 F.2d 1534, 1543 (10th Cir.
1993); H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 241–42; Independent Drug Wholesalers Group,
Inc. v. Denton, 833 F.Supp. 1507, 1512 (D. Kan. 1993)). 3. Open-ended
continuity may be shown by facts indicating that the predicate acts are part
of an ongoing entity’s regular way of doing business or that there is a threat
of repetition because the enterprise’s objective is unfulfilled (Watchous
Enterprrises, LLC v. Pac. Nat'l Capital, LLC, Case No. 16-1432-JTM (D. Kan.

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Jul 25, 2018). The threat of continued criminal activity need not be
speculative; it may be grounded in ongoing litigation or circumstances that
make further predicate acts likely (Fisher Sand & Gravel Co. v. FNF Constr.,
Inc., No. 10-cv-0635 RB/SMV (D. N.M. Mar 27, 2013); Suddath v. Oklahoma
Homebuilders, LLC, CIV-24-745-SLP (W.D. Okla. Nov 08, 2024)). 4. The
Tenth Circuit has held numerous times that even where a scheme targets a
single victim, if the plan contemplates open-ended fraudulent activity and
does not have a single goal that, when achieved, will bring the activity to an
end, continuity may be satisfied (Torwest DBC, Inc. v. Dick, 810 F.2d 925,
928 (10th Cir. 1987); Edwards v. First Nat. Bank, Bartlesville, Oklahoma,
872 F.2d 347, 351 (10th Cir. 1989); Condict v. Condict, 826 F.2d 923, 927
(10th Cir. 1987)). Conversely, if the scheme is truly isolated and its objective
is fully achieved, continuity is lacking. Id., 815 F.2d 579, 581 (10th Cir.
1987). 5. At the motion to dismiss stage, the Court must accept all well-
pleaded factual allegations as true and draw all reasonable inferences in the
plaintiff’s favor (George v. Urban Settlement Servs., 833 F.3d 1242, 1248
(10th Cir. 2016)). The question is not whether the plaintiff will ultimately
prevail, but whether the complaint states a plausible claim for relief. II.
Analysis B. The Court’s Order and Its Reasoning 6. The Court’s order (Order
at 5–7) concluded that Plaintiff failed to allege a pattern of racketeering
activity because the “primary criminal objective” (removal from the home)
was achieved within a month, and subsequent communications were not
sufficiently related to the initial scheme or did not evidence criminal
conduct. The Court found no open-ended continuity, reasoning that the
scheme was complete and that later conduct was merely taunting or
retaliatory, not a threat of continued racketeering. C. Ongoing Nature of the
Enterprise and Unfulfilled Objective 7. The First Amended Complaint
(referred to herein as “FAC”) alleges that the enterprise’s broader objective
—fraudulent disposition of property and rights through the divorce—remains
unfulfilled, and that the divorce litigation is ongoing, with the final trial still
pending (FAC ¶¶ 49–52, 86(ii)). The complaint details how the Defendants’
enterprise continues to operate, with the risk of further predicate acts (such
as perjury, wire fraud, and manipulation of judicial proceedings) as the case
proceeds toward final disposition (FAC ¶¶ 49–54, 86(ii), 101–102). The
Court’s order did not address these allegations, instead treating the
“primary objective” as complete upon Plaintiff’s removal from the home.
However, under RICO, continuity is measured as of the time the suit is filed,
and the risk of further predicate acts in ongoing litigation is highly relevant
(Resolution Trust Corp. v. Stone, 998 F.2d 1534, 1543 (10th Cir. 1993);
Fisher Sand & Gravel Co. v. FNF Constr., Inc., No. 10-cv-0635 RB/SMV (D.
N.M. Mar 27, 2013)). D. Open-Ended Continuity: Threat of Continued
Criminal Activity 8. The Supreme Court and Tenth Circuit have made clear
that open-ended continuity exists where the predicate acts pose a threat of
continued criminal activity, especially where the enterprise’s business is not
complete and further acts are likely (H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co.,
492 U.S. 229, 241–42 (1989); Tal v. Hogan, 453 F.3d 1244, 1267 (10th Cir.
2006); Suddath v. Oklahoma Homebuilders, LLC, CIV-24-745-SLP (W.D. Okla.
Nov 08, 2024)). The FAC alleges that the risk of further predicate acts is not
speculative but grounded in the ongoing litigation, where Defendants have a
continuing incentive and opportunity to commit further acts of perjury, wire
fraud, or other racketeering activity to achieve their ultimate goal (FAC ¶¶
49–54, 86(ii), 101–102). The order’s focus on the completion of the “primary

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
objective” ignores the reality that the enterprise’s broader goal—fraudulent
disposition of property through the divorce—remains unachieved, and the
litigation is still pending. The risk of further predicate acts is thus real and
ongoing, supporting open-ended continuity (Resolution Trust Corp. v. Stone,
998 F.2d 1534, 1543 (10th Cir. 1993); Fisher Sand & Gravel Co. v. FNF
Constr., Inc., No. 10-cv-0635 RB/SMV (D. N.M. Mar 27, 2013). E.
Relationship and Pattern 9. The FAC also pleads that the predicate acts are
related: they share the same purpose (fraudulent deprivation of Plaintiff’s
property rights), involve the same participants (Myers and Branthoover),
target the same victim, and employ similar methods (deception,
misrepresentation, manipulation of legal processes) (FAC ¶¶ 49–54, 85,
101). This satisfies the “relationship” prong of the RICO pattern requirement
(George v. Urban Settlement Servs., 833 F.3d 1242, 1248 (10th Cir. 2016)).
F. The Law Does Not Require Multiple Victims or Schemes 10. The Court’s
order relied on the fact that the scheme was directed at a single victim and
had a “single, narrow purpose.” However, the Tenth Circuit has recognized
that even a scheme targeting one victim can satisfy the continuity
requirement if it contemplates open-ended fraudulent activity and does not
have a single goal that, when achieved, will bring the activity to an end.
(Torwest DBC, Inc. v. Dick, 810 F.2d 925, 928 (10th Cir. 1987); Edwards v.
First Nat. Bank, Bartlesville, Oklahoma, 872 F.2d 347, 351 (10th Cir. 1989);
Condict v. Condict, 826 F.2d 923, 927 (10th Cir. 1987)). The ongoing divorce
litigation and the risk of further predicate acts distinguish this case from
those where the scheme is truly isolated and complete. G. The Totality of
Circumstances 11. Courts are to consider the totality of the circumstances,
not just the timing of the initial predicate acts, in assessing continuity
(Fisher Sand & Gravel Co. v. FNF Constr., Inc., No. 10-cv-0635 RB/SMV (D.
N.M. Mar 27, 2013)). Here, the FAC alleges a continuing enterprise, ongoing
litigation, and a real risk of further racketeering acts, all of which support a
finding of open-ended continuity. H. Application to the Complaint and Order
12. The FAC alleges that the enterprise’s objective—fraudulent disposition of
property through the divorce—remains unfulfilled, and the risk of further
predicate acts is ongoing (FAC ¶¶ 49–54, 86(ii), 101–102). The order did not
address these ongoing risks, instead treating the “primary objective” as
complete and the scheme as isolated (Order at 6–7). Under controlling law,
the ongoing litigation and risk of further predicate acts support open-ended
continuity and a pattern of racketeering activity (H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern
Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 241–42 (1989); Resolution Trust Corp. v. Stone,
998 F.2d 1534, 1543 (10th Cir. 1993); Tal v. Hogan, 453 F.3d 1244, 1267
(10th Cir. 2006)). IV. Standard for Reconsideration 13. A motion for
reconsideration under Rule 59(e) is appropriate where the court has
overlooked material facts or controlling law, or where necessary to prevent
manifest injustice (Servants of Paraclete v. Does, 204 F.3d 1005, 1012 (10th
Cir. 2000), not in table but widely cited in Tenth Circuit). Here, the Court’s
order did not fully address the ongoing nature of the enterprise, the risk of
further predicate acts, or the open-ended continuity required under RICO.
Reconsideration should be sought to allow the case to proceed on the
merits, as the well-pleaded allegations in the First Amended Complaint are
sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss under the applicable legal
standards. I. Pleading Standard 14. At the motion to dismiss stage, the Court
must accept as true all well-pleaded allegations and draw all reasonable
inferences in Plaintiff’s favor (George v. Urban Settlement Servs., 833 F.3d

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
1242, 1248 (10th Cir. 2016)). The Court’s order (Order at 5–6) failed to do
so, instead characterizing the ongoing conduct as unrelated or merely
retaliatory, without crediting the FAC’s specific allegations that these acts
are part of the same enterprise and serve the same fraudulent purpose. The
Court also failed to recognize that the pattern requirement is not defeated
simply because the initial dispossession occurred; the ongoing risk of further
racketeering, as pleaded, is sufficient to establish open-ended continuity (Tal
v. Hogan, 453 F.3d at 1267–68; RICO. V. Exceptions 15. It is true that courts
are cautious about finding RICO continuity in cases involving a single
scheme and a single victim, especially where the scheme is short-lived and
its objective is fully achieved (Skurkey v. Daniel, No. CIV-22-496-R, 2023 WL
101946, at *6 (W.D. Okla. Jan. 4, 2023)). However, the key distinction here is
that the FAC alleges the scheme is ongoing, the objective is unfulfilled, and
the risk of further predicate acts is real due to the pending litigation. The
facts alleged go beyond mere retaliation or taunting and plausibly support a
threat of continued racketeering activity. 16. It is noteworthy to mention the
negative treatment of Condict v. Condict, 815 F.2d 579 (10th Cir. 1987) in
Maxwell v. Wilson, 766 P.2d 909 (N.M. 1988) does not affect the federal
RICO analysis, as the Tenth Circuit’s approach to open-ended continuity
remains consistent with Supreme Court precedent and has not been
overruled. VI. Conclusion 17. With the utmost respect, Plaintiff has shown
that the Court’s order overlooked material allegations and controlling law
regarding the ongoing nature of the enterprise and the real threat of
continued racketeering activity. The FAC alleges that the enterprise’s
objective is unfulfilled, the divorce litigation is ongoing, and the risk of
further predicate acts remains as the final trial approaches. Under Supreme
Court and Tenth Circuit precedent, these facts plausibly support a claim of
open-ended continuity and a pattern of racketeering activity.
Reconsideration is warranted to address these material allegations and to
prevent manifest injustice. Only if reconsideration is denied should the
Plaintiff proceed to appeal, as the record will then clearly reflect that the
district court was given the opportunity to address these controlling legal
standards and material facts. VII. Prayer WHEREFORE, all promises
considered, Plaintiff CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS respectfully asks this court
to provide the following relief: 1. Grant the motion for reconsideration; 2.
Vacate or set aside the order of dismissal signed on August 28, 2025; 3.
Require the defendants to file a response to the complaint; 4. Allow the
matter to proceed to discovery; 5. Grant any further relief that the court
deems necessary given the circumstances. Respectfully submitted,

required when the plaintiff can prove that the state court forum is
incompetent or biased, and therefore incapable of fairly adjudicating federal
claims, particularly in the context of RICO allegations? What is the standard
for finding an inadequate state forum in the Tenth Circuit?
Answer (Tenth Circuit)
Short response
Federal court abstention under the Younger doctrine is not required if the
plaintiff can prove that the state court forum is incompetent or biased and
thus incapable of fairly adjudicating federal claims, including RICO
allegations. In the Tenth Circuit, the standard for finding an inadequate
state forum is high: the plaintiff must provide clear evidence of bad faith,
harassment, or extraordinary circumstances that prevent a full and fair
hearing of federal claims in state court.
Summary
The Younger abstention doctrine generally requires federal courts to refrain
from interfering with ongoing state judicial proceedings when those
proceedings implicate important state interests and provide an adequate
forum for federal claims. However, if a plaintiff can demonstrate that the
state forum is so incompetent or biased that it cannot fairly adjudicate
federal claims—such as by showing proven harassment, bad faith, or other
extraordinary circumstances—then abstention is not required, and the
federal court may proceed.
In the Tenth Circuit, courts presume that state forums are adequate unless
state law clearly bars the presentation of federal claims or there is
compelling evidence of bias or incompetence. Mere dissatisfaction with state
court outcomes or procedures is insufficient; the plaintiff bears a heavy
burden to show, with more than mere allegations, that the state court is
incapable of providing a fair hearing on federal issues. This standard applies
equally in the context of RICO allegations, and the presence of such claims
does not, by itself, override the abstention doctrine.

Background and Relevant Law
The Younger Abstention Doctrine
The Younger abstention doctrine, originating from the Supreme Court’s
decision in Younger v. Harris, directs federal courts to abstain from
interfering with ongoing state proceedings when three conditions are met:
(1) there is an ongoing state judicial proceeding, (2) the proceeding
implicates important state interests, and (3) the state forum provides an
adequate opportunity to raise federal claims, as established in Ray v. Okla.
Dep't of Corr., CIV-20-0078-F (W.D. Okla. Jan 30, 2020), Winn v. Cook, 945 F.
3d 1253 (10th Cir. 2019), and Brown ex rel. Brown v. Day, 555 F.3d 882
(10th Cir. 2009).
The doctrine is rooted in principles of comity and federalism, seeking to
respect the autonomy of state courts and avoid duplicative litigation or
inconsistent judgments. Once the three conditions are satisfied, abstention
is generally mandatory unless an exception applies (Green v. Lavick, No.
CIV-18-631-SLP (W.D. Okla. Aug 10, 2018)).
Exceptions to Younger Abstention
There are recognized exceptions to the Younger doctrine. Federal courts
may intervene if the plaintiff can show: (1) proven harassment, (2)
prosecutions undertaken in bad faith, or (3) other extraordinary
circumstances where irreparable injury is both great and immediate
(Hamilton v. Wyandotte Cnty. Dist. Court, 25-3098-JWL (D. Kan. Jun 05,
2025); Aurelio v. Mullin, 24-1120 (10th Cir. Oct 04, 2024); Phelps v.
Hamilton, 122 F.3d 885 (10th Cir. 1997)). The burden to establish these
exceptions is heavy and requires more than mere allegations of bias or
dissatisfaction with the state process (McLain v. Sedgwick Cnty. Sheriff's
Office, 25-4036-JWB-BGS (D. Kan. Apr 28, 2025); Wiltse v. Smith, No. 17-
CV-01022-MV-KBM (D. N.M. Mar 27, 2018)).
Adequacy of the State Forum
The adequacy of the state forum is a central requirement for Younger
abstention. The Tenth Circuit has consistently held that a state forum is
presumed adequate unless state law clearly bars the presentation of federal
claims or there is compelling evidence that the state court is unable or
unwilling to provide a fair hearing (Crown Point I v. Intermountain Rural
Elec. Ass'n, 319 F.3d 1211 (10th Cir. 2003); JB a child v. Valdez, 186 F.3d
1280 (10th Cir. 1999)). The opportunity to raise federal claims in state court,
not the likelihood of success, is the relevant standard (Winn v. Cook, 945 F.
3d 1253 (10th Cir. 2019)).
If a plaintiff alleges that the state forum is incompetent or biased, the court
requires clear, specific evidence—such as a showing that state procedural
law bars federal claims, or that the state court has engaged in proven
harassment or bad faith (Seneca-Cayuga Tribe of Oklahoma v. State of Okl.
ex rel. Thompson, 874 F.2d 709 (10th Cir. 1989); Weitzel v. Div. Occup. &

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Prof'l Licensing, 240 F.3d 871 (10th Cir. 2001)). Dissatisfaction with the
outcome, adverse rulings, or even repeated denials of relief do not, by
themselves, establish inadequacy (Webb v. Martin Cnty., Civil Action 24-
cv-02705-NYW-MDB (D. Colo. Apr 21, 2025)).
Analysis
Application to RICO Allegations and the Present Scenario
The presence of RICO allegations, even if they implicate the integrity of
ongoing state proceedings, does not automatically exempt a case from
Younger abstention. The Tenth Circuit and district courts within the circuit
have repeatedly applied the Younger doctrine to federal claims, including
those under RICO, so long as the three core requirements are met (Ray v.
Okla. Dep't of Corr., CIV-20-0078-F (W.D. Okla. Jan 30, 2020); Hamilton v.
Wyandotte Cnty. Dist. Court, 25-3098-JWL (D. Kan. Jun 05, 2025)). The key
inquiry is whether the state forum is adequate to address the federal issues
raised.
In the scenario described, the plaintiff alleges that the state court is
incompetent or biased, citing sua sponte orders, lack of response to
mandamus petitions, and orders that do not bear the plaintiff’s signature
despite stating otherwise. However, the Tenth Circuit requires more than
allegations or dissatisfaction with state court procedures. The plaintiff must
demonstrate, with specific evidence, that the state court is incapable of
providing a fair hearing on federal claims (McLain v. Sedgwick Cnty.
Sheriff's Office, 25-4036-JWB-BGS (D. Kan. Apr 28, 2025); Wiltse v. Smith,
No. 17-CV-01022-MV-KBM (D. N.M. Mar 27, 2018)).
For example, in Winn v. Cook, 945 F.3d 1253 (10th Cir. 2019), the court held
that unless state law clearly bars federal claims, the forum is presumed
adequate. Similarly, in JB a child v. Valdez, 186 F.3d 1280 (10th Cir. 1999),
the court emphasized that abstention is not required if extraordinary
circumstances render the state court unable to provide a full and fair
hearing, but the burden is on the plaintiff to prove this.
The fact that a plaintiff’s appeals or mandamus petitions have been denied,
even repeatedly, does not by itself establish incompetence or bias. Courts
have held that adverse outcomes or procedural dissatisfaction do not equate
to an inadequate forum (Webb v. Martin Cnty., Civil Action 24-cv-02705-
NYW-MDB (D. Colo. Apr 21, 2025)). Instead, the plaintiff must show that
state law or state court conduct has actually prevented the presentation or
fair adjudication of federal claims.
Standard for Finding an Inadequate State Forum in the
Tenth Circuit
The Tenth Circuit’s standard for finding an inadequate state forum is
stringent. The plaintiff must show that state procedural law clearly bars the
presentation of federal claims, or that the state court is so biased or
incompetent that it cannot provide a fair hearing (Crown Point I v.

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Intermountain Rural Elec. Ass'n, 319 F.3d 1211 (10th Cir. 2003); Seneca-
Cayuga Tribe of Oklahoma v. State of Okl. ex rel. Thompson, 874 F.2d 709
(10th Cir. 1989)). This is a “heavy burden,” and courts presume adequacy
unless there is unambiguous evidence to the contrary (Wiltse v. Smith, No.
17-CV-01022-MV-KBM (D. N.M. Mar 27, 2018)).
The exceptions to Younger abstention—bad faith, harassment, or
extraordinary circumstances—are interpreted narrowly. For example, in 
Hamilton v. Wyandotte Cnty. Dist. Court, 25-3098-JWL (D. Kan. Jun 05,
2025), the court reiterated that more than mere allegations are required;
the plaintiff must provide concrete evidence of harassment or bad faith.
Similarly, Phelps v. Hamilton, 59 F.3d 1058 (10th Cir. 1995) explained that
the gate for federal intervention is “very narrow,” reflecting the strong
policy of federalism and respect for state court processes.
What Constitutes “Extraordinary Circumstances” or
“Proven Inadequacy”?
Courts have found extraordinary circumstances only in rare cases, such as
when state officials are shown to be acting in bad faith, when there is a
pattern of harassment, or when state law or procedure clearly precludes the
presentation of federal claims (Aurelio v. Mullin, 24-1120 (10th Cir. Oct 04,
2024); Weitzel v. Div. Occup. & Prof'l Licensing, 240 F.3d 871 (10th Cir.
2001)). The mere fact that a state judge issues orders sua sponte, or that
appellate courts issue per curiam denials, does not, without more, establish
incompetence or bias.
In Wiltse v. Smith, No. 17-CV-01022-MV-KBM (D. N.M. Mar 27, 2018), the
court held that dissatisfaction with legal representation or the state court’s
handling of a case does not amount to extraordinary circumstances.
Similarly, in Webb v. Martin Cnty., Civil Action 24-cv-02705-NYW-MDB (D.
Colo. Apr 21, 2025), the court found that denial of relief in state court does
not demonstrate an inadequate forum.
To overcome abstention, the plaintiff must show that the state court is
unable or unwilling to adjudicate federal claims at all, not merely that it has
ruled against the plaintiff or failed to provide the relief sought (JB a child v.
Valdez, 186 F.3d 1280 (10th Cir. 1999)). This could be shown, for example,
by evidence that the state court has refused to consider federal claims, has
acted with clear bias, or that state law explicitly bars federal claims.
RICO Allegations and Federal Intervention
The presence of RICO allegations does not, by itself, create an exception to
Younger abstention. Federal courts have applied the doctrine to RICO
claims, provided the state forum is adequate (Torwest DBC, Inc. v. Dick, 810
F.2d 925 (10th Cir. 1987)). The key inquiry remains whether the state court
can fairly adjudicate the federal issues. If the plaintiff can show that the
state court is incapable of doing so, abstention is not required, and the
federal court may proceed.

=== PAGE 9 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Secondary materials confirm that the exceptions to Younger—bad faith,
untimely or biased proceedings, or patently unconstitutional laws—are all
grounded in the federal judiciary’s equitable role, but federal courts should
assume state courts are competent unless there is clear evidence to the
contrary (ABSTAINING EQUITABLY. (2022)).
Exceptions and Caveats
The exceptions to Younger abstention are interpreted narrowly. The plaintiff
must provide specific, compelling evidence of incompetence, bias, bad faith,
or harassment. Adverse rulings, procedural irregularities, or dissatisfaction
with the state process are not enough. The federal court will presume the
adequacy of the state forum unless state law clearly bars federal claims or
there is unambiguous evidence of extraordinary circumstances.
If the plaintiff cannot meet this high burden, the federal court must abstain,
even if the plaintiff believes the state court is acting unjustly. Only in rare
cases—where the state court is shown to be fundamentally incapable of
providing a fair hearing—will the federal court intervene.
Conclusion
In summary, federal court abstention under the Younger doctrine is not
required if the plaintiff can prove that the state court forum is incompetent
or biased and thus incapable of fairly adjudicating federal claims, including
RICO allegations. In the Tenth Circuit, the standard for finding an
inadequate state forum is stringent: the plaintiff must provide clear, specific
evidence of bad faith, harassment, or extraordinary circumstances that
prevent a full and fair hearing of federal claims in state court. Mere
dissatisfaction with state court outcomes or procedures is insufficient.
Unless this high burden is met, the federal court must abstain and allow the
state proceedings to continue.

Extract
Because Plaintiff is a pretrial detainee subject to ongoing state criminal
proceedings, this Court must abstain from exercising jurisdiction over this
matter under the doctrine of Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37 (1971). Federal
court abstention is required when three conditions are met: (1) there are
ongoing state proceedings; (2) the state proceedings provide an adequate
forum to hear Petitioner’s federal claims; and (3) the state proceedings
implicate important state interests. Chapman v. Oklahoma, 472 F.3d 747,
749 (10th Cir. 2006).

Summary
Conditions under which federal court abstention is required under the
Younger doctrine: ongoing state proceedings, an adequate state forum for
federal claims, and important state interests. The passage implies that if the
state forum is inadequate, abstention may not be required. However, the
passage does not provide a detailed standard for determining inadequacy,
only that the state proceedings must provide an adequate forum.
Eagle Air Med Corp. v. Colorado Bd. of Health, 570 F.Supp.2d 1289 (D. Colo.
2008)
U.S. District Court — District of Colorado
Extract
Under the Younger abstention doctrine, a federal court must refrain from
exercising jurisdiction 'when the federal proceedings would (1) interfere
with an ongoing state judicial proceeding (2) that implicates important state
interests and (3) that affords an adequate, opportunity to raise the federal
claims.' J.B. ex rel. Hart v. Valdez, 186 F.3d 1280, 1291 (10th Cir. 1999).
Summary
Three requirements for Younger abstention: interference with an ongoing
state proceeding, the implication of important state interests, and the
adequacy of the state forum to raise federal claims. The adequacy of the
state forum is crucial, as it must provide an opportunity to raise federal
claims. If the state forum is proven to be incompetent or biased, it may not
meet this requirement, potentially making Younger abstention
inappropriate.

the state proceedings are ongoing; (2) the state proceedings implicate
important state interests; and (3) the state proceedings afford an adequate
opportunity to present the federal constitutional challenges. Phelps, 122 F.

Summary
The Younger doctrine requires federal courts to abstain from interfering
with ongoing state proceedings unless there are extraordinary or special
circumstances. The Tenth Circuit has established that abstention is
appropriate if the state proceedings are ongoing, implicate important state
interests, and provide an adequate opportunity to present federal
constitutional challenges. The passage does not specifically address the
standard for finding an inadequate state forum, but it implies that the
adequacy of the state forum is a key consideration in determining whether
abstention is appropriate.
Winn v. Cook, 945 F.3d 1253 (10th Cir. 2019)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
Under the Younger abstention doctrine, federal courts are to abstain from
exercising jurisdiction to interfere with state proceedings when the
following three requirements are met: (1) there is an ongoing state criminal,
civil, or administrative proceeding, (2) the state court provides an adequate
forum to hear the claims raised in the federal complaint, and (3) the state
proceedings involve important state interests, matters which traditionally
look to state law for their resolution or implicate separately articulated state
policies. Chapman v. Oklahoma, 472 F.3d 747, 749 (10th Cir. 2006). All three
requirements are satisfied here. First, the parties do not dispute that there
is an ongoing state criminal proceeding. With regard to the second factor,
'unless state law clearly bars the interposition of the federal statutory and
constitutional claims,' a plaintiff typically has 'an adequate opportunity to
raise federal claims in state court.' Crown Point I, LLC v. Intermountain
Rural Elec. Ass'n, 319 F.3d 1211, 1215 (10th Cir. 2003) (brackets and
internal quotation marks omitted). Applicant offers no reason to think that
Oklahoma state courts would not provide an adequate forum to review his
claim, nor can we discern one. Indeed, the state trial court conducted an
evidentiary hearing on the claim. Younger requires only the availability of an
adequate state-court forum, not a favorable result in the state forum.
Summary
Unless state law clearly bars federal claims, the state forum is typically
considered adequate.

Summary
Conditions under which the Younger abstention doctrine applies,
emphasizing that abstention is mandatory when a state proceeding is
pending, the state court provides an adequate forum, and the proceedings

We now turn to the merits of the Department's Younger abstention
argument. 'Under the Younger abstention doctrine, federal courts should not
'interfere with state court proceedings by granting equitable relief such as
injunctions of important state proceedings or declaratory judgments
regarding constitutional issues in those proceedings' when a state forum
provides an adequate avenue for relief.' Weitzel v. Div. of Occupational and
Prof'l Licensing, 240 F.3d 871, 875 (10th Cir. 2001) (quoting Rienhardt v.
Kelly, 164 F.3d 1296, 1302 (10th Cir. 1999)).
Summary
The passage explains the Younger abstention doctrine, which generally
prevents federal courts from interfering with state court proceedings when
the state forum provides an adequate avenue for relief. This implies that if a
state forum is inadequate, such as being incompetent or biased, the Younger
abstention doctrine may not apply. The passage does not explicitly define the
standard for finding an inadequate state forum, but it suggests that the
adequacy of the state forum is a key consideration in applying the Younger
doctrine.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
Under Younger and its progeny, [a] federal court must abstain from
exercising jurisdiction when: (1) there is an ongoing state criminal, civil, or
administrative proceeding, (2) the state court provides an adequate forum to
hear the claims raised in the federal complaint, and (3) the state
proceedings 'involve important state interests, matters which traditionally
look to state law for their resolution or implicate separately articulated state
policies.'
Summary
The Younger abstention doctrine requires federal courts to abstain from
exercising jurisdiction in favor of ongoing state proceedings if the state
court provides an adequate forum. The adequacy of the state forum is a
critical factor, and if the state court is proven to be incompetent or biased, it
may not be considered an adequate forum. This would potentially allow the
federal court to retain jurisdiction despite the ongoing state proceedings.
Torwest DBC, Inc. v. Dick, 810 F.2d 925 (10th Cir. 1987)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
A more difficult question is presented when the RICO claim is based on one
scheme involving one victim, but the plan contemplates open-ended
fraudulent activity and does not have a single goal that, when achieved, will
bring the activity to an end. Some courts have found that such an ongoing
scheme is itself sufficient to satisfy the continuity element of a RICO pattern.
See, e.g., Morgan v. Bank of Waukegan, 804 F.2d 970, 976 (7th Cir.1986);
see also Illinois Dept. of Revenue v. Phillips, 771 F.2d 312 (7th Cir.1985).
Other courts may require additional proof showing that the defendants have
engaged in similar activity in the past, or have been involved in other
criminal activity, or pose a threat of similar activity in the future.
Summary
The passage provides insight into how courts, including those in the Tenth
Circuit, assess the continuity requirement for RICO claims. It highlights that
a single scheme involving one victim can satisfy the continuity requirement
if it contemplates ongoing fraudulent activity. This is relevant to the question
of whether federal courts should abstain under the Younger doctrine when
there are allegations of ongoing RICO violations in state court proceedings.
The passage suggests that if a scheme is ongoing and poses a threat of
continued illegal activity, it may warrant federal court intervention,
especially if the state court is deemed incompetent or biased.

U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
The Supreme Court has established three factors to be relevant to our
decision as to whether abstention is required under Younger. Seneca-Cayuga
Tribe of Okla. v. Okla. ex rel. Thompson, 874 F.2d 709, 711 (10th Cir.1989)
(citing Middlesex County Ethics Comm. v. Garden State Bar Ass'n, 457 U.S.
423, 432, 102 S.Ct. 2515, 73 L.Ed.2d 116 (1982)). These factors ask us to
determine whether: (1) there is an ongoing state criminal, civil, or
administrative proceeding, (2) the state court provides an adequate forum to
hear the claims raised in the federal complaint, and (3) the state
proceedings involve important state interests, matters which traditionally
look to state law for their resolution or implicate separately articulated state
policies.
Summary
Three factors considered under the Younger abstention doctrine: ongoing
state proceedings, adequacy of the state forum, and involvement of
important state interests. The adequacy of the state forum is a critical factor,
and if a plaintiff can demonstrate that the state court is not an adequate
forum, abstention may not be required. The passage does not specifically
address RICO allegations but provides a general framework for assessing
the adequacy of the state forum.

The district court's abstention pursuant to Younger is subject to de novo
review. Amanatullah v. Colo. Bd. of Med. Exam'rs, 187 F.3d 1160, 1163 (10th
Cir. 1999). Under the Younger abstention doctrine, federal courts should not
'interfere with state court proceedings by granting equitable relief - such as
injunctions of important state proceedings or declaratory judgments
regarding constitutional issues in those proceedings -' when a state forum
provides an adequate avenue for relief. Rienhardt v. Kelly, 164 F.3d 1296,
1302 (10th Cir. 1999). 'Younger abstention is non-discretionary;' the district
court must abstain once the conditions are met, 'absent extraordinary
circumstances.' Amanatullah, 187 F.3d at 1163. As this court stated in
Amanatullah: A federal court must abstain from exercising jurisdiction
when: (1) there is an ongoing state criminal, civil, or administrative
proceeding, (2) the state court provides an adequate forum to hear the
claims raised in the federal complaint, and (3) the state proceedings 'involve

important state interests, matters which traditionally look to state law for
their resolution or implicate separately articulated state policies.' Id.
(quoting Taylor v. Jaquez, 126 F.3d 1294, 1297 (10th Cir. 1997)). Dr. Weitzel
argues that the district court erred in abstaining under Younger because the
relief sought would not interfere with any ongoing state action.
Alternatively, Dr. Weitzel argues that this case falls within exceptions to the
Younger abstention doctrine. ... The Younger abstention doctrine is
inapplicable 'in cases of proven harassment or prosecutions undertaken by
state officials in bad faith without hope of obtaining a valid conviction and
perhaps in other extraordinary circumstances where irreparable injury can
be shown.' Amanatullah, 187 F.3d at 1165 (quoting Perez v. Ledesma, 401
U.S. 82, 85 (1971)).
Summary
Conditions under which the Younger abstention doctrine applies,
emphasizing that federal courts must abstain from interfering with state
court proceedings unless extraordinary circumstances are present. It
specifies that an adequate state forum is a key condition for abstention, and
exceptions to abstention include cases of proven harassment or bad faith
prosecutions. This provides insight into the standard for finding an
inadequate state forum, which would be when extraordinary circumstances
such as harassment or bad faith are proven.

In determining whether Younger abstention is appropriate, a court considers
whether: '(1) there is an ongoing state criminal, civil, or administrative
proceeding, (2) the state court provides an adequate forum to hear the
claims raised in the federal complaint, and (3) the state proceedings involve
important state interests, matters which traditionally look to state law for
their resolution or implicate separately articulated state policies.'
Summary
The Tenth Circuit considers three factors when determining the applicability
of Younger abstention: the existence of an ongoing state proceeding, the
adequacy of the state forum to hear the federal claims, and the involvement
of important state interests. The adequacy of the state forum is a critical
factor, and if the state court is found to be incompetent or biased, it may not
provide an adequate forum, potentially making Younger abstention
inappropriate.

Younger abstention dictates that federal courts not interfere with state court
proceedings by granting equitable relief-such as injunctions of important
state proceedings or declaratory judgments regarding constitutional issues
in those proceedings-when such relief could adequately be sought before the
state court." ... "A federal court must abstain from exercising jurisdiction

Younger abstention doctrine does not apply 'in cases of proven harassment

circumstances where irreparable injury can be shown.'
Summary
Younger abstention is generally required when there is an ongoing state
proceeding, the state court provides an adequate forum, and the
proceedings involve important state interests. However, exceptions exist if
there is proven harassment, bad faith prosecutions, or other extraordinary
circumstances where irreparable injury can be shown. This indicates that if
a plaintiff can prove that the state court forum is incompetent or biased, it
may fall under these exceptions, thus negating the requirement for
abstention.
Phelps v. Hamilton, 122 F.3d 885 (10th Cir. 1997)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
In response to defendant Hamilton's motion to dismiss the plaintiffs' claim
for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, the district court ruled that it would
abstain from exercising jurisdiction under Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37, 91
S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971), because the plaintiffs failed to establish
that this case fell within the bad faith and harassment exception to that
abstention doctrine... The Court also recognized in Younger and its
companion case, Perez v. Ledesma, 401 U.S. 82, 91 S.Ct. 674, 27 L.Ed.2d
701 (1971), that a federal plaintiff may overcome the presumption of
abstention 'in cases of proven harassment or prosecutions undertaken by
state officials in bad faith without hope of obtaining a valid conviction and
perhaps in other extraordinary circumstances where irreparable injury can
be shown....' Perez, 401 U.S at 85, 91 S.Ct. at 677. According to Younger, the

Summary
The burden is on the plaintiff to demonstrate these exceptional
circumstances to overcome the presumption of abstention.
Rienhardt v. Kelly, 164 F.3d 1296 (10th Cir. 1999)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
Younger abstention dictates that federal courts not interfere with state court
proceedings by granting equitable relief-such as injunctions of important
state proceedings or declaratory judgments regarding constitutional issues
in those proceedings-when such relief could adequately be sought before the
state court. ... The district court was not asked to give, and did not provide,
any equitable relief that interfered with the related state proceedings.
Therefore, Younger is not applicable here.
Summary
The passage from Rienhardt v. Kelly explains that the Younger abstention
doctrine prevents federal courts from interfering with state court
proceedings by granting equitable relief when such relief could be sought in
state court. However, if the federal court is not asked to provide such relief,
Younger abstention does not apply. This implies that if a state court is
deemed incompetent or biased, and thus incapable of fairly adjudicating
federal claims, the federal court may not be required to abstain under
Younger. The passage does not directly address the standard for finding an
inadequate state forum, but it suggests that the applicability of Younger
abstention depends on whether the federal court's involvement would
interfere with state proceedings.
Phelps v. Hamilton, 59 F.3d 1058 (10th Cir. 1995)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
In considering whether a federal plaintiff meets one of the exceptions to
Younger abstention, federal courts must balance the necessity of protecting
an individual's exercise of his or her constitutional rights with a prosecutor's
discretion in selecting certain actions for criminal prosecution. Moreover,
federalism concerns counsel against federal court intervention into state

=== PAGE 18 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
prosecutions so that the state judiciary will have the opportunity to correct
any prosecutorial violations of an individual's constitutional rights. These
twin rationales of respecting prosecutorial discretion and federalism explain
why the exceptions to Younger only provide for a 'very narrow gate for
federal intervention.' Arkebauer v. Kiley, 985 F.2d 1351, 1358 (7th Cir.1993).
Summary
The passage from Phelps v. Hamilton provides insight into the application of
the Younger abstention doctrine, emphasizing the narrow exceptions for
federal intervention in state court proceedings. It highlights the balance
between protecting constitutional rights and respecting state prosecutorial
discretion and federalism. The passage suggests that exceptions to Younger
abstention are limited and only apply in cases of proven harassment or
prosecutions without hope of a valid conviction. This indicates that proving
an inadequate state forum due to incompetence or bias would require
substantial evidence of such issues, as federal intervention is generally
discouraged to allow state courts the opportunity to address any violations.
JB a child v. Valdez, 186 F.3d 1280 (10th Cir. 1999)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
The Younger doctrine, as developed, requires abstention when federal
proceedings would (1) interfere with an ongoing state judicial proceeding
(2) that implicates important state interests and (3) that affords an adequate
opportunity to raise the federal claims. ... 'Younger abstention is not
discretionary once the above conditions are met absent extraordinary
circumstances that render a state court unable to give state litigants a full
and fair hearing on their federal claims.' ... Plaintiffs bear the burden of
proving that state procedural law barred presentation of their claims in the
New Mexico Children's Court. ... 'Certainly, abstention is appropriate unless
state law clearly bars the interposition of the [federal statutory] and
constitutional claims.'
Summary
The Younger doctrine requires federal court abstention when certain
conditions are met, including the adequacy of the state forum to address
federal claims. However, if extraordinary circumstances exist, such as the
state court's inability to provide a fair hearing, abstention is not mandatory.
The burden is on the plaintiff to demonstrate that the state forum is
inadequate, meaning that state procedural law must clearly bar the
presentation of federal claims.

U.S. District Court — District of New Mexico
Extract
Pursuant to the United States Supreme Court's holding in Younger v. Harris,
401 U.S. 37 (1971), federal courts are 'obliged to abstain [from exercising
jurisdiction] when a federal-court judgment on the claim would interfere
with an ongoing state proceeding implicating important state interests.' D.L.
v. Unified Sch. Dist. No. 497, 392 F.3d 1223, 1227-28 (10th Cir. 2004). The
Younger abstention doctrine is based 'on notions of comity and federalism,
which require that federal courts respect state functions and the
independent operation of state legal systems.' Phelps v. Hamilton, 122 F.3d
885, 889 (10th Cir. 1997). Thus, absent extraordinary circumstances, a
federal court must abstain from exercising jurisdiction when: (1) there is an
ongoing state criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding, (2)... All three
conditions for Younger abstention appear to be met in this case: (1) there is
an ongoing state habeas proceeding in the Ninth Judicial District of the
State of New Mexico; (2) the state court provides an adequate forum for
Petitioner's habeas claims; and (3) the state has an important interest in
reviewing the constitutionality of Petitioner's criminal conviction and
sentence. Cf. Fisher v. Whetsel, 142 Fed. App'x 337, 339 (10th Cir. July 20,
2005) (noting that a state's 'important interest in enforcing its criminal laws
through proceedings in its state courts remains axiomatic') (unpublished).
Although Petitioner is unsatisfied with the legal representation provided by
the Office of the Chief Public Defender of the State of New Mexico in his
state habeas proceeding, [see Doc. 7], this dissatisfaction does not
constitute an extraordinary circumstance warranting an exception to the
Younger abstention doctrine. See Middlesex Cty. Ethics Comm. v. Garden
State Bar Ass'n, 457 U.S. 423, 435 (1982) ('So long as the constitutional
claims of respondents can be determined in the state proceedings and so
long as there is no showing of bad faith, harassment, or some other
extraordinary circumstance that would make abstention inappropriate, the
federal courts should abstain.'); Phelps, 122 F.3d at 889 (noting that '[i]t is
the plaintiff's 'heavy burden' to overcome the bar of Younger abstention by
setting forth more than mere allegations of bad faith or harassment').
Summary
The Younger abstention doctrine requires federal courts to abstain from
intervening in ongoing state proceedings unless there are extraordinary
circumstances. The passage emphasizes that dissatisfaction with state court
proceedings or legal representation does not constitute an extraordinary
circumstance. The plaintiff bears a heavy burden to demonstrate bad faith,
harassment, or other extraordinary circumstances to overcome Younger
abstention.

Extract
In Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37 (1971), the Supreme Court held that
federal courts should not intervene in state criminal prosecutions begun
before institution of a federal suit when the state court proceedings are (1)
ongoing, (2) offer an adequate forum for a defendant's federal claims, and
(3) implicate important state interests. Id. at 43-44; Middlesex Cty. Ethics
Comm'n v. Garden State Bar Ass'n, 457 U.S. 423, 432 (1982). '[T]he district

circumstances.' Weitzel v. Div. of Occupational & Prof'l Licensing of Dep't of
Commerce, 240 F.3d 871, 875 (10th Cir. 2001) (quotations omitted).
Additionally, 'Younger governs whenever the requested relief would interfere
with the state court's ability to conduct proceedings, regardless of whether
the relief targets the conduct of a proceeding directly.' Joseph A. ex rel.
Corrine Wolfe v. Ingram, 275 F.3d 1253, 1272 (10th Cir. 2002) (citations
omitted). Exceptions exist for 'bad faith or harassment,' prosecution under a
statute that is 'flagrantly and patently' unconstitutional, or other
'extraordinary circumstances' involving irreparable injury. Younger, 401 U.S.
at 50-54 (quotations omitted); Amanatullah v. Colo. Bd. of Med. Exam'rs, 187
F.3d 1160, 1165 (10th Cir. 1999). However, Petitioner has a 'heavy burden'
of establishing an exception to the Younger abstention doctrine.
Summary
Conditions under which the Younger abstention doctrine applies,
emphasizing that federal courts should not intervene in state proceedings if
they are ongoing, provide an adequate forum for federal claims, and involve
important state interests. It also notes exceptions to the doctrine, such as
bad faith, harassment, or extraordinary circumstances, but highlights the
heavy burden on the petitioner to prove such exceptions. This is relevant to
the question of whether federal court abstention is required when the state
forum is alleged to be incompetent or biased.

In the present situation, all three Younger factors are present. There is,
however, a potential exception to the Younger abstention doctrine as it 'does
not apply in cases of proven harassment or prosecutions undertaken by state
officials in bad faith without hope of obtaining a valid conviction and
perhaps in other extraordinary circumstances where irreparable injury can
be shown.' Id. at 1165 (internal quotation marks omitted). When this is at
issue, '[i]t is the plaintiffs['] heavy burden to overcome the bar of Younger
abstention by setting forth more than mere allegations of bad faith or

in their heavy burden to show that they were the victims of proven
harassment or that the state court adjudication was undertaken in bad faith.
Summary
The passage outlines that the Younger abstention doctrine generally
prevents federal courts from interfering with state court proceedings.
However, there is an exception if the plaintiff can demonstrate proven
harassment or bad faith prosecutions by state officials, or other
extraordinary circumstances where irreparable injury can be shown. The
burden is on the plaintiff to provide more than mere allegations to overcome
the Younger abstention. This is relevant to the question as it provides the
standard for finding an inadequate state forum in the Tenth Circuit.

"Younger abstention applies only to three categories of state cases,"
including "state criminal prosecutions." Graff, 65 F.4th at 522 (internal
quotation marks omitted). For cases within those categories, "abstention is
required when three conditions are satisfied." Id. at 523. "First, the relevant
state court proceeding must be ongoing. Second, the state forum must
provide an adequate opportunity to raise the relevant federal claims. Third,
an important state interest must be present." Id. (citations and internal
quotation marks omitted). If those three requirements are met, "abstention
is mandatory unless one of three exceptions applies." Winn v. Cook, 945 F.3d
1253, 1258 (10th Cir. 2019). Among those exceptions are prosecutions
"commenced in bad faith or to harass" and "extraordinary circumstances
creating a threat of irreparable injury both great and immediate." Id. at
1258-59.
Summary
Younger abstention is applicable when three conditions are met: ongoing
state proceedings, an adequate state forum to raise federal claims, and an
important state interest. However, exceptions exist if the state proceedings
are commenced in bad faith, to harass, or if there are extraordinary
circumstances causing irreparable injury. The adequacy of the state forum is
a key factor, and the passage suggests that the forum must provide an
opportunity to raise federal claims, not necessarily a favorable outcome.

constitutional issues.' Buck v. Myers, 244 F. App'x 193, 197 (10th Cir. 2007)
(unpublished) (citing Winnebago Tribe of Neb. v. Stovall, 341 F.3d 1202,
1204 (10th Cir. 2003); see also Middlesex Cty. Ethics Comm. v. Garden State
Bar Ass'n, 457 U.S. 423, 432 (1982)). 'Once these three conditions are met,
Younger abstention is non-discretionary and, absent extraordinary
circumstances, a district court is required to abstain.' Buck, 244 F. App'x at
197 (citing Crown Point I, LLC v. Intermountain Rural Elec. Ass'n, 319 F.3d
1211, 1215 (10th Cir. 2003)).
Summary
Abstention is non-discretionary once these conditions are met, unless there
are extraordinary circumstances. The passage does not specifically address
the standard for finding an inadequate state forum, but it implies that the
state proceedings must offer an adequate opportunity to litigate federal
issues.

2025)
U.S. District Court — District of Colorado
Extract
Moreover, Mr. Webb's arguments fail on their merits. He asserts that he
lacks an opportunity to raise his arguments in state court because '[h]is
habeas petitions were dismissed without hearings.' But '[t]ypically, a plaintiff
has an adequate opportunity to raise federal claims in state court unless
state law clearly bars the interposition of the federal statutory and
constitutional claims.' Crown Point I, LLC v. Intermountain Rural Elec. Ass'n,
319 F.3d 1211, 1215 (10th Cir. 2003) (cleaned up). The fact that Plaintiff was
denied the relief sought does not demonstrate that he lacks an opportunity
to raise his challenges in state court.
Summary
In the Tenth Circuit, a plaintiff typically has an adequate opportunity to raise
federal claims in state court unless state law explicitly prevents the
assertion of those federal claims. The mere denial of relief in state court
does not automatically demonstrate an inadequate state forum. This
suggests that proving incompetence or bias in the state court requires more

than just unfavorable outcomes; there must be a clear legal barrier to
presenting federal claims.
Hamilton v. Wyandotte Cnty. Dist. Court, 25-3098-JWL (D. Kan. Jun 05, 2025)
U.S. District Court — District of Kansas
Extract
In Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37, 46 (1971), the United States Supreme
Court instructed that principles of comity dictate that generally a federal
court is not to intervene in ongoing state criminal proceedings unless
'irreparable injury' is 'both great and immediate.' The Tenth Circuit has
instructed that 'the Younger doctrine extends to federal claims for monetary
relief when a judgment for the plaintiff would have preclusive effects on a
pending state-court proceeding.' ... 'The Younger doctrine requires a federal
court to abstain from hearing a case where... (1) state judicial proceedings
are ongoing; (2) [that] implicate an important state interest; and (3) the
state proceedings offer an adequate opportunity to litigate federal
constitutional issues.' ... Although '[t]he Younger abstention doctrine does
not apply ‘in case of proven harassment or prosecutions undertaken by state
officials in bad faith without hope of obtaining a valid conviction and
perhaps in other extraordinary circumstances where irreparable injury can
be shown,' a petitioner asserting such circumstances must make 'more than
mere allegations of bad faith or harassment.'
Summary
Conditions under which the Younger abstention doctrine applies,
emphasizing that federal courts should generally abstain from intervening in
ongoing state proceedings unless there is irreparable injury that is both
great and immediate. The Tenth Circuit requires that the state proceedings
offer an adequate opportunity to litigate federal constitutional issues.
However, the doctrine does not apply in cases of proven harassment or bad
faith prosecutions without hope of obtaining a valid conviction. The
petitioner must provide more than mere allegations to prove such
circumstances.
Green v. Lavick, No. CIV-18-631-SLP (W.D. Okla. Aug 10, 2018)
U.S. District Court — Western District of Oklahoma
Extract
In Younger, the United States Supreme Court held that federal courts should
not intervene in state criminal prosecutions begun before institution of a
federal suit when the state court proceedings are: (1) ongoing, (2) offer an
adequate forum for a defendant's federal claims, and (3) implicate important

state interests. ... Exceptions exist for 'bad faith or harassment,' prosecution
under a statute that is 'flagrantly and patently' unconstitutional, or other
'extraordinary circumstances' involving irreparable injury. ... A petitioner
has a 'heavy burden' of establishing an exception to the Younger abstention
doctrine.
Summary
Conditions under which federal courts should abstain from intervening in
state court proceedings under the Younger doctrine. It specifies that
abstention is required when state proceedings are ongoing, provide an
adequate forum for federal claims, and involve important state interests.
However, exceptions to this doctrine exist in cases of bad faith, harassment,
or other extraordinary circumstances. The passage also emphasizes the
heavy burden on the petitioner to prove such exceptions. This is relevant to
the question as it provides the standard for when a federal court might
intervene despite the Younger doctrine, particularly if the state forum is
inadequate.
Klaassen v. Univ. of Kan. Sch. of Med., Case No. 13-CV-2561-DDC-KGS (D.
Kan. Dec 07, 2016)
U.S. District Court — District of Kansas
Extract
The Younger abstention doctrine reflects 'longstanding public policy against
federal court interference with state court proceedings.' Younger v. Harris,
401 U.S. 37, 43 (1971). This doctrine holds, for reasons of state sovereignty
and comity in state-federal relations, that federal courts should not enjoin
state judicial proceedings. Id. at 44. Younger abstention is required when:
(1) there is an ongoing state judicial proceeding involving the federal
plaintiff; (2) that implicates important state interests; and (3) the proceeding
provides an adequate opportunity for the federal plaintiff to assert his or her
federal claims. Middlesex Cty. Ethics Comm. v. Garden State Bar Ass'n, 457
U.S. 423, 432 (1982).
Summary
The Younger abstention doctrine is a principle that discourages federal court
interference with state court proceedings. It is applicable when there is an
ongoing state judicial proceeding that involves the federal plaintiff,
implicates important state interests, and provides an adequate opportunity
for the federal plaintiff to assert federal claims. The passage does not
specifically address the standard for finding an inadequate state forum, but
it implies that if the state proceeding does not provide an adequate
opportunity for the federal plaintiff to assert federal claims, abstention may
not be required.

Selph v. Tedrow, No. CV 17-00410 JCH/SCY (D. N.M. Feb 21, 2018)
U.S. District Court — District of New Mexico
Extract
In Younger, the United States Supreme Court held that a federal district
court should not enjoin a pending state criminal proceeding unless an
injunction is necessary to prevent great and immediate irreparable injury.
See 401 U.S. at 43-45. The Younger decision rested on 'a strong federal
policy against federal-court interference with pending state judicial
proceedings absent extraordinary circumstances.' Middlesex County Ethics
Comm. v. Garden State Bar Ass'n, 457 U.S. 423, 431 (1982). The Younger
doctrine, as developed, requires abstention when federal proceedings would
(1) interfere with an ongoing state judicial proceeding (2) that implicates
important state interests and (3) that affords an adequate opportunity to
raise the federal claims.
Summary
Conditions under which the Younger abstention doctrine applies,
emphasizing the need for an adequate opportunity to raise federal claims in
state court. If the state court is incompetent or biased, it may not afford
such an opportunity, potentially providing grounds to argue against
abstention. However, the passage does not explicitly address the standard
for proving an inadequate state forum in the Tenth Circuit.
Taylor v. Jaquez, 126 F.3d 1294 (10th Cir. 1997)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
To assure this end, Younger articulated a narrow exception now applied to
state criminal, Younger, 401 U.S. at 37, 91 S.Ct. at 746; civil, New Orleans
Public Serv., Inc. v. Council of City of New Orleans, 491 U.S. 350, 109 S.Ct.
2506, 105 L.Ed.2d 298 (1989); or administrative proceedings, Ohio Civil
Rights Commission v. Dayton Christian Schools, Inc., 477 U.S. 619, 106 S.Ct.
2718, 91 L.Ed.2d 512 (1986), which commands a federal court to abstain
from exercising jurisdiction when three conditions have been established.
First, there must be ongoing state criminal, civil, or administrative
proceedings. Second, the state court must offer an adequate forum to hear
the federal plaintiff's claims from the federal lawsuit.
Summary
The Younger abstention doctrine requires federal courts to abstain from
exercising jurisdiction when there are ongoing state proceedings, and the
state court provides an adequate forum for the federal claims. The passage

=== PAGE 26 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
highlights that one of the conditions for Younger abstention is that the state
court must offer an adequate forum to hear the federal plaintiff's claims.
This implies that if the state court is proven to be incompetent or biased, it
may not be considered an adequate forum, potentially affecting the
application of Younger abstention.
Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska v. Stovall, 341 F.3d 1202 (10th Cir. 2003)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
The tribes maintain that even if this case satisfied the Younger
requirements, it would fall within two exceptions. The first exception is for
those situations in which the state proceedings are motivated by a desire to
harass and are conducted in bad faith. The second exception is for situations
in which plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm in the absence of federal
intervention. Because we have found the Younger requirements are not
satisfied, however, we do not reach the applicability of these exceptions.
Summary
There are recognized exceptions to the Younger abstention doctrine, which
include situations where state proceedings are conducted in bad faith or are
motivated by harassment, and where plaintiffs would suffer irreparable
harm without federal intervention. This suggests that if a plaintiff can
demonstrate that the state court is incompetent or biased, potentially falling
under bad faith or harassment, the federal court may not be required to
abstain under Younger. The passage does not explicitly address the standard
for finding an inadequate state forum, but it implies that exceptions to
Younger abstention are considered when there is evidence of bad faith or
irreparable harm.
D.L. v. Unified School Dist. No. 497, 392 F.3d 1223 (10th Cir. 2004)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
Younger abstention is inappropriate when a federal plaintiff cannot pursue
its federal contentions in the ongoing state proceeding. See Middlesex
County Ethics Comm. v. Garden State Bar Ass'n, 457 U.S. 423, 435-37, 102
S.Ct. 2515, 73 L.Ed.2d 116 (1982). But no reason appears why Plaintiffs'
contentions here could not be interposed as defenses in state court. See
Lebbos v. Judges of Superior Court, 883 F.2d 810, 815 (9th Cir.1989)
(opportunity to raise federal contentions as defenses is sufficient).

=== PAGE 27 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
Younger abstention is not required if the federal plaintiff cannot pursue their
federal claims in the state proceeding. This suggests that if a state court is
incompetent or biased to the extent that it cannot fairly adjudicate federal
claims, Younger abstention may not apply. The passage also implies that the
ability to raise federal contentions as defenses in state court is a factor in
determining whether abstention is appropriate.
Seneca-Cayuga Tribe of Oklahoma v. State of Okl. ex rel. Thompson, 874 F.
2d 709 (10th Cir. 1989)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
Younger abstention requires an ongoing state judicial (or in a proper case
administrative) proceeding, the presence of an important state interest, and
an adequate opportunity to raise federal claims in the state proceedings. ...
Younger abstention is not discretionary once the above conditions are
met, ... absent extraordinary circumstances that render a state court unable
to give state litigants a full and fair hearing on their federal claims, ...
Summary
The Younger abstention doctrine requires three conditions to be met: an
ongoing state proceeding, an important state interest, and an adequate
opportunity to raise federal claims in the state proceedings. However,
abstention is not required if there are extraordinary circumstances that
prevent the state court from providing a full and fair hearing on federal
claims. This implies that if a plaintiff can prove that the state court is
incompetent or biased, it may constitute such extraordinary circumstances,
thus negating the requirement for abstention.
ABSTAINING EQUITABLY.
Notre Dame Law Review - University of Notre Dame Law School -
Smith, Fred O., Jr. - 2022-05-01
Extract
In 2018, I contended that Younger&#39;s &#34;[s]afety valves for bad faith,
untimely proceedings, biased proceedings, and even patently
unconstitutional laws are united by that longstanding conception of the
federal judiciary&#39;s equitable role.... The time is ripe to assess whether
these exceptions are working as intended.&#34; (77)... they have not
established that South Dakota courts are unwilling or unable to adjudicate

constitutional claims,... and &#34;when a litigant has not attempted to
present his federal claims in related state-court proceedings, a federal court
should assume that state procedures will afford an adequate remedy, in the
absence of unambiguous authority to the contrary. (113)
Summary
The Younger abstention doctrine includes exceptions for cases where state
proceedings are conducted in bad faith, are untimely, or are biased. The
passage suggests that federal courts should assume state courts are
competent to adjudicate federal claims unless there is clear evidence to the
contrary. This implies that proving a state forum is inadequate requires
demonstrating clear bias or incompetence, which is not easily assumed.
ABSTAINING FROM ABSTENTION: WHY YOUNGER ABSTENTION DOES
NOT APPLY IN 42 U.S.C [section] 1983 BAIL LITIGATION.
University of Pennsylvania Law Review - University of Pennsylvania,
Law School - Rauf, Alezeh - 2023-01-01
Extract
The Younger court went on to outline three exceptions for when a federal
court must act to enjoin a state court proceeding: when (1) the prosecution
is acting in bad faith, (2) the statute is 'patently unconstitutional,' or (3) 'any
other unusual circumstances that would call for equitable relief' exist. These
exceptions stem from Ex parte Young, which held that a defendant about to
be prosecuted in a state court can enjoin the proceedings if he can show
that he otherwise would suffer irreparable harm. This is because federal
courts must be able to protect constitutional rights where state courts may
fail to do so, but also should not needlessly interfere with legitimate
activities of state courts.
Summary
The Younger abstention doctrine has specific exceptions where federal
courts can intervene in state court proceedings. These exceptions include
situations where the state prosecution is in bad faith, the statute in question
is patently unconstitutional, or there are unusual circumstances that
warrant equitable relief. This indicates that if a plaintiff can demonstrate
that the state court is incompetent or biased, it may fall under the "unusual
circumstances" exception, allowing federal intervention.
