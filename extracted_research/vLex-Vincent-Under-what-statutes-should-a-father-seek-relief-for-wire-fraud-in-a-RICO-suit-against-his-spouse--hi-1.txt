Question
Under what statutes should a father seek relief for wire fraud in a RICO suit
against his spouse, his spouse's grandmother, and his spouse's stepfather?
Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
A father seeking relief for wire fraud in a RICO suit should primarily rely on 
18 U.S.C. § 1964, which provides civil remedies for violations of 18 U.S.C. §
1962, using wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343 as the predicate offense
within a pattern of racketeering activity as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 1961.
Summary
To pursue a RICO suit based on wire fraud, the father must structure his
claim under the civil remedies provision of the Racketeer Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C. § 1964, which allows private
parties to seek treble damages for injuries resulting from violations of 18
U.S.C. § 1962. His claim should specify which subsection of § 1962 the
defendants violated—whether they used income from racketeering activity (§
1962(a)), acquired control through racketeering activity (§ 1962(b)),
conducted enterprise affairs through racketeering (§ 1962(c)), or conspired
to violate RICO provisions (§ 1962(d))—with § 1962(c) being most commonly
used. Wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343 serves as the predicate act
constituting "racketeering activity" as defined in § 1961(1)(B).
The father must demonstrate that the defendants—his spouse, his spouse's
grandmother, and his spouse's stepfather—formed an "enterprise" that
engaged in a "pattern of racketeering activity" consisting of at least two
related acts of wire fraud within a ten-year period. To establish wire fraud,
he must show the defendants devised a scheme to defraud, used interstate
wire communications in furtherance of that scheme, and had the specific
intent to defraud. His pleadings must comply with Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 9(b)'s requirement that fraud allegations be pleaded with
particularity, specifying the fraudulent statements, who made them, when
and where they were made, and why they were fraudulent.
Background and Relevant Law
Statutory Framework
Civil RICO Claims
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) provides
both criminal and civil remedies, with the civil provision codified at 18

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
U.S.C. § 1964 offering powerful tools for private litigants. Under this
provision, "[a]ny person injured in his business or property by reason of a
violation of section 1962 of this chapter may sue therefor in any appropriate
United States district court and shall recover threefold the damages he
sustains and the cost of the suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee..." (18
U.S.C. § 1964).
This civil remedy allows the father to seek significant monetary damages
against the defendants if he can establish they violated 18 U.S.C. § 1962.
The statute creates four types of prohibited activities under § 1962:
Section 1962(a) prohibits using or investing income derived from a
pattern of racketeering activity to acquire an interest in or establish an
enterprise affecting interstate commerce: "It shall be unlawful for any
person who has received any income derived, directly or indirectly,
from a pattern of racketeering activity... to use or invest, directly or
indirectly, any part of such income, or the proceeds of such income, in
acquisition of any interest in, or the establishment or operation of, any
enterprise which is engaged in, or the activities of which affect,
interstate or foreign commerce." (18 U.S.C. § 1962)
Section 1962(b) prohibits acquiring or maintaining an interest in an
enterprise through a pattern of racketeering: "It shall be unlawful for
any person through a pattern of racketeering activity or through
collection of an unlawful debt to acquire or maintain, directly or
indirectly, any interest in or control of any enterprise which is engaged
in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce." (18
U.S.C. § 1962)
Section 1962(c) prohibits conducting an enterprise's affairs through a
pattern of racketeering: "It shall be unlawful for any person employed
by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of
which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate,
directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through
a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt." (18
U.S.C. § 1962)
Section 1962(d) prohibits conspiring to violate subsections (a), (b), or
(c): "It shall be unlawful for any person to conspire to violate any of the
provisions of subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section." (18 U.S.C. §
1962)
As noted in secondary materials, "Section 1962(c) prohibits a person from
conducting the affairs of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering"
and "claims under Section 1962(c) are the most commonly
asserted." (Defending Civil RICO Claims: A Defense Plan Should Be In Every
Business's Arsenal)
Defining Racketeering Activity
To pursue a RICO claim, the father must establish that the defendants
engaged in a "pattern of racketeering activity." The RICO statute defines
1.

4. 

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
"racketeering activity" at 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1)(B) as including "any act which
is indictable under any of the following provisions of title 18, United States
Code... section 1343 (relating to wire fraud)..." (18 U.S.C. § 1961)
This explicitly includes wire fraud as a predicate act that can form the basis
of a RICO claim. Secondary materials confirm that "Mail and wire fraud are
the most common predicate acts" in RICO cases. (RICO: A Primer)
A "pattern of racketeering activity" requires at least two predicate acts of
racketeering activity occurring within a ten-year period. (18 U.S.C. §
1961(5))
Wire Fraud Statute
The wire fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1343, which would serve as the predicate
offense for the father's RICO claim, provides:
"Whoever, having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to
defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent
pretenses, representations, or promises, transmits or causes to be
transmitted by means of wire, radio, or television communication in
interstate or foreign commerce, any writings, signs, signals, pictures, or
sounds for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice, shall be fined
under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both." (18 U.S.C. §
1343)
This statute criminalizes fraudulent schemes executed through interstate
wire communications, which could include electronic fund transfers,
telephone calls, emails, or other electronic communications used to
perpetrate fraud.
Other Potentially Relevant Statutes
While the primary statutes for the father's RICO claim would be 18 U.S.C. §§
1962, 1961, 1964, and 1343, other related statutes might also be relevant
depending on the specific facts of the case:
18 U.S.C. § 1341 (Frauds and Swindles), which addresses mail fraud:
"Whoever, having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice
to defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or
fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises... shall be fined
under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both." (18
U.S.C. § 1341) This could be relevant if the fraudulent scheme also
involved use of mail.
18 U.S.C. § 1952 (Interstate and Foreign Travel or Transportation in Aid
of Racketeering Enterprises), which prohibits using interstate travel or
facilities to distribute proceeds of unlawful activities or to promote
unlawful activities. (18 U.S.C. § 1952)
• 
• 

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
18 U.S.C. § 1956 (Laundering of Monetary Instruments), which could
apply if the defendants laundered money obtained through wire fraud.
(18 U.S.C. § 1956)
18 U.S.C. § 1957 (Engaging in Monetary Transactions in Property
Derived from Specified Unlawful Activity), which prohibits engaging in
monetary transactions exceeding $10,000 derived from specified
unlawful activity. (18 U.S.C. § 1957)
18 U.S.C. § 2520 (Recovery of Civil Damages Authorized), which
provides civil remedies for unauthorized interception of wire
communications. (18 U.S.C. § 2520)
Case Law Interpreting RICO Requirements
Elements of a Civil RICO Claim
Courts have consistently recognized four essential elements for establishing
a civil RICO claim: "(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4)
of racketeering activity." (Uselmann v. Pop, 495 F.Supp.3d 528 (E.D. Mich.
2020))
In Arizona Premium Finance, Inc. v. Bielli, 77 F.Supp.2d 341 (E.D. N.Y.
1999), the court elaborated that a plaintiff "must allege the existence of
seven constituent elements: (1) that the defendant (2) through the
commission of two or more acts (3) constituting a 'pattern' (4) of
'racketeering activity' (5) directly or indirectly invests in, or maintains an
interest in, or participates in (6) an 'enterprise' (7) the activities of which
affect interstate or foreign commerce."
The Jones v. Ram Med., Inc., 807 F.Supp.2d 501 (D. S.C. 2011) court further
refined the elements: "(1) a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1962, (2) an injury to
business or property, and (3) that the injury was caused by the violation of §
1962."
Enterprise Requirement
The Supreme Court in United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576 (1981) defined
an "enterprise" as "an entity, for present purposes a group of persons
associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a course of
conduct." It's important to note that this case was abrogated by Lane v.
United States, 474 U.S. 438 (1986) on other grounds related to harmless
error review, but its definition of "enterprise" remains valid precedent.
This definition is particularly relevant to the father's case, as he would need
to establish that his spouse, his spouse's grandmother, and his spouse's
stepfather formed an enterprise—a group associated together for the
common purpose of defrauding him through wire communications.

Pattern of Racketeering Activity
Courts have established that a "pattern of racketeering activity" requires at
least two predicate acts that are related and pose a threat of continued
criminal activity. In Al-Abood v. El-Shamari, 217 F.3d 225 (4th Cir. 2000), the
court explained: "A pattern of racketeering requires at least two predicate
acts. However, simply proving two or more predicate acts is insufficient for a
RICO plaintiff to succeed; instead, the RICO plaintiff must also show that the
predicate acts are related and that they constitute or pose a threat of
continued criminal activity."
Wire Fraud as a Predicate Act
The elements of wire fraud were outlined in Zibalstar, L.C. v. Conte, Case
No. 2:17-CV-563 (D. Utah Mar 27, 2018), which noted that wire fraud is
"'very similar' [to mail fraud] but involves use of 'interstate wire, radio or
television communications in furtherance of the scheme to defraud.'" The
elements of wire fraud therefore include "(1) the existence of a scheme or
artifice to defraud or obtain money or property by false pretenses,
representations or promises, and (2) use of [...] interstate wire, radio or
television communications in furtherance of the scheme to defraud."
Similarly, Theft offenses identifies four elements for wire fraud: "(1) that the
defendant voluntarily and intentionally devised or participated in a scheme
to defraud another out of money; (2) that the defendant did so with the
intent to defraud; (3) that it was reasonably foreseeable that interstate wire
communications would be used; and (4) that interstate wire communications
were in fact used."
Reliance Not Required
Importantly, the Supreme Court in Bridge v. Phoenix Bond & Indem. Co., 553
U.S. 639 (2008) held that "a plaintiff asserting a RICO claim predicated on
mail fraud need not show, either as an element of its claim or as a
prerequisite to establishing proximate causation, that it relied on the
defendant's alleged misrepresentations." This principle extends to wire
fraud cases as well, meaning the father would not need to prove he
personally relied on fraudulent communications, only that such
communications occurred as part of the fraudulent scheme.
Pleading Requirements
RICO complaints based on allegations of wire fraud must be pleaded with
particularity under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b). As noted in Civil
Rico: A Tool of Advocacy, "RICO claims based on mail or wire fraud must
comport with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b)'s requirement that
allegations involving fraud be pleaded with particularity."

Analysis: Application to Father's RICO Claim
Establishing a RICO Claim under § 1962(c)
For the father seeking relief against his spouse, his spouse's grandmother,
and his spouse's stepfather, § 1962(c) likely offers the most suitable basis for
his RICO claim, as it is "the most commonly asserted" RICO provision
(Defending Civil RICO Claims: A Defense Plan Should Be In Every Business's
Arsenal). Under this subsection, the father would need to prove that the
defendants conducted or participated in an enterprise's affairs through a
pattern of racketeering activity, specifically wire fraud.
The father would need to establish each of the following elements:
Conduct: The defendants actively participated in the operation or
management of the enterprise. This requires showing that each
defendant—the spouse, grandmother, and stepfather—played some role
in directing the enterprise's affairs.
Enterprise: The three defendants formed an "enterprise," which means
they were "associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a
course of conduct" (United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576 (1981)). The
father would need to show that the defendants functioned as a
continuing unit with a common purpose—specifically, to defraud him
through wire communications.
Pattern: The defendants engaged in at least two acts of wire fraud
within a ten-year period that were related and posed a threat of
continued criminal activity. The acts must be related in terms of "the
same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of
commission" (Al-Abood v. El-Shamari, 217 F.3d 225 (4th Cir. 2000)).
Racketeering Activity: The predicate acts constituted wire fraud
under 18 U.S.C. § 1343, meaning the defendants utilized interstate wire
communications as part of a scheme to defraud the father.
Proving Wire Fraud
To establish wire fraud as the predicate offense, the father must
demonstrate:
A Scheme to Defraud: The defendants developed a scheme to defraud
him or obtain money or property through false pretenses,
representations, or promises.
Use of Interstate Wire Communications: The defendants utilized
interstate wire communications (such as phone calls, emails, text
messages, electronic fund transfers) to execute the scheme.
Intent to Defraud: The defendants acted with the specific intent to
defraud.

3. 
4. 
1. 
2. 
3. 

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
As noted in Theft offenses, it must have been "reasonably foreseeable that
interstate wire communications would be used" and "interstate wire
communications were in fact used."
Pleading with Particularity
The father's complaint must plead the alleged wire fraud with particularity
under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b). This means the complaint should
specify:
The content of the false representations
Who made them
When and where they were made
Why they were fraudulent
As stated in Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy, if any one of the RICO elements
"is not adequately pleaded," the complaint will fail.
Proving Injury and Causation
Under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c), the father must prove he was "injured in his
business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962." This requires
showing that the defendants' RICO violation was the proximate cause of his
injury.
Importantly, following Bridge v. Phoenix Bond & Indem. Co., 553 U.S. 639
(2008), the father need not show that he personally relied on any fraudulent
communications. It's sufficient to demonstrate that the wire fraud occurred
and caused his injury.
Alternative RICO Provisions
While § 1962(c) is most commonly used, the father could also consider
claims under the other RICO provisions:
§ 1962(a): If the defendants used income derived from wire fraud to
establish or operate an enterprise affecting interstate commerce.
§ 1962(b): If the defendants acquired or maintained an interest in or
control of an enterprise affecting interstate commerce through wire
fraud.
§ 1962(d): If the defendants conspired to violate subsections (a), (b), or
(c).
Potential Damages
If successful, the father would be entitled under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c) to
"recover threefold the damages he sustains and the cost of the suit,
including a reasonable attorney's fee." This treble damages provision makes
RICO an attractive option for plaintiffs who can successfully establish their
claims.

Exceptions and Caveats
Standing Requirements
The father must demonstrate that he was injured in his "business or
property" as a result of the RICO violation. Personal injuries, emotional
distress, or other non-economic harms do not qualify as injuries to "business
or property" under RICO.
Statute of Limitations
The statute of limitations for civil RICO claims is generally four years from
when the plaintiff discovered or should have discovered their injury. The
father should ensure his claim is timely filed.
Relationship to Family Law Proceedings
The father should consider how his RICO claim might interact with any
concurrent or pending family law proceedings, such as divorce or property
settlement matters. Courts might be hesitant to allow RICO claims that
appear to be attempts to circumvent or supplement family law proceedings.
Heightened Pleading Standard
The father must satisfy the heightened pleading standard for fraud under
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b). Failure to plead wire fraud with
particularity will likely result in dismissal of the RICO claim.
Demonstrating a Pattern
Merely showing two isolated instances of wire fraud may not be sufficient to
establish a "pattern" of racketeering activity. The father must show that the
predicate acts are related and demonstrate "continuity"—either closed-
ended continuity (a series of related acts over a substantial period) or open-
ended continuity (past conduct that by its nature projects into the future
with a threat of repetition).
Interstate Commerce Requirement
The enterprise must be engaged in or affect interstate commerce. This is
typically a minimal threshold, but the father should still be prepared to
demonstrate how the defendants' activities affected interstate commerce.
Conclusion
A father seeking relief for wire fraud in a RICO suit against his spouse, his
spouse's grandmother, and his spouse's stepfather should base his claim
primarily on the civil remedies provision of RICO, 18 U.S.C. § 1964, alleging
violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). His complaint should allege that the

=== PAGE 9 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
defendants conducted an enterprise's affairs through a pattern of
racketeering activity, specifically wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343.
To prevail, the father must establish that:
The defendants formed an "enterprise"—a group associated for the
common purpose of engaging in a course of conduct.
The defendants conducted the enterprise's affairs through a "pattern of
racketeering activity," consisting of at least two related instances of
wire fraud occurring within a ten-year period.
The wire fraud involved a scheme to defraud, use of interstate wire
communications, and intent to defraud.
He suffered injury to his business or property as a proximate result of
the RICO violation.
The father's complaint must plead the fraud allegations with particularity
under Rule 9(b), specifying the fraudulent statements, who made them,
when and where they were made, and why they were fraudulent. If
successful, he would be entitled to treble damages, costs, and attorney's
fees under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c).
While the primary focus should be on 18 U.S.C. §§ 1962(c), 1964, and 1343,
the father might also consider claims under other RICO provisions (§§
1962(a), (b), or (d)) depending on the specific facts and circumstances of his
case. Additional statutes such as 18 U.S.C. § 1341 (mail fraud), § 1952
(interstate travel in aid of racketeering), § 1956 (money laundering), § 1957
(monetary transactions in property derived from unlawful activity), or § 2520
(civil recovery for interception of communications) might also be relevant
depending on the nature of the defendants' alleged conduct.
Legal Authorities

(1981)
U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
In order to secure a conviction under RICO, the Government must prove
both the existence of an 'enterprise' and the connected 'pattern of
racketeering activity.' The enterprise is an entity, for present purposes a
group of persons associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a
course of conduct. The pattern of racketeering activity is, on the other hand,
a series of criminal acts as defined by the statute. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1) (1976
ed., Supp. III).
Summary
An enterprise can be a group of individuals associated for a common
purpose, and the pattern of racketeering activity involves a series of
1.

criminal acts, which could include wire fraud. This is relevant to the father's
case as he would need to establish these elements to seek relief under RICO.

U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
Held: A plaintiff asserting a RICO claim predicated on mail fraud need not
show, either as an element of its claim or as a prerequisite to establishing
proximate causation, that it relied on the defendant's alleged
misrepresentations. Pp. 2137 – 2145. (a) In 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c), RICO
provides a private right of action for treble damages to '[a]ny person injured
in his business or property by reason of a violation,' as pertinent here, of §
1962(c), which makes it 'unlawful for any person employed by or associated
with' a qualifying enterprise 'to conduct or participate ... in the conduct of
such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity,'
including 'mail fraud,' § 1961(1)(B). Mail fraud, in turn, occurs whenever a
person, 'having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to
defraud,' uses the mail 'for the purpose of executing such scheme or
artifice.' § 1341.
Summary
The U.S. Supreme Court in Bridge v. Phoenix Bond & Indem. Co. clarified
that a plaintiff does not need to show reliance on misrepresentations to
establish a RICO claim predicated on mail fraud. The relevant statutes are
18 U.S.C. § 1964(c) for the private right of action and § 1962(c) for the
unlawful conduct involving a pattern of racketeering activity, which includes
mail and wire fraud as predicate acts under § 1961(1)(B). This is applicable
to any person injured in their business or property by such violations.

Extract
RICO renders criminally and civilly liable 'any person' who uses or invests
income derived 'from a pattern of racketeering activity' to acquire an
interest in or to operate an enterprise engaged in interstate commerce, §
1962(a); who acquires or maintains an interest in or control of such an
enterprise 'through a pattern of racketeering activity,' § 1962(b); who, being
employed by or associated with such an enterprise, conducts or participates

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
in the conduct of its affairs 'through a pattern of racketeering activity,' §
1962(c); or, finally, who conspires to violate the first three subsections of §
1962, § 1962(d).
Summary
Statutory framework of the RICO Act, specifically sections 1962(a) through
1962(d), which detail the circumstances under which individuals can be held
liable for engaging in racketeering activities. This includes using income
derived from racketeering to operate an enterprise, acquiring or
maintaining control of an enterprise through racketeering, conducting an
enterprise's affairs through racketeering, or conspiring to do any of these.
The passage is relevant because it provides the legal basis for pursuing a
RICO claim, which can include wire fraud as a predicate offense.
Sedima v. Imrex Company, Inc, 473 U.S. 479, 105 S.Ct. 3275, 87 L.Ed.2d 346
(1985)
U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C.
§§ 1961-1968, which is directed at 'racketeering activity'—defined in §
1961(1) to encompass, inter alia, acts 'indictable' under specific federal
criminal provisions, including mail and wire fraud—provides in § 1964(c) for
a private civil action to recover treble damages by any person injured in his
business or property 'by reason of a violation of section 1962.' Section
1962(c) prohibits conducting or participating in the conduct of an enterprise
'through a pattern of racketeering activity.'
Summary
The passage from the Sedima v. Imrex Company, Inc case provides insight
into the application of the RICO statute, specifically 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961-1968.
It explains that RICO is directed at "racketeering activity," which includes
acts indictable under federal criminal provisions such as mail and wire
fraud. Section 1964(c) allows for a private civil action to recover treble
damages for injuries to business or property caused by a violation of section
1962. Section 1962(c) prohibits conducting an enterprise through a pattern
of racketeering activity. This information is directly relevant to the question
as it outlines the statutory basis for seeking relief under RICO for wire
fraud.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
To state a claim for damages under RICO a plaintiff has two pleading
burdens. First, he must allege that the defendant has violated the
substantive RICO statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1962 (1976), commonly known as
'criminal RICO.' In so doing, he must allege the existence of seven
constituent elements: (1) that the defendant (2) through the commission of
two or more acts (3) constituting a 'pattern' (4) of 'racketeering activity' (5)
directly or indirectly invests in, or maintains an interest in, or participates in
(6) an 'enterprise' (7) the activities of which affect interstate or foreign
commerce.... Plaintiff must allege adequately defendant's violation of section
1962 before turning to the second burden — i.e., invoking RICO's civil
remedies of treble damages, attorneys fees and costs....
Summary
Requirements for pleading a RICO violation, specifically under 18 U.S.C. §
1962, which includes alleging a pattern of racketeering activity such as wire
fraud. This is directly relevant to the question as it provides the statutory
basis and elements needed to establish a RICO claim involving wire fraud.
Zibalstar, L.C. v. Conte, Case No. 2:17-CV-563 (D. Utah Mar 27, 2018)
U.S. District Court — District of Utah
Extract
Mail and wire fraud are federal crimes defined under 18 U.S.C. §§ 1341 and
1343, respectively. Mail fraud involves two distinct elements: '(1) the
existence of a scheme or artifice to defraud or obtain money or property by
false pretenses, representations or promises, and (2) use of the United
States mails for the purpose of executing the scheme.' Tal v. Hogan, 453 F.3d
1244, 1263 (10th Cir. 2006) (citation omitted). Wire fraud is 'very similar'
but involves use of 'interstate wire, radio or television communications in
furtherance of the scheme to defraud.' Id. (citation omitted).
Summary
The passage provides information on the federal statutes that define mail
and wire fraud, which are 18 U.S.C. §§ 1341 and 1343. These statutes are
relevant for establishing predicate acts in a RICO claim. The passage also
explains the elements required to prove mail and wire fraud, which are
necessary for a RICO claim based on these predicate acts. This information
is applicable to any RICO suit involving allegations of wire fraud, including
the hypothetical case of a father seeking relief against his spouse and her

U.S. District Court — Eastern District of New York
Extract
Plaintiff's complaint alleges five causes of action. The first three arise under
the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act ("RICO"), codified
at 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961-68... In his complaint, Plaintiff raises three RICO claims
under 18 U.S.C. §§ 1962(b), (c), and (d), respectively... 18 USC § 1964
creates a private cause of action for '[a]ny person injured in his business or
property by reason of a violation of [18 U.S.C. § 1962].' To bring a civil RICO
claim under § 1964, a plaintiff 'must allege that the defendant engaged in at
least two predicate acts of racketeering activity, where racketeering activity
is defined to include a host of state and federal offenses.'... Here, Plaintiff's
RICO claims are premised entirely on alleged acts of wire fraud.
Summary
The RICO Act, specifically 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961-68, provides a framework for
bringing claims involving wire fraud. The passage explains that a plaintiff
can bring a civil RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1964 if they can allege that
the defendant engaged in at least two predicate acts of racketeering activity,
which includes wire fraud. This is relevant to the question as it provides the
statutory basis for seeking relief in a RICO suit involving wire fraud.
Mowett v. Jpmorgan Chase Bank, Case No. 15-12612 (E.D. Mich. Mar 31,
2016)
U.S. District Court — Eastern District of Michigan
Extract
18 U.S.C.§ 1962(c) provides: It shall be unlawful for any person employed by
or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which
affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or
indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of
racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt. ... To establish a RICO
violation under § 1962(c), a plaintiff must allege that the RICO enterprise
engaged in a 'pattern of racketeering activity' consisting of at least two
predicate acts of racketeering activity occurring within a ten-year period. 18
U.S.C. § 1961(5). The alleged predicate acts may consist of offenses 'which
are indictable' under any of a number of federal statutes, including the mail
(18 U.S.C. § 1341) and wire fraud statutes (18 U.S.C. § 1343). 18 U.S.C. §
1961(1).
Summary
Clear legal framework for pursuing a RICO claim based on wire fraud.

Lunceford v. Carson
U.S. District Court — District of Oregon
Extract
Mr. Lunceford alleges that Defendants conspired to commit and did commit
fraud in a pattern of racketeering as defined by RICO. 18 USC § 1964(c),
(d). ... To state a civil claim under RICO, a plaintiff must show that a
defendant participated in “(1) the conduct of (2) an enterprise that affects
interstate commerce (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity or
collection of unlawful debt,” and this “conduct must be (5) the proximate
cause of harm to the victim.” ... Mail and wire fraud, predicate acts under
RICO, are “identical except for the particular method used to disseminate
the fraud, and contain three elements: (A) the formation of a scheme to
defraud, (B) the use of the mails or wires in furtherance of that scheme, and
(C) the specific intent to defraud.”
Summary
To seek relief for wire fraud in a RICO suit, the plaintiff must allege that the
defendants engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity, which includes
wire fraud as a predicate act. The relevant statute is 18 USC § 1964(c), (d),
which provides the basis for civil RICO claims. The plaintiff must
demonstrate the elements of a RICO claim, including the conduct of an
enterprise affecting interstate commerce through a pattern of racketeering
activity, and that this conduct proximately caused harm to the plaintiff. Wire
fraud, as a predicate act, requires showing a scheme to defraud, use of
wires in furtherance of the scheme, and specific intent to defraud.

S.C. 2011)
U.S. District Court — District of South Carolina
Extract
To establish a claim under RICO, a plaintiff must show: (1) a violation of 18
U.S.C. § 1962, (2) an injury to business or property, and (3) that the injury
was caused by the violation of § 1962. ... As to Defendants first challenge,
the Fourth Circuit has noted “A pattern of racketeering requires at least two
predicate acts.” Al–Abood v. El–Shamari, 217 F.3d 225, 238 (4th Cir.2000).
See also 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5). These predicate acts include “trafficking in
goods or services bearing counterfeit marks,” “mail fraud,” and “wire
fraud.” 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1) (citing 18 U.S.C. §§ 2320, 1341, and 1343).

Summary
The passage provides insight into the statutory framework for a RICO claim,
specifically under 18 U.S.C. § 1962 and § 1961. It highlights that to establish
a RICO claim, a plaintiff must demonstrate a violation of § 1962, an injury to
business or property, and causation. Additionally, it specifies that a pattern
of racketeering activity, which includes wire fraud as a predicate act, is
necessary. This information is directly relevant to the question of what
statutes a father should consider when seeking relief for wire fraud in a
RICO suit.
ESTATE OF DEARING BY DEARING v. Dearing, 646 F.Supp. 903 (S.D. W.Va.
1986)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of West Virginia
Extract
As a starting point, the Court notes that the Plaintiffs' civil RICO action is
given life by the terms of 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c). 'Any person injured in his
business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962 of this chapter
may sue therefor in any appropriate United States District Court and shall
recover threefold the damages he sustains in the cost of the suit, including a
reasonable attorney's fee.' A violation of § 1962 includes acquiring an
interest in or conducting the affairs of an enterprise through 'a pattern of
racketeering activity.' Racketeering activity, as defined in § 1961(1), means
the commission of any one of a laundry list of criminal offenses listed in that
section. A 'pattern of racketeering activity' requires at least two acts of
racketeering activity. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5). Therefore, a civil RICO plaintiff
must allege and prove at least two 'predicate offenses' to succeed in his
action.
Summary
The passage provides insight into the statutes relevant to a civil RICO
action, specifically 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c) and § 1962, which are essential for a
plaintiff seeking relief under RICO. It explains that a plaintiff must allege a
"pattern of racketeering activity," which includes at least two predicate
offenses, such as wire fraud, to succeed in a RICO suit. This is directly
relevant to the question of what statutes a father should consider when
seeking relief for wire fraud in a RICO suit.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
Claims for civil violations of RICO are governed by 18 U.S.C. § 1962. The
statute provides that: It shall be unlawful for any person employed by or
associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect,
interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or
indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of
racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt. 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). To
state a RICO cause of action, a plaintiff must establish four elements: (1)
conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity. ... RICO defines 'racketeering activity' to include a multitude of
offenses that are either 'chargeable' under certain state criminal laws or
'indictable' under specified federal criminal laws. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1). Both
the mail fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1341, and the wire fraud statute, 18
U.S.C. § 1343, are listed as predicate racketeering offenses under RICO.
Summary
The passage from the Uselmann v. Pop case provides insight into the
statutes relevant to a RICO suit involving wire fraud. It specifies that civil
RICO claims are governed by 18 U.S.C. § 1962, which requires establishing a
pattern of racketeering activity. Wire fraud, under 18 U.S.C. § 1343, is
explicitly listed as a predicate offense for RICO claims. This means that if a
father is seeking relief for wire fraud in a RICO suit, he should reference
these statutes as they are directly applicable to his case.

Hall v. Witteman, 569 F.Supp.2d 1208 (D. Kan. 2008)
U.S. District Court — District of Kansas
Extract
Plaintiffs Complaint alleges a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(b), (c) and (d). In
order to bring a RICO claim, a plaintiff must allege a violation of 18 U.S.C. §
1962, which consists of four elements: '(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3)
through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity.' ... 'Racketeering activity' is
defined in 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1)(B) as any 'act which is indictable' under
federal law and specifically includes mail fraud and wire fraud. These
underlying acts are 'referred to as predicate acts, because they form the
basis for liability under RICO.' ... To establish the predicate act of mail fraud
[the plaintiff] must allege '(1) the existence of a scheme or artifice to
defraud or obtain money or property by false pretenses, representations or
promises, and (2) use of the United States mails for the purpose of executing
the scheme.' ... 'The elements of wire fraud are very similar, but require that
the defendant use interstate wire, radio or television communications in
furtherance of the scheme to defraud.'
Summary
To bring a RICO claim involving wire fraud, the plaintiff must allege a
violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1962, which includes demonstrating conduct of an
enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. Wire fraud is
considered a predicate act under 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1)(B), and the plaintiff
must show the use of interstate wire communications in furtherance of a
fraudulent scheme. The passage provides the necessary statutory framework
and elements required to establish a RICO claim based on wire fraud.
United States v. Ames Sintering Co., 927 F.2d 232 (6th Cir. 1990)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Sixth Circuit
Extract
To prove a wire fraud offense under § 1343, the government must establish:
(1) a scheme to defraud; and (2) use of wire communications in furtherance
of the scheme. See Pereira v. United States, 347 U.S. 1, 8, 74 S.Ct. 358, 362,

addition, the government must prove that the scheme must have intended to
deprive a victim of money or property.
Summary
To establish a wire fraud offense under 18 U.S.C. § 1343, it is necessary to
prove a scheme to defraud and the use of wire communications in
furtherance of that scheme. Additionally, there must be an intent to deprive
a victim of money or property. This is relevant to the question as it outlines
the elements required to prove wire fraud, which is a predicate offense
under the RICO statute.

U.S. Court of Appeals — Third Circuit
Extract
The elements required to support a conviction under the mail fraud statute,
18 U.S.C. Sec. 1341, are: 1) a scheme to defraud; and 2) the use of the mails
for the purpose of executing, or attempting to execute, the scheme. See 18
U.S.C. Sec. 1341 (1988 & Supp. III 1993); United States v. Copple, 24 F.3d
535, 544 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 488, 130 L.Ed.2d 400
(1994); United States v. Ruuska, 883 F.2d 262, 264 (3d Cir.1989). The wire
fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1343, is identical to the mail fraud statute
except it speaks of communications transmitted by wire.
Summary
The wire fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1343, is applicable in cases where
there is a scheme to defraud and the use of wire communications to execute
or attempt to execute the scheme. This is relevant to the question as it
provides the statutory basis for seeking relief for wire fraud in a RICO suit.
U.S. v. Goldin Industries, Inc., 219 F.3d 1271 (11th Cir. 2000)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Eleventh Circuit
Extract
A 'pattern' of racketeering activity requires that a defendant commit two
acts of racketeering activity within a ten-year period. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5).
Racketeering activity is defined as the commission of certain federal crimes,
including for our purposes here, the crime of mail fraud pursuant to 18
U.S.C. § 1341. The terms 'person' and 'enterprise' in the statute have been
specifically defined by Congress. A person liable under § 1962(c) is 'any
individual or entity capable of holding a legal or beneficial interest in
property.' 18 U.S.C. § 1961(3). An 'enterprise' under the statute is 'any

=== PAGE 19 ===

individual, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, and
any union or group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal
entity.' 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4).
Summary
The RICO statute requires a pattern of racketeering activity, which includes
the commission of certain federal crimes such as mail fraud. The statute
defines who can be liable and what constitutes an enterprise. This
information is relevant to understanding the legal framework under which a
RICO suit can be brought, including the necessary elements such as the
pattern of racketeering activity and the definition of an enterprise.
Al-Abood v. El-Shamari, 217 F.3d 225 (4th Cir. 2000)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fourth Circuit
Extract
RICO creates civil liability for persons who engage in 'a pattern of
racketeering activity.' 18 U.S.C.A. § 1962, 1964 (West 1984 & Supp. 2000).
'Racketeering activity' is defined as any of a number of predicate acts,
including mail and wire fraud. See 18 U.S.C.A. § 1961(1)(B) (West Supp.
2000). A pattern of racketeering requires at least two predicate acts. See 18
U.S.C.A.§ 1961(5) (West 1984). However, simply proving two or more
predicate acts is insufficient for a RICO plaintiff to succeed; instead, the
RICO plaintiff must also show that the predicate acts are related and that
they constitute or pose a threat of continued criminal activity.
Summary
RICO (Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act) provides a
framework for civil liability when there is a pattern of racketeering activity,
which includes wire fraud as a predicate act. To succeed in a RICO claim,
the plaintiff must demonstrate at least two related predicate acts that pose a
threat of continued criminal activity. This passage is relevant because it
outlines the statutory basis and requirements for pursuing a RICO claim
involving wire fraud.

The passage provides insight into the elements required to establish a civil
RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962, which includes wire fraud as a form of
racketeering activity. This is directly relevant to the question of what
statutes a father should consider when seeking relief for wire fraud in a
RICO suit.

makes it unlawful to use income derived from racketeering, to acquire or
maintain interest in an enterprise through racketeering, to conduct
enterprise affairs through racketeering, and to conspire to commit these
acts. This statute is relevant to a RICO suit as it provides the legal basis for
claims involving racketeering activities, which can include wire fraud as a
predicate offense.

facilitate the promotion, management, establishment, or carrying on, of any
unlawful activity, and thereafter performs or attempts to perform- (A) an act
described in paragraph or shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not
more than 5 years, or both; or (B) an act described in paragraph shall be
fined under this title, imprisoned for not more than 20 years, or both, and if
death results shall be imprisoned for any term of years or for life.
Summary
The passage from 18 U.S.C. § 1952 discusses the use of interstate or foreign
commerce to facilitate unlawful activities, which is relevant to racketeering
cases. Wire fraud, if conducted across state lines, could fall under this
statute as it involves the use of facilities in interstate commerce to promote
or carry on unlawful activities. This statute could potentially be used in a
RICO suit if the wire fraud is part of a pattern of racketeering activity.
18 U.S.C. § 1957 18 U.S.C. § 1957 Engaging In Monetary Transactions In
Property Derived From Specified Unlawful Activity

=== PAGE 25 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
Whoever, in any of the circumstances set forth in subsection (d), knowingly
engages or attempts to engage in a monetary transaction in criminally
derived property of a value greater than $10,000 and is derived from
specified unlawful activity, shall be punished as provided in subsection (b).
Summary
18 U.S.C. § 1957 addresses engaging in monetary transactions with
criminally derived property, which is relevant to RICO cases involving wire
fraud. The statute specifies that knowingly engaging in such transactions
with property derived from unlawful activity is punishable. This can be
applicable in a RICO suit if the wire fraud involved monetary transactions
with criminally derived property.
18 U.S.C. § 2511 18 U.S.C. § 2511 Interception and Disclosure of Wire, Oral,
Or Electronic Communications Prohibited
Extract
Except as otherwise specifically provided in this chapter any person who- (a)
intentionally intercepts, endeavors to intercept, or procures any other
person to intercept or endeavor to intercept, any wire, oral, or electronic
communication; (b) intentionally uses, endeavors to use, or procures any
other person to use or endeavor to use any electronic, mechanical, or other

wire, oral, or electronic communication, intercepted by means authorized by
sections 2511(a)(ii), 2511(b)-(c), 2511(e), 2516, and 2518 of this chapter, (ii)
knowing or having reason to know that the information was obtained
through the interception of such a communication in connection with a
criminal investigation, (iii) having obtained or received the information in
connection with a criminal investigation, and (iv) with intent to improperly
obstruct, impede, or interfere with a duly authorized criminal investigation,
shall be punished as provided in subsection or shall be subject to suit as
provided in subsection.
Summary
18 U.S.C. § 2511 addresses the unlawful interception and disclosure of wire,
oral, or electronic communications. This statute could be relevant in a RICO
suit if the father alleges that his spouse, her grandmother, and her
stepfather engaged in wire fraud by intercepting or disclosing his
communications without consent. The statute outlines the conditions under
which interception is prohibited and the penalties for violations, which could
support claims of wire fraud in the context of a RICO suit.
Mail and wire fraud.
American Criminal Law Review - Georgetown University Law Center -
Green, Christopher G. - 1998-03-22
Extract
The purpose of these two statutes is to prevent the use of the mails or wires
in the furtherance of fraudulent activity. While the two statutes were
separately codified, a majority of the case law dealing with the statutes has
concerned the meaning of a 'scheme to defraud' and the courts have
generally considered the two statutes in conjunction with one another. ...
Prosecutors have also used these statutes to prosecute money laundering
and Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act ('RICO') violations.
A violation of [sections] 1341 or [sections] 1343 can provide the unlawful act
necessary to establish a RICO or money laundering violation.
Summary
The mail and wire fraud statutes (18 U.S.C. §§ 1341 and 1343) are used to
prevent fraudulent activities conducted through mail or wire
communications. These statutes are often used in conjunction with RICO
violations, as a proven mail or wire fraud offense can serve as the predicate
unlawful act necessary to establish a RICO violation. This indicates that in a
RICO suit, the father could seek relief under these statutes if wire fraud is
involved.

Extract
The purpose of the two statutes is to prevent the use of the mails or wires in
the furtherance of fraudulent activity. ... They have also been useful in
prosecuting money laundering and violations of the Racketeer Influenced
and Corrupt Organizations Act ('RICO'). Violating [sections] 1341 and/or
[sections] 1343 can create the unlawful acts necessary to establish a RICO
or money laundering violation.
Summary
The mail and wire fraud statutes (18 U.S.C. §§ 1341 and 1343) are
instrumental in prosecuting fraudulent activities and can serve as predicate
offenses for establishing a RICO violation. This suggests that if the father is
seeking relief for wire fraud in a RICO suit, these statutes would be relevant
as they provide the basis for the fraudulent acts necessary to support a
RICO claim.
MAIL AND WIRE FRAUD
American Criminal Law Review - Georgetown University Law Center -
2021-07-01
Extract
The federal mail2 and wire3 fraud statutes are powerful tools for
prosecutors that apply to a wide range of conduct.4 The statutes have often
been used as a stopgap to enable prosecution of new forms of fraud until
Congress enacts more particular-ized legislation.5 ... (affirming RICO
conviction based on mail and wire fraud); United States v. Goldin Indus.,
Inc., 219 F.3d 1271, 1274 (11th Cir. 2000) (defining racketeering activity as
the commission of certain federal crimes, including mail fraud, pursuant to
18 U.S.C. § 1341); Zichettello, 208 F.3d at 79 (affirming multi-defendant
convictions on counts including: (i) mail fraud in connection with monthly
bribes related to conspiracy to violate RICO and (ii) wire fraud in connection
with campaign finance scheme).
Summary
The federal mail and wire fraud statutes, specifically 18 U.S.C. § 1341 and §
1343, are commonly used in RICO cases. These statutes are considered
powerful tools for addressing a wide range of fraudulent conduct, including
those that may be part of a RICO violation. The passage also references
cases where RICO convictions were affirmed based on mail and wire fraud,
highlighting their applicability in such contexts.

Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy
The Brief - American Bar Association - 2024-01-01
Extract
A violation of § 1962(c), the section on which Sedima relies, requires (1)
conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity. The plaintiff must allege each of the elements to state a claim. They
are all equally essential components, and the complaint will fail if any one of
them is not adequately pleaded. In particular, RICO claims based on mail or
wire fraud must comport with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b)’s
requirement that allegations involving fraud be pleaded with particularity.
Summary
To seek relief for wire fraud under a RICO suit, the father must allege a
violation of § 1962(c) of the RICO statute. This requires demonstrating
conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity, which
includes wire fraud as a predicate act. The allegations must be pleaded with
particularity according to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b).
Theft offenses
Defending Specific Crimes - James Publishing - Timothy E. Zerillo -
2020-04-29
Extract
Wire fraud, 18 U.S.C. §1343, is very similar to the mail fraud statute. It adds
the requirement of the use of an interstate telephone call or electronic
communication made in furtherance of the scheme. See United States v.
Briscoe, 65 F.3d 576, 583 (7th Cir. 1995) (citing United States v. Ames
Sintering Co., 927 F.2d 232, 234 (6th Cir. 1990) (per curiam)); United States
v. Frey, 42 F.3d 795, 797 (3d Cir. 1994). According to United States v. Profit,
49 F.3d 404, 406 n. 1 (8th Cir. 1995), there are four elements of a wire fraud
case: (1) that the defendant voluntarily and intentionally devised or
participated in a scheme to defraud another out of money; (2) that the
defendant did so with the intent to defraud; (3) that it was reasonably
foreseeable that interstate wire communications would be used; and (4) that
interstate wire communications were in fact used.
Summary
Detailed explanation of the elements required to establish a case of wire
fraud under 18 U.S.C. §1343. This statute is relevant to the question as it
outlines the legal framework for pursuing a wire fraud claim, which is a
predicate offense under the RICO Act. The passage specifies the necessary

elements to prove wire fraud, which can be used as a basis for seeking relief
in a RICO suit if the alleged actions of the spouse, grandmother, and
stepfather meet these criteria.
Spoofing and Layering.
The Journal of Corporation Law - University of Iowa Journal of
Corporation Law - Mark, Gideon - 2020-01-01
Extract
Fourth, most recently the DOJ aggressively added the Racketeer Influenced
and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) (231) to its toolbox... Any potential
future use of RICO no doubt will be undertaken in tandem with other
criminal statutes, such as Section 1348. Federal courts have broadly
interpreted Section 1348 (237) since its original enactment as part of the
Sarbanes-oxley Act, (238) and this expansive approach has encouraged the
DoJ to use some combination of criminal provisions in the spoofing cases it
chooses to prosecute. For example, in the 2019 RICO case, defendants were
indicted on numerous additional counts, including wire fraud... the wire
fraud statute provides for harsher penalties than do both CEA Section 4c(a)
(5)(C) and the commodities fraud statute--the former authorizes
imprisonment of up to 30 years for wire fraud affecting a financial
institution, (253) triple what the latter two laws provide.
Summary
The DOJ has been using the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act (RICO) in conjunction with other criminal statutes, such
as Section 1348, which deals with securities and commodities fraud. The
wire fraud statute is also mentioned as a relevant statute that provides for
harsher penalties and has a broader jurisdictional reach. This suggests that
in a RICO suit involving wire fraud, these statutes could be relevant.
Crimes
The Florida Criminal Cases Notebook. Volume 1-2 - James Publishing
- Joseph C. Bodiford - 2021-04-30
Extract
State must specifically plead a RICO conspiracy if it intends to charge a
defendant accordingly. In a RICO conspiracy, the crime is premised not upon
the commission of the predicate acts of racketeering, or even an agreement
to commit predicate acts, but upon an agreement to participate in the affairs
of the criminal enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. While
the state may plead and prove a substantive RICO charge by establishing a
pattern of racketeering activity that includes conspiracies to commit

=== PAGE 30 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
predicate acts, this does not convert a plainly pleaded substantive RICO
charge into a RICO conspiracy. A conspiracy to commit predicate acts of
racketeering is different in kind from a conspiracy to conduct the affairs of
the enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. The former
describes a method by which a substantive RICO can be charged and
proven. The latter describes a RICO conspiracy offense.
Summary
In a RICO suit, it is crucial to distinguish between a substantive RICO
charge and a RICO conspiracy charge. A substantive RICO charge can be
established by proving a pattern of racketeering activity, which may include
conspiracies to commit predicate acts. However, a RICO conspiracy charge
requires an agreement to participate in the affairs of the criminal enterprise
through a pattern of racketeering activity. This distinction is important for
determining the appropriate legal strategy and charges in a RICO suit.
RICO: A Primer
Extract
Among other things, 'racketeering activities' include 'any act which is
indictable under' a list of federal criminal statutes. The list covers an
expansive range of violations, for example, violations of the Hobbs Act, 18
U.S.C. ' 1951 (extortion); 18 U.S.C. ' 1341 (mail fraud) and 1343 (wire fraud);
18 U.S.C. ' 1831 (economic espionage); 18 U.S.C. ' 1832 (theft of trade
secrets); 18 U.S.C. ' 1952 (Travel Act); 18 U.S.C. ' 1956, 1957 (money
laundering); and 18 U.S.C. ' 2318-2320 (copyright infringement). Mail and
wire fraud are the most common predicate acts.
Summary
Wire fraud, as defined under 18 U.S.C. § 1343, is explicitly listed as a
predicate act for racketeering activities under RICO. This means that if a
father is seeking relief for wire fraud in a RICO suit, he should reference 18
U.S.C. § 1343 as the statute under which the wire fraud is indictable. The
passage confirms that wire fraud is one of the most common predicate acts
used in RICO cases, which supports its relevance in this context.

Defending Civil RICO Claims: A Defense Plan Should Be In Every Business's
Arsenal
Extract
RICO is not a simple statute. It pertains to conduct associated with an
'enterprise' and 'a pattern racketeering activity.' An enterprise is an
individual or legal entity, or a union or group of individuals associated in fact
although not a legal entity, while a pattern of racketeering activity requires
long-term, organized conduct to violate state and federal laws. There are
four types of activities outlawed by RICO, and claims under Section 1962(c)
are the most commonly asserted: * Section 1962(a) prohibits a person from
investing in an enterprise any income derived from a pattern of racketeering
activity; * Section 1962(b) prohibits a person from using a pattern of
racketeering activity to acquire or maintain control over an enterprise; *
Section 1962(c) prohibits a person from conducting the affairs of an
enterprise through a pattern of racketeering; and * Section 1962(d)
prohibits a person from conspiring to violate Sections 1962(a), (b), or (c).
Summary
The RICO statute, specifically 18 U.S.C. Sections 1961-68, outlines the types
of activities that are prohibited under RICO. These include investing in an
enterprise with income derived from racketeering (Section 1962(a)), using
racketeering to control an enterprise (Section 1962(b)), conducting an
enterprise's affairs through racketeering (Section 1962(c)), and conspiring
to commit these acts (Section 1962(d)). For a father seeking relief for wire
fraud in a RICO suit, these sections provide the statutory basis for claims
related to racketeering activities, including wire fraud, if they are part of a
pattern of racketeering activity.

Arsenal

=== PAGE 32 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
Congress passed the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act
(RICO), 18 U.S.C. Sections 1961-68... RICO is not a simple statute. It
pertains to conduct associated with an 'enterprise' and 'a pattern
racketeering activity.'... Second, to prove most types of RICO claims, the
plaintiff must plead that the defendant committed some qualifying criminal
action, the most common of which is mail, wire or securities fraud.
Summary
The passage provides insight into the requirements for a RICO claim,
specifically mentioning that wire fraud is a qualifying criminal action that
can be used to establish a RICO claim. This is directly relevant to the
question as it identifies wire fraud as a potential basis for a RICO suit. The
passage also outlines the necessity of proving a pattern of racketeering
activity and the involvement of an "enterprise," which are essential elements
in a RICO claim.
