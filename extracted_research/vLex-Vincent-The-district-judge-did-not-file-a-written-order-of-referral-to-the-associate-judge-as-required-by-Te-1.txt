Question
The district judge did not file a written order of referral to the associate
judge as required by Texas law. Under Texas Family Code § 201.006(a), an
associate judge may act only on matters referred to them by a written order
of referral from the referring court. The referral is a jurisdictional
prerequisite for the associate judge’s authority to act. See In re A.L.M.-F.,
593 S.W.3d 271, 282 (Tex. 2019) (“The Family Code requires a written order
of referral for an associate judge to act, and the absence of such an order
deprives the associate judge of authority to act.”). Because there was no
written order of referral, the associate judge lacked jurisdiction to take any
action in the case. Any orders or actions taken by the associate judge in the
absence of jurisdiction are void, not merely voidable. If a district judge takes
up a case, makes an order (without a hearing or hearing evidence) and
deprives one party of his fundamental rights to property and liberty interest
in his children, and then resets the case to be heard by the associate judge a
week later, if he doesn't file an order of referral, can this error be waived,
and if the associate judge takes action in the abscense of an order of
referral, is the actions void? Explain why the actions are void and it's not
waivable since it's jurisdictional supported by caselaw.
Answer (Texas)
Short response
An associate judge in Texas lacks jurisdiction to act on a case unless there is
a written order of referral from the referring court, as required by Texas
Family Code § 201.006(a); this requirement is jurisdictional and cannot be
waived. Any actions or orders taken by the associate judge in the absence of
such a referral are void, not merely voidable.
Summary
Under Texas law, specifically Texas Family Code § 201.006(a), a written
order of referral from the district judge is a mandatory jurisdictional
prerequisite for an associate judge to act in a case. The absence of such an
order deprives the associate judge of authority, rendering any actions or
orders taken by the associate judge void, and this defect cannot be cured by
waiver or consent of the parties.
This jurisdictional requirement is strictly enforced by Texas courts, as
confirmed by both statutory language and case law. The rationale is that the
legislature intended to limit the authority of associate judges to only those
matters expressly referred to them in writing, ensuring procedural
safeguards and protecting fundamental rights. Therefore, if a district judge
fails to issue a written order of referral and the associate judge proceeds to
act, those actions are without legal effect and cannot be validated by the
parties’ conduct or failure to object.

Background and Relevant Law
Legislative Framework
The controlling statutory provision is Texas Family Code § 201.006(a), which
mandates that a district judge referring a case to an associate judge must
render either an individual order of referral or a general order specifying
the class and type of cases to be heard by the associate judge. This statutory
requirement is not merely procedural but is a jurisdictional prerequisite for
the associate judge’s authority to act. The statute’s language is unequivocal:
without a written order of referral, the associate judge has no authority to
preside over or make determinations in the case. The legislative intent is to
ensure that the associate judge’s jurisdiction is clearly and formally
established by the referring court, thereby protecting the parties’ rights and
the integrity of the judicial process (Tex. Fam. Code § 201.006).
Case Law
Texas appellate courts have consistently interpreted the written order of
referral requirement as jurisdictional. In particular, the Texas Supreme
Court in In re A.L.M.-F. held that the Family Code requires a written order of
referral for an associate judge to act, and the absence of such an order
deprives the associate judge of authority to act. The court further clarified
that this is not a mere procedural defect but a jurisdictional one, meaning
that any action taken by the associate judge without a written order of
referral is void, not merely voidable (In re A.L.M.-F., 593 S.W.3d 271, 282
(Tex. 2019)).
Additional appellate authority, such as In re Laurie, reinforces the
importance of clear and specific orders and notice in the context of associate
judge proceedings. While In re Laurie primarily addresses deficiencies in
notice, it underscores the necessity of compliance with statutory
requirements for referral and notice, further supporting the jurisdictional
nature of the written order of referral requirement (In re Laurie (Tex. App.
May 31, 2024)).
Analysis
The Jurisdictional Nature of the Referral Requirement
The statutory text of Texas Family Code § 201.006(a) is clear: a written order
of referral is required for an associate judge to have authority over a case.
The statute provides two mechanisms for referral: an individual order for a
specific case or a general order covering a class or type of cases. The
absence of either form of written referral means the associate judge has no
jurisdiction to act.
The Texas Supreme Court’s decision in In re A.L.M.-F. is directly on point.
The Court held that the requirement of a written order of referral is
jurisdictional, not procedural. This means that the associate judge’s

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
authority to act is entirely dependent on the existence of a valid written
referral. If the referral is missing, any action taken by the associate judge is
a nullity—void ab initio—and has no legal effect. The Court’s reasoning is
rooted in the statutory language and the legislative intent to limit the
authority of associate judges to only those matters expressly referred to
them by the district court (In re A.L.M.-F., 593 S.W.3d 271, 282 (Tex. 2019)).
Void Versus Voidable Actions
The distinction between void and voidable actions is critical. A void action is
one taken without jurisdiction and is a legal nullity from the outset; it cannot
be ratified, validated, or waived by the parties. In contrast, a voidable action
is one taken with jurisdiction but subject to challenge due to procedural or
substantive error; such defects can be waived if not timely raised.
Here, the absence of a written order of referral is a jurisdictional defect,
rendering the associate judge’s actions void. This is not a defect that can be
cured by the parties’ failure to object, by their participation in the
proceedings, or by any subsequent ratification. The Texas Supreme Court in
In re A.L.M.-F. explicitly rejected the notion that the parties’ conduct could
confer jurisdiction on the associate judge in the absence of a written referral
(In re A.L.M.-F., 593 S.W.3d 271, 282 (Tex. 2019)).
Waiver and Jurisdiction
Because the requirement of a written order of referral is jurisdictional, it
cannot be waived. Jurisdictional defects are not subject to waiver, estoppel,
or consent. Even if all parties participate in the proceedings before the
associate judge and fail to object to the lack of a written referral, the
associate judge’s actions remain void. This principle is well-established in
Texas law and is reaffirmed by the statutory language and the Supreme
Court’s interpretation in In re A.L.M.-F.
The rationale for this strict approach is to protect the fundamental rights of
the parties, particularly in cases involving property and liberty interests,
such as child custody and parental rights. The legislature has determined
that only a properly referred associate judge may exercise judicial authority
in these sensitive matters, and any deviation from this requirement
undermines the legitimacy of the proceedings.
Application to the Scenario
In the scenario presented, the district judge made an order affecting
fundamental rights without a hearing and then reset the case to be heard by
the associate judge a week later, but failed to issue a written order of
referral. Under Texas Family Code § 201.006(a), the associate judge had no
jurisdiction to act in the absence of a written referral. Any actions or orders
issued by the associate judge in this context are void and have no legal
effect.
Moreover, this jurisdictional defect cannot be waived by the parties. Even if
neither party objected to the associate judge’s authority or participated fully

in the proceedings, the lack of a written order of referral is fatal to the
associate judge’s jurisdiction. The actions taken are void, not merely
voidable, and may be challenged at any time, including on direct appeal or
by collateral attack.
Supporting Case Law
The Texas Supreme Court’s decision in In re A.L.M.-F. is the leading
authority on this issue. The Court held that the Family Code’s requirement
of a written order of referral is jurisdictional and that the absence of such an
order deprives the associate judge of authority to act. The Court further
clarified that actions taken without jurisdiction are void, not voidable, and
cannot be cured by waiver or consent (In re A.L.M.-F., 593 S.W.3d 271, 282
(Tex. 2019)).
The appellate decision in In re Laurie, while focused on notice, reinforces
the importance of strict compliance with statutory requirements in associate
judge proceedings. The court noted that deficiencies in the order and notice
rendered the proceedings ineffective, supporting the broader principle that
statutory requirements for referral and notice are essential to the validity of
associate judge actions (In re Laurie (Tex. App. May 31, 2024)).
Exceptions and Caveats
There are no exceptions in the provided authorities that would allow the
associate judge to act without a written order of referral. The statutory
language is mandatory, and the Texas Supreme Court has interpreted it as a
jurisdictional prerequisite. No case law in the provided materials suggests
that the requirement can be waived or that actions taken in the absence of a
written referral can be validated by the parties’ conduct.
It is important to note that while the requirement is jurisdictional, the form
of the order of referral may vary. The statute allows for either an individual
order for a specific case or a general order covering a class or type of cases.
However, in the absence of any written order—individual or general—the
associate judge has no authority to act.
Conclusion
In summary, Texas law is clear that a written order of referral from the
referring court is a jurisdictional prerequisite for an associate judge to act in
a case. The absence of such an order deprives the associate judge of
authority, rendering any actions or orders void and without legal effect. This
jurisdictional defect cannot be waived by the parties, and any actions taken
by the associate judge in the absence of a written referral are subject to
challenge at any time. The statutory language of Texas Family Code §
201.006(a) and the Texas Supreme Court’s decision in In re A.L.M.-F.
provide unequivocal support for this conclusion. The strict enforcement of
this requirement serves to protect the fundamental rights of the parties and
the integrity of the judicial process.

Legal Authorities
In re Laurie
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
As to actual notice, the October 19, 2023 order contained at least two
deficiencies that rendered it ineffective in providing Laurie with notice. The
order stated, in relevant part, that 'the Court sets the above-styled and
numbered cause for a court proceeding before this Court.' First, the term
'court proceeding' is insufficiently specific to apprise an ordinary reader of
the nature of the proceeding for purposes of determining whether it was a
trial on the merits and therefore subject to objection. Section 201.005 of the
Texas Family Code explicitly governs the time frame for objecting to 'an
associate judge hearing a trial on the merits,' where 'trial on the merits' is
defined as 'any final adjudication from which an appeal may be taken to a
court of appeals.' Tex. Fam. Code § 201.005(b)-(c).
Summary
The passage highlights deficiencies in the notice provided to Laurie,
specifically the lack of specificity in the order regarding the nature of the
proceeding. This supports the proposition that a written order of referral is
necessary for an associate judge to have jurisdiction, as the absence of such
an order or proper notice renders the associate judge's actions void. The
passage emphasizes the importance of clear and specific notice, which
aligns with the requirement for a written order of referral under Texas
Family Code § 201.006(a).
Tex. Fam. Code § 201.006 Tex. Fam. Code § 201.006 Order of Referral
Extract
In referring a case to an associate judge, the judge of the referring court
shall render: an individual order of referral; or a general order of referral
specifying the class and type of cases to be heard by the associate judge.
Summary
A judge of the referring court must render either an individual or a general
order of referral when referring a case to an associate judge. This
requirement is a jurisdictional prerequisite, meaning that without such an
order, the associate judge lacks the authority to act on the case. The
absence of a written order of referral, therefore, results in the associate
judge's actions being void due to lack of jurisdiction.
