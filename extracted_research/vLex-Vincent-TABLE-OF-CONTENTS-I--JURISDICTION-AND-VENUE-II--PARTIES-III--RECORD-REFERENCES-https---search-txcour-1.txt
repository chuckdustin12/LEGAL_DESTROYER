Plaintiff incorporates by reference public records from the Texas Supreme
Court, and requests the court to take judicial notice of these documents. The
Fifth Circuit has repeatedly held that it is proper for federal courts to take
judicial notice of matters of public record, including documents filed in state
court proceedings (Miller v. Dunn, 35 F.4th 1007 (5th Cir. 2022); LUV N'
Care, Ltd. v. Jackel Int'l Ltd., 502 F.Supp.3d 1106 (W.D. La. 2020); Wright v.
Arlington Indep. Sch. Dist., Civil Action No. 4:19-cv-00278-P (N.D. Tex. Nov
25, 2019)). Plaintiff therefore requests that this Court take judicial
knowledge of the consolidated mandamus record, as its’ authenticity is not
reasonably disputed. Here, all record references point to the public
consolidated mandamus record, as submitted to the Texas Supreme Court, a
copy of which has been served upon each defendant named in this complaint
either individually or through their agent. Link to the record: https://

bc41-bbc08c814365 All references to the record are marked herein with
“REC. [page]” and are hyperlinked to take the reader directly to the
reference. The record is filed under affidavit, and remains unopposed at the
time of filing this complaint. Therefore, Plaintiff respectfully asks that the
Court take judicial notice of the record under Federal Rule of Evidence 201,
filed on June 6, 2025, in the Texas Supreme Court under case numbers
25-0361, 25-0367, 25-0378, 25-0426, and 25-0458. II. TIMELINE OF
EVENTS BACKGROUND Morgan Michelle Myers, (“Myers”) and Charles
Dustin Myers, (“Plaintiff”) were married on June 20, 2015, and have two
daughters, C.R.M. and M.E.M, aged seven and nine. The evidence in this
case will show that in early December of 2023, the entire family was
blindsided by Myers’ sudden announcement that she wanted a divorce from
Plaintiff. REC. 717 The evidence will further show that Myers’ reasoning for
this divorce changes over time – beginning with how Plaintiff spoke to her,
and then switches to abuse and sexual harassment, and allegations of drug
abuse, claims that were only brought up in her initial pleadings. On
December 12, 2023, Plaintiff discovered a large volume of text messages
between Myers and two individuals identified as Debbie Price and Damen
Kazlauskas of Fort Worth, Texas spanning between October 2022 and
December 2023. REC. 254-714 In response to this discovery, Myers began to
communicate with Defendant Daniel Kenneth Branthoover, a resident of
Yukon, Oklahoma, who assisted her in the planning, drafting, traveling, and
submitting of fraudulent documents to the 322nd District Court of Tarrant
County designed to divest Plaintiff of his home and business operations.
When these allegations were raised to the State, they failed to adjudicate
them and violated the Plaintiff’s constitutional rights when he was deprived
of the guarantees of equal protection under the law and when he was not
afforded due process before being deprived of his property. REC. 183. The
central question is whether Defendants Munford, Kaitcer, Carter, and Baker
are victims of the initial scheme – or willing participants in an expanded
associate-in-fact enterprise that began in December of 2023 as the Myers-
Branthoover enterprise. A. The Myers-Branthoover Enterprise 1. On
December 14, 2023, Defendants Morgan Michelle Myers (“Myers)” and
Daniel Kenneth Branthoover (“Branthoover”), acting in concert and under
deceptive pretenses, (REC. 1704), initiated text-message communications
through which they formed and advanced a common plan and agreement.
Over the weekend of December 15, 2023, they met in Yukon, Oklahoma, to
further that plan ( REC. 274-278). The deceptive text message from
Defendant Branthoover claiming that he wanted to assist Plaintiff was
following an attempt by Myers to receive an ex-parte order of protection
from the 322nd District Court of Tarrant county, attempted on December 14,
2023 (REC. 78). B. Interstate Travel and Transfer 2. As part of their
agreement, both Defendants planned to draft and submit an original petition
for divorce and an affidavit of indigency to the 322nd District Court of
Tarrant County, with the intended and foreseeable result of removing
Plaintiff from his matrimonial residence at 6641 Anne Court, Watauga, Texas
76148—which also serves as his place of business for clients in the United
States, Canada, and the United Kingdom that rely on his market data
services (REC. 812 ¶ 16). 3. During Defendant Myers’s interstate travel, she
transferred the parties’ marital funds into Defendant Branthoover’s PayPal
account in the amount of $1,576 (REC. 723). Those proceeds funded a
second mobile phone (817-940-0852), listed on the fraudulent pleadings that

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Myers and Branthoover jointly prepared in Oklahoma, which Myers then
carried from Yukon to Texas on December 17, 2023 (REC. 86; 99; 102; 107).
C. Admissions 4. On December 16, 2023, Plaintiff reached out to
Branthoover and requested that the $1,576 be returned as they were needed
for Christmas gifts for the children, and for business advertising expenses
for his business. REC. 728-729. In response, defendant Branthoover
admitted that the purpose of defendant Myers’ visit was to help her prepare
paperwork for divorce litigation and confirmed that the transfer of $1,576
did in fact occur. REC. 730. Plaintiff’s bank statement from December 2023
further confirms this transaction. REC. 723. D. Post-submission
Collaboration 5. On December 18, 2023, defendant Myers submitted the
fraudulently prepared original petition for divorce, and an affidavit of
indigency to the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County. After these
documents were submitted, defendant Branthoover sent a text message to
Plaintiff on December 19, 2023, at 5:50 P.M. CST, holding himself out to be
defendant Myers’ attorney, showing his involvement extends past the initial
help in preparing the fraudulent documents. REC. 1712-1713 6. Four days
later, on December 22, 2023, defendant Myers submitted another knowingly
fraudulent application for protective to the 322nd District Court of Tarrant
County claiming that family violence had occurred on December 18, 2023,
supported by both an affidavit and unsworn declaration. REC. 108-109. E.
Significant and Intentional Misrepresentations 7. On December 27 and
December 28, 2023, respectively, the documents prepared by Myers with
the assistance of Branthoover were served on Plaintiff via the U.S.
Constable, and contained the following misrepresentations: i. That
defendant Myers could not afford court costs; REC. 72, REC. 85-96 ii. That
defendant Myers had an active order of protection against the Plaintiff with
a finding of family violence that had occurred during the marriage; REC. 78
at 10 iii. That defendant Myers was financially responsible for the family
vehicles, rent payments, utilities, and other household expenses, making
herself appear as the primary breadwinner; REC. 92 iv. That defendant
Myers would be harassed or abused if Plaintiff were given her newly
acquired phone number that was obtained while in Oklahoma; REC. 81 at
15. v. That defendant Myers and Plaintiff ceased living together on
December 1, 2023; REC. 74 at 4 vi. That family violence occurred on
December 18, 2023, in the presence of the two Children. REC. 108-109. vii.
That both family vehicles were defendant Myers’ separate property acquired
before marriage. REC. 79 at 11B F. Evidence to the Contrary 8. On the same
day Defendant Myers claimed to be in an emergency requiring the Plaintiff’s
prompt removal from the home, she can be seen at the home with Plaintiff
and the children in no state of emergency and also still cohabitating in the
marital home. REC 1715. 9. Again, on December 29, 2023, Defendant Myers
can be seen with Plaintiff at the family home, smiling and laughing with the
children in no state of emergency and still collaborating with Plaintiff in the
marital home. REC. 1735. 10. The citation for the application for protective
order ordered Respondent to show cause as to why it should not issue with a
hearing scheduled for January 16, 2024. REC. 118. 11. In response to
extensive misrepresentation above, Plaintiff prepared an original answer,
filed a motion to consolidate, and provided background information which
alleged that defendant Myers was intentionally abusing the legal process.
REC. 130-132. Plaintiff was ordered to show cause on January 16, 2024,
regarding the protective order application. REC. 118 G. Inclement Weather

and First Appearance 12. On January 15, 2024, the Tarrant County District
Courts Facebook page sent out a notice informing the members of the public
that the court would be closed on January 16, 2024, due to inclement
weather. REC. 1202. 13. Unaware of the closure at the time, the parties
appeared at the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County on January 16, 2024,
and were met with a dark courtroom, with only one judge in the building at
the time of their arrival – Defendant James Munford (“Munford”). 14.
Defendant Munford summarily ordered the Plaintiff out of his home,
inadvertently assisting the Myers-Branthoover associate-in-fact enterprise of
achieving their primary goal in having the Plaintiff removed from his
residence, despite the broader goal being to obtain a decree of divorce to
permanently divest Plaintiff of his interests. REC. 183. 15. Defendant
Munford’s initial order was baseless, made in the absence of any emergency,
without a hearing, and disregarded the Plaintiff’s pleadings, telling Myers
“you’re going to have to find evidence of family violence!” clearly aware that
this order was made without any regard to the Plaintiff’s constitutional
rights. 16. Defendant Jeffrey Kaitcer, (“Kaitcer”) walked into the courtroom
late due to the inclement weather and turned the courtroom into a laughing
matter as he began to joke with Defendant Munford, and instructed the
parties to download the AppClose app for communication, and the matter
was reset for January 22, 2024. There exists no record of this proceeding,
only marked appearances on the docket. H. Reset #1 – January 22, 2024,
Setting 17. At the January 22 reset hearing, the parties appeared only to
have the case reset once more because defendant Myers allegedly retained
the services of Defendant Cooper Carter, (“Carter”) in the lobby of the
courthouse just moments before the hearing was scheduled to begin. No
appearance can be traced to this setting by either party on the docket (REC.
1551), and once again, no hearing was held, and the case reset for a second
time to February 1, 2024. REC. 186. 18. Kaitcer permitted attorney Dan
Bacalis, Plaintiff’s prior attorney, to fill out the Associate Judge’s Report, and
the parties never went before him as indicated by the case docket’s lack of
appearance on this date by either party. I. Reset #2 – February 1, 2024,
Setting 19. One day prior to the February 1 setting, both attorneys,
Defendant Carter and Dan Bacalis, both amended the petition for divorce
and counterpetition for divorce without the parties’ knowledge. (REC. 189,
REC. 209) These amended documents were similar, submitted on the same
day, and raised concerns for Plaintiff regarding his quality of representation.
20. At the February 1 setting, both parties were in the conference rooms
outside of Defendant Kaitcer’s courtroom, when attorney Bacalis walks in
holding a settlement agreement. When Plaintiff refused this option and
requested that they go have a hearing before the judge. 21. This is when
Bacalis stated, as witness affidavits corroborate, that he “knows this Judge
and this is the best we can get.” and further stated “[w]e’ll be here all day.
We can come back and change it later.” 22. Outraged by this response,
Plaintiff paid very close attention to the settlement offer Bacalis was
pressuring him to sign, and noticed the following provisions: A typed written
Order conforming to this Report will follow within 20 days from the date this
Report is signed. The Temporary Order shall be prepared by DAN BACALIS.
Each attorney should approve the Order. The parties do not need to approve
the Order. The attorney reviewing the proposed Order shall have five (5)
days to do so. There arc no ten (JO) day letters. If an agreement is not
reached, a Motion to Sign shall be filed and set within thirty (30) days from

=== PAGE 5 ===

the signing of this Report. IT IS SO ORDERED (REC. 233) J. Termination of
Counsel and the Emergency Motion 23. With the above provisions in mind,
Plaintiff signed the document and immediately fired his attorney and
provided notice to the court. REC. 221. By doing so, Plaintiff gained access
back to the residency, invalidated the agreement, and was able to use the
time back in the house to run damage control on his business operations
while preparing to expose the Myers-Branthoover enterprise to the court via
a MOTION TO RECONSIDER EVIDENCE AND VACATE TEMPORARY
ORDERS, which was filed on February 9, 2024, within three business days of
the February 1 agreed associate judge’s report being served by the clerk.
REC. 240 24. In this motion, it was specifically stated that: i. “I am seeking
immediate court intervention to correct procedural e rrors and address the
misuse of the legal system by the Petitioner.” REC. 244 ii. “Particularly, Dan
Branthoover became involved. He is the boyfriend of the Petitioner’s Mother.
Shortly thereafter, I received a notice from our joint bank account stating
that $1,576 had just been withdrawn. As our bank statement for December
2023 will demonstrate – the transaction record shows the funds being
transferred directly to Mr. Branthoover’s PayPal account” REC. 245 iii. “The
Petitioner's action of filing for divorce under an Affidavit of Inability to pay
three days after transferring $1,576 to herself starkly contravenes the
mandates set forth in Chapter 10, Section 10.001 of the Civil Practice and
Remedies Code”. REC 247 at B2 iv. “The Petitioner violated Chapter 10,
Section 10.001 a second time within the same document when she
intentionally elected to waive the 60-day waiting period claiming to have an
active protective order against me that found family violence had occurred
during our marriage.” REC 247 at B3. v. “This suit was the second attempt
by the Petitioner to have me removed from the home, which ultimately
succeeded.” REC 248 at D1 25. The motion went on to explain the factual
pattern described up to this point, putting the court on notice of the key
issues with provided exhibits which were duly served on Carter. In response
to Plaintiff’s motion, he received the first of just two email communications
from Carter throughout the case’s history, where she claimed she would be
filing a counter motion when disclosing her availability for the hearing on
Plaintiff’s emergency motion. REC. 2794 No such countermotion was filed
by Carter. K. Summary Judgment and Notice of Hearing 26. By February 22,
no response had been filed by Carter, so Plaintiff filed a Partial Motion for
Summary Judgment. REC. 758. Plaintiff also submitted a proposed parenting
plan as Exhibit D. REC. 769. No response was ever received from Carter. 27.
On February 27, 2024, Defendant Munford signed and issued a notice of
hearing to the parties with the hearing set for March 14, 2024. REC. 776. L.
Plaintiff’s Notice to the Court and Defendant Myers’ Self-Help Remedies 28.
On March 3, 2024, Plaintiff notified the Court that he would not be leaving
the home as it was not in the best interests of his children. REC. 782. 29.
The following day, on March 6, 2024, while walking his daughters to school,
Myers ran inside the family home, and locked him out of the marital
residence, leaving a sign on the door that said “[y]ou should have been out
by Saturday you are now locked out!” REC. 1748. 30. Plaintiff called local
law enforcement to help him regain entry into the home, where mother
produced the agreed associate judge’s report signed on February 1, 2024,
and used it as a means to block Plaintiff’s entrance to the home. 31. To avoid
further conflict, Plaintiff was escorted into the home where he was able to
grab only his computer and a few clothes and went to Flower Mound to

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
temporarily stay with his father until the time of the hearing on his
emergency motion, scheduled for March 14, 2024, at 9:00 A.M. L. The
Hearing On Plaintiff’s Emergency Motion 32. On March 14, 2024, the
parties arrived at the 322nd District Court, and on the way into the
courtroom, defendants Myers and Carter could be seen in the conference
room, quickly shuffling papers back and forth. 33. After checking in with the
bailiff, Plaintiff turned around to see defendant Carter extending to him a
document titled “Temporary Orders” that were the reduced version of the
February 1 associate judge’s report. REC. 888. 34. These orders, which were
not prepared by Dan Bacalis, which were not agreed to by the parties, were
reduced well outside of the 20-day requirement as ordered by the judge, and
which were never filed with the clerk, stated the following
misrepresentations: i. On February 1, 2024, the Court heard Petitioner's
motion for temporary orders. ii. The parties have agreed to the terms of this
order as evidenced by the signatures below. REC. 888. iii. The Court, after
examining the record and the agreement of the parties and hearing the
evidence and argument of counsel, finds that all necessary prerequisites of
the law have been legally satisfied and that the Court has jurisdiction of this
case and of all the parties. REC. 888. iv. The dates that the parties would
have access to the family residence was altered, changing the date Plaintiff
was supposed to leave from March 1, 2024, to March 20, 2024, and
changing Myers’ date of re-entry from March 1, 2024, to March 30, 2024,
leaving a 10-day window where no one would occupy the residence. v. This
modification was made to prevent Myers from being liable for illegally
locking Plaintiff out of the home on March 6, 2024. 35. On the last page of
the orders, Plaintiff’s attorney who was terminated weeks earlier did not
sign the document, and Plaintiff refused to sign the document for the
forthcoming reasons: i. It claimed a hearing occurred on a motion which was
never set for a hearing or served on the Plaintiff and doesn’t exist on the
docket. ii. It was prepared by defendant Carter, not Dan Bacalis. iii. The
associate judge was presiding over a de novo request of his own prior
report. iv. The matrimonial address was incorrect, as it stated “6641 Anns
Court”, rather than 6641 Anne Court. REC. 915, REC. 922 v. The orders
were not in the best interests of the children. vi. Notwithstanding the
Plaintiff’s revocation of consent by filing the emergency motion, the terms
were altered right before they were rendered into effect by defendant
Kaitcer. vii. Plaintiff did not agree to the terms as he was in court that very
day to expose Myers. M. Predicate Acts: Extortion 36. Kaitcer, knowing that
no response was filed, knowing that he was presiding over a hearing to
which he had no subject matter jurisdiction, and knowing that the temporary
orders produced by defendant Carter was served just moments earlier,
signed another associate judge’s report pre-drafted by defendant Carter,
which summarily denied the Plaintiff’s emergency motion, ignored the fact
that Carter had not provided a response, and within the report itself,
Plaintiff was ordered to sign the document that Carter had just presented to
him despite raising objections to its’ contents, and despite his consent not
being present. REC. 795. 37. Finally, defendant Kaitcer refused to consider
Plaintiff’s exhibits, including six affidavits prepared by his business clients
who have been directly affected by his inability to provide the real-time
market data services his clients relied on, who were located throughout the
United States. REC. 851; REC. 854; REC. 857; REC. 860; REC. 863; REC.
867; REC. 870. 38. Following the setting, the orders were rendered into

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
effect without Plaintiff’s signature (REC. 925) , and Plaintiff filed a request
for findings of fact and conclusions of law (REC. 883), and filed and
amended a “Preparatory Notice for Judicial Review” which recounted the
factual timeline up to that point, and included the affidavits that Kaitcer
refused to accept on March 14, 2024. REC. 798, REC. 851, REC. 854, REC.
857, REC. 860, REC. 863, REC. 867, REC. 870. 39. The orders stated they
were to remain in effect until the final decree of divorce, and Plaintiff’s
journey of one-sided appeals began. N. One Sided Appellate Efforts, and
Defective IWO 40. Following the rendition of the temporary orders on March
26, 2024, Plaintiff spent between April 8, 2024 and September 15, 2024,
appealing via mandamus to the Second Court of Appeals and the Texas
Supreme Court. REC. 1010. 41. During the appellate efforts, Carter filed one
of two motions in the case, which was a motion for pre-trial conference filed
on April 24, 2024, on her behalf by Roderick D. Marx, a party not named in
the suit. REC. 1014, REC. 1016. 42. Plaintiff immediately objected to the
pre-trial conference, and no response was ever issued by Carter or the
court. REC. 1018. 43. On April 30th, Plaintiff filed his notice of completion
regarding the parenting course as ordered, despite actively trying to vacate
them. REC. 1047. No parenting course was ever completed by Myers. 44. On
May 2, 2024, Plaintiff’s en banc reconsideration was denied in the Second
Court of Appeals, and he began preparing an appeal to the Supreme Court
of Texas. REC. 1067. 45. On May 19, 2024, Carter sent the second and last
email correspondence that would be received in the case, which falsely
claimed he agreed to the orders signed on March 14, 2024, and requested
that he fill out an IWO, which Plaintiff found to be defective. REC. 1722,
REC. 1728. No further correspondence was received by Carter. O.
Fraudulent Intervention and Branthoover’s Continued Involvement 46. On
June 23rd Plaintiff filed a motion in state court entitled MOTION FOR
JOINDER OF PERSONS NEEDED FOR JUST ADJUDICATION at 12:14 P.M.
REC. 1075. This motion received no response from Carter. 47. On June 23rd
at 1:54 P.M., directly following the submission of the motion, Branthoover
texted Plaintiff stating “Lol. And here comes another denial. Please sue me
individually. Please.”, referring to the earlier filed motion and showing his
continued oversight of the case’s progression since his initial predicate acts.
48. Four days later, on June 28, 2024, the Texas Office of the Attorney
General allegedly filed an intervention pleading, claiming that Plaintiff was
past due on child support, and requested information from Plaintiff. REC.
1099. 49. Most notably, the certificate of service to this intervention
pleading was allegedly signed by Holly Hayes, the designated attorney for
the OAG, yet the name underneath the signature line reads CHOYA
BURKLEY. REC. 1102. 50. Plaintiff promptly objected to the intervention,
and never received any response from the OAG, Carter, or the court. REC.
1106. P. Supreme Court, Rule 12, and Emergency Temporary Orders 51. As
Plaintiff continued to appeal to the Supreme Court of Texas, all prosecution
came to an end in the trial court. It wasn’t until September 15, 2024, that
Plaintiff filed a first amended rehearing motion in the Texas Supreme Court,
(REC. 1136) and after noticing Carter’s lack of participation, he began to
question her authority given several ambiguities surrounding her
representation, and filed a rule 12 motion to show authority. REC. 1170. No
response was ever received to this motion from Carter. 52. At this point,
Plaintiff had been staying in Airbnb homes while he sought relief to ensure
he could remain close to his daughters during this time. On September 26,

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
2024, he filed and later amended an EMERGENCY MOTION FOR
TEMPORARY ORDERS and requested expedited relief by October 1, 2024,
as that was when Plaintiff was forced to move away from the area due to
cost of living being unsustainable. REC. 1184. No response was ever
received from Carter regarding this motion. 53. By October 1, Plaintiff had
no choice but to start pursuing administrative remedies, and thought the
court was biased against him given the case’s history up to that point. He
began to prepare a Joint Motion to Recuse defendants Munford and Kaitcer
and filed it with the clerk of the court on October 7, 2024. REC. 1197. Q.
Predicate Act: Wire Fraud 54. On October 8, 2024, Defendant Munford
signed and forwarded a “Joint Motion to Recuse” attached to his order of
referral to regional presiding judge David L. Evans but was notably missing
the exhibits and affidavit critical to the motion. REC. 1222 55. A copy of this
exchange was sent via defendant Baker on 4:43 P.M. on October 8. REC.
1254 56. Plaintiff immediately pointed out the discrepancies between the
motion filed and the motion forwarded to David L. Evans, where she replied
and admitted that the full document had been e-filed and remains with the
court. REC. 1255 57. Unsatisfied with this response, Plaintiff further pointed
out that the filing size of the document filed and the one referring to David
L. Evans was significantly different. No further correspondence was
received by Baker until the following day. REC. 1256 58. The following day
on October 8, 2024, defendant Munford signed and filed an “Amended Order
of Referral” which had the full motion attached this time, albeit still
modified as the hyperlinks and bookmarks had been removed. REC. 1282 59.
This amended referral was sent via email correspondence by Baker at 11:17
A.M. on October 8, 2024, who stated that due to the size of the motion, it
was split into three parts. REC. 1258. This excuse directly contradicts the
standard filing procedure in Tarrant County, which was raised and
subsequently ignored in an objection. REC. 1269. No response was filed in
regard to the motion to recuse or objection by Carter. R. Recusal Denial and
More Delays, and Federal Removal 60. Justice E. Lee Gabriel was assigned
to hear the motion, which had to be rescheduled due to technical difficulties
for November 7, 2024. REC. 1306. 61. The morning of the hearing, Plaintiff
woke up with a dental emergency, and promptly notified all parties, and
requested a reset for the hearing, which everyone agreed to. REC.
1393-1396. 62. Despite this agreement, the recusal was denied for failure to
appear, and made no mention of the agreement or the emergency. REC.
1398. 63. With no other remedies left, Plaintiff removed the case to Federal
Court on December 2, 2024, which was quickly remanded back on
December 4, 2024. REC. 1426. 64. On December 14, 2024, defendant
Branthoover texted Plaintiff, sending a threat which stated “[w]hen things
all over, you get to deal with me.” at 2:15 P.M. REC. 1720 65. On December
16, 2024, Plaintiff initiated suit against Daniel Kenneth Branthoover in the
Western District of Oklahoma seeking relief in the form of damages from the
ongoing deprivation from his home. REC. 1451. 66. Plaintiff notified the
Texas court of this lawsuit on December 31, 2024. REC. 1446. S. Further
Delays, Motion to Dismiss for Want of Prosecution, and the Original SAPCR
67. On January 24, 2025, Plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss for want of
prosecution due to the total lack of participation in the case by the opposing
party. REC. 1527. No response was ever received from Carter on this
motion. 68. On January 29, 2025, defendant Myers began disposing of
Plaintiff’s personal belongings that remained on the family property. REC.

=== PAGE 9 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
1629-1631. 69. On February 12, 2025, Plaintiff learned that his youngest
daughter was suffering from dental pain due to Myers’ failure to obtain
dental insurance for the children. REC. 3281. 70. By March 14, (REC.
1833-1837) the judges had still not been reinstated from the first recusal,
which lad Plaintiff to reach out to Baker to request a hearing on his
unopposed summary judgment that had been on the docket since February
22, 2024, where he had to remind her to reinstate the judges back into the
case. REC. 1833-1837. 71. Given the delays, and since the case had been
brought in bad faith initially, the Plaintiff opened an original SAPCR suit in
the 233rd District Court of Tarrant County on March 18, 2025, where he
argued for dominant jurisdiction in a cover letter sent to the clerk. REC.
2260. T. Counsel Suddenly Becomes Active 72. The very next day, defendant
Carter filed an original answer filed on her behalf by Roderick Marx. REC.
2279. The motion was a boilerplate motion, and was followed by a motion to
consolidate, which was filed in the wrong court, and was also filed on
Carter’s behalf by RODERICK D. MARX. REC. 2284. 73. The Plaintiff
immediately responded by filing a motion to strike (REC. 1957) a Rule 12
motion to show authority challenging both Carter and RODERICK D MARX’s
authority (REC. 2288) and on March 24, 2025, an emergency ex-parte TRO
to prevent Myers from barring Plaintiff’s access to the home. (REC. 2302)
No responses were ever received from Carter on these motions. 74. On
March 26, 2025, an objection was filed to Carter’s consolidation motion in
the 233rd court. REC. 1881. 75. Plaintiff reached out to the coordinator from
the 233rd and went through the process to present the motion to the judge.
REC. 2338-2341. 76. On March 29, 2025, Plaintiff appeared before Associate
Judge Kate Stone, who refused to hear Plaintiff’s emergency motion despite
no response being filed, and told him to leave the courtroom. The hearing
date scheduled for April 10, 2025, as agreed by Carter and Plaintiff (REC.
2358), was actually un-set by Stone. REC. 2361. 77. The grounds for this
outright refusal was due to Carter calling in a favor from the judge without
even being present in the courtroom, to where Stone left the room, came
back, and told the Plaintiff to leave informing him that a motion to
consolidate would be filed by Carter the following week. U. Five Concurrent
Mandamus Petitions 78. Subsequently, after he was turned away from the
courtroom, Carter’s consolidation motion wasn’t filed until April 4, 2025
(REC. 2367), resulting in two mandamus petitions to try again to have the
March 14, 2024, order signed by Kaitcer vacated, and to compel Kate Stone
to hear the emergency TRO. See 25-0361, 25-0367. 79. On the same day the
mandamus was filed against Stone, District Judge Kenneth Newell sua
sponte granted Carter’s consolidation motion in both courts without a
hearing, and without addressing the emergency situation for the children or
the Plaintiff’s objections, leading to a third mandamus proceeding. REC.
2393, See also 25-0378. 80. On April 23, 2025, a notice of trial setting was
served on the parties by defendant Munford in the midst of all of these
issues. REC. 1773. 81. The same day, Plaintiff filed an objection and
requested an emergency stay. REC. 2219. No response was received to this
objection by either Munford or Carter. 82. Two days later on April 25, 2025,
Plaintiff filed his second recusal motion, and amended it on April 28, 2025,
this time only against Munford, and requested that the rules of procedure be
followed, and objected to the involvement of the court coordinator given the
prior recusal’s ambiguity and significant delays caused by her involvement.
REC. 2488 No response to this motion was ever filed from Carter. 83. Baker

=== PAGE 10 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
continued to be involved in the recusal process, this time erroneously
forwarding an order of referral from defendant Kaitcer, who was not named
in the recusal motion. REC. 2615. 84. Plaintiff immediately objected on April
29, 2025, naming two issues: 1) the coordinator was still involved, and 2) the
order of referral sent by Kaitcer was erroneous. REC. 2620. 84. Plaintiff
objected to the order of assignment of John H. Cayce (REC. 3149) which was
issued on May 7, 2025, due to the unresolves issues. REC. 2620. 85. David L.
Evans overruled this objection on May 15, 2025, leading to mandamus
petition 25-0426, a direct appeal to the Texas Supreme Court. REC. 3507.
86. On May 20, 2025, John H. Cayce summarily denied the recusal, including
the denial of a motion to recuse Kaitcer which was never filed, leading to
mandamus petition 25-0458, a second direct appeal to the Texas Supreme
Court. 87. All five petitions were denied both initially and on rehearing, and
all emergency motions to stay proceedings were dismissed. The only insights
given from the appellate courts was: “Denied, per curiam.” No response was
filed by any implicated judge or opposing counsel. V. Federal RICO Case and
the Push Towards Final Trial 88. In June of 2025, Plaintiff amended his
complaint against Daniel Kenneth Branthoover and enjoined Myers as a
defendant, which they defended pro-se. 89. Plaintiff communicated this
action with the trial court, and no further action was taken in the case until
August of 2025, when defendant Munford sua sponte set the case for final
trial on December 10, 2025. 90. Plaintiff immediately objected to this trial
setting, and moved to recuse Munford for a third time. 91. The court
coordinator continued to be involved in the process, leading to a subsequent
motion to recuse the regional presiding judge, David L. Evans. 92. Plaintiff
now prepares this suit to hold defendants accountable for their collective
actions, and to prevent their common goal from being achieved, which is to
obtain defendant Myers a final decree of divorce. 93. For the forthcoming
reasons, the conduct outlined herein constitutes conduct of an enterprise
through a pattern of racketeering activity, as several predicate acts were
committed, the enterprise shares a common purpose, and Plaintiff has
suffered direct and ongoing injury to business and property as a direct result
of the defendant’s collective predicate acts. RICO The timeline and evidence
provided demonstrate that the Myers-Branthoover group constitutes an
association-in-fact enterprise under RICO, with a common goal to deprive
the Plaintiff of his home and business through a pattern of racketeering
activity—specifically, wire fraud, Travel Act violations, and fraudulent court
filings—causing direct injury to the Plaintiff’s business and property. The
conduct, structure, and continuity among the participants, as well as the use
of interstate communications and travel, satisfy the elements of a RICO
claim in the Tenth Circuit, with the liability of other defendants depending
on their knowledge and intent. A. Summary The Myers-Branthoover
enterprise, as detailed in the factual timeline, meets the Tenth Circuit’s
requirements for a RICO claim by establishing an association-in-fact
enterprise with a defined structure, purpose, and continuity. The group’s
coordinated actions—including interstate transfer of funds, preparation and
submission of fraudulent legal documents, and ongoing manipulation of
court proceedings—constitute a pattern of racketeering activity, with
predicate acts of wire fraud and Travel Act violations that are related and
continuous. Plaintiff’s direct and ongoing injury to his business and property,
including loss of home, business operations, and client relationships, is
proximately caused by the enterprise’s acts. While Myers and Branthoover’s

=== PAGE 11 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
liability is clear, the involvement of other defendants (Munford, Kaitcer,
Carter, and Baker) may be characterized as inadvertent or willing
participation, depending on their knowledge and intent, but the core
elements of a RICO violation are satisfied by the conduct of Myers and
Branthoover as outlined in the enumerated timeline. The additional acts
committed by each defendant, as alleged, furthered the scheme of the
enterprise despite each additional defendant having actual knowledge of the
fraudulent scheme. RICO Statutory Framework The Racketeer Influenced
and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), codified at 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961–1968,
provides a civil cause of action for individuals injured in their business or
property by reason of a pattern of racketeering activity conducted through
an enterprise affecting interstate or foreign commerce. The most commonly
invoked provision, § 1962(c), prohibits any person employed by or associated
with an enterprise from conducting or participating in the conduct of such
enterprise’s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity. Section
1962(d) further prohibits conspiracies to violate any of the substantive RICO
provisions. To establish a civil RICO claim under § 1962(c), a plaintiff must
prove: i. The existence of an enterprise; ii. The enterprise’s engagement in,
or effect on, interstate or foreign commerce; iii. The defendant’s
employment by or association with the enterprise; iv. The defendant’s
participation, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of the enterprise’s affairs;
v. The defendant’s participation through a pattern of racketeering activity or
collection of unlawful debt. See 100 Mount Holly Bypass v. Axos Bank, Case
No. 2:20-CV-856-TS-CMR (D. Utah Jul 27, 2021). B. Predicate Acts and
Pattern Requirement RICO defines “racketeering activity” to include a wide
range of criminal offenses, including wire fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343) and
violations of the Travel Act (18 U.S.C. § 1952). A “pattern of racketeering
activity” requires at least two predicate acts within a ten-year period, but
the acts must be related and amount to or pose a threat of continued
criminal activity. The Supreme Court has clarified that a RICO violation
requires both an “enterprise” and a “pattern of racketeering activity,” with
the enterprise being a group of persons associated for a common purpose,
and the pattern involving a series of criminal acts (United States v. Harris,
695 F.3d 1125 (10th Cir. 2012)). The Tenth Circuit has further explained
that, to establish a pattern, it is not enough to simply show that two
predicate acts occurred within ten years; the acts must also be related and
pose a threat of continued criminal activity (U.S. v. Smith, 413 F.3d 1253
(10th Cir. 2005)). Note, however, that U.S. v. Smith has been stated as
overruled by United States v. Nissen, 555 F.Supp.3d 1174 (D. N.M. 2021) on
unrelated grounds, but its articulation of the pattern requirement remains
consistent with current law. C. Enterprise and Association-in-Fact An
“enterprise” under RICO includes any individual, partnership, corporation,
association, or group of individuals associated in fact, even if not a legal
entity. For an association-in-fact enterprise, the Tenth Circuit requires: i. A
purpose; ii. Relationships among those associated with the enterprise; iii.
Longevity sufficient to permit the associates to pursue the enterprise’s
purpose; iv. A decision-making framework or mechanism for controlling the
group; v. Functioning as a continuing unit; vi. Existence separate and apart
from the pattern of racketeering activity. See 100 Mount Holly Bypass. D.
Conspiracy Section 1962(d) makes it unlawful to conspire to violate any of
the substantive RICO provisions. A RICO conspiracy does not require the
establishment of an enterprise but requires that a defendant adopts the goal

=== PAGE 12 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
of furthering or facilitating a criminal endeavor that would satisfy the
elements of a substantive RICO offense (United States v. Martinez, 543
F.Supp.3d 1209 (D. N.M. 2021); United States v. Randall, 661 F.3d 1291
(10th Cir. 2011)). E. Injury Requirement RICO provides a private right of
action for individuals injured in their business or property through
fraudulent conduct, and there is no requirement that the conduct be
connected to organized crime in a civil setting (Plains Resources, Inc. v.
Gable, 782 F.2d 883 (10th Cir. 1986)). ANALYSIS F. Existence of an
Association-in-Fact Enterprise The timeline establishes that Myers and
Branthoover formed an association-in-fact enterprise beginning in December
2023 (¶¶ 1–7, 93). Their collaboration was structured, with Myers as the
petitioner in the divorce and Branthoover as the planner, drafter, and
facilitator of fraudulent documents and financial transactions. The group
had a clear purpose: to divest the Plaintiff of his home and business through
fraudulent legal filings and manipulation of court processes (¶¶ 1–7, 93).
The enterprise’s structure is evidenced by: i. The initial planning and
agreement to meet in Yukon, Oklahoma, to draft fraudulent documents (¶¶
1–3); ii. The use of interstate communications and travel to further the
scheme (¶¶ 2–3); iii. Ongoing coordination and adaptation to changing
circumstances, including the preparation and submission of false affidavits
and pleadings, and manipulation of court proceedings (¶¶ 5–7, 34, 93). This
satisfies the Tenth Circuit’s requirements for an association-in-fact
enterprise, which does not require a formal legal entity but does require a
common purpose, relationships, and sufficient longevity to pursue the
enterprise’s goals. G. Structure, Purpose, Relationships, and Continuity The
Myers-Branthoover group meets the requirements for an association-in-fact
enterprise: i. Purpose: The shared goal was to deprive the Plaintiff of his
home, business, and property interests through fraudulent means (¶¶ 1–7,
93). ii. Relationships: Myers and Branthoover maintained ongoing
communications, coordinated actions, and divided roles in the scheme (¶¶ 1–
7, 93). iii. Longevity and Continuity: The enterprise operated over a
substantial period, from at least December 2023 through present day 2025,
with multiple related acts and ongoing adaptation to changing
circumstances (¶¶ 1–93). iv. Decision-Making Framework: The group
planned, agreed on steps, and executed those steps in a coordinated manner
(¶¶ 1–7, 93). v. Existence Separate from Predicate Acts: The enterprise was
formed for the purpose of achieving a specific goal and engaged in multiple
acts over time to accomplish that goal. H. Predicate Acts: Wire Fraud, Travel
Act Violations, and Fraudulent Filings The timeline identifies multiple
predicate acts that qualify as racketeering activity under RICO: i. Wire
Fraud: Myers transferred $1,576 in marital funds to Branthoover’s PayPal
account during interstate travel, and these funds were used to purchase a
phone for use in the fraudulent scheme (¶¶ 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 34). The use of
electronic communications (text messages, emails) to plan and execute the
scheme further supports the wire fraud allegation (¶¶ 1–7, 34). ii. Travel Act
Violations: Myers traveled from Texas to Oklahoma to meet with
Branthoover, where they planned and prepared fraudulent legal documents,
which were then transported back to Texas and submitted to the court (¶¶ 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, 7). iii. Fraudulent Filings: The preparation and submission of false
affidavits and pleadings to the court, containing material misrepresentations
about financial status, family violence, and property ownership, constitute
further predicate acts (¶¶ 5, 6, 7, 34). At least two related predicate acts

=== PAGE 13 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
within ten years are required (U.S. v. Smith, 413 F.3d 1253 (10th Cir. 2005)),
and the timeline shows multiple, related predicate acts over a substantial
period (¶¶ 1–93). I. Pattern of Racketeering Activity: Relatedness and
Continuity The predicate acts were not isolated incidents but part of an
ongoing scheme. The acts were related in that they all aimed to deprive the
Plaintiff of his property and business, and they posed a threat of continued
criminal activity, as the enterprise continued to operate and adapt its tactics
over time (¶¶ 1–93). The timeline shows that the enterprise’s activities
extended over a substantial period, with multiple acts occurring over
months and involving ongoing coordination and adaptation to changing
circumstances. J. Injury to Business or Property Plaintiff suffered direct and
ongoing injury to his business and property as a result of the enterprise’s
actions. He was deprived of his home and business operations, lost access to
marital funds, and was unable to provide services to clients, resulting in
financial harm (¶¶ 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 37). These injuries are precisely the type
of harm RICO is designed to redress. Plains Resources, Inc. v. Gable, 782 F.
2d 883 (10th Cir. 1986)). K. Participation of Other Defendants: Inadvertent
or Willing The timeline raises the question of whether Munford, Kaitcer,
Carter, and Baker were victims of the initial scheme or willing participants
in the expanded enterprise. The evidence suggests that, at a minimum,
Myers and Branthoover were the core members of the enterprise, with
others potentially becoming involved through their actions in the legal
proceedings (¶¶ 14–93). i. Inadvertent Participation: Some defendants may
have participated inadvertently, such as by issuing orders or facilitating
court processes without knowledge of the underlying scheme (¶¶ 14–93). ii.
Willing Participation: Others may have become willing participants if they
knowingly furthered the enterprise’s objectives or ignored clear evidence of
fraud and misrepresentation (¶¶ 14–93). RICO does not impose liability for
inadvertent or unwitting participation; there must be knowing and willful
involvement in the conduct of the enterprise’s affairs. For the forthcoming
reasons, Plaintiff alleges that the Defendants are willing participants in the
scheme. VICTIM OR PARTICIPANT RICO liability extends to those who
knowingly participate in the conduct of the enterprise’s affairs, even if they
were not original members (RICO: A Primer (2022-01-31)). The timeline
raises the question of whether Munford, Kaitcer, Carter, and Baker were
victims of the initial scheme or willing participants in the expanded
enterprise. The evidence suggests that, at a minimum, Myers and
Branthoover were the core members of the enterprise, with others becoming
involved through their actions in the legal proceedings (¶¶ 14–93). The
timeline demonstrates that Carter, Kaitcer, and Myers engaged in extortion
by leveraging the threat of adverse legal action, fraudulent court orders, and
the manipulation of judicial process to coerce Plaintiff into relinquishing
property and business interests, satisfying the elements of extortion as a
predicate act under RICO and the Travel Act. Munford and Baker, for their
part, committed wire fraud by intentionally sending altered or incomplete
court documents via interstate email, with the intent to mislead, obstruct
relief, and further the enterprise’s objective of finalizing the divorce and
depriving Plaintiff of his property, thus meeting the requirements for wire
fraud as a RICO predicate act. These acts, as detailed in the timeline, are
not isolated but part of a coordinated pattern of racketeering activity within
an association-in-fact enterprise, as required by RICO in the Tenth Circuit.
The conduct of each defendant is tied to specific predicate acts—extortion

=== PAGE 14 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
for Carter, Kaitcer, and Myers (notably at timeline events 33–37), and wire
fraud for Munford and Baker (notably at events 54–59, 83)—demonstrating
knowing and willful participation in the enterprise’s broader scheme to
deprive Plaintiff of his home and business through fraudulent and coercive
means. A. Extortion and Wire Fraud The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961–1968, provides a civil cause of
action for injury to business or property caused by a pattern of racketeering
activity conducted through an enterprise affecting interstate commerce.
Predicate acts under RICO include extortion (as defined by the Hobbs Act
and the Travel Act) and wire fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343), among others.
Extortion is defined as obtaining property from another, with his consent,
induced by wrongful use of actual or threatened force, violence, or fear, or
under color of official right. The Travel Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1952, includes
extortion as an “unlawful activity” and does not require it to be part of a
business enterprise (U.S. v. Welch, 327 F.3d 1081 (10th Cir. 2003)). The
Tenth Circuit recognizes that extortion under the Travel Act can be
established by showing threats or coercion to obtain something of value,
including property or legal rights, in violation of state or federal law. Wire
fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343 requires (1) a scheme to defraud or obtain
property by false or fraudulent pretenses, (2) intent to defraud, and (3) use
of interstate wire communications to execute the scheme (Clinton v. Sec.
Benefit Life Ins. Co., 63 F.4th 1264 (10th Cir. 2023); United States v.
Holloway, 826 F.3d 1237 (10th Cir. 2016)). The Tenth Circuit requires that
the deprivation of property be a central object of the scheme, and that the
use of wires (including email) be knowing and in furtherance of the
fraudulent scheme (United States v. Tao, 629 F.Supp.3d 1083). B. Extortion
by Carter, Kaitcer, and Myers Extortion, as a RICO predicate act, is defined
broadly under federal law and the Travel Act. It includes obtaining property
or rights through threats, coercion, or misuse of official process (U.S. v.
Welch, 327 F.3d 1081 (10th Cir. 2003)). The Tenth Circuit does not require
extortion to be part of a business enterprise for Travel Act purposes; a single
act suffices if it has the requisite interstate nexus. The timeline shows the
following: i. Event 33–34: Carter, with Myers, prepared and presented
“Temporary Orders” that misrepresented facts (e.g., that Plaintiff agreed to
terms he did not, that a hearing occurred when it did not, and that the
orders were in the best interests of the children). These orders altered the
dates of access to the home to shield Myers from liability for locking Plaintiff
out, and were presented to Plaintiff in a context where he was under threat
of losing his home and business. iii. Event 36: Kaitcer, knowing the orders
were disputed and that no response had been filed, signed an associate
judge’s report pre-drafted by Carter, summarily denying Plaintiff’s
emergency motion and ordering Plaintiff to sign the disputed document,
despite his objections and lack of consent. iv. Event 35: Plaintiff refused to
sign the orders for multiple reasons, including their fraudulent content and
the lack of due process, but the orders were rendered into effect without his
signature. These acts collectively demonstrate the use of legal process and
the threat of adverse judicial action to coerce Plaintiff into surrendering his
property and business interests. The manipulation of court orders, the
misrepresentation of facts, and the pressure to sign under threat of losing
his home constitute extortion under the Travel Act and RICO (U.S. v. Welch,
327 F.3d 1081 (10th Cir. 2003). Myers’s role is clear: she was the beneficiary
and instigator of the fraudulent filings and the manipulation of court

=== PAGE 15 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
process, using the threat of legal action and the actual deprivation of
Plaintiff’s property to achieve her goal. Carter and Kaitcer acted in concert
with Myers, knowingly facilitating the extortion by preparing, presenting,
and enforcing fraudulent orders, and by using the authority of the court to
coerce Plaintiff. The fact that Plaintiff was ordered to sign a document he
objected to, under threat of continued deprivation of his home and business,
is classic extortion by color of official right. All three defendants knew that
Plaintiff did not agree to the order, as he had just fired his attorney to
challenge any basis for an agreement. This implies that despite the motion
being served on all defendants, they chose to ignore the allegations of a
fraudulent scheme and further the affairs of the enterprise. These actions
meet the requirements for extortion as a RICO predicate act: they involved
the wrongful use of threats and official process to obtain property (the home
and business) from Plaintiff, with his consent induced by fear of further loss
or legal harm. The acts were not isolated but part of a coordinated scheme
to achieve the enterprise’s goal of finalizing the divorce and divesting
Plaintiff of his property B. Wire Fraud by Munford and Baker Wire fraud
under 18 U.S.C. § 1343 requires a scheme to defraud, intent to defraud, and
use of interstate wire communications to execute the scheme (Clinton v. Sec.
Benefit Life Ins. Co., 63 F.4th 1264 (10th Cir. 2023); United States v.
Holloway, 826 F.3d 1237 (10th Cir. 2016)). The Tenth Circuit recognizes that
sending altered or incomplete court documents via email, with the intent to
mislead or deprive someone of property or rights, can constitute wire fraud
if the deprivation of property is a central object of the scheme (United
States v. Tao, 629 F.Supp.3d 1083). The timeline shows the following: i.
Event 54: Munford signed and forwarded a “Joint Motion to Recuse”
attached to his order of referral, but the document was missing critical
exhibits and affidavits necessary for Plaintiff’s relief. ii. Event 55: Baker sent
a copy of this incomplete filing via email, representing it as the full
document. iii. Event 56–57: When Plaintiff pointed out the discrepancies,
Baker provided inconsistent explanations, first claiming the full document
was e-filed, then later stating it was split into three parts due to size. iv.
Event 58: Munford signed and filed an “Amended Order of Referral” with the
full motion attached, but with hyperlinks and bookmarks removed, further
impairing the document’s integrity. v. Event 59, 83: Baker continued to
forward altered or incomplete orders and referrals, even when procedural
irregularities were raised. These acts involved the knowing use of interstate
email to transmit altered or incomplete court documents, with the intent to
prevent Plaintiff from obtaining relief and to further the enterprise’s goal of
finalizing the divorce and depriving Plaintiff of his property. The use of email
to transmit these documents satisfies the interstate wire requirement, and
the intent to defraud is evidenced by the deliberate alteration and
misrepresentation of the filings. The conduct of Munford and Baker meets
the elements of wire fraud: (1) a scheme to defraud Plaintiff of property and
rights, (2) intent to defraud by preventing relief and misleading the court
and Plaintiff, and (3) use of interstate wire communications (email) to
execute the scheme (Clinton v. Sec. Benefit Life Ins. Co., 63 F.4th 1264 (10th
Cir. 2023)). The deprivation of property (Plaintiff’s home and business) was
a central object of the scheme, not a minor part. RELATIONSHIP AND
CONTINUITY All these acts—extortion by Carter, Kaitcer, and Myers, and
wire fraud by Munford and Baker—were committed in furtherance of the
Myers-Branthoover enterprise’s overarching objective: to finalize the

=== PAGE 16 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
divorce and divest Plaintiff of his home and business. The acts were
coordinated, continuous, and related, satisfying the RICO pattern
requirement. The timeline shows that each defendant’s conduct was not an
isolated error or routine administrative act, but part of a deliberate scheme
to use the legal process, threats, and fraudulent communications to achieve
the enterprise’s unlawful goals. DAMAGES The harm inflicted upon Plaintiff
is staggering. He has lost the home in which he lived for nearly a third of his
life, the companionship of his spouse, and the society of his children. His
income has collapsed. For two years he has been consigned to a futile
appellate gauntlet, even as Defendants Munford, Kaitcer, Baker, and Carter
have repeatedly exceeded the bounds of their lawful authority in furtherance
of a broader scheme. What began as a concerted effort by Myers and
Branthoover to dispossess Plaintiff of his residence and property
metastasized into a calculated plan to procure a final decree of divorce once
the initial objective had been achieved. The objective was plain: by
engineering a final decree, Defendants would not only hobble Plaintiff’s
ability to bring this suit but also invite invocation of the Rooker–Feldman
doctrine and related abstention principles to preclude federal jurisdiction.
Now, after two years of unremitting effort, Plaintiff seeks the only
meaningful remedy remaining: federal redress to halt the ongoing abuses of
authority, to unwind tainted actions, and to compensate him fully for the
catastrophic losses Defendants have wrought. Take each piece in the TABLE
OF CONTENTS, research the topic, and tie it to the factual timeline, filling
out each element of the RICO complaint and tie each element to the factual
allegations by enumerated paragraph number. What are the legal standards
for pleading and proving damages in a civil RICO action in the Fifth Circuit,
including compensatory, treble, punitive, and restitution damages?
Answer (Fifth Circuit)
Short response
To plead and prove damages in a civil RICO action in the Fifth Circuit, a
plaintiff must show a concrete financial loss to business or property
proximately caused by the RICO violation, with compensatory damages
trebled by statute, while punitive damages are generally unavailable and
restitution is limited to actual loss directly resulting from the predicate acts.
The standards require specificity and competent proof of loss, and only
injuries to business or property—not personal injuries or speculative losses
—are compensable.
Summary
In the Fifth Circuit, civil RICO plaintiffs must allege and prove that they
suffered a direct, concrete financial loss to their business or property as a
result of the defendant’s racketeering activity, and that this loss was both
factually and proximately caused by the RICO violation. Compensatory
damages are calculated based on the actual harm caused by the predicate
acts, and, if liability is established, these damages are automatically trebled
under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c); punitive damages are not available because

=== PAGE 17 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
treble damages serve a punitive function, and restitution is limited to the
amount of actual loss proven.
The courts require that damages be pleaded with specificity and supported
by competent evidence, excluding speculative, intangible, or personal injury-
based claims. The injury must be ascertainable and directly linked to the
RICO violation, and the plaintiff bears the burden of showing that the
damages flow from the predicate acts constituting the pattern of
racketeering activity. Attorney’s fees and costs are also recoverable for
prevailing plaintiffs, but double recovery for the same loss is barred by the
one-satisfaction rule.
Background and Relevant Law
Legislative Framework
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), codified at
18 U.S.C. §§ 1961–1968, provides a private right of action for “[a]ny person
injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962,”
and mandates that such a plaintiff “shall recover threefold the damages he
sustains and the cost of the suit, including a reasonable attorney’s fee” (D&T
Partners L.L.C. v. Baymark Partners Mgmt., L.L.C., 98 F.4th 198; 18 U.S.C. §
1964(c)). The statute does not define “damages,” but the Supreme Court and
Fifth Circuit have interpreted this to mean actual, compensatory damages to
business or property, not personal injuries or speculative losses (Hughes v.
Tobacco Institute, Inc., 278 F.3d 417).
Case Law
The Fifth Circuit has consistently held that to have standing and to recover
under civil RICO, a plaintiff must show (1) injury to business or property, and
(2) that the injury was caused “by reason of” the RICO violation, meaning
both but-for and proximate causation (Price v. Pinnacle Brands, Inc., 138 F.
3d 602; Allstate Ins. Co. v. Plambeck, 802 F.3d 665; Jackson v. Nat'l Ass'n for
the Advancement of Colored People, No. 12-20399). The injury must be a
concrete financial loss, not a mere expectancy or intangible property
interest (Gil Ramirez Grp., L.L.C. v. Hous. Indep. Sch. Dist., 786 F.3d 400; 
Patterson v. Mobil Oil Corp., 335 F.3d 476). Speculative damages or those
not directly resulting from the predicate acts are not compensable (Taxable
Mun. Bond Securities Litigation, In re, 51 F.3d 518).
The Supreme Court recently expanded the scope of RICO injuries to allow
treble damages for business or property loss even if the loss resulted from a
personal injury, but the loss itself must still be to business or property
(Supreme Court Expands The Scope Of Injuries Under RICO).
Secondary Materials
Secondary authorities reinforce that damages must be proven with
competent evidence and must be directly attributable to the predicate acts
forming the pattern of racketeering activity (Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy).

=== PAGE 18 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Treble damages are mandatory upon proof of liability, and future damages
may be recoverable if they are reasonably certain to occur as a result of the
RICO violation. The one-satisfaction rule prevents double recovery for the
same loss (Creel v. Dr. Says, LLC).
Analysis
Compensatory Damages
Pleading and Proof Requirements
To recover compensatory damages in a civil RICO action, the plaintiff must
allege and prove a concrete, non-speculative financial loss to business or
property, directly caused by the defendant’s racketeering activity (Creel v.
Dr. Says, LLC, Civil Action 4:18-CV-00615 (E.D. Tex. Mar 31, 2022); Price v.
Pinnacle Brands, Inc., 138 F.3d 602). The loss must be ascertainable and
supported by competent evidence, not mere speculation or conjecture
(Taxable Mun. Bond Securities Litigation, In re, 51 F.3d 518). The Fifth
Circuit has repeatedly emphasized that injury to mere expectancy interests
or intangible property is insufficient (Gil Ramirez Grp., L.L.C. v. Hous. Indep.
Sch. Dist., 786 F.3d 400).
Application to Timeline
In the provided factual timeline, the plaintiff alleges loss of his home,
business operations, and client relationships, as well as deprivation of
marital funds and business income (see, e.g., ¶¶ 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 37). To
satisfy the Fifth Circuit’s standard, the plaintiff must quantify these losses
with specificity—such as lost profits, lost business value, or out-of-pocket
expenses—and tie each loss directly to the predicate acts (e.g., wire fraud,
extortion, fraudulent court filings) that constitute the RICO violation
(National Enterprises, Inc. v. Mellon Financial Services Corp. No. 7, 847 F.2d
251).
Causation
The plaintiff must show both but-for and proximate causation: that the injury
would not have occurred but for the RICO violation, and that the violation
was the direct cause of the injury (Allstate Ins. Co. v. Plambeck, 802 F.3d
665; Summit Properties v. Hoechst Celanese Corp., 214 F.3d 556, overruled
on other grounds by St. Germain v. Howard, 556 F.3d 261). For example, if
the loss of business clients resulted directly from being locked out of the
home and unable to provide services (as alleged in ¶ 37), and this was a
foreseeable result of the racketeering acts, compensatory damages may be
awarded.
Exclusion of Personal Injuries
Damages for personal injuries, emotional distress, or loss of consortium are
not recoverable under RICO (Hughes v. Tobacco Institute, Inc., 278 F.3d
417). Even pecuniary consequences of personal injuries are excluded unless

=== PAGE 19 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
they result in a direct loss to business or property (Creel v. Dr. Says, LLC,
Civil Action 4:18-CV-00615 (E.D. Tex. Mar 31, 2022)).
Treble Damages
Statutory Mandate
Upon proof of liability and actual damages, the court must award treble
damages—three times the amount of actual damages proven—under 18
U.S.C. § 1964(c) (D&T Partners L.L.C. v. Baymark Partners Mgmt., L.L.C., 98
F.4th 198; Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy). This is not discretionary; the
statute requires trebling of compensatory damages.
Purpose and Effect
Treble damages serve both compensatory and punitive functions, deterring
racketeering activity and encouraging private enforcement (Allstate Ins. Co.
v. Plambeck, 802 F.3d 665). The Fifth Circuit has held that the availability of
treble damages may offset the need for prejudgment interest, as the treble
award is considered sufficient to compensate for the loss of use of money
(Allstate Ins. Co. v. Plambeck, 802 F.3d 665).
Recent Expansion
The Supreme Court’s recent decision in Medical Marijuana, Inc. v. Horn
clarifies that treble damages are available for business or property loss even
if the loss is derived from a personal injury, so long as the loss itself is to
business or property (Supreme Court Expands The Scope Of Injuries Under
RICO).
Punitive Damages
General Unavailability
Punitive damages are generally not available in civil RICO actions because
the treble damages provision is considered punitive in nature (Allstate Ins.
Co. v. Plambeck, 802 F.3d 665). The Fifth Circuit has not recognized a right
to additional punitive damages beyond the statutory treble damages, and
courts have denied such claims on the basis that treble damages fulfill the
punitive and deterrent purposes of the statute.
Abrogated Authority
While some older Fifth Circuit cases discuss punitive damages in the context
of malicious or wanton conduct (Jackson v. Johns-Manville Sales Corp., 781
F.2d 394), this authority has been abrogated by later cases (Morgan v. Plano
Indep. Sch. Dist., 724 F.3d 579), and is not controlling in the RICO context.
Restitution Damages
Restitution as Actual Loss

=== PAGE 20 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Restitution in civil RICO is limited to the amount of actual loss suffered by
the plaintiff as a direct result of the predicate acts (Creel v. Dr. Says, LLC).
The plaintiff may recover the value of property or funds wrongfully obtained
or lost due to the racketeering activity, but must provide competent proof of
the amount and direct causation (Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy).
No Double Recovery
The one-satisfaction rule applies, preventing double recovery for the same
loss. If the plaintiff receives restitution or settlement from one defendant,
the total recovery is offset to ensure that the plaintiff is not compensated
more than once for the same injury (Creel v. Dr. Says, LLC).
Attorney’s Fees and Costs
Prevailing plaintiffs are entitled to recover reasonable attorney’s fees and
costs in addition to treble damages (D&T Partners L.L.C. v. Baymark
Partners Mgmt., L.L.C., 98 F.4th 198; PAYORS, PLAYERS, AND PROXIMATE
CAUSE).
Pleading Standards
Particularity and Competent Proof
Civil RICO claims must be pleaded with particularity, especially where fraud
is alleged as a predicate act (Peel v. cPaperless LLC, 4:23-CV-02417).
Plaintiffs must set out a reasonable basis for recovery by competent proof,
not mere speculation (Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy). The complaint must
specify the amount of damages, the nature of the loss, and the causal
connection to the predicate acts.
Application to Timeline
In the context of the provided timeline, the plaintiff must tie each claimed
loss—such as lost business income, value of the home, or funds transferred—
to specific predicate acts (e.g., wire fraud, extortion) and provide evidence
(such as bank statements, client affidavits, or business records) to support
the amount claimed. For example, the $1,576 transferred to Branthoover’s
PayPal account (¶ 3) is a concrete, quantifiable loss directly linked to the
alleged wire fraud.
Defenses and Limitations
Speculative or Indirect Damages
Damages that are speculative, based on lost opportunities, or not directly
resulting from the predicate acts are not recoverable (Taxable Mun. Bond
Securities Litigation, In re, 51 F.3d 518). For example, if the plaintiff claims
damages for future lost profits, these must be established with reasonable
certainty and directly tied to the RICO violation (Civil Rico: A Tool of
Advocacy).

=== PAGE 21 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Personal Injury Exclusion
Claims for emotional distress, pain and suffering, or other personal injuries
are not compensable under RICO, even if they have pecuniary consequences
(Hughes v. Tobacco Institute, Inc., 278 F.3d 417).
One-Satisfaction Rule
If the plaintiff settles with one defendant or receives partial payment, the
total recovery is offset to prevent double recovery for the same loss (Creel v.
Dr. Says, LLC).
Exceptions and Caveats
The Supreme Court’s recent expansion of RICO injury to include
business or property loss derived from personal injury broadens the
scope of compensable damages, but the loss must still be to business or
property, not the personal injury itself (Supreme Court Expands The
Scope Of Injuries Under RICO).
The Fifth Circuit requires strict adherence to the requirement of
concrete, non-speculative financial loss; failure to plead or prove such
loss will result in dismissal (Peel v. cPaperless LLC, 4:23-CV-02417).
Punitive damages beyond treble damages are not available, and any
authority to the contrary has been abrogated or is not controlling in the
RICO context (Jackson v. Johns-Manville Sales Corp., 781 F.2d 394,
abrogated by Morgan v. Plano Indep. Sch. Dist., 724 F.3d 579).
Conclusion
In the Fifth Circuit, a civil RICO plaintiff must plead and prove a concrete,
ascertainable financial loss to business or property, directly and proximately
caused by the defendant’s racketeering activity. Compensatory damages
proven are automatically trebled by statute, punitive damages are not
available, and restitution is limited to actual loss; all damages must be
supported by competent evidence and directly tied to the predicate acts. The
plaintiff must avoid speculative or personal injury-based claims, and the
total recovery is subject to the one-satisfaction rule to prevent double
recovery. The standards are exacting, but when met, RICO provides a
powerful remedy for victims of racketeering activity.

entitled to a verdict for actual or compensatory damages, against one or
more of the defendants herein, and further find that the act or omission of
that particular defendant or defendants against whom you do find, which
proximately caused actual injury or damages to the plaintiff was maliciously
or wantonly done by that particular defendant or defendants, then in that
event you may, if in the exercise of your discretion you unanimously choose
to do so, add to the award of actual damages such amount as you shall
unanimously agree to be proper, as punitive and exemplary damages against
any one or more of the defendants against whom who have found liability
and actual damages in favor of the plaintiff, if any.
Summary
The passage provides insight into the standards for awarding punitive
damages in the Fifth Circuit. It specifies that punitive damages can be
awarded if the jury finds, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the
defendant's conduct was malicious or wanton. This is relevant to civil RICO
actions where punitive damages may be sought in addition to compensatory
damages.
Price v. Pinnacle Brands, Inc., 138 F.3d 602 (5th Cir. 1998)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
RICO provides a private civil action to recover treble damages for injury
suffered as a result of a violation of its substantive provisions. To state a civil
RICO claim under § 1962, a plaintiff must allege: (1) the conduct (2) of an
enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity. As a preliminary
matter, however, a plaintiff must establish that he has standing to sue. 'The
standing provision of civil RICO provides that '[a]ny person injured in his
business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962 of this chapter
may sue therefor ... and shall recover threefold the damages he sustains.'
Thus, a RICO plaintiff must satisfy two elements--injury and causation.
Summary
Requirements for a civil RICO claim, emphasizing the need for a plaintiff to
demonstrate both injury and causation to have standing. It also highlights
that RICO allows for the recovery of treble damages, which are three times
the actual damages sustained. This is a critical aspect of RICO's civil remedy
provisions, as it provides a strong incentive for plaintiffs to pursue claims.
The passage does not specifically address punitive or restitution damages,
but it does clarify the compensatory and treble damages aspect.

U.S. District Court — Western District of Texas
Extract
In addition, a civil RICO plaintiff must be 'injured in his business or property
by reason of a violation of section 1962.' 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c). In other words,
standing to sue under § 1962 requires injury and causation. See Price, 138 F.
3d at 606. 'Injury to mere expectancy interests or to an ‘intangible property
interest’ is not sufficient to confer RICO standing.' Id. at 607. Indeed, the
RICO claimant must show a 'conclusive financial loss.' Gil Ramirez Group,
L.L.C. v. Houston Indep. Sch. Dist., 786 F.3d 400, 408 (5th Cir. 2015). The
Court agrees with Plaintiff that Defendants fail to allege a sufficiently
concrete injury and thus do not have standing to sue under RICO.
Summary
Requirement for a civil RICO plaintiff to demonstrate a concrete and
conclusive financial loss to establish standing. It emphasizes that speculative
or intangible injuries are insufficient. This aligns with the Fifth Circuit's
requirement for a definite and calculable injury, as seen in Gil Ramirez
Group, L.L.C. v. Houston Indep. Sch. Dist. The passage does not directly
address treble, punitive, or restitution damages but focuses on the necessity
of proving a concrete injury for standing.

In addition, a RICO plaintiff must have standing to sue pursuant to 18 U.S.C.
§ 1964(c). '[T]he plaintiff only has standing if, and can only recover to the

standing requirement, found in § 1964(c), provides that only persons who
have been injured 'by reason of' the commission of predicate acts have
standing to bring suit. Sedima, 473 U.S. at 496, 105 S.Ct. 3275. In the Fifth
Circuit, a person will be considered injured 'by reason of' a RICO violation if
the predicate acts constitute (1) factual (but for) causation and (2) legal
(proximate) causation of the alleged injury.
Summary
Standing requirement for a civil RICO action, which is crucial for pleading
and proving damages. It specifies that a plaintiff must demonstrate injury to
business or property directly caused by the RICO violation, involving both
factual and legal causation. This is foundational for claiming any damages,
including compensatory, treble, punitive, and restitution damages, as it
establishes the basis for the plaintiff's right to recover.

1990)
U.S. District Court — Eastern District of Louisiana
Extract
Newport has repeatedly refused to specify its damages throughout this
litigation. It is clear that it may recover only those damages factually and
legally caused by the predicate acts of mail and wire fraud in this RICO
claim, not those otherwise owing by virtue of an alleged breach of contract.
Here, Newport seeks recovery of damages, not of those monies shown to
have been expended as the result of the predicate acts, but of lump sum
amounts based on the successful completion of the project, itemized as 'out
of pocket loss, lost public monies and lost profits.'
Summary
In a civil RICO action, damages must be directly and factually caused by the
predicate acts of racketeering, such as mail and wire fraud. It emphasizes
that damages cannot be speculative or based on unrelated breaches of
contract. The damages must be specific and directly linked to the wrongful
acts alleged under RICO.

To state a civil RICO claim under any subsection in 18 U.S.C. § 1962, 'there
must be: (1) a person who engages in (2) a pattern of racketeering activity
(3) connected to the acquisition, establishment, conduct, or control of an
enterprise.' Brown v. Protective Life Ins. Co., 353 F.3d 405, 407 (5th Cir.
2003)(quotation marks and citation omitted). A plaintiff must establish
standing to bring a civil RICO claim. Price v. Pinnacle Brands, Inc., 138 F.3d
602, 606 (5th Cir. 1998). 'Any person injured in his business or property by
reason of a violation of section 1962' may sue pursuant to the civil cause of
action created by RICO. 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c). Thus, a plaintiff must satisfy
two elements to establish RICO standing: injury and causation. Price, 138 F.

intangible property interest is not sufficient to confer RICO standing,' Price,
138 F.3d at 607 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Addressing
the causation requirement, a RICO predicate offense must 'not only [be] a
'but for' cause of [plaintiff's] injury, but [it must be] the proximate cause as
well.' Holmes v. Sec. Investor Prot. Corp., 503 U.S. 258, 268 (1992). In
assessing proximate cause, 'the central question [we] must ask is whether
the alleged violation led directly to the plaintiff's injuries.' Anza v. Ideal Steel
Supply Corp., 547 U.S. 451, 461 (2006).
Summary
Requirements for establishing a civil RICO claim, focusing on the need for a
plaintiff to demonstrate both injury and causation. It specifies that the injury
must be to business or property and that the causation must be both a "but
for" and proximate cause of the injury. This is essential for understanding
the legal standards for pleading damages in a civil RICO action.
Euristhe v. Beckmann
U.S. District Court — Northern District of Texas
Extract
RICO provides civil liability relief for activities that violate 18 U.S.C. § 1962
and harm the plaintiff. To bring an action under RICO, a plaintiff must allege
“(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity.” Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., Inc., 473 U.S. 479, 496 (1985); see
also Crowe v. Henry, 43 F.3d 198, 204 (5th Cir. 1995). The threshold
requirement for stating a civil cause of action under RICO is that that the
plaintiff must be “ ‘injured in his business or property by reason of a
violation' of the [RICO]'s substantive restrictions.” Anza v. Ideal Steel Supply
Corp., 547 U.S. 451, 453 (2006) (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c)); see also
Hughes v. Tobacco Inst., Inc., 278 F.3d 417, 422 (5th Cir. 2001). Thus, “the
plaintiff only has standing if, and can only recover to the extent that, he has
been injured in his business or property by the conduct constituting the
[RICO] violation.” Anza, 547 U.S. 451 at 453. Pecuniary consequences are
not compensable claims under RICO.
Summary
Requirements for a civil RICO action, emphasizing that a plaintiff must
demonstrate injury to business or property due to a RICO violation. It
specifies that pecuniary consequences alone are not compensable under
RICO, indicating that the injury must be more direct and tangible. This
aligns with the Fifth Circuit's standards for proving damages in a civil RICO
action.

An individual has a civil RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c), and a right to
recover treble damages and an attorney's fee, ‘[i]f the defendant engages in
a pattern of racketeering activity in a manner forbidden by [§ 1962], and the
racketeering activities injure the plaintiff in his business or property.' The
injury must be ‘by reason of,' or caused by, a violation of § 1962. Thus, §
1964(c) imposes two requirements on the plaintiff's right to recover, namely,
damage to business or property and causation.
Summary
Requirements for a civil RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c), which
include proving a violation of § 1962, injury to business or property, and
causation. It specifies that a plaintiff can recover treble damages and
attorney's fees if these conditions are met. The injury must be directly
caused by the RICO violation, emphasizing the need for a direct relationship
between the predicate acts and the injury.

U.S. District Court — Eastern District of Texas
Extract
"Congress enacted RICO primarily “to combat organized crime.” United
States v. Uni Oil, Inc., 646 F.2d 946, 953 (5th Cir. May 1981); see Sedima,
S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479, 481-83, 497-99 (1985). Nonetheless, the
statute “imposes criminal and civil liability upon those who engage in
certain ‘prohibited activities.'” H.J. Inc. v. Nw. Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229,
232 (1989). Specifically, a RICO plaintiff may bring “a private civil action to
recover treble damages for injury ‘by reason of a violation of' [RICO's]
substantive provisions.'” Sedima, 473 U.S. at 481 (quoting 18 U.S.C. §
1964(c)). ... 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c). In construing § 1964(c), the Supreme Court
has noted that “the plaintiff only has standing if, and can only recover to the
extent that, he has been injured in his business or property by the conduct
constituting the violation”-that is, the predicate act. Sedima, S.P.R.L. v.
Imrex Co., Inc., 473 U.S. 479, 496 (1985). Despite the acknowledgement that
“RICO is to ‘be liberally construed to effectuate its remedial purposes,'” Id.
at 498 (quoting Pub.L. 91-452, § 904(a), 84 Stat. 947), damages for the
commission of predicate acts must be premised upon a finding that a
plaintiff's business or property was harmed. See Id. at 500. Simply, a
plaintiff must demonstrate RICO injury through a “concrete financial loss.”
Price, 138 F.3d at 606; see United States v. Hager, 879 F.3d 550, 554 (5th
Cir. 2018). “[W]hether a given party has suffered a RICO injury is a fact-
heavy question.” Nat'l Enters. v. Mellon Fin. Servs. Corp. No. 7, 847 F.2d

(citing Hamman v. United States, 267 F.Supp. 420, 432 (D. Mont. 1967)). In
fact, even “resulting pecuniary consequences” of personal injuries are
insufficient to establish a “business or property” injury under § 1964(c). ...
To sustain the RICO damages award, the jury must have also rationally
found that Defendants' racketeering activities proximately caused Plaintiffs'
business and property injuries. Defendants argue that “the evidence is
legally [in]sufficient to establish that the damages were directly and
proximately caused by an alleged RICO violation,” which § 1964(c) requires
(Dkt. #881 at p. 29). Defendants contend that any injuries resulted from
“other independent causes” and that “the damages were too speculative for
the jury to reasonably determine what portion, if any, was the direct result of
an alleged RICO violation” (Dkt. #881 at p. 29). Plaintiffs respond that they
do not have to “offer evidence which positively exclude[s] every other
possible cause of the” injury (Dkt. #887 at p. 21) (internal citations
omitted). ... (Dkt. #856 at p. 19). According to the verdict, the jury, having
been charged with the foregoing law, found that “[t]he amount of damages
to Plaintiffs' business or property” was $300, 000 and was “specifically and
proximately caused by and attributable to Defendants' violation of
RICO” (Dkt. #850 at p. 6). Given the evidence Plaintiffs offered and the
jury's explicit instructions and findings, the Court finds “the state of proof is
such that reasonable and impartial minds could reach the conclusion the
jury expressed in its verdict” regarding RICO causation and resulting
damages. Am. Home Assurance Co. v. United Space All., 378 F.3d 482, 487
(5th Cir. 2004). ... In re Burzynski, 989 F.2d 733, 741 (5th Cir. 1993). “Thus,
RICO claims under all four subsections necessitate: ‘1) a person who
engages in 2) a pattern of racketeering activity, 3) connected to the
acquisition, establishment, conduct, or control of an enterprise.'” Id. at
741-72 (quoting Delta Truck & Tractor, Inc. v. J.I. Case Co., 855 F.2d 241,
242 (5th Cir. 1988), cert. denied, 489 U.S. 1079 (1989)) (emphasis in
original). To be sure, “[a] plaintiff may not convert state law claims into a
federal treble damage action simply by alleging that wrongful acts are a
pattern of racketeering relating to an enterprise.”
Summary
Detailed explanation of the requirements for pleading and proving damages
in a civil RICO action in the Fifth Circuit. It outlines the necessity of
demonstrating a concrete financial loss to business or property, the
exclusion of personal injuries, and the requirement of proximate causation
between the RICO violation and the damages claimed. The passage also
emphasizes the need for a pattern of racketeering activity connected to an
enterprise.

U.S. District Court — Eastern District of Texas

=== PAGE 29 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
The jury found all defendants liable for RICO conspiracy; seven defendants
liable for the substantive RICO violation... The jury awarded Plaintiffs
$300,000 in civil RICO damages; $379,500 in state law damages; and
$1,320,500 in disgorgement... The Court has already held that the federal
one-satisfaction rule applies to cases involving RICO claims... The Court
must decide whether Tom and Rafique's settlement agreements, as well as
the jury's award, 'pertain inseparably to one and the same loss' to determine
if the one-satisfaction rule applies... The Court will offset Plaintiffs' award
for RICO damages by $200,000 due to Tom's settlement agreement but the
full $400,000 will not be credited at this time because attorneys' fees have
not been awarded.
Summary
The passage provides insight into how damages are awarded and adjusted in
civil RICO actions in the Fifth Circuit. It highlights the application of the
federal one-satisfaction rule, which prevents double recovery for the same
loss, and discusses the offset of damages based on settlement agreements.
The passage also indicates that disgorgement can be awarded to deter
future wrongful conduct under the RICO statute.
Arroyo v. Oprona, Inc., No. 17-20576 (5th Cir. May 31, 2018)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
A plaintiff has standing under the RICO statute if she can show she 'has
been injured in [her] business or property by the conduct constituting the
violation'—that is, by the commission of the predicate acts.
Summary
The passage provides insight into the standing requirement for a civil RICO
claim, which is foundational for pleading damages. It specifies that a
plaintiff must demonstrate injury to business or property caused by the
predicate acts constituting the RICO violation. This is a critical element in
establishing a claim for damages under RICO, as it directly ties the injury to
the unlawful conduct.

Extract
Defendants also argue that plaintiffs have not alleged an injury sufficient to
confer standing under RICO, pursuant to the civil RICO standing
requirement, codified in 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c). As stated earlier, standing is
only conferred to persons who have been injured 'by reason of' the alleged
predicate acts. Crawford, 23 F.Supp.2d at 679 (citing Sedima, 473 U.S. at
496, 105 S.Ct. 3275). The Fifth Circuit has held that 'a person will be
considered injured 'by reason of' a RICO violation if the predicate acts
constitute (1) factual (but for) causation and (2) legal (proximate) causation
of the alleged injury.' Ocean Energy II, Inc. v. Alexander & Alexander, Inc.,
868 F.2d 740, 744 (5th Cir.1989).
Summary
The passage provides insight into the standing requirements for a civil RICO
action in the Fifth Circuit. It specifies that to have standing, a plaintiff must
demonstrate injury "by reason of" the alleged predicate acts, which requires
both factual (but for) causation and legal (proximate) causation. This is
crucial for pleading damages in a civil RICO action, as it establishes the
connection between the defendant's conduct and the plaintiff's injury.

U.S. District Court — Southern District of Texas
Extract
Congress enacted RICO in order to prohibit conduct involving a pattern of
racketeering activity.” [] “One of RICO's enforcement mechanisms is a
private right of action, available to ‘[a]ny person injured in his business or
property by reason of a violation' of the RICO's substantive restrictions.” []
“However, due to the availability of treble damages under RICO, courts
‘must be wary of transforming business-contract or fraud disputes into
federal RICO claims.’” [] “Accordingly, despite multiple opportunities to
amend and a clear checklist of what must be included to state a RICO claim,
Order, ECF No. 44 at 13-14, Plaintiffs still fail to plead a single predicate act
with the requisite particularity per Rule 9(b). Because a civil RICO claim
requires at least two predicate acts to establish a ‘pattern of racketeering
activity,’ 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5), Plaintiffs fail to state a RICO claim.
Summary
The passage provides insight into the requirements for pleading a civil RICO
claim, emphasizing the need for particularity in alleging predicate acts and
the caution courts must exercise due to the availability of treble damages. It
highlights the necessity of establishing a pattern of racketeering activity,
which requires at least two predicate acts.

National Enterprises, Inc. v. Mellon Financial Services Corp. No. 7, 847 F.2d
251 (5th Cir. 1988)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
Where the plaintiff alleges each element of the violation, the compensable
injury necessarily is the harm caused by the predicate acts sufficiently
related to constitute a pattern, for the essence of the violation is the
commission of those acts in connection with the conduct of an enterprise.
Those acts are, when committed in the circumstances delineated in Sec.
1962(c), 'an activity which RICO was designed to deter.' Any recoverable
damages occurring by reason of a violation of section 1962(c) will flow from
the commission of the predicate acts.
Summary
In a civil RICO action, the compensable injury is the harm directly caused by
the predicate acts that form a pattern of racketeering activity. The essence
of a RICO violation is the commission of these acts in connection with an
enterprise. Therefore, any recoverable damages must flow from these
predicate acts. This suggests that for a plaintiff to recover damages, they
must demonstrate that their injury was directly caused by the predicate acts
that constitute the RICO violation.

RICO creates a civil cause of action for '[a]ny person injured in his business
or property by reason of a violation of section 1962.' 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c); see
also Beck v. Prupis, 529 U.S. 494, 120 S.Ct. 1608, 146 L.Ed.2d 561 (2000);

state a RICO claim under § 1962, 'there must be: `(1) a person who engages
in (2) a pattern of racketeering activity (3) connected to the acquisition,
establishment, conduct, or control of an enterprise.'
Summary
Basic requirements for a civil RICO claim, which includes demonstrating
injury to business or property due to a violation of section 1962. This is
foundational for understanding the types of damages that can be claimed
under RICO, as the injury must be directly tied to the racketeering activity.
The passage does not explicitly discuss compensatory, treble, punitive, or
restitution damages, but it establishes the necessity of proving injury to

Extract
RICO provides that '[a]ny person injured in his business or property by
reason of a violation of section 1962 of this chapter may sue therefor. .. .'
The Supreme Court, in Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corp.,
explicitly confirmed that the 'by reason of' language in RICO requires a
causal connection between the predicate mail or wire fraud and a plaintiff's
injury that includes 'but for' and 'proximate' causation.
Summary
In the Fifth Circuit, to plead and prove damages in a civil RICO action, there
must be a causal connection between the predicate act (such as mail or wire
fraud) and the plaintiff's injury. This includes both "but for" causation and
"proximate" causation. The passage does not specifically address
compensatory, treble, punitive, or restitution damages, but it establishes the
foundational requirement of causation for any RICO damages claim.

In the alternative, even if Anderson has properly alleged his eligibility for
the NIFA Bonds and is the proper representative of the class, Anderson and
the entire class of farmers and ranchers have not suffered any damages.
They have not been 'injured' as a result of the RICO violation, a necessity for
standing under RICO. Such speculative damages are not compensable under
RICO, Hecht v. Commerce Clearing House, Inc., 897 F.2d 21, 24 (2d Cir.
1990) (holding that 'injury in the form of lost business commissions ... is too
speculative to confer standing, because Hecht only alleges that he would
have lost commissions in the future, and not that he has lost any yet'), and
the legal entitlement claim that Anderson brings is precisely the type of
'intangible property interest' that RICO does not protect, Steele v. Hospital
Corp. of Am., 36 F.3d 69, 70 (9th Cir.1994) (holding that, for RICO standing,
the plaintiffs must prove a 'concrete financial loss,' an actual loss 'of their
own money,' and 'not mere 'injury to a valuable intangible property interest'
'). Anderson has not alleged that the plaintiffs have ever lost any money as a
result of the RICO scheme. Oscar v. University Students Co-op. Ass'n, 965 F.

581 (1992) and --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 656, 121 L.Ed.2d 581 (1992), (holding
that the plaintiff had not alleged any financial loss necessary for RICO
standing because '[t]he only injury she has alleged is a 'decrease in the
value of her property,' ' and not 'any out-of-pocket expenditures as a direct
or indirect result of the' RICO scheme).
Summary
The passage emphasizes that for standing in a RICO action, plaintiffs must
demonstrate a concrete financial loss, not merely speculative damages or
injury to intangible property interests. This requirement is crucial for
establishing standing under RICO, as speculative damages are not
compensable. The passage references other cases to support this standard,
indicating that actual financial loss is necessary for RICO standing.
Allstate Ins. Co. v. Plambeck, 802 F.3d 665 (5th Cir. 2015)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
Regarding causation, RICO provides civil remedies to '[a]ny person injured
in his business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962.' 18
U.S.C. § 1964(c). An injured party must show that the violation was the but-
for and proximate cause of the injury. Bridge v. Phoenix Bond & Indem. Co.,
553 U.S. 639, 654, 128 S.Ct. 2131, 170 L.Ed.2d 1012 (2008). In cases
predicated on mail or wire fraud, reliance is not necessary. ... The court did
not abuse its discretion in denying prejudgment interest. It could reasonably
have concluded that Allstate's recovery of treble damages sufficiently offset
the loss it suffered from being deprived of the use of its money caused by
the fraud. Treble damages under RICO are partly punitive, allowing
recovery to 'exceed actual provable damages.' Gil Ramirez Grp., L.L.C. v.
Hous. Indep. Sch. Dist., 786 F.3d 400, 412–13 (5th Cir.2015).
Summary
The passage provides insight into the legal standards for damages in a civil
RICO action in the Fifth Circuit. It highlights that a plaintiff must
demonstrate that the RICO violation was both the but-for and proximate
cause of the injury. It also clarifies that in RICO cases predicated on mail or
wire fraud, reliance is not necessary. Furthermore, the passage explains that
treble damages under RICO are partly punitive and can exceed actual
provable damages, which can offset the need for prejudgment interest.

RICO makes it 'unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any
enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign
commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of
such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.' 18 U.S.C.
§ 1962(c). It allows '[a]ny person injured in his business or property by
reason of a violation of section 1962' to bring a civil suit for treble damages.
Id. § 1964(c). To state a claim under § 1962(c), a plaintiff must adequately
plead that the defendant engaged in '(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3)
through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity.'
Summary
The passage provides the legal framework for a civil RICO claim, specifically
mentioning the requirement for a plaintiff to plead and prove that they were
injured in their business or property by a violation of section 1962, which
allows for treble damages. This is directly relevant to understanding the
standards for damages in a civil RICO action.
Hughes v. Tobacco Institute, Inc., 278 F.3d 417 (5th Cir. 2001)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
To prevail in a RICO suit, a plaintiff must demonstrate an injury to business
or property. 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c); Sedima S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479,
496, 105 S.Ct. 3275, 87 L.Ed.2d 346 (1985) ('[T]he plaintiff only has
standing if, and can only recover to the extent that, he has been injured in
his business or property.'). The phrase 'injury to business or property'
excludes personal injuries.
Summary
Personal injuries are excluded from the scope of recoverable damages in a
RICO action. This indicates that compensatory damages in a RICO action are
limited to those that can be shown to have affected the plaintiff's business or
property. The passage does not directly address treble, punitive, or
restitution damages, but it establishes the foundational requirement for any
damages claim under RICO.

U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit

Extract
Burzynski has also failed to plead a RICO violation, his last cause of action.
The plaintiff alleges RICO violations under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(a), (b), (c), and
(d). Boiled down to their essence in plain English, the subsections state: (a)
a person who has received income from a pattern of racketeering cannot
invest that income in an enterprise. (b) a person cannot acquire or maintain
an interest in an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering. (c) a person
who is employed by or associated with an enterprise cannot conduct the
enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering. (d) a person cannot
conspire to violate subsections (a), (b), or (c). Thus, RICO claims under all
four subsections necessitate: '1) a person who engages in 2) a pattern of
racketeering activity, 3) connected to the acquisition, establishment,
conduct, or control of an enterprise.' Delta Truck & Tractor, Inc. v. J.I. Case
Co., 855 F.2d 241, 242 (5th Cir.1988), cert. denied, 489 U.S. 1079, 109 S.Ct.
1531, 103 L.Ed.2d 836 (1989) (emphasis in original). We conclude that the
plaintiff failed to properly plead both a 'pattern of racketeering activity' and
a RICO 'enterprise.' ... The difficulty is that the pleading the plaintiff relies
on to accomplish this is too general, speculative, and unsupported by facts.
To permit it to serve the plaintiff's purposes would allow conclusory pleading
to erode the substance of the 'continuity,' 'enterprise,' and 'pattern'
requirements. The defendants could then escape the clutches of RICO only
by establishing a negative, viz., that they had not engaged with others in the
charged manner. We should avoid imposing such a burden. At the same time,
in the posture of this litigation, we think it would be premature to dismiss
the RICO claim with prejudice. The plaintiff should be given an opportunity
to amend his pleading to make it conform to the requirements set forth in
this portion of the opinion. Therefore, we affirm the district court's dismissal
of the RICO claim without prejudice and remand this portion of our decision
to the district court with instructions to permit the plaintiff an opportunity to
amend his complaint to plead a valid RICO claim.
Summary
Necessity for a plaintiff to properly plead a RICO violation by establishing a
pattern of racketeering activity connected to an enterprise. It emphasizes
the need for specific, factual allegations rather than general or speculative
claims. The court's decision to allow the plaintiff to amend the complaint
suggests that the pleading must meet certain standards to proceed.

Even if we assume both that the plaintiffs had a valid property interest in
their causes of action under Texas law and that Mobil deprived them of this
property by fraudulently representing that it was a subscriber, we doubt the
plaintiffs have satisfied the RICO standing requirement. A plaintiff may not

sue under RICO unless he can show concrete financial loss. In re Taxable
Mun. Bond Secs. Litig., 51 F.3d 518, 523 (5th Cir.1995); accord
Imagineering, Inc. v. Kiewit Pac. Co., 976 F.2d 1303, 1310 (9th Cir.1992). It
is undisputed that the plaintiffs received workers' compensation benefits
from Mobil's insurers for each and every work-related injury at issue.
Because it is unclear whether Mobil was negligent with regard to these
injuries, it is possible that the plaintiffs ended up better off — that is, the
plaintiffs may have recovered more by collecting workers' compensation
benefits over the years than if they had exercised their right to sue. If this is
in fact the case, then the plaintiffs have failed to show that they were injured
at all, much less that they suffered the concrete injury required for RICO
standing.
Summary
The passage from the Fifth Circuit's decision in Patterson v. Mobil Oil Corp.
highlights the necessity for a plaintiff to demonstrate a concrete financial
loss to establish standing in a RICO action. This requirement is crucial
because RICO claims are predicated on the plaintiff being "injured in his
business or property." The court emphasizes that speculative or potential
losses are insufficient; the injury must be tangible and quantifiable. This
aligns with the broader legal standards for damages in civil RICO actions,
where compensatory damages must be proven with specificity, and treble
damages are available only if the plaintiff can establish the requisite injury.
Punitive damages are not typically available under RICO, as the statute itself
provides for treble damages as a form of punishment and deterrence.
Restitution damages would similarly require a clear demonstration of loss or
deprivation of property.

RICO's civil provision creates a cause of action for 'any person injured in his
business or property by reason of a violation' of any of the statute's
prohibited activities. 18 U.S.C. § 1964. At issue here is the injury
requirement. The plaintiff's injury must be 'conclusive' and cannot be
'speculative.' In re Taxable Mun. Bond Sec. Litig., 51 F.3d 518, 523 (5th Cir.

RICO is also more than a criminal statute. When drafting the legislation,
Congress incorporated provisions in RICO that allow private plaintiffs to
seek redress in federal court. If their lawsuit succeeds, the statute provides
a big payout: Plaintiffs are entitled to triple damages, court costs, and
attorney's fees. 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c).
Summary
The passage provides insight into the damages available under RICO for
private plaintiffs, specifically mentioning that successful plaintiffs are
entitled to treble damages, court costs, and attorney's fees. This aligns with
the statutory provision under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c), which is applicable to civil
RICO claims.
Earl v. The Boeing Co.
Extract
A substantive RICO violation does not, however, permit just anyone to bring
suit. Only those who suffer injury to their 'business or property by reason of
a violation of section 1962' have statutory standing. 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c).
RICO standing has two elements: injury and causation. Price v. Pinnacle
Brands, Inc., 138 F.3d 602, 606 (5th Cir. 1998) (per curiam). A RICO injury
must affect the plaintiff's 'business or property,' which ordinarily means that
there must be 'concrete financial loss.' Patterson v. Mobil Oil Corp., 335 F.3d
476, 492 n.16 (5th Cir. 2003). When an injury is 'speculative and does not
show a conclusive financial loss,' it does not constitute an injury under RICO.
In re Taxable Mun. Bond Sec. Litig., 51 F.3d 518, 523 (5th Cir. 1995). 'A
RICO plaintiff must also plausibly allege that the RICO violation proximately
caused the plaintiff's injuries.' Molina-Aranda v. Black Magic Enters., L.L.C.,
983 F.3d 779, 784 (5th Cir. 2020). The Fifth Circuit has generally found
RICO causation present where the injury was 'either a direct result or a
reasonably probable consequence' of the defendant's conduct. Allstate Ins.

business or property and clarifies that speculative injuries do not meet the
threshold for a RICO claim. The passage also emphasizes the importance of
causation, stating that the injury must be a direct result or a reasonably
probable consequence of the defendant's conduct.

RICO also provides for civil remedies. Under Section 1964 'any person
injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962'
may bring a civil action in either state or federal court for redress. Thus, a
plaintiff in a civil action must show, in addition to one of the four acts
described in § 1962, an injury to business or property. A showing of such
injury requires proof of concrete financial loss, not 'mere injury' to a
valuable intangible property interest. Oscar v. University Students Co-Op.
Ass'n, 965 F.2d 783, 785 (9th Cir. 1992). Generally, personal injuries are not
recoverable under RICO. See id. at 785-86 (citing Reiter v. Sonotone Corp.,
442 U.S. 330, 339, 99 S. Ct. 2326, 60 L. Ed. 2d 931 (dictum)). Further, in
Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corp., 503 U.S. 258, 268 112 S. Ct.
1311, 117 L. Ed. 2d 532 , the United States Supreme Court held that the ''by
reason of' language in section 1964(c) means that in order to prevail on a
civil RICO claim, the plaintiff must show that the defendant's violation was
the 'proximate cause' of the plaintiff's injury.' Where common law wire or
securities fraud are the predicate acts for a civil RICO action, the plaintiff
must establish 'reasonable reliance.' See: Fifth Circuit: Summit Props, Inc. v.
Hoechst Celanese Corp., 214 F.3d 556, 562 (5th Cir. 2000) ('when civil RICO
damages are sought for injuries resulting from fraud, a general requirement
of reliance by the plaintiff is a commonsense liability limitation.').
Summary
Requirements for pleading and proving damages in a civil RICO action,
emphasizing the need for a plaintiff to demonstrate a concrete financial loss
and the proximate cause of the injury. It also highlights the necessity of
establishing reasonable reliance when fraud is a predicate act. The passage
is relevant to understanding the legal standards for damages in civil RICO
actions in the Fifth Circuit.

Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy
The Brief - American Bar Association - 2024-01-01
Extract
To recover damages under civil RICO requires proof of concrete financial
loss and not merely injury to a valuable intangible property interest. The
measure of damages is the harm caused by the predicate acts constituting
the pattern of racketeering activity. A compensable injury is the harm
caused by predicate acts sufficiently related to constitute a pattern.
Plaintiffs are required to set out a reasonable basis of recovery by
competent proof and not mere speculation. Only damages to 'business or
property' occurring 'by reason of' and proximately caused by the RICO
violations are compensable under § 1964(c). Further, under Sedima, the
plaintiff’s compensable injury is the harm caused by the predicate acts.
Future damages may be appropriate, but only to the extent that the plaintiff
can establish with reasonable certainty that future damages will occur as a
result of the defendant’s RICO violation. In addition to recovery of damages
in the amount of the calculated harm, RICO is a potent weapon because it
allows for a bonus recovery not typically available elsewhere. Section
1964(c) dictates the award of treble damages for civil RICO violations. It
provides that the plaintiff 'shall recover threefold the damages he sustains'
in addition to costs and attorney fees. This is not discretionary. Imposition of
treble damages is required by RICO.
Summary
Requirements for proving damages in a civil RICO action, emphasizing the
need for concrete financial loss and a reasonable basis for recovery. It
highlights that damages must be proximately caused by the RICO violations
and that treble damages are mandatory under § 1964(c). The passage also
notes that future damages may be recoverable if they can be established
with reasonable certainty.

Supreme Court Expands The Scope Of Injuries Under RICO
Extract
On April 2, 2025, the Supreme Court significantly expanded the scope of
injuries entitled to treble damages under the Racketeer Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations Act ('RICO'). The Supreme Court held in Medical
Marijuana, Inc. v. Horn that 'a plaintiff may seek treble damages for
business or property loss even if the loss resulted from a personal injury.'
Summary
The Supreme Court has broadened the interpretation of what constitutes an
injury under RICO, allowing for treble damages even when the business or
property loss is derived from a personal injury. This decision impacts how
damages are pleaded and proved in civil RICO actions, as it allows for a
wider range of injuries to qualify for treble damages, which are a significant
component of RICO's remedial scheme.
Defending RICO Claims In The Business Context Part II: RICO Claims Must
Allege Injury To Business Or Property
Extract
If a plaintiff brings a civil suit alleging a RICO violation, the plaintiff must
plausibly allege that his injury animating the RICO claim is associated with
his business or property by reason of the defendant's violation of the RICO
laws. Absent these allegations, the lawsuit must be dismissed. RICO
standing is distinct from the more well-known concept of constitutional
standing. For RICO claims, in addition to pleading a sufficiently specific
injury, including allegations that the plaintiff has suffered known damages
(as opposed to mere speculative or unprovable damages), the plaintiff must
allege that he suffered an injury to his business or property that bears some
causal relationship to the alleged act or acts that violated RICO. This
fundamental RICO requirement helps ensure that RICO is not expanded
beyond its original intent. Although 'business' and 'property' are not defined
under RICO, these terms are not all-encompassing. Indeed, most courts have
construed them narrowly to mean that there must be a pecuniary injury to a
proprietary interest, and thus a plaintiff must show some sort of concrete
financial loss. In addition, the injury must be ascertainable and definable,
such as when a plaintiff is deprived of the ability to use or transfer property.
Summary
Requirements for a plaintiff to establish standing in a civil RICO action,
emphasizing the need for a concrete financial loss or pecuniary injury to a
proprietary interest. It highlights that the injury must be directly caused by

the defendant's RICO violation and must be ascertainable and definable.
This ensures that RICO claims are not based on speculative or unprovable
damages and that the injury is directly related to the alleged RICO violation.
