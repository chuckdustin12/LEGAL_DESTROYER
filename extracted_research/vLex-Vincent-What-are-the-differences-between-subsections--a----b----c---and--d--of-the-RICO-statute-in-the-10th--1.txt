Question
What are the differences between subsections (a), (b), (c), and (d) of the
RICO statute in the 10th Circuit?
Answer (Tenth Circuit)
Short response
The RICO statute (18 U.S.C. § 1962) in the 10th Circuit contains four distinct
subsections: (a) prohibits investing income derived from racketeering
activity in an enterprise, (b) prohibits acquiring or maintaining an interest in
an enterprise through racketeering, (c) prohibits conducting an enterprise's
affairs through racketeering, and (d) prohibits conspiring to violate any of
the other three subsections.
Summary
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) was
enacted as Title IX of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970 and is
codified as 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961-1968. At its core, the statute contains four key
prohibitions outlined in § 1962(a)-(d), each targeting different aspects of
using racketeering activity in connection with an enterprise engaged in or
affecting interstate commerce. In the Tenth Circuit, as in all federal circuits,
these provisions create distinct causes of action with specific elements that
must be proven.
Section 1962(a) prohibits the investment of income derived from
racketeering activity in an enterprise. Section 1962(b), considered the least
utilized provision, forbids acquiring or maintaining an interest in an
enterprise through racketeering. Section 1962(c), the most commonly
invoked provision, makes it unlawful for a person associated with an
enterprise to conduct its affairs through racketeering activity. Finally,
Section 1962(d) creates liability for conspiring to violate any of the other
three substantive provisions. Each subsection requires proof of an
enterprise and a pattern of racketeering activity but differs in how the
defendant must interact with the enterprise and the racketeering activity.
Background and Legal Framework of RICO
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) is primarily
codified at 18 U.S.C. § 1962, which sets out four specific prohibitions against
the use of a pattern of racketeering activity to infiltrate, control, or operate
"a[n] enterprise which is engaged in, or the activities of which affect,
interstate or foreign commerce." United States v. Joseph, CR 17-02483 KG/
JHR (D. N.M. Apr 11, 2022); Jacobo-Rosas v. United States Attorney, CV
21-0789 KG/GBW (D. N.M. Mar 02, 2022).

While RICO was originally enacted to combat organized crime, its use has
expanded considerably in both criminal and civil contexts. All RICO
subsections share certain common elements, including the existence of an
enterprise engaged in or affecting interstate commerce and a pattern of
racketeering activity. However, each subsection creates a distinct cause of
action with its own specific elements.
The Four Subsections of RICO in Detail
Subsection (a): Investment of Racketeering Proceeds
Section 1962(a) makes it unlawful to invest income derived from a pattern of
racketeering activity in an enterprise. United States v. Joseph, CR 17-02483
KG/JHR (D. N.M. Apr 11, 2022) ("Section 1962(a) makes it unlawful to invest
income derived from a pattern of racketeering activity in an enterprise.").
The precise statutory language, as quoted in Farlow v. Peat Marwick
Mitchell & Co., 666 F. Supp. 1500 (W.D. Okla. 1987), provides:
"It shall be unlawful for any person who has received any income derived,
directly or indirectly, from a pattern of racketeering activity or through
collection of an unlawful debt... to use or invest, directly or indirectly, any
part of such income in acquisition of any interest in, or the establishment or
operation of, any enterprise which is engaged in, or the activities of which
affect, interstate or foreign commerce."
A violation of § 1962(a) therefore requires proof that:
The defendant received income from a pattern of racketeering activity;
The defendant used or invested that income, or the proceeds of that
income, in the acquisition of an interest in, or the establishment or
operation of, an enterprise; and
The enterprise was engaged in, or its activities affected, interstate or
foreign commerce.
An important distinction noted in the Tenth Circuit is that for claims under §
1962(a), "a plaintiff 'must plead facts tending to show that he was injured by
the use or investment of racketeering income. Injury from the racketeering
acts themselves is not sufficient because section 1962(a) does not prohibit
those acts.'" Zibalstar, L.C. v. Conte, Case No. 2:17-CV-563 (D. Utah Mar 27,
2018).
This requirement creates a critical difference between § 1962(a) and the
other subsections: the plaintiff must demonstrate an injury flowing
specifically from the investment or use of racketeering proceeds in an
enterprise, not merely from the predicate racketeering acts themselves.

Subsection (b): Acquisition or Maintenance of an
Enterprise Through Racketeering
Section 1962(b) makes it unlawful to acquire or maintain an interest in or
control of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. United
States v. Joseph, CR 17-02483 KG/JHR (D. N.M. Apr 11, 2022) ("Section
1962(b) makes it unlawful to acquire or maintain an interest in an enterprise
through a pattern of racketeering activity.").
As quoted in Tal v. Hogan, 453 F.3d 1244 (10th Cir. 2006), § 1962(b) makes it
illegal for "any person through a pattern of racketeering activity or through
collection of an unlawful debt to acquire or maintain, directly or indirectly,
any interest in or control of any enterprise which is engaged in...
interstate... commerce."
To establish a violation of § 1962(b), a plaintiff must prove:
The existence of an enterprise;
The enterprise engaged in or affected interstate or foreign commerce;
The defendant acquired or maintained, directly or indirectly, an interest
in or control of the enterprise; and
The defendant acquired or maintained this interest through a pattern of
racketeering activity or collection of an unlawful debt.
Section 1962(b) is noted to be "the least used of the four RICO subsections"
according to secondary material. RICO: A Primer (2022-01-31). Courts have
held that "a plaintiff must allege a specific nexus between control of the
named enterprise and the alleged racketeering activity" to succeed on a §
1962(b) claim. Id.
Subsection (c): Conducting Enterprise Affairs Through
Racketeering
Section 1962(c) makes it unlawful for a person employed by or associated
with an enterprise to conduct the enterprise's affairs through a pattern of
racketeering activity. United States v. Joseph, CR 17-02483 KG/JHR (D. N.M.
Apr 11, 2022) ("Section 1962(c) makes it unlawful for a person employed by
or associated with an enterprise to conduct the enterprise's affairs through a
pattern of racketeering activity.").
The full text of the provision, as quoted in Farlow v. Peat Marwick Mitchell &
Co., 666 F. Supp. 1500 (W.D. Okla. 1987), states:
"It shall be unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any
enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign
commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of
such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity or
collection of unlawful debt."
To establish a violation of § 1962(c), a plaintiff must prove:
The existence of an enterprise;
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
1. 

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
The enterprise engaged in or affected interstate or foreign commerce;
The defendant was employed by or associated with the enterprise;
The defendant conducted or participated, directly or indirectly, in the
conduct of the affairs of the enterprise; and
The defendant participated in the affairs of the enterprise through a
pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt.
Section 1962(c) is "far and away, the most often used and important
substantive RICO provision." RICO: A Primer (2022-01-31). The Supreme
Court has clarified that to "conduct or participate" in the affairs of an
enterprise requires some part in directing the enterprise's affairs, not
merely having some association with the enterprise. This is often referred to
as the "operation or management" test.
In Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy (2024-01-01), it is noted that "A violation of
§ 1962(c)... requires (1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern
(4) of racketeering activity. The plaintiff must allege each of the elements to
state a claim. They are all equally essential components, and the complaint
will fail if any one of them is not adequately pleaded."
Subsection (d): Conspiracy to Violate RICO
Section 1962(d) makes it unlawful to conspire to violate any of the other
three substantive RICO provisions. United States v. Joseph, CR 17-02483
KG/JHR (D. N.M. Apr 11, 2022) ("§ 1962(d) makes it unlawful to conspire to
violate any of the other three prohibitions.").
As quoted in Farlow v. Peat Marwick Mitchell & Co., 666 F. Supp. 1500 (W.D.
Okla. 1987), § 1962(d) states that "it shall be unlawful for any person to
conspire to violate any of the provisions of subsections (a), (b), or (c) of this
section."
To establish a violation of § 1962(d), a plaintiff must prove:
The existence of an enterprise (or that an enterprise would exist);
The enterprise was (or would be) engaged in or affected interstate or
foreign commerce; and
That each defendant knowingly agreed that a conspirator would
commit a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(a), (b), or (c).
Importantly, the Supreme Court has held that "to establish a RICO
conspiracy offense under Section 1962(d), there is no requirement that the
defendant 'himself committed or agreed to commit the two predicate acts
requisite for a substantive RICO offense under § 1962(c).'" RICO: A Primer
(2022-01-31). This means that a defendant can be liable for a RICO
conspiracy even without having personally committed or agreed to commit
the predicate acts of racketeering.

Key Differences Between the Subsections
Different Prohibited Activities
The fundamental difference between subsections (a), (b), (c), and (d) lies in
the specific activities they prohibit:
Subsection (a) targets the investment of proceeds from racketeering
activity. It focuses on what happens to the money or benefits obtained
from racketeering after the fact - specifically, its investment in an
enterprise. Defending Civil RICO Claims: A Defense Plan Should Be In
Every Business's Arsenal (2022-02-03) ("Section 1962(a) prohibits a
person from investing in an enterprise any income derived from a
pattern of racketeering activity.").
Subsection (b) targets the acquisition or control of an enterprise
through racketeering. It focuses on how a defendant gains or maintains
power over an enterprise. Saine v. AIA, INC., 582 F.Supp. 1299 (D. Colo.
1984) ("Section 1962(b) prohibits the operation of or acquisition of an
interest in an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity.").
Subsection (c) targets the operation of an enterprise through
racketeering. It focuses on how the affairs of an enterprise are
conducted. Joseph v. U.S. Pub. Defenders Office (D. N.M. Nov 9, 2021)
("[It is unlawful] for a person employed by or associated with an
enterprise, to conduct the enterprise's affairs through a pattern of
racketeering activity.").
Subsection (d) targets conspiracy to commit any of the above
violations. It extends liability to those who agree to participate in any of
the substantive RICO violations, even if they did not personally commit
predicate acts. Saine v. AIA, INC., 582 F.Supp. 1299 (D. Colo. 1984)
("Section 1962(d) states that it is forbidden to conspire to violate any of
the substantive provisions of section 1962.").
Different Relationships to the Enterprise
Each subsection requires a different relationship between the defendant and
the enterprise:
Under subsection (a), the defendant need not be associated with the
enterprise prior to investing the racketeering proceeds. The violation
occurs when the defendant invests those proceeds in the enterprise.
Under subsection (b), the defendant acquires or maintains interest in
or control over the enterprise through racketeering activity. The
enterprise is essentially the target of the racketeering.
Under subsection (c), the defendant must be "employed by or
associated with" the enterprise and conduct its affairs through
racketeering. Here, the enterprise is the vehicle through which
racketeering occurs.

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Under subsection (d), the defendant need only conspire to create the
necessary relationship with an enterprise required by subsections (a),
(b), or (c).
Different Injury Requirements
The subsections also differ in the type of injury that must be alleged in civil
RICO claims:
For subsection (a), plaintiffs must allege injury specifically from the
investment or use of racketeering proceeds, not just from the predicate
acts. Zibalstar, L.C. v. Conte, Case No. 2:17-CV-563 (D. Utah Mar 27,
2018) ("a plaintiff 'must plead facts tending to show that he was injured
by the use or investment of racketeering income. Injury from the
racketeering acts themselves is not sufficient because section 1962(a)
does not prohibit those acts.'").
For subsection (b), plaintiffs must typically show injury from the
acquisition or maintenance of an interest in the enterprise, not merely
from the predicate acts.
For subsection (c), plaintiffs must show injury resulting from the
conduct of an enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering
activity.
For subsection (d), plaintiffs must show injury from the conspiracy to
violate subsections (a), (b), or (c).
Different Prevalence in Practice
The subsections vary significantly in how frequently they are invoked in
practice:
Subsection (c) is by far the most commonly used provision. RICO: A
Primer (2022-01-31) ("Subsection (c) is, far and away, the most often
used and important substantive RICO provision."); Defending Civil
RICO Claims: A Defense Plan Should Be In Every Business's Arsenal
(2022-02-03) ("claims under Section 1962(c) are the most commonly
asserted").
Subsection (b) is the least used provision. RICO: A Primer
(2022-01-31) ("Section 1962(b) is the least used of the four RICO
subsections.").
Subsection (a) and subsection (d) fall somewhere in between, with
the conspiracy provision (d) typically being used in conjunction with
claims under the other subsections.
Application in the Tenth Circuit
The Tenth Circuit has addressed these RICO provisions in various cases,
applying the general principles outlined above. For example, in Tal v. Hogan,
4. 
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
1. 
2. 
3. 

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
453 F.3d 1244 (10th Cir. 2006), the court addressed claims brought under §
1962(b), (c), and (d), articulating the elements necessary to prove each type
of violation.
The Tenth Circuit decisions consistently recognize that "the elements of a
civil RICO claim are (1) investment in, control of, or conduct of (2) an
enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity." Tal v. Hogan,
453 F.3d 1244 (10th Cir. 2006). However, the precise demonstration of these
elements differs based on which subsection is alleged to have been violated.
Courts in the Tenth Circuit have also recognized that these provisions are
not mutually exclusive, and in many cases, plaintiffs bring claims under
multiple subsections. In Plains Resources, Inc. v. Gable, 782 F.2d 883 (10th
Cir. 1986), the court assessed claims under Colorado's state RICO analog,
which contains provisions similar to the federal RICO statute, demonstrating
the influence and parallel development of RICO jurisprudence across federal
and state contexts within the Tenth Circuit.
Distinguishing Factors in Venue and
Jurisdiction
In addition to the substantive differences between the RICO subsections,
there may be procedural distinctions as well. In 100 Mount Holly Bypass v.
Axos Bank, Case No. 2:20-CV-856-TS-CMR (D. Utah Jul 27, 2021), the court
noted that "Section (a) concerns venue, allowing an action to 'be brought in
a district court where personal jurisdiction based on minimum contacts is
established as to at least one defendant.' Section (b) then authorizes
nationwide jurisdiction over other defendants in that district when 'the ends
of justice require' it."
While this refers to a different section of the RICO statute than § 1962, it
highlights the complex procedural aspects that accompany RICO litigation
and may differ based on the substantive claims brought under the various
subsections of § 1962.
Exceptions and Caveats
While the four subsections of RICO create distinct causes of action, several
important exceptions and caveats should be noted:
Overlap in Practice: In practice, there can be considerable overlap
between these provisions, particularly in complex cases where
defendants are alleged to have engaged in multiple types of prohibited
conduct.
Heightened Pleading Requirements: RICO claims based on fraud
predicates must satisfy the heightened pleading requirements of
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b). Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy
(2024-01-01) ("RICO claims based on mail or wire fraud must comport
with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b)'s requirement that allegations
involving fraud be pleaded with particularity.").
1. 
2. 

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Interstate Commerce Requirement: All subsections require that the
enterprise be engaged in or affect interstate commerce, but the
threshold for meeting this requirement is relatively low. Civil Rico: A
Tool of Advocacy (2024-01-01) ("RICO requires no more than a slight
effect upon interstate commerce.").
Conspiracy Liability Without Predicate Acts: A defendant can be
liable for a RICO conspiracy under § 1962(d) without personally
committing or agreeing to commit predicate acts, as long as they
knowingly agree that someone would commit the substantive RICO
violation. RICO: A Primer (2022-01-31).
Conclusion
The four subsections of the RICO statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1962(a)-(d), present
distinct but related prohibitions against different aspects of racketeering
activity in connection with enterprises engaged in or affecting interstate
commerce. In the Tenth Circuit, as elsewhere, these provisions have been
interpreted to require different elements of proof and to address different
forms of conduct.
Section 1962(a) focuses on the investment of racketeering proceeds in an
enterprise and requires a showing of injury from this investment, not just
from the predicate acts themselves. Section 1962(b), the least commonly
used provision, prohibits acquiring or maintaining an interest in or control
over an enterprise through racketeering activity. Section 1962(c), the most
frequently invoked subsection, makes it unlawful for a person associated
with an enterprise to conduct its affairs through a pattern of racketeering
activity. Finally, Section 1962(d) extends liability to those who conspire to
violate any of the substantive RICO provisions, even without personally
committing predicate acts.
Understanding these distinctions is crucial for both plaintiffs and defendants
in RICO litigation within the Tenth Circuit, as they determine the specific
elements that must be proven or defended against, the nature of the injury
that must be alleged, and the relationship that must exist between the
defendant, the racketeering activity, and the enterprise.

U.S. District Court — District of Utah
Extract
Consequently, to state a claim under § 1962(a), a plaintiff 'must plead facts
tending to show that he was injured by the use or investment of
racketeering income. Injury from the racketeering acts themselves is not
sufficient because section 1962(a) does not prohibit those acts.' ... Section
1962(b) makes it unlawful for any person 'through a pattern of racketeering

Summary
Detailed explanation of the requirements and prohibitions under subsections
(a), (b), and (c) of the RICO statute. It clarifies that subsection (a) requires
injury from the use or investment of racketeering income, subsection (b)
prohibits acquiring or maintaining interest in an enterprise through
racketeering, and subsection (c) prohibits conducting an enterprise's affairs
through racketeering. The passage does not mention subsection (d).

Extract
In relevant part, Section 1962(a) provides: (a) It shall be unlawful for any
person who has received any income derived, directly or indirectly, from a
pattern of racketeering activity or through collection of an unlawful debt ...
to use or invest, directly or indirectly, any part of such income in acquisition
of any interest in, or the establishment or operation of, any enterprise which
is engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign
commerce.... 18 U.S.C. § 1962(a). Section 1962(c) provides as follows: (c) It
shall be unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any
enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign
commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of
such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering or collection of
unlawful debt. 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). Section 1962(d) states that 'it shall be
unlawful for any person to conspire to violate any of the provisions of
subsections (a), (b), or (c) of this section.' 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d).
Summary
Direct explanation of subsections (a), (c), and (d) of the RICO statute,
detailing the unlawful activities each subsection addresses. Section 1962(a)
focuses on the use or investment of income derived from racketeering,
Section 1962(c) addresses the conduct or participation in an enterprise's
affairs through racketeering, and Section 1962(d) pertains to conspiracy to
violate the other subsections. The passage does not mention subsection (b),
so it does not provide a complete answer to the question.
100 Mount Holly Bypass v. Axos Bank, Case No. 2:20-CV-856-TS-CMR (D.
Utah Jul 27, 2021)
U.S. District Court — District of Utah
Extract
Section (a) concerns venue, allowing an action to 'be brought in a district
court where personal jurisdiction based on minimum contacts is established
as to at least one defendant.' Section (b) then authorizes nationwide
jurisdiction over other defendants in that district when 'the ends of justice
require' it. The 'ends of justice' has no precise definition; it is 'a flexible
concept uniquely tailored to the facts of each case' and must be analyzed in
light of RICO's purpose of eradicating organized crime. ... To prove a RICO
conspiracy under § 1962(d), ''it suffices that [a defendant] adopt the goal of
furthering or facilitating the criminal endeavor,' so long as that endeavor
would, 'if completed,. .. satisfy all the elements of a substantive criminal
offense.'

established. Section (b) extends jurisdiction to other defendants when
necessary for justice. Section (d) pertains to conspiracy, requiring only the
adoption of a criminal endeavor's goal. The passage does not provide
information about subsection (c).
Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy
The Brief - American Bar Association - 2024-01-01
Extract
A violation of § 1962(c), the section on which Sedima relies, requires (1)
conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity. The plaintiff must allege each of the elements to state a claim. They
are all equally essential components, and the complaint will fail if any one of
them is not adequately pleaded. In particular, RICO claims based on mail or
wire fraud must comport with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b)’s
requirement that allegations involving fraud be pleaded with particularity.
The practitioner through their pleadings must articulate with great care and
attention a viable racketeering claim. In addition, § 1962(a), (b), and (c) are
limited in scope to conduct involving enterprises engaged in or the activities
of which affect interstate commerce. It is the activities of the enterprise, not
each predicate act, that must affect interstate or foreign commerce. RICO
requires no more than a slight effect upon interstate commerce.
Summary
The passage provides insight into the requirements for a RICO claim under §
1962(c), emphasizing the need for conduct of an enterprise through a
pattern of racketeering activity. It also notes that § 1962(a), (b), and (c) are
limited to conduct involving enterprises affecting interstate commerce. This
suggests that while § 1962(c) is focused on the conduct of an enterprise
through racketeering, § 1962(a) and (b) may address different aspects of
enterprise involvement in racketeering, though the passage does not specify
these differences. The passage does not mention § 1962(d).
RICO: A Primer
Extract
There are four separate and distinct RICO violations set out in section 1962:
(a) acquiring or operating an enterprise using racketeering proceeds; (b)
controlling an enterprise using racketeering activities; (c) conducting the

=== PAGE 15 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
affairs of an enterprise using racketeering activities; and (d) conspiring to so
acquire, control, or conduct. Each of the subsections incorporates the basic
elements of 'enterprise' and a 'pattern of racketeering activity.' Section
1962(a) Under Section 1962(a), it is violation to invest the proceeds of
racketeering activity in an enterprise that affects interstate commerce. ...
Section 1962(b) is the least used of the four RICO subsections. Under
section 1962(b), it is a violation to acquire or maintain an interest in an
enterprise affecting interstate or foreign commerce through a pattern of
racketeering activity or collection of an unlawful debt. To prove a violation
of Section 1962(b), a plaintiff must prove the following elements: * Existence
of an enterprise; * The enterprise engaged in, or its activities affected,
interstate or foreign commerce; * The defendant acquired or maintained,
directly or indirectly, an interest in or control of the enterprise; and * The
defendant acquired or maintained the interest through a pattern of
racketeering activity or through collection of an unlawful debt. Courts have
held that a plaintiff must allege a specific nexus between control of the
named enterprise and the alleged racketeering activity. Section 1962(c)
Subsection (c) is, far and away, the most often used and important
substantive RICO provision. Under section 1962(c), it is a violation to
conduct the affairs of an enterprise affecting interstate or foreign commerce
'through' a pattern of racketeering activity or through the alternative theory
of collection of an unlawful debt. To prove a violation of Section 1962(c), a
plaintiff must prove the following elements: * Existence of an enterprise; *
The enterprise engaged in, or its activities affected, interstate or foreign
commerce; * The defendant was employed by or was associated with the
enterprise; * The defendant conducted or participated, either directly or
indirectly, in the conduct of the affairs of the enterprise; and * The
defendant participated in the affairs of the enterprise through a pattern of
racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt. Section 1962(d) Under
Section 1962(d), it is a violation to conspire to commit any of the three
substantive RICO offenses. To prove a violation of Section 1962(d), a plaintiff
must prove the following elements: * The existence of an enterprise (or that
an enterprise would exist); * That the enterprise was (or would be) engaged
in, or its activities affected (or would affect), interstate or foreign commerce;
and * That each defendant knowingly agreed that a conspirator would
commit a violation of 18 U.S.C. ' 1962(c). The Supreme Court held that to
establish a RICO conspiracy offense under Section 1962(d), there is no
requirement that the defendant 'himself committed or agreed to commit the
two predicate acts requisite for a substantive RICO offense under ' 1962(c).
Summary
Detailed explanation of the four subsections of section 1962 of the RICO
statute. Each subsection addresses a different aspect of racketeering
activity: (a) involves investing racketeering proceeds in an enterprise; (b)
involves acquiring or maintaining control of an enterprise through
racketeering; (c) involves conducting the affairs of an enterprise through
racketeering; and (d) involves conspiring to commit any of the
aforementioned activities. The passage also outlines the elements required
to prove violations under each subsection, highlighting the distinct nature of
each.
