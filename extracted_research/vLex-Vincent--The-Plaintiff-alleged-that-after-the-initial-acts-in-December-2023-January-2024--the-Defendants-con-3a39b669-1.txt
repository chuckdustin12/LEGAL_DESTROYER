Question
The Plaintiff alleged that after the initial acts in December 2023–January
2024, the Defendants continued to engage in threatening and intimidating
communications, and ongoing coordination, through at least May 2025.
Open-ended continuity can be established by showing that the racketeering
acts “involve a distinct threat of long-term racketeering activity, either
implicit or explicit.” (H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 242; Johnson v. Heath, 56 F.4th at
859-60). The judge found that the later communications and threats were
“distinct in character from the initial alleged scheme and do not evidence
criminal conduct.” However, the Plaintiff’s complaint alleges that these
communications were “in direct furtherance of their fraudulent scheme to
see the divorce through to its finalization” (Complaint ¶ 49), and that they
“demonstrate the enterprise’s ongoing criminal intent and explicit threats of
future retaliation against Plaintiff for his efforts to expose and seek relief
from their criminal activities.” (Complaint ¶ 51). By dismissing these
allegations as unrelated or non-criminal, the judge failed to credit the
Plaintiff’s theory that the scheme was ongoing and that the threats and
communications were part of the same racketeering activity, thus plausibly
alleging open-ended continuity. 
Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
The Plaintiff’s allegations of ongoing threatening communications and
coordination plausibly allege open-ended continuity under RICO, as
established by Supreme Court and circuit precedent, and the judge’s
dismissal for lack of criminality or connection to the original scheme
appears inconsistent with the governing legal standards. The Plaintiff’s
theory that these acts were in furtherance of a continuing fraudulent
scheme and posed a threat of future racketeering activity should have been
credited at the pleading stage.
Summary
The legal standard for open-ended continuity under RICO requires that the
alleged racketeering acts either explicitly or implicitly threaten long-term
criminal activity, and this can be satisfied by showing that the acts are part
of an ongoing scheme or pose a risk of future repetition. The Plaintiff’s
complaint, which alleges that the Defendants’ continued threats and
coordination were in direct furtherance of a fraudulent scheme and included
explicit threats of future retaliation, aligns with the requirements for open-
ended continuity as articulated by the Supreme Court and multiple federal
appellate courts.
The judge’s finding that the later communications were “distinct in
character” and not criminal overlooks the Plaintiff’s allegations that these

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
acts were part of the same enterprise and furthered the original scheme.
Under the relevant authorities, courts must consider whether the facts as
pleaded plausibly allege a threat of continued racketeering activity, and the
Plaintiff’s theory that the scheme was ongoing and the threats were part of
the same racketeering activity is well-supported by the case law.
Background and Relevant Law
Statutory Framework
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C.
§§ 1961–1968, requires a plaintiff to plead and prove a “pattern of
racketeering activity.” This pattern must consist of at least two predicate
acts of racketeering within ten years, but the Supreme Court has clarified
that two acts alone are not necessarily sufficient; the acts must be related
and must amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity, which is
the “continuity” requirement (Inc v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Company,
492 U.S. 229, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989)).
Continuity can be established in two ways: (1) closed-ended continuity,
which involves a series of related predicate acts extending over a substantial
period of time, or (2) open-ended continuity, which involves past conduct
that by its nature projects into the future with a threat of repetition (Inc v.
Northwestern Bell Telephone Company, 492 U.S. 229 (1989); Johnson v.
Heath, 56 F.4th 851 (10th Cir. 2022)).
Case Law
The Supreme Court in Inc v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Company, 492
U.S. 229 (1989) (H.J. Inc.) established that open-ended continuity may be
shown if the predicate acts themselves involve a distinct threat of long-term
racketeering activity, are part of the regular way of conducting business for
an ongoing entity, or are a regular means of conducting or participating in
an ongoing RICO enterprise. The Court emphasized that continuity is
centrally a temporal concept, but that a threat of future criminal conduct
can suffice even if the acts occurred over a short period.
Subsequent federal appellate and district court decisions have consistently
applied and elaborated on this standard. For example, the Tenth Circuit in 
Johnson v. Heath, 56 F.4th 851 (10th Cir. 2022) reiterated that open-ended
continuity can be established by showing that the racketeering acts involved
implicit or explicit threats of repetition, formed the operations of an
association for criminal purposes, or were the regular way of conducting a
legitimate enterprise. The Fourth Circuit in US Airline Pilots Ass'n v.
Awappa, LLC, 615 F.3d 312 (4th Cir. 2010) and the Seventh Circuit in 
Menzies v. Seyfarth Shaw LLP, 943 F.3d 328 (7th Cir. 2019) have similarly
held that the focus for open-ended continuity is on whether there is a
concrete threat that the conduct will continue into the future.
Courts have also made clear that the determination of continuity is fact-
specific and must be made on a case-by-case basis, considering the nature of

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
the acts, their relationship to each other, and whether they pose a threat of
continued criminal activity (US Airline Pilots Ass'n v. Awappa, LLC, 615 F.3d
312 (4th Cir. 2010); Chen v. Mayflower Transit, Inc., 159 F.Supp.2d 1103
(N.D. Ill. 2001)).
Secondary materials and treatises reinforce these principles, emphasizing
that open-ended continuity can be established by a threat of continuing
criminal activity extending indefinitely into the future, and that the existence
of such a threat is a function of the particular facts of each case (see, e.g., 
RICO: A Primer; Racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations).
Analysis
The Plaintiff’s Allegations and the Standard for Open-
Ended Continuity
The Plaintiff alleges that after the initial acts in December 2023–January
2024, the Defendants continued to engage in threatening and intimidating
communications and ongoing coordination through at least May 2025. The
complaint specifically asserts that these communications were in direct
furtherance of the fraudulent scheme to see the divorce through to its
finalization and that they demonstrated the enterprise’s ongoing criminal
intent and explicit threats of future retaliation.
Under the Supreme Court’s standard in Inc v. Northwestern Bell Telephone
Company, 492 U.S. 229 (1989), these allegations, if true, are sufficient to
plead open-ended continuity. The Court held that continuity may be
established by showing that the predicate acts themselves involve a distinct
threat of long-term racketeering activity, or that they are part of the regular
way of conducting business for an ongoing entity. The Plaintiff’s allegations
that the threats and communications were part of an ongoing scheme and
included explicit threats of future retaliation directly address this standard.
The Tenth Circuit in Johnson v. Heath, 56 F.4th 851 (10th Cir. 2022) further
clarifies that open-ended continuity can be established by showing that the
racketeering acts involved implicit or explicit threats of repetition, or that
they formed the operations of an association that exists for criminal
purposes. The Plaintiff’s complaint alleges both explicit threats of future
retaliation and ongoing coordination, which, if credited, would support a
finding of open-ended continuity.
Similarly, the Fourth Circuit in US Airline Pilots Ass'n v. Awappa, LLC, 615 F.
3d 312 (4th Cir. 2010) and the Seventh Circuit in Menzies v. Seyfarth Shaw
LLP, 943 F.3d 328 (7th Cir. 2019) have held that the focus for open-ended
continuity is on whether there is a concrete threat that the conduct will
continue into the future. The Plaintiff’s allegations of ongoing threats and
coordination, in furtherance of the same fraudulent scheme, plausibly allege
such a threat.

The Judge’s Dismissal and the Requirement to Credit the
Plaintiff’s Theory
The judge dismissed the later communications and threats as “distinct in
character from the initial alleged scheme and do not evidence criminal
conduct.” However, at the pleading stage, courts are required to accept the
Plaintiff’s factual allegations as true and draw all reasonable inferences in
the Plaintiff’s favor. The Plaintiff’s theory is that the later acts were not
isolated or unrelated, but were in direct furtherance of the original
fraudulent scheme and demonstrated ongoing criminal intent.
The Supreme Court and lower courts have repeatedly emphasized that the
continuity requirement is satisfied if the facts as pleaded plausibly allege a
threat of continued racketeering activity, and that the determination is fact-
specific (Inc v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Company, 492 U.S. 229 (1989); 
US Airline Pilots Ass'n v. Awappa, LLC, 615 F.3d 312 (4th Cir. 2010)). The
judge’s failure to credit the Plaintiff’s theory that the scheme was ongoing
and that the threats and communications were part of the same
racketeering activity is inconsistent with this standard.
Moreover, the requirement that the acts be “related” is satisfied if they have
the same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of
commission, or are otherwise interrelated by distinguishing characteristics
and are not isolated events (Inc v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Company,
492 U.S. 229 (1989); Bank of America Nat. Trust & Sav. Ass'n v. Touche Ross
& Co., 782 F.2d 966 (11th Cir. 1986), abrogated on other grounds by Reves
v. Ernst & Young, 507 U.S. 170 (1993)). The Plaintiff’s allegations that the
later acts were in furtherance of the same fraudulent scheme and involved
the same participants and victim support the relatedness requirement.
Case-by-Case Analysis and the Threat of Continued
Racketeering Activity
The authorities uniformly hold that whether the predicates establish a threat
of continued racketeering activity depends on the specific facts of each case
(US Airline Pilots Ass'n v. Awappa, LLC, 615 F.3d 312 (4th Cir. 2010); Chen v.
Mayflower Transit, Inc., 159 F.Supp.2d 1103 (N.D. Ill. 2001)). The Plaintiff’s
allegations of ongoing threats and coordination, in furtherance of a scheme
that had not yet reached its objective (the finalization of the divorce), and
explicit threats of future retaliation, are precisely the type of facts that
courts have found sufficient to plead open-ended continuity.
Secondary materials reinforce that open-ended continuity can be established
by a threat of continuing criminal activity extending indefinitely into the
future, and that the existence of such a threat is a function of the particular
facts of each case (RICO: A Primer; Racketeer influenced and corrupt
organizations). The Plaintiff’s allegations fit squarely within this framework.

Authorities with Subsequent Negative Treatment
Some authorities cited in the tables have been subject to subsequent
negative treatment. For example, Jackson v. Segwick Claims Mgmt. Servs.,
Inc., 699 F.3d 466 (6th Cir. 2013) was vacated by a later district court
decision, and Tabas v. Tabas, 47 F.3d 1280 (3rd Cir. 1995) was declined to
extend by a later Third Circuit case. However, the core principles regarding
open-ended continuity as articulated in these cases are consistent with the
Supreme Court’s decision in Inc v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Company,
492 U.S. 229 (1989), which remains controlling authority. The negative
treatment of these cases does not undermine the general principles they
articulate regarding open-ended continuity, but care should be taken not to
rely on them for any broader propositions beyond those established by the
Supreme Court.
Similarly, Bank of America Nat. Trust & Sav. Ass'n v. Touche Ross & Co., 782
F.2d 966 (11th Cir. 1986) was abrogated by Reves v. Ernst & Young, 507 U.S.
170 (1993) on the issue of the RICO “operation or management” test, but its
discussion of the pattern and continuity requirements remains consistent
with the Supreme Court’s later articulation in H.J. Inc.
Exceptions and Caveats
While the Plaintiff’s allegations are sufficient to plead open-ended continuity,
the ultimate determination of whether the acts constitute criminal conduct
under RICO will depend on the specific facts and evidence developed in
discovery. Courts have cautioned that predicate acts extending over only a
few weeks or months and threatening no future criminal conduct do not
satisfy the continuity requirement (Inc v. Northwestern Bell Telephone
Company, 492 U.S. 229 (1989); Menasco, Inc. v. Wasserman, 886 F.2d 681
(4th Cir. 1989)). However, where, as here, the Plaintiff alleges ongoing acts
over a period of more than a year and a half, in furtherance of a scheme that
has not yet reached its objective, and explicit threats of future retaliation,
these concerns are not present.
It is also important to note that the continuity requirement is not satisfied by
isolated or sporadic acts that do not pose a threat of future criminal
conduct. The Plaintiff must ultimately prove that the acts were related and
posed a threat of continued racketeering activity, but at the pleading stage,
the allegations as described are sufficient.
Conclusion
In summary, the Plaintiff’s allegations of ongoing threatening
communications and coordination, in furtherance of a fraudulent scheme
and including explicit threats of future retaliation, plausibly allege open-
ended continuity under RICO as articulated by the Supreme Court and
federal appellate courts. The judge’s dismissal of these allegations as
unrelated or non-criminal failed to credit the Plaintiff’s theory that the
scheme was ongoing and that the threats and communications were part of
the same racketeering activity. The relevant authorities require a case-by-

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
case analysis, and the Plaintiff’s allegations, if true, are sufficient to survive
a motion to dismiss on the issue of open-ended continuity. The Plaintiff’s
theory is well-supported by the governing legal standards, and the case
should proceed to discovery to determine whether the facts ultimately
support a finding of a pattern of racketeering activity.
Legal Authorities
HJ INC. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co., 653 F. Supp. 908 (D. Minn.
1987)
U.S. District Court — District of Minnesota
Extract
A number of courts, most notably the United States Court of Appeals for the
Eleventh Circuit in Bank of America National Trust & Savings Association v.
Touche Ross & Co., 782 F.2d 966 (11th Cir.1986), have attempted to steer a
middle ground, holding that a single fraudulent scheme which encompasses
various predicate acts over a significant period of time satisfies the pattern
requirement. ... Under this approach, it is not necessary to allege multiple
criminal schemes, provided that plaintiff alleges an 'open-ended scheme'
over an extended period of time evincing criminal activity which is
continuous in nature rather than isolated.
Summary
Concept of continuity in the context of RICO cases, specifically addressing
the idea that a single fraudulent scheme with various predicate acts over a
significant period can satisfy the pattern requirement. This aligns with the
proposition that the Plaintiff's allegations of ongoing threatening
communications and coordination could demonstrate open-ended continuity,
as they suggest a continuous scheme rather than isolated acts.

Continuity can be either closed or open ended. Id. at 241, 109 S.Ct. 2893.
Closed-ended continuity is a closed period of repeated racketeering conduct,
while open-ended continuity consists of racketeering conduct that threatens
future repetition. Id. Plaintiffs can establish open-ended continuity by
showing that the racketeering acts involved implicit or explicit threats of
repetition, that they formed the operations of an association that exists for

Summary
The concept of open-ended continuity in racketeering cases can be
established by demonstrating that the acts involved implicit or explicit
threats of future repetition. This aligns with the Plaintiff's allegations that
the Defendants' actions were part of an ongoing scheme with threats of
future retaliation, thus supporting the proposition that the scheme was
ongoing and part of the same racketeering activity.
Corley v. Rosewood Care Center, Inc., 142 F.3d 1041, 1998 WL 206367 (7th
Cir. 1998)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Seventh Circuit
Extract
Open-ended continuity, by contrast, may involve predicate acts occurring
over a short period of time so long as there is a threat that the conduct will
recur in the future. H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 241, 109 S.Ct. at 2902 ('open-ended
continuity' refers to 'past conduct that by its nature projects into the future
with a threat of repetition'); see also Midwest Grinding, 976 F.2d at 1023.
Such a threat is present when: '(1) 'a specific threat of repetition' exists, (2)
'the predicates are a regular way of conducting [an] ongoing legitimate
business,' or (3) 'the predicates can be attributed to a defendant operating
as part of a long-term association that exists for criminal purposes.'
Summary
Open-ended continuity in RICO cases can be established by demonstrating a
threat of future criminal conduct. The passage outlines that this can be
shown through a specific threat of repetition, regular conduct of business in
a fraudulent manner, or actions as part of a long-term criminal association.
This aligns with the Plaintiff's allegations that the Defendants' actions were
part of an ongoing scheme with threats of future retaliation, thus supporting
the proposition of open-ended continuity.

The plaintiffs have also sufficiently pleaded open-ended continuity. Open-
ended continuity is “established if the related predicates themselves involve
a distinct threat of long-term racketeering activity, either implicit or
explicit.” H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 242, 109 S.Ct. 2893. Continuity may be shown
where “ ‘the predicates are a regular way of conducting defendant's ongoing

legitimate business.’ ” Brown I, 546 F.3d at 354 (quoting H.J. Inc., 492 U.S.
at 243, 109 S.Ct. 2893).
Summary
The concept of open-ended continuity in racketeering cases can be
established if the predicate acts involve a distinct threat of long-term
racketeering activity, either implicit or explicit. This aligns with the
Plaintiff's argument that the ongoing communications and threats were part
of a continuous scheme, thus supporting the proposition that the judge may
have erred in dismissing these allegations as unrelated or non-criminal.

U.S. Court of Appeals — Seventh Circuit
Extract
The alternative continuity inquiry—applicable to an 'open-ended' series of
misconduct—focuses not on what acts occurred in the past but on whether a
concrete threat remains for the conduct to continue moving forward. ... This
can be done by showing that a defendant’s actions pose a specific threat of
repetition; that the predicate acts form part of the defendant’s ongoing and
regular way of doing business; or that the defendant operates a long-term
association for criminal purposes.
Summary
The concept of open-ended continuity in RICO cases involves assessing
whether there is a concrete threat of ongoing misconduct. This can be
demonstrated by showing that the defendant's actions pose a specific threat
of repetition or are part of their regular way of doing business. The passage
supports the proposition by emphasizing that the continuity inquiry is
forward-looking and focuses on the threat of future misconduct, which
aligns with the Plaintiff's allegations of ongoing threats and coordination by
the Defendants.

Moreover, even if we were not to have found that conduct lasting three and
one-half years was sufficient to establish closed-ended continuity, we
conclude that continuity still would have been established for the purposes
of summary judgment in the present case under an 'open-ended' continuity
analysis. Under H.J. Inc., if a RICO action is brought before a plaintiff can

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
establish long-term criminal conduct, the 'continuity' prong may still be met
if a plaintiff can prove a threat of continued racketeering activity. Whether
the predicate acts constitute a threat of continued racketeering activity
depends on 'the specific facts of each case,' id. at 242, 109 S.Ct. at 2902, but
H.J. Inc. suggests that open-ended continuity may be satisfied 'where it is
shown that the predicates are a regular way of conducting defendant's
ongoing legitimate business ... or of conducting or participating in an
ongoing and legitimate RICO 'enterprise.'
Summary
The concept of open-ended continuity under RICO can be established if
there is a threat of continued racketeering activity. This can be shown if the
predicate acts are a regular way of conducting the defendant's business or
participating in an ongoing enterprise. The passage supports the proposition
by indicating that the Plaintiff's allegations of ongoing threats and
communications could demonstrate a threat of continued racketeering
activity, thus satisfying the open-ended continuity requirement.
Rini v. Zwirn, 886 F.Supp. 270 (E.D. N.Y. 1995)
U.S. District Court — Eastern District of New York
Extract
The Court in H.J. Inc. explained that the continuity requirement can be met
where the predicate acts establish either explicitly, 'a specific threat of
repetition extending indefinitely into the future,' or implicitly, by 'showing
that the predicate acts or offenses are part of an ongoing entity's regular
way of doing business.' H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 242-43, 109 S.Ct. at 2902.
Summary
The passage from "Rini v. Zwirn" references the Supreme Court's
interpretation in H.J. Inc., which clarifies that open-ended continuity in RICO
cases can be established by showing a specific threat of repetition or that
the acts are part of an ongoing business practice. This directly supports the
proposition that the Plaintiff's allegations of ongoing threats and
communications could demonstrate open-ended continuity if they suggest a
threat of long-term racketeering activity.

The Supreme Court recently visited RICO's pattern requirement. H.J. Inc. v.
Northwestern Bell Telephone Co., --- U.S. ----, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106 L.Ed.2d
195 (1989). The H.J. Inc. Court reaffirmed that 'to prove a pattern of
racketeering activity a plaintiff ... must show that the racketeering
predicates are related, and that they amount to or pose a threat of continued
criminal activity.' Id. 109 S.Ct. at 2900 (emphasis in original). Predicate acts
are related if they have 'the same or similar purposes, results, participants,
victims, or methods of commission, or otherwise are interrelated by
distinguishing characteristics and are not isolated events.' Id. at 2901,
quoting 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3575(e). Continuity, in turn, refers 'either to a closed
period of repeated conduct, or to past conduct that by its nature projects
into the future with a threat of repetition.' Id. at 2902 (emphasis added). To
satisfy the continuity element, a plaintiff must show that 'the predicates
themselves amount to, or ... otherwise constitute a threat of, continuing
racketeering activity.' Id. at 2901 (emphasis in original). Significantly,
'[p]redicate acts extending over a few weeks or months and threatening no
future criminal conduct do not satisfy this requirement: Congress was
concerned in RICO with long-term criminal conduct.' Id. at 2902. See also
id. (continuity requires activity over a 'substantial period of time'); id. at n. 4
(continuity requires 'long-term criminal activity'). Thus, predicate acts must
be part of a prolonged criminal endeavor.
Summary
The Supreme Court's interpretation in H.J. Inc. provides a framework for
establishing a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO. The passage
emphasizes the need for related predicate acts that pose a threat of
continued criminal activity, which aligns with the Plaintiff's allegations of
ongoing threats and communications as part of a continuous scheme. The
passage supports the idea that continuity can be established by
demonstrating a threat of long-term racketeering activity, which is central to
the Plaintiff's argument.

U.S. District Court — Eastern District of Pennsylvania
Extract
To plead a 'pattern of racketeering activity,' a plaintiff must aver not only
that the defendant committed at least two acts of prohibited racketeering
activity but also that the predicate acts are related and that they amount to
or pose a threat of continued criminal activity. H.J., Inc. v. Northwestern Bell

or to past conduct that by its nature projects into the future with a threat of
repetition. H.J., Inc., 492 U.S. at 241-242, 109 S.Ct. at 2902.
Summary
To establish a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO, a plaintiff must
demonstrate that the predicate acts are related and pose a threat of
continued criminal activity. The concept of continuity can be open-ended,
meaning that past conduct can project into the future with a threat of
repetition. This supports the proposition that the Plaintiff's allegations of
ongoing threats and communications could be part of a continuous
racketeering activity, as they may demonstrate a threat of continued
criminal conduct.

U.S. District Court — Southern District of New York
Extract
The Supreme Court has recognized, however, that 'often a RICO action will
be brought before continuity can be established in this way. In such cases,
liability depends on whether the threat of continuity is demonstrated.' H.J.
Inc., supra, 492 U.S. at 242, 109 S.Ct. at 2902 (emphasis in original).
Whether the predicate acts alleged establish a threat of continued
racketeering activity depends on the specific facts of each case. Such a
threat may be shown, for example, where the related predicate acts
themselves involve a clear threat of long-term racketeering activity, or
where the predicate acts are part of an ongoing entity's regular method of
doing business. See H.J. Inc., supra, 492 U.S. at 242, 109 S.Ct. at 2902.
Summary
The Supreme Court has clarified that establishing a pattern of racketeering
activity under RICO can involve demonstrating a threat of continuity. This
can be shown through predicate acts that pose a clear threat of long-term
racketeering activity. The passage supports the proposition by indicating
that the Plaintiff's allegations of ongoing threats and communications could
demonstrate such a threat, thus supporting the claim of open-ended
continuity.

Extract
To state a claim under Section 1962(c), Plaintiff must also allege a pattern of
racketeering activity, which is defined as “at least two acts of racketeering
activity ... within ten years ... after the commission of a prior act of
racketeering activity.” ... In H.J., Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., the
Supreme Court clarified the pattern requirement as one that requires
continuity, which may be either closed- or open-ended. ... open-ended
continuity refers to “past conduct that by its nature projects into the future
with a threat of repetition.” ... To allege open-ended continuity, Plaintiff must
allege “a threat of continued racketeering activity.”
Summary
To establish a RICO claim under Section 1962(c), a plaintiff must
demonstrate a pattern of racketeering activity, which can be shown through
either closed- or open-ended continuity. Open-ended continuity involves
demonstrating a threat of continued racketeering activity, which aligns with
the Plaintiff's allegations of ongoing threats and communications in
furtherance of a fraudulent scheme. The passage supports the proposition
by explaining the legal standard for open-ended continuity, which the
Plaintiff is attempting to establish.

To demonstrate a pattern of such activity, the plaintiff must show “continuity
plus relationship,” i.e., “that the racketeering predicates are related, and
that they amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity.” H.J. Inc.,
492 U.S. at 239, 109 S.Ct. 2893 (emphasis and internal quotation marks

Summary
To establish a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO, a plaintiff must
demonstrate both continuity and relationship among the predicate acts. The
concept of continuity can be either closed-ended or open-ended. Open-ended
continuity involves showing a threat of continued criminal activity that

projects into the future. The passage supports the proposition by explaining
that open-ended continuity can be established by demonstrating a threat of
continuity, which aligns with the Plaintiff's allegations of ongoing threats
and communications as part of the same racketeering activity.

U.S. District Court — Northern District of Illinois
Extract
The pattern requirement means that in addition to at least two predicate
acts, a RICO plaintiff must show `that the racketeering predicates are
related, and that they amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal
activity.' ... Continuity, the Court observed, is both a closed- and open-ended
concept, in that it refers 'either to a closed period of repeated conduct or to
past conduct that by its nature projects into the future with a threat of
repetition.'
Summary
The passage from "Chen v. Mayflower Transit, Inc." discusses the
requirements for establishing a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO,
specifically the need to show that the racketeering predicates are related
and pose a threat of continued criminal activity. It also explains the concept
of continuity, which can be either closed-ended or open-ended, with open-
ended continuity involving conduct that projects into the future with a threat
of repetition. This directly supports the proposition that the Plaintiff's
allegations of ongoing threats and communications could establish open-
ended continuity by demonstrating a threat of long-term racketeering
activity.

Summary
The concept of continuity in RICO cases can be either closed-ended or open-
ended. Open-ended continuity involves demonstrating a threat of ongoing
racketeering activity, which aligns with the Plaintiff's allegations of
continued threats and communications as part of a fraudulent scheme. The
passage supports the idea that the Plaintiff's allegations could establish
open-ended continuity by showing a threat of future racketeering activity.
In re Phillips Petroleum Securities Litigation, 738 F.Supp. 825 (D. Del. 1990)
U.S. District Court — District of Delaware
Extract
Recently, in H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co., ___ U.S. ___, 109
S.Ct. 2893, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989) (citing Barticheck v. Fidelity Union
Bank/First National State, 832 F.2d 36 (3d Cir.1987)), the Supreme Court
interpreted RICO's pattern requirement. The H.J. Inc. Court reaffirmed that
in order 'to prove a pattern of racketeering activity a plaintiff ... must show
that the racketeering predicates are related, and that they amount to or
pose a threat of continued criminal activity.' Id. 109 S.Ct. at 2900 (emphasis
in original). Predicate acts are related if they have '`the same or similar
purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of commission, or
otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not
isolated events.' Id. at 2901, quoting 18 U.S.C. § 3575(e). Continuity refers
'either to a closed period of repeated conduct, or to past conduct that by its
nature projects into the future with a threat of repetition.' Id. at 2902. To
satisfy the continuity element, a plaintiff must show that 'the predicates
themselves amount to, or ... otherwise constitute a threat of, continuing
racketeering activity.' Id. at 2901 (emphasis in original). 'Predicate acts
extending over a few weeks or months and threatening no future criminal
conduct do not satisfy this requirement: Congress was concerned in RICO
with long-term criminal conduct.' Id. at 2902.
Summary
The Supreme Court in H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co. clarified
the requirements for establishing a pattern of racketeering activity under
RICO. The passage emphasizes that the predicate acts must be related and
pose a threat of continued criminal activity, which aligns with the Plaintiff's
allegations of ongoing threats and communications as part of a continuous
scheme. The passage also highlights the importance of demonstrating
continuity, either through a closed period of repeated conduct or past
conduct projecting future threats, which supports the Plaintiff's argument of
open-ended continuity.

Extract
"As indicated, a pattern of racketeering activity involves continued criminal
activity. H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 239. The Fourth Circuit has adopted a 'flexible'
approach to the 'continuity' requirement. Brandenburg v. Seidel, 859 F.2d
1179, 1185 (4th Cir. 1989), overruled on other grounds by Quackenbush v.
Allstate Ins. Co., 517 U.S. 706 (1996). Courts utilize a 'case-by-case analysis,
Capital Lighting and Supply, LLC v. Wirtz, JKB-17-3765, 2018 WL 3970469,

degree' of the alleged misconduct.' 'Continuity' is both a closed - and open-
ended concept, referring either to a closed period of repeated conduct, or to
past conduct that by its nature projects into the future with a threat of
repetition." H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 241.
Summary
The concept of "continuity" in RICO cases can be both closed and open-
ended. The passage emphasizes that continuity can refer to past conduct
that projects into the future with a threat of repetition, which aligns with the
Plaintiff's argument that the Defendants' actions were part of an ongoing
scheme. The Fourth Circuit's flexible approach to continuity supports the
idea that the Plaintiff's allegations of ongoing threats and communications
could be seen as part of a continuous racketeering activity.

Defendants also contend that the banks failed to allege the existence of a
pattern of racketeering activity. Although Sec. 1961(5) merely requires 'at
least two acts of racketeering activity' in order to establish a pattern, the
Supreme Court has indicated that two acts may not be sufficient. In Sedima
the Court reviewed the legislative history of RICO and stated that two
isolated acts of racketeering activity do not constitute a pattern; rather, to
establish a pattern there must be a showing of more than one racketeering
activity and the threat of continuing activity. As an aid in interpreting RICO's
pattern requirement, the Court quoted from 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3575(e):
'criminal conduct forms a pattern if it embraces criminal acts that have the
same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of
commission, or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics
and are not isolated events.'

Summary
The passage discusses the requirements for establishing a pattern of
racketeering activity under RICO. It emphasizes that a pattern requires
more than just two isolated acts; there must be a threat of continuing
activity, and the acts must be interrelated by distinguishing characteristics.
This supports the proposition that the Plaintiff's allegations of ongoing
threats and communications could establish a pattern of racketeering
activity if they demonstrate a threat of long-term activity and are related to
the initial scheme.
Inc v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Company, 492 U.S. 229, 109 S.Ct. 2893,

U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
Continuity of racketeering activity likewise may be demonstrated in a
variety of ways. Continuity is centrally a temporal concept, and may be
either closed- or open-ended. A party alleging a RICO violation may
demonstrate continuity over a closed period by proving a series of related
predicates extending over a substantial period of time. Otherwise, it must be
shown that the predicates establish a threat of long-term racketeering
activity—for example, because the predicates themselves involve a distinct
threat of such activity; because they are part of the regular way of doing
business for an ongoing entity such as a criminal association or legitimate
business; or because they are a regular means of conducting or participating
in an ongoing RICO enterprise.
Summary
Continuity in racketeering activity can be demonstrated through either
closed or open-ended means. The passage specifically mentions that
continuity can be shown if the predicates establish a threat of long-term
racketeering activity, which aligns with the Plaintiff's argument that the
Defendants' actions involved ongoing threats and coordination. This
supports the proposition that the Plaintiff's allegations of continued
threatening communications and coordination could establish open-ended
continuity under RICO.

analysis. This supports the Plaintiff's argument that the ongoing
communications and threats are part of a continuous racketeering scheme,
as they pose a threat of future criminal conduct.

Extract
The 'continuity' prong is satisfied by proof of either closed-ended continuity
or open-ended continuity. Closed-ended continuity in the RICO context may
be demonstrated 'by proving a series of related predicates extending over a
substantial period of time.' Open-ended continuity in the RICO context is
conduct that may last only a short period of time but nonetheless poses a
threat of extending into the future. The Court suggested a case-by-case
examination of this issue, noting that the existence of a 'threat of continued
racketeering activity' is a function of particular facts.
Summary
The concept of open-ended continuity in RICO cases involves conduct that
poses a threat of extending into the future, even if it lasts only a short period
of time. The passage emphasizes the need for a case-by-case examination to
determine the existence of a threat of continued racketeering activity. This
aligns with the Plaintiff's argument that the Defendants' ongoing
communications and threats were part of a continuous scheme, thus
supporting the proposition that open-ended continuity can be established.

Open-ended continuity, in contrast, requires proof of “a threat of continued
racketeering activity.” Id. at 242. Under H.J. Inc., open-ended continuity may
be established in various ways. The Court furnished some examples. First, a
small number of related predicates occurring close together in time will
establish open-ended continuity if “the racketeering acts themselves include
a specific threat of repetition extending indefinitely into the future, and thus
supply the requisite threat of continuity.” Second, the threat of continuity
may be established with a “showing that the predicate acts or offenses are
part of an ongoing entity’s regular way of doing business.” Third, continuity
is proved “if the predicates can be attributed to a defendant operating as
part of a long‑term association that exists for criminal purposes.” In any
case, the entity involved may be a legitimate business and need not be one
“traditionally grouped under the phrase ‘organized crime.’” Id. at 242–43.

Summary
Open-ended continuity in RICO cases can be established by demonstrating a
threat of continued racketeering activity. This can be shown through a
specific threat of repetition, the predicate acts being part of an ongoing
business practice, or the acts being part of a long-term criminal association.
The Plaintiff's allegations that the communications were in furtherance of a
fraudulent scheme and demonstrated ongoing criminal intent align with the
criteria for open-ended continuity as described in the passage.

involves conduct that poses a threat of extending into the future and that
this determination is based on the particular facts of each case. The passage
references H.J. Inc., which is a key case in understanding the continuity
requirement under RICO. This directly supports the proposition that the
Plaintiff's allegations of ongoing threats and communications could establish
open-ended continuity if they demonstrate a threat of continued
racketeering activity.

Extract
The inquiry here is meant to invoke the 'pattern of racketeering activity'
element of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).
The Organized Crime Control Act (1970), which includes RICO, provides that
'criminal conduct forms a pattern if it embraces criminal acts that have the
same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of
commission, or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics
and are not isolated events.' The Supreme Court characterized this
requirement as a 'relationship' element and held that the statute further
requires a 'continuity' element, 'referring either to a closed period of
repeated conduct, or to past conduct that by its nature projects into the
future with a threat of repetition.'
Summary
The passage explains the "pattern of racketeering activity" under RICO,
emphasizing the need for both a "relationship" and "continuity" element. The
continuity element can be satisfied by showing either a closed period of
repeated conduct or conduct that projects into the future with a threat of
repetition. This directly supports the proposition that the Plaintiff's
allegations of ongoing threats and communications could establish open-
ended continuity under RICO, as they suggest a threat of long-term
racketeering activity.
RICO: A Primer
Extract
A plaintiff may demonstrate a pattern by establishment that the predicate
acts pose a threat of continued criminal activity, which is generally
demonstrated by showing either: * Closed-ended continuity. Proving 'a series
of related predicate acts extending over a substantial period of time.' *
Open-ended continuity. A threat of 'continuing criminal activity extending
indefinitely into the future,' in light of the nature of the enterprise and
predicate acts alleged.
Summary
The concept of open-ended continuity under RICO can be established by
demonstrating a threat of continuing criminal activity extending indefinitely
into the future. This aligns with the Plaintiff's allegations that the
Defendants' actions were part of an ongoing scheme, thus supporting the
argument that the threats and communications were part of the same
racketeering activity.
