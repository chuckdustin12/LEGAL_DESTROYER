Question
I. Introduction Within the last 23 days, four mandamus petitions have been
docketed involving the same parties but identify distinct legal errors made
by the trial courts below. In sum, the respondents include two Associate
Judges, a District Judge, and a Regional Presiding Judge currently presiding
over recusal proceedings. Each of the Respondents, the Real Party, her
counsel, and the Office of the Attorney General were duly notified of all
intentions to initiate these actions, the relief sought, and to date no input
has been provided. The legal errors identified are significant and
multifaceted: (1) an issuance of a void order by rendering a consent
judgment where consent was lacking and in excess statutory authority; (2) a
refusal to hear a properly filed emergency Temporary Restraining Order
(TRO); (3) a swift and improper consolidation of cases without a hearing;
and (4) a failure to adhere to Rule 18a regarding recusal proceedings. These
actions have not only violated procedural norms but have also exacerbated
the legal and personal hardships faced by the petitioner, and consolidation
would serve the interest of judicial efficiency in providing a more wholistic
view of these issues. 2 Amended Statement of Facts Relator, CHARLES
DUSTIN MYERS, is referred to herein as “Father.” Real Party in Interest,
MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS, is referred to herein at “Mother”. Each
record citation marked with (R. X-X) is referencing the concurrently filed
Amended Consolidated Mandamus Record. A. The Precipitating Event and
Background Facts The events giving rise to these proceedings began on
December 12, 2023, when the father discovered a series of text message
exchanges between the mother and two individuals outside the marriage—
identified in the record as Damen Kazlauskas and Debbie Price (R. 253–711).
This discovery occurred shortly after the mother’s abrupt announcement of
her intent to divorce and raised concerns regarding the children’s well-being
and emotional environment. In an effort to address the matter
constructively, the father contacted the mother’s grandfather— who resides
next door to the marital home—via text message to request a family meeting
to discuss the situation (R. 717–720). The following day, however, when
Father confronted Mother with the discovery—presenting his concerns in
the form of data visualizations (R. 255– 257)—she began distancing herself,
starting by redirecting the planned family conversation into a private
meeting solely between herself and her grandparents (R. 1716). On
December 14, 2023, Mother initiated text communication with her 3
stepfather, Dan Branthoover, who resides in Yukon, Oklahoma (R. 274–278).
Mr. Branthoover then contacted Father via text message, stating that he
wanted to help both parties and requested a phone conversation (R. 1703).
That conversation resulted in an arrangement for Mother to travel to Mr.
Branthoover’s residence over the weekend beginning December 15, 2023,
where Mr. Branthoover later acknowledged that he would be assisting with
the divorce paperwork (R. 1710). During this same period, Mother also
sought an ex parte emergency protective order against Father from the
322nd District Court of Tarrant County, as referenced in her divorce petition
(R. 78 at 9B). B. Travel,Influence and Conversion of Marital Assets While en
route to, or upon arrival at, Mr. Branthoover’s residence, Mother withdrew
the entirety of the funds from the joint marital bank account, totaling $1,576

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
(R. 723; 1716–1717). The transaction was facilitated by Mr. Branthoover,
who used his PayPal account—identified as “dmb575” (R. 1707)—as an
intermediary to transfer the funds. This identifier corresponds to the
relevant December 2023 bank statement (R. 1706). Both Mr. Branthoover
and Mother later admitted that the transaction had occurred (R. 1709,
1716). As a result, on December 16, 2023, Father was notified that the joint
account had been overdrawn, which caused the suspension of his business’s
advertising services due to a failed payment (R. 726–727). Father
subsequently contacted Mr. 4 Branthoover in writing to request the return of
the funds, explaining that the money was needed to cover essential family
expenses and to purchase Christmas presents for the children (R. 728–729).
During this exchange, Mr. Branthoover explicitly informed Father that
Mother’s visit was for the purpose of receiving assistance with the
preparation of divorce paperwork (R. 730). C. The Eviction The situation
escalated further on December 17, 2023, when Father was served with an
eviction notice by Mother’s grandmother, Margie Wilson. The notice cited a
protective order and a divorce petition as the basis for eviction, despite
those documents not having been formally filed at the time (R. 735). The
case was later heard by the Honorable Judge Swearingin Jr. and was
dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction (R. 736–737) on January 17,
2024. D. The Divorce Petition On December 18, 2023, Mother formally filed
for divorce (R. 71–81) and requested an “Uncontested Cases” form from the
court (R. 101). In her divorce petition, she claimed that the parties had
stopped living together as spouses on or around December 1, 2023 (R. 74 at
4). She also asserted financial indigence, stating that she had only $21 in
her bank account (R. 91) while being responsible for $1,610 in monthly
expenses (R. 92). Contradicting the timeline established by the eviction
notice served the previous day, the petition further alleged that an 5 active
protective order was already in place against Father, and that a finding of
family violence had been made during the marriage—thereby waiving the
statutory 60-day waiting period (R. 78 at 10). Mother further claimed that
the marital property would be divided by agreement yet designated both
family vehicles as her separate property (R. 79). She requested joint
managing conservatorship (R. 75 at 6D) and sought standard visitation
rights for Father (R. 76 at 6F), while simultaneously alleging that she and
the children could face abuse or serious harm if Father were provided with
her contact information (R. 81 at 15). E. The Protective Order Four days
after filing for divorce, on December 22, 2023, Mother filed an application
for a protective order (R. 103–109). In supporting documents, including an
affidavit (R. 108) and an unsworn declaration, she alleged that family
violence occurred on December 18, 2023—the same day she filed for divorce
(R. 109). However, evidence indicates that on that same day, Mother was
present at the family home with Father, exhibiting no signs of being in a
state of emergency (R. 1692). Mother continued to cohabit with Father
intermittently following these filings, as evidenced by her presence at the
family home on December 29, 2023, participating in a typical evening with
Father and the children (R. 1716). Father 6 was formally served with the
protective order suit on December 27, 2023 (R. 117- 118). Within the
protective order application, Mother requested that Father be prohibited
from approaching within 200 feet of the children’s school, that he cease all
communication with her, and that he complete a battering intervention and
prevention program (R. 105). She acknowledged the joint ownership of the

=== PAGE 3 ===

matrimonial residence but nonetheless requested spousal support, child
support, and Father’s immediate removal from the home (R. 106). Adding
another layer to the situation, the day after the divorce was filed—on
December 19, 2023—Mr. Branthoover contacted Father via text message,
claiming to represent Mother in the legal proceedings (R. 1712). Despite
these filings and allegations, Father continued to cohabit with Mother
leading up to the first scheduled legal proceeding: a show cause hearing set
for January 16, 2024. During this interim period, Father prioritized the
children and spent time with them during their holiday break (R. 826–829).
F.Father Prepares His Defense In response to the series of legal actions
initiated by Mother, Father waited until after the children’s Christmas
holiday to formally begin preparing his defense. He first filed an original
answer to the protective order application, denying all allegations of family
violence (R. 129–133). In his answer, Father raised the 7 affirmative
defenses of fraud, illegality, and duress, asserting that Mother was
attempting to misuse the legal process (R. 131). To support his position,
Father attached two exhibits: the first was a copy of his Texas Department of
Public Safety (TxDPS) record, demonstrating no history of violence (R. 134–
136); the second highlighted inconsistencies within Mother’s divorce
petition (R. 137–140). Subsequently, on January 3, 2024, Father filed a
motion to consolidate the protective order proceedings with the divorce case
(R. 142–145). He also submitted a background report intended to provide
the court with context regarding the children’s familial circumstances (R.
146–148). Father later filed a motion for continuance to obtain legal
representation (R. 149–151), accompanied by additional documentation
related to the family situation (R. 152–155), including text message evidence
from Mr. Branthoover intended to refute Mother’s claim of indigency (R.
161–164). Finally, on January 13, 2024, Father submitted an unsworn
declaration detailing the sequence of events leading up to that point (R.
175–179). G. Setting #1 – Show Cause The first court hearing was scheduled
for January 16, 2024 (R. 117-118). The parties appeared but announced they
were not ready to proceed (R. 180–181). Due to inclement weather
conditions, the Honorable James Munford presided over the matter
temporarily. Judge Munford granted a continuance but also ordered 8 Father
to vacate the family residence effective immediately—without conducting an
evidentiary hearing, making specific findings, or considering Father’s
submitted pleadings. This resulted in a de facto temporary termination of
Father’s custodial rights, and the case was reset for January 22, 2024, to be
heard by the Honorable Jeffrey Kaitcer (R. 182–185). Faced with the sudden
loss of his residence and access to his children, Father sought legal
representation immediately and retained attorney Daniel R. Bacalis on
January 19, 2024—just three days before the rescheduled hearing (R. 818 at
9). Father promptly briefed Mr. Bacalis on the situation, providing insights
into the family dynamics through a comprehensive statement of context (R.
168–174). H. Reset #1 – Show Cause On the rescheduled date of January 22,
2024, the parties appeared at the courthouse for the second setting. Mother
initially appeared without legal counsel but retained attorney Cooper L.
Carter in the courthouse lobby just prior to the hearing. This prompted a
further delay, as the Honorable Judge Kaitcer granted a continuance sua
sponte, resetting the case once more to February 1, 2024 (R. 185– 187). In
the period between settings, both Mr. Bacalis, representing Father, and Mr.
Carter, representing Mother, filed amended pleadings in the divorce

proceedings (R. 188-207, R. 208-219). 9 I. Reset #2 – Show Cause At the
third scheduled setting on February 1, 2024, both parties arrived with their
respective counsel and announced they were ready to proceed. 1 However,
instead of the matter being heard by Honorable Jeffrey Kaitcer, father’s
counsel, Mr. Bacalis, drafted an “Agreed Associate Judge’s Report” which
was presented to father in the hallway outside the courtroom. (R. 228-234).
This proposed agreement included terms to non-suit (dismiss) the protective
order application, grant father residency in the family home only until
March 1, 2024, and outline the division of financial responsibilities (R.
231-232). Father expressed significant reservations and initially refused to
sign the agreed order, stating his desire to proceed to trial to address
mother's allegations directly and hold her accountable, where he was told by
his counsel, “I know the judge, this is the best we can get,” and felt
pressured into signing the agreement as the only presented option, which is
corroborated by father’s witness in an affidavit (R. 1367-1369). Feeling
frustrated by this outcome, father paid particular attention to the procedural
requirements highlighted in bold text within the agreement signed on
February 1, 2024 (R. 233). The Father then realized that if he terminated his
attorney, he wouldn’t be able to prepare the written order and made the
decision to terminate his counsel and represent himself moving forward. 1
No recorded appearance from either party can be found in the record on
this date. 10 J. Father Proceeds Pro Se Shortly after the court setting, Father
terminated the services of his attorney, Dan Bacalis, and notified the court
(R. 220–222). An agreed motion for withdrawal of counsel was subsequently
filed (R. 223–227). On February 8, 2024, the associate judge’s report dated
February 1, 2024, was filed into the record (R. 228-234). Around the same
time, an agreed order of consolidation was entered—consolidating the
protective order suit with the divorce matter—without Father’s knowledge
or signature (R. 235–238). In response, Father prepared an Emergency
Motion to Vacate, which he filed the following day (R. 239–243). The motion
included a supporting brief summarizing the procedural history and
outlining what Father described as Mother’s unlawful campaign against him
(R. 244–252), and sought a de novo hearing on specific issues. The exhibits
accompanying the motion included text message evidence and data
visualizations involving Mother, Damen Kazlauskas, and Debbie Price,
originally discovered on December 12, 2023 (R. 253–714); text messages
between Father and Mother’s grandfather indicating the divorce was
unexpected (R. 715-720); evidence of marital asset conversion between
Mother and Daniel Branthoover (R. 721–723); documentation of the
overdrawn joint bank account and related communications from
Branthoover (R. 724–731); a copy of the eviction notice served by Margie
Wilson, which Mother later tore in half and marked “VOID” (R. 732-735); 11
and the judgment of dismissal in the eviction proceeding, entered on
January 17, 2024—the day after Father was removed from the residence (R.
736-737). A few days later, the court issued the order granting Attorney
Bacalis’s withdrawal (R. 738–741). Father then prepared and filed a Motion
for Partial Summary Judgment, accompanied by a supporting brief (R. 757–
767). He attached a Proposed Parenting Plan as Exhibit D to the motion (R.
768–772) and a proposed order (R. 773–774). No response was ever
provided to these pleadings by the opposing party. K. Events Preceding the
March 14 Hearing On February 22, 2024, the parties received notice that a
hearing on Father’s Emergency Motion was scheduled for March 14, 2024

signed by Hon. James Munford (R. 775-779). Father subsequently filed a
notice stating his intention to remain in the marital residence due to work
requirements and childcare responsibilities (R. 781–785). He then provided
initial disclosures to the parties (R. 786–792) and received no response to
his emergency motion. Two days later, while Father was taking the children
to school, Mother locked him out of the marital residence and left a sign on
the door declaring that “You should have been out by Saturday you are now
locked out.” (R. 1747–1748). To avoid unnecessary conflict, Father
temporarily stayed in Flower Mound, Texas, with his own father while
awaiting the hearing. 12 L. Setting #4 – Emergency Motion to Vacate and
Reconsider Evidence Father appeared for the scheduled hearing on his
Emergency Motion (R. 793).2 Upon entering the courtroom, he was handed
a document titled “Temporary Orders,” which was a modified version of the
February 1, 2024, agreement previously prepared by Father’s former
counsel (R. 887). These orders were prepared by Cooper L. Carter after the
20-day deadline stipulated in the original agreement. No agreement had
been reached, as evidenced by the parties’ presence in court to contest the
matter, and no motion to sign had been set or filed—contrary to the judge’s
prior directive (R. 233) and agreement of the parties. The proposed orders
also claimed that a hearing had been held on February 1, 2024, for
“Mother’s Motion for Temporary Orders,”3 and that all parties were in
agreement with the terms “as evidenced by the signatures below” (R. 888).
In reality, the February 1 setting resulted only in an associate judge’s report,
drafted informally in the hallway by Father’s prior counsel. Despite this, the
proposed order stated that the court “heard evidence and argument”—a
statement Father asserts was inaccurate (R. 888). At that time, the only
other scheduled hearing was on Mother’s Application for Protective Order,
which had been non-suited in the February 1 Associate Judge’s Report after
two delays. Once the hearing began, Father’s Emergency Motion was denied
without 2 No recorded appearance by the Real Party in Interest, Morgan
Michelle Myers, can be found in the record on this date. 3 This document
has never been served to the Relator. 13 explanation, and he was ordered to
sign the very agreement he had appeared in court to contest (R. 794-795).
Notably, the order itself contained two distinct sets of handwriting, was
prepared by the opposing counsel, and Father refused to sign the document
because he did not agree to its terms (R. 795). Notably, Father also refused
to sign the Temporary Orders claiming his consent (R. 925). No order was
ever issued regarding Father’s Emergency Motion to Vacate. Following the
setting, Father began exploring his appellate remedies and drafted a
Preparatory Notice for Judicial Review, which he later amended twice (R.
797–846). The document provided a detailed account of the parties’ family
background (R. 807), employment history, and household dynamics (R. 808–
815). It included a statement of facts segmented into background facts (R.
816–817), procedural facts (R. 817–821), and undisputed evidentiary facts
(R. 822–825). The pleading also contained video evidence of Father with the
children during the Mother’s initial campaign to have him removed from the
residence (R. 826-829). Appended to the filing were affidavits from Father’s
business clients attesting to his need to remain in the marital residence for
professional reasons pending the divorce (R. 850–852, R. 853–855, R. 856–
858, R. 859–861, R. 862–865, R. 866– 868, R. 869–872). The disputed
Temporary Orders that claimed consent were filed into the record by the
clerk on March 26, 2024. Father promptly responded by filing a formal

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Request for Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law regarding the 14
March 14 decision (R. 882–886).4 He then filed a notice of his intent to seek
mandamus relief by April 8, 2024 (R. 902–905). M. The Appellate
Proceedings In April 2024, Father prepared a Motion for Emergency Relief
directed to the Second Court of Appeals (R. 979–1007) and a Petition for
Writ of Mandamus (R. 931–978). The Petition was accepted by the appellate
court under cause number 02- 24-00149-CV on April 8, 2024, and the trial
court was notified of the filing that same day (R. 1009-1010). Two days later,
Father’s Motion for Emergency Relief and Petition for Writ of Mandamus
were denied per curiam (R. 1011–1012). Father then submitted a Motion for
Rehearing on April 18, 2024 (R. 1028–1044). Six days later, on April 24,
2024, Cooper L. Carter filed a Motion for Pre-Trial Conference (R. 1013–
1016), to which Father promptly objected (R. 1017–1023). The following day,
Father’s Motion for Rehearing was denied by the Second Court of Appeals
(R. 1045). Father moved for en banc reconsideration on April 26, 2024 (R.
1052–1066). On April 30, 2024, although Father continued to disagree with
the Temporary Orders and the hardship they imposed, he abided by the
court’s directives and filed a Notice of Completion regarding the court-
ordered parenting class, which both parties were required to complete by
May 1, 2024 (R. 1046–1050).5 The en banc reconsideration 4 No findings
were ever issued. 5 No notice of completion was ever filed by the Mother. 15
motion was denied the following day (R. 1067). Father then prepared a
second Petition for Writ of Mandamus before this Court, which was accepted
under cause number 24-0395. The trial court was notified of the filing by
postcard (R. 1068–1073). On May 9, 2024, Cooper L. Carter emailed Father
requesting his signature on an Income Withholding Order and claimed that
the orders were agreed (R. 1115). Father reviewed the proposed order,
determined that it was defective (R. 1117–1122), and communicated his
objections to Ms. Carter (R. 1116). N. Intervention From the Texas Attorney
General’s Office Subsequently, an intervention pleading was filed by the
Office of the Attorney General, seeking relief from the trial court regarding
child support obligations (R. 1098–1104). Father objected to this
intervention (R. 1105–1113). Notably, upon examining the pleading
purportedly filed by “Holly Hayes,” Father observed that the signature line
did not match the name of the listed attorney of record. Additionally, the font
sizes in the document appeared inconsistent, suggesting that the signature
may have been irregular (R. 1102). No further correspondence was filed by
the Attorney General’s Office in this matter. By July 2024, during Father’s
designated month for visitation under the disputed orders, he stayed in an
Airbnb near the marital home to maintain stability for the children and
worked with the host to attempt to establish a source of business revenue
(R. 1736–1746). 16 On August 30, 2024, this Court declined to hear Father’s
mandamus petition, and the trial court was notified (R. 1157–1162).
Immediately following the denial, Father prepared a Motion for Rehearing,
which he submitted and later amended in mid-September (R. 1135–1156).
The court was notified of the rehearing filing (R. 1163–1168). O. Challenge
to Opposing Counsel’s Authority Under Rule 12 After filing the Motion for
Rehearing with this Court, Father served discovery requests on the opposing
party, including Requests for Production of Documents (R. 1410–1411) and
Requests for Admissions (R. 1411–1415). In addition, Father filed a motion
under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 12, challenging Cooper L. Carter’s
authority to represent Mother in the trial court (R. 1169–1177). This

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
challenge was based on ambiguity surrounding Ms. Carter’s employment
status and the fact that her pleadings were being filed by Roderick D. Marx
—an individual who was not listed as counsel of record and not a party to
the case (R. 219, R. 1016). P.Declining Resources and Exhaustion of
Remedies Facing rapidly declining credit, reduced income (R. 1717–1718),
and limited housing options, Father filed an Emergency Motion for
Temporary Orders on September 24, 2024, requesting relief by October 1,
2024 (R. 1183–1195). When no relief was granted and no response was
received from the opposing party, Father 17 filed a motion seeking the joint
recusal of Judge James Munford and Associate Judge Jeff Kaitcer. The motion
asserted that the nature of Mother’s initial allegations had created an
appearance of bias that could undermine fairness in the proceedings (R.
1196–1220). Q. The First Recusal – Procedural Abnormalities Two days after
the recusal motion was filed, Judge James Munford declined to recuse
himself without explanation and referred the matter to the Honorable David
L. Evans, the 8th Administrative Regional Judge of Fort Worth (R. 1221–
1243). Upon reviewing this referral, Father observed that the version of the
motion submitted to Judge Evans differed significantly from the one he
originally filed. Father’s original filing was a single, 20.21 MB hyperlinked
PDF submitted via the re:SearchTX platform (R. 1253-1254). The version
transmitted to Judge Evans was missing exhibits and the supporting
affidavit. Father notified the court coordinator of the discrepancy and noted
that the file was approximately 18 MB smaller (R. 1254–1255). Receiving no
response, Father filed a formal notice with the court outlining these
procedural irregularities (R. 1245–1252). The following day, Judge Munford
issued an amended order of referral and again declined to recuse, without
explanation (R. 1281–1283). This time, the recusal motion was divided into
three separate files, with the court citing the "size of the motion" as
justification (R. 1356-1357). Father objected to the handling of the recusal
process (R. 1268–1280), noting that the Tarrant County District 18 Clerk’s
publicly available filing guidelines instruct litigants to compile all exhibits
into a single document (R. 1272 at 9). He also noted that his original 20.21
MB file was well within the platform’s approximately 30 MB capacity and
that fragmenting the submission contradicted the court’s standard
electronic filing protocol (R. 1271 at 6–7). R. The First Recusal – the
Appointment of Justice Lee Gabriel Activity paused until October 18, 2024,
when the parties received postcard notification that Father’s Supreme Court
Motion for Rehearing had been denied (R. 1292–1297). Three days later,
Judge David L. Evans issued an order setting a video conference regarding
the recusal motion for October 30, 2024 (R. 1298– 1301). On the day before
the conference, Judge Evans appointed retired Justice Lee Gabriel to preside
over the recusal matter (R. 1305–1308). During the scheduled video
conference, internet connectivity issues arose, and the hearing was
rescheduled to November 7, 2024, to be held in person at the 322nd District
Court. In anticipation of possible objections from opposing counsel—who
had not filed a response to the recusal motion—Father filed a PreTrial
Motion in Limine to prevent unnecessary interruptions during his
presentation and to reiterate key facts of the case (R. 1309-1315). Two days
later, Father submitted a Request for Confirmation of Procedural
Requirements, respectfully asking the district clerk to provide a certified
copy of 19 Justice Gabriel’s oath of office, in an effort to ensure procedural
transparency (R. 1319–1324). S. The First Recusal – Dental Emergency On

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
the morning of the rescheduled in-person hearing, November 7, 2024,
Father awoke experiencing significant dental distress, which he promptly
communicated to his father (R. 1391–1392), opposing counsel and the court
coordinator via email (R. 1394), and to Mother directly (R. 1395). Opposing
counsel agreed in writing to reschedule the hearing due to the emergency
(R. 1393). Nonetheless, four days later, on November 11, 2024, the court
coordinator disseminated via email an order signed by Justice Gabriel
denying Father’s recusal motion. The order specifically referenced Father’s
absence from the November 7 hearing but made no mention of the dental
emergency (R. 1397). In response, Father filed a Motion to Enter Judgment
on November 13, 2024, in which he articulated objections to the procedural
irregularities surrounding the recusal proceedings (R. 1325–1369). This
motion was supported by an affidavit elaborating upon those irregularities
(R. 1346–1349). Shortly thereafter, Father filed a Notice of Intent to Remove
the case to federal court, citing exhaustion of state judicial remedies and
setting forth jurisdictional grounds for removal to the U.S. District Court for
the Northern District of Texas (R. 1371–1397). 20 On November 18, 2024,
Father also submitted a Motion to Compel Discovery (R. 1398–1407)
pertaining to discovery requests initially served on Mother on September
17, 2024, attached as Exhibit A (R. 1408–1418). He requested that the court
deem the requested admissions conclusively established by operation of law
due to Mother’s failure to respond (R. 1405). The recusal proceedings
concluded when the court formally documented and served the order
denying Father’s recusal motion on November 19, 2024 (R. 1422– 1423). At
that point, the parties awaited formal confirmation of the termination of
Justice Lee Gabriel’s assignment, as such termination would not effectuate
“…until the undersigned Presiding Judge has terminated this assignment in
writing.” (R. 1306.) T. Federal Removal, Remand, and Initiation of
Proceedings Against Daniel Kenneth Branthoover Following the denial of the
recusal motion, Father spent the next two weeks compiling the necessary
record in preparation for federal removal. On December 2, 2024, he filed a
Notice of Removal with the state trial court (R. 1425–1444). Two days later,
however, the United States District Court remanded the matter back to state
court for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.6 On December 14, 2024, Dan
Branthoover sent Father a threatening text 6 The Petitioner has not fulfilled
her obligation under Tex. R. Civ. P. 237a by failing to serve a certified copy of
the Order of Remand. 21 message (R. 1719–1720). At that point, Father’s
financial losses had exceeded $75,000 (R. 1460–1462), prompting him to
initiate separate federal litigation against Daniel Branthoover in the U.S.
District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma. That action sought
damages arising from Mr. Branthoover’s involvement in the events
underlying this case, and was later amended (R. 1450–1464). Father
provided notice of the related federal case to the state trial court on
December 31, 2024 (R. 1445–1449). The federal complaint was filed
pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a) (R. 1428), and its statement of facts closely
mirrored those presented in the current matter (R. 1452–1455). U. Case
Abandonment The divorce case remained largely inactive until January 16,
2025, when Father submitted a comprehensive Case Memorandum and
served copies upon Judges James Munford and Jeff Kaitcer of the 322nd
Judicial District Court, Visiting Retired Justice Lee Gabriel, Regional Judge
David L. Evans, and opposing counsel Cooper L. Carter (R. 1465–1519). On
January 26, 2025, Father filed a Motion to Dismiss for Want of Prosecution,

=== PAGE 9 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
citing the lack of activity in the case by the opposing party and the Court’s
time standards for divorce proceedings (R. 1526–1533). On January 29,
2025, facing the imminent repossession of his primary vehicle, Father
returned to the matrimonial residence to retrieve his secondary vehicle.
Inside, he discovered numerous personal items that Mother had placed in 22
the vehicle. He temporarily relocated these items to the porch (R. 1628–
1629). Upon returning the next day to collect the children for his scheduled
possession, Father observed that Mother had moved the items from the
porch to the curb (R. 1630-1631). No further docket activity occurred until
February 25, 2025, when Father filed a Notice of Loss of Employment,
notifying the court of a significant reduction in income (R. 1520–1525). At
the same time, he submitted a Motion to Sign, requesting a ruling on his
long-pending Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, which had remained
unresolved since its original filing on February 22, 2024 (R. 1636–1656), and
which the court acknowledged during the March 14, 2024, hearing (R.
1369). Father also filed an Objection and Request for Judicial Notice,
recapping relevant procedural history and identifying pending matters
requiring rulings (R. 1660–1677). On February 28, 2025, Father filed a
Request for Ruling on his outstanding motions (R. 1678–1685). On March 5,
2025, he submitted a Notice of New Information, documenting Watauga
Police Department involvement regarding his personal property being
placed at the curb by Mother (R. 1686–1695). On March 12, 2025, Father
filed a Notice of Continued Obstruction, itemizing pending, unopposed
motions and emphasizing the ongoing lack of response from opposing
counsel (R. 1929–1942). He reinforced these concerns on March 14, 2025,
through 23 a Notice of Submission, restating the uncontested factual
background and the judicial inaction on multiple unresolved filings (R. 1943–
1955). By March 18, 2025, Father contacted the court coordinator via email,
highlighting that neither Judge Munford nor Judge Kaitcer had been
formally reinstated to preside over the case, despite Justice Gabriel’s denial
of recusal being entered nearly four months earlier (R. 1506-1507). In light
of the continued judicial inactivity, and being confident in his understanding
of dominant jurisdiction based on the extensive record, Father initiated a
new Original Suit Affecting the Parent- Child Relationship (SAPCR) in the
233rd District Court of Tarrant County, submitting a cover letter explaining
his need for immediate relief for himself and his minor children (R. 2259–
2277). V. The SAPCR Suit and the Sudden Reappearance of Counsel On
March 18, 2025, the 233rd District Court of Tarrant County accepted
Father’s original SAPCR petition (R. 2053–2064). Shortly thereafter, Mother
reappeared in the litigation after several months of inactivity and filed a
general denial in response to the SAPCR petition (R. 2278–2282). This
pleading was submitted on behalf of Cooper L. Carter by Roderick D. Marx
(R. 2282). Mr. Marx subsequently filed a motion to consolidate the SAPCR
matter back into the original divorce case in the 322nd District Court (R.
2283–2286), again purporting to act on Ms. Carter’s behalf (R. 2286). Father
moved to strike both the general denial and the motion to consolidate 24 (R.
1956–1965), and attached an exhibit showing that opposing counsel was
registered under a different law firm than what appeared on her pleadings.
(R. 1962–1963). Father also filed a second Rule 12 Motion challenging
Cooper L. Carter’s authority to represent Mother in the 233rd District
Court, citing Ms. Carter’s continued failure to formally appear and the
repeated filings by Mr. Marx in her name (R. 2287–2300). As of the date of

=== PAGE 10 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
this filing, no response has been submitted to any of these pleadings by Ms.
Carter. W. The Emergency TRO On March 24, 2025, Father filed an
Objection to Consolidation in the second-filed case (R. 1880–1888) and an
Emergency Motion for Temporary Restraining Order (TRO), seeking to
prevent Mother from restricting his access to the family residence and to
safeguard the children (R. 2301–2326). The TRO incorporated the same
statement of facts that remains unopposed in multiple pleadings (R. 2304–
2312). Father then coordinated with court staff to schedule the presentation
of his emergency motion and documented all communications (R. 2333–
2365) regarding these interactions. In those communications, Father first
inquired about the status of his request and informed the court that the
opposing party had been notified of the substance of the relief sought (R.
2338). The clerk advised that in-person presentation was required, and
Father requested to appear between 9 a.m. and 2 p.m. on March 28, 2025,
again confirming that the opposing party had been served (R. 2339). Father
25 delivered the intended materials to opposing counsel in advance of that
presentation (R. 2351), and the clerk confirmed the scheduled time (R. 2339-
2340). On March 28, 2025, Father appeared before the court coordinator,
who assisted in securing opposing counsel’s agreement to set the TRO
hearing for April 10, 2025, from the available dates provided (R. 2358). The
coordinator initialed the scheduling notice to reflect that agreement (R.
2360-2361). Father then proceeded to present the motion to the Honorable
Kate Stone, who summarily declined to even hear it based solely on a
prospective objection communicated by Mother’s counsel—who was not
even present in court (R. 2352). Even the coordinator acknowledged that the
motion could have been heard on the spot, and noted that it could have been
transferred after the emergency was addressed (R. 2356). Instead, the
Associate Judge declined entirely to entertain the motion, ultimately
triggering cause number 25-0367, now pending before this Honorable
Court. On April 1, 2025, Father filed a Pre-Objection in the 322nd court
addressing opposing counsel’s anticipated motion to consolidate (R. 1889–
1915). He also submitted a Respondent’s Statement in the 322nd District
Court (R. 1916–1919) and a separate Petitioner’s Statement in the 233rd
District Court (R. 1920–1928). Father then filed a Petitioner’s Notice in the
233rd, presenting a side-by-side analysis of the children’s best interests and
relevant procedural considerations (R. 1995–2004). 26 On April 3, 2025,
Roderick Marx filed the Motion to Consolidate on behalf of Mother’s counsel
that had been used to block the emergency hearing in the 322nd District
Court, which failed to acknowledge Father’s prior objection (R. 2366–2369).
In response, Father filed a Pre-Objection to Transfer in the 233rd District
Court (R. 2084–2087) realizing that the case would need to be transferred at
some point along with a Notice of New Information advising the court that
Mother was now engaged to Damen Kazlauskas—the individual with whom
she exchanged extensive messages at the outset of this case (R. 2019–2024).
Father also submitted a Comprehensive Legal Analysis in Support of
Dismissal in the 322nd District Court, setting forth grounds to dismiss the
original divorce matter so that the SAPCR could proceed independently (R.
1975–1994). X. The Dragon in Triplicate A few days later, Father filed a
Notice of Intent to File Mandamus in the 233rd District Court (R. 2065–
2083) and a Notice of Intent to File Prohibition in the 322nd District Court
(R. 2005–2018). On April 10, 2025, Father filed an Emergency Motion for
Declaratory Relief (R. 1775–1786) and a Petition for Writ of Mandamus in

=== PAGE 11 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
the Second Court of Appeals, naming the Honorable Kate Stone as
Respondent under cause number 02-25-00164-CV (“the SAPCR Mandamus”)
(R. 2025–2052). Directly after this mandamus was submitted to the Second
Court of Appeals, District Judge Kenneth Newell from the 233rd District
Court sua sponte granted Mother’s Motion to Consolidate in the 233rd
District Court and then filed it 27 with the 322nd District Court. (R.
2392-2395). The following day, the first-filed petition (“the SAPCR
mandamus”) was denied per curiam in the Second Court of Appeals. On
April 15, 2025, Father filed a Dominant Jurisdiction Analysis in the 322nd
District Court (R. 2088–2100), along with a second memorandum titled
Procedural Irregularities with Temporary Orders realizing that he was
dealing with three potential abuses of discretion from three separate judges
(R. 2172– 2202). That same day, Father filed a second Petition for Writ of
Mandamus in the Second Court of Appeals, this time naming the Honorable
Jeff Kaitcer as Respondent under cause number 02-25-00166-CV (“the Void
Order Mandamus”) (R. 2396–2447) and filed an Emergency Motion for Stay
to halt the proceedings given the extraordinary circumstances of this matter.
(R. 2106–2123). See No. 02- 25-00166-CV The following day, Father filed a
third Petition for Writ of Mandamus, naming the Honorable Kenneth Newell
as Respondent under cause number 02-25- 00171-CV (“the Consolidation
Mandamus”) for his arbitrary grant of Mother’s contested motion without a
hearing (R. 2223–2253). On the same day, Father’s second mandamus
petition was denied per curiam. By April 17, 2025, all three mandamus
petitions had been denied per curiam, and Father moved for reconsideration
en banc in all three matters (R. 2448–2467; R. 2203–2217; R. 2155–2171),
thus giving birth to the “Dragon in Triplicate” – three separate judges 28
implicated in three distinct abuses of discretion within the same family law
matter. Y. The Sudden Move to Final Trial On April 23, 2025, with all three
mandamus petitions pending, Father received a Notice of Court Proceeding
scheduling a conference for April 29, 2025, purposed for setting the matter
for final trial (R. 1772–1772). That same day, Father filed a formal objection
to the setting (R. 2218–2222). The following day, Father’s first filed en banc
motion for reconsideration (the “Void Order” mandamus) was denied per
curiam by the appellate court. To address the unresolved issues regarding
subject-matter jurisdiction over these orders, Father filed a Plea to the
Jurisdiction asking the Honorable James Munford to clarify the legal basis
for the current orders (R. 2468–2479). In a further effort to protect his
procedural rights, Father filed a Second Motion to Recuse Judge Munford on
April 25, 2025 (R. 1787–1859). Later that same day, Mother notified Father
that the emergency circumstance which had formed the original basis for
Father’s urgent push for the Emergency TRO petition had now materialized
(R. 1766–1771). With this new development, Father filed a Notice of Non-
Appearance and Objection to Trial Setting (R. 2480–2486) and amended his
pending Motion to Recuse (R. 2487–2608). Despite the allegations and the
procedural defects raised, Judge Munford declined to recuse himself for a
second time without any substantive explanation (R. 2609–2613). 29
Separately, the Honorable Jeff Kaitcer—though not named in the recusal
motion—filed a voluntary recusal from the case (R. 2614–2618). In response,
Father filed an Objection to Procedural Handling of the Recusal
Proceedings, explaining that Judge Kaitcer’s referral order was improper
and specifically objected to the court coordinator managing the recusal
process (R. 2619–2625). On May 1, 2025, the appellate court denied

=== PAGE 12 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Father’s two remaining en banc motions per curiam (R. 2626-2627;
2628-2629). That same day, Father filed his second Petition for Writ of
Mandamus before this Court under cause number 25- 0361. 7 He filed a
third petition the next day, May 2, 2025, under cause number 25- 0367,
followed by a fourth on May 7, 2025, under cause number 25-0378. There
are now three concurrent mandamuses before this Honorable Court, but the
risk of compounding error continues down below. Z. Risk of Future Error An
Order of Assignment was forwarded by the coordinator from the Honorable
David L. Evans appointing Senior Chief Justice John Cayce to oversee the
recusal matters on May 6, 2025 (R. 3148-3150). Because the Order of
Assignment still incorrectly named the Honorable Jeffrey Kaitcer and the
coordinator was still handling the matters, Father filed a second objection
(R. 3151-3166). 7 The first filed mandamus before this court was filed on
April 8, 2024 under case number 25-0395. 30 AA. The Need for Relief
Continues On May 12, 2025, Father filed an Affidavit in cause number
25-0361 reiterating the need for an emergency stay of the trial court
proceedings (R. 3488- 3500). Three days later, the Honorable David L. Evans
overruled the Father’s objections regarding the involvement of the court
coordinator and the Hon. Kaitcer motion which was never filed (R.
3506-3508). The next day, Father filed an emergency notice with the Court
reiterating that the date by which he requested relief was approaching, and
he reiterated the need for an emergency stay and reminded the Court that
no opposition to the relief being sought had been raised. (R. 3501-3505). AB.
Mandamus #4 On May 19, 2025, the Father filed a Petition for Writ of
Mandamus before this Court as an Original Proceeding which was docketed
as case number 25-0426 on the grounds that the Regional Presiding Judge’s
refusal to comply with Rule 18a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure was an
abuse of discretion (R. 3509-3559). Father then prepared a Case
Memorandum and filed it in that cause number (R. 3837-3876). The next
day, Father filed an Emergency Motion to Stay reiterating the need for a stay
of the proceedings below given errors continue to compound. (R.
3877-3896). AC. Mandamus #5 The very same day, Hon. John H. Cayce, Jr.,
assigned by Hon. David L. 31 Evans, summarily denied the recusal of Hon.
James Munford, District Judge of the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County
(R. 3897-3900). An order was also issued denying the recusal of Hon. Jeff
Kaitcer, referring to a motion that was never filed. (R. 3901-3904). The next
day, Father filed a Notice of Intent to File Mandamus, raising the issue “…
that the record, on its face, demonstrates a clear deviation from procedural
due process and established Texas jurisprudence regarding recusal
proceedings, warranting immediate corrective action to uphold this court’s
impartiality and public confidence in the judiciary.” (R. 3905-3914). AD.
Striking the OAG Finally, on May 22, 2025, Father filed a Motion to Strike
the Intervention of the Office of the Attorney General requesting that “[i]f a
justiciable interest cannot be demonstrated or if a response is not filed by a
future date deemed appropriate by the Court, order that the intervention
pleading from the Office of the Attorney General naming Holly Hayes as
counsel be stricken from the record (R. 3915-3956). sHOw how that the
court cannot just sua sponte move the case to final trial despite all of these
issues. charles myers has been abused by the judicial system, and must stop
the final hearing from happening. There are multiple unresolved motions,
including motions for recusal, pleas to the jurisdiction, motions to strike,
and pending mandamus proceedings, all raising serious questions about the

=== PAGE 13 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
validity of prior orders and the authority of the presiding judges. Texas
courts are required to resolve jurisdictional challenges and recusal motions
before proceeding to substantive matters, including final trial. See Tex. R.
Civ. P. 18a (recusal procedure); In re Union Pac. Res. Co., 969 S.W.2d 427,
428 (Tex. 1998) (orig. proceeding) (“A trial court commits error if it proceeds
to trial while a recusal motion is pending and unresolved.”); In re Gray, 158
S.W.3d 876, 879 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2005, orig. proceeding) (“A
trial court must resolve a plea to the jurisdiction before proceeding to the
merits.”). Because unresolved recusal motions and jurisdictional challenges
deprive the court of authority to act, any sua sponte setting of a final trial is
void or voidable, and proceeding would constitute an abuse of discretion and
a violation of due process.
Answer (Texas)
Short response
A Texas trial court cannot proceed to set or conduct a final trial while there
are unresolved recusal motions, jurisdictional challenges, or other pending
dispositive motions; doing so is a clear violation of Texas law and renders
any resulting orders void. The court must first resolve all such motions
before taking further substantive action, and failure to do so constitutes an
abuse of discretion and a denial of due process.
Summary
Texas law is unequivocal that when a motion to recuse is filed, the presiding
judge must either recuse themselves or refer the motion to the regional
presiding judge, and may not take further action in the case until the motion
is resolved. Similarly, jurisdictional challenges and other dispositive motions
must be addressed before the court can proceed to trial or issue substantive
orders; any attempt to move forward while such motions are pending is not
only improper but voids subsequent judicial actions.
In the present matter, the record demonstrates a pattern of judicial inaction
and procedural irregularities, including the failure to rule on recusal
motions, pleas to the jurisdiction, and other critical motions, as well as the
improper issuance of orders and consolidation of cases without hearings.
Under controlling Texas authority, these failures deprive the court of
authority to act, and any sua sponte setting of a final trial under these
circumstances is void or voidable, amounting to an abuse of discretion and a
violation of the affected party’s due process rights.
Background and Relevant Law
Legislative and Regulatory Framework
The Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, specifically Rule 18a, govern the recusal
and disqualification of judges. Rule 18a provides that if a motion to recuse is

=== PAGE 14 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
filed before evidence is offered at trial, the judge must refrain from taking
any further action in the case until the motion is decided, except for good
cause stated in writing or on the record. The rule is mandatory and applies
to all Texas trial courts, with limited exceptions not relevant here (Rule 18a.
Recusal and Disqualification of Judges, Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a).
Case Law
Texas appellate courts have consistently enforced the strict requirements of
Rule 18a. When a recusal motion is filed, the judge has only two options:
recuse themselves or refer the motion to the presiding judge of the
administrative judicial district. Any further action taken by the judge before
the recusal motion is resolved is void (In re Gold, 04-25-00085-CV (Tex. App.
May 07, 2025); In re Norman, 191 S.W.3d 858 (Tex. App. 2006); Brosseau v.
Ranzau, 911 S.W.2d 890 (Tex. App. 1995); Jamilah v. Bass, 862 S.W.2d 201
(Tex. App. 1993); Lamberti v. Tschoepe, 776 S.W.2d 651 (Tex. App. 1989); 
Greenberg, Fisk & Fielder v. Howell, 676 S.W.2d 431 (Tex. App. 1984)).
Similarly, Texas courts have held that a trial court must resolve jurisdictional
challenges, such as pleas to the jurisdiction, before proceeding to the merits
of the case. Failure to rule on such motions within a reasonable time is an
abuse of discretion and may be corrected by mandamus (In re Hudspeth
Cnty., 08-24-00137-CV (Tex. App. Jun 26, 2024); In re Robinson,
05-22-00579-CV (Tex. App. Sep 23, 2022); In re Univ. of Tex. MD Anderson
Cancer Ctr., NO. 01-19-00201-CV (Tex. App. Jul 30, 2019); In re Gray, 158
S.W.3d 876, 879 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2005, orig. proceeding)).
Due process also requires that parties receive adequate notice and an
opportunity to be heard before a final trial setting. Rule 245 of the Texas
Rules of Civil Procedure mandates at least forty-five days’ notice for a first
trial setting in contested cases, and failure to provide such notice is a
violation of due process (In re Interest of K.M.L., 443 S.W.3d 101 (Tex.
2014)).
Analysis
1. The Court’s Duty to Resolve Recusal Motions Before
Proceeding
The Texas Supreme Court and courts of appeals have repeatedly held that
once a motion to recuse is filed, the trial judge is stripped of authority to
take any further action in the case, except to recuse themselves or refer the
motion to the presiding judge. This is a mandatory, not discretionary, duty
(In re Gold, 04-25-00085-CV (Tex. App. May 07, 2025); In re Norman, 191
S.W.3d 858 (Tex. App. 2006); Brosseau v. Ranzau, 911 S.W.2d 890 (Tex. App.
1995); Jamilah v. Bass, 862 S.W.2d 201 (Tex. App. 1993); Lamberti v.
Tschoepe, 776 S.W.2d 651 (Tex. App. 1989); Greenberg, Fisk & Fielder v.
Howell, 676 S.W.2d 431 (Tex. App. 1984)). The rule is so strict that even if
the recusal motion is defective or untimely, the judge must still recuse or
refer; the judge cannot simply ignore the motion or proceed with the case.

=== PAGE 15 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
If the judge fails to comply with these requirements and takes further action
—such as setting the case for final trial, issuing orders, or conducting
hearings—those actions are void and of no effect (In re Gold, 04-25-00085-
CV (Tex. App. May 07, 2025); Brosseau v. Ranzau, 911 S.W.2d 890 (Tex. App.
1995)). This is true regardless of whether the recusal motion ultimately has
merit; the procedural safeguard is designed to protect the integrity and
impartiality of the judiciary.
2. The Court’s Duty to Resolve Jurisdictional Challenges
and Other Dispositive Motions
Texas law is equally clear that a trial court must resolve jurisdictional
challenges, such as pleas to the jurisdiction, before proceeding to the merits
of the case (In re Hudspeth Cnty., 08-24-00137-CV (Tex. App. Jun 26, 2024); 
In re Gray, 158 S.W.3d 876, 879 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2005, orig.
proceeding)). The act of considering and ruling on a properly filed and
pending motion is a ministerial duty, and the court’s failure to do so within a
reasonable time is an abuse of discretion that may be corrected by
mandamus (In re Robinson, 05-22-00579-CV (Tex. App. Sep 23, 2022); In re
Univ. of Tex. MD Anderson Cancer Ctr., NO. 01-19-00201-CV (Tex. App. Jul
30, 2019); O'Donniley v. Golden, 860 S.W.2d 267 (Tex. App. 1993)).
A court cannot simply ignore or delay ruling on such motions and proceed to
trial or issue substantive orders. Doing so deprives the court of authority to
act and violates the due process rights of the parties.
3. Due Process and Notice Requirements
Rule 245 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure requires that parties receive
at least forty-five days’ notice of a first trial setting in contested cases (In re
Interest of K.M.L., 443 S.W.3d 101 (Tex. 2014)). This rule is grounded in due
process, ensuring that parties have adequate time to prepare and respond. If
a court sets a final trial without resolving pending dispositive motions or
without proper notice, any resulting judgment is subject to being set aside
for violation of due process.
4. Application to the Present Facts
The record in this matter reveals a series of unresolved motions, including
multiple recusal motions, pleas to the jurisdiction, motions to strike, and
pending mandamus proceedings. The trial court has failed to rule on these
motions, and in some instances, has taken further action—such as setting
the case for final trial—while these motions remain pending.
Under the authorities cited above, the court’s actions are improper and void.
The court is required to resolve all recusal motions before taking any further
action in the case (In re Gold, 04-25-00085-CV (Tex. App. May 07, 2025); In
re Norman, 191 S.W.3d 858 (Tex. App. 2006); Brosseau v. Ranzau, 911 S.W.
2d 890 (Tex. App. 1995)). The same is true for jurisdictional challenges and
other dispositive motions (In re Hudspeth Cnty., 08-24-00137-CV (Tex. App.
Jun 26, 2024); In re Gray, 158 S.W.3d 876, 879 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th

=== PAGE 16 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Dist.] 2005, orig. proceeding)). Any attempt to proceed to final trial while
these motions are unresolved is a clear abuse of discretion and a violation of
due process.
Moreover, the court’s failure to provide adequate notice of trial settings, as
required by Rule 245, further compounds the due process violations (In re
Interest of K.M.L., 443 S.W.3d 101 (Tex. 2014)).
5. Mandamus as a Remedy
Texas courts have repeatedly recognized mandamus as the appropriate
remedy to compel a trial court to rule on pending motions and to prevent the
court from proceeding to trial while dispositive motions remain unresolved
(In re Robinson, 05-22-00579-CV (Tex. App. Sep 23, 2022); In re Hudspeth
Cnty., 08-24-00137-CV (Tex. App. Jun 26, 2024); In re Johnnie Tasby, 40 S.W.
3d 190 (Tex. App. 2001)). The courts have emphasized that the duty to rule
on such motions is ministerial, and a trial court’s refusal to do so is subject
to correction by mandamus.
Exceptions and Caveats
There is a narrow exception in Rule 18a that allows a judge to take further
action in the case before a recusal motion is resolved, but only for good
cause stated in writing or on the record (Rule 18a. Recusal and
Disqualification of Judges, Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a). The authorities make clear,
however, that this exception is strictly construed and rarely applies. The
record here does not indicate that any such good cause was stated or that
the exception would apply.
Additionally, while some cases discuss the possibility of defective or untimely
recusal motions, the courts have held that the judge must still recuse or
refer the motion, and cannot simply ignore it or proceed with the case
(Jamilah v. Bass, 862 S.W.2d 201 (Tex. App. 1993)).
Conclusion
Texas law is clear and unequivocal: a trial court cannot proceed to set or
conduct a final trial while there are unresolved recusal motions,
jurisdictional challenges, or other dispositive motions. The court must first
resolve all such motions before taking further substantive action. Any
attempt to move forward while these motions are pending is void,
constitutes an abuse of discretion, and violates the due process rights of the
affected party. The record in this matter demonstrates a pattern of judicial
inaction and procedural irregularities that deprive the court of authority to
act, and any sua sponte setting of a final trial under these circumstances is
improper and must be halted.

Rio Grande Valley Gas Co., In re, 987 S.W.2d 167 (Tex. App. 1999)

=== PAGE 17 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Rule 18a(c) requires a judge to either recuse himself or request the
presiding judge to assign a judge to hear a recusal motion 'prior to any
further proceedings in the case.' TEX.R.CIV.P. 18a(c) (Emphasis supplied).
The filing of a recusal motion provides no rational basis for another court
within the county to unilaterally order the lawsuit transferred. Republic, 931
S.W.2d at 343.
Summary
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a(c) mandates that a judge must address a
recusal motion by either recusing themselves or requesting the assignment
of another judge to hear the motion before any further proceedings in the
case. This requirement underscores the importance of resolving recusal
motions to ensure impartiality and proper judicial process. The passage also
highlights that the filing of a recusal motion should not be circumvented by
transferring the case to another court, reinforcing the necessity of
addressing such motions before proceeding with the case.
In re Interest of K.M.L., 443 S.W.3d 101 (Tex. 2014)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
Rule 245 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure provides that a trial court
'may set contested cases on written request of any party, or on the court's
own motion, with reasonable notice of not less than forty-five days to the
parties of a first setting for trial, or by agreement of the parties.' Tex.R. Civ.
P. 245. If a timely answer has been filed in a contested case or the defendant
has otherwise made an appearance, due process rights are violated when a
judgment is subsequently entered without the party having received notice
of the setting of the case, Peralta v. Heights Med. Ctr., 485 U.S. 80, 86–87,
108 S.Ct. 896, 99 L.Ed.2d 75 (1988), even when that party previously waived
notice of citation.
Summary
Rule 245 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure requires that parties receive
reasonable notice of not less than forty-five days for a first trial setting. This
rule is in place to protect due process rights, ensuring that parties have
adequate notice and opportunity to prepare for trial. The passage also
references a U.S. Supreme Court case, Peralta v. Heights Med. Ctr., which
underscores the importance of notice in upholding due process rights. This
supports the proposition that the court cannot proceed to a final trial

without resolving pending motions and ensuring proper notice, as doing so
would violate due process.
In re Gold, 04-25-00085-CV (Tex. App. May 07, 2025)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a(f)(1) provides: 'Regardless of whether the
motion [to recuse] complies with this rule, the respondent judge, within
three business days after the motion is filed, must either: (A) sign and file
with the clerk an order of recusal or disqualification; or (B) sign and file with
the clerk an order referring the motion to the regional presiding judge.' ...
Once Gold filed the motion to recuse, respondent could not take further
action other than signing an order of recusal or an order referring the
motion to the regional presiding judge. ... The failure to take one of these
two actions renders subsequent orders void. ... Additionally, '[i]f a motion is
filed before evidence has been offered at trial, the respondent judge must
take no further action in the case until the motion has been decided, except
for good cause stated in writing or on the record.' ... We conclude that
because the respondent signed the temporary orders after relator filed a
motion to recuse and the record does not support a good cause exception as
contemplated by rule 18a, the temporary orders are void and of no effect.
Summary
When a motion to recuse is filed, the judge must either recuse themselves or
refer the motion to the regional presiding judge. The judge cannot take
further action in the case until the motion is resolved unless there is a good
cause stated in writing or on the record. Failure to comply with these
requirements renders subsequent orders void. This supports the proposition
that unresolved recusal motions and jurisdictional challenges must be
addressed before proceeding to a final trial.
In re Robinson, 05-22-00579-CV (Tex. App. Sep 23, 2022)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Mandamus is an extraordinary remedy requiring relators to show that (1)
the trial court has clearly abused its discretion, and (2) there is no adequate
appellate remedy. In re Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., 148 S.W.3d 124, 135-36
(Tex. 2004) (orig. proceeding). Because the trial court has been afforded a
reasonable time to rule and relators have no adequate remedy by appeal to
challenge the trial court's refusal to rule, relators have demonstrated their
entitlement to a writ of mandamus compelling the trial court to rule. The act

=== PAGE 19 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
of considering and ruling on a motion that is properly filed and pending
before a trial court is a ministerial act, and mandamus may issue to compel
the trial judge to act. In re Greater McAllen Star Props., Inc., 444 S.W.3d
743, 748 (Tex. App.-Corpus Christi-Edinburg 2014, orig. proceeding); Barnes
v. State, 832 S.W.2d 424, 426 (Tex. App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 1992, orig.
proceeding) (per curiam). To obtain mandamus relief for a trial judge's
refusal to rule on a motion, the relator must establish the motion was
properly filed and has been pending for a reasonable time, the relator
requested a ruling on the motion, and the trial judge refused to rule.
Summary
Mandamus is an appropriate remedy when a trial court has failed to rule on
motions that have been properly filed and pending for a reasonable time.
The passage emphasizes that ruling on such motions is a ministerial act, and
a trial court's refusal to do so can be challenged through mandamus. This
supports the proposition that unresolved motions, such as recusal motions
and jurisdictional challenges, must be addressed before proceeding to a final
trial.
Lamberti v. Tschoepe, 776 S.W.2d 651 (Tex. App. 1989)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The Texas Government Code provides that a district or statutory county
court judge shall request the presiding judge to assign another judge to hear
a motion relating to the recusal of the judge from a case pending in his own
court. TEX.GOV'T CODE ANN. § 74.059 (Vernon 1988). The Texas Rules of
Civil Procedure are explicit with regard to these motions. The trial judge has
two choices, recusal or referral. TEX.R.CIV.PROC.R. 18a(c). The rules
further provide: If the judge declines to recuse himself, he shall forward to
the presiding judge of the administrative judicial district, in either original
form or certified copy, an order of referral, the motion, and all opposing and
concerning statements. Except for good cause stated in the order in which
further action is taken, the judge shall make no further orders and shall take
no further action in the case after filing of the motion and prior to a hearing
on the motion.
Summary
When a recusal motion is filed, the judge has only two options: to recuse
themselves or to refer the motion to the presiding judge of the
administrative judicial district. The judge is prohibited from taking further
action in the case until the recusal motion is resolved. This supports the
proposition that unresolved recusal motions deprive the court of authority to
proceed with substantive matters, including setting a final trial.

Greenberg, Benson, Fisk and Fielder, P.C. v. Howell, 685 S.W.2d 694 (Tex.
App. 1984)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
In a published opinion in a recent mandamus action involving these same
parties, we discussed the duty of a district judge to whom a recusal motion
is addressed, citing TEX.REV.CIV.STAT.ANN. art. 200a § 6 (Vernon Supp.
1984) and TEX.R.CIV.P. 18a (Vernon Supp.1984). Greenberg, Fisk and
Fielder v. Charles Ben Howell, 676 S.W.2d 431 (Tex.App.-Dallas, 1984). In
that opinion we held that, under both statute and rule, in the event a recusal
motion is filed a district judge must promptly enter one of the two orders
which are permitted to him, i.e. recusal or referral. We now go a step further
and hold that a trial judge, when presented with a recusal motion, has only
the option to act in one of these two specified ways; he does not have the
option of doing nothing.
Summary
Texas law mandates a district judge to act promptly on a recusal motion by
either recusing themselves or referring the motion. The judge does not have
the discretion to ignore the motion. This supports the proposition that
unresolved recusal motions must be addressed before proceeding to
substantive matters, such as a final trial.
In re Hudspeth Cnty., 08-24-00137-CV (Tex. App. Jun 26, 2024)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Mandamus relief is an extraordinary remedy requiring the relator to show
that (1) the trial court clearly abused its discretion and (2) the relator lacks
an adequate remedy by appeal. A trial court clearly abuses its discretion
when it refuses to rule on a pending motion within a reasonable amount of
time. ... To establish that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to
rule on a pending motion, the relator must show that the trial court: (1) had
a duty to perform a nondiscretionary act; (2) was asked to perform that act;
and (3) failed to do so. Mandamus is proper to correct this abuse of
discretion and compel the trial court to act.
Summary
A trial court has a duty to rule on pending motions, such as pleas to the
jurisdiction, within a reasonable time. If the court fails to do so, it may be
considered an abuse of discretion, and mandamus relief can be sought to
compel the court to act. This supports the proposition that unresolved

motions, including jurisdictional challenges, must be addressed before
proceeding to a final trial.
In re Univ. of Tex. MD Anderson Cancer Ctr., NO. 01-19-00201-CV (Tex. App.
Jul 30, 2019)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
A trial judge has a legal, nondiscretionary duty to consider and rule on
properly filed motions within a reasonable time." ... "A delay of more than 12
months in ruling on a plea to the jurisdiction is an abuse of discretion.
Summary
A trial judge has a nondiscretionary duty to rule on properly filed motions
within a reasonable time. This includes jurisdictional challenges, which must
be resolved before proceeding to substantive matters like a final trial. The
passage also highlights that a delay of more than 12 months in ruling on a
plea to the jurisdiction is considered an abuse of discretion. This supports
the proposition that unresolved motions, such as those for recusal and
jurisdictional challenges, must be addressed before moving to a final trial.
Jamilah v. Bass, 862 S.W.2d 201 (Tex. App. 1993)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Relator's motion for recusal sought the have Judge Bass either recuse
himself or forward the case to the presiding judge of Brazoria County.
Respondent argues that the recusal motion is not a proper motion in that it
was untimely filed and failed to state a ground for recusal. This court has
previously held that the procedural requirements of Rule 18a are mandatory
and a party who fails to comply with them waives the right to complain of a
judge's failure to recuse himself. ... On these facts, we hold the trial judge
had but two options: to recuse himself or refer the case to the presiding
judge. TEX.R.CIV.P. 18a(c); Lamberti v. Tschoepe, 776 S.W.2d 651 (Tex.App.--
Dallas 1989, writ denied). This is so regardless of the timeliness of the
motion or the sufficiency of the grounds for recusal.
Summary
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a mandates that a judge must either recuse
themselves or refer the recusal motion to the presiding judge of the
administrative judicial district. This requirement is mandatory, and the court
cannot proceed with substantive matters, such as a final trial, while a

recusal motion is pending and unresolved. This supports the proposition that
the court cannot move the case to final trial while there are unresolved
recusal motions and other pending issues.
In re Johnnie Tasby, 40 S.W.3d 190 (Tex. App. 2001)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
A trial court may not arbitrarily halt proceedings in a pending case, and
mandamus will lie to compel a trial court to hear and rule on motions
pending before it. ... Further, if a court unnecessarily delays ruling,
mandamus will also lie in appropriate situations. An appellate court has the
authority to issue a writ of mandamus where the court fails to act within a
reasonable time, so that the relator may either accept the ruling or attack it.
Summary
A trial court is obligated to rule on pending motions and cannot arbitrarily
halt proceedings. If a court fails to act within a reasonable time, mandamus
relief is appropriate. This supports the proposition that the court cannot
proceed to a final trial without resolving pending motions, such as recusal
motions and jurisdictional challenges, as doing so would be an abuse of
discretion and a violation of due process.
O'Donniley v. Golden, 860 S.W.2d 267 (Tex. App. 1993)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
When a motion is properly filed and pending before a trial court, the act of
giving consideration to and ruling upon that motion is a ministerial act." ...
"Having found a violation of his duty to rule, we must now determine
whether Relator had an adequate remedy at law. Mandamus has historically
been authorized to compel a trial judge to go to trial.
Summary
The passage highlights the duty of a trial court to consider and rule upon
motions that are properly filed and pending. This duty is described as a
ministerial act, meaning it is obligatory and not discretionary. The passage
further indicates that mandamus can be used to compel a trial judge to act
when there is a failure to rule on a motion. This supports the proposition
that unresolved motions, such as recusal motions and jurisdictional
challenges, must be addressed before proceeding to substantive matters like
a final trial.

In re Norman, 191 S.W.3d 858 (Tex. App. 2006)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a, Judge Austin had a mandatory
duty either to recuse himself or to refer the recusal motion to the presiding
judge. TEX.R. CIV. P. 18a... Even though a motion to recuse may be
defective, the challenged judge must either recuse or refer the motion, so
that another judge can determine the procedural adequacy and merits of the
motion to recuse... Once the motion to recuse Judge Austin was filed, Judge
Austin was precluded from taking any further action other than issuing an
order of recusal of himself or an order of referral to the presiding judge. See
TEX.R. CIV. P. 18a. If a judge fails to comply with the rules governing
motions for recusal, all subsequent actions by the judge in that case are
void.
Summary
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a imposes a mandatory duty on judges to
either recuse themselves or refer recusal motions to the presiding judge.
This duty is not discretionary, and failure to comply renders any subsequent
actions by the judge void. This supports the proposition that unresolved
recusal motions must be addressed before proceeding to substantive
matters, such as a final trial.
Brosseau v. Ranzau, 911 S.W.2d 890 (Tex. App. 1995)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
There is a simple interpretation of Rule 18a. The appellate courts have
agreed that when presented with a motion to recuse a judge has two, and
only two, options. These options are for the judge to either recuse himself or
refer the motion to the presiding judge of the administrative judicial
district... If a trial court fails to comply with the rules provided for in Rule
18a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, all actions taken by the judge
subsequent to such violation are void.
Summary
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a mandates that a judge must either recuse
themselves or refer a motion to recuse to the presiding judge of the
administrative judicial district. Failure to do so renders any subsequent
actions by the judge void. This supports the proposition that unresolved
recusal motions must be addressed before proceeding to substantive

matters, such as a final trial, and that any actions taken without resolving
these motions are void.
Woodruff v. Wright, 51 S.W.3d 727 (Tex. App. 2001)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
When a motion to recuse has been filed, a judge must either recuse himself
or request the presiding administrative judge to assign another judge to
hear the motion. Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a(a),(c),(d). ... The Texas Rules of Civil
Procedure provide that a judge shall recuse himself in any proceeding in
which 'his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.' Tex. R. Civ. P. 18b(2)
(a).
Summary
Procedural requirements under the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure when a
motion to recuse is filed. It specifies that a judge must either recuse
themselves or have another judge assigned to hear the motion. This
supports the proposition that recusal motions must be resolved before
proceeding to substantive matters, as it highlights the necessity of
addressing potential impartiality before continuing with the case.
Greenberg, Fisk & Fielder v. Howell, 676 S.W.2d 431 (Tex. App. 1984)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The duty of a district judge to whom a recusal motion is addressed is clear.
Our Legislature has provided in Sec. 6, Art. 200a, TEX.REV.CIV.STAT.ANN.
(Vernon Supp.1982) that among other duties of a judge: A district judge
shall request the Presiding Judge to assign a judge of the administrative
district to hear any motions to recuse such district judge from a case
pending in his court. Our Supreme Court, pursuant to its rule-making
powers, has provided in Rule 18a, TEX.R.CIV.P. (1983) that: Rule 18a.
Recusal or Disqualification of Trial Judge ... (c) Prior to any further
proceedings in the case, the judge shall either recuse himself or request the
presiding judge of the administrative judicial district to assign a judge to
hear such motion. ... (d) If the judge declines to recuse himself, he shall
forward to the presiding judge of the administrative judicial district, in
either original form or certified copy, an order of referral, the motion, and all
opposing and concurring statements. Except for good cause stated in the
order in which further action is taken, the judge shall make no further
orders and shall take no further action in the case after filing of the motion
and prior to a hearing on the motion.

Summary
Procedural requirements for handling recusal motions in Texas. It
emphasizes that once a recusal motion is filed, the judge must either recuse
themselves or refer the motion to the presiding judge of the administrative
judicial district. The judge is prohibited from taking further action in the
case until the recusal motion is resolved. This supports the proposition that
the court cannot proceed to a final trial while recusal motions are pending
and unresolved.
Rule 18a. Recusal and Disqualification of Judges
Extract
Restrictions on Further Action. (A) Motion Filed Before Evidence Offered at
Trial. If a motion is filed before evidence has been offered at trial, the
respondent judge must take no further action in the case until the motion
has been decided, except for good cause stated in writing or on the record.
Summary
If a motion for recusal is filed before evidence is offered at trial, the judge
must refrain from taking further action in the case until the motion is
resolved. This supports the proposition that unresolved recusal motions and
jurisdictional challenges must be addressed before proceeding to
substantive matters, such as a final trial. The rule ensures that any potential
bias or conflict of interest is resolved to maintain the integrity of the judicial
process.
