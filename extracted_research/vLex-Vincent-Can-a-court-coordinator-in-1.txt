Question
Can a court coordinator in Texas handle the transmission of referral orders in judicial recusal proceedings, or must this be performed by the judge or clerk under
Texas law and Texas Rules of Civil Procedure 18a?
Answer (Texas)
Short response
Based on Texas law and the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure 18a, a court coordinator cannot handle the transmission of referral orders in judicial recusal
proceedings; this duty must be performed by the judge or clerk as the relevant statutes and case law consistently specify that the judge must sign and file the
order with the clerk.
Summary
Texas law governing judicial recusal proceedings establishes a clear, mandatory procedure that must be followed when a motion to recuse is filed. Both statutory
provisions and extensive case law explicitly state that upon receiving a motion for recusal, the respondent judge must either sign and file an order of recusal or
sign and file an order referring the motion to the regional presiding judge. These responsibilities are specifically assigned to the judge, with the clerk playing a
supporting role in the filing process.
The legal framework does not contemplate or authorize court coordinators to handle the transmission of referral orders in recusal proceedings. Multiple Texas
appellate decisions have emphasized the mandatory nature of the recusal proceedings, noting that judges have a "mandatory duty" to either recuse themselves
or refer the motion to the presiding judge. The consistent language across statutes, rules, and judicial interpretations leaves no discretionary gap that would
permit delegation of these judicial functions to a court coordinator.
Background and Relevant Law
Statutory Provisions
The Texas Government Code contains specific provisions governing judicial recusal proceedings in different types of courts. For statutory probate courts, Tex.
Gov't Code § 25.00255 provides that when a presiding judge is the subject of a motion for recusal or disqualification, they "shall sign and file with the clerk an
order referring the motion to the chief justice of the supreme court for assignment of a presiding judge of an administrative judicial region, a statutory probate
court judge, or a former or retired judge of a statutory probate court to hear and rule on the motion." This language explicitly places the responsibility on the judge
to sign and file the order with the clerk.
Similarly, for municipal courts, Tex. Gov't Code § 29.055 states that a municipal judge who does not recuse or disqualify themselves "shall forward, in original
form or certified copy, an order of referral, the motion, and all opposing and concurring statements to the regional presiding judge." Again, the statutory language
assigns this duty directly to the judge, not to a court coordinator or other court staff.
Texas Rules of Civil Procedure
Rule 18a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure establishes procedures for recusal and disqualification of judges. While the full text of Rule 18a is not provided in
the sources, numerous case law references clarify its requirements and consistently indicate that the responsibility for signing and transmitting referral orders lies
with the judge, not a court coordinator.
Case Law Interpretation
Texas courts have consistently interpreted the relevant statutes and Rule 18a as placing the responsibility for handling recusal motions directly on judges. The
Texas Court of Appeals in In re Burns explained that "A respondent judge, within three business days after a motion to recuse is filed, must sign and file with the
clerk (1) an order of recusal or disqualification; or (2) an order referring the motion to the regional presiding judge. Tex.R.Civ.P. 18a(f)."
Similarly, in Caballero v. Vig, 600 S.W.3d 452 (Tex. App. 2020), the court stated that "Rule 18a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure provides that if the
respondent judge does not sign an order of recusal upon receiving a motion to recuse, he or she must 'sign and file with the clerk an order referring the motion to
the regional presiding judge,' who in turn must rule on the motion or assign a judge to rule on it. Tex.R.Civ.P. 18a(f)(1)(B)."
The mandatory nature of these procedures is emphasized in In re Thompson, 330 S.W.3d 411 (Tex. App. 2010), where the court noted that "Tex.R. Civ. P. 18a
(requiring that, on filing of motion to recuse, judge must take no further action in case and either (1) recuse himself, or (2) forward motion to presiding judge of
administrative judicial district for hearing)." The court further explained that "Other courts of appeals have concluded that Rule 18a's recusal-or-referral
requirement is mandatory and that mandamus relief is appropriate to compel compliance with the rule."
Analysis of Judge's Role in Recusal Proceedings
Mandatory Duty of the Judge
Multiple Texas courts have characterized the judge's responsibility in recusal proceedings as a "mandatory duty." The Texas Supreme Court, as referenced in In
re Thompson, 330 S.W.3d 411 (Tex. App. 2010), held that "a judge has 'the mandatory duty' to recuse himself or refer the matter to the presiding judge to hear a
properly filed motion to recuse, and (2) mandamus relief is proper to compel compliance."

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
This mandatory duty was also emphasized in Hudson v. Texas Children's Hosp., 177 S.W.3d 232 (Tex. 2005), where the Texas Supreme Court stated that "Once
a motion to recuse is filed in statutory probate court, the trial judge has two options before taking any other action: (1) recuse himself or (2) request that the
presiding judge of the statutory probate courts assign a judge to hear the motion to recuse." The court explicitly characterized this procedure as "mandatory."
Similarly, in In re Norman, 191 S.W.3d 858 (Tex. App. 2006), the court noted that "Under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a, Judge Austin had a mandatory duty
either to recuse himself or to refer the recusal motion to the presiding judge." The court also referenced Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 74.059(c)(3), which states that a
judge "shall 'request the presiding judge to assign another judge to hear a motion relating to the recusal of the judge from a case pending in his court.'"
Judge's Personal Responsibility for Referral Orders
The case law consistently emphasizes that the judge personally must handle the referral of recusal motions. In Carson v. Gomez, 841 S.W.2d 491 (Tex. App.
1992), the court quoted Rule 18a(d): "If the judge declines to recuse himself, he shall forward to the presiding judge of the administrative judicial district, in either
original form or certified copy, an order of referral, the motion, and all opposing and concurring statements."
This language is echoed in Bruno v. State, 916 S.W.2d 4 (Tex. App. 1995), which similarly quotes Rule 18a(d) as stating that "If the judge declines to recuse
himself, he shall forward to the presiding judge of the administrative judicial district ... an order of referral, the motion, and all opposing and concurring
statements."
The specificity of these requirements and the consistent use of the pronoun "he" referring to the judge indicates that this duty is personal to the judge and cannot
be delegated to other court personnel such as a court coordinator.
Limited Options for the Judge
Texas courts have repeatedly emphasized that judges have limited options when faced with a recusal motion. In Carson v. Gomez, 841 S.W.2d 491 (Tex. App.
1992), the court stated plainly: "Once a motion to recuse has been filed, the trial judge has only two options, recusal or referral. TEX.R.CIV.P. 18a(c)."
This limitation was similarly expressed in In re PG & E Reata Energy, et al, 4 S.W.3d 897 (Tex. App. 1999), which stated that Rule 18a "requires the judge
against whom a proper recusal motion is filed to either grant the motion or request the Presiding Judge to assign another judge to hear the motion."
The narrow scope of permissible actions following a recusal motion further indicates that the procedure is strictly defined and does not allow for delegation of
responsibilities to court coordinators or other staff not specifically mentioned in the relevant provisions.
Analysis of Clerk's Role in Recusal Proceedings
While the judge is primarily responsible for handling recusal motions, the clerk also plays a defined role in the process. Multiple sources indicate that the judge
must "sign and file with the clerk" the relevant orders.
For example, In re Burns states that a respondent judge "must sign and file with the clerk (1) an order of recusal or disqualification; or (2) an order referring the
motion to the regional presiding judge." Similarly, Tex. Gov't Code § 25.00255 requires that a presiding judge who is the subject of a recusal motion "shall sign
and file with the clerk an order referring the motion to the chief justice of the supreme court."
These provisions indicate that the clerk's role is to receive and process the filed orders, not to transmit the referral orders themselves. The transmission of the
referral order to the regional presiding judge appears to be the responsibility of the judge, as indicated by Tex. Gov't Code § 29.055, which states that the
municipal judge "shall forward... an order of referral, the motion, and all opposing and concurring statements to the regional presiding judge."
Absence of Court Coordinator's Role in the Legal Framework
Significantly, none of the provided statutory provisions or case law mentions any role for court coordinators in the recusal process. The absence of any reference
to court coordinators in this context suggests that they are not legally authorized to handle the transmission of referral orders in judicial recusal proceedings.
This omission is particularly notable given the specificity with which the statutes and rules describe the roles of judges and clerks in the process. If court
coordinators were intended to have a role in transmitting referral orders, one would expect this to be explicitly stated in the relevant provisions.
Moreover, in In re Moore, NUMBER 13-19-00551-CV (Tex. App. Dec 19, 2019), the court explicitly stated that "Rule 18a offers no third option whereby a judge
other than the regional presiding judge can handle matters following recusal." This strongly suggests that the handling of recusal matters is strictly limited to the
judge and the regional presiding judge, with no provisions for delegation to court coordinators.
The Authority to Assign Judges Following Recusal
The case law also clarifies that the authority to assign judges following a recusal lies exclusively with the presiding judge of the administrative judicial district. In In
re Alpert, 276 S.W.3d 592 (Tex. App. 2008), the court stated that "Rule 18a(f) expressly confers the authority to reassign a case following a recusal to the
regional presiding judge of the administrative judicial district..." The court further noted that "Both the Texas Government Code and Texas Rules of Civil
Procedure vest the 'presiding judge of the administrative judicial district' with the authority to assign a judge to hear a motion for recusal."
Similarly, in Ex parte Thuesen, 546 S.W.3d 145 (Tex. Crim. App. 2017), the court observed that "Rule 18a additionally provides that, when a recusal is granted,
the presiding judge of the administrative judicial region 'must transfer the case to another court or assign another judge to the case.'"
These cases further reinforce the conclusion that the handling of referral orders and the assignment of cases following recusal are judicial functions that cannot
be delegated to court coordinators.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Judicial Actions Following Recusal Motions
The legal framework also places strict limitations on the actions a judge can take after a recusal motion is filed. According to Jamilah v. Bass, 862 S.W.2d 201
(Tex. App. 1993), "Except for good cause stated in the order in which such action is taken, the judge shall make no further orders and shall take no further action
in the case except for good cause stated in the order in which such action is taken."
Similarly, In re Thompson, 330 S.W.3d 411 (Tex. App. 2010) states that upon filing of a motion to recuse, the "judge must take no further action in case" except to
either recuse himself or forward the motion to the presiding judge.
These limitations further suggest that the handling of recusal matters is strictly controlled and does not allow for delegation to court coordinators or other court
personnel.
Consequences of Non-Compliance with Recusal Procedures
Texas courts have emphasized the serious consequences of failing to follow the proper procedures in recusal motions. In In re Thompson, 330 S.W.3d 411 (Tex.
App. 2010), the court noted that "mandamus relief is appropriate to compel compliance with the rule."
Similarly, in In re Norman, 191 S.W.3d 858 (Tex. App. 2006), the court granted mandamus relief to compel a judge to comply with the mandatory duty to either
recuse himself or refer the recusal motion to the presiding judge.
These cases highlight the importance of strictly following the prescribed procedures for handling recusal motions and suggest that delegation of these
responsibilities to court coordinators could potentially violate the requirements of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure and relevant statutes.
Exceptions and Caveats
While the legal framework consistently assigns responsibility for handling recusal motions to judges and clerks, there might be administrative practices in some
Texas courts where court coordinators assist in the process. However, even if such practices exist, the provided legal authorities do not suggest that court
coordinators have the legal authority to independently handle the transmission of referral orders in judicial recusal proceedings.
It is also worth noting that the specific language of Rule 18a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure might have been amended since some of the older cases cited.
However, the consistent interpretation across multiple cases and the absence of any contradicting recent authority suggest that the basic requirement for judges
to personally handle recusal motions remains unchanged.
Conclusion
Based on the provided legal authorities, a court coordinator in Texas cannot handle the transmission of referral orders in judicial recusal proceedings. The Texas
Government Code, the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, and extensive case law consistently specify that this responsibility lies with the judge, who must either
sign and file an order of recusal or sign and file an order referring the motion to the regional presiding judge.
The legal framework establishes a clear procedure: upon receiving a motion to recuse, the judge must either recuse themselves or refer the motion to the
presiding judge of the administrative judicial district. This duty is characterized as "mandatory" by multiple courts, including the Texas Supreme Court. The judge
must sign and file the relevant orders with the clerk, but the responsibility for forwarding the referral order to the presiding judge appears to rest with the judge, not
the clerk or a court coordinator.
None of the provided legal authorities mentions any role for court coordinators in this process. Given the specificity with which the statutes and rules describe the
roles of judges and clerks, and the courts' emphasis on the mandatory nature of these procedures, it appears that court coordinators are not legally authorized to
handle the transmission of referral orders in judicial recusal proceedings.
Therefore, under Texas law and Texas Rules of Civil Procedure 18a, the transmission of referral orders in judicial recusal proceedings must be performed by the
judge or clerk, not by a court coordinator.

Dunn v. County of Dallas, 794 S.W.2d 560 (Tex. App. 1990)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
A fair reading of rules 18a and 18b suggests that in the event a judge should elect to recuse under either section, two things are required: (1) an order of recusal,
and (2) a request to the administrative judge of the district to assign another judge to sit. Except for good cause stated in the order in which any further action is
taken, the judge can make no further orders.
Summary
The Texas Rules of Civil Procedure 18a and 18b require specific actions by the judge in the event of a recusal. The judge must issue an order of recusal and
request the administrative judge to assign another judge. The passage does not mention the role of a court coordinator in this process, suggesting that the
responsibility lies with the judge.

As stated previously, relator's plea in intervention and motion to transfer were originally submitted to Judge Ramirez; however, Judge Ramirez recused himself
and referred the matter to the regional presiding judge in accordance with Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a(f). See TEX. R. CIV. P. 18a(f). Under Rule 18a(f),
the regional presiding judge had the authority to assign a judge to rule. See id. R. 18a(g). Rule 18a offers no third option whereby a judge other than the regional

Summary
The passage from "In re Moore" clarifies that under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a, after a judge recuses themselves, the authority to handle the
reassignment of the case lies with the regional presiding judge. The rule does not provide an option for a court coordinator or any other party to handle the
transmission of referral orders in such proceedings. This indicates that the process must be performed by the judge or clerk, as the rule is mandatory and does
not allow for delegation to a court coordinator.

Bruno v. State, 916 S.W.2d 4 (Tex. App. 1995)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Rule 18a addresses the requirements of a motion for recusal or disqualification of trial court judges. See TEX.R.CIV.P. 18a. The rule provides: ... (d) If the judge
declines to recuse himself, he shall forward to the presiding judge of the administrative judicial district ... an order of referral, the motion, and all opposing and
concurring statements. Except for good cause stated in the order in which further action is taken, the judge shall make no further orders and shall take no further
action in the case after filing of the motion and prior to a hearing on the motion.
Summary
The passage from Rule 18a(d) explicitly states that if a judge declines to recuse themselves, they are responsible for forwarding the order of referral, the motion,
and all related statements to the presiding judge of the administrative judicial district. This indicates that the responsibility lies with the judge, not a court
coordinator, to handle the transmission of referral orders in judicial recusal proceedings.

Texas Supreme Court
Extract
Once a motion to recuse is filed in statutory probate court, the trial judge has two options before taking any other action: (1) recuse himself or (2) request that the
presiding judge of the statutory probate courts assign a judge to hear the motion to recuse. Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 25.00255(f) (Vernon 2004); TEX.R. CIV. P.
18a(c). The Texas Supreme Court has held that the recuse or refer procedure is mandatory.
Summary
When a motion to recuse is filed, the trial judge has specific mandatory actions to take: either recuse themselves or refer the motion to the presiding judge. This
suggests that the responsibility for handling the referral orders in judicial recusal proceedings lies with the judge, as they must either recuse themselves or initiate
the referral process. The passage does not mention a court coordinator's role in this process, implying that the coordinator is not authorized to handle the
transmission of referral orders.

mention any role for a court coordinator in this process.
Tex. Gov't. Code § 29.055 Tex. Gov't. Code § 29.055 Procedure Following Filing of Motion; Recusal Or Disqualification Without Motion
Extract
A municipal judge who does not recuse or disqualify himself or herself: shall forward, in original form or certified copy, an order of referral, the motion, and all
opposing and concurring statements to the regional presiding judge; and may not take other action in the case during the time after the filing of the motion for
recusal or disqualification and before a hearing on the motion, except for good cause stated in the order in which the action is taken.
Summary
The responsibility to forward an order of referral, the motion, and all opposing and concurring statements to the regional presiding judge lies with the municipal
judge who does not recuse or disqualify themselves. The passage does not mention a court coordinator or clerk being involved in this process, indicating that it is
the judge's responsibility.

Extract
When a recusal motion is filed, the trial judge against whom the motion is directed may properly make an initial decision of whether the motion is sufficient to
invoke Rule 18a. See Arnold (no error in not referring motion to recuse not timely filed); McDuffie v. State, 854 S.W.2d 195 (Tex.App.—Beaumont 1993, pet.
ref’d). Once a sufficient motion to recuse has been filed, before proceeding further in the... A judge does not have authority to take any further action after signing
a voluntary recusal order. Ex parte Thuesen, 546 S.W.3d 145, 147 (Tex. Crim. App. 2017). Interim or ancillary orders made by a regional presiding judge
regarding the recusal of a trial judge—or the reinstatement or modification of judicial authority following a recusal—must be made in writing, signed by the
presiding judge, and entered of record in the case. Ex parte Thuesen, 546 S.W.3d at 156.
Summary
Once a recusal motion is filed, the trial judge must determine its sufficiency under Rule 18a. If a judge voluntarily recuses, they cannot take further action, and any
interim or ancillary orders must be made in writing and signed by the presiding judge. This suggests that the handling of referral orders in recusal proceedings
involves judicial actions and formal documentation, implying that such tasks are typically within the purview of judges or clerks, not court coordinators.
