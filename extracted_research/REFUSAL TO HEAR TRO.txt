Question
The litigant requested an emergency Temporary Restraining Order (TRO)
and appeared for a scheduled hearing before the associate judge. The
associate judge un-set the hearing and refused to hear the TRO, stating that
the opposing attorney would be filing a consolidation motion later. The
litigant left the courthouse without any order being entered or any
opportunity to present his emergency request. Under both the United States
Constitution (Fourteenth Amendment) and the Texas Constitution (Art. I, §
19), due process requires that a party be given notice and a meaningful
opportunity to be heard before being deprived of a substantial right. Texas
Rule of Civil Procedure 680 provides that a TRO may be granted without
notice to the adverse party only if it clearly appears from specific facts
shown by affidavit or verified complaint that immediate and irreparable
injury will result before notice can be served and a hearing had. By refusing
to hear the emergency TRO and un-setting the hearing solely because of a
potential future motion by the opposing party, the associate judge deprived
the litigant of his right to a meaningful opportunity to be heard on his
emergency request, thus violating due process.
Answer (Texas)
Short response
The associate judge’s refusal to hear the litigant’s emergency Temporary
Restraining Order (TRO) and un-setting of the scheduled hearing, based
solely on a potential future motion by the opposing party, deprived the
litigant of the meaningful opportunity to be heard required by both the
United States and Texas Constitutions, as well as by Texas procedural law.
This conduct constitutes a violation of due process and an abuse of
discretion under controlling Texas authority.
Summary
Both the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and
Article I, Section 19 of the Texas Constitution guarantee that no person may
be deprived of substantial rights without due process of law, which includes
notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard. Texas law, including Rule
680 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure and relevant case law, further
mandates that courts must promptly consider and rule on properly filed
emergency requests such as TROs, and that refusal to do so—especially for
reasons unrelated to the merits or urgency of the request—violates both
procedural and constitutional due process.
In this scenario, the associate judge’s decision to un-set the hearing and
refuse to consider the emergency TRO, based solely on the prospect of a
future consolidation motion by the opposing party, denied the litigant the
required opportunity to present his case for emergency relief. Texas

appellate courts have repeatedly held that such refusals are an abuse of
discretion, remediable by mandamus, and that due process is not satisfied
by procedural maneuvers that prevent a party from being heard on urgent
matters. The judge’s actions here are inconsistent with both the letter and
spirit of Texas law and constitutional due process.
Background and Relevant Law
Constitutional Guarantees
United States Constitution, Fourteenth Amendment
The Fourteenth Amendment prohibits states from depriving any person of
life, liberty, or property without due process of law. Due process, as
interpreted by both federal and Texas courts, requires that a party be given
notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard before being deprived of a
substantial right. The Texas Supreme Court has expressly adopted this
standard, emphasizing that the opportunity to be heard must be both timely
and meaningful, particularly where urgent or substantial rights are at stake,
such as in emergency injunctive proceedings (Mayhew v. Town of Sunnyvale,
964 S.W.2d 922, 928 (Tex. 1998); University of Texas Medical School at
Houston v. Than, 874 S.W.2d 839, 842 (Tex. App. 1994)). Although the
validity of Mayhew has been questioned in later cases, its articulation of the
basic due process requirement remains widely cited and has not been
overruled on this point.
Texas Constitution, Article I, Section 19
The Texas Constitution’s due course of law provision mirrors the federal due
process guarantee, requiring that no citizen be deprived of life, liberty,
property, privileges, or immunities except by the law of the land (Tex. Const.
art. I, § 19). Texas courts interpret this as requiring fair procedures,
including a meaningful opportunity to be heard before deprivation of
substantial rights.
Statutory and Procedural Framework
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 680
Rule 680 governs the issuance of Temporary Restraining Orders in Texas
civil courts. It provides that a TRO may not be granted without notice to the
adverse party unless specific facts, shown by affidavit or verified complaint,
demonstrate that immediate and irreparable injury will occur before notice
can be served and a hearing held. When a TRO is granted without notice,
the application for a temporary injunction must be set for hearing at the
earliest possible date and take precedence over other matters, and the court
must hear and determine any motion to dissolve or modify the TRO as
expeditiously as justice requires (Rule 680, Tex. R. Civ. P.). This rule reflects
a strong policy favoring prompt judicial consideration of emergency relief
and a meaningful opportunity for all parties to be heard.
Texas Family Code Section 105.001
In the context of family law, Section 105.001 of the Texas Family Code
authorizes temporary restraining orders and temporary injunctions and

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
underscores the importance of prompt hearings on such emergency relief.
The statute generally requires that orders be rendered only after notice and
a hearing, and limits the court’s ability to postpone initial hearings,
reflecting a legislative intent to prevent undue delay in access to emergency
relief (Tex. Fam. Code § 105.001).
Case Law
Texas appellate courts have consistently held that trial courts have a
ministerial duty to consider and rule on properly filed and presented
motions, especially those seeking emergency relief. Refusal to do so is an
abuse of discretion and may be remedied by mandamus.
In In re Diana, 13-24-00287-CV (Tex. App. Jun 28, 2024), the court held
that a trial court’s refusal to set a hearing or rule on a properly filed
motion—regardless of pending appeals or other procedural
developments—constitutes an abuse of discretion. The court
emphasized that litigants are entitled to a hearing on urgent matters
and that refusal to provide one deprives them of a meaningful
opportunity to be heard.
In re Dupuy (Tex. App. Aug. 31, 2023) reaffirmed that trial courts must
rule on properly filed motions within a reasonable time, and that this is
a ministerial, not discretionary, duty. Mandamus may issue to compel
the court to act when it fails or refuses to do so.
In re Raines, No. 10-19-00376-CR (Tex. App. Oct 30, 2019) and In re
Keeter, No. 10-19-00277-CR (Tex. App. Aug 28, 2019) both held that
when a litigant brings a properly filed request for relief to the court’s
attention, the court must consider and rule on it within a reasonable
time. Refusal to do so, especially in the context of emergency relief, is a
failure to perform a ministerial duty.
In re Blakeney, 254 S.W.3d 659 (Tex. App. 2008) and In re Christensen,
39 S.W.3d 250 (Tex. App. 2000) further confirm that courts are required
to consider and rule on pending motions, and that due process
mandates an opportunity to be heard. Mandamus is available to compel
action when a court refuses to hold a hearing or render a decision.
Chiles v. Schuble, 788 S.W.2d 205 (Tex. App. 1990) found that a trial
judge’s refusal to entertain a hearing on a motion for emergency relief
was an abuse of discretion, and the appellate court ordered the judge
to hold a hearing and exercise discretion.
In re V.K., 607 S.W.3d 471 (Tex. App. 2020) and In re Glenny,
03-25-00412-CV (Tex. App. Jun 24, 2025) both held that when a statute
requires a prompt, live hearing on urgent relief, a court’s refusal to
conduct such a hearing violates both statutory and constitutional due
process. Administrative or scheduling considerations do not justify
denial of a hearing.

T.L. v. Cook Children's Med. Ctr., 607 S.W.3d 9 (Tex. App. 2020) and 
Buchanan v. Androderm X, LLC, 01-24-00762-CV (Tex. App. Nov 25,
2025) both emphasize that due process requires not just notice, but a
meaningful opportunity to be heard, including the ability to present and
rebut evidence, especially when substantial rights are at stake.
In re Cnty. of Hidalgo, 655 S.W.3d 44 (Tex. App. 2022) and In re Abbott,
628 S.W.3d 288 (Tex. 2021) reinforce that the procedural requirements
for TROs are mandatory and designed to ensure prompt, meaningful
judicial consideration of emergency relief.
Analysis
The Right to a Meaningful Opportunity to Be Heard
The core principle underlying both federal and Texas due process is that a
party must be given a meaningful opportunity to be heard before being
deprived of a substantial right. This is not a mere formality; the opportunity
must be real, timely, and effective, particularly in the context of emergency
relief where delay can itself cause irreparable harm (University of Texas
Medical School at Houston v. Than, 874 S.W.2d 839 (Tex. App. 1994); 
Mayhew v. Town of Sunnyvale, 964 S.W.2d 922 (Tex. 1998)).
Texas courts have repeatedly held that when a litigant properly files and
presents a request for emergency relief, such as a TRO, the court has a
ministerial duty to consider and rule on the request within a reasonable time
(In re Diana, 13-24-00287-CV (Tex. App. Jun 28, 2024); In re Dupuy (Tex.
App. Aug. 31, 2023); In re Raines, No. 10-19-00376-CR (Tex. App. Oct 30,
2019)). Refusal to do so, especially by un-setting a scheduled hearing and
declining to consider the request for reasons unrelated to the merits or
urgency of the application, constitutes a denial of due process and an abuse
of discretion.
Application to the Scenario
In the present scenario, the litigant appeared for a scheduled hearing on his
emergency TRO, but the associate judge un-set the hearing and refused to
consider the request, citing only the possibility that the opposing party
would file a consolidation motion at some future time. No order was entered,
and the litigant was given no opportunity to present his emergency request.
This conduct is directly contrary to the requirements of Rule 680, which
mandates that applications for emergency relief be set for hearing at the
earliest possible date and take precedence over other matters. The rule’s
structure reflects a policy of prompt, prioritized judicial attention to
emergency requests, and does not permit indefinite postponement or refusal
to hear such requests based on speculative future procedural developments
(Rule 680, Tex. R. Civ. P.; In re Cnty. of Hidalgo, 655 S.W.3d 44 (Tex. App.
2022)).

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
The judge’s refusal to hear the TRO also violates the ministerial duty
recognized in numerous Texas appellate decisions, which hold that courts
must consider and rule on properly filed and presented motions, especially
those seeking urgent relief (In re Diana, 13-24-00287-CV (Tex. App. Jun 28,
2024); In re Dupuy (Tex. App. Aug. 31, 2023); In re Blakeney, 254 S.W.3d
659 (Tex. App. 2008)). The refusal to act here is not justified by any
statutory or procedural rule, and is not excused by the mere possibility of a
future motion by the opposing party.
Moreover, the refusal to hear the TRO deprived the litigant of the
meaningful opportunity to be heard required by both the United States and
Texas Constitutions. As the courts have made clear, due process is not
satisfied by procedural maneuvers that prevent a party from being heard on
urgent matters (T.L. v. Cook Children's Med. Ctr., 607 S.W.3d 9 (Tex. App.
2020); Buchanan v. Androderm X, LLC, 01-24-00762-CV (Tex. App. Nov 25,
2025)). The opportunity to be heard must be real and effective, not illusory
or subject to indefinite postponement.
Mandamus and Remedies
Texas appellate courts have consistently held that when a trial court refuses
to consider and rule on a properly filed and presented motion for emergency
relief, mandamus is the appropriate remedy (In re Diana, 13-24-00287-CV
(Tex. App. Jun 28, 2024); In re Dupuy (Tex. App. Aug. 31, 2023); In re
Blakeney, 254 S.W.3d 659 (Tex. App. 2008); Chiles v. Schuble, 788 S.W.2d
205 (Tex. App. 1990)). The courts have repeatedly ordered trial judges to
hold hearings and exercise discretion on such motions, and have found that
refusal to do so is an abuse of discretion.
The Role of Anticipated Future Filings
The associate judge’s stated reason for refusing to hear the TRO—the
anticipated filing of a consolidation motion by the opposing party—does not
justify the refusal to provide a hearing. Texas law does not permit a court to
deny a party’s right to be heard on an emergency request based on
speculative future procedural developments. The duty to consider and rule
on properly filed motions is not suspended or excused by the possibility of
future filings (In re Diana, 13-24-00287-CV (Tex. App. Jun 28, 2024); In re
Dupuy (Tex. App. Aug. 31, 2023)). The proper course, if consolidation is later
granted, is to address the emergency request in the consolidated
proceeding, but not to deny the party a hearing in the interim.
Family Law Context
Although the scenario does not specify whether the underlying case is a
family law matter, the principles discussed above apply with equal force in
that context. Section 105.001 of the Texas Family Code underscores the
importance of prompt hearings on emergency relief in family law cases and
limits the court’s ability to postpone such hearings (Tex. Fam. Code §
105.001). The courts have held that refusal to hold a required hearing on
emergency relief in family law cases is an abuse of discretion and violates

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
due process (In re V.K., 607 S.W.3d 471 (Tex. App. 2020); In re Glenny,
03-25-00412-CV (Tex. App. Jun 24, 2025)).
Exceptions and Caveats
There may be rare circumstances where a court is justified in postponing or
refusing to hear a motion for emergency relief, such as when the motion is
not properly filed, is moot, or the court lacks jurisdiction. However, none of
these exceptions apply where, as here, the litigant appeared for a scheduled
hearing on a properly filed emergency TRO and the only reason for refusal
was the possibility of a future motion by the opposing party.
It should also be noted that while Mayhew v. Town of Sunnyvale, 964 S.W.2d
922 (Tex. 1998) has been questioned in later cases, its articulation of the
basic due process requirement—notice and a meaningful opportunity to be
heard—remains good law and is consistent with both federal and Texas
constitutional jurisprudence.
Conclusion
The associate judge’s refusal to hear the litigant’s emergency TRO and un-
setting of the scheduled hearing, based solely on the prospect of a future
consolidation motion, violated the litigant’s right to a meaningful
opportunity to be heard as required by both the United States and Texas
Constitutions and by Texas procedural law. Texas courts have repeatedly
held that trial courts have a ministerial duty to consider and rule on properly
filed emergency motions, and that refusal to do so is an abuse of discretion
and a denial of due process. The judge’s actions in this scenario are
inconsistent with the requirements of Rule 680, the Texas Family Code, and
controlling Texas appellate authority, and would support mandamus or other
extraordinary relief to compel the court to hold a hearing and exercise
discretion on the emergency request.

Summary
The passage articulates the core due process requirement—notice and a
meaningful opportunity to be heard—citing U.S. Supreme Court authority,
and the Texas Supreme Court adopts and applies that standard. This
supports arguing that refusing to hear a duly set emergency TRO, thereby
denying an opportunity to be heard on imminent harm, violates procedural
due process.
University of Texas Medical School at Houston v. Than, 874 S.W.2d 839 (Tex.
App. 1994)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Due process requires an opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in
a meaningful manner. Armstrong v. Manzo, 380 U.S. 545, 552, 85 S.Ct. 1187,
1191, 14 L.Ed.2d 62 (1965)." ... "The School has already given Than an
opportunity to be heard. Through no fault of Than's, the opportunity
provided by the School violated due process. For the reasons set out above,
we believe that another hearing this late would be constitutionally futile.
Summary
The quoted language articulates the core due process requirement—an
opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.
The case applies that standard to find that a procedurally deficient hearing
violated due process and that a delayed cure could be constitutionally
inadequate. This supports arguing that un-setting and refusing to hear an
emergency TRO—where timing is crucial—deprived the litigant of a
meaningful opportunity to be heard, violating federal and Texas due process
guarantees.
T.L. v. Cook Children's Med. Ctr., 607 S.W.3d 9 (Tex. App. 2020)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits the
State of Texas from 'depriv[ing] any person of life[ or] liberty ... without due
process of law.' ... VII. By Demonstrating a Lack of Reasonable Notice and a
Meaningful Opportunity to Be Heard, Mother Has Shown a Probable Right
to Relief on Her Procedural-Due-Process Claim ... 1. T.L. and Mother did not
receive reasonable notice or a meaningful opportunity to be heard ... More
particularly, the constitutional adequacy of both notice and the opportunity
to be heard depends upon the nature of the case. ... For example, when the

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
action or decision turns on the evaluation of evidence, reasonable notice and
a meaningful opportunity to be heard require that interested parties be
permitted time to obtain and present witnesses and documentary evidence
in support of their interests, as well as an opportunity to cross-examine and
rebut witnesses and documentary evidence adverse to their interests. ... We
therefore conclude that Mother has shown a probable right to relief on her
claim that she was denied meaningful notice and an opportunity to heard.
Summary
The case squarely holds that due process requires reasonable notice and a
meaningful opportunity to be heard before deprivation of significant rights,
and emphasizes the necessity of an actual opportunity to present and rebut
evidence. This supports the argument that un-setting an emergency hearing
and refusing to consider a TRO—thereby providing no opportunity to be
heard—violates procedural due process under both constitutions.
In re Christensen, 39 S.W.3d 250 (Tex. App. 2000)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Consideration of a motion properly filed and before a trial court is
ministerial. ... Fundamental requirements of due process mandate an
opportunity to be heard. ... Thus, a district court may be compelled via
mandamus to consider and rule on a pending motion presented to the court.
Summary
The court states that when a motion is properly filed and before the court,
the judge has a ministerial duty to consider it. It further ties this to due
process, which mandates an opportunity to be heard. If a court refuses to
consider and rule on a properly presented motion, mandamus may issue to
compel consideration and a ruling. Applied here, the associate judge’s
refusal to hear the properly filed emergency TRO and un-setting the hearing
because of a potential future filing denies the litigant the mandated
opportunity to be heard and the court’s ministerial duty to consider and
rule, supporting a due-process violation and mandamus relief.

207 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 1990, orig. proceeding) (mandamus an
appropriate remedy to require trial court to hold hearing and exercise
discretion).
Summary
The court recognizes a duty of trial courts to consider and rule on properly
filed motions within a reasonable time. Refusing to conduct a hearing and
render a decision on a motion is an abuse of discretion. Mandamus can
compel the court to hold a hearing and exercise discretion. Applied to an
emergency TRO set for hearing, the associate judge’s un-setting and refusal
to hear the motion because of a potential future filing mirrors the
condemned conduct—refusing to conduct a hearing and render a decision—
supporting an argument that the litigant was denied a meaningful
opportunity to be heard and that mandamus relief is appropriate.
Perry v. Perry
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Failure to give the notice required by Section 157.062 does not render the
proceeding void unless the lack of notice amounts to a denial of
constitutional due process." ... (citing Ex parte Davis ... noting that "holding
of the hearing in less than ten days after service of notice may constitute a
denial of due process[]" and that the purpose of the ten day notice
requirement is "to afford the defaulting party a reasonable opportunity to
employ counsel, gather evidence, subpoena witnesses and prepare for
trial[]") ... "In determining whether the failure to give the required notice
amounts to a denial of constitutional due process, '[e]ach case must be
judged upon its own facts.'
Summary
The appellate court emphasizes that due process focuses on ensuring a
meaningful opportunity to be heard. It cites Ex parte Davis for the principle
that truncating or denying procedural opportunities (e.g., by inadequate
notice or timing) can amount to a due process violation because it deprives a
party of a reasonable chance to present their case. Although the cited
section addresses enforcement and notice, the core due-process reasoning—
that courts must afford a meaningful opportunity to be heard and that
procedural actions that prevent that opportunity can violate due process—
supports an argument that refusing to hear a duly presented emergency
TRO based on a speculative future motion denies that meaningful
opportunity, thus offending due process.

In re V.K., 607 S.W.3d 471 (Tex. App. 2020)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Section 83.004 provides that '[a]ny individual affected by a temporary ex
parte order may file a motion at any time to vacate the order.' ... 'On the
filing of the motion to vacate, the court shall set a date for hearing the
motion as soon as possible.' ... We hold that under the unambiguous
language of section 83.004 the Legislature requires that the trial court hold
a live evidentiary hearing on a motion to vacate a temporary ex parte
protective order. ... The trial court's refusal to conduct an evidentiary
hearing violates the Legislature's statutory mandate that motions to vacate
be decided in a live, evidentiary hearing, not by submission. ... To the extent
the trial court relied upon the Supreme Court of Texas's COVID-19
Emergency Orders and purported to modify or suspend the procedure for
reviewing and ruling on relator's motion to vacate the Order so as to deny
relator his statutory right to a live evidentiary hearing, the trial court
violated relator's constitutional due process rights in doing so.
Summary
The case holds that when the Legislature requires a prompt, live hearing on
urgent protective-order relief, a court may not deny that hearing; doing so
violates both the statute and due process. Although In re V.K. addresses
motions to vacate ex parte protective orders, its core holding—that refusing
to conduct the required live hearing on emergent injunctive-type relief
violates due process—supports the proposition that un-setting and refusing
to hear an emergency TRO request deprives a litigant of a meaningful
opportunity to be heard. The court also rejects reliance on administrative or
scheduling considerations to avoid a hearing, reinforcing that constitutional
due process limits such refusals.
In re Abbott, 628 S.W.3d 288 (Tex. 2021)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
Consistent with these principles, Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 680 permits
issuance of a TRO 'without notice to the adverse party' only when 'it clearly
appears from specific facts shown by affidavit or by verified complaint that
immediate and irreparable injury, loss, or damage will result to the applicant
before notice can be served and a hearing had thereon.' ... The TRO suffers
an additional deficiency as well. Even assuming that immediate and
irreparable injury was imminent on August 8, it remained the responsibility
of the TRO applicant and the court to notify and hear from the opposing

party if at all possible. Because an adversarial process is always preferable
when it is possible, even in emergencies, the rules of procedure require the
district court to explain, in the TRO, 'why the order was granted without
notice' to the opposing party. TEX. R. CIV. P. 680.
Summary
The Court emphasizes that Rule 680 strictly conditions ex parte TROs and
that an adversarial hearing should be held if possible, reflecting a due-
process preference for a meaningful opportunity to be heard on emergency
relief. This supports arguing that summarily refusing to hear an emergency
TRO—particularly for docket-management or anticipated future filings—
denies the litigant that meaningful opportunity.
In re Cnty. of Hidalgo, 655 S.W.3d 44 (Tex. App. 2022)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Temporary restraining orders are subject to the requirements of the Texas
Rules of Civil Procedure. See TEX. R. CIV. P. 680, 683, 684. These procedural
requirements are mandatory, and an order granting a temporary restraining
order that fails to meet these requirements is void. ... In summary, a trial
court issuing a temporary restraining order is required to: (1) state why the
order was granted without notice if it is granted ex parte; (2) state the
reasons for the issuance of the order by defining the injury and describing
why it is irreparable; (3) state the date the order expires and set a hearing
on a temporary injunction; and (4) set a bond. See TEX. R. CIV. P. 680, 683,
684 ... First, Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 680 provides that: 'No temporary
restraining order shall be granted without notice to the adverse party unless
it clearly appears from specific facts shown by affidavit or by the verified
complaint that immediate and irreparable injury, loss, or damage will result
to the applicant before notice can be served and a hearing had thereon.
Every temporary restraining order granted without notice shall ... define the
injury and state why it is irreparable and why the order was granted without
notice ....' ... The supreme court interprets the rules to require that every
temporary restraining order must 'set forth the reasons why the court
deems it proper to issue the writ to prevent injury to the applicant in the
interim; that is, the reasons why the court believes the applicant's probable
right will be endangered if the writ does not issue.'
Summary
The passages establish that Rule 680 imposes mandatory procedures for
TROs, including that ex parte relief is permitted only upon specific factual
showings of immediate and irreparable injury, and that courts must promptly
set hearings and state reasons. While the case focuses on invalidating a TRO
for noncompliance, its articulation of Rule 680 underscores that emergency
TRO practice is designed to ensure a prompt, meaningful opportunity to be

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
heard (or clearly justified ex parte relief if hearing cannot occur). Refusing
to hear an emergency TRO for a speculative future consolidation motion
frustrates the mandatory framework designed to safeguard immediate
access to TRO relief and the hearing requirement, supporting the due-
process argument that the litigant was denied a meaningful opportunity to
be heard on an emergency request.

Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Rule 681 provides that '[n]o temporary injunction shall be issued without
notice to the adverse party.' ... '[A] lack of notice violates basic principles of
due process.' ... 'The underlying basis for enactment of [Rule] 681 was the
recognition of an individual's fundamental right to due process of law.' ...
Rule 681's notice requirement impliedly requires that an adverse party be
provided an opportunity to be heard before the temporary injunction
issues. ... This means that an adverse party must be given 'an opportunity to
present [his] defenses and ... rest[] [his] case' before a temporary injunction
issues. ... [See] Kramer Trading ... (holding trial court abused its discretion
by issuing temporary injunction before enjoined party presented its
defense).
Summary
The court ties Texas Rule 681’s notice requirement to constitutional due
process and explicitly recognizes a party’s right to a meaningful opportunity
to be heard before temporary injunctive relief is issued. Although the case
discusses temporary injunctions rather than TROs, it grounds the hearing
right in due process and opportunity to be heard, which supports the
proposition that denying a scheduled opportunity to present an emergency
request undermines due process. The cited authorities (Highsmith, Peralta,
Great Lakes, Oertel, Kramer) reinforce the necessity of an opportunity to
present and rest one’s case before injunctive relief decisions. This supports
arguing that refusing to conduct the set hearing on the emergency request—
based solely on a potential future motion—deprived the litigant of the
meaningful opportunity to be heard required by due process.
In re Raines, No. 10-19-00376-CR (Tex. App. Oct 30, 2019)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The need to consider and rule on a properly filed and presented request for
relief is not a discretionary act but a ministerial one, and a trial court is

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
allowed a reasonable time within which to perform that act. ... The duty to
act, however, generally does not arise until the movant has brought the
request for relief to the trial judge's attention; and mandamus will not lie
unless the movant makes such a showing, and the trial judge then fails or
refuses to rule within a reasonable time.
Summary
When a litigant properly files and presents a request for relief (such as an
emergency TRO) and brings it to the judge’s attention, the court has a
ministerial duty—not discretion—to consider and rule, within a reasonable
time. Refusing to hear or rule, despite the request being presented,
constitutes a failure to perform a ministerial duty. Un-setting a noticed
hearing and refusing to consider the emergency TRO because of a potential
future filing by the other side reflects a refusal to rule after the matter was
brought to the court’s attention, fitting within mandamus standards. This
supports the due-process theory that the litigant was denied a meaningful
opportunity to be heard on urgent relief.
In re Keeter, No. 10-19-00277-CR (Tex. App. Aug 28, 2019)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
A court with mandamus authority 'will grant mandamus relief if relator can
demonstrate that the act sought to be compelled is purely 'ministerial' and
that relator has no other adequate legal remedy.'" ... "Consideration of a
motion properly filed and before the court is ministerial." ... "Mandamus may
issue to compel a trial court to rule on a motion which has been pending
before the court for...
Summary
(1) courts can be compelled by mandamus to perform ministerial acts; (2)
considering a properly filed motion is a ministerial act; and (3) mandamus
may issue to compel a trial court to rule on a motion that is before it.
Refusing to hear or consider a properly filed emergency TRO and un-setting
a hearing because of a possible future filing aligns with a refusal to perform
the ministerial duty to consider and rule on the motion, supporting the
argument that the litigant was denied a meaningful opportunity to be heard
and that extraordinary relief may be warranted.
In re Dupuy
Texas Court of Appeals

=== PAGE 14 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
The trial courts are required to rule 'within a reasonable time' on motions
that are properly filed. ... When a motion is properly filed and pending
before a trial court, the act of giving consideration to and ruling upon that
motion is a ministerial act, and mandamus may issue to compel the trial
court to act. ... To establish that the trial court abused its discretion by
failing to rule, the relator must show that the trial court: (1) had a legal duty
to perform a nondiscretionary act; (2) was asked to perform the act; and (3)
failed or refused to do so.
Summary
Texas trial courts have a ministerial duty to consider and rule on properly
filed motions within a reasonable time, and mandamus can compel action
when the court refuses to rule. In the TRO context, refusing to hear or rule—
especially by un-setting a noticed hearing due to a potential future filing—
fits a failure to perform this nondiscretionary act. That supports the
proposition that the associate judge’s refusal deprived the litigant of a
meaningful opportunity to be heard on an emergency request and supports a
due-process framing.
In re Gilmer, NO. 12-19-00383-CR (Tex. App. Dec 04, 2019)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
To obtain a writ of mandamus compelling a trial court to consider and rule
on a motion, the relator must show that the trial court (1) had a legal duty to
perform a nondiscretionary act, (2) was asked to perform the act, and (3)
failed or refused to do so. ... Generally, a trial court has a nondiscretionary
duty to consider and rule on a motion within a reasonable time. ... However,
a trial court cannot be expected to consider a motion not called to its
attention.
Summary
Texas appellate courts recognize that a trial court has a nondiscretionary
duty to consider and rule on properly presented motions within a reasonable
time, and mandamus is available when the court refuses. If the litigant
presented an emergency TRO and the associate judge un-set the hearing
and refused to hear it, that supports an argument that the court failed to
perform its nondiscretionary duty to consider and rule, satisfying mandamus
elements. While the passage does not itself address constitutional due
process or Rule 680, it supports the procedural predicate that refusing to
consider a properly presented emergency motion is an abuse correctable by
mandamus, which bolsters the due-process argument that the litigant was
denied a meaningful opportunity to be heard.

In re Diana, 13-24-00287-CV (Tex. App. Jun 28, 2024)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The trial court has a duty to consider and rule on motions properly filed and
pending before it, and mandamus may issue to compel the trial court to
act... 'A relator may demonstrate an inadequate remedy by appeal by
showing that a trial court has refused to set a hearing or rule on a proper
motion.' ... Here, relator contends that the trial court abused its discretion
by refusing to set a hearing... The trial court has refused to set a hearing on
relator's motion on grounds that an appeal of those orders is currently
pending... Further § 109.001(a) expressly contemplates that a hearing is
required under the specified circumstances. ... The Court... is of the opinion
that relator has met his burden to obtain relief. Accordingly, we conditionally
grant the petition for writ of mandamus, and we direct the trial court to
consider and rule on relator's motion for enforcement.
Summary
The court reaffirmed that a Texas trial court must consider and rule on
properly filed, pending motions and that refusal to set a hearing or rule can
warrant mandamus. The opinion rejected the trial court’s refusal to set a
hearing based on a pending appeal, emphasizing statutory and general
obligations to afford a hearing when required. This supports the argument
that a judge may not refuse to hear an emergency application (like a TRO)
based solely on anticipated or pending procedural developments by the
opposing party; doing so denies a meaningful opportunity to be heard. While
In re Diana concerns temporary orders/enforcement and § 109.001(a), its
core principle—that courts must hear and rule on properly filed urgent
motions and that refusal to set or hold a hearing is an abuse of discretion
remediable by mandamus—supports the due-process framing here.
In re Glenny, 03-25-00412-CV (Tex. App. Jun 24, 2025)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
In this petition for mandamus relief, Relator contends that granting a motion
to vacate a temporary ex parte protective order without a live, evidentiary
hearing violates Texas Family Code § 83.004 and thus constitutes an abuse
of discretion by the trial court. Relator also contends that mandamus is the
appropriate remedy because no adequate remedy exists on appeal. We agree
on both counts. Because this case is brought to preserve a statutory right to
legal process, the Relator does not have an adequate remedy at law, and
mandamus relief is appropriate. … Tex. Fam. Code § 83.004. 'On the filing of

=== PAGE 16 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
the motion to vacate, the court shall set a date for hearing the motion as
soon as possible.' … we … [infer] that the hearing need actually occur.
Indeed, our sister courts of appeal have both interpreted this section as
imposing a duty to hold such a hearing. See V.K., 607 S.W.3d at 479; In re
Goddard, … (mem. op.). … The Twelfth Court of Appeals also concluded that
a trial court abused its discretion by vacating a protective order without the
applicant receiving notice and an opportunity to be heard. … The court of
appeals ruled that vacating the temporary ex parte protective order without
a hearing was an abuse of discretion, because, among other factors, 'Section
83.004 would appear to require a hearing before vacating a protective
order.' … 'Given the remedial nature of Title IV of the Texas Family Code…
courts should broadly construe its provisions so as to effectuate its
humanitarian and preventative purposes.' … These humanitarian and
preventative purposes are best effectuated through giving an applicant for a
protective order the opportunity to participate in a hearing … before that
protective order is vacated. … Thus we hold the judge failed to correctly
apply Texas Family Code 83.004 and abused her discretion.
Summary
The court held it is an abuse of discretion to resolve or vacate urgent
protective-order relief without a live, evidentiary hearing, emphasizing a
statutory duty to promptly set and actually conduct a hearing and the
applicant’s right to notice and an opportunity to be heard. The opinion
recognizes mandamus as appropriate to vindicate the right to legal process
when a court denies a hearing. This directly parallels the proposition:
refusing to hear an emergency request (here, a TRO) and un-setting a
scheduled hearing deprives the applicant of a meaningful opportunity to be
heard, violating due process and constituting an abuse of discretion. Though
Glenny arises under Family Code protective orders rather than Rule 680
TROs, it reinforces the core due process principle and the requirement that
courts not deny emergency relief applications a prompt hearing based on
procedural maneuvers or anticipated future filings.

Summary
The court held it was an abuse of discretion for a trial judge to refuse to
entertain and set for hearing a motion seeking emergency-type relief
(enforcement of temporary orders). The appellate court granted mandamus
compelling the judge to hold a hearing and exercise discretion. This
supports the proposition that a court cannot simply refuse to hear an urgent
application and deny a litigant the opportunity to develop a record and be
heard. While Chiles addresses a motion to enforce temporary orders rather
than a TRO, the core principle—refusal to hold a hearing on a properly
presented urgent motion is an abuse of discretion warranting mandamus—
supports the due process argument that the litigant was denied a
meaningful opportunity to be heard when the associate judge un-set and
refused to hear the emergency TRO.
Tex. Const. art. 1 § 19 Tex. Const. art. 1 § 19 Deprivation of Life, Liberty,
Etc.; Due Course of Law
Extract
No citizen of this State shall be deprived of life, liberty, property, privileges
or immunities, or in any manner disfranchised, except by the due course of
the law of the land.
Summary
Section 19 guarantees that deprivations of protected interests must occur
only by “due course of the law of the land,” which Texas courts construe as
requiring fair procedures, including a meaningful opportunity to be heard.
Denying a scheduled emergency hearing and refusing to entertain a TRO
request based solely on a speculative future motion impedes procedural
fairness and access to the court’s process for protecting property or other
substantial interests from imminent harm, implicating Section 19’s
protection.
Tex. Fam. Code § 105.001 Tex. Fam. Code § 105.001 Temporary Orders
Before Final Order
Extract
Except as provided by Subsection (c), temporary restraining orders and
temporary injunctions under this section shall be granted without the
necessity of an affidavit or verified pleading stating specific facts showing
that immediate and irreparable injury, loss, or damage will result before
notice can be served and a hearing can be held. Except as provided by
Subsection (h), an order may not be rendered under Subsection (a), , or
except after notice and a hearing." ... "(a-1) If the court on its own motion
refers to mediation a suit in which an initial hearing regarding the rendition

=== PAGE 18 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
of a temporary order described by Subsection (a) has not yet occurred, the
court may not postpone the hearing to a date that is later than the 30th day
after the date set for the hearing.
Summary
Section 105.001 authorizes temporary restraining orders and temporary
injunctions in SAPCRs and sets procedural guardrails. It indicates TROs and
temporary injunctions “shall be granted” without the usual affidavit
requirements unique to SAPCRs, signaling availability of swift emergency
relief. It also requires, except for limited governmental-emergency
circumstances, that orders under Subsection (a) be rendered only “after
notice and a hearing,” underscoring the centrality of a hearing opportunity.
Subsection (a-1) restricts court-caused postponements when the court
diverts to mediation, reflecting a legislative mandate against indefinite or
undue delays in initial temporary-order hearings. Together, these provisions
support the proposition that a court should not deny or un-set a noticed
emergency hearing based solely on a potential future procedural
development, because the Family Code prioritizes prompt access to
temporary relief and the opportunity to be heard.
Rule 680. Temporary Restraining Order
Extract
No temporary restraining order shall be granted without notice to the
adverse party unless it clearly appears from specific facts shown by affidavit
or by the verified complaint that immediate and irreparable injury, loss, or
damage will result to the applicant before notice can be served and a
hearing had thereon. ... In case a temporary restraining order is granted
without notice, the application for a temporary injunction shall be set down
for hearing at the earliest possible date and takes precedence of all matters
except older matters of the same character; ... On two days' notice ... the
adverse party may appear and move its dissolution or modification and in
that event the court shall proceed to hear and determine such motion as
expeditiously as the ends of justice require.
Summary
Rule 680 emphasizes expedited consideration of emergency injunctive relief:
TROs can be issued ex parte only upon specific, verified facts showing
immediate and irreparable harm; applications for further injunctive relief
must be set for hearing at the earliest possible date and take precedence;
and when contested, the court must hear and determine matters
expeditiously. This framework shows that emergency injunctive requests are
entitled to prompt, prioritized judicial attention rather than postponement
for unrelated, future filings. Refusing to hear an already-set emergency TRO
because of a possible future consolidation motion contravenes Rule 680’s
mandate for earliest-possible, precedence hearings and expeditious

determination, supporting the due-process argument that the litigant was
denied a meaningful opportunity to be heard on his emergency request.
