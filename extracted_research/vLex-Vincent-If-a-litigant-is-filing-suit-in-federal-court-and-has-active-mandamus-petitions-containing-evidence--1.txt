Question
If a litigant is filing suit in federal court and has active mandamus petitions
containing evidence for claims in the Oklahoma Western District, can those
petitions be referenced as evidence if unrefuted and involve the same
parties? For example, can the litigant cite a link to a Supreme Court website
filing?
Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
Mandamus petitions filed in the Oklahoma Western District can generally be
referenced as evidence in federal court if they are relevant to the claims,
involve the same parties, and are properly authenticated. While citing a link
to a Supreme Court website filing may be permitted, proper authentication
of the evidence is still required under the Federal Rules of Evidence.
Summary
Based on the Federal Rules of Evidence, particularly Rules 402 and 901, a
litigant filing suit in federal court can reference active mandamus petitions
from the Oklahoma Western District as evidence if those petitions contain
information relevant to the claims in the current suit, involve the same
parties, and are properly authenticated. Rule 402 establishes that all
relevant evidence is generally admissible unless excluded by the
Constitution, federal statutes, the Federal Rules of Evidence, or other
Supreme Court rules. The mandamus petitions would likely be considered
relevant if they contain evidence supporting claims in the current litigation
and involve the same parties.
Authentication requirements under Rule 901 must also be satisfied, which
could be accomplished by showing that the mandamus petitions were filed in
a public office as authorized by law. Regarding citing a link to a Supreme
Court website filing, this may be permissible as a form of referencing a
public record, but the litigant would still need to authenticate the document
by demonstrating it is from the official repository where such documents are
kept. The court would ultimately determine whether these requirements are
met based on the specific circumstances of the case and the nature of the
evidence contained in the petitions.
Background and Relevant Law
Federal Rules of Evidence on Admissibility
The admissibility of evidence in federal court proceedings is primarily
governed by the Federal Rules of Evidence. These rules establish the

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
framework for determining what evidence may be presented and considered
in federal litigation. For the question at hand—whether mandamus petitions
filed in the Oklahoma Western District can be referenced as evidence in a
federal court case—Rules 402 and 901 are particularly relevant.
General Admissibility of Relevant Evidence
28 U.S.C. r. 402 establishes the fundamental principle of evidence
admissibility in federal courts: "Relevant evidence is admissible unless any
of the following provides otherwise: * the United States Constitution; * a
federal statute; * these rules; or * other rules prescribed by the Supreme
Court. Irrelevant evidence is not admissible." This rule creates a
presumption of admissibility for all relevant evidence, subject only to
specific exclusions found in the enumerated sources of law.
The threshold question in determining whether mandamus petitions can be
referenced as evidence is whether they are relevant to the claims in the
current lawsuit. Evidence is considered relevant if it has any tendency to
make a fact more or less probable than it would be without the evidence,
and the fact is of consequence in determining the action. If the mandamus
petitions contain information that bears on the issues in the current
litigation, they would likely meet this relevance threshold, especially if they
involve the same parties and similar or related claims.
The fact that Rule 402 was amended in 2011 as part of the restyling of the
Evidence Rules "to make them more easily understood" with "no intent to
change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility" indicates that the
fundamental principle of admitting relevant evidence remains unchanged.
Therefore, the basic framework for analyzing whether mandamus petitions
can be referenced as evidence has remained consistent.
Authentication Requirements
Even if evidence is relevant, it must also be properly authenticated before it
can be admitted. 28 U.S.C. r. 901 addresses this requirement: "To satisfy the
requirement of authenticating or identifying an item of evidence, the
proponent must produce evidence sufficient to support a finding that the
item is what the proponent claims it is." This rule ensures that evidence
presented to the court is genuine and is what it purports to be.
Rule 901 specifically addresses public records: "Evidence that: (A) a
document was recorded or filed in a public office as authorized by law; or
(B) a purported public record or statement is from the office where items of
this kind are kept." This provision is particularly relevant to mandamus
petitions, which are official court filings and thus fall within the category of
public records.
The authentication requirement for mandamus petitions would likely be
satisfied by demonstrating that they were indeed filed in the appropriate
court (the Oklahoma Western District) and are part of the official court
record. This could be accomplished through various means, such as a

certified copy of the petition from the court clerk or, potentially, by
referencing the official court docket.
Analysis
Admissibility of Mandamus Petitions as Evidence
When analyzing whether mandamus petitions can be referenced as evidence
in a federal court case, we must consider both their relevance and
authenticity.
Relevance Analysis
Under 28 U.S.C. r. 402, the mandamus petitions would be admissible if they
are relevant and not excluded by any constitutional provision, federal
statute, the Federal Rules of Evidence, or other Supreme Court rules. For
mandamus petitions that contain evidence related to claims in the current
litigation and involve the same parties, there is a strong argument for
relevance.
The fact that the petitions are "active" and "unrefuted" as mentioned in the
question is significant. "Unrefuted" suggests that the evidence or assertions
in the petitions have not been challenged or contradicted, which could
strengthen their probative value. The involvement of the same parties also
enhances their relevance, as it establishes a direct connection between the
evidence in the petitions and the parties in the current litigation.
However, relevance alone does not guarantee admissibility. The petitions
must not be excluded by any other rules or principles. For example, if the
petitions contain hearsay, privileged information, or other inadmissible
content, those portions might be excluded despite their relevance.
Additionally, a court might exclude even relevant evidence if its probative
value is substantially outweighed by a danger of unfair prejudice, confusing
the issues, misleading the jury, undue delay, wasting time, or needlessly
presenting cumulative evidence under Rule 403 (though this rule was not
specifically provided in the materials).
Authentication Analysis
Under 28 U.S.C. r. 901, the mandamus petitions would need to be
authenticated before they could be admitted as evidence. As public records
filed in a federal court, they would likely fall under Rule 901's provision for
authenticating public records.
The rule provides that authentication can be satisfied by "[e]vidence that:
(A) a document was recorded or filed in a public office as authorized by law;
or (B) a purported public record or statement is from the office where items
of this kind are kept." Mandamus petitions filed in the Oklahoma Western
District Court are clearly documents "filed in a public office as authorized by
law," and thus could be authenticated under this provision.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Authentication could be accomplished through various means, such as:
Obtaining a certified copy of the petition from the court clerk
Having a witness with knowledge testify that the document is what it is
claimed to be
Presenting evidence of the petition's appearance, contents, substance,
internal patterns, or other distinctive characteristics, taken in
conjunction with circumstances
Referring to the official court docket or records system
Citing a Link to a Supreme Court Website Filing
The question also asks whether a litigant can "cite a link to a Supreme Court
website filing." This presents a slightly different issue than referencing the
mandamus petitions themselves.
Authentication of Electronic Records
When citing a link to an official court website (such as the Supreme Court's
website), authentication becomes a key consideration. Under 28 U.S.C. r.
901, the litigant would need to produce evidence sufficient to support a
finding that the electronic document is what the litigant claims it is.
Rule 901 specifically addresses public records, stating that authentication
can be satisfied by evidence that "a purported public record or statement is
from the office where items of this kind are kept." A document accessible
through an official Supreme Court website link would likely qualify as a
public record from the office where such records are kept.
However, simply providing a URL link might not be sufficient for
authentication purposes. The court may require additional evidence to
establish that the link indeed leads to an official Supreme Court website and
that the document accessed through that link is an authentic court record.
This could potentially be addressed through judicial notice of the official
nature of the Supreme Court's website, or by providing additional
verification of the document's authenticity.
It's also worth noting that courts may have specific local rules or practices
regarding the citation of electronic sources that would need to be
considered.
Practical Considerations
From a practical standpoint, citing a link to a Supreme Court website filing
raises several considerations:
Permanence: Web links can change or become inaccessible over time,
potentially creating issues with the court's ability to access the
referenced material.
Format: Courts typically prefer citations to official reporters or specific
docket entries rather than URLs, following established citation formats.

Accessibility: Not all participants in the litigation may have equal
access to electronic resources, potentially creating fairness concerns.
Official Record: Courts generally rely on their own official record-
keeping systems rather than external websites, even those of other
courts.
Given these considerations, a more prudent approach might be to:
Cite the mandamus petition using standard legal citation format
Include the URL as a supplementary reference if relevant
Provide a printed copy of the document as an exhibit if necessary
Ensure proper authentication through official channels
Unrefuted Evidence and Same Parties
The question specifically mentions that the mandamus petitions are
"unrefuted" and involve the "same parties." These factors merit additional
consideration.
Unrefuted Evidence
The fact that evidence in the mandamus petitions is "unrefuted" does not
automatically make it admissible or conclusive in a separate federal court
case. While it may enhance the persuasive value of the evidence, each court
proceeding is generally independent, and evidence must satisfy the
admissibility requirements in each case separately.
However, in some circumstances, unrefuted evidence from a prior
proceeding involving the same parties might have preclusive effect under
doctrines such as collateral estoppel or issue preclusion. These doctrines
prevent re-litigation of issues that have already been decided in a prior
proceeding, provided certain conditions are met. While the provided
materials do not directly address these doctrines, they are relevant
considerations when evaluating the use of evidence from prior proceedings.
Same Parties
The involvement of the same parties in both the mandamus proceedings and
the current litigation is significant for several reasons:
It strengthens the relevance connection between the mandamus
petitions and the current case.
It may implicate preclusive doctrines that could give the findings in the
mandamus proceedings binding effect in the current case.
It may impact the authentication process, as parties who were involved
in the prior proceedings may be less likely to challenge the authenticity
of documents from those proceedings.

It could affect judicial efficiency considerations, as courts generally
favor avoiding duplicative litigation between the same parties.
Exceptions and Caveats
While the Federal Rules of Evidence generally allow for the admission of
relevant and authenticated evidence, there are several exceptions and
caveats that could affect the admissibility of mandamus petitions in a federal
court case:
Potential Exclusions Under Other Rules
Although Rule 402 creates a presumption of admissibility for relevant
evidence, it explicitly acknowledges that evidence may be excluded by other
sources of law. The materials provided do not include other potentially
applicable rules of evidence that might exclude otherwise relevant evidence,
such as:
Hearsay rules (Rules 801-807)
Character evidence restrictions (Rules 404-405)
Subsequent remedial measures (Rule 407)
Compromise offers and negotiations (Rule 408)
Privileged information (Rules 501-502)
If the mandamus petitions contain information that would be excluded under
these or other rules, those portions might not be admissible despite their
relevance and proper authentication.
Judicial Discretion
Courts have considerable discretion in evidentiary matters, and a judge
might exclude evidence that would otherwise be admissible based on case-
specific considerations. For example, if referencing the mandamus petitions
would cause undue delay, waste time, or confuse the issues, a court might
limit or exclude such evidence.
Procedural Context
The procedural posture of the case could also affect whether mandamus
petitions can be referenced as evidence. For example:
At the pleading stage, courts are generally limited to considering the
complaint and documents incorporated by reference.
In a motion for summary judgment, courts consider evidence that
would be admissible at trial.
During trial, the formal rules of evidence apply most strictly.
The ability to reference mandamus petitions may vary depending on which
stage of litigation the case is in.

Specific Limitations on Electronic Citations
The Federal Rules of Evidence do not explicitly address the citation of links
to court websites or electronic resources. Courts may have varying
approaches to accepting such citations, and local rules or standing orders
might provide specific guidance that would need to be considered.
Conclusion
Based on the Federal Rules of Evidence provided, mandamus petitions filed
in the Oklahoma Western District can generally be referenced as evidence in
a federal court case if they are relevant to the claims in the current suit,
involve the same parties, and are properly authenticated.
Under 28 U.S.C. r. 402, relevant evidence is presumptively admissible unless
excluded by the Constitution, federal statutes, the Federal Rules of
Evidence, or other Supreme Court rules. Mandamus petitions containing
evidence related to claims in the current litigation and involving the same
parties would likely satisfy the relevance requirement, especially if they are
"unrefuted" as mentioned in the question.
However, relevance alone is not sufficient. The petitions must also be
properly authenticated under 28 U.S.C. r. 901, which requires producing
"evidence sufficient to support a finding that the item is what the proponent
claims it is." For public records like mandamus petitions, authentication can
be satisfied by evidence that the document was filed in a public office as
authorized by law or comes from the office where such records are kept.
As for citing a link to a Supreme Court website filing, while Rule 901 does
provide for the authentication of public records, simply providing a URL link
might not be sufficient without additional authentication. The litigant would
need to establish that the document accessed through the link is an
authentic court record. This might require additional verification beyond
merely citing the link.
Several practical considerations should also be kept in mind:
Electronic citations raise issues of permanence, format, and
accessibility.
Courts generally prefer traditional citation methods for legal
authorities.
Local rules or standing orders may provide specific guidance on
electronic citations.
The procedural context of the case may affect what evidence can be
considered.
In conclusion, while mandamus petitions can generally be referenced as
evidence if they meet the requirements of relevance and authentication, the
specific manner of reference—particularly citing a link to a court website—
may require additional steps to ensure compliance with evidentiary
standards. Litigants should consider traditional methods of referencing

court documents alongside any electronic citations to maximize the
likelihood of the evidence being properly considered by the court.
Legal Authorities
28 U.S.C. r. 402 28 U.S.C. r. 402 General Admissibility of Relevant Evidence
Extract
Relevant evidence is admissible unless any of the following provides
otherwise: * the United States Constitution; * a federal statute; * these rules;
or * other rules prescribed by the Supreme Court. Irrelevant evidence is not
admissible.
Summary
The passage from 28 U.S.C. r. 402 establishes that relevant evidence is
generally admissible in federal court unless excluded by the Constitution,
federal statutes, the Federal Rules of Evidence, or other rules prescribed by
the Supreme Court. This suggests that if the mandamus petitions are
relevant to the claims and involve the same parties, they could potentially be
referenced as evidence, provided they are not excluded by any of the
aforementioned rules or statutes. The passage does not specifically address
the admissibility of citing a link to a Supreme Court website filing, but it
implies that the relevance and compliance with other rules are key factors in
determining admissibility.
28 U.S.C. r. 901 28 U.S.C. r. 901 Authenticating Or Identifying Evidence
Extract
To satisfy the requirement of authenticating or identifying an item of
evidence, the proponent must produce evidence sufficient to support a
finding that the item is what the proponent claims it is... Evidence About
Public Records. Evidence that: (A) a document was recorded or filed in a
public office as authorized by law; or (B) a purported public record or
statement is from the office where items of this kind are kept.
Summary
For evidence to be admissible in federal court, it must be authenticated or
identified as what it is claimed to be. The passage provides examples of how
evidence can be authenticated, including evidence about public records. If a
mandamus petition is filed in a public office as authorized by law, it could
potentially be referenced as evidence if it meets the authentication
requirements. The passage suggests that documents recorded or filed in a
public office can be authenticated as public records, which may apply to
mandamus petitions if they are part of the public record.
