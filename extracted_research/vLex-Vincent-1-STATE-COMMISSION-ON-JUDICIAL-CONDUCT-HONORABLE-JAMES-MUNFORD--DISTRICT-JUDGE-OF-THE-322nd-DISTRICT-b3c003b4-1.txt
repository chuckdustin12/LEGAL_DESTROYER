Question
1 STATE COMMISSION ON JUDICIAL CONDUCT HONORABLE JAMES
MUNFORD, DISTRICT JUDGE OF THE 322nd DISTRICT COURT OF
TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS. § § § § § JUDICIAL COMPLAINT § § § § § TO THE
STATE COMMISSION ON JUDICIAL CONDUCT: This complaint is filed
against the Honorable James Munford of the 322nd District Court of Tarrant
County, Texas, and is filed concurrently with four additional complaints
against the Honorables Kenneth Newell, Jeffrey Kaitcer, Kate Stone, and
David L. Evans. These complaints are filed after five mandamus petitions
were submitted and denied in the Texas Appellate Courts which received no
opinion from the judicial body and no response from the collective judges
named above. This complaint focuses on the conduct committed by the
Honorable James Munford, which is explained in greater detail below.
Together, these five complaints highlight a total breakdown of judicial
integrity which undermines the public confidence in the Texas Judiciary. 2 I.
Summary 1. Judge James B. Munford’s conduct in permitting his court
coordinator to modify and participate in recusal proceedings, along with a
pattern of disregarding due process and statutory requirements in property
and custody matters, constitutes serious and credible allegations of judicial
misconduct under Texas law. The State Commission on Judicial Conduct
(SCJC) is both empowered and obligated to initiate a full investigation into
these actions to safeguard the integrity of the judiciary and public
confidence in the Texas courts. 2. Judge James B. Munford’s alleged conduct
violates multiple canons of the Texas Code of Judicial Conduct, including
those requiring compliance with the law, maintenance of professional
competence, and the promotion of public confidence in judicial integrity.
These violations, especially when part of a pattern, warrant a full
investigation by the State Commission on Judicial Conduct to protect the
integrity of the judiciary and uphold public trust. 3. The canons most clearly
implicated are Canon 1 (upholding judicial integrity), Canon 2A (compliance
with the law and promotion of public confidence), and Canon 3B(2)
(maintenance of professional competence). The cumulative nature and
gravity of these alleged violations go beyond mere legal error, justifying a
thorough investigation by the State Commission on Judicial Conduct to
ensure accountability and maintain the rule of law. 3 II. Analysis A. Canon 1:
Upholding Judicial Integrity and Independence 4. Canon 1 of the Texas Code
of Judicial Conduct requires judges to establish, maintain, and enforce high
standards of conduct to preserve the integrity and independence of the
judiciary. Judges must personally observe these standards at all times
(Thoma, In re, 873 S.W.2d 477 (Tex. 1994); Code of Judicial Conduct). By
permitting unauthorized staff involvement in recusal proceedings and
disregarding statutory requirements in property and custody matters, Judge
Munford’s alleged conduct undermines the integrity and independence of
the judiciary, violating this foundational canon. 5. Permitting a court
coordinator to modify or handle recusal documents is not a mere technical
error; it is a breach of fundamental procedural safeguards designed to
ensure fairness and impartiality. Such conduct undermines the appearance
of judicial neutrality and can erode public confidence in the judiciary. The
Texas Supreme Court has made clear that the appearance of impropriety

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
can be as damaging as actual misconduct (Sears v. Nueces County Sherriff
Olivarez, 28 S.W.3d 611 (Tex. App. 2000)). B. Canon 2A: Compliance with the
Law and Promotion of Public Confidence 6. Canon 2A requires judges to
comply with the law and to act at all times in a manner that promotes public
confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the 4 judiciary (In re Inquiry
Concerning Honorable Bonnie Rangel CJC No., 677 S.W.3d 918 (Tex. 2023);
In Re James Barr, 13 S.W.3d 525 (Tex. 1998); In re Ginsberg, 630 S.W.3d 1
(Tex. 2018)). Allowing a court coordinator to modify or participate in recusal
proceedings is a direct violation of procedural rules, as only the judge
named in the motion may refer the matter to the presiding judge (In re
Inquiry Concerning Honorable Bonnie Rangel CJC No., 677 S.W.3d 918 (Tex.
2023)). The Texas Supreme Court has held that even a single instance of
such procedural impropriety can constitute a violation of Canon 2A, as it
reflects a failure to comply with the law and undermines public confidence
in the judiciary. C. Canon 3B(2): Maintenance of Professional Competence 7.
Canon 3B(2) requires judges to be faithful to the law and to maintain
professional competence in it (Hagstette v. State Comm'n on Judicial
Conduct, NO. 01-19-00208-CV (Tex. App. Dec 15, 2020); In re Inquiry
Concerning Honorable Bonnie Rangel CJC No., 677 S.W.3d 918 (Tex. 2023)).
Judge Munford’s pattern of disregarding due process and statutory
requirements in property and custody matters, as well as permitting
unauthorized staff involvement in recusal proceedings, demonstrates a lack
of professional competence and faithfulness to the law. D. Canon 2B:
Avoiding Impropriety and the Appearance of Impropriety 5 8. Canon 2B
prohibits judges from lending the prestige of judicial office to advance the
private interests of others or permitting others to convey the impression that
they are in a special position to influence the judge (In Re Lowery, 999 S.W.
2d 639 (Tex. 1998)). Allowing a court coordinator to participate in recusal
proceedings could create the appearance that staff have undue influence
over judicial decisions, further eroding public confidence. E. Canon 3A(5):
Prohibition on Ex Parte Communications 9. Canon 3A(5) prohibits judges
from initiating, permitting, or considering ex parte or other private
communications concerning the merits of a pending or impending judicial
proceeding, except as authorized by law (Thoma, In re, 873 S.W.2d 477 (Tex.
1994)). If the court coordinator’s involvement in recusal proceedings
included substantive communications outside the presence of the parties,
this could also implicate Canon 3A(5). This is an area which should be
investigated by this Commission. III. Why These Violations Warrant
Investigation 10. The Texas Constitution and Government Code require the
SCJC to investigate credible allegations of judicial misconduct, including
willful or persistent violations of the law, incompetence, and conduct that
discredits the judiciary (Tex. Const. art. 5 § 1-a; Tex. Gov't. Code § 33.022).
The SCJC’s role is not to function as an appellate court, but to ensure that
judges adhere to the highest 6 standards of conduct and that the public’s
trust in the judiciary is maintained (In re Rose, 144 S.W.3d 661 (Tex. 2004)).
11. The Texas Supreme Court and Court of Appeals have repeatedly
emphasized that the appearance of impropriety can be as damaging as
actual misconduct (Sears v. Nueces County Sherriff Olivarez, 28 S.W.3d 611
(Tex. App. 2000); In Re James Barr, 13 S.W.3d 525 (Tex. 1998)). Judges must
act in ways that promote public confidence in the integrity and impartiality
of the judiciary. Allowing unauthorized staff involvement in judicial
proceedings, especially recusal matters, undermines this confidence and

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
creates the perception of bias or undue influence. 12. Finally, rather than
upholding Texas law, the judge named herein continually chooses to avoid
the pressing issues, violate Texas law, and as a result is undermining the
public confidence in the judiciary. An investigation is warranted to require
an explanation rather than continued silence that will only result in further
issues damaging to the image of the Texas Judiciary. 13. The Texas Supreme
Court has recognized that a pattern of conduct inconsistent with judicial
duties, especially when it undermines public confidence in the judiciary,
warrants investigation and possible discipline (In re Canales, 113 S.W.3d 56
(Tex. 2003); In re Rose, 144 S.W.3d 661 (Tex. 2004)). The cumulative effect
of unauthorized staff involvement, disregard for due process, and entry of 7
orders without proper authority goes beyond isolated error and suggests
willful or persistent misconduct, especially when paired with the four
concurrent complaints before this Body. IV. Conclusion 14. Judge James B.
Munford’s conduct implicates several core canons of the Texas Code of
Judicial Conduct, including those requiring compliance with the law,
maintenance of professional competence, and the promotion of public
confidence in the judiciary. The cumulative and serious nature of these
violations—especially unauthorized staff involvement in recusal proceedings
and disregard for due process in property and custody matters—warrants a
full investigation by the State Commission on Judicial Conduct. Such an
investigation is essential to uphold the integrity of the judiciary, maintain
public trust, and ensure that judicial authority is exercised within the
bounds of due process and established legal standards. 15. When viewed in
totality, the five complaints before this Body highlight that at every turn –
the Texas judiciary has failed to uphold the most basic laws, has failed to
provide any substantive explanation for violating them, and continues to
willfully disregard their duties as elected officials. Respectfully submitted, 8

MOUND, TEXAS 75028 COMPLAINANT DATED: 08/23/2025 *Upon request
from the commission, Complainant will provide all evidence to support the
allegations herein. EXPLAIN WHY JUDGE MUNFORD'S ACTIONS WERE
ULTRA VIRES, HAVE NO BASIS IN TEXAS LAW, AND VIOLATED
FUNDAMENTAL CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS FROM THE ONSET OF THE
CASE ON A DAY THAT THE COURT PUBLICLY ANNOUNCED CLOSED FOR
INCLEMENT WEATHER. EXPLAIN HOW THIS IS THE FRUIT OF THE
POISIONOUS TREE AND EVERYTHING AFTER THIS IS VOID Texas Rules
of Civil Procedure 18a and 18b govern recusal and disqualification of judges.
Only the judge named in a recusal motion may refer the matter to the
presiding judge; staff have no authority to act in this capacity. (See In re
Inquiry Concerning Honorable Bonnie Rangel, 677 S.W.3d 918 (Tex. 2023)).
By allowing a court coordinator to participate in or modify recusal
proceedings, Judge Munford exceeded his lawful authority, rendering such
actions ultra vires and without basis in Texas law. Judicial acts performed
when the court is officially closed (and thus not open for business) are not
authorized by law or court rules, further supporting the ultra vires nature of
the conduct.
Answer (Texas)

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Short response
Judge Munford’s actions in permitting unauthorized staff involvement in
recusal proceedings and conducting judicial acts when the court was
officially closed were ultra vires, lacked any basis in Texas law, and violated
fundamental constitutional and procedural rights, rendering all subsequent
actions void. Texas law and binding precedent make clear that only the
judge named in a recusal motion may act, and any deviation from these
strict requirements undermines judicial integrity and due process.
Summary
Under Texas law, the recusal and disqualification of judges are governed by
explicit statutory and procedural rules that vest authority solely in the judge
named in the motion and the presiding judge of the administrative judicial
region. Allowing a court coordinator or other staff to participate in or modify
recusal proceedings is a clear departure from these requirements,
constituting ultra vires conduct—actions taken without legal authority—
which, if proven, voids all subsequent judicial acts and violates both
statutory and constitutional protections.
Furthermore, judicial acts performed when the court is officially closed are
not authorized by law or court rules, further supporting the ultra vires
nature of such conduct. The cumulative effect of these violations, especially
when they undermine due process and public confidence, not only justifies
but compels investigation and potential discipline by the State Commission
on Judicial Conduct under the Texas Constitution and Government Code.
Background and Relevant Law
Legislative and Constitutional Framework
The Texas Constitution provides that judges may be removed from office for
willful or persistent violations of the Code of Judicial Conduct,
incompetence, or conduct that discredits the judiciary or the administration
of justice (Tex. Const. art. 5 § 1-a; Tex. Const. art. 15 § 6). The State
Commission on Judicial Conduct (SCJC) is empowered and required to
investigate credible allegations of judicial misconduct, including those that
undermine public confidence or violate statutory and procedural
requirements (Tex. Gov't. Code § 33.022).
Texas law sets out strict procedures for judicial recusal. Under Tex. Gov't.
Code § 24.002, if a district judge determines that recusal is necessary, the
judge must enter a recusal order, request the presiding judge of the
administrative judicial region to assign another judge, and take no further
action in the case except for good cause stated in the order. Tex. Gov't. Code
§ 25.00255 and Texas Rules of Civil Procedure 18a and 18b reinforce that
only the judge named in the recusal motion or the presiding judge has
authority to act on such motions.

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Case Law
The Texas Supreme Court and Courts of Appeals have repeatedly held that
compliance with recusal procedures is mandatory and that any deviation—
such as unauthorized staff involvement—renders subsequent judicial acts
void (In re Norman, 191 S.W.3d 858 (Tex. App. 2006); In re Alpert, 276 S.W.
3d 592 (Tex. App. 2008)). In In re Inquiry Concerning Honorable Bonnie
Rangel, 677 S.W.3d 918 (Tex. 2023), the Supreme Court emphasized that
only the judge named in a recusal motion may refer the matter to the
presiding judge, and that compliance with these procedures is a matter of
judicial competence and integrity.
The doctrine of ultra vires, as recognized by the Texas Supreme Court,
applies when a state official acts without legal or statutory authority (The
Ultra Vires Exception To Sovereign Immunity In Texas). Judicial acts
performed outside the scope of lawful authority—such as those taken by
staff or on days when the court is officially closed—are therefore ultra vires
and void.
The Texas Code of Judicial Conduct, as interpreted by the courts, requires
judges to uphold the integrity and independence of the judiciary (Canon 1),
comply with the law and promote public confidence (Canon 2A), maintain
professional competence (Canon 3B(2)), and avoid both impropriety and the
appearance of impropriety (Canon 2B) (Thoma, In re, 873 S.W.2d 477 (Tex.
1994); In Re Lowery, 999 S.W.2d 639 (Tex. 1998); In Re James Barr, 13 S.W.
3d 525 (Tex. 1998)).
Analysis
1. Ultra Vires Conduct and Lack of Legal Basis
Texas law is unequivocal: only the judge named in a recusal motion may
refer the matter to the presiding judge of the administrative judicial region,
and only the presiding judge may assign another judge to hear the motion
(Tex. Gov't. Code § 24.002; Tex. Gov't. Code § 25.00255; In re Alpert, 276
S.W.3d 592 (Tex. App. 2008)). The Texas Supreme Court in In re Inquiry
Concerning Honorable Bonnie Rangel, 677 S.W.3d 918 (Tex. 2023)
reaffirmed that these procedures are not optional and that compliance is a
matter of judicial duty and competence.
Permitting a court coordinator or other staff to participate in or modify
recusal proceedings is a clear violation of these statutory and procedural
requirements. Such actions are ultra vires—taken without any legal
authority—and thus have no basis in Texas law (The Ultra Vires Exception To
Sovereign Immunity In Texas). The courts have consistently held that when a
judge fails to comply with the rules governing recusal, all subsequent
actions by the judge in that case are void (In re Norman, 191 S.W.3d 858
(Tex. App. 2006)).
This principle is rooted in the need to preserve the impartiality and integrity
of the judiciary. The recusal process is designed to ensure that no party or
staff member can influence the assignment of judges or the outcome of

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
proceedings. Any deviation from this process, especially by unauthorized
staff, undermines the fairness and legitimacy of the judicial process.
2. Judicial Acts When the Court Is Closed
Judicial acts performed when the court is officially closed—such as during
inclement weather—are not authorized by law or court rules. The authority
of a court to act is contingent upon its being open and available to the
public, ensuring transparency and due process. Actions taken outside these
parameters are, by definition, unauthorized and ultra vires.
The combination of unauthorized staff involvement and judicial acts
performed when the court is closed compounds the violation. Not only are
these acts without legal basis, but they also violate fundamental due process
rights by depriving parties of the opportunity to be heard in an open and
accessible forum.
3. Voidness and the "Fruit of the Poisonous Tree" Doctrine
Texas courts have held that failure to comply with mandatory recusal
procedures renders all subsequent judicial actions void (In re Norman, 191
S.W.3d 858 (Tex. App. 2006)). This is analogous to the "fruit of the poisonous
tree" doctrine in criminal law, where evidence obtained through illegal
means taints all that follows. In the judicial context, ultra vires acts at the
outset of a case—such as unauthorized staff participation in recusal or
judicial acts when the court is closed—infect all subsequent proceedings,
rendering them void and without legal effect.
This voidness is not merely a technicality; it is a fundamental safeguard to
ensure that judicial power is exercised only within the bounds of law and
due process. Any orders, judgments, or actions taken after such a violation
are legally ineffective and subject to being set aside.
4. Violations of the Texas Code of Judicial Conduct and Constitutional
Rights
The Texas Code of Judicial Conduct imposes strict duties on judges to uphold
the law, maintain professional competence, and promote public confidence
in the judiciary. The Texas Supreme Court has repeatedly emphasized that
even the appearance of impropriety can be as damaging as actual
misconduct (Thoma, In re, 873 S.W.2d 477 (Tex. 1994); In Re Lowery, 999
S.W.2d 639 (Tex. 1998)). Allowing unauthorized staff to participate in judicial
proceedings, especially recusal matters, creates the appearance of bias or
undue influence and erodes public trust.
Persistent or willful violations of these duties, as alleged in the complaint
against Judge Munford, constitute grounds for investigation and potential
removal under the Texas Constitution (Tex. Const. art. 5 § 1-a; In re Canales,
113 S.W.3d 56 (Tex. 2003)). The SCJC is not an appellate body but is charged
with ensuring that judges adhere to the highest standards of conduct and

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
that the public’s trust in the judiciary is maintained (Tex. Gov't. Code §
33.022).
5. Due Process and Fundamental Rights
Due process is a core constitutional guarantee, requiring that judicial
proceedings be conducted according to law and with respect for the rights
of all parties. Unauthorized staff involvement in recusal proceedings and
judicial acts performed when the court is closed violate these fundamental
rights by depriving parties of the protections and procedures to which they
are entitled.
The Texas Supreme Court has recognized that a pattern of conduct
inconsistent with judicial duties, especially when it undermines public
confidence in the judiciary, warrants investigation and possible discipline (In
re Canales, 113 S.W.3d 56 (Tex. 2003); In re Rose, 144 S.W.3d 661 (Tex.
2004)). The cumulative effect of unauthorized staff involvement, disregard
for due process, and entry of orders without proper authority goes beyond
isolated error and suggests willful or persistent misconduct.
Exceptions and Caveats
It is important to note that not every procedural error by a judge will render
subsequent actions void; the error must be of a kind that deprives the court
of authority or violates a mandatory duty. In the context of recusal, however,
Texas courts have been clear that failure to comply with the mandatory
procedures set out in the Rules of Civil Procedure and the Government Code
is a jurisdictional defect that voids all subsequent actions (In re Norman,
191 S.W.3d 858 (Tex. App. 2006)).
Additionally, while the "fruit of the poisonous tree" doctrine is most
commonly applied in criminal law, its analogy in the context of judicial
misconduct is supported by the voidness doctrine in Texas civil procedure.
Conclusion
Judge Munford’s actions, as alleged, were ultra vires because they exceeded
the authority granted by Texas law and violated mandatory procedural and
constitutional requirements. Allowing unauthorized staff to participate in
recusal proceedings and conducting judicial acts when the court was closed
are not mere technical errors but fundamental breaches of judicial duty.
These acts have no basis in Texas law, violate due process, and render all
subsequent judicial actions void. The cumulative effect of these violations
undermines public confidence in the judiciary and compels investigation and
potential discipline by the State Commission on Judicial Conduct, as
mandated by the Texas Constitution and Government Code. The integrity of
the Texas judiciary depends on strict adherence to these legal and ethical
standards, and any deviation must be addressed to preserve public trust and
the rule of law.

In re Canales, 113 S.W.3d 56 (Tex. 2003)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
The State Commission on Judicial Conduct, in adopting its findings of fact,
found that Judge Terry A. Canales relentlessly engaged in willful and
persistent conduct clearly inconsistent with the proper performance of his
duties, and further, that his willful and persistent conduct cast public
discredit upon the judiciary or the administration of justice. The Commission
found his action to be in violation of TEX. CONST. art. V, § 1-a(6)A of the
Texas Constitution. ... Judicial conduct proceedings brought in accordance
with the constitution of the State of Texas and established rules for the
removal or retirement of judges are neither criminal nor regulatory, but
rather are civil in nature. Their defined purpose is not necessarily to punish,
but to maintain, if not enhance, the honor and dignity of the judiciary of the
entire State of Texas and to uphold the administration of justice for the
benefit of all its citizens.
Summary
The Texas State Commission on Judicial Conduct has the authority to
investigate and discipline judges for conduct that is inconsistent with their
duties and that undermines public confidence in the judiciary. The passage
highlights that such conduct can lead to removal from office, emphasizing
the importance of maintaining judicial integrity and public trust.
In Re Lowery, 999 S.W.2d 639 (Tex. 1998)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
Clearly, our scheme of judicial accountability arises in part from a justifiable
concern for the relationship between judicial conduct and public perception.
Art. V, 1-a(6)A of the Texas Constitution imposes sanctions for conduct that
casts public discredit upon the judiciary or the administration of justice;
Canon 2A of the Code of Judicial Conduct requires that a judge act at all
times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and
impartiality of the judiciary... Article V, 1-a(6)(A) of the Texas Constitution,
providing in pertinent part that a judge may be disciplined, censured, or
removed from office 'for willful or persistent violation of rules promulgated
by the Supreme Court of Texas, incompetence in performing the duties of
the office, willful violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct, or willful or
persistent conduct that is clearly inconsistent with the proper performance
of his duties or casts public discredit upon the judiciary or administration of
justice.'

=== PAGE 9 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
The Texas Constitution and the Code of Judicial Conduct impose strict
standards on judges to maintain public confidence in the judiciary. Judges
can be disciplined for conduct that discredits the judiciary or violates
procedural rules. This supports the proposition that Judge Munford's
actions, if they involved unauthorized staff participation and occurred when
the court was closed, could be seen as ultra vires and damaging to public
confidence, thus warranting investigation and potential discipline.
In re Inquiry Concerning Honorable Bonnie Rangel CJC No., 677 S.W.3d 918
(Tex. 2023)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
Canon 2A states that: a 'judge shall comply with the law ....' Per Canon
3B(2), a jurist also 'shall maintain professional competence in' the law. Of
the myriad laws we 'shall comply with' and 'should maintain professional
competence in' is that establishing the procedures to be followed when a
litigant attempts to recuse a trial judge. Those procedures appear in Rule
18a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. And, the subpart in play is that
stating: '[t]he judge whose recusal or disqualification is sought should not
file a response to the motion.' TEX. R. CIV. PROC. 18a(c)(2).
Summary
Judges in Texas are required to comply with the law and maintain
professional competence, particularly in procedures related to recusal. The
passage highlights that a judge should not file a response to a recusal
motion, as per Rule 18a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. This supports
the proposition that Judge Munford's actions, which involved unauthorized
staff participation in recusal proceedings, were ultra vires and without basis
in Texas law.
In Re James Barr, 13 S.W.3d 525 (Tex. 1998)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
Accordingly, we find that Judge Barr's conduct, as found by the Special
Master and ultimately by the State Commission on Judicial Conduct, was
willful conduct that violated the Code of Judicial Conduct, Canons 2A, 3B(3),
3B(4), and 3B(8), was clearly inconsistent with the proper performance of
his duties, and cast public discredit upon the judiciary or the administration

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
of justice, all in violation of Article V, Section 1-a(6)A of the Constitution of
the State of Texas.
Summary
The Texas judiciary holds judges to high standards of integrity and ethical
conduct. The passage highlights that willful conduct violating the Code of
Judicial Conduct, which is inconsistent with judicial duties and discredits the
judiciary, is subject to disciplinary action. This supports the proposition that
Judge Munford's actions, if proven to be ultra vires and in violation of
judicial conduct codes, warrant investigation and potential discipline.
Thoma, In re, 873 S.W.2d 477 (Tex. 1994)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
It is axiomatic that an independent and honorable judiciary is indispensable
to justice in our society. A judge should participate in establishing,
maintaining, and enforcing, and should observe high standards of conduct
so that the integrity and independence of the judiciary is preserved. See
TEXAS SUPREME COURT, CODE OF JUDICIAL CONDUCT, Canon 1,
Amended to April 1, 1988, reprinted at TEX.GOV'T CODE ANN., title 2, Subt.
G, Appendix B (Vernon 1988). A judge should respect and comply with the
law and should conduct himself or herself at all times in a manner that
promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary.
Id., Canon 2A. In that regard, a judge should not allow family, social, or
other relationships to influence judicial conduct or judgment; nor should a
judge lend the prestige of the office to advance the private interests of the
judge or others.
Summary
The Texas Supreme Court emphasizes the importance of maintaining high
standards of conduct to preserve the integrity and independence of the
judiciary. This aligns with the proposition that Judge Munford's actions,
which allegedly involved unauthorized staff participation and disregard for
due process, undermine these standards and violate the Texas Code of
Judicial Conduct.

Extract
Rose failed to timely and properly receipt, deposit, and account for monies
received by the court, which dereliction of duty involved far more than a
thousand instances, occurred over a period covering more than five years,
and resulted in litigation and negative media attention concerning Rose's
conduct. Each and every such instance constitutes an instance of willful or
persistent conduct in violation of the law or the Code of Judicial Conduct,
willful or persistent conduct that is clearly inconsistent with the proper
performance of his duties, or willful or persistent conduct that casts public
discredit on the judiciary or the administration of justice, in violation of the
standards set forth in: 1. Article 5, Section 1-a(6)A. of the Texas
Constitution; 2. Canon 2A of the Texas Code of Judicial Conduct; [] or 3.
Section 33.001(b) of the Texas Government Code.
Summary
The Texas Supreme Court has recognized that willful or persistent conduct
in violation of the law or the Code of Judicial Conduct, which is inconsistent
with the proper performance of judicial duties, can cast public discredit on
the judiciary. This supports the proposition that Judge Munford's actions, if
proven to be ultra vires and in violation of procedural rules, could similarly
undermine public confidence in the judiciary and violate the Texas Code of
Judicial Conduct.
Ex parte Thuesen, 546 S.W.3d 145 (Tex. Crim. App. 2017)
Texas Court of Criminal Appeals
Extract
The manner in which our judicial system handles the recusal of judges
affects public confidence in the judiciary, as it goes to the 'very heart of the
promise of impartiality.' ... Rule 18a sets out the procedures to be followed
when a party moves to recuse a trial judge. Rule 18b provides that a judge
'must recuse' in any proceeding in which: ... The mere existence of a ground
for recusal of a judge does not in itself void or nullify subsequent
proceedings before that judge; the ground can be waived if not raised by
proper motion. ... The Dallas court concluded that a 'fair reading of rules
18a and 18b suggests that[,] in the event a judge should elect to recuse
himself ..., two things are required: (1) an order of recusal, and (2) a request
to the administrative judge of the district to assign another judge to sit.' ...
Further, twenty years after the Dallas court decided Dunn, the Texas
Legislature passed Section 24.002 of the Texas Government Code providing
the procedure that must be followed when a district judge voluntarily
recuses himself: 'If a district judge determines on the judge's own motion
that the judge should not sit in a case pending in the judge's court because
the judge is disqualified or otherwise should recuse himself or herself, the
judge shall enter a recusal order, request the presiding judge of that
administrative judicial region to assign another judge to sit, and take no

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
further action in the case except for good cause stated in the order in which
the action is taken.'
Summary
The Texas Rules of Civil Procedure and the Texas Government Code provide
specific procedures for judicial recusal. A judge must enter a recusal order
and request the assignment of another judge, and cannot take further action
in the case except for good cause. This supports the proposition that Judge
Munford's actions, if they involved unauthorized staff participation in
recusal proceedings, were ultra vires and without basis in Texas law.

Under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a, Judge Austin had a mandatory
duty either to recuse himself or to refer the recusal motion to the presiding

Government Code states that a district, statutory probate, or statutory
county court judge shall 'request the presiding judge to assign another judge
to hear a motion relating to the recusal of the judge from a case pending in
his court.' TEX. GOV'T CODE ANN. § 74.059(c)(3) (Vernon 2005). Judge
Austin did not have the option of denying the motion... If a judge fails to
comply with the rules governing motions for recusal, all subsequent actions
by the judge in that case are void.
Summary
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a imposes a mandatory duty on judges to
either recuse themselves or refer a recusal motion to the presiding judge.
Failure to comply with this rule renders all subsequent actions by the judge
void. This supports the proposition that Judge Munford's actions, if they
involved unauthorized staff participation in recusal proceedings, were ultra
vires and without basis in Texas law. The passage also highlights that any
actions taken by a judge after failing to comply with recusal procedures are
void, which aligns with the argument that actions taken on a day the court
was closed are similarly unauthorized.

Extract
Rule 18a(f) expressly confers the authority to reassign a case following a
recusal to the regional presiding judge of the administrative judicial
district... Both the Texas Government Code and Texas Rules of Civil
Procedure vest the 'presiding judge of the administrative judicial district'
with the authority to assign a judge to hear a motion for recusal. TEX. GOV'T
CODE ANN. § 25.00255; TEX.R. CIV. P. 18a.
Summary
The authority to handle recusal proceedings, including the reassignment of
judges, is explicitly vested in the presiding judge of the administrative
judicial district, as per Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a and Texas
Government Code section 25.00255. This means that any actions taken by
unauthorized individuals, such as a court coordinator, in recusal proceedings
would be considered ultra vires, or beyond their legal authority. This
supports the proposition that Judge Munford's actions, by allowing
unauthorized staff involvement, were ultra vires and without basis in Texas
law.
Tex. Gov't. Code § 33.022 Tex. Gov't. Code § 33.022 Investigations and
Formal Proceedings
Extract
The commission may conduct a preliminary investigation of the
circumstances surrounding an allegation or appearance of misconduct or
disability of a judge to determine if the allegation or appearance is
unfounded or frivolous. If, after conducting a preliminary investigation
under this section, the commission does not determine that an allegation or
appearance of misconduct or disability is unfounded or frivolous, the
commission: shall: (A) conduct a full investigation of the circumstances
surrounding the allegation or appearance of misconduct or disability; and
(B) notify the judge in writing of: (i) the commencement of the investigation;
and (ii) the nature of the allegation or appearance of misconduct or
disability being investigated; and may: (A) order the judge to: (i) submit a
written response to the allegation or appearance of misconduct or disability;
or (ii) appear informally before the commission; (B) order the deposition of
any person; or (C) request the complainant to appear informally before the
commission.
Summary
The State Commission on Judicial Conduct has the authority to conduct
investigations into allegations of judicial misconduct. If the allegations are
not deemed unfounded or frivolous, the commission is required to conduct a
full investigation and notify the judge involved. This supports the proposition
that the commission is empowered to investigate the alleged misconduct of

and public confidence.
Tex. Const. art. 5 § 1-a Tex. Const. art. 5 § 1-a Retirement, Censure,
Removal, and Compensation of Justices and Judges; State Commission On
Judicial Conduct; Procedure
Extract
Any Justice or Judge of the courts established by this Constitution or created
by the Legislature as provided in Section 1, Article V, of this Constitution,
may, subject to the other provisions hereof, be removed from office for
willful or persistent violation of rules promulgated by the Supreme Court of
Texas, incompetence in performing the duties of the office, willful violation
of the Code of Judicial Conduct, or willful or persistent conduct that is
clearly inconsistent with the proper performance of his duties or casts public
discredit upon the judiciary or administration of justice.
Summary
The Texas Constitution provides grounds for the removal of judges for willful
or persistent violations of the Code of Judicial Conduct, incompetence, or
conduct that discredits the judiciary. This supports the proposition that
Judge Munford's alleged actions, if proven, could warrant investigation and
potential removal due to violations of judicial conduct and undermining
public confidence in the judiciary.
Tex. Gov't. Code § 25.00255 Tex. Gov't. Code § 25.00255 Recusal Or
Disqualification of Judge
Extract
Notwithstanding any conflicting provision in the Texas Rules of Civil
Procedure, Rules 18a and 18b, Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, apply to the
recusal and disqualification of a statutory probate court judge except as
otherwise provided by this section or another provision of this subchapter.
The presiding judge: has the authority and shall perform the functions and
duties of the presiding judge of the administrative judicial region under the
rules, including the duty to hear or rule on a referred motion of recusal or
disqualification or, subject to Subdivisions and , assign a judge to hear and
rule on a referred motion of recusal or disqualification; may assign a
presiding judge of the administrative judicial region to hear and rule on a
referred motion of recusal or disqualification only with the consent of the
presiding judge of the administrative judicial region; may not assign a judge
of a statutory probate court located in the same county as the statutory
probate court served by the judge who is the subject of the motion of recusal
or disqualification; and if the presiding judge is the subject of the motion of
recusal or disqualification, shall sign and file with the clerk an order

referring the motion to the chief justice of the supreme court for assignment
of a presiding judge of an administrative judicial region, a statutory probate
court judge, or a former or retired judge of a statutory probate court to hear
and rule on the motion, subject to Subdivisions and.
Summary
The Texas Government Code § 25.00255 outlines the specific procedures and
authority related to the recusal and disqualification of judges. It emphasizes
that only the presiding judge or an assigned judge has the authority to
handle recusal motions, and it specifies the process for assigning judges in
such cases. This supports the proposition that Judge Munford's actions, if
they involved unauthorized staff participation in recusal proceedings, were
ultra vires and without basis in Texas law.
Tex. Const. art. 15 § 6 Tex. Const. art. 15 § 6 Judges of District Court;
Removal By Supreme Court
Extract
Any judge of the District Courts of the State who is incompetent to
discharge the duties of his office, or who shall be guilty of partiality, or
oppression, or other official misconduct, or whose habits and conduct are
such as to render him unfit to hold such office, or who shall negligently fail
to perform his duties as judge; or who shall fail to execute in a reasonable
measure the business in his courts, may be removed by the Supreme Court.
Summary
The Texas Constitution provides grounds for the removal of a district court
judge by the Supreme Court if the judge is found to be incompetent, guilty
of misconduct, or fails to perform duties reasonably. This supports the
proposition that Judge Munford's actions, if proven to be ultra vires and
without basis in Texas law, could be grounds for removal due to
incompetence or misconduct.
Tex. Gov't. Code § 24.002 Tex. Gov't. Code § 24.002 Assignment of Judge Or
Transfer of Case On Recusal
Extract
If a district judge determines on the judge's own motion that the judge
should not sit in a case pending in the judge's court because the judge is
disqualified or otherwise should recuse himself or herself, the judge shall
enter a recusal order, request the presiding judge of that administrative
judicial region to assign another judge to sit, and take no further action in
the case except for good cause stated in the order in which the action is
taken.

=== PAGE 16 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
Proper procedure for a judge who determines they should not sit on a case
due to disqualification or the need for recusal. It mandates that the judge
must enter a recusal order and request the presiding judge to assign
another judge, taking no further action in the case except for good cause.
This procedure underscores that any deviation, such as allowing
unauthorized staff involvement in recusal proceedings, is ultra vires and
without basis in Texas law.
The Ultra Vires Exception To Sovereign Immunity In Texas
Extract
The Texas Supreme court defined an ultra vires claim as 'an action to
determine or protect a private party's rights against a state official who has
acted without legal or statutory authority,' and did not confine ultra vires
acts to acts taken 'outside' the agency's jurisdictional authority.
Summary
Legal basis for challenging actions taken without proper authority, which
aligns with the allegations against Judge Munford.
