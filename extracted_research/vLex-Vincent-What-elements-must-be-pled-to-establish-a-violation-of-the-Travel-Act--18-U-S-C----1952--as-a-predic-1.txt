Question
What elements must be pled to establish a violation of the Travel Act (18
U.S.C. § 1952) as a predicate act for a RICO claim?
Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
To establish a violation of the Travel Act (18 U.S.C. § 1952) as a predicate
act for a RICO claim, a plaintiff must plead: (1) interstate or foreign travel or
use of a facility in interstate or foreign commerce; (2) intent to promote,
manage, establish, carry on, or facilitate an unlawful activity; and (3)
performance or attempted performance of an act in furtherance of that
unlawful activity after the travel or use of the interstate facility.
Summary
The Travel Act (18 U.S.C. § 1952) serves as a predicate act for claims under
the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). The RICO
statute explicitly includes violations of the Travel Act in its definition of
"racketeering activity" that can form the basis of a RICO claim. To properly
plead a Travel Act violation as a predicate act, a plaintiff must establish
three essential elements: first, that the defendant traveled in interstate or
foreign commerce or used a facility of interstate commerce; second, that the
defendant had the specific intent to promote, manage, establish, carry on, or
facilitate an unlawful activity; and third, that the defendant subsequently
performed or attempted to perform an act in furtherance of the unlawful
activity.
The "unlawful activity" under the Travel Act must fall within the statutorily
defined categories, which include business enterprises involving gambling,
liquor, narcotics, or prostitution offenses, as well as extortion, bribery, or
arson in violation of state or federal law. Courts have consistently
interpreted the "business enterprise" requirement to mean a continuous
course of conduct rather than sporadic or isolated incidents. The underlying
state or federal law violation must be determined, though actual
accomplishment of the state substantive offense is not required for a Travel
Act violation. This three-element framework has been consistently applied
by federal courts across multiple circuits, making it the established standard
for pleading a Travel Act violation as a predicate act in a RICO claim.

Background and Relevant Law
Statutory Framework
The Travel Act, codified at 18 U.S.C. § 1952, and the RICO statute,
particularly its definition section at 18 U.S.C. § 1961, form the statutory
basis for pleading a Travel Act violation as a predicate act in a RICO claim.
The current version of the Travel Act provides:
"Whoever travels in interstate or foreign commerce or uses the mail or any
facility in interstate or foreign commerce, with intent to- distribute the
proceeds of any unlawful activity; or commit any crime of violence to further
any unlawful activity; or otherwise promote, manage, establish, carry on, or
facilitate the promotion, management, establishment, or carrying on, of any
unlawful activity, and thereafter performs or attempts to perform- (A) an act
described in paragraph (1) or (3) shall be fined under this title, imprisoned
not more than 5 years, or both; or (B) an act described in paragraph (2) shall
be fined under this title, imprisoned for not more than 20 years, or both, and
if death results shall be imprisoned for any term of years or for life." 18
U.S.C. § 1952 (2025).
The Travel Act is explicitly listed as a predicate act for RICO claims in 18
U.S.C. § 1961, which defines "racketeering activity" to include "any act
which is indictable under any of the following provisions of title 18, United
States Code: ... section 1952 (relating to racketeering)..." 18 U.S.C. § 1961
(2025). This statutory inclusion establishes that a properly pled Travel Act
violation can serve as a predicate act for a RICO claim.
Case Law on Travel Act Elements
Federal courts across multiple circuits have consistently identified three
essential elements that must be pled to establish a Travel Act violation.
Element 1: Interstate or Foreign Travel or Use of Interstate
Commerce Facility
The first element requires pleading that the defendant traveled in interstate
or foreign commerce or used a facility of interstate commerce. The Second
Circuit in U.S. v. Jenkins, 943 F.2d 167 (2d Cir. 1991) stated that the Travel
Act is violated when "a person uses a facility of interstate or foreign
commerce, such as the telephone." This element can be satisfied by showing
that the defendant personally traveled across state lines or used interstate
facilities such as telephones, mail, or other means of communication that
cross state boundaries.
The Third Circuit provided similar guidance in U.S. v. Zolicoffer, 869 F.2d
771 (3d Cir. 1989), where the court identified "interstate travel or use of an
interstate facility" as the first of three elements necessary to prove a Travel
Act violation.

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
In U.S. v. Tilton, 610 F.2d 302 (5th Cir. 1980), the court reiterated this
element by quoting the statute's requirement of traveling in interstate or
foreign commerce or using "any facility in interstate or foreign commerce,
including the mail."
Importantly, the Supreme Court in Perrin v. United States, 444 U.S. 37, 100
S.Ct. 311, 62 L.Ed.2d 199 (1979) confirmed this element, stating that the
Travel Act makes it a federal offense to "travel or use a facility in interstate
commerce" with certain intents.
Element 2: Intent to Promote, Manage, Establish, Carry On, or
Facilitate Unlawful Activity
The second element requires pleading that the defendant acted with the
specific intent to promote, manage, establish, carry on, or facilitate an
unlawful activity as defined in the statute.
In Chevron Corp. v. Donziger, 974 F. Supp. 2d 362 (S.D.N.Y. 2014), the court
identified the intent "to 'promote, manage, establish, carry on, or facilitate
the promotion, management, establishment, or carrying on, of any unlawful
activity'" as the second element of a Travel Act violation.
The Supreme Court in Rewis v. United States, 401 U.S. 808, 91 S.Ct. 1056,
28 L.Ed.2d 493 (1971) emphasized that the traveler's purpose "must involve
more than the desire to patronize the illegal activity," indicating that a
specific intent to actively further the unlawful activity is required.
The Eleventh Circuit in U.S. v. Corona, 885 F.2d 766 (11th Cir. 1989) added
that "knowledge of the defendant of the unlawful activity" is a necessary
component of a Travel Act violation, highlighting that the defendant must be
aware of the unlawful nature of the activity.
Element 3: Performance or Attempted Performance of an Act in
Furtherance
The third element requires pleading that after the interstate travel or use of
an interstate facility, the defendant performed or attempted to perform an
act in furtherance of the unlawful activity.
The Eighth Circuit in U.S. v. Becton, 751 F.2d 250 (8th Cir. 1985)
emphasized that "intent alone does not satisfy the requirements of the
Travel Act," and that the government must prove that the defendant
"performed or attempted to perform some act in furtherance of his illegal
activity after his arrival."
Similarly, the Third Circuit in U.S. v. Zolicoffer, 869 F.2d 771 (3d Cir. 1989)
identified "a subsequent overt act in furtherance of the unlawful activity" as
the third essential element of a Travel Act violation.
The Seventh Circuit in United States of America v. Rizzo, 418 F.2d 71 (7th
Cir. 1969) quoted the statute's requirement that the defendant "thereafter

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
performs or attempts to perform any of the acts specified" after the
interstate travel or use of facilities.
Definition of "Unlawful Activity"
The Travel Act specifically defines what constitutes "unlawful activity" for
purposes of establishing a violation. According to U.S. v. Teplin, 775 F.2d
1261 (4th Cir. 1985), unlawful activity includes "extortion, bribery, or arson
in violation of the laws of the State in which committed or of the United
States."
In United States v. Synodinos, 218 F.Supp. 479 (D. Utah 1963), the court
quoted the statutory definition, which includes "(1) any business enterprise
involving gambling, liquor on which a Federal excise tax has not been paid,
narcotics, or prostitution offenses in violation of the laws of the State in
which they are committed or of the United States, or (2) extortion or bribery
in violation of the laws of the State in which committed or of the United
States."
Requirement of a "Business Enterprise"
Courts have interpreted the term "business enterprise" in the Travel Act to
require a continuous course of conduct rather than isolated or sporadic
incidents.
The Fourth Circuit in U.S. v. Corbin, 662 F.2d 1066 (4th Cir. 1981) stated
that "the term has consistently been construed to require 'a continuous
course of conduct.'" The court further explained, "we hold only that a
continuous course of conduct is necessary to establish the existence of a
business enterprise."
Similarly, the Fourth Circuit in U.S. v. Gallo, 782 F.2d 1191 (4th Cir. 1986)
defined "business enterprise" as "a continuous course of conduct, rather
than a sporadic, casual, individual or isolated violation."
State Law Violations as Predicates
While the Travel Act requires determining that an underlying state law has
been or could have been violated, courts have clarified that the actual
accomplishment of the state offense is not necessary for a Travel Act
conviction.
In U.S. v. Teplin, 775 F.2d 1261 (4th Cir. 1985), the court stated, "While the
Travel Act requires a determination that the underlying state law has been
or could have been violated, 'accomplishment of the state substantive
offense is not a prerequisite to a Section 1952 conviction.'"
Similarly, in U.S. v. Pomponio, 511 F.2d 953 (4th Cir. 1975), the court noted
that "Proof that the unlawful objective was accomplished or that the
referenced law has actually been violated is not a necessary element of the
offense defined in section 1952."

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
The Supreme Court in United States v. Nardello, 393 U.S. 286, 89 S.Ct. 534,
21 L.Ed.2d 487 (1969) clarified that the Travel Act was intended to address
organized crime activities that cross state lines and violate state laws,
regardless of the specific terminology used by individual states to define the
unlawful activity.
Analysis: Establishing a Travel Act Violation
as a RICO Predicate
Pleading Requirements for Each Element
To properly plead a violation of the Travel Act as a predicate act for a RICO
claim, a plaintiff must address each of the three core elements with specific
factual allegations.
Interstate or Foreign Travel/Use of Interstate Facilities
For the first element, a plaintiff must specifically allege that the defendant
either personally traveled across state lines or used facilities of interstate
commerce such as telephones, mail, or electronic communications. The
allegation should identify the specific interstate travel or use of interstate
facilities with sufficient detail to establish this jurisdictional element.
As illustrated in In re Managed Care Litigation, 150 F.Supp.2d 1330 (S.D.
Fla. 2001), the court found adequate pleading where "the Defendants do not
contest interstate travel or use of the mails" and the plaintiffs alleged that
the defendants "on numerous occasions traveled and caused others ... to
travel in interstate commerce" to commit the unlawful activity.
It is not sufficient to merely allege that some interstate activity occurred;
the pleading must connect the interstate travel or use of facilities to the
specific defendants and the alleged unlawful activity. The case law
consistently requires a direct connection between the interstate element and
the defendants' unlawful purpose.
Intent to Promote, Manage, Establish, Carry On, or Facilitate
Unlawful Activity
For the second element, a plaintiff must allege facts showing that the
defendant had the specific intent to promote, manage, establish, carry on, or
facilitate an activity that qualifies as "unlawful" under the Travel Act's
definition. This requires identifying which specific unlawful activity the
defendant intended to further through interstate travel or facilities.
As the Eleventh Circuit noted in U.S. v. Corona, 885 F.2d 766 (11th Cir.
1989), knowledge of the unlawful activity is a necessary component.
Therefore, the pleading should include allegations demonstrating that the
defendant was aware of the unlawful nature of the activity being facilitated.

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
The unlawful activity must fall within one of the categories defined in the
Travel Act, such as gambling, liquor violations, narcotics, prostitution,
extortion, bribery, or arson in violation of state or federal law. The pleading
should specifically identify which category applies and which state or federal
law was allegedly violated.
As clarified in National Organization for Women, Inc. v. Scheidler, 897
F.Supp. 1047 (N.D. Ill. 1995), when alleging extortion under the Travel Act,
the specific state law that defines the extortion must be identified, as state
laws may have different elements.
Performance or Attempted Performance of Acts in Furtherance
For the third element, the plaintiff must allege specific acts that the
defendant performed or attempted to perform after the interstate travel or
use of interstate facilities, which furthered the unlawful activity.
It is not sufficient to allege the interstate travel or use of facilities and the
intent alone; as emphasized in U.S. v. Becton, 751 F.2d 250 (8th Cir. 1985),
"intent alone does not satisfy the requirements of the Travel Act." The
pleading must identify concrete actions taken by the defendant that
demonstrate actual furtherance of the unlawful activity.
These subsequent acts must be causally connected to the original intent and
the interstate element. The acts should be specifically identified and
described with sufficient detail to establish their connection to the alleged
unlawful activity.
Continuous Course of Conduct
When pleading a violation involving a "business enterprise," the plaintiff
should allege facts showing a continuous course of conduct rather than
isolated incidents. As established in U.S. v. Corbin, 662 F.2d 1066 (4th Cir.
1981), a "continuous course of conduct is necessary to establish the
existence of a business enterprise."
This requirement is particularly relevant for allegations involving gambling,
liquor violations, narcotics, or prostitution, which must involve a "business
enterprise" under the statute. The pleading should include facts
demonstrating the ongoing and continuous nature of the enterprise rather
than a single transaction or sporadic activities.
Connection to RICO Requirements
Once the Travel Act violation is properly pled, it must be connected to the
broader RICO claim. As noted in the secondary material on "Racketeer
influenced and corrupt organizations," a Travel Act conviction can serve as a
predicate act for a RICO claim, even when other predicate acts are
invalidated.
The Travel Act violation must be included among the pattern of racketeering
activity alleged in the RICO claim. Under 18 U.S.C. § 1961, a "pattern of

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
racketeering activity" requires at least two predicate acts, which can include
Travel Act violations. Therefore, the pleading should clearly identify how the
Travel Act violation fits within the overall pattern of racketeering activity
alleged in the RICO claim.
State Law Considerations
When pleading a Travel Act violation based on state law violations, the
specific state law that was allegedly violated must be identified. However, as
clarified in U.S. v. Teplin, 775 F.2d 1261 (4th Cir. 1985) and U.S. v. Pomponio,
511 F.2d 953 (4th Cir. 1975), it is not necessary to allege that the state law
violation was actually completed, only that the defendant intended to violate
the law and took steps toward doing so.
The Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Nardello, 393 U.S. 286, 89
S.Ct. 534, 21 L.Ed.2d 487 (1969) also clarifies that the specific terminology
used in state law is not controlling; what matters is whether the conduct
falls within the category of unlawful activity intended to be covered by the
Travel Act, regardless of how a particular state labels that conduct.
For example, in National Organization for Women, Inc. v. Scheidler, 897
F.Supp. 1047 (N.D. Ill. 1995), the court recognized that state extortion laws
differ in their requirements, with some requiring that the perpetrator
receive property while others do not. The court allowed the Travel Act
allegation to proceed based on violations of state extortion laws that did not
require the defendant to receive property, as long as the plaintiff alleged
that these specific state laws were violated.
Exceptions and Caveats
Mere Patronage Not Sufficient
The Supreme Court in Rewis v. United States, 401 U.S. 808, 91 S.Ct. 1056,
28 L.Ed.2d 493 (1971) established an important limitation on the Travel
Act's scope, stating that "the traveler's purpose must involve more than the
desire to patronize the illegal activity." This means that merely being a
customer or recipient of an illegal service or product is not sufficient to
establish a Travel Act violation. The plaintiff must allege that the defendant
played an active role in promoting, managing, establishing, or carrying on
the unlawful activity.
Interstate Commerce Nexus Must Be Substantial
While the Travel Act requires only that the defendant used a facility of
interstate commerce or traveled interstate, courts generally require that this
interstate element be more than incidental or trivial. The use of interstate
facilities must be an integral part of the scheme to promote or facilitate the
unlawful activity.

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Causation by Third Parties
In U.S. v. Briggs, 700 F.2d 408 (7th Cir. 1983), the court noted that "a
defendant violates the Travel Act if he either causes another to travel in
interstate commerce or to use an interstate facility with the intent to commit
a violation of state law." This means that a plaintiff can allege that the
defendant caused others to engage in interstate travel or use interstate
facilities, even if the defendant personally did not cross state lines, as long
as the defendant had the requisite intent and the other elements are
satisfied.
Definition of "Unlawful Activity" Is Limited
The Travel Act specifically defines what constitutes "unlawful activity," and
this definition is exhaustive. A plaintiff cannot rely on violations of laws or
regulations that fall outside the categories specified in the statute, which
include business enterprises involving gambling, liquor, narcotics, or
prostitution offenses, as well as extortion, bribery, or arson.
Conclusion
To properly plead a violation of the Travel Act (18 U.S.C. § 1952) as a
predicate act for a RICO claim, a plaintiff must allege facts establishing
three essential elements: (1) interstate or foreign travel or use of a facility in
interstate or foreign commerce; (2) intent to promote, manage, establish,
carry on, or facilitate an unlawful activity; and (3) performance or attempted
performance of an act in furtherance of that unlawful activity after the travel
or use of the interstate facility.
The Travel Act is explicitly included as a predicate act for RICO claims
under 18 U.S.C. § 1961, which defines "racketeering activity" to include
violations of section 1952. Therefore, a properly pled Travel Act violation
can form a basis for a RICO claim, alongside other predicate acts.
When pleading a Travel Act violation, the plaintiff must identify the specific
unlawful activity that falls within the statutory definition, which includes
business enterprises involving gambling, liquor violations, narcotics, or
prostitution offenses, as well as extortion, bribery, or arson in violation of
state or federal law. When the unlawful activity involves a "business
enterprise," the plaintiff must allege facts showing a continuous course of
conduct rather than isolated incidents.
While the Travel Act requires determining that an underlying state or
federal law has been or could have been violated, courts have consistently
held that the actual accomplishment of the state substantive offense is not a
prerequisite to a Travel Act violation. It is sufficient to show that the
defendant intended to violate the law and took steps toward doing so.
The pleading requirements outlined above have been consistently applied by
federal courts across multiple circuits, reflecting a well-established
framework for alleging Travel Act violations as predicate acts in RICO

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
claims. By carefully addressing each of these elements with specific factual
allegations, a plaintiff can properly establish a Travel Act violation as a
predicate act for a RICO claim.
Legal Authorities
In re Managed Care Litigation, 150 F.Supp.2d 1330 (S.D. Fla. 2001)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of Florida
Extract
The Travel Act, 18 U.S.C.A. § 1952, establishes criminal liability for one who
travels in interstate commerce or uses the mail system, with intent to
'promote, manage, establish, carry on, or facilitate the promotion,
management, establishment, or carrying on, of any unlawful activity.' Id. The
Plaintiffs have properly pled predicate acts of extortion, and the Defendants
do not contest interstate travel or use of the mails. Hence, the Plaintiffs'
claim that the Defendants 'on numerous occasions traveled and caused
others ... to travel in interstate commerce in order to attempt to and to
commit ... extortion' is sufficient to allege the Travel Act violations.
Summary
Clear explanation of the elements required to plead a violation of the Travel
Act as a predicate act for a RICO claim. It specifies that there must be travel
in interstate commerce or use of the mail system with the intent to promote
or facilitate unlawful activity. The passage also illustrates that the plaintiffs
must demonstrate that they were directly and tangibly injured by the Travel
Act violations.
Rewis v. United States, 401 U.S. 808, 91 S.Ct. 1056, 28 L.Ed.2d 493 (1971)
U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
Section 1952, prohibits interstate travel with the intent to 'promote,
manage, establish, carry on, or facilitate' certain kinds of illegal activity; and
the ordinary meaning of this language suggests that the traveler's purpose
must involve more than the desire to patronize the illegal activity. ... Title 18
U.S.C. § 1952 (1964 ed. and Supp. V) provides: '(a) Whoever travels in
interstate or foreign commerce or uses any facility in interstate or foreign
commerce, including the mail, with intent to— '(1) distribute the proceeds of
any unlawful activity; or '(2) commit any crime of violence to further any
unlawful activity; or '(3) otherwise promote, manage, establish, carry on, or
facilitate the promotion, management, establishment, or carrying on, of any
unlawful activity, 'and thereafter performs or attempts to perform any of the

acts specified in subparagraphs (1), (2), and (3), shall be fined not more than
$10,000 or imprisoned for not more than five years, or both.
Summary
The passage from "Rewis v. United States" provides a clear interpretation of
the elements required to establish a violation of the Travel Act. It specifies
that the Act prohibits interstate travel with the intent to promote, manage,
establish, carry on, or facilitate certain illegal activities. The passage also
outlines the specific intents that must be present, such as distributing
proceeds of unlawful activity, committing a crime of violence to further
unlawful activity, or promoting or managing unlawful activity. This
interpretation is generally applicable to cases involving the Travel Act and is
essential for understanding what must be pled to establish a violation.
United States v. Nardello, 393 U.S. 286, 89 S.Ct. 534, 21 L.Ed.2d 487 (1969)
U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
The Travel Act, primarily designed to stem the 'clandestine flow of profits'
and to be of 'material assistance to the States in combating pernicious
undertakings which cross State lines,' thus reflects a congressional
judgment that certain activities of organized crime which were violative of
state law had become a national problem. ... Appellees argue that Congress'
decision not to define extortion combined with its decision to prohibit only
extortion in violation of state law compels the conclusion that peculiar
versions of state terminology are controlling. ... Congress' intent was to aid
local law enforcement officials, not to eradicate only those extortionate
activities which any given State denominated extortion.
Summary
The passage from United States v. Nardello provides insight into the
interpretation of the Travel Act, particularly regarding its application to
extortionate activities. The Supreme Court clarified that the Travel Act was
intended to address organized crime activities that cross state lines and
violate state laws, regardless of the specific terminology used by individual
states. This means that for a violation of the Travel Act to be established, it
is not necessary for the conduct to be labeled as "extortion" under state law,
as long as it constitutes an extortionate activity that is illegal under state
law. This interpretation is crucial for understanding how the Travel Act can
serve as a predicate act for a RICO claim.

Extract
Thus, in a case such as this, a Travel Act conviction must be based on (a) an
unlawful activity, generally termed an 'enterprise'; (b) knowledge of the
defendant of the unlawful activity; and (c) use of interstate commerce (1) to
facilitate the carrying on of the unlawful activity or, (2) to distribute the
proceeds.
Summary
The passage from U.S. v. Corona outlines the necessary elements for a
Travel Act violation, which can serve as a predicate act for a RICO claim.
These elements include: (a) the existence of an unlawful activity or
enterprise, (b) the defendant's knowledge of this unlawful activity, and (c)
the use of interstate commerce to either facilitate the unlawful activity or
distribute its proceeds. This information is directly relevant to
understanding what must be pled to establish a Travel Act violation in the
context of a RICO claim.

U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
Petitioner, with others, was indicted for violating and conspiring to violate
the Travel Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1952, which makes it a federal offense to travel or
use a facility in interstate commerce to commit, inter alia, 'bribery... in
violation of the laws of the State in which committed.' ... The Travel Act
provides in part: '(a) Whoever travels in interstate or foreign commerce or
uses any facility in interstate or foreign commerce, including the mail, with
intent to— (1) distribute the proceeds of any unlawful activity; or (2) commit
any crime of violence to further any unlawful activity; or ... The statute also
makes it a federal offense to travel or use a facility in interstate commerce
to commit 'extortion [or] bribery... in violation of the laws of the State in
which committed or of the United States.'
Summary
The passage from Perrin v. United States provides insight into the elements
required to establish a violation of the Travel Act. It specifies that the Travel
Act makes it a federal offense to travel or use a facility in interstate
commerce with the intent to distribute proceeds of unlawful activity or
commit crimes such as bribery or extortion in violation of state or federal
laws. This indicates that the elements to be pled include: (1) travel or use of
a facility in interstate commerce, (2) intent to engage in unlawful activity,
and (3) the commission of an act such as bribery or extortion that violates
state or federal law.

National Organization for Women, Inc. v. Scheidler, 897 F.Supp. 1047 (N.D.
Ill. 1995)
U.S. District Court — Northern District of Illinois
Extract
The Terry Defendants argue that the Travel Act allegations are insufficient
because the Travel Act requires that underlying acts of extortion, bribery, or
arson be pled. Moreover, the Defendants maintain that extortion under the
Travel Act requires that property be obtained by the perpetrator. Plaintiffs
argue that no property need be received by the perpetrator; all that need be
satisfied is that state extortion statute be violated. Plaintiffs maintain that
the extortion laws of Alabama, Colorado, Florida, Hawaii, Indiana, Kansas,
Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi,
Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, Rhode Island,
Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Wisconsin, and Wyoming do not require that the
defendant receive property from the victim; only that the victim to give up
either a tangible or an intangible property right. Plaintiffs also argue that
Defendants violated these laws. ... The Travel Act is violated when the
underlying state’s law is violated and that violation affects interstate
commerce. Thus, the Travel Act allegations, as alleged by DWHO, are also
well-pled.
Summary
Requirements for pleading a violation of the Travel Act as a predicate act for
a RICO claim. It highlights that the Travel Act requires the pleading of

=== PAGE 13 ===

underlying acts such as extortion, bribery, or arson. The passage also
clarifies that the definition of extortion under the Travel Act is determined
by state law, and it is sufficient to show that the state extortion statute was
violated, which may not necessarily require the perpetrator to receive
property. Additionally, the violation must affect interstate commerce. This
information is directly relevant to understanding the elements needed to
establish a Travel Act violation as a predicate act for RICO.

Summary
The passage clearly outlines the elements required to establish a violation of
the Travel Act, which are necessary to plead it as a predicate act for a RICO
claim. These elements include the use of interstate or foreign commerce
facilities, intent to promote or facilitate unlawful activity, and the
performance or attempt to perform such unlawful activity. This information
is directly relevant to understanding what must be pled in a legal context.

U.S. District Court — District of Utah
Extract
§ 1952. Interstate and foreign travel or transportation in aid of racketeering
enterprises (a) Whoever travels in interstate or foreign commerce or uses
any facility in interstate or foreign commerce, including the mail, with intent
to— (1) distribute the proceeds of any unlawful activity; or (2) commit any
crime of violence to further any unlawful activity; or (3) otherwise promote,
manage, establish, carry on, or facilitate the promotion, management,
establishment, or carrying on of any unlawful activity, and thereafter
performs or attempts to perform any of the acts specified in subparagraphs
(1), (2), and (3), shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned for not
more than five years, or both. (b) As used in this section 'unlawful activity'
means (1) any business enterprise involving gambling, liquor on which a

Federal excise tax has not been paid, narcotics, or prostitution offenses in
violation of the laws of the State in which they are committed or of the
United States, or (2) extortion or bribery in violation of the laws of the State
in which committed or of the United States.
Summary
The passage from the United States v. Synodinos case provides a clear
outline of the elements required to establish a violation of the Travel Act. It
specifies that the act involves traveling in interstate or foreign commerce or
using any facility in such commerce with the intent to distribute proceeds of
unlawful activity, commit a crime of violence to further unlawful activity, or
promote/manage/carry on unlawful activity. Additionally, it defines "unlawful
activity" to include certain business enterprises and offenses. This
information is crucial for understanding what must be pled in a RICO claim
involving the Travel Act.

U.S. Court of Appeals — Eighth Circuit
Extract
18 U.S.C. Sec. 1952(a) (1988). To establish a Travel Act violation, the
government thus must prove that Admon traveled in interstate commerce
with intent to distribute the proceeds of cocaine sales, and that she
performed or attempted to perform some act in furtherance of the unlawful
activity after arriving in Los Angeles. See United States v. Becton, 751 F.2d
250, 255 (8th Cir.1984), cert. denied, 472 U.S. 1018, 105 S.Ct. 3480, 87
L.Ed.2d 615 (1985); see also United States v. Zolicoffer, 869 F.2d 771, 774
(3d Cir.) (Travel Act violation requires some overt act in furtherance of the
unlawful activity subsequent to the travel), cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1113, 109
S.Ct. 3172, 104 L.Ed.2d 1034 (1989).
Summary
To establish a violation of the Travel Act, the government must prove two
main elements: (1) the defendant traveled in interstate commerce with the
intent to engage in unlawful activity, such as distributing the proceeds of
illegal sales, and (2) the defendant performed or attempted to perform some
act in furtherance of the unlawful activity after the travel. This is a general
requirement for proving a Travel Act violation and is applicable in various
cases where the Travel Act is invoked.
U.S. v. Pomponio, 511 F.2d 953 (4th Cir. 1975)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fourth Circuit

=== PAGE 15 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
The indictment tracks the language of the statute charging that the
defendants 'did willfully travel from the State of Virginia to the State of New
York, with the intent to promote, manage, carry on, and facilitate the
promoting, managing, establishing and carrying on of an unlawful activity,
said unlawful activity being the crime of bribery, in violation of the laws of
the State of New York (New York Penal Law, McKinney's Consol.Law, c. 40,
Article 180) and of the United States (Title 18, United States Code, Section
215); the said unlawful activity relating to the efforts of LOUIS J.
POMPONIO, JR., CHARLES J. PILUSO and PAUL POMPONIO to influence
Sidney M. Zneimer in the performance of his duties at the Royal National
Bank by giving the said Sidney M. Zneimer checks, as detailed in the table
below * * *.' ... Proof that the unlawful objective was accomplished or that
the referenced law has actually been violated is not a necessary element of
the offense defined in section 1952.
Summary
The passage from U.S. v. Pomponio provides insight into the elements
required to establish a violation of the Travel Act. It specifies that the
indictment must allege that the defendants willfully traveled interstate with
the intent to promote, manage, or facilitate an unlawful activity, such as
bribery. Importantly, it clarifies that it is not necessary to prove that the
unlawful objective was accomplished or that the law was actually violated,
only that there was intent to facilitate the unlawful activity.
U.S. v. Teplin, 775 F.2d 1261 (4th Cir. 1985)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fourth Circuit
Extract
Relevant portions of the Travel Act, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1952, provide the
following: Sec. 1952. Interstate and foreign travel or transportation in aid of
racketeering enterprises (a) Whoever travels in interstate or foreign
commerce or uses any facility in interstate or foreign commerce, including
the mail, with intent to-- (1) distribute the proceeds of any unlawful activity;
or (2) commit any crime of violence to further any unlawful activity; or (3)
otherwise promote, manage, establish, carry on, or facilitate the promotion,
management, establishment, or carrying on, of any unlawful activity, and
thereafter performs or attempts to perform any of the acts specified in
subparagraphs (1), (2), and (3), shall be fined not more than $10,000 or
imprisoned for not more than five years, or both. (b) As used in this section
'unlawful activity' means ... (2) extortion, bribery, or arson in violation of the
laws of the State in which committed or of the United States. While the
Travel Act requires a determination that the underlying state law has been
or could have been violated, 'accomplishment of the state substantive
offense is not a prerequisite to a Section 1952 conviction.'

Summary
The passage from U.S. v. Teplin provides a clear outline of the elements
required to establish a violation of the Travel Act. It specifies that the
defendant must have traveled in interstate or foreign commerce or used a
facility in such commerce with the intent to engage in unlawful activities
such as distributing proceeds of unlawful activity, committing a crime of
violence, or promoting unlawful activity. Additionally, the defendant must
perform or attempt to perform acts in furtherance of these unlawful
activities. The passage also clarifies that while the underlying state law
violation must be determined, the actual accomplishment of the state
offense is not necessary for a conviction under the Travel Act.
U.S. v. Corbin, 662 F.2d 1066 (4th Cir. 1981)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fourth Circuit
Extract
Corbin and Ruggiero argue that there was insufficient evidence to support a
finding that they promoted a 'business enterprise' in violation of the Travel
Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1952. Subsection (a) of § 1952 prohibits travel in 'interstate
or foreign commerce ... with intent to ... (3) promote, manage, establish, or
facilitate ... any unlawful activity.' Subsection (b) defines unlawful activity, in
part, as 'any business enterprise involving ... narcotics.' ... Although the
Travel Act does not define 'business enterprise,' the term has consistently
been construed to require 'a continuous course of conduct.' ... In this regard,
we hold only that a continuous course of conduct is necessary to establish
the existence of a business enterprise.
Summary
To establish a violation of the Travel Act as a predicate act for a RICO claim,
it is necessary to demonstrate that the defendant engaged in a "business
enterprise" involving unlawful activity. The term "business enterprise"
requires a "continuous course of conduct," rather than isolated or sporadic
incidents. This interpretation is consistent with the legislative intent to
target organized crime rather than casual or isolated criminal acts.

be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned for not more than five years,
or both.
Summary
Elements required to establish a violation of the Travel Act under 18 U.S.C. §
1952. These elements include: (1) traveling in interstate or foreign
commerce or using any facility in interstate or foreign commerce, including
the mail; (2) having the intent to distribute the proceeds of any unlawful
activity, commit any crime of violence to further any unlawful activity, or
otherwise promote, manage, establish, carry on, or facilitate the promotion,
management, establishment, or carrying on of any unlawful activity; and (3)
thereafter performing or attempting to perform any of the acts specified in
the intent element. This information is crucial for understanding what must
be pled to establish a Travel Act violation as a predicate act for a RICO
claim.
U.S. v. Briggs, 700 F.2d 408 (7th Cir. 1983)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Seventh Circuit
Extract
The gravamen of a charge under section 1952 'is the use of an interstate
facility [telephone], with the intent to promote or further an unlawful
activity in violation of state law, and the performance of some act designed
to promote or further that illegal purpose.' United States v. Rizzo, 418 F.2d
71, 74 (7th Cir.1969), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 967, 90 S.Ct. 1006, 25 L.Ed.2d
260 (1970). Moreover, case law is clear that a defendant violates the Travel
Act if he either causes another to travel in interstate commerce or to use an
interstate facility with the intent to commit a violation of state law.
Summary
To establish a violation of the Travel Act, the following elements must be
pled: (1) the use of an interstate facility or travel in interstate commerce, (2)
with the intent to promote or further an unlawful activity that violates state
law, and (3) the performance of some act designed to promote or further
that illegal purpose. This is applicable to any case involving the Travel Act,
making it a potential predicate act for a RICO claim.

Extract
RICO, 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), requires proof that defendants engaged in
'racketeering activity.' The predicate offenses alleged in Count Two are
multiple violations of the Travel Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1952. Section 1961(1)(B)
defines 'racketeering activity' as including '... any act which is indictable
under ... Title 18, United States Code: ... section 1952,' the Travel Act. It is a
violation of the Travel Act for any person to 'travel in interstate or foreign
commerce or use any facility of interstate or foreign commerce ... with
intent to ... promote, manage, establish, carry on, or facilitate the
promotion, ... of any unlawful activity....' 18 U.S.C. § 1952(a)(3). 'Unlawful
activity' is defined in § 1952(b)(2) as, inter alia, '... bribery ... in violations of
the law of the state in which committed or of the United States....'
Summary
Clear explanation of what constitutes a violation of the Travel Act, which can
serve as a predicate act for a RICO claim. It specifies that a violation occurs
when a person travels in or uses facilities of interstate or foreign commerce
with the intent to promote or facilitate unlawful activities, such as bribery.
This definition is crucial for understanding how the Travel Act can be used
as a predicate offense under RICO.
United States v. Fernandez, 722 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2013)
U.S. Court of Appeals — First Circuit
Extract
Hence, to prove a conspiracy to violate the Travel Act, the government must
show (1) a conspiratorial agreement (2) to travel (3) in aid of a specified
unlawful activity.
Summary
The passage from the United States v. Fernandez case provides a clear
outline of the elements required to establish a violation of the Travel Act. It
specifies that the government must demonstrate a conspiratorial agreement,
the act of traveling, and that the travel was in aid of a specified unlawful
activity. This is directly relevant to understanding what must be pled to
establish a Travel Act violation as a predicate act for a RICO claim.
U.S. v. Gallo, 782 F.2d 1191 (4th Cir. 1986)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fourth Circuit

=== PAGE 19 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
To support a conviction under the Travel Act, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1952, the
government must prove three elements: (a) interstate travel; (b) intent to
promote unlawful activity, i.e., a business enterprise; and, (c) performance
or attempted performance of an unlawful act. ... One element of a Travel Act
violation is proof of specific intent to promote 'unlawful activity', defined for
relevant purposes, as any illegal business enterprise involving narcotics or
controlled substances. ... the term 'business enterprise' means a continuous
course of conduct, rather than a sporadic, casual, individual or isolated
violation.
Summary
The passage from U.S. v. Gallo provides a clear outline of the elements
required to establish a violation of the Travel Act, which are necessary for it
to serve as a predicate act in a RICO claim. The elements include interstate
travel, intent to promote an unlawful business enterprise, and the
performance or attempted performance of an unlawful act. The definition of
"business enterprise" as a continuous course of conduct is crucial for
understanding what constitutes "unlawful activity" under the Act.
U.S. v. Zolicoffer, 869 F.2d 771 (3rd Cir. 1989)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Third Circuit
Extract
As we stated in United States v. Wander, 601 F.2d 1251 (3d Cir.1979), 'there
are three elements of proof of a Travel Act violation: (1) interstate travel or
use of an interstate facility (2) with intent to promote an unlawful activity
and (3) a subsequent overt act in furtherance of the unlawful activity.' Id. at
1258.
Summary
The passage clearly outlines the three elements necessary to establish a
violation of the Travel Act, which are crucial for understanding how such a
violation can serve as a predicate act for a RICO claim. The elements include
interstate travel or use of an interstate facility, intent to promote unlawful
activity, and a subsequent overt act in furtherance of that unlawful activity.
This information is applicable to any case involving the Travel Act.
U.S. v. Becton, 751 F.2d 250 (8th Cir. 1985)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Eighth Circuit

=== PAGE 20 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
The Travel Act, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1952(a)(1982), provides as follows: Whoever
travels in interstate or foreign commerce or uses any facility in interstate or
foreign commerce, including the mail, with intent to-- (1) distribute the
proceeds of any unlawful activity; or (2) commit any crime of violence to
further any unlawful activity; or (3) otherwise promote, manage, establish,
carry on, or facilitate the promotion, management, establishment, or
carrying on, of any unlawful activity, and thereafter performs or attempts to
perform any of the acts specified in subparagraphs (1), (2), and (3), shall be
fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned for not more than five years, or
both. ... Turning to the second Travel Act violation (Count IV), we observe
that the evidence differs in one significant respect: neither Becton nor
anyone in his entourage actually acquired any marijuana during the second
trip to Florida in January of 1980. The record only shows that Becton
travelled to Florida with the intent to acquire marijuana. Intent alone does
not satisfy the requirements of the Travel Act. We agree with Becton that
the government failed to prove that he performed or attempted to perform
some act in furtherance of his illegal activity after his arrival in Florida.
Summary
To establish a violation of the Travel Act, it is not sufficient to merely
demonstrate intent to engage in unlawful activity. The statute requires that
after traveling or using a facility in interstate or foreign commerce with the
requisite intent, the individual must also perform or attempt to perform an
act in furtherance of the unlawful activity. This interpretation is generally
applicable to cases involving the Travel Act.

Summary
The passage from the case United States of America v. Rizzo provides a
direct excerpt from 18 U.S.C. § 1952, which outlines the elements necessary
to establish a violation of the Travel Act. Specifically, it requires the use of
any facility in interstate commerce with the intent to promote, manage,

Whoever travels in interstate or foreign commerce or uses the mail or any
facility in interstate or foreign commerce, with intent to- distribute the
proceeds of any unlawful activity; or commit any crime of violence to further
any unlawful activity; or otherwise promote, manage, establish, carry on, or
facilitate the promotion, management, establishment, or carrying on, of any
unlawful activity, and thereafter performs or attempts to perform- (A) an act

more than 5 years, or both; or (B) an act described in paragraph shall be
fined under this title, imprisoned for not more than 20 years, or both, and if
death results shall be imprisoned for any term of years or for life.
Summary
To establish a violation of the Travel Act as a predicate act for a RICO claim,
the following elements must be pled: (1) the defendant traveled in interstate
or foreign commerce or used the mail or any facility in interstate or foreign
commerce; (2) with the intent to distribute the proceeds of any unlawful
activity, commit any crime of violence to further any unlawful activity, or
otherwise promote, manage, establish, carry on, or facilitate the promotion,
management, establishment, or carrying on, of any unlawful activity; and (3)
thereafter performed or attempted to perform an act in furtherance of the
unlawful activity.
18 U.S.C. § 1961 18 U.S.C. § 1961 Definitions

As used in this chapter- 'racketeering activity' means ... (B) any act which is
indictable under any of the following provisions of title 18, United States
Code: ... section 1952 (relating to racketeering) ...
Summary
A violation of the Travel Act (18 U.S.C. § 1952) is considered "racketeering
activity" under the RICO statute. This means that for a RICO claim, a
violation of the Travel Act can serve as a predicate act. The passage does
not specify the elements of the Travel Act violation itself but confirms its
inclusion as a predicate act for RICO.

Summary
A Travel Act conviction can serve as a predicate act for a RICO claim. It
provides examples of cases where Travel Act convictions were used to
support RICO convictions, even when other predicate acts were invalidated.
This suggests that the Travel Act can be a standalone predicate act in a
RICO claim, provided it is legally sufficient and proven beyond a reasonable
doubt.
