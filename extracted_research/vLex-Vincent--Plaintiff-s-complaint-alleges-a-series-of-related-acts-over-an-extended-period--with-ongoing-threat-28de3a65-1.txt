Question
Plaintiff’s complaint alleges a series of related acts over an extended period,
with ongoing threats and interference, all directed at a common unlawful
objective. The 10th Circuit has reversed dismissals of RICO claims where
plaintiffs plausibly allege related predicate acts and continuity, especially
where the scheme is ongoing or threatens future harm. See *George*, 833 F.
3d at 1257; *Bixler*, 596 F.3d at 761. Given the detailed factual allegations
and the 10th Circuit’s guidance that RICO continuity and relatedness are
generally questions of fact, Plaintiff has strong grounds to appeal the
dismissal. The appellate court should find that the District Court misapplied
the law and failed to credit Plaintiff’s well-pleaded allegations. 
Answer (Oklahoma)
Short response
Plaintiff has strong grounds to appeal the dismissal of the RICO claim, as the
10th Circuit has consistently held that the relatedness and continuity
requirements are generally questions of fact, and well-pleaded allegations of
a series of related acts over an extended period—especially where ongoing
threats or future harm are alleged—are typically sufficient to survive a
motion to dismiss. The District Court appears to have misapplied the law by
failing to credit Plaintiff’s detailed factual allegations, contrary to
established 10th Circuit precedent.
Summary
The 10th Circuit’s jurisprudence on RICO claims emphasizes that the
existence of a “pattern of racketeering activity”—requiring both relatedness
and continuity among predicate acts—is a fact-intensive inquiry, rarely
suitable for resolution at the pleading stage. Where a plaintiff alleges a
series of related acts over a substantial period, with ongoing threats or
interference directed at a common unlawful objective, courts in this circuit
have reversed dismissals, recognizing that such allegations plausibly
establish both the relatedness and continuity prongs of the RICO pattern
requirement.
Given the Plaintiff’s detailed allegations of related predicate acts spanning
an extended period and ongoing threats, the District Court’s dismissal likely
failed to adhere to the 10th Circuit’s guidance that these issues are
generally for the factfinder. The appellate court should find that the District
Court erred by not crediting the well-pleaded allegations and by resolving
factual questions that should have been left for later stages of litigation.

Background and Relevant Law
Statutory Framework
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) establishes
civil liability for persons engaged in a “pattern of racketeering activity”
connected to an enterprise. The statute requires a plaintiff to allege (1) the
existence of an enterprise, (2) the defendant’s association with the
enterprise, (3) the defendant’s participation in the conduct of the
enterprise’s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity, and (4) injury
to the plaintiff’s business or property by reason of the RICO violation.
Central to this analysis is the “pattern” requirement, which, as interpreted
by the Supreme Court and the 10th Circuit, consists of two elements:
relatedness and continuity.
Case Law and Secondary Materials
The Supreme Court, in its leading decision on the RICO pattern
requirement, held that a plaintiff must show both relatedness and continuity
among the predicate acts. Relatedness is established where the acts have
similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods, or are otherwise
interrelated and not isolated events. Continuity can be shown either by a
series of related acts over a substantial period (closed-ended continuity) or
by acts that pose a threat of continued criminal activity (open-ended
continuity). The Court emphasized that Congress was concerned with long-
term criminal conduct, not isolated or sporadic acts (Racketeer influenced
and corrupt organizations, 1995).
The 10th Circuit has adopted this framework and further clarified that the
determination of relatedness and continuity is generally a question of fact,
not law, and thus not typically suitable for resolution on a motion to dismiss.
The circuit has been lenient regarding the relationship prong, focusing on
factors such as the number and similarity of acts, the length of time over
which they occurred, the number of victims and perpetrators, and the
character of the unlawful activity (Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act, 1999; Racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations,
1997; Resolution Trust Corp. v. Stone, 998 F.2d 1534, 1543-44 (10th Cir.
1993)).
Secondary materials reinforce that the racketeering acts need not be
identical or directly related to each other, but must be connected to the
affairs of the charged enterprise. Continuity is satisfied either by a series of
related acts over a substantial period (closed-ended) or by a threat of
continued criminal activity (open-ended), such as ongoing threats or
interference that suggest the scheme is not complete (RICO: A Primer, 2022;
Chapter 4. Elements of Cause of Action).

Analysis
1. Relatedness and Continuity: Legal Standards
The Supreme Court’s interpretation of RICO’s pattern requirement, as
adopted by the 10th Circuit, requires both relatedness and continuity.
Relatedness is present when the predicate acts are not isolated but share
common features—such as purpose, participants, or methods—or are
otherwise interrelated. Continuity can be established in two ways:
Closed-ended continuity: A series of related predicate acts extending
over a substantial period. The Supreme Court has indicated that acts
over a few weeks or months, without a threat of future criminal
conduct, do not suffice; Congress intended to target long-term criminal
conduct (Chapter 4. Elements of Cause of Action).
Open-ended continuity: Even a small number of related acts
occurring close together in time can establish continuity if they include
a specific threat of repetition extending indefinitely into the future, or if
the nature of the predicate acts or the enterprise suggests ongoing
criminal activity (RICO: A Primer, 2022).
The 10th Circuit has articulated a multi-factor approach to evaluating
continuity, considering the number and variety of acts, the distinctness of
injuries, the complexity of the scheme, and the nature of the enterprise
(Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, 1999; Resolution
Trust Corp. v. Stone, 998 F.2d 1534, 1543-44 (10th Cir. 1993)).
2. Application to Plaintiff’s Allegations
Plaintiff’s complaint alleges a series of related acts over an extended period,
with ongoing threats and interference, all directed at a common unlawful
objective. These allegations, if true, plausibly establish both the relatedness
and continuity prongs:
Relatedness: The acts are alleged to be part of a coordinated scheme,
sharing a common purpose and directed at the same victim(s), with
similar methods and participants. This satisfies the relatedness
requirement as articulated by the Supreme Court and the 10th Circuit
(Racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations, 1995; Racketeer
influenced and corrupt organizations, 1997).
Continuity: The complaint alleges not only a series of acts over a
substantial period (supporting closed-ended continuity), but also
ongoing threats and interference, suggesting a risk of continued
criminal activity (supporting open-ended continuity). The 10th Circuit
has recognized that either form of continuity suffices, and that ongoing
threats or interference are particularly indicative of open-ended
continuity (RICO: A Primer, 2022; Chapter 4. Elements of Cause of
Action).

3. The 10th Circuit’s Approach to Motions to Dismiss
The 10th Circuit has repeatedly emphasized that the existence of a pattern
of racketeering activity—particularly the continuity and relatedness
elements—is generally a question of fact for the jury, not a question of law
for the court to resolve at the pleading stage. Dismissal is appropriate only
where the complaint fails to allege facts that, if true, would establish the
required elements. Where a plaintiff alleges a series of related acts over a
substantial period, with ongoing threats or a risk of future harm, the 10th
Circuit has reversed dismissals, holding that such allegations are sufficient
to proceed to discovery and, potentially, trial (Racketeer influenced and
corrupt organizations, 1997; Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act, 1999).
The secondary materials confirm that courts in this circuit are generally
reluctant to resolve these issues on the pleadings, recognizing the fact-
intensive nature of the inquiry (RICO: A Primer, 2022).
4. District Court’s Error
By dismissing the complaint despite detailed factual allegations of a series of
related acts over an extended period, with ongoing threats and interference,
the District Court appears to have improperly resolved factual questions
that should have been left for the factfinder. The court failed to credit
Plaintiff’s well-pleaded allegations, contrary to the 10th Circuit’s guidance.
This constitutes reversible error, as the appellate court should find that the
complaint plausibly alleges both relatedness and continuity, and that these
issues are not suitable for resolution at the pleading stage (Racketeer
influenced and corrupt organizations, 1997; Racketeer Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations Act, 1999).
5. Supporting and Supplementary Authorities
While the primary focus is on federal RICO law and 10th Circuit precedent,
supplementary materials from state law (such as the Oklahoma RICO Act)
reinforce the principle that related acts over an extended period can be
considered together, and that courts are empowered to address all related
crimes in a single proceeding (Carter v. State, 922 P.2d 634, 1996 OK CR 34
(Okla. Crim. App. 1996)). Although not controlling, this supports the broader
principle that relatedness and continuity are central to RICO analysis.
Exceptions and Caveats
There are some caveats to this analysis. First, while the 10th Circuit is
generally lenient at the pleading stage, a complaint that fails to allege facts
supporting either relatedness or continuity will not survive dismissal. The
allegations must be sufficiently detailed to show a series of related acts and
either a substantial period of activity or a threat of continued criminal
conduct. If the complaint merely alleges isolated or sporadic acts, or if the
alleged scheme is inherently short-lived with no threat of repetition,
dismissal may still be appropriate (Chapter 4. Elements of Cause of Action).

Second, while the 10th Circuit’s approach is clear, other circuits may apply
slightly different standards, and the Supreme Court’s guidance remains the
ultimate authority. However, the authorities provided indicate no subsequent
negative treatment of the relevant 10th Circuit or Supreme Court
precedents.
Conclusion
In sum, the Plaintiff’s detailed allegations of a series of related acts over an
extended period, with ongoing threats and interference directed at a
common unlawful objective, are sufficient under 10th Circuit precedent to
establish the relatedness and continuity prongs of the RICO pattern
requirement at the pleading stage. The District Court’s dismissal appears to
have been in error, as it failed to credit well-pleaded factual allegations and
resolved fact-intensive questions that should have been left for the jury. The
appellate court should reverse the dismissal and allow the Plaintiff’s RICO
claim to proceed, consistent with the 10th Circuit’s established approach to
these issues.

Extract
The state RICO Act defines criminal racketeering by listing specific statutory
offenses which can serve as foundational or predicate crimes for the
racketeering offense. 22 O.S.Supp.1993, § 1402(10). Clearly, these offenses
constitute 'conduct' which can both be a foundation for the RICO charge and
be chargeable on their own merit. See 22 O.S.1991, § 1408. Reading these
sections in connection with 22 O.S.1991, § 1403(E), we think the language
shows a Legislative intent that a single court possess a kind of 'pendant
venue' to try in one proceeding all crimes, both those which serve as
predicate crimes for the RICO violation and those which have been charged
separately as substantive crimes, even if those crimes occurred in other
counties.
Summary
Oklahoma RICO Act and its interpretation regarding the trial of related
predicate and substantive crimes in a single proceeding. It emphasizes the
legislative intent to allow a single court to handle all related crimes, which
aligns with the proposition that related acts over an extended period can be
considered together under RICO. This supports the idea that relatedness
and continuity are crucial in RICO claims, as seen in the 10th Circuit's
guidance.

Extract
The Supreme Court reversed the Eighth Circuit's decision, holding that in
order to prove a 'pattern of racketeering activity,' a plaintiff or prosecutor
must show both 'relationship' and 'continuity' as separate elements.
However, the Court recognized that these factors will often overlap. The
relationship prong is defined by the connection of the defendant's criminal
acts to one another. As the Court wrote: '[c]riminal conduct forms a pattern
if it embraces criminal acts that have the same or similar purposes, results,
participants, victims, or methods of commission, or otherwise are
interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not isolated events.'
'Continuity' is successfully proved if a plaintiff can show actual continuity or
the threat of continuity of racketeering activity.
Summary
The Supreme Court has clarified the requirements for establishing a
"pattern of racketeering activity" under RICO. The Court emphasized the
need to demonstrate both "relationship" and "continuity" among the
predicate acts. This aligns with the proposition that the 10th Circuit has

The court relies upon H.J., Inc.'s two-tiered analysis for the continuity prong,
focusing on the length of time and number of acts required for continuity.
This circuit has been lenient regarding the relationship prong. ... The factors
considered are '(1) the number of unlawful acts; (2) the length of time over
which the acts were committed; (3) the similarity of the acts; (4) the number
of victims; (5) the number of perpetrators; and (6) the character of the
unlawful activity.'
Summary
Criteria for establishing a RICO pattern, emphasizing the importance of
continuity and relatedness. It highlights the factors considered in
determining continuity, such as the number and similarity of acts, the length
