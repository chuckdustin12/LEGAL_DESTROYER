Question
Extortion Under Color of Official Right Extortion under color of official right
does not require proof of force, threats, or duress when the defendant is a
public official. The wrongful use of official power itself supplies the
necessary coercive element (U.S. v. Williams, 621 F.2d 123, 124 (5th Cir.
1980); U.S. v. Dozier, 672 F.2d 531, 537 (5th Cir. 1982); U.S. v. Wright, 797 F.
2d 245, 250 (5th Cir. 1986); U.S. v. Stephens, 964 F.2d 424, 427 (5th Cir.
1992)). The essence of extortion by a public official is the misuse of official
position to obtain property not due to the official or their office. The
wrongful use of otherwise valid official power can convert what would
otherwise be a lawful act into extortion (Reagan v. Warden FCI Oakdale,
CIVIL ACTION NO. 2:17-cv-0807 SECTION P (W.D. La. Dec 27, 2018); U.S. v.
Pattan, 931 F.2d 1035, 1040 (5th Cir. 1991); United States v. Hyde, 448 F.2d
815, 833 (5th Cir. 1971)). Consent obtained through fear of economic loss,
fear of official sanction, or abuse of official power is not true consent for
purposes of the statute. The courts have recognized that the fear induced by
a public official's authority can be sufficient to satisfy the statutory
requirement (United States v. Rashad, 687 F.3d 637, 643 (5th Cir. 2012);
U.S. v. Brown, 298 F.3d 392, 399 (5th Cir. 2002)). The Hobbs Act applies not
only to public officials but also to private individuals who aid, abet, or
conspire with public officials to commit extortion under color of official right
(United States v. Rosenthal, 805 F.3d 523, 531 (5th Cir. 2015); United States
v. Rashad, 687 F.3d 637, 643 (5th Cir. 2012)). In U.S. v. Williams, the court
held that the coercive element is supplied by the existence of the public
office itself, and that a conviction may be sustained upon a finding that
property was unlawfully obtained under color of official right, without any
need to show personal benefit or actual or threatened force, violence, or
fear (U.S. v. Williams, 621 F.2d 123, 124 (5th Cir. 1980)). U.S. v. Dozier and
U.S. v. Wright further clarify that the wrongful use of otherwise valid official
power may convert lawful action into extortion, and that the inducement
comes from the nature of the office, not from any personal gain (U.S. v.
Dozier, 672 F.2d 531, 537 (5th Cir. 1982); U.S. v. Wright, 797 F.2d 245, 250
(5th Cir. 1986)) Does this imply that if a judge commits extortion and
someone else benefits from it, this is enough to satisfy the extortion?
Answer (Fifth Circuit)
Short response
Yes, if a judge (or any public official) commits extortion under color of
official right, it is sufficient to satisfy the statutory requirements even if
someone else, rather than the judge, receives the benefit; the key element is
the wrongful use of official power to obtain property not due, regardless of
who ultimately benefits.

Summary
The law governing extortion under color of official right, particularly as
interpreted under the Hobbs Act and by the Fifth Circuit, does not require
that the public official personally receive the benefit of the extortionate act.
Instead, the focus is on the misuse of official authority to obtain property or
payments not due to the official or their office, and the coercive element is
supplied by the existence and misuse of the public office itself.
Multiple authorities confirm that the benefit of the extortionate act may flow
to a third party, and the offense is complete so long as the public official
knowingly uses their position to obtain property wrongfully, even if the
property is directed to someone else. The courts have also made clear that
private individuals who aid, abet, or conspire with public officials in such
schemes may also be liable, and the absence of personal gain to the official
does not negate the offense.
Background and Relevant Law
Statutory Framework
The principal statutory authority is the Hobbs Act, codified at 18 U.S.C. §
1951(b)(2), which defines extortion as the obtaining of property from
another, with their consent, induced by wrongful use of actual or threatened
force, violence, or fear, or under color of official right. The statute is
designed to address both public corruption and private criminal conduct
affecting interstate commerce.
Case Law
The Fifth Circuit and other federal courts have developed a robust body of
case law interpreting the Hobbs Act’s “under color of official right” prong.
The key elements, as consistently articulated, are:
The defendant is a public official (or acts in concert with one).
The official uses their position to obtain property not due to them or
their office.
The property is obtained with the victim’s consent, but that consent is
induced by the misuse of official power, not by true voluntariness.
Notably, the courts have repeatedly emphasized that, for public officials, the
coercive element is supplied by the office itself, and there is no need to
prove force, threats, or duress. The wrongful use of otherwise valid official
power is sufficient to convert lawful action into extortion.
Key Fifth Circuit Authorities
In U.S. v. Williams, 621 F.2d 123 (5th Cir. 1980), the court held that the
existence of the public office supplies the necessary coercive element,
1.

and a conviction may be sustained even without proof of personal
benefit or actual or threatened force, violence, or fear.
U.S. v. Dozier, 672 F.2d 531 (5th Cir. 1982) and U.S. v. Wright, 797 F.2d
245 (5th Cir. 1986) further clarify that the wrongful use of otherwise
valid official power may convert lawful action into extortion, and the
inducement comes from the nature of the office, not from any personal
gain.
U.S. v. Stephens, 964 F.2d 424 (5th Cir. 1992) and U.S. v. Pattan, 931 F.
2d 1035 (5th Cir. 1991) reinforce that the wrongful taking by a public
officer of money or property not due to them or their office constitutes
extortion, regardless of whether the taking was accomplished by force,
threats, or use of fear.
United States v. Rosenthal, 805 F.3d 523 (5th Cir. 2015) and United
States v. Rashad, 687 F.3d 637 (5th Cir. 2012) confirm that the Hobbs
Act applies to both public officials and private individuals who aid, abet,
or conspire with public officials to commit extortion under color of
official right.
Other Relevant Authorities
Reagan v. Warden FCI Oakdale, CIVIL ACTION NO. 2:17-cv-0807
SECTION P (W.D. La. Dec 27, 2018) explains that a public official is
guilty of extortion if they accept or demand property in return for
promised performance or nonperformance of an official act, and that a
private citizen can be guilty of conspiracy to commit such extortion if
the scheme involves a public official knowingly participating and
benefiting from it.
U.S. v. Carlock, 806 F.2d 535 (5th Cir. 1986) and United States v. Hyde,
448 F.2d 815 (5th Cir. 1971) both make clear that the gravamen of the
offense is the loss to the victim, not the personal benefit to the official.
Administrative Decisions
The administrative decision in Matter of [Name redacted] (2016)
supports the proposition that, under the Hobbs Act, extortion under
color of official right does not require a threat or affirmative act of
inducement by a public official; the coercive element is satisfied by the
official’s position itself, and the benefit need not be personal to the
official.
Secondary Materials
Secondary sources, such as “The Bleeding Edge of Extortion: How
Disregarding the Personal Benefit Poses a Danger in Novel Extortion
Cases,” confirm that direct receipt of property or benefits by the
extortionist is not necessary; it is sufficient if the property is directed to
a third party.
Other commentary, such as “CRIMINAL LAW--EXTORTION OR PUBLIC
POLICY, WHERE DO WE DRAW THE LINE?” and “The Hobbs leviathan:
the dangerous breadth of the Hobbs Act and other corruption statutes,”
•

reinforce that the “obtaining of property” element can be satisfied even
if the public official does not personally benefit.
Analysis
The Core Question: Is Personal Benefit to the Official
Required?
The central issue is whether, under the Hobbs Act and its interpretation by
the Fifth Circuit, extortion under color of official right requires that the
public official personally receive the benefit, or whether it is sufficient that
someone else benefits as a result of the official’s misuse of power.
The overwhelming weight of authority confirms that personal benefit to the
official is not required. The focus is on the misuse of official power to obtain
property not due, and the offense is complete once the official, acting under
color of office, wrongfully obtains property, regardless of who ultimately
receives it.
Case Law Synthesis
In U.S. v. Williams (621 F.2d 123, 124 (5th Cir. 1980)), the court
explicitly stated that the coercive element is supplied by the existence
of the public office itself, and a conviction may be sustained without any
need to show personal benefit or actual or threatened force, violence,
or fear.
U.S. v. Dozier (672 F.2d 531, 537 (5th Cir. 1982)) and U.S. v. Wright
(797 F.2d 245, 250 (5th Cir. 1986)) both reinforce that the wrongful use
of otherwise valid official power may convert lawful action into
extortion, and the inducement comes from the nature of the office, not
from any personal gain.
U.S. v. Carlock (806 F.2d 535 (5th Cir. 1986)) and United States v. Hyde
(448 F.2d 815 (5th Cir. 1971)) clarify that the gravamen of the offense is
the loss to the victim, not the personal benefit to the official. In Hyde,
the court held that one need not receive a personal benefit to be guilty
of extortion; the key is the loss to the victim.
United States v. Rosenthal (805 F.3d 523 (5th Cir. 2015)) is particularly
instructive. In that case, a private individual was charged with aiding
and abetting a judge in committing extortion by providing money for
favorable judicial acts. The benefit flowed to the private individual, not
the judge, but the court found this sufficient to satisfy the requirements
of extortion under the Hobbs Act.
United States v. Rashad (687 F.3d 637 (5th Cir. 2012)) further confirms
that the benefit does not need to be personal to the public official;
involvement in the extortion scheme is sufficient for liability.

Administrative and Secondary Support
The administrative decision in Matter of [Name redacted] (2016)
supports the view that the coercive element is satisfied by the official’s
position, and the benefit need not be personal.
Secondary materials, including “The Bleeding Edge of Extortion,”
confirm that the property may be directed to a third party, and the
offense is still complete.
Application to the Judge Scenario
Applying these principles, if a judge uses their official position to obtain
property not due—whether for themselves or for another—the offense of
extortion under color of official right is satisfied. The key is the knowing
misuse of official power to obtain property, not the identity of the ultimate
beneficiary.
For example, if a judge accepts a bribe on behalf of a friend or directs that a
payment be made to a third party in exchange for a favorable ruling, the
judge’s conduct constitutes extortion under color of official right. The fact
that the judge does not personally receive the benefit is immaterial; the
wrongful use of official power is the critical element.
Liability of Private Individuals
The law also makes clear that private individuals who aid, abet, or conspire
with public officials in such schemes are equally liable. United States v.
Rosenthal (805 F.3d 523 (5th Cir. 2015)) and United States v. Rashad (687 F.
3d 637 (5th Cir. 2012)) both confirm that private parties who participate in
or benefit from the extortionate scheme can be prosecuted, even if the
public official is not the direct recipient of the benefit.
Knowledge and Intent
The requisite intent for extortion under color of official right is knowledge
that the payment was made in return for official acts, as clarified in U.S. v.
Impastato, 543 F.Supp.2d 569 (E.D. La. 2008) and U.S. v. Partida, 385 F.3d
546 (5th Cir. 2004). The focus is on the official’s knowing misuse of their
position, not on their personal enrichment.
Victim’s Consent
Consent obtained through fear of economic loss, fear of official sanction, or
abuse of official power is not true consent for purposes of the statute. The
courts have recognized that the fear induced by a public official’s authority
can be sufficient to satisfy the statutory requirement, as seen in United
States v. Rashad (687 F.3d 637, 643 (5th Cir. 2012)) and U.S. v. Brown, 298
F.3d 392, 399 (5th Cir. 2002).

Subsequent Negative Treatment
It is important to note that U.S. v. Box, 50 F.3d 345 (5th Cir. 1995) was
disapproved by U.S. v. Mann, 493 F.3d 484 (5th Cir. 2007). However, the
core principle relevant here—that private individuals can be convicted of
aiding and abetting a public official’s extortion—remains supported by other
authorities, including United States v. Rosenthal (805 F.3d 523 (5th Cir.
2015)) and United States v. Rashad (687 F.3d 637 (5th Cir. 2012)). The
negative treatment of Box does not undermine the broader rule that the
benefit need not be personal to the official.
Exceptions and Caveats
While the law is clear that personal benefit to the official is not required, the
public official must be a knowing participant in the scheme. As explained in 
Reagan v. Warden FCI Oakdale (W.D. La. Dec 27, 2018), a private citizen can
only be guilty of conspiracy to commit extortion under color of official right
if the extortion was intended to result in the receipt of money by a public
official, and the public official was a knowing participant in the scheme.
Additionally, the property must be obtained “from another,” and the misuse
of official power must be the means by which the property is obtained. The
courts have not required that the victim be aware of the official’s position,
only that they believe the individual has the power to carry out the threat or
promise, as clarified in U.S. v. Rubio, 321 F.3d 517 (5th Cir. 2003).
Conclusion
In summary, under the Hobbs Act and as interpreted by the Fifth Circuit and
related authorities, extortion under color of official right does not require
that the public official personally benefit from the extortionate act. The
offense is complete when a public official knowingly misuses their official
position to obtain property not due, regardless of who ultimately receives
the benefit. The law is clear that the wrongful use of official power is the
critical element, and the benefit may flow to a third party without negating
the offense. Private individuals who aid, abet, or conspire with public
officials in such schemes are also liable. The focus remains on the misuse of
official authority and the loss to the victim, not on the enrichment of the
official.

U.S.C. § 1951(b)(2). This section applies both to the extortionate acts of
public officials, and to private individuals who aid and abet those acts.
United States v. Rashad, 687 F.3d 637, 643 (5th Cir.2012). The indictment
charged Rosenthal with aiding-and-abetting Limas in committing extortion
under color of official right, by 'paying ... money and other compensation in
return for favorable judicial acts of discretion ... that benefitted [Rosenthal]'.
Summary
The passage from United States v. Rosenthal clarifies that the Hobbs Act
covers extortion committed by public officials under color of official right. It
also extends to private individuals who aid and abet such acts. The case
specifically mentions that Rosenthal was charged with aiding and abetting a
judge (Limas) in committing extortion by providing money for favorable
judicial acts. This indicates that the benefit to a third party (Rosenthal) from
the judge's extortionate acts is sufficient to satisfy the requirements of
extortion under the Hobbs Act.
United States v. Rashad, 687 F.3d 637 (5th Cir. 2012)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
Usually, only public officials are charged with extorting property under color
of official right. Tomblin, 46 F.3d at 1382. In Tomblin, the defendant won a
new trial because he practiced extortion as a private individual claiming to
exert influence over public officials, but he received the payments for
himself alone. Tomblin, 46 F.3d at 1382–83. Rashad contends that because
he, too, is a private citizen, he cannot be guilty of extortion “under color of
official right.” This argument misapprehends Tomblin and our circuit
precedent. Tomblin was charged with conspiracy to extort under color of
official right, not with the underlying substantive offense. Rashad's
participation in an illegal agreement with public officials who were
practicing extortion suffices to establish conspiratorial guilt. In various
cases, courts have applied the “under color of official right” theory to
private individuals who conspired with corrupt public officials, masqueraded
as public officials, aided or abetted extortion by public officials, or were
speaking for a public official.
Summary
The benefit does not need to be personal to the public official; rather, the
involvement in the extortion scheme is sufficient for liability. This suggests
that if a judge (a public official) commits extortion and someone else
benefits, the extortion charge can still be satisfied as long as the extortion
was conducted under the color of official right.

U.S. v. Rubio, 321 F.3d 517 (5th Cir. 2003)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
Under the Hobbs Act, one of the elements of extortion is that property be
obtained from another 'under the color of official right.' In order to prove
this element, the government must prove that a public official obtained
payment to which he was not entitled. United States v. Stephens, 964 F.2d
424, 429 (5th Cir.1992). When a defendant holds an office, it is not
necessary that the person from whom the money was taken be aware of the
extortionist's official position as long as the victim believes that the
individual had the power to carry out the threat or promise made to the
victim. Id. Moreover, a person who holds himself out as a public official is
also acting 'under the color of official right' even though he actually holds no
official position.
Summary
The passage from U.S. v. Rubio clarifies that under the Hobbs Act, extortion
under color of official right involves a public official obtaining payment to
which they are not entitled. It is not necessary for the victim to be aware of
the official's position, as long as they believe the individual has the power to
carry out the threat or promise. This implies that the focus is on the misuse
of the official position to obtain something of value, rather than who benefits
from the extortion. Therefore, if a judge commits extortion and someone else
benefits, the act of extortion itself is still satisfied as long as the judge
misused their official position to obtain something of value.
U.S. v. Wright, 797 F.2d 245 (5th Cir. 1986)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
A conviction under the Hobbs Act may be sustained by a finding that a
public official has taken a fee, unlawfully, under color of his public office, in
return for performance or nonperformance of an official act. There is no
requirement that threat, force, or duress be proved when the defendant is a
public officer. United States v. Williams, 621 F.2d 123, 124 (5th Cir.1980),
cert. denied, 450 U.S. 919, 101 S.Ct. 1366, 67 L.Ed.2d 346 (1981). 'The

Summary
The passage from U.S. v. Wright clarifies that under the Hobbs Act, a public
official can be convicted of extortion if they unlawfully take a fee under the
color of their public office in exchange for performing or not performing an

official act. The coercive element is inherent in the public office itself, and
there is no need to prove threat, force, or duress. This implies that the
benefit to another party, rather than the public official, does not negate the
extortion charge, as the wrongful use of official power is the key element.
U.S. v. Pattan, 931 F.2d 1035 (5th Cir. 1991)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
Extortion 'under color of official right' is the wrongful taking by a public
officer of money or property not due to him or his office, whether or not the
taking was accomplished by force, threats, or use of fear. In other words, the
wrongful use of otherwise valid official power may convert dutiful action into
extortion. It is the nature of the office itself which provides the necessary
inducement taking the place of fear, duress, or threat when a defendant
knowingly takes advantage of his office in relation to the payor.
Summary
The passage from U.S. v. Pattan clarifies that extortion under color of official
right involves the wrongful use of official power by a public officer to obtain
money or property not due to them or their office. The coercive element is
supplied by the nature of the office itself, rather than any personal gain or
use of force, threats, or fear. This implies that the benefit to another party,
rather than the public official themselves, does not negate the occurrence of
extortion. The focus is on the misuse of the official position to obtain
property, regardless of who ultimately benefits.
United States v. Marchan, 32 F.Supp.3d 753 (S.D. Tex. 2013)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of Texas
Extract
Defendant has raised the issue of whether a person can aid and abet a
Hobbs Act extortion while at the same time be the 'victim' of the extortion
plot. The Hobbs Act criminalizes 'obstruct[ing], delay[ing], or affect[ing]
commerce ... by robbery or extortion or attempt[ing] or conspir[ing] so to
do....' 18 U.S.C. § 1951. 'Extortion' is defined in the statute as 'the obtaining
of property from another, with his consent, induced by wrongful use of
actual or threatened force, violence, or fear, or under color of official right.'
Id. Counts 3, 4 and 5 of Defendant's Indictment all charge Defendant with
aiding and abetting Hobbs Act extortion under color of official right.

Summary
The Hobbs Act covers extortion under color of official right, which includes
obtaining property through misuse of official power. It also suggests that a
private person can be held accountable for aiding and abetting such
extortion. This implies that if a judge, as a public official, commits extortion
and someone else benefits from it, the act can still satisfy the requirements
of extortion under the Hobbs Act, as the wrongful use of official power is the
key element.
U.S. v. Dozier, 672 F.2d 531 (5th Cir. 1982)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
The Hobbs Act prohibits the obstruction of commerce by extortion, which it
defines as 'the obtaining of property from another, with his consent, induced
by wrongful use or actual or threatened force, violence, or fear, or under
color of official right.' 18 U.S.C. § 1951(b)(2) (emphasis supplied). Only last
year we joined eight other circuits in holding 'that Hobbs Act violations
based on extortion by a public official need not include proof of threat, fear,
or duress.' United States v. Williams, 621 F.2d 123, 124 (5th Cir. 1980), cert.
denied, 450 U.S. 919, 101 S.Ct. 1366, 67 L.Ed.2d 346 (1981). ... Extortion
under the color of official right is the wrongful taking by a public officer of
money or property not due him or his office, whether or not the taking was
accomplished by force, threats, or use of fear. In other words, the wrongful
use of otherwise valid official power may convert dutiful actions into
extortion.
Summary
The passage from "U.S. v. Dozier" clarifies that under the Hobbs Act,
extortion by a public official does not require proof of threat, fear, or duress.
The wrongful use of official power itself can constitute extortion. This
implies that if a judge, as a public official, uses their official position
wrongfully to obtain property not due to them or their office, it can be
considered extortion under the Hobbs Act. The benefit to another party does
not negate the extortion if the wrongful use of power is present.

Summary
The passage from U.S. v. Stephens clarifies that extortion under color of
official right involves a public officer wrongfully taking money or property
not due to them or their office. The passage emphasizes that there is no
need to prove threat, force, or duress when the defendant is a public officer.
The key requirement is that the public official obtained a payment to which
they were not entitled, knowing it was made in return for official acts. This
implies that the benefit to the public official is not a necessary element;
rather, the wrongful use of their position to obtain something of value is
sufficient. Therefore, if a judge commits extortion and someone else benefits
from it, it can still satisfy the requirements for extortion under color of
official right, as the focus is on the misuse of official power.
U.S. v. Partida, 385 F.3d 546 (5th Cir. 2004)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
Although a public official commits Hobbs Act extortion if he obtains a
payment to which he is not entitled, 'knowing that the payment was made in
return for official acts,' Evans, 504 U.S. at 268, 112 S.Ct. 1881, more than
one method exists by which a court may articulate that knowledge element.
In Justice Kennedy's concurrence in Evans, he opined that jury instructions
requiring a defendant's 'wrongful use of otherwise valid official power'
'made clear' the knowledge element. Id. at 277, 112 S.Ct. 1881 (Kennedy, J.,
concurring).
Summary
The passage from U.S. v. Partida clarifies that a public official commits
extortion under the Hobbs Act if they obtain a payment knowing it was made
in return for official acts. The court emphasizes that the wrongful use of
official power is key to establishing the knowledge element required for
extortion. This suggests that the focus is on the misuse of official power to
obtain payments, rather than on who benefits from the extortion. Therefore,

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
if a judge misuses their official position to obtain payments, it satisfies the
extortion requirement, regardless of who ultimately benefits.
U.S. v. Williams, 621 F.2d 123 (5th Cir. 1980)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
The language, 'under color of official right,' is consonant with the common
law definition of extortion, which could be committed only by a public
official taking a fee under color of his office, with no proof of threat, force or
duress required... The coercive element is supplied by the existence of the
public office itself... It cannot be gainsaid that the statute on its face
encompasses bribery of a public official, and that 'under color of official
right' has a 'meaning, as a legal term of art, (that) is well-defined.'... 'It is the
wrongful use of an otherwise valid power that converts dutiful action into
extortion. If the purpose and effect are to intimidate others, forcing them to
pay, the action constitutes extortion.'
Summary
The passage explains that extortion under color of official right does not
require proof of threat, force, or duress when committed by a public official.
The coercive element is inherent in the public office itself. The wrongful use
of official power, even if the action is otherwise lawful, can constitute
extortion if it is used to intimidate others into paying. The statute
encompasses bribery of a public official, and the term "under color of official
right" is well-defined as a legal term of art. Therefore, if a judge uses their
official position to commit extortion, the coercive element is satisfied by the
nature of their office, regardless of who benefits from the extortion.
U.S. v. Tomblin, 46 F.3d 1369 (5th Cir. 1995)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
Private persons have been convicted of extortion under color of official right,
but these cases have been limited to ones in which a person masqueraded as
a public official, was in the process of becoming a public official, or aided
and abetted a public official's receipt of money to which he was not entitled.
All these cases involved a public official in some past, present, or future
capacity receiving money.

Summary
Extortion under color of official right typically involves a public official
receiving money or property to which they are not entitled. The passage also
notes that private individuals can be convicted if they aid and abet a public
official's receipt of such money. This suggests that the involvement of a
public official in receiving the benefit is a key element. Therefore, if a judge
(a public official) commits extortion and someone else benefits from it, it
could satisfy the requirements for extortion under color of official right, as
long as the judge's official position was used to obtain the benefit.
U.S. v. Bright, 630 F.2d 804 (5th Cir. 1980)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
From on or about January 1976 to on or about June 1977, in the Northern
District of Mississippi, HARVEY HAMILTON, aided and abetted by
HOUSTON MORRIS, JOHN HARTER and JOHN THOMAS 'BILL' CHANEY,
did affect and attempt to affect commerce and the movement of articles in
commerce by extortion, that is by knowingly and willfully obtaining the
property of other persons with their consent induced by fear and under color
of official right by causing owners and operators of honky-tonks in DeSoto
County to make weekly payoffs to HARVEY HAMILTON, Sheriff to DeSoto
County, in return for freedom from interference by the Sheriff's Office with
gambling, sale of alcoholic beverages and other activities carried on at the
honky-tonks; in violation of Sections 2 and 1951 of Title 18 of the United
States Code.
Summary
The extortion was committed by obtaining property with consent induced by
fear and under color of official right. This aligns with the legal principle that
extortion under color of official right does not require personal benefit to the
official; it is sufficient that the official's position was used to obtain property
wrongfully. Therefore, if a judge commits extortion and someone else
benefits from it, it would still satisfy the requirements for extortion under
color of official right, as the wrongful use of the official position is the key
element.
United States v. Hyde, 448 F.2d 815 (5th Cir. 1971)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit

=== PAGE 14 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
The language of the statute makes clear that the actions of officials may
constitute extortion: (2) The term 'extortion' means the obtaining of property
from another, with his consent, induced by wrongful use of actual or
threatened force, violence, or fear, or under color of official right. 18 U.S.C. §
1951(b) (2). The language is consistent with an interpretation that the
wrongful use of an official right may be a basis for extortion.
Summary
The passage from United States v. Hyde clarifies that extortion under color
of official right involves the wrongful use of an official position to obtain
property. The statute does not require that the official personally benefit
from the extortion; rather, it focuses on the misuse of official power to
induce consent through fear or coercion. This implies that if a judge uses
their official position to extort, and someone else benefits from it, the act
can still satisfy the definition of extortion under the statute, as the key
element is the misuse of official power, not who benefits.
U.S. v. Box, 50 F.3d 345 (5th Cir. 1995)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
In a related argument, Box contends that he cannot be guilty of extortion
'under color of official right,' because he was a bail bondsman, not a public
official. However, we previously have acknowledged that private persons
may be convicted of aiding and abetting a public official's extortion. United
States v. Tomblin, 46 F.3d 1369, 1382 & n. 26 (5th Cir.1995) (citing United
States v. Margiotta, 688 F.2d 108, 131 (2d Cir.1982), cert. denied, 461 U.S.
913, 103 S.Ct. 1891, 77 L.Ed.2d 282 (1983)); see also Evans, 504 U.S. at
263-64 & n. 13, 112 S.Ct. at 1887 & n. 13 (noting that several states had
defined extortion broadly enough to include the conduct of a private
individual).
Summary
Private individuals can be convicted of aiding and abetting a public official's
extortion. This suggests that the benefit to a third party, even if not a public
official, can be relevant in establishing extortion under color of official right.
The focus is on the misuse of official power, and the involvement of private
individuals does not negate the extortion charge if they aid or abet the
public official.
Reagan v. Warden FCI Oakdale, CIVIL ACTION NO. 2:17-cv-0807 SECTION
P (W.D. La. Dec 27, 2018)

=== PAGE 15 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
U.S. District Court — Western District of Louisiana
Extract
The jury charges described extortion as containing the following elements,
which the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt: (1) that the
defendant obtained or attempted to obtain property from another, with that
person's consent; and (2) that the defendant did so by wrongful use of actual
or threatened force, violence, or fear, or that the defendant did so under
color of official right. ... The wrongful use of otherwise valid official power
may convert dutiful action into extortion. In other words, if a public official
accepts or demands property in return for promised performance or
nonperformance of an official act, the official is guilty of extortion. ... It
further noted that a private citizen could only be guilty of conspiracy to
commit extortion under color of official right if the extortion was intended to
result in the receipt of money by a public official, and a public official was a
knowing participant in the scheme.
Summary
Extortion under color of official right involves a public official wrongfully
obtaining property by using their official position. It also highlights that a
private citizen can be guilty of conspiracy to commit such extortion if the
scheme involves a public official knowingly participating and benefiting from
it. This implies that if a judge, as a public official, commits extortion and
someone else benefits from it, it could satisfy the elements of extortion
under color of official right, provided the judge was a knowing participant in
the scheme.

U.S. District Court — Eastern District of Louisiana
Extract
In contrast, where extortion is committed under color of official right, case
law suggests that the requisite intent is simply knowledge, namely that the
defendant obtained a payment to which he is not entitled 'knowing that the
payment was made in return for official acts.' United States v. Partida, 385 F.
3d 546, 559 (5th Cir.2004), quoting Evans v. United States, 504 U.S. 255,
268, 112 S.Ct. 1881, 1889, 119 L.Ed.2d 57 (1992); United States v. Price,
617 F.2d 455, 458 (7th Cir.1980) (upholding conviction where defendant
'accepted money wrongfully and with the knowledge that it was paid to
induce him to perform or to fail to perform official functions').
Summary
For extortion under color of official right, the requisite intent is simply
knowledge that the payment was made in return for official acts. This

=== PAGE 16 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
suggests that the focus is on the misuse of official power to obtain
something of value, regardless of who ultimately benefits. Therefore, if a
judge commits extortion and someone else benefits, the act of extortion is
still satisfied as long as the judge knowingly used their official position to
obtain the payment.
U.S. v. Carlock, 806 F.2d 535 (5th Cir. 1986)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
We and the Third Circuit have given 'similar' readings to the Hobbs Act. See
United States v. Hyde, 448 F.2d 815 (5th Cir.1971); United States v.
Provenzano, 334 F.2d 678, 686 (3d Cir.1964). The Hobbs Act defines
extortion as 'the obtaining of property from another.' 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1951(b)
(2). Yet, in Hyde, we held that '[o]ne need receive no personal benefit to be
guilty of extortion; the gravamen of the offense is loss to the victim.' Id. at
843.
Summary
The passage from "U.S. v. Carlock" clarifies that under the Hobbs Act,
extortion does not require the perpetrator to receive a personal benefit. The
focus is on the loss to the victim. This interpretation aligns with the broader
understanding of extortion under color of official right, where the misuse of
official power to obtain property is key, regardless of who benefits.
Therefore, if a judge commits extortion and someone else benefits, it still
satisfies the extortion requirement as long as there is a loss to the victim.

The Hobbs Act defines extortion as: '[T]he obtaining of property from

force, violence, or fear, or under color of official right.' 18 U.S.C.
[section]1951 (b) (2) (2006).

The passage provides the federal definition of extortion under the Hobbs
Act, which includes obtaining property under color of official right. This
definition does not require the extortion to benefit the public official

of official power. Therefore, if a judge uses their official position to obtain
property for someone else, it would still satisfy the definition of extortion
under the Hobbs Act.

The First Circuit ultimately determined that the 'obtaining of property'
element of the extortion provision may be satisfied even when no personal
benefit is incurred. ... its transfer to another of his choosing, irrespective of
whether he receives a personal benefit as a result.
Summary
Under the Hobbs Act, the "obtaining of property" element can be satisfied
even if the public official does not personally benefit from the extortion. This
suggests that the act of extortion is complete if the property is transferred
to another party, regardless of whether the public official receives a
personal benefit. This interpretation aligns with the broader understanding
of extortion under color of official right, where the misuse of official power
to obtain property is key, not the personal gain of the official.

Extract
United States v. Provenzano, 334 F.2d 678, 686 (3d Cir. 1964) (holding direct
receipt of property or benefits unnecessary to constitute extortion); United
States v. Vigil, 523 F.3d 1258, 1264 (10th Cir. 2008) (holding directed
transfer of property to third party constitutes 'obtaining property').
Summary
Under the Hobbs Act, the direct receipt of property or benefits by the
extortionist is not necessary to constitute extortion. It is sufficient if the
property is directed to a third party. This aligns with the understanding that

extortion under color of official right does not require personal benefit to the
public official, as the coercive element is supplied by the misuse of official
power.
Matter of [Name redacted]
Decisions of the Administrative Appeals Office AAO
Extract
In the alternative, the Petitioner asserts that he previously provided an
analysis regarding how official misconduct in Indiana and extortion are
substantially similar and, contrary to our prior determination, the definition
of extortion provided in 18 U.S.C. § 1951 does not require as a necessary
element, a threat, demand, or affirmative act of inducement by a public
official. In support of his assertions, the Petitioner refers to the decisions in
Evans v. U.S., 504 U.S. 255 (holding an '[a]ffirmative act of inducement by a
public official, such as a demand, is not an element of the offense of
extortion 'under color of official right' prohibited by the Hobbs Act [18
U.S.C. § 1951]')... Regarding the element of threat, we agree with the
Petitioner that the federal definition of extortion does not require a threat or
other affirmative act of inducement when an individual, like a police officer,
is acting 'under color of official right'; the coercive element is satisfied by
the fact that the individual is a police officer.
Summary
Under the Hobbs Act, extortion under color of official right does not require
a threat or affirmative act of inducement by a public official. The coercive
element is satisfied by the official's position itself. This suggests that if a
judge, as a public official, commits extortion, the mere misuse of their
official position could satisfy the requirements for extortion, even if someone
else benefits from it. The passage supports the idea that the benefit does not
need to be personal to the official, aligning with the broader interpretation
of extortion under color of official right.
MATTER OF D-M-C-B-
Decisions of the Administrative Appeals Office AAO
Extract
The Petitioner next asserts that '[t]he nature and elements of 18 U.S.C. § 912
ਙ̶ obtaining money or a thing of value by pretending to be a federal official ̶
track very closely to the nature and elements of 18 U.S.C. § 1951(b) ̶
obtaining property under color of official right.' She claims that 'section
1951(b) does not require that force, violence, or fear is used when the
alternative element of 'under color of official right' is present.' The Petitioner

=== PAGE 19 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
is correct that the definition of extortion contained in 18 U.S.C. § 1951(b)
contains as alternatives 'the obtaining of property. .. by. .. force, violence, or
fear, or under color of official right.' However, as alluded to above, extortion
under color of official right contemplates the obtaining of property by a
public official, not by a private individual.
Summary
Extortion under color of official right involves a public official obtaining
property, and it does not require the use of force, violence, or fear when the
element of "under color of official right" is present. This aligns with the
understanding that the wrongful use of official power itself can constitute
extortion. The passage does not directly address whether someone else
benefiting from the extortion satisfies the requirement, but it emphasizes
the role of the public official in obtaining property.
