Question
Roderick Marx
Answer
Attorney Performance Assessment: Roderick Marx
This assessment of Roderick Marx is based on the detailed analysis of 50 cases matching the specified search criteria, supplemented by aggregate data. It's
important to note that while the aggregate data encompasses a larger dataset (2627 cases), the in-depth analysis is limited to this smaller subset and may not
fully represent the breadth of Mr. Marx's practice.
Typical Role & Case Types:
Roderick Marx consistently represents petitioners in family law cases, specifically divorce proceedings. The analyzed cases exclusively involve divorce, both with
and without children. The aggregate data supports this specialization, with no indication of work outside of family law.
Motion Practice Effectiveness:
Mr. Marx demonstrates proficiency in initiating cases and managing the early procedural stages. He consistently files original petitions, motions for withdrawal of
counsel (when applicable), and effectively utilizes waivers of service to expedite proceedings (e.g., DF-15-03298 Habip Kargin v. Patricia Godina; 92571-86 In the
Matter of the Marriage of Regina Clarke and Samuel Clarke, III). However, a recurring negative indicator is the high number of dismissals for want of prosecution
(e.g., DF-14-18800 Antonio Rocha, Jr. v. Sarah Rocha; DF-15-00416 Dale Switzer v. Brian Switzer). This suggests a potential weakness in maintaining
momentum and actively pursuing cases beyond the initial filings, a point opposing counsel could leverage.
Average Case Duration & Outcomes:
The average duration of the analyzed cases is approximately six months, ranging from two months (e.g., 15-02199-431 In the Matter of the Marriage of Thomas
L. Bailey and Wendy L. Bailey) to over two years (DF-14-22294 Suzanne Lee v. Jason Lee). While the shorter durations for uncontested divorces align with
industry averages, the longer durations coupled with dismissals for want of prosecution suggest inefficiency in certain cases. Based on the analyzed cases, a
significant portion of Mr. Marx's cases end in dismissal for want of prosecution, indicating a lower success rate than typical family law practitioners. However,
when cases proceed to judgment, he appears to achieve favorable outcomes for his clients, often through agreed orders or prove-up hearings (e.g., DF-15-03296
Andres Aguilar v. Anel Verber; DF-15-05381 Vianey Garcia v. Armando Garcia). It is crucial to consider the limitations of the sample size when interpreting this
data. The aggregate data suggests a much larger caseload, and the dismissals may represent a smaller percentage of his overall outcomes.
Case Resolution:
The majority of analyzed cases end in one of two ways: dismissal for want of prosecution or an agreed final decree/judgment following a prove-up hearing. This
suggests a tendency towards negotiated settlements rather than contested trials. This preference for settlement could be a valuable point for opposing counsel to
consider during negotiations.
Significant Cases & Clients:
No single case stands out as particularly significant or noteworthy in terms of legal precedent or high monetary value. The analyzed cases primarily involve
routine divorce proceedings with relatively modest financial implications. The aggregate data reveals frequent interaction with the State of Texas and the Attorney
General's office, likely related to child support enforcement, but does not point to any major private clients.
Expert Witness Usage:
There is no evidence of Roderick Marx utilizing expert witnesses in the analyzed cases. This aligns with the relatively straightforward nature of the divorce
proceedings observed.
Additional Insights:
The high volume of cases handled by Mr. Marx, as indicated by the aggregate data, suggests a high-volume practice model. This may contribute to the observed
pattern of dismissals for want of prosecution, as resource allocation across a large caseload can be challenging. Opposing counsel should be aware of this
potential vulnerability and prepared to capitalize on any delays or lack of responsiveness. The aggregate data also reveals that Mr. Marx appears before certain
judges (David Lopez, Dennise Garcia, James Martin) far more frequently than others. Understanding these judicial preferences and tendencies could be
advantageous in litigation.
Strategic Approach for Opposing Counsel:
When facing Mr. Marx, opposing counsel should be prepared for an initial flurry of activity followed by potential periods of inactivity. Diligence in monitoring
deadlines and proactively moving the case forward is crucial. Leveraging the potential for delays or lack of responsiveness could be a strategic advantage. A
willingness to negotiate and settle, given Mr. Marx's apparent preference for avoiding trial, could also be a fruitful approach. Finally, familiarity with the judges he
frequently appears before could provide valuable insights into potential judicial biases or procedural preferences.

case status is marked as "Inactive: Disposed," confirming that no further action is pending.
Background: The cause of action in this case is divorce, initiated by Lena M. Crawford against Leonard E. Smith, as evidenced by the Original Petition for
Divorce filed on March 10, 2015. The factual background indicates that Crawford sought a divorce by default due to the inability to serve Smith personally, leading
to a citation by posting after efforts to locate him failed. The court ultimately granted the divorce on June 11, 2015, finalizing the matter with a decree.
Motion practice: The docket entries reveal that Roderick Marx, representing Lena M. Crawford, engaged in several key motions, primarily focused on obtaining a
divorce from Leonard E. Smith. The motion practice included filing an Original Petition for Divorce, followed by a Request for Issuance of Citation, and an Affidavit

2015. The court's orders included sending notices to the parties and filing necessary documents with the Bureau of Vital Statistics, effectively closing the matter.

not having an address for direct service. The proceedings were concluded with a final decree and no contested issues noted, demonstrating a low level of
complexity.
