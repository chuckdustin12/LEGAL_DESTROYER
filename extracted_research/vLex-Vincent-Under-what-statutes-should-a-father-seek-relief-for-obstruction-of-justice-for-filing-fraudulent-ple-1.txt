Question
Under what statutes should a father seek relief for obstruction of justice for
filing fraudulent pleadings and documents in a RICO suit against his spouse,
his spouse's grandmother, and his spouse's stepfather?
Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
A father seeking relief for obstruction of justice for filing fraudulent
pleadings and documents in a RICO suit against family members should
primarily rely on 18 U.S.C. § 1503 (obstruction of justice), 18 U.S.C. § 1512
(tampering with documents), and 18 U.S.C. § 1519 (falsification of records),
which can serve as predicate acts for a civil RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. §
1964, potentially entitling him to treble damages and attorney's fees.
Summary
When confronting fraudulent pleadings and documents filed in a RICO
lawsuit against family members, a father can pursue relief through several
federal statutes addressing obstruction of justice. The primary statutes
include 18 U.S.C. § 1503 (obstruction of justice), 18 U.S.C. § 1512 (tampering
with witnesses, victims, or informants), and 18 U.S.C. § 1519 (falsification of
records in federal investigations). These statutes can serve as predicate acts
for a civil RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962, which prohibits conducting an
enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity, with civil
remedies available under 18 U.S.C. § 1964.
To establish a viable claim, the father must demonstrate that the defendants
engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity by committing at least two
predicate acts involving the filing of fraudulent documents, which caused
injury to his business or property. If successful, he could recover treble
damages, costs, and attorney's fees under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c). Additionally,
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 may provide an alternative avenue for
sanctions against parties filing fraudulent pleadings, though this would not
offer the same substantial remedies as a RICO claim.
Background and Relevant Law
Legislation
The RICO Statutory Framework
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) provides
both criminal penalties and civil remedies for certain prohibited activities.
The civil RICO provisions are particularly relevant to a father seeking relief

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
for obstruction of justice through fraudulent pleadings in a lawsuit against
family members.
Under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), it is unlawful for "any person employed by or
associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect,
interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or
indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of
racketeering activity." 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) (2025). Additionally, 18 U.S.C. §
1962(d) prohibits conspiracy to violate the other provisions of § 1962. 18
U.S.C. § 1962(d) (2025).
The civil remedy provision of RICO, codified at 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c), states:
"Any person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of
section 1962 of this chapter may sue therefor in any appropriate United
States district court and shall recover threefold the damages he sustains and
the cost of the suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee..." 18 U.S.C. § 1964
(2025). This provision creates a powerful incentive for victims of
racketeering activity to bring civil suits by allowing for treble damages and
attorney's fees.
Predicate Acts for RICO Claims
For a successful RICO claim, the plaintiff must demonstrate a "pattern of
racketeering activity," which requires at least two acts of "racketeering
activity" as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1). Importantly, this definition
includes several forms of obstruction of justice, which are particularly
relevant to the filing of fraudulent pleadings and documents:
18 U.S.C. § 1503 - Obstruction of Justice: This statute makes it
unlawful to "corruptly, or by threats or force, or by any threatening
letter or communication, influence[], obstruct[], or impede[], or
endeavor[] to influence, obstruct, or impede, the due administration of
justice." 18 U.S.C. § 1503 (2025). Filing fraudulent pleadings and
documents in a legal proceeding could constitute an attempt to
corruptly obstruct or impede the due administration of justice.
18 U.S.C. § 1512 - Tampering With a Witness, Victim, Or an
Informant: This statute prohibits corrupting, altering, destroying, or
concealing documents with the intent to impair their integrity or
availability for use in an official proceeding. Specifically, it states:
"Whoever corruptly alters, destroys, mutilates, or conceals a record,
document, or other object, or attempts to do so, with the intent to
impair the object's integrity or availability for use in an official
proceeding; or otherwise obstructs, influences, or impedes any official
proceeding, or attempts to do so, shall be fined under this title or
imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both." 18 U.S.C. § 1512 (2025).
18 U.S.C. § 1519 - Destruction, Alteration, Or Falsification of
Records: This statute addresses falsification of records with the intent
to obstruct justice. It provides: "Whoever knowingly alters, destroys,
mutilates, conceals, covers up, falsifies, or makes a false entry in any
record, document, or tangible object with the intent to impede,
1. 
2. 
3. 

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
obstruct, or influence the investigation or proper administration of any
matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the
United States or any case filed under title 11, or in relation to or
contemplation of any such matter or case, shall be fined under this title,
imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both." 18 U.S.C. § 1519 (2025).
The definition of "misleading conduct" under 18 U.S.C. § 1515 is also
relevant, as it includes "knowingly making a false statement" and "with
intent to mislead, knowingly submitting or inviting reliance on a writing or
recording that is false, forged, altered, or otherwise lacking in authenticity." 
18 U.S.C. § 1515 (2025).
Additional Relevant Statutes
While the following statutes are supplementary to the primary ones
discussed above, they may still be relevant to a comprehensive strategy:
18 U.S.C. § 1621 - Perjury: This statute prohibits willfully making
false statements under oath, which could apply if the fraudulent
pleadings and documents involved sworn statements. 18 U.S.C. § 1621
(2025).
18 U.S.C. § 1623 - False Declarations Before Grand Jury Or Court:
This statute specifically addresses false material declarations made
under oath in court proceedings. 18 U.S.C. § 1623 (2025).
18 U.S.C. § 1505 - Obstruction of Proceedings Before
Departments, Agencies, and Committees: This statute addresses
obstruction of proceedings before federal departments, agencies, and
committees. 18 U.S.C. § 1505 (2025).
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11: While not a statute, Rule 11
provides a mechanism for seeking sanctions against parties who file
pleadings, motions, or other papers for improper purposes. 28 U.S.C. r.
11 (2025).
Case Law
The case law provides important guidance on how courts interpret and apply
the RICO statutory framework in the context of obstruction of justice claims.
Elements of a Civil RICO Claim
Courts have consistently recognized that to establish a civil RICO claim, a
plaintiff must demonstrate: "(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a
pattern (4) of racketeering activity (5) causing injury to plaintiff's business
or property." Simms v. Schwab, CASE NO. 3:19-cv-5642 BHS (W.D. Wash.
Aug 09, 2019).
In Hemi Grp., LLC v. City of N.Y., 130 S.Ct. 983, 559 U.S. 1, 175 L. Ed. 2d
943 (2010), the Supreme Court explained that RICO "provides a private
cause of action for '[a]ny person injured in his business or property by
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
reason of a violation of section 1962 of this chapter'" and that section
1962(c) "makes it 'unlawful for any person employed by or associated with
any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate ...
commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of
such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.'"
Pattern of Racketeering Activity
A "pattern of racketeering activity" requires at least two predicate acts of
racketeering activity. Troyer v. Hershberger, CASE NO. 5:11cv2536 (N.D.
Ohio Feb 14, 2012). These predicate acts must be among those listed in 18
U.S.C. § 1961(1), which includes obstruction of justice.
In Royal Food Products, Inc. v. Buckeye Union Ins. Co., 985 F.2d 561 (6th
Cir. 1993), the court identified several statutes that have "possible
relevance" to establishing racketeering activity: "(1) 18 U.S.C. § 1503
(obstruction of justice); (2) 18 U.S.C. § 1512 (tampering with a witness,
victim, or an informant); (3) 18 U.S.C. § 1513 (retaliating against a witness,
victim, or an informant); and (4) 18 U.S.C. § 1957 (engaging in monetary
transactions and property derived from specified unlawful activity)."
Similarly, in Smith v. Aldridge, No. 3:17-cv-01485-HZ (D. Or. Mar 22, 2018),
the court noted that the "indictable federal acts are wide-ranging and
include, for purposes of this opinion, obstruction of justice under 18 U.S.C.
§§ 1503 and 1512."
Obstruction of Justice as a Predicate Act
The case law confirms that obstruction of justice can serve as a predicate
act for a RICO claim. In Gadberry v. Kuenzel (U.S. District Court — Eastern
District of Missouri, 2024-09-16), the court discussed a RICO claim where
the plaintiff alleged predicate acts including "perjury and related false
statements under 18 USC §§ 1621 and 1623 ... tampering pursuant to 18
USC §§ 1512(a)(1)(A), 1512(b)(2)(B), and 1512(c)(1)(2); obstruction pursuant
to 18 USC § 1505; ... offenses against the administration of justice under §
575.500 (false affidavit) and under § 575.060 (false declaration)."
In United States v. Fineman, 434 F.Supp. 189 (E.D. Pa. 1977), the court
noted that obstruction of a criminal investigation in violation of 18 U.S.C. §
1510 can be charged alongside RICO violations based on "alleged attempts
to hinder the F.B.I. Investigation."
Civil Remedies Under RICO
The civil remedies provided by RICO are substantial. In Saine v. AIA, INC.,
582 F.Supp. 1299 (D. Colo. 1984), the court explained that the civil remedies
section of RICO "provides for a private right of action for treble damages:
Any person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of
section 1962 of this chapter may sue therefor in any appropriate United
States District Court and shall recover threefold the damages he sustains
and the cost of the suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee."

Analysis
Application of RICO's Civil Remedy Provisions
For a father seeking relief for obstruction of justice through the filing of
fraudulent pleadings and documents in a RICO suit against family members,
the most direct path would be to assert a civil RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. §
1964(c), based on violations of § 1962(c) or (d).
To succeed, he would need to demonstrate:
The existence of an enterprise: The enterprise could be alleged to
consist of his spouse, the spouse's grandmother, and the spouse's
stepfather, who are associated in fact for the purpose of obstructing
justice in the legal proceedings.
A pattern of racketeering activity: This would require showing at
least two acts of racketeering activity, which could include multiple
instances of filing fraudulent pleadings or documents. These acts would
need to be related and demonstrate continuity, either through repeated
acts over a substantial period or the threat of continued criminal
activity.
Predicate acts of obstruction of justice: The most relevant
predicate acts would likely be violations of:
a. 18 U.S.C. § 1503 (obstruction of justice): The father would need to
show that the defendants "corruptly... endeavor[ed] to influence,
obstruct, or impede, the due administration of justice" by filing
fraudulent pleadings and documents. The term "corruptly" implies a
specific intent to obstruct justice, which could be inferred from the
deliberate filing of documents known to be false.
b. 18 U.S.C. § 1512 (tampering with documents): If the defendants
altered or falsified documents for use in the RICO suit, this could
constitute a violation of § 1512, specifically subsection (c), which
prohibits corruptly altering, destroying, mutilating, or concealing
documents with the intent to impair their integrity or availability for
use in an official proceeding.
c. 18 U.S.C. § 1519 (falsification of records): This statute directly
addresses the falsification of documents with the intent to obstruct or
influence a federal case, which would encompass the filing of
fraudulent pleadings in a RICO suit.
Injury to business or property: The father would need to
demonstrate that he suffered an injury to his business or property as a
result of the racketeering activity. This could include financial losses,
such as increased legal fees, or damage to property interests that are
the subject of the litigation.

Specific Application of Obstruction of Justice Statutes
18 U.S.C. § 1503 - Obstruction of Justice
This statute is particularly applicable to situations where a party files
fraudulent pleadings and documents in a legal proceeding. The act of
submitting false information to a court with the intent to influence the
outcome of the case would likely constitute an endeavor to "corruptly...
influence, obstruct, or impede, the due administration of justice." 18 U.S.C. §
1503 (2025).
The statute's broad language covers a wide range of conduct aimed at
obstructing the judicial process. In the context of a RICO suit, the filing of
fraudulent pleadings could be seen as an attempt to derail or improperly
influence the legal proceedings, which is exactly what § 1503 prohibits.
18 U.S.C. § 1512 - Tampering With Documents
Section 1512 specifically addresses the alteration, destruction, or
concealment of documents for use in an official proceeding. Subsection (c)
(1) prohibits corruptly altering, destroying, mutilating, or concealing
documents with the intent to impair their integrity or availability for use in
an official proceeding, while subsection (c)(2) more broadly prohibits
otherwise obstructing, influencing, or impeding any official proceeding. 18
U.S.C. § 1512 (2025).
If the defendants created or submitted fraudulent documents, or altered
genuine documents for submission to the court, this would likely constitute a
violation of § 1512(c). The statute's focus on the integrity and availability of
documents makes it particularly relevant to cases involving fraudulent
pleadings.
18 U.S.C. § 1519 - Falsification of Records
Section 1519 addresses the falsification of documents with the intent to
obstruct or influence a federal case. It prohibits knowingly falsifying or
making a false entry in any document with the intent to impede, obstruct, or
influence the proper administration of any matter within the jurisdiction of
any department or agency of the United States or any case filed under title
11. 18 U.S.C. § 1519 (2025).
This statute is directly relevant to the filing of fraudulent pleadings and
documents in a federal case, which would include a RICO suit. The act of
knowingly creating or submitting false documents to the court would
constitute a violation of § 1519.
Proving a Pattern of Racketeering Activity
To establish a pattern of racketeering activity, the father would need to show
at least two predicate acts of obstruction of justice within a ten-year period.
These acts could include separate instances of filing fraudulent pleadings or

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
documents, each of which could constitute a violation of § 1503, § 1512, or §
1519.
The father would also need to demonstrate that these acts were related and
continuous, meaning they were part of a common scheme or plan and posed
a threat of continued criminal activity. This could be established by showing
that the defendants engaged in a pattern of submitting false information to
the court over time, with the ongoing intent to obstruct the judicial process.
As explained in Sundquist v. Hultquist, Cause No. 1:20-CV-275-HAB (N.D.
Ind. Sep 09, 2020), RICO is "concerned with eradicating organized, long-
term, habitual criminal activity." Therefore, isolated instances of filing
fraudulent documents might not be sufficient to establish a pattern of
racketeering activity. The father would need to show that the defendants'
conduct was part of a broader scheme to obstruct justice through ongoing
fraudulent activities.
Establishing Injury to Business or Property
To recover under RICO's civil remedy provision, the father must
demonstrate that he was "injured in his business or property by reason of a
violation of section 1962." 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c) (2025).
In Chevron Corp. v. Donziger, 974 F. Supp. 2d 362 (S.D. N.Y. 2014), the court
confirmed that RICO "explicitly provides a cause of action for '[a]ny person
injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of' the RICO
statute." This injury could include increased legal costs due to the need to
address fraudulent pleadings, damage to business relationships or
reputation resulting from false allegations, or financial losses associated
with the litigation.
It's important to note that emotional distress or other non-economic
damages are typically not recoverable under RICO, as the statute
specifically limits recovery to injuries to "business or property." Therefore,
the father would need to focus on concrete, quantifiable financial losses.
Alternative or Supplementary Avenues for Relief
While a civil RICO claim would provide the most substantial remedies,
including treble damages and attorney's fees, the father might also consider
other avenues for relief:
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11: Rule 11 allows for sanctions
against parties who file pleadings, motions, or other papers for
improper purposes, such as harassment or causing unnecessary delay. 
28 U.S.C. r. 11 (2025). These sanctions can include monetary penalties
and orders to pay attorney's fees. While not as substantial as RICO's
treble damages, Rule 11 sanctions might be easier to obtain if the full
elements of a RICO claim cannot be established.
18 U.S.C. § 1621 (Perjury) and § 1623 (False Declarations): If the
fraudulent pleadings and documents involved sworn statements under
1. 
2. 

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
oath, the father might seek relief under the federal perjury statutes. 18
U.S.C. § 1621 (2025) and 18 U.S.C. § 1623 (2025). While these statutes
primarily provide for criminal penalties rather than civil remedies, they
could still form the basis of predicate acts for a RICO claim.
18 U.S.C. § 1505: If the fraudulent pleadings were submitted in a
proceeding before a federal department, agency, or committee, § 1505
might apply. 18 U.S.C. § 1505 (2025). Like the other obstruction
statutes, a violation of § 1505 could serve as a predicate act for a RICO
claim.
Exceptions and Caveats
Heightened Pleading Requirements
One significant challenge in bringing a civil RICO claim is the heightened
pleading requirement. As noted in Simms v. Schwab, CASE NO. 3:19-cv-5642
BHS (W.D. Wash. Aug 09, 2019), when a RICO claim is based on predicate
acts involving fraud, the plaintiff "has a heightened burden to plead fraud
with particularity" under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b). This means
the father would need to "state the time, place, and specific content of the
false representations as well as the identities of the particular parties to the
misrepresentation."
This heightened pleading standard makes it more difficult to survive a
motion to dismiss, as general allegations of fraudulent conduct will not
suffice. The father would need to provide specific details about each
instance of fraudulent pleadings or documents, including when and how
they were submitted, their content, and the identities of those responsible
for their creation and submission.
Requirement of Injury to Business or Property
As discussed earlier, RICO's civil remedy provision requires an injury to
"business or property." This limitation can be significant in cases where the
primary harm is non-economic, such as emotional distress or harm to
personal relationships.
In Beck v Prupis, 529 U.S. 494, 120 S.Ct. 1608, 146 L.Ed.2d 561 (2000), the
Supreme Court further clarified that "injury caused by an overt act that is
not an act of racketeering or otherwise wrongful under RICO does not give
rise to a cause of action under §1964(c) for a violation of §1962(d)." This
means that the injury must be caused by a predicate act of racketeering, not
just any act in furtherance of the conspiracy.
Therefore, if the father's injuries are primarily emotional or relational, or if
they stem from acts that are not themselves predicate acts under RICO, he
might not be able to recover under § 1964(c).
3.

Complexity and Burden of RICO Claims
As noted in the secondary material "SCOTUS Clarified RICO's Domestic
Injury Requirement," civil RICO claims are "a longshot claim with heavy
burdens and discouraging odds." The article highlights the "exacting
requirements to establish a RICO enterprise, a pattern of racketeering
activity and the elements of specifically-enumerated predicate acts," as well
as the "heightened specificity requirements of Rule 9" for fraud-based
claims.
Given these challenges, the father should carefully consider whether he can
meet all the elements of a RICO claim before pursuing this avenue of relief.
If the fraudulent pleadings and documents were isolated incidents rather
than part of a pattern, or if the father's injuries are primarily non-economic,
other legal remedies might be more appropriate.
Conclusion
A father seeking relief for the filing of fraudulent pleadings and documents
in a RICO suit against his spouse, his spouse's grandmother, and his
spouse's stepfather has several statutory bases for his claims. The most
powerful remedy would be a civil RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c),
based on predicate acts of obstruction of justice under § 1503, tampering
with documents under § 1512, and/or falsification of records under § 1519.
To succeed on such a claim, the father would need to demonstrate:
The existence of an enterprise involving the defendants;
A pattern of racketeering activity through at least two related and
continuous acts of obstruction of justice;
Injury to his business or property as a result of the racketeering
activity; and
A causal connection between the predicate acts and his injuries.
If successful, the father could recover treble damages, costs, and attorney's
fees under § 1964(c), which would provide substantial relief for the harm
caused by the fraudulent pleadings and documents.
Alternatively, or in addition to a RICO claim, the father might seek relief
under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, which provides for sanctions
against parties who file pleadings for improper purposes. While not as
substantial as RICO's treble damages, Rule 11 sanctions might be easier to
obtain if the full elements of a RICO claim cannot be established.
Overall, the father has several statutory avenues for seeking relief for
obstruction of justice through fraudulent pleadings and documents, with a
civil RICO claim under § 1964(c) offering the most substantial potential
remedies. However, he should be aware of the heightened pleading
requirements and other challenges associated with RICO claims, and
carefully consider whether he can meet all the necessary elements before
pursuing this avenue of relief.

Legal Authorities
Beck v Prupis, 529 U.S. 494, 120 S.Ct. 1608, 146 L.Ed.2d 561 (2000)
U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
Held: Injury caused by an overt act that is not an act of racketeering or
otherwise wrongful under RICO does not give rise to a cause of action under
§1964(c) for a violation of §1962(d). To determine what it means to be
'injured _ by reason of' a 'conspir[acy],' this Court must look to the common
law of civil conspiracy. At common law, it was widely accepted that a plaintiff
could bring suit for civil conspiracy only if he had been injured by an act that
was itself tortious. When Congress adopted RICO, it incorporated this
principle. As at common law, a civil conspiracy plaintiff cannot bring suit
under RICO based on injury caused by any act in furtherance of a conspiracy
that might have caused the plaintiff injury.
Summary
The passage from Beck v Prupis clarifies that for a RICO claim under
§1964(c) related to a conspiracy under §1962(d), the injury must be caused
by an act that is independently wrongful under RICO, such as an act of
racketeering. Filing fraudulent pleadings and documents, if not considered
racketeering acts, may not independently support a RICO claim. The
passage emphasizes the need for the act causing injury to be tortious or
wrongful under RICO, aligning with common law principles of civil
conspiracy.

(2010)
U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
RICO provides a private cause of action for '[a]ny person injured in his
business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962 of this chapter.'
18 U.S.C. § 1964(c). Section 1962, in turn, contains RICO's criminal
provisions. Specifically, § 1962(c), which the City invokes here, makes it
'unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise
engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate ... commerce, to
conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such
enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.'
'[R]acketeering activity' is defined to include a number of so-called predicate
acts, including the two at issue in this case—mail and wire fraud. See §
1961(1).

Summary
Statutory framework for bringing a RICO claim, which includes
demonstrating injury to business or property due to a violation of section
1962. Section 1962(c) makes it unlawful to conduct an enterprise's affairs
through a pattern of racketeering activity, which includes predicate acts like
mail and wire fraud. This is relevant to the question as it provides the legal
basis for seeking relief under RICO for fraudulent activities, which could
include filing fraudulent pleadings and documents.
Sedima v. Imrex Company, Inc, 473 U.S. 479, 105 S.Ct. 3275, 87 L.Ed.2d 346
(1985)
U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), Pub.L.
91-452, Title IX, 84 Stat. 941, as amended, 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961-1968, provides
a private civil action to recover treble damages for injury 'by reason of a
violation of' its substantive provisions. 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c).
Summary
The passage from the Sedima v. Imrex Company, Inc case provides insight
into the use of the RICO statute for private civil actions. It specifically
mentions that 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c) allows for a private civil action to recover
treble damages for injuries caused by a violation of RICO's substantive
provisions. This is relevant to the question as it suggests that the father
could potentially seek relief under the RICO statute if he can demonstrate
that the fraudulent pleadings and documents constitute a violation of RICO's
provisions, such as mail or wire fraud.

U.S. Court of Appeals — Sixth Circuit
Extract
Defendants argue, however, that a 'pattern of racketeering activity' must be
shown to impose civil or criminal RICO liability upon its violators, and that
plaintiff has failed to allege facts which constitute a 'pattern' under the
RICO statutes. However, before the pattern requirement is considered,
'racketeering activity' must be presented. 18 U.S.C. § 1961. The district
court found, and we agree, that only four sections have possible relevance to
this case: (1) 18 U.S.C. § 1503 (obstruction of justice); (2) 18 U.S.C. § 1512
(tampering with a witness, victim, or an informant); (3) 18 U.S.C. § 1513
(retaliating against a witness, victim, or an informant); and (4) 18 U.S.C. §
1957 (engaging in monetary transactions and property derived from
specified unlawful activity).
Summary
The passage identifies specific statutes that are relevant to RICO claims,
particularly in the context of obstruction of justice and related activities. The
statutes mentioned include 18 U.S.C. § 1503 for obstruction of justice, which
directly pertains to the question of seeking relief for obstruction of justice.
The passage also highlights the necessity of demonstrating a "pattern of
racketeering activity" under RICO, which is crucial for establishing a claim.
The context of the passage is a legal case that discusses the requirements
for a RICO claim, making it relevant to the question.

2018)
U.S. District Court — Eastern District of Pennsylvania
Extract
West also vaguely contends that the defendants violated RICO. The federal
civil RICO statute provides that '[a]ny person injured in his business or
property by reason of a violation of section 1962 of this chapter[, which
prohibits racketeering activity,] may sue therefor in any appropriate United
States district court. .. .' 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c). Section 1962 provides, in
relevant part: (c) It shall be unlawful for any person employed by or
associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect,
interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or
indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of
racketeering activity. .. (d) it shall be unlawful for any person to conspire to
violate any of the provisions of subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section.
Summary
Elements required to state a civil RICO claim, which includes conduct of an
enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. This is relevant to the
question as it involves filing fraudulent pleadings and documents, which
could be considered racketeering activity if they meet the criteria outlined
in the statute.
Simms v. Schwab, CASE NO. 3:19-cv-5642 BHS (W.D. Wash. Aug 09, 2019)

predicate acts of racketeering activity. See 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5). ... Moreover,
although it is unclear the precise foundation for plaintiff's RICO claims, to
the extent that he alleges bank, wire, and/or mail fraud as predicate acts,
plaintiff has a heightened burden to plead fraud with particularity. See Fed.
R. Civ. P. 9(b). Plaintiff must state the time, place, and specific content of the
false representations as well as the identities of the particular parties to the
misrepresentation.
Summary
The RICO statute, specifically 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), provides a private right of
action for civil claims. The elements required to establish a civil RICO claim
include conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity
that causes injury to the plaintiff's business or property. The passage also
highlights the necessity of pleading fraud with particularity, as required by
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b), which is relevant when alleging
predicate acts such as bank, wire, or mail fraud.
Gadberry v. Kuenzel
U.S. District Court — Eastern District of Missouri
Extract
Plaintiff purports to allege a RICO claim against Defendants. Section 1962 of
the RICO Act makes it 'unlawful for any person employed by or associated
with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or
foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the
conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering
activity or collection of unlawful debt.' ... To demonstrate a RICO violation,
the plaintiff must show '(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a
pattern (4) of racketeering activity.' ... For predicate acts of racketeering,
Plaintiff alleges Defendants committed perjury and related false statements
under 18 USC §§ 1621 and 1623 ... tampering pursuant to 18 USC §§
1512(a)(1)(A), 1512(b)(2)(B), and 1512(c)(1)(2); obstruction pursuant to 18

U.S. District Court — Northern District of Ohio

=== PAGE 16 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
Plaintiff includes several claims under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act ('RICO'). RICO provides a private right of action for '[a]ny
person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of [18
U.S.C. § 1962].' In turn, Section 1962 states in relevant part: A 'pattern of
racketeering activity' requires at least two acts of 'racketeering activity'
which are set forth in Section 1961(1). 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5). To prove a
Defendant violated Section1962(c), it is necessary for the Plaintiff to prove
the Defendant committed two predicate offenses. To violate Section 1962(d),
a Defendant must conspire with another person who commits two acts of
racketeering activity.
Summary
To seek relief under RICO for fraudulent pleadings and documents, the
plaintiff must demonstrate a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1962. This requires
proving a pattern of racketeering activity, which involves at least two acts of
racketeering as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1). The passage also clarifies
that for a Section 1962(c) violation, two predicate offenses must be proven,
and for a Section 1962(d) violation, a conspiracy to commit two acts of
racketeering must be shown.

Representations to the Court; Sanctions
Extract
In General. If, after notice and a reasonable opportunity to respond, the
court determines that Rule 11(b) has been violated, the court may impose an
appropriate sanction on any attorney, law firm, or party that violated the
rule or is responsible for the violation... A motion for sanctions must be
made separately from any other motion and must describe the specific
conduct that allegedly violates Rule 11(b)... The sanction may include
nonmonetary directives; an order to pay a penalty into court; or, if imposed
on motion and warranted for effective deterrence, an order directing

Extract
RICO is not just a tool for government control over organized crime. It is
also a remedial statute for civil matters. (31) It 'authorize[s]... criminal or
civil remedies on conduct already criminal, when performed in a specified
fashion' as delineated by the statute. (32) Section 1962 provides civil
remedies for four types of conduct: (1) using income derived from a pattern
of racketeering activity (33) to acquire an interest in an enterprise; (2)
acquiring or maintaining an interest in an enterprise through a pattern of

pattern of racketeering activity; and (4) conspiring to commit any of these
offenses. (34) Today, Congress urges courts to construe RICO liberally from
the 'perspective of the victim, not the perpetrator.' (35) A private civil right
of action in [section] 1964 provides that '[a]ny person injured in his business
or property by reason of a violation of section 1962... may sue.' (36) Notably,
a successful plaintiff under [section] 1964 is entitled to treble damages and
the cost of the suit, including attorney fees. (37)

a simple statute. It pertains to conduct associated with an 'enterprise' and 'a
pattern racketeering activity.' An enterprise is an individual or legal entity,
or a union or group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal
entity, while a pattern of racketeering activity requires long-term, organized
conduct to violate state and federal laws. There are four types of activities
outlawed by RICO, and claims under Section 1962(c) are the most commonly
asserted: * Section 1962(a) prohibits a person from investing in an
enterprise any income derived from a pattern of racketeering activity; *
Section 1962(b) prohibits a person from using a pattern of racketeering
activity to acquire or maintain control over an enterprise; * Section 1962(c)
prohibits a person from conducting the affairs of an enterprise through a
pattern of racketeering; and * Section 1962(d) prohibits a person from
conspiring to violate Sections 1962(a), (b), or (c).

SCOTUS Clarified RICO's Domestic Injury Requirement, Did Not Create
New Civil Right Of Action For Enforcing Arbitration Awards
Extract
Post-Smagin, civil RICO remains a longshot claim with heavy burdens and
discouraging odds. Smagin neither changes the complex substantive
standards applicable to civil RICO claims nor increases a plaintiff's chances
of prevailing on the merits of such claims. Instead, the Supreme Court
merely confirmed that foreign plaintiffs can meet the domestic injury
requirement, which is but one of the many requirements needed to
substantiate a civil RICO claim. Would-be plaintiffs still must overcome
highly-burdensome challenges inherent in civil RICO claims, including
exacting requirements to establish a RICO enterprise, a pattern of
racketeering activity and the elements of specifically-enumerated predicate
acts. When claims are fraud-based (most civil RICO theories are), the
heightened specificity requirements of Rule 9 of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure compound each of these burdens.
Summary
Civil RICO claims are complex and challenging to pursue. The passage
highlights the burdensome nature of establishing a RICO enterprise, a
pattern of racketeering activity, and the specificity required for fraud-based
claims under Rule 9 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. This information
