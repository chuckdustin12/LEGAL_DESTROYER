Question
In a civil or criminal RICO claim under U.S. federal law, under what
circumstances can perjury serve as a predicate act for establishing a pattern
of racketeering activity?
Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
Perjury alone is not a predicate act under RICO as it is not enumerated in 18
U.S.C. § 1961(1). However, perjury can serve as a predicate act if it
constitutes obstruction of justice under 18 U.S.C. § 1503 in federal court
proceedings or is part of a broader fraudulent scheme that involves mail or
wire fraud.
Summary
Under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO),
perjury by itself does not qualify as a "racketeering activity" as defined in 18
U.S.C. § 1961(1), which provides an exhaustive list of state and federal
crimes that can serve as predicate acts for establishing a pattern of
racketeering activity. However, courts have recognized two main
circumstances where perjury can effectively contribute to a RICO claim:
when the perjury constitutes obstruction of justice in federal court
proceedings under 18 U.S.C. § 1503 (which is enumerated as a predicate
act), or when perjury is part of a broader scheme that involves mail fraud or
wire fraud (both of which are enumerated predicate acts).
This distinction reflects the tension in RICO's statutory framework between
Congress's decision to exclude perjury as a predicate act while including
mail and wire fraud. Courts have consistently held that while standalone
instances of perjury cannot form the basis of a RICO claim, perjurious acts
that are instrumental to a larger pattern of racketeering involving
recognized predicate acts can be considered in establishing a RICO
violation. Importantly, this consideration is subject to specific limitations:
perjury in state court proceedings cannot qualify as obstruction of justice
under the federal statute, and courts generally refuse to accept litigation
activities like perjury as predicate acts unless they form part of a broader
fraudulent scheme beyond the litigation context itself.
Background and Relevant Law
Legislative Framework
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) defines
"racketeering activity" in 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1), which provides an exhaustive

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
list of state and federal crimes that can serve as predicate acts for
establishing a pattern of racketeering activity. According to 18 U.S.C. §
1961, "racketeering activity" includes:
"(A) any act or threat involving murder, kidnapping, gambling, arson,
robbery, bribery, extortion, dealing in obscene matter, or dealing in a
controlled substance or listed chemical (as defined in section 102 of the
Controlled Substances Act), which is chargeable under State law and
punishable by imprisonment for more than one year;
(B) any act which is indictable under any of the following provisions of title
18, United States Code: Section 201 (relating to bribery), section 224
(relating to sports bribery), sections 471, 472, and 473 (relating to
counterfeiting), [...] section 1503 (relating to obstruction of justice), section
1510 (relating to obstruction of criminal investigations), section 1511
(relating to the obstruction of State or local law enforcement), section 1512
(relating to tampering with a witness, victim, or an informant), section 1513
(relating to retaliating against a witness, victim, or an informant), [...]"
Notably, perjury (18 U.S.C. § 1621) is not explicitly included in this
enumeration of predicate acts. This omission is significant for our analysis,
as it establishes the baseline principle that perjury, by itself, is not a
predicate act under RICO.
Case Law
Courts have grappled with the question of whether perjury can serve as a
predicate act for RICO claims in several key cases, which have established
important principles governing when perjury might indirectly qualify as a
predicate act.
Perjury as Obstruction of Justice
One avenue through which perjury may potentially serve as a RICO
predicate act is by constituting obstruction of justice under 18 U.S.C. § 1503,
which is explicitly listed as a predicate act in § 1961(1)(B).
In Streck v. Peters, 855 F.Supp. 1156 (D. Haw. 1994), the court addressed
this possibility directly. The court observed: "The federal criminal statute
prohibiting perjury, 18 U.S.C. § 1621, does not appear among the statutes
listed in § 1961(1)(B), which lists the federal statutory violations which may
constitute the necessary predicate acts to support a RICO claim." However,
the court went on to note that "acts of perjury are indictable under the
obstruction of justice statute, see United States v. Mayer, 775 F.2d 1387,
1391 (9th Cir.1985) (stating that a false statement to the magistrate is
properly charged under § 1503 as this was 'consistent with a scheme in
which frauds perpetrated upon a court in its adjudicative capacity must be
prosecuted as perjury, obstruction of justice, or contempt')." Based on this
reasoning, the court concluded that "acts of perjury may, under the
appropriate circumstances, constitute RICO predicate acts" when they are
indictable under the obstruction of justice statute.

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
This principle was further applied in Smith v. Aldridge, No. 3:17-cv-01485-
HZ (D. Or. Mar 22, 2018), where the court stated: "Plaintiff's allegations of
perjury may amount to 'obstruction of justice' under § 1503 and, thus,
qualify as 'racketeering activity.'" However, the court also established an
important limitation: "the alleged perjury all took place in the context of a
state criminal proceeding, and 18 U.S.C. § 1503—the appropriate federal
statute—only applies to obstruction of justice in federal court proceedings."
This indicates that for perjury to qualify as obstruction of justice under §
1503, and thus as a RICO predicate act, it must occur in federal, not state,
court proceedings.
Perjury as Part of a Mail or Wire Fraud Scheme
The second circumstance where perjury may contribute to establishing a
RICO claim is when it is part of a broader fraudulent scheme that involves
mail fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1341) or wire fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343), both of which
are enumerated as predicate acts in § 1961(1)(B).
In U.S. v. Eisen, 974 F.2d 246 (2nd Cir. 1992), the Second Circuit addressed
the tension between Congress's decision to exclude perjury as a predicate
act while including mail fraud. The court acknowledged that "there is some
tension between the congressional decision to include federal mail fraud as
a predicate offense and to exclude perjury, whether in violation of federal or
state law." Nevertheless, the court held that "where, as here, a fraudulent
scheme falls within the scope of the federal mail fraud statute and the other
elements of RICO are established, use of the mail fraud offense as a RICO
predicate act cannot be suspended simply because perjury is part of the
means for perpetrating the fraud."
This principle was reaffirmed in Daddona v. Gaudio, 156 F.Supp.2d 153 (D.
Conn. 2000), which cited Eisen and concluded that "where a fraudulent
scheme falls within the scope of the federal mail fraud statute and the other
elements of RICO are established, use of the mail fraud offense as a RICO
predicate act cannot be suspended simply because perjury is part of the
means for perpetrating the fraud." The court also noted that "where a series
of related state court perjuries occurs, it will often be possible to allege and
prove both a scheme to defraud within the meaning of the mail fraud statute
as well as the elements of a RICO violation. But in such cases, it will not be
the fact of the perjuries alone that suffices to bring the matter within the
scope of RICO."
More recently, ASI, Inc. v. Aquawood, LLC, Civil No. 19-763 (JRT/HB) (D.
Minn. Oct 05, 2020) confirmed this principle, stating: "Although perjury
alone is not a predicate act under RICO, courts have found that false
litigation documents can support a mail/wire fraud RICO claim." The court
cited Eisen and observed that the key distinction appears to be "whether the
RICO claim sounds entirely in perjury and false testimony, or whether the
false court filings are merely one aspect of the claim."
Similarly, Feld Entm't, Inc. v. Am. Soc. for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals, 873 F.Supp.2d 288 (D. D.C. 2012) noted that "courts have refused
to allow 'litigation activities' such as filing fraudulent documents or

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
engaging in baseless litigation to serve as predicate acts for RICO, but only
in circumstances where such acts constitute 'the only allegedly fraudulent
conduct.'" This suggests that perjury, as a form of litigation activity, would
not qualify as a predicate act if it is the sole basis for the RICO claim.
Analysis
Based on the legislative framework and case law examined, we can identify
two specific circumstances where perjury might serve as a predicate act for
establishing a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO:
1. Perjury as Obstruction of Justice in Federal Court
Proceedings
When perjury occurs in federal court proceedings and constitutes
obstruction of justice under 18 U.S.C. § 1503, it can serve as a predicate act
for RICO purposes. This is because obstruction of justice is explicitly listed
as a predicate act in § 1961(1)(B).
As established in Streck v. Peters, 855 F.Supp. 1156 (D. Haw. 1994), "acts of
perjury may, under the appropriate circumstances, constitute RICO
predicate acts" when they are indictable under the obstruction of justice
statute. The court's reasoning relied on the principle that acts of perjury can
be indictable under the obstruction of justice statute, which is listed as a
predicate act under RICO.
However, this avenue for treating perjury as a predicate act is subject to an
important limitation: the perjury must occur in federal court proceedings. As
clarified in Smith v. Aldridge, No. 3:17-cv-01485-HZ (D. Or. Mar 22, 2018),
18 U.S.C. § 1503 "only applies to obstruction of justice in federal court
proceedings." Consequently, perjury in state court proceedings cannot
qualify as a predicate act under this theory.
This limitation reflects a deliberate choice by Congress. By excluding
perjury itself from the list of predicate acts while including obstruction of
justice, Congress appears to have intended that simple instances of perjury
should not form the basis of federal RICO claims. Instead, only perjury that
rises to the level of obstruction of justice in federal proceedings may qualify.
2. Perjury as Part of a Mail or Wire Fraud Scheme
The second circumstance arises when perjury is part of a broader fraudulent
scheme that involves mail fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1341) or wire fraud (18 U.S.C. §
1343), both of which are explicitly listed as predicate acts in § 1961(1)(B).
As established in U.S. v. Eisen, 974 F.2d 246 (2nd Cir. 1992), "where a
fraudulent scheme falls within the scope of the federal mail fraud statute
and the other elements of RICO are established, use of the mail fraud
offense as a RICO predicate act cannot be suspended simply because perjury
is part of the means for perpetrating the fraud." This principle allows courts

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
to consider perjury in the context of RICO when it is instrumental to a
broader fraudulent scheme.
This approach was further elaborated in Daddona v. Gaudio, 156 F.Supp.2d
153 (D. Conn. 2000), which noted that "where a series of related state court
perjuries occurs, it will often be possible to allege and prove both a scheme
to defraud within the meaning of the mail fraud statute as well as the
elements of a RICO violation. But in such cases, it will not be the fact of the
perjuries alone that suffices to bring the matter within the scope of RICO."
More recent cases have continued to apply this principle. ASI, Inc. v.
Aquawood, LLC, Civil No. 19-763 (JRT/HB) (D. Minn. Oct 05, 2020)
confirmed that "false litigation documents can support a mail/wire fraud
RICO claim." The court identified a key distinction: "whether the RICO claim
sounds entirely in perjury and false testimony, or whether the false court
filings are merely one aspect of the claim." This suggests that courts will
look to whether the perjury is the sole basis for the RICO claim or just one
element of a broader pattern of racketeering activity.
Similarly, Feld Entm't, Inc. v. Am. Soc. for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals, 873 F.Supp.2d 288 (D. D.C. 2012) indicated that litigation activities
like perjury cannot serve as predicate acts for RICO only when they
constitute "the only allegedly fraudulent conduct." This reinforces the
principle that perjury, when part of a broader fraudulent scheme, can
contribute to establishing a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO.
Exceptions and Caveats
Several important exceptions and caveats must be considered when
evaluating whether perjury can serve as a predicate act for RICO claims:
1. Perjury in State Court Proceedings
As established in Smith v. Aldridge, No. 3:17-cv-01485-HZ (D. Or. Mar 22,
2018), 18 U.S.C. § 1503—the federal obstruction of justice statute—"only
applies to obstruction of justice in federal court proceedings." Consequently,
perjury in state court proceedings cannot qualify as a predicate act under
the theory that it constitutes obstruction of justice. This limitation reflects
what the Second Circuit in U.S. v. Eisen, 974 F.2d 246 (2nd Cir. 1992)
described as "an understandable reluctance to use federal criminal law as a
back-stop for all state court litigation."
However, it's important to note that this limitation applies only when trying
to characterize perjury as obstruction of justice. Perjury in state court
proceedings might still be relevant to a RICO claim if it is part of a broader
fraudulent scheme involving mail or wire fraud.
2. Perjury as the Sole Basis for a RICO Claim
Courts have consistently refused to allow RICO claims that are based solely
on perjury or false testimony. As noted in ASI, Inc. v. Aquawood, LLC, Civil

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
No. 19-763 (JRT/HB) (D. Minn. Oct 05, 2020), the key distinction is "whether
the RICO claim sounds entirely in perjury and false testimony, or whether
the false court filings are merely one aspect of the claim." This principle is
also reflected in Feld Entm't, Inc. v. Am. Soc. for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals, 873 F.Supp.2d 288 (D. D.C. 2012), which observed that courts have
refused to allow litigation activities like perjury to serve as predicate acts
for RICO when such acts constitute "the only allegedly fraudulent conduct."
This caveat ensures that RICO is not used to federalize ordinary instances of
perjury, which Congress deliberately excluded from the statute's list of
predicate acts.
3. The Need for a Broader Fraudulent Scheme
For perjury to contribute to establishing a pattern of racketeering activity
under RICO, it must typically be part of a broader fraudulent scheme that
involves recognized predicate acts, such as mail or wire fraud. As
established in Daddona v. Gaudio, 156 F.Supp.2d 153 (D. Conn. 2000), "it
will not be the fact of the perjuries alone that suffices to bring the matter
within the scope of RICO." Instead, the perjury must be instrumental to a
broader scheme that falls within the scope of the federal mail fraud statute
or another recognized predicate act.
This requirement reflects the balance struck by Congress in excluding
perjury while including mail and wire fraud as predicate acts. As the Second
Circuit noted in U.S. v. Eisen, 974 F.2d 246 (2nd Cir. 1992), "there is some
tension between the congressional decision to include federal mail fraud as
a predicate offense and to exclude perjury, whether in violation of federal or
state law." The court resolved this tension by allowing perjury to be
considered when it is part of a fraudulent scheme that falls within the scope
of the mail fraud statute, but not when it stands alone.
Conclusion
Based on the provided legal materials, perjury cannot serve as a standalone
predicate act for establishing a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO,
as it is not included in the enumeration of predicate acts in 18 U.S.C. §
1961(1). However, perjury can contribute to establishing a RICO claim
under two specific circumstances:
First, when perjury occurs in federal court proceedings and constitutes
obstruction of justice under 18 U.S.C. § 1503, it can serve as a predicate act
because obstruction of justice is listed as a predicate act in § 1961(1)(B).
This avenue is unavailable for perjury in state court proceedings, as the
federal obstruction of justice statute applies only to federal proceedings.
Second, when perjury is part of a broader fraudulent scheme that involves
recognized predicate acts, such as mail fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1341) or wire
fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343), it can contribute to establishing a pattern of
racketeering activity under RICO. However, the perjury cannot be the sole

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
basis for the RICO claim; it must be instrumental to a broader fraudulent
scheme that falls within the scope of a recognized predicate act.
These limitations reflect a deliberate choice by Congress to exclude perjury
itself from the list of predicate acts while including obstruction of justice
and fraud. Courts have navigated this tension by allowing perjury to be
considered in the context of RICO when it is part of a broader pattern of
racketeering activity involving recognized predicate acts, but not when it
stands alone.
This approach ensures that RICO is not used to federalize ordinary instances
of perjury while still allowing courts to consider perjury in the context of
more comprehensive fraudulent schemes that fall within the statute's
intended scope.

2020)
U.S. District Court — District of Minnesota
Extract
Dubinsky argues that litigation activities cannot be the basis of RICO fraud
claims and that perjury and false testimony are not RICO predicates.
Although perjury alone is not a predicate act under RICO, courts have found
that false litigation documents can support a mail/wire fraud RICO claim.
See United States v. Eisen, 974 F.2d 246, 253 (2d Cir. 1992) ('[W]here, as
here, a fraudulent scheme falls within the scope of the federal mail fraud
statute and the other elements of RICO are established, use of the mail
fraud offense as a RICO predicate act cannot be suspended simply because
perjury is part of the means for perpetrating the fraud.')... However, the
distinction between the two lines of cases seems to be based on whether the
RICO claim sounds entirely in perjury and false testimony, or whether the
false court filings are merely one aspect of the claim. See, e.g., Feld Entm't
Inc. v. Am. Soc. for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, 873 F. Supp. 2d
288, 318 (D.D.C. 2012) (litigation activities can serve as RICO predicate acts
as long as there are additional allegations of racketeering activity).
Summary
Perjury alone is not considered a predicate act under RICO. However, if
perjury is part of a broader fraudulent scheme that involves mail or wire
fraud, it can contribute to establishing a RICO claim. The key distinction is
whether the RICO claim is based solely on perjury or if perjury is just one
element of a larger pattern of racketeering activity. This indicates that
perjury can be considered in the context of RICO if it is part of a broader
fraudulent scheme involving other predicate acts.

Finally, Weinstein contends that permitting the mail fraud offenses charged
in the Eisen indictment to serve as RICO predicate acts conflicts with the
deliberate decision made by Congress in omitting perjury as one of the
enumerated RICO predicate offenses within the definition of 'racketeering
activity.' See 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1). Contrary to the Government's abrupt
dismissal of this argument as 'baseless,' Brief for Appellee at 36, we
recognize that there is some tension between the congressional decision to
include federal mail fraud as a predicate offense and to exclude perjury,
whether in violation of federal or state law. That tension is illustrated by this
prosecution in which the fraudulent scheme consists primarily of arranging
for state court witnesses to commit perjury. Though the tension exists, we do
not believe it places the indictment in this case beyond the purview of RICO.
Congress did not wish to permit instances of federal or state court perjury
as such to constitute a pattern of RICO racketeering acts. Apparently, there
was an understandable reluctance to use federal criminal law as a back-stop
for all state court litigation. Nevertheless, where, as here, a fraudulent
scheme falls within the scope of the federal mail fraud statute and the other
elements of RICO are established, use of the mail fraud offense as a RICO
predicate act cannot be suspended simply because perjury is part of the
means for perpetrating the fraud.
Summary
Perjury, by itself, is not a predicate act under RICO as per 18 U.S.C. §
1961(1). However, if perjury is part of a broader fraudulent scheme that falls
under the federal mail fraud statute, it can be considered in establishing a
RICO violation. The court acknowledges the tension between excluding
perjury as a predicate act and including mail fraud, but it does not exclude
mail fraud as a predicate act even if perjury is involved in the fraudulent
scheme.

U.S. District Court — District of Columbia
Extract
Defendants are correct that courts have refused to allow “litigation
activities” such as filing fraudulent documents or engaging in baseless
litigation to serve as predicate acts for RICO, but only in circumstances
where such acts constitute “the only allegedly fraudulent conduct.” Daddona
v. Gaudio, 156 F.Supp.2d 153, 162 (D.Conn.2000). In such circumstances,
courts have found that these allegations of litigation misconduct may be

grounds for malicious prosecution or abuse of process claims, but not for a
RICO case.
Summary
Courts generally do not allow litigation activities, such as filing fraudulent
documents, to serve as predicate acts for RICO unless they are part of a
broader pattern of fraudulent conduct. This suggests that perjury, as a form
of litigation misconduct, would not typically qualify as a predicate act for
RICO unless it is part of a larger scheme involving other types of
racketeering activity.

Extract
Plaintiff's allegations of perjury may amount to 'obstruction of justice' under
§ 1503 and, thus, qualify as 'racketeering activity.' See Streck v. Peters, 855
F. Supp. 1156, 1162 (D. Haw. 1994) (noting that 'acts of perjury may, under
the appropriate circumstances, constitute RICO predicate acts' as
obstruction of justice under 18 U.S.C. § 1503). However, the alleged perjury
all took place in the context of a state criminal proceeding, and 18 U.S.C. §
1503—the appropriate federal statute—only applies to obstruction of justice
in federal court proceedings.
Summary
Perjury can potentially serve as a predicate act for a RICO claim if it
constitutes obstruction of justice under 18 U.S.C. § 1503. However, this is
limited to federal court proceedings, as § 1503 applies only to obstruction of
justice in federal contexts. Therefore, perjury in state proceedings does not
qualify under this statute for RICO purposes.

In Eisen, the Second Circuit noted that 'there is some tension between the
congressional decision to include federal mail fraud as a predicate offense
and to exclude perjury, whether in violation of federal or state law.' 974 F.2d

RICO are established, use of the mail fraud offense as a RICO predicate act
cannot be suspended simply because perjury is part of the means for

perpetrating the fraud. We do not doubt that where a series of related state
court perjuries occurs, it will often be possible to allege and prove both a
scheme to defraud within the meaning of the mail fraud statute as well as
the elements of a RICO violation. But in such cases, it will not be the fact of
the perjuries alone that suffices to bring the matter within the scope of
RICO.
Summary
Perjury, by itself, is not included as a predicate act under the RICO statute.
However, if perjury is part of a broader fraudulent scheme that falls within
the scope of the federal mail fraud statute, and the other elements of a RICO
violation are established, then the use of mail fraud as a predicate act
cannot be dismissed simply because perjury is involved. This indicates that
perjury can be considered in the context of a RICO claim if it is part of a
larger fraudulent scheme that includes other qualifying predicate acts.

Extract
The federal criminal statute prohibiting perjury, 18 U.S.C. § 1621, does not
appear among the statutes listed in § 1961(1)(B), which lists the federal
statutory violations which may constitute the necessary predicate acts to
support a RICO claim. Nonetheless, some authority exists for the position
that perjury may qualify as a RICO predicate act. C & W Constr. Co. v.
Brotherhood of Carpenters & Joiners of Am., 687 F.Supp. 1453, 1467
(D.Haw.1988). Other courts, however, had concluded that perjury alone is
not 'racketeering activity.' E.g., Rand v. Anaconda, Inc., 623 F.Supp. 176,
182 (E.D.N.Y.1985) ('Perjury ... is not a RICO predicate act.'), aff'd, 794 F.2d
843 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 987, 107 S.Ct. 579, 93 L.Ed.2d 582
(1986); Lewis v. Sporck, 612 F.Supp. 1316, 1325 (N.D.Cal.1985) ('Bad acts,
alone, do not qualify as predicate acts for RICO purposes; only those
activities set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1) may serve as the basis for a RICO
claim.'). Because acts of perjury are indictable under the obstruction of
justice statute, see United States v. Mayer, 775 F.2d 1387, 1391 (9th Cir.
1985) (stating that a false statement to the magistrate is properly charged
under § 1503 as this was 'consistent with a scheme in which frauds
perpetrated upon a court in its adjudicative capacity must be prosecuted as
perjury, obstruction of justice, or contempt'), and because the RICO statute
specifies that acts indictable under the obstruction of justice statute are
RICO predicate acts, see 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1)(B), this Court believes the
better reasoned position is that acts of perjury may, under the appropriate
circumstances, constitute RICO predicate acts.

Summary
Perjury, by itself, is not listed as a predicate act under the RICO statute.
However, it can be considered a predicate act if it is indictable under the
obstruction of justice statute, which is listed as a predicate act under RICO.
This suggests that perjury could serve as a predicate act if it is part of a
broader scheme involving obstruction of justice.
