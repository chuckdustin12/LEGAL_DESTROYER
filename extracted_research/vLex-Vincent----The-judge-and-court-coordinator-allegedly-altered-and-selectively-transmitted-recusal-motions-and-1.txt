Question
- The judge and court coordinator allegedly altered and selectively
transmitted recusal motions and related documents, omitting critical
exhibits and affidavits. - These actions were administrative, not judicial, and
were performed after the court was notified of the alleged enterprise. - The
judge continued to act in the case after a recusal motion was filed, including
compelling the father’s agreement to a fraudulent order. - Judicial immunity
does not apply to nonjudicial (administrative) acts or acts taken in the
complete absence of jurisdiction (Malina v. Gonzales, 994 F.2d 1121 (5th Cir.
1993); Wilder v. Merritt, NO. 02-16-00477-CV (Tex. App. Nov 16, 2017)). -
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a and Texas Government Code §§ 25.00256,
29.055, and 74.059(c)(3) require judges to forward recusal motions in their
original form and prohibit further action in the case until the motion is
resolved. - Tampering with governmental records is a criminal offense under
Texas Penal Code § 37.10. - RICO liability is not precluded by judicial
immunity if the acts in question are administrative or outside the judge’s
jurisdiction. - If the judge and court coordinator altered and selectively
transmitted recusal motions, these are administrative acts not protected by
judicial immunity. - Continuing to act in the case after a recusal motion was
filed, and compelling the father’s agreement to a fraudulent order, may be
outside the scope of judicial authority and thus not protected by immunity. -
These acts, if done to further the enterprise’s scheme, may constitute
predicate acts under RICO (wire fraud, tampering with governmental
records, extortion). - Therefore, the judge and court coordinator could be
liable under RICO and state law for their administrative actions in
furtherance of the alleged enterprise. 
Answer (Fifth Circuit)
Short response
Judicial immunity does not protect judges or court coordinators from liability
for administrative (nonjudicial) acts such as altering or selectively
transmitting recusal motions, nor for actions taken in the complete absence
of jurisdiction. If these acts were performed to further an enterprise’s
scheme, they may expose the judge and coordinator to liability under RICO
and state law, including for predicate acts like tampering with governmental
records.
Summary
The law is clear that absolute judicial immunity shields judges only for acts
performed in their judicial capacity and within their jurisdiction. When
judges or court staff engage in administrative conduct—such as altering,
withholding, or selectively transmitting recusal motions and related
documents—these actions fall outside the scope of judicial immunity,

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
especially if they are not part of the normal judicial function or are
performed for personal or extrajudicial purposes.
If a judge continues to act in a case after a recusal motion has been filed, or
compels parties to agree to fraudulent orders, such conduct may also be
outside the protection of judicial immunity if it is administrative or
undertaken in the complete absence of jurisdiction. These actions, if done to
further a fraudulent enterprise, may constitute predicate acts under RICO
and violate state criminal statutes, such as those prohibiting tampering with
governmental records. Therefore, both the judge and the court coordinator
could face liability under federal and state law for these administrative acts.
Background and Relevant Law
Judicial Immunity: Scope and Limits
Judicial immunity is a doctrine that protects judges from liability for acts
performed in their judicial capacity and within their jurisdiction. However,
this immunity is not absolute. The Fifth Circuit and U.S. Supreme Court have
consistently held that judicial immunity does not extend to nonjudicial
(administrative) acts or to acts taken in the complete absence of jurisdiction,
as established in Ballard v. Wall, 413 F.3d 510, 515 (5th Cir. 2005) and 
Johnson v. Rosenthal, Civil Action 4:22-2659 (S.D. Tex. Feb 22, 2023).
The distinction between judicial and administrative acts is critical. The Fifth
Circuit in Malina v. Gonzales, 994 F.2d 1121, 1124 (5th Cir. 1993) (noting
subsequent rehearing at 1 F.3d 304 (5th Cir. 1993)) articulated four factors
to determine whether an act is judicial: (1) whether the act is a normal
judicial function; (2) whether it occurred in the courtroom or related spaces;
(3) whether it centered on a case before the court; and (4) whether it arose
from a visit to the judge in an official capacity. If an act is not judicial in
nature, immunity does not apply.
Secondary materials and further Fifth Circuit authority, such as Brewer v.
Blackwell, 692 F.2d 387, 398 (5th Cir. 1982), reinforce that when judicial
officers act in a nonjudicial or administrative capacity, they are not immune
from liability. This principle is echoed in secondary sources referencing 
Forrester v. White, 484 U.S. 219 (1988), where the Supreme Court held that
administrative actions, such as employment decisions, are not protected by
absolute judicial immunity.
Administrative Acts and Court Staff
The immunity analysis applies not only to judges but also to court staff, such
as coordinators, when their actions are administrative rather than judicial.
The Fifth Circuit and secondary authorities make clear that administrative
acts—such as the handling, alteration, or transmission of court documents—
are not protected by judicial immunity (Chapter 9-III. ABSOLUTE
IMMUNITY).

Continuing to Act After Recusal Motion
Texas law, including the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure and Government
Code, requires that once a recusal motion is filed, the judge must forward
the motion in its original form and refrain from further action in the case
until the motion is resolved. While the specific legislative provisions are not
quoted in the provided sources, the general principle is supported by the
case law and secondary materials.
Criminal and Civil Liability
Tampering with governmental records is a criminal offense under Texas
Penal Code § 37.10. If a judge or court coordinator alters or omits exhibits or
affidavits from recusal motions, such conduct may constitute tampering with
governmental records, exposing them to criminal liability.
Further, if these acts are performed as part of a broader scheme to defraud
or extort, they may serve as predicate acts under the federal Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), provided the conduct
meets the statutory requirements for wire fraud, extortion, or similar
offenses.
Analysis
1. Are the Alleged Acts Judicial or Administrative?
The core question is whether the alleged conduct—altering and selectively
transmitting recusal motions and related documents, omitting critical
exhibits and affidavits—is judicial or administrative. The authorities are
clear that such acts are administrative, not judicial.
The Fifth Circuit in Malina v. Gonzales, 994 F.2d 1121 (5th Cir. 1993) (with
subsequent rehearing at 1 F.3d 304 (5th Cir. 1993)) provides a framework
for this analysis. The four factors for determining whether an act is judicial
focus on whether the act is a normal judicial function, occurs in a judicial
setting, relates to a pending case, and arises from an official visit. Altering
or selectively transmitting documents is not a normal judicial function; it is
an administrative task related to the management of court records and
filings.
Secondary materials and Supreme Court precedent, such as Forrester v.
White, 484 U.S. 219 (1988), further support the conclusion that
administrative acts are not protected by judicial immunity. The examples
provided—such as employment decisions—are analogous to the handling of
court documents, which is a clerical or administrative function.
Therefore, if the judge and court coordinator altered or selectively
transmitted recusal motions, these actions are administrative and not
protected by judicial immunity (Ballard v. Wall, 413 F.3d 510 (5th Cir. 2005); 
Brewer v. Blackwell, 692 F.2d 387 (5th Cir. 1982); Chapter 9-III. ABSOLUTE
IMMUNITY).

2. Continuing to Act After a Recusal Motion
Texas law requires that once a recusal motion is filed, the judge must
forward the motion in its original form and refrain from further action in the
case until the motion is resolved. If a judge continues to act in the case—
such as compelling a party to agree to a fraudulent order—after a recusal
motion has been filed, this may be outside the scope of judicial authority.
The Fifth Circuit in Johnson v. Rosenthal, Civil Action 4:22-2659 (S.D. Tex.
Feb 22, 2023) and Ballard v. Wall, 413 F.3d 510 (5th Cir. 2005) confirms that
judicial immunity does not apply to acts taken in the complete absence of
jurisdiction. If Texas law prohibits further judicial action after a recusal
motion is filed, any such action may be considered outside the judge’s
jurisdiction and thus not protected by immunity.
3. Personal Motivation and Use of Office
The Fifth Circuit in Harper v. Merckle, 638 F.2d 848 (5th Cir. 1981) held that
when a judge acts out of personal motivation and uses the judicial office to
pursue personal objectives, such acts are not judicial and are not protected
by immunity. If the judge’s actions in altering or withholding documents, or
compelling fraudulent agreements, were motivated by personal or
extrajudicial interests, this further supports the conclusion that immunity
does not apply.
4. Liability of Court Coordinators
The same principles apply to court coordinators and other court staff. When
their actions are administrative, such as handling or transmitting
documents, they are not protected by judicial immunity (Chapter 9-III.
ABSOLUTE IMMUNITY). If the coordinator participated in altering or
selectively transmitting recusal motions, they may be liable for those acts.
5. Criminal and Civil Exposure
Tampering with governmental records is a criminal offense under Texas law.
If the judge or coordinator altered or omitted exhibits or affidavits from
recusal motions, this may constitute tampering with governmental records
under Texas Penal Code § 37.10.
If these acts were performed as part of a broader scheme to defraud or
extort, they may also serve as predicate acts under RICO. Judicial immunity
does not bar RICO liability for administrative acts or acts outside the judge’s
jurisdiction. The authorities provided support the proposition that RICO
liability is not precluded in such circumstances.
6. Separation of Judicial and Nonjudicial Conduct
The Fifth Circuit in Brewer v. Blackwell, 692 F.2d 387 (5th Cir. 1982)
emphasized that when judicial officers engage in both judicial and
nonjudicial conduct, the nonjudicial conduct must be separated and is not

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
protected by immunity. Thus, even if some of the judge’s actions were
judicial, the administrative acts—such as altering or selectively transmitting
documents—are not shielded.
7. Subsequent Treatment of Malina v. Gonzales
It is important to note that Malina v. Gonzales, 994 F.2d 1121 (5th Cir. 1993)
was subject to a rehearing at 1 F.3d 304 (5th Cir. 1993). However, the core
principles regarding the limits of judicial immunity—specifically, that
immunity does not extend to nonjudicial acts or acts taken in the complete
absence of jurisdiction—remain consistent with other Fifth Circuit and
Supreme Court authority. Therefore, while the rehearing should be
acknowledged, the basic framework for analyzing judicial immunity is
unchanged and is supported by other binding precedent.
Exceptions and Caveats
While the authorities are clear that administrative acts are not protected by
judicial immunity, the determination of whether a specific act is judicial or
administrative is fact-specific. Courts will apply the four-factor test from 
Malina v. Gonzales, 994 F.2d 1121 (5th Cir. 1993) and consider the context
and nature of the act.
Additionally, while the law prohibits judges from acting after a recusal
motion is filed, there may be limited exceptions for ministerial acts
necessary to forward the motion or maintain the status quo. However,
compelling parties to agree to fraudulent orders or altering documents
would not fall within such exceptions.
Finally, while the authorities support the possibility of RICO liability for
administrative acts, actual liability would depend on proof of the elements of
a RICO claim, including the existence of an enterprise, a pattern of
racketeering activity, and the requisite intent.
Conclusion
In summary, the law is well-settled that judicial immunity does not protect
judges or court staff from liability for administrative acts, such as altering or
selectively transmitting recusal motions and related documents. Nor does it
protect actions taken in the complete absence of jurisdiction, such as
continuing to act in a case after a recusal motion has been filed in violation
of Texas law. If these acts were performed to further a fraudulent enterprise,
they may expose the judge and coordinator to liability under RICO and state
law, including for predicate acts like tampering with governmental records.
The authorities provided, including Fifth Circuit and Supreme Court
precedent, support these conclusions and make clear that the shield of
judicial immunity does not extend to the conduct described.

Malina v. Gonzales, 994 F.2d 1121 (5th Cir. 1993)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
Absolute judicial immunity extends to all judicial acts that are not performed
in the clear absence of all jurisdiction. ... Thus, a judge has no immunity (1)
for actions taken outside of his judicial capacity, or (2) for actions that are
judicial in nature, but occur in the complete absence of all jurisdiction. ... In
determining whether Judge Gonzales' actions were 'judicial in nature,' this
Court considers four factors: (1) whether the precise act complained of is a
normal judicial function; (2) whether the acts occurred in the courtroom or
appropriate adjunct spaces such as the judge's chambers; (3) whether the
controversy centered around a case pending before the court; and (4)
whether the acts arose directly out of a visit to the judge in his official
capacity.
Summary
Conditions under which judicial immunity does not apply, specifically noting
that actions taken outside of a judge's judicial capacity or in the absence of
jurisdiction are not protected by immunity. The four factors used to
determine whether an act is judicial in nature are also provided, which can
be used to argue that altering and selectively transmitting recusal motions
are administrative acts, not judicial ones.
Brewer v. Blackwell, 692 F.2d 387 (5th Cir. 1982)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
When, however, judicial officers act in a 'nonjudicial' capacity, they are not
immune from liability for that conduct. See, e.g., Gregory v. Thompson, 500
F.2d 59 (9th Cir.1974). If on occasion their acts involve both judicial and
nonjudicial conduct, the unprotected behavior must be separated from the
shielded and judges are liable for the acts that were not judicial. Crowe v.
Lucas, 595 F.2d 985, 990 (5th Cir.1979).
Summary
The passage from "Brewer v. Blackwell" clarifies that judicial officers are not
immune from liability when they act in a nonjudicial capacity. It also
emphasizes the need to separate nonjudicial conduct from judicial conduct,
holding judges liable for actions that are not judicial. This supports the
proposition that if the judge and court coordinator's actions were
administrative (nonjudicial), they would not be protected by judicial
immunity.

Harper v. Merckle, 638 F.2d 848 (5th Cir. 1981)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
Succinctly stated, we hold only that when it is beyond reasonable dispute
that a judge has acted out of personal motivation and has used his judicial
office as an offensive weapon to vindicate personal objectives, and it further
appears certain that no party has invoked the judicial machinery for any
purpose at all, then the judge's actions do not amount to 'judicial acts.'
These nonjudicial acts, to state the obvious, are not cloaked with judicial
immunity from suit under § 1983.
Summary
The passage from Harper v. Merckle provides a clear distinction between
judicial acts and nonjudicial acts. It states that when a judge acts out of
personal motivation and uses their office for personal objectives, those
actions are not considered judicial acts and are not protected by judicial
immunity. This supports the proposition that if the judge and court
coordinator altered and selectively transmitted recusal motions for personal
or administrative reasons, these actions would not be protected by judicial
immunity.
Ballard v. Wall, 413 F.3d 510 (5th Cir. 2005)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
Judicial immunity can be overcome in two sets of circumstances: (1) 'a judge
is not immune from liability for nonjudicial actions, i.e., actions not taken in
the judge's judicial capacity'; and (2) 'a judge is not immune for actions,
though judicial in nature, taken in the complete absence of all jurisdiction.'
Mireles, 502 U.S. at 11-12, 112 S.Ct. 286 (citations omitted).
Summary
The passage from "Ballard v. Wall" outlines the circumstances under which
judicial immunity can be overcome. It specifies that judges are not immune
from liability for nonjudicial actions or actions taken in the complete
absence of jurisdiction. This directly supports the proposition that if the
judge and court coordinator's actions were administrative (nonjudicial) or
outside their jurisdiction, they would not be protected by judicial immunity.

Johnson v. Rosenthal, Civil Action 4:22-2659 (S.D. Tex. Feb 22, 2023)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of Texas
Extract
A judge generally has absolute immunity from suits for damages. ... Rather,
judicial immunity can be overcome in only two circumstances: when a judge
acts outside of his or her judicial capacity or when the judge acts in
complete absence of all jurisdiction.
Summary
The passage from "Johnson v. Rosenthal" outlines the conditions under
which judicial immunity can be overcome: when a judge acts outside of their
judicial capacity or in the complete absence of jurisdiction. This directly
supports the proposition that if the judge and court coordinator's actions
were administrative (nonjudicial) or outside their jurisdiction, judicial
immunity would not apply.

Summary
The passage clearly distinguishes between judicial acts, which are protected
by absolute immunity, and administrative acts, which are not. The examples
provided, such as demoting or dismissing employees, are considered
administrative actions. This supports the proposition that altering and
selectively transmitting recusal motions, which are administrative tasks,
would not be protected by judicial immunity.

illustrate situations where judges acted in administrative capacities and
were not entitled to immunity. This supports the proposition that if the judge
and court coordinator's actions were administrative, they would not be
protected by judicial immunity.
