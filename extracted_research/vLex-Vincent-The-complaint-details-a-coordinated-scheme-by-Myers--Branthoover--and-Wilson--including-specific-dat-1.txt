Question
The complaint details a coordinated scheme by Myers, Branthoover, and
Wilson, including specific dates, communications, and actions: Myers and
Branthoover exchanged interstate calls and texts, Myers traveled to
Oklahoma to draft false legal documents, Wilson served an eviction notice
based on fabricated grounds, and all used mail and wire communications.
The complaint provides dates, content of communications, and the roles of
each defendant. Ongoing threats and coordination are documented through
specific text messages and events from December 2023 through May 2025.
A RICO conspiracy claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d) must satisfy Federal
Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a) and, for predicate acts of fraud, Rule 9(b),
requiring that the complaint allege with particularity the circumstances
constituting fraud, including the who, what, when, where, and how of the
alleged misconduct. The complaint’s detailed chronology, identification of
participants, specific communications, and description of each defendant’s
role and actions meet the heightened pleading requirements for RICO
conspiracy and fraud-based predicate acts.
Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
Based on the provided legal materials, the complaint's detailed allegations
regarding the coordinated scheme between Myers, Branthoover, and Wilson,
including specific dates, communications, actions, and roles of each
defendant, satisfy both the basic pleading standards of Rule 8(a) and the
heightened particularity requirements of Rule 9(b) for RICO conspiracy
claims under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d) involving fraud-based predicate acts.
Summary
The complaint in question adequately fulfills the pleading requirements for a
RICO conspiracy claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d) by providing a detailed
chronology of events, identifying all participants, documenting specific
communications, and describing the distinct roles and actions of each
defendant in the alleged fraudulent scheme. This level of detail satisfies both
the standard pleading requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a),
which requires "a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the
pleader is entitled to relief," and the heightened particularity requirements
of Rule 9(b) applicable to fraud-based claims, which demands specificity
regarding the "who, what, when, where, and how" of the alleged
misconduct.
The complaint's allegations of interstate calls and texts between Myers and
Branthoover, Myers' travel to Oklahoma to draft false legal documents,
Wilson's service of an eviction notice based on fabricated grounds, and the
defendants' use of mail and wire communications are particularly

significant. These detailed allegations establish the predicate acts of mail
and wire fraud necessary for a RICO claim while demonstrating the
existence of a coordinated scheme among the defendants. The complaint's
documentation of ongoing threats and coordination through specific text
messages and events from December 2023 through May 2025 further
supports the "relationship" and "continuity" requirements essential to
establishing a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO jurisprudence.
Legal Framework for RICO Conspiracy Claims
Statutory Basis
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) provides
civil and criminal liability for racketeering activity connected to an
enterprise. The specific conspiracy provision at issue is found in 18 U.S.C. §
1962(d), which states: "It shall be unlawful for any person to conspire to
violate any of the provisions of subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section." 18
U.S.C. § 1962(d)
To understand what constitutes a conspiracy under RICO, it's essential to
recognize what the underlying substantive violations entail. Section 1962(c),
which is commonly the basis for RICO conspiracy claims, prohibits "any
person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the
activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or
participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs
through a pattern of racketeering activity." Heinrich v. Waiting Angels
Adoption Servs., Inc., 668 F.3d 393, 404 (6th Cir. 2012)
Wire fraud, one of the predicate acts alleged in the complaint, is defined
under 18 U.S.C. § 1343, which prohibits: "Whoever, having devised or
intending to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money
or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or
promises, transmits or causes to be transmitted by means of wire, radio, or
television communication in interstate or foreign commerce, any writings,
signs, signals, pictures, or sounds for the purpose of executing such scheme
or artifice." 18 U.S.C. § 1343
Elements of a RICO Claim
To state a RICO civil claim, a plaintiff must allege "(1) the conduct (2) of an
enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity." Nutrition
Distribution LLC v. Custom Nutraceuticals LLC, 194 F.Supp.3d 952, 957 (D.
Ariz. 2016) Additionally, "the conduct must be (5) the proximate cause of
harm to the victim." Id.
For a RICO conspiracy claim specifically, a plaintiff must "successfully allege
all the elements of a RICO violation, as well as alleging 'the existence of an
illicit agreement to violate the substantive RICO provision.'" Jones v. Tenn.
Dep't of Corr., 3:20-cv-00340 (M.D. Tenn. Jan 18, 2022) ("To plausibly state a
RICO conspiracy claim, 'plaintiffs must successfully allege all the elements

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
of a RICO violation, as well as alleging 'the existence of an illicit agreement
to violate the substantive RICO provision.'")
Importantly, the Supreme Court has established that to prove a RICO
conspiracy, there is no requirement that each defendant "himself committed
or agreed to commit the two predicate acts requisite for a substantive RICO
offense." RICO: A Primer (2022-01-31) Rather, it is sufficient to show that
each defendant "knowingly agreed that a conspirator would commit a
violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c)." Id.
Pattern of Racketeering Activity Requirement
A pattern of racketeering activity requires, at a minimum, two acts of
racketeering activity within ten years of each other. Heinrich v. Waiting
Angels Adoption Servs., Inc., 668 F.3d 393, 409 (6th Cir. 2012) However, the
Supreme Court has clarified that establishing a pattern requires more than
just showing two predicate acts—the plaintiff must also demonstrate both
"relationship" and "continuity." Inc v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Company,
492 U.S. 229 (1989) ("RICO's legislative history, however, establishes that
Congress intended that to prove a 'pattern of racketeering activity' a
plaintiff or prosecutor must show both 'relationship' and 'continuity'—that
the racketeering predicates are related, and that they either constitute or
threaten long-term criminal activity.")
Pleading Standards for RICO Claims
Rule 8(a) Basic Pleading Standard
Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a), "a pleading in a civil action must
contain 'a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is
entitled to relief.'" Wilson v. EverBank, N.A., 77 F. Supp. 3d 1202 (S.D. Fla.
2015) This rule requires that a complaint "provide the defendant fair notice
of what the plaintiff's claim is and the grounds upon which it rests." Id.
Rule 9(b) Heightened Pleading Standard for Fraud
When a RICO claim is based on predicate acts involving fraud, such as mail
or wire fraud, the allegations must satisfy the heightened pleading standard
of Rule 9(b). Ketayi v. Health Enrollment Grp., Corp., 516 F.Supp.3d 1092
(S.D. Cal. 2021) ("A plaintiff must allege facts with the particularity required
by Rule 9(b) for predicate acts involving fraud for civil RICO claims.")
Rule 9(b) requires that "a party must state with particularity the
circumstances constituting fraud or mistake," although "conditions of a
person's mind," such as malice, intent, and knowledge may be alleged
generally. In re Takata Airbag Prods. Liab. Litig., 396 F.Supp.3d 1101 (S.D.
Fla. 2019)
This heightened pleading standard requires plaintiffs to allege:
"The precise statements, documents, or misrepresentations made"
1. 

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
"The time, place, and person responsible for the statement"
"The content and manner in which these statements misled the
Plaintiffs"
"What the defendants gained by the alleged fraud"
Tusha v. Richmond, (M.D. Fla. Dec. 15, 2023)
Similarly, for mail and wire fraud specifically, which are common predicate
acts in RICO claims, courts require the complaint to "state the contents of
the communications, who was involved, where and when they took place,
and explain why they were fraudulent." Odyssey re (London) v. Stirling
Cooke Brown Hold., 85 F.Supp.2d 282 (S.D. N.Y. 2000)
Application to the Present Case
Adequacy of the Complaint's Allegations
The complaint at issue contains detailed allegations that satisfy both the
basic pleading standard of Rule 8(a) and the heightened requirements of
Rule 9(b) for RICO conspiracy claims involving fraud-based predicate acts.
Specific Details Regarding the Scheme
The complaint details a coordinated scheme by Myers, Branthoover, and
Wilson, including specific dates, communications, and actions. It alleges that
Myers and Branthoover exchanged interstate calls and texts, Myers traveled
to Oklahoma to draft false legal documents, Wilson served an eviction notice
based on fabricated grounds, and all defendants used mail and wire
communications in furtherance of their scheme.
These allegations satisfy the requirement to plead "the time, place, and
specific content of the false representations as well as the identities of the
parties to the misrepresentation." Edwards v. Marin Park, Inc., 356 F.3d
1058 (9th Cir. 2004) The complaint has effectively identified the
"who" (Myers, Branthoover, and Wilson), the "what" (the coordinated
fraudulent scheme), the "when" (specific dates from December 2023 through
May 2025), the "where" (including interstate communications and travel to
Oklahoma), and the "how" (through calls, texts, fraudulent legal documents,
and a fabricated eviction notice) of the alleged misconduct.
Enterprise and Pattern of Racketeering Activity
By alleging that the defendants worked together in a coordinated scheme,
using interstate communications and engaging in fraudulent activities over a
period from December 2023 through May 2025, the complaint establishes
both the "enterprise" and "pattern of racketeering activity" elements
required for a RICO claim.
The complaint's allegations of ongoing threats and coordination over this
extended period satisfy the "relationship" and "continuity" requirements
established in Inc v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Company, 492 U.S. 229
(1989). The Supreme Court explained in that case that "to prove a 'pattern
2. 
3. 
4. 

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
of racketeering activity' a plaintiff or prosecutor must show both
'relationship' and 'continuity'—that the racketeering predicates are related,
and that they either constitute or threaten long-term criminal activity."
Predicate Acts of Mail and Wire Fraud
The complaint's allegations regarding interstate calls and texts between
Myers and Branthoover constitute predicate acts of wire fraud under 18
U.S.C. § 1343, which prohibits the transmission of communications in
interstate commerce for the purpose of executing a fraudulent scheme. 18
U.S.C. § 1343
To properly allege mail and wire fraud as predicate acts, a complaint must
show "(1) the existence of a scheme to defraud, (2) the defendant's knowing
or intentional participation in the scheme, and (3) the use of interstate mails
or transmission facilities in furtherance of the scheme." Odyssey re (London)
v. Stirling Cooke Brown Hold., 85 F.Supp.2d 282 (S.D. N.Y. 2000)
The complaint satisfies these requirements by detailing:
The scheme to defraud (coordinated actions to draft false legal
documents and serve an eviction notice based on fabricated grounds)
Each defendant's knowing participation (specifying their individual
roles)
The use of interstate communications (calls and texts between Myers
and Branthoover, as well as mail and wire communications by all
defendants)
Agreement to Violate RICO
The complaint also adequately alleges the "illicit agreement" necessary for a
RICO conspiracy claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d). As noted in Jones v. Tenn.
Dep't of Corr., 3:20-cv-00340 (M.D. Tenn. Jan 18, 2022), a RICO conspiracy
claim requires allegations of "the existence of an illicit agreement to violate
the substantive RICO provision."
The detailed allegations of coordination between the defendants, including
their communications and specified roles in the scheme, support the
inference of an agreement to engage in a pattern of racketeering activity. As
explained in RICO: A Primer (2022-01-31), a RICO conspiracy does not
require each defendant to have personally committed or agreed to commit
two predicate acts. Rather, it is sufficient to show that "each defendant
knowingly agreed that a conspirator would commit a violation of 18 U.S.C. §
1962(c)."
Compliance with Rule 9(b)'s Particularity Requirement
Courts have consistently emphasized that for RICO claims based on fraud,
"the complaint must: (1) specify the statements that the plaintiff contends
were fraudulent, (2) identify the speaker, (3) state where and when the
statements were made, and (4) explain why the statements were
1. 
2.

fraudulent." Am. Fed'n of State & Municipal Emp. Dist. Council 37 Health &
Sec. Plan v. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., 948 F.Supp.2d 338 (S.D. N.Y. 2013)
The complaint in this case meets these requirements by:
Specifying the fraudulent statements (the content of communications
between defendants)
Identifying the speakers (Myers, Branthoover, and Wilson)
Stating where and when the statements were made (specific dates from
December 2023 through May 2025)
Explaining why the statements were fraudulent (as part of a scheme
involving false legal documents and fabricated grounds for eviction)
In VAN DORN CO., CENT. STATES CAN. CO. v. Howington, 623 F.Supp. 1548
(N.D. Ohio 1985), the court stated that when alleging wire and mail fraud as
predicate acts, a claimant must, pursuant to Rule 9(b), describe "such
matters as the time, place and content of false representations, as well as
the identity of the person making the misrepresentation and what was
obtained or given up thereby."
Similarly, in Wilson v. Askew, 709 F.Supp. 146 (W.D. Ark. 1989), the court
emphasized that RICO complaints must set forth "the dates, content, and the
'actors' involved in sufficient acts of mail or wire fraud to satisfy the RICO
statutes" as well as "the role such communication played in the overall
schemes."
The complaint in this case, with its detailed chronology, identification of
participants, specific communications, and description of each defendant's
role and actions, satisfies these requirements.
Comparative Case Analysis
Cases Supporting Sufficiency of the Pleadings
In Tryco Trucking Co. v. Belk Store Services, Inc., 608 F.Supp. 812 (W.D.
N.C. 1985), the court found that a complaint that "identifies the
transactions, the fraudulent representations, the material concealments, the
parties' identity, and their intent alleges with the requisite specificity several
fraudulent schemes." This supports the conclusion that the complaint in the
present case, with its detailed allegations, meets the pleading requirements
for a RICO claim.
Similarly, the court in Tusha v. Richmond, (M.D. Fla. Dec. 15, 2023) outlined
that a plaintiff establishes a RICO conspiracy claim by showing either that
"the defendant agreed to the overall objective of the conspiracy" or that "the
defendant agreed to commit two predicate acts." The detailed allegations of
coordination and specific actions by each defendant in the present case
support the inference of such an agreement.

Cases Finding Insufficient Pleadings (Distinguished)
In contrast to the present case, the court in Wilson v. Askew, 709 F.Supp.
146 (W.D. Ark. 1989) found that "conclusory allegations" of wire and mail
fraud "have repeatedly been held to be insufficient in RICO cases." The court
required the plaintiff to "amend the complaint setting forth the dates,
content, and the 'actors' involved in sufficient acts of mail or wire fraud."
Unlike the complaint at issue in Wilson v. Askew, the present complaint does
not rely on conclusory allegations but provides specific details about the
dates, content of communications, and the roles of each defendant in the
fraudulent scheme.
Similarly, in Bieganek v. Wilson, 642 F.Supp. 768 (N.D. Ill. 1986), the court
found that a RICO claim was "not pled with enough detail" because it failed
to "sketch out both the scheme to defraud and how the mail or wires
furthered that scheme." The court required the plaintiff to "identify the
mailings and the role they played in the fraud."
It should be noted that Bieganek v. Wilson, 642 F.Supp. 768 (N.D. Ill. 1986)
was stated as vacated by Khalid Bin Alwaleed Foundation v. EF Hutton &
Co., Inc., 709 F. Supp. 815 (N.D. Ill. 1989). However, even if we were to
consider the reasoning in Bieganek, the present complaint would be
distinguishable because it specifically details how the interstate calls, texts,
and other communications furthered the defendants' fraudulent scheme.
Legal Principles Applied to the Case
Pattern of Racketeering Activity
The complaint's allegations of ongoing threats and coordination documented
through specific text messages and events from December 2023 through
May 2025 establish a pattern of racketeering activity that satisfies both the
"relationship" and "continuity" requirements established by the Supreme
Court in Inc v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Company, 492 U.S. 229 (1989).
The temporal scope of the alleged activities (spanning from December 2023
to May 2025) demonstrates continuity, while the coordinated nature of the
defendants' actions shows relationship between the predicate acts. This is
sufficient to establish a pattern of racketeering activity as required for a
RICO claim.
Interstate Commerce Connection
The complaint's allegations regarding interstate calls and texts between
Myers and Branthoover, as well as Myers' travel to Oklahoma to draft false
legal documents, establish the necessary connection to interstate commerce
required for a RICO claim. As noted in RICO: A Primer (2022-01-31), one of
the elements that must be proven for a RICO conspiracy violation is that
"the enterprise was (or would be) engaged in, or its activities affected (or
would affect), interstate or foreign commerce."

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Fraud-Based Predicate Acts
The complaint's detailed allegations about the defendants' use of mail and
wire communications in furtherance of their fraudulent scheme establish the
predicate acts necessary for a RICO claim. As explained in Fraud and
Misrepresentation (2014-01-01), "a RICO violation alleging mail or wire
fraud as a predicate requires proof of a scheme to defraud and use of the
mails (or other interstate communications media) in furtherance of the
scheme."
The complaint in this case provides specific details about the defendants'
use of interstate calls, texts, and other communications, as well as their
roles in creating and using false legal documents, which satisfies the
requirement to show "a scheme to defraud" and "use of the mails (or other
interstate communications media) in furtherance of the scheme."
Conclusion
The complaint's detailed allegations regarding the coordinated scheme
between Myers, Branthoover, and Wilson, including specific dates,
communications, actions, and the roles of each defendant, satisfy both the
basic pleading requirements of Rule 8(a) and the heightened particularity
standards of Rule 9(b) for RICO conspiracy claims under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d)
involving fraud-based predicate acts.
The complaint effectively establishes all the necessary elements for a RICO
conspiracy claim:
The existence of an enterprise (the coordinated group of defendants)
A pattern of racketeering activity (ongoing coordinated actions from
December 2023 through May 2025)
Predicate acts (mail and wire fraud through interstate communications)
An agreement among the defendants to participate in the scheme
The specific role of each defendant in the fraudulent activities
By providing detailed information about the "who, what, when, where, and
how" of the alleged misconduct, the complaint meets the heightened
pleading requirements for fraud-based RICO claims as established in cases
like Am. Fed'n of State & Municipal Emp. Dist. Council 37 Health & Sec.
Plan v. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., 948 F.Supp.2d 338 (S.D. N.Y. 2013) and 
Odyssey re (London) v. Stirling Cooke Brown Hold., 85 F.Supp.2d 282 (S.D.
N.Y. 2000).
The level of detail in the complaint—including the specific dates of
communications, the content of those communications, the travel to
Oklahoma, the drafting of false legal documents, the service of an eviction
notice based on fabricated grounds, and the distinct roles of each defendant
—provides the defendants with fair notice of the claims against them while
satisfying the particularity requirements for allegations of fraud.
As established in Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy (2024-01-01), "the
practitioner through their pleadings must articulate with great care and
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
5. 

=== PAGE 9 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
attention a viable racketeering claim." The complaint in this case has done
exactly that, providing a detailed and particularized account of the alleged
RICO conspiracy that satisfies the applicable pleading standards.
Legal Authorities
Wilson v. Askew, 709 F.Supp. 146 (W.D. Ark. 1989)
U.S. District Court — Western District of Arkansas
Extract
Notwithstanding that it is possible for plaintiff to replead the RICO
allegations to satisfy the 'continuity' prong, plaintiff's allegations are
woefully deficient under Rule 9(b). Rule 9(b), which requires that fraud be
pleaded with particularity, applies to the pleading of RICO predicate acts.
See Flowers v. Continental Grain Co., 775 F.2d 1051 (8th Cir.1985). Plaintiff
has pled that wire fraud and mail fraud were committed in furtherance of
the scheme of which he was a victim on numerous occasions between 1969
and 1988. Such conclusory allegations have repeatedly been held to be
insufficient in RICO cases. See Van Dorn v. Howington, 623 F.Supp. 1548
(N.D.Ohio 1985); Bieganek v. Wilson, 642 F.Supp. 768 (N.D.Ill.1986). This is
more so true where it is the plaintiff who is the recipient of the mail or wire
communications. Plaintiff is directed to amend the complaint setting forth
the dates, content, and the 'actors' involved in sufficient acts of mail or wire
fraud to satisfy the RICO statutes within 30 days of the filing of this opinion
or the RICO claims will be subject to dismissal. Further, the amended
complaint should set forth the role such communication played in the overall
schemes.
Summary
The court emphasizes the necessity for a RICO complaint to plead fraud with
particularity, as required by Rule 9(b). This includes detailing the dates,
content, and participants involved in the fraudulent acts, as well as the role
of each communication in the overall scheme. This aligns with the
proposition's assertion that the complaint provides a detailed chronology,
identification of participants, specific communications, and description of
each defendant’s role and actions, meeting the heightened pleading
requirements for RICO conspiracy and fraud-based predicate acts.

Extract
RICO claims based on mail and wire fraud are subject to the heightened
pleading standard established by Rule 9(b), which provides that '[i]n
alleging fraud or mistake, a party must state with particularity the
circumstances constituting fraud or mistake.' See McLaughlin v. Anderson,
962 F.2d 187, 191 (2d Cir.1992) (noting that Rule 9(b)'s heightened pleading
standard applies where mail fraud is alleged as a RICO predicate offense).
'[T]o comply with Rule 9(b), ‘the complaint must: (1) specify the statements
that the plaintiff contends were fraudulent, (2) identify the speaker, (3) state
where and when the statements were made, and (4) explain why the
statements were fraudulent.’
Summary
For a RICO claim involving mail and wire fraud, the complaint must meet
the heightened pleading standard of Rule 9(b). This requires specifying the
fraudulent statements, identifying the speaker, stating when and where the
statements were made, and explaining why they were fraudulent. The
proposition claims that the complaint provides detailed information about
the fraudulent scheme, including specific communications and actions by
the defendants, which aligns with the requirements outlined in the passage.

U.S. District Court — Southern District of New York
Extract
A complaint alleging mail and wire fraud must show (1) the existence of a
scheme to defraud, (2) the defendant's knowing or intentional participation
in the scheme, and (3) the use of interstate mails or transmission facilities in
furtherance of the scheme. ... any alleged predicate acts involving fraud
must be pled with the same specificity required by Rule 9(b). ...
'[A]llegations of predicate mail and wire fraud acts should state the contents
of the communications, who was involved, where and when they took place,
and explain why they were fraudulent.'
Summary
For a RICO claim involving mail and wire fraud, the complaint must detail
the scheme to defraud, the defendant's participation, and the use of mail or
wire communications. The allegations must be specific, detailing the
contents, participants, timing, and fraudulent nature of the communications.
This aligns with the proposition's requirement for detailed allegations in a
RICO conspiracy claim.

Wilson v. EverBank, N.A., 77 F. Supp. 3d 1202 (S.D. Fla. 2015)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of Florida
Extract
A pleading in a civil action must contain “a short and plain statement of the
claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.” Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2). To
satisfy the Rule 8 pleading requirements, a complaint must provide the
defendant fair notice of what the plaintiff's claim is and the grounds upon
which it rests... To state a civil RICO claim, a plaintiff must sufficiently allege
“(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity.”... Because Plaintiffs' RICO claims are predicated on allegations of
fraud, their allegations must satisfy the heightened pleading requirement of
Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b) and allege: “(1) the precise statements, documents, or
misrepresentations made; (2) the time, place, and person responsible for the
statement; (3) the content and manner in which these statements misled the
Plaintiffs; and (4) what the defendants gained by the alleged fraud.”
Summary
Requirements for pleading a civil RICO claim, emphasizing the need for a
complaint to provide fair notice of the claim and the grounds upon which it
rests, as per Rule 8(a). It also highlights the necessity of meeting the
heightened pleading standard of Rule 9(b) for fraud-based predicate acts,
requiring specific details about the fraudulent conduct. This aligns with the
proposition's assertion that the complaint must detail the who, what, when,
where, and how of the alleged misconduct to meet these standards.

U.S. District Court — Southern District of California
Extract
The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provide a heightened pleading
standard for complaints alleging fraud. Under Rule 9(b), a complaint must
state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud. Fed. R. Civ. P.
9(b). Malice, intent, knowledge, and other conditions of a person's mind may
be alleged generally. Id. To satisfy this heightened pleading requirement, the
plaintiff must set forth 'the time, place, and specific content of the false
representations as well as the identities of the parties to the
misrepresentation.' ... A plaintiff must allege facts with the particularity
required by Rule 9(b) for predicate acts involving fraud for civil RICO
claims. Edwards v. Marin Park. Inc., 356 F.3d 1058, 1065–66 (9th Cir. 2004).

Summary
Requirements under Rule 9(b) for pleading fraud with particularity, which is
directly relevant to the proposition that the complaint must allege the
circumstances of fraud with specificity. It also confirms that for RICO claims
involving fraud, the same heightened pleading standard applies. This
supports the proposition that the complaint in question meets these
requirements by detailing the specific actions, communications, and roles of
the defendants.
In re Takata Airbag Prods. Liab. Litig., 396 F.Supp.3d 1101 (S.D. Fla. 2019)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of Florida
Extract
Where a cause of action sounds in fraud, however, Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 9(b) must be satisfied in addition to the more relaxed standard of
Rule 8. Under Rule 9(b), 'a party must state with particularity the
circumstances constituting fraud or mistake,' although 'conditions of a
person's mind,' such as malice, intent, and knowledge may be alleged
generally. Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b). 'The ‘particularity’ requirement serves an
important purpose in fraud actions by alerting defendants to the ‘precise
misconduct with which they are charged’ and protecting defendants ‘against
spurious charges of immoral and fraudulent behavior.' ... As the Eleventh
Circuit has explained, because 'fair notice' is perhaps the most basic
consideration underlying Rule 9(b), plaintiffs who plead fraud 'must
reasonably notify the defendants of their purported role in the scheme.'
Brooks, 116 F.3d at 1381 (internal citations and quotations omitted). This
means that in a case involving multiple defendants, 'the complaint should
inform each defendant of the nature of his alleged participation in the
fraud.'
Summary
Rule 9(b) requires fraud allegations to be stated with particularity, which
includes detailing the specific misconduct and the role of each defendant.
This aligns with the proposition that the complaint must provide a detailed
chronology, identification of participants, and specific communications to
meet the heightened pleading requirements for RICO conspiracy and fraud-
based predicate acts. The passage also emphasizes the importance of
notifying defendants of their roles in the alleged scheme, which supports the
need for detailed allegations as described in the proposition.

(N.D. Ohio 1985)
U.S. District Court — Northern District of Ohio

=== PAGE 13 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
When alleging wire and mail fraud as predicate acts of racketeering, a
claimant must, pursuant to Rule 9(b), describe with particularity the
circumstances constituting the fraud. The Eighth Circuit described these
circumstances in a RICO action to, at a minimum, 'include such matters as
the time, place and content of false representations, as well as the identity
of the person making the misrepresentation and what was obtained or given
up thereby.' Bennett v. Berg, supra 685 F.2d at 1063.
Summary
The passage emphasizes the necessity of particularity in pleading fraud-
based predicate acts under RICO, specifically wire and mail fraud. It aligns
with the proposition's requirement that the complaint must detail the "who,
what, when, where, and how" of the alleged misconduct. The passage
supports the proposition by confirming that the complaint's detailed
chronology, identification of participants, and specific communications meet
the heightened pleading requirements for RICO conspiracy and fraud-based
predicate acts.
Bieganek v. Wilson, 642 F.Supp. 768 (N.D. Ill. 1986)
U.S. District Court — Northern District of Illinois
Extract
Only Count VI (RICO) is not pled with enough detail. A RICO claim
predicated on mail or wire fraud must sketch out both the scheme to
defraud and how the mail or wires furthered that scheme. See, e.g., Ghouth,
642 F.Supp. at 1331; Dunham v. Independence Bank of Chicago, 629 F.Supp.
983, 986 (N.D.Ill.1986). A plaintiff must identify the mailings and the role
they played in the fraud. See, e.g., Ghouth, 642 F.Supp. at 1331; Harris
Trust & Savings Bank v. Ellis, 609 F.Supp. 1118, 1123 (N.D.Ill.1985) (Aspen,
J.) (plaintiff must sketch who caused what to be mailed when, and how the
mailing furthered the scheme).
Summary
Necessity for a RICO claim to detail the scheme to defraud and the role of
mail or wire communications in furthering that scheme. It emphasizes the
need for specificity in identifying the mailings and their role in the fraud,
aligning with the proposition's requirement for detailed allegations in a
RICO conspiracy claim.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
RICO's legislative history, however, establishes that Congress intended that
to prove a 'pattern of racketeering activity' a plaintiff or prosecutor must
show both 'relationship' and 'continuity'—that the racketeering predicates
are related, and that they either constitute or threaten long-term criminal
activity. ... RICO renders criminally and civilly liable 'any person' who uses
or invests income derived 'from a pattern of racketeering activity' to acquire
an interest in or to operate an enterprise engaged in interstate commerce, §
1962(a); who acquires or maintains an interest in or control of such an
enterprise 'through a pattern of racketeering activity,' § 1962(b); who, being
employed by or associated with such an enterprise, conducts or participates
in the conduct of its affairs 'through a pattern of racketeering activity,' §
1962(c); or, finally, who conspires to violate the first three subsections of §
1962, § 1962(d).
Summary
The RICO statute requires showing both a relationship and continuity in
racketeering activities to establish a pattern. The passage also clarifies that
RICO applies to any person involved in a pattern of racketeering activity,
including those who conspire to violate the statute. This supports the
proposition by highlighting the necessity of demonstrating a coordinated
scheme with specific actions and communications, as detailed in the
complaint, to meet the RICO requirements.
Tusha v. Richmond
U.S. District Court — Middle District of Florida
Extract
A plaintiff establishes a RICO conspiracy claim “(1) by showing that the
defendant agreed to the overall objective of the conspiracy; or (2) by
showing that the defendant agreed to commit two predicate acts.”
Additionally, when the underlying racketeering activity involves fraud, the
plaintiff must satisfy Rule 9(b)&#39;s heightened pleading requirements. In
this context, Rule 9(b) requires Plaintiffs to allege: “(1) the precise
statements, documents, or misrepresentations made; (2) the time, place, and
person responsible for the statement; (3) the content and manner in which
these statements mislead the Plaintiffs; and (4) what the defendants gained
by the alleged fraud.”
Summary
Requirements for establishing a RICO conspiracy claim, specifically under
18 U.S.C. § 1962(d). It emphasizes the need for a plaintiff to show either an

=== PAGE 15 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
agreement to the overall objective of the conspiracy or an agreement to
commit two predicate acts. Furthermore, it highlights the necessity of
meeting Rule 9(b)'s heightened pleading standards when fraud is involved,
requiring detailed allegations about the fraudulent acts. This directly
supports the proposition that the complaint must provide specific details
about the conspiracy, including the roles and actions of each defendant, to
meet these legal standards.
Nutrition Distribution LLC v. Custom Nutraceuticals LLC, 194 F.Supp.3d 952
(D. Ariz. 2016)
U.S. District Court — District of Arizona
Extract
To state a RICO civil claim, a plaintiff must allege '(1) the conduct (2) of an
enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity.' Eclectic Props.
E., LLC v. Marcus & Millichap Co., 751 F.3d 990, 997 (9th Cir.2014) (citation
omitted). 'In addition, the conduct must be (5) the proximate cause of harm
to the victim.' Id. (citation omitted). Pleading a pattern of racketeering
activity requires the plaintiff to allege that the defendant participated in at
least two acts that were chargeable under the enumerated federal statutes.
The plaintiff must adequately plead the elements of each predicate act,
satisfying the pleading standard that would apply if the predicate act were a
stand-alone claim. See Alan Neuman Prods., Inc. v. Albright, 862 F.2d 1388,
1392 (9th Cir.1988) (complaint failed to state a RICO claim because it failed
to adequately plead the elements of the predicate act; where predicate act is
mail or wire fraud, complaint must plead the elements of this offense with
the level of particularity required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) ).
Summary
Requirements for stating a RICO civil claim, emphasizing the need to allege
a pattern of racketeering activity with particularity, especially when fraud is
involved. This aligns with the proposition's assertion that the complaint must
meet heightened pleading standards under Rule 9(b) for fraud-based
predicate acts. The passage supports the proposition by confirming that
detailed allegations, including specific communications and roles of
defendants, are necessary to satisfy RICO's pleading requirements.

Summary
Necessary elements to state a RICO claim, which includes conduct, an
enterprise, a pattern, and racketeering activity. It also specifies that for a
RICO conspiracy claim, there must be an allegation of an illicit agreement to
violate the RICO provision. This supports the proposition by confirming that
the detailed allegations in the complaint regarding the coordinated scheme,
specific communications, and roles of each defendant are necessary to meet
the pleading requirements for a RICO conspiracy claim.
ESTATE OF DEARING BY DEARING v. Dearing, 646 F.Supp. 903 (S.D. W.Va.
1986)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of West Virginia
Extract
The problem with the Plaintiffs' complaint — and the Defendants implicitly
argue this point — is that it does not plead fraud with the particularity
required under Rule 9(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The
requirement of that rule applies to fraud allegations in civil RICO claims.
Haroco, Inc. v. American National Bank & Trust Co. of Chicago, 747 F.2d

Summary
The passage highlights the necessity for a complaint alleging fraud in a civil
RICO claim to meet the particularity requirements of Rule 9(b). This aligns
with the proposition that the complaint must detail the circumstances of the
fraud, including the who, what, when, where, and how. The passage
supports the proposition by emphasizing the importance of particularity in
fraud allegations within RICO claims.

Extract
The plaintiffs challenge the dismissal of their RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. §
1962(c), which provides: It shall be unlawful for any person employed by or
associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect,
interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or
indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of
racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt. ... To establish a
substantive RICO violation, a plaintiff must show “a pattern of racketeering
activity.” 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). A pattern of racketeering activity requires, at
minimum, two acts of racketeering activity within ten years of each other. 18
U.S.C. § 1961(5). ... The plaintiffs also challenge the dismissal of their RICO
conspiracy claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d). To plausibly state a claim for a
violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d), plaintiffs must successfully allege all the
elements of a RICO violation, as well as alleging “the existence of an illicit
agreement to violate the substantive RICO provision.” United States v.
Sinito, 723 F.2d 1250, 1260 (6th Cir.1983). “An agreement can be shown if
the defendant objectively manifested an agreement to participate directly or
indirectly in the affairs of an enterprise through the commission of two or
more predicate crimes.”
Summary
Requirements for establishing a RICO violation under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c)
and a RICO conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d). It emphasizes the need for
a pattern of racketeering activity and the existence of an illicit agreement.

demonstrating a pattern of racketeering activity and an agreement among
the defendants, which aligns with the detailed allegations of coordinated
actions and communications in the complaint.
Haroco, Inc. v. American Nat. Bank and Trust Co. of Chicago, 747 F.2d 384
(7th Cir. 1984)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Seventh Circuit
Extract
A private civil action under RICO is grounded upon the premise that a party
has twice engaged in 'racketeering activity.' The Act defines 'racketeering
activity' as behavior 'indictable' under specified provisions of the United
States Code. Before a court can assess the merit of a plaintiff's treble
damages claim it must determine whether there is probable cause to believe
the named defendant committed the alleged predicate crimes. That
determination is possible only if the factual basis of those 'acts of
racketeering' is set out with particularity. Thus, a factual statement similar
to a bill of particulars is needed in pleadings that allege a violation of the
RICO treble damages provision.

Summary
The passage emphasizes the necessity for a RICO claim to be grounded on
the premise of engaging in "racketeering activity" and that the factual basis
of these acts must be set out with particularity. This aligns with the
proposition's requirement for detailed allegations in a RICO conspiracy
claim, including specific dates, communications, and actions, to meet the
heightened pleading standards under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 8(a)
and 9(b).
18 U.S.C. § 1962 18 U.S.C. § 1962 Prohibited Activities
Extract
It shall be unlawful for any person to conspire to violate any of the
provisions of subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section.
Summary
The passage from 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d) explicitly states that it is unlawful for
any person to conspire to violate the provisions of subsections (a), (b), or (c).
This directly supports the proposition that a RICO conspiracy claim can be
made if there is a coordinated scheme involving multiple parties, as
described in the complaint. The detailed actions and communications of
Myers, Branthoover, and Wilson, as outlined in the proposition, align with
the concept of a conspiracy to engage in racketeering activity, which is
prohibited under this statute.
18 U.S.C. § 1343 18 U.S.C. § 1343 Fraud By Wire, Radio, Or Television
Extract
Whoever, having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to
defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent
pretenses, representations, or promises, transmits or causes to be

interstate or foreign commerce, any writings, signs, signals, pictures, or
sounds for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice, shall be fined
under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both.
Summary
The passage from 18 U.S.C. § 1343 outlines the federal crime of wire fraud,
which involves using wire communications in interstate or foreign commerce
to execute a scheme to defraud. This is directly relevant to the proposition
because the complaint alleges that Myers, Branthoover, and Wilson used
interstate wire communications (calls and texts) as part of their fraudulent

scheme. The passage supports the claim that such actions can constitute a
predicate act of wire fraud under RICO, which is necessary for establishing a
RICO conspiracy claim.
Fraud and Misrepresentation
Business Torts and Unfair Competition Handbook - American Bar
Association - 2014-01-01
Extract
A fraud claim under RICO differs from a state common law fraud claim. To
prove fraud amounting to a RICO violation, there must be an enterprise, an
effect upon interstate commerce, and two predicate offenses. When
predicate acts such as mail or wire fraud are relied upon to establish the
requisite pattern of racketeering activity, the elements of those offenses
must be shown in addition to the other elements of a RICO claim. Generally,
a RICO violation alleging mail or wire fraud as a predicate requires proof of
a scheme to defraud and use of the mails (or other interstate
communications media) in furtherance of the scheme. Mail fraud ‘requires
proof of a specific intent to defraud or deceive.’
Summary
Requirements for establishing a RICO violation based on fraud, specifically
highlighting the need for an enterprise, an effect on interstate commerce,
and two predicate offenses. It emphasizes the necessity of proving a scheme
to defraud and the use of mail or wire communications in furtherance of that
scheme, which aligns with the proposition's description of the coordinated
actions and communications among the defendants. The passage also
underscores the requirement of specific intent to defraud, which is relevant
to the detailed allegations in the complaint.
Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy
The Brief - American Bar Association - 2024-01-01
Extract
A RICO-based complaint must be drafted with the following instructions
from Sedima as a guide. A violation of § 1962(c), the section on which
Sedima relies, requires (1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern
(4) of racketeering activity. The plaintiff must allege each of the elements to
state a claim. They are all equally essential components, and the complaint
will fail if any one of them is not adequately pleaded. In particular, RICO
claims based on mail or wire fraud must comport with Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 9(b)’s requirement that allegations involving fraud be pleaded

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
with particularity. The practitioner through their pleadings must articulate
with great care and attention a viable racketeering claim.
Summary
Essential elements required to establish a RICO claim under § 1962(c),
emphasizing the need for particularity in pleading fraud-based predicate
acts, as required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b). This aligns with
the proposition's assertion that the complaint must detail the specific
actions, communications, and roles of the defendants to meet the
heightened pleading requirements for RICO conspiracy and fraud-based
predicate acts.
RICO: A Primer
Extract
Under Section 1962(d), it is a violation to conspire to commit any of the
three substantive RICO offenses. To prove a violation of Section 1962(d), a
plaintiff must prove the following elements: * The existence of an enterprise
(or that an enterprise would exist); * That the enterprise was (or would be)
engaged in, or its activities affected (or would affect), interstate or foreign
commerce; and * That each defendant knowingly agreed that a conspirator
would commit a violation of 18 U.S.C. ' 1962(c). The Supreme Court held
that to establish a RICO conspiracy offense under Section 1962(d), there is
no requirement that the defendant 'himself committed or agreed to commit
the two predicate acts requisite for a substantive RICO offense under '
1962(c).'
Summary
Elements required to establish a RICO conspiracy under Section 1962(d),
which aligns with the proposition's claim that the complaint must detail the
conspiracy and the roles of each defendant. The passage confirms that a
RICO conspiracy does not require each defendant to commit the predicate
acts themselves, which supports the proposition's emphasis on detailing the
coordination and agreement among the defendants. The requirement for the
enterprise to affect interstate commerce is also relevant, as the proposition
mentions interstate communications and actions.

would commit a violation of 18 U.S.C. ' 1962(c). The Supreme Court held
that to establish a RICO conspiracy offense under Section 1962(d), there is
no requirement that the defendant 'himself committed or agreed to commit
the two predicate acts requisite for a substantive RICO offense under '
1962(c).
Summary
To establish a RICO conspiracy under Section 1962(d), it is sufficient to
show that the defendants knowingly agreed that a conspirator would commit
a violation of Section 1962(c). This aligns with the proposition that the
complaint details a coordinated scheme involving specific actions and
communications among the defendants, which could demonstrate such an
agreement. The passage supports the notion that the detailed allegations in
the complaint, including the roles and actions of each defendant, meet the
requirements for pleading a RICO conspiracy.
