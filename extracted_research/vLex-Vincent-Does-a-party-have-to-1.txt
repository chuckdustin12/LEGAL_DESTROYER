Question
Does a party have to set a Rule 12 motion for a hearing to burden the attorney with proving their authority?
Answer (Texas)
Short response
Yes, under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 12, a party must set a Rule 12 motion for a hearing to burden the challenged attorney with proving their authority. The
explicit language of Rule 12 and consistent case law interpretation establish that the burden of proof shifts to the challenged attorney specifically "at the hearing
on the motion."
Summary
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 12 provides a mechanism for a party to challenge an attorney's authority to prosecute or defend a lawsuit by filing a sworn written
motion. Based on the consistent interpretation provided in numerous Texas court decisions, setting a hearing on this motion is a necessary procedural step to
shift the burden of proof to the challenged attorney.
The case law demonstrates that the hearing requirement is not merely procedural formality but serves a substantive purpose. It is specifically at this hearing that
the challenged attorney bears the burden to demonstrate their authority to represent their client. The Rule 12 process involves several key components: filing a
sworn written motion, providing notice to the challenged attorney at least ten days before the hearing, conducting the hearing before the parties announce ready
for trial, and placing the burden of proof on the challenged attorney during that hearing to demonstrate their authority to act on behalf of their client.
Background and Relevant Law
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 12: Attorney to Show Authority
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 12 establishes the procedural framework for challenging an attorney's authority to represent a client in a legal proceeding. The rule
has been consistently cited and interpreted across numerous Texas court decisions spanning several decades.
The rule provides that "a party in a suit or proceeding pending in a court of this state may, by sworn written motion stating that he believes the suit or proceeding
is being prosecuted or defended without authority, cause the attorney to be cited to appear before the court and show his authority to act." Catt v. Middleton, 698
S.W.3d 66 (Tex. App. 2024) ("Rule 12, titled 'Attorney to Show Authority,' provides, in pertinent part: A party in a suit or proceeding pending in a court of this state
may, by sworn written motion stating that he believes the suit or proceeding is being prosecuted or defended without authority, cause the attorney to be cited to
appear before the court and show his authority to act....").
This rule has been deemed the "exclusive method for questioning the authority of an attorney to bring a suit." Phillips v. Phillips, 244 S.W.3d 433 (Tex. App. 2007)
("Rule 12 has long been the exclusive method for questioning the authority of an attorney to bring a suit. Angelina County v. McFarland, 374 S.W.2d 417, 423
(Tex. 1964).").
Notice Requirements
Rule 12 includes specific notice requirements: "The notice of the motion shall be served upon the challenged attorney at least ten days before the hearing on the
motion." Benit v. Primalend Capital Partners, LP, 05-21-00024-CV (Tex. App. May 06, 2022) ("Rule 12 motions must be sworn and served on the challenged
attorney at least 10 days before the hearing on the motion.").
This ten-day notice requirement is consistently emphasized across cases. Nolana Open MRI Ctr., Inc. v. Pechero, NUMBER 13-13-00552-CV (Tex. App. Feb 12,
2015) ("The notice of the motion shall be served upon the challenged attorney at least ten days before the hearing on the motion.").
Timing Requirements
The Rule 12 motion must be filed and heard before the parties announce ready for trial. Barker v. Mason Bancshares, Inc., No. 04-20-00301-CV (Tex. App. Jul
14, 2021) ("'The motion may be heard and determined at any time before the parties have announced ready for trial.' Id.").
Similarly, In re Benavides, 403 S.W.3d 370 (Tex. App. 2013) confirms this timing requirement: "The motion may be heard and determined at any time before the
parties have announced ready for trial. Tex.R. Civ. P. 12."
A failure to follow Rule 12's requirements results in waiver of the right to challenge an attorney's authority. Pratt v. State, 13-22-00030-CV (Tex. App. Apr 27,
2023) ("Failing to follow Rule 12 results in waiver. Kindle, 151 S.W.3d at 210 (overruling an appellant's challenge to an attorney's authority because no such
challenge was brought during trial phase).").
Analysis
Necessity of a Hearing to Shift the Burden of Proof
The central question is whether a party must set a Rule 12 motion for a hearing to burden the attorney with proving their authority. The case law consistently and
unequivocally establishes that a hearing is indeed required for this purpose.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
The most direct statement of this requirement comes from Catt v. Middleton, 698 S.W.3d 66 (Tex. App. 2024): "At the hearing on the motion, the burden of proof
shall be upon the challenged attorney to show sufficient authority to prosecute or defend the suit on behalf of the other party."
Multiple Texas court decisions have reinforced this interpretation:
Benit v. Primalend Capital Partners, LP, 05-21-00024-CV (Tex. App. May 06, 2022) states: "The challenged attorney has the burden of proof to show sufficient
authority to represent the client." This case further explains that if the challenged attorney fails to meet this burden during the hearing, the court must bar the
attorney from appearing in the case and strike the pleadings if no authorized person appears.
Barker v. Mason Bancshares, Inc., No. 04-20-00301-CV (Tex. App. Jul 14, 2021) explicitly notes: "At the hearing on the motion, the burden of proof is on the
challenged attorney to show his authority to prosecute or defend the suit." This case draws a direct connection between the hearing and the shifting of the burden
of proof.
Transamerica Corp. v. Braes Woods Condo Ass'n Inc., NO. 14-16-00880-CV (Tex. App. Apr 24, 2018) elaborates: "At the hearing on the motion, the challenged
attorney bears the burden of proof to show the requisite authority."
Nicholas v. Envtl. Sys. (Int'l) Ltd., 499 S.W.3d 888 (Tex. App. 2016) quotes directly from Rule 12: "At the hearing on the motion, the burden of proof shall be upon
the challenged attorney to show sufficient authority to prosecute or defend the suit on behalf of the other party."
Required Appearance Before the Court
Not only must a hearing be set, but the challenged attorney must physically appear before the court to demonstrate their authority:
Nolana Open MRI Ctr., Inc. v. Pechero, NUMBER 13-13-00552-CV (Tex. App. Feb 12, 2015) states: "The challenged attorney must appear before the trial court
to show his authority to act on behalf of his client. TEX. R. CIV. P. 12; R.H. v. Smith, 339 S.W.3d 756, 762 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2011, no pet.); Boudreau v. Fed.
Trust Bank, 115 S.W.3d 740, 741 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2003, pet. denied)."
In re Benavides, 403 S.W.3d 370 (Tex. App. 2013) confirms: "When a party files a rule 12 motion to show authority, the challenged attorney must appear before
the trial court to show his authority to act on behalf of his client."
Boudreau v. Federal Trust Bank, 115 S.W.3d 740 (Tex. App. 2003) likewise explains: "The challenged attorney must appear before the court and show his
authority to act."
Procedural Sequence and Purpose
The case law establishes a clear procedural sequence for Rule 12 motions:
1. A party files a sworn written motion challenging an attorney's authority.
2. Notice of the motion is served on the challenged attorney at least ten days before the hearing.
3. A hearing is held before the parties announce ready for trial.
4. At the hearing, the burden of proof shifts to the challenged attorney to demonstrate their authority.
5. If the attorney fails to meet this burden, the court must bar them from appearing and strike pleadings if no authorized person appears.
R.H. v. Smith, 339 S.W.3d 756 (Tex. App. 2011) outlines this procedure: "Rule 12 provides that a party may file a sworn motion stating that the party believes the
suit or proceeding is being prosecuted or defended without authority and cause the challenged attorney to appear before the court to show his authority to act on
behalf of the other party... At the hearing on the motion, the burden of proof is on the challenged attorney to show his authority to prosecute or defend the suit."
The primary purpose of Rule 12, as noted in Benit v. Primalend Capital Partners, LP, 05-21-00024-CV (Tex. App. May 06, 2022), "is to enforce a party's right to
know who authorized the suit."
Historical Consistency
The requirement for a hearing has been consistently interpreted by Texas courts over several decades:
Sloan v. Rivers, 693 S.W.2d 782 (Tex. App. 1985) explained: "At the hearing on the motion, the burden of proof shall be upon the challenged attorney to show
sufficient authority to prosecute or defend the suit on behalf of the other party."
City of San Antonio v. Aguilar, 670 S.W.2d 681 (Tex. App. 1984) stated: "At the hearing the burden is upon the challenged attorney to show sufficient authority to
prosecute or defend the suit on behalf of the other party."
Fulcher v. Texas State Bd. of Public Accountancy, 571 S.W.2d 366 (Tex. Ct. App. 1978) noted: "Upon the hearing of such motion, the burden of proof shall be
upon the attorney appearing for the plaintiff to show sufficient authority from the plaintiff in such suit or proceeding to institute or prosecute the same."
The Texas Supreme Court in Angelina County v. McFarland, 374 S.W.2d 417 (Tex. 1964) also confirmed this interpretation: "Upon the hearing of such motion,
the burden of proof shall be upon the attorney appearing for the plaintiff to show sufficient authority from the plaintiff in such suit or proceeding to institute or
prosecute the same."
Potential Alternative Interpretations
While the majority of the cases clearly establish that a hearing is required to burden the attorney with proving their authority, there is one case that might suggest 
a different interpretation. Tanner v. Black, 464 S.W.3d 23 (Tex. App. 2015) states: "When a party to a lawsuit believes that the suit is being prosecuted or

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
defended without authority, she may file a sworn motion questioning the attorney's authority to act. Tex.R. Civ. P. 12... Upon the filing of a motion to show
authority, the challenged attorney bears the burden to 'show sufficient authority to prosecute or defend the suit on behalf of the other party.'"
This language might suggest that the mere filing of the motion shifts the burden to the challenged attorney. However, when read in the context of the numerous
other cases and the explicit language of Rule 12 itself, it becomes clear that this case is not contradicting the requirement for a hearing. Instead, it is simply
acknowledging that the filing of the motion initiates the process that will ultimately require the attorney to prove their authority at a hearing.
Consequences of Failure to Meet the Burden
If the challenged attorney fails to demonstrate their authority at the hearing, specific consequences follow:
Benit v. Primalend Capital Partners, LP, 05-21-00024-CV (Tex. App. May 06, 2022) explains: "If the challenged attorney does not meet his or her burden of proof,
the trial court is required (1) to bar the challenged attorney from appearing in the case and (2) to strike the pleadings if an authorized person does not appear."
The practical effect of a successful Rule 12 challenge was demonstrated in Phillips v. Phillips, 244 S.W.3d 433 (Tex. App. 2007), where "The trial court found that
Hood lacked authority and struck Patricia's motion for new trial."
Exceptions and Caveats
Waiver of Rule 12 Challenges
A party can waive their right to challenge an attorney's authority by not following Rule 12's procedures. Pratt v. State, 13-22-00030-CV (Tex. App. Apr 27, 2023)
notes: "Failing to follow Rule 12 results in waiver. Kindle, 151 S.W.3d at 210 (overruling an appellant's challenge to an attorney's authority because no such
challenge was brought during trial phase)."
Timing Constraints
Rule 12 motions must be filed and heard before the parties announce ready for trial. In re Benavides, 403 S.W.3d 370 (Tex. App. 2013) states: "The motion may
be heard and determined at any time before the parties have announced ready for trial. Tex.R. Civ. P. 12."
City of San Antonio v. Aguilar, 670 S.W.2d 681 (Tex. App. 1984) confirms this timing constraint: "Rule 12 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure requires a party
believing that a suit is being prosecuted or defended without authority by an attorney to move that such attorney not be permitted to appear in the cause before
the parties have announced ready for trial."
Conclusion
The answer to the question "Does a party have to set a Rule 12 motion for a hearing to burden the attorney with proving their authority?" is unequivocally yes.
The consistent interpretation across Texas case law establishes that:
The explicit language of Rule 12 places the burden of proof on the challenged attorney specifically "at the hearing on the motion."
Multiple Texas court decisions spanning several decades have consistently reinforced that the hearing is the procedural mechanism through which the burden
shifts to the challenged attorney.
The notice requirement of serving the challenged attorney at least ten days "before the hearing" further supports that a hearing is an essential part of the Rule
12 process.
The requirement that the challenged attorney must "appear before the court" to show their authority necessitates a formal hearing setting.
The timing constraint that the motion must be "heard and determined" before the parties announce ready for trial indicates that a hearing is a necessary
component.
The procedural sequence established by Rule 12 and affirmed in multiple cases requires filing a sworn motion, providing proper notice, conducting a hearing
before trial readiness is announced, and at that hearing, placing the burden on the challenged attorney to prove their authority. If the attorney fails to meet this
burden at the hearing, the court must bar them from appearing in the case and strike pleadings if no authorized person appears.
In conclusion, Texas law conclusively establishes that setting a Rule 12 motion for a hearing is the necessary procedural step to burden the challenged attorney
with proving their authority to represent their client. Without this hearing, the burden does not shift, and the attorney is not compelled to demonstrate their
authority under Rule 12.

A Rule 12 motion must be sworn and served on the challenged attorney at least 10 days before the hearing. This implies that a hearing is indeed necessary for
the motion to proceed, as the attorney must be given an opportunity to prove their authority. The burden of proof lies with the challenged attorney to demonstrate
their authority to represent the client. If they fail to do so, the court is required to take specific actions, such as barring the attorney from appearing in the case and
striking the pleadings if no authorized person appears. Therefore, setting a Rule 12 motion for a hearing is essential to burden the attorney with proving their
authority.

Summary
Under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 12, a party can challenge an attorney's authority by filing a sworn written motion. This motion must be served to the
challenged attorney at least ten days before the hearing. The hearing is necessary because it is at this hearing that the attorney bears the burden of proof to show
their authority to act on behalf of the client. Therefore, setting a Rule 12 motion for a hearing is essential to burden the attorney with proving their authority.

When a party to a lawsuit believes that the suit is being prosecuted or defended without authority, she may file a sworn motion questioning the attorney's authority

Summary
Under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 12, a party can file a sworn motion to question an attorney's authority to act in a lawsuit. Once such a motion is filed, the
burden shifts to the challenged attorney to demonstrate their authority to prosecute or defend the suit. This implies that the act of filing the motion itself is
sufficient to place the burden on the attorney, without explicitly stating that a hearing must be set for this burden to apply.

Summary

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
The passage clearly states that under Rule 12, a party can file a motion to challenge the authority of an attorney, and this motion requires a hearing where the
attorney must prove their authority. This indicates that setting a hearing is necessary to shift the burden of proof to the attorney.
In re Benavides, 403 S.W.3d 370 (Tex. App. 2013)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Rule 12 allows a party to argue before the trial court that a suit is being prosecuted or defended without authority. Tex.R. Civ. P. 12; Boudreau v. Fed. Trust Bank,
115 S.W.3d 740, 741 (Tex.App.-Dallas 2003, pet. denied). When a party files a rule 12 motion to show authority, the challenged attorney must appear before the
trial court to show his authority to act on behalf of his client. Tex.R. Civ. P. 12; R.H. v. Smith, 339 S.W.3d 756, 762 (Tex.App.-Dallas 2011, no pet.). The motion
may be heard and determined at any time before the parties have announced ready for trial. Tex.R. Civ. P. 12.
Summary
When a Rule 12 motion is filed, the attorney whose authority is challenged must appear before the trial court to demonstrate their authority. The motion can be
heard at any time before the parties have announced ready for trial. This implies that a hearing is necessary for the attorney to be burdened with proving their
authority, as the court needs to determine the motion.
