Plaintiff incorporates by reference public records from the Texas Supreme
Court, and requests the court to take judicial notice of these documents. The
Fifth Circuit has repeatedly held that it is proper for federal courts to take
judicial notice of matters of public record, including documents filed in state
court proceedings (Miller v. Dunn, 35 F.4th 1007 (5th Cir. 2022); LUV N'
Care, Ltd. v. Jackel Int'l Ltd., 502 F.Supp.3d 1106 (W.D. La. 2020); Wright v.
Arlington Indep. Sch. Dist., Civil Action No. 4:19-cv-00278-P (N.D. Tex. Nov
25, 2019)). Plaintiff therefore requests that this Court take judicial
knowledge of the consolidated mandamus record, as its’ authenticity is not
reasonably disputed. Here, all record references point to the public
consolidated mandamus record, as submitted to the Texas Supreme Court, a
copy of which has been served upon each defendant named in this complaint
either individually or through their agent. Link to the record: https://

bc41-bbc08c814365 All references to the record are marked herein with
“REC. [page]” and are hyperlinked to take the reader directly to the
reference. The record is filed under affidavit, and remains unopposed at the
time of filing this complaint. Therefore, Plaintiff respectfully asks that the
Court take judicial notice of the record under Federal Rule of Evidence 201,
filed on June 6, 2025, in the Texas Supreme Court under case numbers
25-0361, 25-0367, 25-0378, 25-0426, and 25-0458. II. TIMELINE OF
EVENTS BACKGROUND Morgan Michelle Myers, (“Myers”) and Charles
Dustin Myers, (“Plaintiff”) were married on June 20, 2015, and have two
daughters, C.R.M. and M.E.M, aged seven and nine. The evidence in this
case will show that in early December of 2023, the entire family was
blindsided by Myers’ sudden announcement that she wanted a divorce from
Plaintiff. REC. 717 The evidence will further show that Myers’ reasoning for
this divorce changes over time – beginning with how Plaintiff spoke to her,
and then switches to abuse and sexual harassment, and allegations of drug
abuse, claims that were only brought up in her initial pleadings. On
December 12, 2023, Plaintiff discovered a large volume of text messages
between Myers and two individuals identified as Debbie Price and Damen
Kazlauskas of Fort Worth, Texas spanning between October 2022 and
December 2023. REC. 254-714 In response to this discovery, Myers began to
communicate with Defendant Daniel Kenneth Branthoover, a resident of
Yukon, Oklahoma, who assisted her in the planning, drafting, traveling, and
submitting of fraudulent documents to the 322nd District Court of Tarrant
County designed to divest Plaintiff of his home and business operations.
When these allegations were raised to the State, they failed to adjudicate
them and violated the Plaintiff’s constitutional rights when he was deprived
of the guarantees of equal protection under the law and when he was not
afforded due process before being deprived of his property. REC. 183. The
central question is whether Defendants Munford, Kaitcer, Carter, and Baker
are victims of the initial scheme – or willing participants in an expanded
associate-in-fact enterprise that began in December of 2023 as the Myers-
Branthoover enterprise. A. The Myers-Branthoover Enterprise 1. On
December 14, 2023, Defendants Morgan Michelle Myers (“Myers)” and
Daniel Kenneth Branthoover (“Branthoover”), acting in concert and under
deceptive pretenses, (REC. 1704), initiated text-message communications
through which they formed and advanced a common plan and agreement.
Over the weekend of December 15, 2023, they met in Yukon, Oklahoma, to
further that plan ( REC. 274-278). The deceptive text message from
Defendant Branthoover claiming that he wanted to assist Plaintiff was
following an attempt by Myers to receive an ex-parte order of protection
from the 322nd District Court of Tarrant county, attempted on December 14,
2023 (REC. 78). B. Interstate Travel and Transfer 2. As part of their
agreement, both Defendants planned to draft and submit an original petition
for divorce and an affidavit of indigency to the 322nd District Court of
Tarrant County, with the intended and foreseeable result of removing
Plaintiff from his matrimonial residence at 6641 Anne Court, Watauga, Texas
76148—which also serves as his place of business for clients in the United
States, Canada, and the United Kingdom that rely on his market data
services (REC. 812 ¶ 16). 3. During Defendant Myers’s interstate travel, she
transferred the parties’ marital funds into Defendant Branthoover’s PayPal
account in the amount of $1,576 (REC. 723). Those proceeds funded a
second mobile phone (817-940-0852), listed on the fraudulent pleadings that

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Myers and Branthoover jointly prepared in Oklahoma, which Myers then
carried from Yukon to Texas on December 17, 2023 (REC. 86; 99; 102; 107).
C. Admissions 4. On December 16, 2023, Plaintiff reached out to
Branthoover and requested that the $1,576 be returned as they were needed
for Christmas gifts for the children, and for business advertising expenses
for his business. REC. 728-729. In response, defendant Branthoover
admitted that the purpose of defendant Myers’ visit was to help her prepare
paperwork for divorce litigation and confirmed that the transfer of $1,576
did in fact occur. REC. 730. Plaintiff’s bank statement from December 2023
further confirms this transaction. REC. 723. D. Post-submission
Collaboration 5. On December 18, 2023, defendant Myers submitted the
fraudulently prepared original petition for divorce, and an affidavit of
indigency to the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County. After these
documents were submitted, defendant Branthoover sent a text message to
Plaintiff on December 19, 2023, at 5:50 P.M. CST, holding himself out to be
defendant Myers’ attorney, showing his involvement extends past the initial
help in preparing the fraudulent documents. REC. 1712-1713 6. Four days
later, on December 22, 2023, defendant Myers submitted another knowingly
fraudulent application for protective to the 322nd District Court of Tarrant
County claiming that family violence had occurred on December 18, 2023,
supported by both an affidavit and unsworn declaration. REC. 108-109. E.
Significant and Intentional Misrepresentations 7. On December 27 and
December 28, 2023, respectively, the documents prepared by Myers with
the assistance of Branthoover were served on Plaintiff via the U.S.
Constable, and contained the following misrepresentations: i. That
defendant Myers could not afford court costs; REC. 72, REC. 85-96 ii. That
defendant Myers had an active order of protection against the Plaintiff with
a finding of family violence that had occurred during the marriage; REC. 78
at 10 iii. That defendant Myers was financially responsible for the family
vehicles, rent payments, utilities, and other household expenses, making
herself appear as the primary breadwinner; REC. 92 iv. That defendant
Myers would be harassed or abused if Plaintiff were given her newly
acquired phone number that was obtained while in Oklahoma; REC. 81 at
15. v. That defendant Myers and Plaintiff ceased living together on
December 1, 2023; REC. 74 at 4 vi. That family violence occurred on
December 18, 2023, in the presence of the two Children. REC. 108-109. vii.
That both family vehicles were defendant Myers’ separate property acquired
before marriage. REC. 79 at 11B F. Evidence to the Contrary 8. On the same
day Defendant Myers claimed to be in an emergency requiring the Plaintiff’s
prompt removal from the home, she can be seen at the home with Plaintiff
and the children in no state of emergency and also still cohabitating in the
marital home. REC 1715. 9. Again, on December 29, 2023, Defendant Myers
can be seen with Plaintiff at the family home, smiling and laughing with the
children in no state of emergency and still collaborating with Plaintiff in the
marital home. REC. 1735. 10. The citation for the application for protective
order ordered Respondent to show cause as to why it should not issue with a
hearing scheduled for January 16, 2024. REC. 118. 11. In response to
extensive misrepresentation above, Plaintiff prepared an original answer,
filed a motion to consolidate, and provided background information which
alleged that defendant Myers was intentionally abusing the legal process.
REC. 130-132. Plaintiff was ordered to show cause on January 16, 2024,
regarding the protective order application. REC. 118 G. Inclement Weather

and First Appearance 12. On January 15, 2024, the Tarrant County District
Courts Facebook page sent out a notice informing the members of the public
that the court would be closed on January 16, 2024, due to inclement
weather. REC. 1202. 13. Unaware of the closure at the time, the parties
appeared at the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County on January 16, 2024,
and were met with a dark courtroom, with only one judge in the building at
the time of their arrival – Defendant James Munford (“Munford”). 14.
Defendant Munford summarily ordered the Plaintiff out of his home,
inadvertently assisting the Myers-Branthoover associate-in-fact enterprise of
achieving their primary goal in having the Plaintiff removed from his
residence, despite the broader goal being to obtain a decree of divorce to
permanently divest Plaintiff of his interests. REC. 183. 15. Defendant
Munford’s initial order was baseless, made in the absence of any emergency,
without a hearing, and disregarded the Plaintiff’s pleadings, telling Myers
“you’re going to have to find evidence of family violence!” clearly aware that
this order was made without any regard to the Plaintiff’s constitutional
rights. 16. Defendant Jeffrey Kaitcer, (“Kaitcer”) walked into the courtroom
late due to the inclement weather and turned the courtroom into a laughing
matter as he began to joke with Defendant Munford, and instructed the
parties to download the AppClose app for communication, and the matter
was reset for January 22, 2024. There exists no record of this proceeding,
only marked appearances on the docket. H. Reset #1 – January 22, 2024,
Setting 17. At the January 22 reset hearing, the parties appeared only to
have the case reset once more because defendant Myers allegedly retained
the services of Defendant Cooper Carter, (“Carter”) in the lobby of the
courthouse just moments before the hearing was scheduled to begin. No
appearance can be traced to this setting by either party on the docket (REC.
1551), and once again, no hearing was held, and the case reset for a second
time to February 1, 2024. REC. 186. 18. Kaitcer permitted attorney Dan
Bacalis, Plaintiff’s prior attorney, to fill out the Associate Judge’s Report, and
the parties never went before him as indicated by the case docket’s lack of
appearance on this date by either party. I. Reset #2 – February 1, 2024,
Setting 19. One day prior to the February 1 setting, both attorneys,
Defendant Carter and Dan Bacalis, both amended the petition for divorce
and counterpetition for divorce without the parties’ knowledge. (REC. 189,
REC. 209) These amended documents were similar, submitted on the same
day, and raised concerns for Plaintiff regarding his quality of representation.
20. At the February 1 setting, both parties were in the conference rooms
outside of Defendant Kaitcer’s courtroom, when attorney Bacalis walks in
holding a settlement agreement. When Plaintiff refused this option and
requested that they go have a hearing before the judge. 21. This is when
Bacalis stated, as witness affidavits corroborate, that he “knows this Judge
and this is the best we can get.” and further stated “[w]e’ll be here all day.
We can come back and change it later.” 22. Outraged by this response,
Plaintiff paid very close attention to the settlement offer Bacalis was
pressuring him to sign, and noticed the following provisions: A typed written
Order conforming to this Report will follow within 20 days from the date this
Report is signed. The Temporary Order shall be prepared by DAN BACALIS.
Each attorney should approve the Order. The parties do not need to approve
the Order. The attorney reviewing the proposed Order shall have five (5)
days to do so. There arc no ten (JO) day letters. If an agreement is not
reached, a Motion to Sign shall be filed and set within thirty (30) days from

=== PAGE 5 ===

the signing of this Report. IT IS SO ORDERED (REC. 233) J. Termination of
Counsel and the Emergency Motion 23. With the above provisions in mind,
Plaintiff signed the document and immediately fired his attorney and
provided notice to the court. REC. 221. By doing so, Plaintiff gained access
back to the residency, invalidated the agreement, and was able to use the
time back in the house to run damage control on his business operations
while preparing to expose the Myers-Branthoover enterprise to the court via
a MOTION TO RECONSIDER EVIDENCE AND VACATE TEMPORARY
ORDERS, which was filed on February 9, 2024, within three business days of
the February 1 agreed associate judge’s report being served by the clerk.
REC. 240 24. In this motion, it was specifically stated that: i. “I am seeking
immediate court intervention to correct procedural e rrors and address the
misuse of the legal system by the Petitioner.” REC. 244 ii. “Particularly, Dan
Branthoover became involved. He is the boyfriend of the Petitioner’s Mother.
Shortly thereafter, I received a notice from our joint bank account stating
that $1,576 had just been withdrawn. As our bank statement for December
2023 will demonstrate – the transaction record shows the funds being
transferred directly to Mr. Branthoover’s PayPal account” REC. 245 iii. “The
Petitioner's action of filing for divorce under an Affidavit of Inability to pay
three days after transferring $1,576 to herself starkly contravenes the
mandates set forth in Chapter 10, Section 10.001 of the Civil Practice and
Remedies Code”. REC 247 at B2 iv. “The Petitioner violated Chapter 10,
Section 10.001 a second time within the same document when she
intentionally elected to waive the 60-day waiting period claiming to have an
active protective order against me that found family violence had occurred
during our marriage.” REC 247 at B3. v. “This suit was the second attempt
by the Petitioner to have me removed from the home, which ultimately
succeeded.” REC 248 at D1 25. The motion went on to explain the factual
pattern described up to this point, putting the court on notice of the key
issues with provided exhibits which were duly served on Carter. In response
to Plaintiff’s motion, he received the first of just two email communications
from Carter throughout the case’s history, where she claimed she would be
filing a counter motion when disclosing her availability for the hearing on
Plaintiff’s emergency motion. REC. 2794 No such countermotion was filed
by Carter. K. Summary Judgment and Notice of Hearing 26. By February 22,
no response had been filed by Carter, so Plaintiff filed a Partial Motion for
Summary Judgment. REC. 758. Plaintiff also submitted a proposed parenting
plan as Exhibit D. REC. 769. No response was ever received from Carter. 27.
On February 27, 2024, Defendant Munford signed and issued a notice of
hearing to the parties with the hearing set for March 14, 2024. REC. 776. L.
Plaintiff’s Notice to the Court and Defendant Myers’ Self-Help Remedies 28.
On March 3, 2024, Plaintiff notified the Court that he would not be leaving
the home as it was not in the best interests of his children. REC. 782. 29.
The following day, on March 6, 2024, while walking his daughters to school,
Myers ran inside the family home, and locked him out of the marital
residence, leaving a sign on the door that said “[y]ou should have been out
by Saturday you are now locked out!” REC. 1748. 30. Plaintiff called local
law enforcement to help him regain entry into the home, where mother
produced the agreed associate judge’s report signed on February 1, 2024,
and used it as a means to block Plaintiff’s entrance to the home. 31. To avoid
further conflict, Plaintiff was escorted into the home where he was able to
grab only his computer and a few clothes and went to Flower Mound to

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
temporarily stay with his father until the time of the hearing on his
emergency motion, scheduled for March 14, 2024, at 9:00 A.M. L. The
Hearing On Plaintiff’s Emergency Motion 32. On March 14, 2024, the
parties arrived at the 322nd District Court, and on the way into the
courtroom, defendants Myers and Carter could be seen in the conference
room, quickly shuffling papers back and forth. 33. After checking in with the
bailiff, Plaintiff turned around to see defendant Carter extending to him a
document titled “Temporary Orders” that were the reduced version of the
February 1 associate judge’s report. REC. 888. 34. These orders, which were
not prepared by Dan Bacalis, which were not agreed to by the parties, were
reduced well outside of the 20-day requirement as ordered by the judge, and
which were never filed with the clerk, stated the following
misrepresentations: i. On February 1, 2024, the Court heard Petitioner's
motion for temporary orders. ii. The parties have agreed to the terms of this
order as evidenced by the signatures below. REC. 888. iii. The Court, after
examining the record and the agreement of the parties and hearing the
evidence and argument of counsel, finds that all necessary prerequisites of
the law have been legally satisfied and that the Court has jurisdiction of this
case and of all the parties. REC. 888. iv. The dates that the parties would
have access to the family residence was altered, changing the date Plaintiff
was supposed to leave from March 1, 2024, to March 20, 2024, and
changing Myers’ date of re-entry from March 1, 2024, to March 30, 2024,
leaving a 10-day window where no one would occupy the residence. v. This
modification was made to prevent Myers from being liable for illegally
locking Plaintiff out of the home on March 6, 2024. 35. On the last page of
the orders, Plaintiff’s attorney who was terminated weeks earlier did not
sign the document, and Plaintiff refused to sign the document for the
forthcoming reasons: i. It claimed a hearing occurred on a motion which was
never set for a hearing or served on the Plaintiff and doesn’t exist on the
docket. ii. It was prepared by defendant Carter, not Dan Bacalis. iii. The
associate judge was presiding over a de novo request of his own prior
report. iv. The matrimonial address was incorrect, as it stated “6641 Anns
Court”, rather than 6641 Anne Court. REC. 915, REC. 922 v. The orders
were not in the best interests of the children. vi. Notwithstanding the
Plaintiff’s revocation of consent by filing the emergency motion, the terms
were altered right before they were rendered into effect by defendant
Kaitcer. vii. Plaintiff did not agree to the terms as he was in court that very
day to expose Myers. M. Predicate Acts: Extortion 36. Kaitcer, knowing that
no response was filed, knowing that he was presiding over a hearing to
which he had no subject matter jurisdiction, and knowing that the temporary
orders produced by defendant Carter was served just moments earlier,
signed another associate judge’s report pre-drafted by defendant Carter,
which summarily denied the Plaintiff’s emergency motion, ignored the fact
that Carter had not provided a response, and within the report itself,
Plaintiff was ordered to sign the document that Carter had just presented to
him despite raising objections to its’ contents, and despite his consent not
being present. REC. 795. 37. Finally, defendant Kaitcer refused to consider
Plaintiff’s exhibits, including six affidavits prepared by his business clients
who have been directly affected by his inability to provide the real-time
market data services his clients relied on, who were located throughout the
United States. REC. 851; REC. 854; REC. 857; REC. 860; REC. 863; REC.
867; REC. 870. 38. Following the setting, the orders were rendered into

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
effect without Plaintiff’s signature (REC. 925) , and Plaintiff filed a request
for findings of fact and conclusions of law (REC. 883), and filed and
amended a “Preparatory Notice for Judicial Review” which recounted the
factual timeline up to that point, and included the affidavits that Kaitcer
refused to accept on March 14, 2024. REC. 798, REC. 851, REC. 854, REC.
857, REC. 860, REC. 863, REC. 867, REC. 870. 39. The orders stated they
were to remain in effect until the final decree of divorce, and Plaintiff’s
journey of one-sided appeals began. N. One Sided Appellate Efforts, and
Defective IWO 40. Following the rendition of the temporary orders on March
26, 2024, Plaintiff spent between April 8, 2024 and September 15, 2024,
appealing via mandamus to the Second Court of Appeals and the Texas
Supreme Court. REC. 1010. 41. During the appellate efforts, Carter filed one
of two motions in the case, which was a motion for pre-trial conference filed
on April 24, 2024, on her behalf by Roderick D. Marx, a party not named in
the suit. REC. 1014, REC. 1016. 42. Plaintiff immediately objected to the
pre-trial conference, and no response was ever issued by Carter or the
court. REC. 1018. 43. On April 30th, Plaintiff filed his notice of completion
regarding the parenting course as ordered, despite actively trying to vacate
them. REC. 1047. No parenting course was ever completed by Myers. 44. On
May 2, 2024, Plaintiff’s en banc reconsideration was denied in the Second
Court of Appeals, and he began preparing an appeal to the Supreme Court
of Texas. REC. 1067. 45. On May 19, 2024, Carter sent the second and last
email correspondence that would be received in the case, which falsely
claimed he agreed to the orders signed on March 14, 2024, and requested
that he fill out an IWO, which Plaintiff found to be defective. REC. 1722,
REC. 1728. No further correspondence was received by Carter. O.
Fraudulent Intervention and Branthoover’s Continued Involvement 46. On
June 23rd Plaintiff filed a motion in state court entitled MOTION FOR
JOINDER OF PERSONS NEEDED FOR JUST ADJUDICATION at 12:14 P.M.
REC. 1075. This motion received no response from Carter. 47. On June 23rd
at 1:54 P.M., directly following the submission of the motion, Branthoover
texted Plaintiff stating “Lol. And here comes another denial. Please sue me
individually. Please.”, referring to the earlier filed motion and showing his
continued oversight of the case’s progression since his initial predicate acts.
48. Four days later, on June 28, 2024, the Texas Office of the Attorney
General allegedly filed an intervention pleading, claiming that Plaintiff was
past due on child support, and requested information from Plaintiff. REC.
1099. 49. Most notably, the certificate of service to this intervention
pleading was allegedly signed by Holly Hayes, the designated attorney for
the OAG, yet the name underneath the signature line reads CHOYA
BURKLEY. REC. 1102. 50. Plaintiff promptly objected to the intervention,
and never received any response from the OAG, Carter, or the court. REC.
1106. P. Supreme Court, Rule 12, and Emergency Temporary Orders 51. As
Plaintiff continued to appeal to the Supreme Court of Texas, all prosecution
came to an end in the trial court. It wasn’t until September 15, 2024, that
Plaintiff filed a first amended rehearing motion in the Texas Supreme Court,
(REC. 1136) and after noticing Carter’s lack of participation, he began to
question her authority given several ambiguities surrounding her
representation, and filed a rule 12 motion to show authority. REC. 1170. No
response was ever received to this motion from Carter. 52. At this point,
Plaintiff had been staying in Airbnb homes while he sought relief to ensure
he could remain close to his daughters during this time. On September 26,

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
2024, he filed and later amended an EMERGENCY MOTION FOR
TEMPORARY ORDERS and requested expedited relief by October 1, 2024,
as that was when Plaintiff was forced to move away from the area due to
cost of living being unsustainable. REC. 1184. No response was ever
received from Carter regarding this motion. 53. By October 1, Plaintiff had
no choice but to start pursuing administrative remedies, and thought the
court was biased against him given the case’s history up to that point. He
began to prepare a Joint Motion to Recuse defendants Munford and Kaitcer
and filed it with the clerk of the court on October 7, 2024. REC. 1197. Q.
Predicate Act: Wire Fraud 54. On October 8, 2024, Defendant Munford
signed and forwarded a “Joint Motion to Recuse” attached to his order of
referral to regional presiding judge David L. Evans but was notably missing
the exhibits and affidavit critical to the motion. REC. 1222 55. A copy of this
exchange was sent via defendant Baker on 4:43 P.M. on October 8. REC.
1254 56. Plaintiff immediately pointed out the discrepancies between the
motion filed and the motion forwarded to David L. Evans, where she replied
and admitted that the full document had been e-filed and remains with the
court. REC. 1255 57. Unsatisfied with this response, Plaintiff further pointed
out that the filing size of the document filed and the one referring to David
L. Evans was significantly different. No further correspondence was
received by Baker until the following day. REC. 1256 58. The following day
on October 8, 2024, defendant Munford signed and filed an “Amended Order
of Referral” which had the full motion attached this time, albeit still
modified as the hyperlinks and bookmarks had been removed. REC. 1282 59.
This amended referral was sent via email correspondence by Baker at 11:17
A.M. on October 8, 2024, who stated that due to the size of the motion, it
was split into three parts. REC. 1258. This excuse directly contradicts the
standard filing procedure in Tarrant County, which was raised and
subsequently ignored in an objection. REC. 1269. No response was filed in
regard to the motion to recuse or objection by Carter. R. Recusal Denial and
More Delays, and Federal Removal 60. Justice E. Lee Gabriel was assigned
to hear the motion, which had to be rescheduled due to technical difficulties
for November 7, 2024. REC. 1306. 61. The morning of the hearing, Plaintiff
woke up with a dental emergency, and promptly notified all parties, and
requested a reset for the hearing, which everyone agreed to. REC.
1393-1396. 62. Despite this agreement, the recusal was denied for failure to
appear, and made no mention of the agreement or the emergency. REC.
1398. 63. With no other remedies left, Plaintiff removed the case to Federal
Court on December 2, 2024, which was quickly remanded back on
December 4, 2024. REC. 1426. 64. On December 14, 2024, defendant
Branthoover texted Plaintiff, sending a threat which stated “[w]hen things
all over, you get to deal with me.” at 2:15 P.M. REC. 1720 65. On December
16, 2024, Plaintiff initiated suit against Daniel Kenneth Branthoover in the
Western District of Oklahoma seeking relief in the form of damages from the
ongoing deprivation from his home. REC. 1451. 66. Plaintiff notified the
Texas court of this lawsuit on December 31, 2024. REC. 1446. S. Further
Delays, Motion to Dismiss for Want of Prosecution, and the Original SAPCR
67. On January 24, 2025, Plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss for want of
prosecution due to the total lack of participation in the case by the opposing
party. REC. 1527. No response was ever received from Carter on this
motion. 68. On January 29, 2025, defendant Myers began disposing of
Plaintiff’s personal belongings that remained on the family property. REC.

=== PAGE 9 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
1629-1631. 69. On February 12, 2025, Plaintiff learned that his youngest
daughter was suffering from dental pain due to Myers’ failure to obtain
dental insurance for the children. REC. 3281. 70. By March 14, (REC.
1833-1837) the judges had still not been reinstated from the first recusal,
which lad Plaintiff to reach out to Baker to request a hearing on his
unopposed summary judgment that had been on the docket since February
22, 2024, where he had to remind her to reinstate the judges back into the
case. REC. 1833-1837. 71. Given the delays, and since the case had been
brought in bad faith initially, the Plaintiff opened an original SAPCR suit in
the 233rd District Court of Tarrant County on March 18, 2025, where he
argued for dominant jurisdiction in a cover letter sent to the clerk. REC.
2260. T. Counsel Suddenly Becomes Active 72. The very next day, defendant
Carter filed an original answer filed on her behalf by Roderick Marx. REC.
2279. The motion was a boilerplate motion, and was followed by a motion to
consolidate, which was filed in the wrong court, and was also filed on
Carter’s behalf by RODERICK D. MARX. REC. 2284. 73. The Plaintiff
immediately responded by filing a motion to strike (REC. 1957) a Rule 12
motion to show authority challenging both Carter and RODERICK D MARX’s
authority (REC. 2288) and on March 24, 2025, an emergency ex-parte TRO
to prevent Myers from barring Plaintiff’s access to the home. (REC. 2302)
No responses were ever received from Carter on these motions. 74. On
March 26, 2025, an objection was filed to Carter’s consolidation motion in
the 233rd court. REC. 1881. 75. Plaintiff reached out to the coordinator from
the 233rd and went through the process to present the motion to the judge.
REC. 2338-2341. 76. On March 29, 2025, Plaintiff appeared before Associate
Judge Kate Stone, who refused to hear Plaintiff’s emergency motion despite
no response being filed, and told him to leave the courtroom. The hearing
date scheduled for April 10, 2025, as agreed by Carter and Plaintiff (REC.
2358), was actually un-set by Stone. REC. 2361. 77. The grounds for this
outright refusal was due to Carter calling in a favor from the judge without
even being present in the courtroom, to where Stone left the room, came
back, and told the Plaintiff to leave informing him that a motion to
consolidate would be filed by Carter the following week. U. Five Concurrent
Mandamus Petitions 78. Subsequently, after he was turned away from the
courtroom, Carter’s consolidation motion wasn’t filed until April 4, 2025
(REC. 2367), resulting in two mandamus petitions to try again to have the
March 14, 2024, order signed by Kaitcer vacated, and to compel Kate Stone
to hear the emergency TRO. See 25-0361, 25-0367. 79. On the same day the
mandamus was filed against Stone, District Judge Kenneth Newell sua
sponte granted Carter’s consolidation motion in both courts without a
hearing, and without addressing the emergency situation for the children or
the Plaintiff’s objections, leading to a third mandamus proceeding. REC.
2393, See also 25-0378. 80. On April 23, 2025, a notice of trial setting was
served on the parties by defendant Munford in the midst of all of these
issues. REC. 1773. 81. The same day, Plaintiff filed an objection and
requested an emergency stay. REC. 2219. No response was received to this
objection by either Munford or Carter. 82. Two days later on April 25, 2025,
Plaintiff filed his second recusal motion, and amended it on April 28, 2025,
this time only against Munford, and requested that the rules of procedure be
followed, and objected to the involvement of the court coordinator given the
prior recusal’s ambiguity and significant delays caused by her involvement.
REC. 2488 No response to this motion was ever filed from Carter. 83. Baker

=== PAGE 10 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
continued to be involved in the recusal process, this time erroneously
forwarding an order of referral from defendant Kaitcer, who was not named
in the recusal motion. REC. 2615. 84. Plaintiff immediately objected on April
29, 2025, naming two issues: 1) the coordinator was still involved, and 2) the
order of referral sent by Kaitcer was erroneous. REC. 2620. 84. Plaintiff
objected to the order of assignment of John H. Cayce (REC. 3149) which was
issued on May 7, 2025, due to the unresolves issues. REC. 2620. 85. David L.
Evans overruled this objection on May 15, 2025, leading to mandamus
petition 25-0426, a direct appeal to the Texas Supreme Court. REC. 3507.
86. On May 20, 2025, John H. Cayce summarily denied the recusal, including
the denial of a motion to recuse Kaitcer which was never filed, leading to
mandamus petition 25-0458, a second direct appeal to the Texas Supreme
Court. 87. All five petitions were denied both initially and on rehearing, and
all emergency motions to stay proceedings were dismissed. The only insights
given from the appellate courts was: “Denied, per curiam.” No response was
filed by any implicated judge or opposing counsel. V. Federal RICO Case and
the Push Towards Final Trial 88. In June of 2025, Plaintiff amended his
complaint against Daniel Kenneth Branthoover and enjoined Myers as a
defendant, which they defended pro-se. 89. Plaintiff communicated this
action with the trial court, and no further action was taken in the case until
August of 2025, when defendant Munford sua sponte set the case for final
trial on December 10, 2025. 90. Plaintiff immediately objected to this trial
setting, and moved to recuse Munford for a third time. 91. The court
coordinator continued to be involved in the process, leading to a subsequent
motion to recuse the regional presiding judge, David L. Evans. 92. Plaintiff
now prepares this suit to hold defendants accountable for their collective
actions, and to prevent their common goal from being achieved, which is to
obtain defendant Myers a final decree of divorce. 93. For the forthcoming
reasons, the conduct outlined herein constitutes conduct of an enterprise
through a pattern of racketeering activity, as several predicate acts were
committed, the enterprise shares a common purpose, and Plaintiff has
suffered direct and ongoing injury to business and property as a direct result
of the defendant’s collective predicate acts. RICO The timeline and evidence
provided demonstrate that the Myers-Branthoover group constitutes an
association-in-fact enterprise under RICO, with a common goal to deprive
the Plaintiff of his home and business through a pattern of racketeering
activity—specifically, wire fraud, Travel Act violations, and fraudulent court
filings—causing direct injury to the Plaintiff’s business and property. The
conduct, structure, and continuity among the participants, as well as the use
of interstate communications and travel, satisfy the elements of a RICO
claim in the Tenth Circuit, with the liability of other defendants depending
on their knowledge and intent. A. Summary The Myers-Branthoover
enterprise, as detailed in the factual timeline, meets the Tenth Circuit’s
requirements for a RICO claim by establishing an association-in-fact
enterprise with a defined structure, purpose, and continuity. The group’s
coordinated actions—including interstate transfer of funds, preparation and
submission of fraudulent legal documents, and ongoing manipulation of
court proceedings—constitute a pattern of racketeering activity, with
predicate acts of wire fraud and Travel Act violations that are related and
continuous. Plaintiff’s direct and ongoing injury to his business and property,
including loss of home, business operations, and client relationships, is
proximately caused by the enterprise’s acts. While Myers and Branthoover’s

=== PAGE 11 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
liability is clear, the involvement of other defendants (Munford, Kaitcer,
Carter, and Baker) may be characterized as inadvertent or willing
participation, depending on their knowledge and intent, but the core
elements of a RICO violation are satisfied by the conduct of Myers and
Branthoover as outlined in the enumerated timeline. The additional acts
committed by each defendant, as alleged, furthered the scheme of the
enterprise despite each additional defendant having actual knowledge of the
fraudulent scheme. RICO Statutory Framework The Racketeer Influenced
and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), codified at 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961–1968,
provides a civil cause of action for individuals injured in their business or
property by reason of a pattern of racketeering activity conducted through
an enterprise affecting interstate or foreign commerce. The most commonly
invoked provision, § 1962(c), prohibits any person employed by or associated
with an enterprise from conducting or participating in the conduct of such
enterprise’s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity. Section
1962(d) further prohibits conspiracies to violate any of the substantive RICO
provisions. To establish a civil RICO claim under § 1962(c), a plaintiff must
prove: i. The existence of an enterprise; ii. The enterprise’s engagement in,
or effect on, interstate or foreign commerce; iii. The defendant’s
employment by or association with the enterprise; iv. The defendant’s
participation, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of the enterprise’s affairs;
v. The defendant’s participation through a pattern of racketeering activity or
collection of unlawful debt. See 100 Mount Holly Bypass v. Axos Bank, Case
No. 2:20-CV-856-TS-CMR (D. Utah Jul 27, 2021). B. Predicate Acts and
Pattern Requirement RICO defines “racketeering activity” to include a wide
range of criminal offenses, including wire fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343) and
violations of the Travel Act (18 U.S.C. § 1952). A “pattern of racketeering
activity” requires at least two predicate acts within a ten-year period, but
the acts must be related and amount to or pose a threat of continued
criminal activity. The Supreme Court has clarified that a RICO violation
requires both an “enterprise” and a “pattern of racketeering activity,” with
the enterprise being a group of persons associated for a common purpose,
and the pattern involving a series of criminal acts (United States v. Harris,
695 F.3d 1125 (10th Cir. 2012)). The Tenth Circuit has further explained
that, to establish a pattern, it is not enough to simply show that two
predicate acts occurred within ten years; the acts must also be related and
pose a threat of continued criminal activity (U.S. v. Smith, 413 F.3d 1253
(10th Cir. 2005)). Note, however, that U.S. v. Smith has been stated as
overruled by United States v. Nissen, 555 F.Supp.3d 1174 (D. N.M. 2021) on
unrelated grounds, but its articulation of the pattern requirement remains
consistent with current law. C. Enterprise and Association-in-Fact An
“enterprise” under RICO includes any individual, partnership, corporation,
association, or group of individuals associated in fact, even if not a legal
entity. For an association-in-fact enterprise, the Tenth Circuit requires: i. A
purpose; ii. Relationships among those associated with the enterprise; iii.
Longevity sufficient to permit the associates to pursue the enterprise’s
purpose; iv. A decision-making framework or mechanism for controlling the
group; v. Functioning as a continuing unit; vi. Existence separate and apart
from the pattern of racketeering activity. See 100 Mount Holly Bypass. D.
Conspiracy Section 1962(d) makes it unlawful to conspire to violate any of
the substantive RICO provisions. A RICO conspiracy does not require the
establishment of an enterprise but requires that a defendant adopts the goal

=== PAGE 12 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
of furthering or facilitating a criminal endeavor that would satisfy the
elements of a substantive RICO offense (United States v. Martinez, 543
F.Supp.3d 1209 (D. N.M. 2021); United States v. Randall, 661 F.3d 1291
(10th Cir. 2011)). E. Injury Requirement RICO provides a private right of
action for individuals injured in their business or property through
fraudulent conduct, and there is no requirement that the conduct be
connected to organized crime in a civil setting (Plains Resources, Inc. v.
Gable, 782 F.2d 883 (10th Cir. 1986)). ANALYSIS F. Existence of an
Association-in-Fact Enterprise The timeline establishes that Myers and
Branthoover formed an association-in-fact enterprise beginning in December
2023 (¶¶ 1–7, 93). Their collaboration was structured, with Myers as the
petitioner in the divorce and Branthoover as the planner, drafter, and
facilitator of fraudulent documents and financial transactions. The group
had a clear purpose: to divest the Plaintiff of his home and business through
fraudulent legal filings and manipulation of court processes (¶¶ 1–7, 93).
The enterprise’s structure is evidenced by: i. The initial planning and
agreement to meet in Yukon, Oklahoma, to draft fraudulent documents (¶¶
1–3); ii. The use of interstate communications and travel to further the
scheme (¶¶ 2–3); iii. Ongoing coordination and adaptation to changing
circumstances, including the preparation and submission of false affidavits
and pleadings, and manipulation of court proceedings (¶¶ 5–7, 34, 93). This
satisfies the Tenth Circuit’s requirements for an association-in-fact
enterprise, which does not require a formal legal entity but does require a
common purpose, relationships, and sufficient longevity to pursue the
enterprise’s goals. G. Structure, Purpose, Relationships, and Continuity The
Myers-Branthoover group meets the requirements for an association-in-fact
enterprise: i. Purpose: The shared goal was to deprive the Plaintiff of his
home, business, and property interests through fraudulent means (¶¶ 1–7,
93). ii. Relationships: Myers and Branthoover maintained ongoing
communications, coordinated actions, and divided roles in the scheme (¶¶ 1–
7, 93). iii. Longevity and Continuity: The enterprise operated over a
substantial period, from at least December 2023 through present day 2025,
with multiple related acts and ongoing adaptation to changing
circumstances (¶¶ 1–93). iv. Decision-Making Framework: The group
planned, agreed on steps, and executed those steps in a coordinated manner
(¶¶ 1–7, 93). v. Existence Separate from Predicate Acts: The enterprise was
formed for the purpose of achieving a specific goal and engaged in multiple
acts over time to accomplish that goal. H. Predicate Acts: Wire Fraud, Travel
Act Violations, and Fraudulent Filings The timeline identifies multiple
predicate acts that qualify as racketeering activity under RICO: i. Wire
Fraud: Myers transferred $1,576 in marital funds to Branthoover’s PayPal
account during interstate travel, and these funds were used to purchase a
phone for use in the fraudulent scheme (¶¶ 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 34). The use of
electronic communications (text messages, emails) to plan and execute the
scheme further supports the wire fraud allegation (¶¶ 1–7, 34). ii. Travel Act
Violations: Myers traveled from Texas to Oklahoma to meet with
Branthoover, where they planned and prepared fraudulent legal documents,
which were then transported back to Texas and submitted to the court (¶¶ 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, 7). iii. Fraudulent Filings: The preparation and submission of false
affidavits and pleadings to the court, containing material misrepresentations
about financial status, family violence, and property ownership, constitute
further predicate acts (¶¶ 5, 6, 7, 34). At least two related predicate acts

=== PAGE 13 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
within ten years are required (U.S. v. Smith, 413 F.3d 1253 (10th Cir. 2005)),
and the timeline shows multiple, related predicate acts over a substantial
period (¶¶ 1–93). I. Pattern of Racketeering Activity: Relatedness and
Continuity The predicate acts were not isolated incidents but part of an
ongoing scheme. The acts were related in that they all aimed to deprive the
Plaintiff of his property and business, and they posed a threat of continued
criminal activity, as the enterprise continued to operate and adapt its tactics
over time (¶¶ 1–93). The timeline shows that the enterprise’s activities
extended over a substantial period, with multiple acts occurring over
months and involving ongoing coordination and adaptation to changing
circumstances. J. Injury to Business or Property Plaintiff suffered direct and
ongoing injury to his business and property as a result of the enterprise’s
actions. He was deprived of his home and business operations, lost access to
marital funds, and was unable to provide services to clients, resulting in
financial harm (¶¶ 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 37). These injuries are precisely the type
of harm RICO is designed to redress. Plains Resources, Inc. v. Gable, 782 F.
2d 883 (10th Cir. 1986)). K. Participation of Other Defendants: Inadvertent
or Willing The timeline raises the question of whether Munford, Kaitcer,
Carter, and Baker were victims of the initial scheme or willing participants
in the expanded enterprise. The evidence suggests that, at a minimum,
Myers and Branthoover were the core members of the enterprise, with
others potentially becoming involved through their actions in the legal
proceedings (¶¶ 14–93). i. Inadvertent Participation: Some defendants may
have participated inadvertently, such as by issuing orders or facilitating
court processes without knowledge of the underlying scheme (¶¶ 14–93). ii.
Willing Participation: Others may have become willing participants if they
knowingly furthered the enterprise’s objectives or ignored clear evidence of
fraud and misrepresentation (¶¶ 14–93). RICO does not impose liability for
inadvertent or unwitting participation; there must be knowing and willful
involvement in the conduct of the enterprise’s affairs. For the forthcoming
reasons, Plaintiff alleges that the Defendants are willing participants in the
scheme. VICTIM OR PARTICIPANT RICO liability extends to those who
knowingly participate in the conduct of the enterprise’s affairs, even if they
were not original members (RICO: A Primer (2022-01-31)). The timeline
raises the question of whether Munford, Kaitcer, Carter, and Baker were
victims of the initial scheme or willing participants in the expanded
enterprise. The evidence suggests that, at a minimum, Myers and
Branthoover were the core members of the enterprise, with others becoming
involved through their actions in the legal proceedings (¶¶ 14–93). The
timeline demonstrates that Carter, Kaitcer, and Myers engaged in extortion
by leveraging the threat of adverse legal action, fraudulent court orders, and
the manipulation of judicial process to coerce Plaintiff into relinquishing
property and business interests, satisfying the elements of extortion as a
predicate act under RICO and the Travel Act. Munford and Baker, for their
part, committed wire fraud by intentionally sending altered or incomplete
court documents via interstate email, with the intent to mislead, obstruct
relief, and further the enterprise’s objective of finalizing the divorce and
depriving Plaintiff of his property, thus meeting the requirements for wire
fraud as a RICO predicate act. These acts, as detailed in the timeline, are
not isolated but part of a coordinated pattern of racketeering activity within
an association-in-fact enterprise, as required by RICO in the Tenth Circuit.
The conduct of each defendant is tied to specific predicate acts—extortion

=== PAGE 14 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
for Carter, Kaitcer, and Myers (notably at timeline events 33–37), and wire
fraud for Munford and Baker (notably at events 54–59, 83)—demonstrating
knowing and willful participation in the enterprise’s broader scheme to
deprive Plaintiff of his home and business through fraudulent and coercive
means. A. Extortion and Wire Fraud The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961–1968, provides a civil cause of
action for injury to business or property caused by a pattern of racketeering
activity conducted through an enterprise affecting interstate commerce.
Predicate acts under RICO include extortion (as defined by the Hobbs Act
and the Travel Act) and wire fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343), among others.
Extortion is defined as obtaining property from another, with his consent,
induced by wrongful use of actual or threatened force, violence, or fear, or
under color of official right. The Travel Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1952, includes
extortion as an “unlawful activity” and does not require it to be part of a
business enterprise (U.S. v. Welch, 327 F.3d 1081 (10th Cir. 2003)). The
Tenth Circuit recognizes that extortion under the Travel Act can be
established by showing threats or coercion to obtain something of value,
including property or legal rights, in violation of state or federal law. Wire
fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343 requires (1) a scheme to defraud or obtain
property by false or fraudulent pretenses, (2) intent to defraud, and (3) use
of interstate wire communications to execute the scheme (Clinton v. Sec.
Benefit Life Ins. Co., 63 F.4th 1264 (10th Cir. 2023); United States v.
Holloway, 826 F.3d 1237 (10th Cir. 2016)). The Tenth Circuit requires that
the deprivation of property be a central object of the scheme, and that the
use of wires (including email) be knowing and in furtherance of the
fraudulent scheme (United States v. Tao, 629 F.Supp.3d 1083). B. Extortion
by Carter, Kaitcer, and Myers Extortion, as a RICO predicate act, is defined
broadly under federal law and the Travel Act. It includes obtaining property
or rights through threats, coercion, or misuse of official process (U.S. v.
Welch, 327 F.3d 1081 (10th Cir. 2003)). The Tenth Circuit does not require
extortion to be part of a business enterprise for Travel Act purposes; a single
act suffices if it has the requisite interstate nexus. The timeline shows the
following: i. Event 33–34: Carter, with Myers, prepared and presented
“Temporary Orders” that misrepresented facts (e.g., that Plaintiff agreed to
terms he did not, that a hearing occurred when it did not, and that the
orders were in the best interests of the children). These orders altered the
dates of access to the home to shield Myers from liability for locking Plaintiff
out, and were presented to Plaintiff in a context where he was under threat
of losing his home and business. iii. Event 36: Kaitcer, knowing the orders
were disputed and that no response had been filed, signed an associate
judge’s report pre-drafted by Carter, summarily denying Plaintiff’s
emergency motion and ordering Plaintiff to sign the disputed document,
despite his objections and lack of consent. iv. Event 35: Plaintiff refused to
sign the orders for multiple reasons, including their fraudulent content and
the lack of due process, but the orders were rendered into effect without his
signature. These acts collectively demonstrate the use of legal process and
the threat of adverse judicial action to coerce Plaintiff into surrendering his
property and business interests. The manipulation of court orders, the
misrepresentation of facts, and the pressure to sign under threat of losing
his home constitute extortion under the Travel Act and RICO (U.S. v. Welch,
327 F.3d 1081 (10th Cir. 2003). Myers’s role is clear: she was the beneficiary
and instigator of the fraudulent filings and the manipulation of court

=== PAGE 15 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
process, using the threat of legal action and the actual deprivation of
Plaintiff’s property to achieve her goal. Carter and Kaitcer acted in concert
with Myers, knowingly facilitating the extortion by preparing, presenting,
and enforcing fraudulent orders, and by using the authority of the court to
coerce Plaintiff. The fact that Plaintiff was ordered to sign a document he
objected to, under threat of continued deprivation of his home and business,
is classic extortion by color of official right. All three defendants knew that
Plaintiff did not agree to the order, as he had just fired his attorney to
challenge any basis for an agreement. This implies that despite the motion
being served on all defendants, they chose to ignore the allegations of a
fraudulent scheme and further the affairs of the enterprise. These actions
meet the requirements for extortion as a RICO predicate act: they involved
the wrongful use of threats and official process to obtain property (the home
and business) from Plaintiff, with his consent induced by fear of further loss
or legal harm. The acts were not isolated but part of a coordinated scheme
to achieve the enterprise’s goal of finalizing the divorce and divesting
Plaintiff of his property B. Wire Fraud by Munford and Baker Wire fraud
under 18 U.S.C. § 1343 requires a scheme to defraud, intent to defraud, and
use of interstate wire communications to execute the scheme (Clinton v. Sec.
Benefit Life Ins. Co., 63 F.4th 1264 (10th Cir. 2023); United States v.
Holloway, 826 F.3d 1237 (10th Cir. 2016)). The Tenth Circuit recognizes that
sending altered or incomplete court documents via email, with the intent to
mislead or deprive someone of property or rights, can constitute wire fraud
if the deprivation of property is a central object of the scheme (United
States v. Tao, 629 F.Supp.3d 1083). The timeline shows the following: i.
Event 54: Munford signed and forwarded a “Joint Motion to Recuse”
attached to his order of referral, but the document was missing critical
exhibits and affidavits necessary for Plaintiff’s relief. ii. Event 55: Baker sent
a copy of this incomplete filing via email, representing it as the full
document. iii. Event 56–57: When Plaintiff pointed out the discrepancies,
Baker provided inconsistent explanations, first claiming the full document
was e-filed, then later stating it was split into three parts due to size. iv.
Event 58: Munford signed and filed an “Amended Order of Referral” with the
full motion attached, but with hyperlinks and bookmarks removed, further
impairing the document’s integrity. v. Event 59, 83: Baker continued to
forward altered or incomplete orders and referrals, even when procedural
irregularities were raised. These acts involved the knowing use of interstate
email to transmit altered or incomplete court documents, with the intent to
prevent Plaintiff from obtaining relief and to further the enterprise’s goal of
finalizing the divorce and depriving Plaintiff of his property. The use of email
to transmit these documents satisfies the interstate wire requirement, and
the intent to defraud is evidenced by the deliberate alteration and
misrepresentation of the filings. The conduct of Munford and Baker meets
the elements of wire fraud: (1) a scheme to defraud Plaintiff of property and
rights, (2) intent to defraud by preventing relief and misleading the court
and Plaintiff, and (3) use of interstate wire communications (email) to
execute the scheme (Clinton v. Sec. Benefit Life Ins. Co., 63 F.4th 1264 (10th
Cir. 2023)). The deprivation of property (Plaintiff’s home and business) was
a central object of the scheme, not a minor part. RELATIONSHIP AND
CONTINUITY All these acts—extortion by Carter, Kaitcer, and Myers, and
wire fraud by Munford and Baker—were committed in furtherance of the
Myers-Branthoover enterprise’s overarching objective: to finalize the

=== PAGE 16 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
divorce and divest Plaintiff of his home and business. The acts were
coordinated, continuous, and related, satisfying the RICO pattern
requirement. The timeline shows that each defendant’s conduct was not an
isolated error or routine administrative act, but part of a deliberate scheme
to use the legal process, threats, and fraudulent communications to achieve
the enterprise’s unlawful goals. DAMAGES The harm inflicted upon Plaintiff
is staggering. He has lost the home in which he lived for nearly a third of his
life, the companionship of his spouse, and the society of his children. His
income has collapsed. For two years he has been consigned to a futile
appellate gauntlet, even as Defendants Munford, Kaitcer, Baker, and Carter
have repeatedly exceeded the bounds of their lawful authority in furtherance
of a broader scheme. What began as a concerted effort by Myers and
Branthoover to dispossess Plaintiff of his residence and property
metastasized into a calculated plan to procure a final decree of divorce once
the initial objective had been achieved. The objective was plain: by
engineering a final decree, Defendants would not only hobble Plaintiff’s
ability to bring this suit but also invite invocation of the Rooker–Feldman
doctrine and related abstention principles to preclude federal jurisdiction.
Now, after two years of unremitting effort, Plaintiff seeks the only
meaningful remedy remaining: federal redress to halt the ongoing abuses of
authority, to unwind tainted actions, and to compensate him fully for the
catastrophic losses Defendants have wrought. Take each piece in the TABLE
OF CONTENTS, research the topic, and tie it to the factual timeline, filling
out each element of the RICO complaint and tie each element to the factual
allegations by enumerated paragraph number. What are the standards for
pleading claims for relief in a civil RICO complaint in the Fifth Circuit,
including the types of relief available?
Answer (Fifth Circuit)
Short response
To plead a civil RICO claim in the Fifth Circuit, a plaintiff must allege with
factual specificity that a person engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity
connected to the conduct of an enterprise, and, where fraud is a predicate
act, must meet the heightened pleading standard of Rule 9(b); available
relief includes treble damages, costs, and attorney’s fees, but not injunctive
relief for private plaintiffs.
Summary
A civil RICO complaint in the Fifth Circuit must set out facts showing (1) a
person, (2) who engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity, (3) connected
to the acquisition, establishment, conduct, or control of an enterprise. The
complaint must provide sufficient factual detail to make the claim plausible,
and if fraud (such as wire or mail fraud) is alleged as a predicate act, the
circumstances must be pleaded with particularity under Rule 9(b); if
successful, the plaintiff is entitled to mandatory treble damages, costs, and
attorney’s fees, but not injunctive relief.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
The Fifth Circuit requires that each element of a RICO claim be supported
by well-pleaded facts, not mere legal conclusions, and the complaint must
show that the alleged predicate acts are related and amount to or pose a
threat of continued criminal activity. The types of relief available to a
prevailing civil RICO plaintiff are set by statute and include threefold actual
damages, costs, and reasonable attorney’s fees, but courts in this circuit do
not permit private plaintiffs to obtain injunctive relief under RICO.
Background and Relevant Law
Statutory and Pleading Framework
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), codified at
18 U.S.C. §§ 1961–1968, provides a civil cause of action for any person
injured in their business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962.
The statute enumerates four types of prohibited conduct in § 1962: (a)
investing income from racketeering in an enterprise, (b) acquiring or
maintaining an interest in an enterprise through racketeering, (c)
conducting the affairs of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering
activity, and (d) conspiring to violate any of the above. The most commonly
invoked provision in civil cases is § 1962(c), which prohibits any person
employed by or associated with an enterprise from conducting its affairs
through a pattern of racketeering activity (RICO: A Primer (2022-01-31); 
DOH Oil Co.v. Kahle (W.D. Tex. Jan. 4, 2023)).
To state a claim under § 1962(c), a plaintiff must allege: (1) the existence of
an enterprise; (2) the enterprise’s engagement in, or effect on, interstate or
foreign commerce; (3) the defendant’s employment by or association with
the enterprise; (4) the defendant’s participation, directly or indirectly, in the
conduct of the enterprise’s affairs; and (5) the defendant’s participation
through a pattern of racketeering activity (RICO: A Primer (2022-01-31); 
Peel v. cPaperless LLC (S.D. Tex. Nov. 8, 2024)).
A “pattern of racketeering activity” requires at least two predicate acts of
racketeering, which must be related and amount to or pose a threat of
continued criminal activity (Bustos v. Invierte En Tex. (W.D. Tex. June 3,
2024); Brown v. Protective Life Ins. Co. (5th Cir. 2003)). Predicate acts
include a range of federal and state crimes, most commonly mail and wire
fraud (Peel v. cPaperless LLC (S.D. Tex. Nov. 8, 2024)).
Pleading Standards
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2) requires a “short and plain statement
of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.” However, to
survive a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), the complaint must allege
enough facts to state a claim that is plausible on its face, allowing the court
to draw a reasonable inference of liability (United Healthcare Sevices, Inc. v.
Next Health, LLC (N.D. Tex. Feb. 26, 2021); D&T Partners LLC v. Baymark
Partners LP (N.D. Tex. May 9, 2022)). Threadbare recitals of the elements,
supported only by conclusory statements, are insufficient (Arruda v. Curves
Int'l, Inc. (5th Cir. June 28, 2021)).

=== PAGE 18 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
When fraud is alleged as a predicate act (e.g., mail or wire fraud), the
complaint must also satisfy the heightened pleading requirements of Rule
9(b), which demands that the circumstances constituting fraud be stated
with particularity. This includes the time, place, and content of the false
representations, the identity of the person making them, and what was
obtained as a result (Arruda v. Curves Int'l, Inc. (W.D. Tex. July 27, 2020); 
Williams v. WMX Technologies, Inc. (5th Cir. 1997)). The Fifth Circuit has
repeatedly enforced this standard, dismissing RICO claims that fail to plead
fraud with the required specificity (Tel-Phonic Services, Inc. v. TBS Intern.,
Inc. (5th Cir. 1992), superseded on other grounds).
Types of Relief
The relief available to a successful civil RICO plaintiff is set by 18 U.S.C. §
1964(c), which mandates an award of treble damages, costs, and reasonable
attorney’s fees (Atkinson v. Anadarko Bank and Trust Co. (5th Cir. 1987); 
Heden v. Hill (S.D. Tex. 1996)). The award of treble damages is not
discretionary; it is required by the statute (Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy
(2024-01-01)). However, the Fifth Circuit has held that private plaintiffs may
not obtain injunctive relief under RICO (Fredeman Litigation, In re (5th Cir.
1988)).
Analysis: Pleading Each Element of a Civil
RICO Claim in the Fifth Circuit
I. Jurisdiction and Venue
Federal courts have subject matter jurisdiction over civil RICO claims under
28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c), provided the complaint alleges
injury to business or property by reason of a RICO violation (Heden v. Hill
(S.D. Tex. 1996)). Venue is proper in any district where the alleged
enterprise operated or where any act of racketeering occurred.
II. Parties
The plaintiff must be a “person” injured in their business or property by
reason of a RICO violation. Defendants must also be “persons” as defined by
the statute, which includes individuals and entities (Brown v. Protective Life
Ins. Co. (5th Cir. 2003)).
III. Record References
The Fifth Circuit permits courts to take judicial notice of public records,
including state court filings, when authenticity is not reasonably disputed
(Miller v. Dunn, 35 F.4th 1007 (5th Cir. 2022); LUV N' Care, Ltd. v. Jackel
Int'l Ltd., 502 F.Supp.3d 1106 (W.D. La. 2020)). This supports the plaintiff’s
request for judicial notice of the consolidated mandamus record.

IV. Introduction
The introduction should set out the nature of the RICO claim, the parties,
and a summary of the alleged racketeering activity, referencing the timeline
and the enterprise’s structure.
V. Factual Timeline
The timeline must provide the factual basis for each element of the RICO
claim, with particularity for any fraud-based predicate acts. For example:
A. The Myers-Branthoover Enterprise: Allegations that Myers and
Branthoover formed an association-in-fact enterprise, with a common
purpose to deprive Plaintiff of his home and business, are essential to
establishing the “enterprise” element (RICO: A Primer (2022-01-31)).
B. Interstate Travel and Transfer: Details of interstate travel and
financial transfers support the interstate commerce requirement and
may serve as predicate acts (e.g., wire fraud).
C. Admissions: Direct admissions by participants can help establish
intent and the existence of a scheme.
D. Post-submission Collaboration: Ongoing collaboration and
communications show continuity and relatedness of the acts.
E. Significant and Intentional Misrepresentations: Specific
misrepresentations, especially if made via wire or mail, must be
pleaded with particularity under Rule 9(b).
F. Evidence to the Contrary: Contradictory evidence can support the
inference of fraudulent intent.
G–V.: Each subsequent section should tie specific factual allegations to
the elements of the RICO claim, including the pattern of racketeering
activity, the conduct of the enterprise, and the injury to Plaintiff’s
business or property.
VI. The RICO Enterprise
The complaint must allege the existence of an enterprise, which can be any
group of individuals associated in fact, functioning as a continuing unit with
a common purpose (Bordelon v. Wells Fargo Fin. La., LLC (E.D. La. July 25,
2018)). The timeline should show the structure, membership, purpose, and
continuity of the enterprise.
VII. Predicate Acts
The complaint must identify at least two predicate acts of racketeering
activity, such as wire fraud, mail fraud, extortion, or Travel Act violations,
and allege facts showing that these acts are related and continuous (Bustos
v. Invierte En Tex. (W.D. Tex. June 3, 2024)). For fraud-based predicates, the
circumstances must be pleaded with particularity (Arruda v. Curves Int'l,
Inc. (W.D. Tex. July 27, 2020)).

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
VIII. RICO Conspiracy
To plead a RICO conspiracy under § 1962(d), the complaint must allege an
agreement among the defendants to commit at least two predicate acts of
racketeering (Abraham v. Singh, 480 F.3d 351 (5th Cir. 2007)). Specific facts
showing the existence of such an agreement are required.
IX. Potential Defenses
Defendants may raise defenses such as preclusion, the Rooker-Feldman
doctrine, Younger abstention, judicial immunity, or other affirmative
defenses. The complaint should anticipate and address these where possible.
X. State Law Claims
State law claims such as fraud, abuse of process, or intentional infliction of
emotional distress may be pleaded in the alternative, but must be supported
by sufficient factual allegations.
XI. Claims for Relief
The complaint must clearly state the claims for relief, referencing the
statutory basis and the factual allegations supporting each claim.
XII. Damages
A prevailing civil RICO plaintiff is entitled to recover three times the actual
damages sustained, plus costs and reasonable attorney’s fees (Atkinson v.
Anadarko Bank and Trust Co. (5th Cir. 1987); Heden v. Hill (S.D. Tex. 1996)).
Punitive damages are not available, as treble damages are considered
punitive in nature. Restitution may be available as part of compensatory
damages, but not as a separate category.
XIII. Prayer for Relief
The prayer for relief should request treble damages, costs, and attorney’s
fees as mandated by statute. The Fifth Circuit does not permit private
plaintiffs to obtain injunctive relief under RICO (Fredeman Litigation, In re
(5th Cir. 1988)).
Exceptions and Caveats
Rule 9(b) Heightened Pleading: If the RICO claim is based on fraud
(e.g., wire or mail fraud), the complaint must meet the heightened
pleading standard of Rule 9(b), requiring particularity as to the
circumstances of the fraud (Arruda v. Curves Int'l, Inc. (W.D. Tex. July
27, 2020); Williams v. WMX Technologies, Inc. (5th Cir. 1997)).
No Injunctive Relief: The Fifth Circuit has held that private plaintiffs
cannot obtain injunctive relief in civil RICO actions (Fredeman
Litigation, In re (5th Cir. 1988)).
• 
• 

=== PAGE 21 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Standing: The plaintiff must show injury to business or property “by
reason of” a RICO violation; personal injuries are not compensable
under RICO (Crawford Arms, Inc. v. Waste Management of Miss. (S.D.
Miss. 1998)).
Subsequent Treatment: Some older authorities have been superseded
or vacated in part, but the core pleading standards and elements for
civil RICO claims remain consistent in the Fifth Circuit.
Conclusion
To properly plead a civil RICO claim in the Fifth Circuit, the complaint must
allege with factual specificity that a person engaged in a pattern of
racketeering activity connected to the conduct of an enterprise, and, where
fraud is a predicate act, must meet the heightened pleading standard of
Rule 9(b). Relief for a successful civil RICO plaintiff is limited to treble
damages, costs, and attorney’s fees, with no injunctive relief available to
private parties. Each element—person, pattern, racketeering activity,
enterprise, and injury—must be supported by well-pleaded facts, and the
complaint must show that the predicate acts are related and continuous, not
isolated or part of a single lawful endeavor. The factual timeline should be
carefully tied to each element, and the complaint must anticipate and
address potential defenses.
Legal Authorities
Zucker v. Farish, Civil Action No. 3:18-CV-01790-K (N.D. Tex. Dec 12, 2018)
U.S. District Court — Northern District of Texas
Extract
The complaint must allege sufficient facts to 'give the defendant fair notice'
of plaintiff's claims against the defendant. Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555. The
alleged facts must be facially plausible such that the facts nudge the
plaintiff's claims 'across the line from conceivable to plausible.' Id. at 570.
The court must view all facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.
Gonzalez v. Kay, 577 F.2d 600, 603 (5th Cir. 2009). When a plaintiff suffers
an injury because of a defendant's RICO violation, the plaintiff may bring a
civil RICO action. 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c) (2012). The RICO statute enumerates
four types of prohibited activities. 18 U.S.C. § 1962 (2012). To state a claim
based upon any four of the prohibited activities in § 1962, 'a plaintiff must
allege: 1) the conduct; 2) of an enterprise; 3) through a pattern; 4) of
racketeering activity.'
Summary
Standards for pleading a civil RICO claim in the Fifth Circuit. It emphasizes
that the complaint must provide sufficient facts to give the defendant fair
notice of the claims, and these facts must be plausible. The passage also
specifies the elements required to state a RICO claim: conduct of an
•

enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. This is applicable to
any civil RICO claim within the Fifth Circuit.
Atkinson v. Anadarko Bank and Trust Co., 808 F.2d 438 (5th Cir. 1987)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
This award was subject to trebling under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1964(c), which
provides that [a]ny person injured in his business or property by reason of a
violation of section 1962 ... shall recover threefold the damages he
sustains....
Summary
The passage provides insight into the types of relief available under a civil
RICO claim, specifically the provision for treble damages. This is a critical
aspect of relief in RICO cases, as it allows plaintiffs to recover three times
the amount of actual damages sustained due to the RICO violation. The
context of the passage is a court decision that interprets the statutory
language of the RICO Act, making it applicable to similar cases within the
Fifth Circuit.
Williams v. WMX Technologies, Inc., 112 F.3d 175 (5th Cir. 1997)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
The amended complaint alleged violations of RICO predicated on mail and
wire fraud, misrepresentations in violation of 10b-5, and state law claims of
fraud and negligent misrepresentation. We must decide if the amended
complaint was detailed enough to survive the motion to dismiss, an attack
leveled at all claims, resting as they do upon the same asserted 'fraud'.
Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b) applies to securities fraud and RICO claims resting on
allegations of fraud. Tuchman v. DSC Communications Corp., 14 F.3d 1061,
1068 (5th Cir.1994)(securities fraud); Tel-Phonic Serv., Inc. v. TBS Int'l, Inc.,
975 F.2d 1134, 1139 (5th Cir.1992)(RICO).
Summary
In the Fifth Circuit, RICO claims that are based on allegations of fraud must
meet the pleading standards of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b). This
rule requires that the circumstances constituting fraud be stated with
particularity. This means that the complaint must specify the fraudulent
statements, identify the speaker, state when and where the statements were
made, and explain why the statements were fraudulent. This standard is

=== PAGE 23 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
applicable to both federal and state law claims of fraud when they are based
on the same misrepresentations.
Bordelon v. Wells Fargo Fin. La., LLC, CIVIL ACTION No. 18-2563 SECTION
I (E.D. La. Jul 25, 2018)
U.S. District Court — Eastern District of Louisiana
Extract
The Wells Fargo defendants argue that Bordelon has failed to state a claim
under RICO because he has not demonstrated that the defendants were part
of an enterprise. Citing the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Boyle, the
Wells Fargo defendants assert that Bordelon has not established 'that this
alleged enterprise is (1) a continuing unit that (2) functions with a common
purpose.' In addition, they argue that activity occurring over the course of a
single lawsuit does not constitute a 'pattern of racketeering activity' because
that activity is part of a 'single lawful endeavor.' The Court agrees and
concludes that Bordelon's civil RICO claims against the Wells Fargo
defendants fail because Bordelon has not adequately alleged that the
defendants engaged in 'a pattern of racketeering activity' that is part of an
'enterprise.'
Summary
The passage highlights the necessity for a plaintiff to demonstrate that
defendants were part of an enterprise that functions as a continuing unit
with a common purpose. It also emphasizes that a single lawsuit does not
constitute a pattern of racketeering activity. This aligns with the Fifth
Circuit's standards for pleading a civil RICO claim, which requires showing a
pattern of racketeering activity and an enterprise.
Abraham v. Singh, 480 F.3d 351 (5th Cir. 2007)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
Plaintiffs allege that Defendants violated 18 U.S.C. § 1962(a), (b), (c), and
(d). These RICO subsections state, in their simplest terms, that: (a) a person
who has received income from a pattern of racketeering activity cannot
invest that income in an enterprise; (b) a person cannot acquire or maintain
an interest in an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering; (c) a person
who is employed by or associated with an enterprise cannot conduct the
affairs of the enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity; and (d) a
person cannot conspire to violate subsections (a), (b), or (c). ... Defendants
also contend that the Plaintiffs have failed to adequately allege violations of
the RICO subsections. See Crowe, 43 F.3d at 205. We agree that the

=== PAGE 24 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
complaint fails even the liberal pleading standard for subsections (a) and
(b), but Plaintiffs have adequately alleged violations of subsections (c) and
(d). ... Subsection (c) prohibits any 'person employed by or associated with
any enterprise' from participating in or conducting the affairs of the
enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. Crowe, 43 F.3d at 205
(emphasis in original). To state a claim under subsection (c), a plaintiff must
demonstrate, inter alia, that the RICO person is distinct from the RICO
enterprise. Id. at 205-06; Whelan, 319 F.3d at 229. In this case, Plaintiffs
have identified Chandler as the RICO person and Falcon Steel as the RICO
enterprise. This allegation is sufficient to demonstrate that the RICO person,
an individual employee of the corporation, is distinct from the RICO
enterprise, the corporation itself. ... Plaintiffs have also alleged that
Defendants conspired to violate § 1962(a), (b), and (c). '[B]ecause the core of
a RICO civil conspiracy is an agreement to commit predicate acts, a RICO
civil conspiracy complaint, at the very least, must allege specifically such an
agreement.' Crowe, 43 F.3d at 206 (quoting Tel-Phonic Servs., Inc. v. TBS
Int'l, Inc., 975 F.2d 1134, 1140 (5th Cir.1992)). Plaintiffs specifically alleged
that the Defendants entered into an agreement and that each agreed to
commit at least two predicate acts of racketeering. These allegations are
specific enough to state a claim that the Defendants conspired to violate §
1962(c).
Summary
The passage provides insight into the standards for pleading a civil RICO
claim in the Fifth Circuit. It outlines the requirements for alleging violations
under different subsections of 18 U.S.C. § 1962, emphasizing the need for
distinctness between the RICO person and the enterprise, and the necessity
of alleging an agreement to commit predicate acts for a RICO conspiracy
claim.
Word of Faith World Outreach Center Church, Inc. v. Sawyer, 90 F.3d 118
(5th Cir. 1996)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
The Church alleges the defendants violated 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) and (d) of
the Racketeer Influence and Corrupt Organization Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C. §§
1961-1968. Subsection 1962(c) prohibits persons employed by or associated
with any enterprise from conducting or participating in the enterprise's
affairs through a pattern of racketeering. Subsection 1962(d) prohibits a
conspiracy to violate 18 U.S.C. § 1962(a), (b), or (c). Under both subsections,
RICO claims require '1) a person who engages in 2) a pattern of
racketeering activity, 3) connected to the acquisition, establishment,
conduct, or control of an enterprise.'

=== PAGE 25 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
Basic elements required to plead a RICO claim in the Fifth Circuit: a person
must engage in a pattern of racketeering activity connected to the
acquisition, establishment, conduct, or control of an enterprise. This
provides a clear standard for what must be included in a RICO complaint.
The passage does not specifically address the types of relief available, but it
establishes the foundational elements necessary for a RICO claim, which is
essential for understanding how to plead such a claim.
Tel-Phonic Services, Inc. v. TBS Intern., Inc., 975 F.2d 1134 (5th Cir. 1992)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
The RICO predicate acts were mail and wire fraud. Compl. pp 51-53. The
district court dismissed the RICO claims, finding that Plaintiffs failed 'to
allege a continuous pattern of intentional acts designed to defraud the
plaintiffs' and failed 'to plead with particularity the requisite elements of
wire and mail fraud pursuant to Rule 9(b).' Mem. Op. Sept. 12, 1988 at 3, 4;
see Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b). Because the complaint insufficiently pleads a
continuous pattern of racketeering activity or an agreement to commit at
least two predicate acts of racketeering activity, we affirm the dismissal of
the RICO claims.
Summary
In the Fifth Circuit, a civil RICO complaint must allege a continuous pattern
of racketeering activity and must plead the elements of predicate acts, such
as wire and mail fraud, with particularity as required by Federal Rule of
Civil Procedure 9(b). This means that the complaint must specify the
circumstances constituting fraud in detail. The failure to do so can result in
the dismissal of the RICO claims.
Allstate Ins. Co. v. Donovan, CIVIL ACTION NO. H-12-0432 (S.D. Tex. Jul 03,
2012)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of Texas
Extract
Defendants argue that plaintiffs' RICO claims fail as a matter of law because
plaintiffs have not sufficiently alleged that defendants engaged in a pattern
of racketeering activity and have failed to plead fraud with particularity. 'A
pattern of racketeering activity consists of two or more predicate criminal
acts that are (1) related and (2) amount to or pose a threat of continued
criminal activity.' St. Germain, 556 F.3d at 263. See also 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5)

=== PAGE 26 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
('pattern of racketeering activity' requires at least two acts of racketeering
activity, one of which occurred after the effective date of this chapter and
the last of which occurred within ten years... after the commission of a prior
act of racketeering activity'). Predicate acts can be either state or federal
crimes. Id. Plaintiffs allege that defendants engaged in acts of mail fraud in
violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1841, which prohibits use of the mail to plan or
conduct fraudulent schemes. Plaintiffs' mail fraud allegations must be based
on facts capable of establishing: '(1) a scheme to defraud by means of false
or fraudulent representation, (2) interstate or intrastate use of the mails to
execute the scheme, (3) the use of the mails by the defendant connected
with [the] scheme, and (4) actual injury to the plaintiff.' In re Burzynski, 989
F.2d 733, 742 (5th Cir. 1993). '[A]lthough reliance is not an element of
statutory mail or wire fraud, [the Fifth Circuit has] required its showing
when mail or wire fraud is alleged as a RICO predicate.'
Summary
Requirements for pleading a civil RICO claim in the Fifth Circuit,
emphasizing the need to allege a pattern of racketeering activity, which
consists of at least two related predicate acts that pose a threat of continued
criminal activity. It also highlights the necessity of pleading fraud with
particularity, especially when mail or wire fraud is alleged as a RICO
predicate. The passage provides specific elements that must be established
for mail fraud, which is a common predicate act in RICO cases.
Fredeman Litigation, In re, 843 F.2d 821 (5th Cir. 1988)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
The plaintiff relies primarily, as did the district court, on the court's
'inherent' equitable power, arguing that RICO, a statute 'intended to provide
new [remedial] weapons of unprecedented scope,' cannot be read to
eliminate remedial powers that are standard and well-accepted, such as that
of issuing a preliminary injunction freezing assets to ensure satisfaction of a
potential judgment... Congress, of course, has the power to authorize
preliminary injunctions of this sort even though they would generally be
unavailable under traditional equitable principles. We therefore address the
question the district court did not: whether RICO authorizes injunctive relief
of this sort for a private plaintiff in his civil action for treble damages. We
conclude that it does not. The Ninth Circuit, the only court of appeals to
address this issue directly, has ruled in Religious Technology Center v.
Wollersheim that a private party may not obtain injunctive relief in a civil
RICO action.
Summary
While RICO provides for certain remedies, such as treble damages, it does
not authorize injunctive relief for private plaintiffs in civil RICO actions. This

is supported by the Ninth Circuit's decision in Religious Technology Center
v. Wollersheim, which the Fifth Circuit acknowledges.
Brown v. Protective Life Ins. Co., 353 F.3d 405 (5th Cir. 2003)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
RICO creates a civil cause of action for '[a]ny person injured in his business
or property by reason of a violation of section 1962.' 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c); see
also Beck v. Prupis, 529 U.S. 494, 120 S.Ct. 1608, 146 L.Ed.2d 561 (2000);
St. Paul Mercury Ins. Co. v. Williamson, 224 F.3d 425 (5th Cir. 2000). To
state a RICO claim under § 1962, 'there must be: `(1) a person who engages
in (2) a pattern of racketeering activity (3) connected to the acquisition,
establishment, conduct, or control of an enterprise.'
Summary
Basic requirements for pleading a civil RICO claim in the Fifth Circuit. It
specifies that a plaintiff must demonstrate an injury to business or property
due to a violation of section 1962. The elements required to state a RICO
claim include: (1) a person engaging in (2) a pattern of racketeering activity
(3) connected to the acquisition, establishment, conduct, or control of an
enterprise. This provides a clear framework for what must be alleged in a
civil RICO complaint.
Delta Truck & Tractor, Inc. v. J.I. Case Co., 855 F.2d 241 (5th Cir. 1988)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
The Racketeering, Influence and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18
U.S.C. Sec. 1961-1968, creates a civil cause of action under section 1964(c)
against those injured by violations of section 1962(a)-(d). The portions of
section 1962 relevant to this case can be abstracted as follows. Section
1962(a) makes it 'unlawful for any person who has received any income
derived ... from a pattern of racketeering activity ... to use or invest ... any
part of such income ... in acquisition of any interest in, or the establishment
or operation of, any enterprise.' Section 1962(b) makes it illegal 'for any
person through a pattern of racketeering activity ... to acquire or maintain ...
any interest in or control of any enterprise.'
Summary

related to income derived from racketeering and the acquisition or control
of enterprises through racketeering. This is relevant to understanding the
standards for pleading a civil RICO claim, as it highlights the types of
activities that are prohibited and actionable under the statute.
Crawford Arms, Inc. v. Waste Management of Miss., 23 F.Supp.2d 676 (S.D.
Miss. 1998)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of Mississippi
Extract
The RICO statute imposes civil and criminal liability on persons who use or
invest income derived from, acquire or maintain control of, or engage in the
conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity, or who
conspire to do any of these acts. 18 U.S.C. § 1962 (1988). Reduced to its
essential elements, a violation of § 1962 requires: '(1) a person who engages
in (2) a pattern of racketeering activity (3) connected to the acquisition,
establishment, conduct, or control of an enterprise.' Delta Truck & Tractor,
Inc. v. J.I. Case Co., 855 F.2d 241, 242 (5th Cir.1988). In addition, a RICO
plaintiff must have standing to sue pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c). '[T]he
plaintiff only has standing if, and can only recover to the extent that, he has
been injured in his business or property by the conduct constituting the
violation.' Sedima, S.P.R.L., v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479, 495-97, 105 S.Ct.
3275, 3284-85, 87 L.Ed.2d 346 (1985). The Civil RICO standing
requirement, found in § 1964(c), provides that only persons who have been
injured 'by reason of' the commission of predicate acts have standing to
bring suit. Sedima, 473 U.S. at 496, 105 S.Ct. 3275.
Summary
Essential elements required to plead a civil RICO claim in the Fifth Circuit,
which include demonstrating a pattern of racketeering activity connected to
an enterprise. It also emphasizes the standing requirement under 18 U.S.C.
§ 1964(c), which mandates that the plaintiff must have been injured in their
business or property by the conduct constituting the violation. This provides
a clear framework for what must be alleged in a civil RICO complaint in the
Fifth Circuit.
Mitchell Energy Corp. v. Martin, 616 F.Supp. 924 (S.D. Tex. 1985)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of Texas
Extract
Defendants' next RICO argument concerns the scope of § 1962. Defendants
claim that Plaintiffs' Complaint does not satisfy the requirements of showing
an injury 'by reason of § 1962.' Specifically, Defendants note that some

=== PAGE 29 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
courts have adopted a requirement that plaintiffs pressing a RICO claim
must establish a so-called 'racketeering injury' in order to have a cause of
action under the statute... Moreover, the imposition of a racketeering injury
requirement is a means to an end which the Fifth Circuit has rejected. The
courts which have imposed a racketeering injury requirement have done so
in order to limit the scope of RICO to activities involving organized crime...
The Court has examined the Complaint in the instant case and determined
that it satisfies Rule 9(b). The Complaint specifies a period of time during
which the alleged frauds were perpetrated, i.e., January, 1977 — November,
1982; the location, Houston; the nature of the fraud, kickbacks for payments
for goods and services which Plaintiff never received; and the parties
involved in the fraud, the Defendants.
Summary
The Fifth Circuit does not require a prior criminal conviction for predicate
acts in a RICO claim, nor does it require a "racketeering injury" beyond the
harm caused by the predicate acts themselves. The court emphasizes the
need for specificity in the complaint, as per Rule 9(b), detailing the time,
location, nature of the fraud, and parties involved.

U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
The complaint must provide the grounds entitling the Plaintiffs to relief,
'requir[ing] more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of
the elements of a cause of action will not do.' Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550
U.S. 544, 555 (2007). It must state a plausible claim for relief — one that
may be inferred from the complaint's factual allegations. Ashcroft v. Iqbal,
556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). Because Plaintiffs here rely on fraud as the
predicate act for RICO, their complaint is subject to the heightened pleading
standard of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b), requiring a plaintiff to
'state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud.' ... RICO
provides a private right of action, including 'threefold the damages' for
'[a]ny person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of
section 1962 of this chapter.' 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c). The 'by reason of'
language requires a plaintiff to show the defendant's violation was a but-for
cause and a proximate cause of the plaintiff's injury.
Summary
Pleading standards for a civil RICO complaint, emphasizing the need for a
plausible claim supported by factual allegations, especially when fraud is the
predicate act. It also highlights the requirement for particularity in fraud
claims under Rule 9(b) and explains the types of relief available, including
treble damages, under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c).

Smoky Greenhaw Cotton Co., Inc. v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and
Smith, Inc., 785 F.2d 1274 (5th Cir. 1986)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C.
Secs. 1961-1968, provides plaintiffs with a private civil action to recover
treble damages for injury 'by reason of a violation of [18 U.S.C.] section
1962.' 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1964(c). Among the activities that constitute violations
of Sec. 1962 is the conducting of an enterprise through a pattern of
racketeering activity. 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1962(c). RICO defines 'racketeering
activity' to include, among others, any act 'indictable' under numerous
federal criminal provisions, including mail and wire fraud (so-called
'predicate acts').

Heden v. Hill, 937 F.Supp. 1230 (S.D. Tex. 1996)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of Texas
Extract
In 1970, Congress enacted RICO as Title IX of the Organized Crime Control
Act to combat organized crime through both criminal prosecutions and
private actions. See 18 U.S.C. § 1961 et seq. The 'legislative history
forcefully supports the view that the major purpose of Title IX is to address
the infiltration of legitimate business by organized crime.' United States v.
Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 591, 101 S.Ct. 2524, 2532, 69 L.Ed.2d 246 (1981). A
private right of action is provided under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c), which states in
pertinent part: 'Any person injured in his business or property by reason of a
violation of section 1962 of this chapter may sue therefor in any appropriate
United States district court and shall recover threefold the damages he
sustains and the cost of the suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee.'
Summary
The passage provides insight into the legislative intent behind RICO and the
specific provision that allows for a private right of action. It highlights that
individuals injured in their business or property due to a RICO violation can
seek relief in federal court. The relief includes treble damages, costs of the
suit, and reasonable attorney's fees. This aligns with the standards for
pleading claims for relief in a civil RICO complaint in the Fifth Circuit.

Summary
To plead a civil RICO claim in the Fifth Circuit, a plaintiff must demonstrate
standing by showing a direct, concrete, and particularized injury to business
or property, proximately caused by the defendant's conduct. Personal
injuries are insufficient for RICO standing. The passage also outlines the
types of prohibited activities under RICO, which include using income
derived from racketeering to acquire an interest in an enterprise,
maintaining an interest in an enterprise through racketeering, conducting
an enterprise through racketeering, and conspiring to violate these
provisions.
Verges v. Babovich, 644 F.Supp. 150 (E.D. La. 1986)
U.S. District Court — Eastern District of Louisiana
Extract
Defendants say that the RICO claim is deficient in three essential respects:
1) failure to allege a 'pattern of racketeering activity'; 2) failure to allege,
with the requisite specificity, predicate acts by each defendant, a conspiracy,
and an interstate nexus; and, 3) failure to allege fraud with particularity, as
required by F.R.C.P. 9(b). Further, defendants assert that without an
independent jurisdictional basis, the pendent claims should be dismissed for
want of subject matter jurisdiction... The Court concludes that the complaint
adequately alleges a 'pattern of racketeering activity'. Indeed, although use
of RICO often results in abuse, this complaint clearly alleges the stuff of
RICO... A RICO conspiracy requires proof of an agreement among
defendants 'to participate, directly or indirectly, in the affairs of an
enterprise through the commission of two or more predicate crimes'.
Summary
Necessary elements for a civil RICO claim in the Fifth Circuit, including the
need to allege a pattern of racketeering activity, specific predicate acts, a
conspiracy, and an interstate nexus. It also highlights the requirement to
allege fraud with particularity under F.R.C.P. 9(b). The passage further
explains that a RICO conspiracy requires proof of an agreement among
defendants to participate in the affairs of an enterprise through predicate
crimes.

RICO requires a showing that (1) a person that engages in (2) a pattern of
racketeering activity, (3) connected to the acquisition, establishment,
conduct, or control of an enterprise. Crowe v. Henry, 43 F.3d 198, 204 (5th
Cir.1995) (quoting Delta Truck & Tractor, Inc. v. J.I. Case Co., 855 F.2d 241

racketeering must have at least a minimal nexus with interstate commerce.
R.A.G.S. Couture, Inc. v. Hyatt, 774 F.2d 1350, 1353 (5th Cir.1985).
Summary
In the Fifth Circuit, a civil RICO complaint must demonstrate that a person
engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity connected to the acquisition,
establishment, conduct, or control of an enterprise. Additionally, there must
be a minimal nexus with interstate commerce. This provides a foundational
standard for pleading a RICO claim in this jurisdiction.
Arruda v. Curves Int'l, Inc., CIVIL NO. 6:20-cv-00092-ADA (W.D. Tex. Jul 27,
2020)
U.S. District Court — Western District of Texas
Extract
RICO provides a private civil action to recover damages for injury to one's
business or property by the conduct constituting the violation. To state a §
1962(c) civil RICO claim, a plaintiff must allege: (1) conduct (2) of an
enterprise (3) through a pattern of racketeering activity. See, e.g., Sealima
SPRL v. Imrex, Co., 473 U.S. 479, 496 (1985). An act of 'racketeering
activity,' commonly referred as a 'predicate act,' is defined to include
criminal acts such as mail and wire fraud... RICO claims based on
allegations of fraud, such as wire or mail fraud, are subject to the
heightened pleading burden imposed by Rule 9(b). See, e.g., Williams v.
WMX Technologies, Inc., 112 F.3d 175, 177 (5th Cir. 1997). Rule 9(b)
requires particularity in pleading the circumstances constituting fraud; this
requirement applies to the pleading of fraud as a predicate act in a RICO
claim. Tel-Phonic Servs., Inc. v. TBS Int'l, Inc., 975 F.2d 1134, 1138 (5th Cir.
1992). 'At a minimum, Rule 9(b) requires allegations of the particulars of
time, place, and contents of the false representations, as well as the identity
of the person making the misrepresentation and what he obtained thereby.'
Id. at 1139.
Summary
To plead a civil RICO claim under § 1962(c) in the Fifth Circuit, a plaintiff
must allege conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering
activity. Predicate acts, such as mail and wire fraud, must be pled with
particularity under Rule 9(b), which requires details about the time, place,

=== PAGE 35 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
and contents of the false representations, as well as the identity of the
person making the misrepresentation and what was obtained. This ensures
that the allegations are specific and detailed, meeting the heightened
pleading standard for fraud-related claims.

state a claim under the civil RICO statute, a plaintiff must allege (1) an
injury to plaintiff's business or property from (2) defendant's violation of one
or more provisions of 18 U.S.C. § 1962. Section 1962 has four subsections: §§
1962(a)-(d). Plaintiffs allege civil RICO violations under three subsections: §
1962(b) (taking control of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering
activity); § 1962(c) (conducting an enterprise's affairs through a pattern of
racketeering activity); and § 1962(d) (here, conspiring to violate subsections

Extract
Under Rule 8, a plaintiff must provide a 'short and plain statement showing
that the pleader is entitled to relief.' Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2). To defeat a 12(b)(6)
motion, the plaintiff must allege 'sufficient factual matter, accepted as true,
to state a claim for relief that is plausible on its face.' George v. SI Grp., Inc.,
36 F.4th 611, 619 (5th Cir. 2022) (quoting Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662,
678 (2009)). A complaint plausibly states a claim for relief when it 'allows
the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for
the misconduct alleged.' Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (citing Bell Atl. Corp. v.
Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 556 (2007)). 'Plausibility,' at the Rule 12(b)(6) stage,
does not mean 'possibility.' Id. at 679. A complaint that offers bare legal
conclusions, unsupported by well-pleaded factual allegations tending to
establish a plausible basis for relief, must be dismissed. See id. at 679-80
(citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at 551, 555, 565-67, 570) (explaining that legal

Summary
Pleading standards under Rule 8 and Rule 12(b)(6) in the Fifth Circuit,
emphasizing the need for a complaint to contain sufficient factual matter to
state a plausible claim for relief. It highlights that mere legal conclusions
without factual support are insufficient, and the court must be able to draw
a reasonable inference of liability from the facts presented.
Rodriguez v. Meta Platforms, Inc.

=== PAGE 38 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
Although the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act (“RICO”)
recognizes a civil RICO claim,[] and Plaintiff cites to RICO, he fails to
identify which of the four substantive violations he asserts. See 18 U.S.C. §
1962(a)-(d). The elements required to state a claim vary according to the
particular RICO claim asserted.[] Regardless of which of the four RICO
sections Plaintiff relies upon, three threshold elements must be met.[] The
defendant must be (1) a person who engages in (2) a pattern of racketeering
activity (3) connected to the acquisition, establishment, conduct, or control
of an enterprise.[] A pattern of racketeering activity consists of two or more
predicate acts, federal or state, that are (1) related and (2) amount to or
pose a threat of continued criminal activity.
Summary
Basic pleading requirements for a civil RICO claim in the Fifth Circuit,
emphasizing the need to identify the specific RICO violation and establish
the three threshold elements: a person, a pattern of racketeering activity,
and a connection to an enterprise. It also highlights the necessity of
demonstrating a pattern of racketeering activity through related predicate
acts that pose a threat of continued criminal activity.

Gentilello v. Rege, 627 F.3d 540, 544 (5th Cir. 2010) (quoting Doe v.
MySpace, Inc., 528 F.3d 413, 418 (5th Cir. 2008)). To avoid dismissal, a
plaintiff must plead sufficient facts to 'state a claim for relief that is
plausible on its face.' Id. (quoting Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1949). 'A claim has
facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the
court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the
misconduct alleged.' Id. The Court does not accept as true 'conclusory
allegations, unwarranted factual inferences, or legal conclusions.' Id.
(quoting Plotkin v. IP Axess, Inc., 407 F.3d 690, 696 (5th Cir. 2005)). Legal
conclusions must be supported by factual allegations. Id. (quoting Iqbal, 129
S. Ct. at 1950).
Summary
The passage provides insight into the pleading standards for civil RICO
claims in the Fifth Circuit. It emphasizes that a complaint must state a claim
for relief that is plausible on its face, supported by factual content that
allows the court to infer liability. Conclusory allegations and unwarranted
inferences are insufficient. This standard is crucial for determining whether
a RICO claim can proceed past the motion to dismiss stage.

RICO is also more than a criminal statute. When drafting the legislation,
Congress incorporated provisions in RICO that allow private plaintiffs to
seek redress in federal court. If their lawsuit succeeds, the statute provides
a big payout: Plaintiffs are entitled to triple damages, court costs, and
attorney's fees. 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c). Even so, pursuing that recovery is often
a challenging undertaking. Problems typically arise at the pleadings stage,
as courts are hesitant to find RICO violations, and plaintiffs have difficulty
alleging them.
Summary
The passage provides insight into the standards for pleading a civil RICO
claim, highlighting the difficulty plaintiffs face at the pleadings stage due to
the courts' hesitance to find RICO violations. It also outlines the types of
relief available under RICO, including triple damages, court costs, and
attorney's fees.

Extract
Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2), a complaint must contain 'a
short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to
relief.' Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2). Rule 12(b)(6) authorizes a court to dismiss a
plaintiff's complaint for 'failure to state a claim upon which relief can be
granted.' Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). In considering a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to
dismiss, '[t]he court accepts all well-pleaded facts as true, viewing them in
the light most favorable to the plaintiff.' In re Katrina Canal Breaches Litig.,
495 F.3d 191, 205 (5th Cir. 2007). But the court will 'not look beyond the
face of the pleadings to determine whether relief should be granted based
on the alleged facts.' Spivey v. Robertson, 197 F.3d 772, 774 (5th Cir. 1999).
In order to survive a motion to dismiss, a plaintiff must plead 'enough facts
to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.' Bell Atl. Corp. v.
Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007). 'Threadbare recitals of the elements of a
cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice.'
Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). 'A claim has facial plausibility
when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the
reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.'
Id. 'The plausibility standard is not akin to a ‘probability requirement,’ but it
asks for more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.'
Id. (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556).
Summary
Standards for pleading claims for relief in a civil RICO complaint in the Fifth
Circuit. It emphasizes the requirement for a complaint to contain a "short
and plain statement of the claim" and to state a claim that is "plausible on its
face." The court must accept all well-pleaded facts as true and view them in
the light most favorable to the plaintiff. However, the court will not look
beyond the face of the pleadings. The passage also highlights that
threadbare recitals and conclusory statements are insufficient, and the claim
must allow the court to draw a reasonable inference of liability.
Gordon v. Neugebauer
Extract
To state a valid claim upon which relief can be granted under § 1962(c), a
plaintiff must allege facts that show (1) a person who engages in (2) a
pattern of racketeering activity, (3) connected to the acquisition,
establishment, conduct, or control of an enterprise. See In re Burzynski, 989
F.2d 733, 741-42 (5th Cir. 1993); Paul v. Aviva Life & Annuity Co., 3:09-
CV-1490-B, 2010 WL 5105925, at *3 (N.D. Tex. Dec. 14, 2010). To establish
the second element of a § 1962(c) claim—a pattern of racketeering activity—
a plaintiff must allege facts that show (1) the violation of two or more
'predicate acts' of racketeering activity enumerated in 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1),
and (2) that the predicate acts form a pattern because they are related to
each other and they have continuity. See Burzynski, 989 F.2d at 742;

Summary
Necessary elements to plead a civil RICO claim under § 1962(c) in the Fifth
Circuit, which includes showing a person engaged in a pattern of

activity' in violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations
Act ('RICO'), 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961-1968. (R. Doc. 1 at 22). To recover under
RICO, the plaintiff must establish three elements: (1) a person who engages
in (2) a pattern of racketeering activity (3) connected to the acquisition,
establishment, conduct, or control of an enterprise. Abraham v. Singh, 480 F.

Extract
To survive a motion to dismiss, a plaintiff must plead 'enough facts to state a
claim to relief that is plausible on its face.' Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550
U.S. 544, 570 (2007). To meet this 'facial plausibility' standard, a plaintiff
must 'plead[ ] factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable
inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.' Ashcroft v.
Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). 'Threadbare recitals of the elements of a
cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice.'
Id. 'The plausibility standard... asks for more than a sheer possibility that a
defendant has acted unlawfully.' Id. Thus, a claim 'is implausible on its face
when 'the well-pleaded facts do not permit the court to infer more than the
mere possibility of misconduct.'' Harold H. Huggins Realty, Inc. v. FNC, Inc.,
634 F.3d 787, 796 (5th Cir. 2011) (quoting Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679); see also
Inclusive Communities Project, 920 F.3d at 899.
Summary
Standard for pleading claims for relief in a civil RICO complaint in the Fifth
Circuit. It emphasizes the need for a complaint to contain enough factual
content to make a claim plausible on its face, rather than relying on mere
conclusory statements. This standard is derived from the Supreme Court
cases Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly and Ashcroft v. Iqbal, which are widely
applicable in federal civil litigation, including RICO cases.

The non-fraud aspects of the plaintiff’s claim are not subject to Rule 9(b).
See, e.g., D. Penguin Bros. v. City Nat’l Bank, 2014 U.S. App. LEXIS 19909
(2d Cir. Oct. 16, 2014) ('In the RICO context, a plaintiff must plead predicate
acts sounding in fraud or mistake according to the particularity requirement
of Rule 9(b); for other elements of a RICO claim—such as non-fraud
predicate acts or . . . the existence of an ‘enterprise’—a plaintiff’s complaint
need satisfy only the ‘short and plain statement’ standard of Rule 8(a). . . .
Nevertheless, to survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, a plaintiff must
offer ‘more than labels and conclusions’ in pleading the non-fraud conduct,
plaintiffs must comply with Rule 9(b)').

Summary
In the context of a RICO claim, the plaintiff must plead predicate acts that
sound in fraud with particularity according to Rule 9(b). However, for other
elements of a RICO claim, such as non-fraud predicate acts or the existence
of an enterprise, the complaint need only satisfy the 'short and plain
statement' standard of Rule 8(a). This means that while fraud-related
elements require detailed pleading, other elements do not. This is relevant
to understanding the standards for pleading claims for relief in a civil RICO
complaint.

Sedima teaches that 'the compensable injury necessarily is the harm caused
by predicate acts sufficiently related to constitute a pattern.' Sedima,
S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479, 497 (1985). This might appear to lead to
the conclusion that the plaintiff must be injured by each predicate act
forming the pattern. That conclusion would be incorrect. The classic
illustration: a hoodlum extorts 'protection' money from each of several
shopkeepers. To state a pattern, it may be necessary for any one plaintiff
shopkeeper to allege the defendant’s extortion of others as well. But the
plaintiff will not have been injured by the defendant’s extortion of others.
(That this hypothetical states a viable RICO claim is certain because it is
drawn from the Supreme Court’s opinion in H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell
Telephone Co., 492 U.S. 229, 242 (1989).) Additionally, any individual
predicate act may fizzle and, to no credit of the defendant, not cause the
harm intended. The unsuccessful predicate acts are viable components of
the plaintiff’s pattern as well. As long as the pattern of racketeering activity
has caused harm to the plaintiff’s business or property, the plaintiff has
RICO standing. The plaintiff is not obliged to plead or prove that it has been
injured by multiple predicate acts, as long as it has been injured by at least
one predicate act: '[N]o requirement exists that the plaintiff must suffer an
injury from two or more predicate acts, or from all of the predicate acts.
Thus, a RICO verdict can be sustained when a pattern of racketeering acts
existed, but when only one act caused injury.'
Summary
In a civil RICO complaint, the plaintiff must demonstrate that they have
suffered harm to their business or property due to a pattern of racketeering
activity. However, the plaintiff does not need to show injury from each
predicate act; it is sufficient if at least one predicate act caused harm. This
aligns with the broader understanding of RICO claims, where the focus is on
the pattern of activity rather than individual acts.

Extract
RICO is not just a tool for government control over organized crime. It is
also a remedial statute for civil matters. (31) It 'authorize[s]... criminal or
civil remedies on conduct already criminal, when performed in a specified
fashion' as delineated by the statute. (32) Section 1962 provides civil
remedies for four types of conduct: (1) using income derived from a pattern
of racketeering activity (33) to acquire an interest in an enterprise; (2)
acquiring or maintaining an interest in an enterprise through a pattern of
racketeering activity; (3) conducting the affairs of an enterprise through a
pattern of racketeering activity; and (4) conspiring to commit any of these
offenses. (34) Today, Congress urges courts to construe RICO liberally from
the 'perspective of the victim, not the perpetrator.' (35) A private civil right
of action in [section] 1964 provides that '[a]ny person injured in his business
or property by reason of a violation of section 1962... may sue.' (36) Notably,
a successful plaintiff under [section] 1964 is entitled to treble damages and
the cost of the suit, including attorney fees. (37) The threat of treble
damages encourages plaintiffs to bring claims and discourages entities from
engaging in illegal activities.
Summary
Clear overview of the types of conduct that can lead to civil remedies under
RICO, as outlined in Section 1962. It also highlights the liberal construction
of RICO from the victim's perspective and the types of relief available,
including treble damages and attorney fees. This information is applicable to
civil RICO claims in general, including those in the Fifth Circuit.

RICO CONSPIRACY The essence of a RICO conspiracy is the existence of an
agreement to violate RICO's substantive provisions. RICO conspiracy was
established by proof of: (a) of an agreement to join a racketeering scheme,
(b) of the defendant's knowing engagement in the scheme with the intent
that its overall goals be effectuated, and (c) that the scheme involved, or by
agreement between any members of the conspiracy was intended to involve,
two or more predicate acts of racketeering. Predicate Acts of Extortion. The
Court concluded that the Government proved beyond a reasonable doubt
that Smith and other members of the Enterprise agreed to, and in fact did,
commit predicate acts of Hobbs Act extortion on numerous occasions during
the specified period as part of a larger pattern of racketeering activity.
Summary
Elements necessary to establish a RICO conspiracy, which includes an
agreement to join a racketeering scheme, knowing engagement with intent
to effectuate the scheme's goals, and involvement in two or more predicate
acts. This is relevant to understanding the standards for pleading a RICO
claim, as it highlights the need to demonstrate an agreement and the
commission of predicate acts.

In Swierkeiewicz the Supreme Court rejected the Second Circuit's
imposition of a heightened pleading standard that had required the plaintiff
to plead a prima facie case of discrimination under McDonnell Douglas v.
Green, 411 U.S. 792, in order to survive the employer's 12(b) motion to
dismiss. In doing so, the Court explained that 'the prima facie case under
McDonnell Douglas is an evidentiary standard, not a pleading requirement.'
Swierkeiewicz, 534 U.S. at 510. 'Furthermore, imposing the Court of
Appeals' heightened pleading standard in employment discrimination cases
conflicts with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a), which provides that a
complaint must include only 'a short and plain statement of the claim
showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.' Such a statement must simply
'give the defendant fair notice of what the plaintiff's claim is and the
grounds upon which it rests.' 534 U.S. at 512 (citation... decision in Bell
Atlantic nor subsequent Supreme Court decisions depart from
Swierkeiewicz's rejection of a heightened pleading requirement in order to

'Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a) requires only 'a short and plain
statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief,' in order
to 'give the defendant fair notice of what the... claim is and the grounds
upon which it rests.' 550 U.S. at 555.
Summary
The passage emphasizes that the Supreme Court has rejected heightened
pleading standards in favor of the more lenient standard set by Federal Rule
of Civil Procedure 8(a), which requires only a "short and plain statement of

civil cases, including RICO complaints, ensuring that plaintiffs are not
required to plead detailed evidentiary facts at the motion to dismiss stage.

To prove a violation of Section 1962(c), a plaintiff must prove the following
elements: * Existence of an enterprise; * The enterprise engaged in, or its
activities affected, interstate or foreign commerce; * The defendant was
employed by or was associated with the enterprise; * The defendant
conducted or participated, either directly or indirectly, in the conduct of the
affairs of the enterprise; and * The defendant participated in the affairs of
the enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of
unlawful debt.

he or she has suffered an 'injury in fact' that is: concrete; particularised; and
actual or imminent; the injury was likely caused by the defendant; and the
injury would likely be redressed by judicial relief. If 'the plaintiff does not
claim to have suffered an injury that the defendant caused and the court can

Summary
Requirements for a plaintiff to establish standing in federal court, which is a
prerequisite for any civil action, including a RICO claim. The plaintiff must
demonstrate an 'injury in fact' that is concrete, particularized, and actual or
imminent. Additionally, the injury must be causally linked to the defendant's
actions and must be redressable by the court. These elements are essential
for a RICO claim, as the plaintiff must show that the alleged racketeering
activity caused a direct injury to their business or property, and that the
court can provide a remedy.
Defending Civil RICO Claims: A Defense Plan Should Be In Every Business's
Arsenal
Extract
First, to bring a civil RICO claim, a plaintiff must demonstrate that their
business or property was injured as a result of a RICO violation. In other
words, there must be some sort of concrete financial loss directly flowing
from the purported violation to support a RICO claim. Thus, if a plaintiff
does not have a concrete financial loss, then the RICO claim must be
dismissed. Asserting personal injuries, such as emotion distress, is
insufficient. Second, to prove most types of RICO claims, the plaintiff must
plead that the defendant committed some qualifying criminal action, the
most common of which is mail, wire or securities fraud. Business deals gone
sour do not count. Rather, the plaintiff must be able to prove the elements of
the asserted crime, and often an intent to defraud. If there is nothing
criminal in nature about the complained-of conduct, RICO should not apply.
It is an abuse of the RICO statute to attempt to shoehorn ordinary business
or contractual disputes into a civil RICO claim. Third, the plaintiff must
plead a pattern of racketeering activity for most RICO claims. If the alleged
conduct occurred once or twice, or was not continuous, it cannot form a
pattern of conduct sufficient to support a RICO claim. And oftentimes,
because there is a fraud component, those instances must be particularly
identified in the plaintiff's pleading—a barrier that can prove difficult to
accomplish.
