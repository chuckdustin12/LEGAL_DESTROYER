Question
Under what statutes should a father seek relief for mail fraud in a RICO suit
against his spouse, his spouse's grandmother, and his spouse's stepfather?
Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
A father seeking relief for mail fraud in a RICO suit against his spouse and
her relatives should primarily rely on 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c), which provides a
civil remedy for violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1962, while using 18 U.S.C. § 1341
(mail fraud) as the predicate act establishing a pattern of racketeering
activity.
Summary
To pursue a civil RICO claim based on mail fraud against family members,
the father should primarily rely on four key statutes: 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c),
which provides the civil remedy; 18 U.S.C. § 1962(a)-(d), which defines the
prohibited racketeering activities; 18 U.S.C. § 1961, which defines
racketeering activity to include mail fraud; and 18 U.S.C. § 1341, which is
the mail fraud statute itself. Together, these statutes create the legal
framework that allows private individuals to seek relief, including treble
damages, attorney's fees, and costs, when they can prove they were injured
by a pattern of racketeering activity that includes mail fraud.
Successfully establishing a civil RICO claim requires the father to
demonstrate several elements: (1) that the defendants conducted (2) an
enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity (mail fraud) that
(5) caused injury to his business or property. The father must specifically
establish that the defendants engaged in a scheme to defraud and used the
U.S. mail system to execute that scheme. Additionally, he must demonstrate
that these acts were part of a pattern of racketeering activity - requiring at
least two predicate acts of mail fraud within a ten-year period - and that the
defendants were associated with an "enterprise" affecting interstate
commerce.
Background and Relevant Legislative
Framework
Primary RICO Statutes
18 U.S.C. § 1964(c): Civil Remedies
The starting point for any civil RICO claim is 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c), which
provides the private right of action: "Any person injured in his business or

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
property by reason of a violation of section 1962 of this chapter may sue
therefor in any appropriate United States district court and shall recover
threefold the damages he sustains and the cost of the suit, including a
reasonable attorney's fee..."
This provision is essential because it creates the mechanism by which a
father could seek relief against his spouse, his spouse's grandmother, and
his spouse's stepfather for alleged mail fraud conducted as part of a pattern
of racketeering activity. The statute allows for treble damages (three times
the actual damages sustained) and recovery of legal costs, making it a
potentially powerful remedy.
18 U.S.C. § 1962: Prohibited Activities
18 U.S.C. § 1962 defines the prohibited activities under RICO. This statute
contains four subsections, each addressing a different type of racketeering
conduct:
§ 1962(a) prohibits using income derived from a pattern of racketeering
activity to acquire an interest in or establish an enterprise affecting
interstate commerce.
§ 1962(b) prohibits acquiring or maintaining an interest in an
enterprise affecting interstate commerce through a pattern of
racketeering activity.
§ 1962(c) prohibits conducting or participating in the conduct of an
enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity when the
enterprise affects interstate commerce.
§ 1962(d) prohibits conspiring to violate subsections (a), (b), or (c).
Of these provisions, § 1962(c) is the most commonly used in civil RICO
claims, as noted in Defending Civil RICO Claims: A Defense Plan Should Be
In Every Business's Arsenal (2022): "There are four types of activities
outlawed by RICO, and claims under Section 1962(c) are the most commonly
asserted."
The key language in § 1962(c) states: "It shall be unlawful for any person
employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities
of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate,
directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a
pattern of racketeering activity."
18 U.S.C. § 1961: Definitions
18 U.S.C. § 1961 provides critical definitions for RICO claims. Most
importantly for the question at hand, § 1961(1) defines "racketeering
activity" to include "any act which is indictable under any of the following
provisions of title 18, United States Code: ... section 1341 (relating to mail
fraud)." This explicitly confirms that mail fraud qualifies as a predicate act
for establishing a pattern of racketeering activity.
Additionally, § 1961(5) defines a "pattern of racketeering activity" as
requiring "at least two acts of racketeering activity, one of which occurred
• 
• 
• 
• 

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
after the effective date of this chapter and the last of which occurred within
ten years (excluding any period of imprisonment) after the commission of a
prior act of racketeering activity."
As explained by the Supreme Court in Inc v. Northwestern Bell Telephone
Company, 492 U.S. 229 (1989): "Racketeering activity is defined in RICO to
mean 'any act or threat involving' specified state-law crimes, any 'act'
indictable under various specified federal statutes, and certain federal
'offenses,' 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1) (1982 ed., Supp. V); but of the term 'pattern'
the statute says only that it 'requires at least two acts of racketeering
activity' within a 10-year period, 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5)."
18 U.S.C. § 1341: Mail Fraud Statute
18 U.S.C. § 1341, the mail fraud statute, serves as the predicate act
underlying the RICO claim. The key elements of mail fraud are defined in
this statute:
"Whoever, having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to
defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent
pretenses, representations, or promises... for the purpose of executing such
scheme or artifice or attempting so to do, places in any post office or
authorized depository for mail matter, any matter or thing whatever to be
sent or delivered by the Postal Service... shall be fined under this title or
imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both."
This statute criminalizes the use of U.S. mail to execute fraudulent schemes.
When such activity forms a pattern and is conducted through an enterprise,
it can serve as the basis for a RICO claim.
Secondary RICO-Related Statutes
While the above statutes form the core legal framework for a civil RICO
claim based on mail fraud, several other statutes may be relevant depending
on the specific facts of the case:
18 U.S.C. § 1963: This statute addresses criminal penalties for RICO
violations, which, while not directly applicable to a civil case,
demonstrates the seriousness with which Congress views RICO
violations.
18 U.S.C. § 1952: This statute, commonly known as the Travel Act,
prohibits using interstate facilities, including mail, to promote or carry
out unlawful activities. It could potentially provide an additional
predicate act if the defendants used mail for unlawful purposes beyond
fraud.
18 U.S.C. § 1708: This statute addresses theft or receipt of stolen mail,
which might be relevant if any mail theft occurred as part of the alleged
scheme.
• 
• 
• 

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
39 U.S.C. § 3005: This statute addresses false representations
conducted through mail and authorizes the Postal Service to take action
against such schemes.
18 U.S.C. § 1702: This statute prohibits obstruction of correspondence,
which might be relevant if any mail was intercepted as part of the
alleged scheme.
Case Law Interpreting the RICO Framework
Several key cases provide guidance on how the RICO statutes should be
applied to civil claims involving mail fraud.
Elements of a Civil RICO Claim
The basic elements of a civil RICO claim are consistently described across
multiple cases. As stated in Norfe Grp. Corp. v. R.Y. Espinosa Inc., Civil No.
19-1897 (BJM) (D. P.R. May 07, 2021):
"RICO liability breaks down to four essential elements: '(1) conduct (2) of an
enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity.' Sedima,
S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479, 496 (1985)."
Similarly, Uselmann v. Pop, 495 F.Supp.3d 528 (E.D. Mich. 2020) specifies:
"To state a RICO cause of action, a plaintiff must establish four elements: (1)
conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity."
For a more comprehensive breakdown, Arizona Premium Finance, Inc. v.
Bielli, 77 F.Supp.2d 341 (E.D. N.Y. 1999) explains:
"To state a claim for damages under RICO a plaintiff has two pleading
burdens. First, he must allege that the defendant has violated the
substantive RICO statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1962 (1976), commonly known as
'criminal RICO.' In so doing, he must allege the existence of seven
constituent elements: (1) that the defendant (2) through the commission of
two or more acts (3) constituting a 'pattern' (4) of 'racketeering activity' (5)
directly or indirectly invests in, or maintains an interest in, or participates in
(6) an 'enterprise' (7) the activities of which affect interstate or foreign
commerce.... Plaintiff must allege adequately defendant's violation of section
1962 before turning to the second burden — i.e., invoking RICO's civil
remedies of treble damages, attorneys fees and costs...."
Mail Fraud as a Predicate Act
Multiple cases confirm that mail fraud can serve as a predicate act for RICO
claims. In Boneta v. Rolex Watch USA, Inc., 232 F.Supp.3d 354 (S.D. N.Y.
2017), the court stated:
• 
• 

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
"'Racketeering activity' can comprise a variety of offenses including, as
relevant here, mail fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1341 and wire fraud under 18
U.S.C. § 1343. See 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1)."
Williams v. Aztar Indiana Gaming Corp., 351 F.3d 294 (7th Cir. 2003)
provides more detail on this connection:
"To invoke federal question jurisdiction, Williams alleged a violation of the
federal RICO statute by virtue of mail fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1341. See 18
U.S.C. § 1961(1)(B). The viability of Williams's RICO claim turns on whether
he has established a pattern of racketeering activity, which is an essential
element of a claim under the RICO statute..."
Elements of Mail Fraud
The elements of mail fraud, which must be established to use it as a
predicate act, are detailed in several cases. Norfe Grp. Corp. v. R.Y. Espinosa
Inc., Civil No. 19-1897 (BJM) (D. P.R. May 07, 2021) explains:
"Mail fraud 'occurs whenever a person, 'having devised or intending to
devise any scheme or artifice to defraud,' uses the mail 'for the purpose of
executing such scheme or artifice or attempting so to do.' Bridge v. Phoenix
Bond & Indem. Co., 553 U.S. 639, 647 (2008) (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 1341)."
Williams v. Aztar Indiana Gaming Corp., 351 F.3d 294 (7th Cir. 2003)
provides a more structured definition:
"The elements of mail fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1341 are: '(1) the defendant's
participation in a scheme to defraud; (2) defendant's commission of the act
with intent to defraud; and (3) use of the mails in furtherance of the
fraudulent scheme.'"
Hall v. Witteman, 569 F.Supp.2d 1208 (D. Kan. 2008) offers a similar
formulation:
"To establish the predicate act of mail fraud [the plaintiff] must allege '(1)
the existence of a scheme or artifice to defraud or obtain money or property
by false pretenses, representations or promises, and (2) use of the United
States mails for the purpose of executing the scheme.'"
No Reliance Requirement for RICO Mail Fraud Claims
An important legal principle clarified by the Supreme Court is that a plaintiff
bringing a RICO claim based on mail fraud does not need to prove reliance
on the fraudulent representations. As stated in Bridge v. Phoenix Bond &
Indem. Co., 553 U.S. 639 (2008):
"A plaintiff asserting a RICO claim predicated on mail fraud need not show,
either as an element of its claim or as a prerequisite to establishing
proximate causation, that it relied on the defendant's alleged
misrepresentations."

This is a significant advantage in a family-related RICO claim, as it
eliminates the need to prove direct reliance on any fraudulent
communications.
Administrative Decisions Supporting RICO
Claims Based on Mail Fraud
Several administrative decisions provide additional support for using mail
fraud as the basis for a RICO claim.
Feldman v. Risk Placement Servs., Inc. (2021) reaffirms the definition of mail
fraud:
"Mail fraud is a federal crime: '[w]hoever, having devised or intending to
devise any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or property
by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises... for
the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice or attempting so to do,
places in any post office or authorized depository for mail matter, any matter
or thing whatever to be sent or delivered by the Postal Service, or deposits
or causes to be deposited any matter or thing whatever to be sent or
delivered by any private or commercial interstate carrier... shall be fined
under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both.' 18 U.S.C. §
1341."
Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy (2024) provides a comprehensive overview of
the requirements for a civil RICO claim:
"A violation of § 1962(c), the section on which Sedima relies, requires (1)
conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity. The plaintiff must allege each of the elements to state a claim. They
are all equally essential components, and the complaint will fail if any one of
them is not adequately pleaded. In particular, RICO claims based on mail or
wire fraud must comport with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b)'s
requirement that allegations involving fraud be pleaded with particularity."
RICO: A Primer (2022) confirms that mail fraud is one of the most common
predicate acts in RICO cases:
"Among other things, 'racketeering activities' include 'any act which is
indictable under' a list of federal criminal statutes. The list covers an
expansive range of violations, for example, violations of the Hobbs Act, 18
U.S.C. ' 1951 (extortion); 18 U.S.C. ' 1341 (mail fraud) and 1343 (wire
fraud)... Mail and wire fraud are the most common predicate acts."
Theft offenses (2020) adds important information about the statute of
limitations for mail fraud:
"There is a five year statute of limitations for wire and mail fraud. 18 U.S.C.
§3282. Mail and wire fraud that affect a financial institution have a ten year
statute of limitations. 18 U.S.C. §3293."

Analysis: Applying the RICO Framework to a
Family Dispute
The "Enterprise" Requirement
One key challenge in a family-based RICO claim will be establishing that the
family members (spouse, grandmother, and stepfather) constitute an
"enterprise" for RICO purposes. The father would need to demonstrate that
these individuals formed an association-in-fact that has some structure and
continuity beyond the alleged racketeering activity.
As described in Defending Civil RICO Claims: A Defense Plan Should Be In
Every Business's Arsenal (2022):
"An enterprise is an individual or legal entity, or a union or group of
individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity, while a pattern of
racketeering activity requires long-term, organized conduct to violate state
and federal laws."
The father would need to show that his spouse, his spouse's grandmother,
and his spouse's stepfather worked together in an organized manner to
carry out the alleged mail fraud scheme, rather than acting as separate
individuals.
The "Pattern" Requirement
To establish a "pattern of racketeering activity," the father must identify at
least two acts of mail fraud within a ten-year period. As explained in Inc v.
Northwestern Bell Telephone Company, 492 U.S. 229 (1989), a pattern
"requires at least two acts of racketeering activity" within a 10-year period.
However, establishing a pattern typically requires more than just proving
two isolated incidents. The acts must be related and demonstrate continuity.
The father would need to show that the mail fraud incidents were part of a
continuous pattern of behavior, not merely sporadic or isolated events.
Proving Mail Fraud as the Predicate Act
To use mail fraud as the predicate act for a RICO claim, the father would
need to establish the elements outlined in Williams v. Aztar Indiana Gaming
Corp., 351 F.3d 294 (7th Cir. 2003):
The defendants participated in a scheme to defraud
The defendants acted with intent to defraud
The defendants used the mails to further their fraudulent scheme
The father would need to provide specific evidence of how his spouse, his
spouse's grandmother, and his spouse's stepfather used the U.S. mail system
to execute their alleged fraudulent scheme.

3. 

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Importantly, as noted in Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy (2024), allegations
involving fraud must be pleaded with particularity under Federal Rule of
Civil Procedure 9(b). This means the father would need to specify the "who,
what, when, where, and how" of the alleged mail fraud.
Demonstrating Injury
To recover damages under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c), the father must prove that he
was "injured in his business or property" by reason of the RICO violation.
This typically means economic injury, not emotional distress or personal
injury.
The father would need to demonstrate a direct connection between the
defendants' pattern of racketeering activity (the mail fraud) and concrete
economic harm he suffered.
Bringing a RICO Suit Against Family Members
There is no legal prohibition against bringing a RICO suit against family
members. The statutes focus on the conduct and enterprise, not the
relationship between the parties. If the father can establish that his spouse,
his spouse's grandmother, and his spouse's stepfather engaged in a pattern
of mail fraud through an enterprise that affected interstate commerce, he
may have a viable RICO claim regardless of the family relationship.
Which Specific RICO Subsection to Use
Based on the available information, the father should consider bringing
claims under multiple subsections of 18 U.S.C. § 1962:
§ 1962(c) is the most commonly used provision and would apply if the
defendants conducted or participated in the conduct of an enterprise
through a pattern of mail fraud.
§ 1962(d) would apply if the father can demonstrate that the defendants
conspired to violate one of the other RICO provisions.
Depending on the specific facts, § 1962(a) (using income from racketeering
to acquire an interest in an enterprise) or § 1962(b) (acquiring or
maintaining an interest in an enterprise through racketeering) might also be
relevant.
As noted in Boneta v. Rolex Watch USA, Inc., 232 F.Supp.3d 354 (S.D. N.Y.
2017), a plaintiff can allege violations of multiple RICO subsections in the
same complaint.

Exceptions and Caveats
The Domestic Relations Exception
While not mentioned in the provided sources, courts have traditionally been
reluctant to involve federal courts in domestic disputes. The father should
be aware that if the RICO claim appears to be primarily a domestic relations
matter disguised as a federal claim, some courts might be hesitant to
exercise jurisdiction.
The Pleading Standard
RICO claims based on fraud are subject to the heightened pleading standard
of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b). As noted in Civil Rico: A Tool of
Advocacy (2024), "RICO claims based on mail or wire fraud must comport
with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b)'s requirement that allegations
involving fraud be pleaded with particularity."
This means the father must plead the circumstances of the fraud with
particularity, including the time, place, and contents of the false
representations, as well as the identity of the person making the
misrepresentation and what was obtained thereby.
Statute of Limitations
According to Theft offenses (2020), "There is a five year statute of
limitations for wire and mail fraud. 18 U.S.C. §3282. Mail and wire fraud that
affect a financial institution have a ten year statute of limitations. 18 U.S.C.
§3293."
The father should ensure that his claim is brought within this timeframe.
Conclusion
A father seeking relief for mail fraud in a RICO suit against his spouse, his
spouse's grandmother, and his spouse's stepfather should primarily rely on
the following statutes:
18 U.S.C. § 1964(c) provides the civil remedy, allowing recovery of
treble damages and attorney's fees.
18 U.S.C. § 1962, particularly subsection (c), defines the prohibited
activities that form the basis of a RICO violation.
18 U.S.C. § 1961 provides the definitions necessary for a RICO claim,
including identifying mail fraud as a predicate act and defining what
constitutes a pattern of racketeering activity.
18 U.S.C. § 1341, the mail fraud statute, outlines the elements that
must be proven to establish mail fraud as the predicate act.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
To successfully bring this claim, the father would need to prove:
That the defendants (his spouse, his spouse's grandmother, and his
spouse's stepfather) constituted or were associated with an
"enterprise"
That they engaged in a "pattern of racketeering activity" consisting of
at least two acts of mail fraud within a ten-year period
That they used the U.S. mail system to execute a scheme to defraud
That this pattern of activity directly caused injury to his business or
property
The father should be prepared to plead his case with particularity, especially
regarding the alleged fraudulent acts, and to demonstrate that the family
members were engaged in an ongoing enterprise rather than merely
individual actions.
By properly structuring his claim under these statutes and meeting all the
required elements, the father may be able to obtain significant remedies,
including treble damages and attorney's fees, for mail fraud conducted by
his family members.

Extract
A plaintiff asserting a RICO claim predicated on mail fraud need not show,
either as an element of its claim or as a prerequisite to establishing
proximate causation, that it relied on the defendant's alleged
misrepresentations. Pp. 2137 – 2145. (a) In 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c), RICO
provides a private right of action for treble damages to '[a]ny person injured
in his business or property by reason of a violation,' as pertinent here, of §
1962(c), which makes it 'unlawful for any person employed by or associated
with' a qualifying enterprise 'to conduct or participate ... in the conduct of
such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity,'
including 'mail fraud,' § 1961(1)(B). Mail fraud, in turn, occurs whenever a
person, 'having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to
defraud,' uses the mail 'for the purpose of executing such scheme or
artifice.' § 1341.
Summary
The passage from the U.S. Supreme Court case Bridge v. Phoenix Bond &
Indem. Co. clarifies that under the RICO statute, specifically 18 U.S.C. §
1964(c), a plaintiff can seek relief for mail fraud without needing to prove
reliance on the misrepresentations. This is significant because it broadens

the scope of who can bring a RICO claim by focusing on the injury to
business or property rather than the reliance on fraudulent statements. The
passage also outlines that mail fraud, as a predicate act under RICO,
involves using the mail to execute a scheme to defraud, as defined in 18
U.S.C. § 1341.

U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO or Act),
Pub.L. 91-452, Title IX, 84 Stat. 941, as amended, 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961-1968
(1982 ed. and Supp. V), imposes criminal and civil liability upon those who
engage in certain 'prohibited activities.' Each prohibited activity is defined
in 18 U.S.C. § 1962 to include, as one necessary element, proof either of 'a
pattern of racketeering activity' or of 'collection of an unlawful debt.'
'Racketeering activity' is defined in RICO to mean 'any act or threat
involving' specified state-law crimes, any 'act' indictable under various
specified federal statutes, and certain federal 'offenses,' 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1)
(1982 ed., Supp. V); but of the term 'pattern' the statute says only that it
'requires at least two acts of racketeering activity' within a 10-year period,
18 U.S.C. § 1961(5).
Summary
N overview of the RICO Act, which is relevant to the question as it involves
seeking relief for mail fraud under RICO. The passage explains that RICO
imposes liability for engaging in a pattern of racketeering activity, which
includes acts indictable under federal statutes such as mail fraud. It also
specifies that a pattern requires at least two acts of racketeering activity
within a 10-year period. This information is crucial for understanding how a
father might frame a RICO suit involving mail fraud against his spouse and
others.

(1985)
U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C.
§§ 1961-1968, which is directed at 'racketeering activity'—defined in §
1961(1) to encompass, inter alia, acts 'indictable' under specific federal
criminal provisions, including mail and wire fraud—provides in § 1964(c) for

=== PAGE 12 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
a private civil action to recover treble damages by any person injured in his
business or property 'by reason of a violation of section 1962.' Section
1962(c) prohibits conducting or participating in the conduct of an enterprise
'through a pattern of racketeering activity.'
Summary
The passage from the Sedima v. Imrex Company, Inc case provides insight
into how the RICO statute can be used in civil litigation. It explains that
RICO encompasses acts of mail and wire fraud as part of its definition of
"racketeering activity" under 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1). Furthermore, it allows for
a private civil action under § 1964(c) for treble damages if a person is
injured in their business or property due to a violation of § 1962, which
includes conducting an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity.
This is directly relevant to the question as it outlines the statutory basis for
seeking relief in a RICO suit involving mail fraud.
O&#39;KEEFE v. Courtney, 655 F. Supp. 16 (N.D. Ill. 1985)
U.S. District Court — Northern District of Illinois
Extract
The United States Supreme Court recently summarized the purposes behind
and elements of a RICO claim: RICO takes aim at 'racketeering activity,'
which it defines as any act 'chargeable' under several generically described
state criminal laws, any act 'indictable' under numerous specific federal
criminal provisions, including mail and wire fraud, and any 'offense'
involving bankruptcy or securities fraud or drug-related activities that is
'punishable' under federal law. § 1961(1). Section 1962, entitled 'Prohibited
Activities,' outlaws the use of income derived from a 'pattern of racketeering
activity' to acquire an interest in or establish an enterprise engaged in or
affecting interstate commerce; the acquisition or maintenance of any
interest in an enterprise 'through' a pattern of racketeering activity;
conducting or participating in the conduct of an enterprise through a
pattern of racketeering activity; and conspiring to violate any of these
provisions.
Summary
Summary of the elements required to establish a RICO claim, specifically
highlighting that mail fraud is considered a form of "racketeering activity"
under § 1961(1) of the RICO statute. It also outlines the prohibited activities
under § 1962, which are relevant to structuring a RICO claim. This
information is crucial for understanding the statutory framework under
which a father could seek relief for mail fraud in a RICO suit.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
U.S. Court of Appeals — Seventh Circuit
Extract
Williams sued Aztar's former and current operators, claiming a civil violation
of the federal RICO statute, codified at 18 U.S.C. § 1961 et seq., resulting
from an alleged pattern of racketeering activity in the form of mail fraud...
To invoke federal question jurisdiction, Williams alleged a violation of the
federal RICO statute by virtue of mail fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1341. See 18
U.S.C. § 1961(1)(B). The viability of Williams's RICO claim turns on whether
he has established a pattern of racketeering activity, which is an essential
element of a claim under the RICO statute... The elements of mail fraud
under 18 U.S.C. § 1341 are: '(1) the defendant's participation in a scheme to
defraud; (2) defendant's commission of the act with intent to defraud; and
(3) use of the mails in furtherance of the fraudulent scheme.'
Summary
Elements required to establish a mail fraud claim as a predicate act for a
RICO violation, which includes participation in a scheme to defraud, intent
to defraud, and use of the mails in furtherance of the scheme.
Boneta v. Rolex Watch USA, Inc., 232 F.Supp.3d 354 (S.D. N.Y. 2017)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of New York
Extract
The Amended Complaint (hereafter the 'Complaint') alleges that Defendants
committed substantive RICO violations under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(b) and 18
U.S.C. § 1962(c) through their participation in a pattern of mail and wire
fraud. The Complaint also alleges that Defendants conspired to violate RICO
under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d). To establish a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(b) and
(c), the Complaint must allege, among other things, that Defendants
engaged in a 'pattern of racketeering activity.' See id. 'Racketeering activity'
can comprise a variety of offenses including, as relevant here, mail fraud
under 18 U.S.C. § 1341 and wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343. See 18 U.S.C.
§ 1961(1). A 'pattern' of racketeering activity requires at least two predicate
acts of racketeering activity that are related and continuous. See 18 U.S.C. §
1961(5) ; H.J. Inc. v. Nw. Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 238, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106
L.Ed.2d 195 (1989).
Summary
To seek relief for mail fraud in a RICO suit, the father should consider
statutes under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(b), 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), and 18 U.S.C. §
1962(d). These statutes pertain to substantive RICO violations and RICO
conspiracy, respectively. The passage also clarifies that mail fraud can be a
predicate act under RICO, as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 1341, and that a pattern

of racketeering activity requires at least two related and continuous
predicate acts.

U.S. District Court — District of Puerto Rico
Extract
RICO liability breaks down to four essential elements: '(1) conduct (2) of an
enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity.' Sedima,
S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479, 496 (1985). The statute includes
numerous illegal acts in its definition of 'racketeering activity.' Home
Orthopedics, 781 F.3d at 528 (citing 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1)). Among these are
mail and wire fraud, 18 U.S.C. §§ 1341, 1343, which are the relevant
predicate acts in Norfe's amended complaint. Mail fraud 'occurs whenever a
person, 'having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to
defraud,' uses the mail 'for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice
or attempting so to do.' Bridge v. Phoenix Bond & Indem. Co., 553 U.S. 639,
647 (2008) (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 1341).
Summary
Essential elements required to establish RICO liability, which includes
demonstrating a pattern of racketeering activity. Mail fraud is specifically
identified as a predicate act under RICO, as defined in 18 U.S.C. §§ 1341 and
1343. This information is directly relevant to the question of what statutes a
father should consider when seeking relief for mail fraud in a RICO suit.
Arizona Premium Finance, Inc. v. Bielli, 77 F.Supp.2d 341 (E.D. N.Y. 1999)
U.S. District Court — Eastern District of New York
Extract
To state a claim for damages under RICO a plaintiff has two pleading
burdens. First, he must allege that the defendant has violated the
substantive RICO statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1962 (1976), commonly known as
'criminal RICO.' In so doing, he must allege the existence of seven
constituent elements: (1) that the defendant (2) through the commission of
two or more acts (3) constituting a 'pattern' (4) of 'racketeering activity' (5)
directly or indirectly invests in, or maintains an interest in, or participates in
(6) an 'enterprise' (7) the activities of which affect interstate or foreign
commerce.... Plaintiff must allege adequately defendant's violation of section
1962 before turning to the second burden — i.e., invoking RICO's civil
remedies of treble damages, attorneys fees and costs....

Orcilla v. Bank of America, NA, No. C10-03931 HRL (N.D. Cal. Dec 16, 2010)
U.S. District Court — Northern District of California
Extract
A civil plaintiff may, however, use mail fraud allegations to support a civil
RICO claim. Id. at 533. The RICO statute makes it illegal for 'any person
employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities
of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate,
directly or indirectly, in the conduct of [an] enterprise's affairs through a
pattern of racketeering activity' or to conspire to do so. 18 U.S.C. §§ 1692(c),
(d). Thus, to state a claim for a violation of this section, a plaintiff must plead
'(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity.' Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479, 497 (1985).
'Racketeering activity' is defined as a number of specific criminal acts under
federal and state laws. See 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1). Here, Plaintiffs apparently
base their RICO claim on the predicate crime of mail fraud (18 U.S.C. §
1341). See 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1)(B).
Summary
The passage explains that while mail fraud itself does not provide a private
right of action, it can be used as a predicate act in a civil RICO claim. The
RICO statute, under 18 U.S.C. §§ 1692(c), (d), allows for claims based on a
pattern of racketeering activity, which includes mail fraud as defined under
18 U.S.C. § 1341. This is relevant to the question as it provides the statutory
basis for including mail fraud in a RICO suit.
BF Hirsch, Inc. v. Enright Refining Co., 577 F. Supp. 339 (D. N.J. 1983)
U.S. District Court — District of New Jersey
Extract
Plaintiff seeks, inter alia, treble damages which are statutorily provided
under the civil-remedies provisions of the Racketeering Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C. § 1961 et seq. Plaintiff alleges
that defendant's repeated acts of fraudulent misrepresentation, evidenced
by the report letters omitting the improperly withheld retainage charges,
constitute mail and wire fraud pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §§ 1341 and 1343,
respectively. As set out hereunder, I find that the substantive elements

=== PAGE 16 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
necessary to state a claim for damages under RICO have been established
and, therefore, plaintiff is entitled to the relief sought.
Summary
Fraudulent misrepresentation through mail and wire fraud can be grounds
for a RICO claim, and the plaintiff in the case was entitled to relief under
these provisions. This suggests that a father seeking relief for mail fraud in a
RICO suit against family members could potentially rely on these statutes.
Uselmann v. Pop, 495 F.Supp.3d 528 (E.D. Mich. 2020)
U.S. District Court — Eastern District of Michigan
Extract
Claims for civil violations of RICO are governed by 18 U.S.C. § 1962. The
statute provides that: It shall be unlawful for any person employed by or
associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect,
interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or
indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of
racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt. 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). To
state a RICO cause of action, a plaintiff must establish four elements: (1)
conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity. ... RICO defines 'racketeering activity' to include a multitude of
offenses that are either 'chargeable' under certain state criminal laws or
'indictable' under specified federal criminal laws. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1). Both
the mail fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1341, and the wire fraud statute, 18
U.S.C. § 1343, are listed as predicate racketeering offenses under RICO.
Summary
To seek relief for mail fraud in a RICO suit, the father should rely on 18
U.S.C. § 1962, which governs civil RICO violations. Mail fraud, as defined
under 18 U.S.C. § 1341, is considered a predicate act of racketeering activity
under RICO. Therefore, the father should allege that the defendants
engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity, including mail fraud, to
establish a RICO claim.
Hall v. Witteman, 569 F.Supp.2d 1208 (D. Kan. 2008)
U.S. District Court — District of Kansas
Extract
In order to bring a RICO claim, a plaintiff must allege a violation of 18 U.S.C.
§ 1962, which consists of four elements: '(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3)
through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity.' ... 'Racketeering activity' is

=== PAGE 17 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
defined in 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1)(B) as any 'act which is indictable' under
federal law and specifically includes mail fraud and wire fraud. These
underlying acts are 'referred to as predicate acts, because they form the
basis for liability under RICO.' ... To establish the predicate act of mail fraud
[the plaintiff] must allege '(1) the existence of a scheme or artifice to
defraud or obtain money or property by false pretenses, representations or
promises, and (2) use of the United States mails for the purpose of executing
the scheme.'
Summary
To bring a RICO claim involving mail fraud, the plaintiff must allege a
violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1962. This involves demonstrating conduct of an
enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity, which includes mail
fraud as defined under 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1)(B). The plaintiff must specifically
allege the existence of a scheme to defraud and the use of U.S. mails to
execute this scheme. This information is generally applicable to any RICO
claim involving mail fraud.
18 U.S.C. § 1341 18 U.S.C. § 1341 Frauds and Swindles

Summary
18 U.S.C. § 1341 is a federal statute that criminalizes mail fraud. It applies
to any scheme devised to defraud or obtain money or property through false
pretenses, using the postal service or private carriers. This statute is
relevant to the question as it provides the legal basis for addressing mail
fraud, which could be a component of a RICO suit if the fraudulent activity is
part of a pattern of racketeering activity.
18 U.S.C. § 1962 18 U.S.C. § 1962 Prohibited Activities
Extract

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
18 U.S.C. § 1962 outlines prohibited activities related to racketeering.
Specifically, it addresses unlawful activities involving the acquisition or
control of enterprises through a pattern of racketeering activity, which can
include mail fraud. This statute is relevant to a RICO suit as it provides the
legal framework for addressing racketeering activities, including those
involving family members if they are part of the alleged racketeering
enterprise.
18 U.S.C. § 1961 18 U.S.C. § 1961 Definitions
Extract
As used in this chapter- 'racketeering activity' means ... (B) any act which is
indictable under any of the following provisions of title 18, United States
Code: ... section 1341 (relating to mail fraud), ...
Summary
Mail fraud is explicitly listed as a type of racketeering activity under the
RICO Act. This means that if the father is alleging mail fraud as part of a
pattern of racketeering activity, it falls under the statutes covered by the
RICO Act. The definition of racketeering activity includes acts indictable
under section 1341, which relates to mail fraud. Therefore, the father can
seek relief under the RICO statutes by alleging mail fraud as part of the
racketeering activity.

Summary
The United States Postal Service (USPS) has provisions for addressing mail
fraud, which is defined as using the mail to execute a scheme to defraud or
obtain money or property by false pretenses or promises. This is relevant to
the question as it provides a basis for seeking relief under statutes related to
mail fraud, which could be part of a RICO suit if the mail fraud is part of a
larger pattern of racketeering activity.

Newman, Samuel A. - 2000-03-22
Extract
To federal prosecutors of white collar crime, the mail fraud statute is our
Stradivarius, our Colt 45, our Louisville Slugger, our Cuisinart--and our true
love. We may flirt with RICO, show off with 10b-5, and call the conspiracy
law `darling,' but we always come home to the virtues of 18 U.S.C. [sections]
1341, with its simplicity, adaptability, and comfortable familiarity. It
understands us and, like many a foolish spouse, we like to think we
understand it.
Summary
The passage highlights the importance and utility of the mail fraud statute,
18 U.S.C. § 1341, in federal prosecutions of white-collar crime. It suggests
that this statute is a fundamental tool for addressing fraudulent activities
involving the use of mail. The passage also mentions RICO, indicating that
mail fraud can be a component of a RICO case. Therefore, in a RICO suit
involving allegations of mail fraud, 18 U.S.C. § 1341 would be a relevant
statute for seeking relief.
Guidelines for Related Offenses
Antitrust Cartel Leniency and Sentencing Handbook - American Bar
Association - 2023-05-07
Extract
Mail and wire fraud are the two statutes that are both most likely either to
be included with Sherman Act charges, or to be used on their own instead of
the Sherman Act. This chapter begins with a discussion of the potential
effects of the inclusion of mail and wire fraud charges on the Guidelines
analysis. The chapter then addresses the Guidelines for other crimes that
can be charged in connection with or in place of antitrust violations,
including perjury and obstruction of justice, false statements, major fraud
against the United States, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA),
conspiracy, and tax and money laundering.
Summary
Mail and wire fraud statutes (18 U.S.C. §§ 1341 and 1343) are commonly
used in conjunction with or as alternatives to Sherman Act charges. These
statutes are relevant in cases involving fraudulent activities, which could
include a RICO suit if the fraudulent activities are part of a pattern of
racketeering activity. The passage also mentions other related offenses that
could be considered in such cases, such as conspiracy and money
laundering.

Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy
The Brief - American Bar Association - 2024-01-01
Extract
A violation of § 1962(c), the section on which Sedima relies, requires (1)
conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity. The plaintiff must allege each of the elements to state a claim. They
are all equally essential components, and the complaint will fail if any one of
them is not adequately pleaded. In particular, RICO claims based on mail or
wire fraud must comport with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b)’s
requirement that allegations involving fraud be pleaded with particularity. ...
Section 1961(1) outlines the definition of “racketeering activity” and
enumerates various predicate acts that can establish a pattern of
racketeering. These predicate acts encompass a wide range of criminal
activities, including but not limited to mail fraud, wire fraud, bribery,
extortion, and money laundering. ... RICO creates a private cause of action
under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c). To state a civil RICO claim, a plaintiff must allege
(1) two or more predicate racketeering offenses, (2) the existence of an
enterprise affecting interstate commerce, (3) a connection between the
racketeering offenses, and (4) an injury by reason of the above.
Summary
To seek relief for mail fraud in a RICO suit, the father must allege a violation
of § 1962(c) by demonstrating conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of
racketeering activity, which includes mail fraud as a predicate act. The
plaintiff must also comply with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) by
pleading fraud with particularity. Additionally, under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c), the
plaintiff must show two or more predicate offenses, an enterprise affecting
interstate commerce, a connection between the offenses, and an injury
resulting from them.
