Question
The wife admitted she has no evidence to support her claims and relied
solely on her own testimony. In family law cases, especially those involving
serious allegations (e.g., drug use, family violence), Texas courts often
require corroborating evidence to support claims (see In re J.F.C., 96 S.W.3d
256, 264 (Tex. 2002)). The absence of corroborating evidence, combined
with her lack of credibility, makes it unlikely the court will find in her favor
on these allegations.
Answer (Texas)
Short response
In Texas family law cases involving serious allegations such as drug use or
family violence, courts require clear and convincing evidence, and
uncorroborated testimony—especially from a party found not credible—is
generally insufficient to meet this standard. Therefore, if the wife admits she
has no evidence beyond her own testimony and lacks credibility, it is highly
unlikely the court will rule in her favor on these allegations.
Summary
Texas courts apply a heightened evidentiary standard—clear and convincing
evidence—when adjudicating serious family law allegations, including those
involving drug use or family violence. The case law consistently holds that
self-serving, uncorroborated testimony, particularly from a party whose
credibility is in question, will not satisfy this burden, and courts are entitled
to disregard such testimony when making their findings.
The authorities provided demonstrate that Texas appellate courts require
specific, corroborative evidence linking the alleged conduct to the harm or
risk at issue. Where a party relies solely on their own assertions without
supporting evidence, and the factfinder does not find them credible, the
courts have repeatedly found the evidence legally and factually insufficient
to support serious allegations. As a result, in the scenario described, the
absence of corroborating evidence and credibility issues make it very
unlikely that the court will find in the wife’s favor.
Background and Relevant Law
Case Law
Texas family law, particularly in cases involving allegations of parental
misconduct such as drug use or family violence, is governed by a clear and
convincing evidence standard. This standard is codified in the Texas Family
Code and interpreted by the courts to require a degree of proof that

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
produces a firm belief or conviction in the mind of the factfinder regarding
the truth of the allegations.
The appellate courts have repeatedly emphasized that this standard is
higher than the preponderance of the evidence and is designed to protect
the fundamental interests at stake in family law proceedings. The courts
have also clarified the distinction between legal and factual sufficiency of
the evidence under this standard, with both requiring that the evidence be
capable of producing a firm belief or conviction in the truth of the
allegations, but differing in the lens through which the evidence is reviewed.
Key authorities provided include:
In re A.M., 07-24-00402-CV (Tex. App. Jul 14, 2025): The court
criticized conclusory and vague testimony regarding family violence
and drug use, finding the evidence insufficient where it lacked detail,
corroboration, and a clear connection to the alleged harm or
endangerment. The court cited prior cases where evidence was found
factually insufficient when only bare assertions or uncorroborated past
violence were presented.
T. D. v. Tex. Dep't of Fam. & Protective Serv., 683 S.W.3d 901
(Tex. App. 2024): This case reiterates the clear and convincing
evidence standard and explains that the factfinder is the sole judge of
witness credibility. The court specifically noted that the trial court may
give no weight to a party’s self-serving statement, especially when
unsupported by other evidence.
K. J. v. Tex. Dep't of Family & Protective Servs., NO. 03-18-00556-
CV (Tex. App. Dec 28, 2018): The court contrasted a party’s self-
serving denial of drug use with objective, corroborating evidence (such
as test results), finding the latter sufficient and the former inadequate.
This underscores the necessity of corroborative evidence in serious
allegations.
B. L. M. v. J. H. III M., NO. 03-14-00050-CV (Tex. App. Jul 17,
2014): The court explained that the factfinder may discount a party’s
uncorroborated testimony, especially when the party is found not
credible, and that such testimony alone is insufficient to meet the clear
and convincing standard.
Supplementary authorities reinforce these principles:
In re Interest of C.V.L., 591 S.W.3d 734 (Tex. App. 2019): The
court emphasized the need for concrete, corroborative evidence of
endangering conditions or a course of conduct, and that incredible or
uncorroborated testimony may be disregarded.
In re Interest of D.M., 452 S.W.3d 462 (Tex. App. 2014): The court
held that conjecture or lack of corroborating evidence cannot substitute
for proof, and that the burden is on the party making the allegation to
present clear and convincing evidence.

Analysis
The scenario presented involves a wife who admits she has no evidence to
support her claims of serious misconduct (such as drug use or family
violence) and relies solely on her own testimony. The question is whether,
under Texas law, this is sufficient to meet the evidentiary burden required
for the court to find in her favor.
The clear and convincing evidence standard, as articulated in the authorities
above, requires more than mere assertions or self-serving testimony. The
factfinder must be able to form a firm belief or conviction in the truth of the
allegations, and this is generally not possible where the only evidence is the
testimony of the party making the allegation, especially if that party is found
not credible.
In In re A.M., 07-24-00402-CV (Tex. App. Jul 14, 2025), the court found
the evidence insufficient where the testimony regarding family violence and
drug use was vague, lacked detail, and was not corroborated by other
evidence. The court specifically noted the absence of specifics about who
committed the violence, when it occurred, or how it related to the case, and
found that such conclusory testimony could not support a finding of
endangerment or misconduct. The court cited prior cases, such as In re
B.P., where evidence was found factually insufficient when only bare
assertions or uncorroborated past violence were presented.
Similarly, in T. D. v. Tex. Dep't of Fam. & Protective Serv., 683 S.W.3d
901 (Tex. App. 2024), the court reiterated that the factfinder is the sole
judge of witness credibility and may give no weight to a party’s self-serving
statement. The court explained that evidence is factually insufficient if, in
light of the entire record, the disputed evidence is so significant that the
factfinder could not have formed a firm belief or conviction that the finding
was true. This means that, where the only evidence is the testimony of a
party whose credibility is in question, the court is entitled to disregard that
testimony and find the evidence insufficient.
In K. J. v. Tex. Dep't of Family & Protective Servs., NO. 03-18-00556-
CV (Tex. App. Dec 28, 2018), the court contrasted the party’s self-serving
denial of drug use with objective, corroborating evidence (such as test
results), finding the latter sufficient and the former inadequate. This case
underscores the necessity of corroborative evidence in serious allegations
and demonstrates that courts will not credit uncorroborated testimony,
especially when contradicted by other evidence or when the party lacks
credibility.
B. L. M. v. J. H. III M., NO. 03-14-00050-CV (Tex. App. Jul 17, 2014)
further supports this principle, explaining that the factfinder may discount a
party’s uncorroborated testimony, especially when the party is found not
credible, and that such testimony alone is insufficient to meet the clear and
convincing standard.
The supplementary authorities reinforce these points. In re Interest of
C.V.L., 591 S.W.3d 734 (Tex. App. 2019) emphasizes the need for

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
concrete, corroborative evidence of endangering conditions or a course of
conduct, and that incredible or uncorroborated testimony may be
disregarded. In re Interest of D.M., 452 S.W.3d 462 (Tex. App. 2014)
holds that conjecture or lack of corroborating evidence cannot substitute for
proof, and that the burden is on the party making the allegation to present
clear and convincing evidence.
Taken together, these authorities establish a consistent rule: in Texas family
law cases involving serious allegations, the courts require more than the
uncorroborated testimony of the party making the allegation. The evidence
must be sufficient to produce a firm belief or conviction in the mind of the
factfinder, and this is generally not possible where the only evidence is the
testimony of a party whose credibility is in question.
Exceptions and Caveats
While the authorities are clear that uncorroborated, self-serving testimony is
generally insufficient to meet the clear and convincing evidence standard in
serious family law allegations, there are some important caveats.
First, the factfinder (usually the trial court) is the sole judge of witness
credibility and may, in some circumstances, choose to credit a party’s
testimony even if it is uncorroborated. However, the appellate courts have
made clear that this is unlikely in cases involving serious allegations such as
drug use or family violence, where the consequences are significant and the
standard of proof is heightened.
Second, the courts have emphasized that all evidence must be considered in
light of the entire record, and that the factfinder is entitled to resolve
disputed facts in favor of its finding if a reasonable factfinder could do so.
However, where the only evidence is the testimony of a party whose
credibility is in question, and there is no corroborating evidence, the courts
have consistently found the evidence insufficient.
Finally, while the authorities provided do not address every possible
scenario, they are consistent in their application of the clear and convincing
evidence standard and the requirement for corroborative evidence in serious
family law allegations.
Conclusion
In summary, Texas courts require clear and convincing evidence to support
serious family law allegations such as drug use or family violence. The
authorities provided consistently hold that uncorroborated, self-serving
testimony—especially from a party whose credibility is in question—is
insufficient to meet this standard. The factfinder is entitled to disregard
such testimony, and the absence of corroborating evidence makes it highly
unlikely that the court will find in favor of the party making the allegation.
Therefore, in the scenario described, where the wife admits she has no
evidence beyond her own testimony and lacks credibility, it is very unlikely
that the court will rule in her favor on these allegations.

Legal Authorities
B. L. M. v. J. H. III M., NO. 03-14-00050-CV (Tex. App. Jul 17, 2014)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Evidence is clear and convincing if it 'will produce in the mind of the trier of
fact a firm belief or conviction as to the truth of the allegations sought to be
established.' Id. § 101.007. Due process demands this heightened standard
because of the fundamental interests at issue. In re J.F.C., 96 S.W.3d 256,
263 (Tex. 2002). ... In evaluating the legal sufficiency of the evidence in a
case involving termination of parental rights, we determine whether the
evidence is such that a factfinder could reasonably form a firm belief or
conviction that the challenged ground for termination was established. In re
J.P.B., 180 S.W.3d 570, 573 (Tex. 2005) (citing In re J.F.C., 96 S.W.3d at
264-66). ... We resolve any disputed facts in favor of the finding if a
reasonable factfinder could have done so and disregard all evidence that a
reasonable factfinder could have disbelieved. ... However, we must consider
undisputed evidence even if it is contrary to the finding. ... In reviewing the
factual sufficiency of the evidence, we must give due consideration to
evidence that the factfinder could reasonably have found to be clear and
convincing. In re J.F.C., 96 S.W.3d at 266. ... 'If, in light of the entire record,
the disputed evidence that a reasonable factfinder could not have credited in
favor of the finding is so significant that a factfinder could not reasonably
have formed a firm belief or conviction, then the evidence is factually
insufficient.' Id. ... The trial court was entitled to credit this evidence and to
discount Beth's version of events. ... Through her denial of culpability in
response to questioning, Beth provided the only evidence concerning the
circumstances of her arrest, but the trial court expressly found Beth not
credible.
Summary
The opinion reiterates the clear-and-convincing standard from In re J.F.C.
and explains sufficiency review that discounts evidence a factfinder could
disbelieve. It notes the court may discount a party’s uncorroborated
testimony when credibility is lacking and highlights that Beth’s denials were
the only evidence on key points, with the trial court expressly finding her not
credible. This supports arguing that uncorroborated, self-serving testimony,
especially from a witness deemed not credible, is insufficient to meet the
required standard on serious allegations.

See Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 161.001(2) (trial court's best-interest finding
must be supported by clear and convincing evidence in the record); In re
E.N.C., 384 S.W.3d at 808 (holding that lack of evidence cannot 'contradict a
finding as if it were evidence supporting a finding'). ... It was the
Department's burden, however, to present such evidence. See In re E.N.C.,
384 S.W.3d at 810 ('The Department is required to support its allegations
against a parent by clear and convincing evidence; conjecture is not
enough.').
Summary
The passages emphasize that serious family-law determinations must be
supported by evidence in the record and that conjecture or lack of
corroborating evidence cannot substitute for proof. This aligns with the
proposition that mere testimony without corroboration—particularly for
serious allegations like drug use or violence—will not satisfy the required
evidentiary standard and undermines credibility-based assertions.

Regarding family violence, Tucker confirmed that violence between Father
and Mother was one of the initial reasons for removal... Tucker was then
asked, 'Were there any incidences [sic] of violence or destruction of
property?' The witness answered 'Yes.' The record provides no detail about
who committed the violence, when it was committed, where it was
committed, any circumstances, or how the testimony relates to the police
reports filed throughout the case." ... "See In re B.P., No. 07-14-00037-CV,
2014 Tex.App. LEXIS 8127, at *15-20 (Tex. App.-Amarillo July 25, 2014, pet.
denied) (mem. op.) (finding evidence factually insufficient where only
evidence was that father committed past violence against mother)." ... "The
drug use evidence is equally deficient... the record lacks details about any
connection to the child during any drug use. The Department made no effort
to discuss the circumstances that might have endangered the child. See In
re C.V. L, 591 S.W.3d 734, 751 (Tex. App.-Dallas 2019, pet. denied) ('The
party seeking termination [due to parent drug use] must still present clear
and convincing evidence of the child’s actual physical surroundings or
conditions that were created by the endangering conduct...').
Summary
The court criticized conclusory testimony lacking specifics and highlighted
the need for detailed, corroborating evidence linking allegations to
endangerment. It cited cases finding evidence insufficient where only bare

assertions or uncorroborated past violence existed. This supports the
proposition that mere testimony without corroboration is unlikely to carry
the burden in serious family-law allegations.

App. Dec 28, 2018)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
‘The distinction between legal and factual sufficiency when the burden of
proof is clear and convincing evidence may be a fine one in some cases, but
there is a distinction in how the evidence is reviewed.’ In re J.F.C., 96 S.W.3d
256, 266 (Tex. 2002). When reviewing the legal sufficiency of the evidence in
a parental-rights-termination case, we consider all the evidence in the light
most favorable to the trial court's finding and determine whether a
reasonable fact-finder could have formed a firm belief or conviction that its
finding was true. ... Here, the Department presented evidence that: ... We
acknowledge that K.J. presented testimony contradicting some of the
evidence summarized above. For example, K.J. testified that she had not
used cocaine despite the test results. ... Nevertheless, considering all the
evidence in the light most favorable to the trial court's finding, we determine
that the trial court could have reasonably formed a firm belief or conviction
that K.J. endangered the children... We therefore conclude that legally
sufficient evidence supports the trial court's finding under subsection (E). In
addition, viewing all of the evidence in a neutral light, we determine that the
trial court have reasonably formed a firm belief or conviction that K.J.
endangered the children. Therefore, we conclude that factually sufficient
evidence supports the trial court's finding under subsection (E).
Summary
The opinion relies on In re J.F.C. to emphasize that clear-and-convincing
evidence must allow a reasonable fact-finder to form a firm belief or
conviction. The court contrasts K.J.’s self-serving testimony (denying cocaine
use) with corroborating objective evidence (test results) and finds the latter
sufficient, underscoring that mere uncorroborated testimony is inadequate
when serious allegations are at issue. This supports the proposition that
courts look for corroborating evidence beyond a party’s testimony and that
absence of such corroboration, coupled with credibility concerns,
undermines the claim.

The Department must prove both elements by clear and convincing
evidence. See Tex. Fam. Code § 161.206(a); In re J.F.C., 96 S.W.3d 256, 263
(Tex. 2002). '“Clear and convincing evidence” means the measure or degree
of proof that will produce in the mind of the trier of fact a firm belief or
conviction as to the truth of the allegations sought to be established.' ...
'Evidence is factually insufficient if, in light of the entire record, the disputed
evidence a reasonable factfinder could not have credited in favor of a finding
is so significant that the factfinder could not have formed a firm belief or
conviction that the finding was true.' Id. When reviewing the evidence, we
must 'provide due deference to the decisions of the factfinder, who, having
full opportunity to observe witness testimony first-hand, is the sole arbiter
when assessing the credibility and demeanor of witnesses.' In re A.B., 437
S.W.3d 498, 503 (Tex. 2014). ... the trial court as factfinder had a right to
give no weight to Mother’s self-serving statement
Summary
The opinion reiterates the clear-and-convincing standard from In re J.F.C.
and explains factual sufficiency—requiring evidence that can produce a firm
belief or conviction. It emphasizes deference to credibility determinations
and expressly states the factfinder may give no weight to a party’s self-
serving statement. Together, these support the argument that
uncorroborated, self-serving testimony—especially on serious allegations
like drug use or violence—is unlikely to satisfy the evidentiary burden
without corroboration, particularly where credibility is lacking.

We 'consider all the evidence, not just that which favors the verdict,' and we

not reasonably have formed a firm belief or conviction, then the evidence is
factually insufficient." ... "The party seeking termination must still present

conditions that were created by the endangering conduct to satisfy the
requirements of subsection (D) and must show a continuing course of
conduct to satisfy the requirements of subsection (E).

Summary
The passages emphasize that courts evaluate all evidence, may disregard
incredible testimony, and require clear and convincing proof sufficient to
form a firm belief or conviction. They also stress the need for concrete,
corroborative evidence of endangering conditions or a course of conduct.
Where a party relies only on their own testimony without corroboration, and
credibility is lacking, the evidence may be deemed legally/factually
insufficient.
