Question
The Defendants (Morgan Michelle Myers, Daniel Kenneth Branthoover, and
Margie Evonne Wilson) coordinated their actions to achieve a common goal:
to unlawfully remove Plaintiff from his residence, gain an advantage in
divorce proceedings, and finalize the divorce. Under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), it is
unlawful for any person to conduct or participate in the conduct of an
enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity when that
enterprise affects interstate or foreign commerce. Under 18 U.S.C. §
1962(d), it is unlawful for any person to conspire to violate the provisions of
subsection (c). To establish a civil RICO claim, a plaintiff must show: (1) the
existence of an enterprise; (2) that the enterprise engaged in or its activities
affected interstate commerce; (3) that the defendant was employed by or
associated with the enterprise; (4) that the defendant participated in the
conduct of the enterprise's affairs; and (5) that the participation was
through a pattern of racketeering activity. (See Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co.,
473 U.S. 479 (1985)). The Defendants formed an "association-in-fact"
enterprise as defined in Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938 (2009), by
coordinating their actions for a common purpose, maintaining relationships
among themselves, and engaging in conduct with sufficient longevity to
pursue their objectives. Mail fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1341), wire fraud (18 U.S.C. §
1343), and obstruction of justice (18 U.S.C. § 1503) are predicate acts of
racketeering activity under 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1). The Defendants engaged in
a pattern of racketeering activity by committing at least two predicate acts,
including wire fraud (e.g., the transfer of $1,576 across state lines via
PayPal), mail fraud (e.g., using the U.S. Mail to serve false documents), and
obstruction of justice (e.g., knowingly filing false statements in court
documents to gain an advantage in divorce proceedings). A "pattern of
racketeering activity" requires at least two predicate acts that are related
and amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity. (See H.J. Inc. v.
Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229 (1989)). The Defendants' actions
demonstrate a pattern of racketeering activity because they were part of a
common fraudulent scheme aimed at achieving their shared objectives, and
the conduct poses a threat of continued criminal activity as evidenced by
ongoing communications and threats. Under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c), a plaintiff
may bring a civil RICO claim if they have been injured in their business or
property by reason of a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1962. The Plaintiff suffered
injury to his business and property as a result of the Defendants'
racketeering activity, including the depletion of funds from the joint marital
account, the cessation of his business operations due to lack of funds, and
his eviction from the residence he relied on for his livelihood. Based on the
foregoing, the Plaintiff has established a prima facie case for a civil RICO
claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) and (d).

Short response
Based on the provided legal authorities, the plaintiff has established a prima
facie case for a civil RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) and (d) against
the defendants who allegedly coordinated their actions to form an
association-in-fact enterprise engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity
that injured the plaintiff's business and property. The alleged predicate acts
of wire fraud, mail fraud, and obstruction of justice, committed as part of a
coordinated scheme to unlawfully remove the plaintiff from his residence
and gain advantage in divorce proceedings, satisfy the requirements for a
civil RICO claim under current statutory framework and judicial
interpretations.
Summary
The plaintiff's civil RICO claim against the three defendants (Morgan
Michelle Myers, Daniel Kenneth Branthoover, and Margie Evonne Wilson)
appears to establish all the required elements under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) and
(d) as interpreted by the courts. The defendants allegedly formed an
association-in-fact enterprise by coordinating their actions to achieve the
common goals of unlawfully removing the plaintiff from his residence,
gaining an advantage in divorce proceedings, and finalizing the divorce.
Their alleged conduct included multiple predicate acts of racketeering
activity, specifically wire fraud (transferring funds across state lines via
PayPal), mail fraud (using U.S. Mail to serve false documents), and
obstruction of justice (filing false statements in court documents). These
activities affected interstate commerce and directly caused injury to the
plaintiff's business and property.
The relevant statutory provisions and case law, particularly Sedima, S.P.R.L.
v. Imrex Co., Boyle v. United States, and H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel.
Co., support the proposition that the defendants' coordinated actions
constitute a violation of RICO. The plaintiff has demonstrated the existence
of an enterprise, its effect on interstate commerce, the defendants'
association with the enterprise, their participation in the conduct of the
enterprise's affairs, and that this participation was through a pattern of
racketeering activity. Furthermore, the plaintiff has established standing to
bring this civil RICO claim by showing injury to business and property as a
direct result of the defendants' racketeering activity, including depletion of
funds from a joint marital account, cessation of business operations, and
eviction from the residence relied upon for livelihood.
Background and Relevant Law
Statutory Framework
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) provides
both criminal penalties and civil remedies for certain prohibited activities.
The relevant statutory provisions for this analysis are 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c)
and (d), 18 U.S.C. § 1961, and 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c).

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), "It shall be unlawful for any person employed by
or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which
affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or
indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of
racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt," 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c)
(2025).
Additionally, 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d) provides that "It shall be unlawful for any
person to conspire to violate any of the provisions of subsection (a), (b), or
(c) of this section," 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d) (2025).
RICO defines key terms in 18 U.S.C. § 1961. "Racketeering activity" includes
a broad range of federal crimes, including "section 1341 (relating to mail
fraud), section 1343 (relating to wire fraud), ... section 1503 (relating to
obstruction of justice)," 18 U.S.C. § 1961 (2025). The term "enterprise" is
defined to include "any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or
other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals associated in fact
although not a legal entity," 18 U.S.C. § 1961 (2025). A "pattern of
racketeering activity" requires "at least two acts of racketeering activity, one
of which occurred after the effective date of this chapter and the last of
which occurred within ten years (excluding any period of imprisonment)
after the commission of a prior act of racketeering activity," 18 U.S.C. § 1961
(2025).
18 U.S.C. § 1343, which defines wire fraud, states that "Whoever, having
devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for
obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses,
representations, or promises, transmits or causes to be transmitted by
means of wire, radio, or television communication in interstate or foreign
commerce, any writings, signs, signals, pictures, or sounds for the purpose
of executing such scheme or artifice, shall be fined under this title or
imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both," 18 U.S.C. § 1343 (2025).
For civil remedies, 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c) provides that "Any person injured in
his business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962 of this
chapter may sue therefor in any appropriate United States district court and
shall recover threefold the damages he sustains and the cost of the suit,
including a reasonable attorney's fee..." 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c) (2025).
Judicial Interpretation of RICO Elements
Elements of a Civil RICO Claim
The U.S. Supreme Court in Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co. established that to
state a RICO claim, a plaintiff must plead "(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise
(3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity," Lockhart v. Deluca (E.D.
Mich. 2023) ("The Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act,
or RICO, was enacted to curb "racketeering activity," which it defines as any
act "chargeable" under several generically described state criminal laws,
any act "indictable" under numerous specific federal criminal provisions,
including mail and wire fraud, and any "offense" involving bankruptcy or
securities fraud or drug-related activities that is "punishable" under federal

law." 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1); see also Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., Inc., 473
U.S. 479, 481-82 (1985). For violations of RICO, Congress has provided
primarily criminal penalties. See 18 U.S.C. § 1963. But § 1964 establishes a
civil cause of action for '[a]ny person injured in his business of property by
reason of a violation of [18 U.S.C. § 1962].' To state a RICO claim, a plaintiff
must plead: '(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of
racketeering activity.' Sedima, S.P.R.L., 473 U.S. at 496.").
This framework has been consistently applied by courts. For instance, in 
Egerique v. Chowaiki, 19 Civ. 3110 (KPF) (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 24, 2020), the court
noted that "Section 1962(c) makes it 'unlawful for any person employed by
or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which
affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or
indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of
racketeering activity.' 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). Section 1962(d) applies the same
prohibitions to a defendant who conspires to violate subsection (c)."
More comprehensively, courts have recognized that "To establish a RICO
violation under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) a plaintiff must demonstrate '(1) conduct
(2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity that
must include at least two racketeering acts,'" Reynolds v. Condon, 908
F.Supp. 1494 (N.D.W.Va. 1996).
In P & P MARKETING, INC. v. Ditton, 746 F. Supp. 1354 (N.D. Ill. 1990), the
court further clarified that "five elements are common and necessary to
every civil RICO claim. These essential elements are: (1) a 'person'; (2) an
'enterprise' engaged in or affecting interstate commerce; (3) 'racketeering
activity' which (4) occurred in a 'pattern' and (5) an injury."
Definition of an "Association-in-Fact" Enterprise
The Supreme Court in Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938 (2009)
established that "an association-in-fact enterprise must have at least three
structural features: a purpose, relationships among those associated with
the enterprise, and longevity sufficient to permit these associates to pursue
the enterprise's purpose." The Court further explained that "an association-
in-fact enterprise is 'a group of persons associated together for a common
purpose of engaging in a course of conduct.'"
This interpretation is crucial for understanding how individuals who
coordinate their actions for a common purpose can form an enterprise under
RICO, even without a formal legal structure. As noted in U.S. v. International
Longshoremen's Ass'n, 518 F.Supp.2d 422 (E.D.N.Y. 2007), "The 'enterprise'
is not the 'pattern of racketeering activity'; it is an entity separate and apart
from the pattern of activity in which it engages. The existence of an
enterprise at all times remains a separate element which must be proved by
the Government."
Pattern of Racketeering Activity
The Supreme Court in H.J. Inc v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Company, 492
U.S. 229 (1989) established that "In order to prove a pattern of racketeering

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
activity, a plaintiff or prosecutor must show at least two racketeering
predicates that are related and that amount to, or threaten the likelihood of,
continued criminal activity." The Court further explained that "RICO renders
criminally and civilly liable 'any person' who uses or invests income derived
'from a pattern of racketeering activity' to acquire an interest in or to
operate an enterprise engaged in interstate commerce, § 1962(a); who
acquires or maintains an interest in or control of such an enterprise 'through
a pattern of racketeering activity,' § 1962(b); who, being employed by or
associated with such an enterprise, conducts or participates in the conduct
of its affairs 'through a pattern of racketeering activity,' § 1962(c); or, finally,
who conspires to violate the first three subsections of § 1962, § 1962(d)."
In determining what constitutes a "pattern," courts have focused on both the
relationship between the predicate acts and their continuity. As explained in
a legal primer, "A plaintiff may demonstrate a pattern by establishment that
the predicate acts pose a threat of continued criminal activity, which is
generally demonstrated by showing either: * Closed-ended continuity.
Proving 'a series of related predicate acts extending over a substantial
period of time.' * Open-ended continuity. A threat of 'continuing criminal
activity extending indefinitely into the future,' in light of the nature of the
enterprise and predicate acts alleged," RICO: A Primer (2022-01-31).
Predicate Acts of Racketeering Activity
The RICO statute identifies specific criminal activities that qualify as
predicate acts for establishing a pattern of racketeering activity. These
include mail fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1341), wire fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343), and
obstruction of justice (18 U.S.C. § 1503), 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1) (2025).
Courts have consistently recognized these as valid predicate acts for RICO
claims. In City of New York v. Cyco.Net, Inc., 383 F.Supp.2d 526 (S.D.N.Y.
2005), the court noted that "Racketeering activity is defined as the
commission of one of the offenses (predicate acts) enumerated in 18 U.S.C. §
1961(1). Such racketeering activity under § 1961(1) includes mail fraud in
violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1341 and wire fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1343."
Requirement of Interstate Commerce
For a RICO claim to proceed, the enterprise must engage in or affect
interstate commerce. This jurisdictional element is typically satisfied by
showing even a minimal connection to interstate commerce. According to a
legal source, "Notably, there must be some nexus to interstate or foreign
commerce—it is a jurisdictional element of a civil RICO claim. Thus,
predicate acts will often occur in several States," RICO: A Primer
(2022-01-31).
Civil RICO Standing and Injury Requirement
Under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c), a plaintiff must demonstrate injury to business or
property resulting from the RICO violation. The statute provides that "Any
person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
1962 of this chapter may sue therefor in any appropriate United States
district court and shall recover threefold the damages he sustains and the
cost of the suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee," 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c)
(2025).
Courts have interpreted this to require a showing of direct injury. In 
Egerique v. Chowaiki, 19 Civ. 3110 (KPF) (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 24, 2020), the court
noted that "RICO affords a private right of action to individuals who are
harmed by racketeering activity. See 18 U.S.C. § 1964. This private right of
action allows a plaintiff to bring a claim under RICO for sustaining injuries
'in his business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962.' 18
U.S.C. § 1964(c)."
Application of RICO in Divorce Cases
While RICO claims in divorce proceedings are relatively uncommon, they are
not unprecedented. According to one source, "Within the field of family law,
civil RICO claims have been attempted in divorce cases, but most plaintiffs
have been unsuccessful. However, a claim by a woman that her ex-husband,
along with the other defendants, participated in a fraudulent scheme to
conceal the true value of his income during the couple's divorce proceedings
has twice survived motions for summary judgment," Racketeer influenced
and corrupt organizations (2005-03-22). The source further notes that a
RICO action could potentially succeed in divorce cases if the plaintiff can
show "(i) an injury to business or property because of the divorce
proceedings; (ii) the plaintiff must show that the defendant acted as part of
an enterprise to further the act of hiding assets to minimize divorce
settlements."
Analysis of the Prima Facie RICO Case
Existence of an Enterprise
Based on the alleged facts, the three defendants (Morgan Michelle Myers,
Daniel Kenneth Branthoover, and Margie Evonne Wilson) coordinated their
actions to achieve common goals: unlawfully removing the plaintiff from his
residence, gaining an advantage in divorce proceedings, and finalizing the
divorce. Under the Boyle standard, this coordination appears to satisfy the
requirements for an "association-in-fact" enterprise.
According to Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938 (2009), an association-in-
fact enterprise must have "a purpose, relationships among those associated
with the enterprise, and longevity sufficient to permit these associates to
pursue the enterprise's purpose." The defendants' alleged coordinated
actions demonstrate a common purpose (removing the plaintiff and gaining
advantage in divorce proceedings), relationships among them (as they
worked together), and sufficient longevity to pursue their objectives (as
evidenced by the execution of multiple predicate acts over time).
As explained in Chapter 4. Elements of Cause of Action, "an association-in-
fact enterprise must have at least three structural features: a purpose,

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
relationships among those associated with the enterprise, and longevity
sufficient to permit these associates to pursue the enterprise's purpose." The
defendants' alleged coordination to achieve specific goals satisfies these
requirements.
Effect on Interstate Commerce
The interstate commerce requirement appears to be satisfied by the alleged
transfer of $1,576 across state lines via PayPal. As noted in RICO: A Primer
(2022-01-31), "there must be some nexus to interstate or foreign commerce
—it is a jurisdictional element of a civil RICO claim. Thus, predicate acts will
often occur in several States." The transfer of funds across state lines via an
electronic payment system clearly constitutes activity in interstate
commerce.
Courts have generally held that the effect on interstate commerce can be
minimal. As explained in Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy (2024-01-01), "RICO
requires no more than a slight effect upon interstate commerce. Even a
minimal effect on interstate commerce satisfies this jurisdictional
requirement." The electronic transfer of funds across state lines would likely
satisfy this "minimal effect" standard.
Association with the Enterprise
The defendants are alleged to be the primary participants in the enterprise
itself, clearly satisfying the requirement that they were "employed by or
associated with" the enterprise. Under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), it is unlawful for
"any person employed by or associated with any enterprise" to conduct the
enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity 18 U.S.C. §
1962(c) (2025).
Participation in the Conduct of the Enterprise's Affairs
The defendants allegedly participated directly in the conduct of the
enterprise's affairs by coordinating their actions to unlawfully remove the
plaintiff from his residence and gain an advantage in divorce proceedings.
According to Racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations (2010-03-22),
"Section 1962(c) prohibits persons employed by or associated with an
enterprise from conducting or participating in the conduct or the affairs of
that enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. A relationship
between the pattern of racketeering activity and the enterprise is required."
The same source clarifies that "One must play some role in directing the
affairs of the enterprise to 'conduct or participate' in the affairs of the
enterprise." The alleged coordination among the defendants to achieve their
common goals suggests that they each played a role in directing the
enterprise's affairs.

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Pattern of Racketeering Activity
The defendants allegedly engaged in multiple predicate acts that constitute
a pattern of racketeering activity:
Wire fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343): The transfer of $1,576 across state lines
via PayPal as part of the scheme.
Mail fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1341): Using the U.S. Mail to serve false
documents.
Obstruction of justice (18 U.S.C. § 1503): Knowingly filing false
statements in court documents to gain an advantage in divorce
proceedings.
These predicate acts fall within the definition of "racketeering activity"
under 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1), which specifically includes mail fraud, wire fraud,
and obstruction of justice 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1) (2025).
To establish a pattern, these acts must be both related and continuous.
According to H.J. Inc v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Company, 492 U.S. 229
(1989), "In order to prove a pattern of racketeering activity, a plaintiff or
prosecutor must show at least two racketeering predicates that are related
and that amount to, or threaten the likelihood of, continued criminal
activity."
The alleged predicate acts appear to be related as they were all part of a
common scheme to unlawfully remove the plaintiff from his residence and
gain an advantage in divorce proceedings. The continuity requirement may
be satisfied by showing either closed-ended continuity (a series of related
acts over a substantial period) or open-ended continuity (a threat of
continued criminal activity). The alleged "ongoing communications and
threats" suggest the possibility of continued criminal activity, potentially
satisfying the open-ended continuity requirement.
According to RECONCEIVING COERCION-BASED CRIMINAL DEFENSES
(2022-03-22), criminal conduct forms a pattern if it "embraces criminal acts
that have the same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or
methods of commission, or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing
characteristics and are not isolated events." The alleged predicate acts
share common purposes (gaining advantage in divorce proceedings),
participants (the three defendants), victims (the plaintiff), and are
interrelated parts of a coordinated scheme rather than isolated events.
Injury to Business or Property
The plaintiff alleges specific injuries to business and property resulting from
the defendants' racketeering activity:
Depletion of funds from the joint marital account
Cessation of business operations due to lack of funds
Eviction from the residence relied on for livelihood
1.

3.

=== PAGE 9 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
These alleged injuries satisfy the requirement under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c) that
a plaintiff be "injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of
section 1962" 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c) (2025). The financial losses (depletion of
funds and cessation of business) clearly constitute injuries to business and
property. The eviction from a residence relied on for livelihood also
represents an injury to property that affects business interests.
Conspiracy to Violate RICO
In addition to the substantive RICO violation under § 1962(c), the plaintiff
also alleges a conspiracy to violate RICO under § 1962(d). According to 18
U.S.C. § 1962(d) (2025), "It shall be unlawful for any person to conspire to
violate any of the provisions of subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section."
The Supreme Court has clarified that a RICO conspiracy does not require
that the conspirator personally commit any predicate acts. As noted in 
Salinas v. U.S., 522 U.S. 52, 118 S.Ct. 469, 139 L.Ed.2d 352 (1997), "To be
convicted of conspiracy to violate RICO under §1962(d), the conspirator
need not himself have committed or agreed to commit the two or more
predicate acts, such as bribery, requisite for a substantive RICO offense
under §1962(c)."
The alleged coordination among the defendants to achieve their common
goals suggests an agreement to conduct the enterprise's affairs through a
pattern of racketeering activity, which would satisfy the requirements for a
RICO conspiracy under § 1962(d).
Exceptions and Caveats
Standing Requirements in Civil RICO Cases
While the plaintiff appears to have satisfied the basic standing requirements
for a civil RICO claim by alleging specific injuries to business and property,
courts often scrutinize the causal connection between the alleged RICO
violation and the claimed injuries. The plaintiff would need to demonstrate
that the injuries were directly caused by the pattern of racketeering activity
rather than by other factors.
Application of RICO in Divorce Contexts
As noted in Racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations (2005-03-22),
"Within the field of family law, civil RICO claims have been attempted in
divorce cases, but most plaintiffs have been unsuccessful." While there have
been some successful cases, courts may be hesitant to apply RICO in what
might be characterized as primarily domestic disputes.
For a RICO claim to succeed in the divorce context, a plaintiff typically must
show more than just standard divorce-related disputes. The source suggests
that success may be possible if the plaintiff can demonstrate "(i) an injury to
business or property because of the divorce proceedings; (ii) the plaintiff

=== PAGE 10 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
must show that the defendant acted as part of an enterprise to further the
act of hiding assets to minimize divorce settlements." The plaintiff's
allegations of coordinated actions to unlawfully remove him from his
residence, causing business losses and property damage, may distinguish
this case from unsuccessful RICO claims in divorce proceedings.
Pleading Requirements for Fraud-Based Predicate Acts
The plaintiff's reliance on mail fraud and wire fraud as predicate acts may
face heightened pleading standards. According to Civil Rico: A Tool of
Advocacy (2024-01-01), "RICO claims based on mail or wire fraud must
comport with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b)'s requirement that
allegations involving fraud be pleaded with particularity." The plaintiff would
need to provide specific details about the allegedly fraudulent
communications, including their content, timing, and how they furthered the
fraudulent scheme.
Conclusion
Based on the provided legal authorities, the plaintiff has established a prima
facie case for a civil RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) and (d). The
alleged facts, if proven, would satisfy all the required elements:
The existence of an enterprise: The three defendants formed an
"association-in-fact" enterprise by coordinating their actions for a
common purpose, maintaining relationships, and engaging in conduct
with sufficient longevity to pursue their objectives, as defined in Boyle
v. United States, 556 U.S. 938 (2009).
Effect on interstate commerce: The transfer of funds across state lines
via PayPal satisfies the minimal interstate commerce requirement.
Association with the enterprise: The defendants were the primary
participants in the alleged enterprise.
Participation in the conduct of the enterprise's affairs: The defendants
allegedly coordinated their activities to direct the enterprise toward its
goals.
Pattern of racketeering activity: The defendants allegedly committed
multiple predicate acts (wire fraud, mail fraud, and obstruction of
justice) that were related and demonstrated continuity as part of a
common fraudulent scheme.
Additionally, the plaintiff has alleged specific injuries to business and
property resulting from the defendants' racketeering activity, satisfying the
standing requirements under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c).
While RICO claims in divorce proceedings face certain challenges, the
specific allegations in this case—involving coordinated actions to unlawfully
remove the plaintiff from his residence, causing concrete business and
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
5. 

=== PAGE 11 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
property injuries—may distinguish it from unsuccessful attempts to apply
RICO in domestic disputes.
If the plaintiff can provide sufficient evidence and meet the applicable
pleading standards, particularly for the fraud-based predicate acts, the
prima facie case for a civil RICO claim appears to be established based on
the available legal authorities.

USLW 4474 (2009)
U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
From the terms of RICO, it is apparent that an association-in-fact enterprise
must have at least three structural features: a purpose, relationships among
those associated with the enterprise, and longevity sufficient to permit these
associates to pursue the enterprise's purpose. As we succinctly put it in
Turkette, an association-in-fact enterprise is 'a group of persons associated
together for a common purpose of engaging in a course of conduct.' 452
U.S., at 583, 101 S.Ct. 2524.
Summary
An association-in-fact enterprise under RICO must have a purpose,
relationships among those associated, and longevity to pursue the
enterprise's purpose. This supports the proposition that the Defendants
formed such an enterprise by coordinating their actions for a common
purpose, maintaining relationships, and engaging in conduct over time.
P &amp; P MARKETING, INC. v. Ditton, 746 F. Supp. 1354 (N.D. Ill. 1990)
U.S. District Court — Northern District of Illinois
Extract
Civil actions for RICO violations are authorized by Section 1964(c) which
provides that 'any person injured in his business or property by reason of a
violation of Section 1962' may recover treble damages and costs including
attorney's fees. 18 USC § 1964(c); H.G. Gallimore, Inc. v. Abdula, 652
F.Supp. 437 (N.D.Ill.1987). Section 1962 sets out the prohibited conduct. 18
USC § 1962(a)-(d); see Id. at 439, 440. Plaintiff has alleged that defendants
violated Section 1962(c) which prohibits... Any person employed by or
associated with any enterprise, engaged in, or the activities of which affect,
interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or
indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt. 18 USC § 1962(c).
Regardless of which subsection of Section 1962 defendants are alleged to
have violated, five elements are common and necessary to every civil RICO
claim. These essential elements are: (1) a 'person'; (2) an 'enterprise'
engaged in or affecting interstate commerce; (3) 'racketeering activity'
which (4) occurred in a 'pattern' and (5) an injury. Id. at 440; 18 USC §
1962(a)-(d).
Summary
Essential elements required to establish a civil RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. §
1962, which directly supports the proposition by confirming the legal
framework necessary for such a claim. It emphasizes the need for an
enterprise, racketeering activity, and a pattern of such activity, all of which
are central to the proposition. The passage also highlights the potential for
recovery of damages under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c), which is relevant to the
Plaintiff's claim of injury.
Inc v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Company, 492 U.S. 229, 109 S.Ct. 2893,
106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989)
U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
In order to prove a pattern of racketeering activity, a plaintiff or prosecutor
must show at least two racketeering predicates that are related and that
amount to, or threaten the likelihood of, continued criminal activity. Proof of
neither relationship nor continuity requires a showing that the racketeering
predicates were committed in furtherance of multiple criminal schemes. ...
RICO renders criminally and civilly liable 'any person' who uses or invests
income derived 'from a pattern of racketeering activity' to acquire an
interest in or to operate an enterprise engaged in interstate commerce, §
1962(a); who acquires or maintains an interest in or control of such an
enterprise 'through a pattern of racketeering activity,' § 1962(b); who, being
employed by or associated with such an enterprise, conducts or participates
in the conduct of its affairs 'through a pattern of racketeering activity,' §
1962(c); or, finally, who conspires to violate the first three subsections of §
1962, § 1962(d).
Summary
The U.S. Supreme Court has clarified that to establish a "pattern of
racketeering activity," there must be at least two related predicate acts that
either amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity. This
interpretation supports the proposition that the Defendants' actions, which
include multiple predicate acts such as wire fraud and mail fraud, could
constitute a pattern of racketeering activity if they are related and pose a
threat of continued criminal activity.

Sedima v. Imrex Company, Inc, 473 U.S. 479, 105 S.Ct. 3275, 87 L.Ed.2d 346
(1985)
U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C.
§§ 1961-1968, which is directed at 'racketeering activity'—defined in §
1961(1) to encompass, inter alia, acts 'indictable' under specific federal
criminal provisions, including mail and wire fraud—provides in § 1964(c) for
a private civil action to recover treble damages by any person injured in his
business or property 'by reason of a violation of section 1962.' Section
1962(c) prohibits conducting or participating in the conduct of an enterprise
'through a pattern of racketeering activity.' ... A violation of § 1962(c), the
section on which Sedima relies, requires (1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3)
through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity. The plaintiff must, of course,
allege each of these elements to state a claim. Conducting an enterprise that
affects interstate commerce is obviously not in itself a violation of § 1962,
nor is mere commission of the predicate offenses. In addition, the plaintiff
only has standing if, and can only recover to the extent that, he has been
injured in his business or property by the conduct constituting the violation.
Summary
Elements required to establish a civil RICO claim, which include the conduct
of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity and the
requirement that the plaintiff be injured in their business or property by the
conduct constituting the violation. This directly supports the proposition that
the Defendants' coordinated actions could constitute a RICO violation if they
meet these elements.
City of New York v. Smokes-Spirits.Com, Inc., 541 F.3d 425 (2nd Cir. 2008)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Second Circuit
Extract
As explained further below, RICO makes it 'unlawful for any person
employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities
of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate,
directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a
pattern of racketeering activity.. . .' 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). The City alleges that
defendants engage in such a 'pattern of racketeering' by committing mail or
wire fraud each time they use, or cause to be used, the mails or wires to
effect a sale of cigarettes to New York City residents without complying with
the Jenkins Act's reporting requirements to the State.

Summary
The passage outlines the requirements for establishing a RICO violation
under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), which includes conducting or participating in an
enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity. The passage
also highlights that mail and wire fraud are considered forms of
racketeering activity under RICO. This supports the proposition by providing
a legal basis for the claim that the Defendants' actions, which include mail
and wire fraud, constitute a pattern of racketeering activity.
Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., Inc., 741 F.2d 482 (2nd Cir. 1984)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Second Circuit
Extract
Two of the RICO counts allege that the fraudulent purchase orders, invoices
and credit memoranda constitute a pattern of racketeering activity, the
predicate acts being separate and numerous violations of the Mail Fraud
Act, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1341 (1982) and the Wire Fraud Act, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1343
(1982). The third count charges a RICO conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. Sec.
1962(c) and (d). ... It is helpful to look back to the definition in section
1961(1) of 'racketeering activity,' since we are referred to section 1962 by
way of section 1964(c), and section 1962(a) makes 'a pattern of racketeering
activity' 'unlawful' in certain circumstances. Section 1961(1) describes four
distinct types of such activity. Those under subparagraph (A) include 'any
act or threat involving murder, kidnaping, gambling, arson, robbery, bribery,
extortion or dealing in narcotic or other dangerous drugs, which is
chargeable under State law' and is punishable by imprisonment for more
than one year (emphasis added). The 'racketeering activity' acts under
subparagraph (B) include 'any act which is indictable under' certain
provisions of federal law including mail fraud and wire fraud, in addition to
other typical organized crime activities (emphasis supplied).
Summary
Elements required to establish a RICO claim, including the need for a
pattern of racketeering activity, which can include acts of mail and wire
fraud. It also references the statutory definitions under 18 U.S.C. § 1961 and
§ 1962, which are directly relevant to the proposition that the Defendants
engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity through mail and wire fraud.
This supports the claim that the Defendants' actions could constitute a RICO
violation.

Extract
Plaintiff alleges that the Defendants conducted the management and
operation of the affairs of their own enterprises, directly or indirectly,
through a pattern of racketeering activity within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. §§
1961(1)(B), 1961(5), and 1962(c), in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c),
consisting of continuous and multiple instances of mail and wire fraud in
violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1341 and 1343. (Am.Compl.¶¶ 16, 64, 80, 90.) ...
Plaintiff alleges that various Defendants conducted the management and
operation of the affairs of an enterprise, directly or indirectly, through a
pattern of racketeering activity within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961(1)
(B), 1961(5), and 1962(c) and (d), in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) and (d),
consisting of continuous and multiple instances of mail and wire fraud in
violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1341 and 1343. (Am.Compl.¶¶ 16, 64, 80, 90.) ...
Racketeering activity is defined as the commission of one of the offenses
(predicate acts) enumerated in 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1). Such racketeering
activity under § 1961(1) includes mail fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1341
and wire fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1343.
Summary
The court recognizes the use of mail and wire fraud as predicate acts for
establishing a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO. The passage
supports the proposition by illustrating how allegations of mail and wire
fraud can form the basis of a RICO claim, which is similar to the Plaintiff's
allegations against the Defendants in the proposition.
Egerique v. Chowaiki, 19 Civ. 3110 (KPF) (S.D. N.Y. Apr 24, 2020)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of New York
Extract
Section 1962(c) makes it 'unlawful for any person employed by or associated
with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or
foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the
conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering
activity.' 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). Section 1962(d) applies the same prohibitions
to a defendant who conspires to violate subsection (c). Of particular
significance here, RICO affords a private right of action to individuals who
are harmed by racketeering activity. See 18 U.S.C. § 1964. This private right
of action allows a plaintiff to bring a claim under RICO for sustaining
injuries 'in his business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962.'
18 U.S.C. § 1964(c).
Summary
The passage outlines the legal framework for establishing a RICO claim
under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) and (d). It confirms that a plaintiff can bring a civil

RICO claim if they have been injured in their business or property due to a
violation of section 1962. The passage also highlights the requirement of a
"pattern of racketeering activity" and the involvement of an enterprise
affecting interstate commerce, which are key elements in the proposition.
Reynolds v. Condon, 908 F.Supp. 1494 (N.D. W.Va. 1996)
U.S. District Court — Northern District of West Virginia
Extract
The plaintiff here alleges that defendants have violated 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c),
which is the provision of RICO that makes it 'unlawful for any person ...
associated with an enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect,
interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or
indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of
racketeering activity. ...' 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c); Bowman, 985 F.2d at 384 n. 1;
Diamonds Plus, Inc., 960 F.2d at 768; Atlas Pile Driving Co., 886 F.2d at 990.
Thus, to establish a RICO violation under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) a plaintiff must
demonstrate '(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of
racketeering activity that must include at least two racketeering acts.'
Summary
The passage outlines the elements required to establish a RICO violation
under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), which aligns with the proposition's requirement
to demonstrate a pattern of racketeering activity through an enterprise. The
passage supports the proposition by confirming the legal framework
necessary to establish a RICO claim, which includes demonstrating conduct
of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity.

Summary
The passage outlines the necessary elements to establish a RICO violation
under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), which includes the conduct of an enterprise
through a pattern of racketeering activity. It emphasizes the distinction
between the enterprise and the pattern of racketeering activity, which is
crucial in establishing a RICO claim. This supports the proposition by
providing a legal framework for understanding how the Defendants'
coordinated actions could constitute a RICO violation.

U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
2.To be convicted of conspiracy to violate RICO under §1962(d), the
conspirator need not himself have committed or agreed to commit the two
or more predicate acts, such as bribery, requisite for a substantive RICO
offense under §1962(c). Section 1962(d)-which forbids 'any person to
conspire to violate' §1962(c)-is even more comprehensive than the general
conspiracy provision applicable to federal crimes, §371, since it contains no
requirement of an overt or specific act to effect the conspiracy's object.
Summary
Under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d), a person can be convicted of conspiracy to
violate RICO without having committed or agreed to commit the predicate
acts themselves. This supports the proposition that the Defendants could be
found liable for conspiring to violate RICO if they coordinated their actions
to achieve a common goal, even if they did not individually commit all the
predicate acts.
Lockhart v. Deluca
U.S. District Court — Eastern District of Michigan
Extract
The Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO, was
enacted to curb “racketeering activity,” which it defines as any act
“chargeable” under several generically described state criminal laws, any
act “indictable” under numerous specific federal criminal provisions,
including mail and wire fraud, and any “offense” involving bankruptcy or
securities fraud or drug-related activities that is “punishable” under federal
law.” 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1); see also Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., Inc., 473
U.S. 479, 481-82 (1985). For violations of RICO, Congress has provided
primarily criminal penalties. See 18 U.S.C. § 1963. But § 1964 establishes a

racketeering activity.” Sedima, S.P.R.L., 473 U.S. at 496.
Summary
Elements required to establish a RICO claim, which aligns with the
proposition's requirements for proving a civil RICO claim. It highlights the
necessity of demonstrating conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of
racketeering activity, which is central to the proposition. The passage also
references Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., a key case cited in the proposition,
reinforcing the legal framework for RICO claims.
Mauriber v. Shearson/American Exp., Inc., 546 F.Supp. 391 (S.D. N.Y. 1982)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of New York
Extract
RICO makes it unlawful (1) for any person to use or invest any income
derived from 'a pattern of racketeering activity ... in acquisition of any
interest in, or the establishment or operation of, any enterprise which is
engaged in ... interstate or foreign commerce,' 18 U.S.C. § 1962(a); (2) 'for
any person to acquire or maintain through a pattern of racketeering any
interest in or control of any enterprise engaged in interstate or foreign
commerce', id. § 1962(b); (3) 'for any person employed by or associated with
any enterprise engaged in ... interstate ... commerce, to conduct or
participate ... in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of
racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt,' id. § 1962(c); and (4)
'for any person to conspire to violate any of the above provisions.' Id. §
1962(d).
Summary
The passage from Mauriber v. Shearson/American Exp., Inc. provides a clear
explanation of the statutory framework of RICO under 18 U.S.C. § 1962,
which is directly relevant to the proposition. It outlines the unlawful
activities under RICO, including conducting or participating in an
enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity and conspiring
to violate these provisions. This supports the proposition by confirming that
the Defendants' alleged actions, if proven, could constitute a violation of
RICO under sections 1962(c) and (d).

Extract
To state a cause of action under RICO, Plaintiffs must establish (1) conduct
(2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity (5)
causing injury to the Plaintiffs' business or property by the conduct
constituting the violation. See Sedima v. Imrex Co., Inc., 473 U.S. 479, 496,
105 S.Ct. 3275, 87 L.Ed.2d 346 (1985). RICO, in pertinent part, defines
'racketeering activity,' as 'any act or threat ... which is indictable' under an
enumerated list of offenses codified in Title 18 of United States Code and
'which is chargeable under State law and punishable by imprisonment for
more than one year.' 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1). A pattern of racketeering activity
exists when a person commits two or more specified acts ('predicate acts')
that have sufficient continuity and relationship so as to pose a threat of
continued criminal activity.
Summary
The passage outlines the necessary elements to establish a RICO claim,
which aligns with the proposition's requirements. It confirms that a pattern
of racketeering activity requires at least two predicate acts that are related
and pose a threat of continued criminal activity. This supports the
proposition that the Defendants' actions could constitute a RICO violation if
they meet these criteria.
Portionpac Chemical Corp. v. Sanitech Systems, 217 F.Supp.2d 1238 (M.D.
Fla. 2002)
U.S. District Court — Middle District of Florida
Extract
Congress designed the Federal Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act (RICO), Title 18, United States Code, Section 1961, et
seq. as a flexible tool to fight organized crime. As such, it makes the
following activities unlawful: (a) investing income derived, directly or
indirectly, from a pattern of racketeering activity through collection of an
unlawful debt in any enterprise which affects interstate commerce; (b)
acquiring or maintaining an interest in any enterprise which affects
interstate commerce through a pattern of racketeering activity or through
collection of an unlawful debt; (c) conducting or participating in the affairs
of any enterprise which affects interstate commerce through a pattern of
racketeering activity or collection of an unlawful debt; or (d) conspiring to
violate any of the provisions of Section 1962(a)-(c). 18 U.S.C. § 1962.
'Racketeering activities' covers a wide range of federal and state crimes,
including acts that are '`chargeable' under several generically described
state criminal laws, any act 'indictable' under numerous specific federal
criminal provisions, including mail and wire fraud, and any 'offense'
involving bankruptcy or securities fraud or drug-related activities that [are]
'punishable' under federal law.' Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co. Inc., 473 U.S.
479, 482, 105 S.Ct. 3275, 87 L.Ed.2d 346 (1985) (quoting 18 U.S.C. §

1961(1)). To engage in a 'pattern of racketeering activity,' the defendant
must have participated in 'at least two acts of racketeering activity, one of
which occurred after the effective date of [RICO] and the last of which
occurred within ten years (excluding any term of imprisonment) after the
commission of a prior act of racketeering activity.' 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5).
Finally, 'enterprise' is defined under the statute as 'any individual,
partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or
group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.' Id. §
1961(c). RICO establishes both criminal and civil penalties for violations of
Section 1962. The civil remedies provision provides a private cause of action
for 'any person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of
Section 1962.' 18 U.S.C. § 1961(c).
Summary
Elements required to establish a civil RICO claim, which includes the
existence of an enterprise, a pattern of racketeering activity, and an injury to
business or property caused by the violation. It also specifies that mail and
wire fraud are considered predicate acts of racketeering activity. This
directly supports the proposition that the Defendants' actions, which include
wire fraud and mail fraud, could constitute a pattern of racketeering activity
under RICO.
18 U.S.C. § 1962 18 U.S.C. § 1962 Prohibited Activities
Extract
It shall be unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any
enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign
commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of
such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity or
collection of unlawful debt. It shall be unlawful for any person to conspire to
violate any of the provisions of subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section.
Summary
18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) and (d) make it unlawful for individuals associated with
an enterprise affecting interstate commerce to engage in or conspire to
engage in racketeering activities. This directly supports the proposition that
the Defendants' coordinated actions to unlawfully remove the Plaintiff from
his residence and gain an advantage in divorce proceedings could constitute
a violation of these provisions if they engaged in a pattern of racketeering
activity.

As used in this chapter- 'racketeering activity' means ... section 1341
(relating to mail fraud), section 1343 (relating to wire fraud), ... section 1503
(relating to obstruction of justice), ... 'enterprise' includes any individual,
partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or

after the commission of a prior act of racketeering activity;
Summary
The passage provides definitions for key terms used in the RICO statute,
such as "racketeering activity," "enterprise," and "pattern of racketeering
activity." These definitions are crucial for establishing the elements of a
RICO claim, as they outline what constitutes racketeering activity (including
mail fraud, wire fraud, and obstruction of justice) and what is required to
demonstrate a pattern of such activity. The passage supports the proposition
by confirming that the alleged actions of the Defendants (mail fraud, wire
fraud, and obstruction of justice) are recognized as predicate acts under
RICO, and that an "association-in-fact" enterprise can be formed by a group
of individuals working together for a common purpose.

Summary
The passage from 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c) provides the legal framework for a
plaintiff to bring a civil RICO claim if they have been injured in their
business or property due to a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1962. This directly
supports the proposition that the Plaintiff can establish a civil RICO claim
against the Defendants for their coordinated actions that resulted in injury
to the Plaintiff's business and property. The passage also outlines the
potential remedies available, including treble damages and attorney's fees,
which are relevant to the Plaintiff's claim.

Extract
Whoever, having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to
defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent
pretenses, representations, or promises, transmits or causes to be
transmitted by means of wire, radio, or television communication in
interstate or foreign commerce, any writings, signs, signals, pictures, or
sounds for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice, shall be fined
under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both.
Summary
18 U.S.C. § 1343 defines wire fraud as a crime involving the transmission of
communications in interstate or foreign commerce for the purpose of
executing a scheme to defraud. This statute is relevant to the proposition
because wire fraud is identified as a predicate act of racketeering activity
under RICO. The Defendants' alleged actions, such as the transfer of funds
across state lines via PayPal, could constitute wire fraud, thereby supporting
the claim of a pattern of racketeering activity.

American Criminal Law Review - Georgetown University Law Center -
Sacks, Michele - 2005-03-22
Extract
Within the field of family law, civil RICO claims have been attempted in
divorce cases, (342) but most plaintiffs have been unsuccessful. (343)
However, a claim by a woman that her ex-husband, along with the other
defendants, participated in a fraudulent scheme to conceal the true value of
his income during the couple's divorce proceedings (344) has twice survived
motions for summary judgment. (345) At least one commentator believes it
is possible for a RICO action to be successfully litigated in the area of
divorce if it meets the following criteria: (i) the plaintiff must show an injury
to business or property because of the divorce proceedings; (ii) the plaintiff
must show that the defendant acted as part of an enterprise to further the
act of hiding assets to minimize divorce settlements;
Summary
Civil RICO claims can be applied in divorce cases if the plaintiff can
demonstrate injury to business or property and that the defendants acted as
part of an enterprise to further fraudulent activities. This aligns with the
proposition that the Defendants coordinated their actions to unlawfully

Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.
American Criminal Law Review - Georgetown University Law Center -
Bailey, Lisa Pritchard - 1999-06-22
Extract
The first element of RICO requires two or more predicate acts of
'racketeering activity.'(28) RICO defendants need not be convicted of each
underlying offense before a civil or criminal RICO offense is charged.(29)
Under [sections] 1961(1), the term 'racketeering activity' includes a broad
assortment of state and federal crimes. These crimes include: (a) certain
acts that are chargeable under state laws and punishable by imprisonment
for more than one year;(30) (b) acts that are indictable under specified
provisions of Title 18;(31)... In Reves v. Ernst & Young,(189) the Supreme
Court held that the requisite nexus exists only when the defendant's
predicate acts 'rise to the level' of participation in the management or
operation of the enterprise. Although RICO liability does not rest solely upon
those with primary responsibility for the enterprise's affairs, to 'conduct or
participate' in the affairs of the enterprise, one must play some role in
directing the affairs of the enterprise.(190)...
Summary
The RICO statute requires at least two predicate acts of racketeering
activity, which can include a variety of state and federal crimes. The passage
also clarifies that defendants do not need to be convicted of these
underlying offenses before a RICO charge is brought. Additionally, the Reves
v. Ernst & Young case establishes that participation in the enterprise's
affairs requires some level of management or operational involvement,
which aligns with the proposition that the Defendants coordinated their
actions to achieve a common goal.

5.5 General Elements of Section 1962(c) Section 1962(c) of RICO prohibits
the conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. To
prove liability under section 1962(c), the plaintiff must establish each of the
following elements by a preponderance of the evidence: First, that the
defendant was a person employed by or associated with an enterprise that
the plaintiff alleges to be [identify the enterprise]; Second, that [the
enterprise] was engaged in, ... 5.8 Conduct 5.8.1 Insiders Among the other
elements the plaintiff must prove to establish RICO liability on the part of
the defendant are that the defendant was employed by or associated with

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
the enterprise and conducted or participated in the conduct of the affairs of
the enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. In this regard, you
must find that the defendant participated in the operation or management of
the enterprise itself and was involved in the alleged unlawful activities. To
participate in the operation or management of an enterprise, a defendant
must have had some part in directing the enterprise’s affairs ... 5.9
Racketeering Activity The next term I will define for you is the term “act of
racketeering activity.” An act of racketeering activity includes any act or
threat that is indictable as a violation of certain federal statutes, or
chargeable under certain state criminal laws. Here, the plaintiff contends
that defendant engaged in [describe the RICO violations that are alleged].
COMMENT As noted in Section 5.1 supra, 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1) identifies the
RICO predicate “acts of racketeering activity.” The most commonly charged
RICO predicate acts are mail fraud and wire fraud, 18 U.S. ... 5.11 Pattern of
Racketeering Activity 5.11.1 Definition Now I will define the term “pattern
of racketeering activity.” A pattern of racketeering activity requires at least
two acts of racketeering activity within ten years of each other [one of which
must have occurred after October 15, 1970]. Those acts must be related to
each other, and must also amount to, or pose a threat of, continuing criminal
activity. [Here, describe the alleged pattern of racketeering activity.] In
determining whether these alleged acts, if proved, constituted a pattern of
racketeering activity, you should consider the following factors. First, acts
are “related” within the meaning of RICO if they embrace criminal acts that
have the same or ... rupt Organizations (RICO) Statute (a) That the
defendant conspired with others to violate section 1962 [insert applicable
subsection]; (b) That the defendant knowingly agreed with others to become
part of the alleged conspiracy; (c) That when the defendant joined in the
agreement, the defendant had the specific intent either to personally
participate in committing at least two acts of racketeering; or else to
participate in the enterprise’s affairs, knowing that some other member(s) of
the conspiracy would commit at least two acts of racketeering and intending
to help them as part of a pattern of racketeering activity; and (d) That the
plaintiff suffered an injury caused by an “act of racketeering activity” as I
have defined that term.
Summary
The passages outline the elements required to establish a RICO claim under
18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) and (d), including the need for an enterprise, the
defendant's association with the enterprise, participation in the enterprise's
affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity, and the requirement of at
least two predicate acts. The passages also define what constitutes
racketeering activity and a pattern of such activity, which are essential to
the proposition. The material provides a legal framework that supports the
proposition that the Defendants' coordinated actions could be considered a
RICO violation.

Summary
The passage outlines the requirements for establishing a RICO claim,

the definition of an enterprise, and the conduct of an enterprise's affairs
through a pattern of racketeering activity. This supports the proposition by
providing the legal framework necessary to argue that the Defendants'
actions meet the criteria for a RICO claim.

Section 1962(c) prohibits persons employed by or associated with an
enterprise from conducting or participating in the conduct or the affairs of
that enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. A relationship
between the pattern of racketeering activity and the enterprise is required.
In Reves v. Ernst & Young, the Supreme Court held that the requisite nexus
exists only when the defendant participates in the management or operation
of the enterprise. Actions involving a low degree of decision-making may not
constitute participation in the affairs of the enterprise. One must play some
role in directing the affairs of the enterprise to 'conduct or participate' in the
affairs of the enterprise.
Summary
Participation requires some role in directing the enterprise's affairs, which
aligns with the proposition that the defendants coordinated their actions to

achieve a common goal. The passage supports the notion that the
defendants' actions could constitute participation in an enterprise's affairs if
they were involved in managing or operating the enterprise.

Section 1962(c) prohibits persons employed by or associated with an

not been convicted of predicate acts under mail or wire fraud statutes did
not bar plaintiff's claim).
Summary
The passage explains that under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), individuals associated
with an enterprise can be held liable for conducting the enterprise's affairs
through a pattern of racketeering activity. It also clarifies that a formal
conviction of predicate acts is not necessary for liability to attach, which
supports the proposition that the Defendants can be held liable under RICO
even if they have not been formally convicted of the alleged predicate acts.
This aligns with the Plaintiff's claim that the Defendants engaged in a
pattern of racketeering activity to achieve their objectives.

To prosecute a defendant under RICO, the government must prove that the
defendant: (i) through the commission of two or more acts constituting a
pattern of racketeering activity; (ii) directly or indirectly invested in,
maintained an interest in, or participated in, an enterprise; (iii) the activities
of which affected interstate or foreign commerce. ... The effect on interstate
commerce element may also be satisfied by proof that the enterprise's
activities have an impact on interstate commerce, including activities that
'affect interstate commerce by impacting the victim.' ... Activities expressly

prohibited under [section] 1962 include: (i) investing income from a pattern
of racketeering activity; (ii) acquiring or maintaining an interest in an
enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity; (iii) conducting the
affairs of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity; and (iv)
conspiring to do any of the above.
Summary
The passage outlines the elements required to prosecute a defendant under
RICO, which aligns with the elements needed to establish a civil RICO claim
as described in the proposition. The passage confirms that a pattern of
racketeering activity, participation in an enterprise, and an effect on
interstate commerce are necessary components, which are all elements
present in the proposition.

Extract
A pattern of racketeering activity is a series of criminal acts as defined in §
1961(1), and the enterprise is generally a group of persons associated
together for a common purpose of engaging in a course of
conduct” (emphasis in original). In Turkette, the Supreme Court declared
that “[t]he ‘enterprise’ is not the ‘pattern of racketeering activity,’ it is an
entity separate and apart from the pattern of activity in which it engages.”
Turkette, 452 U.S. at 583. Boyle addressed the question: “[M]ust the
‘structure’ go ‘beyond that inherent in the pattern of racketeering activity’
in which its members engage?” Boyle, 566 U.S. at 945. Boyle answered this
in the affirmative.
Summary
The passage explains the distinction between an "enterprise" and a "pattern
of racketeering activity," emphasizing that an enterprise is a separate entity
from the pattern of activity. This supports the proposition by clarifying that
the Defendants formed an "association-in-fact" enterprise, as defined in
Boyle, by coordinating their actions for a common purpose. The passage also
highlights the requirement for a structure beyond the inherent pattern of
racketeering activity, which aligns with the Defendants' coordinated actions
to achieve their objectives.

Section 1962(c), the most commonly used RICO provision, prohibits persons
employed by or associated with an enterprise from conducting or
participating in the conduct or affairs of that enterprise through a pattern of
racketeering activity. A relationship, or nexus, between the pattern of
racketeering activity and the enterprise is required. ... the 'enterprise' in [§
1962(c)] connotes generally the vehicle through which the unlawful pattern
of racketeering activity is committed, rather than the victim of that activity.
Subsection (c) makes it unlawful for 'any person employed by or associated
with any enterprise . . . to conduct or participate . . . in the conduct of such
enterprise’s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity . . . .'
Consequently, since the enterprise in subsection (c) is not being acquired, it
need not have a property interest that can be acquired nor an economic
motive for engaging in illegal activity; it need only be an association in fact
that engages in a pattern of racketeering activity.
Summary
The passage explains the requirements for a RICO claim under § 1962(c),
emphasizing the need for an enterprise and a pattern of racketeering
activity. It supports the proposition by clarifying that an "association-in-fact"
enterprise can exist without a property interest or economic motive, aligning
with the Plaintiff's claim that the Defendants formed such an enterprise to
achieve their unlawful goals.

Summary
The passage outlines the elements necessary to establish a RICO violation,
including the requirement of participating in an enterprise through a
pattern of racketeering activity affecting interstate commerce. This directly
supports the proposition that the Defendants' actions could constitute a
RICO violation if they engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity as part of
an enterprise affecting interstate commerce.
Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy
The Brief - American Bar Association - 2024-01-01
Extract
A violation of § 1962(c), the section on which Sedima relies, requires (1)
conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity. The plaintiff must allege each of the elements to state a claim. They
are all equally essential components, and the complaint will fail if any one of
them is not adequately pleaded. In particular, RICO claims based on mail or
wire fraud must comport with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b)’s
requirement that allegations involving fraud be pleaded with particularity.
The practitioner through their pleadings must articulate with great care and
attention a viable racketeering claim. In addition, § 1962(a), (b), and (c) are
limited in scope to conduct involving enterprises engaged in or the activities
of which affect interstate commerce. It is the activities of the enterprise, not
each predicate act, that must affect interstate or foreign commerce. RICO
requires no more than a slight effect upon interstate commerce. Even a
minimal effect on interstate commerce satisfies this jurisdictional
requirement.
Summary
Essential elements required to establish a civil RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. §
1962(c), which includes conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of
racketeering activity. It emphasizes the need for particularity in pleading
fraud-related RICO claims and highlights the minimal effect on interstate
commerce required. This supports the proposition by confirming the legal
framework and requirements for a civil RICO claim, which align with the
Plaintiff's allegations against the Defendants.

Extract
The inquiry here is meant to invoke the 'pattern of racketeering activity'
element of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).
The Organized Crime Control Act (1970), which includes RICO, provides that
'criminal conduct forms a pattern if it embraces criminal acts that have the
same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of
commission, or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics
and are not isolated events.' The Supreme Court characterized this
requirement as a 'relationship' element and held that the statute further
requires a 'continuity' element, 'referring either to a closed period of
repeated conduct, or to past conduct that by its nature projects into the
future with a threat of repetition.'
Summary
The passage provides a detailed explanation of what constitutes a "pattern
of racketeering activity" under RICO. It highlights the need for related
criminal acts that are not isolated and have continuity, either through
repeated conduct or conduct that poses a threat of future repetition. This
directly supports the proposition that the Defendants' actions form a pattern
of racketeering activity as they were part of a common fraudulent scheme
with continuity and related criminal acts.
RICO: A Primer
Extract
Among other things, 'racketeering activities' include 'any act which is
indictable under' a list of federal criminal statutes. The list covers an
expansive range of violations, for example, violations of the Hobbs Act, 18
U.S.C. ' 1951 (extortion); 18 U.S.C. ' 1341 (mail fraud) and 1343 (wire fraud);
18 U.S.C. ' 1831 (economic espionage); 18 U.S.C. ' 1832 (theft of trade
secrets); 18 U.S.C. ' 1952 (Travel Act); 18 U.S.C. ' 1956, 1957 (money
laundering); and 18 U.S.C. ' 2318-2320 (copyright infringement). Mail and
wire fraud are the most common predicate acts. Notably, there must be
some nexus to interstate or foreign commerce-it is a jurisdictional element
of a civil RICO claim. Thus, predicate acts will often occur in several States.
Summary
The passage outlines that mail and wire fraud are common predicate acts
under RICO, which aligns with the proposition that the Defendants engaged
in such acts. It also emphasizes the requirement of a nexus to interstate
commerce, which is relevant to the Plaintiff's claim that the Defendants'
actions affected interstate commerce. The passage supports the elements
required to establish a RICO claim, including the existence of an enterprise
and a pattern of racketeering activity.

predicate acts pose a threat of continued criminal activity, which is generally
demonstrated by showing either: * Closed-ended continuity. Proving 'a series
of related predicate acts extending over a substantial period of time.' *
Open-ended continuity. A threat of 'continuing criminal activity extending
indefinitely into the future,' in light of the nature of the enterprise and
predicate acts alleged.
Summary
Elements required to establish a RICO claim, including the need for
predicate acts such as mail and wire fraud, which are relevant to the
proposition. It also discusses the requirement for a nexus to interstate
commerce and the concept of continuity in demonstrating a pattern of
racketeering activity. These elements are directly relevant to the
proposition, which alleges that the Defendants engaged in a pattern of
racketeering activity through mail and wire fraud, affecting interstate
commerce.
