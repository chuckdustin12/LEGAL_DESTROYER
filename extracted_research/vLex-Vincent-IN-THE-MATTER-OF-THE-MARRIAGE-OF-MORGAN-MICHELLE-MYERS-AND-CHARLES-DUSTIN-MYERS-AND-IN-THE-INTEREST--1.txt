And In the interest ofM.E.M. and C.R.M., two children. TO THE
HONORABLE CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT OF TEXAS:
COMES NOW, Respondent, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, who respectfully
submits this First Amended Motion to Recuse the Regional Presiding Judge,
David L. Evans, and in support thereof, shows the Court the following: Since
December of 2023, Respondent has pied time and time again regarding a
fraudulent scheme to divest him of his business and property that began
with Morgan Michelle Myers and Daniel Kenneth Branthoover, involving
interstate travel and communications. Each time the Respondent has utilized
a legal pathway, he has been met with unjustifiable conduct that has, by its'
very nature, willfully expanded the scope of the initial MyersBranthoover
enterprise into what it is today - a collection of officials, attorneys, and court
staff members that who - when presented with unrefuted facts, and were
made aware of the fraudulent scheme - chose to become entangled with the
enterprise's affairs. It is ofupmost importance to our judicial system that the
following issues be adjudicated, and a fair and impartial judge preside over
this matter who will not tolerate such behavior. Exhibit 1 Page 1 of 16 I.
SCOPE The factual allegations raised herein are not conclusory and are
supported by the record directly. Furthermore, given that Respondent has
filed six mandamus petitions naming Honorables James Munford, Jeffrey
Kaitcer, Kenneth Newell, Kate Stone, David Evans, and John Cayce as
respondents, the record exists within the public domain and can be found

judge, two court coordinators, one deputy clerk, and a licensed attorney,
forming an associate-in-fact enterprise for purposes of RICO, as explained
below. II. GROUNDS FOR RECUSAL The Regional Presiding Judge has
permitted and recklessly tolerated an ongoing RICO Enterprise that
continues to expand within the Texas Judiciary due to the collective and
willful neglect by the enjoined individuals to uphold their mandatory duties.
By neglecting the responsibilities of his position of power, David L. Evans
has inadvertently aided in the furtherance of the RICO enterprise's primary
objective: to secure a fraudulent final decree of divorce and escape
accountability. As the record establishes, the Respondent has exhausted
every appellate and administrative remedy in an attempt to seek redress.
Unopposed relief continues to be denied, and more predicate acts in
furtherance of the enterprise's affairs continue to occur. For the forthcoming
reasons, David L. Evans must recuse from this matter: ExhRlit 1 Page 2 of
16 II. GROUNDS FOR RECUSAL A. Disregard for Recusal Procedure 1.
Texas law mandates strict adherence to procedural safeguards in the recusal
process to ensure both actual and apparent judicial impartiality. When a
court coordinator-who is not a neutral party and serves at the pleasure of
the judge subject to recusal-handles the administrative delivery of a recusal
motion, this contravenes the explicit requirements of Rule 18a(e) and
creates an appearance of impropriety. 2. David L. Evans has allowed the
coordinator Lindsey Baker - not the clerk - to handle the duties the
legislature explicitly designates to court clerks. Rule l 8a( e )(2) plainly
states that " ... when a respondent judge signs and files an order of recusal
or referral, the clerk of the court must immediately deliver a copy to the
regional presiding judge." 3. Furthermore, as Rule 18(a)(f)(3) also plainly
states," ... if the respondent judge fails to comply with a duty imposed by
this rule, the movant may notify the regional presiding judge." 4. Here, the
Regional Presiding Judge was notified of and provided with a modified
version of the recusal motion rather than the original, and was notified of
these discrepancies, but chose to ignore them. B. Recusal Tampering 5. The
record facially establishes that on October 7, 2024, the Respondent filed a
Joint Motion to Recuse Honorable Judges James Munford and Jeffrey Kaitcer
from the matter and provided supporting evidence which is self-
authenticating under the Texas Rules of Evidence. 6. The following day, on
October 8 at 4:42 P.M., correspondence was received from court coordinator
Lindsey Baker regarding the order of referral. REC. 1277 Exhibit 1 Page 3 of
16 7. Upon inspection, it was discovered that the affidavit and exhibits were
both missing from the motion which was sent to the Regional Judge, and this
was quickly pointed out to the coordinator. 8. She confirms that the exhibits
were indeed filed electronically but as the clerk's office prefers - they were
filed as one document, just as the Tarrant County District Clerk's Filing FAQ
states: Q: "What process should be used for eFiling exhibits?" A: "Same
process for exhibit as initial filings- Exhibits should be merged into one
document with the lead document." REC. 1262. C. Repeated Tampering 9.
The record facially shows that on October 10, 2024, Judge James Munford
filed an "Amended Order of Referral" and once again the correspondence to
David L Evans was handled by the coordinator. 10. This time, the
coordinator claimed that due to the "size of the motion" that it could be
justified to split the motion into three separate files, this time with the
exhibits and affidavit included, defeating the entire purpose of removing the
exhibits and affidavit two days earlier. REC. 1282 D. Objecting 11. All of

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
these issues were raised in both notice and an objection filed timely after
these issues were discovered. REC. 1245-1252 It included all email
exchanges with the coordinator, the modifications of the original motion,
with the objection specifically stating that "the explanation changed to the
document being too large. This inconsistency raises concerns about
transparency and procedural fairness." No action was taken by David Evans.
Exhibit 1 Page 4 of 16 .• E. Subsequent Recusals 12. After waiting four
months for the judges to be reinstated as per David Evans' order,
Respondent had to reach out to the court coordinator to remind her to
reinstate the trial judges. REC. 1306. 13. The Respondent, in the face of a
serious dental emergency for his youngest child, opened a separate SAPCR
suit, arguing for dominant jurisdiction, (REC. 2088) only to be denied access
to the courts by Judges Kate Stone and Kenneth Newell, which prevented an
emergency TRO needed for the safety and welfare of the Respondent's
children. This negligence lead to a direct injury to the youngest child in this
case and three concurrent mandamus petitions followed, none of which
received any response from the implicated Judges. See 25-0361, 25- 0367,
25-0378. 14. In the midst of these efforts, James Munford continued to
ignore the issues and after the SAPCR was improperly consolidated by Judge
Newell, Judge Munford chose to move the case towards final deposition,
which was promptly objected to and ignored the same. REC. 2480. 15. These
actions lead to the second recusal motion, facially naming James Munford as
the respondent judge. REC. 2488. 16. This time, David Evans addressed two
major issues raised in an objection by the Respondent: i. The continued
involvement of Lindsey Baker, the court coordinator; ii. The erroneous order
of referral sent by Judge Kaitcer; REC. 2620 17. In his order, he argued that
"The court coordinators and clerks work together to assist the trial judges
and the administrative judges. Only the judges, not the litigants, have the
authority to direct the activities of the court coordinators and clerks. Mr.
Myers' objections regarding the involvement are overruled" REC. 3507.
Exhibit 1 Page 5 of 16 18. This argument fails - because the rules of
procedure does not designate any role to the Court Coordinator, and based
on prior conduct - her involvement has facially created ambiguity in a
process designed to promote transparency and fairness. By refusing to
comply with the Rule 18a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure in multiple
recusal proceedings - there is no question regarding his impartiality - it has
been compromised by, what the Respondent believes to be, political reasons.
19. Even when raising these issues to the highest Court in the State on
direct appeal, leading to cause numbers 25-0426 and 25-0458, which related
to compliance with Rule 18a and the entertainment and subsequent denial
of a motion which was never filed, resulting in five concurrent mandamus
petitions before the Texas Supreme Court. 20. All that was received in
response to these efforts was "Denied, per curiam". Respondent understands
that the Court of appeals has the discretion to issue such explanations,
however, given the scope of these issues, they cannot be addressed at final
disposition, and based on everything above, there no reasonable possibility
that one would think that there could be a fair and impartial trial given
these circumstances. This will only lead to further appeals and more wasted
judicial resources when these issues could just be dealt with at present. 21.
The regional judge's repeated failure to follow mandatory recusal
procedures-by denying hearings on recusal motions, involving non-neutral
staff, and failing to provide meaningful appellate remedies-constitutes a

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
pattern of procedural irregularities that violates both statutory requirements
and the fundamental due process right to a fair and impartial tribunal. Texas
law is clear that recusal is required whenever a judge's conduct creates
reasonable doubt as to impartiality, and the deprivation of a meaningful
appellate remedy further supports the necessity of recusal to protect the
substantive rights of the parties and restore confidence in Exhiit 1 Page 6 of
16 the judicial process. The authorities provided leave no doubt that
adherence to recusal procedures is essential to the integrity of the Texas
judicial system. III. CONCLUSION AND PRAYER Respondent has suffered
significant damages, which continue to accrue, and unexplained and
unethical behavior continues to run afoul within this administrative region.
He has provided the Court and several judicial officers with multiple
opportunities in tandem with the information needed to address these
pressing issues, but rather than address them, they continue to compound
these issues for unknown reasons. Court: Therefore, for all reasons stated
herein, Respondent respectfully pray that this Honorable 1. Grant this
motion to recuse; 2. Effectuate a stay of these proceedings immediately to
preserve the integrity of the Texas judiciary; 3. Provide interim relief to the
Respondent pursuant to Rule 18a(g)(4) that restores his property interests;
4. Require the Petitioner and her counsel, for the first time in this matter, be
required to provide a written response; 5. Provide any further relief the
Court deems just and right under these circumstances. Respectfully, Isl

CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS INTRODUCTION AND VERIFICATION I,
CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, being of sound mind and over the age of
eighteen (18) years, hereby swear and affirm under penalty of perjury
pursuant to Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code§ 132.001 that I am
personally familiar with the facts stated herein, that I have personal
knowledge of the matters stated in this affidavit, that the statements made
herein are true and correct, and that I am competent to make this affidavit.
FACTUAL BACKGROUND 1. I am the Respondent in cause number
322-744263-23, styled "Morgan Michelle Myers v. Charles Dustin Myers,"
currently pending in the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County, Texas. 2.
Since December of 2023, I have repeatedly attempted to address a
fraudulent scheme to divest me of my business and property interests
through proper legal channels. Each time I have utilized legitimate legal
pathways, I have been met with procedural irregularities and violations that
have prevented fair adjudication of my claims. 3. The Regional Presiding
Judge, Honorable David L. Evans, has been directly involved in handling
multiple recusal proceedings related to my case, and has consistently failed
to follow the mandatory procedures required by Texas law, as detailed
below. 4. I have exhausted all available appellate and administrative
remedies in my attempts to seek redress. Despite filing multiple mandamus
petitions with the Texas Supreme Court (cause numbers 25-0361, 25-0367,
25-0378, 25-0426, and 25-0458), I have received only "Denied, per curiam"
responses without substantive consideration of the serious procedural
violations occurring in my case. Exhibit 1 Page 8 of 16 PROCEDURAL
VIOLATIONS 5. On October 7, 2024, I filed a Joint Motion to Recuse
Honorable Judges James Munford and Jeffrey Kaitcer, including supporting
evidence and a properly executed affidavit as required by Texas Rule of Civil
Procedure 18a. 6. On October 8, 2024, at 4:42 P.M., I received

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
correspondence from court coordinator Lindsey Baker regarding the order
of referral. Upon inspection, I discovered that both my affidavit and
supporting exhibits had been removed from the motion that was sent to
Regional Judge Evans. 7. I immediately notified the court coordinator that
the exhibits and affidavit were missing from the materials sent to Judge
Evans. The coordinator confirmed that my exhibits were indeed filed
electronically as one document with the lead document, in accordance with
the Tarrant County District Clerk's Filing FAQ, which states: "Same process
for exhibit as initial filings- Exhibits should be merged into one document
with the lead document." 8. On October 10, 2024, Judge James Munford filed
an "Amended Order of Referral," and once again the correspondence to
Judge Evans was handled by the court coordinator Lindsey Baker rather
than the clerk of the court as required by Rule 18a( e )(2). 9. This time, the
coordinator claimed that the "size of the motion" justified splitting it into
three separate files, this time including the exhibits and affidavit that had
been previously omitted, thereby contradicting the earlier handling of the
motion. I 0. These actions directly violated Texas Rule of Civil Procedure
18a( e )(2), which explicitly states: "When a respondent judge signs and files
an order of recusal or referral, the clerk of the court must immediately
deliver a copy to the regional presiding judge." Exhiit 1 Page 9 of 16 11. The
law does not permit a court coordinator, who serves at the pleasure of the
judge subject to recusal, to handle this sensitive procedural matter. Instead
of the neutral clerk of court processing these materials as required by
statute, the court coordinator for the very judge whose impartiality was
being questioned took possession of and modified the recusal motion.
OBJECTIONS AND LACK OF REMEDY 12. I timely filed formal objections to
these procedural irregularities, including documentation of all email
exchanges with the coordinator and the modifications made to my original
motion. 13. My objection specifically stated that "the explanation changed to
the document being too large. This inconsistency raises concerns about
transparency and procedural fairness." 14. Judge Evans took no action to
remedy these procedural violations despite being properly notified of them.
15. After waiting four months for the judges to be reinstated as per Judge
Evans' order, I had to personally reach out to the court coordinator to
remind her to reinstate the trial judges. 16. When I filed a second recusal
motion naming Judge Munford as the respondent judge, Judge Evans issued
an order addressing my objections regarding: a. The continued involvement
of Lindsey Baker, the court coordinator; and b. The erroneous order of
referral sent by Judge Kaitcer. 17. In his order, Judge Evans stated: "The
court coordinators and clerks work together to assist the trial judges and
the administrative judges. Only the judges, not the litigants, have the
authority to direct the activities of the court coordinators and clerks. Mr.
Myers' objections regarding the involvement are overruled." Exhl!Slt 1 Page
10 of 16 18. This reasoning directly contradicts the plain language of Rule
18a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, which does not designate any role
to the court coordinator in the recusal process, and instead explicitly assigns
these duties to the clerk of the court. PATTERN OF CONDUCT AND HARM
19. As a direct result of these procedural violations and Judge Evans' failure
to remedy them, I have suffered substantial harm, including but not limited
to: a. Being denied access to the courts when I sought emergency relief for
my youngest child who was facing a serious dental emergency; b. Being
denied the opportunity for a fair hearing on my recusal motions; c. Having

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
my properly filed motions improperly modified before being presented to the
decision-maker; d. Being subjected to biased handling of critical procedural
matters by non-neutral staff members who serve at the pleasure of the
judges whose impartiality I was challenging; and e. Suffering financial harm
through the continued deprivation of my property and business interests
while these procedural violations remain unaddressed. 20. In the face of a
serious dental emergency for my youngest child, I opened a separate SAPCR
suit, arguing for dominant jurisdiction, only to be denied access to the
courts by Judges Kate Stone and Kenneth Newell, which prevented an
emergency TRO needed for the safety and welfare of my children. This
negligence led to a direct injury to my youngest child. Ex~Sit 1 Page 11 of
16 21. After the SAPCR was improperly consolidated by Judge Newell, Judge
Munford moved the case toward final disposition, which I promptly objected
to. My objections were ignored. 22. This pattern of procedural violations has
persisted despite my repeated, documented efforts to seek proper
administration of justice through the channels provided by Texas law. LEGAL
AUTHORITIES 23. Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a establishes mandatory
procedures for the recusal of judges, including the requirement that "the
clerk of the court must immediately deliver a copy [of the recusal motion] to
the regional presiding judge" under Rule 18a(e)(2). 24. The Texas
Constitution Article V, Section 1-a provides that judges may be removed for
incompetence, partiality, oppression, official misconduct, or failure to
execute their official duties. 25. Texas Government Code§ 33.001 defines
judicial misconduct to include willful or persistent violation of rules
promulgated by the Supreme Court of Texas and willful or persistent
conduct that is clearly inconsistent with the proper performance of judicial
duties. 26. Texas Penal Code § 39.02 prohibits abuse of official capacity by
public servants, providing that a public servant commits an offense if, with
intent to harm another, they intentionally or knowingly violate a law relating
to their office. 27. Texas Penal Code § 39.03 prohibits official oppression,
stating that a public servant commits an offense if they intentionally deny or
impede another in the exercise of their rights, privileges, powers, or
immunities, knowing their conduct is unlawful. Exhl!Jlt 1 Page 12 of 16 28.
Under established Texas case law, recusal is required not only for actual bias
but also where procedural irregularities create an appearance of
impropriety or reasonable doubt as to a judge's impartiality. See Sears v.
Nueces County Sheriff Olivarez, 28 S. W.3d 611 (Tex. App. 2000) . 29. The
Texas Supreme Court has emphasized that judges must strictly adhere to
recusal procedures to preserve public confidence in the judiciary. See In re
Inquiry Concerning Honorable Bonnie Rangel, 677 S.W.3d 918 (Tex. 2023).
CONCLUSION AND PRAYER FOR RELIEF 30. Based on all the foregoing
facts, I respectfully assert that Judge David L. Evans has demonstrated a
pattern of disregard for the mandatory recusal procedures established by
Texas law, creating both an appearance of impropriety and reasonable doubt
as to his impartiality in handling matters related to my case. 31. His failure
to adhere to the clear requirements of Rule 18a, combined with his explicit
approval of non-neutral staff handling sensitive recusal materials in
contravention of the rule's plain language, constitutes grounds for recusal
under Texas law. 32. I respectfully request that this Honorable Court: a.
Grant this first amended motion to recuse Judge David L. Evans; b.
Effectuate an immediate stay of these proceedings to preserve the integrity
of the Texas judiciary; c. Provide interim relief pursuant to Rule 18a(g)(4)

that restores my property interests; d. Require the Petitioner and her
counsel to provide a written response to the allegations contained herein;

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Kaitcer filed by Charles Dustin Myers. This motion was referred to me after
Associate Judge Jeff Kaitcer declined to recuse himself by order dated
September 9, 2025. Mr. Myers has filed three or more motions to recuse
and/or disqualify judges in this case. When a party files his third motion to
recuse in a case, the judge(s) must move the case to final disposition as
though a tertiary recusal motion had not been filed. Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.
Code § 30.016 (b) (3); Gonzalez v. Guilbot, 315 S.W.3d 533 (Tex. 2010). That
is, once a tertiary motion to recuse is filed, the judges assigned to the case
are required to proceed and cannot delay the case because of the filing of a
motion to recuse. Further, sanctions are mandatory if a tertiary recusal
motion is denied. Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code§ 30.016 (c), which provides as
follows: A judge hearing a tertiary recusal motion against another judge who
denies the motion shall award reasonable and necessary attorney's fees and
costs to the party opposing the motion. The party making the motion and the
attorney for the party are jointly and severally liable for the award of fees
and costs. The fees and costs must be paid before the 31st day after the date
the order denying the tertiary recusal motion is rendered, unless the order
is properly superseded. I have reviewed the motion as to Associate Judge
Kaitcer and the motion fails to meet the requirements of Texas Rules of Civil
Procedure 18a(a) because it does not state with detail and particularity
admissible facts that would justify recusal or disqualification if proven. Tex.
R. Civ. P. 18a(a)(4). IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED THAT: 1. The motion to
recuse is denied as to Associate Judge Kaitcer without hearing Tex. R. Civ. P
18a(g)(3)(A), (i). 2. All judges in this case will comply with Tex. Civ. Prac. &
Rem. Code § 30.016 (b) (3) requiring judges to move the case to final
disposition as though a tertiary recusal motion had not been filed. 3. The
issue of the mandatory sanctions required by Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code§
30.016 (c) will be handled as follows: a. The parties entitled to sanctions will
file on or before October 3, 2025, a motion for sanctions with exhibits
showing reasonable and necessary attorney's fees and cost attached to the
motion. b. Mr. Myers will file his response to the sanctions by October 10,
2025. c. The motion for sanctions will be taken up on written submission on
October 17, 2025. 4. This order only addresses the motion to recuse
Associate Judge Kaitcer and the issues raised by the tertiary recusal motion.
Signed this the ~ day of September 2025. DAVID L. EV ANS, PRESIDING
JUDGE EIGHTH ADMINISTRATIVE JUDICIAL REGION OF TEXAS Explain
why david L Evan's order is legally erroneous. he references motions to
recuse that were never filed. kaitcer is clearly not implicated in the recusal
motion, and he's attempting to move for sanctions on a motion never filed.

Statement of the Case Nature of Underlying Proceeding: This original
proceeding arises from a divorce action, No. 322-744263-23, pending in the
322nd District Court of Tarrant County, Texas. The Relator initiated recusal

=== PAGE 10 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
proceedings under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a, which remain
pending. The issues presented concern the improper handling of those
recusal procedures. Respondent Judge: The Respondent Judge, Honorable
David L. Evans, is the presiding Regional Judge of the 8 th Administrative
Judicial Region of Texas. Respondent’s Challenged Actions: The Respondent
erred when he overruled the Relator's objection requesting that the
mandatory procedures set forth in Rule 18a of the Texas Rules of Civil
Procedure be followed. Further, permitting a judge to file an order of
referral regarding a recusal motion where he was not named introduces
confusion and undermines the purpose of the rule, causes further delays,
and leaves the Relator without an adequate appellate remedy. 7 Statement
of Jurisdiction This Petition for Writ of Mandamus is properly filed in the
Supreme Court of Texas, which possesses original jurisdiction to issue writs
of mandamus against regional presiding judges pursuant to Article V,
Section 3 of the Texas Constitution and Texas Government Code § 22.002(a).
In contrast, the jurisdiction of intermediate appellate courts is governed by
Texas Government Code § 22.221, and the Legislature has not conferred
upon those courts the authority to issue writs of mandamus against regional
presiding judges. This original proceeding is properly presented to this
Honorable Court in the first instance due to the jurisdictional limitations of
the Second Court of Appeals and because three previously filed mandamus
proceedings—arising from the same case and naming the same parties—are
currently pending before this Court under cause numbers 25-0361, 25-0367,
and 25-0378. 8 Issues Presented Issue No. 1: Whether the Respondent
abused his discretion by delegating to a court coordinator duties that Texas
Rule of Civil Procedure 18a(e)(1) expressly assigns to the clerk during
recusal proceedings, leaving the Relator without an adequate appellate
remedy. Issue No. 2: Whether the Respondent further abused his discretion
by permitting a judge not subject to recusal to file an order of referral. 9
Statement of Facts “MR” in this section refers to the mandamus record filed
concurrently with this petition. “APP” refers to the mandamus appendix
attached hereto. On April 23, 2025, in the midst of three concurrent
mandamus proceedings in the Second Court of Appeals1 , the trial court
below, on its’ own initiative, and after several months of silence, sua sponte
moved to set the matter for final trial (MR 1-1.1). The same day, CHARLES
DUSTIN MYERS, (“the Relator”) filed notice with the Second Court of
Appeals warning that more errors would likely be committed by the trial
court given this sudden decision to move to final trial (MR 2-2.1). The
Relator then objected in the trial court to this setting and reminded the
court that there were three concurrent mandamus proceedings pending in
the Second Court of Appeals (MR 3.1) and named six specific issues that
needed to be resolved before moving to final trial (MR 3.2). The following
day, the Second Court of Appeals issued a per curiam denial regarding
02-25-00166-CV, which is now before this court as cause number 25- 0361
(MR 4-4.1). The Relator then filed a Plea to the Jurisdiction directed to
Honorable James Munford and reiterated several key issues and questioned
the court’s jurisdiction and re-raised constitutional issues (MR 5-5.11). On
April 25, 2025, the Relator filed a Motion to Recuse in the 322nd District
Court seeking to 1 See cause numbers 02-25-00164-CV, 02-25-00166-CV,
02-25-00171-CV 10 recuse the Honorable James Munford (MR 6-6.21) to
protect his rights. The recusal included several exhibits, including the
Notice of Court Proceeding (MR 6.22- 6.24), the current temporary orders in

=== PAGE 11 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
effect that claim consent yet lack the Relator’s signature (MR. 6.25-6.36),
the prior recusal denial (MR. 6.37-6.39), the agreement to reschedule the
prior recusal proceedings (MR. 6.40-6.44), the correspondence with the
court coordinator for the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County regarding
the un-opposed summary judgement motion filed on February 22, 2024, and
the reinstatement of the Honorable Judges from the prior recusal
proceedings (MR. 6.45-6.50), the initial ruling that divested the Relator of
his home, business, and children without findings (MR 6.51-6.53), and the
Associate Judge’s Report signed by the parties on February 1, 2024 (MR.
6.54-6.60) with specific procedural requirements. Following the submission
of his Motion to Recuse, the Relator received notice from the Real Party in
Interest, Morgan Michelle Myers, that their youngest child had sustained a
dental injury. In response, Relator notified the Second Court of Appeals (MR.
7–7.4) and submitted the same notice to the 322nd District Court, amending
the filing to correct a date reference (MR. 8–8.6). Three days later, Relator
filed a First Amended Motion to Recuse to include the medical event (MR. 9–
9.36) containing a case study (MR 9.54-9.91). He also 11 filed a Notice of
Non-Appearance and submitted an objection to the trial setting (MR. 10–
10.6). On April 29, 2025, letters from the District Judge and the Associate
Judge were filed (MR. 11; MR. 12). Each declined to recuse and referred the
matter to Judge David L. Evans of the 8th Administrative Judicial Region
(MR. 13; APP 3). Relator filed an Objection to the Recusal Procedure, stating
that the motion named only the District Judge and not the Associate Judge,
and challenged the inclusion of the latter and objected to the court
coordinator’s involvement (MR 14). Two days later, the Second Court of
Appeals entered denials in cause numbers 02-25-00166-CV and
02-25-00171-CV per curiam (MR. 15; MR. 16). These matters were then
docketed before this Court as cause numbers 25-0367 and 25-0378 on May
2, 2025, and May 7, 2025. On May 6, 2025, Honorable Judge Evans issued
an Order of Assignment still listing both Honorable Jeff Kaitcer and
Honorable James Munford as respondents (APP 2) and used the 322nd
District Court's coordinator to transmit documents, a method Relator
challenged as improper and filed a second objection (MR. 17). On May 15,
2025, Honorable Judge Evans issued an order denying the Relator’s
objections (APP 1), which led to the drafting of this petition for writ of
mandamus. 12 SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT Texas law assigns the court clerk
— not the challenged judge or his personal staff — the duty of transmitting
recusal materials. Rule 18a’s forwarding requirement is statutorily
designated to the clerk of the court where the motion was filed. Allowing a
judge’s court coordinator or personal assistant (a staff member appointed by
the judge) to carry out that delivery would depart from the neutral
procedure envisioned by the rule. A coordinator is a direct appointee of the
judge and serves at his pleasure; having such a person handle a motion
challenging the judge’s own authority undermines the independence of the
process. In other words, the clerk is a neutral custodian of court records,
whereas a coordinator is part of the judge’s office. In the recusal context, it
is far safer to use the clerk (or an independent deputy) to send the papers
on, so that no one can reasonably think the judge is influencing the referral.
Beyond the letter of Rule 18a, Texas’s Code of Judicial Conduct mandates
avoiding not only actual bias but any appearance of impropriety or partiality.
Canon 2(A) provides that a judge “should act at all times in a manner that
promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary”.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
In practice this means even the perception of favoritism or undue influence
must be avoided. Here, the Respondent’s order overruling the Relator’s
objection has the opposite effect, constituting an abuse of discretion leaving
the Relator without an appellate remedy. 13 ARGUMENT A. Standard of
Review To obtain relief by writ of mandamus, a relator must establish that
an underlying order is void or a clear abuse of discretion and that no
adequate appellate remedy exists. Walker v. Packer, 827 S.W.2d 833, 839–40
(Tex.1992) (orig. proceeding). An abuse of discretion occurs when a trial
court's ruling is arbitrary and unreasonable, made without regard for
guiding legal principles or supporting evidence. Ford Motor Co. v. Garcia,
363 S.W.3d 573, 578 (Tex.2012). Similarly, a trial court abuses its discretion
when it fails to analyze or apply the law correctly. In re Sw. Bell Tel. Co., 226
S.W.3d 400, 403 (Tex.2007). The Relator submits that the Respondent clearly
abused his discretion by not following the mandatory procedural
requirements of Rule 18a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure which has
undermined the recusal process. B. Government Code § 74.102(b) Does Not
Excuse Noncompliance With Rule 18a The Court Administration Act,
Government Code Chapter 74, sets broad administrative standards but does
not repeal or override other laws. Section 74.102(a) provides that “by local
administrative rule” courts shall designate the duties of court coordinators.
More importantly, 74.101(b) specifies that each coordinator serves “at the
pleasure of the judge who appointed him.” Here, the 14 coordinator in
question serves at the pleasure of the judge subject to recusal. Texas law
implicitly assigns the court clerk — not the challenged judge or his personal
staff — the duty of transmitting recusal materials. Rule 18a’s forwarding
requirement is typically performed by the clerk of the court where the
motion was filed. Allowing a judge’s court coordinator or personal assistant
(a staff member appointed by the judge) to carry out that delivery would
depart from the neutral procedure envisioned by the rule. Because a
coordinator is a direct appointee of the judge and serves at his pleasure -
having such a person handle a motion challenging the judge’s own authority
undermines the independence of the process. In other words, the clerk is a
neutral custodian of court records, whereas a coordinator is part of the
judge’s office. In the recusal context, Rule 18a(e) specifically delineates
duties to the clerk of the court, not the coordinator. In the Respondent’s
order overruling the Relator’s objection, the invocation of 74.102(b) was
misplaced (APP 1.1). This section simply reinforces that court coordinators
must work smoothly with judges; it does not allow a coordinator or clerk to
disregard the clear instructions of Rule 18a. Nor does § 74.102(b) itself
confer discretion to the clerk that would override the rule’s requirements.
The only plausible understanding of Section 74.102(b) is that it calls for
cooperation in effectuating rules like 18a, not for deviation from them,
which is what occurred here. In Rio Grande Valley Gas Co., In re, 987 S.W.2d
167 (Tex. App. 1999), the 15 court explicitly stated that recusal motions
must be filed "with the clerk of the court." This further reinforces that the
clerk, not a court coordinator, is the proper recipient of recusal-related
filings. Likewise, in In re Amir-Sharif, NUMBER 13- 19-00573-CV (Tex. App.
Dec 12, 2019), the court stated that the respondent judge "must either: (A)
sign and file with the clerk an order of recusal or disqualification; or (B) sign
and file with the clerk an order referring the motion to the regional
presiding judge." This explicit reference to filing "with the clerk” is directly
supported by rule 18a(e). Here, deviation from these mandatory procedural

=== PAGE 13 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
requirements has proven to be inefficient and have undermined the recusal
process itself in a case already fraught with procedural abnormalities. C.
The involvement of the coordinator in this instance has proven to be
inefficient and has undermined the integrity of the recusal process By
involving the court coordinator, the straightforward process of recusal has
become ambiguous. Rule 18a(c) of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure makes
clear that the judge’s obligation to address recusal arises only after a motion
is duly filed: the rule commands that if a party “raises a ground requiring
recusal,” then the judge “shall either recuse himself or request the presiding
judge” to take the motion. Here Judge Evans’ order overruling the Relator’s
objection to Honorable Jeff Kaitcer’s involvement but permitting the issue to
be discussed during the recusal proceedings is not only prejudicial, but it
will waste further judicial resources and cause further delay to the relief
being sought. A judge must base 16 decisions on what is actually in the
record. It is apparent on the face of the record and the motion to recuse that
Honorable Jeff Kaitcer was not named in the motion. This implies that the
motion was not properly reviewed, or the trial court is trying to create an
illusion of an adequate appellate remedy to thwart cause number 25- 0361
pending before this court. The only mention of any recusal regarding
Honorable Jeff Kaitcer in the current proceedings was a reference made to
the prior recusal proceedings initiated on October 7, 2024 (See MR.
9.19-9.20). Notably, the court coordinator was involved in those proceedings
as well, which ended up resulting in a four month delay that was only cured
by the Respondent’s diligence in reminding the coordinator that the judges
were not reinstated into the case while opposing parties remained inactive
throughout that critical delay. (MR 8.1) (emphasis added). In essence, the
Respondent’s invocation of 74.102(b) in the order overruling the Relator’s
objection, even if correct, would not effectuate its purpose of ensuring
“uniform and efficient administration of justice in this state” by involving the
court coordinator. Here, inconsistent proceedings have resulted from this
involvement, significant delays have occurred, and now the Relator faces
recusal proceedings wherein a Judge not named in the motion has
inappropriately implicated himself in the proceedings. This error could have
been easily resolved by vacating the order, but it instead has created
unnecessary ambiguity. 17 D. No triggering motion makes Honorable Jeff
Kaitcer’s Order of Referral Erroneous Under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure
18a, no recusal procedure is triggered until a valid motion is filed. Once a
recusal motion is filed, the challenged judge must either recuse or
immediately forward the motion to the presiding judge. See In re Norman,
191 S.W.3d 858 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2006, orig. proceeding);
See also In re Stearman, 252 S.W.3d 113 (Tex. App.—Waco 2008, orig.
proceeding). Absent any motion, however, the judge has no authority to
initiate or refer a recusal proceeding. Here, the Relator's motion to recuse
did not seek recusal of Judge Kaitcer, yet the court overruled his objection to
his referral order. In doing so, the court ignored the Rule’s plain text: a
judge may “make no further orders and shall take no further action in the
case after filing of the motion and prior to a hearing on the motion”. Id. The
court’s suggestion that the assigned judge may nonetheless consider the
Relator's admitted non-filing only underscores the error – it treats an unfiled
motion as if it were pending. In re Norman is instructive: under Rule 18a a
judge has “no option” other than to recuse or refer when a motion is
pending. By contrast, here no motion to recuse has been filed regarding the

=== PAGE 14 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Associate Judge, so the Honorable Kaitcer’s referral was in error, and the
Respondent had no lawful basis to adjudicate it. For these reasons, the order
was plainly erroneous, and these actions have undermined the recusal
process which is intended to promote public confidence in the judiciary. 18
CONCLUSION In sum, the order overruling Relator’s objection reflects more
than a mere procedural disagreement—it constitutes a refusal to follow the
mandatory directives of Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a. Specifically,
18a(e) vests specific procedural duties in the clerk, not the court
coordinator. (emphasis added) The legislature’s choice of language was
deliberate: Rule 18a(e) assigns responsibility for receiving, managing, and
transmitting recusal motions exclusively to the clerk of the court. Nowhere
does it authorize a judge’s personal appointee—such as a court coordinator
—to assume or interfere with these statutory duties. Here, a motion was
ever filed to recuse Associate Judge Jeff Kaitcer. Yet despite the absence of a
triggering event, Judge Kaitcer issued a referral order under Rule 18a as
though a motion were pending. That referral had no lawful basis, and any
action taken in response—including the overruling of Relator’s objection—is
procedurally void. Rule 18a requires a motion before it imposes any duty or
limitation. Without such a filing, Judge Kaitcer lacked authority to refer the
case, and the assigned judge lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate a nonexistent
motion. By further permitting a judge-appointed coordinator to process
these materials, the trial court not only misapplied the Rule—it overlooked
its core purpose. A coordinator, who serves at the pleasure of the very judge
subject to recusal would arguably create the appearance of impartiality
when performing 19 duties designated to the clerk by statute. For all these
reasons, the trial court abused its discretion in overruling Relator’s
objection. Its order departs from both the plain language and the statutory
design of Rule 18a, introducing confusion, delay, and inconsistency into a
process meant to be clear and impartial. The order should be set aside, and
mandamus granted to preserve the integrity of Texas’s statutory recusal
framework. PRAYER FOR RELIEF WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED,
Relator respectfully prays that this Honorable Court: 1. Issue a writ of
mandamus directing the Respondent to vacate the Order dated May 15,
2025 and Order of Assignment dated May 6, 2025 to preserve the integrity
of the recusal proceedings; 2. Take judicial notice that this is the fourth
concurrent mandamus petition before this Honorable Court seeking
extraordinary relief and take the instant petition into consideration
regarding the adjudication of the other three mandamus petitions; 20 3.
Grant such other and further relief, whether at law or in equity, to which
Relator may be justly entitled, including all relief necessary to ensure
compliance with Rule 18a and the fair administration of justice. Respectfully

Coordinator's duties include assisting the administrative judges. See Tex.
Gov't Code Ann. § 74.102(b) which provides as follows: To promote uniform
and efficient administration of justice in this state, the court coordinators
shall cooperate with regional presiding and local administrative judges and
state agencies having duties in the area of the operation of the courts. The
court coordinators and clerks work together to assist the trial judges and
the administrative judges. Only the judges, not the litigants, have the
authority to direct the activities of the court coordinators and clerks. Mr.
Myers' objections regarding the involvement are overruled. Mr. Myers also
objects to the referral by Judge Kaitcer of a motion to recuse (Kaitcer
recusal motion) to the undersigned. This objection is overruled. However,
the judge who hears 4 APP 1.1 the Kaitcer recusal motion may take into

must not be based solely on the judge's ruling in the case; and (4) must state
with detail and particularity facts that: (A) are within the affiant's personal
knowledge, except that facts may be stated on information and belief if the
basis for that belief is specifically stated; (B) would be admissible in
evidence; and (C) if proven, would be sufficient to justify recusal or
disqualification. (b)Time for Filing Motion. (1) Motion to Recuse. A motion to
recuse:(A) must be filed as soon as practicable after the movant knows of
the ground stated in the motion; and (B) must not be filed after the tenth day

movant neither knew nor reasonably should have known: (i) that the judge
whose recusal is sought would preside at the trial or hearing; or (ii) that the
ground stated in the motion existed. (2) Motion to Disqualify. A motion to
disqualify should be filed as soon as practicable after the movant knows of
the ground stated in the motion. (c)Response to Motion. (1) By Another
Party. Any other party in the case may, but need not, file a response to the
motion. Any response must be filed before the motion is heard. (2) By the
Respondent Judge. The judge whose recusal or disqualification is sought
should not file a response to the motion. (d)Service of Motion or Response. A
party who files a motion or response must serve a copy on every other party.
The method of service must be the same as the method of filing. If possible.
(e)Duty of the Clerk. (1) Delivery of a Motion or Response. When a motion or
response is filed, the clerk of the court must immediately deliver a copy to
the respondent judge and to the presiding judge of the administrative
judicial region in which the court is located ( "the regional presiding

ANALYZE how embarassing this is for the texas judiciary and why david
evans is likely either being mislead by the person referring the documents to
him, or he is aware and is not doing anything about it. He's basically telling
the opposing party to file a motion for sanctions and giving me a change to
respond regarding the issues raised in the tieritary recusal, but yet doesnt
elaborate as to why sanctions are necessary. The motion is valid and
unopposed. United States (Texas) Answer Short response Judge David L.
Evans’s order is legally erroneous because it references and imposes
sanctions for a tertiary recusal motion against Judge Kaitcer that was never
filed, in direct violation of the mandatory procedures set out in Texas law.
This not only undermines the integrity of the recusal process but also
exposes the Texas judiciary to embarrassment by either revealing a lack of
oversight or suggesting complicity in procedural irregularities. Summary
The order issued by Judge Evans is fundamentally flawed because it
purports to deny a motion to recuse Associate Judge Kaitcer and to trigger
mandatory sanctions under Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code section
30.016, despite the absence of any such motion having been filed. Texas law
and binding case authority require that recusal procedures, including the
imposition of sanctions, can only be initiated upon the filing of a valid
motion; acting otherwise is a clear procedural error. This situation is
particularly troubling for the Texas judiciary because it suggests either that
Judge Evans is being misled by staff (such as the court coordinator, who is
improperly involved in the recusal process contrary to Rule 18a) or that he
is aware of the procedural defects and is choosing not to correct them. The
result is a process that appears arbitrary, lacking in transparency, and
inconsistent with the rule of law, thereby eroding public confidence in the
impartiality and competence of the courts. Background and Relevant Law
Statutory and Rule Framework Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a governs
the recusal and disqualification of judges. It requires that a motion to recuse
must be filed with the clerk of the court, and only upon such filing does the
judge whose recusal is sought have a duty to either recuse themselves or
refer the motion to the regional presiding judge. The rule is explicit that the
clerk—not a court coordinator or other staff—must handle the delivery of
recusal motions and related orders (Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a). Section 30.016 of
the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code mandates that if a tertiary

=== PAGE 22 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
recusal motion (the third or subsequent motion to recuse or disqualify a
judge in a case) is denied, the judge must award attorney’s fees and costs to
the party opposing the motion. However, this statutory sanction only applies
if a valid tertiary recusal motion has actually been filed and denied (Tex. Civ.
Prac. & Rem. Code § 30.016). Case law confirms that the recusal process is
strictly procedural: a judge may only act on a recusal motion if one has been
properly filed, and any action taken in the absence of such a motion is void
(In re Amir-Sharif, NUMBER 13-19-00573-CV (Tex. App. Dec 12, 2019); In re
Gold, 04-25-00085-CV (Tex. App. May 07, 2025); In re Norman, 191 S.W.3d
858 (Tex. App. 2006)). Role of Court Coordinators The Texas Government
Code allows judges to appoint court coordinators to assist with the
administration of justice, but these coordinators serve at the pleasure of the
judge and are not neutral officers of the court (Tex. Gov't. Code § 74.101).
Rule 18a assigns the duty of handling recusal motions to the clerk, not to
coordinators, precisely to avoid the appearance or risk of partiality (Tex. R.
Civ. P. 18a(e)). Analysis 1. No Motion, No Sanctions: The Legal Error Judge
Evans’s order is predicated on the existence of a tertiary recusal motion
against Associate Judge Kaitcer. However, the record and the procedural
history make clear that no such motion was ever filed. Texas law is
unequivocal: the recusal process, and any sanctions for its abuse, can only
be triggered by the filing of a valid motion (Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a; Tex. Civ. Prac.
& Rem. Code § 30.016). The courts have repeatedly held that a judge has no
authority to act on a recusal motion unless and until one is filed. Any orders
or sanctions issued in the absence of a filed motion are void and constitute a
clear abuse of discretion (In re Amir-Sharif, NUMBER 13-19-00573-CV (Tex.
App. Dec 12, 2019); In re Gold, 04-25-00085-CV (Tex. App. May 07, 2025); In
re Norman, 191 S.W.3d 858 (Tex. App. 2006)). Section 30.016’s mandatory
sanctions provision is not self-executing; it only applies if a tertiary recusal
motion is denied. If no such motion exists, there is no statutory basis for
sanctions (Powell v. Fletcher, 01-22-00640-CV (Tex. App. Nov 26, 2024)).
Judge Evans’s order, therefore, is not just a technical error—it is a
fundamental violation of due process and the statutory scheme. 2. The
Improper Involvement of the Court Coordinator The persistent involvement
of the court coordinator in the recusal process is itself a violation of Rule
18a, which assigns all duties related to the handling and delivery of recusal
motions to the clerk of the court (Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a(e)). The coordinator, as
an appointee of the judge, is not a neutral party and should not be involved
in the transmission or modification of recusal motions. This creates at least
the appearance of impropriety and undermines the integrity of the process
(Canon 2, Texas Code of Judicial Conduct). The record shows that the
coordinator not only handled the delivery of motions but also modified filings
and was the point of contact for procedural objections. This is contrary to
the explicit requirements of Rule 18a and has resulted in confusion, delay,
and a lack of transparency. The continued use of the coordinator in this role,
despite repeated objections and clear legal authority to the contrary,
suggests either a lack of understanding of the rules or a willful disregard for
them. 3. Judicial Awareness or Complicity Given the repeated objections, the
clear statutory and case law, and the ongoing procedural irregularities, it is
difficult to avoid the conclusion that Judge Evans is either being misled by
staff or is aware of the defects and is choosing not to act. Either scenario is
deeply problematic for the Texas judiciary. If Judge Evans is unaware, it
reflects a troubling lack of oversight and control over the recusal process. If

=== PAGE 23 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
he is aware and is permitting the process to continue in this fashion, it
raises serious questions about impartiality, fairness, and adherence to the
rule of law. In either case, the result is a process that is arbitrary, lacks
transparency, and is inconsistent with the requirements of due process and
judicial integrity (Tex. Gov't. Code § 33.001; Tex. Pen. Code § 39.02; Tex.
Pen. Code § 39.03). 4. Embarrassment to the Judiciary The errors in Judge
Evans’s order are not minor or technical; they go to the heart of the judicial
process. By referencing and acting upon motions that do not exist, and by
imposing sanctions without legal basis, the order exposes the Texas judiciary
to public embarrassment and undermines confidence in the courts. The
appearance is one of either incompetence or complicity, neither of which is
acceptable in a system that depends on public trust. The judiciary’s
legitimacy depends on strict adherence to procedural rules, especially in
matters as sensitive as judicial recusal. The failure to follow these rules,
particularly after repeated objections and clear legal authority, is a serious
breach of judicial duty and an affront to the principles of fairness and
impartiality (Canon 2, Texas Code of Judicial Conduct). 5. The Sanctions
Process and Lack of Justification Judge Evans’s order invites the opposing
party to file a motion for sanctions and sets a schedule for responses, but
fails to articulate any factual or legal basis for sanctions. The statute
requires that sanctions be imposed only if a valid tertiary recusal motion is
denied (Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 30.016). In the absence of such a
motion, there is no basis for sanctions, and the order is legally void.
Moreover, the order does not explain why sanctions are necessary or
justified, nor does it address the fact that the motion in question was
unopposed. This lack of explanation further undermines the legitimacy of
the order and suggests a lack of due process. Exceptions and Caveats There
are no relevant exceptions in the statutory or case law that would permit a
judge to impose sanctions or take action on a recusal motion that was never
filed. The procedural requirements are mandatory and jurisdictional. Any
deviation from these requirements is a clear error and renders subsequent
orders void (In re Amir-Sharif, NUMBER 13-19-00573-CV (Tex. App. Dec 12,
2019); In re Gold, 04-25-00085-CV (Tex. App. May 07, 2025)). Conclusion
Judge David L. Evans’s order is legally erroneous because it references and
acts upon a tertiary recusal motion against Judge Kaitcer that was never
filed, in violation of the mandatory procedures set out in Texas law. The
improper involvement of the court coordinator, the lack of a valid motion,
and the imposition of sanctions without legal basis collectively undermine
the integrity of the recusal process and expose the Texas judiciary to public
embarrassment. Whether due to being misled by staff or a willful disregard
for the rules, the result is a process that is arbitrary, lacks transparency, and
is inconsistent with the requirements of due process and judicial integrity.
The order should be vacated, and the recusal process should be conducted
strictly in accordance with the law to restore confidence in the judiciary.
ALSO, he didn't provide any justification for sanctions. United States (Texas)
Answer Short response Judge David L. Evans’s order is legally erroneous
because it imposes sanctions for a tertiary recusal motion against Judge
Kaitcer that was never filed, in direct violation of Texas procedural law, and
relies on the improper involvement of a court coordinator rather than the
clerk, undermining the integrity of the recusal process. This not only
exposes the Texas judiciary to embarrassment but also raises serious
concerns about judicial oversight, due process, and the appearance of

impartiality. Summary Judge Evans’s order is fundamentally flawed because
it references and acts upon a tertiary recusal motion that does not exist, and
attempts to impose mandatory sanctions under Texas Civil Practice and
Remedies Code section 30.016 without the statutory prerequisite of a filed
and denied motion. Texas law and binding case authority make clear that
recusal procedures, including the imposition of sanctions, can only be
triggered by the filing of a valid motion; any action taken in the absence of
such a motion is void and constitutes a clear abuse of discretion. The
situation is particularly troubling for the Texas judiciary because it suggests
either that Judge Evans is being misled by staff—specifically, a court
coordinator who is improperly involved in the recusal process contrary to
Rule 18a—or that he is aware of the procedural defects and is choosing not
to correct them. The result is a process that appears arbitrary, lacking in
transparency, and inconsistent with the rule of law, thereby eroding public
confidence in the impartiality and competence of the courts. Background
and Relevant Law Statutory and Rule Framework Texas Rule of Civil
Procedure 18a governs the recusal and disqualification of judges. It requires
that a motion to recuse must be filed with the clerk of the court, and only
upon such filing does the judge whose recusal is sought have a duty to either
recuse themselves or refer the motion to the regional presiding judge. The
rule is explicit that the clerk—not a court coordinator or other staff—must
handle the delivery of recusal motions and related orders. The rule also
provides that if the respondent judge fails to comply with a duty imposed by
the rule, the movant may notify the regional presiding judge, and that all
subsequent actions by a judge who fails to comply are void (Tex. R. Civ. P.
18a; In re Gold, 04-25-00085-CV (Tex. App. May 07, 2025)). Section 30.016
of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code mandates that if a tertiary
recusal motion (the third or subsequent motion to recuse or disqualify a
judge in a case) is denied, the judge must award attorney’s fees and costs to
the party opposing the motion. However, this statutory sanction only applies
if a valid tertiary recusal motion has actually been filed and denied (Tex. Civ.
Prac. & Rem. Code § 30.016; Powell v. Fletcher, 01-22-00640-CV (Tex. App.
Nov 26, 2024)). Texas Government Code sections 74.101 and 74.102 allow
judges to appoint court coordinators to assist with the administration of
justice, but these coordinators serve at the pleasure of the judge and are not
neutral officers of the court. Rule 18a assigns the duty of handling recusal
motions to the clerk, not to coordinators, precisely to avoid the appearance
or risk of partiality (Tex. Gov't. Code § 74.101; Tex. Gov't. Code § 74.102).
Case Law Texas courts have repeatedly held that the recusal process is
strictly procedural: a judge may only act on a recusal motion if one has been
properly filed, and any action taken in the absence of such a motion is void
(In re Gold, 04-25-00085-CV (Tex. App. May 07, 2025); In re Norman, 191
S.W.3d 858 (Tex. App. 2006)). Section 30.016’s mandatory sanctions
provision is not self-executing; it only applies if a tertiary recusal motion is
denied. If no such motion exists, there is no statutory basis for sanctions
(Powell v. Fletcher, 01-22-00640-CV (Tex. App. Nov 26, 2024); Wythe Ii
Corp.. v. Stone, 342 S.W.3d 96 (Tex. App. 2011)). Sanctions under Rule
18a(h) or Chapter 10 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code require
notice, a hearing, and a specific finding that the motion was groundless and
filed in bad faith or for the purpose of harassment, or clearly brought for
unnecessary delay and without sufficient cause (Powell v. Fletcher, 695 S.W.
3d 675 (Tex. App. 2024); In re The Monson Law Firm, LLC, 13-25-00095-CV

=== PAGE 25 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
(Tex. App. Apr 30, 2025); Rudisell v. Paquette, 89 S.W.3d 233 (Tex. App.
2002)). The order imposing sanctions must state with particularity the
conduct that violated the law and explain the basis for the sanctions
imposed (Kahn v. Garcia, 816 S.W.2d 131 (Tex. App. 1991)). The Texas Code
of Judicial Conduct requires judges to act at all times in a manner that
promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary,
and to avoid both actual impropriety and the appearance of impropriety
(Canon 2, Texas Code of Judicial Conduct). Analysis 1. No Motion, No
Sanctions: The Legal Error Judge Evans’s order is predicated on the
existence of a tertiary recusal motion against Associate Judge Kaitcer.
However, the record and the procedural history make clear that no such
motion was ever filed. Texas law is unequivocal: the recusal process, and any
sanctions for its abuse, can only be triggered by the filing of a valid motion
(Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a; Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 30.016). The courts have
repeatedly held that a judge has no authority to act on a recusal motion
unless and until one is filed. Any orders or sanctions issued in the absence of
a filed motion are void and constitute a clear abuse of discretion (In re Gold,
04-25-00085-CV (Tex. App. May 07, 2025); In re Norman, 191 S.W.3d 858
(Tex. App. 2006)). Section 30.016’s mandatory sanctions provision is not
self-executing; it only applies if a tertiary recusal motion is denied. If no
such motion exists, there is no statutory basis for sanctions (Powell v.
Fletcher, 01-22-00640-CV (Tex. App. Nov 26, 2024); Wythe Ii Corp.. v. Stone,
342 S.W.3d 96 (Tex. App. 2011)). Judge Evans’s order, therefore, is not just a
technical error—it is a fundamental violation of due process and the
statutory scheme. The imposition of sanctions without a valid motion is
legally void and constitutes an abuse of discretion (Nath v. Tex. Children's
Hosp., 446 S.W.3d 355 (Tex. 2014)). 2. The Improper Involvement of the
Court Coordinator The persistent involvement of the court coordinator in the
recusal process is itself a violation of Rule 18a, which assigns all duties
related to the handling and delivery of recusal motions to the clerk of the
court (Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a(e)). The coordinator, as an appointee of the judge,
is not a neutral party and should not be involved in the transmission or
modification of recusal motions. This creates at least the appearance of
impropriety and undermines the integrity of the process (Canon 2, Texas
Code of Judicial Conduct). The record shows that the coordinator not only
handled the delivery of motions but also modified filings and was the point of
contact for procedural objections. This is contrary to the explicit
requirements of Rule 18a and has resulted in confusion, delay, and a lack of
transparency. The continued use of the coordinator in this role, despite
repeated objections and clear legal authority to the contrary, suggests either
a lack of understanding of the rules or a willful disregard for them. 3.
Judicial Awareness or Complicity Given the repeated objections, the clear
statutory and case law, and the ongoing procedural irregularities, it is
difficult to avoid the conclusion that Judge Evans is either being misled by
staff or is aware of the defects and is choosing not to act. Either scenario is
deeply problematic for the Texas judiciary. If Judge Evans is unaware, it
reflects a troubling lack of oversight and control over the recusal process. If
he is aware and is permitting the process to continue in this fashion, it
raises serious questions about impartiality, fairness, and adherence to the
rule of law. In either case, the result is a process that is arbitrary, lacks
transparency, and is inconsistent with the requirements of due process and
judicial integrity (Tex. Gov't. Code § 33.001; Tex. Pen. Code § 39.02; Tex.

=== PAGE 26 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Pen. Code § 39.03). 4. Embarrassment to the Judiciary The errors in Judge
Evans’s order are not minor or technical; they go to the heart of the judicial
process. By referencing and acting upon motions that do not exist, and by
imposing sanctions without legal basis, the order exposes the Texas judiciary
to public embarrassment and undermines confidence in the courts. The
appearance is one of either incompetence or complicity, neither of which is
acceptable in a system that depends on public trust. The judiciary’s
legitimacy depends on strict adherence to procedural rules, especially in
matters as sensitive as judicial recusal. The failure to follow these rules,
particularly after repeated objections and clear legal authority, is a serious
breach of judicial duty and an affront to the principles of fairness and
impartiality (Canon 2, Texas Code of Judicial Conduct). 5. The Sanctions
Process and Lack of Justification Judge Evans’s order invites the opposing
party to file a motion for sanctions and sets a schedule for responses, but
fails to articulate any factual or legal basis for sanctions. The statute
requires that sanctions be imposed only if a valid tertiary recusal motion is
denied (Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 30.016). In the absence of such a
motion, there is no basis for sanctions, and the order is legally void.
Moreover, the order does not explain why sanctions are necessary or
justified, nor does it address the fact that the motion in question was
unopposed. This lack of explanation further undermines the legitimacy of
the order and suggests a lack of due process (Rudisell v. Paquette, 89 S.W.3d
233 (Tex. App. 2002); Kahn v. Garcia, 816 S.W.2d 131 (Tex. App. 1991)).
Exceptions and Caveats There are no relevant exceptions in the statutory or
case law that would permit a judge to impose sanctions or take action on a
recusal motion that was never filed. The procedural requirements are
mandatory and jurisdictional. Any deviation from these requirements is a
clear error and renders subsequent orders void (In re Gold, 04-25-00085-CV
(Tex. App. May 07, 2025); In re Norman, 191 S.W.3d 858 (Tex. App. 2006)).
Conclusion Judge David L. Evans’s order is legally erroneous because it
references and acts upon a tertiary recusal motion against Judge Kaitcer
that was never filed, in violation of the mandatory procedures set out in
Texas law. The improper involvement of the court coordinator, the lack of a
valid motion, and the imposition of sanctions without legal basis collectively
undermine the integrity of the recusal process and expose the Texas
judiciary to public embarrassment. Whether due to being misled by staff or a
willful disregard for the rules, the result is a process that is arbitrary, lacks
transparency, and is inconsistent with the requirements of due process and
judicial integrity. The order should be vacated, and the recusal process
should be conducted strictly in accordance with the law to restore
confidence in the judiciary. IN THE MATTER OF THE MARRIAGE OF

more motions to recuse and/or disqualify judges in this case. When a party

Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 30.016 (b) (3); Gonzalez v. Guilbot, 315 S.W.3d 533
(Tex. 2010). That is, once a tertiary motion to recuse is filed, the judges
assigned to the case are required to proceed and cannot delay the case
because of the filing of a motion to recuse. Further, sanctions are mandatory
if a tertiary recusal motion is denied. Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code§ 30.016
(c), which provides as follows: A judge hearing a tertiary recusal motion
against another judge who denies the motion shall award reasonable and
necessary attorney's fees and costs to the party opposing the motion. The
party making the motion and the attorney for the party are jointly and
severally liable for the award of fees and costs. The fees and costs must be
paid before the 31st day after the date the order denying the tertiary recusal
motion is rendered, unless the order is properly superseded. I have reviewed
the motion as to Associate Judge Kaitcer and the motion fails to meet the
requirements of Texas Rules of Civil Procedure 18a(a) because it does not
state with detail and particularity admissible facts that would justify recusal
or disqualification if proven. Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a(a)(4). IT IS THEREFORE

and cost attached to the motion. b. Mr. Myers will file his response to the
sanctions by October 10, 2025. c. The motion for sanctions will be taken up

Myers, Respondent. § § § § § § § § § § THE REGIONAL PRESIDING JUDGE
And In the interest ofM.E.M. and C.R.M., two children. TO THE
HONORABLE CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT OF TEXAS:
COMES NOW, Respondent, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, who respectfully
submits this First Amended Motion to Recuse the Regional Presiding Judge,
David L. Evans, and in support thereof, shows the Court the following: Since
December of 2023, Respondent has pied time and time again regarding a
fraudulent scheme to divest him of his business and property that began
with Morgan Michelle Myers and Daniel Kenneth Branthoover, involving
interstate travel and communications. Each time the Respondent has utilized
a legal pathway, he has been met with unjustifiable conduct that has, by its'
very nature, willfully expanded the scope of the initial MyersBranthoover
enterprise into what it is today - a collection of officials, attorneys, and court
staff members that who - when presented with unrefuted facts, and were
made aware of the fraudulent scheme - chose to become entangled with the
enterprise's affairs. It is ofupmost importance to our judicial system that the
following issues be adjudicated, and a fair and impartial judge preside over
this matter who will not tolerate such behavior. Exhibit 1 Page 1 of 16 I.
SCOPE The factual allegations raised herein are not conclusory and are
supported by the record directly. Furthermore, given that Respondent has
filed six mandamus petitions naming Honorables James Munford, Jeffrey
Kaitcer, Kenneth Newell, Kate Stone, David Evans, and John Cayce as
respondents, the record exists within the public domain and can be found
here: https://search.txcourts.gov/SearchMedia.aspx?Media

coa=cossup&DT=RECORD&MediaID=804ac8d3-9b5f-40b0-bc41-
bbc08c814365 I Those who have been made aware of the fraudulent scheme
but have inadvertently furthered its' affairs amount to two district judges,
two associate judges, two visiting retired judges, the regional presiding
judge, two court coordinators, one deputy clerk, and a licensed attorney,
forming an associate-in-fact enterprise for purposes of RICO, as explained
below. II. GROUNDS FOR RECUSAL The Regional Presiding Judge has
permitted and recklessly tolerated an ongoing RICO Enterprise that
continues to expand within the Texas Judiciary due to the collective and
willful neglect by the enjoined individuals to uphold their mandatory duties.
By neglecting the responsibilities of his position of power, David L. Evans
has inadvertently aided in the furtherance of the RICO enterprise's primary
objective: to secure a fraudulent final decree of divorce and escape
accountability. As the record establishes, the Respondent has exhausted
every appellate and administrative remedy in an attempt to seek redress.
Unopposed relief continues to be denied, and more predicate acts in
furtherance of the enterprise's affairs continue to occur. For the forthcoming
reasons, David L. Evans must recuse from this matter: ExhRlit 1 Page 2 of
16 II. GROUNDS FOR RECUSAL A. Disregard for Recusal Procedure 1.
Texas law mandates strict adherence to procedural safeguards in the recusal
process to ensure both actual and apparent judicial impartiality. When a
court coordinator-who is not a neutral party and serves at the pleasure of
the judge subject to recusal-handles the administrative delivery of a recusal
motion, this contravenes the explicit requirements of Rule 18a(e) and
creates an appearance of impropriety. 2. David L. Evans has allowed the
coordinator Lindsey Baker - not the clerk - to handle the duties the
legislature explicitly designates to court clerks. Rule l 8a( e )(2) plainly

=== PAGE 29 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
states that " ... when a respondent judge signs and files an order of recusal
or referral, the clerk of the court must immediately deliver a copy to the
regional presiding judge." 3. Furthermore, as Rule 18(a)(f)(3) also plainly
states," ... if the respondent judge fails to comply with a duty imposed by
this rule, the movant may notify the regional presiding judge." 4. Here, the
Regional Presiding Judge was notified of and provided with a modified
version of the recusal motion rather than the original, and was notified of
these discrepancies, but chose to ignore them. B. Recusal Tampering 5. The
record facially establishes that on October 7, 2024, the Respondent filed a
Joint Motion to Recuse Honorable Judges James Munford and Jeffrey Kaitcer
from the matter and provided supporting evidence which is self-
authenticating under the Texas Rules of Evidence. 6. The following day, on
October 8 at 4:42 P.M., correspondence was received from court coordinator
Lindsey Baker regarding the order of referral. REC. 1277 Exhibit 1 Page 3 of
16 7. Upon inspection, it was discovered that the affidavit and exhibits were
both missing from the motion which was sent to the Regional Judge, and this
was quickly pointed out to the coordinator. 8. She confirms that the exhibits
were indeed filed electronically but as the clerk's office prefers - they were
filed as one document, just as the Tarrant County District Clerk's Filing FAQ
states: Q: "What process should be used for eFiling exhibits?" A: "Same
process for exhibit as initial filings- Exhibits should be merged into one
document with the lead document." REC. 1262. C. Repeated Tampering 9.
The record facially shows that on October 10, 2024, Judge James Munford
filed an "Amended Order of Referral" and once again the correspondence to
David L Evans was handled by the coordinator. 10. This time, the
coordinator claimed that due to the "size of the motion" that it could be
justified to split the motion into three separate files, this time with the
exhibits and affidavit included, defeating the entire purpose of removing the
exhibits and affidavit two days earlier. REC. 1282 D. Objecting 11. All of
these issues were raised in both notice and an objection filed timely after
these issues were discovered. REC. 1245-1252 It included all email
exchanges with the coordinator, the modifications of the original motion,
with the objection specifically stating that "the explanation changed to the
document being too large. This inconsistency raises concerns about
transparency and procedural fairness." No action was taken by David Evans.
Exhibit 1 Page 4 of 16 .• E. Subsequent Recusals 12. After waiting four
months for the judges to be reinstated as per David Evans' order,
Respondent had to reach out to the court coordinator to remind her to
reinstate the trial judges. REC. 1306. 13. The Respondent, in the face of a
serious dental emergency for his youngest child, opened a separate SAPCR
suit, arguing for dominant jurisdiction, (REC. 2088) only to be denied access
to the courts by Judges Kate Stone and Kenneth Newell, which prevented an
emergency TRO needed for the safety and welfare of the Respondent's
children. This negligence lead to a direct injury to the youngest child in this
case and three concurrent mandamus petitions followed, none of which
received any response from the implicated Judges. See 25-0361, 25- 0367,
25-0378. 14. In the midst of these efforts, James Munford continued to
ignore the issues and after the SAPCR was improperly consolidated by Judge
Newell, Judge Munford chose to move the case towards final deposition,
which was promptly objected to and ignored the same. REC. 2480. 15. These
actions lead to the second recusal motion, facially naming James Munford as
the respondent judge. REC. 2488. 16. This time, David Evans addressed two

=== PAGE 30 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
major issues raised in an objection by the Respondent: i. The continued
involvement of Lindsey Baker, the court coordinator; ii. The erroneous order
of referral sent by Judge Kaitcer; REC. 2620 17. In his order, he argued that
"The court coordinators and clerks work together to assist the trial judges
and the administrative judges. Only the judges, not the litigants, have the
authority to direct the activities of the court coordinators and clerks. Mr.
Myers' objections regarding the involvement are overruled" REC. 3507.
Exhibit 1 Page 5 of 16 18. This argument fails - because the rules of
procedure does not designate any role to the Court Coordinator, and based
on prior conduct - her involvement has facially created ambiguity in a
process designed to promote transparency and fairness. By refusing to
comply with the Rule 18a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure in multiple
recusal proceedings - there is no question regarding his impartiality - it has
been compromised by, what the Respondent believes to be, political reasons.
19. Even when raising these issues to the highest Court in the State on
direct appeal, leading to cause numbers 25-0426 and 25-0458, which related
to compliance with Rule 18a and the entertainment and subsequent denial
of a motion which was never filed, resulting in five concurrent mandamus
petitions before the Texas Supreme Court. 20. All that was received in
response to these efforts was "Denied, per curiam". Respondent understands
that the Court of appeals has the discretion to issue such explanations,
however, given the scope of these issues, they cannot be addressed at final
disposition, and based on everything above, there no reasonable possibility
that one would think that there could be a fair and impartial trial given
these circumstances. This will only lead to further appeals and more wasted
judicial resources when these issues could just be dealt with at present. 21.
The regional judge's repeated failure to follow mandatory recusal
procedures-by denying hearings on recusal motions, involving non-neutral
staff, and failing to provide meaningful appellate remedies-constitutes a
pattern of procedural irregularities that violates both statutory requirements
and the fundamental due process right to a fair and impartial tribunal. Texas
law is clear that recusal is required whenever a judge's conduct creates
reasonable doubt as to impartiality, and the deprivation of a meaningful
appellate remedy further supports the necessity of recusal to protect the
substantive rights of the parties and restore confidence in Exhiit 1 Page 6 of
16 the judicial process. The authorities provided leave no doubt that
adherence to recusal procedures is essential to the integrity of the Texas
judicial system. III. CONCLUSION AND PRAYER Respondent has suffered
significant damages, which continue to accrue, and unexplained and
unethical behavior continues to run afoul within this administrative region.
He has provided the Court and several judicial officers with multiple
opportunities in tandem with the information needed to address these
pressing issues, but rather than address them, they continue to compound
these issues for unknown reasons. Court: Therefore, for all reasons stated
herein, Respondent respectfully pray that this Honorable 1. Grant this
motion to recuse; 2. Effectuate a stay of these proceedings immediately to
preserve the integrity of the Texas judiciary; 3. Provide interim relief to the
Respondent pursuant to Rule 18a(g)(4) that restores his property interests;
4. Require the Petitioner and her counsel, for the first time in this matter, be
required to provide a written response; 5. Provide any further relief the
Court deems just and right under these circumstances. Respectfully, Isl

CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS INTRODUCTION AND VERIFICATION I,
CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, being of sound mind and over the age of
eighteen (18) years, hereby swear and affirm under penalty of perjury
pursuant to Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code§ 132.001 that I am
personally familiar with the facts stated herein, that I have personal
knowledge of the matters stated in this affidavit, that the statements made
herein are true and correct, and that I am competent to make this affidavit.
FACTUAL BACKGROUND 1. I am the Respondent in cause number
322-744263-23, styled "Morgan Michelle Myers v. Charles Dustin Myers,"
currently pending in the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County, Texas. 2.
Since December of 2023, I have repeatedly attempted to address a
fraudulent scheme to divest me of my business and property interests
through proper legal channels. Each time I have utilized legitimate legal
pathways, I have been met with procedural irregularities and violations that
have prevented fair adjudication of my claims. 3. The Regional Presiding
Judge, Honorable David L. Evans, has been directly involved in handling
multiple recusal proceedings related to my case, and has consistently failed
to follow the mandatory procedures required by Texas law, as detailed
below. 4. I have exhausted all available appellate and administrative
remedies in my attempts to seek redress. Despite filing multiple mandamus
petitions with the Texas Supreme Court (cause numbers 25-0361, 25-0367,
25-0378, 25-0426, and 25-0458), I have received only "Denied, per curiam"
responses without substantive consideration of the serious procedural
violations occurring in my case. Exhibit 1 Page 8 of 16 PROCEDURAL
VIOLATIONS 5. On October 7, 2024, I filed a Joint Motion to Recuse
Honorable Judges James Munford and Jeffrey Kaitcer, including supporting
evidence and a properly executed affidavit as required by Texas Rule of Civil
Procedure 18a. 6. On October 8, 2024, at 4:42 P.M., I received
correspondence from court coordinator Lindsey Baker regarding the order
of referral. Upon inspection, I discovered that both my affidavit and
supporting exhibits had been removed from the motion that was sent to
Regional Judge Evans. 7. I immediately notified the court coordinator that
the exhibits and affidavit were missing from the materials sent to Judge
Evans. The coordinator confirmed that my exhibits were indeed filed
electronically as one document with the lead document, in accordance with
the Tarrant County District Clerk's Filing FAQ, which states: "Same process
for exhibit as initial filings- Exhibits should be merged into one document
with the lead document." 8. On October 10, 2024, Judge James Munford filed
an "Amended Order of Referral," and once again the correspondence to
Judge Evans was handled by the court coordinator Lindsey Baker rather
than the clerk of the court as required by Rule 18a( e )(2). 9. This time, the
coordinator claimed that the "size of the motion" justified splitting it into
three separate files, this time including the exhibits and affidavit that had
been previously omitted, thereby contradicting the earlier handling of the
motion. I 0. These actions directly violated Texas Rule of Civil Procedure
18a( e )(2), which explicitly states: "When a respondent judge signs and files
an order of recusal or referral, the clerk of the court must immediately
deliver a copy to the regional presiding judge." Exhiit 1 Page 9 of 16 11. The
law does not permit a court coordinator, who serves at the pleasure of the
judge subject to recusal, to handle this sensitive procedural matter. Instead
of the neutral clerk of court processing these materials as required by

=== PAGE 32 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
statute, the court coordinator for the very judge whose impartiality was
being questioned took possession of and modified the recusal motion.
OBJECTIONS AND LACK OF REMEDY 12. I timely filed formal objections to
these procedural irregularities, including documentation of all email
exchanges with the coordinator and the modifications made to my original
motion. 13. My objection specifically stated that "the explanation changed to
the document being too large. This inconsistency raises concerns about
transparency and procedural fairness." 14. Judge Evans took no action to
remedy these procedural violations despite being properly notified of them.
15. After waiting four months for the judges to be reinstated as per Judge
Evans' order, I had to personally reach out to the court coordinator to
remind her to reinstate the trial judges. 16. When I filed a second recusal
motion naming Judge Munford as the respondent judge, Judge Evans issued
an order addressing my objections regarding: a. The continued involvement
of Lindsey Baker, the court coordinator; and b. The erroneous order of
referral sent by Judge Kaitcer. 17. In his order, Judge Evans stated: "The
court coordinators and clerks work together to assist the trial judges and
the administrative judges. Only the judges, not the litigants, have the
authority to direct the activities of the court coordinators and clerks. Mr.
Myers' objections regarding the involvement are overruled." Exhl!Slt 1 Page
10 of 16 18. This reasoning directly contradicts the plain language of Rule
18a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, which does not designate any role
to the court coordinator in the recusal process, and instead explicitly assigns
these duties to the clerk of the court. PATTERN OF CONDUCT AND HARM
19. As a direct result of these procedural violations and Judge Evans' failure
to remedy them, I have suffered substantial harm, including but not limited
to: a. Being denied access to the courts when I sought emergency relief for
my youngest child who was facing a serious dental emergency; b. Being
denied the opportunity for a fair hearing on my recusal motions; c. Having
my properly filed motions improperly modified before being presented to the
decision-maker; d. Being subjected to biased handling of critical procedural
matters by non-neutral staff members who serve at the pleasure of the
judges whose impartiality I was challenging; and e. Suffering financial harm
through the continued deprivation of my property and business interests
while these procedural violations remain unaddressed. 20. In the face of a
serious dental emergency for my youngest child, I opened a separate SAPCR
suit, arguing for dominant jurisdiction, only to be denied access to the
courts by Judges Kate Stone and Kenneth Newell, which prevented an
emergency TRO needed for the safety and welfare of my children. This
negligence led to a direct injury to my youngest child. ExSit 1 Page 11 of 16
21. After the SAPCR was improperly consolidated by Judge Newell, Judge
Munford moved the case toward final disposition, which I promptly objected
to. My objections were ignored. 22. This pattern of procedural violations has
persisted despite my repeated, documented efforts to seek proper
administration of justice through the channels provided by Texas law. LEGAL
AUTHORITIES 23. Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a establishes mandatory
procedures for the recusal of judges, including the requirement that "the
clerk of the court must immediately deliver a copy [of the recusal motion] to
the regional presiding judge" under Rule 18a(e)(2). 24. The Texas
Constitution Article V, Section 1-a provides that judges may be removed for
incompetence, partiality, oppression, official misconduct, or failure to
execute their official duties. 25. Texas Government Code§ 33.001 defines

=== PAGE 33 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
judicial misconduct to include willful or persistent violation of rules
promulgated by the Supreme Court of Texas and willful or persistent
conduct that is clearly inconsistent with the proper performance of judicial
duties. 26. Texas Penal Code § 39.02 prohibits abuse of official capacity by
public servants, providing that a public servant commits an offense if, with
intent to harm another, they intentionally or knowingly violate a law relating
to their office. 27. Texas Penal Code § 39.03 prohibits official oppression,
stating that a public servant commits an offense if they intentionally deny or
impede another in the exercise of their rights, privileges, powers, or
immunities, knowing their conduct is unlawful. Exhl!Jlt 1 Page 12 of 16 28.
Under established Texas case law, recusal is required not only for actual bias
but also where procedural irregularities create an appearance of
impropriety or reasonable doubt as to a judge's impartiality. See Sears v.
Nueces County Sheriff Olivarez, 28 S. W.3d 611 (Tex. App. 2000) . 29. The
Texas Supreme Court has emphasized that judges must strictly adhere to
recusal procedures to preserve public confidence in the judiciary. See In re
Inquiry Concerning Honorable Bonnie Rangel, 677 S.W.3d 918 (Tex. 2023).
CONCLUSION AND PRAYER FOR RELIEF 30. Based on all the foregoing
facts, I respectfully assert that Judge David L. Evans has demonstrated a
pattern of disregard for the mandatory recusal procedures established by
Texas law, creating both an appearance of impropriety and reasonable doubt
as to his impartiality in handling matters related to my case. 31. His failure
to adhere to the clear requirements of Rule 18a, combined with his explicit
approval of non-neutral staff handling sensitive recusal materials in
contravention of the rule's plain language, constitutes grounds for recusal
under Texas law. 32. I respectfully request that this Honorable Court: a.
Grant this first amended motion to recuse Judge David L. Evans; b.
Effectuate an immediate stay of these proceedings to preserve the integrity
of the Texas judiciary; c. Provide interim relief pursuant to Rule 18a(g)(4)
that restores my property interests; d. Require the Petitioner and her
counsel to provide a written response to the allegations contained herein;
and Exhll:Jit 1 Page 13 of 16 e. Provide any further relief the Court deems
just and right under these circumstances. FURTHER AFFIANT SAYETH

RECUSE AND ORDER DIRECTING THE CASE TO PROCEED TO TRIAL
PURSUANT TO TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE § 30.016 AND ORDER RE
MANDATORY SANCTIONS FOR THE FILING OF TERTIARY RECUSAL
MOTION Before me is a pleading entitled Motion to Recuse Associate Judge
Kaitcer filed by Charles Dustin Myers. This motion was referred to me after
Associate Judge Jeff Kaitcer declined to recuse himself by order dated
September 9, 2025. Mr. Myers has filed three or more motions to recuse
and/or disqualify judges in this case. When a party files his third motion to
recuse in a case, the judge(s) must move the case to final disposition as
though a tertiary recusal motion had not been filed. Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.
Code § 30.016 (b) (3); Gonzalez v. Guilbot, 315 S.W.3d 533 (Tex. 2010). That
is, once a tertiary motion to recuse is filed, the judges assigned to the case
are required to proceed and cannot delay the case because of the filing of a
motion to recuse. Further, sanctions are mandatory if a tertiary recusal
motion is denied. Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code§ 30.016 (c), which provides as
follows: A judge hearing a tertiary recusal motion against another judge who
denies the motion shall award reasonable and necessary attorney's fees and
costs to the party opposing the motion. The party making the motion and the
attorney for the party are jointly and severally liable for the award of fees
and costs. The fees and costs must be paid before the 31st day after the date
the order denying the tertiary recusal motion is rendered, unless the order
is properly superseded. I have reviewed the motion as to Associate Judge
Kaitcer and the motion fails to meet the requirements of Texas Rules of Civil
Procedure 18a(a) because it does not state with detail and particularity
admissible facts that would justify recusal or disqualification if proven. Tex.
R. Civ. P. 18a(a)(4). IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED THAT: 1. The motion to
recuse is denied as to Associate Judge Kaitcer without hearing Tex. R. Civ. P

disposition as though a tertiary recusal motion had not been filed. 3. The
issue of the mandatory sanctions required by Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code§
30.016 (c) will be handled as follows: a. The parties entitled to sanctions will
file on or before October 3, 2025, a motion for sanctions with exhibits
showing reasonable and necessary attorney's fees and cost attached to the
motion. b. Mr. Myers will file his response to the sanctions by October 10,
2025. c. The motion for sanctions will be taken up on written submission on
October 17, 2025. 4. This order only addresses the motion to recuse
Associate Judge Kaitcer and the issues raised by the tertiary recusal motion.

JUDGE EIGHTH ADMINISTRATIVE JUDICIAL REGION OF TEXAS Explain
why david L Evan's order is legally erroneous. he references motions to
recuse that were never filed. kaitcer is clearly not implicated in the recusal

Statement of the Case Nature of Underlying Proceeding: This original
proceeding arises from a divorce action, No. 322-744263-23, pending in the
322nd District Court of Tarrant County, Texas. The Relator initiated recusal
proceedings under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a, which remain
pending. The issues presented concern the improper handling of those
recusal procedures. Respondent Judge: The Respondent Judge, Honorable
David L. Evans, is the presiding Regional Judge of the 8 th Administrative
Judicial Region of Texas. Respondent’s Challenged Actions: The Respondent
erred when he overruled the Relator's objection requesting that the
mandatory procedures set forth in Rule 18a of the Texas Rules of Civil
Procedure be followed. Further, permitting a judge to file an order of
referral regarding a recusal motion where he was not named introduces
confusion and undermines the purpose of the rule, causes further delays,
and leaves the Relator without an adequate appellate remedy. 7 Statement
of Jurisdiction This Petition for Writ of Mandamus is properly filed in the
Supreme Court of Texas, which possesses original jurisdiction to issue writs
of mandamus against regional presiding judges pursuant to Article V,
Section 3 of the Texas Constitution and Texas Government Code § 22.002(a).
In contrast, the jurisdiction of intermediate appellate courts is governed by
Texas Government Code § 22.221, and the Legislature has not conferred
upon those courts the authority to issue writs of mandamus against regional
presiding judges. This original proceeding is properly presented to this
Honorable Court in the first instance due to the jurisdictional limitations of
the Second Court of Appeals and because three previously filed mandamus
proceedings—arising from the same case and naming the same parties—are
currently pending before this Court under cause numbers 25-0361, 25-0367,

=== PAGE 37 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
and 25-0378. 8 Issues Presented Issue No. 1: Whether the Respondent
abused his discretion by delegating to a court coordinator duties that Texas
Rule of Civil Procedure 18a(e)(1) expressly assigns to the clerk during
recusal proceedings, leaving the Relator without an adequate appellate
remedy. Issue No. 2: Whether the Respondent further abused his discretion
by permitting a judge not subject to recusal to file an order of referral. 9
Statement of Facts “MR” in this section refers to the mandamus record filed
concurrently with this petition. “APP” refers to the mandamus appendix
attached hereto. On April 23, 2025, in the midst of three concurrent
mandamus proceedings in the Second Court of Appeals1 , the trial court
below, on its’ own initiative, and after several months of silence, sua sponte
moved to set the matter for final trial (MR 1-1.1). The same day, CHARLES
DUSTIN MYERS, (“the Relator”) filed notice with the Second Court of
Appeals warning that more errors would likely be committed by the trial
court given this sudden decision to move to final trial (MR 2-2.1). The
Relator then objected in the trial court to this setting and reminded the
court that there were three concurrent mandamus proceedings pending in
the Second Court of Appeals (MR 3.1) and named six specific issues that
needed to be resolved before moving to final trial (MR 3.2). The following
day, the Second Court of Appeals issued a per curiam denial regarding
02-25-00166-CV, which is now before this court as cause number 25- 0361
(MR 4-4.1). The Relator then filed a Plea to the Jurisdiction directed to
Honorable James Munford and reiterated several key issues and questioned
the court’s jurisdiction and re-raised constitutional issues (MR 5-5.11). On
April 25, 2025, the Relator filed a Motion to Recuse in the 322nd District
Court seeking to 1 See cause numbers 02-25-00164-CV, 02-25-00166-CV,
02-25-00171-CV 10 recuse the Honorable James Munford (MR 6-6.21) to
protect his rights. The recusal included several exhibits, including the
Notice of Court Proceeding (MR 6.22- 6.24), the current temporary orders in
effect that claim consent yet lack the Relator’s signature (MR. 6.25-6.36),
the prior recusal denial (MR. 6.37-6.39), the agreement to reschedule the
prior recusal proceedings (MR. 6.40-6.44), the correspondence with the
court coordinator for the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County regarding
the un-opposed summary judgement motion filed on February 22, 2024, and
the reinstatement of the Honorable Judges from the prior recusal
proceedings (MR. 6.45-6.50), the initial ruling that divested the Relator of
his home, business, and children without findings (MR 6.51-6.53), and the
Associate Judge’s Report signed by the parties on February 1, 2024 (MR.
6.54-6.60) with specific procedural requirements. Following the submission
of his Motion to Recuse, the Relator received notice from the Real Party in
Interest, Morgan Michelle Myers, that their youngest child had sustained a
dental injury. In response, Relator notified the Second Court of Appeals (MR.
7–7.4) and submitted the same notice to the 322nd District Court, amending
the filing to correct a date reference (MR. 8–8.6). Three days later, Relator
filed a First Amended Motion to Recuse to include the medical event (MR. 9–
9.36) containing a case study (MR 9.54-9.91). He also 11 filed a Notice of
Non-Appearance and submitted an objection to the trial setting (MR. 10–
10.6). On April 29, 2025, letters from the District Judge and the Associate
Judge were filed (MR. 11; MR. 12). Each declined to recuse and referred the
matter to Judge David L. Evans of the 8th Administrative Judicial Region
(MR. 13; APP 3). Relator filed an Objection to the Recusal Procedure, stating
that the motion named only the District Judge and not the Associate Judge,

=== PAGE 38 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
and challenged the inclusion of the latter and objected to the court
coordinator’s involvement (MR 14). Two days later, the Second Court of
Appeals entered denials in cause numbers 02-25-00166-CV and
02-25-00171-CV per curiam (MR. 15; MR. 16). These matters were then
docketed before this Court as cause numbers 25-0367 and 25-0378 on May
2, 2025, and May 7, 2025. On May 6, 2025, Honorable Judge Evans issued
an Order of Assignment still listing both Honorable Jeff Kaitcer and
Honorable James Munford as respondents (APP 2) and used the 322nd
District Court's coordinator to transmit documents, a method Relator
challenged as improper and filed a second objection (MR. 17). On May 15,
2025, Honorable Judge Evans issued an order denying the Relator’s
objections (APP 1), which led to the drafting of this petition for writ of
mandamus. 12 SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT Texas law assigns the court clerk
— not the challenged judge or his personal staff — the duty of transmitting
recusal materials. Rule 18a’s forwarding requirement is statutorily
designated to the clerk of the court where the motion was filed. Allowing a
judge’s court coordinator or personal assistant (a staff member appointed by
the judge) to carry out that delivery would depart from the neutral
procedure envisioned by the rule. A coordinator is a direct appointee of the
judge and serves at his pleasure; having such a person handle a motion
challenging the judge’s own authority undermines the independence of the
process. In other words, the clerk is a neutral custodian of court records,
whereas a coordinator is part of the judge’s office. In the recusal context, it
is far safer to use the clerk (or an independent deputy) to send the papers
on, so that no one can reasonably think the judge is influencing the referral.
Beyond the letter of Rule 18a, Texas’s Code of Judicial Conduct mandates
avoiding not only actual bias but any appearance of impropriety or partiality.
Canon 2(A) provides that a judge “should act at all times in a manner that
promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary”.
In practice this means even the perception of favoritism or undue influence
must be avoided. Here, the Respondent’s order overruling the Relator’s
objection has the opposite effect, constituting an abuse of discretion leaving
the Relator without an appellate remedy. 13 ARGUMENT A. Standard of
Review To obtain relief by writ of mandamus, a relator must establish that
an underlying order is void or a clear abuse of discretion and that no
adequate appellate remedy exists. Walker v. Packer, 827 S.W.2d 833, 839–40
(Tex.1992) (orig. proceeding). An abuse of discretion occurs when a trial
court's ruling is arbitrary and unreasonable, made without regard for
guiding legal principles or supporting evidence. Ford Motor Co. v. Garcia,
363 S.W.3d 573, 578 (Tex.2012). Similarly, a trial court abuses its discretion
when it fails to analyze or apply the law correctly. In re Sw. Bell Tel. Co., 226
S.W.3d 400, 403 (Tex.2007). The Relator submits that the Respondent clearly
abused his discretion by not following the mandatory procedural
requirements of Rule 18a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure which has
undermined the recusal process. B. Government Code § 74.102(b) Does Not
Excuse Noncompliance With Rule 18a The Court Administration Act,
Government Code Chapter 74, sets broad administrative standards but does
not repeal or override other laws. Section 74.102(a) provides that “by local
administrative rule” courts shall designate the duties of court coordinators.
More importantly, 74.101(b) specifies that each coordinator serves “at the
pleasure of the judge who appointed him.” Here, the 14 coordinator in
question serves at the pleasure of the judge subject to recusal. Texas law

=== PAGE 39 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
implicitly assigns the court clerk — not the challenged judge or his personal
staff — the duty of transmitting recusal materials. Rule 18a’s forwarding
requirement is typically performed by the clerk of the court where the
motion was filed. Allowing a judge’s court coordinator or personal assistant
(a staff member appointed by the judge) to carry out that delivery would
depart from the neutral procedure envisioned by the rule. Because a
coordinator is a direct appointee of the judge and serves at his pleasure -
having such a person handle a motion challenging the judge’s own authority
undermines the independence of the process. In other words, the clerk is a
neutral custodian of court records, whereas a coordinator is part of the
judge’s office. In the recusal context, Rule 18a(e) specifically delineates
duties to the clerk of the court, not the coordinator. In the Respondent’s
order overruling the Relator’s objection, the invocation of 74.102(b) was
misplaced (APP 1.1). This section simply reinforces that court coordinators
must work smoothly with judges; it does not allow a coordinator or clerk to
disregard the clear instructions of Rule 18a. Nor does § 74.102(b) itself
confer discretion to the clerk that would override the rule’s requirements.
The only plausible understanding of Section 74.102(b) is that it calls for
cooperation in effectuating rules like 18a, not for deviation from them,
which is what occurred here. In Rio Grande Valley Gas Co., In re, 987 S.W.2d
167 (Tex. App. 1999), the 15 court explicitly stated that recusal motions
must be filed "with the clerk of the court." This further reinforces that the
clerk, not a court coordinator, is the proper recipient of recusal-related
filings. Likewise, in In re Amir-Sharif, NUMBER 13- 19-00573-CV (Tex. App.
Dec 12, 2019), the court stated that the respondent judge "must either: (A)
sign and file with the clerk an order of recusal or disqualification; or (B) sign
and file with the clerk an order referring the motion to the regional
presiding judge." This explicit reference to filing "with the clerk” is directly
supported by rule 18a(e). Here, deviation from these mandatory procedural
requirements has proven to be inefficient and have undermined the recusal
process itself in a case already fraught with procedural abnormalities. C.
The involvement of the coordinator in this instance has proven to be
inefficient and has undermined the integrity of the recusal process By
involving the court coordinator, the straightforward process of recusal has
become ambiguous. Rule 18a(c) of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure makes
clear that the judge’s obligation to address recusal arises only after a motion
is duly filed: the rule commands that if a party “raises a ground requiring
recusal,” then the judge “shall either recuse himself or request the presiding
judge” to take the motion. Here Judge Evans’ order overruling the Relator’s
objection to Honorable Jeff Kaitcer’s involvement but permitting the issue to
be discussed during the recusal proceedings is not only prejudicial, but it
will waste further judicial resources and cause further delay to the relief
being sought. A judge must base 16 decisions on what is actually in the
record. It is apparent on the face of the record and the motion to recuse that
Honorable Jeff Kaitcer was not named in the motion. This implies that the
motion was not properly reviewed, or the trial court is trying to create an
illusion of an adequate appellate remedy to thwart cause number 25- 0361
pending before this court. The only mention of any recusal regarding
Honorable Jeff Kaitcer in the current proceedings was a reference made to
the prior recusal proceedings initiated on October 7, 2024 (See MR.
9.19-9.20). Notably, the court coordinator was involved in those proceedings
as well, which ended up resulting in a four month delay that was only cured

=== PAGE 40 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
by the Respondent’s diligence in reminding the coordinator that the judges
were not reinstated into the case while opposing parties remained inactive
throughout that critical delay. (MR 8.1) (emphasis added). In essence, the
Respondent’s invocation of 74.102(b) in the order overruling the Relator’s
objection, even if correct, would not effectuate its purpose of ensuring
“uniform and efficient administration of justice in this state” by involving the
court coordinator. Here, inconsistent proceedings have resulted from this
involvement, significant delays have occurred, and now the Relator faces
recusal proceedings wherein a Judge not named in the motion has
inappropriately implicated himself in the proceedings. This error could have
been easily resolved by vacating the order, but it instead has created
unnecessary ambiguity. 17 D. No triggering motion makes Honorable Jeff
Kaitcer’s Order of Referral Erroneous Under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure
18a, no recusal procedure is triggered until a valid motion is filed. Once a
recusal motion is filed, the challenged judge must either recuse or
immediately forward the motion to the presiding judge. See In re Norman,
191 S.W.3d 858 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2006, orig. proceeding);
See also In re Stearman, 252 S.W.3d 113 (Tex. App.—Waco 2008, orig.
proceeding). Absent any motion, however, the judge has no authority to
initiate or refer a recusal proceeding. Here, the Relator's motion to recuse
did not seek recusal of Judge Kaitcer, yet the court overruled his objection to
his referral order. In doing so, the court ignored the Rule’s plain text: a
judge may “make no further orders and shall take no further action in the
case after filing of the motion and prior to a hearing on the motion”. Id. The
court’s suggestion that the assigned judge may nonetheless consider the
Relator's admitted non-filing only underscores the error – it treats an unfiled
motion as if it were pending. In re Norman is instructive: under Rule 18a a
judge has “no option” other than to recuse or refer when a motion is
pending. By contrast, here no motion to recuse has been filed regarding the
Associate Judge, so the Honorable Kaitcer’s referral was in error, and the
Respondent had no lawful basis to adjudicate it. For these reasons, the order
was plainly erroneous, and these actions have undermined the recusal
process which is intended to promote public confidence in the judiciary. 18
CONCLUSION In sum, the order overruling Relator’s objection reflects more
than a mere procedural disagreement—it constitutes a refusal to follow the
mandatory directives of Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a. Specifically,
18a(e) vests specific procedural duties in the clerk, not the court
coordinator. (emphasis added) The legislature’s choice of language was
deliberate: Rule 18a(e) assigns responsibility for receiving, managing, and
transmitting recusal motions exclusively to the clerk of the court. Nowhere
does it authorize a judge’s personal appointee—such as a court coordinator
—to assume or interfere with these statutory duties. Here, a motion was
ever filed to recuse Associate Judge Jeff Kaitcer. Yet despite the absence of a
triggering event, Judge Kaitcer issued a referral order under Rule 18a as
though a motion were pending. That referral had no lawful basis, and any
action taken in response—including the overruling of Relator’s objection—is
procedurally void. Rule 18a requires a motion before it imposes any duty or
limitation. Without such a filing, Judge Kaitcer lacked authority to refer the
case, and the assigned judge lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate a nonexistent
motion. By further permitting a judge-appointed coordinator to process
these materials, the trial court not only misapplied the Rule—it overlooked
its core purpose. A coordinator, who serves at the pleasure of the very judge

subject to recusal would arguably create the appearance of impartiality
when performing 19 duties designated to the clerk by statute. For all these
reasons, the trial court abused its discretion in overruling Relator’s
objection. Its order departs from both the plain language and the statutory
design of Rule 18a, introducing confusion, delay, and inconsistency into a
process meant to be clear and impartial. The order should be set aside, and
mandamus granted to preserve the integrity of Texas’s statutory recusal
framework. PRAYER FOR RELIEF WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED,
Relator respectfully prays that this Honorable Court: 1. Issue a writ of
mandamus directing the Respondent to vacate the Order dated May 15,
2025 and Order of Assignment dated May 6, 2025 to preserve the integrity
of the recusal proceedings; 2. Take judicial notice that this is the fourth
concurrent mandamus petition before this Honorable Court seeking
extraordinary relief and take the instant petition into consideration
regarding the adjudication of the other three mandamus petitions; 20 3.
Grant such other and further relief, whether at law or in equity, to which
Relator may be justly entitled, including all relief necessary to ensure
compliance with Rule 18a and the fair administration of justice. Respectfully

Dated May 6, 2025, and the Objection dated April 29, 2025 that were filed
Charles Dustin Myers in the above-entitled cause. Mr. Myers complains of
the court coordinator's involvement in the recusal process. A Court
Coordinator's duties include assisting the administrative judges. See Tex.
Gov't Code Ann. § 74.102(b) which provides as follows: To promote uniform
and efficient administration of justice in this state, the court coordinators
shall cooperate with regional presiding and local administrative judges and
state agencies having duties in the area of the operation of the courts. The
court coordinators and clerks work together to assist the trial judges and
the administrative judges. Only the judges, not the litigants, have the
authority to direct the activities of the court coordinators and clerks. Mr.
Myers' objections regarding the involvement are overruled. Mr. Myers also
objects to the referral by Judge Kaitcer of a motion to recuse (Kaitcer
recusal motion) to the undersigned. This objection is overruled. However,
the judge who hears 4 APP 1.1 the Kaitcer recusal motion may take into
consideration Mr. Myers' claim that he did not file a motion to recuse Judge
Kaitcer. The Court, having considered the objections is of the opinion that
the objections should be DENIED. IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the
Objection to Order of Assignment Dated May 6, 2025 and the Objection filed

trial court other than a statutory probate court or justice court may seek to
recuse or disqualify a judge who is sitting in the case by filing a motion with
the clerk of the court in which the case is pending. The motion: (1) must be
verified; (2) must assert one or more of the grounds listed in Rule 18b; (3)
must not be based solely on the judge's ruling in the case; and (4) must state
with detail and particularity facts that: (A) are within the affiant's personal
knowledge, except that facts may be stated on information and belief if the
basis for that belief is specifically stated; (B) would be admissible in
evidence; and (C) if proven, would be sufficient to justify recusal or
disqualification. (b)Time for Filing Motion. (1) Motion to Recuse. A motion to
recuse:(A) must be filed as soon as practicable after the movant knows of
the ground stated in the motion; and (B) must not be filed after the tenth day
before the date set for trial or other hearing unless, before that day, the
movant neither knew nor reasonably should have known: (i) that the judge

=== PAGE 46 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
whose recusal is sought would preside at the trial or hearing; or (ii) that the
ground stated in the motion existed. (2) Motion to Disqualify. A motion to
disqualify should be filed as soon as practicable after the movant knows of
the ground stated in the motion. (c)Response to Motion. (1) By Another
Party. Any other party in the case may, but need not, file a response to the
motion. Any response must be filed before the motion is heard. (2) By the
Respondent Judge. The judge whose recusal or disqualification is sought
should not file a response to the motion. (d)Service of Motion or Response. A
party who files a motion or response must serve a copy on every other party.
The method of service must be the same as the method of filing. If possible.
(e)Duty of the Clerk. (1) Delivery of a Motion or Response. When a motion or
response is filed, the clerk of the court must immediately deliver a copy to
the respondent judge and to the presiding judge of the administrative
judicial region in which the court is located ( "the regional presiding
judge" ). (2) Delivery of Order of Recusal or Referral. When a respondent
judge signs and files an order of recusal or referral, the clerk of the court
must immediately deliver a copy to the regional presiding judge. (f)Duties of
the Respondent Judge; Failure to Comply. (1) Responding to the Motion.
Regardless of whether the motion complies with this rule, the respondent
judge, within three business days after the motion is filed, must either: (A)
sign and May 18, 2025 22:59 2/4APP 8.2 23 file with the clerk an order of
recusal or disqualification; or (B) sign and file with the clerk an order
referring the motion to the regional presiding judge. (2) Restrictions on
Further Action. (A) Motion Filed Before Evidence Offered at Trial. If a
motion is filed before evidence has been offered at trial, the respondent

decided, except for good cause stated in writing or on the record. (B) Motion
Filed After Evidence Offered at Trial. If a motion is filed after evidence has
been offered at trial, the respondent judge may proceed, subject to stay by
the regional presiding judge. (3) Failure to Comply. If the respondent judge
fails to comply with a duty imposed by this rule, the movant may notify the
regional presiding judge. (g)Duties of Regional Presiding Judge. (1) Motion.
The regional presiding judge must rule on a referred motion or assign a
judge to rule. If a party files a motion to recuse or disqualify the regional
presiding judge, the regional presiding judge may still assign a judge to rule
on the original, referred motion. Alternatively, the regional presiding judge
may sign and file with the clerk an order referring the second motion to the
Chief Justice for consideration. (2) Order. The ruling must be by written
order. (3) Summary Denial for Noncompliance. (A) Motion to Recuse. A
motion to recuse that does not comply with this rule may be denied without
an oral hearing. The order must state the nature of the noncompliance. Even
if the motion is amended to correct the stated noncompliance, the motion
will count for purposes of determining whether a tertiary recusal motion has
been filed under the Civil Practice and Remedies Code. (B) Motion to
Disqualify. A motion to disqualify may not be denied on the ground that it
was not filed or served in compliance with this rule. (4) Interim Orders. The
regional presiding judge or judge assigned to decide the motion may issue
interim or ancillary orders in the pending case as justice may require. (5)
Discovery. Except by order of the regional presiding judge or the judge
assigned to decide the motion, a subpoena or discovery request may not
issue to the respondent judge and may be disregarded unless accompanied
by the order. (6) Hearing. (A) Time. The motion must be heard as soon as

practicable and may be heard immediately after it is referred to the regional
presiding judge or an assigned judge. (B) Notice. Notice of the hearing must
be given to all parties in the case. (C) By Telephone. The hearing may be
conducted by telephone on the record. Documents submitted by facsimile or
email, otherwise admissible under the rules of evidence, may be considered.
(7) Reassignment of Case if Motion Granted. If the motion is granted, the
regional presiding judge must transfer the case to another court or assign
another judge to the case. (h)Sanctions. After notice and hearing, the judge
who hears the motion may order the party or attorney who filed the motion,
or both, to pay the reasonable attorney fees and expenses incurred by other
parties if the judge determines that the motion was: May 18, 2025 22:59
3/424 APP 8.3 (1) groundless and filed in bad faith or for the purpose of
harassment, or (2) clearly brought for unnecessary delay and without
sufficient cause. (i)Chief Justice. The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of
Texas may assign judges and issue any orders permitted by this rule or
pursuant to statute. (j)Appellate Review. (1) Order on Motion to Recuse. (A)
Denying Motion. An order denying a motion to recuse may be reviewed only
for abuse of discretion on appeal from the final judgment. (B) Granting
Motion. An order granting a motion to recuse is final and cannot be
reviewed by appeal, mandamus, or otherwise. (2) Order on Motion to
Disqualify. An order granting or denying a motion to disqualify may be
reviewed by mandamus and may be appealed in accordance with other law.

ANALYZE how embarassing this is for the texas judiciary and why david
evans is likely either being mislead by the person referring the documents to
him, or he is aware and is not doing anything about it. He's basically telling
the opposing party to file a motion for sanctions and giving me a change to
respond regarding the issues raised in the tieritary recusal, but yet doesnt
elaborate as to why sanctions are necessary. The motion is valid and

unopposed. United States (Texas) Answer Short response Judge David L.
Evans’s order is legally erroneous because it references and imposes
sanctions for a tertiary recusal motion against Judge Kaitcer that was never
filed, in direct violation of the mandatory procedures set out in Texas law.
This not only undermines the integrity of the recusal process but also
exposes the Texas judiciary to embarrassment by either revealing a lack of
oversight or suggesting complicity in procedural irregularities. Summary
The order issued by Judge Evans is fundamentally flawed because it
purports to deny a motion to recuse Associate Judge Kaitcer and to trigger
mandatory sanctions under Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code section
30.016, despite the absence of any such motion having been filed. Texas law
and binding case authority require that recusal procedures, including the
imposition of sanctions, can only be initiated upon the filing of a valid
motion; acting otherwise is a clear procedural error. This situation is
particularly troubling for the Texas judiciary because it suggests either that
Judge Evans is being misled by staff (such as the court coordinator, who is
improperly involved in the recusal process contrary to Rule 18a) or that he
is aware of the procedural defects and is choosing not to correct them. The
result is a process that appears arbitrary, lacking in transparency, and
inconsistent with the rule of law, thereby eroding public confidence in the
impartiality and competence of the courts. Background and Relevant Law
Statutory and Rule Framework Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a governs
the recusal and disqualification of judges. It requires that a motion to recuse
must be filed with the clerk of the court, and only upon such filing does the
judge whose recusal is sought have a duty to either recuse themselves or
refer the motion to the regional presiding judge. The rule is explicit that the
clerk—not a court coordinator or other staff—must handle the delivery of
recusal motions and related orders (Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a). Section 30.016 of
the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code mandates that if a tertiary
recusal motion (the third or subsequent motion to recuse or disqualify a
judge in a case) is denied, the judge must award attorney’s fees and costs to
the party opposing the motion. However, this statutory sanction only applies
if a valid tertiary recusal motion has actually been filed and denied (Tex. Civ.
Prac. & Rem. Code § 30.016). Case law confirms that the recusal process is
strictly procedural: a judge may only act on a recusal motion if one has been
properly filed, and any action taken in the absence of such a motion is void
(In re Amir-Sharif, NUMBER 13-19-00573-CV (Tex. App. Dec 12, 2019); In re
Gold, 04-25-00085-CV (Tex. App. May 07, 2025); In re Norman, 191 S.W.3d
858 (Tex. App. 2006)). Role of Court Coordinators The Texas Government
Code allows judges to appoint court coordinators to assist with the
administration of justice, but these coordinators serve at the pleasure of the
judge and are not neutral officers of the court (Tex. Gov't. Code § 74.101).
Rule 18a assigns the duty of handling recusal motions to the clerk, not to
coordinators, precisely to avoid the appearance or risk of partiality (Tex. R.
Civ. P. 18a(e)). Analysis 1. No Motion, No Sanctions: The Legal Error Judge
Evans’s order is predicated on the existence of a tertiary recusal motion
against Associate Judge Kaitcer. However, the record and the procedural
history make clear that no such motion was ever filed. Texas law is
unequivocal: the recusal process, and any sanctions for its abuse, can only
be triggered by the filing of a valid motion (Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a; Tex. Civ. Prac.
& Rem. Code § 30.016). The courts have repeatedly held that a judge has no
authority to act on a recusal motion unless and until one is filed. Any orders

=== PAGE 49 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
or sanctions issued in the absence of a filed motion are void and constitute a
clear abuse of discretion (In re Amir-Sharif, NUMBER 13-19-00573-CV (Tex.
App. Dec 12, 2019); In re Gold, 04-25-00085-CV (Tex. App. May 07, 2025); In
re Norman, 191 S.W.3d 858 (Tex. App. 2006)). Section 30.016’s mandatory
sanctions provision is not self-executing; it only applies if a tertiary recusal
motion is denied. If no such motion exists, there is no statutory basis for
sanctions (Powell v. Fletcher, 01-22-00640-CV (Tex. App. Nov 26, 2024)).
Judge Evans’s order, therefore, is not just a technical error—it is a
fundamental violation of due process and the statutory scheme. 2. The
Improper Involvement of the Court Coordinator The persistent involvement
of the court coordinator in the recusal process is itself a violation of Rule
18a, which assigns all duties related to the handling and delivery of recusal
motions to the clerk of the court (Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a(e)). The coordinator, as
an appointee of the judge, is not a neutral party and should not be involved
in the transmission or modification of recusal motions. This creates at least
the appearance of impropriety and undermines the integrity of the process
(Canon 2, Texas Code of Judicial Conduct). The record shows that the
coordinator not only handled the delivery of motions but also modified filings
and was the point of contact for procedural objections. This is contrary to
the explicit requirements of Rule 18a and has resulted in confusion, delay,
and a lack of transparency. The continued use of the coordinator in this role,
despite repeated objections and clear legal authority to the contrary,
suggests either a lack of understanding of the rules or a willful disregard for
them. 3. Judicial Awareness or Complicity Given the repeated objections, the
clear statutory and case law, and the ongoing procedural irregularities, it is
difficult to avoid the conclusion that Judge Evans is either being misled by
staff or is aware of the defects and is choosing not to act. Either scenario is
deeply problematic for the Texas judiciary. If Judge Evans is unaware, it
reflects a troubling lack of oversight and control over the recusal process. If
he is aware and is permitting the process to continue in this fashion, it
raises serious questions about impartiality, fairness, and adherence to the
rule of law. In either case, the result is a process that is arbitrary, lacks
transparency, and is inconsistent with the requirements of due process and
judicial integrity (Tex. Gov't. Code § 33.001; Tex. Pen. Code § 39.02; Tex.
Pen. Code § 39.03). 4. Embarrassment to the Judiciary The errors in Judge
Evans’s order are not minor or technical; they go to the heart of the judicial
process. By referencing and acting upon motions that do not exist, and by
imposing sanctions without legal basis, the order exposes the Texas judiciary
to public embarrassment and undermines confidence in the courts. The
appearance is one of either incompetence or complicity, neither of which is
acceptable in a system that depends on public trust. The judiciary’s
legitimacy depends on strict adherence to procedural rules, especially in
matters as sensitive as judicial recusal. The failure to follow these rules,
particularly after repeated objections and clear legal authority, is a serious
breach of judicial duty and an affront to the principles of fairness and
impartiality (Canon 2, Texas Code of Judicial Conduct). 5. The Sanctions
Process and Lack of Justification Judge Evans’s order invites the opposing
party to file a motion for sanctions and sets a schedule for responses, but
fails to articulate any factual or legal basis for sanctions. The statute
requires that sanctions be imposed only if a valid tertiary recusal motion is
denied (Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 30.016). In the absence of such a
motion, there is no basis for sanctions, and the order is legally void.

=== PAGE 50 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Moreover, the order does not explain why sanctions are necessary or
justified, nor does it address the fact that the motion in question was
unopposed. This lack of explanation further undermines the legitimacy of
the order and suggests a lack of due process. Exceptions and Caveats There
are no relevant exceptions in the statutory or case law that would permit a
judge to impose sanctions or take action on a recusal motion that was never
filed. The procedural requirements are mandatory and jurisdictional. Any
deviation from these requirements is a clear error and renders subsequent
orders void (In re Amir-Sharif, NUMBER 13-19-00573-CV (Tex. App. Dec 12,
2019); In re Gold, 04-25-00085-CV (Tex. App. May 07, 2025)). Conclusion
Judge David L. Evans’s order is legally erroneous because it references and
acts upon a tertiary recusal motion against Judge Kaitcer that was never
filed, in violation of the mandatory procedures set out in Texas law. The
improper involvement of the court coordinator, the lack of a valid motion,
and the imposition of sanctions without legal basis collectively undermine
the integrity of the recusal process and expose the Texas judiciary to public
embarrassment. Whether due to being misled by staff or a willful disregard
for the rules, the result is a process that is arbitrary, lacks transparency, and
is inconsistent with the requirements of due process and judicial integrity.
The order should be vacated, and the recusal process should be conducted
strictly in accordance with the law to restore confidence in the judiciary.
ALSO, he didn't provide any justification for sanctions. United States (Texas)
Answer Short response Judge David L. Evans’s order is legally erroneous

subsequent actions by a judge who fails to comply are void (Tex. R. Civ. P.
18a; In re Gold, 04-25-00085-CV (Tex. App. May 07, 2025)). WHY WOULD
THE REGIONAL JUDGE IGNORE THESE SERIOUS ISSUES, AND ON WHAT
BASIS CAN HE REQUIRE "MANDATORY SANCTIONS" IT'S RIDICULOUS
Section 30.016 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code mandates that
if a tertiary recusal motion (the third or subsequent motion to recuse or
disqualify a judge in a case) is denied, the judge must award attorney’s fees

Sanctions under Rule 18a(h) or Chapter 10 of the Texas Civil Practice and
Remedies Code require notice, a hearing, and a specific finding that the
motion was groundless and filed in bad faith or for the purpose of
harassment, or clearly brought for unnecessary delay and without sufficient
cause (Powell v. Fletcher, 695 S.W.3d 675 (Tex. App. 2024); In re The
Monson Law Firm, LLC, 13-25-00095-CV (Tex. App. Apr 30, 2025); Rudisell
v. Paquette, 89 S.W.3d 233 (Tex. App. 2002)). The order imposing sanctions
must state with particularity the conduct that violated the law and explain
the basis for the sanctions imposed (Kahn v. Garcia, 816 S.W.2d 131 (Tex.
App. 1991)). The Texas Code of Judicial Conduct requires judges to act at all
times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and
impartiality of the judiciary, and to avoid both actual impropriety and the
appearance of impropriety (Canon 2, Texas Code of Judicial Conduct).

process. By referencing and acting upon motions that do not exist, and by
imposing sanctions without legal basis, the order exposes the Texas judiciary
to public embarrassment and undermines confidence in the courts. The
appearance is one of either incompetence or complicity, neither of which is
acceptable in a system that depends on public trust. The judiciary’s
legitimacy depends on strict adherence to procedural rules, especially in
matters as sensitive as judicial recusal. The failure to follow these rules,
particularly after repeated objections and clear legal authority, is a serious
breach of judicial duty and an affront to the principles of fairness and
impartiality (Canon 2, Texas Code of Judicial Conduct). 5. The Sanctions
Process and Lack of Justification Judge Evans’s order invites the opposing
party to file a motion for sanctions and sets a schedule for responses, but
fails to articulate any factual or legal basis for sanctions. The statute
requires that sanctions be imposed only if a valid tertiary recusal motion is
denied (Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 30.016). In the absence of such a
motion, there is no basis for sanctions, and the order is legally void.
Moreover, the order does not explain why sanctions are necessary or
justified, nor does it address the fact that the motion in question was
unopposed. This lack of explanation further undermines the legitimacy of
the order and suggests a lack of due process (Rudisell v. Paquette, 89 S.W.3d
233 (Tex. App. 2002); Kahn v. Garcia, 816 S.W.2d 131 (Tex. App. 1991)).
Sanctions under Rule 18a(h) or Chapter 10 of the Texas Civil Practice and

=== PAGE 56 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Remedies Code require a specific finding that the motion was groundless
and filed in bad faith or for the purpose of harassment, or clearly brought for
unnecessary delay and without sufficient cause (Powell v. Fletcher, 695 S.W.
3d 675 (Tex. App. 2024)). No such finding was made here. Exceptions and
Caveats There are no relevant exceptions in the statutory or case law that
would permit a judge to impose sanctions or take action on a recusal motion
that was never filed. The procedural requirements are mandatory and
jurisdictional. Any deviation from these requirements is a clear error and
renders subsequent orders void (In re Gold, 04-25-00085-CV (Tex. App. May
07, 2025); In re Norman, 191 S.W.3d 858 (Tex. App. 2006)). Conclusion
Judge David L. Evans’s order is legally erroneous because it references and
acts upon a tertiary recusal motion against Judge Kaitcer that was never
filed, in violation of the mandatory procedures set out in Texas law. The
improper involvement of the court coordinator, the lack of a valid motion,
and the imposition of sanctions without legal basis collectively undermine
the integrity of the recusal process and expose the Texas judiciary to public
embarrassment. Whether due to being misled by staff or a willful disregard
for the rules, the result is a process that is arbitrary, lacks transparency, and
is inconsistent with the requirements of due process and judicial integrity.
The order should be vacated, and the recusal process should be conducted
strictly in accordance with the law to restore confidence in the judiciary. So
to directly challenge this order, what can he file? The order requests a
response by him from october 10th, 2025, but he can give one now that
obliterates the opposing side who has not prosecuted for 2 years. they don't
even know what the issues are.. is an objection the appropriate tool here or
something else? United States (Texas) Certainly. Here is a direct, practical
answer to your question about how to challenge Judge David L. Evans’s
order, with a focus on the procedural posture, the legal error, and the most
effective next step in Texas state court practice. 1. Why the Order Is Legally
Erroneous Summary of Error: No Motion, No Sanctions: Judge Evans’s order
imposes sanctions for a “tertiary recusal motion” against Associate Judge
Kaitcer that was never filed. Texas law ( Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a ; Tex. Civ. Prac. &
Rem. Code § 30.016 ) requires that sanctions for a tertiary recusal motion
can only be imposed if such a motion was actually filed and denied. If no
motion exists, there is no statutory basis for sanctions. Improper
Involvement of Court Coordinator: The recusal process must be handled by
the clerk, not a court coordinator, to ensure neutrality ( Tex. R. Civ. P.
18a(e) ). The persistent involvement of the coordinator, who serves at the
pleasure of the judge, creates at least the appearance of impropriety and
undermines the process. No Factual Basis for Sanctions: The order does not
articulate any factual or legal basis for sanctions, nor does it make the
required findings that the motion was groundless, filed in bad faith, or for
delay ( Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a(h) ; Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 10.001 ). Due
Process Violation: Imposing sanctions without a valid motion and without
notice or a hearing on the merits is a violation of due process and
constitutes an abuse of discretion ( Nath v. Tex. Children's Hosp., 446 S.W.3d
355 (Tex. 2014) ). 2. Why This Is Embarrassing for the Texas Judiciary Public
Confidence: The order exposes the judiciary to embarrassment by acting on
non-existent motions, inviting sanctions against a pro se litigant for conduct
that never occurred, and failing to follow clear statutory and procedural
rules. Appearance of Impropriety: The continued use of a court coordinator
in a role reserved for the clerk, despite repeated objections and clear law,

=== PAGE 57 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
creates the appearance of bias or incompetence. Judicial Oversight: Either
Judge Evans is being misled by staff (e.g., the coordinator is misrepresenting
the record), or he is aware of the procedural defects and is choosing not to
correct them. Both scenarios undermine the legitimacy of the process. 3.
What Should Be Filed to Challenge the Order? A. Is an “Objection” the Right
Tool? Short answer: An “Objection” is not the only or best tool. In Texas, the
most effective response is a Motion to Vacate or Motion to Reconsider the
sanctions order, combined with a detailed written response to the sanctions
request (if one is filed by the opposing party). Why? The order sets a
deadline for your response to sanctions. You can use this opportunity to file
a comprehensive written response that both objects to the imposition of
sanctions and moves to vacate the order as void for lack of a triggering
motion. You can also file a Motion to Vacate (or “Motion to Set Aside”) the
sanctions order, arguing that it is void ab initio because it is based on a non-
existent motion and violates due process. B. What Should the Filing
Contain? Your filing should: Move to Vacate the Order as void for lack of a
triggering motion and for lack of statutory authority. Object to the Sanctions
Process as a violation of due process, citing the absence of a valid motion,
the lack of findings, and the improper involvement of the coordinator.
Demand Strict Compliance with Rule 18a and the Texas Civil Practice and
Remedies Code. Request a Hearing (if you want one) or ask for the matter to
be decided on the written record. Preserve Error for Appeal/Mandamus by
making a clear record of all procedural and substantive defects. C. Sample
Caption/Title Respondent’s Motion to Vacate Order Setting Sanctions
Process and Objection to Sanctions for Nonexistent Tertiary Recusal Motion
or Respondent’s Written Response and Objection to Sanctions and Motion to
Set Aside Void Order 4. Key Points to Argue No Tertiary Recusal Motion Was
Filed as to Judge Kaitcer. The record is clear; the order is based on a non-
existent motion. Sanctions Cannot Be Imposed Without a Valid Motion. Tex.
Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 30.016 is not self-executing; it only applies if a
tertiary recusal motion is denied. No Findings of Bad Faith or Delay.
Sanctions require specific findings, which are absent here. Improper
Involvement of Court Coordinator. The process must be handled by the
clerk, not the coordinator, per Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a(e) . Due Process Violation.
Imposing sanctions without a valid motion or findings is a violation of due
process and an abuse of discretion. No Prejudice to Opposing Party. The
motion was unopposed, and the opposing party has not prosecuted the case
for two years. 5. Practical Steps File your written response and motion to
vacate as soon as possible—you do not need to wait until October 10, 2025.
Serve all parties and file a certificate of service. Request a hearing if you
want to be heard orally, or state that the matter can be decided on the
written record. Preserve all arguments for mandamus or appeal. 6.
Conclusion Bottom line: The order is void and legally erroneous. The correct
procedural tool is a Motion to Vacate or Set Aside the Order, combined with
a detailed written response objecting to sanctions and explaining the legal
and factual errors. This will both challenge the order on the record and
preserve your rights for further review. If you need a sample template or

VOID ORDER AND OBJECTION TO SANCTIONS FOR NONEXISTENT
TERTIARY RECUSAL MOTION CAUSE NO. 322-744263-23 IN THE MATTER
OF THE MARRIAGE OF MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS AND CHARLES
DUSTIN MYERS AND IN THE INTEREST OF MARA MYERS AND
CAROLINE MYERS, CHILDREN § § § § § § § IN THE DISTRICT COURT
322ND JUDICIAL DISTRICT TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS RESPONDENT'S
MOTION TO VACATE VOID ORDER AND OBJECTION TO SANCTIONS FOR
NONEXISTENT TERTIARY RECUSAL MOTION TO THE HONORABLE
JUDGE OF SAID COURT: COMES NOW, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS,
Respondent in the above-styled and numbered cause, and files this Motion to
Vacate Void Order and Objection to Sanctions for Nonexistent Tertiary
Recusal Motion, and in support thereof would respectfully show the Court as
follows: I. INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY On September 25, 2025, the
Honorable David L. Evans, Presiding Judge of the Eighth Administrative
Judicial Region, entered an "Order Summarily Denying Motion to Recuse
and Order Directing the Case to Proceed to Trial Pursuant to Tex. Civ. Prac.
& Rem. Code § 30.016 and Order Re Mandatory Sanctions for the Filing of
Tertiary Recusal Motion" (hereinafter "Void Order"). The Void Order
purports to deny a "Motion to Recuse Associate Judge Kaitcer" allegedly
"filed by Charles Dustin Myers" and referred after "Associate Judge Jeff
Kaitcer declined to recuse himself by order dated September 9, 2025." This
Void Order is a legal nullity because Respondent never filed any motion to
recuse Associate Judge Kaitcer in these proceedings. The Court cannot deny
a motion that was never filed, nor can it impose sanctions based on a
nonexistent motion. The Void Order admits on its face that it addresses a
nonexistent motion, references an order of referral that has no basis in law
or fact, and improperly invokes the tertiary recusal motion provisions of Tex.
Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 30.016 to impose mandatory sanctions where the
statutory prerequisites do not exist. This Motion seeks to vacate the Void
Order as void ab initio, terminate the improper sanctions proceedings, and
restore the proper procedural posture of this case. II. FACTUAL
BACKGROUND Respondent has indeed filed recusal motions in this case: On
October 7, 2024, Respondent filed a Joint Motion to Recuse Honorable
Judges James Munford and Jeffrey Kaitcer. On April 25, 2025, Respondent
filed a Motion to Recuse directed solely at Honorable James Munford. On
April 28, 2025, Respondent filed a First Amended Motion to Recuse, which
also was directed solely at Honorable James Munford. On September 11,
2025, Respondent filed a First Amended Motion to Recuse the Regional
Presiding Judge, directed solely at Honorable David L. Evans. Critically, at
no time in 2025 did Respondent file any motion to recuse Associate Judge
Kaitcer. The record is devoid of any such filing. Despite the absence of any
motion to recuse him, on September 9, 2025, Associate Judge Jeff Kaitcer
allegedly "declined to recuse himself" from a nonexistent motion and
referred the nonexistent motion to Judge Evans. The Void Order purports to:
(a) deny a motion that was never filed; (b) direct the case to proceed as if a
tertiary recusal motion had been filed and denied; and (c) impose mandatory
sanctions for filing a nonexistent tertiary recusal motion. The Void Order
directs the parties entitled to sanctions to file a motion for sanctions by
October 3, 2025, and for Respondent to file his response by October 10,
2025. This constitutes an attempt to impose a financial penalty on
Respondent for a filing that he never made. III. LEGAL ARGUMENTS A. The
Void Order Is a Legal Nullity Because No Motion to Recuse Associate Judge

=== PAGE 59 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Kaitcer Was Filed Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a establishes the
exclusive procedure for recusal of judges. The recusal process can only be
initiated by the filing of a motion. In re Norman, 191 S.W.3d 858, 860 (Tex.
App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2006, orig. proceeding) (holding that a judge's
duties under Rule 18a are only triggered by the filing of a recusal motion).
Rule 18a(a) explicitly states: "A party in a case in any trial court other than a
statutory probate court or justice court may seek to recuse or disqualify a
judge who is sitting in the case by filing a motion with the clerk of the court
in which the case is pending." Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a(a) (emphasis added). A
judge has no authority to "decline to recuse" himself from a motion that was
never filed, nor to refer a nonexistent motion to the Regional Presiding
Judge. In re Gold, 04-25-00085-CV (Tex. App.—San Antonio May 07, 2025)
(holding that a judge may only act on a recusal motion if one has been
properly filed). Actions taken in the absence of a properly filed recusal
motion are void. In re Stearman, 252 S.W.3d 113, 115 (Tex. App.—Waco
2008, orig. proceeding) (explaining that Rule 18a establishes mandatory
procedural requirements). Because no motion to recuse Associate Judge
Kaitcer was filed in 2025, the purported referral was void, and Judge Evans
lacked jurisdiction to rule on a nonexistent motion or to impose sanctions
related to it. B. Sanctions Cannot Be Imposed Under § 30.016 in the Absence
of a Valid Tertiary Recusal Motion Section 30.016 of the Texas Civil Practice
and Remedies Code applies only when "a tertiary recusal motion [is] filed
against a judge by the same party." Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 30.016(a).
Section 30.016(c) provides for mandatory sanctions only when a judge
"hearing a tertiary recusal motion against another judge ... denies the
motion." Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 30.016(c) (emphasis added). The
statutory sanctions provision is not self-executing; it requires the actual
filing and denial of a tertiary recusal motion. Powell v. Fletcher,
01-22-00640-CV (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] Nov 26, 2024) (holding that
§ 30.016 sanctions can only be imposed where the statutory predicates are
satisfied). Here, no tertiary recusal motion against Associate Judge Kaitcer
was filed in 2025. In the complete absence of such a motion, § 30.016 has no
application, and any sanctions imposed under it would be void as a matter of
law. C. The Void Order Violates Due Process Imposing sanctions without
notice and an opportunity to be heard on the merits constitutes a violation of
due process. Nath v. Texas Children's Hospital, 446 S.W.3d 355, 365 (Tex.
2014) (holding that due process requires notice and a hearing before
sanctions may be imposed). Due process further requires that the court
provide a reasoned explanation for the sanctions imposed. Rudisell v.
Paquette, 89 S.W.3d 233, 237 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 2002, no pet.)
(explaining that sanctions orders must state with particularity the reasons
for the sanctions). The Void Order fails to articulate any factual basis for
determining that Respondent filed a tertiary recusal motion against
Associate Judge Kaitcer. It does not identify any such filing or provide a date
when such filing allegedly occurred. Instead, the Void Order simply asserts,
contrary to the record, that Respondent has "filed three or more motions to
recuse and/or disqualify judges in this case." While Respondent has indeed
filed multiple recusal motions, none filed in 2025 were directed at Associate
Judge Kaitcer. By proceeding directly to impose "mandatory" sanctions
based on a nonexistent filing, the Void Order violates Respondent's right to
due process. D. The Improper Involvement of a Court Coordinator in the
Recusal Process Undermines Its Integrity Rule 18a(e) specifically assigns all

=== PAGE 60 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
duties related to the handling and delivery of recusal motions to "the clerk
of the court," not to judicial staff members such as court coordinators. Tex.
R. Civ. P. 18a(e). The rule states: "When a motion or response is filed, the
clerk of the court must immediately deliver a copy to the respondent judge
and to the presiding judge of the administrative judicial region in which the
court is located." Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a(e)(1). Court coordinators serve "at the
pleasure of the judge who appointed" them. Tex. Gov't Code § 74.101(b).
They are not neutral officers of the court but are directly answerable to the
judge. The persistent involvement of court coordinator Lindsey Baker in
handling recusal matters intended for the Regional Presiding Judge creates,
at minimum, the appearance of impropriety, as it undermines the structural
independence and neutrality of the recusal process. The Texas Code of
Judicial Conduct requires judges to "act at all times in a manner that
promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary."
Texas Code of Judicial Conduct, Canon 2(A). By permitting a court
coordinator to handle sensitive recusal materials rather than following the
neutral procedure established by Rule 18a, the process's integrity has been
compromised. IV. LEGAL AUTHORITIES REQUIRING VACATUR OF THE
VOID ORDER Orders that are void for lack of jurisdiction can be collaterally
attacked at any time. Browning v. Prostok, 165 S.W.3d 336, 346 (Tex. 2005)
(holding that void orders can be collaterally attacked at any time). A trial
court's actions taken without authority are void, not merely voidable. In re
Southwestern Bell Telephone Co., 35 S.W.3d 602, 605 (Tex. 2000)
(explaining that a court's actions taken without authority are void). A court's
plenary power does not extend to modifying or enforcing a void order. In re
Dickason, 987 S.W.2d 570, 571 (Tex. 1998) (holding that void orders are
legal nullities that cannot be ratified). When a judge acts in the complete
absence of a recusal motion, any resulting orders are void. In re Gold,
04-25-00085-CV (Tex. App.—San Antonio May 07, 2025) . V. REQUEST FOR
RELIEF WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, Respondent CHARLES
DUSTIN MYERS respectfully requests that this Court: a. VACATE the Void
Order dated September 25, 2025, as void ab initio; b. TERMINATE the
sanctions proceedings established by the Void Order; c. DECLARE that no
motion to recuse Associate Judge Kaitcer was filed by Respondent in 2025;
d. ORDER strict compliance with Rule 18a in all current and future recusal
proceedings; e. STAY all further proceedings in this matter until proper
resolution of the pending recusal motions that were actually filed; and f.
GRANT such other and further relief to which Respondent may be entitled.

PRESIDING I. VIOLATIONS OF LAW The Preamble to the Texas Code of
Judicial Conduct reads as follows: “Our legal system is based on the
principle that an independent, fair and competent judiciary will interpret
and apply the laws that govern us. The role of the judiciary is central to
American concepts of justice and the rule of law. Intrinsic to all sections of
this Code of Judicial Conduct are the precepts that judges, individually and
collectively, must respect and honor the judicial office as a public trust and
strive to enhance and maintain confidence in our legal system. The judge is
an arbiter of facts and law for the resolution of disputes and a highly visible
symbol of government under the rule of law. The Code of Judicial Conduct is
not intended as an exhaustive guide for the conduct of judges. They should
also be governed in their judicial and personal conduct by general ethical
standards. The Code is intended, however, to state basic standards which
should govern the conduct of all judges and to provide guidance to assist
judges in establishing and maintaining high standards of judicial and
personal conduct.” (emphasis added) Here, judges James Munford, Jeffrey
Kaitcer, Kate Stone, Kenneth Newell, and David Evans, who have all used
their positions of power in this case, have wholly failed to uphold even the
most basic principles of judicial integrity, and have instead made a mockery
of the judicial system by committing the following errors of law since this
case’s inception: II. COOPER L. CARTER 1. Attorneys in Texas who
knowingly participate in or fail to report fraudulent conduct in family law
cases face severe ethical and legal consequences, including disciplinary
sanctions such as suspension or disbarment, potential criminal liability, and
civil penalties. The Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct, state
statutes, and case law collectively impose duties to avoid, prevent, and

=== PAGE 62 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
report fraud, with violations leading to both professional and legal
repercussions, as explained below. 2. Here, Cooper L. Carter has shown a
pattern of misconduct that undermines her position as an officer of the
court. Her misconduct need not be disclosed here, as it has already been
provided to Carter via several pleadings that she has failed to provide a
response to. A. Willful Violation of Duties and Responsibilities 3. The
described conduct—failing to participate in the case, not responding to
pleadings, using attorney status to disadvantage a pro se party, and
neglecting the welfare of children—constitutes a clear breach of the duties
imposed by the Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct and, if
acting as an ad litem, the Texas Family Code. Attorneys are required to act
competently, diligently, and in the best interests of their clients and, in
family law matters, the children involved (Tex. Fam. Code § 107.0131).
Willful neglect of these duties is professional misconduct (1.06 Definitions,
Tex. R. Disc. P. 1.06). B. Submission of False Documents and Fraudulent
Settlement Agreements 4. Knowingly assisting a client in preparing false
documents and submitting a fraudulent settlement agreement to the court,
especially when representing that a party consented when they did not, is a
grave violation. Such conduct falls squarely within the prohibitions against
dishonesty, fraud, and misrepresentation (Tex. Disc. R. Prof. Cond. 8.04;
Paxton v. Comm'n for Law. Discipline, 704 S.W.3d 584 (Tex. App. 2024)). It
may also constitute a criminal offense under the Texas Penal Code, which
makes it a felony to knowingly make or use a false governmental record with
intent to defraud or harm (Tex. Pen. Code § 37.10). C. Abuse of Status and
Procedural Manipulation 5. Using attorney status to exploit a pro se party,
filing boilerplate motions without regard to the merits, and preventing a
hearing by leveraging personal relationships with court staff or other
attorneys are all forms of conduct prejudicial to the administration of
justice. Such actions violate the ethical obligation to treat all parties fairly
and to refrain from conduct that disrupts the tribunal or abuses procedural
rules (Tex. Disc. R. Prof. Cond. 8.04. D. Failure to Prove Authority and Non-
Participation 6. An attorney who fails to establish her authority to act, does
not respond to motions, and neglects to participate meaningfully in
proceedings is not providing competent representation. This is a violation of
the duty to act with diligence and competence (Tex. Fam. Code § 107.0131;
McIntyre v. Comm'n for Lawyer Discipline, 169 S.W.3d 803 (Tex. 2005)). E.
Making a Mockery of the Judiciary 7. When an attorney repeatedly engages
in such misconduct, she undermines the integrity of the judicial process. The
courts have both the authority and the responsibility to address such
behavior, using sanctions, suspension, or disbarment as appropriate
(Bennett, In re, 960 S.W.2d 35 (Tex. 1997); State Bar of Texas v. Kilpatrick,
874 S.W.2d 656 (Tex. 1994)). If the judiciary fails to act, it enables further
violations and erodes public confidence in the legal system. 8. Case law
emphasizes that courts have substantial authority and tools to address
attorney misconduct, and the adversarial system relies on both parties and
the court to identify and report violations (Webster v. Comm'n for Law.
Discipline, 704 S.W.3d 478 (Tex. 2024)). When judges ignore or fail to act on
clear and apparent violations, they abdicate their duty to protect the public
and the administration of justice, effectively enabling the misconduct to
continue. F. Not Isolated Behavior 9. Cooper L. Carter’s incompetence is not
limited to this case. Several reviews exist within the public domain which
highlight Carter’s behavior is part of a broader pattern of negligence. The

=== PAGE 63 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
abuse of her position mixed with her lack of integrity directly undermines
the most basic principles set forth in the lawyer’s creed, and the code of
judicial conduct. G. Conclusion 10. The conduct described—willful neglect of
duties, submission of false documents, abuse of status, and manipulation of
proceedings—constitutes serious professional misconduct under Texas law.
The Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct, the Texas Government
Code, and relevant case law all provide mechanisms for disciplining such
behavior, including suspension, disbarment, and even criminal prosecution
in cases involving fraud. When judges fail to act on clear violations, they
undermine the integrity of the judiciary and enable further misconduct,
making a mockery of the legal system. The law is clear: both the attorney
and the judiciary have a duty to uphold the highest standards of professional
conduct, and failure to do so warrants decisive corrective action. EXPLAIN

Answer (Texas)
Short response
Judge David L. Evans’s order is legally erroneous because it imposes
sanctions for a tertiary recusal motion against Associate Judge Kaitcer that
was never filed, in direct violation of Texas law and due process, and relies
on the improper involvement of a court coordinator rather than the clerk,
undermining the neutrality and integrity of the recusal process. The order is
groundless, exposes the Texas judiciary to embarrassment, and, given the
misconduct of opposing counsel, the respondent—not the opposing party—is
entitled to relief, not sanctions.
Summary
Judge Evans’s order is fundamentally flawed because it references and acts
upon a tertiary recusal motion that does not exist, and attempts to impose
mandatory sanctions under Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code section
30.016 without the statutory prerequisite of a filed and denied motion. Texas
law and binding case authority make clear that recusal procedures,
including the imposition of sanctions, can only be triggered by the filing of a
valid motion; any action taken in the absence of such a motion is void and
constitutes a clear abuse of discretion.

=== PAGE 64 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
This situation is particularly troubling for the Texas judiciary because it
suggests either that Judge Evans is being misled by staff—specifically, a
court coordinator who is improperly involved in the recusal process contrary
to Rule 18a—or that he is aware of the procedural defects and is choosing
not to correct them. The result is a process that appears arbitrary, lacking in
transparency, and inconsistent with the rule of law, thereby eroding public
confidence in the impartiality and competence of the courts. Moreover, the
record demonstrates that the opposing counsel, Cooper L. Carter, has
engaged in serious professional misconduct, which not only precludes any
entitlement to sanctions but also exposes her to potential civil and
disciplinary liability.
Background and Relevant Law
Statutory and Rule Framework
Recusal Procedure and Sanctions
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a governs the recusal and disqualification of
judges. The rule requires that a motion to recuse must be filed with the clerk
of the court, and only upon such filing does the judge whose recusal is
sought have a duty to either recuse themselves or refer the motion to the
regional presiding judge. The rule is explicit that the clerk—not a court
coordinator or other staff—must handle the delivery of recusal motions and
related orders. If the respondent judge fails to comply with a duty imposed
by the rule, the movant may notify the regional presiding judge, and all
subsequent actions by a judge who fails to comply are void (Tex. R. Civ. P.
18a; In re Gold, 04-25-00085-CV (Tex. App. May 07, 2025)).
Section 30.016 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code mandates that
if a tertiary recusal motion (the third or subsequent motion to recuse or
disqualify a judge in a case) is denied, the judge must award attorney’s fees
and costs to the party opposing the motion. However, this statutory sanction
only applies if a valid tertiary recusal motion has actually been filed and
denied (Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 30.016; Powell v. Fletcher,
01-22-00640-CV (Tex. App. Nov 26, 2024)).
Sanctions under Rule 18a(h) or Chapter 10 of the Texas Civil Practice and
Remedies Code require notice, a hearing, and a specific finding that the
motion was groundless and filed in bad faith or for the purpose of
harassment, or clearly brought for unnecessary delay and without sufficient
cause (Powell v. Fletcher, 695 S.W.3d 675 (Tex. App. 2024); Rudisell v.
Paquette, 89 S.W.3d 233 (Tex. App. 2002)). The order imposing sanctions
must state with particularity the conduct that violated the law and explain
the basis for the sanctions imposed (Kahn v. Garcia, 816 S.W.2d 131 (Tex.
App. 1991)).
Role of Court Coordinators
Texas Government Code sections 74.101 and 74.102 allow judges to appoint
court coordinators to assist with the administration of justice, but these
coordinators serve at the pleasure of the judge and are not neutral officers

=== PAGE 65 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
of the court. Rule 18a assigns the duty of handling recusal motions to the
clerk, not to coordinators, precisely to avoid the appearance or risk of
partiality (Tex. Gov't. Code § 74.101; Tex. Gov't. Code § 74.102).
Judicial Conduct and Due Process
The Texas Code of Judicial Conduct requires judges to act at all times in a
manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of
the judiciary, and to avoid both actual impropriety and the appearance of
impropriety (Canon 2, Texas Code of Judicial Conduct). Orders that are void
for lack of jurisdiction can be collaterally attacked at any time (Browning v.
Prostok, 165 S.W.3d 336, 346 (Tex. 2005)).
Case Law
Texas courts have repeatedly held that the recusal process is strictly
procedural: a judge may only act on a recusal motion if one has been
properly filed, and any action taken in the absence of such a motion is void
(In re Gold, 04-25-00085-CV (Tex. App. May 07, 2025); In re Norman, 191
S.W.3d 858 (Tex. App. 2006)). Section 30.016’s mandatory sanctions
provision is not self-executing; it only applies if a tertiary recusal motion is
denied. If no such motion exists, there is no statutory basis for sanctions
(Powell v. Fletcher, 01-22-00640-CV (Tex. App. Nov 26, 2024); Wythe Ii
Corp.. v. Stone, 342 S.W.3d 96 (Tex. App. 2011)).
Sanctions under Rule 18a(h) or Chapter 10 of the Texas Civil Practice and
Remedies Code require a specific finding that the motion was groundless
and filed in bad faith or for the purpose of harassment, or clearly brought for
unnecessary delay and without sufficient cause (Powell v. Fletcher, 695 S.W.
3d 675 (Tex. App. 2024)). No such finding was made here.
Analysis
1. No Motion, No Sanctions: The Legal Error
Judge Evans’s order is predicated on the existence of a tertiary recusal
motion against Associate Judge Kaitcer. However, the record and the
procedural history make clear that no such motion was ever filed. Texas law
is unequivocal: the recusal process, and any sanctions for its abuse, can only
be triggered by the filing of a valid motion (Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a; Tex. Civ. Prac.
& Rem. Code § 30.016). The courts have repeatedly held that a judge has no
authority to act on a recusal motion unless and until one is filed. Any orders
or sanctions issued in the absence of a filed motion are void and constitute a
clear abuse of discretion (In re Gold, 04-25-00085-CV (Tex. App. May 07,
2025); In re Norman, 191 S.W.3d 858 (Tex. App. 2006)).
Section 30.016’s mandatory sanctions provision is not self-executing; it only
applies if a tertiary recusal motion is denied. If no such motion exists, there
is no statutory basis for sanctions (Powell v. Fletcher, 01-22-00640-CV (Tex.
App. Nov 26, 2024); Wythe Ii Corp.. v. Stone, 342 S.W.3d 96 (Tex. App.
2011)). Judge Evans’s order, therefore, is not just a technical error—it is a

=== PAGE 66 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
fundamental violation of due process and the statutory scheme. The
imposition of sanctions without a valid motion is legally void and constitutes
an abuse of discretion (Nath v. Tex. Children's Hosp., 446 S.W.3d 355 (Tex.
2014)).
2. The Improper Involvement of the Court Coordinator
The persistent involvement of the court coordinator in the recusal process is
itself a violation of Rule 18a, which assigns all duties related to the handling
and delivery of recusal motions to the clerk of the court (Tex. R. Civ. P.
18a(e)). The coordinator, as an appointee of the judge, is not a neutral party
and should not be involved in the transmission or modification of recusal
motions. This creates at least the appearance of impropriety and
undermines the integrity of the process (Canon 2, Texas Code of Judicial
Conduct). The record shows that the coordinator not only handled the
delivery of motions but also modified filings and was the point of contact for
procedural objections. This is contrary to the explicit requirements of Rule
18a and has resulted in confusion, delay, and a lack of transparency. The
continued use of the coordinator in this role, despite repeated objections
and clear legal authority to the contrary, suggests either a lack of
understanding of the rules or a willful disregard for them.
3. Judicial Awareness or Complicity
Given the repeated objections, the clear statutory and case law, and the
ongoing procedural irregularities, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that
Judge Evans is either being misled by staff or is aware of the defects and is
choosing not to act. Either scenario is deeply problematic for the Texas
judiciary. If Judge Evans is unaware, it reflects a troubling lack of oversight
and control over the recusal process. If he is aware and is permitting the
process to continue in this fashion, it raises serious questions about
impartiality, fairness, and adherence to the rule of law. In either case, the
result is a process that is arbitrary, lacks transparency, and is inconsistent
with the requirements of due process and judicial integrity (Tex. Gov't. Code
§ 33.001).
4. Embarrassment to the Judiciary
The errors in Judge Evans’s order are not minor or technical; they go to the
heart of the judicial process. By referencing and acting upon motions that do
not exist, and by imposing sanctions without legal basis, the order exposes
the Texas judiciary to public embarrassment and undermines confidence in
the courts. The appearance is one of either incompetence or complicity,
neither of which is acceptable in a system that depends on public trust. The
judiciary’s legitimacy depends on strict adherence to procedural rules,
especially in matters as sensitive as judicial recusal. The failure to follow
these rules, particularly after repeated objections and clear legal authority,
is a serious breach of judicial duty and an affront to the principles of fairness
and impartiality (Canon 2, Texas Code of Judicial Conduct).

=== PAGE 67 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
5. The Sanctions Process and Lack of Justification
Judge Evans’s order invites the opposing party to file a motion for sanctions
and sets a schedule for responses, but fails to articulate any factual or legal
basis for sanctions. The statute requires that sanctions be imposed only if a
valid tertiary recusal motion is denied (Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code §
30.016). In the absence of such a motion, there is no basis for sanctions, and
the order is legally void. Moreover, the order does not explain why sanctions
are necessary or justified, nor does it address the fact that the motion in
question was unopposed. This lack of explanation further undermines the
legitimacy of the order and suggests a lack of due process (Rudisell v.
Paquette, 89 S.W.3d 233 (Tex. App. 2002); Kahn v. Garcia, 816 S.W.2d 131
(Tex. App. 1991)).
6. Why the Respondent, Not the Opposing Party, Is Entitled
to Relief
The record demonstrates that the opposing counsel, Cooper L. Carter, has
engaged in serious professional misconduct, including:
Failing to prosecute the case for over 17 months, in violation of the
duty to act diligently and competently (Tex. Fam. Code § 107.0131).
Relying on the judges to move the case forward, rather than actively
prosecuting the case, which is a breach of professional responsibility
(Tex. R. Disc. P. 1.06).
Signing and presenting to the court a document she knew to contain
false statements, which constitutes fraud and is a criminal offense
under Texas law (Tex. Pen. Code § 37.10; Tex. Disc. R. Prof. Cond. 8.04).
Interrupting relief for a child, leading to a medical emergency, which is
a violation of the duty to act in the best interests of the child and may
constitute professional misconduct and grounds for disciplinary action
(Tex. Fam. Code § 107.0131).
Such conduct not only precludes any entitlement to sanctions but also
exposes Carter to potential civil and disciplinary liability, including being
named as a defendant in a federal lawsuit for willful misconduct and
deprivation of rights under color of law (Tex. Pen. Code § 37.13; Tex. R. Disc.
P. 15.05).
Exceptions and Caveats
There are no relevant exceptions in the statutory or case law that would
permit a judge to impose sanctions or take action on a recusal motion that
was never filed. The procedural requirements are mandatory and
jurisdictional. Any deviation from these requirements is a clear error and
renders subsequent orders void (In re Gold, 04-25-00085-CV (Tex. App. May
07, 2025); In re Norman, 191 S.W.3d 858 (Tex. App. 2006)).

Conclusion
Judge David L. Evans’s order is legally erroneous because it references and
acts upon a tertiary recusal motion against Judge Kaitcer that was never
filed, in violation of the mandatory procedures set out in Texas law. The
improper involvement of the court coordinator, the lack of a valid motion,
and the imposition of sanctions without legal basis collectively undermine
the integrity of the recusal process and expose the Texas judiciary to public
embarrassment. Whether due to being misled by staff or a willful disregard
for the rules, the result is a process that is arbitrary, lacks transparency, and
is inconsistent with the requirements of due process and judicial integrity.
The order should be vacated, and the recusal process should be conducted
strictly in accordance with the law to restore confidence in the judiciary.
Furthermore, the record demonstrates that the opposing counsel, Cooper L.
Carter, has engaged in serious professional misconduct, which not only
precludes any entitlement to sanctions but also exposes her to potential civil
and disciplinary liability. The respondent is entitled to relief, not sanctions,
and the court should take appropriate action to address the misconduct of
opposing counsel and restore the integrity of the judicial process.
Legal Authorities
De La Paz v. State, 279 S.W.3d 336 (Tex. Crim. App. 2009)
Texas Court of Criminal Appeals
Extract
Under the Texas Rules of Evidence, evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or
acts is not admissible 'to prove the character of a person in order to show
action in conformity therewith.' But it may 'be admissible for other purposes,
such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge,
identity, or absence of mistake or accident.' The exceptions listed under Rule
404(b) are neither mutually exclusive nor collectively exhaustive. 'Rule
404(b) is a rule of inclusion rather than exclusion.' The rule excludes only
that evidence that is offered (or will be used) solely for the purpose of
proving bad character and hence conduct in conformity with that bad
character.
Summary
The passage explains that evidence of other wrongs or acts is generally not
admissible to prove a person's character to show action in conformity with
that character. However, such evidence can be admissible for other
purposes, such as proving motive, intent, or absence of mistake. This
principle is relevant in assessing the admissibility of evidence regarding
Cooper L. Carter's alleged misconduct, as it could be used to demonstrate
intent or a pattern of behavior rather than simply character.

Frenkel v. Courtney, 05-21-01114-CV (Tex. App. Jun 09, 2023)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Frenkel argues the trial court had no basis under Texas Rule of Civil
Procedure 215 to impose sanctions. The Courtney Parties concede that the
sanctions imposed by the trial court are not included within Rule 215's
enumerated list of sanctions. Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 215.3 permits a
court to impose sanctions on a party who abuses the discovery process. See
TEX. R. CIV. P. 215.3 (Abuse of Discovery Process in Seeking, Making, or
Resisting Discovery). The available sanctions for abusing the discovery
process while resisting discovery are enumerated in Rule 215.2(b). See TEX.
R. CIV. P. 215.2(b); see also TEX. R. CIV. P. 215.3. The sanction assessed by
the trial court, a $1,000 fine payable to TLAP and additional hours of CLE,
do not fall within the relevant paragraphs of Rule 215.2. See TEX. R. CIV. P.
215.2(b). Accordingly, we conclude Rule 215 cannot form the basis for
affirming the trial court's sanctions order. We sustain Frenkel's issue to this
extent.
Summary
The passage highlights that sanctions must be grounded in specific
procedural rules, and if a sanction does not fall within the enumerated list of
permissible sanctions under the relevant rule, it cannot be upheld. This
principle can be applied to Judge Evans's order, which imposes sanctions
without a valid basis, as no tertiary recusal motion was filed. The order lacks
the necessary procedural foundation, making it void.

Children&#39;s Hosp., 446 S.W.3d 355, 363 (Tex. 2014). 'A just sanction
must be directed against the abusive conduct with an eye toward remedying
the prejudice caused to the innocent party, and the sanction must be visited
upon the true offender.' Id. '[T]he sanction imposed should be no more
severe than necessary to satisfy its legitimate purposes.' Id. 'Legitimate
purposes may include securing compliance with the relevant rules of civil
procedure, punishing violators, and deterring other litigants from similar

Summary
The imposition of sanctions must be based on conduct that is clearly
sanctionable, and the sanctions must be just, meaning they should not be
unjust or excessive. They must be directed at the actual abusive conduct and
should aim to remedy any prejudice caused to the innocent party. The
sanctions should not be more severe than necessary and should serve
legitimate purposes such as compliance with procedural rules, punishment
of violators, and deterrence of similar misconduct.

Summary
Standard for reviewing a trial court's imposition of sanctions, emphasizing
that a trial court abuses its discretion if it acts without reference to guiding
rules and principles, or if it fails to correctly apply the law to the facts. This
is relevant to Judge Evans's order because it suggests that if the order for
sanctions was based on a nonexistent motion, it would constitute an abuse of
discretion. The passage also highlights the necessity for a trial court to have
a clear legal basis for its actions, which appears to be lacking in Judge
Evans's order.
Attorney General of Texas on Behalf of State v. Cartwright, 874 S.W.2d 210
(Tex. App. 1994)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
A trial court may impose sanctions against an attorney, a represented party,
or both for pleadings, motions, or other papers filed in bad faith or which
are groundless and have no basis in law or fact. TEX.R.CIV.P. 13. Pursuant to
Rule 13, the trial court shall, in its discretion, impose an appropriate
sanction if it determines after notice and hearing that the attorney has
violated the rule. The rule further provides that the court may impose any
appropriate sanction available under Rule 215(2)(b), including the
assessment of attorney fees. TEX.R.CIV.P. 215(2)(b)(8).
Summary
Sanctions under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 13 can only be imposed if a
filing is determined to be groundless or made in bad faith after notice and a
hearing. The rule requires that the court's order be just and specifically
related to the harm done by the sanctioned conduct. In the current situation,
Judge Evans's order for sanctions is groundless because it is based on a
nonexistent motion to recuse Associate Judge Kaitcer. Without a valid
motion, there is no basis for sanctions under Rule 13 or Tex. Civ. Prac. &
Rem. Code § 30.016. Furthermore, the order does not provide a reasoned
explanation for the sanctions, violating due process requirements.

Extract
The trial court's sanctions order precluded Rachel from presenting any
witnesses other than herself at trial. We find the trial court abused its
discretion in imposing sanctions that were both impermissible under the
circumstances and violative of the TransAmerican Natural Gas Corporation
v. Powell, 811 S.W.2d 913 (Tex. 1991) standards. ... The attorney ad litem did
not specify any discovery abuses in her motion for sanctions. Rather, the
motion was entirely premised on the issue of attorney's fees due her.
Although the exclusion of evidence is recognized as an appropriate
deterrent to abuse of the discovery process, such a sanction is improper
where the conduct bears no relationship to discovery. ... Any sanction that
adjudicates a claim and precludes the presentation of the merits of the case
constitutes a death penalty sanction.
Summary
The passage highlights that sanctions must be directly related to the
conduct they are intended to address and should not be imposed without a
valid basis. In the case of Judge Evans, the order for sanctions is groundless
because it is based on a nonexistent motion, similar to how the sanctions in
the passage were found to be improper due to a lack of a valid basis.
Additionally, the passage underscores that sanctions should not preclude the
presentation of a case's merits, which aligns with the argument that Judge
Evans's order violates due process.

Extract
Finally, we agree with Stacey that, on this record, the county court at law
had no discretion to impose sanctions under its inherent authority. The
Supreme Court of Texas recently clarified the scope of the inherent
authority to impose sanctions on litigants and their attorneys, emphasizing
that such a sanction requires a predicate finding of bad faith: Inherent
powers must be exercised with restraint, discretion, and great caution. To
that end, invocation of the court's inherent power to sanction necessitates a
finding of bad faith.. .. Bad faith is not just intentional conduct but intent to
engage in conduct for an impermissible reason, willful noncompliance, or
willful ignorance of the facts. Bad faith includes conscious doing of a wrong
for a dishonest, discriminatory, or malicious purpose. Errors in judgment,
lack of diligence, unreasonableness, negligence, or even gross negligence—
without more—do not equate to bad faith. Improper motive, not perfection,
is the touchstone.

Summary
The imposition of sanctions under the court's inherent authority requires a
finding of bad faith, which involves intentional conduct for an impermissible
reason, willful noncompliance, or willful ignorance of the facts. Mere errors
in judgment, lack of diligence, or negligence do not equate to bad faith.
Therefore, for Judge Evans to impose sanctions, there must be a clear
finding of bad faith, which appears to be absent in this case.

Pursuant to Rule 215.3 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, a trial court
may sanction any party who perpetrates discovery abuses. White v. Bath,
825 S.W.2d 227, 229 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 1992, writ denied). In
addition, a trial court possesses the inherent power to discipline an
attorney's behavior through the imposition of sanctions in appropriate cases.
In re Bennett, 960 S.W.2d 35, 40 (Tex.1997). Even in the absence of an
applicable rule or statute, courts have the authority to sanction parties for
bad faith abuses if it finds that to do so will aid in the exercise of its
jurisdiction, in the administration of justice, and the preservation of its
independence and integrity. Roberts v. Rose, 37 S.W.3d 31, 33 (Tex.App.-San
Antonio 2000, no pet.).
Summary
Texas courts have broad authority to impose sanctions for discovery abuses
and attorney misconduct. This authority is derived from both specific rules,
such as Rule 215.3 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, and the inherent
power of the court to maintain its integrity and jurisdiction. However, the
imposition of sanctions must be based on actual misconduct or abuse, and
the court must provide a reasoned explanation for the sanctions imposed.

The Texas Supreme Court emphasizes that judges must comply with
procedural rules, such as Rule 18a, which governs recusal procedures. This
compliance is essential to maintain professional competence and uphold the
integrity of the judiciary. Judge Evans's order for sanctions is groundless
because it is based on a nonexistent motion, violating Rule 18a, which
requires a valid motion to trigger recusal procedures and any related
sanctions. The improper involvement of a court coordinator, rather than the
clerk, further undermines the process's integrity, violating the requirement
for neutrality.

Extract
Rule 13 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure states: The signatures of
attorneys or parties constitute a certificate by them that they have read the
pleading, motion, or other paper; that to the best of their knowledge,
information and belief formed after reasonable inquiry the instrument is not
groundless and brought in bad faith or groundless and brought for the
purpose of harassment. If a pleading, motion or other paper is signed in
violation of this rule, the court, upon motion or upon its own initiative, after
notice and hearing, shall impose an appropriate sanction under Rule 215,
upon the person who signed it, a represented party, or both.
Summary
Rule 13 requires that for sanctions to be imposed, the pleading must be both
groundless and brought in bad faith or for the purpose of harassment. The
burden is on the movant to establish not only the frivolity of the claim but
also the improper motives underlying the decision to file the suit, motion, or
document. In this case, Judge Evans's order for sanctions is groundless
because it is based on a motion that was never filed, and there is no
evidence of bad faith or harassment. Furthermore, the order does not
provide a reasoned explanation for the sanctions, violating due process
requirements.

circumstances of the case, the trial court's action was arbitrary or
unreasonable. Low v. Henry, 221 S.W.3d 609, 614 (Tex.2007). To determine if

The imposition of sanctions must be based on a clear abuse of discretion,
which occurs when a court acts without reference to guiding rules or

a direct nexus between the improper conduct and the sanction imposed, and
the sanction must not be excessive. In this case, Judge Evans's order for

sanctions is groundless because it is based on a nonexistent motion, lacks a
direct nexus to any improper conduct by the respondent, and does not
provide a factual or legal basis for the sanctions. Additionally, the
involvement of a court coordinator in the recusal process, contrary to
procedural rules, further undermines the integrity of the process.
Powell v. Fletcher, 695 S.W.3d 675 (Tex. App. 2024)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a(h) permits the judge who hears a motion
for recusal to order the party or attorney who filed the motion, or both, to
pay 'reasonable attorney fees and expenses incurred .. if the judge
determines that the motion was (1) groundless and filed in bad faith or for
the purpose of harassment, or (2) clearly brought for unnecessary delay and
without sufficient cause.' Tex. R. Civ P.18a(h).
Summary
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a(h) allows for sanctions only if a motion to
recuse is found to be groundless, filed in bad faith, or for the purpose of
harassment, or if it was clearly brought for unnecessary delay and without
sufficient cause. In this case, Judge Evans's order for sanctions is groundless
because it is based on a tertiary recusal motion that was never filed. Without
a valid motion, there is no basis for determining that the motion was
groundless or filed in bad faith, and thus no legal basis for imposing
sanctions. Furthermore, the improper involvement of a court coordinator in
the recusal process undermines the integrity and neutrality required by the
rules, further invalidating the sanctions.
Campbell v. Goeckeritz, 04-23-01091-CV (Tex. App. Dec 11, 2024)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
A trial court may impose sanctions under its inherent authority, by statute,
by rule, or through a combination thereof to effectuate the orderly
administration of justice. In re Estate of Perez-Muzza, 446 S.W.3d 415, 424
(Tex. App.-San Antonio 2014, pet. denied). In this case, the trial court's
Sanctions order dismissed Sonja's case with prejudice under the authority of
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 13 and Chapter 10 of the Texas Civil Practice
and Remedies Code. See Tex. R. Civ. P. 13; Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code §
10.001, et seq. Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 13 provides that a pro se party
or an attorney who signs a pleading, motion, or other document certifies
that the signatory read the instrument and 'that to the best of their

knowledge, information, and belief formed after reasonable inquiry the
instrument is not groundless and brought in bad faith or groundless and
brought for the purpose of harassment.' Tex.R.Civ.P. 13; see KB Home Lone
Star Inc. v. Gordon, 629 S.W.3d 649, 658 (Tex. App.-San Antonio 2021, no
pet.). 'Generally, courts presume that pleadings and other papers are filed in
good faith' and '[t]he party seeking sanctions bears the burden of
overcoming this presumption of good faith.' Low, 221 S.W.3d at 614. To
overcome this presumption, the party seeking Rule 13 sanctions must first
establish that the complained-of document is groundless.
Summary
Sanctions under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 13 and Chapter 10 of the
Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code require a finding that a pleading is
groundless and filed in bad faith or for the purpose of harassment. The party
seeking sanctions bears the burden of overcoming the presumption of good
faith in filings. In the case of Judge Evans's order, there is no evidence of a
filed motion to recuse Associate Judge Kaitcer, making the basis for
sanctions nonexistent. Additionally, the order does not provide a factual
basis for determining that the motion was groundless or filed in bad faith,
violating due process requirements.
Darnell v. Broberg, 565 S.W.3d 450 (Tex. App. 2018)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
First, Chapter 10 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code allows a
trial court to impose sanctions against a party for pleadings that were filed
with an improper purpose or that lack legal or factual support. In particular,
section 10.001 of the Code provides that upon signing a pleading or motion,
a signatory attests that to his best knowledge, information, and belief,
formed after reasonable inquiry: TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. §
10.001. Second, Rule 13 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure gives a trial
court authority to impose sanctions on a person who has filed pleadings that
are groundless and brought in bad faith or for the purpose of harassment.
TEX. R. CIV. P. 13; see also Nath v. Texas Children’s Hosp., 446 S.W.3d 355,
362–63 (Tex. 2014). Rule 13 provides that the signature of an attorney on a
pleading constitutes a 'certificate' that he has 'read the pleading, motion, or
other paper; that to the best of their knowledge, information, and belief
formed after reasonable inquiry the instrument is not groundless and
brought in bad faith or groundless and brought for the purpose of
harassment.' TEX. R. CIV. P. 13.
Summary
Sanctions under Chapter 10 and Rule 13 require that the pleadings be
groundless, brought in bad faith, or for the purpose of harassment. The
passage emphasizes that the signing of a pleading constitutes a certification

=== PAGE 78 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
that it is not groundless and not brought in bad faith. Therefore, for
sanctions to be imposed, there must be a valid basis showing that the
pleadings were indeed groundless or filed with improper intent.
Loeffler v. Lytle Independent School Dist., 211 S.W.3d 331 (Tex. App. 2006)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
To prevail under Chapter 10, there must be little or no basis for the claims,
no grounds for legal arguments, misrepresentation of law or facts, or legal
action that is sought in bad faith. See Herring, 27 S.W.3d at 143. Similarly,
Rule 13 allows a court the option of imposing sanctions on both a party and
counsel for pleadings, motions, or other papers signed and filed that are
groundless and brought in bad faith or for the purpose of harassment. In re
C.M.V., 136 S.W.3d 280, 284 (Tex.App.-San Antonio 2004, no pet.).
Summary
Sanctions under Chapter 10 and Rule 13 require that the claims be
groundless, brought in bad faith, or for the purpose of harassment. The
passage emphasizes that there must be little or no basis for the claims or
legal arguments, and any misrepresentation of law or facts can also lead to
sanctions. This is relevant because Judge Evans's order for sanctions is
based on a nonexistent motion, which means there is no basis for the claims
or legal arguments, making the order groundless.
Coyle v. Walker, 03-23-00599-CV (Tex. App. Jan 24, 2025)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
We generally review a trial court's award of sanctions for an abuse of
discretion. A trial court abuses its discretion if its ruling is arbitrary,
unreasonable, or without reference to any guiding rules or legal principles.
Summary
Standard for reviewing a trial court's decision to impose sanctions. It states
that a trial court abuses its discretion if its ruling is arbitrary, unreasonable,
or without reference to any guiding rules or legal principles. This standard
is applicable to the situation involving Judge Evans's order for sanctions, as
it suggests that the order may be groundless if it lacks a valid legal basis or
is not supported by the facts of the case.

Fuentes v. Zaragoza, 555 S.W.3d 141 (Tex. App. 2018)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Section 10.001 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code provides, in
relevant part, that the signing of pleadings and motions constitutes a
certificate by the signatory that each allegation or other factual contention
in the pleading or motion 'has evidentiary support or, for a specifically
identified allegation or factual contention, is likely to have evidentiary
support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or
discovery.' TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE § 10.001(3). Sections 10.002 and
10.004 authorize the trial court to impose sanctions for a violation of section
10.001, including an order that counsel who signed pleadings in violation of
section 10.001 must pay the other party’s reasonable expenses, 'including
reasonable attorney’s fees.' Id. §§ 10.002(a), (c), 10.004(c)(3). Texas Rule of
Civil Procedure 13 provides sanctions for a party filing a pleading that is
groundless and brought in bad faith or groundless and brought to harass.
TEX. R. CIV. P. 13. Rule 13 explains that 'groundless' means that the claim
has 'no basis in law or fact and not warranted by good faith argument for
the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law.' Id. Bad faith is the
conscious doing of a wrong for dishonest, discriminatory, or malicious
purposes; bad faith does not exist when a party merely exercises bad
judgment or is negligent.
Summary
The Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code and the Texas Rules of Civil
Procedure provide clear guidelines for when sanctions can be imposed.
Sanctions are appropriate when a pleading is signed without evidentiary
support or is groundless and brought in bad faith. In this case, Judge Evans's
order for sanctions is groundless because it is based on a motion that was
never filed, violating the requirement for evidentiary support. Additionally,
the order does not provide a factual basis for the sanctions, nor does it make
the required findings of bad faith or harassment. Therefore, the order is void
and constitutes an abuse of discretion.

Extract
We review the imposition of sanctions under Chapter 10 of the Texas Civil
Practice and Remedies Code under the same standard we review sanctions
under Rule 13—abuse of discretion. See Am. Flood Research, Inc. v. Jones,
192 S.W.3d 581, 583 (Tex. 2006) (per curiam); Cire v. Cummings, 134 S.W.3d
835, 838 (Tex. 2004). When a trial court imposes Chapter 10 or Rule 13

=== PAGE 80 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
sanctions, the ruling should be overturned only when it is arbitrary or
unreasonable. Low v. Henry, 221 S.W.3d 609, 614 (Tex. 2007). 'The degree of
discretion afforded by the trial court is... greater when sanctions are
imposed for groundless pleadings than when imposed for discovery abuse.'
Summary
The imposition of sanctions under Chapter 10 and Rule 13 is reviewed for
abuse of discretion, meaning the ruling should be overturned if it is
arbitrary or unreasonable. The passage highlights that the trial court has
greater discretion when imposing sanctions for groundless pleadings than
for discovery abuse. This suggests that any sanctions imposed must be
based on a valid and reasonable basis, and the absence of a filed motion or
valid grounds for sanctions would render the order arbitrary and an abuse of
discretion.
Tex. Gov't. Code § 74.101 Tex. Gov't. Code § 74.101 Court Coordinators
Extract
(a) The local administrative judge and each district or statutory county court
judge may establish a court coordinator system and appoint a court
coordinator for his court to improve justice and expedite the processing of
cases through the courts. (b) Each court coordinator serves at the pleasure
of the judge who appointed him.
Summary
Court coordinators are appointed by judges to improve justice and expedite
case processing. They serve at the pleasure of the appointing judge,
indicating that they are not independent officers but rather serve under the
direct authority of the judge. This is relevant to the issues in the case
because it highlights the potential for a lack of neutrality and independence
in the handling of recusal motions, as the coordinator's actions are directly
influenced by the judge's preferences.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
pretrial matters, and the trial on the merits: (i) obtain and review copies of
all court files in the suit during the attorney ad litem's course of
representation; and (ii) when necessary, conduct formal discovery under the
Texas Rules of Civil Procedure or the discovery control plan; (D) take any
action consistent with the parent's interests that the attorney ad litem
considers necessary to expedite the proceedings; (E) encourage settlement
and the use of alternative forms of dispute resolution; (F) review and sign,
or decline to sign, a proposed or agreed order affecting the parent; (G) meet
before each court hearing with the parent, unless the court: (i) finds at that
hearing that the attorney ad litem has shown good cause why the attorney
ad litem's compliance is not feasible; or (ii) on a showing of good cause,
authorizes the attorney ad litem to comply by conferring with the parent, as
appropriate, by telephone or video conference; (H) abide by the parent's
objectives for representation; (I) become familiar with the American Bar
Association's standards of practice for attorneys who represent parents in
abuse and neglect cases; and (J) complete at least three hours of continuing
legal education relating to representing parents in child protection cases as
described by Subsection (b) as soon as practicable after the attorney ad
litem is appointed, unless the court finds that the attorney ad litem has
experience equivalent to that education; and is entitled to: (A) request
clarification from the court if the role of the attorney ad litem is ambiguous;
(B) request a hearing or trial on the merits; (C) consent or refuse to consent
to an interview of the parent by another attorney; (D) receive a copy of each
pleading or other paper filed with the court; (E) receive notice of each
hearing in the suit; (F) participate in any case staffing conducted by the
Department of Family and Protective Services in which the parent is invited
to participate, including, as appropriate, a case staffing to develop a family
plan of service, a family group conference, a permanency conference, a
mediation, a case staffing to plan for the discharge and return of the child to
the parent, a case staffing related to a placement in a residential treatment
center or qualified residential treatment program, and any other case
staffing that the department determines would be appropriate for the parent
to attend, but excluding any internal department staffing or staffing between
the department and the department's legal representative; and (G) attend all
legal proceedings in the suit.
Summary
An attorney ad litem has specific duties to competently represent the
interests of a parent in child protection cases. These duties include
interviewing relevant parties, investigating the facts, ensuring competent
representation at hearings, and taking actions consistent with the parent's
interests. The attorney is also required to encourage settlement, review
proposed orders, and meet with the parent before hearings. The statute
emphasizes the attorney's role in actively participating in the case and
maintaining communication with the parent. Failure to fulfill these duties
could constitute professional misconduct.

A public servant acting under color of his office or employment commits an
offense if he: intentionally denies or impedes another in the exercise or
enjoyment of any right, privilege, power, or immunity, knowing his conduct
is unlawful.
Summary
A public servant, such as a judge, commits an offense if they intentionally
deny or impede another's rights, knowing their conduct is unlawful. This is
relevant to Judge Evans's actions, as imposing sanctions without a valid
motion and without due process could be seen as impeding the respondent's
rights unlawfully.
Tex. Pen. Code § 39.02 Tex. Pen. Code § 39.02 Abuse of Official Capacity
Extract
A public servant commits an offense if, with intent to obtain a benefit or with
intent to harm or defraud another, he intentionally or knowingly: violates a

government property, services, personnel, or any other thing of value
belonging to the government that has come into the public servant's custody
or possession by virtue of the public servant's office or employment.
Summary
The statute outlines that a public servant, such as a judge, commits an
offense if they intentionally or knowingly violate a law related to their office
or misuse government property or services. This is relevant to Judge Evans's
actions if he knowingly imposed sanctions without a valid legal basis, as it
could be seen as a misuse of his official capacity. The statute provides a
framework for understanding how such actions could be legally challenged.

1 Tex. Admin. Code § 155.157 1 Tex. Admin. Code § 155.157 Sanctioning
Authority
Extract
The judge has the authority to impose appropriate sanctions against a party
or its representative for: filing a motion or pleading that is deemed by the
judge to be groundless and brought: (A) in bad faith; (B) for the purpose of
harassment; or (C) for any other improper purpose, such as to cause
unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of the proceeding; abuse
of the discovery process in seeking, making, or resisting discovery; or failure
to obey an order of the judge or a SOAH or referring agency rule.
Summary
Sanctions can only be imposed if a motion or pleading is deemed groundless
and brought in bad faith, for harassment, or for any improper purpose. The
passage outlines specific behaviors that justify sanctions, such as abuse of
the discovery process or failure to obey an order. However, in the case of
Judge Evans, the order for sanctions is based on a nonexistent motion, which
does not meet the criteria for imposing sanctions as outlined in the passage.
Therefore, the order is groundless because it lacks a valid basis for
sanctions, as no motion was filed, and there is no evidence of bad faith or
improper purpose.

For purposes of Section 1-a, Article V, Texas Constitution, 'wilful or
persistent conduct that is clearly inconsistent with the proper performance
of a judge's duties' includes: wilful, persistent, and unjustifiable failure to
timely execute the business of the court, considering the quantity and
complexity of the business, including failure to meet deadlines, performance
measures or standards, or clearance rate requirements set by statute,
administrative rule, or binding court order; wilful violation of a provision of
the Texas penal statutes or the Code of Judicial Conduct; persistent or wilful
violation of the rules promulgated by the supreme court; incompetence in
the performance of the duties of the office; failure to cooperate with the
commission; violation of any provision of a voluntary agreement to resign
from judicial office in lieu of disciplinary action by the commission;
persistent or wilful violation of Article Code of Criminal Procedure 17.15,
Code of Criminal Procedure; or persistent or wilful violation of Section
22.302(a).
Summary
The Texas Government Code § 33.001 outlines what constitutes "wilful or
persistent conduct that is clearly inconsistent with the proper performance
of a judge's duties." This includes failure to execute court business timely,
violation of judicial conduct codes, and incompetence. Judge Evans's order
for sanctions is groundless because it is based on a nonexistent motion,
which is a procedural error and a violation of due process. The Respondent
is entitled to sanctions against the opposing party due to their misconduct,
including failure to prosecute, reliance on judges to move the case forward,
and submission of false documents, which are violations of professional
conduct rules.

Extract
On the judge's own motion or on motion of a party and after notice and an
opportunity for a hearing, a judge may impose sanctions against a party or
its representative for: filing a motion or pleading that is groundless and
brought: (A) in bad faith; (B) for the purpose of harassment; or (C) for any
other improper purpose, such as to cause unnecessary delay or needless
increase in the cost of the proceeding; abuse of the discovery process in
seeking, making, or resisting discovery; or failure to obey an order of the
judge or the commission.
Summary
Sanctions can be imposed for filing groundless motions or pleadings brought
in bad faith, for harassment, or for improper purposes. This aligns with
general legal principles applicable in judicial proceedings, where sanctions
are warranted only if a motion is groundless and filed with improper intent.
In the case of Judge Evans's order, the imposition of sanctions is groundless
because it is based on a non-existent motion to recuse, which cannot be
considered groundless or filed in bad faith since it was never filed at all.
Furthermore, the order does not provide a factual basis or findings to justify
sanctions, violating due process requirements.
Tex. Civ. Prac. and Rem. Code § 10.004 Tex. Civ. Prac. and Rem. Code §
10.004 Violation; Sanction
Extract
A court that determines that a person has signed a pleading or motion in
violation of Section CIVIL PRACTICE AND REMEDIES CODE 10.001 may
impose a sanction on the person, a party represented by the person, or both.
The sanction must be limited to what is sufficient to deter repetition of the
conduct or comparable conduct by others similarly situated.
Summary
Sanctions under Tex. Civ. Prac. and Rem. Code § 10.004 can only be imposed
if a person has signed a pleading or motion in violation of Section 10.001.
The sanctions must be limited to what is necessary to deter similar conduct.
In this case, Judge Evans's order for sanctions is groundless because it is
based on a nonexistent tertiary recusal motion against Judge Kaitcer.
Without a valid motion, there is no basis for sanctions under the statute.
Furthermore, the involvement of a court coordinator in the recusal process,
contrary to Rule 18a, undermines the integrity of the process and suggests
procedural impropriety.

16 Tex. Admin. Code § 21.71 16 Tex. Admin. Code § 21.71 Sanctions
Extract
A presiding officer, on his or her own motion or on the motion of a party,
after notice and an opportunity for a hearing, may impose appropriate
sanctions against a party or its representative for: filing a motion or
pleading that was brought in bad faith, for the purpose of harassment, or for
any other improper purpose, such as to cause unnecessary delay or needless
increase in the cost of the proceeding; abusing the discovery process in
seeking, making or resisting discovery; failing to obey an order of the
presiding officer or the commission.
Summary
Sanctions can only be imposed after notice and an opportunity for a hearing,
and they must be based on specific misconduct such as filing in bad faith or
for harassment. Judge Evans's order for sanctions is groundless because it is
based on a nonexistent motion, and there is no evidence of bad faith or
harassment by the respondent. Furthermore, the respondent is entitled to
sanctions against Cooper L. Carter due to her willful misconduct, including
not prosecuting the case for over 17 months, relying on judges to move the
case forward, signing a document with false statements, and interrupting
relief for a child leading to a medical emergency.

groundless; and any evidence of the complainant's motives in filing the
complaint.
Summary
Sanctions can only be imposed if a motion or pleading is deemed groundless
and brought in bad faith, for harassment, or for any improper purpose. The
passage also emphasizes the importance of evidence showing that the

=== PAGE 89 ===

complainant knew or should have known the allegations were groundless.
This aligns with the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 13, which requires
a specific finding of bad faith or improper purpose for sanctions to be
justified.
Tex. Pen. Code § 37.13 Tex. Pen. Code § 37.13 Record of a Fraudulent Court

Summary
Cooper L. Carter could potentially be named as a defendant in a federal
lawsuit if she knowingly presented a document containing false statements
to a judge, intending for it to be given legal effect. This conduct could
constitute an offense under Tex. Pen. Code § 37.13, which criminalizes the
use of fraudulent court documents. If her actions also violate federal law,
such as by depriving someone of their rights under color of law, she could
face federal charges as well.
Tex. Civ. Prac. and Rem. Code § 9.012 Tex. Civ. Prac. and Rem. Code § 9.012
Violation; Sanction
Extract
If the court determines that a pleading has been signed in violation of any
one of the standards prescribed by Section CIVIL PRACTICE AND
REMEDIES CODE 9.011, the court shall, not earlier than 90 days after the
date of the determination, at the trial or hearing or at a separate hearing
following reasonable notice to the offending party, impose an appropriate
sanction on the signatory, a represented party, or both.
Summary
Sanctions can only be imposed if a pleading is determined to have been
signed in violation of specific standards. The court must provide reasonable
notice and a hearing before imposing sanctions. In this case, Judge Evans's
order for sanctions is groundless because it is based on a nonexistent motion
to recuse, which means there is no pleading that could have violated the
standards of Section 9.011. Additionally, the order does not provide the
required notice or hearing, violating due process.

False statements.

Extract
Subsection (b) creates two exceptions to the statute's application to the
judicial branch. It states: 'Subsection (a) does not apply to a party to a
judicial proceeding, or that party's counsel, for statements, representations,
writings or documents submitted by such party or counsel to a judge or
magistrate in that proceeding.' 18 U.S.C.A. [sections] 1001 (1984 & Supp.
1998).
Summary
18 U.S.C.A. § 1001(b) provides an exception for parties and their counsel in
judicial proceedings from being prosecuted for false statements made in
those proceedings. However, this does not absolve an attorney from ethical
violations or misconduct under state disciplinary rules or other applicable
laws. Cooper L. Carter's actions, as described, may not be prosecutable
under this federal statute due to the exception, but they still constitute
serious ethical violations under the Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional
Conduct and could lead to civil liability or disciplinary action.

that the statement influenced or may have influenced the government
agency.(41) Additionally, the agency need not have actually believed or even
received the false statement for the materiality requirement to be met.(42) A
voluntary, non-mandatory statement may also qualify as material.(43)
Moreover, a statement may be material even if the maker derived no
pecuniary or economic benefit at the government&#39;s expense.(44)
Courts have recognized, however, an exception to the finding of materiality
where the government itself supplied information that the defendant relied
upon in making the statement.(45) In 1995, the Supreme Court overruled all
prior conflicting precedent in United States v. Gaudin(46) in addressing
whether the question of materiality is a question for the judge or the jury.
The respondent in Gaudin was charged with making false statements on
federal loan documents in violation of [sections] 1001. The Supreme Court
held that the trial court had erred by refusing to

Summary
Materiality in the context of false statements is a broad concept that does
not require the government to have believed or acted upon the false
statement. The passage also highlights that the materiality of a statement is
a question for the jury, not the judge, as established in United States v.
Gaudin. This is relevant to the misconduct of Cooper L. Carter, as signing
and presenting a document with false statements to a judge could be
considered material under federal law, even if no direct economic benefit
was derived.

false statements made to other governmental entities. (38) However,
[section] (1001) contains a judicial function exception: it does 'not apply to a
party to a judicial proceeding, or that party's counsel, for statements,
representations, writings or documents submitted by such party or counsel
to a judge or magistrate in that proceeding.' (39) The precise scope of this
exemption is a matter of some debate among the circuits. (40) Section 1001
also extends to affirmative acts of concealment even where no actual
statement has been made. (41) Concealing information with intent to
deceive the government is covered by [section] 1001, as is concealing
information with the intent to cause another to violate his duty to disclose.
(42) Affirmative acts include both nondisclosures and misrepresentations of
material facts. (43) In addition, silence may constitute a false statement
under [section] 1001 when it serves to mislead or when the...
Summary
18 U.S.C. § 1001 criminalizes false statements to federal entities but
includes an exception for statements made in judicial proceedings. However,
the statute also covers acts of concealment and misrepresentation intended
to deceive the government. This could be relevant if Cooper L. Carter's
actions involved misleading federal entities or concealing information with
the intent to deceive.

the administration of justice.
Summary
Attorneys are prohibited from engaging in dishonest conduct, fraud, deceit,
or misrepresentation, and from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the
administration of justice. These standards are applicable to attorneys in
Texas as well, under the Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct. If
Cooper L. Carter engaged in such conduct, she could be subject to
disciplinary action and potentially named as a defendant in a federal lawsuit
for her actions.
ATTORNEYS, E-DISCOVERY, AND THE CASE FOR 37(G).
Notre Dame Law Review - University of Notre Dame Law School -
Mancusi, Marilyn G. - 2022-05-01
Extract
Most federal courts have adopted the disciplinary rules of the state courts in
which they reside. These rules establish disciplinary proceedings for
attorneys. These rules explain, among other things, to whom a report of
professional misconduct should be made, the process for investigating the
misconduct, and the procedures for a fair hearing on the report. Each state's
supreme court also 'authorizes a body to investigate complaints against
attorneys, determine if disciplinary charges are warranted, and if so, file and
prosecute disciplinary charges.'
Summary
Federal courts often adopt the disciplinary rules of the state courts where
they are located. These rules provide a framework for reporting,
investigating, and prosecuting attorney misconduct. If Cooper L. Carter's
actions, such as not prosecuting for over 17 months, relying on judges to
move the case forward, signing a document with false statements, and
interrupting relief for a child leading to a medical emergency, are deemed
misconduct under these rules, she could be subject to disciplinary
proceedings. This could potentially lead to her being named as a defendant
in a federal lawsuit if her actions violated federal laws or rights.

Extract
The EOIR Disciplinary Counsel specifically alleged that, on at least eight
occasions, the respondent enlisted his legal assistant to appear in his place
and impersonate him during telephonic appearances before Immigration
Judges. The EOIR Disciplinary Counsel alleged that the respondent assisted
and facilitated the unlawful practice of law in at least eight cases in violation
of 8 C.F.R. § 1003.102(m); knowingly made false statements of material fact
to an officer of the Department of Justice in violation of 8 C.F.R. §
1003.102(c); engaged in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice
in violation of 8 C.F.R. § 1003.102(n); and failed to provide competent
representation to a client in violation of 8 C.F.R. § 1003.102(o).
Summary
The passage highlights the types of misconduct that can lead to disciplinary
action against an attorney, including making false statements, engaging in
conduct prejudicial to justice, and failing to provide competent
representation. These are relevant to the allegations against Cooper L.
Carter, as they provide a framework for understanding the potential
consequences of similar misconduct in a different jurisdiction.
15.05 Violations of Duties Owed to the Legal System
Extract
A. False Statements, Fraud, and Misrepresentation... 1. Disbarment is
generally appropriate when a Respondent, with the intent to deceive the
court or another, makes a false statement, submits a false document, or
improperly withholds material information, and causes serious or potentially
serious injury to a party, or causes a significant or potentially significant
adverse effect on the legal proceeding. 2. Suspension is generally
appropriate when a Respondent knows that false statements or documents
are being submitted to the court or another or that material information is
improperly being withheld, and takes no remedial action, and causes injury
or potential injury to a party, or causes an adverse or potentially adverse
effect on the legal proceeding.
Summary
The Texas Rules of Disciplinary Procedure provide clear guidelines for
imposing sanctions on attorneys who engage in misconduct involving false
statements or documents. Disbarment is appropriate when there is intent to
deceive and significant harm is caused, while suspension is appropriate
when the attorney knows of the falsehoods and fails to take remedial action,
causing harm or potential harm. These guidelines are directly relevant to
Cooper L. Carter's actions, as described, and suggest that her conduct could
warrant serious disciplinary action.
