Question
Charles was evicted from his home and divested of custody of his children as
a result of the coordinated actions of the mother, stepfather, and
grandparents. To have standing under RICO, the plaintiff must demonstrate
an injury to their business or property caused by the RICO violation. (18
U.S.C. § 1964(c)). The eviction from the home and loss of custody could
constitute injuries to Charles's property and parental rights, which may be
compensable under RICO if causally linked to the alleged racketeering
activity.
Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
Charles may have standing under RICO for his eviction claim as loss of
property rights in a residence can constitute a compensable "business or
property" injury under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c). However, the loss of child
custody likely cannot form the basis of a RICO claim as courts generally
interpret RICO to exclude personal injuries and intangible property interests
like parental rights.
Summary
Charles's potential RICO claim presents two distinct injury categories with
different outcomes. His eviction from his home—if directly caused by the
alleged racketeering activity of the mother, stepfather, and grandparents—
likely qualifies as an injury to "property" under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c). Case law
supports the proposition that loss of non-business property, including a
family residence, can constitute a cognizable RICO injury if it represents a
concrete financial loss and is proximately caused by the RICO violation.
However, Charles's loss of child custody presents a more challenging legal
hurdle. Courts have consistently interpreted RICO to exclude personal
injuries and intangible property interests that don't result in concrete
economic harm. While parental rights have significant value, they are
generally considered personal rather than economic interests under RICO
jurisprudence. Unless Charles can demonstrate specific economic damages
flowing directly from the loss of custody (separate from emotional harm),
this aspect of his claim faces substantial obstacles under the "business or
property" requirement of 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c).
Background and Relevant Legislation
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) provides
both criminal penalties and civil remedies for certain prohibited activities
involving an enterprise. The civil remedy provision, codified at 18 U.S.C. §
1964(c), states: "Any person injured in his business or property by reason of

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
a violation of section 1962 of this chapter may sue therefor in any
appropriate United States district court and shall recover threefold the
damages he sustains and the cost of the suit, including a reasonable
attorney's fee..." 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c).
This provision creates a private right of action for individuals who have
suffered certain types of injuries due to violations of RICO's substantive
provisions. However, it limits standing to those who have been injured in
their "business or property," creating a threshold requirement that plaintiffs
must satisfy before their claims can proceed.
The statutory language establishes two key requirements for standing: (1)
the plaintiff must have suffered an injury to their "business or property," and
(2) that injury must have occurred "by reason of" a violation of section 1962.
These two elements—injury to business or property, and causation—form the
foundation of RICO standing analysis.
Case Law Interpretation of RICO Standing
Requirements
Injury to "Business or Property" Requirement
Courts have developed a substantial body of case law interpreting what
constitutes an injury to "business or property" under RICO. In Diaz v. Gates,
420 F.3d 897 (9th Cir. 2005), the Ninth Circuit explained that "If the
defendant engages in a pattern of racketeering activity in a manner
forbidden by these provisions, and the racketeering activities injure the
plaintiff in his business or property, the plaintiff has a claim under § 1964(c).
There is no room in the statutory language for an additional, amorphous
'racketeering injury' requirement."
This interpretation focuses on whether the alleged injuries fall within the
categories of "business" or "property" rather than requiring some special
type of "racketeering injury." The court clarified that the focus should be on
whether the injury fits within the statutory categories, not whether it meets
some additional, judicially-created standard.
Particularly relevant to Charles's situation is Reynolds v. Condon, 908
F.Supp. 1494 (N.D. W.Va. 1996), where the court specifically addressed
whether loss of a home could constitute a RICO injury. The court stated:
"However, the court cannot find as a matter of law that loss of non-business
property, such as the marital home in this case, or loss of income is not a
RICO injury... The allegations of loss of property here, the marital home,
would therefore suffice, at this stage of the proceedings, to state a RICO
injury..." This case directly supports the proposition that Charles's eviction
from his home could constitute an injury to property under RICO.
However, courts have also established important limitations. In Pedrina v.
Chun, 906 F.Supp. 1377 (D. Haw. 1995), the court noted that the injury
"must consist of a concrete financial loss, and not mere injury to a valuable,
but intangible, property interest." This distinction between concrete

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
financial losses and intangible property interests is critical for analyzing
both aspects of Charles's claim.
Causation Requirement
The causation requirement under RICO has been interpreted to require
proximate cause, not merely but-for causation. In Econo-Car Intern. v.
Agency Rent-A-Car, 589 F.Supp. 1368 (D. Mass. 1984), the court emphasized
that "The acts of the defendant which violated § 1962 must have caused the
plaintiff's injury if the plaintiff is to state a cause of action under RICO." This
establishes a direct causal link requirement between the racketeering
activity and the claimed injury.
More recent cases have elaborated on this causation requirement. In 
Sunbelt Rentals, Inc. v. Second Life Equip., Civil Action 5:20-CV-00070-KDB-
DSC (W.D. N.C. May 06, 2022), the court outlined the elements of a RICO
claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) as "(1) the conducting; (2) of an enterprise;
(3) through a pattern; (4) of racketeering activity." The plaintiff must
demonstrate that these elements proximately caused their injury.
Similarly, Planned Parenthood Fed'n of Am., Inc. v. Ctr. for Med. Progress,
214 F.Supp.3d 808 (N.D. Cal. 2016) stated that "the conduct must be the
proximate cause of harm to the victim. Under § 1964(c), plaintiffs must also
allege that they have been injured in their 'property or business' by reason
of the alleged racketeering activities."
Secondary Materials on RICO Standing
Secondary materials provide additional insight into the interpretation and
application of RICO's standing requirements.
According to Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy (2024), "a showing of injury for a
civil RICO claim requires proof of a concrete financial loss and not mere
injury to a valuable intangible property interest... RICO's prohibitions may
be enforced in both criminal and civil contexts. In the context of a civil
action, a plaintiff must be directly injured by reason of the defendant's
racketeering activities. Proximate cause, as an aspect of RICO's 'by reason
of' standard, requires a RICO plaintiff to show that the defendant's
racketeering offenses led directly to the plaintiff's injuries."
PAYORS, PLAYERS, AND PROXIMATE CAUSE (2022) discusses the
causation requirement: "In Holmes, the Court determined that 'by reason of
means that plaintiffs must establish that a defendant's alleged RICO
violation proximately caused their injuries.'" This reinforces the requirement
that there must be a proximate causal relationship between the RICO
violation and the claimed injury.
Racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations (2010) states that "To sue
for a violation of [section] 1962(c), a plaintiff must have suffered an injury to
business or property caused by one of the predicate acts of racketeering."
Similarly, Racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations (2009) notes that
"To have standing for a civil cause of action under RICO, a plaintiff must

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
show: (i) a violation of [section][section] 1962(a), (b), (c), or (d); (ii) injury to
her business or property; and (iii) that the violation caused the injury."
Chapter Five: The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO)
Statute, 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961–1968 explicitly states that "Damages that are
recoverable include, for example, the payment of money, lost profits, and
overcharges. They do not include, for example, claims for personal injury or
mental anguish... Courts police the notion that 'the phrase "business or
property" . . . exclude[s] personal injuries suffered'... A plaintiff bringing a
civil RICO claim must allege an injury to his 'business or property'; he
cannot, for example, recover for 'personal injuries'... The requirement that
the injury be to the plaintiff's business or property means that the plaintiff
must show a proprietary type of damage, or, in other words, an 'economic
injury.'"
Analysis of Charles's RICO Claims
Eviction from Home as a RICO Injury
Based on the legal authorities provided, Charles has a strong argument that
his eviction from his home constitutes an injury to "property" under 18
U.S.C. § 1964(c). Reynolds v. Condon, 908 F.Supp. 1494 (N.D. W.Va. 1996)
directly supports this position, as the court explicitly recognized that "loss of
non-business property, such as the marital home in this case... is not
[excluded as] a RICO injury."
Charles's eviction represents a concrete loss of a tangible property interest
—his home. Unlike intangible property interests that courts have rejected, a
residence is a physical asset with clear economic value. The loss of his home
likely resulted in quantifiable financial damages, such as relocation costs,
potentially higher housing expenses, and possibly loss of equity if he had
ownership interest in the property.
The nature of this injury aligns with the types of concrete financial losses
that courts have recognized as compensable under RICO. As noted in Civil
Rico: A Tool of Advocacy, a civil RICO claim requires "proof of a concrete
financial loss and not mere injury to a valuable intangible property interest."
Charles's eviction appears to meet this standard.
However, to establish standing, Charles must also demonstrate that his
eviction was proximately caused by the alleged RICO violations. According
to PAYORS, PLAYERS, AND PROXIMATE CAUSE, this requires showing that
"a defendant's alleged RICO violation proximately caused their injuries."
Charles would need to prove that the coordinated actions of the mother,
stepfather, and grandparents constituted a pattern of racketeering activity
under § 1962, and that these actions directly led to his eviction.
This causal connection is critical. As stated in Econo-Car Intern. v. Agency
Rent-A-Car, 589 F.Supp. 1368 (D. Mass. 1984), "The acts of the defendant
which violated § 1962 must have caused the plaintiff's injury if the plaintiff is
to state a cause of action under RICO." If Charles can establish this direct
causal link, his claim regarding eviction appears viable under RICO.

Loss of Child Custody as a RICO Injury
Charles's claim regarding the loss of custody of his children presents more
significant challenges under RICO. The primary obstacle is the well-
established principle that RICO's "business or property" requirement
excludes personal injuries and intangible property interests.
Chapter Five: The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO)
Statute, 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961–1968 explicitly states that RICO damages "do not
include, for example, claims for personal injury or mental anguish" and that
"Courts police the notion that 'the phrase "business or property" . . .
exclude[s] personal injuries suffered.'" Similarly, Racketeer influenced and
corrupt organizations (2023) notes that "Civil RICO actions provide no
damages for the economic consequences of personal injuries sustained as a
result of a RICO predicate act."
Parental rights, while extremely valuable, are generally considered personal
rather than economic interests. Courts have consistently interpreted RICO
to exclude personal injuries and emotional harms from its scope. The loss of
custody likely falls into this category, as it primarily involves emotional and
familial bonds rather than economic interests.
However, if Charles could demonstrate specific economic damages flowing
directly from the loss of custody, separate from emotional harm, he might
have a stronger argument. For example, if he was required to pay child
support while being deprived of custody, or if he incurred substantial legal
fees directly related to regaining custody, these might arguably constitute
concrete financial losses. But even these would be tangential to the core
custody issue.
The limitation to "business or property" injuries under RICO reflects
Congress's intent to provide remedies for economic harms while leaving
personal injuries to other legal frameworks. As noted in Pedrina v. Chun,
906 F.Supp. 1377 (D. Haw. 1995), the injury "must consist of a concrete
financial loss, and not mere injury to a valuable, but intangible, property
interest."
Given these constraints, Charles's claim regarding loss of custody faces
substantial obstacles under RICO's standing requirements. While parental
rights are undoubtedly valuable, they do not fit neatly into the "business or
property" categories that RICO is designed to protect.
Causation Analysis for Both Claims
For both aspects of Charles's claim, establishing causation is crucial. As
outlined in Planned Parenthood Fed'n of Am., Inc. v. Ctr. for Med. Progress,
214 F.Supp.3d 808 (N.D. Cal. 2016), "the conduct must be the proximate
cause of harm to the victim." This requires showing that the alleged
racketeering activities of the mother, stepfather, and grandparents led
directly to Charles's injuries.

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
To establish this causal connection, Charles would need to demonstrate:
The defendants engaged in a "pattern of racketeering activity" as
defined by RICO
Their activities constituted a violation of § 1962
These violations directly caused his eviction and/or loss of custody
The requirement for proximate causation, not merely but-for causation, sets
a high bar for Charles to clear. As Racketeer influenced and corrupt
organizations (2009) states, "a plaintiff must prove that the defendant's
violation of [section] 1962 was the proximate cause of the plaintiff's injury to
have standing for a civil RICO action."
Exceptions and Caveats
Several important caveats apply to Charles's potential RICO claims:
First, courts have consistently interpreted RICO's "business or property"
language narrowly in certain contexts. While Reynolds v. Condon, 908
F.Supp. 1494 (N.D. W.Va. 1996) supports the inclusion of a home within
"property," not all courts may take this view, particularly if Charles was
merely a tenant rather than an owner of the property.
Second, establishing the existence of a RICO violation is a separate and
significant hurdle. Charles would need to prove that the defendants engaged
in a "pattern of racketeering activity" through the commission of specific
predicate acts enumerated in the statute. As noted in Sunbelt Rentals, Inc. v.
Second Life Equip., Civil Action 5:20-CV-00070-KDB-DSC (W.D. N.C. May 06,
2022), a RICO claim requires "(1) the conducting; (2) of an enterprise; (3)
through a pattern; (4) of racketeering activity." Without evidence of specific
predicate acts, Charles's claim would fail regardless of the nature of his
injuries.
Third, the interpretation of RICO has evolved over time, with courts
generally trending toward narrower readings of the statute. As noted in 
RICO - the rejection of an economic motive requirement (1995), while the
Supreme Court has previously stated that RICO should be "liberally
construed," recent trends suggest a more restrictive approach to RICO's
application.
Conclusion
Based on the legal authorities provided, Charles's potential RICO claim
presents a mixed picture:
For the claim related to eviction from his home, Charles has a plausible
argument for standing under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c). Reynolds v. Condon, 908
F.Supp. 1494 (N.D. W.Va. 1996) directly supports the proposition that loss of
a home can constitute an injury to "property" under RICO. If Charles can
demonstrate that this loss resulted in concrete financial damages and was
1.

3. 

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
proximately caused by the alleged racketeering activity of the defendants,
this aspect of his claim appears viable.
However, for the claim related to loss of child custody, the legal outlook is
considerably more challenging. RICO's "business or property" requirement
has been consistently interpreted to exclude personal injuries and intangible
property interests. As Chapter Five: The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations (RICO) Statute, 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961–1968 explicitly states, RICO
damages "do not include, for example, claims for personal injury or mental
anguish." Unless Charles can demonstrate specific economic damages
flowing directly from the loss of custody, this aspect of his claim faces
substantial obstacles.
In addition to these standing considerations, Charles would still need to
prove all the elements of a RICO violation—including the existence of an
enterprise, a pattern of racketeering activity, and specific predicate acts—to
succeed on his claims. The complexities of these requirements present
additional hurdles beyond the standing analysis.
In summary, while Charles's eviction-related claim may satisfy RICO's
standing requirements, his custody-related claim likely does not. The
success of his RICO action would ultimately depend on whether he can
establish both standing and the substantive elements of a RICO violation,
with particular focus on demonstrating concrete financial losses proximately
caused by the defendants' alleged racketeering activities.
Legal Authorities
Diaz v. Gates, 420 F.3d 897 (9th Cir. 2005)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Ninth Circuit
Extract
If the defendant engages in a pattern of racketeering activity in a manner
forbidden by these provisions, and the racketeering activities injure the
plaintiff in his business or property, the plaintiff has a claim under § 1964(c).
There is no room in the statutory language for an additional, amorphous
'racketeering injury' requirement.
Summary
For a RICO claim, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the racketeering
activities caused injury to their business or property. It emphasizes that
there is no additional requirement for a separate "racketeering injury." This
supports the proposition that if Charles's eviction and loss of custody can be
linked to racketeering activities, they may be considered injuries to his
property and parental rights under RICO.

No. 18-CV-5492 (N.D. Ill. May 28, 2019)
U.S. District Court — Northern District of Illinois
Extract
RICO provides a private cause of action for '[a]ny person injured in his
business or property by reason of a violation of [18 U.S.C. § 1962].' 18 U.S.C.
§ 1964(c). Subsections 1962(a) through (c) prohibit certain 'pattern[s] of
racketeering activity' in relation to an 'enterprise.' Subsection 1962(d)
makes it unlawful to conspire to violate subsections (a), (b), or (c) of section
1962.
Summary
Necessity of demonstrating a pattern of racketeering activity and the
involvement of an enterprise. This supports the proposition that Charles's
eviction and loss of custody could be considered injuries to his property and
parental rights, potentially compensable under RICO if they are causally
linked to the alleged racketeering activity.

Extract
The elements of a RICO claim are: (i) the conduct of (ii) an enterprise that
affects interstate commerce (iii) through a pattern (iv) of racketeering
activity or collection of unlawful debt. 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) ; Eclectic Props.
E., LLC v. Marcus & Millichap Co., 751 F.3d 990, 997 (9th Cir. 2014). In
addition, the conduct must be the proximate cause of harm to the victim.
Under § 1964(c), plaintiffs must also allege that they have been injured in
their 'property or business' by reason of the alleged racketeering activities.
Summary
Elements required to establish a RICO claim, including the need for the
conduct to be the proximate cause of harm and for the plaintiff to
demonstrate injury to "business or property." This supports the proposition
that Charles's eviction and loss of custody could be considered injuries to his
property and parental rights, potentially compensable under RICO if linked
to racketeering activity.

Extract
RICO authorizes a private civil action by 'any person injured in his business
or property by reason of a violation of section 1962.' 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c).
Private litigants have standing under RICO only to the extent that they have
been injured in their business or property by the conduct constituting the
RICO violation. Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Company, 473 U.S. 479, 495-96,
105 S.Ct. 3275, 3284-85, 87 L.Ed.2d 346 (1985). This injury must consist of
a concrete financial loss, and not mere injury to a valuable, but intangible,
property interest.
Summary
For a plaintiff to have standing under RICO, they must demonstrate a
concrete financial loss to their business or property caused by the RICO
violation. The passage emphasizes the need for a tangible injury rather than
an intangible one. This is relevant to Charles's situation because if his
eviction and loss of custody can be shown to result in a concrete financial
loss or a tangible injury to his property rights, it could potentially support a
RICO claim.
Reynolds v. Condon, 908 F.Supp. 1494 (N.D. W.Va. 1996)
U.S. District Court — Northern District of West Virginia
Extract
RICO provides that 'any person injured in his business or property by reason
of a violation of section 1962 of this chapter may sue therefor in any
appropriate United States district court and shall recover three-fold the
damages he sustains and the cost of the suit, including a reasonable
attorney's fee.' 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c)... However, the court cannot find as a
matter of law that loss of non-business property, such as the marital home in
this case, or loss of income is not a RICO injury... The allegations of loss of
property here, the marital home, would therefore suffice, at this stage of the
proceedings, to state a RICO injury...
Summary
The passage from "Reynolds v. Condon" discusses the requirements for
standing under RICO, specifically the need for an injury to business or
property. It clarifies that loss of non-business property, such as a marital
home, can constitute a RICO injury. This supports the proposition that
Charles's eviction from his home could be considered an injury to property
under RICO. The passage also emphasizes that the injury must be causally
linked to the alleged racketeering activity, aligning with the proposition's
requirement for a causal link.

Extract
RICO provides for both criminal and civil enforcement. The criminal
penalties are harsh. See 18 U.S.C. § 1963. Section 1964(c) creates the civil
remedy, stating that: Any person injured in his business or property by
reason of a violation of section 1962 of this chapter may sue therefor in any
appropriate United States district court and shall recover threefold the
damages he sustains and the cost of the suit, including a reasonable
attorney's fee... The acts of the defendant which violated § 1962 must have
caused the plaintiff's injury if the plaintiff is to state a cause of action under
RICO.
Summary
For a civil RICO claim, a plaintiff must demonstrate an injury to their
business or property caused by a violation of section 1962. The passage
emphasizes that the injury must be directly caused by the defendant's
racketeering activity. This supports the proposition that Charles's eviction
and loss of custody, if causally linked to the alleged racketeering activity,
could be considered injuries under RICO.

Robert W. Dibert
Extract
For the plaintiff to prevail on its RICO claim, you must find that the plaintiff
suffered an injury to its business or property, and that this injury was
proximately caused by reason of the defendant’s violation of RICO. ...
Damages that are recoverable include, for example, the payment of money,
lost profits, and overcharges. They do not include, for example, claims for
personal injury or mental anguish. ... Courts police the notion that 'the
phrase ‘business or property’ . . . exclude[s] personal injuries suffered.' ... A
plaintiff bringing a civil RICO claim must allege an injury to his ‘business or
property’; he cannot, for example, recover for ‘personal injuries.’ ... The
requirement that the injury be to the plaintiff’s business or property means
that the plaintiff must show a proprietary type of damage, or, in other words,
an ‘economic injury.’
Summary
Personal injuries are not compensable under RICO, but economic injuries to
business or property are. This supports the proposition that if Charles's
eviction and loss of custody can be framed as economic injuries to his
property rights, they may be compensable under RICO if causally linked to
the alleged racketeering activity.

Extract
an injury 'different in kind from that occurring as a result of the predicate
acts themselves, or not simply caused by the predicate acts, but also caused
by an activity which RICO was designed to deter.' The Court concluded that
courts should not narrow RICO in this way, but instead should construe it
broadly for two reasons. First, because Congress purposely left the language
in RICO broad; and second, because Congress expressly stated that RICO
was to 'be liberally construed.' In addition, the Court agreed with the
Seventh Circuit that 'the fact that RICO has been applied in situations not
expressly anticipated by Congress does not demonstrate ambiguity[,] [but]
demonstrates breadth.'
Summary
The passage emphasizes the broad and liberal construction of RICO as
intended by Congress. It highlights that RICO should not be narrowly
interpreted and that its application can extend to situations not explicitly
anticipated by Congress. This supports the proposition that injuries such as
eviction and loss of custody, if causally linked to racketeering activity, could
be considered under RICO, as the statute is designed to address a wide
range of injurious activities beyond traditional organized crime.

Extract
Standing for a civil cause of action under RICO is established when a
plaintiff shows: (i) any violation of § 1962; (ii) injury to the plaintiff’s
business or property; and (iii) the statutory violation caused the injury. ...
Civil RICO actions provide no damages for the economic consequences of
personal injuries sustained as a result of a RICO predicate act. A plaintiff’s
business or property must be directly injured to qualify for relief.
Summary
Personal injuries are not compensable under RICO, but injuries to business
or property are. This supports the proposition that if Charles's eviction and
loss of custody can be framed as injuries to his property or business
interests, and if these injuries are causally linked to a RICO violation, he
may have standing under RICO.

(304)... To sue for a violation of [section] 1962(c), a plaintiff must have
suffered an injury to business or property caused by one of the predicate
acts of racketeering. (309)... Moreover, a plaintiff must prove that the
defendant's violation of [section] 1962 was the proximate cause of the
plaintiff's injury to have standing for a civil RICO action. (314)
Summary
Necessity of showing a violation of specific RICO sections and that the injury
was proximately caused by the violation. This supports the proposition that
Charles's eviction and loss of custody could be considered injuries to his
property and parental rights if they are causally linked to the alleged
racketeering activity.

Extract
RICO's standing provision(380) provides that '[a]ny person injured in his
business or property by reason of a violation of [sections] 1962 of this
chapter' may bring a civil action under RICO.(381)... Courts agree that to
establish standing under [sections] 1962(c),(388) a plaintiff must have
suffered a harm caused by one of the predicate acts covered by [sections]
1962(c).(389)... In addition, the Supreme Court held that a plaintiff must
prove the defendant's violation was the proximate cause of the plaintiff's
injury in order to have standing under civil RICO.(391)
Summary
To have standing under RICO, a plaintiff must demonstrate an injury to their
business or property caused by a RICO violation. The passage emphasizes
the need for a causal link between the predicate acts and the injury, which
aligns with the proposition that Charles's eviction and loss of custody could
be considered injuries if they are causally linked to the alleged racketeering
activity.

Extract
A private party who is injured in her business or property because of a RICO
violation also can bring a civil action to recover damages. (248)... To sue for
a violation of [section] 1962(c), a plaintiff must have suffered an injury to
business or property caused by one of the predicate acts of racketeering.
(313)... the Court established that plaintiff has a claim under [section]
1964(c) if defendant engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity in a
manner forbidden by [section] 1962 and such activity injured plaintiff in his
business or property, Id. at 495.
Summary
The injury must be caused by a predicate act of racketeering. This supports
the proposition that Charles's eviction and loss of custody, if causally linked
to racketeering activity, could be considered injuries to his property and
parental rights under RICO.
Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy
The Brief - American Bar Association - 2024-01-01
Extract
The civil RICO cause of action is created by 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c), which
provides: 'Any person injured in his business or property by reason of a
violation of section 1962 of this chapter may sue therefor in any appropriate
United States district court and shall recover threefold the damages he
sustains and the cost of the suit, including a reasonable attorney’s
fee . . . .' ... a showing of injury for a civil RICO claim requires proof of a
concrete financial loss and not mere injury to a valuable intangible property
interest. ... RICO’s prohibitions may be enforced in both criminal and civil
contexts. In the context of a civil action, a plaintiff must be directly injured
by reason of the defendant’s racketeering activities. Proximate cause, as an
aspect of RICO’s 'by reason of' standard, requires a RICO plaintiff to show
that the defendant’s racketeering offenses led directly to the plaintiff’s
injuries.
Summary
To have standing under RICO, a plaintiff must demonstrate a direct injury to
their business or property caused by the defendant's racketeering activities.
The passage emphasizes the need for a concrete financial loss and the

requirement of proximate cause, meaning the racketeering activities must
directly lead to the plaintiff's injuries. This supports the proposition that
Charles's eviction and loss of custody, if causally linked to racketeering
activities, could be considered injuries under RICO.

Extract
A private civil right of action in [section] 1964 provides that '[a]ny person
injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962...
may sue.' (36) Notably, a successful plaintiff under [section] 1964 is entitled
to treble damages and the cost of the suit, including attorney fees. (37) ... In
Holmes, the Court evaluated the second part of statutory standing under
[section] 1964(c)--that the injury must be 'by reason of a RICO
violation.' (58) ... In Holmes, the Court determined that 'by reason of means
that plaintiffs must establish that a defendant's alleged RICO violation
proximately caused their injuries.' (60)
Summary
For a plaintiff to have standing under RICO, they must demonstrate an injury
to their business or property caused by a RICO violation. The passage
explains that the injury must be "by reason of" the RICO violation, meaning
there must be a proximate cause linking the violation to the injury. This
supports the proposition that Charles's eviction and loss of custody could be
considered injuries to his property and parental rights if they are causally
linked to the alleged racketeering activity.
