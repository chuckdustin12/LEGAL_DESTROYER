Question
Plaintiff’s complaint contains detailed factual allegations regarding the
timing, nature, and purpose of Defendants’ acts, including documentary
evidence and specific communications. On a motion to dismiss, the court
must accept all well-pleaded factual allegations as true and draw all
reasonable inferences in the plaintiff’s favor. (Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662,
678 (2009); Brown v. City of Tulsa, 124 F.4th 1251, 1263 (10th Cir. 2025)).
The district court improperly discounted Plaintiff’s allegations regarding the
ongoing nature of the scheme and the relationship between the acts, instead
of accepting them as true and determining whether they plausibly state a
claim for relief under RICO.
Answer (Tenth Circuit)
Short response
On a motion to dismiss, the court is required to accept all well-pleaded
factual allegations in the complaint as true and draw all reasonable
inferences in the plaintiff’s favor; the district court erred by discounting the
plaintiff’s detailed allegations regarding the ongoing nature and relationship
of the alleged RICO scheme. The prevailing standard, as articulated by the
Supreme Court and consistently applied in the Tenth Circuit, mandates that
the sufficiency of the complaint be assessed for plausibility, not probability,
based on the assumed truth of the plaintiff’s factual allegations.
Summary
Federal pleading standards, as established by the Supreme Court in Ashcroft
v. Iqbal and Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, and consistently applied by the
Tenth Circuit, require that courts evaluating a motion to dismiss under Rule
12(b)(6) must accept all well-pleaded factual allegations as true and draw all
reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff. This standard applies with full
force to civil RICO claims, where detailed allegations regarding the timing,
nature, and purpose of defendants’ acts—especially when supported by
documentary evidence and specific communications—must be credited at
the pleading stage.
The district court’s failure to accept the plaintiff’s allegations about the
ongoing nature of the scheme and the relationship between the acts as true,
and its improper weighing or discounting of those allegations, was
inconsistent with binding precedent. The correct approach is to determine
whether, assuming the truth of the plaintiff’s factual allegations, the
complaint plausibly states a claim for relief under RICO. The authorities
provided uniformly support this standard, and any deviation from it
constitutes reversible error.

Background and Relevant Law
Federal Pleading Standards: Rule 12(b)(6) and Rule 8(a)(2)
The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure set forth the standards for pleading
and for motions to dismiss. Rule 8(a)(2) requires a “short and plain
statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.” Rule
12(b)(6) allows a defendant to move to dismiss a complaint for “failure to
state a claim upon which relief can be granted.”
The Supreme Court, in Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662 (2009), clarified that
to survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual
matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its
face. The plausibility standard does not require detailed factual allegations,
but it does demand more than mere labels, conclusions, or a formulaic
recitation of the elements of a cause of action. When there are well-pleaded
factual allegations, the court should assume their veracity and then
determine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.
This two-step approach is further explained in secondary materials and
lower court decisions: first, courts must disregard conclusory allegations;
second, they must accept as true all non-conclusory factual allegations and
determine whether, in context, the claim is plausible as a matter of common
sense (Chapter 7. Pleading and Practice Issues).
The Tenth Circuit’s Application of the Standard
The Tenth Circuit has repeatedly and consistently applied the Iqbal/Twombly
standard. In Brown v. City of Tulsa, 124 F.4th 1251 (10th Cir. 2025), the
court reaffirmed that, in reviewing a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal, all well-
pleaded factual allegations must be accepted as true and all reasonable
inferences drawn in the plaintiff’s favor. This approach is echoed in
numerous Tenth Circuit decisions, including Brooks v. Mentor Worldwide
LLC, 985 F.3d 1272 (10th Cir. 2021), Bistline v. Parker, 918 F.3d 849 (10th
Cir. 2019), George v. Urban Settlement Servs., 833 F.3d 1242 (10th Cir.
2016), Khalik v. United Air Lines, 671 F.3d 1188 (10th Cir. 2012), and Hogan
v. Winder, 762 F.3d 1096 (10th Cir. 2014).
The Tenth Circuit has also made clear that the plausibility standard is not a
probability requirement. The court’s task is not to weigh the likelihood that
the plaintiff will ultimately prevail, but to determine whether the complaint’s
factual allegations, assumed true, plausibly entitle the plaintiff to relief
(Christy Sports, LLC v. Deer Valley Resort Co., 555 F.3d 1188 (10th Cir.
2009); Robbins v. Oklahoma, 519 F.3d 1242 (10th Cir. 2008)—noting Robbins
has been stated as overruled by Ayala v. New Mexico, but only to the extent
it conflicts with later Supreme Court precedent, which is not the case here).
Application to RICO Claims
To state a civil RICO claim, a plaintiff must allege, among other elements, a
“pattern of racketeering activity,” which requires at least two predicate acts

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
that are related and amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal
activity. The sufficiency of RICO allegations at the pleading stage is
governed by the same Rule 12(b)(6) standards.
In UMB Bank v. Monson, 21-CV-2504-EFM (D. Kan. Jun 04, 2025), the court
applied the Iqbal/Twombly standard to a RICO claim, holding that the
plaintiff’s detailed allegations of related predicate acts, including specific
communications and documentary evidence, were sufficient to state a
plausible claim. The court emphasized that the relationship and continuity
prongs of the RICO “pattern” element were adequately pled where the
complaint described related acts sharing participants, victims, and
purposes.
Analysis
The Court’s Duty to Accept Well-Pleaded Factual
Allegations as True
The authorities provided uniformly establish that, at the motion to dismiss
stage, the court must accept as true all well-pleaded factual allegations in
the complaint and draw all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff’s favor. This
principle is not limited to the Tenth Circuit but is a bedrock rule of federal
civil procedure, as articulated by the Supreme Court in Iqbal and Twombly
and consistently applied by the Tenth Circuit and district courts within its
jurisdiction.
The Supreme Court in Iqbal explained that, when evaluating a motion to
dismiss, courts must first identify and disregard conclusory allegations, but
must then assume the truth of all remaining factual allegations. The court’s
role is not to weigh evidence or assess the likelihood of the plaintiff’s
success, but to determine whether the factual allegations, if true, plausibly
entitle the plaintiff to relief (Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662 (2009); Twombly
and Iqbal: the latest retreat from notice pleading).
The Tenth Circuit has repeatedly reaffirmed this standard. In Brown v. City
of Tulsa, 124 F.4th 1251 (10th Cir. 2025), the court stated that all well-
pleaded factual allegations must be accepted as true and all reasonable
inferences drawn in the plaintiff’s favor. This approach is echoed in Brooks
v. Mentor Worldwide LLC, 985 F.3d 1272 (10th Cir. 2021), Bistline v. Parker,
918 F.3d 849 (10th Cir. 2019), and George v. Urban Settlement Servs., 833 F.
3d 1242 (10th Cir. 2016).
District courts within the Tenth Circuit have also consistently applied this
standard. For example, in Taylor v. Chesapeake Operating, Inc., Case No.
CIV-18-565-D (W.D. Okla. Nov 20, 2019), the court emphasized that it must
presume all of the plaintiff’s factual allegations are true and construe them
in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. Similarly, in Luttrell v. Brannon,
CASE NO. 2:17-CV-02137-HLT (D. Kan. Dec 17, 2018), the court reiterated
that the sufficiency of a complaint is tested by accepting all well-pleaded
factual allegations as true and determining whether they plausibly state a
claim for relief.

Application to RICO Allegations
The standard applies with particular force to RICO claims, which often
involve complex schemes and require detailed factual allegations regarding
the pattern, relationship, and continuity of predicate acts. In UMB Bank v.
Monson, 21-CV-2504-EFM (D. Kan. Jun 04, 2025), the court found that the
plaintiff’s allegations of multiple related predicate acts, supported by
specific facts and documentary evidence, were sufficient to state a plausible
RICO claim. The court explicitly rejected the defendants’ argument that the
allegations were insufficient, holding that the relationship prong of the RICO
pattern element was met where the acts shared participants, victims, and
purposes.
Similarly, in Watchous Enterprises, LLC v. Pac. Nat'l Capital, LLC, Case No.
16-1432-JTM (D. Kan. Jul 25, 2018), the court denied a motion to dismiss a
RICO claim where the complaint included particularized allegations of
communications and a common purpose among the defendants. The court
found that these detailed factual allegations, accepted as true, were
sufficient to present colorable RICO claims.
The District Court’s Error in Discounting Plaintiff’s
Allegations
The district court’s approach—discounting the plaintiff’s allegations
regarding the ongoing nature of the scheme and the relationship between
the acts—was inconsistent with the governing standard. The authorities
make clear that the court’s role at the pleading stage is not to weigh the
credibility of the allegations or to assess their likelihood, but to assume their
truth and determine whether, if true, they plausibly state a claim for relief.
The Supreme Court in Iqbal and Twombly, as well as the Tenth Circuit in
cases such as Brown v. City of Tulsa, 124 F.4th 1251 (10th Cir. 2025), Brooks
v. Mentor Worldwide LLC, 985 F.3d 1272 (10th Cir. 2021), and Hogan v.
Winder, 762 F.3d 1096 (10th Cir. 2014), have made clear that the plausibility
standard is not a probability requirement. The court must not dismiss a
complaint simply because the allegations seem improbable or because the
court doubts that the plaintiff will ultimately prevail (Robbins v. Oklahoma,
519 F.3d 1242 (10th Cir. 2008); but see below regarding subsequent
treatment).
The only exception is that legal conclusions, as opposed to factual
allegations, are not entitled to the assumption of truth. The court must
disregard conclusory statements and focus on the well-pleaded factual
content (Khalik v. United Air Lines, 671 F.3d 1188 (10th Cir. 2012); Kan.
Penn Gaming LLC v. Collins, 656 F.3d 1210 (10th Cir. 2011)).
The Role of Documentary Evidence and Specific
Communications
The presence of documentary evidence and specific communications in the
complaint further strengthens the sufficiency of the plaintiff’s allegations.

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Courts have recognized that detailed factual allegations, especially those
supported by documents or specific instances of conduct, are more likely to
satisfy the plausibility standard (Watchous Enterprises, LLC v. Pac. Nat'l
Capital, LLC, Case No. 16-1432-JTM (D. Kan. Jul 25, 2018)).
In the context of RICO, where the plaintiff alleges a pattern of racketeering
activity, the inclusion of specific facts regarding the timing, nature, and
purpose of the acts, as well as the relationships among the defendants, is
particularly important. Such allegations, if well-pleaded, must be accepted
as true and are sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss if they plausibly
suggest the existence of a RICO enterprise and a pattern of racketeering
activity (UMB Bank v. Monson, 21-CV-2504-EFM (D. Kan. Jun 04, 2025)).
The Impact of Robbins v. Oklahoma’s Subsequent
Treatment
It is important to note that Robbins v. Oklahoma, 519 F.3d 1242 (10th Cir.
2008) has been stated as overruled by Ayala v. New Mexico, 23-2013 (10th
Cir. May 11, 2023). However, the portions of Robbins relevant here—namely,
the requirement that courts accept all well-pleaded factual allegations as
true and not dismiss complaints simply because the allegations seem
improbable—are consistent with the Supreme Court’s subsequent decisions
in Iqbal and Twombly. The overruling in Ayala appears to address other
aspects of Robbins, not the core pleading standard, which remains good law
as articulated in later Supreme Court and Tenth Circuit cases. Therefore,
Robbins may still be cited for the proposition that plausibility does not mean
likelihood, and that courts must not dismiss complaints merely because the
allegations seem unlikely, so long as this is consistent with Iqbal and
Twombly.
Exceptions and Caveats
The only significant limitation to the rule that all well-pleaded factual
allegations must be accepted as true is that legal conclusions, or allegations
that are merely conclusory, are not entitled to the assumption of truth.
Courts must distinguish between factual allegations, which must be
credited, and legal conclusions, which may be disregarded (Ashcroft v. Iqbal,
556 U.S. 662 (2009); Khalik v. United Air Lines, 671 F.3d 1188 (10th Cir.
2012)).
Additionally, while the court must draw all reasonable inferences in the
plaintiff’s favor, it is not required to accept unreasonable inferences or
unwarranted deductions of fact. The complaint must contain enough factual
matter to suggest a plausible, not merely possible, entitlement to relief
(Christy Sports, LLC v. Deer Valley Resort Co., 555 F.3d 1188 (10th Cir.
2009)).

Conclusion
The prevailing federal standard, as established by the Supreme Court and
consistently applied by the Tenth Circuit, requires that on a motion to
dismiss, the court must accept all well-pleaded factual allegations in the
complaint as true and draw all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff’s favor.
This standard applies fully to civil RICO claims, where detailed allegations
regarding the timing, nature, and purpose of the defendants’ acts, supported
by documentary evidence and specific communications, must be credited at
the pleading stage. The district court’s failure to do so—by discounting the
plaintiff’s allegations regarding the ongoing nature of the scheme and the
relationship between the acts—was inconsistent with binding precedent. The
correct approach is to determine whether, assuming the truth of the
plaintiff’s factual allegations, the complaint plausibly states a claim for relief
under RICO. Any deviation from this standard constitutes reversible error.

U.S. District Court — District of New Mexico
Extract
When considering a 12(b)(6) motion, the Court must accept as true all well-
pled factual allegations in the complaint, view those allegations in the light
most favorable to the non-moving party, and draw all reasonable inferences
in the plaintiff's favor. ... To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must
contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief
that is plausible on its face. ... Accordingly, while the Court must take all of
the factual allegations in the complaint as true, 'a plaintiff armed with
nothing more than conclusions' cannot survive a motion to dismiss.
Summary
The passage emphasizes the standard for evaluating a motion to dismiss
under Rule 12(b)(6), which requires the court to accept all well-pleaded
factual allegations as true and to draw all reasonable inferences in favor of
the plaintiff. This aligns with the proposition that the district court should
not have discounted the plaintiff's allegations but instead should have
determined whether they plausibly state a claim for relief. The passage also
references the requirement for a complaint to contain sufficient factual
matter to state a plausible claim, which supports the need for detailed
factual allegations as mentioned in the proposition.

Robbins v. Oklahoma, 519 F.3d 1242 (10th Cir. 2008)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
The most difficult question in interpreting Twombly is what the Court means
by 'plausibility.' The Court states that the complaint must contain 'enough
facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.' Id. at 1974. But it
reiterates the bedrock principle that a judge ruling on a motion to dismiss
must accept all allegations as true and may not dismiss on the ground that it
appears unlikely the allegations can be proven. '[A] well-pleaded complaint
may proceed even if it strikes a savvy judge that actual proof of those facts
is improbable, and `that a recovery is very remote and unlikely.' Id. at 1965
(quoting Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U.S. 232, 236, 94 S.Ct. 1683, 40 L.Ed.2d 90
(1974)). Thus, 'plausible' cannot mean 'likely to be true.'
Summary
The passage from Robbins v. Oklahoma discusses the standard for
evaluating a motion to dismiss, emphasizing that a complaint must contain
enough factual allegations to state a plausible claim for relief. Importantly, it
reiterates that all allegations must be accepted as true, and a complaint
should not be dismissed merely because the allegations seem improbable.
This aligns with the proposition that the district court should have accepted
the plaintiff's allegations as true and assessed whether they plausibly stated
a claim under RICO.

We use the Iqbal/ Twombly standard to determine whether Plaintiffs have
stated a plausible claim. Brown v. Montoya, 662 F.3d 1152, 1162–63 (10th

Summary
The passage explicitly references the Iqbal/Twombly standard, which is
central to the proposition. It confirms that in the Tenth Circuit, courts must
accept well-pleaded facts as true and draw reasonable inferences in favor of
the plaintiff when determining the plausibility of a claim. This directly
supports the proposition that the district court should not have discounted
the plaintiff's allegations but instead should have accepted them as true to
assess their plausibility.

all well-pleaded factual allegations as true and determine whether they
plausibly state a claim for relief. This aligns with the proposition that the
district court must accept the plaintiff's allegations as true and draw
reasonable inferences in the plaintiff's favor. The reference to Ashcroft v.
Iqbal further supports this standard, emphasizing the need for the complaint
to contain sufficient factual matter to state a plausible claim.
Smith v. U.S., 561 F.3d 1090 (10th Cir. 2009)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
The legal sufficiency of a complaint is a question of law, and a Rule 12(b)(6)
dismissal is reviewed de novo. Moore v. Guthrie, 438 F.3d 1036, 1039 (10th
Cir.2006). Again, for purposes of resolving a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, we accept
as true all well-pleaded factual allegations in a complaint and view these
allegations in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. Id. 'The court's
function on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion is not to weigh potential evidence that
the parties might present at trial, but to assess whether the plaintiff's
complaint alone is legally sufficient to state a claim for which relief may be
granted.' Sutton v. Utah State Sch. for Deaf & Blind, 173 F.3d 1226, 1236
(10th Cir.1999) (internal quotation omitted).
Summary
The passage from "Smith v. U.S." reiterates the principle that, when
considering a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the court must accept all
well-pleaded factual allegations as true and view them in the light most

favorable to the plaintiff. This aligns with the proposition that the district
court should not have discounted the plaintiff's allegations but instead
should have accepted them as true to determine if they plausibly state a
claim for relief under RICO.
Hogan v. Winder, 762 F.3d 1096 (10th Cir. 2014)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
Hogan argues that the district court erred in dismissing his case. At this
stage in the litigation, we accept as true the well pleaded factual allegations
and then determine if the plaintiff has provided 'enough facts to state a
claim to relief that is plausible on its face.' Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550
U.S. 544, 547, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). 'A claim has facial
plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to
draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the
misconduct alleged.'
Summary
The passage from "Hogan v. Winder" emphasizes the standard for evaluating
a motion to dismiss, which requires the court to accept well-pleaded factual
allegations as true and assess whether they plausibly state a claim for relief.
This aligns with the proposition that the district court should not have
discounted the plaintiff's allegations but instead should have accepted them
as true to determine if they plausibly state a claim under RICO. The passage
supports the principle that detailed factual allegations should be taken as
true at the motion to dismiss stage, which is central to the proposition.
George v. Urban Settlement Servs., 833 F.3d 1242 (10th Cir. 2016)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
In determining the plausibility of a claim, we look to the elements of the
particular cause of action, keeping in mind that the Rule 12(b)(6) standard
doesn’t require a plaintiff to “set forth a prima facie case for each element.”
Khalik v. United Air Lines, 671 F.3d 1188, 1192–93 (10th Cir. 2012). See also
Kan. Penn Gaming, LLC v. Collins, 656 F.3d 1210, 1215 (10th Cir. 2011)
(noting that “[t]he nature and specificity of the allegations required to state
a plausible claim will vary based on context”). Rather, a claim is facially
plausible if the plaintiff has pled “factual content that allows the court to
draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the
misconduct alleged.”

=== PAGE 14 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
The passage emphasizes that in determining the plausibility of a claim, the
court must consider the elements of the cause of action and that the Rule
12(b)(6) standard does not require a prima facie case for each element.
Instead, the claim must be facially plausible, meaning the plaintiff has
provided factual content that allows the court to reasonably infer liability.
This supports the proposition that the district court should accept well-
pleaded factual allegations as true and draw reasonable inferences in the
plaintiff's favor, rather than discounting them.
UMB Bank v. Monson, 21-CV-2504-EFM (D. Kan. Jun 04, 2025)
U.S. District Court — District of Kansas
Extract
Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), a defendant may move for
dismissal of any claim for which the plaintiff has failed to state a claim upon
which relief can be granted.[] Upon such motion, the court must decide
'whether the complaint contains ‘enough facts to state a claim to relief that
is plausible on its face.'[] A claim is facially plausible if the plaintiff pleads
facts sufficient for the court to reasonably infer that the defendant is liable
for the alleged misconduct.[] 'The elements of each alleged cause of action
help to determine whether [the p]laintiff has set forth a plausible claim.'[] ...
The RICO Defendants argue that UMB has failed to plausibly allege every
element of a civil RICO claim with the requisite particularity. In contrast,
UMB claims that, at this stage in the litigation, it has alleged the RICO
elements sufficiently to avoid dismissal. ... To state a 'pattern' of
racketeering activity, the plaintiff must allege 'at least two acts of
racketeering activity. .. which occurred within ten years.'[] Moreover, 'a
RICO pattern requires that the racketeering predicates relate to each other
and amount to a threat of continued racketeering activity. No pattern exists
without this ‘continuity plus relationship.'[] ... Here, UMB alleges that the
RICO Defendants engaged in several related predicate acts- specifically wire
fraud and financial institution fraud, which are recognized as racketeering
activities under the statute.[] Specifically, UMB alleges that the RICO
Defendants devised and implemented a complex scheme amongst
themselves to defraud UMB (and the Prior Trustee) of project funds and
revenue, and fraudulently transfer the Project's property, based on false and
fraudulent pretenses, representations and promises, and concealment or
omission of material facts. These allegations contain at least two predicate
acts which happened within ten years of each other, and they are sufficiently
related given that they share the same participants and victims and
accomplish similar purposes. As such, the Court finds that UMB has
adequately pled the relationship prong of the pattern element.

Summary
Standard for evaluating a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6),
emphasizing that the court must determine if the complaint contains enough
facts to state a plausible claim. It also highlights the requirement for a RICO
claim to allege a pattern of racketeering activity, which involves related
predicate acts and continuity. The court in this case found that UMB's
allegations were sufficient to meet these requirements, supporting the
proposition that well-pleaded allegations must be accepted as true and
evaluated for plausibility.
Watchous Enterprrises, LLC v. Pac. Nat'l Capital, LLC, Case No. 16-1432-
JTM (D. Kan. Jul 25, 2018)
U.S. District Court — District of Kansas
Extract
The court hereby grants leave for the filing of the Second Amended
Complaint. The proposed complaint pleads with particularity the
communications underlying the alleged fraud. ... Second, the proposed
Second Amended Complaint adequately identifies the defendants' common
purpose (inducing Watchous to provide funds). ... In pursuit of this common
goal, the Second Amended Complaint makes specific allegations about the
interrelationships among the individual defendants and the Pacific and
Waterfall corporate entities. ... However, the court finds the defendants'
motion to dismiss should be denied. ... the court has found that plaintiff's
claims present colorable claims under RICO, prefaced on specific allegations
of predicate acts of wire fraud by the named defendants. Accordingly, the
court will deny the defendants' request to dismiss these claims.
Summary
The court accepted the detailed factual allegations in the complaint,
including specific communications and the common purpose of the
defendants, as sufficient to state a RICO claim. The court denied the motion
to dismiss, emphasizing that the complaint presented colorable claims under
RICO based on specific allegations of predicate acts. This aligns with the
proposition that on a motion to dismiss, the court must accept well-pleaded
allegations as true and assess whether they plausibly state a claim.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
The sufficiency of a complaint is a question of law, and when considering
and addressing a rule 12(b)(6) motion, a court must accept as true all well-
pleaded factual allegations in the complaint, and view those allegations in
the light most favorable to the non-moving party and draw all reasonable
inferences in the plaintiff's favor.
Summary
The passage from the Advanced Optics Electronics, Inc. v. Robins case
reiterates the standard for evaluating a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)
(6). It emphasizes that the court must accept all well-pleaded factual
allegations as true and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the
plaintiff. This directly supports the proposition that the district court should
not have discounted the plaintiff's allegations regarding the ongoing nature
of the scheme and the relationship between the acts, but rather should have
accepted them as true to determine if they plausibly state a claim for relief
under RICO.

Empl.Prac.Cas. (BNA) 500, 671 F.3d 1188 (10th Cir. 2012)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2), a pleading must contain 'a
short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to
relief.' Recently, the Supreme Court clarified this pleading standard in Bell
Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929
(2007), and Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868
(2009): to withstand a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, a complaint must
contain enough allegations of fact, taken as true, 'to state a claim to relief
that is plausible on its face.' ... The Court explained two principles
underlying the new standard: (1) when legal conclusions are involved in the
complaint 'the tenet that a court must accept as true all of the allegations
contained in a complaint is inapplicable to [those] conclusions,' Iqbal, 129
S.Ct. at 1949, and (2) 'only a complaint that states a plausible claim for relief
survives a motion to dismiss,' id. at 1950.
Summary
Standard for evaluating a motion to dismiss, emphasizing that factual
allegations in a complaint must be accepted as true and that the complaint
must state a plausible claim for relief. This aligns with the proposition that
the court must accept well-pleaded factual allegations as true and draw
reasonable inferences in the plaintiff's favor. The passage also highlights

that legal conclusions are not entitled to the assumption of truth, which is
consistent with the proposition's focus on factual allegations.
Christy Sports, LLC v. Deer Valley Resort Co., 555 F.3d 1188 (10th Cir. 2009)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
The concept of 'plausibility' at the dismissal stage refers not to whether the
allegations are likely to be true; the court must assume them to be true. The
question is whether, if the allegations are true, it is plausible and not merely
possible that the plaintiff is entitled to relief under the relevant law.
Summary
The passage emphasizes that at the dismissal stage, the court must assume
the allegations in the complaint to be true and determine whether they
plausibly entitle the plaintiff to relief. This aligns with the proposition that
the court must accept well-pleaded factual allegations as true and draw
reasonable inferences in the plaintiff's favor. The passage supports the idea
that the district court should not have discounted the plaintiff's allegations
but instead should have assessed their plausibility.

dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) in Bell Atl. Corp. v.
Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007) and Ashcroft
v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009). ... In its
place, the Court articulated a new, further refined standard: to withstand a
motion to dismiss, a complaint must have enough allegations of fact, taken
as true, 'to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.' ... First, 'the
tenet that a court must accept as true all of the allegations contained in a
complaint is inapplicable to legal conclusions.' ... And second, 'only a
complaint that states a plausible claim for relief survives a motion to
dismiss.' ... Thus, in ruling on a motion to dismiss, a court should disregard
all conclusory statements of law and consider whether the remaining
specific factual allegations, if assumed to be true, plausibly suggest the
defendant is liable.

Summary
Standard for evaluating a motion to dismiss, emphasizing that courts must
accept all factual allegations as true and determine if they plausibly suggest

Summary
The passage from "Brown v. Montoya" reiterates the standard for reviewing
a motion to dismiss, which is consistent with the proposition. It emphasizes
that all well-pleaded factual allegations must be accepted as true and

Summary
The passage from Ashcroft v. Iqbal establishes that for a complaint to
survive a motion to dismiss, it must contain sufficient factual matter that,
when accepted as true, states a plausible claim for relief. This aligns with
the proposition that the court must accept all well-pleaded factual
allegations as true and draw reasonable inferences in the plaintiff's favor.

Extract
Thus, whether the 'facts' at issue appear in the form of allegations (as they
would under Rule 12(b)(6)), 'paper' evidence--e.g., affidavits and certain
discovery responses--(as they would under Rule 56), or evidence admitted at
trial (as they would under Rule 50), the question at each juncture seemingly
should be whether a reasonable juror could find in favor of the plaintiff.
Such a standard also would not seem to be particularly onerous, in that the
district court is required to assume that all of the plaintiff's factual (or
nonconclusory) allegations are true. ... Rather: 'A claim has facial plausibility
when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the
reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.'
Thus, '[w]hen there are well-pleaded factual allegations, a court should
assume their veracity and then determine whether they plausibly give rise to
an entitlement to relief.'
Summary
The passage discusses the standard for evaluating a motion to dismiss under
Rule 12(b)(6). It emphasizes that the court must assume the truth of the
plaintiff's factual allegations and determine whether they plausibly suggest
entitlement to relief. This aligns with the proposition that the district court
should not have discounted the plaintiff's allegations but rather accepted
them as true to assess their plausibility.
Twombly and Iqbal: the latest retreat from notice pleading.
Suffolk University Law Review - Suffolk University Law School -
Sullivan, John P. - 2010-01-01

=== PAGE 20 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
The Court outlined a two-pronged approach for trial courts to follow in
measuring the adequacy of a complaint in the face of a motion to dismiss.
(21) First, the court can begin by identifying pleadings that, because they
are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth.
(22) After isolating the 'well-pleaded factual allegations' in the complaint
and assuming 'their veracity,' the court should 'then determine whether they
plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.' (23)
Summary
The passage from the Suffolk University Law Review explains the two-
pronged approach established by the Supreme Court in Twombly and Iqbal
for evaluating the adequacy of a complaint. This approach requires courts to
first identify and disregard mere legal conclusions, then accept well-pleaded
factual allegations as true, and finally determine if these facts plausibly
suggest an entitlement to relief. This directly supports the proposition that a
court must accept well-pleaded factual allegations as true and draw
reasonable inferences in the plaintiff's favor when considering a motion to
dismiss.

Extract
Significantly, this is how the Iqbal Court understood the plausibility
requirement. It explained that a 'claim has facial plausibility when the
plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable
inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.' Moreover,
it reiterated that 'the tenet that a court must... can provide the framework of
a complaint, they must be supported by factual allegations. When there are
well-pleaded factual allegations, a court should assume their veracity and
then determine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.'
Summary
The Iqbal decision emphasizes the need for factual allegations to be
accepted as true when determining the plausibility of a claim. This supports
the proposition that the district court should have accepted the plaintiff's
well-pleaded factual allegations as true and assessed whether they plausibly
state a claim for relief.

Ashcroft v. Iqbal 556 U.S. 662 (2009), extends Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly,
550 U.S. 544 (2007), sufficiently far that the author of Twombly (Souter, J.)
dissented. At its simplest, Iqbal sets out a two-part approach for analyzing a
complaint on Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal motion: • First, the court reviews the
complaint to identify—and disregard—conclusory allegations (“pleadings
that . . . are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of
truth”). 556 U.S. at 679. • Second, accepting as true the remaining
allegations, the court decides whether, in context, the claim is plausible as a
matter of “common sense” (“Determining whether a complaint states a
plausible claim for relief will . . . be a context-specific task that requires the
reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.”). Id.
at 679.
Summary
Two-part approach established by Ashcroft v. Iqbal for analyzing complaints
under Rule 12(b)(6). It emphasizes that courts must accept as true all non-
conclusory factual allegations and determine whether they plausibly state a
claim for relief. This directly supports the proposition that the district court
should have accepted the plaintiff's detailed factual allegations as true and
assessed their plausibility.
'Plausible' Deniability
Litigation - American Bar Association - Michael J. Miarmi -
2021-01-01
Extract
The Court instructed, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter to
render the claim 'plausible.' The Court did not provide much guidance on
what 'plausibility' entails, but it did offer a few observations: On the one
hand, 'detailed factual allegations' are not required, and the court must
'assum[e] that all the allegations in the complaint are true (even if doubtful
in fact).' Indeed, the Court noted, 'a well-pleaded complaint may proceed
even if it strikes a savvy judge that actual proof of th[e] [alleged] facts is
improbable, and that a recovery is very remote and unlikely.'
Summary
The Supreme Court's decisions in Twombly and Iqbal require that a
complaint must contain sufficient factual matter to render the claim
plausible. The court must assume all allegations in the complaint are true,
even if they seem improbable. This supports the proposition that the district

court should not have discounted the plaintiff's allegations but should have
accepted them as true to determine if they plausibly state a claim for relief.

Extract
The Court explained that by insisting that a complaint allege 'plausible
grounds to infer an agreement,' it was not imposing a probability
requirement at the pleading stage. The plausibility standard 'simply calls for
enough fact[s] to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal
evidence of illegal agreement.' The Court concluded by stating that 'we do
not require heightened fact pleading of specifics, but only enough facts to
state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.'
Summary
Standard for pleading a claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2),
as articulated in Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly. It emphasizes that a
complaint must contain enough factual matter to suggest a plausible claim,
without requiring detailed fact pleading. This aligns with the proposition
that the court must accept well-pleaded factual allegations as true and draw
reasonable inferences in the plaintiff's favor, which is relevant to the
standard applied in motions to dismiss.
