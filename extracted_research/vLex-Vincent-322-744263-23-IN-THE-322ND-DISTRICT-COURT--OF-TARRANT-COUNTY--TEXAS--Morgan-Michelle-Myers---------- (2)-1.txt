Question
322-744263-23 IN THE 322ND DISTRICT COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY,
TEXAS Morgan Michelle Myers, Petitioner, v. Charles Dustin Myers,
Respondent. And In the interest of M.E.M. and C.R.M., two children. § § § § §
MOTION TO RECUSE § § § § TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF THIS
COURT: COMES NOW, Respondent, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, who
respectfully submits this Motion to Recuse, and in support thereof, shows
the Court the following: I. INTRODUCTION 1. There exists no excuse, nor
any law or reasoning that could justify the events that have transpired
throughout this case. Respondent notes that this is the third recusal motion
filed in this matter, making it a tertiary recusal pursuant to Tex. Gov’t. Code
§ 25.00256. The term includes any third or subsequent motion filed in the
case by the same party, regardless of whether that motion is filed against a
different judge than the judge or judges against whom the previous motions
for recusal or disqualification were filed. 2. In practice, and pursuant to the
statute, this gives Honorable James Munford the ability to move the case to
final disposition as though a tertiary recusal motion had not been filed.
However, I urge this court to pay close attention for the forthcoming
reasons: *All docket references herein are market with DKT followed by the
corresponding number. 3. Respondent, on day one, was divested of his
property, his children, and his normal place of business. DKT 19. 4. The
Petitioner, Morgan Michelle Myers, was allowed to approach this Court,
submit facially fraudulent pleadings, and walk away with full custody and
sole use of the residency before anything was ever adjudicated. She was
permitted to falsify her indigency, claim abuse, and fabricate an emergency
when the record before this court has held the truth, and remains
unopposed. DKT 1, 3, 5 & 27. 5. The Respondent has provided this Court,
the Second Court of Appeals, the Texas Supreme Court, the State
Commission on Judicial Conduct, the State Bar of Texas, and the Office of
the Attorney General with every possible opportunity to correct this
situation, and each body has refused to do so. He has not received one
argument, not one explanation, and not one justification for what has
transpired. DKT passim. 6. Now, while the reviewer may pause here and
claim this motion is meritless, the reality of this situation is that after careful
review of the record, the fact pattern of this case, and after receiving not a
single response in any of the six appellate cases from any implicated judge
on appeal, and with zero sum participation from the other side of the table,
the record facially establishes that Honorable James Munford, Honorable
Jeff Kaitcer, Court Coordinator Lindsey Baker, opposing attorney Cooper L.
Carter, and Petitioner Morgan Michelle Myers, collectively, have exhbited
conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. 7.
Accordingly, absent any swift corrective action, Honorable James Munford
must recuse himself from this matter, which is supported by the forthcoming
facts found in the record: II. RECUSAL STANDARDS AND PROCEDURE 8.
Texas appellate courts have consistently held that recusal is mandatory—not
discretionary—when a judge’s impartiality might reasonably be questioned
(Ex parte Thuesen, 546 S.W.3d 145 (Tex. Crim. App. 2017)). The test is
whether a reasonable member of the public, knowing all the facts, would
have a reasonable doubt about the judge’s impartiality (Rodriguez v.

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Newton, NUMBER 13-19-00309-CV (Tex. App. Jul 16, 2020); In re Moore,
NUMBER 13-19-00551-CV (Tex. App. Oct 30, 2019); Johnson-Todd v.
Morgan, NO. 09-17-00168-CV, NO. 09-17-00194-CV (Tex. App. Dec 20,
2018); Kniatt v. State, 239 S.W.3d 910 (Tex. App. 2007); Sears v. Nueces
County Sherriff Olivarez, 28 S.W.3d 611 (Tex. App. 2000)). This standard is
applied regardless of whether actual bias exists; the appearance of bias is
sufficient. 9. When a recusal motion is filed, the judge must either recuse
themselves or refer the motion to another judge for decision; the challenged
judge cannot unilaterally determine the sufficiency of the allegations (De
Leon v. Aguilar, 127 S.W.3d 1 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004)). 10. A federal lawsuit
against a judge, particularly one alleging conspiracy with a party in a RICO
action, creates an immediate and substantial conflict of interest that
requires the judge’s prompt recusal from presiding over this matter, because
the judge’s impartiality would reasonably be questioned under both
constitutional and statutory standards. The integrity of the judicial process
and the appearance of fairness demand recusal in such circumstances to
preserve public confidence and due process, which has already been tainted
by these proceedings. 11. The Texas Constitution provides a foundational
rule: no judge may preside over a case in which they have an interest, or
where there is a connection to the parties by affinity, consanguinity, or prior
involvement as counsel (Tex. Const. art. 5 § 11). This constitutional mandate
is echoed and elaborated in the Texas Government Code, which requires a
judge to recuse themselves and request assignment of another judge if they
are disqualified or should otherwise recuse (Tex. Gov't. Code § 24.002). The
Texas Government Code also provides mechanisms for parties to object to a
judge’s assignment in civil cases, including divorce, and mandates recusal
upon timely objection (Tex. Gov't. Code § 74.053). 12. Administrative
regulations reinforce these requirements, specifying that a judge is subject
to recusal or disqualification on the same grounds as set out in Texas Rule of
Civil Procedure 18b, and that motions to recuse must be made promptly and
supported by admissible facts (1 Tex. Admin. Code § 155.152). 13. The law is
clear that the appearance of impropriety is as damaging as actual
impropriety. The Code of Judicial Conduct and the Texas Supreme Court
have emphasized that judges must avoid situations where their impartiality
might reasonably be questioned, as public confidence in the judiciary
depends on the perception of fairness and neutrality (State v. Volkswagen
Aktiengesellschaft, 692 S.W.3d 467 (Tex. 2022); In re Moore, NUMBER
13-19-00551-CV (Tex. App. Oct 30, 2019)). 15. Allegations of conspiracy
under RICO are not mere accusations of bias or error; they are claims of
criminal conduct and collusion with a party. This elevates the conflict of
interest to an extraordinary level, making it virtually impossible for the
judge to preside without undermining the legitimacy of the proceedings. The
public, and the parties, would have every reason to doubt the judge’s
impartiality, and the law requires recusal in such circumstances (Rodriguez
v. Cantu (In re Rodriguez), NUMBER 13-19-00230-CV, NUMBER
13-19-00254-CV (Tex. App. Jun 25, 2019); Johnson-Todd v. Morgan, NO.
09-17-00168-CV, NO. 09-17-00194-CV (Tex. App. Dec 20, 2018)). 16. Absent
corrective action, immediate recusal is warranted, supported by the
following: III. GROUNDS FOR RECUSAL A. WIRE FRAUD 8. On October 7,
2024, Respondent filed a joint motion to recuse District Judge James
Munford and Associate Judge Jeffrey Kaitcer through the electronic filing
manager, serving all parties with one hyperlinked document containing all

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
exhibits and notarized affidavits (DKT NO. 227). This recusal was filed in
good faith after all appellate efforts were denied without explanation. See
Cause No. 24-0395. 9. On October 8, 2024, at 4:43 PM, correspondence was
received from Court Coordinator Lindsey Baker regarding an order of
referral and ruling letter transmitted by District Judge James Munford to
Regional Presiding Judge David L. Evans, declining to recuse himself from
this matter (DKT NOS. 228-229). This email contained an unoriginal,
modified version of the joint motion to recuse submitted to re:Search Texas
by the Respondent, and was missing the exhibits and the affidavit. 10. By
CC’ing this email to coopercarter@majadmin.com on October 8, 2024,
District Judge James Munford, through his court coordinator, relied on
interstate wire communications because majadmin.com can be traced to the
IP address 74.208.236.18, which IP Geolocation places in Kansas City, at
coordinates 39.0997,-94.5786. Combined with the intentional alteration of
the pleading to withhold material exhibits/affidavit to influence the recusal
outcome, the transmission constitutes wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343,
thereby supplying a RICO predicate act under 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1),
committed by both Lindsey Baker and District Judge James Munford. At
minimum, these facts plausibly allege the interstate-wire and fraud elements
of this claim are supported by admissible evidence, that if true, would
warrant his immediate recusal, and no further involvement from the Court
Coordinator absent any swift corrective action. B. WIRE FRAUD – COUNT
TWO 11. On October 10, 2024, court coordinator Lindsey Baker transmitted
an “Amended Order of Referral” at 11:17 AM and a second judge’s ruling
letter. (DKT 232, 233) This transmission relied on the same interstate wires
mentioned above. 12. The original motion was once again modified, this time
split into three separate files “due to the size of the motion” which was well
under the 35mb limit allotted from the efile Texas platform, with hyperlinks
removed, affecting its’ readability. 13. When Respondent pointed these
issues out, Baker confirmed the pleading had been e-filed and the full
document was in the court's possession (DKT NOS. 230-231 see Exhibits)
showing that there was no plausible reason to modify them. C. FAILURE TO
FOLLOW MANDATORY RECUSAL PROCEDURES 14. The primary
legislative and regulatory authorities governing the handling of recusal
motions in Texas are Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a and various
provisions of the Texas Government Code, including sections 25.00256,
29.055, and 74.059(c)(3). 15. Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a sets out the
exclusive procedure for recusal or disqualification of judges in civil cases.
Upon the filing of a recusal motion, the rule requires the respondent judge,
within three business days, to either recuse themselves or refer the motion
to the regional presiding judge. The rule further mandates that the judge
must take no further action in the case until the motion is resolved, except
for good cause stated in writing or on the record. 16. Texas Government
Code § 25.00256 (and related provisions such as § 29.055 and § 74.059(c)
(3)) reinforce these requirements, specifying that the judge must forward
the motion and all related documents in their original form or as certified
copies to the presiding judge, and may not take further action in the case
until the recusal motion is resolved. 17. Here, modified versions were
transmitted, notably missing critical elements such as the notarized affidavit
and exhibits showing a long list of misconduct that remains unaddressed to
this day. Notwithstanding the federal allegations above, there is a
continuous pattern showing that the law is being willfully disregarded by

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
these individuals, and enabled by the Regional Presiding Judge, who has
permitted rulings on non-existent motions, and the continued involvement of
Baker despite clear ambiguities surrounding the prior two recusal
proceedings. 18. Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a and Texas Government
Code § 29.055 both require the forwarding of the motion and all related
documents in their original or certified form. The use of the term “all” and
the requirement for original or certified copies preclude any alteration,
omission, or selective transmission. This is further reinforced by case law,
which consistently holds that the judge’s only permissible actions are
recusal or referral, and that any other action—including any manipulation of
the motion or its exhibits—is outside the scope of the judge’s authority (In re
Gold, 04-25-00085-CV (Tex. App. May 07, 2025); In re Norman, 191 S.W.3d
858 (Tex. App. 2006); Carson v. Gomez, 841 S.W.2d 491 (Tex. App. 1992)). IV.
ETHICS 19. The ethical consequences of the allegations are significant. The
Texas Code of Judicial Conduct requires judges to comply with the law and
maintain professional competence. In In re Inquiry Concerning Honorable
Bonnie Rangel (677 S.W.3d 918, Tex. 2023), the Texas Supreme Court
publicly admonished a judge for filing a response to a recusal motion, which
is expressly prohibited by Rule 18a. The Court found that this single act
demonstrated a lack of competence in the law and a failure to comply with
legal requirements, violating Canons 2A and 3B(2). 20. By analogy, in this
case, a staff member who serves at the pleasure of the Judge facing recusal
was permitted to transmit non-original copies a government document
through the use of interstate wires when the law clearly prohibits such
behavior. 21. Furthermore, these actions are not isolated but build upon a
growing pattern of misconduct in furtherance of a broader scheme initiated
by Petitioner Morgan Michelle Myers. V. PURSUIT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS
22. The actions alleged herein are part of a larger, broader scheme to
defraud the Respondent of his business and property, and this Recusal
serves as both a notice to any individual reading this brief that the law is not
optional. Whether a judge, an attorney, a clerk, or a coordinator – the law is
not below you. 23. In this case, several individuals have chosen to disregard
the law, put their political interests and bias before the Children and laws of
this State, and have inadvertently assisted the Petitioner, Morgan Michelle
Myers, in an elaborate scheme to defraud the Respondent of business and
property of which affects interstate commerce currently being litigated in
the Western District of Oklahoma. VI. CONCLUSIONS 24. For these reasons,
Judge James Munford should be immediately recused, or in the alternative,
correct the mistakes that have remained unaddressed for two years and
remain unopposed on the face of the record. 25. The record is clear: this is a
one sided case, with a one sided outcome, and despite having every reason
to correct the errors in the face of no opposition, this Court has chosen to
disregard the law, ethical standards, and has committed several predicate
acts in the process which will be outlined in more detail if the subsequent
federal action must be brought. 26. Nevertheless, the facts plead herein
support recusal, as any member of the public knowing all of the facts of this
case would clearly doubt it was conducted in an impartial manner. VI.
PRAYER WHEREFORE, all premises considered, Respondent prays that the
court: 1. Grant this motion to recuse, or in the alternative, provide
corrective action to remedy the injustice faced by the Respondent; 2.
Prevent any involvement from Court Coordinator Lindsey Baker; 3. Provide
any further relief that this Court deems equitable and just based on these

District Judge James Munford and Associate Judge Jeffrey Kaitcer through
the electronic filing manager, serving all parties with a single document
containing all exhibits and a notarized affidavit. 3. On October 8, 2024, I
received correspondence from Court Coordinator Lindsey Baker regarding
an order of referral and ruling letter transmitted by Judge Munford to
Regional Presiding Judge David L. Evans. The email contained a modified
version of my joint motion to recuse, which was missing the exhibits and
affidavit that I had originally submitted. 4. On October 10, 2024, Ms. Baker
transmitted an “Amended Order of Referral” and a second judge’s ruling
letter. The original motion was again modified, split into three separate files,
and hyperlinks were removed, affecting its readability. The size of the
original document was well under the 35MB limit for e-filing. 5. When I
raised these issues with Ms. Baker, she confirmed that the full document
was in the court’s possession, and there was no plausible reason for the
modifications. 6. I believe that these actions, including the alteration and
selective transmission of my filings, have affected the integrity of the recusal
process and raise reasonable questions about the impartiality of Judge
Munford in this case and are based on my personal knowledge and believe,
and is supported by admissible evidence on the face of the record. 7. Based
on these facts, I respectfully request that Judge Munford recuse himself
from this matter. Further affiant sayeth not. _______________ /s/ Charles

SE How is this recusal motion? It's not conclusory.. it literally gives DKT
references to each allegation
Answer (Texas)
Short response
The recusal motion filed by Charles Dustin Myers is not conclusory; it
provides detailed, particularized allegations supported by docket references
and an affidavit, meeting the procedural and substantive requirements for a
recusal motion under Texas law. However, as a tertiary recusal motion, its

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
practical effect is limited by statute, and the judge may proceed with the
case unless the motion is ultimately sustained.
Summary
Under Texas law, a motion to recuse a judge must be verified, state grounds
with particularity, and be supported by admissible facts within the movant’s
personal knowledge. The motion in question satisfies these requirements by
referencing specific docket entries, providing a sworn affidavit, and
articulating the factual basis for the alleged bias and procedural
irregularities.
Nevertheless, because this is the third recusal motion filed by the same
party (a "tertiary recusal motion"), Texas statutes allow the judge to
continue presiding over the case and moving it to final disposition as if the
motion had not been filed, unless and until the motion is sustained. The
motion’s detailed factual allegations and compliance with procedural rules
mean it cannot be dismissed as conclusory, but its ultimate success depends
on whether an assigned judge (if referral occurs) finds that a reasonable
person would doubt the judge’s impartiality based on the facts presented.
Background and Relevant Law
Legislative and Regulatory Framework
Texas law provides a comprehensive framework for judicial recusal. The
Texas Constitution prohibits a judge from sitting in any case where the judge
has a personal interest, is related to a party, or has previously served as
counsel in the matter (Tex. Const. art. 5 § 11). Statutory law further details
the procedures and grounds for recusal:
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a (as referenced in the case law and
secondary materials) sets out the exclusive procedure for recusal or
disqualification of judges in civil cases. It requires that a motion to
recuse be verified, state grounds with particularity, and be based on
admissible facts within the movant’s personal knowledge (In re G. S.,
No. 02-19-00390-CV (Tex. App. Mar 19, 2020); 1 Tex. Admin. Code §
155.152).
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18b provides that a judge must recuse
themselves if their impartiality might reasonably be questioned or if
they have a personal bias or prejudice concerning the subject matter or
a party (State v. Volkswagen Aktiengesellschaft, 692 S.W.3d 467 (Tex.
2022); Guillen v. Cameron Cnty., NUMBER 13-16-00682-CV (Tex. App.
Nov 15, 2018)).
Texas Government Code § 74.059 and § 24.002 require a judge,
upon the filing of a recusal motion, to either recuse themselves or refer
the motion to the presiding judge of the administrative judicial region,
and to take no further action in the case except for good cause stated in
writing (Tex. Gov't. Code § 74.059; Tex. Gov't. Code § 24.002).

Texas Government Code § 25.00256 and Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.
Code § 30.016 address "tertiary recusal motions" (the third or
subsequent recusal motion by the same party), providing that the judge
may continue to preside over the case and move it to final disposition as
if the motion had not been filed, unless the motion is sustained (Tex.
Gov't. Code § 25.00256; Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 30.016).
1 Tex. Admin. Code § 155.152 reiterates that a motion to recuse must
be made at the earliest practicable time, be verified, state grounds with
particularity, and be based on personal knowledge and admissible facts.
Case Law
Texas appellate courts have consistently held that recusal is mandatory
when a judge’s impartiality might reasonably be questioned, applying an
objective standard: whether a reasonable member of the public, knowing all
the facts, would doubt the judge’s impartiality (Kniatt v. State, 239 S.W.3d
910 (Tex. App. 2007); Sears v. Nueces County Sherriff Olivarez, 28 S.W.3d
611 (Tex. App. 2000); Ex Parte Ellis, 275 S.W.3d 109 (Tex. App. 2008)). The
judge must either recuse themselves or refer the motion to another judge for
decision; they cannot unilaterally determine the sufficiency of the
allegations (De Leon v. Aguilar, 127 S.W.3d 1 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004); In re
Norman, 191 S.W.3d 858 (Tex. App. 2006); Carson v. Gomez, 841 S.W.2d 491
(Tex. App. 1992)).
A motion to recuse must not be based solely on the judge’s rulings in the
case and must state facts with detail and particularity that, if proven, would
be sufficient to justify recusal (In re G. S., No. 02-19-00390-CV (Tex. App.
Mar 19, 2020)). The Texas Supreme Court has also emphasized that the
appearance of impropriety is as damaging as actual impropriety (State v.
Volkswagen Aktiengesellschaft, 692 S.W.3d 467 (Tex. 2022)).
If a recusal motion is not verified or does not meet the minimum
requirements of form, the judge may determine that the mandatory referral
and hearing provisions are not triggered (Moorhead v. State, 972 S.W.2d 93
(Tex. App. 1998)).
Tertiary Recusal Motions
When a party files a third or subsequent recusal motion in the same case,
Texas law provides that the judge may continue to preside, sign orders, and
move the case to final disposition as if the motion had not been filed, unless
the motion is ultimately sustained (Tex. Gov't. Code § 25.00256; Tex. Civ.
Prac. & Rem. Code § 30.016). The denial of a tertiary recusal motion is only
reviewable on appeal from final judgment.

Analysis
Sufficiency and Non-Conclusory Nature of the Motion
The recusal motion filed by Charles Dustin Myers is not conclusory. It is
verified by affidavit, as required by Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a and 1
Tex. Admin. Code § 155.152. The motion states its grounds with
particularity, referencing specific docket entries (DKT numbers) and
providing a detailed factual narrative. The supporting affidavit attests to the
facts within the affiant’s personal knowledge, further satisfying the
requirement that the motion be based on admissible evidence (In re G. S.,
No. 02-19-00390-CV (Tex. App. Mar 19, 2020); 1 Tex. Admin. Code §
155.152).
Texas courts have held that a motion to recuse must assert one or more of
the grounds listed in Rule 18b, must not be based solely on the judge’s
rulings, and must state facts with detail and particularity that, if proven,
would be sufficient to justify recusal (In re G. S., No. 02-19-00390-CV (Tex.
App. Mar 19, 2020)). The motion here alleges not only bias and impropriety
but also specific procedural irregularities, such as the alleged alteration and
selective transmission of filings, and references to federal claims of wire
fraud and RICO predicate acts. While the ultimate merits of these
allegations are for another judge to determine (if the motion is referred), the
motion itself is not conclusory under Texas law.
The inclusion of DKT references and a sworn affidavit aligns with the
requirement that each allegation or factual contention in a pleading must
have, or be likely to have, evidentiary support after reasonable investigation
(Low v. Henry, 221 S.W.3d 609 (Tex. 2007)). The motion’s structure and
content are consistent with the standards articulated in both the rules and
the case law.
Procedural Handling of the Motion
Upon the filing of a recusal motion, the judge must either recuse themselves
or refer the motion to the presiding judge of the administrative judicial
region (De Leon v. Aguilar, 127 S.W.3d 1 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004); In re
Norman, 191 S.W.3d 858 (Tex. App. 2006); Carson v. Gomez, 841 S.W.2d 491
(Tex. App. 1992)). The judge cannot unilaterally determine the sufficiency of
the allegations or take further action in the case, except for good cause
stated in writing (Tex. Gov't. Code § 74.059; Tex. Gov't. Code § 24.002). This
is a mandatory, not discretionary, requirement.
However, because this is a tertiary recusal motion, the judge is permitted by
statute to continue presiding over the case and moving it to final disposition
as if the motion had not been filed, unless the motion is ultimately sustained
(Tex. Gov't. Code § 25.00256; Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 30.016). The
denial of such a motion is only reviewable on appeal from the final
judgment.

Substantive Standard for Recusal
The substantive standard for recusal is whether a reasonable member of the
public, knowing all the facts, would have a reasonable doubt about the
judge’s impartiality (Kniatt v. State, 239 S.W.3d 910 (Tex. App. 2007); Sears
v. Nueces County Sherriff Olivarez, 28 S.W.3d 611 (Tex. App. 2000)). The
appearance of bias or impropriety is sufficient; actual bias need not be
shown (State v. Volkswagen Aktiengesellschaft, 692 S.W.3d 467 (Tex. 2022)).
The motion alleges a pattern of conduct, including the alteration and
selective transmission of filings, which, if proven, could raise questions
about impartiality.
However, Texas law also makes clear that adverse rulings alone are not
grounds for recusal; the alleged bias must be extrajudicial (Grider v. Boston
Co., Inc., 773 S.W.2d 338 (Tex. App. 1989), but note this case was stated as
disapproved by a later case, so its authority is limited). The motion here
goes beyond adverse rulings, alleging procedural irregularities and
misconduct.
Ethical and Procedural Violations
The Texas Supreme Court has admonished judges for failing to comply with
the procedural requirements of Rule 18a, such as by filing a response to a
recusal motion (In re Inquiry Concerning Honorable Bonnie Rangel, 677
S.W.3d 918 (Tex. 2023)). The motion’s allegations regarding the alteration
and selective transmission of filings, if true, could implicate both ethical and
procedural violations. The law requires that all related documents be
forwarded in their original or certified form, and any manipulation or
omission is outside the scope of the judge’s authority (In re Norman, 191
S.W.3d 858 (Tex. App. 2006); Carson v. Gomez, 841 S.W.2d 491 (Tex. App.
1992)).
Tertiary Recusal Motion Limitations
Because this is a tertiary recusal motion, the judge is not required to step
aside or halt proceedings unless and until the motion is sustained (Tex.
Gov't. Code § 25.00256; Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 30.016). The judge
may continue to preside, sign orders, and move the case to final disposition.
If the motion is denied, the denial is only reviewable on appeal from the final
judgment. If the motion is sustained, all orders signed during the pendency
of the motion must be vacated.
Exceptions and Caveats
If the motion were not verified or failed to state grounds with
particularity, it could be dismissed as insufficient (Moorhead v. State,
972 S.W.2d 93 (Tex. App. 1998)), but that is not the case here.
The judge may take further action in the case only for good cause
stated in writing (Tex. Gov't. Code § 74.059).

such claims; the relevant question is whether the facts, if true, would
cause a reasonable person to doubt the judge’s impartiality.
Conclusion
The recusal motion filed by Charles Dustin Myers is not conclusory; it is
verified, states grounds with particularity, and is supported by specific
factual allegations and docket references, as required by Texas law.
However, as a tertiary recusal motion, its immediate effect is limited by
statute, and the judge may continue to preside over the case unless the
motion is ultimately sustained. The motion’s sufficiency and detail mean it
cannot be dismissed out of hand, but its success will depend on whether the
facts, if proven, would lead a reasonable person to question the judge’s
impartiality. The statutory and case law framework is clear: the appearance
of bias is sufficient for recusal, but the procedural limitations on tertiary
motions must be observed.
Legal Authorities
In re Flores, 53 S.W.3d 428 (Tex. App. 2001)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
We are asked to determine whether a presiding judge has 'assigned' himself
under Texas Government Code Chapter 74 when he decides to personally
hear a motion to recuse, rather than designate another judge to do so, under
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a. We hold that a Chapter 74 assignment
does not occur under these circumstances; therefore, the presiding judge is
not subject to an objection under Chapter 74.
Summary
A presiding judge deciding to hear a recusal motion personally does not
constitute an "assignment" under Chapter 74, and therefore, objections
under Chapter 74 are not applicable in such cases. This is relevant to the
question as it provides insight into the procedural correctness of the recusal
motion filed by Charles Dustin Myers, particularly in terms of whether the
judge followed the correct procedure.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
The language of our rules is clear and straightforward: the grounds for
recusal of an appellate justice or judge are the same as those provided in the
rules of civil procedure. Tex.R.App. P. 16.2. Texas Rule of Civil Procedure
18b provides that '[a] judge shall recuse himself in any proceeding in
which ... his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.' Tex.R. Civ. P.
18b(2)(a). This language is mandatory, and the standard is objective, not
subjective. Id. It calls upon the judge—in the first instance—to assess his
impartiality. A reasonable doubt is resolved in favor of recusal.
Summary
The Texas Rules of Civil Procedure mandate that a judge must recuse
themselves if their impartiality might reasonably be questioned. This is an
objective standard, meaning it does not depend on the judge's personal
feelings but rather on whether a reasonable person would question the
judge's impartiality. The passage emphasizes that the appearance of
impartiality is crucial, and any reasonable doubt should be resolved in favor
of recusal.
Texaco, Inc. v. Pennzoil, Co., 729 S.W.2d 768 (Tex. App. 1987)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Under Texas law, the basis for the disqualification of a judge is contained in
Article V, Section 11 of the Texas Constitution, which prohibits a judge from
sitting in a case where he may be interested, or where he is related to a
party by affinity or consanguinity in a degree prescribed by law, or where he
was counsel in the case... Rather, it argues that the grounds for recusal rest
in Canon 3C of the Code of Judicial Conduct... In McLeod, the supreme court
held that pursuant to the following language from Tex.Rev.Civ.Stat.Ann. art.
200a, § 6 (Vernon 1977), the trial court has a mandatory duty to request that
the presiding judge assign another judge to hear the motion to recuse...
While rule 18a does mandate a hearing on a motion to recuse, such
requirement is not triggered unless the recusal motion states valid grounds
for disqualification.
Summary
Legal standards and procedures for recusal in Texas, emphasizing that a
judge must be disqualified if there is a reasonable question of impartiality.
The passage also highlights the procedural requirements under Texas Rule
of Civil Procedure 18a, which mandates a hearing on a recusal motion only if
valid grounds for disqualification are stated. This is relevant to the recusal
motion in question, as it provides a legal framework for evaluating the
sufficiency of the allegations and the procedural steps that must be followed.

Carson v. Gomez, 841 S.W.2d 491 (Tex. App. 1992)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Appellant asserts the trial judge was without jurisdiction to dismiss. Once a
motion to recuse has been filed, the trial judge has only two options, recusal
or referral. TEX.R.CIV.P. 18a(c). Rule 18a(d) provides: If the judge declines
to recuse himself, he shall forward to the presiding judge of the
administrative judicial district, in either original form or certified copy, an
order of referral, the motion, and all opposing and concurring statements.
Except for good cause stated in the order in which further action is taken,
the judge shall make no further orders and shall take no further action in
the case after filing of the motion and prior to a hearing on the motion.
TEX.R.CIV.P. 18a(d).
Summary
When a motion to recuse is filed, the judge has only two options: to recuse
themselves or to refer the motion to the presiding judge of the
administrative judicial district. The judge is not allowed to take further
action in the case until the motion is resolved, except for good cause stated
in writing. This procedural requirement is mandatory and applies to all civil
cases in Texas.
In re Norman, 191 S.W.3d 858 (Tex. App. 2006)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a, Judge Austin had a mandatory
duty either to recuse himself or to refer the recusal motion to the presiding
judge. TEX.R. CIV. P. 18a. Furthermore, section 74.059(c)(3) of the
Government Code states that a district, statutory probate, or statutory
county court judge shall 'request the presiding judge to assign another judge
to hear a motion relating to the recusal of the judge from a case pending in
his court.' TEX. GOV'T CODE ANN. § 74.059(c)(3) (Vernon 2005). Judge
Austin did not have the option of denying the motion.
Summary
Under Texas law, when a motion to recuse is filed, the judge in question has
a mandatory duty to either recuse themselves or refer the motion to the
presiding judge. The judge does not have the discretion to deny the motion
themselves. This ensures that the motion is evaluated by an impartial party,
maintaining the integrity of the judicial process.

De Leon v. Aguilar, 127 S.W.3d 1 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004)
Texas Court of Criminal Appeals
Extract
When a recusal motion is timely filed, Rule 18a leaves a trial judge with no
discretion—the trial judge must either recuse himself or refer the motion for
another judge to decide. See Rule 18a(c). Any criminal cases to the contrary
such as McClenan are overruled. Rule 18a does not contemplate that a trial
judge whose impartiality is questioned can nevertheless determine whether
the allegations of bias against him state sufficient grounds for recusal.
Summary
The passage from "De Leon v. Aguilar" clarifies that when a recusal motion
is filed, the judge in question must either recuse themselves or refer the
motion to another judge. The judge does not have the discretion to
determine the sufficiency of the allegations themselves. This is relevant to
the recusal motion in question because it underscores the procedural
requirement that the judge must follow, which is to either recuse or refer,
rather than dismiss the motion based on their own assessment of its merits.
Ex parte Thuesen, 546 S.W.3d 145 (Tex. Crim. App. 2017)
Texas Court of Criminal Appeals
Extract
The circumstances presented in this case focus our attention on an area of
criminal practice which would benefit from further explanation. The manner
in which our judicial system handles the recusal of judges affects public
confidence in the judiciary, as it goes to the 'very heart of the promise of
impartiality.' See Johnson v. Pumjani, 56 S.W.3d 670, 672 (Tex. App.–Houston
[14th Dist.] 2001, no pet.). Our Code of Criminal Procedure contains no
procedures governing the recusal of trial judges. Consequently, this Court
has looked to the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure for guidance concerning the
recusal of trial judges in criminal cases and habeas corpus proceedings.
Summary
The passage highlights the significance of proper recusal procedures to
ensure judicial impartiality and public confidence. It indicates that in the
absence of specific criminal procedure rules, civil procedure rules are used
as guidance. This is relevant to the recusal motion in question, as it
underscores the importance of following proper procedures and the
potential impact on public perception of fairness.

In re Inquiry Concerning Honorable Bonnie Rangel CJC No., 677 S.W.3d 918
(Tex. 2023)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
The 'public admonition' arose from a single instance of Judge Rangel filing a
written response to a motion seeking her recusal from a particular case.
Underlying the determination was the rule of procedure stating that a jurist
subject to such a motion 'should not file a response' to it. TEX. R. CIV. PROC.
18a(c)(2). According to the Commission, the mere fact that Judge Rangel
filed a response meant she failed to comport and maintain competence in
the law, thereby violating 'Canons 2A and 3B(2) of the Texas Code of Judicial
Conduct.'
Summary
The Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, specifically Rule 18a, prohibit a judge
from filing a response to a recusal motion. This is a procedural requirement
that ensures impartiality and maintains public confidence in the judiciary.
The passage highlights the importance of judges adhering to procedural
rules and the consequences of failing to do so, as seen in the case of Judge
Rangel, who was admonished for filing a response to a recusal motion,
which is not allowed under the rules.
Sears v. Nueces County Sherriff Olivarez, 28 S.W.3d 611 (Tex. App. 2000)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The Texas Supreme Court mandates that when there exists a reasonable
question as to a judge's impartiality, recusal is mandatory. In determining
whether recusal is required pursuant to Tex.R.Civ.P. 18b(2)(a), the proper
inquiry is whether a reasonable member of the public at large, knowing all
the facts in the public domain would have a reasonable doubt that a judge is
actually impartial. ... The grounds for recusal of an appellate court justice
are generally the same as those provided in the rules of civil procedure. Tex.
R. App. P. 16.2. Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18b(2) provides, in part, that
judges shall recuse themselves when their impartiality might be questioned
or when they have a personal bias or prejudice concerning the subject
matter or a party.
Summary
The Texas Supreme Court requires recusal when there is a reasonable
question about a judge's impartiality. The standard is whether a reasonable

=== PAGE 15 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
member of the public, knowing all the facts, would doubt the judge's
impartiality. This aligns with the recusal motion's argument that the
appearance of bias is sufficient for recusal, as outlined in the motion's
references to Texas law and procedure.
Kniatt v. State, 239 S.W.3d 910 (Tex. App. 2007)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Rule 18b(2)(a) plainly states that a 'judge shall recuse himself in any
proceeding in which... his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.'
TEX.R. CIV. P. 18b(2)(a). Texas cases almost unanimously state the following
reasonable-person test for questioned impartiality: 'In determining whether
a judge's impartiality might be reasonably questioned so as to require
recusal, the proper inquiry is whether a reasonable member of the public at
large, knowing all the facts in the public domain concerning the judge and
the case, would have a reasonable doubt that the judge is actually impartial.'
Summary
The standard for recusal in Texas is whether a reasonable person, knowing
all the facts, would doubt the judge's impartiality. This is relevant to the
recusal motion in question because it provides the legal framework under
which the motion should be evaluated. The motion to recuse Judge Munford
is based on allegations that his impartiality might reasonably be questioned,
which aligns with the standard set forth in Rule 18b(2)(a).
State v. Volkswagen Aktiengesellschaft, 692 S.W.3d 467 (Tex. 2022)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
The grounds for disqualification and recusal under Texas law are set out in
Rule of Civil Procedure 18b. Relevant to this case, Rule 18b requires a judge
to recuse if 'the judge’s impartiality might reasonably be questioned' or 'the
judge has a personal bias or prejudice concerning the subject matter or a
party.' Tex. R. Civ. P. 18b(b)(1), (2); see Tex. R. App. P. 16.2 ('The grounds for
recusal of an appellate court justice or judge are the same as those provided
in the Rules of Civil Procedure.'). Canons 2 and 3 of the Code of Judicial
Conduct address these same issues. Titled 'Avoiding Impropriety and the
Appearance of Impropriety in All of the Judge’s Activities,' Canon 2 requires
that '[a] judge shall not allow any relationship to influence judicial conduct
or judgment.'

=== PAGE 16 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
The Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, specifically Rule 18b, provide the
grounds for judicial recusal. A judge must recuse themselves if their
impartiality might reasonably be questioned or if they have a personal bias
or prejudice concerning the subject matter or a party. This is relevant to the
recusal motion in question, as it provides the legal basis for the claims made
by the Respondent, Charles Dustin Myers, regarding the alleged bias and
impropriety of Judge James Munford.
Johnson v Pumjani, 56 S.W.3d 670 (Tex. App. 2001)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
When a motion to recuse is filed, a trial court has only two options: recusal
or referral of the case to the presiding judge for a determination as to its
merits. Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a(c); In re Rio Grande Valley Gas Co., 987 S.W.2d
167, 178-79 (Tex.App. Corpus Christi 1999, no pet.); Carson v. Gomez, 841
S .W.2d 491, 493 (Tex.App. Houston [1st Dist.] 1992, no writ). The court
does not have the option of doing nothing. Rio Grande Valley Gas, 987 S.W.
2d at 178; Brosseau v. Ranzau, 911 S.W.2d 890, 892 (Tex. App. Beaumont
1995, no writ). This is true even when the motion may be considered
untimely or as stating insufficient grounds for recusal. Jamilah v. Bass, 862
S.W.2d 201, 203 (Tex.App. Houston [14th Dist.] 1993, no writ). The motion
may ultimately fail on those grounds, but that decision should be made by
some other judge so as to avoid even the appearance of impropriety.
Summary
When a motion to recuse is filed, the trial court must either recuse the judge
or refer the motion to the presiding judge for a decision. The court cannot
ignore the motion, even if it appears untimely or insufficient. This ensures
the impartiality of the judiciary and avoids any appearance of impropriety.

Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18b provides multiple grounds for recusal. See
TEX. R. CIV. P. 18b(b). Potentially relevant to this case, rule 18b provides
that a judge must recuse himself in any proceeding in which the judge's
impartiality might reasonably be questioned or the judge has a personal bias
or prejudice concerning the subject matter or a party. Id. Recusal is

appropriate if a reasonable member of the public at large, knowing all the
facts in the public domain concerning the judge's conduct, would have a
reasonable doubt that the judge is actually impartial.
Summary
The Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18b provides the grounds for recusal,
which include situations where a judge's impartiality might reasonably be
questioned. The passage also clarifies that recusal is appropriate if a
reasonable member of the public, knowing all the facts, would doubt the
judge's impartiality. This aligns with the recusal motion in question, which
argues that the judge's impartiality is in question due to alleged misconduct
and bias.
Thomas v. Pugliese, No. 02-18-00064-CV (Tex. App. Jul 11, 2019)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
In support of her second and third issues, Thomas argues that the regional
presiding judge erred by denying her recusal motions. We review the denial
of a recusal motion for an abuse of discretion. See Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a(j)(1)(A);
Lopez v. Tarrant Cty., Tex., No. 02-13-00194-CV, 2015 WL 5025233, at *4
(Tex. App.—Fort Worth Aug. 25, 2015, pet. denied) (mem. op.). A trial court
abuses its discretion if it acts without reference to any guiding rules or
principles—that is, if its act is arbitrary or unreasonable. Low v. Henry, 221
S.W.3d 609, 614 (Tex. 2007); Cire v. Cummings, 134 S.W.3d 835, 838-39
(Tex. 2004).
Summary
Recusal motions in Texas are reviewed for abuse of discretion. This means
that a trial court's decision on a recusal motion will be overturned only if it
is arbitrary or unreasonable. The passage also highlights that a recusal
motion must be based on more than just dissatisfaction with judicial rulings;
it must demonstrate bias or partiality that affects due process.
In re G. S., No. 02-19-00390-CV (Tex. App. Mar 19, 2020)

A motion to recuse must be verified, must assert one or more of the grounds
listed in Rule of Civil Procedure 18b, must not be based solely on the judge's

ruling is outside the 'zone of reasonable disagreement' or fails to apply
proper guiding rules and principles. Kemp v. State, 846 S.W.2d 289, 306
(Tex. Crim. App. 1992); Abdygapparova v. State, 243 S.W.3d 191, 198 (Tex.
App.—San Antonio 2007, pet. ref'd). Our review is fact intensive, considering
the entire record from the recusal hearing.
Summary
A motion to recuse is reviewed under an abuse-of-discretion standard. This
means that the court's decision will only be overturned if it is outside the
"zone of reasonable disagreement" or if the court fails to apply proper
guiding rules and principles. The review is fact-intensive and considers the
entire record from the recusal hearing. This is relevant to the question as it
provides insight into how recusal motions are evaluated in Texas, which is
pertinent to the motion filed by Charles Dustin Myers.

Extract
We review the denial of a motion to recuse for an abuse of discretion. See
Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a(j)(1)(A). 'A party seeking recusal must satisfy a 'high
threshold' before a judge must be recused.' In the Interest of E.R.C., 496

which he has a 'personal bias or prejudice concerning the subject matter or
a party[.]' Tex. R. Civ. P. 18b(1), (2).
Summary
A motion to recuse a judge in Texas must meet a high threshold,
demonstrating that the judge's impartiality might reasonably be questioned
or that there is a personal bias or prejudice. The passage provides the legal
standard for recusal, which is relevant to evaluating the sufficiency of the
recusal motion in question.
Ludlow v. DeBerry, 959 S.W.2d 265 (Tex. App. 1997)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
In Grider v. Boston Co., Inc., 773 S.W.2d 338, 346 (Tex.App.--Dallas 1989,
writ denied), appellants claimed error in the trial judge's refusal to recuse
himself because the judge 'exhibited an antagonistic attitude toward them
and ... his rulings were consistently unfair.' The Dallas court held that a
party attempting to require a judge to recuse himself must show that the
judge's bias was extrajudicial and not based on in-court rulings. Id. The
court added that appellants' remedy was to assign error concerning the
adverse rulings. Id.
Summary
For a recusal motion to be successful, the bias or partiality of the judge must
stem from an extrajudicial source, not merely from in-court rulings or
conduct. The passage emphasizes that judicial rulings alone are insufficient
for recusal unless they demonstrate a deep-seated favoritism or antagonism
that would make fair judgment impossible. This is relevant to the recusal
motion in question because it suggests that the allegations must show
extrajudicial bias to be successful.
Metzger v. Sebek, 892 S.W.2d 20 (Tex. App. 1994)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The judge refused to hear Bradt's motion, ruling that the motion to recuse
was untimely, and thus in violation of Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a(a)...
We reject the appellees' argument that Bradt's motion to recuse 'failed to
establish a proper basis for recusal,' and therefore the judge could ignore it.
This is the same argument we rejected in Carson, 841 S.W.2d at 493. The

=== PAGE 20 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
judge who has been asked to recuse should not be the one who determines
whether the motion states valid grounds for recusal.
Summary
The passage highlights that a judge should not be the one to determine the
validity of a recusal motion's grounds, emphasizing the procedural
requirement that such motions should be referred to another judge. This
aligns with the recusal motion in question, which argues that the judge's
impartiality might reasonably be questioned and that procedural errors have
occurred.
Harris v. State, 160 S.W.3d 621 (Tex. 2005)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
We review the denial of a recusal motion under an abuse-of-discretion
standard. See Wesbrook v. State, 29 S.W.3d 103, 120 (Tex.Crim.App.2000);
Rosas, 76 S.W.3d at 774. Recusal because of bias is justified when 'the
movant has provided facts sufficient to establish that a reasonable man,
knowing all the circumstances involved, would harbor doubts as to the
impartiality of the trial judge.' Kemp v. State, 846 S.W.2d 289, 305
(Tex.Crim.App. 1992); accord Rosas, 76 S.W.3d at 774. We will not reverse a
recusal decision which lies 'within the zone of reasonable disagreement.'
Summary
A recusal motion is reviewed under an abuse-of-discretion standard. Recusal
is justified when the movant provides sufficient facts to establish that a
reasonable person, knowing all the circumstances, would doubt the judge's
impartiality. This standard is applicable to the recusal motion in question, as
it provides a framework for evaluating whether the allegations and evidence
presented are sufficient to warrant recusal.
Roman v. State, 145 S.W.3d 316 (Tex. App. 2004)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
In a single issue, appellant complains that the trial judge should have been
recused and that the judge hearing appellant's motion to recuse erred in
denying it. We hold that the trial judge exhibited a bias — a bent or tendency
— but was not biased as contemplated by the case law. As a result, we affirm
the denial of the motion to recuse because (1) the trial judge's opinions
about punishment were based on specific facts of the defendant's case —

=== PAGE 21 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
reflecting an attempt to fit the punishment with the crime — and (2) the
knowledge the trial judge gained about the case from trying a co-defendant
was not knowledge gained from an extra-judicial source.
Summary
Standards for recusal of a judge in Texas, emphasizing that recusal is
appropriate if a judge's impartiality might reasonably be questioned.
However, it also clarifies that a judge's opinions formed based on the
specific facts of a case do not necessarily constitute bias warranting recusal.
The passage highlights that the judge's knowledge gained from related
cases is not considered extra-judicial and does not automatically disqualify
the judge. This is relevant to the question as it provides insight into the
standards and considerations for recusal motions in Texas, which is
pertinent to the recusal motion filed by Charles Dustin Myers.
Jaquez v. State 712 S.W.3d 217
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Jaquez contends that the trial judge should have been recused under Texas
Rule of Civil Procedure 18b... Rule 18b requires, in relevant part, that a
judge shall recuse herself in any proceeding in which her impartiality might
reasonably be questioned or she has a personal bias or prejudice concerning
the subject matter or a party, or personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary
facts concerning the proceeding... In determining whether recusal is
necessary, 'the proper inquiry is whether a reasonable member of the public
at large, knowing all the facts in the public domain concerning the judge and
the case, would have a reasonable doubt that the judge is actually
impartial.'... The movant of a motion to recuse the trial judge bears the
burden of proving recusal is warranted by providing facts demonstrating the
presence of bias or partiality 'of such a nature and extent as to deny the
movant due process of law.'
Summary
The Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18b sets a high threshold for recusal,
requiring the movant to demonstrate bias or partiality that would lead a
reasonable person to doubt the judge's impartiality. The passage emphasizes
the need for concrete facts to support claims of bias or partiality, which
aligns with the detailed allegations and references provided in the recusal
motion in question.

The Texas Rules of Civil Procedure provide that a judge shall recuse himself
in any proceeding in which 'his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.'
Tex. R. Civ. P. 18b(2)(a). We review the denial of a motion to recuse for abuse
of discretion. Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a(f); Vickery v. Vickery, 999 S.W.2d 342, 349
(Tex. 1999) (op. on reh'g); McElwee v. McElwee, 911 S.W.2d 182, 185 (Tex.
App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 1995, writ denied). The test for abuse of discretion
is not whether in the opinion of the reviewing court the facts present an
appropriate case for the trial court's action; rather, it is a question of
whether the court acted without reference to any guiding rules or principles.
Summary
The Texas Rules of Civil Procedure require a judge to recuse themselves if
their impartiality might reasonably be questioned. The review of a recusal
motion's denial is based on whether the judge acted without reference to
guiding rules or principles, indicating an abuse of discretion. This is relevant
to the recusal motion in question, as it provides the legal standard and
framework under which such motions are evaluated in Texas.
Adams v. Adams, NO. 01-18-00192-CV (Tex. App. Apr 16, 2019)

TEX. R. CIV. P. 18b(b)(1), (2).
Summary
In Texas, a motion to recuse a judge must meet a high threshold. The party
seeking recusal must demonstrate that the judge's impartiality might
reasonably be questioned or that there is a personal bias or prejudice. The
decision to deny a recusal motion is reviewed for an abuse of discretion,
meaning the trial court's decision must be arbitrary or unreasonable to be
overturned. The passage provides insight into the legal standards and
burden of proof required for a successful recusal motion in Texas.
Moorhead v. State, 972 S.W.2d 93 (Tex. App. 1998)

=== PAGE 23 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Rule 18a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure applies to recusal and
disqualification matters in criminal cases, absent a legislative declaration to
the contrary. ... When a recusal motion is filed, the trial judge against whom
the motion is directed may properly make an initial determination of
whether the recusal motion is in compliance with the rule governing recusal
or disqualification of judges. ... The motion filed by Moorhead was not
verified and thus did not meet the minimum requirements of Rule 18a. Rule
18a requires that the recusal motion be verified. Accordingly, the rule's
mandatory referral and hearing provisions were never triggered.
Summary
A recusal motion must comply with specific procedural requirements,
including verification, under Rule 18a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure.
The passage highlights that a judge can determine if a recusal motion meets
these minimum requirements of form. If the motion is not verified, the judge
is not required to refer it for further consideration, and the mandatory
referral and hearing provisions are not triggered.
Brosseau v. Ranzau, 911 S.W.2d 890 (Tex. App. 1995)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Appellant claims that the trial court judge erred in failing to respond to a
motion to recuse. He claims that in response to his motion to recuse, the
trial judge should have either recused himself from the case or referred the
motion to the presiding judge of the administrative judicial district in
accordance with Rule 18a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure... Rule 18a
of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure is explicit with regard to motions to
recuse. It provides in part: (emphasis added) ... (d) If the judge declines to
recuse himself, he shall forward to the presiding judge of the administrative
judicial district, in either original form or certified copy, an order of referral,
the motion, and all opposing and concurring statements. Except for good
cause stated in the order in which further action is taken, the judge shall
make no further orders and shall take no further action in the case after
filing of the motion and prior to a hearing on the motion.... There is a simple
interpretation of Rule 18a. The appellate courts have agreed that when
presented with a motion to recuse a judge has two, and only two, options.
These options are for the judge to either recuse himself or refer the motion
to the presiding judge of the administrative judicial district.

Legal basis for the argument that a judge must act in one of the two
specified ways when presented with a motion to recuse, which supports the
claims made in the recusal motion.
Jamilah v. Bass, 862 S.W.2d 201 (Tex. App. 1993)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Relator's motion for recusal sought the have Judge Bass either recuse
himself or forward the case to the presiding judge of Brazoria County.
Respondent argues that the recusal motion is not a proper motion in that it
was untimely filed and failed to state a ground for recusal. This court has
previously held that the procedural requirements of Rule 18a are mandatory
and a party who fails to comply with them waives the right to complain of a
judge's failure to recuse himself. Watkins v. Pearson, 795 S.W.2d 257
(Tex.App.--Houston [14th Dist.] 1990, writ denied); Vickery v. Texas Carpet
Co., 792 S.W.2d 759 (Tex.App.--Houston [14th Dist.] 1990, writ denied).
However, the contempt hearing in the present case was set for July 19th.
Relator was notified of the setting on July 14th. She filed her motion to
recuse the next day. On these facts, we hold the trial judge had but two
options: to recuse himself or refer the case to the presiding judge.
TEX.R.CIV.P. 18a(c); Lamberti v. Tschoepe, 776 S.W.2d 651 (Tex.App.--Dallas
1989, writ denied). This is so regardless of the timeliness of the motion or
the sufficiency of the grounds for recusal.
Summary
The procedural requirements of Rule 18a are mandatory. A motion for
recusal must be filed in compliance with these requirements, and failure to
do so results in waiving the right to complain about a judge's failure to
recuse. The passage also clarifies that once a motion for recusal is filed, the
judge has only two options: to recuse themselves or refer the case to the
presiding judge, regardless of the motion's timeliness or the sufficiency of
the grounds for recusal.

Summary
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a is mandatory for recusal matters and does
not require an objection to the lack of an evidentiary hearing once the
procedures under the rule are triggered. This rule applies to both civil and
criminal cases, and the language of the rule is mandatory, meaning that it
must be followed as prescribed.
Vargas v. State, 883 S.W.2d 256 (Tex. App. 1994)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The trial judge, upon the filing of a motion to recuse, shall request the
presiding judge of the administrative district to assign another judge to hear
a motion to recuse. TEX. GOV'T CODE ANN. § 74.059(c)(3). TEX.R.CIV.P.
18a(c) requires the judge to either recuse himself or refer the motion to the
presiding judge of the administrative district before proceeding any further
in the case.
Summary
In Texas, when a motion to recuse is filed, the judge must either recuse
themselves or refer the motion to the presiding judge of the administrative
district. This is a procedural requirement under the Texas Government Code
and Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. The passage does not directly address
the content or conclusory nature of the motion but emphasizes the
procedural steps that must be followed once a motion is filed.
Grider v. Boston Co., Inc., 773 S.W.2d 338 (Tex. App. 1989)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
By points eight and nine, Plaintiffs assert that the trial judge erred in failing
to recuse himself, and that the judge to whom the motion for recusal was
transferred erred in failing to require the recusal of the trial judge. The rule
governing recusal states: Judges shall recuse themselves in proceedings in
which their impartiality might reasonably be questioned, including but not
limited to, instances in which they have a personal bias or prejudice
concerning the subject matter or a party, or personal knowledge of disputed

=== PAGE 26 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
evidentiary facts concerning the proceeding. TEX.R.CIV.P. 18b(2). As
grounds for recusal, Plaintiffs contend that the trial judge exhibited an
antagonistic attitude toward them and that his rulings were consistently
unfair. We do not intimate that the trial court conducted itself in this fashion.
Even so, Plaintiffs' remedy was not a motion to recuse; the proper remedy
was to assign error on the basis of the adverse rulings. To require recusal, a
judge's bias must be extrajudicial and not based upon in-court rulings.
Summary
The passage provides insight into the standards for recusal under Texas law,
specifically under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18b(2). It clarifies that a
judge should recuse themselves if their impartiality might reasonably be
questioned, including instances of personal bias or prejudice. However, it
also emphasizes that the bias must be extrajudicial and not based on in-
court rulings. The passage suggests that if the alleged bias arises from the
judge's rulings, the appropriate remedy is to assign error on those rulings,
not to file a motion for recusal.

Summary
Any motion or pleading filed in Texas courts must be based on a reasonable
inquiry and have evidentiary support. This requirement ensures that the
allegations are not frivolous and have a factual basis. The recusal motion in
question provides DKT references to support its allegations, which aligns
with the requirement for evidentiary support as outlined in Chapter 10.

cases). Because this standard requires a determination that the court acted
without any guiding rules and principles, the trial court abuses its discretion
only if the ruling on the motion was not within the zone of reasonable
disagreement. ... When bias is alleged as a ground for recusal, the recusal of
a judge is appropriate only if the movant provides sufficient evidence to
establish that a reasonable person, knowing all the circumstances involved,

305. See TEX.R. CIV. P. 18b. Only when the bias attains a level denying the

Summary
A motion to recuse a judge in Texas is reviewed under an abuse of discretion
standard. The movant must provide sufficient evidence to establish that a
reasonable person, knowing all the circumstances, would doubt the judge's
impartiality. The recusal is warranted only if the alleged bias reaches a level
that denies the movant due process of law. This aligns with the standards
and procedures outlined in the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, specifically
Rule 18a and 18b.
Rio Grande Valley Gas Co., In re, 987 S.W.2d 167 (Tex. App. 1999)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
When a motion to recuse has been filed, a judge must either recuse him- or
herself or request the presiding administrative judge to assign another judge
to hear the motion. Wright v. Wright, 867 S.W.2d 807, 811 (Tex.App.--El Paso
1993, writ denied); Carson, 841 S.W.2d at 492-93; Lamberti, 776 S.W.2d at

1986, writ ref'd. n.r.e.); Greenberg, 685 S.W.2d at 695. Any order other than
an order of recusal or referral, entered by a court after a proper motion to
recuse is entered is void.
Summary
When a motion to recuse is filed, the judge in question must either recuse
themselves or refer the motion to another judge. This is a mandatory
procedure under Texas law, and any other action taken by the judge after a
recusal motion is filed is considered void. This supports the argument in the
recusal motion that Judge Munford should have either recused himself or
referred the motion to another judge, and any actions taken outside of this
procedure could be considered improper.
Kemp v. State, 846 S.W.2d 289 (Tex. Crim. App. 1992)

=== PAGE 28 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Texas Court of Criminal Appeals
Extract
A trial judge ruling on a motion alleging bias as a ground for disqualification
must decide whether the movant has provided facts sufficient to establish
that a reasonable man, knowing all the circumstances involved, would
harbor doubts as to the impartiality of the trial judge. See Chitimacha Tribe
of Louisiana v. Harry L. Laws Co., 690 F.2d 1157, 1165 (5th Cir.1982); see
also, McClenan, supra at 109. Bias may be a ground for disqualification only
when it is shown to be of such nature, and to such extent, as to deny the
defendant due process of law.
Summary
For a recusal motion to be successful, it must provide sufficient facts to
establish that a reasonable person, knowing all the circumstances, would
doubt the judge's impartiality. The motion must demonstrate that the alleged
bias is of such a nature and extent that it denies the defendant due process
of law. This standard is applicable to recusal motions in Texas, including the
one in question.
Tex. Const. art. 5 § 11 Tex. Const. art. 5 § 11 Disqualification of Judges;
Exchange of Districts; Holding Court For Other Judges
Extract
No judge shall sit in any case wherein the judge may be interested, or where
either of the parties may be connected with the judge, either by affinity or
consanguinity, within such a degree as may be prescribed by law, or when
the judge shall have been counsel in the case.
Summary
The Texas Constitution mandates that judges must recuse themselves from
cases where they have a personal interest, a connection to the parties, or
have previously served as counsel. This aligns with the recusal motion's
argument that Judge Munford's impartiality might reasonably be questioned
due to alleged misconduct and potential bias, as outlined in the motion with
specific docket references.

Extract
A judge is subject to recusal or disqualification on the same grounds and
under the same circumstances as specified in TRCP Rule 18b. Motion. A
motion to recuse or disqualify a judge assigned to a case should: (A) be
made at the earliest practicable time; (B) be verified, if the motion is in
writing; (C) state with particularity the grounds for the motion; and (D) be
based on personal knowledge and include such facts as would be admissible
in evidence, except that facts may be stated on information and belief if the
basis for such belief is specifically stated.
Summary
The Texas Administrative Code provides specific guidelines for filing a
motion to recuse or disqualify a judge. The motion must be made promptly,
verified if in writing, state the grounds with particularity, and be based on
personal knowledge with admissible facts. The motion in question appears
to follow these guidelines by providing detailed allegations with DKT
references, which supports the claim that it is not conclusory.

Summary
Texas law requires a judge to request the presiding judge to assign another
judge to hear a motion relating to the recusal of the judge from a case
pending in his court. This aligns with the recusal motion filed by Charles
Dustin Myers, which argues that Judge James Munford should recuse
himself due to alleged bias and misconduct. The motion is not conclusory
because it provides specific docket references and allegations, which are
supported by the procedural requirements outlined in the Texas Government
Code.
Tex. Gov't. Code § 24.002 Tex. Gov't. Code § 24.002 Assignment of Judge Or
Transfer of Case On Recusal
Extract
If a district judge determines on the judge's own motion that the judge
should not sit in a case pending in the judge's court because the judge is
disqualified or otherwise should recuse himself or herself, the judge shall
enter a recusal order, request the presiding judge of that administrative
judicial region to assign another judge to sit, and take no further action in
the case except for good cause stated in the order in which the action is
taken.
Summary
The Texas Government Code provides a clear procedure for a judge to
recuse themselves if they determine they are disqualified or should
otherwise not preside over a case. The judge must enter a recusal order and
request the presiding judge of the administrative judicial region to assign

another judge. This ensures that the case is handled impartially and
maintains the integrity of the judicial process.

Extract
If a party to a civil case files a timely objection to the assignment, the judge
shall not hear the case. Except as provided by Subsection (d), each party to
the case is only entitled to one objection under this section for that case.
Summary
In Texas, a party to a civil case can file an objection to the assignment of a
judge, and if the objection is timely, the judge is not allowed to hear the
case. This is relevant to the recusal motion because it provides a legal basis
for objecting to a judge's assignment, which is a form of recusal. The motion
to recuse in the question is supported by specific allegations and references
to the docket, which aligns with the procedural requirements for objecting
to a judge's assignment.

(a) In this section, 'tertiary recusal motion' means a third or subsequent
motion for recusal or disqualification filed in a case against any statutory
probate court judge by the same party. The term includes any third or
subsequent motion filed in the case by the same party, regardless of whether
that motion is filed against a different judge than the judge or judges against
whom the previous motions for recusal or disqualification were filed. (b) A
judge who declines recusal after a tertiary recusal motion is filed shall
comply with applicable rules of procedure for recusal and disqualification
except that the judge shall continue to: preside over the case; sign orders in
the case; and move the case to final disposition as though a tertiary recusal
motion had not been filed. (c) A judge hearing a tertiary recusal motion
against another judge who denies the motion shall award reasonable and
necessary attorney's fees and costs to the party opposing the motion. The
party making the motion and the attorney for the party are jointly and
severally liable for the award of fees and costs. The fees and costs must be
paid before the 31st day after the date the order denying the tertiary recusal
motion is rendered unless the order is properly superseded. (d) The denial of
a tertiary recusal motion is only reviewable on appeal from final judgment.
(e) If a tertiary recusal motion is finally sustained, the new judge for the
case shall vacate all orders signed by the sitting judge during the pendency
of the tertiary recusal motion.

Summary
A tertiary recusal motion is a third or subsequent motion for recusal or
disqualification filed by the same party in a case. The statute outlines that
even if such a motion is filed, the judge can continue to preside over the
case and move it to final disposition as if the motion had not been filed. This
is relevant to the question because it provides the legal framework under
which the recusal motion in question is being considered, indicating that
despite the allegations and references provided, the judge may not be
required to recuse themselves unless the motion is sustained.
Tex. Gov't. Code § 29.055 Tex. Gov't. Code § 29.055 Procedure Following
Filing of Motion; Recusal Or Disqualification Without Motion
Extract
Before further proceedings in a case in which a motion for the recusal or
disqualification of a municipal judge has been filed, the judge shall: recuse
or disqualify himself or herself; or request the regional presiding judge to
assign a judge to hear the motion. A municipal judge who does not recuse or
disqualify himself or herself: shall forward, in original form or certified copy,
an order of referral, the motion, and all opposing and concurring statements
to the regional presiding judge; and may not take other action in the case
during the time after the filing of the motion for recusal or disqualification
and before a hearing on the motion, except for good cause stated in the
order in which the action is taken.
Summary
When a motion for recusal is filed, the judge must either recuse themselves
or refer the motion to the regional presiding judge. The judge is not allowed
to take further action in the case until the motion is resolved, except for
good cause. This ensures that the process is fair and impartial, and it aligns
with the procedures outlined in the recusal motion filed by Charles Dustin
Myers, which references the need for recusal due to alleged bias and
misconduct.

Summary
The passage highlights the importance of judges adhering to procedural
rules, such as those governing recusal motions, and maintaining
professional competence. It provides an example of a judge being
admonished for not following these rules, which is relevant to the question
of whether the recusal motion is valid and supported by proper references.

Summary
The passage highlights the importance of having an independent decision-
maker handle recusal motions to maintain procedural integrity and public
trust. It suggests that while there may be efficiency costs associated with
independent adjudication, these are outweighed by the benefits of increased
trust and integrity. This aligns with the recusal motion in question, which
seeks to ensure impartiality and fairness in the judicial process by
requesting the recusal of a judge due to alleged bias and misconduct.

Summary
The Texas Rules of Civil Procedure provide a clear framework for recusal
motions. Rule 18b(2) specifies that a judge must recuse themselves if their
impartiality might reasonably be questioned. The motion to recuse is the
appropriate method to challenge a judge's alleged bias, and it must state the
grounds for recusal. Once a sufficient motion is filed, the judge must either
recuse themselves or refer the motion to the presiding judge of the
administrative judicial district. This aligns with the recusal motion filed by
Charles Dustin Myers, which provides specific allegations and references to
docket entries, suggesting that the motion is not conclusory but rather
detailed and supported by evidence.

The procedural requisites for recusal in Rule 18a(a) are mandatory, and a
party who fails to conform waives his right to complain of a judge’s failure to
recuse himself. Arnold v. State, 853 S.W.2d 543 (Tex. Crim. App. 1993)... A
motion to recuse is the proper vehicle to challenge any alleged bias of the
trial judge in the case. Sanchez v. State, 926 S.W.2d 391 (Tex. App.—El Paso
1996, pet. ref’d). In order to recuse a judge, any party may file a motion
stating grounds why the judge before whom the case is pending should not
sit in the case. Tex.R.Civ.P. 18a(a). The grounds must be stated with
particularity. Vargas v. State, 883 S.W.2d 256 (Tex.App.—Corpus Christi
1994, pet. ref’d). A motion to recuse must be verified in order to comply
with Rule 18a. Vargas; Moorhead v. State, 972 S.W.2d 93 (Tex.App.—
Texarkana 1998, no pet.).
Summary
Procedural requirements for filing a motion to recuse a judge in Texas. It
emphasizes that the motion must be filed in accordance with Rule 18a(a),
which requires stating the grounds for recusal with particularity and
verifying the motion. The passage also notes that a motion to recuse is the
appropriate method to challenge a judge's alleged bias. The recusal motion
in question appears to follow these guidelines by providing specific
allegations and references to the docket (DKT) numbers, which aligns with
the requirement to state grounds with particularity.
