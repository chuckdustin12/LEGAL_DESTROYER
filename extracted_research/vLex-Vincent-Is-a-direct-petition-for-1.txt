Question
Is a direct petition for writ of mandamus to the Texas Supreme Court appropriate when the court of appeals lacks mandamus jurisdiction over a regional presiding
judge in a recusal proceeding?
Answer (Texas)
Short response
A direct petition for writ of mandamus to the Texas Supreme Court is appropriate when the court of appeals lacks mandamus jurisdiction over a regional presiding
judge in a recusal proceeding. Texas courts of appeals lack statutory authority to issue writs of mandamus against regional presiding judges, while the Texas
Supreme Court has broad original mandamus jurisdiction over "any officer of state government" including regional presiding judges.
Summary
When a party seeks mandamus relief against a regional presiding judge in a recusal proceeding, Texas courts of appeals lack jurisdiction to consider such
petitions. Under Texas Government Code § 22.221, courts of appeals can only issue writs of mandamus against district or county court judges within their district
or to enforce their own jurisdiction. Multiple Texas appellate courts have explicitly held that this jurisdictional grant does not extend to regional presiding judges,
creating a jurisdictional gap that necessitates direct petition to the Texas Supreme Court.
The Texas Supreme Court possesses broad original mandamus jurisdiction under Texas Constitution Article V, § 3 and Texas Government Code § 22.002(a),
which authorizes it to issue writs of mandamus against "any officer of state government" with limited exceptions. This broad jurisdictional authority encompasses
regional presiding judges acting in recusal proceedings, making direct petition to the Supreme Court not only appropriate but necessary when a party seeks
mandamus relief in such circumstances. While typically parties should first petition the court of appeals, this procedural step is unnecessary when the
intermediate appellate court categorically lacks jurisdiction over the respondent.
Background and Relevant Law
Constitutional and Statutory Framework
The Texas Constitution establishes the foundation for the Texas Supreme Court's mandamus jurisdiction. Article V, Section 3 of the Texas Constitution provides
that "The Supreme Court and the Justices thereof shall have power to issue writs of habeas corpus, as may be prescribed by law, and under such regulations as
may be prescribed by law, the said courts and the Justices thereof may issue the writs of mandamus, procedendo, certiorari and such other writs, as may be
necessary to enforce its jurisdiction." Importantly, the Constitution further states that "The Legislature may confer original jurisdiction on the Supreme Court to
issue writs of quo warranto and mandamus in such cases as may be specified, except as against the Governor of the State." Tex. Const. art. 5 § 3. This
constitutional provision establishes both the Supreme Court's inherent power to issue writs necessary to enforce its jurisdiction and the Legislature's authority to
expand that power.
The Texas Legislature has implemented this constitutional authority through statutes that define the mandamus jurisdiction of both the Supreme Court and the
courts of appeals. Texas Government Code § 22.002(a) sets forth the Supreme Court's mandamus jurisdiction: "The supreme court or a justice of the supreme
court may issue writs of procedendo and certiorari and all writs of quo warranto and mandamus agreeable to the principles of law regulating those writs, against a
statutory county court judge, a statutory probate court judge, a district judge, a court of appeals or a justice of a court of appeals, or any officer of state
government except the governor, the court of criminal appeals, or a judge of the court of criminal appeals." Tex. Gov't. Code § 22.002.
In contrast, the courts of appeals have a more limited mandamus jurisdiction, as defined in Texas Government Code § 22.221: "Each court of appeals or a justice
of a court of appeals may issue a writ of mandamus and all other writs necessary to enforce the jurisdiction of the court." The statute continues, "Subject to
Subsection (c-1), each court of appeals for a court of appeals district may issue all writs of mandamus, agreeable to the principles of law regulating those writs,
against a judge of a district, statutory county, statutory probate county, or county court in the court of appeals district." Tex. Gov't. Code § 22.221.
These statutory provisions create a clear distinction between the mandamus jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and that of the courts of appeals. While the
Supreme Court's mandamus authority extends broadly to "any officer of state government" (with specified exceptions), the courts of appeals' authority is limited to
specific categories of judges within their districts and to writs necessary to enforce their jurisdiction.
Case Law on Courts of Appeals' Mandamus Jurisdiction
Texas courts have consistently interpreted § 22.221 as limiting the mandamus jurisdiction of the courts of appeals. In In re Cook, 394 S.W.3d 668 (Tex. App.
2012), the court explicitly stated: "By statute, this court's mandamus authority is limited to writs necessary to enforce the jurisdiction of this court and writs against
a judge of a district or county court in our district, or against a judge of a district court acting as a magistrate at a court of inquiry in our district. See Tex. Gov't
Code Ann. § 22.221(a), (b) (West 2004). Therefore, we lack mandamus jurisdiction against a regional presiding judge." This clear statement directly addresses
the question at hand, confirming that courts of appeals lack jurisdiction to issue writs of mandamus against regional presiding judges.
Similarly, in In re Thompson, 330 S.W.3d 411 (Tex. App. 2010), the court acknowledged that it had "no jurisdiction to issue a mandamus against the 'presiding
judge of an administrative judicial region' because the legislature has not bestowed that power upon appellate courts." This reinforces the principle that courts of
appeals cannot issue mandamus against regional presiding judges absent express legislative authorization.
The limitations on courts of appeals' mandamus jurisdiction have been consistently recognized across various contexts. In In re Bayview Loan Servicing, LLC, 
532 S.W.3d 510 (Tex. App. 2017), the court explained: "As an intermediate appellate court, we only have original and appellate jurisdiction to the extent provided 
by law. TEX. CONST. art. V, § 6; In re Meyer, 482 S.W.3d 706, 709 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 2016, orig. proceeding). By statute, our mandamus jurisdiction is 
limited, such that we may issue a writ of mandamus to enforce our own jurisdiction, and against a 'judge of a district or county court in [our] district.' TEX. GOV'T

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
CODE ANN. § 22.221(a), (b) (West 2004)." The court dismissed the mandamus petition for want of jurisdiction because the respondent did not fall within these
categories.
In re Lopez, 286 S.W.3d 408 (Tex. App. 2008) further reinforces this jurisdictional limitation: "The government code does not grant a court of appeals the authority
to issue a writ of mandamus against a regional presiding judge acting in his administrative capacity." This statement directly addresses regional presiding judges,
confirming that courts of appeals lack jurisdiction over them.
The jurisdictional limitations of the courts of appeals have also been addressed in the context of other judicial officers. In Easton v. Franks, 842 S.W.2d 772 (Tex.
App. 1992), the court explained: "Section 22.221(b) expressly limits this Court's jurisdiction to issuing writs 'against a judge of a district or county court in the court
of appeals district.' The statute does not expressly authorize this Court to issue writs of mandamus against a justice of the peace." This illustrates the strict
construction of § 22.221 and the courts' reluctance to expand their mandamus jurisdiction beyond the explicit statutory grant.
Texas Supreme Court's Mandamus Jurisdiction
While courts of appeals have limited mandamus jurisdiction, the Texas Supreme Court possesses broad authority to issue writs of mandamus. In In re Reece,
341 S.W.3d 360 (Tex. 2011), the Supreme Court explained: "Unlike our habeas jurisdiction, our constitutional and statutory grant of mandamus jurisdiction is
broad; this Court possesses general original jurisdiction to issue writs of mandamus. See Tex. Const. art. V, § 3(a) (granting the Court power to issue writs of
mandamus as specified by the Legislature); Tex. Gov't Code § 22.002(a) (permitting the Court to issue writs of mandamus 'agreeable to the principles of law
regulating those writs')."
Deloitte & Touche, LLP v. Fourteenth Court of Appeals, 951 S.W.2d 394 (Tex. 1997) further clarifies the distinction between the Supreme Court's original and
appellate jurisdiction: "Our original jurisdiction for mandamus is not the equivalent of appellate jurisdiction. Compare TEX. GOV'T CODE § 22.002 (defining the
Supreme Court's original jurisdiction for mandamus) with TEX. GOV'T CODE § 22.001 (defining the Supreme Court's appellate jurisdiction)." The court
emphasized that "our mandamus jurisdiction extends to the courts of appeals," indicating the Supreme Court's broad original jurisdiction.
In In re TXU Electric Co., 67 S.W.3d 130 (Tex. 2001), the court reiterated its authority: "The supreme court or a justice of the supreme court may issue writs of
procedendo and certiorari and all writs of quo warranto and mandamus agreeable to the principles of law regulating those writs, against a statutory county court
judge, a statutory probate court judge, a district judge, a court of appeals or a justice of a court of appeals, or any officer of state government except the governor,
the court of criminal appeals, or a judge of the court of criminal appeals." This broad jurisdiction encompasses regional presiding judges as "officers of state
government."
The historical recognition of the Supreme Court's mandamus authority is also evident in Ginsberg v. Fifth Court of Appeals, 686 S.W.2d 105 (Tex. 1985), which
stated: "Tex.Rev.Civ.Stat.Ann. art. 1733 authorizes this court to issue writs of mandamus to appellate courts as well as to other entities. Therefore, this court has
jurisdiction to review the issuance of the writ of mandamus by the court of appeals, to determine if that issuance constituted a clear abuse of discretion." While
referring to a now-recodified statute, this case confirms the Supreme Court's longstanding mandamus authority.
Analysis
Courts of Appeals Lack Jurisdiction Over Regional Presiding Judges
The statutory framework and case law clearly establish that Texas courts of appeals lack jurisdiction to issue writs of mandamus against regional presiding judges
in recusal proceedings. Texas Government Code § 22.221 limits the mandamus jurisdiction of courts of appeals to: (1) writs necessary to enforce the court's
jurisdiction, and (2) writs against judges of district, statutory county, statutory probate county, or county courts within the court's district. Regional presiding judges
do not fall within these categories.
In re Cook, 394 S.W.3d 668 (Tex. App. 2012) directly addresses this issue, explicitly stating that courts of appeals "lack mandamus jurisdiction against a regional
presiding judge." This unambiguous declaration leaves no doubt that courts of appeals cannot entertain mandamus petitions against regional presiding judges,
regardless of the context, including recusal proceedings.
Multiple other cases reinforce this conclusion. In re Lopez, 286 S.W.3d 408 (Tex. App. 2008) specifically states that "the government code does not grant a court
of appeals the authority to issue a writ of mandamus against a regional presiding judge acting in his administrative capacity." Similarly, In re Thompson, 330
S.W.3d 411 (Tex. App. 2010) confirms that appellate courts have "no jurisdiction to issue a mandamus against the 'presiding judge of an administrative judicial
region'" because the legislature has not granted them that power.
These jurisdictional limitations create a situation where parties seeking mandamus relief against a regional presiding judge in a recusal proceeding have no
recourse at the court of appeals level. The court of appeals simply lacks the statutory authority to issue the writ, regardless of the merits of the petition.
Texas Supreme Court's Broad Mandamus Jurisdiction Includes Regional Presiding Judges
In contrast to the limited jurisdiction of the courts of appeals, the Texas Supreme Court possesses broad mandamus authority. Under Texas Government Code §
22.002(a), the Supreme Court may issue writs of mandamus against "any officer of state government" with specific exceptions (the governor, the court of criminal
appeals, and judges of the court of criminal appeals). A regional presiding judge clearly qualifies as an "officer of state government" and does not fall within any of
the enumerated exceptions.
In re TXU Electric Co., 67 S.W.3d 130 (Tex. 2001) confirms the Supreme Court's authority to issue writs of mandamus against various judicial officers and state
government officials. While this case does not specifically mention regional presiding judges, it reaffirms the broad scope of the Supreme Court's mandamus
jurisdiction, which includes "any officer of state government" with limited exceptions.
In re Reece, 341 S.W.3d 360 (Tex. 2011) further emphasizes the breadth of the Supreme Court's mandamus jurisdiction, describing it as "general original
jurisdiction to issue writs of mandamus." The court noted that it possessed this authority under both the Texas Constitution and the Texas Government Code.

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
The combination of the statutory grant of jurisdiction over "any officer of state government" and the Supreme Court's description of its own jurisdiction as "broad"
and "general" indicates that the Supreme Court has the authority to issue writs of mandamus against regional presiding judges, including in recusal proceedings.
Direct Petition to the Texas Supreme Court
Given the court of appeals' lack of jurisdiction over regional presiding judges and the Supreme Court's broad mandamus authority, a direct petition for writ of
mandamus to the Texas Supreme Court is appropriate in cases involving regional presiding judges in recusal proceedings.
However, there is a potential procedural consideration raised by Perry v. Del Rio, 66 S.W.3d 239 (Tex. 2001), where the Supreme Court "denied Weddington's
petition for mandamus because she had not first presented it to the court of appeals." This suggests a general preference for parties to first seek relief from the
court of appeals before petitioning the Supreme Court.
Nevertheless, this procedural requirement logically cannot apply when the court of appeals categorically lacks jurisdiction over the respondent, as is the case with
regional presiding judges. Requiring a party to first petition a court that has no jurisdiction to grant relief would be a futile exercise and contrary to judicial
economy.
The supplementary resource on "Petitions for Writ of Mandamus" supports this analysis, noting that "when review is desired before the entry of a final judgment,
but none of the statutes authorizing an interlocutory appeal apply, appellate court review may be available by filing an original proceeding in a court of appeals or
the Texas Supreme Court petitioning for the issuance of a writ." This indicates that petitioning either court is appropriate, depending on the circumstances.
Standards for Mandamus Relief
While the jurisdictional question is the focus of the analysis, it's worth noting the general standards for mandamus relief. In re State ex rel. Durden, 587 S.W.3d 78
(Tex. App. 2019) explains: "Mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will issue only to correct a clear abuse of discretion when there is no other adequate
remedy at law." The court further noted that while orders denying recusal motions are typically reviewable only on appeal from final judgment, "mandamus review
of an order denying a motion to recuse is available if the grounds for recusal are established as a matter of law."
This suggests that even if jurisdiction is established, a party seeking mandamus relief in a recusal proceeding must still demonstrate that: (1) the regional
presiding judge clearly abused their discretion, and (2) there is no adequate remedy by appeal. In the specific context of recusal proceedings, mandamus may be
available if the grounds for recusal are established as a matter of law.
Exceptions and Caveats
Procedural Requirements
While a direct petition to the Texas Supreme Court is appropriate when the court of appeals lacks jurisdiction, litigants should be aware of potential procedural
requirements. As noted in Perry v. Del Rio, 66 S.W.3d 239 (Tex. 2001), the Supreme Court may have a general preference for parties to first seek relief from the
court of appeals before petitioning the Supreme Court.
However, this preference likely does not apply when the court of appeals categorically lacks jurisdiction over the respondent, as is the case with regional
presiding judges. Requiring a party to first petition a court that has no jurisdiction would serve no practical purpose. Nevertheless, litigants may wish to
acknowledge this issue in their petition to the Supreme Court, explaining why they are bypassing the court of appeals.
Distinguishing Administrative and Judicial Functions
The cases reviewed specifically address regional presiding judges acting in their administrative capacity, which would include handling recusal motions. In re
Lopez, 286 S.W.3d 408 (Tex. App. 2008) explicitly refers to "a regional presiding judge acting in his administrative capacity." This suggests that the jurisdictional
analysis might differ if a regional presiding judge were acting in a non-administrative judicial capacity. However, recusal proceedings are typically considered
administrative matters, so this distinction is unlikely to affect the jurisdictional analysis in the context of recusal proceedings.
Criminal vs. Civil Matters
Some of the cases cited address the distinction between civil and criminal matters, which could potentially affect the jurisdictional analysis. State ex rel. Holmes v.
Honorable Court of Appeals for Third Dist., 885 S.W.2d 389 (Tex. Crim. App. 1994) discusses jurisdictional boundaries between the Texas Supreme Court and
the Court of Criminal Appeals. However, the statutory grant of mandamus jurisdiction to the Texas Supreme Court over "any officer of state government" (with
specific exceptions) applies regardless of whether the underlying matter is civil or criminal, as long as it does not involve the Court of Criminal Appeals or its
judges.
Conclusion
Based on the statutory framework and case law, a direct petition for writ of mandamus to the Texas Supreme Court is appropriate when the court of appeals lacks
mandamus jurisdiction over a regional presiding judge in a recusal proceeding. The Texas Government Code § 22.221 limits the mandamus jurisdiction of courts
of appeals to specific categories of judges that do not include regional presiding judges, and multiple cases have explicitly held that courts of appeals lack
jurisdiction over regional presiding judges.
In contrast, the Texas Supreme Court possesses broad mandamus jurisdiction under Texas Constitution Article V, § 3 and Texas Government Code § 22.002(a),
which extends to "any officer of state government" with limited exceptions. This broad jurisdictional grant encompasses regional presiding judges acting in recusal
proceedings.

While there may be a general preference for parties to first seek relief from the court of appeals before petitioning the Supreme Court, this procedural step is
unnecessary and would be futile when the court of appeals categorically lacks jurisdiction over the respondent. Therefore, when seeking mandamus relief against
a regional presiding judge in a recusal proceeding, a direct petition to the Texas Supreme Court is not only appropriate but necessary to obtain the requested
relief.
Parties pursuing such relief should be prepared to meet the general standards for mandamus, demonstrating a clear abuse of discretion by the regional presiding
judge and the absence of an adequate remedy by appeal. In the specific context of recusal proceedings, they may need to show that the grounds for recusal are
established as a matter of law, as suggested by In re State ex rel. Durden, 587 S.W.3d 78 (Tex. App. 2019).

Texas Supreme Court
Extract
Our original jurisdiction for mandamus is not the equivalent of appellate jurisdiction. Compare TEX. GOV'T CODE § 22.002 (defining the Supreme Court's original
jurisdiction for mandamus) with TEX. GOV'T CODE § 22.001 (defining the Supreme Court's appellate jurisdiction). The Texas Constitution permits the Legislature
to confer original jurisdiction on the Supreme Court to issue writs of mandamus. TEX. CONST. art. 5, § 3. The Legislature has defined this Court's mandamus
jurisdiction as follows: The supreme court or a justice of the supreme court may issue writs of procedendo and certiorari and all writs of quo warranto and
mandamus agreeable to the principles of law regulating those writs, against a statutory county court judge, a statutory probate court judge, a district judge, a court
of appeals or a justice of a court of appeals, or any officer of state government except the governor, the court of criminal appeals, or a judge of the court of
criminal appeals. TEX. GOV'T CODE § 22.002(a) (emphasis added). Thus, our mandamus jurisdiction extends to the courts of appeals.
Summary
The Texas Supreme Court has original jurisdiction to issue writs of mandamus against certain judicial officers and entities, including courts of appeals. This
suggests that the Supreme Court can exercise mandamus jurisdiction even if the court of appeals lacks jurisdiction, as long as the case falls within the defined
scope of the Supreme Court's mandamus authority.
Perkins v. Court of Appeals for Third Supreme Judicial Dist. of Texas, at Austin, 738 S.W.2d 276 (Tex. Crim. App. 1987)
Texas Court of Criminal Appeals
Extract
The court of appeals, in holding that 'under Tex.Gov.Code § 22.221(b), the courts of appeals have mandamus jurisdiction virtually identical to that of the Supreme
Court and the Court of Criminal Appeals [in criminal law matters]' was prescient as to what this Court would eventually hold when it decided the question whether
the courts of appeals, in criminal cases, had authority to issue writs of mandamus. In Dickens v. Second Court of Appeals, 727 S.W.2d 542 (Tex.Cr.App.1987), a
majority of this Court held that 'courts of appeals, pursuant to § 22.221(b) [of the Government Code], have mandamus jurisdiction over criminal law matters
concurrent with the mandamus jurisdiction of this Court.'
Summary
The courts of appeals in Texas have mandamus jurisdiction over criminal law matters that is concurrent with the jurisdiction of the Texas Supreme Court and the
Court of Criminal Appeals. This suggests that if a court of appeals lacks jurisdiction over a particular matter, such as a recusal proceeding involving a regional
presiding judge, it may not be appropriate to directly petition the Texas Supreme Court for a writ of mandamus unless the matter falls within the concurrent
jurisdiction. The passage does not directly address the specific scenario of a recusal proceeding, but it provides insight into the general jurisdictional framework.
Johnson v. Tenth Jud. Dist. Ct of Appeals, 280 S.W.3d 866 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008)

Extract
We note that '[t]he Legislature may confer original jurisdiction on the Supreme Court to issue writs of ... mandamus in such cases as may be specified, except

mandamus against a court of appeals, 'agreeable to the principles of law regulating those writs[.]' TEX. GOV'T CODE, § 22.002(a).
Summary
The Texas Supreme Court has the authority to issue writs of mandamus in cases specified by the Legislature, except against the Governor. This suggests that
the Supreme Court can have original jurisdiction in certain mandamus proceedings, potentially including those where the court of appeals lacks jurisdiction.

Specifically, the court decided that it had no jurisdiction to issue a mandamus against the 'presiding judge of an administrative judicial region' because the

Summary
Appellate courts in Texas do not have jurisdiction to issue writs of mandamus against a presiding judge of an administrative judicial region unless the legislature
has explicitly granted such power. This suggests that if the court of appeals lacks jurisdiction, a direct petition to the Texas Supreme Court might be necessary, as
the appellate court cannot provide the relief sought.
Dickens v. Court of Appeals For Second Supreme Judicial Dist. of Texas, 727 S.W.2d 542 (Tex. Crim. App. 1987)
Texas Court of Criminal Appeals
Extract
The Supreme Court of Texas has adopted the clear abuse of discretion standard for reviewing the mandamus action of a court of appeals in civil cases. Ginsberg
v. Second Court of Appeals, 686 S.W.2d 105, 107 (Tex.1985). Discarding the traditional requirement that a ministerial act be the focal point of the trial court's
action before mandamus may issue, the Court held that it had 'jurisdiction to review the issuance of the writ of mandamus by the court of appeals, to determine if
that issuance constituted a clear abuse of discretion.'
Summary
The Texas Supreme Court has jurisdiction to review the issuance of writs of mandamus by the court of appeals to determine if there was a clear abuse of
discretion. This suggests that the Texas Supreme Court can directly review mandamus actions from the court of appeals, especially when there is a question of
jurisdiction or abuse of discretion. This is relevant to the question of whether a direct petition to the Texas Supreme Court is appropriate when the court of
appeals lacks jurisdiction.
Union Pacific Resources Co., In re, 969 S.W.2d 427 (Tex. 1998)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
The court of appeals abused its discretion by issuing writ of mandamus when the complaining party has an adequate remedy by appeal. See TEX.R. CIV. P.
18a(f); see also Thomas v. Walker, 860 S.W.2d at 581. We therefore conditionally grant the petition for writ of mandamus and direct the court of appeals to
withdraw its order conditionally granting writ of mandamus against the trial court. TEX. GOV'T CODE § 22.002(a).
Summary
The Texas Supreme Court found that the court of appeals abused its discretion by issuing a writ of mandamus when there was an adequate remedy by appeal.
This suggests that a direct petition for writ of mandamus to the Texas Supreme Court may not be appropriate if there is an adequate remedy by appeal, even if
the court of appeals lacks jurisdiction over a regional presiding judge in a recusal proceeding.

Texas Court of Criminal Appeals
Extract
Moreover, the possibility that Graham's case might pass its entire appellate lifespan in 'the civil courts' is an equally transparent bit of fiction. In the first place, the
Third Court of Appeals is not a civil court. As already noted, its jurisdiction extends both to civil and to criminal cases. Thus, the only 'civil court' to which an
appeal of Graham's case might finally come is the Supreme Court of Texas. Yet, because a majority of this Court seems convinced that the case involves criminal
law matters, it conversely must be convinced that the Supreme Court lacks jurisdiction of it. Accordingly, the majority's own process of reasoning makes it clear
that Graham's case must either come to this Court eventually or expire in the Third Court of Appeals.
Summary
Jurisdictional boundaries between the Texas Supreme Court and the Court of Criminal Appeals, particularly in cases that may involve both civil and criminal law 
matters. It highlights the complexity of determining jurisdiction when a case could potentially be seen as involving criminal law, which would typically fall outside 
the Texas Supreme Court's jurisdiction. This is relevant to the question of whether a direct petition for writ of mandamus to the Texas Supreme Court is

appropriate, as it underscores the importance of correctly identifying the nature of the case (civil vs. criminal) to determine the appropriate court for mandamus
relief.
In re Txu Electric Co., 67 S.W.3d 130 (Tex. 2001)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
The supreme court or a justice of the supreme court may issue writs of procedendo and certiorari and all writs of quo warranto and mandamus agreeable to the
principles of law regulating those writs, against a statutory county court judge, a statutory probate court judge, a district judge, a court of appeals or a justice of a
court of appeals, or any officer of state government except the governor, the court of criminal appeals, or a judge of the court of criminal appeals.
Summary
The Texas Supreme Court has the authority to issue writs of mandamus against certain judicial officers and state government officers, excluding specific
high-level positions such as the governor and judges of the court of criminal appeals. This suggests that if a regional presiding judge in a recusal proceeding falls
under the category of "any officer of state government" or similar judicial officers, the Texas Supreme Court may have jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandamus
directly.

Under the second prong, the Court concludes that we must grant mandamus relief here because 'the trial court's denial of Prudential's contractual right to have
the Secchis waive a jury [cannot] be rectified on appeal.' 148 S.W.3d at 138. I, of course, agree that an appellate remedy is inadequate if it comes too late to cure
the trial court's error. Walker, 827 S.W.2d at 843. As we have said, a party establishes that its appellate remedy is inadequate by showing that it is in real danger
of permanently losing its substantial rights. Perry v. Del Rio, 66 S.W.3d 239, 257 (Tex.2001); Walker, 827 S.W.2d at 842; Canadian Helicopters, Ltd. v. Wittig, 876
S.W.2d 304, 306 (Tex.1994).
Summary
Conditions under which mandamus relief is appropriate, specifically when an appellate remedy is inadequate. This is relevant to the question of whether a direct
petition for writ of mandamus to the Texas Supreme Court is appropriate when the court of appeals lacks jurisdiction, as it highlights the circumstances under
which the Texas Supreme Court may consider granting mandamus relief.

The supreme court or a justice of the supreme court may issue writs of procedendo and certiorari and all writ of quo warranto and mandamus agreeable to the
principles of law regulating those writs, against a district judge, a court of appeals or a justice of a court of appeals, or any officer of state government except the
governor, the court of criminal appeals, or a judge of the court of criminal appeals. Tex. Gov't Code § 22.002(a).
Summary
The passage from the Texas Government Code § 22.002(a) indicates that the Texas Supreme Court has the authority to issue writs of mandamus against certain
judicial officers and state officers, excluding specific high-level positions such as the governor and judges of the court of criminal appeals. This suggests that if a
regional presiding judge in a recusal proceeding is considered an "officer of state government," the Texas Supreme Court may have jurisdiction to issue a writ of
mandamus directly.

Unlike our habeas jurisdiction, our constitutional and statutory grant of mandamus jurisdiction is broad; this Court possesses general original jurisdiction to issue

our mandamus jurisdiction, we conclude mandamus is an appropriate remedy for Reece's unlawful confinement.
Summary
The Texas Supreme Court has broad constitutional and statutory authority to issue writs of mandamus. The court found no statutory limitations preventing it from
granting relief in the case of Reece, suggesting that a direct petition for writ of mandamus to the Texas Supreme Court is appropriate when the court of appeals
lacks jurisdiction, as long as the circumstances warrant such an exercise of jurisdiction.

App.—Tyler 2012, orig. proceeding). In pertinent part, section 22.221 provides that we may issue writs of mandamus and 'all other writs necessary to enforce the
jurisdiction of the court.' See TEX. GOV'T CODE ANN. § 22.221(a). This section also provides that we may issue writs of mandamus against 'a judge of a district
or county court in the court of appeals' district,' or against a judge of a district court who is acting as a magistrate at a court of inquiry in the court of appeals'
district. See id. § 22.221(b).
Summary
Jurisdictional limits of the Texas courts of appeals concerning writs of mandamus. It specifies that the courts of appeals can issue writs of mandamus against
judges of district or county courts within their district or against a district court judge acting as a magistrate at a court of inquiry within their district. This implies
that if a regional presiding judge in a recusal proceeding does not fall within these categories, the court of appeals may lack jurisdiction to issue a writ of
mandamus. Consequently, if the court of appeals lacks jurisdiction, a direct petition to the Texas Supreme Court might be appropriate.

Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Article V, section 6 of the Texas Constitution, which delineates the appellate jurisdiction of the intermediate courts of appeals, provides that the courts of appeals
have original jurisdiction as prescribed by law. TEX. CONST. art. V, § 6. Section 22.221(a) of the Government Code authorizes this court to issue a writ of
mandamus in order to enforce our jurisdiction. TEX. GOV'T CODE ANN. § 22.221(a) (West Supp. 2019). We may also issue a writ of mandamus against 'a judge
of a district, statutory county, statutory probate county, or county court'; 'a judge of a district court who is acting as a magistrate at a court of inquiry'; or 'an
associate judge of a district or county court appointed by a judge under Chapter 201, Family Code,' so long as those judges are in our district. Id. § 22.221(b).
Summary
Jurisdictional limits of the Texas courts of appeals concerning issuing writs of mandamus. It specifies that the courts of appeals can issue such writs to enforce
their jurisdiction and against certain judges within their district. However, it does not mention regional presiding judges or recusal proceedings, which suggests
that the courts of appeals may not have jurisdiction in such cases. This implies that if the court of appeals lacks jurisdiction, a direct petition to the Texas Supreme
Court might be necessary.
In re Morales
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The main source of original jurisdiction for the courts of appeals is provided by § 22.221 of the Texas Government Code. ... In pertinent part, this section provides
that an intermediate appellate court may issue writs of mandamus against specified judges in its district and 'all other writs necessary to enforce the jurisdiction of
the court.' ... The Court, having examined and fully considered the petition for writ of mandamus, is of the opinion that we lack jurisdiction over this original
proceeding. Relator seeks mandamus relief against the judge of the 390th District Court of Travis County. However, Travis County is not located within the
geographic district for the Thirteenth Court of Appeals and is instead located within the geographic district for the Third Court of Appeals. ... Thus, we lack
jurisdiction to issue a writ against the judge of the 390th District Court of Travis County.
Summary

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
The passage explains that the Texas Government Code § 22.221 provides the jurisdictional basis for appellate courts to issue writs of mandamus. It specifies that
appellate courts can issue such writs against judges within their geographic district. The passage illustrates a situation where the Thirteenth Court of Appeals
lacked jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandamus because the judge in question was outside its geographic district. This implies that when an appellate court lacks
jurisdiction, a direct petition to a higher court, such as the Texas Supreme Court, may be necessary.

relief that he requests is necessary to enforce our appellate jurisdiction.
Summary
The Texas Court of Appeals does not have jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandamus against a justice of the peace unless it is necessary to enforce the court's
appellate jurisdiction. This suggests that if the court of appeals lacks jurisdiction, a direct petition to a higher court, such as the Texas Supreme Court, might be
considered, especially if the issue involves a regional presiding judge in a recusal proceeding.
In re Scott, No. 11-21-00012-CR, No. 11-21-00013-CR (Tex. App. Jan 29, 2021)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
This court's mandamus jurisdiction is governed by Section 22.221 of the Texas Government Code. See TEX. GOV'T CODE ANN. § 22.221 (West Supp. 2020).
Section 22.221 expressly limits the mandamus jurisdiction of the courts of appeals to (1) writs against a judge of a district or county court in the court of appeals'
district, (2) writs against a district judge acting as a magistrate in a court of inquiry in the court of appeals' district, and (3) writs necessary to enforce the court of
appeals' jurisdiction. Id. We have no authority to issue a writ of mandamus against a municipal court judge or a municipal court clerk unless it is necessary to
enforce our jurisdiction.
Summary
Specific jurisdictional limits of the Texas courts of appeals concerning writs of mandamus. It indicates that the courts of appeals do not have jurisdiction to issue
writs of mandamus against municipal court judges or clerks unless it is necessary to enforce their jurisdiction. This implies that if the court of appeals lacks
jurisdiction, a direct petition to the Texas Supreme Court might be considered, as the court of appeals cannot act outside its jurisdictional boundaries.

Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Article V, Section 6 of the Texas Constitution delineates the appellate jurisdiction of the courts of appeals, and states that the courts of appeals 'shall have such
other jurisdiction, original and appellate, as may be prescribed by law.' TEX. CONST. art. V, § 6(a); see In re Bayview Loan Servicing, LLC, 532 S.W.3d 510, 511
(Tex. App.—Texarkana 2017, orig. proceeding). This Court's original jurisdiction is governed by § 22.221 of the Texas Government Code. See TEX. GOV'T
CODE ANN. § 22.221; see also In re Cook, 394 S.W.3d 668, 671 (Tex. App.—Tyler 2012, orig. proceeding). In pertinent part, this section provides that we may
issue writs of mandamus and 'all other writs necessary to enforce the jurisdiction of the court.' TEX. GOV'T CODE ANN. § 22.221(a). This section also provides
that we may issue writs of mandamus against: (1) a judge of a district, statutory county, statutory probate county, or county court in the court of appeals district;
(2) a judge of a district court who is acting as a magistrate at a court of inquiry under Chapter 52 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in the court of appeals district;
or (3) an associate judge of a district or county court appointed by a judge under Chapter 201 of the Family Code in the court of appeals district for the judge who
appointed the associate judge. See id. § 22.221(b).
Summary
Jurisdictional limits of the Texas courts of appeals concerning writs of mandamus, specifically under § 22.221 of the Texas Government Code. It clarifies that the
courts of appeals can issue writs of mandamus against certain judges within their district but does not extend this jurisdiction to regional presiding judges outside
their district. This implies that if a court of appeals lacks jurisdiction over a regional presiding judge, a direct petition to the Texas Supreme Court might be
necessary.
In re Lopez, 286 S.W.3d 408 (Tex. App. 2008)

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The government code does not grant a court of appeals the authority to issue a writ of mandamus against a regional presiding judge acting in his administrative
capacity. See id.; Torres, 130 S.W.3d at 414; Hettler, 110 S.W.3d at 155.
Summary
The Texas Government Code does not provide courts of appeals with the authority to issue writs of mandamus against regional presiding judges when they are
acting in their administrative capacity. This suggests that if a court of appeals lacks jurisdiction in such cases, a direct petition to the Texas Supreme Court may
be appropriate, as the court of appeals cannot provide the necessary relief.
In re Garcia, NUMBER 13-18-00651-CV (Tex. App. Nov 28, 2018)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Relators' petition seeks mandamus relief against a justice of the peace. This Court does not have jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandamus against a justice of the
peace. See id.; In re Meyer, 482 S.W.3d 706, 709 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 2016, orig. proceeding); In re Smith, 355 S.W.3d 901, 901 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 2011,
orig. proceeding) (per curiam); Easton v. Franks, 842 S.W.2d 772, 773-74 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1992, orig. proceeding) (per curiam). Further, relators
have not demonstrated that the requested relief is necessary to enforce our jurisdiction.
Summary
The Texas Court of Appeals does not have jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandamus against a justice of the peace. This suggests that if a court of appeals lacks
jurisdiction over a particular judicial officer, such as a regional presiding judge in a recusal proceeding, it may not be able to issue a writ of mandamus. This
implies that a direct petition to a higher court, such as the Texas Supreme Court, might be necessary if the lower appellate court lacks jurisdiction.
In re State ex rel. Durden, 587 S.W.3d 78 (Tex. App. 2019)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will issue only to correct a clear abuse of discretion when there is no other adequate remedy at law. In re Sw. Bell Tel.
Co., L.P., 235 S.W.3d 619, 623 (Tex. 2007) (orig. proceeding). 'A trial court has no ‘discretion’ in determining what the law is or applying the law to the facts.
Thus, a clear failure by the trial court to analyze or apply the law correctly will constitute an abuse of discretion, and may result in appellate reversal by
extraordinary writ.' Walker v. Packer, 827 S.W.2d 833, 840 (Tex. 1992) (orig. proceeding). 'An order denying a motion to recuse may be reviewed only for abuse
of discretion on appeal from the final judgment.' TEX. R. CIV. P. 18a(j)(1)(A). However, mandamus review of an order denying a motion to recuse is available if
the grounds for recusal are established as a matter of law. See De Leon v. Aguilar, 127 S.W.3d 1, 6-7 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004) (orig. proceeding) (holding general
rule that party has adequate remedy by appeal from recusal order does not apply when respondent's bias is established as a matter of law).
Summary
Conditions under which a mandamus petition is appropriate, specifically in the context of recusal proceedings. It highlights that mandamus is an extraordinary
remedy used to correct a clear abuse of discretion when no other adequate remedy exists. It also notes that while orders denying recusal are typically reviewed
on appeal, mandamus is available if recusal grounds are established as a matter of law. This implies that if the court of appeals lacks jurisdiction, a direct petition
to the Texas Supreme Court might be appropriate under these conditions.
Easton v. Franks, 842 S.W.2d 772 (Tex. App. 1992)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Section 22.221(a), (b) of the Texas Government Code governs the Court of Appeals' jurisdiction to issue writs of mandamus: (a) Each court of appeals ... may
issue a writ of mandamus and all other writs necessary to enforce the jurisdiction of the court. (b) Each court of appeals for a court of appeals district may issue
all writs of mandamus, agreeable to the principles of law regulating those writs, against a judge of a district or county court in the court of appeals district.
TEX.GOV'T CODE ANN. § 22.221(a), (b) (Vernon 1988) (emphasis added). This Court's power to issue a writ of mandamus under section 22.221(a) is not an
issue because relator does not contend that the respondent has interfered with this Court's jurisdiction. The question is whether we may issue a writ of
mandamus under section 22.221(b) to a justice of the peace. We hold that we may not. First, section 22.221(b) expressly limits this Court's jurisdiction to issuing
writs 'against a judge of a district or county court in the court of appeals district.' The statute does not expressly authorize this Court to issue writs of mandamus
against a justice of the peace.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
The Texas Court of Appeals does not have jurisdiction to issue writs of mandamus against a justice of the peace, as its jurisdiction is limited to judges of district or
county courts within its district. This implies that if a court of appeals lacks jurisdiction over a particular judge, such as a regional presiding judge in a recusal
proceeding, a direct petition to a higher court, like the Texas Supreme Court, may be necessary.
In re Smith, 355 S.W.3d 901 (Tex. App. 2011)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Section 22.221 of the Texas Government Code authorizes a court of appeals to issue writs of mandamus necessary to enforce its jurisdiction or against a judge
of a district or county court in the court of appeals' district. Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 22.221(a),(b) (West 2004). Here, relators do not argue nor have they shown
that the relief their petition seeks is necessary to enforce our jurisdiction. And we lack independent authority to issue a writ of mandamus against a justice of the
peace.
Summary
The Texas courts of appeals have limited jurisdiction to issue writs of mandamus, specifically only when necessary to enforce their jurisdiction or against certain
judges within their district. The passage also clarifies that the court of appeals lacks independent authority to issue a writ of mandamus against a justice of the
peace, which implies a limitation in their jurisdiction over certain judicial officers.
Ginsberg v. Fifth Court of Appeals, 686 S.W.2d 105 (Tex. 1985)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
The proceeding in this court is an original mandamus proceeding. Tex.Rev.Civ.Stat.Ann. art. 1733 authorizes this court to issue writs of mandamus to appellate
courts as well as to other entities. Therefore, this court has jurisdiction to review the issuance of the writ of mandamus by the court of appeals, to determine if that
issuance constituted a clear abuse of discretion.
Summary
The Texas Supreme Court has the authority to issue writs of mandamus to appellate courts and other entities, as per Tex.Rev.Civ.Stat.Ann. art. 1733. This
suggests that the Texas Supreme Court can directly address issues where a lower court, such as a court of appeals, may lack jurisdiction, including in cases
involving regional presiding judges in recusal proceedings.
In re Bayview Loan Servicing, LLC, 532 S.W.3d 510 (Tex. App. 2017)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Because we do not have jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandamus against the respondent in this case, we dismiss Bayview's request for mandamus relief for want
of jurisdiction. As an intermediate appellate court, we only have original and appellate jurisdiction to the extent provided by law. TEX. CONST. art. V, § 6 ; In re
Meyer, 482 S.W.3d 706, 709 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 2016, orig. proceeding). By statute, our mandamus jurisdiction is limited, such that we may issue a writ of
mandamus to enforce our own jurisdiction, and against a 'judge of a district or county court in [our] district.' TEX. GOV'T CODE ANN. § 22.221(a), (b) (West
2004).
Summary
The Texas Court of Appeals has limited jurisdiction to issue writs of mandamus, specifically against judges of district or county courts within their district, and only
to enforce their own jurisdiction. This implies that if the court of appeals lacks jurisdiction over a particular judge, such as a regional presiding judge in a recusal
proceeding, a direct petition to the Texas Supreme Court may be appropriate, as the Supreme Court has broader mandamus jurisdiction.
In re Cook, 394 S.W.3d 668 (Tex. App. 2012)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract

=== PAGE 11 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
By statute, this court's mandamus authority is limited to writs necessary to enforce the jurisdiction of this court and writs against a judge of a district or county
court in our district, or against a judge of a district court acting as a magistrate at a court of inquiry in our district. SeeTex. Gov't Code Ann. § 22.221(a), (b) (West
2004). Therefore, we lack mandamus jurisdiction against a regional presiding judge.
Summary
The Texas Court of Appeals does not have mandamus jurisdiction over a regional presiding judge. This implies that if a party seeks a writ of mandamus against a
regional presiding judge, the court of appeals is not the appropriate venue. This lack of jurisdiction suggests that a direct petition to the Texas Supreme Court
might be necessary if the issue involves a regional presiding judge, as the court of appeals cannot provide the relief sought.
In re Meyer, 482 S.W.3d 706 (Tex. App. 2016)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Under the limited mandamus jurisdiction provided this Court by law, we may issue a writ of mandamus only against a 'judge of a district or county court in [our]
district.' See TEX. GOV'T CODE ANN. § 22.221(b) (West 2004). ... A court of appeals may issue a writ of mandamus to other parties when 'necessary to enforce
the jurisdiction of' that Court. Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 22.221(a) (West 2004). Because this case does not involve the issuance of a writ of mandamus to 'enforce
the jurisdiction of' this Court, our decision in this case is limited to our power to issue a writ of mandamus under Section 22.221(b).
Summary
Texas intermediate appellate courts have limited mandamus jurisdiction, specifically over judges of district or county courts within their district, as per TEX.
GOV'T CODE ANN. § 22.221(b). Additionally, they can issue writs of mandamus to enforce their jurisdiction under § 22.221(a). However, the passage indicates
that the court's decision is limited to its power under Section 22.221(b), suggesting that if a court of appeals lacks jurisdiction over a particular judge, such as a
regional presiding judge, it cannot issue a writ of mandamus. This implies that if the court of appeals lacks jurisdiction, a direct petition to the Texas Supreme
Court might be necessary.
Perry v. Del Rio, 66 S.W.3d 239, 44 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 1147 (Tex. 2001)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
Defendant Weddington, believing that she was not entitled to appeal, petitioned this Court for review by mandamus. We denied Weddington's petition for
mandamus because she had not first presented it to the court of appeals.
Summary
The Texas Supreme Court denied a petition for mandamus because the petitioner had not first presented the issue to the court of appeals. This suggests that,
generally, a direct petition for writ of mandamus to the Texas Supreme Court is not appropriate if the petitioner has not first sought relief from the court of appeals,
even if the court of appeals lacks jurisdiction. The procedural requirement to first approach the court of appeals is emphasized.
Tex. Const. art. 5 § 3 Tex. Const. art. 5 § 3 Jurisdiction of Supreme Court; Writs; Clerk
Extract
The Supreme Court and the Justices thereof shall have power to issue writs of habeas corpus, as may be prescribed by law, and under such regulations as may
be prescribed by law, the said courts and the Justices thereof may issue the writs of mandamus, procedendo, certiorari and such other writs, as may be
necessary to enforce its jurisdiction. The Legislature may confer original jurisdiction on the Supreme Court to issue writs of quo warranto and mandamus in such
cases as may be specified, except as against the Governor of the State.
Summary
The Texas Supreme Court has the power to issue writs of mandamus as necessary to enforce its jurisdiction. Additionally, the Legislature may confer original
jurisdiction on the Supreme Court to issue writs of mandamus in specified cases. This suggests that if the court of appeals lacks jurisdiction, the Texas Supreme
Court may have the authority to directly issue a writ of mandamus, provided it is necessary to enforce its jurisdiction and is within the scope specified by the
Legislature.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Each court of appeals or a justice of a court of appeals may issue a writ of mandamus and all other writs necessary to enforce the jurisdiction of the court. Subject
to Subsection (c-1), each court of appeals for a court of appeals district may issue all writs of mandamus, agreeable to the principles of law regulating those writs,
against a judge of a district, statutory county, statutory probate county, or county court in the court of appeals district.
Summary
Jurisdiction of the courts of appeals in Texas to issue writs of mandamus. It specifies that courts of appeals can issue writs against judges of district, statutory
county, statutory probate county, or county courts within their district. However, it does not mention regional presiding judges or recusal proceedings, which
suggests that the courts of appeals may not have jurisdiction in such cases. This implies that if the court of appeals lacks jurisdiction, a direct petition to the Texas
Supreme Court might be appropriate.
Tex. Gov't. Code § 22.002 Tex. Gov't. Code § 22.002 Writ Power
Extract
The supreme court or a justice of the supreme court may issue writs of procedendo and certiorari and all writs of quo warranto and mandamus agreeable to the
principles of law regulating those writs, against a statutory county court judge, a statutory probate court judge, a district judge, a court of appeals or a justice of a
court of appeals, or any officer of state government except the governor, the court of criminal appeals, or a judge of the court of criminal appeals.
Summary
The Texas Supreme Court has the authority to issue writs of mandamus against various judicial officers and entities, including statutory county court judges,
statutory probate court judges, district judges, courts of appeals, and justices of courts of appeals. This authority extends to any officer of state government, with
specific exceptions noted. The passage does not explicitly mention regional presiding judges in recusal proceedings, but it does suggest that the Supreme Court
has broad writ power over judicial officers and state government officers, which could potentially include regional presiding judges if they fall under the category of
"any officer of state government."
CHAPTER 6 Petitions for Writ of Mandamus
Practitioner's Guide to Civil Appeals in Texas - Full Court Press
Extract
In the Texas state court system, when review is desired before the entry of a final judgment, but none of the statutes authorizing an interlocutory appeal apply,
appellate court review may be available by filing an original proceeding in a court of appeals or the Texas Supreme Court petitioning for the issuance of a writ. ...
The mandamus jurisdiction of the court of appeals is set forth in section 22.221 of the Texas Government Code. ... Section 22.002(a) of the Texas Government
Code confers jurisdiction on the Supreme Court to issue writs of mandamus against a statutory county court judge, a statutory probate court judge, a district
judge, a court of appeals or a justice of a court of appeals, or any officer of state government except the governor, the court of criminal appeals, or a judge of the
court of criminal appeals.
Summary
Jurisdictional boundaries for filing a writ of mandamus in Texas. It specifies that the Texas Supreme Court has jurisdiction to issue writs of mandamus against
certain judges and officers of state government, while the courts of appeals have more limited jurisdiction. This suggests that if a court of appeals lacks
jurisdiction over a regional presiding judge in a recusal proceeding, a direct petition to the Texas Supreme Court may be appropriate, as the Supreme Court has
broader jurisdictional authority.
