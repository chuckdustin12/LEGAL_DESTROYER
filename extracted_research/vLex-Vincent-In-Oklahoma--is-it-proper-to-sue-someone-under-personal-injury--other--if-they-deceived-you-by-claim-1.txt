Question
In Oklahoma, is it proper to sue someone under personal injury (other) if
they deceived you by claiming they wanted to help you, but instead invited
your wife to their house and assisted her in filing fraudulent divorce
paperwork?
Answer (Oklahoma)
Short response
Yes, in Oklahoma, it would be proper to sue someone under personal injury
(other) for deceit if they intentionally misled you by falsely claiming to help
while instead assisting your wife with filing fraudulent divorce paperwork.
Oklahoma law provides statutory grounds for recovery under Title 76,
Sections 2 and 3, which establish liability for willful deception that causes
injury.
Summary
Oklahoma law provides multiple legal avenues for pursuing a personal injury
claim against someone who deceived you by claiming to offer help but
instead assisted your wife in filing fraudulent divorce paperwork. The
primary basis for such a claim would be statutory deceit under Title 76,
Sections 2 and 3 of the Oklahoma Statutes, which explicitly establish
liability for anyone who "willfully deceives another, with intent to induce him
to alter his position to his injury or risk." The statutes define deceit broadly
to include false suggestions or assertions, suppression of facts when there is
a duty to disclose, and promises made without intention of performing.
Additionally, Oklahoma case law supports emotional distress damages in
cases involving deceit, even without physical injury, when the emotional
distress is a natural and probable consequence of the deceptive conduct.
Furthermore, depending on the severity of the conduct, the plaintiff might
also pursue claims for constructive fraud or intentional infliction of
emotional distress if the behavior was extreme and outrageous. The facts
presented—where someone misrepresented their intentions to help while
secretly assisting with fraudulent divorce paperwork—appear to satisfy the
elements of actionable fraud under Oklahoma law, which includes material
false representations made with knowledge of their falsity or reckless
disregard for the truth, with the intention that they be acted upon, resulting
in reliance and injury.
Background and Relevant Legislation
Oklahoma has enacted specific statutes addressing deceit and fraud that
provide a statutory basis for claims arising from deceptive conduct. These

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
statutory provisions establish both the liability for deceit and define what
constitutes deceitful conduct under Oklahoma law.
Statutory Basis for Deceit Claims
Oklahoma Statutes Title 76, Section 2 explicitly provides for damages
resulting from deceit: "One who willfully deceives another, with intent to
induce him to alter his position to his injury or risk, is liable for any damage
which he thereby suffers." Okla. Stat. tit. 76, § 2 (2025). This statute
establishes the fundamental principle that intentional deception causing
injury creates liability.
The Oklahoma Supreme Court has recognized this statutory basis for deceit
claims. In Cooper v. Parker-Hughey, 894 P.2d 1096, 1995 OK 35 (Okla.
1995), the Court explicitly stated: "Title 76 O.S.1981, § 2, permits one
damaged by another's deceit to receive damages. It provides: 'One who
willfully deceives another, with intent to induce him to alter his position to
his injury or risk, is liable for any damage which he thereby suffers.'"
Similarly, in State ex rel. Southwestern Bell Tel. Co. v. Brown, 519 P.2d 491,
1974 OK 19 (Okla. 1974), the Court reaffirmed: "76 O.S.1971, § 2 provides
that one who wilfully deceives another, with intent to induce him to alter his
position to his injury or risk, is liable for any damage which he thereby
suffers."
Definition of Deceit
Oklahoma Statutes Title 76, Section 3 defines what constitutes deceit under
the law:
"A deceit, within the meaning of the last section is either:
The suggestion, as a fact, of that which is not true by one who does not
believe it to be true.
The assertion, as a fact, of that which is not true, by one who has no
reasonable ground for believing it to be true.
The suppression of a fact by one who is bound to disclose it, or who
gives information of other facts which are likely to mislead for want of
communication of that fact; or,
A promise, made without any intention of performing." Okla. Stat. tit.
76, § 3 (2025).
This statute broadly defines deceit to include various forms of
misrepresentations and false promises. In the scenario presented, if
someone claimed they wanted to help but instead intended to assist with
fraudulent divorce paperwork, this could constitute deceit under subsections
1, 2, or 4, depending on the specific circumstances.
Additional Statutory Provisions
Oklahoma law also extends liability for deceit to those who intend to defraud
classes of persons. Under Okla. Stat. tit. 76, § 4 (2025): "One who practices
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
a deceit with intent to defraud the public, or a particular class of persons, is
deemed to have intended to defraud every individual in that class, who is
actually misled by the deceit." This provision could be relevant if the
defendant has engaged in similar deceptive practices with others.
Furthermore, Oklahoma recognizes constructive fraud under Okla. Stat. tit.
15, § 59 (2025), which consists of:
"1. In any breach of duty which, without an actually fraudulent intent, gains
an advantage to the person in fault, or any one claiming under him, by
misleading another to his prejudice, or to the prejudice of any one claiming
under him; or,
2. In any such act or omission as the law specially declares to be fraudulent,
without respect to actual fraud."
This provision may be relevant if the person who deceived you gained an
advantage by misleading you, even without proving actual fraudulent intent.
Finally, the Oklahoma Deceptive Trade Practices Act under Okla. Stat. tit.
78, § 54 (2025) provides that: "Any person damaged or likely to be damaged
by a deceptive trade practice of another may maintain an action in any court
of equitable jurisdiction to prevent, restrain or enjoin such deceptive trade
practice. Proof of actual monetary damages, loss of profits or intent shall not
be required." This could provide an additional avenue for relief if the
deceptive conduct could be characterized as a deceptive trade practice.
Relevant Case Law on Deceit and Fraud
Oklahoma courts have established clear precedent regarding the elements
of fraud and the availability of recovery for deceit under personal injury
theories.
Elements of Actionable Fraud
The Oklahoma Supreme Court outlined the essential elements of actionable
fraud in Lenn v. Miller, 403 P.2d 458, 1965 OK 86 (Okla. 1965): "The
elements of actionable fraud are material, false representations made with
knowledge of their falsity, or recklessly made without knowledge of their
truth and as a positive assertion, with intention they be acted upon by
another, and relied thereon by another party to his injury."
Applying these elements to the scenario described:
Material, false representations: The claim to want to help when
intending to assist with fraudulent divorce paperwork
Knowledge of falsity: Knowing the true intention was to assist the
spouse
Intention for reliance: Intending for you to believe the offer of help
was genuine
Actual reliance: Your trust in the person based on their representation
Resulting injury: The harm caused by the fraudulent divorce
paperwork

Recovery for Emotional Distress in Deceit Cases
Oklahoma courts have recognized that emotional distress damages can be
recovered in cases involving deceit, even without physical injury. In 
Worsham v. Nix, 2004 OK CIV APP 2, 83 P.3d 879 (Okla. Civ. App. 2003), the
Court of Civil Appeals stated: "Moreover, in the absence of a physical injury,
'emotional distress caused by a willful, actionable tort is recoverable ... if it
is the natural and probable consequence of the tortious act.'" The court
specifically noted that "deceit would support a claim for emotional distress
damages" and that "fraud in inducing one to enter into a bigamous marriage
would support a claim for emotional distress damages."
This precedent is particularly relevant to the scenario described, as
deception regarding assistance with divorce paperwork would likely cause
significant emotional distress to the deceived spouse.
Potential for Punitive Damages
In cases of intentional fraud, Oklahoma law potentially allows for punitive
damages. In Rogers v. Meiser, 2003 OK 6, 68 P.3d 967, 977 (Okla. 2003), the
court noted: "There is no doubt a common law claim for actual fraud is a
type of claim that holds the potential for properly falling under one or more
of the specified provisions of § 9.1. See Z.D. Howard Company v. Cartwright,
1975 OK 89, 537 P.2d 345 (recognizing punitive damages may be recovered
where a defendant has engaged in wanton, malicious and intentional
fraudulent acts)."
It is important to note that Rogers v. Meiser was superseded by statute as
recognized in Musket Corp. v. Star Fuel of Okla., LLC, No. 13-6133, No.
13-6146 (10th Cir. Apr 06, 2015). However, the basic principle that punitive
damages may be available for intentional fraudulent acts remains valid,
although the specific requirements and limitations for such damages may
have been modified by the superseding statute.
Historical Recognition of Deceit Claims
The Oklahoma Supreme Court has long recognized deceit as a basis for
recovery. In Nutt v. Carson, 340 P.2d 260 (Okla. 1959), the court
acknowledged: "Plaintiff's general allegations are that her injuries and
disabilities are directly and proximately caused by the deceitful and
fraudulent acts of defendant, and refers to Tile 76 O.S.1951 §§ 2 and 3,
relating to damages for deceit. Although our laws relating to damages for
fraud and deceit may in some respect enlarge the common-law right of
action, the same still rests upon fraud."
Interference with Legal Rights
Oklahoma courts have also recognized liability for wrongful interference
with legal rights. In Bliss v. Holmes, 9 P.2d 718, 156 Okla. 40, 1932 OK 114
(Okla. 1932), the court stated: "When a man does an act which in law and in
fact is wrongful and such an act is made as a natural consequence of it to

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
produce injury to another, and which, in this particular, produces injury, an
action for damages will lie." The court also noted that third parties who
interfere with contracts should be held accountable for resulting damages.
In the context of assisting someone with fraudulent divorce paperwork, this
principle could apply if the deceptive actions constituted wrongful
interference with the marital relationship or legal rights.
Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress as
an Alternative Theory
Depending on the severity of the deceptive conduct, a claim for intentional
infliction of emotional distress might also be viable.
Evolution and Recognition of the Tort
The Oklahoma Supreme Court has recognized intentional infliction of
emotional distress as a distinct tort. In Miller v. Miller, 956 P.2d 887, 1998
OK 24 (Okla. 1998), the court acknowledged: "The tort of intentional
infliction of emotional distress was not known to the common law and was
not readily embraced as a distinct grounds of recovery until well into this
century... An action for intentional infliction of emotional distress will lie
only where there is extreme and outrageous conduct coupled with severe
emotional distress..."
Standard for Liability
The court in Breeden v. League Services Corp., 575 P.2d 1374, 1978 OK 27
(Okla. 1978) adopted the Restatement (Second) of Torts standard: "One who
by extreme and outrageous conduct intentionally or recklessly causes severe
emotional distress to another is subject to liability for such emotional
distress, and if bodily harm to the other results from it, for such bodily
harm."
The court noted that this tort creates "a separate and distinct basis for tort
liability without the presence of elements necessary to other torts, such as
assault, false imprisonment, trespass to land or the like."
For this claim to succeed in the context of the scenario presented, the
plaintiff would need to demonstrate that deceiving someone about helping
them, while actually assisting their spouse with fraudulent divorce
paperwork, constitutes "extreme and outrageous" conduct that
"intentionally or recklessly causes severe emotional distress."
Analysis: Application to the Scenario
Viability of a Deceit Claim
Based on the statutory and case law above, a personal injury claim for deceit
would be proper under Oklahoma law for the scenario described. The

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
situation aligns with the statutory definition of deceit under Okla. Stat. tit.
76, § 3 (2025), particularly subsections 1, 2, or 4, depending on the specific
circumstances:
If the person suggested they wanted to help while knowing this was
untrue, this would fall under subsection 1.
If the person asserted they would help without reasonable grounds for
believing this was true, this would fall under subsection 2.
If the person promised to help without any intention of actually
providing help (but instead planning to assist with fraudulent divorce
paperwork), this would fall under subsection 4.
The key elements of actionable fraud outlined in Lenn v. Miller, 403 P.2d
458, 1965 OK 86 (Okla. 1965) appear to be satisfied in the scenario
described:
There was a material, false representation about wanting to help.
The representation was made with knowledge of its falsity.
It was made with the intention that you would act upon it (by trusting
the person).
You relied on the representation.
You suffered injury as a result (the harm from fraudulent divorce
paperwork).
Recovery for Emotional Distress
The precedent established in Worsham v. Nix, 2004 OK CIV APP 2, 83 P.3d
879 (Okla. Civ. App. 2003) supports the recovery of emotional distress
damages for deceit even without physical injury. The emotional distress
caused by discovering someone has deceived you and assisted with
fraudulent divorce paperwork would likely qualify as "the natural and
probable consequence of the tortious act" of deceit.
Categorization as "Personal Injury (Other)"
While deceit and fraud are often considered economic torts, Oklahoma
courts have recognized these claims under personal injury theories,
particularly when they result in emotional distress. As the court in Worsham
recognized, deceit can support a claim for emotional distress damages.
Furthermore, the statutory basis for deceit under Title 76 of the Oklahoma
Statutes is found in the chapter on "Torts," indicating that the legislature
intended deceit to be treated as a tort. Personal injury claims encompass
various torts beyond physical injuries, including those causing emotional or
psychological harm.
Potential for Constructive Fraud Claim
Even if actual fraudulent intent cannot be proven, a claim for constructive
fraud under Okla. Stat. tit. 15, § 59 (2025) might be viable if the person who
deceived you gained an advantage by misleading you. This could be
1.

3.

2. 
3. 
4. 
5. 

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
particularly relevant if there was a relationship of trust or confidence that
created a duty to disclose true intentions.
Viability of Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress
Claim
Whether a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress would
succeed depends on whether a court would find the conduct "extreme and
outrageous." As the court in Miller v. Miller, 956 P.2d 887, 1998 OK 24 (Okla.
1998) noted, liability does not extend "to mere insults, indignities, threats,
annoyances, petty oppressions, or other trivialities."
However, deliberately deceiving someone about offering help while actually
assisting their spouse with fraudulent divorce paperwork could potentially
rise to the level of "extreme and outrageous" conduct, particularly given the
intimate nature of marriage and the potential significant impact of divorce
proceedings based on fraudulent paperwork.
Potential Challenges and Defenses
Proving Knowledge and Intent
One of the key challenges in pursuing a deceit claim would be proving the
defendant's knowledge and intent. The plaintiff would need to demonstrate
that the defendant knowingly made false representations with the intention
of deceiving, rather than simply changing their mind or having conflicting
loyalties.
Establishing Causation and Damages
The plaintiff would need to establish a causal connection between the deceit
and the damages suffered. This would require showing that the damages
were the natural and probable consequence of the deceptive conduct.
Statute of Limitations
While not explicitly mentioned in the provided materials, it's important to
note that personal injury claims, including those for deceit, are subject to
statutes of limitations under Oklahoma law. The plaintiff would need to
ensure any claim is filed within the applicable limitations period.
Potential Immunity or Privilege
Depending on the defendant's role or relationship to the parties, there might
be potential defenses based on immunity or privilege. However, the provided
materials do not suggest any specific immunities that would apply to the
scenario described.

Conclusion
Based on the statutory provisions and case law of Oklahoma, it would be
proper to sue someone under personal injury (other) for deceit if they
deceived you by claiming they wanted to help you but instead invited your
wife to their house and assisted her in filing fraudulent divorce paperwork.
The primary statutory basis for such a claim would be Okla. Stat. tit. 76, § 2
(2025), which establishes liability for willful deception causing injury, and 
Okla. Stat. tit. 76, § 3 (2025), which defines various forms of deceit.
Oklahoma case law, particularly Lenn v. Miller, 403 P.2d 458, 1965 OK 86
(Okla. 1965), establishes the elements of actionable fraud that would need
to be proven.
The precedent in Worsham v. Nix, 2004 OK CIV APP 2, 83 P.3d 879 (Okla.
Civ. App. 2003) supports the recovery of emotional distress damages in
cases of deceit, even without physical injury, making a personal injury
classification appropriate for such a claim.
Depending on the severity of the conduct, additional or alternative theories
of liability might include constructive fraud under Okla. Stat. tit. 15, § 59
(2025) or intentional infliction of emotional distress as recognized in 
Breeden v. League Services Corp., 575 P.2d 1374, 1978 OK 27 (Okla. 1978).
While there may be challenges in proving the elements of deceit,
particularly knowledge and intent, Oklahoma law provides a clear
framework for pursuing such claims when someone has been harmed by
another's deliberate deception.
Legal Authorities

Oklahoma Supreme Court
Extract
Because of the fear of fictitious and or trivial claims and the difficulty of
setting up satisfactory boundaries to liability, the law has been slow to afford
independent protection to the interest of freedom from emotional distress
standing alone. It is only recently that the law has fully recognized extreme
or outrageous conduct, which intentionally or recklessly causes severe
emotional distress, as a separate and distinct basis for tort liability without
the presence of elements necessary to other torts, such as assault, false
imprisonment, trespass to land or the like. The general state of the law is
succinctly summarized at Section 46, Restatement of Torts (Second), 1965,
which provides in part: § 46. Outrageous Conduct Causing Emotional
Distress '(1) One who by extreme and outrageous conduct intentionally or
recklessly causes severe emotional distress to another is subject to liability
for such emotional distress, and if bodily harm to the other results from it,
for such bodily harm.'

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
Such conduct can be a separate basis for tort liability, even without the
presence of other tort elements like assault or trespass. This suggests that if
the conduct of deceiving someone and assisting in filing fraudulent divorce
paperwork is deemed extreme and outrageous, it could potentially form the
basis for a personal injury claim under this tort.
Bliss v. Holmes, 9 P.2d 718, 156 Okla. 40, 1932 OK 114 (Okla. 1932)
Oklahoma Supreme Court
Extract
The right to contract is a legal right guaranteed to every citizen of
Oklahoma. A contract made and entered into in good faith should not be
interfered with by third parties, and where third parties interfere with
contracts and damage results therefrom, they should be held to account to
the loser for said damages. When a man does an act which in law and in fact
is wrongful and such an act is made as a natural consequence of it to
produce injury to another, and which, in this particular, produces injury, an
action for damages will lie.
Summary
The passage from Bliss v. Holmes discusses the legal right to contract and
the consequences of third-party interference with contracts. It states that if
a third party wrongfully interferes with a contract and causes damage, they
can be held accountable for those damages. This principle can be extended
to situations where a third party's wrongful actions, such as deception, lead
to injury or damage, potentially allowing for a lawsuit for damages.

76 O.S.1971, § 2 provides that one who wilfully deceives another, with intent
to induce him to alter his position to his injury or risk, is liable for any
damage which he thereby suffers. Also, 76 O.S.1971, § 4, provides that one
who practices a deceit with intent to defraud the public, or a particular class
of persons, is deemed to have intended to defraud every individual in that
class, who is actually misled by the deceit.

=== PAGE 10 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
Oklahoma law recognizes deceit as a basis for liability if it causes someone
to alter their position to their injury or risk. The statutes cited (76 O.S.1971,
§§ 2 and 4) establish that intentional deceit with the intent to induce
someone to act to their detriment can result in liability for damages. This is
relevant to the question because it suggests that if someone was deceived
into altering their position (e.g., not contesting a divorce) due to fraudulent
actions, they may have grounds for a lawsuit under these statutes.
Nutt v. Carson, 340 P.2d 260 (Okla. 1959)
Oklahoma Supreme Court
Extract
Plaintiff's general allegations are that her injuries and disabilities are
directly and proximately caused by the deceitful and fraudulent acts of
defendant, and refers to Tile 76 O.S.1951 §§ 2 and 3, relating to damages for
deceit. Although our laws relating to damages for fraud and deceit may in
some respect enlarge the common-law right of action, the same still rests
upon fraud.
Summary
In Oklahoma, claims for damages due to deceitful and fraudulent acts are
grounded in fraud. The passage references Title 76 O.S.1951 §§ 2 and 3,
which relate to damages for deceit, indicating that Oklahoma law provides a
basis for legal action in cases of deceit. The passage suggests that while the
statutory provisions may expand the common-law right of action, the
foundation of such claims remains fraud. This implies that if the deceitful
actions in question can be framed as fraudulent, there may be a basis for a
lawsuit under these provisions.

Summary
Elements required to establish actionable fraud in Oklahoma. These
elements include making material, false representations with knowledge of
their falsity or recklessly without knowledge of their truth, intending for
them to be acted upon by another, and resulting in injury to the other party.
This is relevant to the question because if the person deceived you with false
representations about their intentions to help, knowing they were false or
recklessly disregarding their truth, and you relied on these representations
to your detriment, it could potentially constitute actionable fraud.
Cooper v. Parker-Hughey, 894 P.2d 1096, 1995 OK 35 (Okla. 1995)

Title 76 O.S.1981, § 2, permits one damaged by another's deceit to receive
damages. It provides: 'One who willfully deceives another, with intent to

Summary
The passage from the Oklahoma Supreme Court case provides a statutory
basis for seeking damages due to deceit. It indicates that if someone willfully
deceives another with the intent to induce them to alter their position to
their injury or risk, they can be held liable for any resulting damages. This is
relevant to the question as it suggests that if the deceitful actions of the
individual led to damages, a lawsuit could potentially be pursued under this
statute.

Summary
In Oklahoma, emotional distress damages can be recoverable in cases of
deceit or fraud, even in the absence of physical injury. The passage
specifically mentions that deceit and fraud can support claims for emotional
distress damages, which aligns with the scenario described in the question
where deceit was involved in assisting with fraudulent divorce paperwork.
Miller v. Miller, 956 P.2d 887, 1998 OK 24 (Okla. 1998)
Oklahoma Supreme Court
Extract
¶32 The tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress was not known to
the common law and was not readily embraced as a distinct grounds of

Summary
The passage from the Miller v. Miller case provides insight into the
requirements for a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress in
Oklahoma. It specifies that for such a claim to be valid, the conduct must be
extreme and outrageous, and it must result in severe emotional distress.
This is relevant to the question as it suggests that if the conduct of deceiving
someone and assisting in filing fraudulent divorce paperwork meets these
criteria, a claim might be possible under this tort.
Rogers v. Meiser, 2003 OK 6, 68 P.3d 967, 977 Okla 2003 (Okla. 2003)
Oklahoma Supreme Court
Extract
Under § 9.1 punitive damages are allowed (assuming the statutorily-
designated level of proof is shown) where a defendant has acted: 1) in
reckless disregard for the rights of others [§ 9.1(B)], 2) intentionally and
with malice toward others [§ 9.1(C)], or 3) intentionally and with malice,
while at the same time engaging in conduct life-threatening to humans [§
9.1(D)]. There is no doubt a common law claim for actual fraud is a type of
claim that holds the potential for properly falling under one or more of the
specified provisions of § 9.1. See Z.D. Howard Company v. Cartwright, 1975
OK 89, 537 P.2d 345 (recognizing punitive damages may be recovered where

=== PAGE 13 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
a defendant has engaged in wanton, malicious and intentional fraudulent
acts).
Summary
In Oklahoma, a common law claim for fraud can potentially lead to punitive
damages if the defendant's actions were wanton, malicious, and intentional.
This suggests that if the actions described in the question (deception and
assistance in filing fraudulent paperwork) meet these criteria, a lawsuit
could be pursued under a fraud claim, which may fall under personal injury
(other) if it involves harm to the plaintiff's rights or interests.
Okla. Stat. tit. 15, § 59 Okla. Stat. tit. 15, § 59 Constructive Fraud Defined
Extract
Constructive fraud consists: 1. In any breach of duty which, without an
actually fraudulent intent, gains an advantage to the person in fault, or any
one claiming under him, by misleading another to his prejudice, or to the
prejudice of any one claiming under him; or, 2. In any such act or omission
as the law specially declares to be fraudulent, without respect to actual
fraud.
Summary
Constructive fraud in Oklahoma involves a breach of duty that misleads
another to their prejudice, even without an actual fraudulent intent. This
could potentially apply to a situation where someone deceives another by
claiming to help but instead acts to their detriment, such as assisting in
filing fraudulent divorce paperwork. The statute provides a basis for
claiming constructive fraud, which could be relevant in a personal injury
(other) lawsuit if the deception led to harm or prejudice.

Summary
The passage from the Oklahoma Deceptive Trade Practices Act allows
individuals who have been damaged or are likely to be damaged by a
deceptive trade practice to maintain an action in court. This includes the
ability to seek injunctive relief and recover actual damages without the need
to prove monetary loss or intent. The scope of this statute is broad and
applies to deceptive trade practices, which could potentially encompass the
scenario described in the question if the actions of the individual fall under
deceptive trade practices as defined by the Act.

Summary
Oklahoma law provides for liability in cases where one party willfully
deceives another with the intent to cause them to alter their position to their
injury or risk. This statute is applicable to cases of deceit, which could
include the scenario described in the question where someone deceives

Okla. Stat. tit. 76, § 4 Okla. Stat. tit. 76, § 4 Deceit Upon the Public Deemed
Deceit of Any Individual Misled
Extract
One who practices a deceit with intent to defraud the public, or a particular
class of persons, is deemed to have intended to defraud every individual in
that class, who is actually misled by the deceit.
Summary
The statute addresses deceit with the intent to defraud either the public or a
specific class of persons. If an individual is misled by such deceit, the
deceiver is deemed to have intended to defraud that individual. This could
potentially apply to the situation described in the question if the deceit was
intended to defraud a particular class of persons, such as individuals
seeking assistance with personal matters.

Okla. Stat. tit. 76, § 3 Okla. Stat. tit. 76, § 3 Deceits Defined and Classed
Extract
A deceit, within the meaning of the last section is either: 1. The suggestion,
as a fact, of that which is not true by one who does not believe it to be true.
2. The assertion, as a fact, of that which is not true, by one who has no
reasonable ground for believing it to be true. 3. The suppression of a fact by
one who is bound to disclose it, or who gives information of other facts
which are likely to mislead for want of communication of that fact; or, 4. A
promise, made without any intention of performing.
Summary
Oklahoma law defines deceit in several ways, including making false
suggestions or assertions, suppressing facts, or making promises without
intent to perform. These definitions could potentially apply to a situation
where someone deceives another by claiming to help but instead acts
against their interests, such as assisting in filing fraudulent divorce
paperwork.
