Question
The wife did not plead the alleged misconduct (drug use, nudity, etc.) and
failed to disclose her intended testimony during discovery. Texas Rules of
Civil Procedure require parties to plead material facts and disclose evidence
and witnesses in discovery (see Tex. R. Civ. P. 47, 192.3, 193.6). Because the
wife failed to plead these facts and did not disclose her testimony, the court
may exclude her evidence and testimony on these issues, weakening her
case.
Answer (Texas)
Short response
If the wife failed to plead the alleged misconduct and did not disclose her
intended testimony or evidence during discovery, Texas law generally
requires exclusion of such evidence or testimony at trial unless she can
show good cause or lack of unfair surprise or prejudice. This failure to
comply with pleading and discovery obligations can significantly weaken her
case.
Summary
Texas Rules of Civil Procedure mandate that parties must both plead
material facts with sufficient detail to provide fair notice and timely disclose
evidence and witnesses during discovery. If a party, such as the wife in this
scenario, fails to plead specific allegations (like drug use or nudity) and does
not disclose related evidence or intended testimony, the court is typically
required to exclude that evidence or testimony at trial unless the party can
demonstrate good cause for the failure or show that the opposing party is
not unfairly surprised or prejudiced.
The exclusion of such evidence is not discretionary but mandatory under
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 193.6, unless an exception applies. The burden
is on the party seeking to introduce the undisclosed evidence to prove an
exception, and courts have consistently enforced these rules to ensure
fairness and prevent trial by ambush. As a result, the wife’s failure to
comply with these procedural requirements would likely result in the
exclusion of her evidence and testimony on the alleged misconduct, thereby
undermining her position in the litigation.
Background and Relevant Law
Pleading Requirements
Under Texas law, pleadings must provide fair notice of the claims and
material facts at issue. Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 47 requires that a
pleading contain a short statement of the cause of action sufficient to give

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
fair notice of the claim involved. The "fair notice" standard is designed to
ensure that the opposing party is not taken by surprise and has an adequate
opportunity to prepare a defense. If a party fails to plead specific facts or
allegations, such as misconduct involving drug use or nudity, those issues
may not be properly before the court, and evidence related to them may be
subject to exclusion, as the opposing party would not have been put on
notice to address or rebut those claims (Marin v. Iesi TX Corp., 317 S.W.3d
314 (Tex. App. 2010)).
Discovery Obligations
Texas Rules of Civil Procedure 192.3 and 193.6 govern the scope of
discovery and the consequences of failing to comply with discovery
obligations. Rule 192.3 outlines the general scope of discovery, including the
requirement to disclose the identity of witnesses and the existence of
documents or other evidence that a party intends to use at trial. Rule 193.6
provides that if a party fails to make, amend, or supplement a discovery
response in a timely manner, that party may not introduce the undisclosed
material or information into evidence, nor offer the testimony of a witness
who was not timely identified, unless the court finds good cause for the
failure or determines that the opposing party will not be unfairly surprised
or prejudiced by the late disclosure (Civil Litigation (2022-05-05); Good v.
Baker, 339 S.W.3d 260 (Tex.App., 2011)).
The exclusion of evidence under Rule 193.6 is mandatory unless one of the
exceptions applies. The burden is on the party seeking to introduce the
evidence to establish either good cause for the failure to disclose or that the
opposing party will not be unfairly surprised or prejudiced (Good v. Baker,
339 S.W.3d 260 (Tex.App., 2011)).
Case Law Interpreting the Rules
Texas courts have consistently enforced these procedural requirements. In 
Marin v. Iesi TX Corp., 317 S.W.3d 314 (Tex. App. 2010), the court explained
that Rule 193.6(a) prohibits a party from introducing evidence or testimony
that was not timely disclosed in discovery, unless the party can show good
cause or lack of unfair surprise or prejudice. The court also reiterated the
fair notice pleading standard under Rule 47. However, it is important to note
that Marin was later abrogated by Clay v. AIG Aerospace Ins. Servs., Inc.,
488 S.W.3d 402 (Tex. App. 2016) on unrelated grounds, but the core
principles regarding exclusion for nondisclosure and the fair notice standard
remain consistent with other authorities.
In Schindler Elevator Corp. v. Ceasar (2021-11-30), the court reinforced the
importance of timely disclosure and the court’s authority to sanction parties
for discovery violations, including exclusion of evidence and monetary
sanctions. The court emphasized that parties must either produce or at least
disclose the existence of responsive materials, and failure to do so
constitutes a material violation of the discovery rules.

Secondary materials further confirm that the penalty for failing to respond
to a discovery request is the mandatory exclusion of the unidentified witness
or evidence, unless an exception applies (Civil Litigation (2022-05-05)).
Analysis
Application to the Wife’s Failure to Plead and Disclose
In the scenario presented, the wife did not plead the alleged misconduct
(such as drug use or nudity) and failed to disclose her intended testimony or
evidence during discovery. Under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 47, her
pleadings would likely be deemed insufficient to provide fair notice to the
opposing party regarding these specific allegations. This lack of notice could
itself be grounds for excluding related evidence, as the opposing party
would not have had an opportunity to prepare a defense to these claims
(Marin v. Iesi TX Corp., 317 S.W.3d 314 (Tex. App. 2010)).
More critically, under Rule 193.6, the wife’s failure to disclose her intended
testimony or evidence during discovery triggers the mandatory exclusion
rule. Unless she can demonstrate good cause for her failure to disclose or
show that the opposing party will not be unfairly surprised or prejudiced,
the court must exclude the undisclosed evidence and testimony (Civil
Litigation (2022-05-05); Good v. Baker, 339 S.W.3d 260 (Tex.App., 2011)).
The burden is on the wife to establish one of these exceptions, and the
court’s findings must be supported by the record.
Texas courts have repeatedly held that the exclusion of evidence for
discovery violations is not discretionary but mandatory, absent a showing of
good cause or lack of unfair surprise or prejudice. In Good v. Baker, 339 S.W.
3d 260 (Tex.App., 2011), the court stated that the rule requiring witness
disclosure is mandatory, and the penalty for nondisclosure is automatic
exclusion unless an exception is proven. This approach is designed to
prevent trial by ambush and to ensure that all parties have a fair opportunity
to prepare their cases.
The same principles apply to both documentary evidence and witness
testimony. In Schindler Elevator Corp. v. Ceasar (2021-11-30), the court
sanctioned a party for failing to produce or disclose documents that were
responsive to discovery requests, emphasizing that such failures are
material violations of the discovery rules and warrant exclusion and
sanctions.
Impact on the Wife’s Case
Because the wife failed to plead the alleged misconduct and did not disclose
her intended testimony or evidence during discovery, she is likely precluded
from introducing that evidence or testimony at trial. This exclusion can
significantly weaken her case, particularly if the alleged misconduct is
central to her claims or defenses. The court’s enforcement of the exclusion
rule is intended to protect the integrity of the discovery process and to
ensure that all parties are treated fairly.

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
If the wife attempts to introduce the undisclosed evidence or testimony at
trial, the opposing party can object on the grounds of nondisclosure, and the
court is required to exclude the evidence unless the wife can meet her
burden of proving good cause or lack of unfair surprise or prejudice. If she
cannot do so, the evidence will not be admitted, and her case will be
weakened as a result.
Exceptions and Caveats
There are two primary exceptions to the mandatory exclusion rule under
Rule 193.6: (1) if the party can show good cause for the failure to disclose,
or (2) if the court finds that the opposing party will not be unfairly surprised
or prejudiced by the late disclosure. The burden of proof is on the party
seeking to introduce the evidence, and the court’s findings must be
supported by the record (Good v. Baker, 339 S.W.3d 260 (Tex.App., 2011)).
Good cause may exist if the failure to disclose was due to circumstances
beyond the party’s control or if the information was not reasonably available
during the discovery period. Lack of unfair surprise or prejudice may be
found if the opposing party was otherwise aware of the evidence or had an
opportunity to address it before trial. However, courts are generally
reluctant to find these exceptions unless the facts clearly support them, as
the purpose of the rules is to prevent surprise and ensure fairness.
It is also important to note that Marin v. Iesi TX Corp., 317 S.W.3d 314 (Tex.
App. 2010) was abrogated by Clay v. AIG Aerospace Ins. Servs., Inc., 488
S.W.3d 402 (Tex. App. 2016) on unrelated grounds. While this limits the
precedential value of Marin on issues not directly related to the abrogation,
the principles regarding exclusion for nondisclosure and the fair notice
pleading standard remain consistent with other authorities and are still
widely applied.
Additionally, courts have discretion to reopen discovery or allow late
disclosures in the interest of justice, as noted in Schindler Elevator Corp. v.
Ceasar (2021-11-30). However, such relief is not automatic and typically
requires a showing of good cause.
Conclusion
Texas law strictly enforces the requirements for pleading material facts and
disclosing evidence and witnesses during discovery. If a party fails to plead
specific allegations or to disclose intended evidence or testimony, the court
is generally required to exclude that evidence or testimony at trial unless
the party can demonstrate good cause or lack of unfair surprise or
prejudice. The burden is on the party seeking to introduce the evidence, and
courts have consistently applied these rules to prevent unfairness and trial
by ambush. In this scenario, the wife’s failure to comply with these
procedural requirements would likely result in the exclusion of her evidence
and testimony on the alleged misconduct, thereby weakening her case.

Marin v. Iesi TX Corp., 317 S.W.3d 314 (Tex. App. 2010)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 193.6(a) provides that a party who fails to
make, amend, or supplement a discovery response in a timely manner may
not introduce in evidence the material or information that was not timely
disclosed, unless the court finds that there was good cause for the failure to
make, amend, or supplement the discovery response timely, or that the other
parties will not be unfairly surprised or prejudiced by the failure to make,
amend or supplement. Tex.R. Civ. P. 193.6(a). The party seeking to introduce
the evidence carries the burden of establishing good cause, lack of unfair
surprise, or lack of unfair prejudice. Tex.R. Civ. P. 193.6(b). A finding of good
cause, lack of unfair surprise, or lack of unfair prejudice must be supported
by the record." ... "Texas follows a 'fair notice' standard for pleading... Rule
47 of the Texas Rule of Civil Procedure provides a pleading 'shall contain ...
a short statement of the cause of action sufficient to give fair notice of the
claim involved....' Tex.R. Civ. P. 47.
Summary
The case articulates the mandatory exclusion rule in TRCP 193.6 for
evidence not timely disclosed in discovery, absent good cause or lack of
unfair surprise/prejudice, placing the burden on the proponent. It also
reiterates Rule 47’s fair-notice pleading standard. These principles support
excluding a party’s undisclosed testimony/evidence and requiring sufficient
pleadings of material facts.
Schindler Elevator Corp. v. Ceasar
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The trial court told the parties it could reopen discovery at any time, which
is consistent with Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 190.5, which permits a court
to modify a discovery control plan 'at any time' when justice requires. See
Tex.R.Civ.P. 190.5. ... [T]he order to produce documents during trial related
to documents were timely requested, that existed, and that Schindler failed
to produce during the discovery period, and the order was 'an opportunity to
remedy that discovery violation[.]' ... [T]he Court finds that the Schindler
policy manual and the work orders for the 12 month period preceding the
accident were responsive to the original discovery request and should have
either been produced, or at a minimum, disclosed the existence of the
materials subject to an applicable objection. ... The Court finds that these
failures by Schindler were a material violation of Tex.R.Civ.P. 193.1, and
therefore a monetary sanction of $25,000.00 is warranted.

Summary
The passages reinforce Texas courts’ strict enforcement of discovery
obligations and willingness to sanction parties who fail to disclose
responsive information, identifying nondisclosure as a material violation of
Rule 193.1 and characterizing mid-trial orders as remedies for discovery
violations. While the case addresses documents rather than testimony, the
same discovery framework (Rules 192–193) governs disclosure of evidence
and witnesses, and Rule 193.6 authorizes exclusion for nondisclosure. This
supports arguing that a party’s failure to plead and disclose intended
evidence/testimony permits exclusion and sanctions, weakening the
noncompliant party’s case.

Good v. Baker, 339 S.W.3d 260 (Tex.App., 2011). A trial court’s decision to
admit or exclude evidence is reviewed for abuse of discretion. The rule
requiring that witnesses be disclosed in response to a discovery request is
mandatory, and the penalty, exclusion of evidence, is automatic, absent a
showing of: (1) good cause; (2) lack of unfair surprise; or (3) unfair
prejudice. The burden of establishing good cause or lack of unfair surprise
for failure to disclose a witness is on the party seeking to introduce the
witness’s testimony.
Summary
The passage states Texas law that witness disclosure is mandatory and
nondisclosed witness testimony is automatically excluded unless the
proponent shows good cause or lack of surprise/prejudice. This aligns with
Tex. R. Civ. P. 193.6 and supports excluding the wife’s undisclosed testimony
about alleged misconduct, thereby weakening her case.

Summary
The quoted material states that under TRCP 193.6, the consequence for
failing to timely disclose information or identify witnesses is exclusion of the
evidence or testimony, unless an exception applies. This directly supports
excluding undisclosed misconduct evidence and testimony. While the
passage does not discuss Rule 47 pleading requirements, it provides the key
discovery-based exclusion authority that aligns with the proposition’s
argument that nondisclosure permits exclusion and weakens the wife’s case.
