Question
Plaintiff alleged that after the initial acts in December 2023 and January
2024, Defendants continued to communicate, threaten, and interfere with
Plaintiff’s business and legal rights through at least May 2025. Open-ended
continuity exists where the predicate acts “by their nature project into the
future with a threat of repetition.” See *Bixler v. Foster*, 596 F.3d 751, 761
(10th Cir. 2010); *H.J. Inc.*, 492 U.S. at 242. The District Court improperly
discounted the ongoing threats and communications as “taunting” or
unrelated. The 10th Circuit has held that the threat of continued criminal
activity, even if the initial scheme’s “primary objective” is achieved, can
satisfy the continuity requirement if the complaint plausibly alleges ongoing
conduct or threats. See *George v. Urban Settlement Servs.*, 833 F.3d 1242,
1257 (10th Cir. 2016) (continuity may be shown by “threats of repetition” or
ongoing conduct). Plaintiff’s allegations of continued threats, interference,
and monitoring of legal proceedings plausibly allege open-ended continuity. 
Answer (Oklahoma)
Short response
Plaintiff’s allegations of ongoing threats, interference, and monitoring by
Defendants after the initial predicate acts plausibly establish open-ended
continuity under RICO, as such conduct projects into the future with a threat
of repetition. The District Court erred in discounting these ongoing acts, as
both Supreme Court and Tenth Circuit precedent recognize that a threat of
continued racketeering activity—even after the primary objective is
achieved—can satisfy the continuity requirement.
Summary
The legal standard for RICO’s continuity requirement, as articulated by the
Supreme Court and consistently applied by lower courts, allows for a finding
of open-ended continuity where the alleged predicate acts, by their nature,
pose a threat of ongoing or future repetition. In this case, Plaintiff’s claims
that Defendants continued to threaten, interfere, and monitor legal
proceedings well beyond the initial acts are sufficient, at the pleading stage,
to plausibly allege open-ended continuity, especially where the conduct
suggests a risk of continued racketeering activity.
The District Court’s dismissal of these ongoing acts as mere “taunting” or
unrelated is inconsistent with the governing legal framework, which
requires a fact-specific, case-by-case analysis of whether the alleged conduct
projects into the future with a threat of repetition. The authorities provided,
including Supreme Court and Tenth Circuit guidance, support the conclusion
that Plaintiff’s allegations, if taken as true, meet the threshold for open-
ended continuity and thus satisfy this element of a RICO claim.

Background and Relevant Law
The RICO Continuity Requirement
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) requires a
plaintiff to establish a “pattern of racketeering activity,” which, as clarified
by the Supreme Court, consists of two distinct elements: relationship and
continuity. The continuity prong is central to this analysis and can be
satisfied in two ways: closed-ended continuity (a series of related predicate
acts over a substantial period) or open-ended continuity (conduct that, by its
nature, projects into the future with a threat of repetition), as established in 
H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co., 492 U.S. 229 (1989).
Open-ended continuity does not require a long duration of past conduct;
rather, it is present where the predicate acts themselves pose a specific
threat of repetition extending indefinitely into the future, or where the
conduct is part of the regular way the defendant conducts its business or
participates in an ongoing enterprise, as summarized in Chapter 4. Elements
of Cause of Action and RICO: A Primer.
Case Law Interpreting Open-Ended Continuity
The Supreme Court in H.J. Inc. emphasized that continuity is a flexible
concept, to be assessed on a case-by-case basis, and that open-ended
continuity may be established by showing that the racketeering acts include
a specific threat of repetition or are part of the defendant’s regular way of
conducting business. The Court declined to set rigid rules, instead requiring
courts to examine the particular facts of each case (H.J. Inc.; Chapter 4.
Elements of Cause of Action).
Subsequent authorities have consistently applied this standard. For
example, the Tenth Circuit has recognized that the threat of continued
criminal activity—even after the initial scheme’s primary objective is
achieved—can satisfy the continuity requirement if the complaint plausibly
alleges ongoing conduct or threats (George v. Urban Settlement Servs., 833
F.3d 1242, 1257 (10th Cir. 2016)). Similarly, Bixler v. Foster, 596 F.3d 751,
761 (10th Cir. 2010) (as referenced in the prompt) and other authorities
confirm that open-ended continuity exists where the predicate acts project
into the future with a threat of repetition.
The essential case law materials provided reinforce these principles,
repeatedly stating that open-ended continuity is present where conduct,
even if short-lived, poses a threat of future repetition, and that the existence
of such a threat is a function of the particular facts of the case (Racketeer
influenced and corrupt organizations (2000–2011); Chapter 4. Elements of
Cause of Action).

Analysis
Application of the Law to Plaintiff’s Allegations
Plaintiff alleges that, following initial predicate acts in December 2023 and
January 2024, Defendants continued to communicate, threaten, and
interfere with Plaintiff’s business and legal rights through at least May
2025. These allegations include not only the original acts but also a pattern
of ongoing conduct—threats, interference, and monitoring of legal
proceedings—extending well beyond the initial period.
Under the legal framework established by H.J. Inc. and its progeny, the key
inquiry is whether these ongoing acts, if true, pose a threat of continued
racketeering activity into the future. The authorities make clear that open-
ended continuity is satisfied where the nature of the acts suggests a risk of
repetition or ongoing harm, regardless of whether the initial scheme’s main
objective has been achieved (George v. Urban Settlement Servs.; Racketeer
influenced and corrupt organizations (2000–2011)).
The Tenth Circuit’s approach, as reflected in George v. Urban Settlement
Servs., is particularly instructive. There, the court held that continuity may
be shown by threats of repetition or ongoing conduct, and that the threat of
continued criminal activity is sufficient to meet the continuity requirement.
The court also recognized that the existence of a threat of continued
racketeering activity is a factual determination, to be assessed in light of the
specific allegations in the complaint.
Here, Plaintiff’s allegations of continued threats, interference, and
monitoring of legal proceedings are precisely the type of ongoing conduct
that courts have found sufficient to establish open-ended continuity. The
conduct is not limited to a closed period but instead projects into the future,
suggesting a risk of further harm or repetition. This aligns with the Supreme
Court’s guidance that open-ended continuity may be established where the
racketeering acts themselves include a specific threat of repetition
extending indefinitely into the future (Chapter 4. Elements of Cause of
Action).
The District Court’s Error
The District Court’s decision to discount the ongoing threats and
communications as mere “taunting” or unrelated is inconsistent with the
governing legal standards. The Supreme Court and Tenth Circuit have both
emphasized that the continuity requirement is a flexible, fact-specific
inquiry, and that ongoing threats or interference can be sufficient to
establish open-ended continuity (H.J. Inc.; George v. Urban Settlement
Servs.). The District Court’s approach appears to have improperly
disregarded the factual allegations of ongoing conduct, rather than
assessing whether those allegations, if true, would pose a threat of
continued racketeering activity.

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
The essential case law materials provided reinforce that the existence of a
threat of continued racketeering activity is a function of the particular facts
of each case, and that courts should avoid rigid or formulaic approaches
(Racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations (2000–2011)). By
dismissing the ongoing conduct as unrelated or insignificant, the District
Court failed to conduct the required case-by-case analysis and instead
applied an unduly restrictive interpretation of the continuity requirement.
Supporting and Supplementary Authorities
The supplementary materials, including Miskovsky v. State, 2001 OK CR 26,
31 P.3d 1054 (Okla. Crim. App. 2001), further support this analysis. That
case reiterates that continuity can be shown through either a closed period
of repeated conduct or past conduct that projects into the future with a
threat of repetition, and that it is insufficient to show only predicate acts
over a short period with no threat of future conduct. This supports the
proposition that ongoing threats and interference, as alleged by Plaintiff, are
sufficient to establish open-ended continuity.
Secondary materials such as RICO: A Primer also confirm that the continuity
requirement is satisfied where the predicate acts pose a threat of continued
criminal activity, either through a series of related acts over time (closed-
ended) or a threat of continuing activity into the future (open-ended). These
materials reinforce the conclusion that Plaintiff’s allegations, if true, meet
the standard for open-ended continuity.
Exceptions and Caveats
While the authorities are clear that open-ended continuity may be
established by a threat of continued racketeering activity, courts have also
emphasized that the existence of such a threat is a factual determination, to
be made on a case-by-case basis. Not every allegation of ongoing conduct
will necessarily suffice; the conduct must plausibly suggest a risk of future
repetition or ongoing harm (H.J. Inc.; Racketeer influenced and corrupt
organizations (2000–2011)).
Additionally, courts may scrutinize whether the ongoing acts are sufficiently
related to the original predicate acts and whether they form part of a
pattern of racketeering activity, rather than isolated or unrelated incidents.
However, in this case, Plaintiff’s allegations of continued threats,
interference, and monitoring of legal proceedings appear to be closely
related to the original scheme and thus are likely to be viewed as part of a
continuing pattern.
No negative or subsequent treatment of the key authorities has been
identified in the provided materials. The Supreme Court’s decision in H.J.
Inc. remains the controlling authority on the continuity requirement, and the
Tenth Circuit’s approach is consistent with that precedent.

Conclusion
In summary, Plaintiff’s allegations of ongoing threats, interference, and
monitoring of legal proceedings after the initial predicate acts are sufficient,
at the pleading stage, to plausibly allege open-ended continuity under RICO.
The Supreme Court and Tenth Circuit have both recognized that a threat of
continued racketeering activity—whether or not the initial scheme’s primary
objective has been achieved—can satisfy the continuity requirement, and
that the existence of such a threat is a factual determination to be made in
light of the specific allegations. The District Court’s dismissal of the ongoing
conduct as mere “taunting” or unrelated was inconsistent with this legal
framework. Accordingly, Plaintiff’s complaint should be deemed to have
adequately alleged open-ended continuity, and the case should proceed to
further factual development.

Miskovsky v. State, 2001 OK CR 26, 31 P.3d 1054 (Okla. Crim. App. 2001)
United States State Court of Appeals of Oklahoma. Court of Criminal
Appeals of Oklahoma
Extract
The continuity requirement is slightly more demanding. A prosecutor must
either show a 'closed period of repeated conduct' or 'past conduct that by its
nature projects into the future with a threat of repetition.' H.J. Inc. notes
that, since Congress was concerned with long-term criminal conduct, it is
insufficient to show predicate acts which extend merely over weeks or
months with no threat of future conduct.
Summary
The passage from "Miskovsky v. State" discusses the continuity requirement
under RICO, emphasizing that continuity can be shown through either a
closed period of repeated conduct or conduct that projects into the future
with a threat of repetition. This aligns with the proposition that ongoing
threats and interference can demonstrate open-ended continuity, as the
conduct projects into the future with a threat of repetition.

Extract
The 'continuity' component is met by either closed-ended continuity, defined
as 'a series of related predicates extending over a substantial period of
time,' or open-ended continuity, defined as conduct that poses a threat of
extending into the future. (55) The Court suggested a case-by-case
examination of this issue, noting that the existence of a 'threat of continued
racketeering activity' is a function of particular facts. (56)
Summary
Concept of "continuity" in the context of RICO, specifically mentioning open-
ended continuity as conduct that poses a threat of extending into the future.
This directly supports the proposition that ongoing threats and interference
can establish open-ended continuity. The passage also emphasizes a case-by-
case examination, which aligns with the proposition's argument that the
District Court improperly discounted the ongoing threats.

Extract
The 'continuity' prong is satisfied by proof of either closed-ended continuity
or open-ended continuity. Closed-ended continuity in the RICO context may
be demonstrated 'by proving a series of related predicates extending over a
substantial period of time.' Open-ended continuity in the RICO context is
conduct that may last only a short period of time but nonetheless poses a
threat of extending into the future. The Court suggested a case-by-case
examination of this issue, noting that the existence of a 'threat of continued
racketeering activity' is a function of particular facts.
Summary
The passage explains the concept of continuity in the RICO context,
distinguishing between closed-ended and open-ended continuity. It
highlights that open-ended continuity involves conduct that, even if short-
lived, poses a threat of future extension. This aligns with the proposition
that ongoing threats and interference can establish open-ended continuity,
as the conduct projects into the future with a threat of repetition.

Extract
Under the “less inflexible approach” adopted in H.J. Inc., con- tinuity is
“both a closed- and open-ended concept.” Id. at 241. Closed-ended
continuity refers “to a closed period of repeated conduct,” while open-ended
continuity denotes “past conduct that by its nature projects into the future
with a threat of repetition.” ... Open-ended continuity, in contrast, requires
proof of “a threat of continued racketeering activity.” Id. at 242. Under H.J.
Inc., open- ended continuity may be established in various ways. The Court
furnished some examples. First, a small number of related predi- cates
occurring close together in time will establish open-ended continuity if “the
racketeering acts themselves include a specific threat of repetition
extending indefinitely into the future, and thus supply the requisite threat of
continuity.”
Summary
The concept of open-ended continuity in RICO cases involves past conduct
that projects into the future with a threat of repetition. The passage
provides examples of how open-ended continuity can be established, such as
when the racketeering acts themselves include a specific threat of repetition
extending indefinitely into the future. This directly supports the proposition
that ongoing threats and interference by the Defendants can establish open-
ended continuity.

Extract
The Supreme Court made a second attempt to clarify the 'pattern' concept in
H.J., Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co. In that case, the Court held
that when proving a 'pattern of racketeering activity,' RICO requires both
relationship and continuity of predicate acts as separate elements. However,
the Court recognized that proof of these factors will often overlap. The
relationship prong is defined by the connection of the defendant's criminal
acts to one another: 'continuity' is successfully proved if a prosecutor can
show actual continuity during a past, closed period of repeated conduct or
an open-ended threat of continued racketeering activity in the future.

Summary
Concept of "continuity" in the context of racketeering, specifically
mentioning that continuity can be established through a series of related
predicates over time or an open-ended threat of continued activity. This
aligns with the proposition that ongoing threats and interference can
demonstrate open-ended continuity. The reference to the H.J., Inc. case
further supports the idea that continuity involves a threat of future activity,
which is relevant to the Plaintiff's allegations of ongoing conduct.
RICO: A Primer
Extract
The continuity requirement is likewise satisfied where the predicates are a
regular way of conducting the defendant's ongoing legitimate business (in
the sense that it is not a business that exists for criminal purposes), or of
conducting or participating in an ongoing and legitimate RICO 'enterprise.'
A plaintiff may demonstrate a pattern by establishment that the predicate
acts pose a threat of continued criminal activity, which is generally
demonstrated by showing either: * Closed-ended continuity. Proving 'a series
of related predicate acts extending over a substantial period of time.' *
Open-ended continuity. A threat of 'continuing criminal activity extending
indefinitely into the future,' in light of the nature of the enterprise and
predicate acts alleged.
Summary
The continuity requirement for RICO violations can be satisfied by
demonstrating a threat of continued criminal activity. This can be shown
through open-ended continuity, which involves a threat of continuing
criminal activity extending indefinitely into the future. This aligns with the
proposition that the plaintiff's allegations of continued threats and
interference support the existence of open-ended continuity.
