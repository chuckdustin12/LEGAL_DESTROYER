Question
The FAC alleges an ongoing enterprise, an unfulfilled objective, and a real
risk of further predicate acts, distinguishing this case from those where the
scheme is truly isolated and complete. The Tenth Circuit has recognized that
even a scheme targeting one victim can satisfy the continuity requirement if
it contemplates open-ended fraudulent activity and does not have a single
goal that, when achieved, will bring the activity to an end (Torwest DBC, Inc.
v. Dick, 810 F.2d 925, 928 (10th Cir. 1987); Edwards v. First Nat. Bank,
Bartlesville, Oklahoma, 872 F.2d 347, 351 (10th Cir. 1989)). Because the
FAC plausibly alleges an ongoing risk of racketeering activity, the case falls
within the exception recognized by the Tenth Circuit, and reconsideration
should be granted. 
Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
The Tenth Circuit recognizes that a RICO claim can satisfy the continuity
requirement—even when targeting a single victim—if the alleged scheme
contemplates open-ended fraudulent activity and lacks a single, terminating
objective. Because the FAC plausibly alleges an ongoing enterprise, an
unfulfilled objective, and a real risk of further predicate acts, it falls within
the exception recognized by the Tenth Circuit, supporting reconsideration.
Summary
The continuity requirement under RICO, as interpreted by the Tenth Circuit,
does not categorically exclude schemes targeting a single victim from
constituting a "pattern of racketeering activity." Instead, the key inquiry is
whether the alleged conduct presents a threat of ongoing criminal activity,
particularly where the scheme is open-ended and not limited to a single,
completed objective.
The authorities provided, including both Tenth Circuit precedent and district
court applications, consistently hold that open-ended continuity—
demonstrated by a plausible risk of future predicate acts or ongoing
fraudulent conduct—can satisfy the pattern requirement even in single-
victim cases. The FAC's allegations of an ongoing enterprise, unfulfilled
objectives, and a real risk of further predicate acts distinguish this case from
isolated, completed schemes and bring it squarely within the recognized
exception, warranting reconsideration.

Background and Relevant Law
Legislative and Regulatory Framework
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) requires a
plaintiff to establish a "pattern of racketeering activity," which, as
interpreted by the Supreme Court and lower courts, consists of two
elements: relationship and continuity. The continuity prong can be satisfied
by either closed-ended continuity (a series of related predicates over a
substantial period) or open-ended continuity (conduct that poses a threat of
continuing into the future). The Supreme Court in H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern
Bell Tel. Co. clarified that continuity is a flexible concept, to be assessed on a
case-by-case basis, and can be established by showing either actual
repeated conduct or a threat of future racketeering activity (Schrag v.
Dinges, 788 F.Supp. 1543, 1547 (D. Kan. 1992); Racketeer influenced and
corrupt organizations. (1997)).
Case Law
Tenth Circuit Precedent
The Tenth Circuit's leading case on the continuity requirement is Torwest
DBC, Inc. v. Dick, which held that a scheme with a single, discrete objective
—when completed—does not present a threat of ongoing activity and thus
fails the continuity requirement. However, the court expressly recognized
that a more difficult question arises when a scheme, even if targeting one
victim, contemplates open-ended fraudulent activity and lacks a single goal
that, when achieved, will end the activity. In such cases, the continuity
requirement may be satisfied (Torwest DBC, Inc. v. Dick, 810 F.2d 925,
928-29 (10th Cir. 1987); IN RE DOW CO. SARABOND PRODUCTS LIABILITY
LIT., 666 F.Supp. 1466, 1474 (D. Colo. 1987); O'CONNOR v. Midwest Pipe
Fabricators, Inc., 660 F. Supp. 696, 700 (D. Kan. 1987)).
Subsequent district court decisions within the Tenth Circuit have
consistently applied this principle, holding that a single scheme involving
one victim can meet the continuity requirement if it involves ongoing or
open-ended fraudulent activity (Bumgarner v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of
Kansas, 716 F. Supp. 493, 495 (D. Kan. 1988); Wichita Fed. Sav. & Loan v.
Landmark Group, Inc., 674 F. Supp. 321, 327 (D. Kan. 1987); Thompson v.
Wyoming Alaska, Inc., 652 F.Supp. 1222, 1225 (D. Utah 1987)).
The Tenth Circuit has also adopted a flexible, multi-factor approach to
continuity, considering the nature of the enterprise, the duration and
frequency of predicate acts, and whether the conduct poses a threat of
continued criminal activity (Racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations.
(2000); Resolution Trust Corp. v. Stone, 998 F.2d 1534, 1544 (10th Cir.
1993)).

District Court Applications
District courts in the Tenth Circuit have repeatedly emphasized that open-
ended continuity can be established by plausible allegations of a threat of
continuing criminal activity beyond the period of the predicate acts. Courts
are to consider the totality of the circumstances, including whether the
alleged conduct is part of the regular way of conducting the enterprise's
business or involves implicit or explicit threats of repetition (Fisher Sand &
Gravel Co. v. FNF Constr., Inc., No. 10-cv-0635 RB/SMV (D. N.M. Mar 27,
2013); Nation v. Shah, 4:19-cv-00588-JDR-JFJ (N.D. Okla. Oct 30, 2024)).
Courts have also rejected the argument that multiple schemes or multiple
victims are required to establish continuity, instead focusing on whether the
alleged conduct projects into the future with a threat of repetition
(Independent Drug Wholesalers Group, Inc. v. Denton, 833 F.Supp. 1507,
1511 (D. Kan. 1993); Purvis v. Hamwi, 828 F.Supp. 1479, 1485 (D. Colo.
1993)).
Secondary Materials
Secondary sources reinforce the judicial consensus that continuity can be
established by demonstrating a threat of continued criminal activity,
particularly through open-ended continuity. The Tenth Circuit's approach is
characterized as flexible and fact-specific, with courts examining whether
the alleged conduct is likely to continue into the future or is part of the
regular way of conducting business (RICO: A Primer (2022); Racketeer
influenced and corrupt organizations. (2011)).
Analysis
The Continuity Requirement and Open-Ended Schemes
The central issue is whether the FAC's allegations of an ongoing enterprise,
unfulfilled objectives, and a real risk of further predicate acts are sufficient
to satisfy the continuity requirement under RICO, as interpreted by the
Tenth Circuit.
The authorities make clear that continuity is not limited to schemes
involving multiple victims or multiple schemes. The Tenth Circuit, in Torwest
DBC, Inc. v. Dick, explicitly recognized that a scheme targeting a single
victim can satisfy the continuity requirement if it contemplates open-ended
fraudulent activity and does not have a single, terminating goal. The court
declined to adopt a bright-line rule, instead emphasizing the need for a fact-
specific inquiry into whether the alleged conduct presents a threat of
ongoing criminal activity (Torwest DBC, Inc. v. Dick, 810 F.2d 925, 928-29
(10th Cir. 1987); IN RE DOW CO. SARABOND PRODUCTS LIABILITY LIT.,
666 F.Supp. 1466, 1474 (D. Colo. 1987)).
District courts have consistently applied this principle, holding that open-
ended continuity can be established by plausible allegations of a threat of
continuing criminal activity, even where the scheme involves only one victim

(Fisher Sand & Gravel Co. v. FNF Constr., Inc., No. 10-cv-0635 RB/SMV (D.
N.M. Mar 27, 2013); Bumgarner v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Kansas, 716
F. Supp. 493, 495 (D. Kan. 1988); O'CONNOR v. Midwest Pipe Fabricators,
Inc., 660 F. Supp. 696, 700 (D. Kan. 1987)). The key inquiry is whether the
alleged conduct, by its nature, projects into the future with a threat of
repetition or is part of the regular way of conducting the enterprise's
business (Purvis v. Hamwi, 828 F.Supp. 1479, 1485 (D. Colo. 1993); Schrag
v. Dinges, 788 F.Supp. 1543, 1547 (D. Kan. 1992)).
Application to the FAC's Allegations
The FAC alleges an ongoing enterprise, an unfulfilled objective, and a real
risk of further predicate acts. These allegations, if plausible, distinguish the
case from those where the scheme is truly isolated and complete. The
authorities provided make clear that a scheme with an unfulfilled objective
and a risk of further predicate acts is not "closed-ended" or "isolated," but
rather presents the kind of open-ended continuity that satisfies the RICO
pattern requirement.
For example, in Nation v. Shah, the court explained that open-ended
continuity can be established by racketeering acts that involve threats of
repetition, form the operations of a criminal association, or are part of the
regular way of conducting a legitimate enterprise (Nation v. Shah, 4:19-
cv-00588-JDR-JFJ (N.D. Okla. Oct 30, 2024)). Similarly, in Fisher Sand &
Gravel Co. v. FNF Constr., Inc., the court held that open-ended continuity is
established if the plaintiff plausibly alleges a threat of continuing criminal
activity beyond the period of the predicate acts, considering the totality of
the circumstances (Fisher Sand & Gravel Co. v. FNF Constr., Inc., No. 10-
cv-0635 RB/SMV (D. N.M. Mar 27, 2013)).
The Supreme Court's guidance in H.J. Inc.—as adopted by the Tenth Circuit
—further supports this approach, emphasizing that continuity can be
established by showing either a closed period of repeated conduct or a
threat of future repetition, and that the existence of a threat of continued
racketeering activity is a function of the particular facts of each case
(Schrag v. Dinges, 788 F.Supp. 1543, 1547 (D. Kan. 1992); Racketeer
influenced and corrupt organizations. (2011)).
Single Victim and Single Scheme
The argument that a single scheme targeting one victim cannot satisfy the
continuity requirement has been repeatedly rejected by courts in the Tenth
Circuit. The key distinction is whether the scheme is open-ended and
presents a threat of ongoing activity, rather than being a closed, isolated
incident with a single, completed objective (Independent Drug Wholesalers
Group, Inc. v. Denton, 833 F.Supp. 1507, 1511 (D. Kan. 1993); Wichita Fed.
Sav. & Loan v. Landmark Group, Inc., 674 F. Supp. 321, 327 (D. Kan. 1987); 
Thompson v. Wyoming Alaska, Inc., 652 F.Supp. 1222, 1225 (D. Utah 1987)).
Secondary materials confirm that the Tenth Circuit's approach is consistent
with the broader federal consensus, which holds that a single scheme may
be sufficient to establish a pattern if there is a threat of continued activity

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
(Racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations. (1995); RICO: A Primer
(2022)).
Totality of the Circumstances and Case-by-Case Analysis
The authorities emphasize that the continuity requirement is inherently fact-
specific and must be assessed based on the totality of the circumstances.
Courts are to consider the nature of the enterprise, the duration and
frequency of the predicate acts, and whether the conduct is likely to
continue into the future (Fisher Sand & Gravel Co. v. FNF Constr., Inc., No.
10-cv-0635 RB/SMV (D. N.M. Mar 27, 2013); Racketeer influenced and
corrupt organizations. (2011); Racketeer influenced and corrupt
organizations. (2005)).
In this case, the FAC's allegations of an ongoing enterprise, unfulfilled
objectives, and a real risk of further predicate acts are precisely the kind of
facts that courts have found sufficient to establish open-ended continuity.
The absence of a single, terminating goal and the presence of a plausible
threat of future racketeering activity distinguish this case from those where
the scheme is isolated and complete.
Exceptions and Caveats
While the Tenth Circuit has recognized that a single scheme targeting one
victim can satisfy the continuity requirement if it contemplates open-ended
fraudulent activity, courts have also cautioned that not every scheme will
meet this standard. If the scheme is truly isolated, with a single, completed
objective and no plausible risk of future predicate acts, continuity will not be
found (Torwest DBC, Inc. v. Dick, 810 F.2d 925, 928-29 (10th Cir. 1987); 
Raymark Industries, Inc. v. Stemple, 714 F.Supp. 460, 468 (D. Kan. 1988)).
Additionally, courts have declined to adopt a bright-line rule and instead
require a fact-specific inquiry. The sufficiency of the FAC's allegations will
ultimately depend on whether the facts plausibly support a threat of ongoing
criminal activity, as opposed to a completed, isolated incident (Smith v. MCI
Telecommunications Corp., 678 F.Supp. 823, 827 (D. Kan. 1987)).
Conclusion
The Tenth Circuit's jurisprudence, as well as supporting district court
decisions and secondary materials, make clear that the continuity
requirement under RICO can be satisfied by a scheme targeting a single
victim if the scheme is open-ended and presents a real risk of ongoing
predicate acts. The FAC's allegations of an ongoing enterprise, unfulfilled
objectives, and a plausible threat of future racketeering activity bring this
case within the exception recognized by the Tenth Circuit. Accordingly, the
continuity requirement is met, and reconsideration should be granted. The
analysis must remain fact-specific, but the authorities provided strongly
support the proposition that the FAC's allegations are sufficient under Tenth
Circuit law.

O&#39;CONNOR v. Midwest Pipe Fabricators, Inc., 660 F. Supp. 696 (D.
Kan. 1987)
U.S. District Court — District of Kansas
Extract
The recent Tenth Circuit opinion in Torwest DBC v. Dick, 810 F.2d 925 (10th
Cir.1987) makes this point clear. The Torwest DBC court stated that to
establish a pattern there must be (1) a relationship among the alleged
wrongful acts (i.e., acts that are part of a common fraudulent scheme), and
(2) continuity of the acts (i.e., the threat of continuing activity). ... The court
also appeared to approve of those courts that allow a RICO claim to proceed
even though the claim is based on one scheme involving one victim, when
the plan contemplates open-ended fraudulent activity and does not have a
single goal that, when achieved, will bring the activity to an end. Id. at 929.
Summary
The passage from the "O'CONNOR v. Midwest Pipe Fabricators, Inc." case
discusses the Tenth Circuit's interpretation of the continuity requirement
under RICO, as established in Torwest DBC v. Dick. It emphasizes that a
pattern of racketeering activity can be established even in cases involving a
single scheme and a single victim if the scheme involves open-ended
fraudulent activity without a single goal that, when achieved, will end the
activity. This directly supports the proposition that the FAC alleges an
ongoing enterprise with an unfulfilled objective and a real risk of further
predicate acts, as it aligns with the Tenth Circuit's recognition of continuity
in such scenarios.
Thompson v. Wyoming Alaska, Inc., 652 F.Supp. 1222 (D. Utah 1987)
U.S. District Court — District of Utah
Extract
In Torwest DBC, Inc. v. Dick, 810 F.2d 925 (10th Cir.1986), the Tenth Circuit
stressed in a single scheme case that the 'continuity' requirement of pattern
requires demonstration of 'facts from which at least a threat of ongoing
illegal conduct may be inferred,' and that the single scheme would have to
involve 'continuous behavior.' ... It may be inferred from Torwest that 'a
scheme that contemplated open-ended fraudulent activity over a period of
time' would point to a different result than the scheme with which the court
was confronted in that case. Torwest involved 'numerous racketeering acts'
but only 'one victim,' 'one time,' and 'one discrete goal' thus constituting an
'isolated incident.' The court noted that 'a more difficult question is
presented when the RICO claim is based on one scheme involving one

victim, but the plan contemplates open-ended fraudulent activity and does
not have a single goal that, when achieved, will bring the activity to an end.'
Summary
The passage from "Thompson v. Wyoming Alaska, Inc." references the Tenth
Circuit's decision in Torwest DBC, Inc. v. Dick, which is directly relevant to
the proposition. It highlights the requirement for demonstrating continuity
in a RICO claim, emphasizing that a scheme targeting one victim can still
meet this requirement if it involves ongoing illegal conduct or open-ended
fraudulent activity. This aligns with the proposition that the FAC alleges an
ongoing enterprise with a risk of further predicate acts, distinguishing it
from isolated incidents.

U.S. District Court — District of Kansas
Extract
In Torwest DBC, Inc. v. Dick, the Tenth Circuit held that a pattern requires
continuous and related acts. Torwest, 810 F.2d 925, 928 (10th Cir.1987).
Acts which are part of a common fraudulent scheme are related. Id. Here,
the acts were related, as they were part of a common scheme to deprive
Smith of the commissions she earned. Continuity requires the threat of
ongoing activity. Id. 'A scheme to achieve a single discrete objective does not
in and of itself create a threat of ongoing activity, even when that goal is
pursued by multiple illegal acts, because the scheme ends when the purpose
is accomplished.' Id. at 929. The instant case involves a more difficult
question: whether a pattern is presented where a scheme has no single
objective and is directed toward one victim. Id. The Torwest court failed to
answer the question, stating that it declined to 'formulate a bright-line test'
for determining whether a pattern exists. Id.
Summary
Requirement of continuity in RICO cases, emphasizing that a pattern
requires continuous and related acts. It highlights that a scheme with a
single discrete objective does not inherently create a threat of ongoing
activity. However, it also notes the complexity of determining a pattern when
a scheme has no single objective and targets one victim, which aligns with
the proposition that even a scheme targeting one victim can satisfy the
continuity requirement if it contemplates open-ended fraudulent activity.

Extract
In Torwest, the Tenth Circuit characterized the continuity element as 'the
threat of continuing activity.' Id., 810 F.2d at 928, quoting Sedima's footnote
14. The court opined that 'a scheme to achieve a single discrete objective
does not in and of itself create a threat of ongoing activity, even when that
goal is pursued by multiple illegal acts, because the scheme ends when the
purpose is accomplished.' Id. at 928. The Torwest court also noted, however,
that 'a more difficult question is presented when the RICO claim is based on
one scheme involving one victim, but the plan contemplates open-ended
fraudulent activity and does not have a single goal that, when achieved, will
bring the activity to an end.' Id. at 929.
Summary
The passage from the document discusses the Tenth Circuit's interpretation
of the continuity element in RICO cases, specifically referencing the Torwest
case. It highlights that the Tenth Circuit recognizes the continuity
requirement as the "threat of continuing activity" and acknowledges that a
scheme involving one victim can satisfy this requirement if it involves open-
ended fraudulent activity without a single goal that concludes the activity.
This directly supports the proposition that the FAC alleges an ongoing
enterprise with an unfulfilled objective and a risk of further predicate acts,
aligning with the Tenth Circuit's recognition of such scenarios.

N.M. Mar 27, 2013)
U.S. District Court — District of New Mexico
Extract
Fisher relies on open-ended continuity to prove the 'pattern' element of its
RICO claim. (Doc. 105 at 18). Open-ended continuity depends heavily on the
facts of the case. Resolution Trust Corp., 998 F.2d at 1543. For 12(b)(6)
purposes, open-ended continuity is established if the plaintiff can plausibly
allege 'that there was a threat of continuing criminal activity beyond the
period during which the predicate acts were performed.' Heinrich, 668 F.3d
at 410. The threat of continuing racketeering activity need not be
established exclusively by the predicate acts, and the court should consider
the totality of the circumstances surrounding the commission of the acts. Id.
(citation omitted); see also Tal, 453 F.3d at 1268 (citation omitted).
Summary
Concept of open-ended continuity in the context of RICO claims, which is
directly relevant to the proposition. It explains that open-ended continuity
can be established if there is a plausible allegation of a threat of continuing
criminal activity beyond the period of the predicate acts. This aligns with the

=== PAGE 9 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
proposition's assertion that the FAC alleges an ongoing enterprise and a real
risk of further predicate acts, distinguishing it from isolated and complete
schemes. The passage also emphasizes considering the totality of
circumstances, which supports the idea of an ongoing risk of racketeering
activity.
Reeder v. Kermit Johnson, Alphagraphics, Inc., 723 F.Supp. 1428 (D. Utah
1989)
U.S. District Court — District of Utah
Extract
The Tenth Circuit, interpreting the continuity requirement articulated in
Sedima, noted that, to make an adequate showing of continuity, 'a plaintiff
must demonstrate some facts from which at least a threat of ongoing illegal
conduct may be inferred.' Torwest DBC, Inc. v. Dick, 810 F.2d 925, 928 (10th
Cir.1987). Going on, the court held that 'a scheme to achieve a single
discrete objective does not in and of itself create a threat of ongoing activity,
even when that goal is pursued by multiple illegal acts, because the scheme
ends when the purpose is accomplished.' Id. at 928-29. ... Plaintiffs have
alleged acts that demonstrate ongoing activity on the part of the defendants.
In addition to the multiple acts the plaintiffs allege were committed against
them over several years, the plaintiffs allege that the defendants' fraudulent
acts and nondisclosures continue as to other franchisees in Utah. This alone,
if proven true, would satisfy the continuity requirement.
Summary
Continuity requirement for a RICO claim, emphasizing that a threat of
ongoing illegal conduct can satisfy this requirement. It references the Tenth
Circuit's interpretation in Torwest DBC, Inc. v. Dick, which aligns with the
proposition that even a scheme targeting one victim can meet the continuity
requirement if it suggests ongoing fraudulent activity. The passage also
highlights that ongoing fraudulent acts against other parties can further
support the continuity requirement.

U.S. District Court — District of Kansas
Extract
The defendants argue that there can be no continuity because only a single
scheme, i.e. stealing overages, enacted against a single victim, i.e. IDWG, is
alleged. However, in setting the boundaries for 'continuity' in H.J., the Court
explicitly rejected the Eighth Circuit's requirement that a plaintiff had to

=== PAGE 10 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
prove that the defendants were involved in multiple schemes to prove a
RICO claim. Id. at 240, 109 S.Ct. at 2901... Defendant Mark Denton further
argues that the alleged racketeering activity involved only a single scheme
affecting one victim and that such a closed-ended scheme cannot constitute
a pattern. This argument lacks merit. For one, the Supreme Court rejected
the multiple scheme requirement in H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone
Co., 492 U.S. 229, 232, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 2897, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989).
Summary
Continuity requirement for RICO claims, emphasizing that a single scheme
targeting one victim can still satisfy the continuity requirement if it poses a
threat of continued criminal activity. The court rejected the notion that
multiple schemes are necessary, aligning with the Tenth Circuit's
recognition that open-ended fraudulent activity targeting a single victim can
meet the continuity requirement. This supports the proposition that the FAC
alleges an ongoing risk of racketeering activity, distinguishing it from
isolated and complete schemes.
Gotfredson v. Larsen Lp, 432 F.Supp.2d 1163 (D. Colo. 2006)
U.S. District Court — District of Colorado
Extract
Open-ended continuity 'may be established by showing that the predicates
themselves involve a distinct threat of long-term racketeering activity, either
implicit or explicit, or that the predicates are a regular way of conducting
the defendant's ongoing legitimate business or the RICO enterprise.'
Summary
The passage from "Gotfredson v. Larsen Lp" discusses the concept of open-
ended continuity in RICO cases, which is relevant to the proposition. It
explains that open-ended continuity can be established by demonstrating a
distinct threat of long-term racketeering activity or that the predicates are a
regular way of conducting business. This aligns with the proposition's
assertion that the FAC alleges an ongoing enterprise with a risk of further
predicate acts, fitting within the Tenth Circuit's recognition of continuity
even in schemes targeting a single victim.
Cook v. Zions First Nat. Bank, 645 F.Supp. 423 (D. Utah 1986)
U.S. District Court — District of Utah

=== PAGE 11 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
To form a 'pattern,' the commission of predicate acts or episodes of
criminality must be sufficiently continuous and interrelated. That is, a RICO
or RICE 'pattern' requires planned, ongoing, continuing crime and the threat
of continuing criminal conduct, as opposed to sporadic, isolated criminal
episodes or events.
Summary
The passage from "Cook v. Zions First Nat. Bank" emphasizes the necessity
of demonstrating a "pattern of racketeering activity" that is continuous and
interrelated, involving ongoing and planned criminal conduct. This aligns
with the proposition that the FAC alleges an ongoing enterprise with a risk
of further predicate acts, as it highlights the need for continuity and the
threat of ongoing criminal activity, rather than isolated incidents. The
passage supports the idea that a scheme can satisfy the continuity
requirement if it involves open-ended fraudulent activity, which is consistent
with the Tenth Circuit's recognition in cases like Torwest DBC, Inc. v. Dick
and Edwards v. First Nat. Bank.
Nation v. Shah, 4:19-cv-00588-JDR-JFJ (N.D. Okla. Oct 30, 2024)
U.S. District Court — Northern District of Oklahoma
Extract
More difficult to establish-and more problematic for Plaintiffs-is the
requirement that the predicate acts have sufficient “continuity” to constitute
a RICO “pattern.” ... Open-ended continuity can be established by
racketeering acts that “involved implicit or explicit threats of repetition,”
“formed the operations of an association that exists for criminal purposes,”
or were part of the defendants' “regular way of conducting a legitimate
enterprise.”
Summary
The court discusses the requirement of continuity in RICO claims,
specifically open-ended continuity. The passage explains that open-ended
continuity can be established if the racketeering acts involve threats of
repetition, are part of a criminal association's operations, or are a regular
way of conducting a legitimate enterprise. This aligns with the proposition
that even a scheme targeting one victim can satisfy the continuity
requirement if it contemplates ongoing fraudulent activity.
Skurkey v. Daniel
U.S. District Court — Western District of Oklahoma

=== PAGE 12 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
To plead a valid RICO claim, a plaintiff must plausibly allege that a
defendant “(1) conducted the affairs (2) of an enterprise (3) through a
pattern (4) of racketeering activity.” ... The Supreme Court has explained
that there are two elements to finding a pattern for RICO purposes:
“continuity plus relationship.” ... Plaintiff argues the Complaint alleges facts
to support both open- and closed-ended continuity. ... The same holds true if
the Court considers whether Plaintiff has alleged continuity under an open-
ended theory because Plaintiff has not alleged facts that show a clear threat
of future criminal conduct related to past criminal conduct.
Summary
Requirements for a valid RICO claim, emphasizing the need for a pattern of
racketeering activity, which includes continuity and relationship. It discusses
both open- and closed-ended continuity, which are relevant to the
proposition that the FAC alleges an ongoing enterprise with a risk of further
predicate acts. The passage also highlights the importance of demonstrating
a threat of future criminal conduct for open-ended continuity, which aligns
with the proposition's focus on an ongoing risk of racketeering activity.

Extract
In H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106
L.Ed.2d 195 (1989), the Supreme Court reiterated the well-established
concept that racketeering acts form a 'pattern' in RICO where they exhibit
'continuity plus relationship.' ... With respect to the 'continuity' requirement,
the Supreme Court stated that the predicate acts must amount to, or pose a
threat of, continuing racketeering activity. ... continuity 'is both a closed- and
open-ended concept, referring to a closed period of repeated conduct, or to
past conduct that by its nature projects into the future with a threat of
repetition.' ... Predicates extending over merely a few weeks or months, on
the other hand, may satisfy the continuity element if there is a threat of
repetition in the future. This latter concept of continuity, which occurs over
an 'open period,' is established by showing that the predicate acts are a
'regular way of conducting the enterprise's ongoing business.'
Summary
Concept of "continuity" in RICO cases, as defined by the Supreme Court in
H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co. It explains that continuity can be both
closed-ended and open-ended, with the latter involving a threat of future
repetition. This aligns with the proposition that the FAC alleges an ongoing
enterprise with a risk of further predicate acts, which is consistent with the

Tenth Circuit's recognition that even a scheme targeting one victim can
satisfy the continuity requirement if it involves open-ended fraudulent
activity.
Purvis v. Hamwi, 828 F.Supp. 1479 (D. Colo. 1993)
U.S. District Court — District of Colorado
Extract
‘Continuity’ is both a closed- and openended concept, referring either to a
closed period of repeated conduct, or to past conduct that by its nature
projects into the future with the threat of repetition.
Summary
The passage from "Purvis v. Hamwi" discusses the concept of "continuity" in
the context of RICO, which is relevant to the proposition. It explains that
continuity can be either closed-ended or open-ended, with the latter
involving past conduct that projects into the future with the threat of
repetition. This aligns with the proposition's argument that the FAC alleges
an ongoing enterprise with a real risk of further predicate acts, thus
satisfying the continuity requirement. The passage supports the idea that
even if a scheme targets one victim, it can still meet the continuity
requirement if it involves open-ended fraudulent activity.
Wichita Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan v. Landmark Group, Inc., 674 F. Supp. 321 (D.
Kan. 1987)
U.S. District Court — District of Kansas
Extract
The Tenth Circuit has yet to 'formulate a bright-line test' for determining the
existence of a 'pattern'. Torwest DBC, Inc., v. Dick, 810 F.2d 925, 929 (10th
Cir.1987). In Torwest, it found what was not a pattern: a single fraudulent
scheme that has a definite purpose, the completion of which will end the
scheme. In reaching this decision, the Tenth Circuit contrasted the type of
scheme involved in this case, stating: A more difficult question is presented
when the RICO claim is based on one scheme involving one victim, but the
plan contemplates open-ended fraudulent activity and does not have a single
goal that, when achieved, will bring the activity to an end. Some courts have
found that such an ongoing scheme is itself sufficient to satisfy the
continuity element of a RICO pattern.

Summary
Tenth Circuit's approach to determining a "pattern" under RICO, specifically
referencing the Torwest case. It highlights that a scheme involving one
victim can still meet the continuity requirement if it involves open-ended
fraudulent activity without a single goal that concludes the scheme. This
aligns with the proposition that the FAC alleges an ongoing enterprise with
an unfulfilled objective, distinguishing it from isolated schemes.
Bumgarner v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Kansas, 716 F. Supp. 493 (D.
Kan. 1988)
U.S. District Court — District of Kansas
Extract
Further, in Torwest DBC, Inc. v. Dick, 810 F.2d 925, 929 (10th Cir. 1987), the
Tenth Circuit appears to approve of decisions of other circuits that allow a
RICO claim to proceed given evidence of a single scheme involving one
victim and continuous fraudulent activity.
Summary
The passage from the "Bumgarner v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Kansas"
judgment references the Tenth Circuit's decision in Torwest DBC, Inc. v.
Dick, which supports the idea that a RICO claim can be based on a single
scheme involving one victim if there is continuous fraudulent activity. This
aligns with the proposition that the FAC alleges an ongoing enterprise with
an unfulfilled objective and a risk of further predicate acts, as it suggests
that such a scheme can meet the continuity requirement for RICO claims.
Raymark Industries, Inc. v. Stemple, 714 F.Supp. 460 (D. Kan. 1988)
U.S. District Court — District of Kansas
Extract
The Torwest court further held that in order to satisfy the 'continuity'
requirement there must be a threat of ongoing activity. 810 F.2d at 928. In
Torwest, the court held that a single fraudulent scheme which has a definite
purpose, the completion of which will end the scheme, does not have
sufficient 'continuity'.
Summary
The Tenth Circuit requires a threat of ongoing activity to satisfy the
continuity requirement under RICO. The court in Torwest DBC, Inc. v. Dick
emphasized that a single scheme with a definite end does not meet this

requirement. This supports the proposition that an ongoing enterprise with
an unfulfilled objective and a risk of further acts can meet the continuity
requirement, even if it targets a single victim.

The Fourth Circuit expressly embraced the rationale of the Seventh Circuit
by adopting a multi-factor test.(76) In the wake of H.J. Inc., the court broadly
interpreted the continuity requirement, holding that there was 'no question
that a single scheme may be sufficient to establish a pattern.'(77) ... United
States v. Kirk, 844 F.2d 660, 664 (9th Cir.) (predicate acts may constitute
pattern of racketeering activity even though only one scheme involved), cert.
denied, 488 U.S. 890 (1988); ... Landry v. Airline Pilots Ass'n, 901 F.2d 404,
432 (5th Cir.) (relationship element satisfied by predicate acts' relationship
to single scheme with single goal, and continuity element satisfied by threat
of continued racketeering), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 895 (1990).
Summary
The passage discusses how different Circuit Courts, including the Fourth,
Ninth, and Fifth Circuits, have interpreted the continuity requirement under
the RICO statute. It highlights that a single scheme can establish a pattern
of racketeering activity if there is a threat of continued activity. This aligns
with the Tenth Circuit's recognition that a scheme targeting one victim can
satisfy the continuity requirement if it contemplates open-ended fraudulent
activity. The passage supports the proposition by showing that courts have
accepted the idea that continuity can be established even in cases involving
a single scheme or victim, provided there is a threat of ongoing activity.

The relationship prong is defined by the connection of the defendant's
criminal acts to one another. As the Court wrote: '[c]riminal conduct forms a
pattern if it embraces criminal acts that have the same or similar purposes,
results, participants, victims, or methods of commission, or otherwise are
interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not isolated events.'
'Continuity' is successfully proved if a prosecutor can show actual continuity
during a past, closed period of repeated conduct or the threat of continuity

of racketeering activity in the future. The Court seemed to propose a case-
by-case examination of this issue by noting that the existence of a 'threat of
continued racketeering activity' is a function of the particular facts.
Summary
The concept of "continuity" in RICO cases can be established by
demonstrating either a past pattern of repeated conduct or a threat of future
racketeering activity. The passage emphasizes that the determination of a
"threat of continued racketeering activity" is fact-specific, aligning with the
proposition that even a scheme targeting one victim can meet the continuity
requirement if it suggests ongoing fraudulent activity.

The 'continuity' prong is satisfied by proof of either closed-ended continuity
or open-ended continuity. Closed-ended continuity in the RICO context may
be demonstrated 'by proving a series of related predicates extending over a
substantial period of time.' Open-ended continuity in the RICO context is
conduct that may last only a short period of time but nonetheless, poses a
threat of extending into the future. The Court suggested a case-by-case
examination of this issue, noting that the existence of a 'threat of continued
racketeering activity' is a function of particular facts.
Summary
Concept of continuity in RICO cases, explaining that continuity can be either
closed-ended or open-ended. Open-ended continuity is particularly relevant
to the proposition as it involves conduct that poses a threat of extending into
the future, which aligns with the idea of an ongoing enterprise and
unfulfilled objectives. The passage also emphasizes the need for a case-by-
case examination, which supports the argument that the Tenth Circuit's
recognition of schemes targeting one victim can satisfy the continuity
requirement if they involve open-ended fraudulent activity.

The relationship prong is defined by the connection of the defendant's
criminal acts to one another: 'continuity' is successfully proved if a
prosecutor can show actual continuity during a past, closed period of
repeated conduct or an open-ended threat of continued racketeering activity
in the future. (53) The H.J., Inc. Court suggested a case-by-case examination
of this issue... Allwaste, Inc. v. Hecht, 65 F.3d 1523 (9th Cir. 1995) (holding
that defendant gave no indication of ceasing alleged kickback schemes,
thereby satisfying the continuity requirement)... Resolution Trust Corp. v.
Stone, 998 F.2d 1534, 1544 (10th Cir. 1993) (holding that alleged scheme
which may have lasted from seven to as much as eighteen months met
continuity requirement).
Summary
Concept of "continuity" in the context of RICO, explaining that continuity
can be established by showing either a past period of repeated conduct or
an open-ended threat of continued racketeering activity. The passage
references cases where continuity was found due to the ongoing nature of
the criminal activity or the lack of indication that the activity would cease.
This aligns with the proposition that the FAC alleges an ongoing enterprise
with a risk of further predicate acts, which can satisfy the continuity
requirement even if the scheme targets a single victim.

The 'continuity' component is met by either closed-ended continuity, defined
as 'a series of related predicates extending over a substantial period of
time,' or open-ended continuity, defined as conduct that poses a... likelihood
of predicate acts continuing into the future or by showing that predicate
acts occur in normal course of entity's business... Blandford, 33 F.3d at
703-04 (finding continuity and relatedness in mail fraud scheme that took
place over six years and threatened to occur in future because defendants
denied any wrongdoing).
Summary
Concept of continuity under RICO, which can be satisfied by either closed-
ended or open-ended continuity. Open-ended continuity is particularly
relevant to the proposition as it involves conduct that poses a likelihood of
continuing into the future, aligning with the idea of an ongoing enterprise
and unfulfilled objectives. The passage also references cases where
continuity was found due to the threat of future criminal conduct,

Extract
The Supreme Court made a second attempt to clarify the 'pattern' concept in
H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co. In that case, the Supreme Court
held that in order to prove a 'pattern of racketeering activity,' a prosecutor
must show both relationship and continuity as separate elements. However,
the Court recognized that proof of these factors will often overlap. The
relationship prong is defined by the connection of the defendant's criminal
acts to one another. 'Continuity' is successfully proved if a prosecutor can
show actual continuity during a past, closed period of repeated conduct or
the threat of continued racketeering activity in the future.

Summary
Supreme Court's interpretation of the "pattern" requirement under RICO,
emphasizing the need to demonstrate both relationship and continuity. The
continuity element can be satisfied by showing either past repeated conduct
or a threat of continued racketeering activity. This aligns with the
proposition that even a scheme targeting one victim can meet the continuity
requirement if it involves open-ended fraudulent activity, as recognized by
the Tenth Circuit.

The Tenth Circuit has posited a multi-factor approach in its pattern
analysis(91) and adopted a flexible continuity analysis.(92)... Resolution
Trust Corp. v. Stone, 998 F.2d 1534, 1544 (10th Cir. 1993) (holding that
alleged scheme that may have lasted from seven to as much as eighteen
months met continuity requirement).
Summary
The Tenth Circuit employs a flexible continuity analysis and considers
multiple factors in its pattern analysis. This aligns with the proposition that
the Tenth Circuit recognizes schemes that may not be isolated or complete,
especially if they involve ongoing or open-ended fraudulent activity. The
reference to the Resolution Trust Corp. v. Stone case supports the idea that
even schemes lasting several months can meet the continuity requirement,
which is relevant to the proposition that the FAC alleges an ongoing risk of
racketeering activity.

Extract
The Tenth Circuit has devised a more demanding standard for showing a
pattern. Where the directors of a corporation were involved in self-dealing
by secretly purchasing real estate and fraudulently reselling it to the
company, the Tenth Circuit ruled that no pattern existed even though the
frauds had occurred over a 10-year period. Torwest DBC, Inc. v. Dick thus
rejected the Fifth Circuit’s reasoning in R.A.G.S. and refused to find a
pattern where 'the single scheme at issue involved one victim.' The court
explained: 'A scheme to achieve a single discrete objective does not in and of
itself create a threat of ongoing activity, even when that goal is pursued by
multiple illegal acts, because the scheme ends when the purpose is
accomplished.'
Summary
Tenth Circuit's approach to determining a pattern of racketeering activity,
emphasizing that a single scheme with a discrete objective does not
necessarily indicate ongoing activity. However, the proposition highlights
that the FAC alleges an ongoing enterprise with an unfulfilled objective,
which aligns with the Tenth Circuit's recognition that a scheme targeting
one victim can satisfy the continuity requirement if it contemplates open-
ended fraudulent activity. The passage supports the proposition by
illustrating the Tenth Circuit's criteria for continuity and the potential for
ongoing risk.

A plaintiff may demonstrate a pattern by establishment that the predicate
acts pose a threat of continued criminal activity, which is generally
demonstrated by showing either: ... Open-ended continuity. A threat of
'continuing criminal activity extending indefinitely into the future,' in light of
the nature of the enterprise and predicate acts alleged.
Summary
The passage from "RICO: A Primer" explains that a pattern of racketeering
activity can be established by demonstrating a threat of continued criminal
activity, specifically through open-ended continuity. This aligns with the
proposition that the FAC alleges an ongoing enterprise with a risk of further
predicate acts, as it suggests that the continuity requirement can be
satisfied if there is a threat of ongoing criminal activity. The Tenth Circuit's
recognition of open-ended fraudulent activity as satisfying the continuity
requirement is consistent with this explanation.
