Question
The complainant was denied the opportunity to be heard on an emergency
matter affecting the safety and welfare of his child. The Due Process Clause
of the Fourteenth Amendment and Texas law require that parties be afforded
a meaningful opportunity to be heard, especially in matters involving
fundamental rights such as parenting. (See Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57,
65 (2000); Tex. Fam. Code § 153.002). Judge Stone’s refusal to hear the
emergency TRO is intolerable because it deprived the complainant of due
process and the opportunity to protect his child’s welfare, violating both
constitutional and statutory protections.
Answer (Texas)
Short response
Judge Stone’s refusal to hear the complainant’s emergency TRO concerning
his child’s safety and welfare violated both the Due Process Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment and Texas statutory law, which require that parents
be afforded a meaningful opportunity to be heard in such matters. The
denial of this opportunity constitutes a deprivation of fundamental rights
and fails to meet the procedural and substantive protections mandated by
both constitutional and Texas family law.
Summary
The law is clear that both the United States Constitution and Texas statutes
protect a parent’s fundamental right to participate in proceedings affecting
the care, custody, and welfare of their child. When a court refuses to hear an
emergency request—such as a temporary restraining order (TRO) intended
to protect a child’s safety—it not only disregards statutory requirements for
prompt and meaningful hearings but also infringes upon the parent’s
constitutional right to due process.
Texas Family Code provisions, supported by a robust body of case law,
require courts to prioritize the best interest of the child and to provide
parents with notice and an opportunity to be heard before issuing or
denying orders that affect parental rights. The Due Process Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment, as interpreted by both the U.S. Supreme Court and
Texas courts, further demands that parents be given a meaningful chance to
present their case, especially in emergency situations where fundamental
rights are at stake. Judge Stone’s refusal to hear the emergency TRO thus
represents a clear violation of both statutory and constitutional protections.

Background and Relevant Law
Legislative and Regulatory Framework
Texas Family Code § 153.002 establishes that the best interest of the child
is the primary consideration in all conservatorship and access
determinations. This statutory mandate underscores the importance of
judicial responsiveness to emergency matters affecting a child’s welfare, as
the court’s primary duty is to safeguard the child’s best interests, which
necessarily includes considering urgent parental concerns, see Tex. Fam.
Code § 153.002 (2025).
Texas Family Code § 105.001 authorizes courts to issue temporary orders
—including TROs and temporary injunctions—for the safety and welfare of
the child. Notably, the statute allows for such orders to be granted without
the necessity of an affidavit or verified pleading in certain circumstances,
reflecting the legislature’s intent to ensure that urgent matters can be
addressed swiftly and without procedural barriers that could endanger a
child, see Tex. Fam. Code § 105.001 (2025).
Texas Family Code § 156.006 governs temporary orders in modification
suits, requiring that if a parent alleges circumstances that would
significantly impair the child’s physical health or emotional development,
and supports this with an adequate affidavit, the court must set a hearing.
The statute explicitly states that the court shall deny relief and decline to
schedule a hearing only if the affidavit is inadequate; otherwise, a hearing is
mandatory, see Tex. Fam. Code § 156.006 (2025).
Texas Family Code § 152.311 (supplementary) further requires that, in
cases involving imminent risk to a child, a hearing must be held on the next
judicial day after a warrant is executed, or as soon as possible, reinforcing
the statutory imperative for prompt judicial action in emergencies, see Tex.
Fam. Code § 152.311 (2025).
Case Law
Texas courts have consistently held that due process requires notice and a
meaningful opportunity to be heard before any order is entered that affects
a parent’s rights to custody or access.
In In re Ramirez, the Texas Court of Appeals found that a trial court’s
failure to provide notice and an adversarial hearing before modifying
custody constituted an abuse of discretion, affirming the necessity of
procedural protections in such cases, see In re Ramirez, 04-24-00361-CV
(Tex. App. Aug 14, 2024).
In re Farmer and In re Chester both reinforce that, under Texas Family
Code § 105.001, parents are entitled to notice and an adversarial hearing
before temporary orders affecting custody or access are entered. The courts
have made clear that even temporary restrictions on parental rights require

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
strict adherence to due process, see In re Farmer (Tex. App. 2023); In re
Chester, 357 S.W.3d 103 (Tex. App. 2011).
In re C.M.D. and In re E.R. further establish that, even when emergency
action is taken without prior notice (such as an ex parte removal), a full
adversarial hearing must follow within a statutorily prescribed period, and
due process cannot be sacrificed for procedural expediency, see In re
C.M.D., NUMBER 13-20-00402-CV (Tex. App. Feb 11, 2021); In re E.R., 385
S.W.3d 552 (Tex. 2012).
At the constitutional level, Troxel v. Granville (as cited and applied in Texas
cases such as In re C.J.C., Marquez v. Cantu, and Whitworth v.
Whitworth) recognizes the fundamental liberty interest of parents in the
care, custody, and control of their children, protected by the Due Process
Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Texas courts have repeatedly affirmed
that this right cannot be infringed without strict adherence to procedural
due process, see In re C.J.C., 603 S.W.3d 804 (Tex. 2020); Marquez v. Cantu,
NO. 03-17-00795-CV (Tex. App. Jul 25, 2018); Whitworth v. Whitworth, 222
S.W.3d 616 (Tex. App. 2007).
Schlittler v. State and In re Pensom reiterate that the Due Process Clause
provides both substantive and procedural protections, including heightened
protection against governmental interference with fundamental rights such
as parenting, see Schlittler v. State, 488 S.W.3d 306 (Tex. Crim. App. 2016); 
In re Pensom, 126 S.W.3d 251 (Tex. App. 2003).
Young v. Martinez and Page v. Sherrill are particularly instructive, as
they address the egregiousness of denying a parent any opportunity to be
heard in proceedings affecting their child, holding that such denials are
fundamentally inconsistent with due process, see Young v. Martinez, 685
S.W.2d 361 (Tex. App. 1984); Page v. Sherrill, 415 S.W.2d 642 (Tex. 1967).
Secondary Materials
Secondary sources reinforce these principles, emphasizing that parents have
a substantive due process right to family integrity, and that procedural due
process requires the right to be heard at a meaningful time and in a
meaningful manner. These materials clarify that the extent of procedural
protections may vary with the circumstances, but the core requirement of a
meaningful opportunity to participate in proceedings is non-negotiable, see 
CHAPTER 15 Representing Parents on Appeal.
Analysis
Statutory Requirements for a Hearing
Texas law is unequivocal in its requirement that courts provide parents with
a meaningful opportunity to be heard in matters affecting the safety and
welfare of their children. Tex. Fam. Code § 153.002 mandates that the best
interest of the child is the court’s primary consideration, which cannot be

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
determined without affording parents the chance to present their concerns,
especially in emergencies.
Tex. Fam. Code § 105.001 and § 156.006 provide mechanisms for parents
to seek immediate relief to protect their children. These statutes are
designed to ensure that courts are accessible and responsive to urgent
situations, and they require that, upon a sufficient showing of risk to the
child, a hearing must be set. The statutory language leaves little room for
judicial discretion to refuse a hearing when the statutory prerequisites are
met.
Tex. Fam. Code § 152.311 further underscores the legislative intent for
prompt hearings in emergency situations, requiring that hearings on
petitions involving imminent risk to a child be held at the earliest possible
judicial opportunity.
Constitutional Due Process
The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, as interpreted by the
U.S. Supreme Court and Texas courts, protects the fundamental right of
parents to direct the upbringing of their children. This right is not merely
substantive but also procedural: parents must be given notice and a
meaningful opportunity to be heard before the state can interfere with their
parental rights.
Troxel v. Granville and its progeny in Texas law establish that the state
cannot infringe on parental rights without due process. Texas courts have
repeatedly held that even temporary orders affecting custody or access
require notice and a hearing, and that any significant risk of erroneous
deprivation of parental rights is constitutionally unacceptable.
The Eldridge due process analysis, as applied in In re M.S., requires
courts to balance the private interests at stake, the government’s interest,
and the risk of erroneous deprivation. In the context of emergency child
welfare matters, the private interest (the parent’s right to protect and care
for their child) is at its zenith, and the risk of erroneous deprivation is high if
the parent is denied a hearing.
Application to the Scenario
Judge Stone’s refusal to hear the complainant’s emergency TRO is directly
at odds with both statutory and constitutional requirements. The statutes
cited above require that, upon a sufficient showing of risk to the child, a
hearing must be set. The refusal to even consider the emergency request
deprives the parent of the opportunity to present evidence, challenge
opposing claims, and protect the child’s welfare.
From a constitutional perspective, the denial of a hearing in this context is a
clear violation of due process. The parent’s right to be heard is not a mere
formality; it is a fundamental protection against arbitrary or erroneous
deprivation of parental rights. The courts have repeatedly emphasized that

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
the risk of erroneous deprivation is unacceptable, and that due process must
prevail over procedural expediency or judicial convenience.
The case law is replete with examples where Texas appellate courts have
found abuse of discretion or reversible error when trial courts failed to
provide notice and a hearing before entering orders affecting parental
rights. The refusal to hear an emergency TRO—especially one alleging
imminent risk to a child—falls squarely within the category of actions that
courts have condemned as violative of due process.
Judicial Discretion and Its Limits
While courts have some discretion in managing their dockets and
determining the sufficiency of pleadings, this discretion does not extend to
refusing to hear emergency matters where statutory prerequisites are met.
The statutes and case law make clear that, once a parent has made a
sufficient showing of risk to the child, the court must set a hearing. Any
refusal to do so is not a permissible exercise of judicial discretion but a
violation of statutory and constitutional mandates.
The Role of Emergency Proceedings
Texas law recognizes that, in certain emergencies, ex parte orders may be
necessary to protect a child. However, even in such cases, the law requires
that a full adversarial hearing follow promptly, ensuring that parents have
the opportunity to contest the order and present their case. The refusal to
hear an emergency TRO, therefore, cannot be justified on the grounds of
judicial efficiency or procedural technicalities.
Harm and Prejudice
The harm caused by denying a parent the opportunity to be heard in an
emergency matter is not merely procedural; it is substantive. The parent is
deprived of the ability to protect their child, and the child’s welfare may be
placed at risk. The courts have recognized that any significant risk of
erroneous deprivation of parental rights is unacceptable, and that the denial
of a meaningful hearing exacerbates the harm suffered by both parent and
child.
Exceptions and Caveats
There are limited circumstances in which a court may act without notice or
a hearing, such as issuing an ex parte order in an emergency. However, even
in these cases, Texas law requires that a prompt hearing follow, and that the
parent be given the opportunity to contest the order. The statutes do not
permit a court to simply refuse to hear an emergency request where the
parent has made a sufficient showing of risk to the child.
If the parent’s pleadings or affidavit are insufficient to establish a risk to the
child’s safety or welfare, the court may deny relief without a hearing.
However, the facts as presented indicate that the complainant was denied

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
any opportunity to be heard, not that his pleadings were found insufficient.
In the absence of a finding of insufficiency, the refusal to hear the
emergency TRO is indefensible under both statutory and constitutional law.
Conclusion
Judge Stone’s refusal to hear the complainant’s emergency TRO concerning
his child’s safety and welfare constitutes a clear violation of both Texas
statutory law and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
Texas statutes require that parents be afforded a meaningful opportunity to
be heard in emergency matters affecting their children, and the
constitutional protections of due process demand no less. The denial of this
opportunity is not only procedurally improper but also a substantive
infringement on the fundamental rights of both parent and child. The law is
unequivocal: parents must be given notice and a meaningful opportunity to
be heard before any order is entered that affects their rights, especially in
emergencies where the welfare of a child is at stake.
Legal Authorities
In re Crystal Aubin, 29 S.W.3d 199 (Tex. App. 2000)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The Texas Supreme Court has acknowledged that mandamus may issue
where the legal process itself would violate the relator's constitutional
rights. Tilton v. Marshall, 925 S.W.2d 672, 682 (Tex. 1996). Absent a finding,
supported by evidence, that the safety and welfare of the children is
significantly impaired by the denial of the Burks' visitation, Aubin's decision
regarding whether the children will have any contact with the Burks is an
exercise of her fundamental right as a parent. That right is shielded from
judicial interference by the Due Process clause of the United States
Constitution. ... Albeit, Troxel v. Granville, ___ U.S. ___, 120 S.Ct. 2054, 147
L.Ed.2d 49, 68 U.S.L.W. 4458, (2000), was not handed down by our United
States Supreme Court until the year 2000, the fundamental rights of
parents, to the exclusion of others, have long been recognized through the
Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
Summary
The passage highlights the recognition of parental rights as fundamental
rights protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. It
emphasizes that judicial interference with these rights requires a significant
justification, such as evidence of impairment to the child's safety and
welfare. The reference to Troxel v. Granville further underscores the
heightened protection against government interference with parental rights.
This supports the proposition that the complainant was denied due process

welfare.
In re Pensom, 126 S.W.3d 251 (Tex. App. 2003)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The United States Supreme Court has recognized that the interest of
parents in the care, custody, and control of their children 'is perhaps the
oldest of the fundamental liberty interests.' Troxel, 530 U.S. at 65, 120 S.Ct.
at 2060. Similarly, Texas has long recognized that the natural right existing
between parents and their children is of constitutional dimensions. See
Wiley v. Spratlan, 543 S.W.2d 349, 352 (Tex.1976); Holick v. Smith, 685 S.W.
2d 18, 20 (Tex.1985); Tex. Hum. Res.Code Ann. § 40.002(b)(2) (Vernon
2001). These parental interests are a fundamental right protected by the
Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States
Constitution. Troxel, 530 U.S. at 65, 120 S.Ct. at 2060.
Summary
The passage highlights the recognition by both the United States Supreme
Court and Texas law that parental rights in the care, custody, and control of
their children are fundamental liberty interests protected by the Due
Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. This supports the proposition
that the complainant should have been afforded a meaningful opportunity to
be heard, especially in an emergency matter affecting the welfare of his
child. The refusal to hear the emergency TRO could be seen as a violation of
these fundamental rights.
In re E.L.T., 93 S.W.3d 372 (Tex. App. 2002)
Texas Court of Appeals

Two years ago, the United States Supreme Court reaffirmed the liberty
interest of parents to direct the upbringing of their children as 'perhaps the
oldest of the fundamental liberties' recognized by the Court. Troxel v.
Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 65, 120 S.Ct. 2054, 147 L.Ed.2d 49 (2000). After
briefly surveying 'extensive precedent,' the Court firmly pronounced that 'it
cannot now be doubted that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment protects the fundamental right of parents to make decisions
concerning the care, custody, and control of their children.' Id. at 66, 120
S.Ct. 2054. Accordingly, the Fourteenth Amendment governs a state's
attempt to terminate the relationship between parent and child.

Summary
The passage from "In re E.L.T." highlights the fundamental liberty interest of
parents in directing the upbringing of their children, as recognized by the
U.S. Supreme Court in Troxel v. Granville. It emphasizes that the Due
Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment protects the fundamental
right of parents to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control
of their children. This directly supports the proposition that the complainant
was denied due process when not given the opportunity to be heard on an
emergency matter affecting his child's welfare, as such matters involve
fundamental parental rights.
Schlittler v. State, 488 S.W.3d 306 (Tex. Crim. App. 2016)
Texas Court of Criminal Appeals
Extract
The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States
Constitution provides that no state shall 'deprive any person of life, liberty,
or property, without due process of law.' U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The
Supreme Court has interpreted this language as encompassing both
substantive and procedural components. Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S.
702, 719–720, 117 S.Ct. 2258, 138 L.Ed.2d 772 (1997). In Glucksberg, the
Supreme Court explained that '[t]he Due Process Clause guarantees more
than fair process, and the liberty it protects includes more than the absence
of physical restraint. The Clause also provides heightened protection against
governmental interference with certain fundamental rights and liberty
interests.'
Summary
The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides both
substantive and procedural protections. It guarantees more than just fair
process; it also offers heightened protection against governmental
interference with fundamental rights and liberty interests, such as
parenting. This supports the proposition that the complainant was denied
due process when not given the opportunity to be heard on an emergency
matter affecting his child's welfare.

to due process that 'exists to prevent potential governmental overreach in
cases involving fundamental liberty interests.' Id. at 170 (citing Troxel, 530
U.S. at 65, 120 S.Ct. 2054 ).
Summary
The passage highlights the importance of due process in parental-rights
termination cases, citing Troxel v. Granville, which underscores the
fundamental liberty interest of parents in the care, custody, and control of
their children. This aligns with the proposition that due process is crucial in
matters affecting the safety and welfare of a child, as it prevents
governmental overreach and ensures parents have a meaningful opportunity
to be heard.
In re C.J.C., 603 S.W.3d 804 (Tex. 2020)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
A majority of the Troxel Court found protection for this fundamental right
—'perhaps the oldest of the fundamental liberty interests recognized by this
Court'—within the Fourteenth Amendment. The parties in this case do not
disavow that protection. And the justices in Troxel who might not root this
right in substantive-due-process jurisprudence nevertheless similarly
recognized a 'fundamental right of parents to direct the upbringing of their
children.' Texas jurisprudence underscores this fundamental right, and we
too recognize that it gives rise to a 'legal presumption' that it is in a child's
best interest to be raised by his or her parents. Although the best interest of
the child is the paramount issue in a custody determination, '[t]he
presumption is that the best interest of the children' is served 'by awarding
them' to a parent. Thus, the fit-parent presumption is 'deeply embedded in
Texas law' as part of the determination of a child's best interest.
Summary
The passage highlights the fundamental right of parents to direct the
upbringing of their children, a right protected by the Fourteenth
Amendment as recognized in Troxel v. Granville. It also emphasizes that
Texas law presumes it is in the best interest of the child to be raised by their
parents, a presumption deeply embedded in Texas law. This supports the
proposition that the complainant should have been afforded a meaningful
opportunity to be heard, as the refusal to hear the emergency TRO
potentially violates these fundamental rights.
Whitworth v. Whitworth, 222 S.W.3d 616 (Tex. App. 2007)
Texas Court of Appeals

Extract
It is now firmly established that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment to the United States Constitution protects the fundamental
rights of parents to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and
control of their children. Troxel, 530 U.S. at 66, 120 S.Ct. at 2060; see also
Holick, 685 S.W.2d at 20; In re Mays-Hooper, 189 S.W.3d at 778. As the
Supreme Court opined in Troxel, '[T]he Due Process Clause does not permit
States to infringe on the fundamental right of parents to make child rearing
decisions simply because a state judge believes a `better' decision could be
made.' Troxel, 530 U.S. at 72-73, 120 S.Ct. at 2064.
Summary
The passage from "Whitworth v. Whitworth" emphasizes the fundamental
rights of parents under the Due Process Clause to make decisions regarding
the care, custody, and control of their children. This aligns with the
proposition that the complainant was denied due process when not given the
opportunity to be heard on an emergency matter affecting his child's
welfare. The passage supports the idea that such a denial infringes on the
complainant's constitutional rights, as established in Troxel v. Granville.

Texas Supreme Court
Extract
In conducting an Eldridge due process analysis, we weigh three factors—the
private interests at stake, the government’s interest in the proceeding, and
the risk of erroneous deprivation of parental rights—and balance the net
result against the presumption that our procedural rule comports with
constitutional due process requirements. ... The parent’s, child’s, and
government’s interest in a just and accurate decision dovetails with the third
Eldridge factor—that of the risk of erroneous deprivation. Termination of
parental rights is traumatic, permanent, and irrevocable. This fact has been
pivotal for the United States Supreme Court. And it is to us. For this reason,
any significant risk of erroneous deprivation is unacceptable.
Summary
Application of the Eldridge due process analysis, which considers the private
interests at stake, the government's interest, and the risk of erroneous
deprivation of rights. It emphasizes the importance of a just and accurate
decision in parental rights cases, highlighting the traumatic and irrevocable
nature of terminating parental rights. This aligns with the proposition that
due process requires a meaningful opportunity to be heard, especially in
matters involving fundamental rights such as parenting.

Most state courts that have considered the issue have reached a similar
conclusion: due process prevails over a state law time limit, even one

the statute's time limits cannot foreclose an attack by a parent who was

Young v. Martinez, 685 S.W.2d 361 (Tex. App. 1984)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Even if we assume in the instant case the trial court had sufficient evidence
upon which to issue a temporary order for the immediate protection of the
children involved, this court is disturbed by the lack of a meaningful
hearing. ... The very person who invoked the trial court's jurisdiction by
filing the writ of habeas corpus, Young, was completely denied the
opportunity to offer any evidence or even to make a bill of exceptions when
the trial court denied relief, although she stood ready and willing to do so.
Recently this court has expressed its unfaltering belief in the fundamental
right of a litigant to be heard under the due process clause of the United
States and Texas Constitutions. ... The denial of Young's right to be heard,
together with the type of orders entered in this case by the trial court, serve
to make the harm suffered more egregious.
Summary
The passage highlights the importance of a meaningful hearing in cases
involving the welfare of children, as guaranteed by the due process clause of
the United States and Texas Constitutions. It underscores the court's
concern when a party is denied the opportunity to present evidence or make
a bill of exceptions, which is a fundamental right. This aligns with the
proposition that the complainant was denied due process when not afforded
a hearing on an emergency matter affecting his child's welfare.

Relator contends further that the taking of her children without notice was a
violation of due process, relying principally upon the authority of Armstrong
v. Manzo, 380 U.S. 545, 85 S.Ct. 1187, 14 L.Ed.2d 62 (1965). In that decision
the United States Supreme Court held that failure to notify a divorced
parent of the pendency of proceedings for the adoption of his child
constituted a deprivation of due process of law. The Court stated that
without doubt notice is required where 'the result of the judicial proceeding

was permanently to deprive a legitimate parent of all that parenthood
implies.'
Summary
Due process requirement of notifying parents in proceedings that could
permanently affect their parental rights. It references the U.S. Supreme
Court's decision in Armstrong v. Manzo, which emphasizes the necessity of
notice in proceedings that could deprive a parent of their rights. This
supports the proposition that due process requires a meaningful opportunity
to be heard, especially in matters involving fundamental rights such as
parenting.

of a child, and that parties are entitled to notice and an adversary hearing
before such orders are made. This supports the proposition that the
complainant should have been afforded an opportunity to be heard, as the
denial of such an opportunity would violate the procedural requirements
outlined in the Texas Family Code and due process principles.
In re C.M.D., NUMBER 13-20-00402-CV (Tex. App. Feb 11, 2021)
Texas Court of Appeals

=== PAGE 14 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
Following the issuance of an emergency removal order without prior notice
or hearing, a full adversarial hearing must be held 'not later than the 14th
day after the date the child was taken into possession by the governmental
entity, unless the court grants an extension.' Id. § 262.201. The provision
additionally mandates the child’s return to the parent 'unless' the evidence
adduced at a full adversary hearing suffices to 'satisfy a person of ordinary
prudence and caution' that, among other things, 'the urgent need for
protection required the immediate removal of the child and reasonable
efforts, consistent with circumstances and providing for the safety of the
child, were made to eliminate or prevent the child’s removal.' ... The
adversary hearing affords the parents the opportunity to present evidence
on their own behalf, hear and challenge the Department’s evidence, and
challenge the Department’s right to retain the children it previously took
into custody under an ex parte order.
Summary
Texas law mandates a full adversarial hearing within a specific timeframe
following an emergency removal of a child. This hearing is crucial as it
provides parents the opportunity to be heard, present evidence, and
challenge the removal. The requirement for such a hearing aligns with due
process principles, ensuring that parents have a meaningful opportunity to
contest actions affecting their fundamental rights, such as parenting. The
passage underscores the importance of judicial oversight and the
opportunity for parents to be heard, which directly supports the proposition
that denying such an opportunity violates due process.
Stary v. Ethridge, 695 S.W.3d 417 (Tex. App. 2022)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The indefinite duration of this order prohibiting contact between a parent
and her children effectively terminated Stary’s parental rights and deprived
her of the fundamental liberty interests in the care, custody, and control of
her children. United States Supreme Court precedent holds that before such
a deprivation may occur, due process requires the trial court to apply a
heightened standard of proof: clear and convincing evidence. The trial
court’s implementation of a lifetime protective order against a parent based
on facts found by a mere preponderance of the evidence violated Stary’s
right to due process.
Summary
The passage highlights the importance of due process in cases where
parental rights are at stake. It emphasizes that a heightened standard of

=== PAGE 15 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
proof is required to protect fundamental liberty interests in the care,
custody, and control of children. The dissenting opinion argues that the trial
court's decision violated due process by not applying this heightened
standard, which is relevant to the proposition that the complainant was
denied due process in an emergency matter affecting his child's welfare.
In re Ramirez, 04-24-00361-CV (Tex. App. Aug 14, 2024)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
In Herring, this court determined the trial court abused its discretion by
failing to give notice and an adversary hearing before modifying custody of
the child. Id. Similarly, here, the trial court failed to provide Ramirez notice
of a hearing modifying her possessory rights to the children and a full
adversarial hearing prior to granting Lopez the exclusive right to possession
of the children.
Summary
The Texas Court of Appeals has previously determined that failing to provide
notice and an adversarial hearing before modifying custody constitutes an
abuse of discretion. This supports the proposition that due process requires
a meaningful opportunity to be heard, especially in matters involving
fundamental rights such as parenting.
Rodriguez v. Vela, 488 S.W.2d 872 (Tex. Ct. App. 1972)
Texas Civil Court of Appeals
Extract
Page does no more than affirm the power of a district court to enter such
temporary order without notice to the parent, in a case where the original
jurisdiction of that court to control minors has been properly invoked by
pleadings raising the issue of custody. There is nothing shocking about such
a holding. The power of court to take necessary action, in order to avoid
irreparable harm, without notice to the party affected, in a case in which its
jurisdiction has been properly invoked, has long been recognized. For
example, a court may issue a temporary restraining order without notice.
But this can be done only where there are proper pleadings invoking the
jurisdiction of the court in the first instance.
Summary
The passage from Rodriguez v. Vela discusses the power of Texas district
courts to take immediate action in emergency situations involving minors,

=== PAGE 16 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
even without notice to the affected party, provided that the court's
jurisdiction has been properly invoked through appropriate pleadings. This
supports the proposition that due process requires a meaningful opportunity
to be heard, as it highlights the necessity of proper pleadings to invoke the
court's jurisdiction and the court's ability to act swiftly to protect a child's
welfare. The passage underscores the importance of procedural
requirements to ensure that parties have the opportunity to be heard,
aligning with the due process protections under the Fourteenth Amendment
and Texas law.
Marquez v. Cantu, NO. 03-17-00795-CV (Tex. App. Jul 25, 2018)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
We recognize that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of
the United States Constitution protects parents' fundamental rights to make
decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children. See
Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 65-66, 75 (2000) (discussing cases
addressing due process rights concerning parent's care, custody, and control
of children and holding that application of nonparental visitation statute
violated parent's 'due process right to make decisions concerning the care,
custody, and control of her daughters'); In re M.S., 115 S.W.3d 534, 547-48
(Tex. 2003) (discussing right of parent to maintain custody and raise child in
context of State's termination of parental rights).
Summary
The passage acknowledges the protection of parents' fundamental rights
under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, specifically in
making decisions about the care, custody, and control of their children. This
aligns with the proposition that the complainant was denied due process
when not given the opportunity to be heard on an emergency matter
affecting his child's welfare. The reference to Troxel v. Granville further
supports the argument by highlighting a precedent where parental rights
were upheld under due process considerations.
In re J.W.L., 291 S.W.3d 79 (Tex. App. 2009)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
While the temporary grant of custody to another or the limitation of a
parent's access to a child is not tantamount to absolute termination of
parental rights, trial courts must tread very carefully when they infringe
upon a parent's ability to participate in child rearing. The Supreme Court of

=== PAGE 17 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Texas has recognized that custody determinations that restrict a parent's
access to a child can risk a significant deprivation similar to termination of
the relationship. '[A]ny significant risk of erroneous deprivation [of parental
access to a child] is unacceptable.' ... In other words, trial court interference
with the right of a fit parent to bring up his or her own child impacts a
fundamental right and may violate the Due Process Clause.
Summary
The passage emphasizes the importance of due process in cases where a
parent's access to their child is restricted. It highlights that any significant
risk of erroneous deprivation of parental access is unacceptable and that
such interference impacts a fundamental right, potentially violating the Due
Process Clause. This aligns with the proposition that the complainant was
denied due process when not given the opportunity to be heard on an
emergency matter affecting his child's welfare.
In re Chester, 357 S.W.3d 103 (Tex. App. 2011)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
In a suit affecting the parent-child relationship, the trial court may make a
temporary order for the safety and welfare of the child, including an order
modifying a prior temporary order. Tex. Fam.Code Ann. § 105.001(a) (West
2008). A temporary order for the conservatorship of the child may not be
rendered without notice and a hearing. Tex. Fam.Code Ann. § 105.001(a),
(b), (h); Herring, 221 S.W.3d at 730. ... In this case the legal system was not
properly employed because the most basic of legal principles—due process
notice—was not upheld. See In re Houston Lighting &amp; Power Co., 976
S.W.2d 671, 673 n. 17 (Tex.1998) (orig. proceeding) (listing notice as one of
the basic elements of due process).
Summary
The passage highlights the requirement under Texas law that temporary
orders concerning the conservatorship of a child cannot be made without
notice and a hearing, which are fundamental due process rights. This
supports the proposition that the complainant was denied due process when
not given the opportunity to be heard on an emergency matter affecting his
child's welfare.
Tex. Fam. Code § 153.002 Tex. Fam. Code § 153.002 Best Interest of Child

=== PAGE 18 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
The best interest of the child shall always be the primary consideration of
the court in determining the issues of conservatorship and possession of and
access to the child.
Summary
The passage emphasizes that the best interest of the child is the primary
consideration in legal decisions regarding conservatorship and access. This
aligns with the proposition that the complainant should have been given an
opportunity to be heard, as the welfare of the child is a fundamental
concern. The refusal to hear an emergency TRO could potentially neglect
the child's best interest, which is a statutory requirement under Texas law.
Tex. Fam. Code § 105.001 Tex. Fam. Code § 105.001 Temporary Orders
Before Final Order
Extract
In a suit, the court may make a temporary order, including the modification
of a prior temporary order, for the safety and welfare of the child... Except
as provided by Subsection (c), temporary restraining orders and temporary
injunctions under this section shall be granted without the necessity of an
affidavit or verified pleading stating specific facts showing that immediate
and irreparable injury, loss, or damage will result before notice can be
served and a hearing can be held.
Summary
Texas law allows courts to issue temporary orders for the safety and welfare
of a child without the necessity of an affidavit or verified pleading, indicating
that the process is designed to be accessible and responsive to urgent
situations. This supports the proposition that the complainant should have
been afforded an opportunity to be heard on an emergency matter affecting
his child's welfare, as the law provides mechanisms for such urgent
hearings.

executed unless that date is impossible. In that event, the court shall hold
the hearing on the first judicial day possible.

=== PAGE 19 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
Texas law mandates a prompt hearing on petitions related to the
enforcement of child custody determinations when there is an imminent risk
to the child. This requirement underscores the importance of providing a
timely opportunity to be heard in matters affecting the safety and welfare of
a child. The passage supports the proposition by highlighting the statutory
obligation to hold a hearing at the earliest possible judicial opportunity,
which aligns with the due process requirement for a meaningful opportunity
to be heard.
Tex. Fam. Code § 156.006 Tex. Fam. Code § 156.006 Temporary Orders
Extract
While a suit for modification is pending, the court may not render a
temporary order that has the effect of creating a designation, or changing
the designation, of the person who has the exclusive right to designate the
primary residence of the child, or the effect of creating a geographic area,
or changing or eliminating the geographic area, within which a conservator
must maintain the child's primary residence, under the final order unless the
temporary order is in the best interest of the child and: the order is
necessary because the child's present circumstances would significantly
impair the child's physical health or emotional development... A person who
files a motion for a temporary order authorized by Subsection (b) shall
execute and attach to the motion an affidavit... that contains facts that
support the allegation that the child's present circumstances would
significantly impair the child's physical health or emotional development.
The court shall deny the relief sought and decline to schedule a hearing on
the motion unless the court determines, on the basis of the affidavit, that
facts adequate to support the allegation are stated in the affidavit. If the
court determines that the facts stated are adequate to support the
allegation, the court shall set a time and place for the hearing.
Summary
Texas law provides a mechanism for obtaining temporary orders in suits for
modification when a child's welfare is at risk. The law requires that if a
child's present circumstances could significantly impair their physical health
or emotional development, a hearing must be scheduled if the affidavit
supporting the motion is adequate. This supports the proposition that the
complainant should have been afforded a hearing to address the emergency
matter affecting the child's safety and welfare.
Tex. Fam. Code § 109.001 Tex. Fam. Code § 109.001 Temporary Orders
During Pendency of Appeal

=== PAGE 20 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
In a suit affecting the parent-child relationship, on the motion of any party
or on the court's own motion and after notice and hearing, the court may
make any order necessary to preserve and protect the safety and welfare of
the child during the pendency of an appeal as the court may deem necessary
and equitable.
Summary
The passage from Tex. Fam. Code § 109.001 emphasizes the court's
authority to make necessary orders to protect the safety and welfare of a
child during the pendency of an appeal. This aligns with the proposition that
parties should be afforded a meaningful opportunity to be heard, especially
in matters involving the safety and welfare of a child. The passage supports
the idea that the court has a duty to consider emergency matters affecting a
child's welfare, which is consistent with the complainant's argument that
Judge Stone's refusal to hear the emergency TRO was a denial of due
process.

Columbia Journal of Gender and Law - Columbia University -- JGL -
Conner, Dana Harrington - 2008-06-22
Extract
The Court, in addressing the issue of grandparent visitation, described the
fundamental rights of parents: The liberty interest at issue in this case--the
interest of parents in the care, custody, and control of their children--is
perhaps the oldest of the fundamental liberty interests recognized by this
Court.
Summary
The passage references the U.S. Supreme Court's recognition of the
fundamental liberty interest of parents in the care, custody, and control of
their children, as established in Troxel v. Granville. This supports the
proposition by highlighting the constitutional protection of parental rights
under the Due Process Clause, which requires that parents be given a
meaningful opportunity to be heard in matters affecting their children. The
context of the passage, discussing fundamental parental rights, aligns with
the complainant's argument that he was denied due process when not given
the opportunity to be heard on an emergency matter concerning his child's
welfare.

Summary
Parents have a substantive due process right to family integrity, which is
protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. This right includes the necessity
for procedural due process, which is flexible but fundamentally requires that
parents be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner. The
passage emphasizes the importance of allowing parents to participate
meaningfully in cases affecting their rights, which directly supports the
proposition that the complainant was denied due process when not given the
opportunity to be heard on an emergency matter affecting his child.

Summary
Parents have a substantive due process right to family integrity, which is
protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. This right is considered essential
and more precious than property rights. The passage emphasizes that before
the state can deprive a parent of their rights, due process requirements
must be met, which includes the right to be heard at a meaningful time. This
directly supports the proposition that the complainant was denied due
process when not given the opportunity to be heard on an emergency matter

Suffolk University Law Review - Suffolk University Law School -
2023-03-22
Extract
The United States Constitution does not expressly recognize a parent's right
to direct their child's upbringing. Rather, this liberty is rooted in the
Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause. For decades, the Court has
recognized that the Fourteenth Amendment protects individuals from more
than the physical deprivation of their liberty. In a long line of cases, the
Court has held that the Due Process Clause insulates certain substantive
liberties from the state's reach. To be eligible for protection under the
Court's substantive due process jurisprudence, the value at issue must be so
precious to society that it is implicit in America's conception of ordered
liberty. It is within this judicial framework that the parental right to make
decisions about their child's upbringing finds its home.
Summary
The Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause protects substantive
liberties, including parental rights, from state interference. This protection
is rooted in the recognition that certain rights are fundamental to America's
conception of ordered liberty. The passage supports the proposition by
highlighting the constitutional basis for parental rights, which are
implicated in the complainant's case.
