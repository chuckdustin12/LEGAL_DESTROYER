Question
If a defendant in oklahoma conspires with someone's wife in texas to
defraud the husband of his property interests by filing documents with false
statements with the intention of presenting them to the texas courts and
they contain material false statements, and this plan works, does this open
up a RICO claim if they also transferred money across state lines and
emptied the joint marital bank account under a deceptive promise of
wanting to help if their actions include transferring money across state
lines, and then preparing a false affidavit of inability to pay in oklahoma to
be presented to texas courts as well as an original divorce petition claiming
an active protective order exists against the husband which is not true, and
then the husband was removed from his home which is also his place of
business?
Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
Based on the provided materials, the described scenario could potentially
give rise to a viable RICO claim, as it appears to involve a conspiracy and
pattern of racketeering activities including fraud across state lines that
affected interstate commerce and resulted in injury to the husband's
business and property interests. The presence of multiple predicate acts
(filing false documents, fraudulent transfers of money across state lines,
false statements in court filings) conducted through interstate commerce
could satisfy the requirements for establishing a pattern of racketeering
activity connected to an enterprise.
Summary
The described scenario presents a potential civil RICO claim under 18 U.S.C.
§ 1962, as it involves multiple actors conspiring across state lines to engage
in potentially fraudulent activities that harmed the husband's property and
business interests. The actions described—conspiracy between the
defendant in Oklahoma and the wife in Texas, filing fraudulent documents in
court, transferring money across state lines, emptying joint marital accounts
through deception, filing false affidavits, and making false claims about
protective orders that resulted in the husband's removal from his home/
business—could constitute predicate acts of racketeering activity under
RICO, particularly mail/wire fraud.
To establish a civil RICO claim, the husband would need to demonstrate: (1)
a person who engages in (2) a pattern of racketeering activity (3) connected
to an enterprise (4) affecting interstate commerce, which resulted in injury
to his business or property. The interstate nature of the activities
(Oklahoma-Texas), multiple fraudulent acts over time, and the direct harm to
the husband's property and business interests suggest the potential

elements of a RICO claim are present, though success would depend on
proving specific details about how each act furthered the fraudulent scheme
and demonstrating the defendants' specific intent to defraud.
Background and Relevant Law
RICO Statutory Framework
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) provides
both criminal penalties and civil remedies for certain prohibited activities.
Under 18 U.S.C. § 1962, several activities are prohibited, including:
18 U.S.C. § 1962 provides: "It shall be unlawful for any person through a
pattern of racketeering activity or through collection of an unlawful debt to
acquire or maintain, directly or indirectly, any interest in or control of any
enterprise which is engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or
foreign commerce."
Additionally, subsection (d) states: "It shall be unlawful for any person to
conspire to violate any of the provisions of subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this
section."
To understand what constitutes "racketeering activity" under RICO, we must
look to the definitions provided in 18 U.S.C. § 1961:
18 U.S.C. § 1961 defines "racketeering activity" to include "any act which is
indictable under any of the following provisions of title 18, United States
Code: ... section 1341 (relating to mail fraud), section 1343 (relating to wire
fraud), section 1344 (relating to financial institution fraud)..."
The statute further defines a "pattern of racketeering activity" as requiring
"at least two acts of racketeering activity, one of which occurred after the
effective date of this chapter and the last of which occurred within ten years
(excluding any period of imprisonment) after the commission of a prior act
of racketeering activity."
For wire fraud specifically, 18 U.S.C. § 1343 states: "Whoever, having devised
or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining
money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses,
representations, or promises, transmits or causes to be transmitted by
means of wire, radio, or television communication in interstate or foreign
commerce, any writings, signs, signals, pictures, or sounds for the purpose
of executing such scheme or artifice, shall be fined under this title or
imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both."
Regarding the transportation of funds obtained through fraud across state
lines, 18 U.S.C. § 2314 provides: "Whoever transports, transmits, or
transfers in interstate or foreign commerce any goods, wares, merchandise,
securities or money, of the value of $5,000 or more, knowing the same to
have been stolen, converted or taken by fraud..."

The importance of civil remedies under RICO is highlighted in 18 U.S.C. §
1964, which states: "Any person injured in his business or property by
reason of a violation of section 1962 of this chapter may sue therefor in any
appropriate United States district court and shall recover threefold the
damages he sustains and the cost of the suit, including a reasonable
attorney's fee."
Judicial Interpretation of RICO Elements
Courts have consistently interpreted RICO to require several key elements
for a successful claim. In Peel v. cPaperless LLC, 4:23-CV-02417 (S.D. Tex.
Nov 08, 2024), the court explained: "To state a civil RICO claim under 18
U.S.C. § 1962, a plaintiff must allege three common elements: '(1) a person
who engages in (2) a pattern of racketeering activity, (3) connected to the
acquisition, establishment, conduct, or control of an enterprise.'"
Similarly, in Xenos Yuen v. Triple B Servs. LLP, CIVIL ACTION NO.
H-18-3277 (S.D. Tex. Jun 08, 2019), the court reiterated: "All civil RICO
claims require allegations and proof of '1) a person who engages in 2) a
pattern of racketeering activity 3) [which is] connected to the acquisition,
establishment, conduct or control of an enterprise.'" The court also
emphasized the heightened pleading standards for fraud-based RICO claims:
"In the civil RICO context, Rule 9(b) also requires the plaintiff to allege
specifically how each act of mail or wire fraud furthered the fraudulent
scheme, who caused what to be mailed or wired when, and how the mailing
or wiring furthered the fraudulent scheme."
Cedra Pharmacy Houston, LLC v. UnitedHealth Grp., Inc., CIVIL ACTION
NO. H-17-3800 (S.D. Tex. Mar 07, 2019) further clarified: "A plaintiff in a
civil action may recover damages under the RICO statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1961,
et seq., if he is able to allege and prove: 1) a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(a),
(b), (c), or (d), and 2) injury to business or property as a result of such
violation."
The requirements for establishing a pattern of racketeering activity were
addressed in Allstate Ins. Co. v. Donovan, CIVIL ACTION NO. H-12-0432
(S.D. Tex. Jul 03, 2012): "A pattern of racketeering activity consists of two or
more predicate criminal acts that are (1) related and (2) amount to or pose a
threat of continued criminal activity." The court also noted that "Predicate
acts can be either state or federal crimes" and that "RICO reaches only
those unlawful activities that amount to or threaten long-term criminal
activity."
In Heden v. Hill, 937 F.Supp. 1230 (S.D. Tex. 1996), the court provided
further clarity on what constitutes mail fraud as a predicate act: "For mail
fraud, it is necessary to show that (1) the defendants formed a scheme or
artifice to defraud; (2) the defendants used the United States mails or
caused a use of the United States mails in furtherance of the scheme; and
(3) the defendants did so with the specific intent to deceive or defraud."
Additional insight on the interstate commerce requirement comes from 
Trevino v. Pechero, 592 F.Supp.2d 939 (S.D. Tex. 2008): "Because RICO is a

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
federal statute, the racketeering must have at least a minimal nexus with
interstate commerce."
Secondary Materials on RICO Claims
Secondary sources provide valuable context for understanding RICO claims.
According to Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy, "A violation of § 1962(c), the
section on which Sedima relies, requires (1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3)
through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity." It further notes that "RICO
claims based on mail or wire fraud must comport with Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 9(b)'s requirement that allegations involving fraud be pleaded
with particularity." Importantly, "It is the activities of the enterprise, not
each predicate act, that must affect interstate or foreign commerce. RICO
requires no more than a slight effect upon interstate commerce. Even a
minimal effect on interstate commerce satisfies this jurisdictional
requirement."
PAYORS, PLAYERS, AND PROXIMATE CAUSE explains that RICO "is not just
a tool for government control over organized crime. It is also a remedial
statute for civil matters." It outlines four types of conduct prohibited under §
1962: "(1) using income derived from a pattern of racketeering activity to
acquire an interest in an enterprise; (2) acquiring or maintaining an interest
in an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity; (3) conducting
the affairs of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity; and
(4) conspiring to commit any of these offenses."
Defending Civil RICO Claims: A Defense Plan Should Be In Every Business's
Arsenal notes that RICO "pertains to conduct associated with an 'enterprise'
and 'a pattern racketeering activity,'" defining an enterprise as "an
individual or legal entity, or a union or group of individuals associated in fact
although not a legal entity," and a pattern of racketeering activity as
requiring "long-term, organized conduct to violate state and federal laws."
RICO: A Primer highlights that "[a] pattern may exist where any
combination of two or more offenses occurred within a period of time" and
that continuity can be demonstrated by showing either "Closed-ended
continuity. Proving 'a series of related predicate acts extending over a
substantial period of time'" or "Open-ended continuity. A threat of
'continuing criminal activity extending indefinitely into the future,' in light of
the nature of the enterprise and predicate acts alleged."
Finally, regarding conspiracy between spouses, Federal criminal conspiracy
confirms that "[t]he legal fiction that a husband and wife are one person in
the eyes of the law has been abandoned," meaning "a husband and wife are
legally capable of conspiring with each other."

Analysis
Application of RICO Elements to the Described Scenario
1. Persons Engaged in Prohibited Activities
The scenario describes at least two individuals: a defendant in Oklahoma
and someone's wife in Texas. These individuals could qualify as "persons"
under RICO. As noted in Allstate Ins. Co. v. Donovan, CIVIL ACTION NO.
H-12-0432 (S.D. Tex. Jul 03, 2012), a person who is "employed by or
associated with an enterprise cannot conduct the affairs of the enterprise
through a pattern of racketeering activity."
2. Pattern of Racketeering Activity
The scenario describes multiple potential predicate acts that could
constitute "racketeering activity" under 18 U.S.C. § 1961:
Filing documents with false statements intended for Texas courts
Transferring money across state lines that was fraudulently obtained
Emptying a joint marital bank account under deceptive pretenses
Preparing a false affidavit regarding inability to pay
Filing a divorce petition with false claims about a protective order
Per 18 U.S.C. § 1961, "racketeering activity" includes acts indictable under
various federal criminal statutes, including mail fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1341),
wire fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343), and financial institution fraud (18 U.S.C. §
1344). The transfer of money across state lines could potentially be
indictable under 18 U.S.C. § 2314, which prohibits the transportation of
stolen or fraudulently obtained money across state lines if valued at $5,000
or more.
For these acts to constitute a "pattern of racketeering activity," there must
be at least two related acts that "amount to or pose a threat of continued
criminal activity" as noted in Allstate Ins. Co. v. Donovan, CIVIL ACTION NO.
H-12-0432 (S.D. Tex. Jul 03, 2012). The multiple acts described appear to be
related as part of a coordinated scheme to defraud the husband of his
property and business interests.
The acts also suggest continuity, which could be established under either:
Closed-ended continuity: The acts occurred over a period of time and
involved multiple steps in a coordinated plan.
Open-ended continuity: The nature of the enterprise (defrauding the
husband through divorce proceedings) suggests ongoing fraudulent
activity.
As RICO: A Primer explains, continuity can be demonstrated by showing
either "a series of related predicate acts extending over a substantial period
of time" or a threat of "continuing criminal activity extending indefinitely
into the future."

3. Connection to an Enterprise
An "enterprise" under RICO could be established by showing an association-
in-fact between the defendant in Oklahoma and the wife in Texas. As defined
in Defending Civil RICO Claims: A Defense Plan Should Be In Every
Business's Arsenal, an enterprise can be "an individual or legal entity, or a
union or group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity."
The coordinated efforts between the Oklahoma defendant and the Texas wife
to defraud the husband could constitute such an association-in-fact
enterprise, particularly if they maintained some organizational structure and
common purpose over time.
4. Interstate Commerce Nexus
The scenario clearly involves interstate activity:
The conspiracy spans two states (Oklahoma and Texas)
Money was transferred across state lines
Documents were prepared in Oklahoma for use in Texas courts
As noted in Trevino v. Pechero, 592 F.Supp.2d 939 (S.D. Tex. 2008), "RICO
requires at least a minimal nexus with interstate commerce." Similarly, Civil
Rico: A Tool of Advocacy states that "RICO requires no more than a slight
effect upon interstate commerce. Even a minimal effect on interstate
commerce satisfies this jurisdictional requirement."
The transfer of money across state lines and the preparation of documents
in one state for use in another's courts would likely satisfy this minimal
nexus requirement.
5. Injury to Business or Property
The husband suffered clear injuries to his property interests:
Loss of money from the joint marital account
Removal from his home, which also served as his place of business
18 U.S.C. § 1964 provides that "[a]ny person injured in his business or
property by reason of a violation of section 1962 of this chapter may sue
therefor." The husband's loss of property and business access would likely
qualify as injuries under this provision.
6. Conspiracy Aspect
The scenario explicitly mentions conspiracy between the Oklahoma
defendant and the Texas wife. Under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d), it is "unlawful for
any person to conspire to violate any of the provisions of subsection (a), (b),
or (c) of this section."
As noted in Allstate Ins. Co. v. Donovan, CIVIL ACTION NO. H-12-0432 (S.D.
Tex. Jul 03, 2012), "To demonstrate a civil RICO conspiracy, a claimant must
1. 
2. 
3. 
1. 
2. 

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
show that: (1) two or more persons agreed to commit a substantive RICO
offense, and (2) the defendant knew of and agreed to the overall objective of
the RICO offense."
Importantly, Federal criminal conspiracy confirms that "a husband and wife
are legally capable of conspiring with each other," refuting any potential
defense that spouses cannot legally conspire.
Pleading Requirements
If the husband were to pursue a civil RICO claim, he would need to meet the
heightened pleading requirements for fraud-based claims. As noted in Xenos
Yuen v. Triple B Servs. LLP, CIVIL ACTION NO. H-18-3277 (S.D. Tex. Jun 08,
2019), "Rule 9(b) also requires the plaintiff to allege specifically how each
act of mail or wire fraud furthered the fraudulent scheme, who caused what
to be mailed or wired when, and how the mailing or wiring furthered the
fraudulent scheme."
This means the husband would need to provide specific details about:
How each false document furthered the fraudulent scheme
Who prepared and filed each document and when
How money was transferred across state lines (wire transfers, checks,
etc.)
How each act connected to the overall scheme to defraud
Exceptions and Caveats
Proof of Specific Intent
For predicate acts involving fraud, the plaintiff must demonstrate specific
intent to defraud. As noted in Heden v. Hill, 937 F.Supp. 1230 (S.D. Tex.
1996), for mail fraud, it is necessary to show that "the defendants did so
with the specific intent to deceive or defraud."
The husband would need evidence that the defendants actually intended to
defraud him, rather than merely making misrepresentations during a
contentious divorce proceeding.
Alternative Remedies
While a RICO claim may be viable, the husband might also have alternative
remedies available under state law, such as:
Fraud claims
Conversion claims for the emptied bank account
Remedies within the divorce proceedings themselves
These alternatives might be simpler to pursue than the complex RICO claim.

Pattern Requirement Challenges
To establish a "pattern" of racketeering activity, the plaintiff must show that
the predicate acts are both related and continuous. While the acts described
appear related, demonstrating continuity might be challenging if they all
occurred within a relatively short timeframe and were all directed toward a
single, finite goal (defrauding the husband during divorce proceedings).
As noted in Defending Civil RICO Claims: A Defense Plan Should Be In Every
Business's Arsenal, "If the alleged conduct occurred once or twice, or was
not continuous, it cannot form a pattern of conduct sufficient to support a
RICO claim."
Conclusion
Based on the provided materials, the scenario described could potentially
support a civil RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962. The actions involve
multiple persons engaged in what appears to be a pattern of racketeering
activity connected to an enterprise that affects interstate commerce,
resulting in injury to the husband's business and property.
Key factors supporting a potential RICO claim include:
Multiple predicate acts that could constitute racketeering activity
under 18 U.S.C. § 1961, including potential mail fraud, wire fraud, and
transportation of fraudulently obtained money across state lines.
A conspiracy between at least two individuals (the Oklahoma defendant
and the Texas wife) to engage in these activities.
Clear interstate nexus with activities spanning Oklahoma and Texas.
Direct injury to the husband's property interests and business.
Potential pattern of related acts that suggest continuity of criminal
activity.
However, successfully pursuing such a claim would require meeting
heightened pleading requirements for fraud-based RICO claims, including
specific details about how each act furthered the fraudulent scheme. The
husband would also need to demonstrate the defendants' specific intent to
defraud and establish that the predicate acts truly constitute a pattern of
racketeering activity rather than isolated incidents.
While a RICO claim appears potentially viable based on the facts presented,
its success would depend on specific details not provided in the scenario and
the ability to meet the stringent requirements for establishing each element
of a civil RICO claim. The husband might also want to consider alternative
remedies under state law, which could be simpler to pursue.
The potential for treble damages under 18 U.S.C. § 1964 makes a RICO
claim particularly attractive if viable, as the plaintiff "shall recover threefold

the damages he sustains and the cost of the suit, including a reasonable
attorney's fee." This powerful remedy could provide significant
compensation for the husband's losses if all RICO elements can be
successfully established.

U.S. District Court — Southern District of Texas
Extract
Under RICO, while four distinct offenses are declared to be unlawful,
common elements are present in all four offenses... 'Racketeering activity' is
defined in § 1961(1) in terms of a list of state and federal crimes... Under §
1961(1)(B), racketeering activity includes any act which is indictable under
a number of federal criminal statutes, including mail fraud and wire fraud...
For mail fraud, it is necessary to show that (1) the defendants formed a
scheme or artifice to defraud; (2) the defendants used the United States
mails or caused a use of the United States mails in furtherance of the
scheme; and (3) the defendants did so with the specific intent to deceive or
defraud... A 'pattern of racketeering activity' requires at least two acts of
racketeering activity within a ten-year period... The predicate acts must
'amount to or threaten continuing racketeering activity.'
Summary
Detailed explanation of what constitutes a RICO claim, including the
requirement of predicate offenses such as mail and wire fraud, and the
necessity of demonstrating a pattern of racketeering activity. The described
scenario involves potential predicate offenses like fraud and possibly wire
fraud if interstate communications were used. The passage also emphasizes
the need for continuity or a threat of ongoing criminal activity, which could
be relevant if the fraudulent actions are part of a larger scheme.

Allstate Ins. Co. v. Donovan, CIVIL ACTION NO. H-12-0432 (S.D. Tex. Jul 03,
2012)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of Texas
Extract
RICO provides civil causes of action for recovery of treble damages for '[a]ny
person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section
1962 of this chapter.' 18 U.S.C. § 1964 (c). Plaintiffs have alleged that
defendants have violated §§ 1962(c) and (d). These subsections state: 18
U.S.C. §§ 1962(c) and (d). The Fifth Circuit has interpreted these subsections
to mean that 'a person who is employed by or associated with an enterprise
cannot conduct the affairs of the enterprise through a pattern of
racketeering activity[, and that] a person cannot conspire to violate
subsection[]. .. (c).' ... A pattern of racketeering activity consists of two or
more predicate criminal acts that are (1) related and (2) amount to or pose a
threat of continued criminal activity. ... Predicate acts can be either state or
federal crimes. ... Because RICO reaches only those unlawful activities that
amount to or threaten long-term criminal activity, a RICO complaint must
allege that 'the racketeering predicates are related, and that they amount to
or pose a threat of continued criminal activity.' ... Subsection (d) of 18 U.S.C.
§ 1962 makes it 'unlawful for any person to conspire to violate any of the
provisions of subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section.' 'To demonstrate a civil
RICO conspiracy, a claimant must show that: (1) two or more persons agreed
to commit a substantive RICO offense, and (2) the defendant knew of and
agreed to the overall objective of the RICO offense.'
Summary
To establish a RICO claim, there must be a pattern of racketeering activity,
which involves at least two related predicate criminal acts that pose a threat
of continued criminal activity. Additionally, for a RICO conspiracy claim, it
must be shown that two or more persons agreed to commit a substantive
RICO offense and that the defendant knew of and agreed to the overall
objective of the RICO offense. The passage also clarifies that predicate acts
can be state or federal crimes, and the enterprise involved must be separate
from the pattern of racketeering activity.

Extract
To state a civil RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962, a plaintiff must allege
three common elements: “(1) a person who engages in (2) a pattern of
racketeering activity, (3) connected to the acquisition, establishment,
conduct, or control of an enterprise.” N. Cypress Med. Ctr. Operating Co.,
Ltd. v. Cigna Healthcare, 781 F.3d 182, 201 (5th Cir. 2015) (quotation
omitted). [] An act of “racketeering activity,” commonly referred to as a
“predicate act,” is defined to include certain criminal acts, including mail
and wire fraud. ... To rise to the level of “racketeering activity” there must
be two or more predicate acts that are: (1) related; and (2) amount to or
pose a threat of continued criminal activity.
Summary
Framework for evaluating whether the actions described in the question
could constitute a RICO claim.
18 U.S.C. § 1962 18 U.S.C. § 1962 Prohibited Activities
Extract
It shall be unlawful for any person through a pattern of racketeering activity
or through collection of an unlawful debt to acquire or maintain, directly or
indirectly, any interest in or control of any enterprise which is engaged in, or
the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce. ... It shall be
unlawful for any person to conspire to violate any of the provisions of
subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section.
Summary
The statute makes it unlawful for any person to engage in a pattern of
racketeering activity or to conspire to do so, especially when such activities
affect interstate commerce. The actions described in the question, such as
filing false documents, transferring money across state lines, and conspiring
to defraud, could potentially be considered a pattern of racketeering activity
if they meet the criteria set forth in the statute. The involvement of
interstate commerce, as indicated by the transfer of money across state
lines, further supports the applicability of RICO.

transmitting false documents and transferring money across state lines,
which could potentially fall under this statute if wire communications were
used in the process. This statute is relevant to the question as it provides a
basis for federal charges related to wire fraud, which could be part of a
broader RICO claim if other elements of a RICO violation are present.

Summary
Such actions are punishable under federal law, which could support a RICO
claim if the activities are part of a pattern of racketeering activity.
18 U.S.C. § 1961 18 U.S.C. § 1961 Definitions
Extract
As used in this chapter- 'racketeering activity' means ... (B) any act which is
indictable under any of the following provisions of title 18, United States
Code: ... section 1341 (relating to mail fraud), section 1343 (relating to wire
fraud), section 1344 (relating to financial institution fraud), ... 'pattern of
racketeering activity' requires at least two acts of racketeering activity, one
of which occurred after the effective date of this chapter and the last of

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
which occurred within ten years (excluding any period of imprisonment)
after the commission of a prior act of racketeering activity; ...
Summary
The RICO Act defines "racketeering activity" to include acts indictable under
certain provisions of Title 18, such as mail fraud, wire fraud, and financial
institution fraud. The scenario described in the question involves filing false
documents and transferring money across state lines, which could
potentially fall under wire fraud or financial institution fraud if the actions
meet the legal definitions of those crimes. Additionally, the RICO Act
requires a "pattern of racketeering activity," which involves at least two acts
of racketeering activity within a specified time frame. If the actions
described in the question meet these criteria, it could potentially open up a
RICO claim.
18 U.S.C. § 1964 18 U.S.C. § 1964 Civil Remedies
Extract
Any person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of
section 1962 of this chapter may sue therefor in any appropriate United
States district court and shall recover threefold the damages he sustains and
the cost of the suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee...
Summary
The passage from 18 U.S.C. § 1964 outlines the civil remedies available for
violations of section 1962, which deals with RICO violations. It states that
any person injured in their business or property due to such a violation can
sue in a U.S. district court and recover triple the damages and the cost of
the suit. This is relevant to the question because the scenario described
involves potential RICO violations, such as conspiracy to defraud and
transferring money across state lines, which could be considered
racketeering activities under section 1962.
18 U.S.C. § 1963 18 U.S.C. § 1963 Criminal Penalties
Extract
Whoever violates any provision of section 1962 of this chapter shall be fined
under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years (or for life if the
violation is based on a racketeering activity for which the maximum penalty
includes life imprisonment), or both, and shall forfeit to the United States,
irrespective of any provision of State law- any interest the person has
acquired or maintained in violation of section 1962; any-(A) interest in; (B)
security of; (C) claim against; or (D) property or contractual right of any
kind affording a source of influence over; any enterprise which the person

has established, operated, controlled, conducted, or participated in the
conduct of, in violation of section 1962; and any property constituting, or
derived from, any proceeds which the person obtained, directly or indirectly,
from racketeering activity or unlawful debt collection in violation of section
1962.
Summary
Penalties for violating section 1962, which involves engaging in racketeering
activities. It specifies that violators can face fines, imprisonment, and
forfeiture of any interests or property obtained through racketeering. The
context of the question involves a scheme to defraud, which could
potentially fall under racketeering if it involves a pattern of illegal activity as
defined by RICO statutes. The passage is relevant as it provides the legal
framework for penalties and forfeiture related to racketeering activities,
which could apply if the actions described in the question meet the criteria
for a RICO violation.

Summary
Conspiracy is a separate offense from the substantive crime that results
from it. It also emphasizes that conspiracy involves an agreement to commit
an unlawful act, which is the core of the crime. Importantly, it notes that a
husband and wife can legally conspire with each other, which is relevant to
the scenario described in the question. This information is generally
applicable to federal conspiracy law and can be used to assess whether the
actions described could constitute a conspiracy under federal law.

capable of conspiring with their husbands).
Summary
Under U.S. federal law, a husband and wife are considered separate legal
entities and can conspire with each other. This is relevant to the question as
it involves a conspiracy between a wife and another individual to defraud
the husband. The passage supports the notion that such a conspiracy is
legally recognized and can be prosecuted under federal conspiracy laws.
Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy
The Brief - American Bar Association - 2024-01-01
Extract
A violation of § 1962(c), the section on which Sedima relies, requires (1)
conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity. The plaintiff must allege each of the elements to state a claim. They
are all equally essential components, and the complaint will fail if any one of
them is not adequately pleaded. In particular, RICO claims based on mail or
wire fraud must comport with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b)’s
requirement that allegations involving fraud be pleaded with particularity.
The practitioner through their pleadings must articulate with great care and
attention a viable racketeering claim. In addition, § 1962(a), (b), and (c) are
limited in scope to conduct involving enterprises engaged in or the activities
of which affect interstate commerce. It is the activities of the enterprise, not
each predicate act, that must affect interstate or foreign commerce. RICO
requires no more than a slight effect upon interstate commerce. Even a
minimal effect on interstate commerce satisfies this jurisdictional
requirement.
Summary
To establish a RICO claim under § 1962(c), the plaintiff must demonstrate
conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity, and the
activities of the enterprise must affect interstate commerce. The passage
also highlights the importance of pleading fraud with particularity under

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b). The passage is generally applicable to
RICO claims and provides a framework for evaluating whether the elements
of a RICO claim are met.

Notre Dame Law Review - University of Notre Dame Law School -
Crusey, Elisabeth F. - 2022-05-01
Extract
RICO is not just a tool for government control over organized crime. It is
also a remedial statute for civil matters. (31) It 'authorize[s]... criminal or
civil remedies on conduct already criminal, when performed in a specified
fashion' as delineated by the statute. (32) Section 1962 provides civil
remedies for four types of conduct: (1) using income derived from a pattern
of racketeering activity (33) to acquire an interest in an enterprise; (2)
acquiring or maintaining an interest in an enterprise through a pattern of
racketeering activity; (3) conducting the affairs of an enterprise through a
pattern of racketeering activity; and (4) conspiring to commit any of these
offenses. (34) Today, Congress urges courts to construe RICO liberally from
the 'perspective of the victim, not the perpetrator.' (35) A private civil right
of action in [section] 1964 provides that '[a]ny person injured in his business
or property by reason of a violation of section 1962... may sue.' (36) Notably,
a successful plaintiff under [section] 1964 is entitled to treble damages and
the cost of the suit, including attorney fees. (37)
Summary
Types of conduct that can give rise to a civil RICO claim, including
conspiring to commit offenses that involve a pattern of racketeering activity.
The scenario described in the question involves potential racketeering
activities such as fraud and conspiracy, which could fall under the purview
of RICO if they meet the statutory requirements.
RICO: A Primer
Extract
RICO provides for a civil action against persons engaged in a 'pattern of
racketeering activity' or 'collection of an unlawful debt.' A successful
plaintiff may recover treble damages, costs, and attorneys' fees... A 'pattern'
may exist where any combination of two or more offenses occurred within a
period of time... There are four separate and distinct RICO violations set out
in section 1962: (a) acquiring or operating an enterprise using racketeering
proceeds; (b) controlling an enterprise using racketeering activities; (c)
conducting the affairs of an enterprise using racketeering activities; and (d)
conspiring to so acquire, control, or conduct.

Summary
RICO provides for civil action against individuals engaged in a pattern of
racketeering activity. The passage outlines that a pattern may exist with two
or more offenses, and it describes the types of RICO violations under section
1962, including conspiring to conduct an enterprise through racketeering
activities. The described scenario involves multiple fraudulent acts and
interstate activities, which could potentially be considered a pattern of
racketeering activity under RICO.
RICO: A Primer
Extract
RICO provides for a civil action against persons engaged in a 'pattern of
racketeering activity' or 'collection of an unlawful debt.' A successful
plaintiff may recover treble damages, costs, and attorneys' fees. ... A
'pattern' may exist where any combination of two or more offenses occurred
within a period of time. ... A plaintiff may demonstrate a pattern by
establishment that the predicate acts pose a threat of continued criminal
activity, which is generally demonstrated by showing either: * Closed-ended
continuity. Proving 'a series of related predicate acts extending over a
substantial period of time.' * Open-ended continuity. A threat of 'continuing
criminal activity extending indefinitely into the future,' in light of the nature
of the enterprise and predicate acts alleged. ... There are four separate and
distinct RICO violations set out in section 1962: (a) acquiring or operating
an enterprise using racketeering proceeds; (b) controlling an enterprise
using racketeering activities; (c) conducting the affairs of an enterprise
using racketeering activities; and (d) conspiring to so acquire, control, or
conduct. ... Under Section 1962(d), it is a violation to conspire to commit any
of the three substantive RICO offenses.
Summary
RICO provides for civil action against individuals engaged in a pattern of
racketeering activity. The passage outlines that a pattern can be established
through either closed-ended or open-ended continuity of criminal acts. The
passage also details the four types of RICO violations, including conspiring
to commit RICO offenses. The described scenario involves multiple acts that
could be considered predicate acts under RICO, such as fraud and
conspiracy, and involves interstate activities, which could affect interstate
commerce. Therefore, the described actions could potentially form the basis
of a RICO claim if they meet the criteria of a pattern of racketeering activity.

Extract
RICO is not a simple statute. It pertains to conduct associated with an
'enterprise' and 'a pattern racketeering activity.' An enterprise is an
individual or legal entity, or a union or group of individuals associated in fact
although not a legal entity, while a pattern of racketeering activity requires
long-term, organized conduct to violate state and federal laws. ... Second, to
prove most types of RICO claims, the plaintiff must plead that the defendant
committed some qualifying criminal action, the most common of which is
mail, wire or securities fraud. ... Third, the plaintiff must plead a pattern of
racketeering activity for most RICO claims. If the alleged conduct occurred
once or twice, or was not continuous, it cannot form a pattern of conduct
sufficient to support a RICO claim. ... Fifth, a RICO claim cannot exist
without some nexus to interstate commerce. If the alleged conduct does not
affect interstate commerce, it must be dismissed.
Summary
Requirements for a RICO claim, including the need for an "enterprise" and a
"pattern of racketeering activity," which involves long-term, organized
conduct violating state and federal laws. It also highlights the necessity of
proving a qualifying criminal action, such as mail or wire fraud, and the
requirement for a pattern of racketeering activity, which must be continuous
and not isolated. Additionally, there must be a nexus to interstate commerce
for a RICO claim to exist.

Extract
RICO is not a simple statute. It pertains to conduct associated with an
'enterprise' and 'a pattern racketeering activity.' An enterprise is an
individual or legal entity, or a union or group of individuals associated in fact
although not a legal entity, while a pattern of racketeering activity requires
long-term, organized conduct to violate state and federal laws. There are
four types of activities outlawed by RICO, and claims under Section 1962(c)
are the most commonly asserted: * Section 1962(a) prohibits a person from
investing in an enterprise any income derived from a pattern of racketeering
activity; * Section 1962(b) prohibits a person from using a pattern of
racketeering activity to acquire or maintain control over an enterprise; *
Section 1962(c) prohibits a person from conducting the affairs of an
enterprise through a pattern of racketeering; and * Section 1962(d)
prohibits a person from conspiring to violate Sections 1962(a), (b), or (c).

potentially fall under the scope of RICO if they meet the criteria of an
"enterprise" and a "pattern of racketeering activity."
