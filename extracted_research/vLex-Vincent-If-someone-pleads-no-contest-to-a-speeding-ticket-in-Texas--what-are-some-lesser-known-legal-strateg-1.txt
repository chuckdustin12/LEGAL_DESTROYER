Question
If someone pleads no contest to a speeding ticket in Texas, what are some
lesser-known legal strategies to potentially avoid the ticket or its
consequences, aside from defensive driving?
Answer (Texas)
Short response
In Texas, individuals who plead no contest to speeding tickets can employ
several lesser-known strategies beyond defensive driving, including seeking
deferred disposition, installment payment plans, community service options,
and filing strategic appeals to county courts.
Summary
When facing a speeding ticket in Texas, individuals who plead no contest
(nolo contendere) have multiple strategies beyond the well-known defensive
driving option to potentially avoid the ticket or mitigate its consequences.
Recent Texas legislation provides several pathways including deferred
disposition for up to 180 days without entering an adjudication of guilt,
alternative methods to address fines and court costs such as installment
payments or community service, and strategic appeals to county courts
where judges may suspend fines and defer guilt findings.
The Texas Code of Criminal Procedure offers specific mechanisms that can
be leveraged, including motions to suppress evidence from speed detection
devices, utilizing deferral procedures in higher courts after appealing, and
satisfying court requirements through alternatives like tutoring programs.
These lesser-known strategies can help avoid the negative consequences
typically associated with speeding tickets, such as points on driving records,
increased insurance rates, and permanent conviction records, provided the
defendant meets all court-imposed requirements during the specified
deferral period.
Background and Relevant Law
Legislative Framework
The Texas Code of Criminal Procedure provides several options for
individuals who plead no contest to speeding tickets to potentially avoid the
ticket or its consequences. These provisions offer alternatives to simply
paying the fine and accepting the consequences of the violation.

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Deferred Disposition
One primary strategy available under Texas law is deferred disposition.
According to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. § 45A.302, "On a plea of guilty or nolo
contendere by a defendant or on a finding of guilt in a misdemeanor case
punishable by fine only and payment of all court costs, a judge may defer
further proceedings for a period not to exceed 180 days without entering an
adjudication of guilt."
This provision is particularly valuable for those facing speeding tickets as it
allows for a deferral period during which no adjudication of guilt is entered.
During this period, the judge has the authority to impose a fine on the
defendant, but such fine cannot exceed the amount that could be imposed as
punishment for the offense. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. § 45A.302(b) states that
"In issuing the order of deferral, the judge may impose a fine on the
defendant in an amount not to exceed the amount of the fine that could be
imposed on the defendant as punishment for the offense."
Importantly, the fine can be collected at any time before the deferral period
ends, and if collected, it must be credited toward any fine imposed as
punishment. As Tex. Code Crim. Proc. § 45A.302(c) notes, "The fine
described by Subsection (b) may be collected at any time before the date on
which the period of deferral ends. A judge who orders the collection of the
fine must require that the amount of the fine be credited toward the
payment of the amount of any fine imposed by the judge as punishment for
the offense."
The judge also has discretion to waive the fine altogether for good cause
shown by the defendant, per Tex. Code Crim. Proc. § 45A.302(d): "The judge
may elect not to impose the fine for good cause shown by the defendant."
An additional benefit of deferred disposition is that it terminates any liability
under a bond given for the charge, as stated in Tex. Code Crim. Proc. § 45A.
302(e): "An order of deferral under this article terminates any liability under
a bond given for the charge."
Alternative Methods to Address Fines and Court Costs
Texas law provides several alternatives to paying fines and court costs in
full, which can be particularly helpful for individuals who may face financial
hardship. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. § 45A.303 outlines these alternatives:
"Notwithstanding any other law, as an alternative to requiring a defendant
charged with one or more offenses to pay all fines and court costs as
required by Article CODE OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE 45A.302, the judge
may:
allow the defendant to enter into an agreement to pay those fines and
costs in installments during the defendant's period of deferral;
require an eligible defendant to discharge all or part of those fines and
costs by performing community service or attending a tutoring program
under Article CODE OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE 45A.254 or CODE OF
CRIMINAL PROCEDURE 45A.460;
1. 
2. 

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
waive all or part of those fines and costs under Article CODE OF
CRIMINAL PROCEDURE 45A.257;
or take any combination of actions authorized by Subdivision, , or ."
These alternatives provide flexibility in addressing the financial obligations
associated with a speeding ticket, which could make it more feasible for
individuals to comply with court requirements and potentially avoid the
long-term consequences of the ticket.
Driving Safety Courses
Another strategy involves completing a driving safety course after pleading
no contest. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. § 45A.356 specifies that "The court shall
enter judgment on a defendant's plea of nolo contendere or guilty at the
time the plea is made, defer imposition of the judgment, and allow the
defendant a 90-day period to successfully complete the approved driving
safety course or motorcycle operator training course and present to the
court: a uniform certificate of completion of the driving safety course or a
verification of completion of the motorcycle operator training course."
This provision allows for the deferral of judgment pending completion of an
approved driving safety course. The defendant must also provide additional
documentation, including their driving record showing they have not
completed such a course within the preceding 12 months and an affidavit
stating they were not already taking such a course when they requested to
take one for the current offense.
Appeals to County Court
For those who have already been convicted in a lower court, Texas law
provides an additional option through appeals. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. §
42.111 states: "If a defendant convicted of a misdemeanor punishable by
fine only appeals the conviction to a county court, on the trial in county
court the defendant may enter a plea of guilty or nolo contendere to the
offense. If the defendant enters a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, the court
may defer further proceedings without entering an adjudication of guilt in
the same manner as provided for the deferral of proceedings in justice court
or municipal court under Subchapter G, Chapter 45A."
This provision allows defendants to appeal their case to county court and
potentially benefit from deferred adjudication, even after conviction in a
lower court. However, it's important to note that this section does not apply
to certain traffic violations, specifically "a misdemeanor case disposed of
under Subchapter B, Chapter 543, Transportation Code, or a serious traffic
violation as defined by Section Transportation Code 522.003."
Case Law
Case law provides additional insights into how these legislative provisions
are applied in practice and reveals strategies that have proven successful in
Texas courts.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
In State v. Cuarenta, 703 S.W.3d 429 (Tex. App. 2024), the court noted that
"Appellee entered a plea of no contest in Justice Court, Precinct 1, of Brazos
County and was found guilty. He filed a de novo appeal in County Court at
Law Number 2. Following a hearing, the trial court found him guilty but
suspended imposition of a fine and deferred the finding of guilt for 180
days."
This case illustrates how a defendant can leverage the appeal process to
potentially secure a more favorable outcome. By appealing to a county court,
the defendant was able to obtain a suspended fine and a deferred finding of
guilt, despite initially being found guilty in justice court.
Similar outcomes are referenced in State v. Cuarenta, 07-23-00339-CR (Tex.
App. Feb 14, 2024), which states the same facts and outcome. It's worth
noting that this case was superseded by State v. Cuarenta, PD-0205-24 (Tex.
Crim. App. Jan 22, 2025). While the subsequent treatment might affect the
precedential value of this case, it nonetheless illustrates the potential
strategy of appealing to county court after pleading no contest in a lower
court.
State v. Hollis, 327 S.W.3d 750 (Tex. App. 2010) further elaborates on the
appeal process, noting: "If a defendant convicted of a misdemeanor
punishable by fine only appeals the conviction to a county court, on the trial
in county court the defendant may enter a plea of guilty or nolo contendere
to the offense. If the defendant enters a plea of guilty or nolo contendere,
the court may defer further proceedings without entering an adjudication of
guilt in the same manner as provided for the deferral of proceedings in
justice court or municipal court under Article 45.051 [45.54] of this code."
This case reinforces the availability of deferred adjudication in county court
following an appeal, although it also notes the limitations: "This article does
not apply to a misdemeanor case disposed of under Subchapter B, Chapter
543, Transportation Code [by Section 143A, Uniform Act Regulating Traffic
on Highways (Article 6701d, Vernon's Texas Civil Statutes)], or a serious
traffic violation as defined by Section 522.003, Transportation Code."
It's important to note that State v. Hollis was limited by In re State, 489 S.W.
3d 24 (Tex. App. 2016). This subsequent treatment suggests that the
principles established in Hollis may have limitations or may not apply in all
circumstances, which should be considered when relying on this strategy.
Secondary Materials
Secondary sources provide additional strategies for addressing speeding
tickets. According to Misdemeanor Defense (2022-05-05), one strategy
involves "filing a Motion to Suppress and requesting a hearing on the Motion
in a case where a detection device was used for speeding. A trial court was
reversed for denying the defendant's motion to suppress on the basis that
there was no evidence that the device using Light Detection and Ranging
(LIDAR) technology supplied probable cause for the stop."

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
This suggests that challenging the reliability or proper operation of the
speed detection device used to issue the ticket can be a viable strategy in
some cases. If successful, such a motion could result in the evidence being
suppressed, potentially leading to the dismissal of the ticket.
Analysis of Available Strategies
Strategy 1: Seeking Deferred Disposition
One of the most effective strategies for someone who has pled no contest to
a speeding ticket in Texas is to seek deferred disposition under Tex. Code
Crim. Proc. § 45A.302. This approach allows the defendant to avoid an
adjudication of guilt for up to 180 days, provided they comply with certain
conditions imposed by the court.
The process begins when the defendant pleads no contest and the judge
agrees to defer further proceedings without entering an adjudication of
guilt. During the deferral period, the judge may impose conditions such as
payment of a fine, which must not exceed the amount that could be imposed
as punishment for the offense.
The advantage of this strategy is that if the defendant successfully
completes the deferral period without violating any conditions, they can
avoid having a conviction on their record. This can prevent points from
being added to their driving record and avoid increases in insurance
premiums that typically follow traffic convictions.
To maximize the likelihood of success with this strategy, the defendant
should:
Request deferred disposition at the time of their plea
Be prepared to pay court costs upfront
Demonstrate willingness to comply with any conditions imposed by the
court
Maintain a clean driving record during the deferral period
Strategy 2: Alternative Methods to Address Fines and Court
Costs
For defendants facing financial hardship, Tex. Code Crim. Proc. § 45A.303
provides several alternatives to paying fines and court costs in full. These
alternatives can make it more feasible for individuals to comply with court
requirements and potentially avoid the long-term consequences of a
speeding ticket.
The alternatives include:
Installment payment plans during the deferral period
Community service to discharge all or part of the fines and costs
Attending a tutoring program
Waiver of all or part of the fines and costs for good cause

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
A combination of the above options
By taking advantage of these alternatives, defendants can fulfill their
obligations to the court without experiencing undue financial hardship. This
increases their likelihood of successfully completing the deferral period and
avoiding a conviction.
Strategy 3: Completion of Driving Safety Course with
Special Conditions
While the question specifically asks for strategies other than defensive
driving, it's worth noting that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. § 45A.356 provides a
structured process for deferring judgment pending completion of an
approved driving safety course. This approach differs from the standard
defensive driving option in that it involves specific procedural requirements
and documentation that must be submitted to the court.
Under this provision, after pleading no contest, the court defers imposition
of the judgment and allows the defendant a 90-day period to complete an
approved driving safety course. To successfully employ this strategy, the
defendant must:
Complete the approved course within 90 days
Present a uniform certificate of completion to the court
Provide their driving record showing they haven't completed such a
course within the preceding 12 months
Submit an affidavit stating they weren't already taking such a course
when they requested to take one for the current offense
If all requirements are met, the court can dismiss the charge, allowing the
defendant to avoid the consequences of the ticket.
Strategy 4: Strategic Appeals to County Court
For defendants who have already been convicted in a lower court, Tex. Code
Crim. Proc. § 42.111 offers the option to appeal to county court. This
strategy can be particularly effective, as demonstrated in State v. Cuarenta,
703 S.W.3d 429 (Tex. App. 2024), where the defendant was able to secure a
suspended fine and a deferred finding of guilt despite initially being found
guilty in justice court.
The appeal process provides a fresh opportunity for the defendant to plead
no contest and request deferred adjudication. As stated in State v. Hollis,
327 S.W.3d 750 (Tex. App. 2010), if a defendant convicted of a misdemeanor
punishable by fine only appeals to county court and enters a plea of guilty or
no contest, the court may defer further proceedings without entering an
adjudication of guilt.
However, it's important to note that State v. Hollis was limited by In re
State, 489 S.W.3d 24 (Tex. App. 2016), suggesting that this strategy may
have certain limitations or may not apply in all circumstances. Additionally,
5. 
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
this approach does not apply to certain traffic violations, as specified in the
statute.
Strategy 5: Challenging the Evidence Through Motion to
Suppress
According to Misdemeanor Defense (2022-05-05), filing a Motion to
Suppress can be an effective strategy when a detection device was used to
measure the defendant's speed. This approach challenges the reliability or
proper operation of the device, potentially leading to the suppression of
evidence and dismissal of the ticket.
To employ this strategy successfully, the defendant should:
File a Motion to Suppress specifically challenging the evidence
obtained from the speed detection device
Request a hearing on the motion
Be prepared to argue that there is insufficient evidence that the device
provided probable cause for the stop
Question whether the device was properly calibrated, maintained, and
operated according to manufacturer specifications
This strategy can be particularly effective when the speeding ticket was
issued based solely on readings from devices like LIDAR or radar, with no
other evidence of speeding.
Exceptions and Caveats
While the strategies outlined above can be effective for many defendants,
there are important exceptions and limitations to consider:
Exclusions for Certain Traffic Violations: As noted in Tex. Code
Crim. Proc. § 42.111, the option to defer adjudication in county court
following an appeal does not apply to "a misdemeanor case disposed of
under Subchapter B, Chapter 543, Transportation Code, or a serious
traffic violation as defined by Section 522.003, Transportation Code."
This means that certain traffic violations may not be eligible for this
strategy.
Limitations Based on Prior Driving Record: The effectiveness of
these strategies may be limited by the defendant's prior driving record.
For instance, to qualify for deferral through completion of a driving
safety course, the defendant must not have completed such a course
within the 12 months preceding the offense. Defendants with multiple
recent violations may therefore have fewer options available to them.
Judicial Discretion: Many of these strategies rely on judicial
discretion. The judge has the authority to decide whether to grant
deferred disposition, allow alternative methods of addressing fines and
court costs, or defer adjudication following an appeal. There is no
guarantee that any of these requests will be granted, particularly for
1.

2. 
3. 

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
defendants with poor driving records or those who have previously
benefited from such arrangements.
Subsequent Treatment of Case Law: As noted earlier, State v. Hollis,
327 S.W.3d 750 (Tex. App. 2010) was limited by In re State, 489 S.W.3d
24 (Tex. App. 2016), and State v. Cuarenta, 07-23-00339-CR (Tex. App.
Feb 14, 2024) was superseded by State v. Cuarenta, PD-0205-24 (Tex.
Crim. App. Jan 22, 2025). These subsequent treatments suggest that
the principles established in these cases may have limitations or may
not apply in all circumstances.
Compliance with Conditions: The success of strategies involving
deferred disposition or deferred adjudication depends on the
defendant's ability to comply with all conditions imposed by the court
during the deferral period. Failure to meet these conditions can result
in an adjudication of guilt and the imposition of the original penalties.
Conclusion
For individuals who plead no contest to a speeding ticket in Texas, several
lesser-known legal strategies exist that may help avoid the ticket or its
consequences. These strategies include:
Seeking deferred disposition under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. § 45A.302,
which allows for a deferral period of up to 180 days without an
adjudication of guilt.
Utilizing alternative methods to address fines and court costs as
provided in Tex. Code Crim. Proc. § 45A.303, such as installment
payment plans, community service, tutoring programs, or waivers.
Completing a driving safety course with special conditions as
outlined in Tex. Code Crim. Proc. § 45A.356, which involves specific
procedural requirements beyond the standard defensive driving option.
Strategically appealing to county court as provided in Tex. Code
Crim. Proc. § 42.111 and demonstrated in State v. Cuarenta, 703 S.W.3d
429 (Tex. App. 2024), which can provide a fresh opportunity for
deferred adjudication.
Challenging the evidence through a Motion to Suppress,
particularly when a detection device was used to measure speed, as
suggested in Misdemeanor Defense (2022-05-05).
Each of these strategies has its own requirements, advantages, and potential
limitations. The most appropriate strategy for any individual will depend on
their specific circumstances, including their driving record, financial
situation, and the details of their speeding ticket. By understanding and
effectively utilizing these lesser-known legal strategies, individuals who
plead no contest to speeding tickets in Texas can potentially avoid or
minimize the negative consequences typically associated with such

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
violations, such as points on their driving record, increased insurance rates,
and a permanent conviction record.
It's worth noting that while these strategies can be effective, their success
ultimately depends on factors such as judicial discretion, the defendant's
ability to comply with court-imposed conditions, and the specific nature of
the traffic violation. Therefore, individuals considering these strategies
should carefully evaluate their options and, when possible, seek appropriate
legal advice tailored to their specific situation.

State v. Hollis, 327 S.W.3d 750 (Tex. App. 2010)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
If a defendant convicted of a misdemeanor punishable by fine only appeals
the conviction to a county court, on the trial in county court the defendant
may enter a plea of guilty or nolo contendere to the offense. If the defendant
enters a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, the court may defer further
proceedings without entering an adjudication of guilt in the same manner as
provided for the deferral of proceedings in justice court or municipal court
under Article 45.051 [45.54] of this code. This article does not apply to a
misdemeanor case disposed of under Subchapter B, Chapter 543,
Transportation Code [by Section 143A, Uniform Act Regulating Traffic on
Highways (Article 6701d, Vernon's Texas Civil Statutes)], or a serious traffic
violation as defined by Section 522.003, Transportation Code.
Summary
In Texas, if a defendant pleads guilty or no contest to a misdemeanor
punishable by fine only, they may have the option to defer further
proceedings without an adjudication of guilt. This is applicable in county
court trials and mirrors the deferral process available in justice or municipal
courts under Article 45.051. However, this option is not available for certain
traffic offenses, such as those disposed of under Subchapter B, Chapter 543,
or serious traffic violations.

Summary
If a defendant appeals a misdemeanor conviction punishable by fine only to
a county court, they may enter a plea of guilty or no contest. The court then
has the discretion to defer further proceedings without entering an
adjudication of guilt, similar to procedures in justice or municipal courts.
This deferral could potentially avoid the ticket's consequences, such as
points on a driving record or increased insurance rates.

Disposition
Extract
(a) On a plea of guilty or nolo contendere by a defendant or on a finding of
guilt in a misdemeanor case punishable by fine only and payment of all court
costs, a judge may defer further proceedings for a period not to exceed 180
days without entering an adjudication of guilt. (b) In issuing the order of
deferral, the judge may impose a fine on the defendant in an amount not to
exceed the amount of the fine that could be imposed on the defendant as
punishment for the offense. (c) The fine described by Subsection (b) may be
collected at any time before the date on which the period of deferral ends. A
judge who orders the collection of the fine must require that the amount of
the fine be credited toward the payment of the amount of any fine imposed
by the judge as punishment for the offense. (d) The judge may elect not to
impose the fine for good cause shown by the defendant. (e) An order of
deferral under this article terminates any liability under a bond given for the
charge.
Summary
In Texas, a defendant who pleads no contest (nolo contendere) to a
misdemeanor offense punishable by fine only, such as a speeding ticket, may
have the proceedings deferred by a judge for up to 180 days. During this
deferral period, no adjudication of guilt is entered. The judge may impose a
fine, which can be collected before the deferral period ends, and this fine
may be credited toward any punishment fine. The judge also has the
discretion not to impose the fine if the defendant shows good cause. This
deferral can terminate any liability under a bond given for the charge.

Public Safety, if any, showing that the defendant has not completed an
approved driving safety course or motorcycle operator training course, as
applicable, within the 12-month period preceding the date of the offense; an
affidavit stating that the defendant: (A) was not taking a driving safety
course or motorcycle operator training course, as applicable, under this
subchapter on the date the request to take the course was made; and (B) has
not completed, within the 12-month period preceding the date of the
offense, a course described by Paragraph (A) that is not shown on the
defendant's driving record; and if the defendant does not have a Texas
driver's license or permit and is a member, or the spouse or dependent child
of a member, of the United States military forces serving on active duty, an
affidavit stating that the defendant: (A) was not taking a driving safety
course or motorcycle operator training course, as applicable, in another
state on the date the request to take the course was made; and (B) has not
completed a course described by Paragraph (A) within the 12-month period
preceding the date of the offense.
Summary
When a defendant pleads no contest to a speeding ticket in Texas, the court
can defer the imposition of judgment and allow the defendant a 90-day
period to complete an approved driving safety course. If the defendant
successfully completes the course and meets other requirements, such as
providing an affidavit and a driving record, the court can dismiss the charge.
This provides a potential strategy to avoid the consequences of the ticket.

Extract
Consider filing a Motion to Suppress and requesting a hearing on the Motion
in a case where a detection device was used for speeding. A trial court was
reversed for denying the defendant’s motion to suppress on the basis that
there was no evidence that the device using Light Detection and Ranging
(LIDAR) technology supplied probable cause for the stop.
Summary
The passage suggests a legal strategy of challenging the validity of the
detection device used to issue the speeding ticket. By filing a Motion to
Suppress, a defendant can argue that the evidence obtained from the device
was not reliable or did not provide probable cause for the stop. This strategy
is applicable in cases where the speeding ticket was issued based on
readings from devices like LIDAR.
