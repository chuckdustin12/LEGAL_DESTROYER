Question
The mother and stepfather engaged in multiple acts, including wire fraud
(via PayPal transactions and phone communications), mail fraud (if any
documents were sent via mail), and potentially obstruction of justice
(through false statements in legal proceedings). A "pattern of racketeering
activity" under RICO requires at least two predicate acts of racketeering
activity within a 10-year period, as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1), such as
wire fraud, mail fraud, or obstruction of justice. If the described actions
meet the statutory definitions of wire fraud, mail fraud, or obstruction of
justice, and if they are related and continuous, they could satisfy the
"pattern of racketeering activity" requirement under RICO.
Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
The mother and stepfather's alleged acts of wire fraud (via PayPal
transactions and phone communications), mail fraud (via mailed
documents), and obstruction of justice (through false statements in legal
proceedings) could satisfy the "pattern of racketeering activity" requirement
under RICO if these acts meet the statutory definitions and show relatedness
and continuity. These predicate acts fall within the specifically enumerated
offenses in 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1) and, if at least two such acts occurred within
a 10-year period as part of a related and continuous criminal activity, they
would establish the pattern necessary for RICO liability.
Summary
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) was
designed to combat organized criminal enterprises by providing both
criminal penalties and civil remedies for patterns of racketeering activity. To
establish a RICO violation, it must be demonstrated that a person engaged
in a "pattern of racketeering activity," which requires at least two acts of
racketeering activity within a 10-year period. The actions attributed to the
mother and stepfather—wire fraud through PayPal transactions and phone
communications, mail fraud through documents sent via mail, and
obstruction of justice through false statements in legal proceedings—are all
specifically listed as "racketeering activity" under 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1).
For these actions to constitute a "pattern of racketeering activity" under
RICO, they must not only meet the statutory definitions of the respective
predicate acts but must also be related and continuous. The relatedness
requirement is satisfied when the acts have "the same or similar purposes,
results, participants, victims, or methods of commission, or otherwise are
interrelated by distinguishing characteristics." Continuity can be established
by showing either a "closed period of repeated conduct" or "past conduct
that by its nature projects into the future with a threat of repetition." If the

actions described meet these criteria, they would satisfy the "pattern of
racketeering activity" requirement under RICO, potentially subjecting the
mother and stepfather to RICO liability.
Background and Relevant Law
Legislation
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), codified at
18 U.S.C. §§ 1961-1968, establishes both criminal penalties and civil causes
of action for acts performed as part of an ongoing criminal organization. The
statute was enacted to combat organized crime, but its application has
expanded considerably beyond that original purpose.
At the heart of RICO is the concept of a "pattern of racketeering activity."
The statute defines this term in 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5) as requiring "at least
two acts of racketeering activity, one of which occurred after the effective
date of this chapter and the last of which occurred within ten years
(excluding any period of imprisonment) after the commission of a prior act
of racketeering activity." 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5) (2025).
"Racketeering activity" is defined in 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1) to include numerous
federal and state offenses. Particularly relevant to this analysis are the
following predicate acts:
Mail Fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1341): 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1)(B) (2025) includes as
racketeering activity "any act which is indictable under... section 1341
(relating to mail fraud)."
Wire Fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343): 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1)(B) (2025) includes
as racketeering activity "any act which is indictable under... section
1343 (relating to wire fraud)."
Obstruction of Justice (18 U.S.C. §§ 1503, 1512): 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1)(B)
(2025) includes as racketeering activity "any act which is indictable
under... section 1503 (relating to obstruction of justice)," and other
obstruction-related statutes.
The substantive prohibition in RICO is found in 18 U.S.C. § 1962, which
makes it unlawful, among other things, for "any person employed by or
associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect,
interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or
indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of
racketeering activity." 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) (2025).
To understand whether the mother and stepfather's actions satisfy the
"pattern of racketeering activity" requirement under RICO, we need to
examine the elements of the alleged predicate acts and the requirements for
establishing a pattern.

Mail Fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1341)
The mail fraud statute prohibits using the mail in furtherance of a scheme to
defraud:
18 U.S.C. § 1341 (2025) provides: "Whoever, having devised or intending to
devise any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or property
by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises... for
the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice or attempting so to do,
places in any post office or authorized depository for mail matter, any matter
or thing whatever to be sent or delivered by the Postal Service, or deposits
or causes to be deposited any matter or thing whatever to be sent or
delivered by any private or commercial interstate carrier... shall be fined
under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both."
Wire Fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343)
Similarly, the wire fraud statute prohibits using wire communications in
furtherance of a scheme to defraud:
18 U.S.C. § 1343 (2025) states: "Whoever, having devised or intending to
devise any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or property
by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises,
transmits or causes to be transmitted by means of wire, radio, or television
communication in interstate or foreign commerce, any writings, signs,
signals, pictures, or sounds for the purpose of executing such scheme or
artifice, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years,
or both."
Obstruction of Justice (18 U.S.C. § 1512)
The obstruction of justice statute includes various provisions related to
tampering with witnesses, victims, or informants:
18 U.S.C. § 1512 (2025) provides: "Whoever knowingly uses intimidation,
threatens, or corruptly persuades another person, or attempts to do so, or
engages in misleading conduct toward another person, with intent to...
hinder, delay, or prevent the communication to a law enforcement officer or
judge of the United States of information relating to the commission or
possible commission of a Federal offense... shall be fined under this title or
imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both."
Case Law
The Supreme Court and lower courts have interpreted the "pattern of
racketeering activity" requirement in several significant cases.
In H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106
L.Ed.2d 195 (1989), the Supreme Court explained that RICO "imposes
criminal and civil liability upon persons who engage in certain 'prohibited
activities,' each of which is defined to include, as a necessary element, proof

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
of a 'pattern of racketeering activity,' § 1962. 'Racketeering activity' means
'any act or threat involving' specified state-law crimes, any 'act' indictable
under specified federal statutes, and certain federal 'offenses.' § 1961(1). A
'pattern' requires 'at least two acts of racketeering activity' within a 10-year
period. § 1961(5)."
The Court in H.J. Inc. further clarified that establishing a pattern requires
showing both that the predicate acts are related and that they amount to or
pose a threat of continued criminal activity. The Court stated that predicate
acts are related when they "embrace[] criminal acts that have the same or
similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of commission, or
otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not
isolated events." H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 240,
109 S.Ct. 2893, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989).
In United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 101 S.Ct. 2524, 69 L.Ed.2d 246
(1981), the Supreme Court explained: "In order to secure a conviction under
RICO, the Government must prove both the existence of an 'enterprise' and
the connected 'pattern of racketeering activity.'... The pattern of
racketeering activity is, on the other hand, a series of criminal acts as
defined by the statute. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1)... The latter is proved by evidence
of the requisite number of acts of racketeering committed by the
participants in the enterprise." It's important to note that Turkette was
abrogated by Lane v. United States, 474 U.S. 438, 106 S.Ct. 725, 88 L.Ed.2d
814 (1986), but the abrogation related to misjoinder issues rather than the
fundamental explanation of RICO's requirements, so this aspect of Turkette
remains valid precedent.
Lower courts have further elaborated on the requirements for establishing a
pattern of racketeering activity. In Julsonnet v. TopHills Inc., Civil Action
22-10767-RGS (D. Mass. Feb 13, 2024), the court noted: "Proof of a
predicate act alone is insufficient to generate civil RICO liability; the
Julsonnets must also prove a pattern of racketeering activity by showing
both continuity and relatedness of the predicate acts. See Giuliano v. Fulton,
399 F.3d 381, 386-387 (1st Cir. 2005). They may show continuity by proving
either a 'closed period of repeated conduct' that 'amounted to... continued
criminal activity' or 'past conduct that by its nature projects into the future
with a threat of repetition.' H.J. Inc. v. Nw. Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 237,
241 (1989). Predicate acts are related when they 'embrace[] criminal acts
that have the same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or
methods of commission, or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing
characteristics and are not isolated events.'"
In Tashjian v. Deutsche Bank, CIVIL ACTION NO. 19-cv-40074-DHH (D.
Mass. Feb 23, 2021), the court emphasized: "To plead a 'pattern' of
'racketeering activity,' a plaintiff must set forth well-pled allegations of
conduct violating specified federal or state statutes. Racketeering acts
include... violations of certain federal statutes, such as the mail and wire
fraud statutes. See 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1). A ''pattern of racketeering activity'
requires at least two acts of racketeering activity' within ten years of each
other. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5). However, even where parties committed two acts
of racketeering in a ten-year period, the racketeering acts do not qualify as a

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
'pattern' unless they meet a 'continuity' requirement. See Home Orthopedics
Corp. v. Rodriguez, 781 F.3d 521, 528 (1st Cir. 2015). To satisfy this
mandate, a plaintiff must plead facts showing that racketeering acts are
'related, and that they amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal
activity.'"
Regarding the specific predicate acts of mail and wire fraud, the court in 
U.S. v. International Longshoremen's Ass'n, 518 F.Supp.2d 422 (E.D. N.Y.
2007) explained: "The essential elements of a mail [or wire] fraud violation
are (1) a scheme to defraud, (2) money or property [as the object of the
scheme], and (3) use of the mails [or wires] to further the scheme... In RICO
cases, 'allegations of predicate mail and wire fraud acts should state the
contents of the communications, who was involved, where and when they
took place, and explain why they were fraudulent.'"
The specificity needed for mail and wire fraud claims in RICO cases is
important. As suggested in Chapter 4. Elements of Cause of Action, "Mail
and wire fraud are the two most frequently alleged predicate acts... Under
mail and wire fraud statutes, every mail or wire communication allegedly in
furtherance of the fraudulent scheme is a separate violation, even individual
communications that are not themselves fraudulent."
Analysis
Establishing the Predicate Acts
To determine whether the mother and stepfather's actions satisfy the
"pattern of racketeering activity" requirement under RICO, we must first
assess whether their actions meet the definitions of the alleged predicate
acts.
Wire Fraud (PayPal Transactions and Phone Communications)
For wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343, three elements must be established:
(1) a scheme to defraud or to obtain money or property by means of false
pretenses, representations, or promises, (2) intent to defraud, and (3) use of
interstate wire communications in furtherance of the scheme. 18 U.S.C. §
1343 (2025).
The PayPal transactions and phone communications referenced in the
question would likely satisfy the "wire communication" element of wire fraud
if they involved interstate transmissions, which PayPal transactions typically
do. As explained in U.S. v. International Longshoremen's Ass'n, 518 F.Supp.
2d 422 (E.D. N.Y. 2007), the key elements are "a scheme to defraud, (2)
money or property [as the object of the scheme], and (3) use of the mails [or
wires] to further the scheme."
If the mother and stepfather used PayPal transactions or phone
communications as part of a scheme to defraud and with the intent to
defraud, these actions could constitute wire fraud. Each PayPal transaction
or phone call made in furtherance of the scheme would be a separate act of

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
wire fraud. As noted in Chapter 4. Elements of Cause of Action, "every mail
or wire communication allegedly in furtherance of the fraudulent scheme is
a separate violation, even individual communications that are not
themselves fraudulent."
Mail Fraud (Documents Sent via Mail)
For mail fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1341, the elements are similar to those of
wire fraud, but involve the use of mail rather than wire communications: (1)
a scheme to defraud or to obtain money or property by means of false
pretenses, representations, or promises, (2) intent to defraud, and (3) use of
the mail in furtherance of the scheme. 18 U.S.C. § 1341 (2025).
If the mother and stepfather sent documents via mail as part of a fraudulent
scheme, each mailing would constitute a separate act of mail fraud. The
mailings need not themselves contain false statements; they need only be in
furtherance of the fraudulent scheme.
Obstruction of Justice (False Statements in Legal Proceedings)
For obstruction of justice under 18 U.S.C. § 1512, the elements include: (1)
knowingly engaging in misleading conduct toward another person, (2) with
intent to influence, delay, or prevent testimony in an official proceeding, or
to cause or induce any person to withhold testimony or documents from an
official proceeding. 18 U.S.C. § 1512 (2025).
If the mother and stepfather made false statements in legal proceedings
with the intent to obstruct justice or influence the proceedings, these
actions could constitute obstruction of justice. Each instance of making false
statements with the requisite intent would be a separate act of obstruction.
Establishing a Pattern of Racketeering Activity
Having established that the mother and stepfather's actions could constitute
predicate acts under RICO, we must next determine whether these acts form
a "pattern of racketeering activity."
Numerical Requirement
As a threshold matter, RICO requires "at least two acts of racketeering
activity" within a 10-year period. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5) (2025). If the mother
and stepfather committed multiple acts of wire fraud, mail fraud, or
obstruction of justice within a 10-year period, this numerical requirement
would be satisfied.
Relatedness Requirement
The Supreme Court in H.J. Inc. established that predicate acts are related
when they "embrace[] criminal acts that have the same or similar purposes,
results, participants, victims, or methods of commission, or otherwise are
interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not isolated events." 

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 240, 109 S.Ct. 2893,
106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989).
If the mother and stepfather's acts of wire fraud, mail fraud, and obstruction
of justice were part of a common scheme or had similar purposes, victims, or
methods, they would likely satisfy the relatedness requirement. For
instance, if the PayPal transactions, phone communications, mailed
documents, and false statements in legal proceedings were all aimed at
defrauding the same victim or achieving the same criminal objective, they
would be related.
As explained in U.S. v. Welch, 656 F.2d 1039 (5th Cir. 1981), "the two or
more predicate crimes must be related to the affairs of the enterprise but
need not otherwise be related to each other." This suggests that even if the
individual acts of wire fraud, mail fraud, and obstruction of justice were not
directly related to each other, they could still form a pattern if they were
related to a common enterprise or scheme.
Continuity Requirement
The continuity requirement can be satisfied by showing either "a closed
period of repeated conduct" or "past conduct that by its nature projects into
the future with a threat of repetition." H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co.,
492 U.S. 229, 241, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989).
If the mother and stepfather engaged in multiple acts of wire fraud, mail
fraud, or obstruction of justice over a substantial period, this would likely
satisfy the "closed period of repeated conduct" form of continuity.
Alternatively, if their conduct suggested a threat of future criminal activity,
this would satisfy the "threat of repetition" form of continuity.
As noted in Julsonnet v. TopHills Inc., Civil Action 22-10767-RGS (D. Mass.
Feb 13, 2024), plaintiffs "may show continuity by proving either a 'closed
period of repeated conduct' that 'amounted to... continued criminal activity'
or 'past conduct that by its nature projects into the future with a threat of
repetition.'"
Application to the Mother and Stepfather's Actions
Based on the given information, the mother and stepfather engaged in
multiple acts that could constitute wire fraud (PayPal transactions and
phone communications), mail fraud (documents sent via mail), and
obstruction of justice (false statements in legal proceedings).
If at least two of these acts occurred within a 10-year period, they would
satisfy the numerical requirement for a pattern of racketeering activity. If
these acts were related by having common purposes, victims, or methods,
they would satisfy the relatedness requirement. And if these acts occurred
over a substantial period or suggested a threat of future criminal activity,
they would satisfy the continuity requirement.

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Given that multiple types of potential predicate acts are alleged (wire fraud,
mail fraud, and obstruction of justice), it appears likely that the numerical
requirement would be met. The relatedness and continuity requirements
would depend on the specific facts of the case, such as the timing and
nature of the acts, their relationship to each other, and whether they were
part of a common scheme.
Exceptions and Caveats
While the mother and stepfather's actions could potentially satisfy the
"pattern of racketeering activity" requirement under RICO, there are several
important caveats to consider.
First, merely establishing predicate acts is insufficient for RICO liability. As
stated in Tashjian v. Deutsche Bank, CIVIL ACTION NO. 19-cv-40074-DHH
(D. Mass. Feb 23, 2021), "even where parties committed two acts of
racketeering in a ten-year period, the racketeering acts do not qualify as a
'pattern' unless they meet a 'continuity' requirement."
Second, in addition to proving a pattern of racketeering activity, RICO
requires the existence of an "enterprise." As explained in United States v.
Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 583, 101 S.Ct. 2524, 69 L.Ed.2d 246 (1981), "the
Government must prove both the existence of an 'enterprise' and the
connected 'pattern of racketeering activity.'" The enterprise is "an entity, for
present purposes a group of persons associated together for a common
purpose of engaging in a course of conduct." It is "proved by evidence of an
ongoing organization, formal or informal, and by evidence that the various
associates function as a continuing unit." While Turkette was abrogated on
other grounds by Lane v. United States, its explanation of RICO's enterprise
requirement remains valid.
Third, for wire fraud and mail fraud, the fraudulent scheme must be aimed
at obtaining money or property. As stated in U.S. v. International
Longshoremen's Ass'n, 518 F.Supp.2d 422 (E.D. N.Y. 2007), the essential
elements include "money or property [as the object of the scheme]." If the
mother and stepfather's scheme did not involve money or property, the wire
fraud and mail fraud predicates might not apply.
Fourth, allegations of mail and wire fraud in RICO cases require specificity.
As noted in U.S. v. International Longshoremen's Ass'n, 518 F.Supp.2d 422
(E.D. N.Y. 2007), "allegations of predicate mail and wire fraud acts should
state the contents of the communications, who was involved, where and
when they took place, and explain why they were fraudulent." Without such
specificity, the claims might fail.
Finally, establishing RICO liability requires showing that the defendants
conducted or participated in the conduct of an enterprise's affairs through
the pattern of racketeering activity. As stated in 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) (2025),
it is unlawful for "any person employed by or associated with any enterprise
engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce,
to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such
enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity." If the mother

=== PAGE 9 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
and stepfather's actions were not connected to an enterprise engaged in
interstate or foreign commerce, RICO might not apply.
Conclusion
Based on the provided information and relevant legal authorities, the mother
and stepfather's actions—including wire fraud (via PayPal transactions and
phone communications), mail fraud (via documents sent by mail), and
obstruction of justice (through false statements in legal proceedings)—could
potentially satisfy the "pattern of racketeering activity" requirement under
RICO if:
At least two acts of racketeering activity occurred within a 10-year
period;
These acts were related by having common purposes, results,
participants, victims, or methods; and
These acts demonstrated continuity, either through a closed period of
repeated conduct or a threat of future criminal activity.
Wire fraud, mail fraud, and obstruction of justice are all specifically
enumerated as predicate acts under 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1). Each PayPal
transaction, phone communication, mailed document, or false statement
made as part of a fraudulent scheme or to obstruct justice could constitute a
separate predicate act.
As emphasized in Nutrition Distribution LLC v. Custom Nutraceuticals LLC,
194 F.Supp.3d 952 (D. Ariz. 2016), "pleading a pattern of racketeering
activity requires the plaintiff to allege that the defendant participated in at
least two acts that were chargeable under the enumerated federal statutes.
The plaintiff must adequately plead the elements of each predicate act,
satisfying the pleading standard that would apply if the predicate act were a
stand-alone claim."
If the mother and stepfather's actions meet these requirements, they could
constitute a "pattern of racketeering activity" under RICO, potentially
subjecting them to both criminal penalties and civil liability under the RICO
statute. However, as noted in the exceptions and caveats section,
establishing RICO liability requires more than just proving a pattern of
racketeering activity—it also requires proving the existence of an enterprise
and showing that the defendants conducted the enterprise's affairs through
the pattern of racketeering activity.
In conclusion, if the mother and stepfather's acts of wire fraud, mail fraud,
and obstruction of justice meet the statutory definitions of these offenses
and demonstrate relatedness and continuity, they could satisfy the "pattern
of racketeering activity" requirement under RICO, making the mother and
stepfather potentially liable under the RICO statute.

U.S. Court of Appeals — Eighth Circuit
Extract
Section 1962(c) of the RICO Act makes it 'unlawful for any person employed
by or associated with any enterprise engaged in ... interstate ... commerce,
to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such
enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.' ... The pattern
element 'requires at least two acts of racketeering activity.' 18 U.S.C. §
1961(5); see also H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229,
237-38, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989). However, a mere allegation
of two or more acts is insufficient to state a RICO claim; the predicate acts
must be related and must 'amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal
activity.'
Summary
Mere allegations of acts are insufficient; they must show continuity and a
threat of ongoing criminal activity. This supports the proposition by outlining
the legal framework necessary to establish a RICO claim based on wire
fraud, mail fraud, or obstruction of justice.
U.S. v. Teitler, 802 F.2d 606 (2nd Cir. 1986)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Second Circuit
Extract
Appellant Jay Teitler was convicted of conspiring to conduct the affairs of an
enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity in violation of the
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, (RICO), 18 U.S.C. Sec.
1962(d) (1982), and of one count of mail fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec.
1341 (1982). ... Appellants, along with others, were charged in an
indictment alleging twenty-nine 'acts of racketeering'--including twenty-
eight mail fraud violations, id. Sec. 1341, and one count of obstruction of
justice, id. Sec. 1503. ... A pattern of racketeering activity is committed if
the Defendant committed at least two of the racketeering acts charged
against him or her in the indictment.... In addition [to proving two
racketeering acts], the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt
that the predicate acts constituted part of a larger pattern of activity that
characterized each Defendant's conduct of or participation in the affairs of
the law firm. That is to say, the predicate acts must have been connected
with each other by some common scheme, plan or motive so as to constitute
a pattern and not merely a series of disconnected acts.
Summary
The case of U.S. v. Teitler provides a precedent for understanding how a
pattern of racketeering activity can be established under RICO. It highlights

=== PAGE 11 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
that at least two predicate acts, such as mail fraud or obstruction of justice,
must be proven and that these acts must be part of a larger, connected
scheme. This directly supports the proposition that if the mother and
stepfather's actions meet these criteria, they could satisfy the "pattern of
racketeering activity" requirement under RICO.
Ashland Oil, Inc. v. Arnett, 875 F.2d 1271 (7th Cir. 1989)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Seventh Circuit
Extract
A pattern of racketeering activity 'requires at least two acts of racketeering
activity, one of which occurred after [October 15, 1970] and the last of which
occurred within ten years (excluding any period of imprisonment) after the
commission of a prior act of racketeering activity.' 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1961(5).
'Racketeering activity,' in turn, includes any act or threat 'chargeable' under
certain state laws (including arson), and any act 'indictable' under a number
of enumerated federal criminal statutes (including wire and mail fraud, and
bankruptcy fraud). 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1961(1).
Summary
The court outlines the statutory requirements for a "pattern of racketeering
activity" under RICO, which includes at least two acts of racketeering
activity within a 10-year period. The passage also clarifies that racketeering
activity includes acts indictable under federal statutes such as wire and mail
fraud. This directly supports the proposition that if the mother's and
stepfather's actions meet these criteria, they could constitute a pattern of
racketeering activity under RICO.
D'Addario v. Geller, 264 F.Supp.2d 367 (E.D. Va. 2003)
U.S. District Court — Eastern District of Virginia
Extract
Title 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) provides that 'it shall be unlawful for any person
employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities
of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate,
directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a
pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt.' According to
18 U.S.C. § 1961, racketeering must involve the commission of two or more
predicate acts, including mail fraud and obstruction of justice... Plaintiff
alleges multiple predicate acts of mail fraud and at least one predicate act of
obstruction of justice committed by defendant Geller in allegedly making
false statements to this court... The RICO statute itself requires 'at least two'
instances of racketeering activity. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5). Two acts are

necessary but not sufficient to establish a pattern of racketeering activity.
Sedima, 473 U.S. at 496 n. 14, 105 S.Ct. 3275. In H.J., Inc. v. Northwestern
Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989), the
Supreme Court held that a 'pattern' requires a showing of a relationship
between the predicate acts and a threat of continued criminal activity.
Summary
Statutory requirements for a RICO violation, specifically the need for at least
two predicate acts of racketeering activity, such as mail fraud and
obstruction of justice. It also emphasizes the necessity of a relationship
between these acts and a threat of continued criminal activity to establish a
"pattern." This directly supports the proposition that if the mother's and
stepfather's actions meet these criteria, they could constitute a pattern of
racketeering activity under RICO.
U.S. v. Welch, 656 F.2d 1039 (5th Cir. 1981)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
Engaging in a 'pattern of racketeering activity' requires at least two acts of
racketeering within a ten-year period. Finally, racketeering activity is
expressly defined to include only certain types of conduct, including acts
indictable under 18 U.S.C.A. § 1511... The gravamen of the offense described
in 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) is the conduct of an enterprise's affairs through a
pattern of racketeering activity. Thus, the Act does require a type of
relatedness: the two or more predicate crimes must be related to the affairs
of the enterprise but need not otherwise be related to each other.
Summary
The court in U.S. v. Welch discusses the requirements for establishing a
"pattern of racketeering activity" under RICO. It specifies that at least two
acts of racketeering within a ten-year period are required, and these acts
must be related to the affairs of the enterprise. This supports the proposition
that if the mother's and stepfather's actions meet the statutory definitions of
wire fraud, mail fraud, or obstruction of justice, and if they are related and
continuous, they could satisfy the "pattern of racketeering activity"
requirement under RICO.

Extract
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C.
§§ 1961-1968, which is directed at 'racketeering activity'—defined in §
1961(1) to encompass, inter alia, acts 'indictable' under specific federal
criminal provisions, including mail and wire fraud—provides in § 1964(c) for
a private civil action to recover treble damages by any person injured in his
business or property 'by reason of a violation of section 1962.' Section
1962(c) prohibits conducting or participating in the conduct of an enterprise
'through a pattern of racketeering activity.' ... Under the Court's opinion
today, two fraudulent mailings or uses of the wires occurring within 10 years
of each other might constitute a 'pattern of racketeering activity,' § 1961(5),
leading to civil RICO liability. ... The definition of 'pattern' may thus logically
be interpreted as meaning that the presence of the predicate acts is only the
beginning: something more is required for a 'pattern' to be proved. ... The
legislative history supports the view that two isolated acts of racketeering
activity do not constitute a pattern. As the Senate Report explained: 'The
target of [RICO] is thus not sporadic activity. The infiltration of legitimate
business normally requires more than one 'racketeering activity' and the
threat of continuing activity to be effective. It is this factor of continuity plus
relationship which combines to produce a pattern.'
Summary
RICO defines "racketeering activity" to include acts indictable under federal
criminal provisions such as mail and wire fraud. The statute requires at least
two acts of racketeering within a 10-year period to establish a "pattern of
racketeering activity." However, the presence of two acts alone is not
sufficient; there must be a continuity and relationship between the acts to
form a pattern. This interpretation supports the proposition that if the
mother's and stepfather's actions meet the statutory definitions and
demonstrate continuity and relationship, they could satisfy the RICO
requirements.
Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., Inc., 741 F.2d 482 (2nd Cir. 1984)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Second Circuit
Extract
Two of the RICO counts allege that the fraudulent purchase orders, invoices
and credit memoranda constitute a pattern of racketeering activity, the
predicate acts being separate and numerous violations of the Mail Fraud
Act, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1341 (1982) and the Wire Fraud Act, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1343
(1982)... It is helpful to look back to the definition in section 1961(1) of
'racketeering activity,' since we are referred to section 1962 by way of
section 1964(c), and section 1962(a) makes 'a pattern of racketeering
activity' 'unlawful' in certain circumstances... The 'racketeering activity' acts
under subparagraph (B) include 'any act which is indictable under' certain
provisions of federal law including mail fraud and wire fraud, in addition to

other typical organized crime activities (emphasis supplied)... 18 U.S.C. Sec.
1961(5) provides: (5) 'pattern of racketeering activity' requires at least two
acts of racketeering activity, one of which occurred after the effective date
of this chapter and the last of which occurred within ten years (excluding
any period of imprisonment) after the commission of a prior act of
racketeering activity....
Summary
Requirements for establishing a "pattern of racketeering activity" under
RICO, specifically referencing the need for at least two predicate acts of
racketeering activity, such as mail fraud and wire fraud, within a 10-year
period. This directly supports the proposition that if the mother's and
stepfather's actions meet these criteria, they could satisfy the RICO
requirements.
U.S. v. International Longshoremen's Ass'n, 518 F.Supp.2d 422 (E.D. N.Y.
2007)
U.S. District Court — Eastern District of New York
Extract
A substantial number of, the predicate acts alleged in the Amended
Complaint are asserted to be violations of the federal mail and wire fraud
statutes, 18 U.S.C. §§ 1341, 1343. As the Second Circuit has repeatedly
recognized, '[t]he essential elements of a mail [or wire] fraud violation are
(1) a scheme to defraud, (2) money or property [as the object of the
scheme], and (3) use of the mails [or wires] to further the scheme.' ... In
RICO cases, 'allegations of predicate mail and wire fraud acts should state
the contents of the communications, who was involved, where and when
they took place, and explain why they were fraudulent.'
Summary
The essential elements of mail and wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. §§ 1341, 1343
are outlined, which are necessary to establish these acts as predicate
offenses under RICO. The passage also emphasizes the need for specificity in
pleading these fraud claims, which is crucial for establishing a "pattern of
racketeering activity" under RICO. This supports the proposition by
providing the legal framework and requirements for proving mail and wire
fraud as part of a RICO claim.

Extract
In order to secure a conviction under RICO, the Government must prove
both the existence of an 'enterprise' and the connected 'pattern of
racketeering activity.' The enterprise is an entity, for present purposes a
group of persons associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a
course of conduct. The pattern of racketeering activity is, on the other hand,
a series of criminal acts as defined by the statute. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1) (1976
ed., Supp. III). The former is proved by evidence of an ongoing organization,
formal or informal, and by evidence that the various associates function as a
continuing unit. The latter is proved by evidence of the requisite number of
acts of racketeering committed by the participants in the enterprise.
Summary
The U.S. Supreme Court in United States v. Turkette clarified the
requirements for a RICO violation. Specifically, it emphasized that a RICO
conviction requires proof of both an "enterprise" and a "pattern of
racketeering activity." The passage explains that the enterprise can be a
group of individuals associated for a common purpose, and the pattern of
racketeering activity involves a series of criminal acts as defined by the
statute. This directly supports the proposition that if the mother and
stepfather's actions meet the statutory definitions of wire fraud, mail fraud,
or obstruction of justice, and if they are related and continuous, they could
satisfy the "pattern of racketeering activity" requirement under RICO.

U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
RICO makes it 'unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any
enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign
commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of
such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.' 18 U.S.C.
§ 1962(c) (emphasis added). ... The statute defines 'enterprise' to include
'any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity,
and any union or group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal
entity.' § 1961(4).
Summary
The passage from "Boyle v. United States" clarifies that RICO makes it
unlawful to participate in an enterprise's affairs through a pattern of
racketeering activity. It also defines what constitutes an "enterprise" under
RICO, which can include informal associations. This supports the proposition
by establishing that if the mother and stepfather's actions meet the criteria

for wire fraud, mail fraud, or obstruction of justice, and if these actions are
part of a pattern of racketeering activity, they could potentially be liable
under RICO.

U.S. Court of Appeals — Seventh Circuit
Extract
Allegations of fraud, however, are subject to the heightened pleading
standard of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b), which requires a plaintiff to
plead 'all averments of fraud ... with particularity.' Rule 9(b) is of course
applicable to allegations of fraud in a civil RICO complaint. See Vicom, Inc.
v. Harbridge Merchant Servs., Inc., 20 F.3d 771, 777 (7th Cir.1994); Midwest
Grinding Co. v. Spitz, 976 F.2d 1016, 1020 (7th Cir.1992). Accordingly, a
RICO plaintiff 'must, at a minimum, describe the predicate acts [of fraud]
with some specificity and state the time, place, and content of the alleged
communications perpetrating the fraud.' Midwest Grinding, 976 F.2d at
1020.
Summary
For a RICO claim involving fraud, the plaintiff must meet a heightened
pleading standard by describing the predicate acts of fraud with specificity,
including the time, place, and content of the alleged fraudulent
communications. This is relevant to the proposition because it outlines the
necessary legal framework and requirements for establishing a pattern of
racketeering activity involving fraud under RICO.

Extract
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C.
§§ 1961-1968, which is Title IX of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970
(OCCA), imposes criminal and civil liability upon persons who engage in
certain 'prohibited activities,' each of which is defined to include, as a
necessary element, proof of a 'pattern of racketeering activity,' § 1962.
'Racketeering activity' means 'any act or threat involving' specified state-law
crimes, any 'act' indictable under specified federal statutes, and certain
federal 'offenses.' § 1961(1). A 'pattern' requires 'at least two acts of
racketeering activity' within a 10-year period. § 1961(5).

U.S. v. Palumbo Bros., Inc., 145 F.3d 850 (7th Cir. 1998)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Seventh Circuit
Extract
In Count 1, the United States charges the defendants with a substantive
RICO offense, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). The indictment identifies 23
predicate acts, including: (1) acts of mail and wire fraud, in violation of 18
U.S.C. §§ 1341 and 1343... Count 1 of the indictment charges the defendants
with a substantive RICO offense and alleges 23 predicate acts to establish
their pattern of racketeering activity... Separate violations of other federal
and state criminal statutes are the predicate acts upon which a pattern of
racketeering activity is created. Those predicate acts involve conduct that is
otherwise 'chargeable' or 'indictable' and violations that are 'punishable'
pursuant to independent criminal statutes, and RICO specifically identifies
mail fraud as a predicate act for liability. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1).
Summary
Requirements for a RICO offense, specifically the need for predicate acts
such as mail and wire fraud. It highlights that a pattern of racketeering
activity can be established through multiple predicate acts, which are
chargeable under federal statutes. This directly supports the proposition
that if the mother and stepfather's actions meet the statutory definitions of
wire fraud, mail fraud, or obstruction of justice, they could satisfy the
"pattern of racketeering activity" requirement under RICO.

The passage explains the requirements for a RICO violation, specifically the
need for a "pattern of racketeering activity," which includes at least two
predicate acts as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1). This directly supports the
proposition that if the actions of the mother and stepfather meet the

Co., 473 U.S. 479, 105 S.Ct. 3275, 3285, 87 L.Ed.2d 346 (1985). RICO
defines racketeering activity as, inter alia, any act that is indictable under
18 U.S.C. Sec. 1341 (mail fraud) or 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1343 (wire fraud). See 18
U.S.C. Sec. 1961(1)(B). RICO also states that a 'pattern of racketeering
activity' requires at least two acts of racketeering activity.
Summary
This pattern requires at least two acts of racketeering activity, which can
include wire fraud and mail fraud, as defined under 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1). This
directly supports the proposition that if the mother and stepfather's actions

RICO makes it unlawful for 'any person employed by or associated with any
enterprise engaged in...interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or
participate...in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of
racketeering activity.' 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). 'Racketeering activity' includes
any of several listed crimes 'which is chargeable under State law and
punishable by imprisonment for more than one year,' as well as any act
chargeable under one of several enumerated federal statutes. § 1961(1). A
'pattern of racketeering activity' requires at least two acts of racketeering
activity, which must be 'related' and 'amount to or pose a threat of continued
criminal activity.' ... Pleading a pattern of racketeering activity requires the
plaintiff to allege that the defendant participated in at least two acts that
were chargeable under the enumerated federal statutes. The plaintiff must
adequately plead the elements of each predicate act, satisfying the pleading
standard that would apply if the predicate act were a stand-alone claim.
Summary
These acts must be chargeable under federal statutes listed in § 1961(1),
such as wire fraud, mail fraud, or obstruction of justice. The passage also
emphasizes the need for the plaintiff to adequately plead the elements of
each predicate act with particularity.

Summary
The RICO Act defines "racketeering activity" to include acts indictable under
federal criminal provisions such as mail and wire fraud. This directly
supports the proposition that if the mother and stepfather's actions meet the
statutory definitions of wire fraud, mail fraud, or obstruction of justice, they
could be considered as predicate acts under RICO. The passage also
references the requirement of a "pattern of racketeering activity," which
aligns with the proposition's mention of needing at least two predicate acts

Summary
To establish a RICO violation, a plaintiff must demonstrate at least two
predicate acts of racketeering activity that are related and pose a threat of
continued criminal activity. The passage specifically mentions mail and wire
fraud as examples of such predicate acts, which aligns with the proposition
that the mother and stepfather's actions could constitute a pattern of
racketeering activity if they meet these criteria.

Extract
RICO makes it unlawful for “any person employed by or associated with any
enterprise engaged in. .. interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or
participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs
through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt,” or
to conspire to do so. 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), (d); see also Id. § 1964(c) (creating
a private right of action to “[a]ny person injured in his business or property
by reason of a violation of [the criminal RICO provisions]”). The statute
defines “racketeering activity” broadly “to include a host of so-called
predicate acts.” Bridge v. Phoenix Bond & Indem. Co., 553 U.S. 639, 647
(2008). As relevant here, racketeering activity includes “any act or threat
involving. .. extortion” and “any act which is indictable under” the federal
mail fraud and wire fraud statutes, 18 U.S.C. §§ 1341 (mail fraud), 1343
(wire fraud). 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1). Proof of a predicate act alone is
insufficient to generate civil RICO liability; the Julsonnets must also prove a
pattern of racketeering activity by showing both continuity and relatedness
of the predicate acts. See Giuliano v. Fulton, 399 F.3d 381, 386-387 (1st Cir.
2005). They may show continuity by proving either a “closed period of
repeated conduct” that “amounted to. .. continued criminal activity” or “past
conduct that by its nature projects into the future with a threat of
repetition.” H.J. Inc. v. Nw. Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 237, 241 (1989).
Predicate acts are related when they “embrace[] criminal acts that have the
same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of
commission, or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics
and are not isolated events.”
Summary
Requirements for establishing a RICO claim, specifically the need for a
pattern of racketeering activity, which includes predicate acts such as wire
fraud and mail fraud. It explains that these acts must be related and
continuous to satisfy the RICO requirements. This directly supports the
proposition that if the mother's and stepfather's actions meet these criteria,
they could constitute a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO.

To plead a 'pattern' of 'racketeering activity,' a plaintiff must set forth well-
pled allegations of conduct violating specified federal or state statutes.
Racketeering acts include... violations of certain federal statutes, such as
the mail and wire fraud statutes. See 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1). A ''pattern of
racketeering activity' requires at least two acts of racketeering activity'
within ten years of each other. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5). However, even where
parties committed two acts of racketeering in a ten-year period, the

=== PAGE 22 ===

racketeering acts do not qualify as a 'pattern' unless they meet a 'continuity'
requirement. See Home Orthopedics Corp. v. Rodriguez, 781 F.3d 521, 528
(1st Cir. 2015). To satisfy this mandate, a plaintiff must plead facts showing
that racketeering acts are 'related, and that they amount to or pose a threat
of continued criminal activity.'
Summary
Requirements for establishing a "pattern of racketeering activity" under
RICO, which includes committing at least two acts of racketeering activity
within a ten-year period. These acts must be related and pose a threat of
continued criminal activity. The passage specifically mentions mail and wire
fraud as examples of racketeering acts under 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1), which are
relevant to the proposition. The passage also emphasizes the need for
continuity, which aligns with the proposition's requirement for related and
continuous actions.

Extract
Congress designed the Federal Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act (RICO), Title 18, United States Code, Section 1961, et
seq. as a flexible tool to fight organized crime. As such, it makes the
following activities unlawful: (a) investing income derived, directly or
indirectly, from a pattern of racketeering activity through collection of an
unlawful debt in any enterprise which affects interstate commerce; (b)
acquiring or maintaining an interest in any enterprise which affects
interstate commerce through a pattern of racketeering activity or through
collection of an unlawful debt; (c) conducting or participating in the affairs
of any enterprise which affects interstate commerce through a pattern of
racketeering activity or collection of an unlawful debt; or (d) conspiring to
violate any of the provisions of Section 1962(a)-(c). 18 U.S.C. § 1962.
'Racketeering activities' covers a wide range of federal and state crimes,
including acts that are '`chargeable' under several generically described
state criminal laws, any act 'indictable' under numerous specific federal
criminal provisions, including mail and wire fraud, and any 'offense'

such as wire fraud or mail fraud, within a ten-year period. This directly
supports the proposition that if the mother and stepfather's actions meet
these criteria, they could be considered as engaging in a pattern of
racketeering activity under RICO.
18 U.S.C. § 1961 18 U.S.C. § 1961 Definitions
Extract
As used in this chapter- 'racketeering activity' means ... (B) any act which is
indictable under any of the following provisions of title 18, United States
Code: ... section 1341 (relating to mail fraud), section 1343 (relating to wire
fraud), ... section 1503 (relating to obstruction of justice), ... 'pattern of
racketeering activity' requires at least two acts of racketeering activity, one
of which occurred after the effective date of this chapter and the last of
which occurred within ten years (excluding any period of imprisonment)
after the commission of a prior act of racketeering activity;
Summary
The definition of "racketeering activity" under 18 U.S.C. § 1961 includes acts
such as mail fraud, wire fraud, and obstruction of justice. The statute also
specifies that a "pattern of racketeering activity" requires at least two acts
of racketeering activity within a 10-year period. This directly supports the
proposition that if the mother and stepfather's actions meet these definitions
and are related and continuous, they could satisfy the "pattern of
racketeering activity" requirement under RICO.

Extract
Whoever, having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to
defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent
pretenses, representations, or promises, transmits or causes to be
transmitted by means of wire, radio, or television communication in
interstate or foreign commerce, any writings, signs, signals, pictures, or
sounds for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice, shall be fined
under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both.

Summary
The passage from 18 U.S.C. § 1343 defines wire fraud as a scheme to
defraud or obtain money or property through false pretenses, using wire
communications in interstate or foreign commerce. This aligns with the
proposition that the mother and stepfather's actions, if they involved
fraudulent PayPal transactions or phone communications, could constitute
wire fraud. Wire fraud is a predicate act under RICO, and if combined with
other acts like mail fraud or obstruction of justice, it could establish a
pattern of racketeering activity.
18 U.S.C. § 1341 18 U.S.C. § 1341 Frauds and Swindles
Extract
Whoever, having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to
defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent
pretenses, representations, or promises... for the purpose of executing such
scheme or artifice or attempting so to do, places in any post office or
authorized depository for mail matter, any matter or thing whatever to be
sent or delivered by the Postal Service, or deposits or causes to be deposited
any matter or thing whatever to be sent or delivered by any private or
commercial interstate carrier... shall be fined under this title or imprisoned
not more than 20 years, or both.
Summary
18 U.S.C. § 1341 defines mail fraud as involving any scheme to defraud or
obtain money or property through false pretenses, where the execution of
the scheme involves sending or delivering items via mail or interstate
carriers. This statute is relevant to the proposition because it provides the
legal basis for considering mail fraud as a predicate act under RICO. If the
mother and stepfather's actions involved sending fraudulent documents or
communications through mail or carriers, it could constitute mail fraud, thus
supporting the pattern of racketeering activity under RICO.
18 U.S.C. § 1512 18 U.S.C. § 1512 Tampering With a Witness, Victim, Or an
Informant
Extract
Whoever knowingly uses intimidation, threatens, or corruptly persuades
another person, or attempts to do so, or engages in misleading conduct
toward another person, with intent to... hinder, delay, or prevent the
communication to a law enforcement officer or judge of the United States of
information relating to the commission or possible commission of a Federal
offense... shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 20
years, or both.

=== PAGE 25 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
18 U.S.C. § 1512 outlines actions that constitute obstruction of justice, such
as using intimidation or misleading conduct to prevent communication to
law enforcement about a federal offense. This aligns with the proposition
that obstruction of justice could be a predicate act under RICO if the actions
are related and continuous.
18 U.S.C. § 1962 18 U.S.C. § 1962 Prohibited Activities
Extract
It shall be unlawful for any person through a pattern of racketeering activity
or through collection of an unlawful debt to acquire or maintain, directly or
indirectly, any interest in or control of any enterprise which is engaged in, or
the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce.

Extract
RICO, it reasoned, provides an additional sanction for patterns of violations
of statutes such as the mail fraud statute... The predicate acts may also be
acts indictable under federal law, including... wire fraud; mail fraud;...
obstruction of justice;... (36.) See Goren v. New Vision Int'l, Inc., 156 F.3d
721, 728-729 (4th Cir. 1998) (holding that a higher standard must be held
when the two predicate acts alleged are mail or wire fraud); Schultz v.
Rhode Island Hosp. Trust Nat'l Bank, 94 F.3d 721, 731 (1st Cir. 1996)
(stating 'while two predicate acts are necessary to form a RICO `pattern'
they may not be sufficient unless they are both `related' and `amount to or
pose a threat of continued criminal activity' (quoting H.J., Inc., 492 U.S. at
239-40)).
Summary
The passage explains that RICO provides an additional sanction for patterns
of violations of statutes like the mail fraud statute. It also lists wire fraud,
mail fraud, and obstruction of justice as predicate acts under federal law
that can be used to establish a RICO violation. Furthermore, it highlights the

=== PAGE 26 ===

requirement that the predicate acts must be related and pose a threat of
continued criminal activity to satisfy the RICO pattern requirement. This
directly supports the proposition that the described actions, if they meet
these criteria, could satisfy the "pattern of racketeering activity"
requirement under RICO.

Extract
An act of racketeering activity includes any act or threat that is indictable as
a violation of certain federal statutes, or chargeable under certain state
criminal laws. Here, the plaintiff contends that defendant engaged in
[describe the RICO violations that are alleged]... 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1)
identifies the RICO predicate 'acts of racketeering activity.' The most
commonly charged RICO predicate acts are mail fraud and wire fraud, 18
U.S.C. §§ 1341, 1343... The plaintiff has charged the defendant with mail
[wire] fraud as a predicate act under RICO. Under 18 U.S.C. § 1341 [1343], a
person who has devised or intended to devise a scheme or artifice to
defraud, or to obtain money or property by means of false or fraudulent
pretenses, representations, or promises, and who uses the mails [or
interstate wire communications] to execute or attempt to execute the
scheme or artifice to defraud, has committed mail [wire] fraud... A pattern of
racketeering activity requires at least two acts of racketeering activity
within ten years of each other... Those acts must be related to each other,
and must also amount to, or pose a threat of, continuing criminal activity.
Summary
The RICO statute defines acts of racketeering activity to include mail and
wire fraud, which are relevant to the proposition. The passage explains the
elements required to establish mail or wire fraud as predicate acts under
RICO. It also clarifies that a pattern of racketeering activity requires at least
two related acts within a ten-year period, which aligns with the proposition's
requirement for a pattern of racketeering activity.

Summary
RICO requires at least two predicate acts of racketeering activity, which can
include wire fraud, mail fraud, and obstruction of justice. These acts are
defined under 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1), and if they occur within a 10-year period
and are related and continuous, they can establish a "pattern of
racketeering activity." This directly supports the proposition that the
described actions could meet the RICO requirements if they fit these

Summary
RICO requires at least two predicate acts of racketeering activity, such as
wire fraud, mail fraud, or obstruction of justice, to establish a "pattern of
racketeering activity." The passage confirms that these acts are recognized
under RICO and that a formal conviction of these acts is not necessary for
RICO liability. This supports the proposition that the described actions could
meet the statutory definitions and satisfy the RICO requirements if they are
related and continuous.
Chapter 4. Elements of Cause of Action
Civil RICO: A Definitive Guide. Fifth Edition - American Bar
Association - Gregory P. Joseph
Extract
Mail and wire fraud are the two most frequently alleged predicate acts. The
mail fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1341, prohibits any person from knowingly
causing the use of the mails—or, since 1994, private carrier services like
FedEx—'for the purpose of executing' any 'scheme or artifice to defraud.'
The actual violation is the mailing, which must relate to the underlying
fraudulent scheme... Under mail and wire fraud statutes, every mail or wire
communication allegedly in furtherance of the fraudulent scheme is a
separate violation, even individual communications that are not themselves
fraudulent.
Summary
Mail and wire fraud are recognized as predicate acts under RICO. Each act
of mailing or wire communication in furtherance of a fraudulent scheme is
considered a separate violation. This supports the proposition that multiple
acts of wire and mail fraud could establish a "pattern of racketeering
activity" if they are related and continuous.

RECONCEIVING COERCION-BASED CRIMINAL DEFENSES.

School of Law - Galoob, Stephen R. - 2022-03-22
Extract
The inquiry here is meant to invoke the 'pattern of racketeering activity'
element of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).
The Organized Crime Control Act (1970), which includes RICO, provides that
'criminal conduct forms a pattern if it embraces criminal acts that have the
same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of
commission, or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics
and are not isolated events.' The Supreme Court characterized this
requirement as a 'relationship' element and held that the statute further
requires a 'continuity' element, 'referring either to a closed period of
repeated conduct, or to past conduct that by its nature projects into the
future with a threat of repetition.'
Summary
The passage provides a detailed explanation of what constitutes a "pattern
of racketeering activity" under RICO. It highlights the need for criminal acts
to have similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of
commission, and to be interrelated by distinguishing characteristics.
Additionally, it emphasizes the requirement of a "relationship" and
"continuity" element, which aligns with the proposition that the described
actions, if related and continuous, could satisfy the RICO requirement.
