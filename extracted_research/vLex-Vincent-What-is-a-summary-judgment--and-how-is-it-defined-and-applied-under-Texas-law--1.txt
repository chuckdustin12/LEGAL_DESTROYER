Question
What is a summary judgment, and how is it defined and applied under Texas
law?
Answer (Texas)
Short response
In Texas, a summary judgment is a procedural mechanism that allows a
court to dispose of a case without a full trial when there is no genuine issue
of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of
law. Summary judgments in Texas are governed primarily by Rule 166a of
the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure and come in two forms: traditional
summary judgments under Rule 166a(c) and no-evidence summary
judgments under Rule 166a(i).
Summary
Summary judgment is a critical procedural tool in Texas law that enables
courts to efficiently resolve cases without the necessity of a full trial when
appropriate circumstances exist. Under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 166a,
summary judgment is proper when the movant establishes that there is no
genuine issue of material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as
a matter of law. This procedure serves the important function of eliminating
patently unmeritorious claims and untenable defenses, thereby promoting
judicial economy and preventing unnecessary litigation.
Texas recognizes two distinct types of summary judgments: traditional
summary judgments under Rule 166a(c) and no-evidence summary
judgments under Rule 166a(i). In a traditional motion, the burden falls on
the movant to conclusively prove all elements of their claim or defense,
while in a no-evidence motion, the movant need only allege the absence of
evidence supporting an essential element of the nonmovant's claim.
Regardless of the type, Texas courts apply a strict standard of review,
viewing evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmovant and resolving
all doubts in their favor, ensuring that summary judgment is granted only in
clear cases where the legal rights of the parties can be determined without
the need for factual determinations by a trier of fact.
Definition and Purpose of Summary Judgment
Summary judgment in Texas is a procedural mechanism designed to
efficiently resolve cases without the need for a full trial when there is no
genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment
as a matter of law. As described by Texas courts, the purpose of summary
judgment is "to eliminate patently unmeritorious claims and untenable

defenses." Cove Invs., Inc. v. Manges, 602 S.W.2d 512, 514 (Tex. 1980), as
cited in Cluett v. Medical Protective Co., 829 S.W.2d 822 (Tex. App. 1992).
The Texas Supreme Court has further clarified that summary judgment
provides "a method of summarily terminating a case when it clearly appears
that only a question of law is involved and that no genuine issue of material
fact remains." Rhone-Poulenc v. Steel, 997 S.W.2d 217, 42 Tex. Sup. Ct. J.
927 (Tex. 1999) ("Rule 166a provides a method of summarily terminating a
case when it clearly appears that only a question of law is involved and that
there is no genuine fact issue.").
Summary judgment is not designed to deprive litigants of their right to trial
but rather to facilitate judicial efficiency in cases where trial would be
unnecessary. As the Texas Court of Appeals explained, "[t]he function of a
summary judgment is not to deprive a litigant of its right to a full hearing on
the merits of any real issue of fact but is to eliminate patently unmeritorious
claims and untenable defenses." Cluett v. Medical Protective Co., 829 S.W.2d
822 (Tex. App. 1992).
Types of Summary Judgment Under Texas Law
Texas law recognizes two distinct types of summary judgments, each with its
own standard and burden of proof: traditional summary judgments under
Rule 166a(c) and no-evidence summary judgments under Rule 166a(i).
Traditional Summary Judgment (Rule 166a(c))
The traditional summary judgment is governed by Rule 166a(c) of the Texas
Rules of Civil Procedure. As numerous Texas courts have explained, to
succeed on a traditional summary judgment motion, "the movant has the
burden of showing that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that it
is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Nixon v. Mr. Property
Management Co., 690 S.W.2d 546, 548-49 (Tex. 1985), as cited in Coffeyville
Res. Crude Transp. v. Exxonmobil Pipeline Co., 12-23-00276-CV (Tex. App.
Jan 31, 2025).
This burden is substantial. The Texas Supreme Court has emphasized that
"[t]he burden on a movant seeking summary judgment on traditional
grounds is great." Michael v. Dyke, 41 S.W.3d 746 (Tex. App. 2001) ("The
distinction between a traditional and a no-evidence summary judgment is
critical. The burden on a movant seeking summary judgment on traditional
grounds is great."). It should be noted that this case was later stated as
abrogated by Thompson v. Bank of Am., N.A., 13 F.Supp.3d 636 (N.D. Tex.
2014); however, the abrogation appears related to other aspects of the case
and not to its characterization of the burden in traditional summary
judgment motions, as this standard continues to be cited in recent Texas
cases.

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
The movant's burden varies depending on whether they are the plaintiff or
defendant:
When a plaintiff moves for summary judgment on its own claim, "the
plaintiff must conclusively prove all essential elements of its cause of
action." Rhône-Poulenc, Inc. v. Steel, 997 S.W.2d 217, 223 (Tex. 1999),
as cited in Star Elec., Inc. v. Northpark Office Tower, LP, NO.
01-17-00364-CV (Tex. App. Jul 14, 2020).
A defendant can obtain summary judgment by either:
"[C]onclusively negat[ing] at least one essential element of the
nonmovant's cause of action." Randall's Food Mkts., Inc. v.
Johnson, 891 S.W.2d 640, 644 (Tex. 1995), as cited in Coffeyville
Res. Crude Transp. v. Exxonmobil Pipeline Co., 12-23-00276-CV
(Tex. App. Jan 31, 2025).
"[C]onclusively establish[ing] each element of an affirmative
defense." Randall's Food Mkts., Inc. v. Johnson, 891 S.W.2d 640,
644 (Tex. 1995), as cited in Coffeyville Res. Crude Transp. v.
Exxonmobil Pipeline Co., 12-23-00276-CV (Tex. App. Jan 31, 2025).
The standard is conclusive proof—meaning evidence that is so strong that
reasonable minds could not differ. As the Texas Court of Appeals stated, "[a]
matter is conclusively established if reasonable people could not differ as to
the conclusion to be drawn from the evidence." City of Keller v. Wilson, 168
S.W.3d 802, 816 (Tex. 2005), as cited in Tex. Appleseed v. Spring Branch
Indep. Sch. Dist., 388 S.W.3d 775 (Tex. App. 2012).
No-Evidence Summary Judgment (Rule 166a(i))
In 1997, Texas amended its summary judgment rule to add a no-evidence
provision, Rule 166a(i), which more closely aligns with federal summary
judgment practice. This amendment made it "easier to file and, arguably, to
obtain summary judgment" in Texas state courts. Summary Judgment
Practice (2016-07-27).
Under Rule 166a(i), "a party may move for summary judgment 'on the
ground that there is no evidence of one or more essential elements of a
claim or defense on which an adverse party would have the burden of proof
at trial.'" Nickerson v. Unique Emp't I, Ltd. (Tex. Court of Appeals,
2024-01-04).
The Texas Supreme Court has characterized a no-evidence summary
judgment as "essentially a pretrial directed verdict." Panhandle Baptist
Foundation v. Clodfelter, 54 S.W.3d 66 (Tex. App. 2001).
The key distinction between traditional and no-evidence summary judgments
lies in the burden of proof:
"The movant has the burden to show that there is no genuine issue of
material fact [in a traditional motion], while in a no-evidence summary
judgment, the movant asserts that there is no evidence of one or more
1.

essential elements of a claim." Cook v. Nacogdoches Anesthesia Group, 167
S.W.3d 476 (Tex. 2005).
Once a no-evidence motion is properly filed:
"To defeat a no-evidence motion, the non[]movant must produce evidence
raising a genuine issue of material fact as to the challenged elements." 
Nickerson v. Unique Emp't I, Ltd. (Tex. Court of Appeals, 2024-01-04).
The amount of evidence required to defeat a no-evidence motion is "more
than a scintilla of probative evidence." Cook v. Nacogdoches Anesthesia
Group, 167 S.W.3d 476 (Tex. 2005) ("More than a scintilla of evidence exists
when the evidence rises to a level that would enable reasonable and fair-
minded people to differ in their conclusions.").
Combined Motions
Texas law allows parties to file combination motions that assert both
traditional and no-evidence grounds for summary judgment:
"A party seeking summary judgment may combine in a single motion a
request for summary judgment under the traditional and no-evidence
standards." Binur v. Jacobo, 135 S.W.3d 646, 650-51 (Tex. 2004), as cited in 
Star Elec., Inc. v. Northpark Office Tower, LP, NO. 01-17-00364-CV (Tex.
App. Jul 14, 2020).
When a party files such a combined motion, Texas courts generally review
the no-evidence grounds first:
"When a party has sought summary judgment on both grounds and the trial
court's order does not specify its reasons for granting summary judgment,
we first review the propriety of the summary judgment under the no-
evidence standard." Ford Motor Co. v. Ridgway, 135 S.W.3d 598, 600 (Tex.
2004), as cited in Star Elec., Inc. v. Northpark Office Tower, LP, NO.
01-17-00364-CV (Tex. App. Jul 14, 2020).
This sequencing makes practical sense, as noted by the Court of Appeals in
Nickerson: "If the non[]movant fails to meet its burden under the no-
evidence motion, there is no need to address the challenge to the traditional
motion as it necessarily fails." Nickerson v. Unique Emp't I, Ltd. (Tex. Court
of Appeals, 2024-01-04).
Standard of Review for Summary Judgment
Texas courts apply a specific standard of review to summary judgment
decisions. All summary judgment decisions are reviewed de novo, meaning
the appellate court gives no deference to the trial court's ruling. As the
Texas Supreme Court has consistently stated:
"We review de novo a trial court's ruling on a motion for summary
judgment." Mann Frankfort Stein & Lipp Advisors, Inc. v. Fielding, 289 S.W.
3d 844, 848 (Tex. 2009), as cited in Nguyen v. Watts, 605 S.W.3d 761 (Tex.
App. 2020).

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
In conducting this de novo review, Texas courts apply a consistent standard
that strongly favors the nonmovant:
Evidence favorable to the nonmovant is taken as true.
Every reasonable inference is indulged in favor of the nonmovant.
Any doubts are resolved in favor of the nonmovant.
This standard has been articulated in numerous decisions. For example, as
the Texas Supreme Court explained:
"We review summary judgment evidence 'in the light most favorable to the
party against whom the summary judgment was rendered, crediting
evidence favorable to that party if reasonable jurors could, and disregarding
contrary evidence unless reasonable jurors could not.'" Seabright Ins. Co. v.
Lopez, 465 S.W.3d 637 (Tex. 2015).
Similarly, the Texas Court of Appeals noted:
"To determine if the non-movant raised a fact issue, we review the evidence
in the light most favorable to the non-movant, crediting favorable evidence if
reasonable jurors could do so, and disregarding contrary evidence unless
reasonable jurors could not." Hawthorne v. Guenther, 461 S.W.3d 218, 221
(Tex. App. 2015).
The only situation where this standard differs slightly is in the context of
cross-motions for summary judgment, where both parties have moved for
summary judgment on the same issues. In such cases:
"When both sides move for summary judgment and the trial court grants one
motion and denies the other, we review the summary judgment evidence
presented by both sides and determine all questions presented." Mann
Frankfort Stein & Lipp Advisors, Inc. v. Fielding, 289 S.W.3d 844, 848 (Tex.
2009).
In these situations, the appellate court "render[s] the judgment as the trial
court should have rendered." Comm'rs Court of Titus County v. Agan, 940
S.W.2d 77, 81 (Tex. 1997), as cited in Mann Frankfort Stein & Lipp Advisors,
Inc. v. Fielding, 289 S.W.3d 844, 848 (Tex. 2009).
Procedural Requirements and Considerations
Response to Summary Judgment Motion
Once a movant has filed a summary judgment motion, the burden shifts to
the nonmovant to respond and raise fact issues that would preclude
summary judgment:
"Once the movant establishes a right to summary judgment, the nonmovant
has the burden to respond to the motion and present to the trial court any
issues that would preclude summary judgment." City of Houston v. Clear
Creek Basin Auth., 589 S.W.2d 671, 678-79 (Tex. 1979), as cited in 
1. 
2. 
3. 

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Coffeyville Res. Crude Transp. v. Exxonmobil Pipeline Co., 12-23-00276-CV
(Tex. App. Jan 31, 2025).
However, it's important to note that this burden-shifting only occurs after
the movant has satisfied their initial burden. As the Texas Supreme Court
emphasized:
"The nonmovant has no burden to respond to a summary judgment motion
unless the movant conclusively establishes its cause of action or defense." 
Rhone-Poulenc v. Steel, 997 S.W.2d 217, 42 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 927 (Tex. 1999).
This is a crucial consideration because summary judgment cannot be
granted by default simply because the nonmovant failed to respond:
"The trial court may not grant summary judgment by default because the
nonmovant did not respond to the summary judgment motion when the
movant's summary judgment proof is legally insufficient." City of Houston v.
Clear Creek Basin Auth., 589 S.W.2d 671, 678 (Tex. 1979), as cited in Rhone-
Poulenc v. Steel, 997 S.W.2d 217, 42 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 927 (Tex. 1999).
The Texas Court of Appeals in Michael v. Dyke further emphasized this
principle, stating that "[a] summary judgment motion must stand on its own
merits" and even without a response, "the movant still must establish his
entitlement to a summary judgment on the issues expressly presented to the
trial court by conclusively proving all essential elements of his cause of
action or defense as a matter of law." Michael v. Dyke, 41 S.W.3d 746 (Tex.
App. 2001). As noted earlier, this case was subsequently abrogated by 
Thompson v. Bank of Am., N.A., 13 F.Supp.3d 636 (N.D. Tex. 2014), but the
principle regarding the movant's burden remains valid in Texas summary
judgment practice.
Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment
When both parties file motions for summary judgment on the same issues,
special considerations apply:
"When both parties move for summary judgment, each party must carry its
own burden, and neither can prevail because of the failure of the other to
discharge its burden." Cluett v. Medical Protective Co., 829 S.W.2d 822 (Tex.
App. 1992).
In reviewing cross-motions for summary judgment:
"When counter motions for summary judgment are properly before the trial
court at the time judgment is rendered, all the evidence accompanying both
motions should be considered in deciding whether to grant either party's
motion." Perkins v. Groff, 936 S.W.2d 661 (Tex. App. 1996).
The standard of review in such cases requires that "we must indulge all
reasonable inferences and resolve all doubts in favor of the losing party." 
Perkins v. Groff, 936 S.W.2d 661 (Tex. App. 1996).

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
The Written Motion Requirement
Texas summary judgment practice requires that all theories in support of or
opposition to summary judgment be presented in writing:
"[A]ll theories in support of a summary judgment, as well as all opposing
issues, must be presented in writing to the court at the hearing." Casso v.
Brand, 776 S.W.2d 551 (Tex. 1989).
It should be noted that Casso v. Brand was subsequently overruled by Steve
Childers v. King Ranch, Inc., No. 13-03-006-CV (TX 4/7/2005), but not on this
particular point regarding the requirement for written presentation of
theories.
Material Fact Issues
Central to summary judgment practice is the concept of "genuine issues of
material fact." For summary judgment to be proper, there must be no
genuine issue of material fact that would require resolution by a trier of fact.
The Texas courts have provided guidance on what constitutes a material fact
issue. According to the Texas Court of Appeals:
"Evidence raises a genuine issue of material fact if reasonable and fair-
minded jurors could differ in their conclusions in light of all the evidence
presented." Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. v. Mayes, 236 S.W.3d 754, 755 (Tex.
2007), as cited in Martinez v. Martinez, NUMBER 13-19-00518-CV (Tex. App.
Oct 01, 2020).
In the context of no-evidence motions, the nonmovant must produce "more
than a scintilla of probative evidence to raise a genuine issue of material
fact." King Ranch, Inc. v. Chapman, 118 S.W.3d 742, 751 (Tex. 2003), as
cited in Cook v. Nacogdoches Anesthesia Group, 167 S.W.3d 476 (Tex. 2005).
The Texas Supreme Court clarifies that "[m]ore than a scintilla of evidence
exists when the evidence rises to a level that would enable reasonable and
fair-minded people to differ in their conclusions." King Ranch, Inc. v.
Chapman, 118 S.W.3d 742, 751 (Tex. 2003), as cited in Cook v. Nacogdoches
Anesthesia Group, 167 S.W.3d 476 (Tex. 2005).
Evolution of Summary Judgment in Texas
Summary judgment practice in Texas has evolved significantly over time. As
noted in the secondary source on summary judgment practice, there has
been "an increase in the use of summary judgments in Texas state courts" in
recent years. Summary Judgment Practice (2016-07-27).
This increase is attributed largely to a 1997 amendment to the Texas
summary judgment rule that added the no-evidence provision in Rule
166a(i):

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
"Prior to 1997, many attorneys perceived, accurately or not, that it was
easier to get summary judgment in federal court than state court. In 1997,
the state summary judgment rule was amended to conform with the burden
of proof under the federal rules. Therefore, there may no longer be a
significant difference between filing summary judgment in federal court and
filing in state court. The amendment to the state summary judgment rule
has made it easier to file and, arguably, to obtain summary judgment." 
Summary Judgment Practice (2016-07-27).
This amendment moved Texas summary judgment practice closer to the
federal standard, which some scholars and practitioners believe has made
summary judgment more accessible in Texas state courts.
Exceptional Cases: Legal Issues Only
In some instances, a summary judgment might be appropriate not because
facts are undisputed, but because the case presents only legal questions:
"If the issue raised is based upon undisputed and unambiguous facts, then
the reviewing court may determine the question presented as a matter of
law." Cook v. Nacogdoches Anesthesia Group, 167 S.W.3d 476 (Tex. 2005).
Similarly, an early Texas case explained that one purpose of summary
judgment is "to provide a method of summarily terminating a case when it
clearly appears that only a question of law is involved and that no genuine
issue of material fact remains." Gaines v. Hamman, 163 Tex. 618, 626, 358
S.W.2d 557, 563 (1962), as cited in Cluett v. Medical Protective Co., 829 S.W.
2d 822 (Tex. App. 1992).
Conclusion
Summary judgment in Texas is a procedural mechanism allowing courts to
dispose of cases without a full trial when there is no genuine issue of
material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
Texas recognizes two types of summary judgments: traditional summary
judgments under Rule 166a(c) and no-evidence summary judgments under
Rule 166a(i).
In traditional summary judgments, the movant bears the considerable
burden of conclusively establishing that no genuine issue of material fact
exists and that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law. A defendant
can succeed by either negating at least one essential element of the
plaintiff's claim or by conclusively establishing all elements of an affirmative
defense. A plaintiff must conclusively prove all essential elements of their
cause of action.
No-evidence summary judgments require the movant to merely point out the
absence of evidence supporting an essential element of the nonmovant's
claim, after which the burden shifts to the nonmovant to produce more than
a scintilla of probative evidence raising a genuine issue of material fact.

=== PAGE 9 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Regardless of the type of summary judgment motion, Texas courts apply a
consistent standard of review that strongly favors the nonmovant by taking
evidence favorable to them as true, indulging every reasonable inference in
their favor, and resolving all doubts in their favor.
The 1997 addition of the no-evidence summary judgment provision has
brought Texas practice closer to the federal standard and has led to
increased use of summary judgments in Texas state courts. This evolution
reflects a balance between the right to trial and judicial efficiency,
consistent with the fundamental purpose of summary judgment: "to
eliminate patently unmeritorious claims and untenable defenses" while
preserving genuine disputes for proper resolution through the trial process.
Legal Authorities
Rivera v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., 262 S.W.3d 834 (Tex. App. 2008)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Countrywide, Landsafe, and Burchett moved for traditional and no-evidence
summary judgments. See TEX.R. CIV. P. 166a(c) and (i). Burchett moved for
traditional summary judgment on the grounds that (i) limitations barred the
Riveras' common law claims and (ii) Burchett made no false representation.
Burchett also moved for no-evidence summary judgment on the ground the
Riveras had not sustained any damages. Countrywide and Landsafe jointly
moved for traditional summary judgment on the grounds the statute of
limitations barred the Riveras' common law claims as well as the two claims
against Countrywide and for a no-evidence summary judgment on the
ground the Riveras had not sustained any damages. The trial judge granted
Countrywide and Landsafe's traditional and no-evidence motions for
summary judgment and granted Burchett's motion for summary judgment 'in
its entirety.'
Summary
The passage provides insight into how summary judgments are applied
under Texas law, specifically referencing the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure
166a(c) and (i). It illustrates the grounds on which traditional and no-
evidence summary judgments can be sought, such as statute of limitations
and lack of evidence for damages. The case demonstrates the application of
these rules in a real-world scenario, showing how the court evaluates and
grants summary judgments based on the presented grounds.
Cade v. Stone, NUMBER 13-12-00630-CV (Tex. App. Jun 13, 2013)
Texas Court of Appeals

=== PAGE 10 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
Because Cade established his entitlement to judgment as a matter of law
and Stone did not, the trial court should have rendered summary judgment
in Cade's favor. We therefore reverse the judgment of the trial court and
render judgment, as requested by Cade, that the domesticated 1993
judgment is revived.
Summary
A summary judgment in Texas is rendered when one party establishes their
entitlement to judgment as a matter of law, and the opposing party fails to
do so. In this case, Cade was entitled to summary judgment because he
established his legal right to the judgment, and Stone did not present a valid
defense. The court reversed the trial court's decision and rendered summary
judgment in favor of Cade, reviving the domesticated judgment.
Martinez v. Martinez, NUMBER 13-19-00518-CV (Tex. App. Oct 01, 2020)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
In a traditional motion for summary judgment, the movant has the burden of
showing no genuine issue of material fact exists and that it is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law. TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(c); Katy Venture, 469 S.W.
3d at 163. Evidence raises a genuine issue of material fact if reasonable and
fair-minded jurors could differ in their conclusions in light of all the evidence
presented. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. v. Mayes, 236 S.W.3d 754, 755 (Tex.
2007) (per curiam). Once the moving party produces evidence establishing
its right to summary judgment as a matter of law, the burden shifts to the
nonmovant to produce evidence that raises a genuine issue of material fact.
Walker v. Harris, 924 S.W.2d 375, 376 (Tex. 1996). To determine if the
nonmovant raised a fact issue, we review the evidence in the light most
favorable to the nonmovant, crediting favorable evidence if reasonable
jurors could do so, and disregarding contrary evidence unless reasonable
jurors could not. Hawthorne v. Guenther, 461 S.W.3d 218, 221 (Tex. App.—
San Antonio 2015, pet. denied). The function of a summary judgment is not
to deprive a litigant of the right to a full hearing on the merits of any real
issue, but to eliminate patently unmeritorious claims and untenable
defenses.
Summary
Detailed explanation of the process and standards for granting a summary
judgment in Texas. It outlines the burden of proof on the movant, the role of
the nonmovant, and the purpose of summary judgment in the legal process.
This information is applicable to any case involving summary judgment in
Texas.

Casso v. Brand, 776 S.W.2d 551 (Tex. 1989)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
Rule 166a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure provides that summary
judgment 'shall be rendered forthwith if ... the moving party is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law on the issues expressly set out in the motion or
in an answer or any other response.' (Emphasis added.) Thus, all theories in
support of a summary judgment, as well as all opposing issues, must be
presented in writing to the court at the hearing.
Summary
Direct reference to Rule 166a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, which
outlines the conditions under which a summary judgment can be granted. It
emphasizes that the moving party must be entitled to judgment as a matter
of law based on the issues explicitly set out in the motion or response. This
is a general rule applicable to summary judgment procedures in Texas.
Madison v. Williamson, 241 S.W.3d 145 (Tex. App. 2007)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 166a(i) provides: After adequate time for
discovery, a party without presenting summary judgment evidence may
move for summary judgment on the ground that there is no evidence of one
or more essential elements of a claim or defense on which an adverse party
would have the burden of proof at trial. The motion must state the elements
as to which there is no evidence. The court must grant the motion unless the
respondent produces summary judgment evidence raising a genuine issue of
material fact.
Summary
Direct definition and application of a no-evidence summary judgment under
Texas law. It explains that after adequate time for discovery, a party can
move for summary judgment if there is no evidence of essential elements of
a claim or defense. The court is required to grant the motion unless the
opposing party presents evidence that raises a genuine issue of material
fact. This is a general rule applicable to civil cases in Texas.

Summary
Definition and application of summary judgment under Texas law,

disproving at least one element of the plaintiff's causes of action or by
conclusively establishing all elements of an affirmative defense. This

Summary
Clear definition and application of summary judgment under Texas law. It
explains that a party moving for a traditional summary judgment must prove
that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that they are entitled to
judgment as a matter of law. This is in accordance with Texas Rule of Civil
Procedure 166a(c). Additionally, it states that a defendant can achieve

App. Jul 14, 2020)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
A party seeking summary judgment may combine in a single motion a
request for summary judgment under the traditional and no-evidence
standards. Binur v. Jacobo, 135 S.W.3d 646, 650-51 (Tex. 2004); see also
TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(c), (i). When a party has sought summary judgment on
both grounds and the trial court's order does not specify its reasons for
granting summary judgment, we first review the propriety of the summary
judgment under the no-evidence standard. See Ford Motor Co. v. Ridgway,
135 S.W.3d 598, 600 (Tex. 2004); see also TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(i). ... In a
traditional summary-judgment motion, the movant has the burden to show
that no genuine issue of material fact exists and the trial court should grant
judgment as a matter of law. See TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(c); KPMG Peat
Marwick v. Harrison Cty. Hous. Fin. Corp., 988 S.W.2d 746, 748 (Tex. 1999).

must conclusively prove all essential elements of its cause of action. Rhône-
Poulenc, Inc. v. Steel, 997 S.W.2d 217, 223 (Tex. 1999).
Summary
Clear explanation of how summary judgment is defined and applied under
Texas law. It describes the two standards for summary judgment: traditional
and no-evidence. Under the traditional standard, the movant must show that
there is no genuine issue of material fact and that they are entitled to
judgment as a matter of law. Under the no-evidence standard, the court first
reviews the propriety of the summary judgment when the order does not
specify reasons. This information is applicable to any case involving
summary judgment in Texas.
Walker v. Harris, 924 S.W.2d 375 (Tex. 1996)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
To obtain a summary judgment, a defendant must either negate at least one
element of the plaintiff's theory of recovery, 'Moore' Burger, Inc. v. Phillips
Petroleum Co., 492 S.W.2d 934, 936 (Tex.1972), or plead and conclusively
prove each element of an affirmative defense. City of Houston v. Clear Creek
Basin Auth., 589 S.W.2d 671, 678 (Tex.1979). After the defendant produces
evidence entitling it to summary judgment, the burden shifts to the plaintiff
to present evidence creating a fact issue. 'Moore' Burger, 492 S.W.2d at
936-37. We take all evidence favorable to the nonmovant as true and indulge
every reasonable inference in the nonmovant's favor. Nixon v. Mr. Property
Management Co., 690 S.W.2d 546, 549 (Tex.1985).
Summary
The passage from the Walker v. Harris case provides a clear explanation of
how summary judgment is defined and applied under Texas law. It outlines
the requirements for a defendant to obtain a summary judgment, which
include negating an element of the plaintiff's case or proving an affirmative
defense. It also describes the burden-shifting process, where the plaintiff
must then present evidence to create a fact issue. The passage further
explains the standard of review, which involves taking all evidence favorable
to the nonmovant as true and making reasonable inferences in their favor.
This information is applicable to any case involving summary judgment in
Texas, making it generally applicable.

Summary
Detailed explanation of how summary judgments are reviewed and applied
under Texas law. It explains that summary judgments are reviewed de novo,
meaning the appellate court considers the matter anew, as if no decision had
been previously made. The evidence is reviewed in the light most favorable
to the non-moving party. The burden is on the party moving for summary
judgment to demonstrate that there is no genuine issue of material fact and
that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law. This is in accordance
with Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 166a(c). The passage also explains the
procedure when both parties file for summary judgment, indicating that the

Extract
The standards for reviewing a motion for summary judgment are well
established. As mandated by this court, they are: 1. The movant for
summary judgment has the burden of showing that there is no genuine issue
of material fact and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. 2. In
deciding whether there is a disputed material fact issue precluding summary
judgment, evidence favorable to the non-movant will be taken as true. 3.
Every reasonable inference must be indulged in favor of the non-movant and
any doubts resolved in its favor.
Summary
Clear definition and application of summary judgment under Texas law. It
outlines the standards for reviewing a motion for summary judgment,
emphasizing the burden on the movant to show no genuine issue of material
fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. It also highlights the
approach of taking evidence favorable to the non-movant as true and
resolving doubts in favor of the non-movant. This is a general principle
applicable to summary judgment procedures in Texas.

Texas Supreme Court
Extract
The one exception in which both standards do not expressly appear is in the
scope of review for summary judgments. Here, there is only one standard —
a reviewing court must examine the entire record in the light most favorable
to the nonmovant, indulging every reasonable inference and resolving any
doubts against the motion. Reviewing courts do not disregard the evidence
supporting the motion; if they did, all summary judgments would be
reversed. In practice, however, a different scope of review applies when a
summary judgment motion is filed without supporting evidence. In such
cases, evidence supporting the motion is effectively disregarded because
there is none; under the rule, it is not allowed. Thus, although a reviewing
court must consider all the summary judgment evidence on file, in some
cases that review will effectively be restricted to the evidence contrary to
the motion.
Summary
The passage from the City of Keller v. Wilson case provides insight into how
summary judgments are reviewed under Texas law. It specifies that the
standard for reviewing summary judgments is to examine the entire record
in the light most favorable to the nonmovant, indulging every reasonable
inference and resolving any doubts against the motion. This indicates that
the court must consider all evidence on file, but if a motion is filed without

supporting evidence, the review is effectively limited to the evidence
contrary to the motion. This standard is generally applicable to summary
judgment reviews in Texas.
Maxwell v. Maxwell, 292 S.W.2d 368 (Tex. Ct. App. 1956)
Texas Civil Court of Appeals
Extract
The purpose of Rule 166-A, Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, providing for
summary judgment is to expedite the final determination of a case where
there are no material issues of fact. If, upon a consideration of the affidavits
and other proof offered, there are no disputed facts, summary judgment is in
order. ... The purpose of summary judgment procedure is that the court may
look through and beyond the pleadings and even though a petition may state
a cause of action, nevertheless if, on a motion for summary judgment, proof
fails to show any genuine issue regarding a material fact, then the granting
of summary judgment is proper. ... In a hearing on the motion for summary
judgment the function of the trial court is to determine if any genuine issues
of material facts exist.
Summary
Clear definition and application of summary judgment under Texas law. It
explains that the purpose of summary judgment is to expedite the resolution
of cases where no material factual disputes exist. The court's role is to
determine if any genuine issues of material fact are present. If none exist,
summary judgment is appropriate. This is a general principle applicable to
all cases in Texas where summary judgment is sought.

The distinction between a traditional and a no-evidence summary judgment
is critical. The burden on a movant seeking summary judgment on
traditional grounds is great. The movant must conclusively establish that no
genuine issue of material fact exists and that the movant is, therefore,
entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(c). A summary
judgment motion must stand on its own merits. City of Houston v. Clear
Creek Basin Auth., 589 S.W.2d 671, 678 (Tex. 1979). Even in the absence of
a response from the nonmovant, in order to be entitled to judgment, 'the
movant still must establish his entitlement to a summary judgment on the
issues expressly presented to the trial court by conclusively proving all
essential elements of his cause of action or defense as a matter of law.'

Extract
The standard of review for traditional summary judgment under Tex.R.Civ.P.
166a(c) is well established. Nixon v. Mr. Property Management Company,
Inc., 690 S.W.2d 546, 548 (Tex.1985). The moving party carries the burden
of showing there is no genuine issue of material fact and it is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law. Diversicare General Partner, Inc. v. Rubio, 185
S.W.3d 842, 846 (Tex.2005); Browning v. Prostok, 165 S.W.3d 336, 344 (Tex.

deciding whether there is a disputed issue of material fact. Fort Worth
Osteopathic Hospital, Inc. v. Reese, 148 S.W.3d 94, 99 (Tex.2004). All
reasonable inferences, including any doubts, must be resolved in favor of the
non-movant. Id. A defendant is entitled to summary judgment if the evidence
disproves as a matter of law at least one element of each of the plaintiff's
causes of action or if it conclusively establishes all elements of an
affirmative defense. D. Houston, Inc. v. Love, 92 S.W.3d 450, 454 (Tex.2002);
Randall's Food Markets, Inc. v. Johnson, 891 S.W.2d 640, 644 (Tex.1995).
Once the defendant establishes a right to summary judgment as a matter of
law, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to present evidence raising a genuine
issue of material fact.

Extract
Texas uses summary judgments merely 'to eliminate patently unmeritorious
claims and untenable defenses.' Casso v. Brand, 776 S.W.2d 551, 556 (Tex.
1989). In reviewing a traditional motion for summary judgment, this court
must apply the standards established in Nixon v. Mr. Property Management
Company, 690 S.W.2d 546, 548-49 (Tex.1985), which are as follows: (1) The
movant for summary judgment has the burden of showing that there is no
genuine issue of material fact and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter
of law; (2) Evidence favorable to the non-movant will be taken as true in
deciding whether there is a disputed material fact issue precluding summary
judgment; and (3) Every reasonable inference must be indulged in favor of
the non-movant and any doubts resolved in its favor. See id. A defendant
who negates at least one essential element of a cause of action or proves all
essential elements of an affirmative defense is entitled to summary judgment
as to that cause of action. See Randall's Food Mkts., Inc. v. Johnson, 891
S.W.2d 640, 644 (Tex.1995). Because the burden of proof is on the movant,
and all doubts about the existence of a genuine issue of a material fact are
resolved against the movant, we must view the evidence and its reasonable
inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmovant. See Great Am.
Reserve Ins. Co. v. San Antonio Plumbing Supply Co., 391 S.W.2d 41, 47
(Tex.1965). In a no-evidence summary judgment, a party is entitled to
summary judgment if there is no evidence of one or more essential elements
of a claim or defense on which an adverse party would have the burden of
proof at trial. Tex.R. Civ. P. 166a(i). We view the evidence in the light most
favorable to the nonmovant, disregarding all contrary evidence and
inferences. King Ranch, Inc. v. Chapman, 118 S.W.3d 742, 751 (Tex.2003),
cert. denied, 541 U.S. 1030, 124 S.Ct. 2097, 158 L.Ed.2d 711 (2004). In
reviewing a no-evidence summary judgment, we apply the same legal
sufficiency standard we apply in reviewing a directed verdict. Id. at 750-51.
A no-evidence summary judgment is improperly granted if the nonmovant
brings forth more than a scintilla of probative evidence to raise a genuine
issue of material fact. Id. at 751. More than a scintilla of evidence exists
when the evidence rises to a level that would enable reasonable and fair-
minded people to differ in their conclusions. Id. If the movant's motion and
summary judgment proof facially establish its right to judgment as a matter
of law, the burden shifts to the nonmovant to raise a material fact issue
sufficient to defeat summary judgment. Dolcefino v. Randolph, 19 S.W.3d
906, 917 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2000, pet. denied). If the issue
raised is based upon undisputed and unambiguous facts, then the reviewing
court may determine the question presented as a matter of law.
Summary
Detailed explanation of how summary judgments are defined and applied
under Texas law. It outlines the standards for traditional and no-evidence
summary judgments, the burden of proof, and how evidence is viewed in
favor of the non-movant. This information is applicable to any case involving
summary judgment in Texas.

evidence of one or more essential elements of a claim or defense on which
an adverse party would have the burden of proof at trial. Tex. R. Civ. P.
166a(a),(b),(i). A no-evidence summary judgment is essentially a pretrial
directed verdict, and we apply the same legal sufficiency standard in
reviewing a no-evidence summary judgment as we apply in reviewing a

a no-evidence motion, a party must conclusively establish the absence of any
genuine issue of material fact and that the party is entitled to judgment as a
matter of law. Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(c).

Extract
The summary-judgment movant must conclusively establish its right to
judgment as a matter of law. See MMP, Ltd. v. Jones, 710 S.W.2d 59, 60 (Tex.
1986). Because summary judgment is a question of law, we review a trial
court's summary judgment decision de novo. Mann Frankfort Stein & Lipp
Advisors, Inc. v. Fielding, 289 S.W.3d 844, 848 (Tex.2009). To prevail on a
traditional summary-judgment motion, asserted under Rule 166a(c), a
movant must prove that there is no genuine issue regarding any material
fact and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. SeeTex.R. Civ. P.
166a(c); Little v. Tex. Dep't of Criminal Justice, 148 S.W.3d 374, 381 (Tex.
2004). A matter is conclusively established if reasonable people could not
differ as to the conclusion to be drawn from the evidence. See City of Keller
v. Wilson, 168 S.W.3d 802, 816 (Tex.2005). When a party moves for summary
judgment on a claim for which it bears the burden of proof, it must show
that it is entitled to prevail on each element of its cause of action. See
Parker v. Dodge, 98 S.W.3d 297, 299 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2003, no
pet.). The party meets this burden if it produces evidence that would be
sufficient to support an instructed verdict at trial. Id. When a party moves
for summary judgment on a claim for which it does not bear the burden of
proof, it must establish as a matter of law that there is no genuine issue of
fact as to one or more of the essential elements of the nonmovant's claim.

Summary
Detailed explanation of the requirements and standards for summary
judgment under Texas law. It explains that a movant must conclusively
establish its right to judgment as a matter of law, and that summary
judgment is reviewed de novo. It also outlines the requirements for both

To obtain a summary judgment, the movant has the burden of showing that
there is no genuine issue of material fact and that he is entitled to judgment
as a matter of law. TEX.R. CIV. P. 166a(c). When both parties move for
summary judgment, each party must carry his own burden of establishing a
right to judgment. Neither can prevail solely because the other party failed
to discharge his burden. Gonzalez v. State Bar of Texas, 904 S.W.2d 823, 825
(Tex.App.--San Antonio 1995, writ denied). When counter motions for
summary judgment are properly before the trial court at the time judgment
is rendered, all the evidence accompanying both motions should be
considered in deciding whether to grant either party's motion. Id. As both
parties were movants below, we must indulge all reasonable inferences and
resolve all doubts in favor of the losing party.
Summary
Clear definition and application of summary judgment under Texas law, as
outlined in the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure and supported by case law. It

judgment and the process when both parties file for summary judgment.

meet its burden under the no-evidence motion, there is no need to address
the challenge to the traditional motion as it necessarily fails.' Id. at 219. To
be entitled to traditional summary judgment, a movant must establish there
is no genuine issue of material fact so that the movant is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law. Tex.R.Civ.P. 166a(c); Painter v. Amerimex
Drilling I, Ltd., 561 S.W.3d 125, 130 (Tex. 2018). A defendant who
conclusively negates a single essential element of a cause of action or

Either party may move for summary judgment under rule 166a of the Texas
Rules of Civil Procedure. When both parties move for summary judgment,
each party must carry its own burden, and neither can prevail because of
the failure of the other to discharge its burden. ... The Texas Supreme Court

trial by deposition or a trial by affidavit but to provide a method of
summarily terminating a case when it clearly appears that only a question of
law is involved and that no genuine issue of material fact remains. Gaines v.
Hamman, 163 Tex. 618, 626, 358 S.W.2d 557, 563 (1962). Under rule 166a

The passage explains the purpose of summary judgment, which is to
eliminate claims or defenses that are clearly without merit. It outlines the
standards for granting summary judgment, emphasizing that the movant
must demonstrate the absence of any genuine issue of material fact and

Summary
Under Texas law, for a party to be entitled to summary judgment, they must
conclusively prove all essential elements of their claim. The movant has the
burden to demonstrate that there are no genuine issues of material fact and
that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The court must take
evidence favorable to the nonmovant as true, indulge every reasonable
inference in favor of the nonmovant, and resolve any doubts in their favor.
This establishes a high standard for granting summary judgment, ensuring
that it is only awarded when there is no real dispute over the material facts
of the case.
Gibbs v. General Motors Corp., 450 S.W.2d 827 (Tex. 1970)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
The two quotations illustrate a basic fallacy frequently found in the
approach of some of our courts to the matter of rendering or affirming a
summary judgment in favor of a defendant. In such cases, the question on
appeal, as well as in the trial court, is Not whether the summary judgment
proof Raises fact issues with reference to the essential elements of a
plaintiff's claim or cause of action, but is whether the summary judgment
proof Establishes as a matter of law that there is no genuine issue of fact as
to one or more of the essential elements of the plaintiff's cause of action.
The last sentence of paragraph (c) of Rule 166--A, Texas Rules of Civil
Procedure, governs. It provides: 'The judgment sought shall be rendered
forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, and admissions on file, together with
the affidavits, if any, Show that, except as to the amount of damages, There
is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is
entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.' The provisions of Rule 166--A are
applicable alike to defendants and plaintiffs who move for summary
judgment; the judgment sought should be granted, and if granted should be
affirmed, Only if the summary judgment record establishes a right thereto as
a matter of law.
Summary
Summary judgment should only be granted if the record establishes a right
to judgment as a matter of law.

one element of the plaintiff's claims as a matter of law, summary judgment is
appropriate. Doe v. Boys Clubs of Greater Dallas, Inc., 907 S.W.2d 472, 477
(Tex.1995). To obtain summary judgment based on an affirmative defense,

This is a summary judgment case; and in answering the above question, we
must follow certain rules laid down by this Court. Rule 166-A, Texas Rules of
Civil Procedure, provides that summary judgment shall be rendered if it is
shown that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the
moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. The burden of
proof is on the movant, and all doubts as to the existence of a genuine issue
as to a material fact are resolved against him. Tigner v. First Nat'l Bank, 153
Tex. 69, 264 S.W.2d 85 (1954); Gulbenkian v. Penn, 151 Tex. 412, 252 S.W.2d
929 (1952). In other words, the evidence must be viewed in the light most
favorable to the party opposing the motion.
Summary
A summary judgment in Texas is defined by Rule 166-A of the Texas Rules of
Civil Procedure. It is applicable when there is no genuine issue of material
fact, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The
burden of proof lies with the movant, and any doubts regarding material
facts are resolved against the movant. The evidence must be viewed in the
light most favorable to the non-moving party.

Extract
We must decide whether the evidence offered by plaintiffs in response to the
defendant's Rule 166a(i) summary judgment motion created a genuine issue
of material fact that a manufacturing defect in the defendant's product
caused the plaintiffs injuries. ... We first review the trial court's summary
judgment under the standards of Rule 166a(i). The non-movants, here the
plaintiffs, must produce summary judgment evidence raising a genuine issue
of material fact to defeat the summary judgment under that provision. Tex.R.
Civ. P. 166a(i). A genuine issue of material fact exists if more than a scintilla
of evidence establishing the existence of the challenged element is
produced. ... When determining if more than a scintilla of evidence has been
produced in response to a Rule 166a(i) motion for summary judgment, the
evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-movant.

Clear explanation of how summary judgment is defined and applied under
Texas law, particularly under Rule 166a(i). It explains the burden on the non-
movant to produce more than a scintilla of evidence to raise a genuine issue

essential elements of the plaintiff's cause of action is therefore entitled to
summary judgment. See Rodriguez v. Naylor Industries, Inc., 763 S.W.2d

Extract
Rule 166a provides a method of summarily terminating a case when it
clearly appears that only a question of law is involved and that there is no
genuine fact issue. See Swilley v. Hughes, 488 S.W.2d 64, 68 (Tex. 1972).
The party moving for summary judgment carries the burden of establishing
that no material fact issue exists and that it is entitled to judgment as a
matter of law. See TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(c); Wornick Co. v. Casas, 856 S.W.2d
732, 733 (Tex. 1993); Nixon v. Mr. Property Mgt. Co., 690 S.W.2d 546, 548
(Tex. 1985); Cavillo v. Gonzalez, 922 S.W.2d 928, 929 (Tex. 1966). The
nonmovant has no burden to respond to a summary judgment motion unless
the movant conclusively establishes its cause of action or defense. See Oram
v. General Am. Oil Co., 513 S.W.2d 533, 534 (Tex. 1974); Swilley, 488 S.W.2d

outlined in Rule 166a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. It explains the
burden of proof required for the movant and the conditions under which a
summary judgment can be granted. The passage is from a Texas Supreme
Court case, which makes it authoritative and generally applicable to similar
cases in Texas.
Binur v. Jacobo, 135 S.W.3d 646 (Tex. 2004)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 166a does not prohibit a party from combining
in a single motion a request for summary judgment that utilizes the
procedures under either subsection (a) or (b), with a request for summary
judgment that utilizes subsection (i) and asserts that there is 'no evidence of
one or more essential elements of a claim or defense.' The fact that evidence
may be attached to a motion that proceeds under subsection (a) or (b) does
not foreclose a party from also asserting that there is no evidence with
regard to a particular element. Similarly, Sif a motion brought solely under
subsection (i) attaches evidence, that evidence should not be considered
unless it creates a fact question, but such a motion should not be
disregarded or treated as a motion under subsection (a) or (b). We
disapprove of decisions that hold or imply that, if a party attaches evidence
to a motion for summary judgment, any request for summary judgment
under Rule 166a(i) will be disregarded. Some Texas courts have declared
that when a party seeks summary judgment under subsection (a) or (b), and
also under subsection (i), the better practice is to file two separate motions,
or at least to include headings that clearly delineate and segregate the part
of a motion relying on subsection (a) or (b) from the part that relies on
subsection (i). We agree that using headings to clearly delineate the basis
for summary judgment under subsection (a) or (b) from the basis for
summary judgment under subsection (i) would be helpful to the bench and
bar, but the rule does not require it. If a motion clearly sets forth its grounds
and otherwise meets Rule 166a's requirements, it is sufficient. Here, Binur's
motion for summary judgment asserted that there was no evidence of
proximate cause. The court of appeals erred in concluding that this ground
could be disregarded because evidence was attached to the motion.

Summary
The passage provides insight into how summary judgments are defined and
applied under Texas law, specifically under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure
166a. It clarifies that a party can combine requests for summary judgment
under different subsections (a, b, and i) in a single motion. It also
emphasizes that attaching evidence to a motion under subsection (i) does
not automatically convert it to a motion under subsections (a) or (b). The
passage further suggests that while it is helpful to separate the bases for
summary judgment using headings, it is not a requirement as long as the
motion meets the rule's requirements. This guidance is applicable to all
cases involving summary judgment motions in Texas.

Summary
Definition and application of summary judgment under Texas law. It explains
that under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 166a(c), a summary judgment is
appropriate when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving
party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. It further clarifies that a
defendant can obtain summary judgment by conclusively negating an
essential element of the plaintiff's cause of action. The passage also outlines
the standard of review for summary judgment motions, emphasizing that the
court must view the nonmovant's evidence in the most favorable light.

Of course, summary judgment for a defendant is proper only when the
defendant negates at least one element of each of the plaintiff's theories of
recovery, Gibbs v. General Motors Corp., 450 S.W.2d 827, 828 (Tex.1970), or
pleads and conclusively establishes each element of an affirmative defense.

When reviewing a summary judgment, we take as true all evidence favorable
to the nonmovant and indulge every reasonable inference in the
nonmovant's favor. Nixon v. Mr. Property Management Co., 690 S.W.2d 546,

present the grounds upon which it is made, and must stand or fall on these
grounds alone. McConnell v. Southside Indep. Sch. Dist., 858 S.W.2d 337,
341 (Tex.1993); see TEX.R.CIV.P. 166a(c) ('The motion for summary
judgment shall state the specific grounds therefor.'). In other words, in
determining whether grounds are expressly presented, we may not rely on
briefs or summary judgment evidence. See McConnell, 858 S.W.2d at 341.
Summary
Definition and application of summary judgment under Texas law. It explains
that a summary judgment for a defendant is appropriate when the defendant
either negates an element of the plaintiff's claim or establishes an
affirmative defense. The passage also outlines the procedural requirement
that a motion for summary judgment must clearly state its grounds, and
these grounds must be the basis for the court's decision. The passage
further emphasizes that all evidence favorable to the nonmovant should be
considered true, and reasonable inferences should be made in their favor.

Extract
The standard for reviewing a summary judgment under Texas Rule of Civil
Procedure 166a(c) is whether the successful movant at the trial level carried
its burden of showing that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that
judgment should be granted as a matter of law. In conducting our review, we
take as true all evidence favorable to the nonmovant, and we make all
reasonable inferences in the nonmovant's favor. A defendant moving for
summary judgment on the affirmative defense of limitations has the burden
to conclusively establish that defense. Thus, the defendant must (1)
conclusively prove when the cause of action accrued, and (2) negate the
discovery rule, if it applies and has been pleaded or otherwise raised, by
proving as a matter of law that there is no genuine issue of material fact
about when the plaintiff discovered, or in the exercise of reasonable

diligence should have discovered the nature of its injury. If the movant
establishes that the statute of limitations bars the action, the nonmovant
must then adduce summary judgment proof raising a fact issue in avoidance
of the statute of limitations.
Summary
Detailed explanation of the standard for reviewing a summary judgment
under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 166a(c). It outlines the burden of proof
on the movant to show no genuine issue of material fact exists and that
judgment should be granted as a matter of law. It also explains the specific
requirements for a defendant moving for summary judgment on the
affirmative defense of limitations, including proving when the cause of
action accrued and negating the discovery rule if applicable. This
information is crucial for understanding how summary judgments are
defined and applied in Texas.

To be entitled to summary judgment, Lear Siegler had the burden to
establish that there existed no genuine issue of fact thereby entitling it to

Summary
Clear definition and application of summary judgment under Texas law. It
states that the party seeking summary judgment (the movant) must
demonstrate that there is no genuine issue of material fact, which would
entitle them to judgment as a matter of law. Additionally, it emphasizes that
any doubts should be resolved against the movant, and the evidence should

Gonzalez v. State Bar of Texas, 904 S.W.2d 823 (Tex. App. 1995)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Where both parties move for summary judgment, each party must carry his
own burden of establishing a right to judgment. Neither can prevail solely
because the other party failed to discharge his burden. ... When counter
motions for summary judgment are properly before the trial court at the
time judgment is rendered, all the evidence accompanying both motions
should be considered in deciding whether to grant either party's motion. ...
On appeal, where the only question presented is one of law, the proper
course is for this court to render judgment for the party whose summary
judgment motion should have been granted if either motion should have
been granted.
Summary
The passage provides insight into the procedural aspects of summary
judgment under Texas law. It explains that when both parties file for
summary judgment, each must independently establish their right to
judgment. The court must consider all evidence from both parties' motions.
If the case is purely a question of law, the appellate court can render
judgment for the party whose motion should have been granted. This
information is applicable to any case involving summary judgment in Texas.

=== PAGE 39 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
The trial court granted the motion for summary judgment. The court of
appeals affirmed without reaching the merits of the conspiracy claim. The
court of appeals reasoned that Brewer & Pritchard's response to the no
evidence motion for summary judgment did not tie facts in the record to the
specific elements of the conspiracy claim. Brewer & Pritchard challenges
the disposition of the conspiracy claim in its petition for review. We first
consider whether Brewer & Pritchard's response to the no evidence motion
for summary judgment met the requirement of Rule 166a(i) that evidence
must be produced 'raising a genuine issue of material fact.' ... (i) No-
Evidence Motion. After adequate time for discovery, a party without
presenting summary judgment evidence may move for summary judgment
on the ground that there is no evidence of one or more essential elements of
a claim or defense on which an adverse party would have the burden of
proof at trial. The motion must state the elements as to which there is no
evidence. The court must grant the motion unless the respondent produces
summary judgment evidence raising a genuine issue of material fact. This
Court's comment to Rule 166a explains that a respondent to a motion under
paragraph (i) need not marshal evidence, but may point out evidence that
raises a fact issue on the challenged elements: This comment is intended to
inform the construction and application of the rule.... To defeat a motion
made under paragraph (i), the respondent is not required to marshal its
proof; its response need only point out evidence that raises a fact issue on
the challenged elements. The existing rules continue to govern the general
requirements of summary judgment practice. A motion under paragraph (i)
is subject to sanctions provided by existing law (Tex Civ. Prac. & Rem.Code
§§ 9.001-10.006) and rules (Tex.R.Civ.P. 13).
Summary
Detailed explanation of how a no-evidence motion for summary judgment is
defined and applied under Texas law, specifically under Rule 166a(i). It
explains that after adequate time for discovery, a party can move for
summary judgment on the basis that there is no evidence for one or more
essential elements of a claim or defense. The court must grant the motion
unless the respondent can produce evidence raising a genuine issue of
material fact. The passage also clarifies that the respondent does not need
to marshal all evidence but must point out evidence that raises a fact issue
on the challenged elements.

the plaintiff's causes of action to prevail on summary judgment. See Science
Spectrum, Inc. v. Martinez, 941 S.W.2d 910,911 (Tex. 1997).
Summary
Clear definition and application of summary judgment under Texas law. It
states that a party seeking summary judgment must conclusively prove all
elements of its cause of action or defense as a matter of law. Additionally, if
the defendant is the movant, they must disprove at least one essential

Because King Ranch's summary judgment motion was, in part, a no-evidence
motion, we consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-
movant. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Rodriguez, 92 S.W.3d 502, 506 (Tex.2002);

we apply the same legal sufficiency standard in reviewing a no-evidence
summary judgment as we apply in reviewing a directed verdict.
Summary
The passage provides insight into the application of no-evidence summary
judgments under Texas law. It explains that a no-evidence summary
judgment is akin to a pretrial directed verdict, and the same legal sufficiency
standard is applied in reviewing both. This indicates that in Texas, when a
party files a no-evidence summary judgment motion, the court must view the
evidence in the light most favorable to the non-movant, similar to how it
would approach a directed verdict.

Tex.Sup.Ct.J. 7 (Tex. 1979)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
A history of the summary judgment rule, rule 166-A, reflects that the high
hopes of increasing judicial efficiency advanced by the proponents of the
rule did not materialize... The trial court may not grant a summary judgment
by default for lack of an answer or response to the motion by the non-
movant when the movant's summary judgment proof is legally insufficient.
The movant still must establish his entitlement to a summary judgment on
the issues expressly presented to the trial court by conclusively proving all
essential elements of his cause of action or defense as a matter of law...
Summary judgments must stand on their own merits, and the non-movant's
failure to answer or respond cannot supply by default the summary
judgment proof necessary to establish the movant's right.
Summary
The passage provides insight into the procedural aspects of summary
judgments in Texas. It highlights that under Rule 166-A, a summary
judgment cannot be granted by default due to a lack of response from the
non-movant if the movant's proof is insufficient. The movant must
conclusively prove all essential elements of their case or defense to be
entitled to a summary judgment. This ensures that summary judgments are
based on the merits of the case rather than procedural defaults.

In addition, the following requirements shall also apply: The administrative
law judge shall hear oral argument on all motions for summary judgment
unless the judge expressly waives this requirement. Before filing the motion,
the party moving for summary judgment, in consultation with the
administrative law judge's clerk, must schedule the motion for submission
on oral argument at least 21 days after the date on which it is filed. If there
is an applicable statutory deadline by which the agency must hold a hearing,
the submission date must be within the deadline unless it has been waived
by both parties. The party moving for summary judgment must serve on all
opposing parties, with a copy of the motion for summary judgment, a notice
containing the following information: (A) the time, date, and place when the
administrative law judge will hear oral argument on the motion; (B)
disclosure that any party opposing the motion must file affidavits, other
written material, and any cross-claims or counterclaims, with the
administrative law judge by the close of business seven days before the date
of submission on oral argument; (C) disclosure that the administrative law
judge may take the allegations in the motion as true unless contested by
opposing parties through affidavits or other written material; and (D)
disclosure that the administrative law judge will not hear any oral testimony
related to the motion.

Detailed procedure for filing a motion for summary disposition in the context
of contested case hearings under the Texas Commission on Environmental
Quality. It outlines the timeline for filing such a motion, the requirements for

within a particular administrative context in Texas.
1 Tex. Admin. Code § 155.505 1 Tex. Admin. Code § 155.505 Summary
Disposition
Extract
Summary disposition shall be granted on all or part of a contested case if the
pleadings, the motion for summary disposition, and the summary disposition
evidence show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that
the moving party is entitled to a decision in its favor as a matter of law on all
or some of the issues expressly set out in the motion. Summary disposition is
not permitted based on the ground that there is no evidence of one or more
essential elements of a claim or defense on which the opposing party would
have the burden of proof at hearing.
Summary
The Texas Administrative Code provides a framework for summary
disposition in contested cases. Summary disposition is similar to summary
judgment in that it allows for a decision without a full evidentiary hearing if
there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law. However, it cannot be granted solely on the
basis that there is no evidence for essential elements of a claim or defense
that the opposing party would need to prove at a hearing. This indicates that
summary disposition is a procedural tool used to expedite cases where the
facts are undisputed and the law clearly favors one party.

For purposes of a no-evidence motion for summary judgment filed by a party
to an appeal under this chapter, the offer of evidence, including an affidavit
or testimony, by any person, including the appraisal district, the property
owner, or the owner's agent, that was presented at the hearing on the
protest before the appraisal review board constitutes sufficient evidence to
deny the motion.
Summary
The passage provides specific guidance on the application of a no-evidence
motion for summary judgment in the context of property tax appeals under
Chapter 42 of the Texas Tax Code. It clarifies that evidence presented at a

Extract
The presiding officer, on motion by any party, may grant a motion for
summary decision on any or all issues to the extent that the pleadings,
affidavits, materials obtained by discovery or otherwise, admissions, matters
officially noticed in accordance with § 16 22.222 of this title (relating to
Official Notice), or evidence of record show that there is no genuine issue as
to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a decision in its
favor, as a matter of law, on the issues expressly set forth in the motion.
Summary
A summary decision in the context of the Public Utility Commission of Texas
is similar to a summary judgment in civil court. It allows a presiding officer
to decide a case without a full hearing if there is no genuine issue of
material fact and the moving party is entitled to a decision as a matter of
law. This is applicable specifically to cases under the Public Utility
Commission of Texas, indicating that it may not be generally applicable to all
legal proceedings in Texas.

C. Londa, Lara Cardin de Leon & Laura M. Franze - 2016-07-27
Extract
Summary judgment practice has played an important role in employment
lawsuits filed in Texas federal courts for a number of years. Recently, there
has been an increase in the use of summary judgments in Texas state courts.
This is due to a combination of factors. Prior to 1997, many attorneys
perceived, accurately or not, that it was easier to get summary judgment in
federal court than state court. In 1997, the state summary judgment rule
was amended to conform with the burden of proof under the federal rules
(see §41:2.A.2). Therefore, there may no longer be a significant difference

=== PAGE 52 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
between filing summary judgment in federal court and filing in state court.
The amendment to the state summary judgment rule has made it easier to
file and, arguably, to obtain summary judgment. The process for filing
summary judgment varies from state to federal court, but the grounds are
the same regardless of where the case is filed. Summary judgment is sought
and granted when there are no issues of material fact and the moving party
is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law. TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(a);
FED. R. CIV. P. 56(c).
Summary
Clear definition and application of summary judgment under Texas law. It
explains that summary judgment is used when there are no material facts in
dispute and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. It
also notes the alignment of Texas state rules with federal rules post-1997,
making it easier to file and obtain summary judgment in Texas state courts.

Summary judgment in Texas state courts is governed by Texas Rule of Civil
Procedure 166a. Either party may move for summary judgment, but the
burden... A summary judgment response is not technically required in either
state or federal court. However, failing to file a response will almost
certainly be fatal for the non-movant, especially when the movant files a no-
evidence summary judgment motion.
Summary
The passage provides insight into the procedural aspects of summary
judgment in Texas state courts, specifically under Texas Rule of Civil
Procedure 166a. It highlights that either party can move for summary
judgment and discusses the importance of responding to such motions. The
information is applicable to summary judgment practice in general, not
limited to specific cases.

a defendant can intone “summary judgment” and sit back and watch... While
courts have historically been very sympathetic to summary judgment and

=== PAGE 54 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
permitted even the most basic of motions, more recently some judges have
begun to disfavor it. Such motions require a great deal of time and
resources from a judge, and if he denies the motion he will have to go
through it all again at trial. As a general rule, it is best not to file the motion
unless you have a reasonable chance of prevailing... Summary judgment
motions are time-consuming and expensive. If the motion is denied, you will
have educated the plaintiff on the key issues and facts that you will now
have to argue at trial... The mere existence of some alleged factual dispute
between the parties will not defeat a motion for summary judgment; the
requirement is that there be no genuine issue of material fact... An issue is
‘genuine’ if the evidence is sufficient to persuade a reasonable jury to return
a verdict for the nonmoving party... As to materiality, the substantive law will
identify which facts are material. Factual disputes that are irrelevant or
unnecessary will not be counted.
Summary
Summary judgment is a legal procedure where a party can seek to have a
case decided without a trial if there are no genuine issues of material fact.
The passage highlights that summary judgment motions are often disfavored
by judges due to the resources they require and the potential for educating
the opposing party on key issues. The passage also clarifies that a genuine
issue is one where the evidence could lead a reasonable jury to find in favor
of the nonmoving party, and material facts are those identified by
substantive law as relevant to the case.

Extract
burden in establishing entitlement to summary judgment as a matter of law
is equal to the burden that the movant would face at trial. Where the movant
is the defendant who bears no burden of persuasion at trial on plaintiff’s
claim for relief, defendant is entitled to grant of summary judgment if, as
movant, he establishes the absence of any proof by the nonmovant as to a
necessary element of the nonmovant’s claim. Once the movant makes a
prima facie showing of entitlement to judgment, the burden shifts to the
nonmovant to demonstrate with specific evidence a genuine dispute of
material fact, with the benefit of all reasonable inferences drawn in its favor.
In order for a nonmovant to dispute a fact asserted by the movant, the
nonmovant can do one or more of the following: (1) cite to particular parts of
materials in the record that support the assertion that the movant’s fact is
disputed; (2) show that the materials cited by the movant do not establish
the absence or presence of a genuine dispute; or (3) show that the movant
cannot produce admissible evidence to support the fact.

=== PAGE 55 ===

Summary
Burden of proof required for a party to be entitled to summary judgment,
which is equivalent to the burden at trial. It explains that if the movant
(often the defendant) can show the absence of evidence for a necessary
element of the nonmovant's (often the plaintiff's) claim, they may be granted
summary judgment. The burden then shifts to the nonmovant to show a
genuine dispute of material fact. This process is generally applicable to
summary judgment motions, though the document is focused on
pharmaceutical patent litigation.

Summary judgment provides a method of summarily terminating a case
when it clearly appears that only a question of law is involved and that there
is no genuine fact issue. The party moving for summary judgment carries
the burden of establishing that no material issue of fact exists and that it is
entitled to judgment as a matter of law. [TRCP 166a(c); Nixon v. Mr. Prop.
Mgmt. Co., 690 S.W.2d 546, 548-49 (Tex. 1985).] In resolving the issue of
whether the movant has carried this burden, the reviewing court will take as
true all evidence favorable to the nonmovant and resolve all doubts in the
nonmovant’s favor. [See Williams v. First Tennessee Nat. Corp., 97 S.W.3d
798, 802 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2003, no writ) (citing Lear Siegler, Inc. v. Perez,
819 S.W.2d 470, 471 (Tex.1991)).] Where the defendants are the movants
and they submit summary judgment evidence disproving at least one
essential element of each of the plaintiff’s causes of action, summary
judgment should be granted. Furthermore, where, as here, the trial court’s
order granting summary judgment does not specify the ground or grounds
on which it bases its ruling, summary judgment will be affirmed on appeal if
any of the theories advanced in the motion for summary judgment is
meritorious. [Williams v. First Tennessee Nat. Corp., 97 S.W.3d 798, 802
(Tex. App.—Dallas 2003, no writ).]
Summary
Clear definition and application of summary judgment under Texas law. It
explains that summary judgment is a legal procedure used to terminate a
case when only legal questions are involved, and no genuine issues of
material fact exist. The burden is on the party moving for summary
judgment to prove that no material fact issues exist and that they are
entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The court must view all evidence in
favor of the nonmovant and resolve any doubts in their favor. If the
defendants can disprove at least one essential element of the plaintiff's case,
summary judgment should be granted. The passage also notes that if the
trial court's order does not specify the grounds for granting summary

judgment, it will be upheld on appeal if any of the theories in the motion are
valid.

should begin with the list of the elements of the plaintiff’s claim or the

defendant’s affirmative defense. The standards for reviewing a summary
judgment are well established. It is incumbent upon the movant in a
summary judgment proceeding to demonstrate, through the motion and its
supporting evidence: (1) there is no genuine issue of material fact and (2) he
is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. [Nixon v. Mr. Property
Management Co., 690 S.W.2d 546, 548-549 (Tex. 1985).] No act by a non-
movant can divest the movant of this burden. Even if the non-movant does
not file a response and the motion is uncontroverted, the movant still carries
the burden of proof. [Houston v. Clear Creek Basin Auth., 589 S.W.2d 671,
678 (Tex. 1979).] Furthermore, proof there are no disputed facts does not
automatically entitle the movant to summary judgment. The movant must
still show, under those undisputed facts, Texas law directs judgment in his
favor.

Requirements for a summary judgment, emphasizing the movant's burden to
prove the absence of material factual disputes and entitlement to judgment
as a matter of law. The passage also references specific Texas case law that

Summary judgment is an appropriate method of disposing of cases in which
there are no genuine disputes as to any material fact, thus leaving the case
to be resolved as a matter of law. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The party moving
for summary judgment has the initial burden of demonstrating that there is
no genuine issue of material fact remaining for trial and that it is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317 ;
Sweats Fashions Inc. v. Pannill Knitting Co. Inc., 833 F.2d 1560, 4 U.S.P.Q.2d
1793 (Fed. Cir. 1987). The nonmoving party must be given the benefit of all

evidence showing the existence of a genuine dispute as to a material fact for
trial.
Summary
Process and burden of proof required for summary judgment, which involves
the moving party demonstrating the absence of material fact disputes and
the non-moving party needing to show evidence of such disputes. This is
consistent with the principles applied in Texas law, as Texas follows similar
rules for summary judgment as outlined in the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure.

Extract
Summary judgment is appropriate where the movant shows that there is no
genuine dispute as to any material fact and that it is entitled to judgment as
a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). A party asserting that a fact cannot be or
is genuinely disputed must support its assertion by either citing to particular
parts of materials in the record, or showing that the materials cited do not
establish the absence or presence of a genuine dispute, or that an adverse
party cannot produce admissible evidence to support the fact. Fed.R.Civ.P.
56(c). A movant for summary judgment carries the burden of proof in regard
to its motion. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323-24 . In deciding
the motion, the function of the Board is not to try issues of fact, but to
determine if there are any genuine disputes of material fact to be tried.
Summary
Definition of summary judgment as per the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,
which is relevant because Texas law follows similar principles. It explains
that summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine dispute of
material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The
passage also outlines the burden of proof on the movant and the role of the
court in determining the presence of genuine disputes of material fact.

Summary judgment is an appropriate method of disposing of cases in which
there is no genuine dispute with respect to any material fact, thus allowing
the case to be resolved as a matter of law. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). A party
moving for summary judgment has the burden of demonstrating the absence
of any genuine dispute as to a material fact, and that it is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323;
Sweats Fashions, Inc. v. Pannill Knitting Co. Inc., 833 F.2d 1560, 4 U.S.P.Q.2d
1793, 1796 (Fed. Cir. 1987). A factual dispute is genuine if, on the evidence
of record, a reasonable fact finder could resolve the matter in favor of the
non-moving party. See Opryland USA Inc. v. ... 9, 16 U.S.P.Q.2d 1055, 1056
(Fed. Cir. 1990) ('If there is a real dispute about a material fact or factual
inference, summary judgment is inappropriate; the factual dispute should be
reserved for trial.'). When a moving party's motion for summary judgment is
supported by evidence sufficient to indicate that there is no genuine dispute
as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment, the
burden shifts to the nonmoving party to demonstrate the existence of a
genuine dispute regarding at least one material fact which requires
resolution at trial. Embarcadero Techs., Inc. v. Delphix Corp., 117 U.S.P.Q.2d
1518, 1521 (TTAB 2016). The nonmoving party, however, may not rest on the
mere allegations of its pleadings and assertions, but must designate specific
portions of the record or produce additional evidence showing the existence
of a genuine dispute as to a material fact for trial. See Barmag Barmer
Maschinenfabrik AG v. Murata Machinery, Ltd., 731 F.3d 831, 221 U.S.P.Q.
561, 564 (Fed. Cir. 1984
Summary
Definition and explanation of summary judgment, including the burden of
proof on the moving party and the requirements for the nonmoving party to
demonstrate a genuine dispute of material fact. It references federal rules
and case law, which are applicable in Texas as Texas courts often look to
federal interpretations for guidance on procedural matters like summary
judgment.

Summary
Definition of summary judgment and outlines the burden on the moving
party to demonstrate the absence of any genuine dispute as to a material
fact. It also explains what constitutes a genuine factual dispute. This
information is relevant to understanding how summary judgment is defined

Extract
Summary judgment is an appropriate method of disposing of cases in which
there are no genuine disputes as to any material facts and the moving party
is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). In reviewing a
motion for summary judgment, the evidentiary record and all justifiable
inferences to be drawn from the undisputed facts must be viewed in the
light most favorable to the non-moving party.
Summary
Definition of summary judgment as a legal procedure used to resolve cases
without a trial when there are no genuine disputes over material facts, and
the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. It also describes
the standard of review, which requires viewing the evidence in the light
most favorable to the non-moving party. While this is based on federal rules,
Texas law similarly allows for summary judgment under Texas Rule of Civil
Procedure 166a, which aligns with the federal standard.

demonstrate a genuine dispute of material fact. It references federal rules
and case law, which are generally applicable but not specific to Texas law.
