Question
The Respondent’s motion to recuse was altered by court staff before being
forwarded to the regional judge, with exhibits and affidavits removed, and
hyperlinks deleted. Only after objection was the error partially corrected.
Due process requires that recusal motions be handled according to
established procedures, and that parties have a fair opportunity to present
their claims (Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co., 556 U.S. 868 (2009)).
Tampering with court documents or altering filings can constitute a due
process violation. Altering a recusal motion and failing to transmit the
original to the appropriate judge undermines the fairness of the proceedings
and supports a due process claim under § 1983. # ISSUE #1 –
DEPRIVATION OF PROPERTY WITHOUT DUE PROCESS OF LAW
Amendment XIV Section 1. All persons born or naturalized in the United
States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United
States and of the state wherein they reside. No state shall make or enforce
any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the
United States; nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or
property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its
jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. VIOLATION: On January 16,
2024, James Munford ordered the Respondent to vacate his home, which
also served as his place of business, based on intentionally fabricated claims
raised by the Petitioner, Morgan Michelle Myers. This order was rendered
without a hearing taking place, without any evidence being admitted, and
without the Respondent being able to cross examine his accuser. No
protective order was entered, no emergency situation was shown, and the
case was reset for January 22, 2024, to be heard by the associate judge,
Jeffrey Kaitcer. Section 5. The Congress shall have power to enforce, by
appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article. ISSUE #2 –
SUBSEQUENT ORDERS ARE VOID FOR WANT OF JURISDICITON If an
associate judge in Texas acts without a valid order of referral, they lack
jurisdiction, and actions taken in such circumstances may be considered
ultra vires and outside the protection of judicial immunity. This can support
a claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for injunctive or declaratory relief if the
respondent’s rights were deprived. The Texas Family Code and Government
Code make it unequivocal that an associate judge’s authority to act in a case
is dependent on a valid order of referral from the referring court. The order
of referral is not a mere formality; it is the legal instrument that vests the
associate judge with jurisdiction over the matter (Tex. Fam. Code § 201.006;
Tex. Gov’t. Code § 54A.007; Tex. Gov’t. Code § 54B.007). If an associate
judge acts without such an order, or beyond the scope of the order, they are
acting without jurisdiction. The statutes are clear that the powers of an
associate judge are “contingent upon” and “limited by” the order of referral
(Tex. Fam. Code § 201.007; Tex. Gov’t. Code § 54A.008; Tex. Gov’t. Code §
54A.209). Judicial immunity is a well-established doctrine that shields judges
from liability for judicial acts performed within their jurisdiction, even if
those acts are erroneous, malicious, or in excess of authority (Tobias v. SLP
Brownwood LLC, No. 11-19-00247-CV (Tex. App. Jun 24, 2021); Walker v.
Hartman, 516 S.W.3d 71 (Tex. App. 2017)). However, this immunity is not
absolute. The U.S. Supreme Court and Texas courts have repeatedly held

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
that judicial immunity is overcome in two circumstances: (1) when the
judge’s actions are non-judicial in nature, or (2) when the judge acts in the
clear absence of all jurisdiction (Partain v. Gabert, 13-21-00037-CV (Tex.
App. Aug 26, 2021); West v. Robinson, 486 S.W.3d 669 (Tex. App. 2016);
Twilligear v. Carrell, 148 S.W.3d 502 (Tex. App. 2004)). The “clear absence
of all jurisdiction” standard is met when a judge acts without any legal
authority to do so. In the context of associate judges, acting without a valid
order of referral is acting without jurisdiction, not merely in excess of
authority (Tex. Fam. Code § 201.006; Tex. Gov’t. Code § 54A.007). In the
scenario described, the associate judge allegedly took further actions in the
case without a signed order of referral and summarily denied motions
warning of the petitioner’s alleged scheme. Under Texas law, the absence of
a valid referral order means the associate judge lacked jurisdiction to act in
the case (Tex. Fam. Code § 201.006; Tex. Gov’t. Code § 54A.007). Actions
taken in the clear absence of jurisdiction are not protected by judicial
immunity (Partain v. Gabert, 13-21-00037-CV (Tex. App. Aug 26, 2021); West
v. Robinson, 486 S.W.3d 669 (Tex. App. 2016)). If these actions resulted in
the deprivation of the respondent’s rights, the associate judge’s conduct
would be considered ultra vires and outside the scope of judicial immunity,
supporting a § 1983 claim for injunctive or declaratory relief (Patino v. Tex.
Dep't of Ins.-Div. of Workers' Comp., 631 S.W.3d 163 (Tex. App. 2020); City
of El Paso v. Heinrich, 284 S.W.3d 366 (Tex. 2009)). ISSUE #3 –
INTENTIONAL ATTORNEY MISCONDUCT AND THE LACK OF AN
OPPONENT In this case, Morgan Michelle Myers, after securing the March
14, 2024, temporary orders by fraudulent misrepresentations to the court,
she hid behind her alleged attorney who did not prosecute the case for over
18 months. This attorney claimed to be representing the Petitioner in her
individual capacity, yet used the marx altman and johnson letterhead in her
pleadings. Since she was allegedly retained after January 16, 2024,
everything she did in the case is arguably void given the associate judge had
no jurisdiction. On March 14, 2024, this attorney was allowed to trial by
ambush, when she called undisclosed witnesses and produced a proposed
order asking the associate judge, who had no jurisdiction, to deny the
father’s emergency motion which clearly outlined the petitioner’s fraudulent
scheme. Despite not responding to this motion, the judge ruled in her favor,
and signed an order which had altered terms, contained false statements
about hearings that never happened, and gave morgan the home and
claimed the father agreed to it. The father refused to sign it, and he was
actually ordered by the associate judge to sign the fraudulent document. He
refused, and then appealed. ISSUE #3 – APPELLATE PROCESS
INSUFFICIENT The father’s first mandamus was denied without
explanation, and he appealed to the Texas Supreme Court. The opposing
side did not participate at all, and actually attempted to get the OAG
involved mid-appeal, who wasn’t able to enforce the clearly fraudulent
orders. After the Texas Supreme Court denied rehearing, the opposing party
moved to set a pre-trial conference in the face of all of these issues, which
was countered by a motion to recuse both the district and associate judge.
ISSUE #4 – COMPROMISED RECUSAL PROCEEDINGS The recusal
proceedings were just as tainted. On October 7, 2024, Father filed his first
motion to recuse against Kaitcer and Munford. A day later, an order of
referral was forwarded by the court coordinator, someone who should not be
involved at all in the recusal process. Upon inspection, the original motion to

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
recuse had been modified where the hyperlinks were removed, the exhibits
were removed, and the affidavit was removed. This was only corrected after
the Respondent pointed out the discrepancy, which the coordinator then
replied with an exscuse that “due to the size of the motion, it was split into
three separate files”. This is clear tampering. The judge must send the
original motion to the regional judge, not a modified one. An amended order
of referral issued with these changes, however, the hyperlinks were still
removed. COOPER L. CARTER’S FRAUD UPON THE COURT 1. On February
1st, 2024, the parties met for the third time at the 322nd District Court of
Tarrant County. It’s important to note here that no order of referral had
been signed and filed, so the associate judge had no authority to even hear
the matter. 2. Nevertheless, the parties appeared, both represented by
counsel. Father insisted on proceeding to trial, however, his attorney said he
didn’t want to be in court all day, and presented him with a settlement
agreement that he did not find would be in the best interests of his Children.
The proposed agreement had the following provisions, and was prepared by
Dan Bacalis, attorney for Father: i. It was titled “Agreed Associate Judge’s
Report” ii. RESET DATE: blank. iii. Under APPEARANCES, it has both
parties appearing and both represented by counsel, however, only the
Father’s appearance was recorded on the case docket. iv. Under
TEMPORARY CONSERVATORSHIP, it elected JOINT CONSERVATORSHIP
with the mother as the primary conservator. v. It gave the mother the
exclusive right to establish the residence. vi. The right to receive child
support was given to the Mother. vii. Under the TEMPORARY POSSESSION
SCHEDULE, the EXTENDED was elected (TEX. FAM. CODE ANN.§§ 153.311
THROUGH 153.316.) viii. Under TEMPORARY CHILD SUPPORT, it had
Father responsible for making payments in the amount of $973.19 per
month to the Mother beginning on April 1, 2024. ix. Mother was to apply for
Medicaid. x. Under ADDITIONAL ORDERS, the application for protective
order that started all of this was non-suited. xi. Under TEMPORARY
POSESSION OF PROPERTY, it stated Father had the right to the 2020
Mazda 3, his personal belongings, and the Mazda CX-5 lease. It also stated
that Respondent was to vacate the home by March 1, 2024, thus giving him
one full month back into the home. However, this meant that the mother
actually removed the children from their own home for a month, as she lived
with her new boyfriend during this time. xii. Mother was entitled to her
2007 Mazda and her personal property. xiii. Most importantly, right before
the signature lines, the following provision was ordered: “A typed written
Order conforming to this Report will follow within 20 days from the date this
Report is signed. The Temporary Order shall be prepared by Dan Bacalis
Each attorney should approve the Order. The parties do not need to approve
the Order. The attorney reviewing the proposed Order shall have five (5)
days to do so. There arc no ten (JO) day letters. If an agreement is not
reached, a Motion to Sign shall be filed and set within thirty (30) days from
the signing of this Report. xiv. All parties signed this document and agreed
to form and substance, and it was signed by the Associate Judge (who had
no authority to even hear this agreement). The parties did this settlement in
the conference room in the hallway, not before the judge. 3. Because Father
knew Mother was lying, and was leveraging Judge Munford’s initial
deprivation of constitutional rights, he immediately fired his attorney, thus
invaliding the agreement, as he would not be able to prepare the reduced
version as ordered and as agreed by the parties. 4. On February 8, 2024, the

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
agreement was filed with the clerk, and the next day on February 9, 2024,
the Father filed an EMERGENCY MOTION TO RECONSIDER EVIDENCE
AND VACATE TEMPORARY ORDERS, referring to the Feb 1 Agreement. 5.
This motion highlighted in detail Mother’s illegal actions, including falsifying
her affidavit of indigency, falsifying her claims of family violence, and
provided evidence in the form of text messages to show she was having an
affair leading up to the divorce, and also attached bank statements to show
that she transferred $1,576 of community property to herself using a third
party’s paypal account to conceal her banking information. 6. This motion
was served on all of the parties on February 9, 2024. No response was ever
received to this motion. The only response was via email from Cooper
Carter, attorney for petitioner, who stated she would be filing a counter
motion. No such motion was ever filed. 7. On February 27, 2024, District
Judge James Munford signed and filed a notice of hearing, setting the
Father’s emergency motion to be heard on March 14, 2024. 8. On March 3,
2024, Father filed a notice with the Court informing them that he would not
be leaving the marital home because the agreement was invalidated. 9.
Three days later on March 6, 2024, while Father was walking his children to
school, the mother ran inside the home and locked him out, and when the
cops arrived, produced the Feb 1 agreement showing he had to leave by
March 1. To prevent conflict, Father left to stay with his Father until the
time of the hearing. 10. On March 14, 2024, the parties arrived at the 322nd
District Court for Father’s emergency motion. Upon walking into the
courtroom, Father observed Cooper Carter and the mother quickly passing
papers back and forth across the table in the conference room. 11. After
checking in with the bailiff, the Father turned around to see Cooper Carter
handing him a document entitled “Temporary Orders” which were the
reduced version of the February 1 agreement that the parties were in court
that day to challenge. 12. Alongside these orders was a “Proposed Order”
recommending that the judge deny his emergency motion to vacate. The
judge denied the father’s motion without any arguments against his position
being raised, and Cooper Carter called the wife as a witness despite not
disclosing any evidence or potential witnesses prior to the hearing. 13.
Despite non-suiting the protective order in the alleged agreement that they
claimed was still binding, she had the mother testify about fearing for her
safety if the Father was allowed near the home. 14. Upon inspection of the
fraudulent temporary orders produced by Cooper Carter, the following
provisions were unilaterally changed: i. The original agreement required the
father to vacate by March 1, 2024, but the modified version had the father in
the home until March 20, 2024, and the Mother after March 30, 2024,
leaving a 10 day window where nobody would occupy the home. ii. On page
1 of the orders, it expressly stated that “as evidenced by the signatures
below, the parties have agreed to the terms of this order” which was a
blatant lie, as Cooper had unilaterally changed the terms of the agreement
when she knew Dan Bacalis had to be the one to reduce it. iii. The orders
also falsely claimed a hearing occurred on February 1, 2024, on an alleged
“Motion for Temporary Orders” filed by the mother and was never served on
Respondent. iv. The orders also claimed that the agreement was in the best
interests of the children, and that the Court had reviewed the record. v. No
relief in father’s emergency motion was argued against, yet the motion was
summarily denied and the fraudulent orders were adopted by the Court. TIE

THESE FACTS TO A CLAIM FOR FEDERAL RELIEF, CITING THE SPECIFIC
FACTS
Answer (Texas)
Short response
The alteration and incomplete transmission of a recusal motion, combined
with judicial actions taken without a valid order of referral, present
substantial due process concerns under the Fourteenth Amendment and
Texas law, and may support a claim for federal relief under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.
Texas statutes require strict adherence to referral procedures for associate
judges, and deviation from these procedures—especially when it results in
deprivation of property or liberty interests—can constitute a violation of
constitutional due process.
Summary
The facts described raise serious questions about the integrity of the judicial
process, particularly where court staff altered a recusal motion by removing
exhibits and affidavits before forwarding it to the appropriate judge, and
where an associate judge acted without a valid order of referral. Under
Texas Family Code § 201.006, an associate judge’s authority is strictly
contingent on a proper order of referral, and actions taken without such an
order are ultra vires and outside the scope of judicial immunity.
When a party is deprived of property (such as being ordered to vacate a
home and business) without a hearing, evidence, or opportunity to cross-
examine, and when recusal motions are tampered with, these procedural
failures undermine the fairness of the proceedings and may amount to a
deprivation of due process under the Fourteenth Amendment. Such conduct,
if shown to have caused harm, can support a claim for injunctive or
declaratory relief under § 1983, as the statutory and procedural violations
directly implicate federally protected rights.
Background and Relevant Law
Legislative Framework
The Texas Family Code provides explicit requirements for the referral of
cases to associate judges. Section 201.006 mandates that a judge referring a
case to an associate judge must issue either an individual or general order of
referral, specifying the class and type of cases to be heard. This statutory
requirement is not a mere formality; it is the legal mechanism that vests the
associate judge with jurisdiction to act in the matter. The absence of a valid
referral order means the associate judge lacks authority to preside over the
case or issue orders, and any such actions are void for want of jurisdiction
(Tex. Fam. Code § 201.006).

Due Process and Federal Relief
The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits
states from depriving any person of life, liberty, or property without due
process of law. Due process, at a minimum, requires notice and an
opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner
before the government may deprive an individual of a protected interest.
When state actors, including judges and court staff, fail to follow established
procedures or tamper with court filings, they risk violating these
constitutional guarantees.
A party who suffers such a deprivation may seek relief under 42 U.S.C. §
1983, which provides a federal cause of action against any person acting
under color of state law who deprives another of rights secured by the
Constitution or federal law. In the context of judicial proceedings, actions
taken in the clear absence of jurisdiction or in violation of fundamental
procedural rights are not protected by judicial immunity and may give rise
to injunctive or declaratory relief.
Analysis
1. Tampering with Recusal Motions and Due Process
The facts indicate that the respondent’s motion to recuse was materially
altered by court staff before being forwarded to the regional judge, with
critical supporting materials (exhibits, affidavits, hyperlinks) removed. Only
after objection was the error partially corrected. This conduct raises two
distinct due process concerns:
Procedural Irregularity: Due process requires that recusal motions
be handled according to established procedures, ensuring that the
decision-maker receives the full and unaltered presentation of the
movant’s claims. The removal of exhibits and affidavits deprived the
regional judge of the complete factual and evidentiary basis for the
recusal request, undermining the fairness and integrity of the process.
State Action and § 1983: Because court staff act under color of state
law, their tampering with court documents can constitute state action
for purposes of § 1983. If this conduct results in the deprivation of a
party’s right to a fair hearing or meaningful opportunity to present
their claims, it may support a federal due process claim.
The Texas Family Code’s referral procedures, while not directly governing
recusal motions, reflect the broader principle that strict adherence to
procedural requirements is essential to the legitimacy of judicial
proceedings (Tex. Fam. Code § 201.006). The failure to transmit the original,
unaltered recusal motion to the appropriate judge is a deviation from these
requirements and may be viewed as a denial of due process.

2. Deprivation of Property Without Due Process
The respondent was ordered to vacate his home and business without a
hearing, without evidence being admitted, and without the opportunity to
cross-examine his accuser. No protective order was entered, and no
emergency was shown. These facts, if proven, constitute a classic
deprivation of property without due process of law. The Fourteenth
Amendment requires, at a minimum, notice and an opportunity to be heard
before a person is deprived of a significant property interest.
The absence of a hearing, the lack of evidence, and the inability to confront
adverse witnesses all point to a failure to provide the procedural safeguards
required by due process. If the deprivation of property (the home and
business) was based on fabricated claims and occurred without these basic
protections, the respondent has a strong argument that his constitutional
rights were violated.
3. Associate Judge’s Jurisdiction and Void Orders
Under Texas law, an associate judge’s authority to act in a case is strictly
contingent on a valid order of referral from the referring court. Section
201.006 of the Family Code requires such an order, and its absence means
the associate judge lacks jurisdiction. Any orders issued by an associate
judge without a valid referral are void and have no legal effect (Tex. Fam.
Code § 201.006).
This statutory requirement is not a technicality; it is a jurisdictional
prerequisite. If the associate judge in this case acted without a signed order
of referral, all subsequent orders—including those affecting the
respondent’s property and parental rights—are ultra vires. Actions taken in
the clear absence of jurisdiction are not protected by judicial immunity and
may support a claim for injunctive or declaratory relief under § 1983.
4. Judicial Immunity and Ultra Vires Acts
Judicial immunity generally protects judges from liability for acts performed
in their judicial capacity, even if those acts are erroneous or in excess of
authority. However, this immunity does not extend to actions taken in the
clear absence of all jurisdiction. In the context of associate judges, acting
without a valid order of referral is not merely an error or an act in excess of
authority—it is an act without any legal authority whatsoever (Tex. Fam.
Code § 201.006).
Therefore, if the associate judge issued orders or took other judicial actions
without a valid referral, those acts are not shielded by judicial immunity. The
respondent may seek injunctive or declaratory relief under § 1983 to remedy
the deprivation of rights resulting from these ultra vires acts.

5. Cumulative Effect and Federal Relief
The cumulative effect of the procedural irregularities—tampering with
recusal motions, deprivation of property without a hearing, and judicial
actions taken without jurisdiction—demonstrates a pattern of conduct that
undermines the fairness and integrity of the judicial process. Each of these
failures, standing alone, may constitute a due process violation; together,
they present a compelling case for federal relief.
A party who has been deprived of property or liberty interests through such
fundamentally flawed procedures is entitled to seek redress under § 1983.
The respondent’s claims are strengthened by the clear statutory
requirements for referral orders and the well-established constitutional
principles governing due process.
Exceptions and Caveats
While the statutory and constitutional violations described above provide a
strong basis for federal relief, several caveats should be noted:
Harmless Error: If the procedural irregularities did not ultimately
affect the outcome of the case or cause actual harm to the respondent,
a court may find that any error was harmless and does not rise to the
level of a constitutional violation.
State Remedies: Federal courts may require exhaustion of available
state remedies before granting relief under § 1983, particularly where
state law provides adequate means to challenge void orders or
procedural irregularities.
Factual Disputes: The success of a § 1983 claim will depend on the
ability to prove the alleged facts, including the alteration of court
documents, the absence of a valid referral order, and the deprivation of
property without due process.
Conclusion
In summary, the alteration and incomplete transmission of a recusal motion,
combined with judicial actions taken without a valid order of referral,
constitute serious procedural violations under both Texas law and the
Fourteenth Amendment. The Texas Family Code requires strict adherence to
referral procedures, and actions taken without jurisdiction are void and not
protected by judicial immunity. When these procedural failures result in the
deprivation of property or liberty interests without due process, they
support a claim for federal relief under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The respondent’s
allegations, if substantiated, present a strong case for injunctive or
declaratory relief to remedy the constitutional violations.

Extract
In referring a case to an associate judge, the judge of the referring court
shall render: an individual order of referral; or a general order of referral
specifying the class and type of cases to be heard by the associate judge.
Summary
The Texas Family Code requires a judge of the referring court to render an
order of referral when referring a case to an associate judge. This order can
be individual or general, specifying the class and type of cases to be heard.
The passage underscores the importance of proper procedural steps in the
referral process, which aligns with the proposition that due process requires
established procedures to be followed. The alteration of a recusal motion
and failure to transmit the original to the appropriate judge could be seen as
a deviation from these established procedures, potentially constituting a due
process violation.
