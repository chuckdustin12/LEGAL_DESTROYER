Plaintiff incorporates by reference public records from the Texas Supreme
Court, and requests the court to take judicial notice of these documents. The
Fifth Circuit has repeatedly held that it is proper for federal courts to take
judicial notice of matters of public record, including documents filed in state
court proceedings (Miller v. Dunn, 35 F.4th 1007 (5th Cir. 2022); LUV N'
Care, Ltd. v. Jackel Int'l Ltd., 502 F.Supp.3d 1106 (W.D. La. 2020); Wright v.
Arlington Indep. Sch. Dist., Civil Action No. 4:19-cv-00278-P (N.D. Tex. Nov
25, 2019)). Plaintiff therefore requests that this Court take judicial
knowledge of the consolidated mandamus record, as its’ authenticity is not
reasonably disputed. Here, all record references point to the public
consolidated mandamus record, as submitted to the Texas Supreme Court, a
copy of which has been served upon each defendant named in this complaint
either individually or through their agent. Link to the record: https://

bc41-bbc08c814365 All references to the record are marked herein with
“REC. [page]” and are hyperlinked to take the reader directly to the
reference. The record is filed under affidavit, and remains unopposed at the
time of filing this complaint. Therefore, Plaintiff respectfully asks that the
Court take judicial notice of the record under Federal Rule of Evidence 201,
filed on June 6, 2025, in the Texas Supreme Court under case numbers
25-0361, 25-0367, 25-0378, 25-0426, and 25-0458. II. TIMELINE OF
EVENTS BACKGROUND Morgan Michelle Myers, (“Myers”) and Charles
Dustin Myers, (“Plaintiff”) were married on June 20, 2015, and have two
daughters, C.R.M. and M.E.M, aged seven and nine. The evidence in this
case will show that in early December of 2023, the entire family was
blindsided by Myers’ sudden announcement that she wanted a divorce from
Plaintiff. REC. 717 The evidence will further show that Myers’ reasoning for
this divorce changes over time – beginning with how Plaintiff spoke to her,
and then switches to abuse and sexual harassment, and allegations of drug
abuse, claims that were only brought up in her initial pleadings. On
December 12, 2023, Plaintiff discovered a large volume of text messages
between Myers and two individuals identified as Debbie Price and Damen
Kazlauskas of Fort Worth, Texas spanning between October 2022 and
December 2023. REC. 254-714 In response to this discovery, Myers began to
communicate with Defendant Daniel Kenneth Branthoover, a resident of
Yukon, Oklahoma, who assisted her in the planning, drafting, traveling, and
submitting of fraudulent documents to the 322nd District Court of Tarrant
County designed to divest Plaintiff of his home and business operations.
When these allegations were raised to the State, they failed to adjudicate
them and violated the Plaintiff’s constitutional rights when he was deprived
of the guarantees of equal protection under the law and when he was not
afforded due process before being deprived of his property. REC. 183. The
central question is whether Defendants Munford, Kaitcer, Carter, and Baker
are victims of the initial scheme – or willing participants in an expanded
associate-in-fact enterprise that began in December of 2023 as the Myers-
Branthoover enterprise. A. The Myers-Branthoover Enterprise 1. On
December 14, 2023, Defendants Morgan Michelle Myers (“Myers)” and
Daniel Kenneth Branthoover (“Branthoover”), acting in concert and under
deceptive pretenses, (REC. 1704), initiated text-message communications
through which they formed and advanced a common plan and agreement.
Over the weekend of December 15, 2023, they met in Yukon, Oklahoma, to
further that plan ( REC. 274-278). The deceptive text message from
Defendant Branthoover claiming that he wanted to assist Plaintiff was
following an attempt by Myers to receive an ex-parte order of protection
from the 322nd District Court of Tarrant county, attempted on December 14,
2023 (REC. 78). B. Interstate Travel and Transfer 2. As part of their
agreement, both Defendants planned to draft and submit an original petition
for divorce and an affidavit of indigency to the 322nd District Court of
Tarrant County, with the intended and foreseeable result of removing
Plaintiff from his matrimonial residence at 6641 Anne Court, Watauga, Texas
76148—which also serves as his place of business for clients in the United
States, Canada, and the United Kingdom that rely on his market data
services (REC. 812 ¶ 16). 3. During Defendant Myers’s interstate travel, she
transferred the parties’ marital funds into Defendant Branthoover’s PayPal
account in the amount of $1,576 (REC. 723). Those proceeds funded a
second mobile phone (817-940-0852), listed on the fraudulent pleadings that

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Myers and Branthoover jointly prepared in Oklahoma, which Myers then
carried from Yukon to Texas on December 17, 2023 (REC. 86; 99; 102; 107).
C. Admissions 4. On December 16, 2023, Plaintiff reached out to
Branthoover and requested that the $1,576 be returned as they were needed
for Christmas gifts for the children, and for business advertising expenses
for his business. REC. 728-729. In response, defendant Branthoover
admitted that the purpose of defendant Myers’ visit was to help her prepare
paperwork for divorce litigation and confirmed that the transfer of $1,576
did in fact occur. REC. 730. Plaintiff’s bank statement from December 2023
further confirms this transaction. REC. 723. D. Post-submission
Collaboration 5. On December 18, 2023, defendant Myers submitted the
fraudulently prepared original petition for divorce, and an affidavit of
indigency to the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County. After these
documents were submitted, defendant Branthoover sent a text message to
Plaintiff on December 19, 2023, at 5:50 P.M. CST, holding himself out to be
defendant Myers’ attorney, showing his involvement extends past the initial
help in preparing the fraudulent documents. REC. 1712-1713 6. Four days
later, on December 22, 2023, defendant Myers submitted another knowingly
fraudulent application for protective to the 322nd District Court of Tarrant
County claiming that family violence had occurred on December 18, 2023,
supported by both an affidavit and unsworn declaration. REC. 108-109. E.
Significant and Intentional Misrepresentations 7. On December 27 and
December 28, 2023, respectively, the documents prepared by Myers with
the assistance of Branthoover were served on Plaintiff via the U.S.
Constable, and contained the following misrepresentations: i. That
defendant Myers could not afford court costs; REC. 72, REC. 85-96 ii. That
defendant Myers had an active order of protection against the Plaintiff with
a finding of family violence that had occurred during the marriage; REC. 78
at 10 iii. That defendant Myers was financially responsible for the family
vehicles, rent payments, utilities, and other household expenses, making
herself appear as the primary breadwinner; REC. 92 iv. That defendant
Myers would be harassed or abused if Plaintiff were given her newly
acquired phone number that was obtained while in Oklahoma; REC. 81 at
15. v. That defendant Myers and Plaintiff ceased living together on
December 1, 2023; REC. 74 at 4 vi. That family violence occurred on
December 18, 2023, in the presence of the two Children. REC. 108-109. vii.
That both family vehicles were defendant Myers’ separate property acquired
before marriage. REC. 79 at 11B F. Evidence to the Contrary 8. On the same
day Defendant Myers claimed to be in an emergency requiring the Plaintiff’s
prompt removal from the home, she can be seen at the home with Plaintiff
and the children in no state of emergency and also still cohabitating in the
marital home. REC 1715. 9. Again, on December 29, 2023, Defendant Myers
can be seen with Plaintiff at the family home, smiling and laughing with the
children in no state of emergency and still collaborating with Plaintiff in the
marital home. REC. 1735. 10. The citation for the application for protective
order ordered Respondent to show cause as to why it should not issue with a
hearing scheduled for January 16, 2024. REC. 118. 11. In response to
extensive misrepresentation above, Plaintiff prepared an original answer,
filed a motion to consolidate, and provided background information which
alleged that defendant Myers was intentionally abusing the legal process.
REC. 130-132. Plaintiff was ordered to show cause on January 16, 2024,
regarding the protective order application. REC. 118 G. Inclement Weather

and First Appearance 12. On January 15, 2024, the Tarrant County District
Courts Facebook page sent out a notice informing the members of the public
that the court would be closed on January 16, 2024, due to inclement
weather. REC. 1202. 13. Unaware of the closure at the time, the parties
appeared at the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County on January 16, 2024,
and were met with a dark courtroom, with only one judge in the building at
the time of their arrival – Defendant James Munford (“Munford”). 14.
Defendant Munford summarily ordered the Plaintiff out of his home,
inadvertently assisting the Myers-Branthoover associate-in-fact enterprise of
achieving their primary goal in having the Plaintiff removed from his
residence, despite the broader goal being to obtain a decree of divorce to
permanently divest Plaintiff of his interests. REC. 183. 15. Defendant
Munford’s initial order was baseless, made in the absence of any emergency,
without a hearing, and disregarded the Plaintiff’s pleadings, telling Myers
“you’re going to have to find evidence of family violence!” clearly aware that
this order was made without any regard to the Plaintiff’s constitutional
rights. 16. Defendant Jeffrey Kaitcer, (“Kaitcer”) walked into the courtroom
late due to the inclement weather and turned the courtroom into a laughing
matter as he began to joke with Defendant Munford, and instructed the
parties to download the AppClose app for communication, and the matter
was reset for January 22, 2024. There exists no record of this proceeding,
only marked appearances on the docket. H. Reset #1 – January 22, 2024,
Setting 17. At the January 22 reset hearing, the parties appeared only to
have the case reset once more because defendant Myers allegedly retained
the services of Defendant Cooper Carter, (“Carter”) in the lobby of the
courthouse just moments before the hearing was scheduled to begin. No
appearance can be traced to this setting by either party on the docket (REC.
1551), and once again, no hearing was held, and the case reset for a second
time to February 1, 2024. REC. 186. 18. Kaitcer permitted attorney Dan
Bacalis, Plaintiff’s prior attorney, to fill out the Associate Judge’s Report, and
the parties never went before him as indicated by the case docket’s lack of
appearance on this date by either party. I. Reset #2 – February 1, 2024,
Setting 19. One day prior to the February 1 setting, both attorneys,
Defendant Carter and Dan Bacalis, both amended the petition for divorce
and counterpetition for divorce without the parties’ knowledge. (REC. 189,
REC. 209) These amended documents were similar, submitted on the same
day, and raised concerns for Plaintiff regarding his quality of representation.
20. At the February 1 setting, both parties were in the conference rooms
outside of Defendant Kaitcer’s courtroom, when attorney Bacalis walks in
holding a settlement agreement. When Plaintiff refused this option and
requested that they go have a hearing before the judge. 21. This is when
Bacalis stated, as witness affidavits corroborate, that he “knows this Judge
and this is the best we can get.” and further stated “[w]e’ll be here all day.
We can come back and change it later.” 22. Outraged by this response,
Plaintiff paid very close attention to the settlement offer Bacalis was
pressuring him to sign, and noticed the following provisions: A typed written
Order conforming to this Report will follow within 20 days from the date this
Report is signed. The Temporary Order shall be prepared by DAN BACALIS.
Each attorney should approve the Order. The parties do not need to approve
the Order. The attorney reviewing the proposed Order shall have five (5)
days to do so. There arc no ten (JO) day letters. If an agreement is not
reached, a Motion to Sign shall be filed and set within thirty (30) days from

=== PAGE 5 ===

the signing of this Report. IT IS SO ORDERED (REC. 233) J. Termination of
Counsel and the Emergency Motion 23. With the above provisions in mind,
Plaintiff signed the document and immediately fired his attorney and
provided notice to the court. REC. 221. By doing so, Plaintiff gained access
back to the residency, invalidated the agreement, and was able to use the
time back in the house to run damage control on his business operations
while preparing to expose the Myers-Branthoover enterprise to the court via
a MOTION TO RECONSIDER EVIDENCE AND VACATE TEMPORARY
ORDERS, which was filed on February 9, 2024, within three business days of
the February 1 agreed associate judge’s report being served by the clerk.
REC. 240 24. In this motion, it was specifically stated that: i. “I am seeking
immediate court intervention to correct procedural e rrors and address the
misuse of the legal system by the Petitioner.” REC. 244 ii. “Particularly, Dan
Branthoover became involved. He is the boyfriend of the Petitioner’s Mother.
Shortly thereafter, I received a notice from our joint bank account stating
that $1,576 had just been withdrawn. As our bank statement for December
2023 will demonstrate – the transaction record shows the funds being
transferred directly to Mr. Branthoover’s PayPal account” REC. 245 iii. “The
Petitioner's action of filing for divorce under an Affidavit of Inability to pay
three days after transferring $1,576 to herself starkly contravenes the
mandates set forth in Chapter 10, Section 10.001 of the Civil Practice and
Remedies Code”. REC 247 at B2 iv. “The Petitioner violated Chapter 10,
Section 10.001 a second time within the same document when she
intentionally elected to waive the 60-day waiting period claiming to have an
active protective order against me that found family violence had occurred
during our marriage.” REC 247 at B3. v. “This suit was the second attempt
by the Petitioner to have me removed from the home, which ultimately
succeeded.” REC 248 at D1 25. The motion went on to explain the factual
pattern described up to this point, putting the court on notice of the key
issues with provided exhibits which were duly served on Carter. In response
to Plaintiff’s motion, he received the first of just two email communications
from Carter throughout the case’s history, where she claimed she would be
filing a counter motion when disclosing her availability for the hearing on
Plaintiff’s emergency motion. REC. 2794 No such countermotion was filed
by Carter. K. Summary Judgment and Notice of Hearing 26. By February 22,
no response had been filed by Carter, so Plaintiff filed a Partial Motion for
Summary Judgment. REC. 758. Plaintiff also submitted a proposed parenting
plan as Exhibit D. REC. 769. No response was ever received from Carter. 27.
On February 27, 2024, Defendant Munford signed and issued a notice of
hearing to the parties with the hearing set for March 14, 2024. REC. 776. L.
Plaintiff’s Notice to the Court and Defendant Myers’ Self-Help Remedies 28.
On March 3, 2024, Plaintiff notified the Court that he would not be leaving
the home as it was not in the best interests of his children. REC. 782. 29.
The following day, on March 6, 2024, while walking his daughters to school,
Myers ran inside the family home, and locked him out of the marital
residence, leaving a sign on the door that said “[y]ou should have been out
by Saturday you are now locked out!” REC. 1748. 30. Plaintiff called local
law enforcement to help him regain entry into the home, where mother
produced the agreed associate judge’s report signed on February 1, 2024,
and used it as a means to block Plaintiff’s entrance to the home. 31. To avoid
further conflict, Plaintiff was escorted into the home where he was able to
grab only his computer and a few clothes and went to Flower Mound to

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
temporarily stay with his father until the time of the hearing on his
emergency motion, scheduled for March 14, 2024, at 9:00 A.M. L. The
Hearing On Plaintiff’s Emergency Motion 32. On March 14, 2024, the
parties arrived at the 322nd District Court, and on the way into the
courtroom, defendants Myers and Carter could be seen in the conference
room, quickly shuffling papers back and forth. 33. After checking in with the
bailiff, Plaintiff turned around to see defendant Carter extending to him a
document titled “Temporary Orders” that were the reduced version of the
February 1 associate judge’s report. REC. 888. 34. These orders, which were
not prepared by Dan Bacalis, which were not agreed to by the parties, were
reduced well outside of the 20-day requirement as ordered by the judge, and
which were never filed with the clerk, stated the following
misrepresentations: i. On February 1, 2024, the Court heard Petitioner's
motion for temporary orders. ii. The parties have agreed to the terms of this
order as evidenced by the signatures below. REC. 888. iii. The Court, after
examining the record and the agreement of the parties and hearing the
evidence and argument of counsel, finds that all necessary prerequisites of
the law have been legally satisfied and that the Court has jurisdiction of this
case and of all the parties. REC. 888. iv. The dates that the parties would
have access to the family residence was altered, changing the date Plaintiff
was supposed to leave from March 1, 2024, to March 20, 2024, and
changing Myers’ date of re-entry from March 1, 2024, to March 30, 2024,
leaving a 10-day window where no one would occupy the residence. v. This
modification was made to prevent Myers from being liable for illegally
locking Plaintiff out of the home on March 6, 2024. 35. On the last page of
the orders, Plaintiff’s attorney who was terminated weeks earlier did not
sign the document, and Plaintiff refused to sign the document for the
forthcoming reasons: i. It claimed a hearing occurred on a motion which was
never set for a hearing or served on the Plaintiff and doesn’t exist on the
docket. ii. It was prepared by defendant Carter, not Dan Bacalis. iii. The
associate judge was presiding over a de novo request of his own prior
report. iv. The matrimonial address was incorrect, as it stated “6641 Anns
Court”, rather than 6641 Anne Court. REC. 915, REC. 922 v. The orders
were not in the best interests of the children. vi. Notwithstanding the
Plaintiff’s revocation of consent by filing the emergency motion, the terms
were altered right before they were rendered into effect by defendant
Kaitcer. vii. Plaintiff did not agree to the terms as he was in court that very
day to expose Myers. M. Predicate Acts: Extortion 36. Kaitcer, knowing that
no response was filed, knowing that he was presiding over a hearing to
which he had no subject matter jurisdiction, and knowing that the temporary
orders produced by defendant Carter was served just moments earlier,
signed another associate judge’s report pre-drafted by defendant Carter,
which summarily denied the Plaintiff’s emergency motion, ignored the fact
that Carter had not provided a response, and within the report itself,
Plaintiff was ordered to sign the document that Carter had just presented to
him despite raising objections to its’ contents, and despite his consent not
being present. REC. 795. 37. Finally, defendant Kaitcer refused to consider
Plaintiff’s exhibits, including six affidavits prepared by his business clients
who have been directly affected by his inability to provide the real-time
market data services his clients relied on, who were located throughout the
United States. REC. 851; REC. 854; REC. 857; REC. 860; REC. 863; REC.
867; REC. 870. 38. Following the setting, the orders were rendered into

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
effect without Plaintiff’s signature (REC. 925) , and Plaintiff filed a request
for findings of fact and conclusions of law (REC. 883), and filed and
amended a “Preparatory Notice for Judicial Review” which recounted the
factual timeline up to that point, and included the affidavits that Kaitcer
refused to accept on March 14, 2024. REC. 798, REC. 851, REC. 854, REC.
857, REC. 860, REC. 863, REC. 867, REC. 870. 39. The orders stated they
were to remain in effect until the final decree of divorce, and Plaintiff’s
journey of one-sided appeals began. N. One Sided Appellate Efforts, and
Defective IWO 40. Following the rendition of the temporary orders on March
26, 2024, Plaintiff spent between April 8, 2024 and September 15, 2024,
appealing via mandamus to the Second Court of Appeals and the Texas
Supreme Court. REC. 1010. 41. During the appellate efforts, Carter filed one
of two motions in the case, which was a motion for pre-trial conference filed
on April 24, 2024, on her behalf by Roderick D. Marx, a party not named in
the suit. REC. 1014, REC. 1016. 42. Plaintiff immediately objected to the
pre-trial conference, and no response was ever issued by Carter or the
court. REC. 1018. 43. On April 30th, Plaintiff filed his notice of completion
regarding the parenting course as ordered, despite actively trying to vacate
them. REC. 1047. No parenting course was ever completed by Myers. 44. On
May 2, 2024, Plaintiff’s en banc reconsideration was denied in the Second
Court of Appeals, and he began preparing an appeal to the Supreme Court
of Texas. REC. 1067. 45. On May 19, 2024, Carter sent the second and last
email correspondence that would be received in the case, which falsely
claimed he agreed to the orders signed on March 14, 2024, and requested
that he fill out an IWO, which Plaintiff found to be defective. REC. 1722,
REC. 1728. No further correspondence was received by Carter. O.
Fraudulent Intervention and Branthoover’s Continued Involvement 46. On
June 23rd Plaintiff filed a motion in state court entitled MOTION FOR
JOINDER OF PERSONS NEEDED FOR JUST ADJUDICATION at 12:14 P.M.
REC. 1075. This motion received no response from Carter. 47. On June 23rd
at 1:54 P.M., directly following the submission of the motion, Branthoover
texted Plaintiff stating “Lol. And here comes another denial. Please sue me
individually. Please.”, referring to the earlier filed motion and showing his
continued oversight of the case’s progression since his initial predicate acts.
48. Four days later, on June 28, 2024, the Texas Office of the Attorney
General allegedly filed an intervention pleading, claiming that Plaintiff was
past due on child support, and requested information from Plaintiff. REC.
1099. 49. Most notably, the certificate of service to this intervention
pleading was allegedly signed by Holly Hayes, the designated attorney for
the OAG, yet the name underneath the signature line reads CHOYA
BURKLEY. REC. 1102. 50. Plaintiff promptly objected to the intervention,
and never received any response from the OAG, Carter, or the court. REC.
1106. P. Supreme Court, Rule 12, and Emergency Temporary Orders 51. As
Plaintiff continued to appeal to the Supreme Court of Texas, all prosecution
came to an end in the trial court. It wasn’t until September 15, 2024, that
Plaintiff filed a first amended rehearing motion in the Texas Supreme Court,
(REC. 1136) and after noticing Carter’s lack of participation, he began to
question her authority given several ambiguities surrounding her
representation, and filed a rule 12 motion to show authority. REC. 1170. No
response was ever received to this motion from Carter. 52. At this point,
Plaintiff had been staying in Airbnb homes while he sought relief to ensure
he could remain close to his daughters during this time. On September 26,

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
2024, he filed and later amended an EMERGENCY MOTION FOR
TEMPORARY ORDERS and requested expedited relief by October 1, 2024,
as that was when Plaintiff was forced to move away from the area due to
cost of living being unsustainable. REC. 1184. No response was ever
received from Carter regarding this motion. 53. By October 1, Plaintiff had
no choice but to start pursuing administrative remedies, and thought the
court was biased against him given the case’s history up to that point. He
began to prepare a Joint Motion to Recuse defendants Munford and Kaitcer
and filed it with the clerk of the court on October 7, 2024. REC. 1197. Q.
Predicate Act: Wire Fraud 54. On October 8, 2024, Defendant Munford
signed and forwarded a “Joint Motion to Recuse” attached to his order of
referral to regional presiding judge David L. Evans but was notably missing
the exhibits and affidavit critical to the motion. REC. 1222 55. A copy of this
exchange was sent via defendant Baker on 4:43 P.M. on October 8. REC.
1254 56. Plaintiff immediately pointed out the discrepancies between the
motion filed and the motion forwarded to David L. Evans, where she replied
and admitted that the full document had been e-filed and remains with the
court. REC. 1255 57. Unsatisfied with this response, Plaintiff further pointed
out that the filing size of the document filed and the one referring to David
L. Evans was significantly different. No further correspondence was
received by Baker until the following day. REC. 1256 58. The following day
on October 8, 2024, defendant Munford signed and filed an “Amended Order
of Referral” which had the full motion attached this time, albeit still
modified as the hyperlinks and bookmarks had been removed. REC. 1282 59.
This amended referral was sent via email correspondence by Baker at 11:17
A.M. on October 8, 2024, who stated that due to the size of the motion, it
was split into three parts. REC. 1258. This excuse directly contradicts the
standard filing procedure in Tarrant County, which was raised and
subsequently ignored in an objection. REC. 1269. No response was filed in
regard to the motion to recuse or objection by Carter. R. Recusal Denial and
More Delays, and Federal Removal 60. Justice E. Lee Gabriel was assigned
to hear the motion, which had to be rescheduled due to technical difficulties
for November 7, 2024. REC. 1306. 61. The morning of the hearing, Plaintiff
woke up with a dental emergency, and promptly notified all parties, and
requested a reset for the hearing, which everyone agreed to. REC.
1393-1396. 62. Despite this agreement, the recusal was denied for failure to
appear, and made no mention of the agreement or the emergency. REC.
1398. 63. With no other remedies left, Plaintiff removed the case to Federal
Court on December 2, 2024, which was quickly remanded back on
December 4, 2024. REC. 1426. 64. On December 14, 2024, defendant
Branthoover texted Plaintiff, sending a threat which stated “[w]hen things
all over, you get to deal with me.” at 2:15 P.M. REC. 1720 65. On December
16, 2024, Plaintiff initiated suit against Daniel Kenneth Branthoover in the
Western District of Oklahoma seeking relief in the form of damages from the
ongoing deprivation from his home. REC. 1451. 66. Plaintiff notified the
Texas court of this lawsuit on December 31, 2024. REC. 1446. S. Further
Delays, Motion to Dismiss for Want of Prosecution, and the Original SAPCR
67. On January 24, 2025, Plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss for want of
prosecution due to the total lack of participation in the case by the opposing
party. REC. 1527. No response was ever received from Carter on this
motion. 68. On January 29, 2025, defendant Myers began disposing of
Plaintiff’s personal belongings that remained on the family property. REC.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
1629-1631. 69. On February 12, 2025, Plaintiff learned that his youngest
daughter was suffering from dental pain due to Myers’ failure to obtain
dental insurance for the children. REC. 3281. 70. By March 14, (REC.
1833-1837) the judges had still not been reinstated from the first recusal,
which lad Plaintiff to reach out to Baker to request a hearing on his
unopposed summary judgment that had been on the docket since February
22, 2024, where he had to remind her to reinstate the judges back into the
case. REC. 1833-1837. 71. Given the delays, and since the case had been
brought in bad faith initially, the Plaintiff opened an original SAPCR suit in
the 233rd District Court of Tarrant County on March 18, 2025, where he
argued for dominant jurisdiction in a cover letter sent to the clerk. REC.
2260. T. Counsel Suddenly Becomes Active 72. The very next day, defendant
Carter filed an original answer filed on her behalf by Roderick Marx. REC.
2279. The motion was a boilerplate motion, and was followed by a motion to
consolidate, which was filed in the wrong court, and was also filed on
Carter’s behalf by RODERICK D. MARX. REC. 2284. 73. The Plaintiff
immediately responded by filing a motion to strike (REC. 1957) a Rule 12
motion to show authority challenging both Carter and RODERICK D MARX’s
authority (REC. 2288) and on March 24, 2025, an emergency ex-parte TRO
to prevent Myers from barring Plaintiff’s access to the home. (REC. 2302)
No responses were ever received from Carter on these motions. 74. On
March 26, 2025, an objection was filed to Carter’s consolidation motion in
the 233rd court. REC. 1881. 75. Plaintiff reached out to the coordinator from
the 233rd and went through the process to present the motion to the judge.
REC. 2338-2341. 76. On March 29, 2025, Plaintiff appeared before Associate
Judge Kate Stone, who refused to hear Plaintiff’s emergency motion despite
no response being filed, and told him to leave the courtroom. The hearing
date scheduled for April 10, 2025, as agreed by Carter and Plaintiff (REC.
2358), was actually un-set by Stone. REC. 2361. 77. The grounds for this
outright refusal was due to Carter calling in a favor from the judge without
even being present in the courtroom, to where Stone left the room, came
back, and told the Plaintiff to leave informing him that a motion to
consolidate would be filed by Carter the following week. U. Five Concurrent
Mandamus Petitions 78. Subsequently, after he was turned away from the
courtroom, Carter’s consolidation motion wasn’t filed until April 4, 2025
(REC. 2367), resulting in two mandamus petitions to try again to have the
March 14, 2024, order signed by Kaitcer vacated, and to compel Kate Stone
to hear the emergency TRO. See 25-0361, 25-0367. 79. On the same day the
mandamus was filed against Stone, District Judge Kenneth Newell sua
sponte granted Carter’s consolidation motion in both courts without a
hearing, and without addressing the emergency situation for the children or
the Plaintiff’s objections, leading to a third mandamus proceeding. REC.
2393, See also 25-0378. 80. On April 23, 2025, a notice of trial setting was
served on the parties by defendant Munford in the midst of all of these
issues. REC. 1773. 81. The same day, Plaintiff filed an objection and
requested an emergency stay. REC. 2219. No response was received to this
objection by either Munford or Carter. 82. Two days later on April 25, 2025,
Plaintiff filed his second recusal motion, and amended it on April 28, 2025,
this time only against Munford, and requested that the rules of procedure be
followed, and objected to the involvement of the court coordinator given the
prior recusal’s ambiguity and significant delays caused by her involvement.
REC. 2488 No response to this motion was ever filed from Carter. 83. Baker

=== PAGE 10 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
continued to be involved in the recusal process, this time erroneously
forwarding an order of referral from defendant Kaitcer, who was not named
in the recusal motion. REC. 2615. 84. Plaintiff immediately objected on April
29, 2025, naming two issues: 1) the coordinator was still involved, and 2) the
order of referral sent by Kaitcer was erroneous. REC. 2620. 84. Plaintiff
objected to the order of assignment of John H. Cayce (REC. 3149) which was
issued on May 7, 2025, due to the unresolves issues. REC. 2620. 85. David L.
Evans overruled this objection on May 15, 2025, leading to mandamus
petition 25-0426, a direct appeal to the Texas Supreme Court. REC. 3507.
86. On May 20, 2025, John H. Cayce summarily denied the recusal, including
the denial of a motion to recuse Kaitcer which was never filed, leading to
mandamus petition 25-0458, a second direct appeal to the Texas Supreme
Court. 87. All five petitions were denied both initially and on rehearing, and
all emergency motions to stay proceedings were dismissed. The only insights
given from the appellate courts was: “Denied, per curiam.” No response was
filed by any implicated judge or opposing counsel. V. Federal RICO Case and
the Push Towards Final Trial 88. In June of 2025, Plaintiff amended his
complaint against Daniel Kenneth Branthoover and enjoined Myers as a
defendant, which they defended pro-se. 89. Plaintiff communicated this
action with the trial court, and no further action was taken in the case until
August of 2025, when defendant Munford sua sponte set the case for final
trial on December 10, 2025. 90. Plaintiff immediately objected to this trial
setting, and moved to recuse Munford for a third time. 91. The court
coordinator continued to be involved in the process, leading to a subsequent
motion to recuse the regional presiding judge, David L. Evans. 92. Plaintiff
now prepares this suit to hold defendants accountable for their collective
actions, and to prevent their common goal from being achieved, which is to
obtain defendant Myers a final decree of divorce. 93. For the forthcoming
reasons, the conduct outlined herein constitutes conduct of an enterprise
through a pattern of racketeering activity, as several predicate acts were
committed, the enterprise shares a common purpose, and Plaintiff has
suffered direct and ongoing injury to business and property as a direct result
of the defendant’s collective predicate acts. RICO The timeline and evidence
provided demonstrate that the Myers-Branthoover group constitutes an
association-in-fact enterprise under RICO, with a common goal to deprive
the Plaintiff of his home and business through a pattern of racketeering
activity—specifically, wire fraud, Travel Act violations, and fraudulent court
filings—causing direct injury to the Plaintiff’s business and property. The
conduct, structure, and continuity among the participants, as well as the use
of interstate communications and travel, satisfy the elements of a RICO
claim in the Tenth Circuit, with the liability of other defendants depending
on their knowledge and intent. A. Summary The Myers-Branthoover
enterprise, as detailed in the factual timeline, meets the Tenth Circuit’s
requirements for a RICO claim by establishing an association-in-fact
enterprise with a defined structure, purpose, and continuity. The group’s
coordinated actions—including interstate transfer of funds, preparation and
submission of fraudulent legal documents, and ongoing manipulation of
court proceedings—constitute a pattern of racketeering activity, with
predicate acts of wire fraud and Travel Act violations that are related and
continuous. Plaintiff’s direct and ongoing injury to his business and property,
including loss of home, business operations, and client relationships, is
proximately caused by the enterprise’s acts. While Myers and Branthoover’s

=== PAGE 11 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
liability is clear, the involvement of other defendants (Munford, Kaitcer,
Carter, and Baker) may be characterized as inadvertent or willing
participation, depending on their knowledge and intent, but the core
elements of a RICO violation are satisfied by the conduct of Myers and
Branthoover as outlined in the enumerated timeline. The additional acts
committed by each defendant, as alleged, furthered the scheme of the
enterprise despite each additional defendant having actual knowledge of the
fraudulent scheme. RICO Statutory Framework The Racketeer Influenced
and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), codified at 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961–1968,
provides a civil cause of action for individuals injured in their business or
property by reason of a pattern of racketeering activity conducted through
an enterprise affecting interstate or foreign commerce. The most commonly
invoked provision, § 1962(c), prohibits any person employed by or associated
with an enterprise from conducting or participating in the conduct of such
enterprise’s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity. Section
1962(d) further prohibits conspiracies to violate any of the substantive RICO
provisions. To establish a civil RICO claim under § 1962(c), a plaintiff must
prove: i. The existence of an enterprise; ii. The enterprise’s engagement in,
or effect on, interstate or foreign commerce; iii. The defendant’s
employment by or association with the enterprise; iv. The defendant’s
participation, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of the enterprise’s affairs;
v. The defendant’s participation through a pattern of racketeering activity or
collection of unlawful debt. See 100 Mount Holly Bypass v. Axos Bank, Case
No. 2:20-CV-856-TS-CMR (D. Utah Jul 27, 2021). B. Predicate Acts and
Pattern Requirement RICO defines “racketeering activity” to include a wide
range of criminal offenses, including wire fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343) and
violations of the Travel Act (18 U.S.C. § 1952). A “pattern of racketeering
activity” requires at least two predicate acts within a ten-year period, but
the acts must be related and amount to or pose a threat of continued
criminal activity. The Supreme Court has clarified that a RICO violation
requires both an “enterprise” and a “pattern of racketeering activity,” with
the enterprise being a group of persons associated for a common purpose,
and the pattern involving a series of criminal acts (United States v. Harris,
695 F.3d 1125 (10th Cir. 2012)). The Tenth Circuit has further explained
that, to establish a pattern, it is not enough to simply show that two
predicate acts occurred within ten years; the acts must also be related and
pose a threat of continued criminal activity (U.S. v. Smith, 413 F.3d 1253
(10th Cir. 2005)). Note, however, that U.S. v. Smith has been stated as
overruled by United States v. Nissen, 555 F.Supp.3d 1174 (D. N.M. 2021) on
unrelated grounds, but its articulation of the pattern requirement remains
consistent with current law. C. Enterprise and Association-in-Fact An
“enterprise” under RICO includes any individual, partnership, corporation,
association, or group of individuals associated in fact, even if not a legal
entity. For an association-in-fact enterprise, the Tenth Circuit requires: i. A
purpose; ii. Relationships among those associated with the enterprise; iii.
Longevity sufficient to permit the associates to pursue the enterprise’s
purpose; iv. A decision-making framework or mechanism for controlling the
group; v. Functioning as a continuing unit; vi. Existence separate and apart
from the pattern of racketeering activity. See 100 Mount Holly Bypass. D.
Conspiracy Section 1962(d) makes it unlawful to conspire to violate any of
the substantive RICO provisions. A RICO conspiracy does not require the
establishment of an enterprise but requires that a defendant adopts the goal

=== PAGE 12 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
of furthering or facilitating a criminal endeavor that would satisfy the
elements of a substantive RICO offense (United States v. Martinez, 543
F.Supp.3d 1209 (D. N.M. 2021); United States v. Randall, 661 F.3d 1291
(10th Cir. 2011)). E. Injury Requirement RICO provides a private right of
action for individuals injured in their business or property through
fraudulent conduct, and there is no requirement that the conduct be
connected to organized crime in a civil setting (Plains Resources, Inc. v.
Gable, 782 F.2d 883 (10th Cir. 1986)). ANALYSIS F. Existence of an
Association-in-Fact Enterprise The timeline establishes that Myers and
Branthoover formed an association-in-fact enterprise beginning in December
2023 (¶¶ 1–7, 93). Their collaboration was structured, with Myers as the
petitioner in the divorce and Branthoover as the planner, drafter, and
facilitator of fraudulent documents and financial transactions. The group
had a clear purpose: to divest the Plaintiff of his home and business through
fraudulent legal filings and manipulation of court processes (¶¶ 1–7, 93).
The enterprise’s structure is evidenced by: i. The initial planning and
agreement to meet in Yukon, Oklahoma, to draft fraudulent documents (¶¶
1–3); ii. The use of interstate communications and travel to further the
scheme (¶¶ 2–3); iii. Ongoing coordination and adaptation to changing
circumstances, including the preparation and submission of false affidavits
and pleadings, and manipulation of court proceedings (¶¶ 5–7, 34, 93). This
satisfies the Tenth Circuit’s requirements for an association-in-fact
enterprise, which does not require a formal legal entity but does require a
common purpose, relationships, and sufficient longevity to pursue the
enterprise’s goals. G. Structure, Purpose, Relationships, and Continuity The
Myers-Branthoover group meets the requirements for an association-in-fact
enterprise: i. Purpose: The shared goal was to deprive the Plaintiff of his
home, business, and property interests through fraudulent means (¶¶ 1–7,
93). ii. Relationships: Myers and Branthoover maintained ongoing
communications, coordinated actions, and divided roles in the scheme (¶¶ 1–
7, 93). iii. Longevity and Continuity: The enterprise operated over a
substantial period, from at least December 2023 through present day 2025,
with multiple related acts and ongoing adaptation to changing
circumstances (¶¶ 1–93). iv. Decision-Making Framework: The group
planned, agreed on steps, and executed those steps in a coordinated manner
(¶¶ 1–7, 93). v. Existence Separate from Predicate Acts: The enterprise was
formed for the purpose of achieving a specific goal and engaged in multiple
acts over time to accomplish that goal. H. Predicate Acts: Wire Fraud, Travel
Act Violations, and Fraudulent Filings The timeline identifies multiple
predicate acts that qualify as racketeering activity under RICO: i. Wire
Fraud: Myers transferred $1,576 in marital funds to Branthoover’s PayPal
account during interstate travel, and these funds were used to purchase a
phone for use in the fraudulent scheme (¶¶ 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 34). The use of
electronic communications (text messages, emails) to plan and execute the
scheme further supports the wire fraud allegation (¶¶ 1–7, 34). ii. Travel Act
Violations: Myers traveled from Texas to Oklahoma to meet with
Branthoover, where they planned and prepared fraudulent legal documents,
which were then transported back to Texas and submitted to the court (¶¶ 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, 7). iii. Fraudulent Filings: The preparation and submission of false
affidavits and pleadings to the court, containing material misrepresentations
about financial status, family violence, and property ownership, constitute
further predicate acts (¶¶ 5, 6, 7, 34). At least two related predicate acts

=== PAGE 13 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
within ten years are required (U.S. v. Smith, 413 F.3d 1253 (10th Cir. 2005)),
and the timeline shows multiple, related predicate acts over a substantial
period (¶¶ 1–93). I. Pattern of Racketeering Activity: Relatedness and
Continuity The predicate acts were not isolated incidents but part of an
ongoing scheme. The acts were related in that they all aimed to deprive the
Plaintiff of his property and business, and they posed a threat of continued
criminal activity, as the enterprise continued to operate and adapt its tactics
over time (¶¶ 1–93). The timeline shows that the enterprise’s activities
extended over a substantial period, with multiple acts occurring over
months and involving ongoing coordination and adaptation to changing
circumstances. J. Injury to Business or Property Plaintiff suffered direct and
ongoing injury to his business and property as a result of the enterprise’s
actions. He was deprived of his home and business operations, lost access to
marital funds, and was unable to provide services to clients, resulting in
financial harm (¶¶ 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 37). These injuries are precisely the type
of harm RICO is designed to redress. Plains Resources, Inc. v. Gable, 782 F.
2d 883 (10th Cir. 1986)). K. Participation of Other Defendants: Inadvertent
or Willing The timeline raises the question of whether Munford, Kaitcer,
Carter, and Baker were victims of the initial scheme or willing participants
in the expanded enterprise. The evidence suggests that, at a minimum,
Myers and Branthoover were the core members of the enterprise, with
others potentially becoming involved through their actions in the legal
proceedings (¶¶ 14–93). i. Inadvertent Participation: Some defendants may
have participated inadvertently, such as by issuing orders or facilitating
court processes without knowledge of the underlying scheme (¶¶ 14–93). ii.
Willing Participation: Others may have become willing participants if they
knowingly furthered the enterprise’s objectives or ignored clear evidence of
fraud and misrepresentation (¶¶ 14–93). RICO does not impose liability for
inadvertent or unwitting participation; there must be knowing and willful
involvement in the conduct of the enterprise’s affairs. For the forthcoming
reasons, Plaintiff alleges that the Defendants are willing participants in the
scheme. VICTIM OR PARTICIPANT RICO liability extends to those who
knowingly participate in the conduct of the enterprise’s affairs, even if they
were not original members (RICO: A Primer (2022-01-31)). The timeline
raises the question of whether Munford, Kaitcer, Carter, and Baker were
victims of the initial scheme or willing participants in the expanded
enterprise. The evidence suggests that, at a minimum, Myers and
Branthoover were the core members of the enterprise, with others becoming
involved through their actions in the legal proceedings (¶¶ 14–93). The
timeline demonstrates that Carter, Kaitcer, and Myers engaged in extortion
by leveraging the threat of adverse legal action, fraudulent court orders, and
the manipulation of judicial process to coerce Plaintiff into relinquishing
property and business interests, satisfying the elements of extortion as a
predicate act under RICO and the Travel Act. Munford and Baker, for their
part, committed wire fraud by intentionally sending altered or incomplete
court documents via interstate email, with the intent to mislead, obstruct
relief, and further the enterprise’s objective of finalizing the divorce and
depriving Plaintiff of his property, thus meeting the requirements for wire
fraud as a RICO predicate act. These acts, as detailed in the timeline, are
not isolated but part of a coordinated pattern of racketeering activity within
an association-in-fact enterprise, as required by RICO in the Tenth Circuit.
The conduct of each defendant is tied to specific predicate acts—extortion

=== PAGE 14 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
for Carter, Kaitcer, and Myers (notably at timeline events 33–37), and wire
fraud for Munford and Baker (notably at events 54–59, 83)—demonstrating
knowing and willful participation in the enterprise’s broader scheme to
deprive Plaintiff of his home and business through fraudulent and coercive
means. A. Extortion and Wire Fraud The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961–1968, provides a civil cause of
action for injury to business or property caused by a pattern of racketeering
activity conducted through an enterprise affecting interstate commerce.
Predicate acts under RICO include extortion (as defined by the Hobbs Act
and the Travel Act) and wire fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343), among others.
Extortion is defined as obtaining property from another, with his consent,
induced by wrongful use of actual or threatened force, violence, or fear, or
under color of official right. The Travel Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1952, includes
extortion as an “unlawful activity” and does not require it to be part of a
business enterprise (U.S. v. Welch, 327 F.3d 1081 (10th Cir. 2003)). The
Tenth Circuit recognizes that extortion under the Travel Act can be
established by showing threats or coercion to obtain something of value,
including property or legal rights, in violation of state or federal law. Wire
fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343 requires (1) a scheme to defraud or obtain
property by false or fraudulent pretenses, (2) intent to defraud, and (3) use
of interstate wire communications to execute the scheme (Clinton v. Sec.
Benefit Life Ins. Co., 63 F.4th 1264 (10th Cir. 2023); United States v.
Holloway, 826 F.3d 1237 (10th Cir. 2016)). The Tenth Circuit requires that
the deprivation of property be a central object of the scheme, and that the
use of wires (including email) be knowing and in furtherance of the
fraudulent scheme (United States v. Tao, 629 F.Supp.3d 1083). B. Extortion
by Carter, Kaitcer, and Myers Extortion, as a RICO predicate act, is defined
broadly under federal law and the Travel Act. It includes obtaining property
or rights through threats, coercion, or misuse of official process (U.S. v.
Welch, 327 F.3d 1081 (10th Cir. 2003)). The Tenth Circuit does not require
extortion to be part of a business enterprise for Travel Act purposes; a single
act suffices if it has the requisite interstate nexus. The timeline shows the
following: i. Event 33–34: Carter, with Myers, prepared and presented
“Temporary Orders” that misrepresented facts (e.g., that Plaintiff agreed to
terms he did not, that a hearing occurred when it did not, and that the
orders were in the best interests of the children). These orders altered the
dates of access to the home to shield Myers from liability for locking Plaintiff
out, and were presented to Plaintiff in a context where he was under threat
of losing his home and business. iii. Event 36: Kaitcer, knowing the orders
were disputed and that no response had been filed, signed an associate
judge’s report pre-drafted by Carter, summarily denying Plaintiff’s
emergency motion and ordering Plaintiff to sign the disputed document,
despite his objections and lack of consent. iv. Event 35: Plaintiff refused to
sign the orders for multiple reasons, including their fraudulent content and
the lack of due process, but the orders were rendered into effect without his
signature. These acts collectively demonstrate the use of legal process and
the threat of adverse judicial action to coerce Plaintiff into surrendering his
property and business interests. The manipulation of court orders, the
misrepresentation of facts, and the pressure to sign under threat of losing
his home constitute extortion under the Travel Act and RICO (U.S. v. Welch,
327 F.3d 1081 (10th Cir. 2003). Myers’s role is clear: she was the beneficiary
and instigator of the fraudulent filings and the manipulation of court

=== PAGE 15 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
process, using the threat of legal action and the actual deprivation of
Plaintiff’s property to achieve her goal. Carter and Kaitcer acted in concert
with Myers, knowingly facilitating the extortion by preparing, presenting,
and enforcing fraudulent orders, and by using the authority of the court to
coerce Plaintiff. The fact that Plaintiff was ordered to sign a document he
objected to, under threat of continued deprivation of his home and business,
is classic extortion by color of official right. All three defendants knew that
Plaintiff did not agree to the order, as he had just fired his attorney to
challenge any basis for an agreement. This implies that despite the motion
being served on all defendants, they chose to ignore the allegations of a
fraudulent scheme and further the affairs of the enterprise. These actions
meet the requirements for extortion as a RICO predicate act: they involved
the wrongful use of threats and official process to obtain property (the home
and business) from Plaintiff, with his consent induced by fear of further loss
or legal harm. The acts were not isolated but part of a coordinated scheme
to achieve the enterprise’s goal of finalizing the divorce and divesting
Plaintiff of his property B. Wire Fraud by Munford and Baker Wire fraud
under 18 U.S.C. § 1343 requires a scheme to defraud, intent to defraud, and
use of interstate wire communications to execute the scheme (Clinton v. Sec.
Benefit Life Ins. Co., 63 F.4th 1264 (10th Cir. 2023); United States v.
Holloway, 826 F.3d 1237 (10th Cir. 2016)). The Tenth Circuit recognizes that
sending altered or incomplete court documents via email, with the intent to
mislead or deprive someone of property or rights, can constitute wire fraud
if the deprivation of property is a central object of the scheme (United
States v. Tao, 629 F.Supp.3d 1083). The timeline shows the following: i.
Event 54: Munford signed and forwarded a “Joint Motion to Recuse”
attached to his order of referral, but the document was missing critical
exhibits and affidavits necessary for Plaintiff’s relief. ii. Event 55: Baker sent
a copy of this incomplete filing via email, representing it as the full
document. iii. Event 56–57: When Plaintiff pointed out the discrepancies,
Baker provided inconsistent explanations, first claiming the full document
was e-filed, then later stating it was split into three parts due to size. iv.
Event 58: Munford signed and filed an “Amended Order of Referral” with the
full motion attached, but with hyperlinks and bookmarks removed, further
impairing the document’s integrity. v. Event 59, 83: Baker continued to
forward altered or incomplete orders and referrals, even when procedural
irregularities were raised. These acts involved the knowing use of interstate
email to transmit altered or incomplete court documents, with the intent to
prevent Plaintiff from obtaining relief and to further the enterprise’s goal of
finalizing the divorce and depriving Plaintiff of his property. The use of email
to transmit these documents satisfies the interstate wire requirement, and
the intent to defraud is evidenced by the deliberate alteration and
misrepresentation of the filings. The conduct of Munford and Baker meets
the elements of wire fraud: (1) a scheme to defraud Plaintiff of property and
rights, (2) intent to defraud by preventing relief and misleading the court
and Plaintiff, and (3) use of interstate wire communications (email) to
execute the scheme (Clinton v. Sec. Benefit Life Ins. Co., 63 F.4th 1264 (10th
Cir. 2023)). The deprivation of property (Plaintiff’s home and business) was
a central object of the scheme, not a minor part. RELATIONSHIP AND
CONTINUITY All these acts—extortion by Carter, Kaitcer, and Myers, and
wire fraud by Munford and Baker—were committed in furtherance of the
Myers-Branthoover enterprise’s overarching objective: to finalize the

=== PAGE 16 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
divorce and divest Plaintiff of his home and business. The acts were
coordinated, continuous, and related, satisfying the RICO pattern
requirement. The timeline shows that each defendant’s conduct was not an
isolated error or routine administrative act, but part of a deliberate scheme
to use the legal process, threats, and fraudulent communications to achieve
the enterprise’s unlawful goals. DAMAGES The harm inflicted upon Plaintiff
is staggering. He has lost the home in which he lived for nearly a third of his
life, the companionship of his spouse, and the society of his children. His
income has collapsed. For two years he has been consigned to a futile
appellate gauntlet, even as Defendants Munford, Kaitcer, Baker, and Carter
have repeatedly exceeded the bounds of their lawful authority in furtherance
of a broader scheme. What began as a concerted effort by Myers and
Branthoover to dispossess Plaintiff of his residence and property
metastasized into a calculated plan to procure a final decree of divorce once
the initial objective had been achieved. The objective was plain: by
engineering a final decree, Defendants would not only hobble Plaintiff’s
ability to bring this suit but also invite invocation of the Rooker–Feldman
doctrine and related abstention principles to preclude federal jurisdiction.
Now, after two years of unremitting effort, Plaintiff seeks the only
meaningful remedy remaining: federal redress to halt the ongoing abuses of
authority, to unwind tainted actions, and to compensate him fully for the
catastrophic losses Defendants have wrought. Take each piece in the TABLE
OF CONTENTS, research the topic, and tie it to the factual timeline, filling
out each element of the RICO complaint and tie each element to the factual
allegations by enumerated paragraph number. What are the requirements
for the prayer for relief section in a civil RICO complaint in the Fifth Circuit,
including damages, injunctive, declaratory, and other relief?
Answer (Fifth Circuit)
Short response
In the Fifth Circuit, the prayer for relief in a civil RICO complaint must
request (1) compensatory damages for injury to business or property, (2)
mandatory treble damages, (3) reasonable attorney’s fees and costs, and
may also seek (4) injunctive and declaratory relief, though the availability of
equitable remedies for private plaintiffs remains unsettled. The relief must
be tied to concrete financial loss proximately caused by the RICO violation,
and any request for non-monetary relief should be forward-looking to
prevent or restrain future RICO violations.
Summary
A civil RICO plaintiff in the Fifth Circuit is entitled by statute to recover
three times the actual damages sustained, plus reasonable attorney’s fees
and costs, for injuries to business or property resulting from a RICO
violation. While monetary relief is mandatory upon a showing of injury and
causation, the availability of injunctive and declaratory relief is less certain,
with courts generally permitting such relief only to prevent future violations
rather than to compensate for past harm.

The prayer for relief section should therefore include a demand for
compensatory damages (for concrete financial loss), treble damages as
required by statute, attorney’s fees and costs, and, where appropriate,
requests for injunctive or declaratory relief to prevent ongoing or future
racketeering activity. Any additional relief sought must be justified by the
facts and the remedial purposes of RICO, and the complaint should clearly
tie each form of relief to the specific injuries and ongoing risks identified in
the factual allegations.
Background and Relevant Law
Statutory Framework
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), codified at
18 U.S.C. §§ 1961–1968, provides a private right of action for any person
injured in their business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962.
Section 1964(c) mandates that a successful plaintiff “shall recover threefold
the damages he sustains and the cost of the suit, including a reasonable
attorney’s fee.” This provision is not discretionary; treble damages and
attorney’s fees are required for prevailing plaintiffs (Civil Rico: A Tool of
Advocacy (2024-01-01); Alcorn County, Miss. v. U.S. Interstate Supplies, Inc.,
731 F.2d 1160, 1167 (5th Cir. 1984)).
Section 1964(a) also authorizes courts to issue orders to prevent and
restrain violations of section 1962, including “ordering any person to divest
himself of any interest, direct or indirect, in any enterprise; imposing
reasonable restrictions on the future activities or investments of any
person...; or ordering dissolution or reorganization of any enterprise.”
However, the Fifth Circuit has not definitively ruled on whether private
plaintiffs may obtain all forms of equitable relief, such as injunctions or
declaratory judgments, under RICO (Richard v. Hoechst Celanese Chemical
Group, Inc., 355 F.3d 345, 354–55 (5th Cir. 2003)).
Case Law
Fifth Circuit and district court decisions confirm that the prayer for relief in
a civil RICO complaint must include:
Compensatory damages for injury to business or property, which must
be a concrete financial loss proximately caused by the RICO violation
(Creel v. Dr. Says, LLC, Civil Action 4:18-CV-00615 (E.D. Tex. Mar 31,
2022); Xenos Yuen v. Triple B Servs. LLP, CIVIL ACTION NO. H-18-3277
(S.D. Tex. Jun 08, 2019)).
Treble damages, which are mandatory and not subject to the court’s
discretion (Interstate Nat'l Dealer Servs. v. MSRV Repair LLC, 6:24-
CV-00170-ADA-DTG (W.D. Tex. Jun 20, 2025); Alcorn County, Miss. v.
U.S. Interstate Supplies, Inc., 731 F.2d 1160, 1167 (5th Cir. 1984)).
Reasonable attorney’s fees and costs of suit, which are also mandatory
for prevailing plaintiffs (Alcorn County, Miss. v. U.S. Interstate Supplies,
Inc., 731 F.2d 1160, 1167 (5th Cir. 1984)).

Other reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, such as charges for
photocopying, paralegal assistance, travel, and telephone usage, may
also be recoverable (Interstate Nat'l Dealer Servs. v. MSRV Repair LLC,
6:24-CV-00170-ADA-DTG (W.D. Tex. Jun 20, 2025)).
The Fifth Circuit has recognized that while RICO is to be liberally construed
to effectuate its remedial purposes, damages must be premised on actual
harm to business or property, not on speculative or intangible injuries (Creel
v. Dr. Says, LLC, Civil Action 4:18-CV-00615 (E.D. Tex. Mar 31, 2022)).
Equitable Relief
The availability of injunctive and declaratory relief for private RICO
plaintiffs is unsettled in the Fifth Circuit. The court in Richard v. Hoechst
Celanese Chemical Group, Inc., 355 F.3d 345 (5th Cir. 2003) expressly
reserved ruling on whether all forms of injunctive or equitable relief are
foreclosed to private plaintiffs under RICO. However, the Second Circuit and
other authorities have interpreted section 1964(a) to permit equitable
remedies only to prevent and restrain future RICO violations, not to
compensate for past harm. Disgorgement, for example, is generally not
available to private plaintiffs if it is intended to compensate for past injuries
rather than to prevent future violations.
Secondary Materials
Secondary sources reinforce that only damages to business or property
proximately caused by the RICO violation are compensable, and that treble
damages and attorney’s fees are mandatory. The prayer for relief should be
tailored to the concrete financial losses suffered and should not include
speculative or intangible injuries (Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy
(2024-01-01)).
Analysis
1. Compensatory Damages
A civil RICO plaintiff must allege and prove a concrete financial loss to
business or property as a result of a violation of section 1962. The damages
must be directly tied to the predicate acts constituting the RICO violation
(Creel v. Dr. Says, LLC, Civil Action 4:18-CV-00615 (E.D. Tex. Mar 31, 2022); 
Xenos Yuen v. Triple B Servs. LLP, CIVIL ACTION NO. H-18-3277 (S.D. Tex.
Jun 08, 2019)). In the context of the factual timeline, this would include
losses such as deprivation of the home, loss of business operations, lost
client relationships, and any other quantifiable financial harm proximately
caused by the alleged racketeering activity (see, e.g., timeline ¶¶ 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 37).
The complaint must specify the nature and amount of these damages, and
the prayer for relief should request an award of compensatory damages in
an amount to be proven at trial.
• 

=== PAGE 19 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
2. Treble Damages
Section 1964(c) requires that any damages awarded for injury to business or
property be trebled. The court has no discretion to reduce or deny treble
damages if liability is established (Interstate Nat'l Dealer Servs. v. MSRV
Repair LLC, 6:24-CV-00170-ADA-DTG (W.D. Tex. Jun 20, 2025); Alcorn
County, Miss. v. U.S. Interstate Supplies, Inc., 731 F.2d 1160, 1167 (5th Cir.
1984)). The prayer for relief must therefore explicitly request treble
damages.
Treble damages under RICO are partly punitive and are intended to deter
racketeering activity. Courts have held that the award of treble damages
may offset the need for prejudgment interest, as the punitive nature of the
award is designed to make the plaintiff more than whole (Allstate Ins. Co. v.
Plambeck, 802 F.3d 665, 673 (5th Cir. 2015)).
3. Attorney’s Fees and Costs
Attorney’s fees and costs are also mandatory for prevailing civil RICO
plaintiffs. Congress intended these provisions to encourage private
enforcement of RICO and to provide strong incentives for civil litigants to
pursue racketeering claims (Alcorn County, Miss. v. U.S. Interstate Supplies,
Inc., 731 F.2d 1160, 1167 (5th Cir. 1984)). The prayer for relief should
request an award of reasonable attorney’s fees and all costs of suit,
including reasonable out-of-pocket expenses such as paralegal fees, travel,
and other litigation costs (Interstate Nat'l Dealer Servs. v. MSRV Repair
LLC, 6:24-CV-00170-ADA-DTG (W.D. Tex. Jun 20, 2025)).
4. Injunctive and Declaratory Relief
The Fifth Circuit has not definitively resolved whether private plaintiffs may
obtain injunctive or declaratory relief under RICO. However, courts have
generally permitted such relief only to prevent or restrain future RICO
violations, not to compensate for past harm (Richard v. Hoechst Celanese
Chemical Group, Inc., 355 F.3d 345, 354–55 (5th Cir. 2003)). The Second
Circuit’s approach, which is persuasive but not binding, is that equitable
remedies under section 1964(a) are forward-looking and designed to prevent
future violations.
Accordingly, a prayer for injunctive or declaratory relief should be carefully
tailored to seek only orders that would prevent ongoing or future
racketeering activity. For example, the complaint may request an injunction
prohibiting defendants from continuing the alleged racketeering conduct, or
a declaratory judgment that certain actions constitute a RICO violation.
Requests for disgorgement or restitution are more problematic and may be
denied if they are intended to compensate for past injuries rather than to
prevent future harm.

=== PAGE 20 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
5. Other Relief
The prayer for relief may also include a catch-all request for “such other and
further relief as the Court deems just and proper.” This allows the court
flexibility to grant additional remedies consistent with the facts and the
remedial purposes of RICO.
6. Tying Relief to Factual Allegations
Each form of relief requested must be tied to the specific injuries and
ongoing risks identified in the factual timeline. For example:
Compensatory damages should be linked to the loss of the home,
business operations, and client relationships (timeline ¶¶ 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
37).
Treble damages should be requested for all compensatory damages
proven.
Attorney’s fees and costs should be requested for all legal work and
expenses incurred in pursuing the RICO claim.
Injunctive relief should be requested to prevent further deprivation of
property or ongoing racketeering activity, if the facts support a
continuing threat (e.g., ongoing manipulation of court proceedings,
continued deprivation of business assets).
Declaratory relief may be appropriate to clarify the parties’ rights and
obligations under RICO, particularly if there is an ongoing dispute
about the legality of certain conduct.
Exceptions and Caveats
The Fifth Circuit has not definitively ruled on the availability of all
forms of equitable relief for private RICO plaintiffs. While injunctive
and declaratory relief may be available to prevent future violations,
courts are unlikely to grant such relief to compensate for past harm
(Richard v. Hoechst Celanese Chemical Group, Inc., 355 F.3d 345, 354–
55 (5th Cir. 2003)).
Disgorgement and restitution are generally not available to private
plaintiffs if they are intended to compensate for past injuries rather
than to prevent future violations.
Any request for punitive damages beyond treble damages is not
supported by the statute, as treble damages are considered partly
punitive (Allstate Ins. Co. v. Plambeck, 802 F.3d 665, 673 (5th Cir.
2015)).
The plaintiff must demonstrate standing by showing a concrete
financial loss to business or property proximately caused by the RICO
violation (Creel v. Dr. Says, LLC, Civil Action 4:18-CV-00615 (E.D. Tex.
Mar 31, 2022)).

Conclusion
In summary, the prayer for relief in a civil RICO complaint in the Fifth
Circuit must include a demand for compensatory damages for concrete
financial loss, mandatory treble damages, reasonable attorney’s fees and
costs, and may include requests for injunctive and declaratory relief to
prevent future violations. Each form of relief must be supported by the
factual allegations and the statutory requirements of RICO. The complaint
should avoid seeking relief for speculative or intangible injuries, and any
request for equitable relief should be forward-looking and justified by the
ongoing risk of racketeering activity. The statutory framework and case law
make clear that monetary relief is mandatory for prevailing plaintiffs, while
equitable relief is available only in limited circumstances to prevent future
harm.
Legal Authorities
Allison v. Citgo Petroleum Corp., 151 F.3d 402 (5th Cir. 1998)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
The plaintiffs' claims for compensatory and punitive damages must therefore
focus almost entirely on facts and issues specific to individuals rather than
the class as a whole: what kind of discrimination was each plaintiff subjected
to; how did it affect each plaintiff emotionally and physically, at work and at
home; what medical treatment did each plaintiff receive and at what
expense; and so on and so on. Under such circumstances, an action
conducted nominally as a class action would 'degenerate in practice into
multiple lawsuits separately tried.' Castano, 84 F.3d at 745 n. 19 (citing
Fed.R.Civ.P. 23 (advisory committee notes)). ... There, a plaintiff class suing
under the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act sought
injunctive and declaratory relief as well as compensatory damages. The
district court certified the class under Rule 23(b)(2), but only with respect to
the nonmonetary claims. On appeal, we concluded that the recovery of class-
wide money damages would be highly speculative without proof of individual
injury. See id. at 386. Given the differing nature of each plaintiff's claim for
money damages and the problems involved with proving separate damages
for each class member, we held that 'the district court wisely used its
discretion to limit the class aspects to the declaratory action.' Id.
Summary
Challenges of seeking compensatory and punitive damages in class actions
due to the individual-specific nature of such claims. It highlights the court's
discretion in limiting class certification to non-monetary claims like
injunctive and declaratory relief when individual damages are speculative
and varied. This is relevant to understanding how courts in the Fifth Circuit

might approach the prayer for relief in a civil RICO complaint, particularly
in distinguishing between individual and class-wide claims.
Price v. Pinnacle Brands, Inc., 138 F.3d 602 (5th Cir. 1998)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
RICO provides a private civil action to recover treble damages for injury
suffered as a result of a violation of its substantive provisions. To state a civil
RICO claim under § 1962, a plaintiff must allege: (1) the conduct (2) of an
enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity. As a preliminary
matter, however, a plaintiff must establish that he has standing to sue. 'The
standing provision of civil RICO provides that '[a]ny person injured in his
business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962 of this chapter
may sue therefor ... and shall recover threefold the damages he sustains.'
Thus, a RICO plaintiff must satisfy two elements--injury and causation. In
dismissing this action, the district court concluded that plaintiffs had not
suffered any injury to their business or property.
Summary
Requirements for a civil RICO claim, emphasizing the need for a plaintiff to
demonstrate injury and causation to have standing. It also highlights that
RICO allows for the recovery of treble damages for injuries suffered due to a
violation of its provisions. The passage does not explicitly address injunctive
or declaratory relief, but it does mention that there is some question about
the availability of equitable remedies under RICO, with different circuits
having varying interpretations.
Allstate Ins. Co. v. Plambeck, 802 F.3d 665 (5th Cir. 2015)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
The court did not abuse its discretion in denying prejudgment interest. It
could reasonably have concluded that Allstate's recovery of treble damages
sufficiently offset the loss it suffered from being deprived of the use of its
money caused by the fraud. Treble damages under RICO are partly punitive,
allowing recovery to 'exceed actual provable damages.' Gil Ramirez Grp.,
L.L.C. v. Hous. Indep. Sch. Dist., 786 F.3d 400, 412–13 (5th Cir.2015).
Allstate has already been made more than whole on the damages it could
prove, and it has not shown that the prejudgment interest would exceed that
extra recovery. We agree with the Second Circuit that a district court does
not necessarily abuse its discretion in relying on the extracompensatory
nature of RICO treble damages in denying prejudgment interest.

Summary
Court's discretion in awarding prejudgment interest in a RICO case, noting
that treble damages under RICO are partly punitive and can exceed actual
provable damages. This suggests that in the Fifth Circuit, the prayer for
relief in a civil RICO complaint can include treble damages, which are
designed to make the plaintiff more than whole. The court has discretion in
awarding prejudgment interest, especially if treble damages already provide
sufficient compensation.

1984)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
Moreover, the provision for attorney's fees in section 1964(c) was intended
by Congress, like the provision for treble damages, to encourage private
enforcement of the laws on which RICO is predicated. These provisions
provide strong incentives to civil litigants and are integral to the effort of
Congress to enlist the aid of civil claimants in deterring racketeering, as
defined by 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1961... It is clear to us that attorney's fees are an
essential part of the relief that Congress intended to make available to
parties injured by racketeering violations. Rather than making a fee award a
matter of the trial court's discretion, as it is under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1988,
Congress made the fee award mandatory to successful civil RICO plaintiffs.
Summary
The passage highlights that in civil RICO claims, Congress intended for
attorney's fees and treble damages to be mandatory for successful plaintiffs,
providing strong incentives for private enforcement of RICO laws. This is
integral to the relief sought in civil RICO actions.
Joffroin v. Tufaro, 606 F.3d 235 (5th Cir. 2010)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
Appellants alleged that these were “racketeering activities” in violation of
RICO. See 18 U.S.C. § 1962. Appellants alleged that because RICO provides
a cause of action for “[a]ny person injured in his business or property by
reason of a violation of section 1962,” 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c), they were entitled
to damages. Appellants sought treble damages for assessments paid that
were diverted for Appellees' use and not utilized for the maintenance of the
common areas or diverted for work performed for other Clipper entities.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Appellants also sought treble damages for the total amount of contracts
procured that were not in the interest of the CEMHOA as well as any
kickbacks received by Appellees for such contracts.
Summary
In a civil RICO complaint in the Fifth Circuit, plaintiffs can seek damages if
they are injured in their business or property by a violation of section 1962.
Specifically, they can seek treble damages for losses incurred due to
racketeering activities, such as diverted funds or contracts not in the
interest of the plaintiff. This aligns with the general RICO provision under 18
U.S.C. § 1964(c).

U.S. District Court — Western District of Texas
Extract
The Court finds that the plaintiffs' requested relief is proper. Treble
damages, reasonable attorneys' fees, and other costs of suit are recoverable
under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c) for RICO offenses. See 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c)
(allowing any person injured from a violation of § 1962 to recover threefold
the damages he sustains and the cost of the suit, including attorneys' fees);
see also Vanderbilt Mortg. & Fin., Inc. v. Flores, No. C-09-312, 2011 WL
2160928, at * 21 (S.D. Tex. May 27, 2011) (collecting cases finding that the
prevailing party under RICO could recover reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses, including charges for photocopying, paralegal assistance, travel,
and telephone usage).
Summary
In a civil RICO complaint, the prayer for relief can include treble damages,
reasonable attorneys' fees, and other costs of the suit. This is supported by
18 U.S.C. § 1964(c), which allows for the recovery of threefold the damages
sustained and the cost of the suit, including attorneys' fees. The passage
also references a case that supports the recovery of reasonable out-of-
pocket expenses.

also Crowe v. Henry, 43 F.3d 198, 204 (5th Cir. 1995). The threshold
requirement for stating a civil cause of action under RICO is that that the

Summary
Basic elements required to bring a civil RICO action, which includes
demonstrating conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering
activity that results in injury to the plaintiff's business or property. This is
foundational for understanding what relief can be sought, as the relief must
address the injury caused by the RICO violation.

A plaintiff in a civil action may recover damages under the RICO statute, 18
U.S.C. § 1961, et seq., if he is able to allege and prove: 1) a violation of 18
U.S.C. § 1962(a), (b), (c), or (d), and 2) injury to business or property as a

Summary
Requirements for a plaintiff to recover damages under the RICO statute,
which include proving a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1962 and demonstrating
injury to business or property as a result of such violation. This is relevant to

Richard v. Hoechst Celanese Chemical Group, Inc., 355 F.3d 345 (5th Cir.

U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
Richard contends that the district court erred in dismissing his claim for
equitable relief in the form of a disgorgement of the Appellees' past profits.
He argues that equitable relief should be available for private civil RICO
plaintiffs under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(a)-(c). This Court has not decided whether

=== PAGE 26 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
equitable relief is available to a private civil RICO plaintiff. Price v. Pinnacle
Brands, 138 F.3d 602, 605 n. 5 (5th Cir.1998) (stating that this Court 'has
specifically reserved ruling on whether all forms of injunctive relief and
other equitable relief are foreclosed to private plaintiffs under RICO')
(internal quotations omitted). The circumstances before us do not
necessitate that we reach this question today. Even if equitable relief were
available to a private party, disgorgement is not a proper remedy given the
circumstances present in this case. Section 1964(a) provides: ... 18 U.S.C. §
1964(a). The Second Circuit has considered the conditions for disgorgement
under this statute in a RICO suit. United States v. Carson, 52 F.3d 1173,
1181 (2d Cir.1995). The Second Circuit interpreted § 1964(a) to mean that
equitable remedies are only proper to 'prevent and restrain future conduct
rather than to punish past conduct.' Id. at 1182. The court reasoned that the
three examples of permissible remedies in § 1964(a) were forward-looking,
and focused on preventing future RICO violations. Id. at 1181. With respect
to the disgorgement remedy sought, the Second Circuit noted that
disgorgement is generally available under § 1964. Id. However, when
disgorgement is sought for the purpose of compensating a party for past
injuries, the court held that the plain language of § 1964 bars relief.
Summary
The Fifth Circuit has not definitively ruled on whether equitable relief, such
as injunctive relief, is available to private civil RICO plaintiffs. It also
highlights that equitable remedies under § 1964(a) are intended to prevent
future conduct rather than compensate for past injuries, as interpreted by
the Second Circuit.
Creel v. Dr. Says, LLC, Civil Action 4:18-CV-00615 (E.D. Tex. Mar 31, 2022)
U.S. District Court — Eastern District of Texas
Extract
The RICO standing provision is found in 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c). That subsection
states: Any person injured in his business or property by reason of a
violation of section 1962 of this chapter may sue therefor in any appropriate
United States district court and shall recover threefold the damages he
sustains and the cost of the suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee. 18
U.S.C. § 1964(c). In construing § 1964(c), the Supreme Court has noted that
'the plaintiff only has standing if, and can only recover to the extent that, he
has been injured in his business or property by the conduct constituting the
violation'-that is, the predicate act. Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., Inc., 473
U.S. 479, 496 (1985). Despite the acknowledgement that 'RICO is to ‘be
liberally construed to effectuate its remedial purposes,' Id. at 498 (quoting
Pub.L. 91-452, § 904(a), 84 Stat. 947), damages for the commission of
predicate acts must be premised upon a finding that a plaintiff's business or
property was harmed. See Id. at 500. Simply, a plaintiff must demonstrate
RICO injury through a 'concrete financial loss.' Price, 138 F.3d at 606; see
United States v. Hager, 879 F.3d 550, 554 (5th Cir. 2018).

Summary
For a civil RICO complaint in the Fifth Circuit, the plaintiff must
demonstrate a concrete financial loss to have standing. The damages must
be directly tied to the injury in business or property caused by the predicate
act. The statute allows for recovery of threefold the damages sustained,
along with the cost of the suit and reasonable attorney's fees. The passage
also notes that while RICO is to be liberally construed to effectuate its
remedial purposes, the damages must be premised on actual harm to
business or property.

Co., 473 U.S. 479, 481 (1985) (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c)). “Broadly stated,
a civil RICO claimant must prove (1) a violation of the substantive RICO
statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1962, and (2) an injury to the plaintiffs business or
property by reason of a violation of section 1962.”
Summary
A civil RICO claimant must demonstrate a violation of the substantive RICO
statute and an injury to business or property resulting from that violation.
The passage specifically mentions the recovery of treble damages, which is a
form of relief available under RICO. This indicates that the prayer for relief
in a civil RICO complaint should include a request for treble damages, as
well as any other appropriate relief such as injunctive or declaratory relief,
depending on the specifics of the case.

But the statute requires no more than this. Where the plaintiff alleges each
element of the violation, the compensable injury necessarily is the harm
caused by the predicate acts sufficiently related to constitute a pattern, for
the essence of the violation is the commission of those acts in connection
with conduct of an enterprise. Those acts are, when committed in the
circumstances delineated in Sec. 1962(c), 'an activity which RICO was
designed to deter.' Any recoverable damages occurring by reason of a
violation of Sec. 1962(c) will flow from the commission of the predicate acts.
Summary
The passage explains that in a RICO claim, the compensable injury is the
harm caused by the predicate acts that form a pattern of racketeering

activity. The damages recoverable under RICO are those that result from the
commission of these predicate acts. This indicates that the prayer for relief
in a civil RICO complaint should focus on the damages directly resulting
from the predicate acts, as these are the injuries RICO is designed to
address.

Extract
RICO makes it 'unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any
enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign
commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of
such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity. ...' 18
U.S.C. § 1962(c). The statute 'provides a private civil action to recover treble
damages for injury ‘by reason of a violation of’ its substantive provisions.'
Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479, 481, 105 S.Ct. 3275, 87 L.Ed.2d

Summary
Under RICO, a plaintiff can pursue a private civil action to recover treble
damages for injuries caused by a violation of RICO's substantive provisions.
This suggests that in the prayer for relief section of a civil RICO complaint, a
plaintiff can request treble damages as a form of relief. The passage does
not explicitly mention injunctive or declaratory relief, but it establishes the
basis for seeking monetary damages under RICO.

Extract
RICO is also more than a criminal statute. When drafting the legislation,
Congress incorporated provisions in RICO that allow private plaintiffs to
seek redress in federal court. If their lawsuit succeeds, the statute provides
a big payout: Plaintiffs are entitled to triple damages, court costs, and
attorney's fees. 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c).
Summary
The passage provides insight into the relief available under the RICO statute
for civil cases. It specifies that successful plaintiffs are entitled to triple
damages, court costs, and attorney's fees, as per 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c). This is
relevant to the prayer for relief section in a civil RICO complaint, as it
outlines the types of monetary relief that can be sought. The passage does

not specifically mention injunctive or declaratory relief, but it highlights the
financial remedies available.

Extract
The civil RICO cause of action is created by 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c), which
provides: 'Any person injured in his business or property by reason of a
violation of section 1962 of this chapter may sue therefor in any appropriate
United States district court and shall recover threefold the damages he
sustains and the cost of the suit, including a reasonable attorney’s
fee . . . .' ... Only damages to 'business or property' occurring 'by reason of'
and proximately caused by the RICO violations are compensable under §
1964(c). Further, under Sedima, the plaintiff’s compensable injury is the
harm caused by the predicate acts. ... Section 1964(c) dictates the award of
treble damages for civil RICO violations. It provides that the plaintiff 'shall
recover threefold the damages he sustains' in addition to costs and attorney
fees. This is not discretionary. Imposition of treble damages is required by
RICO.
Summary
A civil RICO complaint must include a prayer for relief that seeks treble
damages, which are mandatory under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c) for violations of
section 1962. The plaintiff must demonstrate a concrete financial loss to
business or property proximately caused by the RICO violations.
Additionally, the plaintiff is entitled to recover the costs of the suit and
reasonable attorney’s fees. The passage does not specifically address
injunctive or declaratory relief, but these are typically included in civil
complaints as appropriate.

RICO also provides for civil remedies. Under Section 1964 'any person
injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962'
may bring a civil action in either state or federal court for redress. Thus, a
plaintiff in a civil action must show, in addition to one of the four acts
described in § 1962, an injury to business or property. A showing of such
injury requires proof of concrete financial loss, not 'mere injury' to a
valuable intangible property interest.

Summary
The passage outlines that for a civil RICO claim, a plaintiff must
demonstrate an injury to business or property, which requires proof of
concrete financial loss. This is relevant to the prayer for relief section, as it
informs the type of damages that can be claimed. The passage does not
specifically address injunctive or declaratory relief, but it does highlight the
necessity of showing financial loss for damages.
