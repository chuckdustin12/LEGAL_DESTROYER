Question
Myers and Branthoover communicated across state lines (Texas and
Oklahoma) via text messages and phone calls to coordinate their actions.
Myers traveled from Texas to Oklahoma to meet with Branthoover and
collaborate on legal documents. RICO requires that the enterprise's
activities affect interstate or foreign commerce (18 U.S.C. § 1962(c)). The
interstate communications and travel between Texas and Oklahoma
establish the required connection to interstate commerce.
Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
Interstate communications via text messages and phone calls between Texas
and Oklahoma, along with Myers' travel between these states, satisfy RICO's
requirement that the enterprise's activities affect interstate commerce
under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). The courts have consistently held that even
minimal interstate activities, such as phone calls and travel between states,
establish a sufficient connection to interstate commerce for RICO
jurisdiction.
Summary
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) prohibits
individuals associated with an enterprise from conducting or participating in
that enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity when the
enterprise's activities affect interstate or foreign commerce. Based on the
provided sources, interstate communications via text messages and phone
calls between Texas and Oklahoma, combined with physical travel between
these states to collaborate on legal documents, clearly establish the required
nexus to interstate commerce under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c).
Courts have consistently interpreted RICO's interstate commerce
requirement broadly, requiring only a "de minimis" or minimal impact on
interstate commerce. The activities described in this scenario—
communications across state lines and interstate travel—have been
repeatedly recognized by federal courts as sufficient to satisfy this
jurisdictional element. This analysis will examine the statutory requirements
under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), relevant case law interpreting the interstate
commerce element, and how courts have specifically addressed situations
involving interstate communications and travel in the RICO context.

Background and Relevant Law
Legislation
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, codified at 18
U.S.C. § 1962, establishes the legal framework for RICO violations.
Specifically, 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) provides:
"It shall be unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any
enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign
commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of
such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity or
collection of unlawful debt." 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) (2025)
This provision explicitly requires that the enterprise's activities affect
interstate or foreign commerce. This requirement serves as the
jurisdictional nexus that brings the conduct within federal authority under
the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution.
Case Law
Federal courts have consistently interpreted the interstate commerce
requirement of RICO broadly. The Supreme Court has recognized the
expansive scope of RICO, noting that the statute applies to "any person" who
engages in the prohibited activities in connection with an enterprise
engaged in or affecting interstate commerce.
In Inc v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Company, 492 U.S. 229, 109 S.Ct.
2893, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989), the Supreme Court explained that RICO
"renders criminally and civilly liable 'any person' who uses or invests income
derived 'from a pattern of racketeering activity' to acquire an interest in or
to operate an enterprise engaged in interstate commerce, § 1962(a); who
acquires or maintains an interest in or control of such an enterprise 'through
a pattern of racketeering activity,' § 1962(b); who, being employed by or
associated with such an enterprise, conducts or participates in the conduct
of its affairs 'through a pattern of racketeering activity,' § 1962(c); or, finally,
who conspires to violate the first three subsections of § 1962, § 1962(d)."
The Fifth Circuit has explained the elements required to establish a RICO
violation in U.S. v. Phillips, 664 F.2d 971 (5th Cir. 1981): "In a substantive or
conspiracy RICO prosecution the Government must prove the existence of
an enterprise that affects interstate commerce. The existence of an
enterprise is an element that is separate from the element of the pattern of
racketeering activity in which the enterprise engages; the enterprise is
proved by evidence of a continuing organization and by evidence of that the
members function as a continuing unit." It should be noted that Phillips was
superseded by statute as recognized in United States v. Lechuga, No.
19-40483 (5th Cir. Jul 09, 2020), however, this particular point regarding the
interstate commerce requirement remains valid law.

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Similarly, in U.S. v. Bright, 630 F.2d 804 (5th Cir. 1980), the court reaffirmed
that Section 1962(c) prohibits any person associated with an enterprise
"engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign
commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of
such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity or
collection of unlawful debt."
The Eleventh Circuit in U.S. v. Zielie, 734 F.2d 1447 (11th Cir. 1984) also
quoted this same language from 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), emphasizing that the
enterprise's activities must affect interstate or foreign commerce. Though
Zielie was later abrogated by U.S. v. Salom, No. 08-10322 (11th Cir. Oct 15,
2009), this particular interpretation of the interstate commerce requirement
remains good law.
The Eastern District of New York in U.S. v. International Longshoremen's
Ass'n, 518 F.Supp.2d 422 (E.D. N.Y. 2007) likewise cited the statutory
language requiring that the enterprise be "engaged in, or the activities of
which affect, interstate or foreign commerce."
Furthermore, in Wanamaker v. Columbian Rope Co., 740 F.Supp. 127 (N.D.
N.Y. 1990), the court emphasized that both 18 U.S.C. § 1962(b) and (c)
require that the enterprise's activities "affect, interstate or foreign
commerce." The court stated that 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) "makes it unlawful for
any person 'employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or
the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or
participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs
through a pattern of racketeering activity....'"
Minimal Effect on Interstate Commerce Is Sufficient
Significantly, courts have consistently held that only a minimal effect on
interstate commerce is required to satisfy RICO's jurisdictional element. The
secondary source "Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy" (2024) explains that "RICO
requires no more than a slight effect upon interstate commerce. Even a
minimal effect on interstate commerce satisfies this jurisdictional
requirement."
This interpretation is also echoed in "Racketeer influenced and corrupt
organizations" (2000), which states that "many courts now exercise RICO
jurisdiction if the predicate acts have a de minimis impact on interstate
commerce, demonstrated by 'proof of a probable or potential impact.'"
Similarly, "Racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations" (1998) notes
that "All that is necessary to prove this de minimis effect on interstate
commerce is 'proof of probable or potential impact.'"
Interstate Communications and Travel Satisfy the
Requirement
Most directly relevant to the scenario at hand, courts have specifically
recognized that interstate communications and travel are sufficient to
establish the connection to interstate commerce required under RICO.

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
In U.S. v. Kunzman, 54 F.3d 1522 (10th Cir. 1995), the Tenth Circuit found
that "the use of interstate highways, the use of telephone and mails, and
transactions involving banks and financial institutions engaged in interstate
commerce" were "sufficient to allege an effect on interstate commerce." This
case directly supports the proposition that the interstate communications
via text messages and phone calls between Texas and Oklahoma, along with
Myers' interstate travel, satisfy RICO's interstate commerce requirement.
Additionally, "Securities fraud" (2006) cites Kunzman, noting that "use of
interstate highways, air travel, and checks deposited and drawn from bank
involved in interstate commerce all met jurisdiction requirements." Although
this secondary source discusses the jurisdictional requirements for federal
securities law violations, it references Kunzman's holding regarding
interstate commerce, which is applicable in the RICO context as well.
The Fifth Circuit's decision in U.S. v. Cauble, 706 F.2d 1322 (5th Cir. 1983)
provides further support, explaining that the essential elements of a Travel
Act violation include "travel in interstate commerce, specific intent to
promote, manage, establish, or carry on 'unlawful activity,' or to distribute
the proceeds of unlawful activity, and knowing and willful commission of an
act in furtherance of that intent subsequent to the act of travel." While this
case specifically addresses the Travel Act rather than RICO, its
interpretation of what constitutes interstate commerce is relevant and
supports the conclusion that Myers' travel between Texas and Oklahoma
satisfies the interstate commerce requirement.
Focus on Enterprise's Activities, Not Each Predicate Act
It's important to note that RICO requires the enterprise's activities as a
whole, rather than each individual predicate act, to affect interstate
commerce. "Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy" (2024) explains that "It is the
activities of the enterprise, not each predicate act, that must affect
interstate or foreign commerce."
Similarly, "Racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations" (2005) states
that "The government is not required to prove that the predicate acts
themselves effected interstate commerce, as long as the racketeering
activity itself effects interstate commerce." This means that the enterprise's
activities as a whole, including the interstate communications and travel
between Texas and Oklahoma, can establish the required connection to
interstate commerce, even if some individual acts might be purely intrastate
in nature.
Analysis
Interstate Communications and Travel Between Texas and
Oklahoma Satisfy RICO's Interstate Commerce
Requirement
The interstate communications via text messages and phone calls between
Texas and Oklahoma, along with Myers' travel from Texas to Oklahoma to

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
collaborate on legal documents, clearly establish the required connection to
interstate commerce under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c).
First, the statute explicitly requires that the enterprise be "engaged in, or
the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce" 18 U.S.C. §
1962(c) (2025). The communications and travel between Texas and
Oklahoma directly involve interstate activities, as they cross state lines by
definition.
Second, the courts have consistently interpreted RICO's interstate
commerce requirement broadly, requiring only a minimal or "de minimis"
effect on interstate commerce. As explained in "Civil Rico: A Tool of
Advocacy" (2024), "RICO requires no more than a slight effect upon
interstate commerce. Even a minimal effect on interstate commerce satisfies
this jurisdictional requirement."
Third, courts have specifically recognized that interstate communications
and travel are sufficient to establish the required connection to interstate
commerce. The Tenth Circuit in U.S. v. Kunzman, 54 F.3d 1522 (10th Cir.
1995) held that "the use of interstate highways, the use of telephone and
mails, and transactions involving banks and financial institutions engaged in
interstate commerce" were "sufficient to allege an effect on interstate
commerce." This case directly supports the conclusion that the interstate
communications and travel in the present scenario satisfy RICO's interstate
commerce requirement.
The use of telecommunications across state lines (text messages and phone
calls between Texas and Oklahoma) inherently involves interstate
commerce. Telecommunications infrastructure operates as part of an
interstate network, and communications that cross state lines necessarily
involve interstate commerce. Similarly, Myers' physical travel from Texas to
Oklahoma involves the use of interstate highways or other interstate
transportation systems, which the courts have recognized as activities
affecting interstate commerce.
Minimal Effect Is Sufficient
The courts' interpretation that only a minimal effect on interstate commerce
is required further strengthens the conclusion that the interstate
communications and travel in this scenario are sufficient. "Racketeer
influenced and corrupt organizations" (1998) explains that "All that is
necessary to prove this de minimis effect on interstate commerce is 'proof of
probable or potential impact.'" The interstate communications and travel
between Texas and Oklahoma clearly have at least a potential impact on
interstate commerce, as they involve the use of interstate
telecommunications systems and transportation networks.
Moreover, these activities are not isolated or incidental; they are directly
connected to the enterprise's activities. The text messages, phone calls, and
travel were used "to coordinate their actions" and "to collaborate on legal
documents." These collaborative efforts are central to the enterprise's
activities, further establishing the connection to interstate commerce.

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Enterprise's Activities as a Whole
It's worth emphasizing that RICO requires the enterprise's activities as a
whole, rather than each individual predicate act, to affect interstate
commerce. As explained in "Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy" (2024), "It is the
activities of the enterprise, not each predicate act, that must affect
interstate or foreign commerce."
In the present scenario, the interstate communications and travel form a
significant part of the enterprise's activities. The text messages and phone
calls were used to coordinate actions, and Myers traveled from Texas to
Oklahoma specifically to collaborate on legal documents with Branthoover.
These activities directly support the enterprise's operations and thus
establish the required connection to interstate commerce.
Specific Case Support
The conclusion that the interstate communications and travel in this
scenario satisfy RICO's interstate commerce requirement is further
supported by U.S. v. Kunzman, 54 F.3d 1522 (10th Cir. 1995), which found
that the use of interstate highways, telephones, and mails were sufficient to
establish the required effect on interstate commerce. The present scenario
involves similar interstate activities—text messages, phone calls, and travel
between states—that the Tenth Circuit found sufficient in Kunzman.
Additionally, while U.S. v. Cauble, 706 F.2d 1322 (5th Cir. 1983) addresses
the Travel Act rather than RICO, its interpretation of what constitutes
interstate commerce is relevant. The court explained that the essential
elements of a Travel Act violation include "travel in interstate commerce"
and "knowing and willful commission of an act in furtherance of that intent
subsequent to the act of travel." This interpretation supports the conclusion
that Myers' travel from Texas to Oklahoma, followed by collaboration on
legal documents, involves interstate commerce.
No Jurisdictional Defect
Based on the provided sources, there is no viable argument that the
interstate communications and travel in this scenario fail to satisfy RICO's
interstate commerce requirement. "Defending Civil RICO Claims: A Defense
Plan Should Be In Every Business's Arsenal" (2022) states that "a RICO
claim cannot exist without some nexus to interstate commerce. If the alleged
conduct does not affect interstate commerce, it must be dismissed."
However, the interstate communications and travel between Texas and
Oklahoma clearly establish this nexus, meeting the jurisdictional
requirement for a RICO claim.
Moreover, as "RICO: A Primer" (2022) explains, one of the elements required
to prove a violation of Section 1962(c) is that "the enterprise engaged in, or
its activities affected, interstate or foreign commerce." The interstate
communications and travel in this scenario demonstrate that the
enterprise's activities affected interstate commerce, thus satisfying this
element of a RICO violation.

Exceptions and Caveats
Focus on Enterprise's Activities, Not Individual Acts
While the interstate communications and travel in this scenario are
sufficient to establish the required connection to interstate commerce, it's
important to note that courts focus on the activities of the enterprise as a
whole, not on each individual act. As "Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy" (2024)
explains, "It is the activities of the enterprise, not each predicate act, that
must affect interstate or foreign commerce."
This means that even if some of the enterprise's activities were purely
intrastate, the interstate communications and travel could still establish the
required connection to interstate commerce for the enterprise as a whole.
However, if the interstate communications and travel were completely
incidental to the enterprise's activities—which is not the case in this
scenario, as they were used to coordinate actions and collaborate on legal
documents—there might be an argument that the enterprise's activities as a
whole do not sufficiently affect interstate commerce.
Potential Changes in Interstate Commerce Interpretation
While the courts have consistently interpreted RICO's interstate commerce
requirement broadly, requiring only a minimal effect on interstate
commerce, it's possible that future court decisions could adopt a more
restrictive interpretation. However, based on the current state of the law as
reflected in the provided sources, the interstate communications and travel
in this scenario clearly satisfy the requirement.
Evolving Nature of Interstate Communications
As technology evolves, the nature of interstate communications continues to
change. While the courts have recognized that traditional phone calls and
mail that cross state lines involve interstate commerce, the same principle
applies to newer forms of communication like text messages and emails. The
key factor is that the communications cross state lines, not the specific
technology used.
Conclusion
Based on the provided sources and the current state of the law, the
interstate communications via text messages and phone calls between Texas
and Oklahoma, along with Myers' travel from Texas to Oklahoma, clearly
satisfy RICO's requirement that the enterprise's activities affect interstate
commerce under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c).
The courts have consistently interpreted RICO's interstate commerce
requirement broadly, requiring only a minimal or "de minimis" effect on
interstate commerce. As explained in "Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy" (2024),
"RICO requires no more than a slight effect upon interstate commerce. Even

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
a minimal effect on interstate commerce satisfies this jurisdictional
requirement."
Moreover, courts have specifically recognized that interstate
communications and travel are sufficient to establish the required
connection to interstate commerce. The Tenth Circuit in U.S. v. Kunzman, 54
F.3d 1522 (10th Cir. 1995) held that "the use of interstate highways, the use
of telephone and mails, and transactions involving banks and financial
institutions engaged in interstate commerce" were "sufficient to allege an
effect on interstate commerce."
The interstate communications and travel in this scenario were not
incidental to the enterprise's activities but were directly used "to coordinate
their actions" and "to collaborate on legal documents." These activities are
central to the enterprise's operations and thus establish a clear connection
to interstate commerce.
Therefore, the interstate communications and travel between Texas and
Oklahoma establish the required connection to interstate commerce under
RICO, satisfying the jurisdictional element required by 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c).
Legal Authorities
U.S. v. Cauble, 706 F.2d 1322 (5th Cir. 1983)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
The essential elements of a Travel Act violation are travel in interstate
commerce, specific intent to promote, manage, establish, or carry on
'unlawful activity,' or to distribute the proceeds of unlawful activity, and
knowing and willful commission of an act in furtherance of that intent
subsequent to the act of travel. Because the statute fully and unambiguously
sets out the essential elements of the offense, indictments drafted
substantially in its language are sufficient.
Summary
The passage from U.S. v. Cauble outlines the essential elements required to
establish a Travel Act violation, which includes travel in interstate
commerce and the intent to promote or carry on unlawful activity. This
directly supports the proposition that Myers and Branthoover's interstate
communications and travel can establish the required connection to
interstate commerce under RICO. The passage confirms that such activities
are sufficient to meet the interstate commerce requirement.

Extract
The indictment also specifically alleges an effect on interstate commerce
through the use of interstate highways, the use of telephone and mails, and
transactions involving banks and financial institutions engaged in interstate
commerce. This is sufficient to allege an effect on interstate commerce.
Summary
The passage from "U.S. v. Kunzman" indicates that the use of interstate
highways, telephones, and mails can sufficiently allege an effect on
interstate commerce. This aligns with the proposition that Myers and
Branthoover's interstate communications and travel establish the required
connection to interstate commerce under RICO. The case demonstrates that
minimal interstate activities, such as phone calls and travel, can meet the
jurisdictional requirement for affecting interstate commerce.
U.S. v. Bright, 630 F.2d 804 (5th Cir. 1980)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
Section 1962(c) of Title 18 provides: It shall be unlawful for any person
employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities
of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate,
directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a
pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt.
Summary
For a RICO violation, the enterprise's activities must affect interstate or
foreign commerce. The passage provides the statutory language that
requires this connection to interstate commerce. The proposition involves
interstate communications and travel, which can be seen as activities
affecting interstate commerce, thus meeting one of the statutory
requirements for a RICO violation.

in the conduct of its affairs 'through a pattern of racketeering activity,' §
1962(c); or, finally, who conspires to violate the first three subsections of §
1962, § 1962(d).
Summary
RICO applies to any person involved in racketeering activities that affect
interstate commerce. The passage highlights that RICO's provisions cover
enterprises engaged in interstate commerce and that the statute's language
is broad enough to encompass a wide range of activities, including those
that involve interstate communications and travel. This supports the
proposition that the interstate communications and travel between Texas
and Oklahoma establish the required connection to interstate commerce
under RICO.

Summary
Legal basis for considering interstate communications and travel as
activities that can establish the required connection to interstate commerce.
This is relevant to the proposition because Myers and Branthoover's
interstate communications and travel could be seen as affecting interstate
commerce, thus satisfying the RICO requirement.
U.S. v. Phillips, 664 F.2d 971 (5th Cir. 1981)

enterprise is proved by evidence of a continuing organization and by
evidence that the members function as a continuing unit.
Summary
For a RICO violation, the government must prove that the enterprise affects
interstate commerce. The passage highlights that the existence of an
enterprise affecting interstate commerce is a distinct element from the
pattern of racketeering activity. This supports the proposition that interstate
communications and travel, such as those between Texas and Oklahoma, can
establish the required connection to interstate commerce for a RICO
violation.
Wanamaker v. Columbian Rope Co., 740 F.Supp. 127 (N.D. N.Y. 1990)
U.S. District Court — Northern District of New York
Extract
The cause of action in Count 6 is based on 18 U.S.C. § 1962(b), which makes
it unlawful for any person 'through a pattern of racketeering activity ... to
acquire or maintain, directly or indirectly, any interest in or control of any
enterprise which is engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or
foreign commerce.' In Count 7, plaintiff alleges defendants violated 18
U.S.C. § 1962(c), which makes it unlawful for any person 'employed by or
associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect,
interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or
indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of
racketeering activity....'
Summary
For a RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962, it is essential to demonstrate that
the enterprise's activities affect interstate or foreign commerce. The
passage specifically mentions that the unlawful conduct must be associated
with an enterprise engaged in or affecting interstate commerce. This
directly supports the proposition that interstate communications and travel
between Texas and Oklahoma can establish the required connection to
interstate commerce for a RICO claim.

Summary
For a RICO violation under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), the enterprise's activities
must affect interstate or foreign commerce. The passage explicitly states
this requirement, which aligns with the proposition that interstate
communications and travel between Texas and Oklahoma establish the
necessary connection to interstate commerce.
18 U.S.C. § 1962 18 U.S.C. § 1962 Prohibited Activities
Extract
It shall be unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any
enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign
commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of
such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity or
collection of unlawful debt.
Summary
The passage from 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) specifies that it is unlawful for any
person associated with an enterprise engaged in activities affecting
interstate or foreign commerce to participate in the conduct of such
enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity. The
proposition involves Myers and Branthoover's interstate communications
and travel, which can be seen as activities affecting interstate commerce.
This connection to interstate commerce is a key requirement under RICO, as
outlined in the passage.

Summary
For RICO jurisdiction, the predicate acts need only have a de minimis impact
on interstate commerce. This means that even minimal interstate activities,
such as communications and travel between states, can satisfy the
requirement. The passage supports the proposition by indicating that the
interstate communications and travel between Texas and Oklahoma could
establish the necessary connection to interstate commerce under RICO.

Courts have accepted a minimal impact on interstate commerce as sufficient
for RICO jurisdiction. This supports the proposition that the interstate
communications and travel between Texas and Oklahoma by Myers and
Branthoover could establish the required connection to interstate commerce
under RICO.

Summary
Jurisdictional requirement for federal securities law violations, which
includes the use of any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce. It
highlights that even intrastate use of an interstate means of communication
or any other interstate instrumentality satisfies this requirement. The case
of United States v. Kunzman further supports that the use of interstate
highways and air travel constitutes interstate commerce. This aligns with
the proposition that interstate communications and travel between Texas
and Oklahoma establish the required connection to interstate commerce
under RICO.

Sacks, Michele - 2005-03-22
Extract
Because the Commerce Clause is the source of Congress's authority to enact
RICO, it is well established that Congress may validly regulate racketeering
activity affecting interstate commerce. The prosecution must prove the
element of 'enterprise' in all RICO cases, and the defendant's association
with an enterprise affecting interstate commerce provides the RICO
jurisdiction. The government is not required to prove that the predicate acts
themselves effected interstate commerce, as long as the racketeering
activity itself effects interstate commerce.
Summary
The government does not need to prove each predicate act affects interstate
commerce, but rather that the racketeering activity as a whole does. This
supports the proposition that interstate communications and travel between
Texas and Oklahoma can establish the necessary connection to interstate
commerce for RICO purposes.

Extract
In addition, § 1962(a), (b), and (c) are limited in scope to conduct involving
enterprises engaged in or the activities of which affect interstate commerce.
It is the activities of the enterprise, not each predicate act, that must affect
interstate or foreign commerce. RICO requires no more than a slight effect
upon interstate commerce. Even a minimal effect on interstate commerce
satisfies this jurisdictional requirement.
Summary
The focus is on the activities of the enterprise as a whole, rather than each
individual predicate act. This supports the proposition that the interstate
communications and travel between Texas and Oklahoma by Myers and
Branthoover could establish the required connection to interstate
commerce, as these activities are part of the enterprise's conduct.
RICO: A Primer
Extract
To prove a violation of Section 1962(c), a plaintiff must prove the following
elements: * Existence of an enterprise; * The enterprise engaged in, or its
activities affected, interstate or foreign commerce; * The defendant was
employed by or was associated with the enterprise; * The defendant
conducted or participated, either directly or indirectly, in the conduct of the
affairs of the enterprise; and * The defendant participated in the affairs of
the enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of
unlawful debt.
Summary
Elements needed to establish a violation, including the requirement that the
enterprise's activities affect interstate commerce. The interstate
communications and travel between Texas and Oklahoma by Myers and
Branthoover can be seen as activities affecting interstate commerce, thus
supporting the proposition.

the enterprise engaged in or affected interstate commerce. The interstate
communications and travel between Texas and Oklahoma by Myers and
Branthoover can be seen as activities affecting interstate commerce, thus
satisfying one of the key elements for a RICO violation under Section
1962(c).

interstate communications and travel between Texas and Oklahoma, which
would establish the required connection to interstate commerce, thus
supporting the RICO claim.
