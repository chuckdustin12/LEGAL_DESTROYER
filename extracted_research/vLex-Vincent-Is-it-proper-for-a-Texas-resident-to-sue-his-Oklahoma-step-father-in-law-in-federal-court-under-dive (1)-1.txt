Question
Is it proper for a Texas resident to sue his Oklahoma step-father-in-law in
federal court under diversity jurisdiction for tort claims (conversion, deceit,
intentional infliction of emotional distress, and preparing false evidence)
arising from the step-father's alleged conduct during ongoing divorce
proceedings, where the plaintiff does not seek child custody or property
determinations, but only damages for emotional distress and economic loss,
and the amount in controversy exceeds $100,000?
Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
Yes, it is proper for a Texas resident to sue his Oklahoma step-father-in-law
in federal court under diversity jurisdiction for the tort claims, as the parties
are citizens of different states, the amount in controversy exceeds the
$75,000 threshold, and the domestic relations exception does not apply to
tort claims seeking only damages.
Summary
Federal courts have original jurisdiction over civil actions between citizens
of different states where the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000, known
as diversity jurisdiction. In this case, the Texas resident plaintiff and
Oklahoma step-father-in-law defendant are citizens of different states, and
the amount in controversy exceeds $100,000, satisfying the basic
requirements for diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1332.
Although federal courts typically cannot exercise jurisdiction over domestic
relations matters under the "domestic relations exception," this exception is
narrowly limited to cases involving the issuance of divorce, alimony, or child
custody decrees. The Supreme Court and multiple federal courts have
consistently held that tort claims seeking only monetary damages—even
when they arise from or relate to domestic disputes—fall outside this
exception. Since the plaintiff seeks damages for conversion, deceit,
intentional infliction of emotional distress, and preparing false evidence, and
does not ask the federal court to make determinations about child custody
or property division in the divorce, these claims are proper for federal court
adjudication under diversity jurisdiction.
Background and Relevant Law
Federal Diversity Jurisdiction
The statutory basis for diversity jurisdiction is found in 28 U.S.C. § 1332.
According to this statute, "The district courts shall have original jurisdiction

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
of all civil actions where the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value
of $75,000, exclusive of interest and costs, and is between citizens of
different States." 28 U.S.C. § 1332. This provision establishes two
fundamental requirements for diversity jurisdiction: (1) diversity of
citizenship between the parties, and (2) an amount in controversy exceeding
$75,000.
Federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction, and can only hear cases
when either diversity jurisdiction or federal question jurisdiction exists. As
explained in Emrit v. Jules (N.D. Ohio 2023), "Generally speaking, the
Constitution and Congress have given federal courts authority to hear a case
only when diversity of citizenship exists between the parties or when the
case raises a federal question." The court further clarified that "[t]o
establish diversity of citizenship, the Plaintiff must establish that he is a
citizen of one state and all the Defendants are citizens of other states. The
citizenship of a natural person equates to his domicile."
Similarly, McFarland v. St. Louis Cnty. Family Court Div. (E.D. Mo. 2021)
reiterates that "Federal courts have subject matter jurisdiction over both
federal question cases and diversity of citizenship cases," and notes that
"The burden of proving subject matter jurisdiction belongs to the plaintiff."
For complete diversity jurisdiction to be established, Schriber v. Child
Protective Services-Protection & Permanency of Ky. (W.D. Ky. 2021) explains
that "there must be complete diversity—which means that each plaintiff
must be a citizen of a different state than each defendant—and the amount
in controversy must exceed $75,000."
The Domestic Relations Exception to Federal Jurisdiction
While the statutory requirements for diversity jurisdiction are clear, federal
courts recognize a judicially-created exception known as the "domestic
relations exception" that limits their jurisdiction in certain family law
matters. This exception originated in 1859 and has been refined over time
through case law.
In the seminal case Ankenbrandt v. Richards (504 U.S. 689 (1992)), the
Supreme Court clarified the scope of this exception. As described in Shearer
v. Shearer, CIVIL 1:23-CV-01267 (M.D. Pa. Nov 16, 2023), "The Supreme
Court has held that a 'narrow' Domestic Relations Exception exists to
diversity jurisdiction. Ankenbrandt v. Richards, 504 U.S. 689, 706-07 (1992).
The Domestic Relations Exception 'encompasses only cases involving the
issuance of a divorce, alimony, or child custody decree.'"
The court in Shearer further emphasized that "only 'divorce, alimony, and
child custody decrees' remain outside federal jurisdictional bounds." This
narrow interpretation was reinforced by the Supreme Court in Marshall v.
Marshall (547 U.S. 293 (2006)).
Most critically, Shearer clearly states that "Tort claims seeking damages are
not within the Domestic Relations Exception," citing Matusow v.
TransCounty Title Agency, LLC (545 F.3d 241, 245 (3d Cir. 2008)), which

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
held that "The claims for which [the plaintiff] seeks damages sound in tort,
and, as such, they clearly fall outside of the domestic relations exception."
This principle is further elaborated in Tilley v. Anixter Inc., 283 F.Supp.2d
729 (D. Conn. 2003), where the court explained that "the Supreme Court's
decision in Ankenbrandt held that the domestic relations exception
encompasses only those cases which 'involv[e] the issuance of a divorce,
alimony, or child custody,'" and noted that the Court concluded the exception
did not apply to cases alleging tort claims. The court in Tilley identified
several factors suggesting the domestic relations exception is inapplicable to
tort claims, including cases where "the plaintiff alleges a traditional tort
claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress."
Similarly, Weiss v. Weiss, 375 F.Supp.2d 10 (D. Conn. 2005) affirmed that
"Unlike separation agreement-based contract claims, federal courts may
exercise subject matter jurisdiction over tort claims between former
spouses." The court noted that Ankenbrandt "ultimately held that plaintiff's
tort claims were not subject to the exception," because the claim "in no way
sought a 'divorce, alimony, or child custody decree.'"
The distinction between cases primarily concerned with domestic relations
versus those with merely domestic relations "overtones" is highlighted in 
Schriber v. Child Protective Services-Protection & Permanency of Ky. (W.D.
Ky. 2021): "Although this domestic relations exception to federal jurisdiction
does not apply to a civil action that merely has domestic relations overtones,
federal courts lack jurisdiction where the action is a mere pretense and the
suit is actually concerned with domestic relation issues."
In Lambe v. Frosh, Civil Action PX-22-1321 (D. Md. Jun 15, 2022), the court
noted that "Congress did not authorize [federal courts] to declare ab initio
litigants' rights and duties under family relations laws," and specifically
stated that "For matters concerning child custody, such as ordering payment
of child support, this Court retains no jurisdiction."
Finally, Freiner v. Judy (E.D. Mo. 2023) reaffirms that "this Court lacks
jurisdiction over cases involving child custody under the domestic relations
exception to federal court jurisdiction. In general, federal courts have no
jurisdiction over domestic relations matters."
Analysis
Application of Diversity Jurisdiction Requirements to the
Present Case
The first step in determining whether the Texas resident can properly sue
his Oklahoma step-father-in-law in federal court is to assess whether the
basic requirements for diversity jurisdiction are met.
Diversity of Citizenship: The plaintiff is a Texas resident and the
defendant is an Oklahoma resident. Under Emrit v. Jules, "The
citizenship of a natural person equates to his domicile." Assuming the
residency of each party corresponds to their domicile (which is typically
1. 

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
the case), the parties are citizens of different states, satisfying the
diversity requirement.
Amount in Controversy: The question states that the amount in
controversy exceeds $100,000. This is well above the $75,000 threshold
required by 28 U.S.C. § 1332. Therefore, this requirement is also
satisfied.
Since both core requirements for diversity jurisdiction are met, the next
analysis must focus on whether the domestic relations exception applies to
preclude federal jurisdiction despite the satisfaction of these statutory
requirements.
Application of the Domestic Relations Exception
The domestic relations exception, as defined by the Supreme Court in
Ankenbrandt v. Richards and cited in multiple sources, is narrow and
specifically limited to cases involving the issuance of divorce, alimony, or
child custody decrees.
In this case, the Texas resident is suing his Oklahoma step-father-in-law for
several tort claims: conversion, deceit, intentional infliction of emotional
distress, and preparing false evidence. These claims arise from the step-
father's alleged conduct during ongoing divorce proceedings. Critically, the
plaintiff is not asking the federal court to make determinations about child
custody or property division in the divorce—he is only seeking damages for
emotional distress and economic loss.
Multiple authorities directly support the proposition that such tort claims
fall outside the domestic relations exception:
Shearer v. Shearer explicitly states that "Tort claims seeking damages
are not within the Domestic Relations Exception," citing Third Circuit
precedent holding that claims seeking damages that "sound in tort"
"clearly fall outside of the domestic relations exception."
Tilley v. Anixter Inc. identified several factors indicating the domestic
relations exception is inapplicable, including cases where "the plaintiff
alleges a traditional tort claim for intentional infliction of emotional
distress." The court noted that the Supreme Court in Ankenbrandt held
the exception did not apply to tort claims.
Weiss v. Weiss confirms that "federal courts may exercise subject
matter jurisdiction over tort claims between former spouses," and notes
that Ankenbrandt held that tort claims were not subject to the
exception when they did not seek a "divorce, alimony, or child custody
decree."
The fact pattern here closely parallels the situations described in these
cases. The plaintiff is asserting tort claims (conversion, deceit, intentional
infliction of emotional distress, and preparing false evidence) and seeking
only monetary damages for emotional distress and economic loss. He is not
asking the federal court to issue any decree related to divorce, alimony, or
2. 
1. 
2. 
3. 

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
child custody, which would be the only circumstances where the domestic
relations exception would apply according to Shearer v. Shearer.
Furthermore, the relationship between the parties is relevant. The plaintiff
is suing his step-father-in-law, not his spouse. This is analogous to the
situation in Ankenbrandt, where, as noted in Weiss v. Weiss, one of the
defendants "was not a party to the previous divorce case." This further
supports the conclusion that the domestic relations exception does not
apply.
Distinguishing Between Domestic Relations Cases and Tort
Claims with Domestic Relations Overtones
The courts have drawn a clear distinction between cases that are genuinely
about domestic relations (i.e., seeking divorce, alimony, or child custody
decrees) versus those that merely have "domestic relations overtones" but
are fundamentally tort claims seeking damages.
As noted in Schriber v. Child Protective Services-Protection & Permanency
of Ky., "this domestic relations exception to federal jurisdiction does not
apply to a civil action that merely has domestic relations overtones." Federal
courts only "lack jurisdiction where the action is a mere pretense and the
suit is actually concerned with domestic relation issues."
In this case, while the tort claims arise from conduct during ongoing divorce
proceedings (giving them "domestic relations overtones"), the suit is not "a
mere pretense" to get federal courts to decide domestic relations issues. The
plaintiff is genuinely seeking damages for torts allegedly committed by his
step-father-in-law, not asking the federal court to make decisions about the
divorce, child custody, or property division.
The cases that federal courts decline to hear under the domestic relations
exception are those where the plaintiff is directly seeking divorce, alimony,
or child custody determinations, as noted in Lambe v. Frosh ("For matters
concerning child custody, such as ordering payment of child support, this
Court retains no jurisdiction") and Freiner v. Judy ("this Court lacks
jurisdiction over cases involving child custody under the domestic relations
exception").
Since the plaintiff here explicitly "does not seek child custody or property
determinations," these limitations do not apply.
The Significance of the Step-Father-in-Law Relationship
An additional factor supporting federal jurisdiction is the relationship
between the parties. The plaintiff is not suing his spouse, but rather his
"step-father-in-law." This relationship is more distant than the direct spousal
relationship typically at issue in domestic relations cases.
In Weiss v. Weiss, the court noted that in Ankenbrandt, one relevant factor
was that "the female companion was not a party to the previous divorce
case." Similarly, while the step-father-in-law may be connected to the

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
divorce proceedings, he is not one of the spouses in the divorce case. This
further supports the conclusion that the domestic relations exception should
not apply.
Connection to Ongoing Divorce Proceedings
Though the tort claims arise from the step-father's alleged conduct "during
ongoing divorce proceedings," this temporal and contextual connection does
not bring the case within the domestic relations exception.
The key question is not when or in what context the alleged torts occurred,
but whether the federal court is being asked to issue a decree related to
divorce, alimony, or child custody. As the Supreme Court held in
Ankenbrandt (as cited in Shearer v. Shearer), only "'divorce, alimony, and
child custody decrees' remain outside federal jurisdictional bounds."
Since the plaintiff is seeking damages for torts, not asking the federal court
to issue any such decree, the ongoing nature of the divorce proceedings is
irrelevant to the jurisdictional analysis.
Exceptions and Caveats
Potential Abstention
While the domestic relations exception would not bar jurisdiction in this
case, federal courts sometimes voluntarily abstain from exercising
jurisdiction in cases that are closely intertwined with state court
proceedings, particularly family court matters. This is distinct from the
domestic relations exception.
However, none of the provided authorities discuss abstention doctrines in
detail, so this remains a theoretical possibility rather than a barrier
indicated by the available sources.
Potential for Disguised Domestic Relations Claims
Federal courts are alert to attempts to disguise domestic relations claims as
tort actions to gain access to federal courts. As noted in Schriber v. Child
Protective Services-Protection & Permanency of Ky., federal courts "lack
jurisdiction where the action is a mere pretense and the suit is actually
concerned with domestic relation issues."
If, upon examination of the specific claims and requested relief, a federal
court were to determine that the plaintiff is actually seeking determinations
about domestic relations matters (divorce, alimony, or child custody) under
the guise of tort claims, it could decline jurisdiction. However, based on the
facts provided—that the plaintiff "does not seek child custody or property
determinations, but only damages for emotional distress and economic
loss"—this appears unlikely.

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Potential Jurisdictional Challenges Based on Factual
Developments
As the case progresses, factual developments might raise jurisdictional
questions. For example, if discovery reveals that the plaintiff's actual
domicile is not Texas, or that the amount in controversy was claimed in bad
faith and cannot possibly exceed $75,000, the court's jurisdiction could be
challenged.
However, based on the facts provided in the question, which state that the
plaintiff is a Texas resident, the defendant is an Oklahoma resident, and the
amount in controversy exceeds $100,000, these challenges do not appear
likely to succeed.
Conclusion
Based on the authorities available, it is proper for a Texas resident to sue his
Oklahoma step-father-in-law in federal court under diversity jurisdiction for
the tort claims described.
The basic requirements for diversity jurisdiction are satisfied: the parties
are citizens of different states (Texas and Oklahoma), and the amount in
controversy ($100,000+) exceeds the statutory threshold of $75,000
established by 28 U.S.C. § 1332.
The domestic relations exception to federal jurisdiction does not bar these
claims because:
As repeatedly affirmed by multiple authorities, including Shearer v.
Shearer, Tilley v. Anixter Inc., and Weiss v. Weiss, the exception is
narrow and does not apply to tort claims seeking damages.
The Supreme Court in Ankenbrandt (as cited in these cases) held that
the exception "encompasses only cases involving the issuance of a
divorce, alimony, or child custody decree."
The plaintiff here is seeking damages for conversion, deceit, intentional
infliction of emotional distress, and preparing false evidence—all tort
claims—and explicitly "does not seek child custody or property
determinations."
The step-father-in-law is not one of the spouses in the divorce
proceedings, further supporting the conclusion that the domestic
relations exception does not apply.
While the alleged torts arose in the context of divorce proceedings, giving
the case "domestic relations overtones," this is not sufficient to trigger the
domestic relations exception. The exception applies only where the plaintiff
is asking the federal court to issue a decree related to divorce, alimony, or
child custody, which is not the case here.

Therefore, the federal court has jurisdiction to hear these tort claims under
diversity jurisdiction, and it is proper for the Texas resident to sue his
Oklahoma step-father-in-law in federal court for these claims.
Legal Authorities
Weiss v. Weiss, 375 F.Supp.2d 10 (D. Conn. 2005)
U.S. District Court — District of Connecticut
Extract
Unlike separation agreement-based contract claims, federal courts may
exercise subject matter jurisdiction over tort claims between former
spouses. Although Ankenbrandt, 504 U.S. at 703, 112 S.Ct. 2206, firmly
established a domestic relations exception to federal jurisdiction, that case
ultimately held that plaintiff's tort claims were not subject to the exception.
At issue was the plaintiff's claim for damages against her ex-husband and his
female companion for abusing the plaintiff's children. Ankenbrandt, 504 U.S.
at 704, 112 S.Ct. 2206. The Supreme Court held that the district court had
jurisdiction over the claim because it 'in no way' sought a 'divorce, alimony,
or child custody decree,' and the female companion was not a party to the
previous divorce case. Id. at 704, 112 S.Ct. 2206.
Summary
The passage from Weiss v. Weiss discusses the federal court's ability to
exercise jurisdiction over tort claims between former spouses, even when
there is a domestic relations exception to federal jurisdiction. The key point
is that if the tort claims do not seek divorce, alimony, or child custody
decrees, and involve parties not part of the original divorce case, federal
jurisdiction can be appropriate. This is relevant to the question as it
suggests that a Texas resident could potentially sue his Oklahoma step-
father-in-law in federal court for tort claims, provided these claims are
separate from the divorce proceedings and do not involve determinations of
child custody or property.

U.S. District Court — Western District of Kentucky
Extract
For a federal court to have diversity-of-citizenship jurisdiction pursuant to
28 U.S.C. § 1332, there must be complete diversity—which means that each
plaintiff must be a citizen of a different state than each defendant—and the
amount in controversy must exceed $75,000. ... However, federal courts do
not have jurisdiction to resolve domestic relations matters. Ankenbrandt v.

Richards, 504 U.S. 689, 703 (1992); ... 'Although this domestic relations
exception to federal jurisdiction does not apply to a civil action that merely
has domestic relations overtones, federal courts lack jurisdiction where the
action is a mere pretense and the suit is actually concerned with domestic
relation issues.'
Summary
Requirements for diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1332, which
include complete diversity of citizenship and an amount in controversy
exceeding $75,000. It also highlights the domestic relations exception,
which precludes federal jurisdiction over cases primarily concerned with
domestic relations issues. However, this exception does not apply to cases
that merely have domestic relations overtones but are not primarily about
domestic relations issues.

U.S. District Court — District of Maryland
Extract
Where no federal question is presented, the Court may nonetheless retain
diversity jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1332 if the matter in
controversy exceeds $75, 000 and is between citizens of different states. ...
As to diversity jurisdiction, “Congress did not authorize [federal courts] to
declare ab initio litigants' rights and duties under family relations laws.”
Cole v. Cole, 633 F.2d 1083, 1087 (4th Cir. 1980). For matters concerning
child custody, such as ordering payment of child support, this Court retains
no jurisdiction. See Cantor v. Cohen, 442 F.3d 196, 202 (4th Cir. 2006);
Wasserman v. Wasserman, 671 F.2d 832, 834 (4th Cir. 1982) (“diversity
jurisdiction does not include power to grant divorces, determine alimony or
support obligations, or decide child custody rights”).
Summary
Federal courts can retain diversity jurisdiction if the matter in controversy
exceeds $75,000 and is between citizens of different states. However, it also
emphasizes that federal courts do not have jurisdiction over family relations
laws, such as child custody, alimony, or support obligations. The question
involves tort claims unrelated to child custody or property determinations,
which suggests that the federal court could potentially have jurisdiction if
the claims are purely for damages and not related to family law
determinations.

Extract
Generally speaking, the Constitution and Congress have given federal courts
authority to hear a case only when diversity of citizenship exists between the
parties or when the case raises a federal question. Caterpillar Inc. v.
Williams, 482 U.S. 386, 392 (1987). The first type of federal jurisdiction,
diversity of citizenship, is applicable to cases of sufficient value between
'citizens of different states.' 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a)(1). To establish diversity of
citizenship, the Plaintiff must establish that he is a citizen of one state and
all the Defendants are citizens of other states. The citizenship of a natural
person equates to his domicile. Von Dunser v. Aronoff, 915 F.2d 1071, 1072
(6th Cir. 1990). The second type of federal jurisdiction relies on the presence
of a federal question.
Summary
The passage explains the requirements for federal courts to have
jurisdiction based on diversity of citizenship. It states that for diversity
jurisdiction to apply, the parties must be citizens of different states, and the
amount in controversy must exceed $75,000. The passage also notes that
the citizenship of a natural person is determined by their domicile. This
information is directly relevant to determining whether the Texas resident
can sue his Oklahoma step-father-in-law in federal court under diversity
jurisdiction, as it confirms that if the parties are domiciled in different states
and the amount in controversy exceeds the threshold, diversity jurisdiction
could be proper.
Shearer v. Shearer, CIVIL 1:23-CV-01267 (M.D. Pa. Nov 16, 2023)
U.S. District Court — Middle District of Pennsylvania
Extract
The Supreme Court has held that a “narrow” Domestic Relations Exception
exists to diversity jurisdiction. Ankenbrandt v. Richards, 504 U.S. 689,
706-07 (1992). The Domestic Relations Exception “‘encompasses only cases
involving the issuance of a divorce, alimony, or child custody decree.'”
Matusow v. TransCounty Title Agency, LLC, 545 F.3d 241, 242 (3d Cir. 2008)
(quoting Ankenbrandt, 504 U.S. at 704). Thus, “only ‘divorce, alimony, and
child custody decrees' remain outside federal jurisdictional bounds.'”
Marshall v. Marshall, 547 U.S. 293, 308 (2006) (quoting Ankenbrandt, 504
U.S. at 704) (emphasis added). Tort claims seeking damages are not within
the Domestic Relations Exception. Matusow, 545 F.3d at 245 (“The claims
for which [the plaintiff] seeks damages sound in tort, and, as such, they
clearly fall outside of the domestic relations exception.”).

Summary
The Domestic Relations Exception to federal diversity jurisdiction is narrow
and only applies to cases involving divorce, alimony, or child custody
decrees. Tort claims seeking damages, such as those for conversion, deceit,
intentional infliction of emotional distress, and preparing false evidence, do
not fall within this exception. Therefore, such tort claims can be heard in
federal court under diversity jurisdiction, provided the other requirements
(such as diversity of citizenship and amount in controversy) are met.
Freiner v. Judy
U.S. District Court — Eastern District of Missouri
Extract
Federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction. This Court has jurisdiction
to hear cases involving the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United
States under 28 U.S.C. § 1331, and cases where diversity jurisdiction exists
under 28 U.S.C. § 1332. If this Court lacks both diversity of citizenship and
federal question jurisdiction, the case is subject to dismissal for lack of
jurisdiction. ... To the extent plaintiff is simply contesting a state-court
custody decision regarding her child and attempting to do an end-run
around Missouri family court, such an action does not arise under the
Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States. Moreover, this Court
lacks jurisdiction over cases involving child custody under the domestic
relations exception to federal court jurisdiction. In general, federal courts
have no jurisdiction over domestic relations matters.
Summary
Federal courts have limited jurisdiction and can hear cases under federal
question jurisdiction or diversity jurisdiction. The passage highlights that
federal courts generally do not have jurisdiction over domestic relations
matters, such as child custody, due to the domestic relations exception.
However, the question specifies that the plaintiff is not seeking child custody
or property determinations but only damages for emotional distress and
economic loss. Therefore, the domestic relations exception may not apply if
the claims are purely tort-based and do not require the court to make
determinations typically reserved for state family courts.

U.S. District Court — District of Connecticut
Extract
The domestic relations exception to federal jurisdiction dates from 1859,
when the Supreme Court announced that the federal courts have no
jurisdiction over suits for divorce or the allowance of alimony. ... Recently
the Supreme Court clarified the limits of the domestic relations exception. In
Ankenbrandt v. Richards, the Court overturned a lower court decision in
which the domestic relations exception was invoked in a case involving tort
allegations ... The court found that the domestic relations exception should
not apply in such a case because the status of the domestic relationship had
already been determined as a matter of state law, and the status of the
relationship had 'no bearing on the underlying torts alleged.' ... Several
factors present in this case suggest that the domestic relations exception is
inapplicable here. First, the plaintiff alleges a traditional tort claim for
intentional infliction of emotional distress. ... the Supreme Court's decision
in Ankenbrandt held that the domestic relations exception encompasses only
those cases which 'involv[e] the issuance of a divorce, alimony, or child
custody,' ... and the Court concluded that the exception did not apply to the
case before it, one which alleged various tort claims.

Summary
Tort claims, such as intentional infliction of emotional distress, do not fall
within the domestic relations exception if they do not involve the issuance of
a divorce, alimony, or child custody decree. This suggests that the Texas
resident's tort claims against his Oklahoma step-father-in-law may be proper
for federal court under diversity jurisdiction, as they do not seek divorce,
alimony, or child custody determinations.
