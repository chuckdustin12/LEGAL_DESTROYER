re:SearchTX" The father objected, and the OAG didnt do anything else in the
case, but appears at final trial under someone named "CHoy a burkley" who
has never made an appearance or filed for any kind of enforcement. They
sought to confirm arrears on a facially void order that was rendered by an
associate judge without an order of referral, and never adopted by the
district judge.
Answer (Texas)
Short response
The Office of the Attorney General (OAG) had statutory authority to
intervene and appear in the child support case, and the appearance of
different OAG attorneys or signature line mismatches do not invalidate the
OAG’s participation or pleadings. However, if the underlying child support
order was rendered by an associate judge without a valid order of referral or

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
was never adopted by the district judge as required by statute, that order
may be void or unenforceable, and the court cannot confirm arrears based
on such an order.
Summary
Texas law grants the OAG broad authority to intervene in and prosecute
child support matters, and its attorneys may appear on behalf of the State
without individualized notice or formal substitution, so objections based on
which OAG attorney appeared or signed are not grounds for invalidating the
OAG’s actions. However, for a child support order issued by an associate
judge to be enforceable and serve as the basis for arrears or enforcement,
there must be a valid order of referral from the district court, and—unless
the order falls within certain exceptions—the district judge must adopt or
sign the associate judge’s proposed order for it to become a final,
enforceable order.
If the associate judge’s order was rendered without a valid referral or was
never adopted by the district judge, it is not a valid final order and cannot
support a judgment for arrears; any attempt by the OAG to confirm arrears
on such a void order would be improper. The OAG’s statutory standing and
the technicalities of attorney appearance do not cure defects in the
underlying order’s validity, but procedural irregularities in OAG filings or
attorney signatures alone do not deprive the OAG of authority to participate
or seek relief in the case.
Background and Relevant Law
OAG Authority to Intervene and Appear
The Texas Family Code grants the OAG, as the State’s Title IV-D agency,
broad authority to intervene in any case involving the establishment,
modification, or enforcement of child support when support rights have been
assigned to the State or an application for services has been made. The
OAG’s standing and authority to participate in such cases is well established
and not dependent on the case’s origin or the specific procedural posture, as
confirmed by both statute and case law (Tex. Fam. Code § 231.101; 
Rodrigues v. Alvara, 14-24-00625-CV (Tex. App. Aug 12, 2025)).
Attorneys employed by the OAG to provide Title IV-D services represent only
the interests of the State, not those of any individual party, and may appear
at court proceedings without notice to the parties (Tex. Fam. Code §
231.109). The statute does not require that the same attorney who signed
the initial pleading appear at every hearing, nor does it require a formal
substitution of counsel for different OAG attorneys to participate. The courts
have repeatedly rejected challenges to OAG participation based on
technicalities of attorney appearance or signature, holding that the OAG’s
statutory authority is not affected by such issues (Rodrigues v. Alvara,
14-24-00625-CV (Tex. App. Aug 12, 2025)).

Associate Judge Orders: Referral, Adoption, and Finality
The Texas Family Code establishes a detailed framework for the use of
associate judges (formerly child support masters) in family law and Title IV-
D child support cases. Key statutory provisions include:
Order of Referral: Before an associate judge may hear a case, the
referring court (district judge) must issue either an individual order of
referral or a general order specifying the types of cases to be heard by
the associate judge (Tex. Fam. Code § 201.006). In Title IV-D cases,
referral is typically by general order (Tex. Fam. Code § 201.101).
Powers of Associate Judge: An associate judge may render and sign
non-final orders and may recommend final orders to the referring court
after a trial on the merits (Tex. Fam. Code § 201.104). In certain
circumstances, such as agreed orders, default orders, or orders based
on waiver, the associate judge may render and sign final orders that
become final if no timely de novo hearing is requested (Tex. Fam. Code
§ 201.007).
Adoption by District Judge: For most final orders (other than those
specifically authorized under § 201.007), the associate judge’s proposed
order becomes the order of the referring court only when the district
judge signs it, unless a party timely requests a de novo hearing (Tex.
Fam. Code § 201.013; Tex. Fam. Code § 201.014).
Effect of Lack of Referral or Adoption: If an associate judge acts
without a valid order of referral, or if the district judge never adopts or
signs the associate judge’s proposed order (where required), the
resulting order is void and unenforceable (In re Marriage of D.E.L., NO.
14-17-00216-CV (Tex. App. Feb 12, 2019)). This principle is consistently
recognized in Texas appellate decisions.
Finality of Unappealed Orders: If no party requests a de novo
hearing within the statutory period, and the associate judge’s order is
of a type that may become final by operation of law (e.g., agreed,
default, or waiver-based orders), the order becomes final and
enforceable without further action by the district judge (Tex. Fam. Code
§ 201.007; In re L.D.C., NUMBER 13-17-00053-CV (Tex. App. Dec 13,
2018); In re G.S.G., 145 S.W.3d 351 (Tex. App. 2004)).
OAG’s Role in Enforcement and Confirmation of Arrears
The OAG is authorized to seek enforcement of child support orders,
including confirmation of arrears, when support rights have been assigned
to the State (Tex. Fam. Code § 231.109; Office of the Attorney Gen. of Tex. v.
Moore, NO. 14-18-00607-CV (Tex. App. Nov 26, 2019)). The court of
continuing, exclusive jurisdiction retains authority to confirm arrears and
render cumulative money judgments for past-due support (In re D.W.G., 391
S.W.3d 154 (Tex. App. 2012)). However, the validity of any enforcement
action depends on the validity of the underlying support order.

Analysis
1. OAG Intervention and Attorney Appearance
The OAG’s intervention in June 2024, regardless of which attorney’s name
appeared on the signature line or who appeared at trial, was authorized by
statute. The OAG, as the Title IV-D agency, has standing to intervene in any
case involving the establishment, modification, or enforcement of child
support when support rights are assigned to the State or an application for
services is made (Tex. Fam. Code § 231.101; Rodrigues v. Alvara,
14-24-00625-CV (Tex. App. Aug 12, 2025)). The OAG’s attorneys represent
only the State’s interests and may appear at any proceeding without notice
to the parties (Tex. Fam. Code § 231.109).
Objections based on the fact that the OAG’s pleading was signed by “Holly
Hayes” but another attorney (“Choya Burkley”) appeared at trial do not
affect the OAG’s authority to participate. Texas courts have held that the
OAG’s statutory authority is not undermined by such technicalities, and a
Rule 12 motion to show authority is not warranted in these circumstances
(Rodrigues v. Alvara, 14-24-00625-CV (Tex. App. Aug 12, 2025)). The OAG’s
attorneys are not required to file a formal notice of appearance or
substitution each time a different assistant attorney general appears in
court.
2. Validity of the Underlying Child Support Order
The more significant issue is whether the underlying child support order,
which the OAG sought to enforce and confirm arrears upon, was valid and
enforceable. The facts suggest that the order was rendered by an associate
judge without an order of referral and was never adopted by the district
judge.
Under Texas law, an associate judge may only act on a case if there is a valid
order of referral from the district judge—either a general order for all such
cases or an individual order for the specific case (Tex. Fam. Code § 201.006; 
Tex. Fam. Code § 201.101). If no such referral exists, the associate judge
lacks authority, and any order rendered is void (In re Marriage of D.E.L.,
NO. 14-17-00216-CV (Tex. App. Feb 12, 2019)).
Even if there was a valid referral, for most final orders (other than agreed,
default, or waiver-based orders under § 201.007), the associate judge’s
proposed order does not become the order of the court unless and until the
district judge signs it (Tex. Fam. Code § 201.013; Tex. Fam. Code § 201.014).
If the district judge never adopted or signed the associate judge’s proposed
order, it is not a final, enforceable order, and cannot serve as the basis for
enforcement or confirmation of arrears (In re G.S.G., 145 S.W.3d 351 (Tex.
App. 2004)).
There are exceptions for certain types of orders—such as agreed orders,
default orders, or orders based on waiver—where the associate judge’s
order becomes final if no party requests a de novo hearing within the

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
statutory period (Tex. Fam. Code § 201.007). However, if the order at issue
does not fall within these exceptions, and was never adopted by the district
judge, it is not enforceable.
3. OAG’s Attempt to Confirm Arrears on a Void Order
If the OAG sought to confirm arrears based on an order that was rendered
by an associate judge without a valid referral or was never adopted by the
district judge, the order is void and cannot support a judgment for arrears
(In re Marriage of D.E.L., NO. 14-17-00216-CV (Tex. App. Feb 12, 2019)).
The OAG’s statutory authority to participate in the case does not cure this
defect. The court cannot confirm arrears or enforce a void order, and any
such attempt would be improper.
Texas appellate courts have consistently held that orders rendered by
associate judges without proper referral or adoption are void and
unenforceable (In re G.S.G., 145 S.W.3d 351 (Tex. App. 2004)). The OAG’s
role is to enforce valid child support orders, not to create enforceable
obligations where the underlying order is void.
4. Procedural Irregularities in OAG Filings
Technical issues such as mismatched signature lines, the appearance of
different OAG attorneys, or the lack of a formal notice of substitution do not
affect the OAG’s authority to participate or the validity of its pleadings
(Rodrigues v. Alvara, 14-24-00625-CV (Tex. App. Aug 12, 2025)). The OAG’s
attorneys represent the State, and the statute expressly allows them to
appear at any proceeding without notice to the parties (Tex. Fam. Code §
231.109). Courts have rejected challenges based on such procedural
irregularities.
5. Court’s Authority to Confirm Arrears
The court of continuing, exclusive jurisdiction retains authority to confirm
arrears and render cumulative money judgments for past-due support,
provided there is a valid underlying support order (In re D.W.G., 391 S.W.3d
154 (Tex. App. 2012)). If the underlying order is void, the court cannot
confirm arrears or enforce the order.
Exceptions and Caveats
There are limited exceptions where an associate judge’s order may become
final and enforceable without district judge adoption, such as agreed orders,
default orders, or orders based on waiver, provided no party requests a de
novo hearing within the statutory period (Tex. Fam. Code § 201.007). If the
order at issue falls within one of these exceptions, it may be enforceable
even without district judge adoption.
Additionally, if there was a valid general order of referral in place for all
Title IV-D cases in the county, the associate judge may have had authority to
act even without an individual referral (Tex. Fam. Code § 201.101). The facts

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
must be carefully examined to determine whether such a general order
existed.
Procedural challenges to the OAG’s participation or the appearance of its
attorneys are not grounds for invalidating the OAG’s actions, but defects in
the underlying order’s validity cannot be cured by the OAG’s participation.
Conclusion
The OAG had statutory authority to intervene and appear in the child
support case, and objections based on which OAG attorney appeared or
signed the pleadings are not grounds for invalidating the OAG’s actions.
However, if the underlying child support order was rendered by an associate
judge without a valid order of referral or was never adopted by the district
judge as required by statute, the order is void and unenforceable, and the
court cannot confirm arrears based on such an order. The OAG’s authority to
participate does not cure defects in the validity of the underlying order, and
any attempt to confirm arrears on a void order is improper under Texas law.
Legal Authorities
In re T.L.K., 90 S.W.3d 833 (Tex. App. 2002)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The OAG generally enforces child support under an assignment of the
support rights... However, the Family Code clearly provides that an attorney
employed to enforce the child support obligation 'represents the interest of
the state and not the interest of any other party.'... This court previously has
recognized the state's independent justiciable interest... 'Thus, the Attorney
General has a broader interest in the uniform enforcement of child support
than the individual parties...' When the OAG brings an action to enforce
child support, it is performing a government function... Just as laches is not
an available defense against the OAG... the limitations defense that
otherwise would be available under section 31.006 is not applicable to an
action brought by the OAG to enforce child support because the OAG is
asserting a right of action of the state." "In 1999, section 157.005(b) was
amended to remove the four-year limitation on confirmation and currently
provides: (b) The court retains jurisdiction to confirm the total amount of
child support arrearages and render judgment for past-due child support
until the date all current child support and medical support and child
support arrearages, including interest and applicable fees and costs, have
been paid.
Summary
The case confirms the OAG represents the State’s interests, not a private
party, and has an independent justiciable interest in child support

enforcement. It also notes defenses like laches and certain limitations do not
apply against the OAG. It further explains that courts retain jurisdiction to
confirm arrears until all support and arrears are paid.
In re Marriage of D.E.L., NO. 14-17-00216-CV (Tex. App. Feb 12, 2019)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
See Tex. Fam. Code § 201.005(a) (a judge of a court may refer to an
associate judge a suit involving the marriage relationship or protection of
the family over which the court has jurisdiction, including any matter
ancillary to the suit); § 201.006(a) (judge of the referring court shall render
an individual order of referral or a general order of referral specifying the
class and types of cases to be heard by the associate judge).
Summary
The passage confirms that a referring court must issue an order of referral—
either individual or general—authorizing an associate judge to hear the class
or type of case. It supports the proposition that, absent a proper referral, an
associate judge lacks authority to act, which bears on arguments that an
associate judge’s order could be void if there was no referral or adoption by
the district judge.
Office of the Attorney Gen. of Tex. v. C.W.H., 531 S.W.3d 178 (Tex. 2017)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
We agree with the court of appeals. This is a Title IV-D case because the
OAG is providing services in this case relating to the modification of a child-
support obligation. TEX. FAM. CODE § 101.034. The OAG requested in its
motion that the court modify the 2010 order to change both the
conservatorship provisions and the child-support obligations... Once the
OAG filed that motion seeking to modify the child-support obligations, the
presiding judge's general order automatically referred the case to the Title
IV-D associate judge." ... "We hold that the former version of the Texas
Family Code authorized the OAG to seek to modify the conservatorship
provisions of the 2010 order because that service related to the
establishment, modification, or enforcement of a child-support obligation.
Once the OAG filed its motion to modify conservatorship and the child-
support obligations, this became a Title IV-D case and the Title IV-D
associate judge was authorized to render or recommend 'any' order to
'complete' the case.

=== PAGE 10 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
The passages establish that (1) when OAG provides services to modify child
support, the case is a Title IV-D case under Tex. Fam. Code § 101.034; (2)
upon OAG’s filing seeking to modify child support, the case is automatically
referred to a Title IV-D associate judge by standing order; (3) OAG is
authorized to seek related conservatorship modifications insofar as they
relate to support; and (4) the Title IV-D associate judge is authorized to
render or recommend any order necessary to complete the case.
In re D.W.G., 391 S.W.3d 154 (Tex. App. 2012)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Section 157.005(b) ... provides: The court retains jurisdiction to confirm the
total amount of child support arrearages and render a cumulative money
judgment ... if a motion for enforcement requesting a cumulative money
judgment is filed not later than the 10th anniversary..." ... "The Texas
appellate courts that have been presented with the issue of whether section
157.005(b) applies to child support enforcement remedies other than a
cumulative money judgment, such as writs of withholding and child support
liens, have concluded it does not." ... "we conclude section 157.005(b) only
applies to cumulative money judgments for past-due child support as
provided by section 157.263, not to other child support enforcement
remedies..." ... "Because Virginia neither sought nor obtained relief under
section 157.263, section 157.005(b)'s deadlines... do not apply..." ... "[T]he
Legislature amended section 34.001 to state that dormancy did not apply to
child support judgments." ... "We adopt the reasoning in Holmes, and hold
that section 34.001(c) is not unconstitutionally retroactive...
Summary
The case clarifies that the 10-year limitation in §157.005(b) applies only
when a party seeks a cumulative money judgment under §157.263; it does
not bar other enforcement tools (withholding, liens). It also confirms that
judgment dormancy does not apply to child support judgments under
§34.001(c).

To alleviate pressure on an overburdened court system, the Legislature
allows judges in civil proceedings to refer cases to associate judges for

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
disposition of a variety of case-related matters, including trials on the
merits. Referral is not binding on the parties, so if either party timely
objects, the referring court ‘shall hear the trial on the merits or preside at a
jury trial.’ Barring an objection, however, the associate judge may determine

days." ... "Trial on the merits before an associate judge is not compulsory
under our civil referral statutes and may be avoided if a party objects:

the merits is any final adjudication from which an appeal may be taken to a

Summary
The passages explain when and how a district court may refer a trial on the
merits to an associate judge, the parties’ right to object, and the mechanism
and timing for a de novo hearing request under Family Code § 201.015. They
do not address OAG intervention mechanics, signature mismatches, or
enforcement pleading requirements. They are relevant to whether an
associate judge could conduct a merits proceeding and what remedies exist
(objection or de novo) if a party challenges that process.
Rodrigues v. Alvara, 14-24-00625-CV (Tex. App. Aug 12, 2025)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Our sister court held that the OAG’s standing and authority to become
involved in child support enforcement is addressed in the Texas Family Code
and the agency’s standing and authority is well-settled... We agree with our
sister court. See Tex. Fam. Code § 231.101(a) (providing that the OAG, as
the State of Texas’ Title IV-D agency, may provide all services required for
enforcement of child support, medical support, and dental support orders).
The same is true for the authority of AAGs to appear on behalf of the OAG.
See id., § 231.109(a) ('Attorneys employed by the Title IV-D agency may
represent this state or another state in an action brought under the
authority of federal law or this chapter.'). ... Because the statutory authority
of the OAG and its AAGs to become involved in child support actions is well-
settled, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it
denied Rodrigues’ Rule 12 motion to show authority." "And... the OAG’s
statutory standing and authority to become involved in child support cases is
not impacted by the fact that the case may have originated as a custody
case.

=== PAGE 12 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
The opinion reaffirms that the OAG, as the Title IV-D agency, has broad
statutory standing to intervene in and litigate child support issues, and its
employed attorneys may appear without needing additional sworn
assignments in the case file. It also indicates that a case’s origin (e.g.,
custody) doesn’t negate OAG authority when support is at issue. This bears
on objections to OAG intervention, claims of ultra vires participation, and
Rule 12 show-authority challenges like those raised here.
Office of the Attorney Gen. of Tex. v. Moore, NO. 14-18-00607-CV (Tex. App.
Nov 26, 2019)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Title IV-D of the Social Security Act requires states to provide services for
the enforcement of child support obligations... In Texas, the OAG is
designated to provide these Title IV-D services, including collecting and
distributing child support payments and enforcing child support orders." "An
application for child support services constitutes an assignment of support
rights to enable the Title IV-D agency to establish and enforce child support
obligations." "We conclude the allegations in the OAG's first amended
petition, considered with the relevant Family Code provisions, are sufficient
to confer standing on the OAG." "Raphael did not name the OAG as a party
to the 2016 proceeding, and the OAG has not cited a statute, rule, or case
requiring the OAG be served with process in this context. Under the plain
text of Texas Family Code section 102.009, we conclude that service of
process on the OAG was not required." "To show its entitlement to notice
under section 102.009(d), the OAG had to prove a support right that was the
subject of the 2016 proceeding had been assigned to the OAG under
Chapter 231 before or during the 2016 proceeding.
Summary
The case confirms OAG’s Title IV-D authority and standing when support
rights are assigned (e.g., via application or public assistance). It also
clarifies that OAG is not automatically entitled to service; entitlement to
notice under § 102.009(d) depends on proof that support rights were
assigned to OAG before or during the proceeding.

TEX. FAM. CODE. ANN. § 201.101(d) (West, Westlaw 2017 through 1st C.S.);
Office of the Attorney General of Tex. v. C.W.H., 531 S.W.3d 183 (Tex. 2017).
An associate judge of a IV-D court may refer a complex case back to a
referring court. Id. § 201.104(a) (West, Westlaw 2017through 1st C.S.). An
associate judge may not issue a final judgment. Id. § 201.104(b). But if the
associate judge's recommended order is not appealed to the referring court,
the associate judge's order becomes final at that time." "J.C.C. invokes the
statutory procedures in the family code that include a de novo review by the
referring court... Associate judges are creatures of statute and are not
vested with the authority to render a final order under the Texas
Constitution." "Court 7 was the court of continuing, exclusive jurisdiction
and had the authority... to render judgment on the child support arrearage
and sanctions.
Summary
The case confirms: (1) OAG interventions in counties with IV-D courts
trigger automatic transfer to the IV-D court; (2) associate judges cannot
render final judgments but their recommended orders become final if not
appealed de novo to the referring court; (3) the court of continuing,
exclusive jurisdiction retains authority to render arrears judgments; and (4)
procedural challenges must be preserved. This bears on claims that an
associate judge’s order is “facially void” solely because it wasn’t adopted by
a district judge—if no timely de novo request/appeal was made, the
associate judge’s recommended order can become final by operation of
statute.
In re G.S.G., 145 S.W.3d 351 (Tex. App. 2004)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The trial court dismissed the action after it found sua sponte that the
underlying order establishing the parent-child relationship was void and
unenforceable because it was in the form of a final order and had been
signed by a child support master rather than a district court judge. ... We
reverse and remand." ... "In contrast, when no notice of appeal is filed, the
recommendation of a child support master becomes the final order of the
court by operation of law without ratification by the referring court. Tex.
Fam.Code Ann. § 201.1041(a)." ... "The Family Code requires a master to
inform the parties of the right but provides that such notice may be given by
oral pronouncement or in writing. ... Because the Family Code does not
require written notice, we find that a proposed order need not contain a
notice of the right to appeal.

=== PAGE 14 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
The case holds that a child support master’s proposed order can be in the
form of an order and need not contain “recommendation” language or
written appeal notice; if no appeal is taken, it becomes the court’s final
order by operation of law without district judge signature under former §
201.1041(a). Thus, a trial court errs by treating such an order as void solely
because it was signed by a master and not adopted by the district judge,
except for contempt/incarceration scenarios requiring judge signature.
In re A.A.R.
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Second, appellant questions the OAG's standing, in a myriad of ways, to
initiate a suit to determine parentage, set child support, and collect same
from delinquent parents. Texas statute provides it with the requisite
standing. See TEX. FAM. CODE ANN. § 231.001...; § 102.007...; §
231.101..." ... "Third, appellant questions the trial court's subject matter
jurisdiction... When the OAG sues in a county that has a Title IV-D court...
such cases are automatically transferred to the Title IV-D court. TEX. FAM.
CODE. ANN. § 201.101(d)... And though the associate judge assigned to the
Title IV-D court may not issue a final judgment, id. § 201.104(b), if its

at that time." ... "Fifth, Webb next complains of the OAG's failure to comply
with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 17(a)(1). Federal rules of court
procedure do not regulate proceedings transpiring in Texas state courts.
Summary
The case confirms OAG’s statutory authority to initiate/support child-
support-related actions, explains the Title IV-D transfer and associate judge
framework, and clarifies that associate judge recommendations become final
absent a timely appeal to the referring court. It does not address signature
mismatches, specific notice defects, or the necessity of a written order of
referral in the particular case described.

merits of the case. ... However, if the master's order was not appealed, and
the order did not involve enforcement by contempt or immediate

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
incarceration, the master's order became the order of the court without
ratification by the district judge after the time for appeal to the district court
passed. ... Any appeal to the district court was required to be filed within
three days of the party receiving notice of the substance of the master's
order. ... However, nothing in the statute makes an agreed order signed after
the three-day period void. ... Accordingly, the trial court's failure to sign the
agreed order within three days of filing with the district clerk did not make
the order void. ... In 2003, the Texas Legislature changed the title of a child
support master to associate judge. ... Section 233.024 of the family code
provided '[i]f the court finds that all parties have appropriately agreed to a
child support review order and that there is waiver of service, the court shall
sign the order not later than the third day after the filing of the order.'
Summary
The passages explain that while a master (associate judge) could not
independently render a final order on the merits, an unappealed master’s
order (not involving contempt/incarceration) became the court’s order
without district judge ratification once the short appeal window expired.
They also clarify that statutory deadlines (e.g., three-day signing under §
233.024) are not jurisdictional—missing them does not render an order void.

the case. ... Section 201.007(a)(14)(C) provides that an associate judge may,

Summary
The passage clarifies (1) associate judges in Title IV-D cannot render final
judgments but can recommend orders; unappealed recommended orders
become final; (2) associate judges can render temporary orders that are
enforceable without de novo if no timely request; (3) finality depends on
whether the order is a recommended final order versus a temporary order.
This bears on claims that an associate judge’s action is “void” for lack of

adoption; if it’s a recommended final order not timely appealed de novo, it

Tex. Fam. Code § 201.006 Tex. Fam. Code § 201.006 Order of Referral
Extract
In referring a case to an associate judge, the judge of the referring court
shall render: an individual order of referral; or a general order of referral
specifying the class and type of cases to be heard by the associate judge.
The order of referral may limit the power or duties of an associate judge.
Summary
The statute requires a referral order—either case-specific or a standing
general order—before an associate judge may hear a matter. If no order of
referral exists, actions by the associate judge may be vulnerable to
challenge for lack of authority. The passage does not address adoption by
the district judge or arrears confirmation, but it establishes the referral
requirement that underpins the validity of associate judge proceedings.
Tex. Fam. Code § 201.007 Tex. Fam. Code § 201.007 Powers of Associate
Judge
Extract
Except as limited by an order of referral, an associate judge may: ... without
prejudice to the right to a de novo hearing before the referring court under
Section 201.015 and subject to Subsection (c), render and sign: (A) a final
order agreed to in writing as to both form and substance by all parties; (B) a
final default order; (C) a temporary order; or (D) a final order in a case in
which a party files an unrevoked waiver..."; "A final order described by
Subsection (a) becomes final after the expiration of the period described by
Section 201.015(a) if a party does not request a de novo hearing... An order
described by Subsection (a) or that is rendered and signed by an associate
judge constitutes an order of the referring court.
Summary
The statute authorizes associate judges to render and sign certain final
orders (including agreed, default, temporary, or waiver-based finals) and
provides that such orders become final and constitute orders of the referring
court if no timely de novo request is made under § 201.015. It frames the
authority "except as limited by an order of referral," indicating that a
limiting or absent referral could constrain authority. It does not, by itself,
address signature mismatches or OAG attorney appearance formalities, nor

Tex. Fam. Code § 201.104 Tex. Fam. Code § 201.104 Powers of Associate
Judge
Extract
An associate judge may render and sign any order that is not a final order on
the merits of the case. An associate judge may recommend to the referring
court any order after a trial on the merits. Only the referring court may hear
and render an order on a motion for postjudgment relief... Notwithstanding
Subsection (d)... an associate judge may hear and render an order on any
matter necessary to be decided in connection with a Title IV-D service,
including: a suit to modify or clarify an existing child support order; a
motion to enforce a child support order... a motion for postjudgment relief...
if neither party has requested a de novo hearing before the referring court;
a suit affecting the parent-child relationship; and a suit for modification
under Chapter 156.
Summary
(1) associate judges may sign non-final orders; (2) after a merits trial, they
may only recommend orders to the referring court; and (3) in Title IV-D
matters, they may render orders necessary to Title IV-D services, including
certain postjudgment matters, unless a de novo hearing is requested. This
bears on whether a prior child support order must be adopted by the district
(referring) court to be a final, enforceable order, and whether an associate
judge could independently confirm arrears or render final relief.
Tex. Fam. Code § 201.014 Tex. Fam. Code § 201.014 Judicial Action On
Associate Judge's Proposed Order Or Judgment
Extract
Except as otherwise provided in this subchapter, unless a party files a
written request for a de novo hearing before the referring court, the
referring court may: adopt, modify, or reject the associate judge's proposed
order or judgment; hear further evidence; or recommit the matter to the
associate judge for further proceedings. (b) Regardless of whether a party
files a written request for a de novo hearing before the referring court, a
proposed order or judgment rendered by an associate judge in a suit filed by
the Department of Family and Protective Services that meets the
requirements of Section FAMILY CODE 263.401(d) is considered a final
order for purposes of Section FAMILY CODE 263.401.

=== PAGE 18 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
The statute clarifies how the referring court treats an associate judge’s
proposed order: the court must take action (adopt/modify/reject, hear more
evidence, or recommit) unless a de novo request alters the process. It also
establishes a narrow exception where certain DFPS proposed orders are
deemed final without adoption for § 263.401 purposes. Outside that DFPS
exception, associate judge proposed orders are not self-executing final
orders until acted upon by the referring court.
Tex. Fam. Code § 201.005 Tex. Fam. Code § 201.005 Cases that May Be
Referred
Extract
(a) Except as provided by this section, a judge of a court may refer to an
associate judge any aspect of a suit or action... (b) Unless a party files a
written objection to the associate judge hearing a trial on the merits, the
judge may refer the trial to the associate judge. A trial on the merits is any
final adjudication from which an appeal may be taken to a court of appeals.
(c) A party must file an objection to an associate judge hearing a trial on the
merits or presiding at a jury trial not later than the 10th day after the date
the party receives notice that the associate judge will hear the trial. If an
objection is filed, the referring court shall hear the trial on the merits or
preside at a jury trial. (d) The requirements of Subsections (b) and (c) shall
apply whenever a judge has authority to refer the trial of a suit or action
described by Subsection (a) to an associate judge, master, or other assistant
judge regardless of whether the assistant judge is appointed under this
subchapter.
Summary
The section establishes that a judge may refer matters, including trials on
the merits, to an associate judge; parties have a right to object within 10
days after notice that the associate judge will hear the trial. If a timely
objection is filed, the referring court must hear the trial. It does not itself
address the need for or form of a written order of referral, nor adoption by
the district judge. It informs whether an associate judge could hear a trial
absent objection and frames a potential procedural objection if proper notice
was given and a timely objection made.
Tex. Fam. Code § 201.013 Tex. Fam. Code § 201.013 Order of Court
Extract
Pending a de novo hearing before the referring court, a proposed order or
judgment of the associate judge is in full force and effect and is enforceable
as an order or judgment of the referring court, except for an order providing

=== PAGE 19 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
for the appointment of a receiver. (b) Except as provided by Section FAMILY
CODE 201.007(c), if a request for a de novo hearing before the referring
court is not timely filed, the proposed order or judgment of the associate
judge becomes the order or judgment of the referring court only on the
referring court's signing the proposed order or judgment.
Summary
The statute establishes two key rules: (1) an associate judge’s proposed
order is enforceable immediately pending any timely de novo request; and
(2) if no timely de novo is requested, the proposed order becomes the
referring court’s order only when the referring court signs it. Thus, absent
referring-court signature after the de novo window closes, the proposed
order does not become the district court’s order. This bears on whether
arrears can be “confirmed” on a proposed order that was never signed/
adopted by the district judge.
Tex. Fam. Code § 231.109 Tex. Fam. Code § 231.109 Attorneys Representing
State
Extract
(a) Attorneys employed by the Title IV-D agency may represent this state or
another state in an action brought under the authority of federal law or this
chapter. ... (d) An attorney employed to provide Title IV-D services
represents the interest of the state and not the interest of any other party....
(e) An attorney employed by the Title IV-D agency or as otherwise provided
by this chapter may not be appointed or act as an amicus attorney or
attorney ad litem for a child or another party. (f) An attorney employed to
provide Title IV-D services may, without notice to the parties, represent the
Title IV-D agency at a court proceeding in an action brought under this title.
Summary
- The statute authorizes OAG Title IV-D attorneys to represent the State in
Title IV-D actions (§ 231.109(a)). - It clarifies they represent the State, not
private parties, and no attorney-client relationship arises with the CP/NCP (§
231.109(d)). - It bars them from serving as amicus/ad litem (§ 231.109(e)). -
Critically, it permits a Title IV-D attorney to appear and represent the agency
at a court proceeding “without notice to the parties” in actions under this
title (§ 231.109(f)). This bears on objections to which named OAG lawyer
appears or whether a separate appearance/notice was required for a
different OAG attorney (e.g., Choya Burkley) to attend and seek arrears
confirmation.
Tex. Fam. Code § 201.101 Tex. Fam. Code § 201.101 Authority of Presiding
Judge

=== PAGE 20 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
Except as provided under Subsection (e), if an associate judge is appointed
for a court under this subchapter, all Title IV-D cases shall be referred to the
associate judge by a general order for each county issued by the judge of the
court for which the associate judge is appointed, or, in the absence of that
order, by a general order issued by the presiding judge who appointed the
associate judge. Referral of Title IV-D cases may not be made for individual
cases or case by case.
Summary
The statute requires Title IV-D cases to be referred to an associate judge via
a standing/general order, not by case-specific referral. If an associate judge
rendered orders without a valid general order of referral in place (and
without adoption by the district judge as otherwise required in Chapter
201), that may implicate the validity of the associate judge’s actions. The
provision does not address OAG appearance signatures or pleading
mismatches but does speak to the necessary mechanism for an associate
judge to exercise authority in Title IV-D matters.
