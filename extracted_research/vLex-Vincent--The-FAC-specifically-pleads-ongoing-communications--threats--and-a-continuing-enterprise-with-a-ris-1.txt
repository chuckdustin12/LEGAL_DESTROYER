Question
The FAC specifically pleads ongoing communications, threats, and a
continuing enterprise with a risk of further predicate acts, and requests
leave to amend to add new facts if necessary. At the Rule 12(b)(6) stage, the
court must accept all well-pleaded factual allegations as true and draw all
reasonable inferences in the plaintiff’s favor (George v. Urban Settlement
Servs., 833 F.3d 1242, 1248 (10th Cir. 2016)). The court erred by
characterizing ongoing conduct as unrelated or merely retaliatory, rather
than crediting the FAC’s specific allegations that these acts are part of the
same enterprise and serve the same fraudulent purpose. The court should
have allowed the case to proceed to discovery, or at minimum, granted leave
to amend. 
Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
At the Rule 12(b)(6) stage, the court was required to accept the FAC’s well-
pleaded allegations of ongoing communications, threats, and a continuing
enterprise as true and to draw all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff’s
favor; by dismissing the case based on its own characterization of the
conduct, the court erred and should have either allowed the case to proceed
to discovery or, at minimum, granted leave to amend. The authorities
provided uniformly support the proposition that such allegations, if
sufficiently pleaded, must be credited at this stage, especially in the context
of RICO claims.
Summary
The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, as interpreted by the Tenth Circuit and
district courts within its jurisdiction, require that at the motion to dismiss
stage, all well-pleaded factual allegations in a complaint must be accepted
as true and construed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. This
standard is particularly significant in RICO cases, where the continuity and
relatedness of alleged predicate acts are often central to the sufficiency of
the pleadings.
The court’s failure to credit the FAC’s specific allegations of ongoing
conduct as part of a single fraudulent enterprise, and its refusal to grant
leave to amend, contravened these well-established principles. The
authorities confirm that unless the complaint is wholly deficient, the plaintiff
should be permitted to proceed to discovery or be given an opportunity to
amend, especially where the complaint alleges a continuing risk of further
predicate acts and requests leave to supplement the pleadings.

Background and Relevant Law
Rule 12(b)(6) Standard
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) allows a defendant to move for
dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be
granted. The Tenth Circuit and district courts within its jurisdiction have
consistently held that, at this stage, the court must accept all well-pleaded
factual allegations as true, view them in the light most favorable to the
plaintiff, and draw all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff’s favor, as
articulated in Nunez v. N.M. Corr. Dep't, Civ. No. 19-63 KG/LF (D. N.M. Jun
05, 2019), Serna v. Webster, No. CIV 17-0020 JB/WPL (D. N.M. Sep 30,
2017), Church Mut. Ins. Co. v. Coutu, Civil Action No. 17-cv-00209-RM-NYW
(D. Colo. Sep 13, 2017), and Hunt v. Cent. Consol. Sch. Dist., 951 F. Supp. 2d
1136 (D. N.M. 2013). The sufficiency of a complaint is a question of law, and
the court’s review is limited to the four corners of the complaint.
To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual
matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its
face, as reaffirmed in DeVargas v. The Bd. of Cnty. Comm'rs for Santa Fe
Cnty. (D. N.M. Oct. 19, 2021).
RICO Pleading Requirements: Pattern, Continuity, and
Enterprise
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) requires a
plaintiff to plead a “pattern of racketeering activity,” which includes both a
“relationship” and a “continuity” element. The relationship element is
satisfied when the predicate acts are related by purpose, results,
participants, victims, or methods of commission, and are not isolated events.
The continuity element can be established either by a closed period of
repeated conduct or by conduct that projects into the future with a threat of
repetition, as explained in RECONCEIVING COERCION-BASED CRIMINAL
DEFENSES (2022) and RICO: A Primer (2022).
Continuity may be shown by either (1) a series of related predicate acts
extending over a substantial period of time (closed-ended continuity), or (2)
a threat of continuing criminal activity extending indefinitely into the future
(open-ended continuity), as further clarified in RICO: A Primer (2022) and 
Gotfredson v. Larsen Lp, 432 F.Supp.2d 1163 (D. Colo. 2006). The Supreme
Court’s decision in H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co. (referenced
in Purvis v. Hamwi, 828 F.Supp. 1479 (D. Colo. 1993)) is the foundational
authority for this interpretation.
Leave to Amend
When a complaint is found deficient, courts have discretion to grant leave to
amend rather than dismissing the action outright. This principle is especially
important in complex cases such as those involving RICO, where the factual
development may be ongoing and the plaintiff may be able to cure

deficiencies by adding new facts, as recognized in Meyer v. Cloud County
Bank & Trust, 647 F. Supp. 974 (D. Kan. 1986).
Analysis
The Rule 12(b)(6) Standard and Its Application
The authorities provided uniformly establish that, at the motion to dismiss
stage, the court’s role is not to weigh evidence or resolve factual disputes,
but to accept the plaintiff’s well-pleaded allegations as true and to draw all
reasonable inferences in the plaintiff’s favor. This standard is articulated in
numerous cases, including Nunez v. N.M. Corr. Dep't (D. N.M. Jun 05, 2019),
Serna v. Webster (D. N.M. Sep 30, 2017), Church Mut. Ins. Co. v. Coutu (D.
Colo. Sep 13, 2017), and Hunt v. Cent. Consol. Sch. Dist. (D. N.M. 2013). The
court is required to view the allegations in the light most favorable to the
plaintiff and to draw all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff’s favor.
In the context of the FAC’s allegations—ongoing communications, threats,
and a continuing enterprise with a risk of further predicate acts—the court
was required to accept these allegations as true and to consider whether, if
proven, they would establish a plausible claim for relief. The court’s decision
to characterize the ongoing conduct as unrelated or merely retaliatory,
rather than as part of a continuing enterprise, was inconsistent with this
standard. The authorities make clear that the court should not have
substituted its own factual conclusions for the plaintiff’s well-pleaded
allegations at this stage.
RICO’s Pattern and Continuity Requirements
The FAC’s allegations of ongoing communications, threats, and a continuing
enterprise with a risk of further predicate acts are directly relevant to the
RICO requirement of a “pattern of racketeering activity.” As explained in 
RECONCEIVING COERCION-BASED CRIMINAL DEFENSES (2022) and 
RICO: A Primer (2022), a pattern requires both a relationship among the
predicate acts and continuity—either a closed period of repeated conduct or
a threat of future repetition.
The authorities further clarify that open-ended continuity may be
established by showing that the predicate acts themselves involve a distinct
threat of long-term racketeering activity, or that they are a regular way of
conducting the defendant’s ongoing business or enterprise (Gotfredson v.
Larsen Lp, 432 F.Supp.2d 1163 (D. Colo. 2006); RICO: A Primer (2022)). The
FAC’s allegations of ongoing conduct and a risk of further predicate acts, if
accepted as true, are sufficient to plead open-ended continuity and thus a
pattern of racketeering activity.
The Supreme Court’s guidance, as cited in Purvis v. Hamwi, 828 F.Supp.
1479 (D. Colo. 1993), further supports the proposition that continuity can be
shown by either a closed period of repeated conduct or by conduct that
projects into the future with a threat of repetition. The FAC’s allegations of
ongoing threats and communications, as part of a continuing enterprise, are

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
precisely the type of allegations that courts have found sufficient to survive
a motion to dismiss in RICO cases.
The Court’s Error in Characterizing the Conduct
The court’s decision to characterize the ongoing conduct as unrelated or
merely retaliatory, rather than as part of a continuing enterprise serving the
same fraudulent purpose, was inconsistent with the authorities’ clear
guidance. The court was required to accept the FAC’s specific allegations as
true and to draw all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff’s favor, rather
than substituting its own factual conclusions at the pleading stage (Serna v.
Webster (D. N.M. Sep 30, 2017); Church Mut. Ins. Co. v. Coutu (D. Colo. Sep
13, 2017)).
In Watchous Enterprrises, LLC v. Pac. Nat'l Capital, LLC, Case No. 16-1432-
JTM (D. Kan. Jul 25, 2018), the court allowed the filing of a second amended
complaint where the proposed complaint pleaded with particularity the
communications underlying the alleged fraud and adequately identified the
defendants’ common purpose. The court found that the plaintiff’s claims
presented colorable claims under RICO, based on specific allegations of
predicate acts, and denied the motion to dismiss. This case is directly
analogous to the present situation, where the FAC specifically pleads
ongoing communications, threats, and a continuing enterprise.
Similarly, in Schrag v. Dinges, 788 F.Supp. 1543 (D. Kan. 1992), the court
found that the plaintiffs had sufficiently stated all the essential elements of a
RICO claim at the pre-discovery stage and emphasized that any deficiencies
should be addressed after the plaintiffs have had an opportunity to
substantiate their allegations through discovery. The court noted that the
burden is on the defendant to show that the plaintiffs will absolutely be
unable to prove their cause of action, a burden that is rarely met at the
pleading stage.
Leave to Amend
Even if the court found the FAC deficient in some respect, the authorities
make clear that the proper course is to grant leave to amend rather than
dismissing the action outright. In Meyer v. Cloud County Bank & Trust, 647
F. Supp. 974 (D. Kan. 1986), the court granted the plaintiff leave to amend to
correct deficiencies in the complaint, rather than dismissing the case. This
approach is particularly appropriate in complex cases such as those
involving RICO, where the plaintiff may be able to cure deficiencies by
adding new facts.
The FAC’s explicit request for leave to amend, if necessary, should have
been granted in accordance with this well-established principle. The court’s
failure to do so was inconsistent with the authorities’ guidance and deprived
the plaintiff of the opportunity to cure any deficiencies in the pleadings.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Synthesis
Taken together, the authorities provided establish a clear framework for
evaluating motions to dismiss in RICO cases. At the Rule 12(b)(6) stage, the
court must accept all well-pleaded factual allegations as true, draw all
reasonable inferences in the plaintiff’s favor, and consider whether the
allegations, if proven, would establish a plausible claim for relief. In the
context of RICO, allegations of ongoing communications, threats, and a
continuing enterprise with a risk of further predicate acts are sufficient to
plead a pattern of racketeering activity, particularly where the complaint
alleges open-ended continuity.
The court’s decision to dismiss the case based on its own characterization of
the conduct, rather than crediting the FAC’s specific allegations, was
inconsistent with these principles. The authorities further establish that,
even if the complaint is found deficient, the proper course is to grant leave
to amend rather than dismissing the action outright.
Exceptions and Caveats
While the authorities are uniform in their articulation of the Rule 12(b)(6)
standard and the requirements for pleading a RICO claim, it is important to
note that not every complaint will survive a motion to dismiss. The complaint
must contain sufficient factual matter to state a claim to relief that is
plausible on its face (DeVargas v. The Bd. of Cnty. Comm'rs for Santa Fe
Cnty. (D. N.M. Oct. 19, 2021)). Conclusory allegations or mere recitations of
the elements of a cause of action are insufficient.
However, the FAC in this scenario specifically pleads ongoing
communications, threats, and a continuing enterprise with a risk of further
predicate acts, and requests leave to amend to add new facts if necessary.
These allegations, if accepted as true, are sufficient to state a plausible
claim for relief under RICO, and the authorities confirm that the court
should have allowed the case to proceed to discovery or granted leave to
amend.
Conclusion
In sum, the authorities provided establish that, at the Rule 12(b)(6) stage,
the court must accept all well-pleaded factual allegations as true, draw all
reasonable inferences in the plaintiff’s favor, and consider whether the
allegations, if proven, would establish a plausible claim for relief. In the
context of RICO, allegations of ongoing communications, threats, and a
continuing enterprise with a risk of further predicate acts are sufficient to
plead a pattern of racketeering activity. The court’s decision to dismiss the
case based on its own characterization of the conduct, rather than crediting
the FAC’s specific allegations, was inconsistent with these principles. At a
minimum, the court should have granted leave to amend to allow the
plaintiff to cure any deficiencies in the pleadings. The authorities uniformly
support the proposition that the case should have been allowed to proceed

to discovery or, at minimum, the plaintiff should have been granted leave to
amend.

Summary
The passage from Meyer v. Cloud County Bank & Trust indicates that when
a complaint is found deficient, rather than dismissing it outright, the court
may grant the plaintiff leave to amend the complaint to address the
deficiencies. This aligns with the proposition that the court should allow the
case to proceed or at least permit amendment if the complaint is not
sufficiently detailed. The passage supports the idea that courts should
provide plaintiffs an opportunity to amend their complaints to meet the
necessary legal standards, especially in complex cases involving allegations

Extract
The court hereby grants leave for the filing of the Second Amended
Complaint. The proposed complaint pleads with particularity the

Summary
The court in this case allowed the filing of a Second Amended Complaint,
recognizing that the complaint adequately identified a common purpose and
a pattern of activity under RICO. The court emphasized the need to accept
well-pleaded allegations as true and to allow the case to proceed when
colorable claims are presented. This supports the proposition that the court
should have credited the FAC’s specific allegations and allowed the case to
proceed or granted leave to amend.
Schrag v. Dinges, 788 F.Supp. 1543 (D. Kan. 1992)
U.S. District Court — District of Kansas
Extract
In each of the above three counts, the plaintiffs allege that Youngers'
involvement in the fraudulent schemes caused the plaintiffs economic injury.
The court finds that the plaintiffs have sufficiently stated all the essential
elements of a RICO claim at this pre-discovery stage. In raising a 12(b)(6)
motion, defendant Youngers faces a heavy burden of showing that the
plaintiffs will absolutely be unable to prove their cause of action. See Conley,
355 U.S. at 45-46, 78 S.Ct. at 101-02. Defendant has not persuaded the court
that such is the case here. Mindful of the defendant's heavy burden, the
court dismisses defendant Youngers' motion to dismiss for failure to state a
claim. Any deficiencies in the plaintiffs' case should more appropriately be
brought up by summary judgment motions after the plaintiffs have had an
opportunity to substantiate their allegations through discovery.
Summary
At the pre-discovery stage, the court must accept the plaintiff's allegations
as true and that the burden is on the defendant to show that the plaintiff
cannot possibly prove their case. The court in this case found that the
plaintiffs had sufficiently stated a RICO claim and that any deficiencies
should be addressed after discovery. This supports the proposition that the
court should allow the case to proceed to discovery or grant leave to amend,
rather than dismissing it prematurely.

referring either to a closed period of repeated conduct, or to past conduct
that by its nature projects into the future with the threat of repetition.
Summary
Continuity can be shown through either a closed period of repeated conduct
or conduct that projects into the future with a threat of repetition. This
supports the proposition that the FAC's allegations of ongoing
communications and threats could establish a pattern of racketeering
activity, which the court should have considered at the Rule 12(b)(6) stage.

RECONCEIVING COERCION-BASED CRIMINAL DEFENSES.
Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology - Northwestern University,
School of Law - Galoob, Stephen R. - 2022-03-22
Extract
The inquiry here is meant to invoke the 'pattern of racketeering activity'
element of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).
The Organized Crime Control Act (1970), which includes RICO, provides that
'criminal conduct forms a pattern if it embraces criminal acts that have the
same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of
commission, or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics
and are not isolated events.' The Supreme Court characterized this
requirement as a 'relationship' element and held that the statute further
requires a 'continuity' element, 'referring either to a closed period of
repeated conduct, or to past conduct that by its nature projects into the
future with a threat of repetition.'
Summary
The RICO Act requires a "pattern of racketeering activity," which includes a
"relationship" and "continuity" element. This supports the proposition that
ongoing communications, threats, and a continuing enterprise with a risk of
further predicate acts can be part of a RICO claim. The passage emphasizes
that criminal acts must be interrelated and not isolated, aligning with the
proposition that the court should have considered the FAC's allegations as
part of the same enterprise.
RICO: A Primer

=== PAGE 13 ===

Extract
The continuity requirement is likewise satisfied where the predicates are a
regular way of conducting the defendant's ongoing legitimate business (in
the sense that it is not a business that exists for criminal purposes), or of
conducting or participating in an ongoing and legitimate RICO 'enterprise.'
A plaintiff may demonstrate a pattern by establishment that the predicate
acts pose a threat of continued criminal activity, which is generally
demonstrated by showing either: * Closed-ended continuity. Proving 'a series
of related predicate acts extending over a substantial period of time.' *
Open-ended continuity. A threat of 'continuing criminal activity extending
indefinitely into the future,' in light of the nature of the enterprise and
predicate acts alleged.
Summary
The passage explains the concept of continuity in RICO cases, which can be
satisfied by demonstrating either closed-ended or open-ended continuity.
This supports the proposition that the FAC's allegations of ongoing
communications, threats, and a continuing enterprise with a risk of further
predicate acts could establish a pattern of racketeering activity. The passage
also supports the idea that the court should have considered the FAC's
allegations as part of a continuing enterprise rather than dismissing them as
unrelated or retaliatory.
RICO: A Primer
Extract
The continuity requirement is likewise satisfied where the predicates are a
regular way of conducting the defendant's ongoing legitimate business (in
the sense that it is not a business that exists for criminal purposes), or of
conducting or participating in an ongoing and legitimate RICO 'enterprise.'
A plaintiff may demonstrate a pattern by establishment that the predicate
acts pose a threat of continued criminal activity, which is generally
demonstrated by showing either: * Closed-ended continuity. Proving 'a series
of related predicate acts extending over a substantial period of time.' *
Open-ended continuity. A threat of 'continuing criminal activity extending
indefinitely into the future,' in light of the nature of the enterprise and
predicate acts alleged.
Summary
The continuity requirement for RICO can be satisfied by demonstrating
either closed-ended or open-ended continuity. This supports the proposition
that the FAC's allegations of ongoing communications, threats, and a
continuing enterprise with a risk of further predicate acts could establish a
pattern of racketeering activity. The passage also supports the idea that the

court should have credited the FAC's specific allegations and allowed the
case to proceed to discovery or granted leave to amend.
