Question
If requesting service by U.S. Marshals and filing in Oklahoma federal court,
how can service be effected on defendants located in Texas and Oklahoma?
Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
When requesting service by U.S. Marshals for a case filed in Oklahoma
federal court, service can be effected on defendants located in both Texas
and Oklahoma through court order upon plaintiff's request. The U.S.
Marshals can serve process nationwide, allowing them to serve defendants
in both Oklahoma and Texas, subject to specific procedural requirements
and circumstances outlined in Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
Summary
Service by U.S. Marshals for defendants located in Texas and Oklahoma in a
case filed in Oklahoma federal court is governed by Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure, specific federal statutes, and procedural requirements. U.S.
Marshals are not automatically authorized to serve defendants in every civil
action but may do so upon court order at the plaintiff's request, particularly
in certain circumstances such as when a party is proceeding in forma
pauperis, on behalf of a seaman, on behalf of the United States or its officers
or agencies, or when specifically ordered by the court. When service by U.S.
Marshals is authorized, the plaintiff must complete Form No. 285 ("U.S.
Marshals Service Process Receipt and Return") and provide all necessary
information regarding the defendants.
The service process for defendants in both Oklahoma and Texas follows
similar procedures but is governed by different jurisdictional principles. For
defendants located within Oklahoma (the same state as the filing court),
service can be effected directly by the U.S. Marshal within the territorial
limits of the state. For defendants in Texas, service can still be accomplished
by U.S. Marshals through several mechanisms: under 28 U.S.C. § 3004 which
allows service in any state for certain proceedings; by forwarding the
process to another judicial district for service as permitted by 28 U.S.C. §
1921; or through methods authorized by state law where service is being
effected, as allowed by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4. These provisions
collectively enable effective service across state lines when properly
requested and ordered by the court.

Background and Relevant Law
Federal Statutory Framework for Service by U.S. Marshals
The service of process by U.S. Marshals in federal courts is governed by
several key statutory provisions and procedural rules that establish both the
authority for service and the methods by which it can be accomplished
across state lines.
Authority for Nationwide Service
A fundamental principle enabling service on defendants in different states is
found in 28 U.S.C. § 3004, which provides: "Except as provided in paragraph
-(A) any writ, order, judgment, or other process, including a summons and
complaint, filed under this chapter may be served in any State; and (B) such
writ, order, or judgment may be enforced by the court issuing the writ,
order, or process, regardless of where the person is served with the writ,
order, or process." This statutory provision explicitly allows for nationwide
service of process and enforcement, meaning that process issued by an
Oklahoma federal court can be served on defendants located in Texas.
Similarly, 11 U.S.C. Rule 7004, though primarily applicable to bankruptcy
proceedings, affirms the principle of nationwide service: "A summons and
complaint (and all other process, except a subpoena) may be served
anywhere within the United States." This further supports the concept that
federal courts can authorize service beyond their territorial jurisdiction
when appropriate statutory authority exists.
Rules Governing Service by U.S. Marshals
The role and authority of U.S. Marshals in serving process is specifically
addressed in 28 U.S.C. Rule 4.1, which states: "Process-other than a
summons under Rule 4 or a subpoena under Rule 45-must be served by a
United States marshal or deputy marshal or by a person specially appointed
for that purpose. It may be served anywhere within the territorial limits of
the state where the district court is located and, if authorized by a federal
statute, beyond those limits."
This rule establishes two key principles: (1) certain types of process must be
served by U.S. Marshals or their deputies, and (2) such service is generally
limited to the territorial limits of the state where the district court is located
unless a federal statute authorizes service beyond those limits. For our
question concerning service in Texas when the court is in Oklahoma, this
means that service by U.S. Marshals across state lines requires proper
statutory authorization.
Cross-District Service and Fees
For situations requiring service in a different judicial district, such as
serving defendants in Texas from an Oklahoma federal court, 28 U.S.C. §

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
1921 provides a relevant mechanism: "The United States marshals or deputy
marshals shall routinely collect, and a court may tax as costs, fees for the
following: ... (C) Forwarding any writ, order, or process to another judicial
district for service." This provision explicitly acknowledges and authorizes
the practice of forwarding process to another judicial district for service,
establishing a procedural pathway for cross-district service by U.S.
Marshals.
Alternative Methods of Service
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4, as referenced in 28 U.S.C. Rule 4,
provides flexibility in how service can be effected. The rule states: "The
amendment of the first sentence inserting the word 'thereunder' supports
the original intention that the 'order of court' must be authorized by a
specific United States statute. ... The second sentence, added by
amendment, expressly allows resort in original Federal actions to the
procedures provided by State law for effecting service on nonresident
parties (as well as on domiciliaries not found within the State)."
This rule further explains: "If the circumstances of a particular case satisfy
the applicable Federal law (first sentence of Rule 4(e), as amended) and the
applicable State law (second sentence), the party seeking to make the
service may proceed under the Federal or the State law, at his option." This
provision creates important flexibility in that it allows parties to utilize
either federal procedures or those established by state law when effecting
service, including service on out-of-state defendants.
Administrative Decisions and Secondary Materials
Several administrative decisions and secondary materials provide additional
guidance on the practical implementation of service by U.S. Marshals across
state lines.
Circumstances Requiring U.S. Marshal Service
The Federal Litigation Procedure materials consistently outline the specific
circumstances under which the U.S. Marshal is authorized to effect service.
According to Federal Litigation Procedure (2023-05-01): "The U.S. Marshal
is not authorized to serve defendants in every civil action. A marshal is
authorized to effect service upon the court's order at the plaintiff's request.
The court must order service by U.S. Marshal in the following
circumstances: 1. On behalf of a party proceeding in forma pauperis; 2. On
behalf of a seaman pursuant to Title 8 U.S.C. §1916; 3. On behalf of the
United States or one of its officers or agencies; or 4. Upon order of the
court."
This guidance, consistently repeated across multiple years of the Federal
Litigation Procedure documents (2019-2023), establishes that service by
U.S. Marshals is not automatic but requires either a court order or one of
the specified statutory circumstances.

Procedural Requirements for U.S. Marshal Service
The Federal Litigation Procedure materials also outline specific procedural
requirements that must be followed when requesting service by U.S.
Marshals. As stated in Federal Litigation Procedure (2023-05-01): "When
utilizing the services of the U.S. Marshal, be sure to provide the marshal
with all pertinent information regarding the defendant. Obtain and complete
Form No. 285, 'U.S. Marshals Service Process Receipt and Return' to the
best of your ability and contact the marshal's office in advance to verify the
cost of service, as service costs vary depending on the types of service and
number of defendants to be served. The marshal will complete the lower
portion of Form No. 285 after service has been accomplished (Fed.R.Civ.P.
4(c))."
These procedural guidelines are essential for properly initiating service by
U.S. Marshals and apply regardless of whether the defendants are located
within Oklahoma or in Texas.
Service on Corporate Defendants
For corporate defendants specifically, United States v. ABS Staffing Sols.,
LLC, 21 OCAHO no. 1632a (2025-02-13) provides relevant guidance:
"Service may also be effected by any method identified in Rule 4(e), which
allows any method allowed by the state law of the state in which the district
court is located or in which service is effected. Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(h)(A), 4(e)."
This decision further explains that service on corporations can be effected
by "delivering a copy of... the complaint to an officer, a managing or general
agent, or any other agent authorized by appointment or by law to receive
service of process...." This guidance is particularly valuable when serving
corporate defendants located in either Oklahoma or Texas.
Nationwide Service Provisions
Some secondary materials shed light on the broader context of nationwide
service provisions. As noted in Transnational litigation and personal
jurisdiction over foreign defendants (1996-06-22): "Some of these statutes
provide for 'nationwide' and 'worldwide' service of process... Unless
otherwise indicated, courts will read statutes containing such service
provisions as including an authorization for a national contacts test... After
all, 'if Congress can authorize personal jurisdiction over persons anywhere
in the United States, it can also authorize personal jurisdiction based on
contacts of foreign defendants with the entire United States.'"
While this source is older and primarily focused on foreign defendants, it
reinforces the principle that statutory provisions for nationwide service are
interpreted broadly by courts to facilitate service across jurisdictional
boundaries within the United States.

Analysis
Service on Defendants Located in Oklahoma
For defendants located within Oklahoma (the same state as the filing court),
the process for service by U.S. Marshals is relatively straightforward. Under
28 U.S.C. Rule 4.1, U.S. Marshals are authorized to serve process "anywhere
within the territorial limits of the state where the district court is located."
Since the court is located in Oklahoma, U.S. Marshals can directly serve
defendants within Oklahoma without additional jurisdictional hurdles.
The key requirement for such service is obtaining court authorization. As
consistently outlined in the Federal Litigation Procedure materials, the U.S.
Marshal is "authorized to effect service upon the court's order at the
plaintiff's request." This authorization can come through several pathways:
The plaintiff is proceeding in forma pauperis
The plaintiff is a seaman proceeding under 8 U.S.C. § 1916
The plaintiff is the United States or one of its officers/agencies
The court specifically orders such service
Once authorized, the plaintiff must complete Form No. 285 ("U.S. Marshals
Service Process Receipt and Return") with all pertinent information about
the defendant and verify the cost of service with the marshal's office in
advance.
For corporate defendants in Oklahoma, service can be effected by delivering
the complaint to "an officer, a managing or general agent, or any other agent
authorized by appointment or by law to receive service of process," as noted
in United States v. ABS Staffing Sols., LLC, 21 OCAHO no. 1632a
(2025-02-13).
Service on Defendants Located in Texas
Serving defendants located in Texas presents additional considerations since
it involves cross-state service. However, several statutory provisions and
procedural mechanisms make this possible:
Nationwide Service Authority: Under 28 U.S.C. § 3004, "any writ,
order, judgment, or other process, including a summons and complaint,
filed under this chapter may be served in any State." This provision
explicitly authorizes nationwide service for certain federal proceedings,
allowing an Oklahoma federal court to issue process that can be served
in Texas.
Cross-District Service: 28 U.S.C. § 1921 specifically authorizes
"forwarding any writ, order, or process to another judicial district for
service." This means that the U.S. Marshal in the Oklahoma district can
forward the process to the U.S. Marshal in the appropriate Texas
district for service on defendants located there.

State Law Methods: As outlined in 28 U.S.C. Rule 4 and reinforced in 
United States v. ABS Staffing Sols., LLC, 21 OCAHO no. 1632a
(2025-02-13), service can also be effected by "any method allowed by
the state law of the state in which the district court is located or in
which service is effected." This means that service on Texas defendants
could follow either Oklahoma state law methods or Texas state law
methods, providing additional flexibility.
Service by Certified Mail: For certain types of actions, such as those
involving U.S. officers or employees, 28 U.S.C. § 1391 notes that
"delivery of the summons and complaint to the officer or agency as
required by the rules may be made by certified mail beyond the
territorial limits of the district in which the action is brought." While
this provision is specific to certain types of defendants, it illustrates
another method by which service across state lines can be
accomplished.
The procedural requirements for requesting such service remain the same
as for in-state service: the plaintiff must obtain court authorization (either
through one of the mandatory circumstances or by specific court order),
complete Form No. 285 with all relevant information, and coordinate with
the marshal's office regarding costs and logistics.
Practical Implementation
From a practical standpoint, implementing service by U.S. Marshals on
defendants in different states requires careful attention to both procedural
requirements and jurisdictional considerations:
Obtaining Court Authorization: The first step is to request and
obtain court authorization for service by U.S. Marshals. This can come
through qualifying under one of the mandatory circumstances (in forma
pauperis status, seaman status, or U.S. government status) or by filing
a motion requesting the court to specifically order such service.
Preparing Form No. 285: Once authorization is obtained, the plaintiff
must complete Form No. 285 for each defendant to be served. As noted
in Federal Litigation Procedure (2023-05-01), this form should include
"all pertinent information regarding the defendant" to facilitate
successful service.
Coordinating with Marshal's Office: The plaintiff should contact the
marshal's office in advance to verify the cost of service, as these costs
"vary depending on the types of service and number of defendants to be
served." This coordination is particularly important when service
involves multiple districts.
Method of Service for Out-of-State Defendants: For defendants in
Texas, the plaintiff should specify whether service will be accomplished
through:

Forwarding to another judicial district under 28 U.S.C. § 1921
State law methods from either Oklahoma or Texas
Documentation of Service: After service is completed, the U.S.
Marshal will complete the lower portion of Form No. 285 as
confirmation of service, providing the necessary documentation for the
court record.
Service on Different Types of Defendants
The specific method of service may vary depending on the type of defendant
being served:
Individual Defendants: For individuals in either Oklahoma or Texas,
personal delivery is typically the most straightforward method, though
service by mail may be available under certain circumstances or state
laws.
Corporate Defendants: As noted in United States v. ABS Staffing
Sols., LLC, 21 OCAHO no. 1632a (2025-02-13), service on corporations
involves "delivering a copy of... the complaint to an officer, a managing
or general agent, or any other agent authorized by appointment or by
law to receive service of process." This principle applies whether the
corporation is located in Oklahoma or Texas.
Government Defendants: For defendants who are government
entities or officials, additional or specialized procedures may apply,
particularly if they involve federal officials as referenced in 28 U.S.C. §
1391.
Exceptions and Caveats
Despite the general frameworks outlined above, several exceptions and
caveats warrant consideration:
Limitations on Automatic U.S. Marshal Service: As emphasized in
multiple Federal Litigation Procedure sources, "The U.S. Marshal is not
authorized to serve defendants in every civil action." Service by U.S.
Marshals is the exception rather than the rule in most civil actions,
requiring specific circumstances or court authorization.
Cost Considerations: The services of U.S. Marshals generally involve
fees that must be paid in advance, except in cases where the plaintiff
qualifies for fee waivers (such as in forma pauperis status). These costs
can be substantial, especially when serving multiple defendants across
different districts.
Time Factors: Service across state lines, particularly when it involves
forwarding to another judicial district, may take additional time
compared to local service. This timing factor should be considered
when planning litigation strategy and addressing service deadlines.

Statutory Prerequisites: Some provisions for nationwide service are
limited to specific types of actions or proceedings. For example, the
broad language of 28 U.S.C. § 3004 applies specifically to actions or
proceedings under "this chapter" (Federal Debt Collection Procedures).
Plaintiffs should ensure that any relied-upon statutory authority for
nationwide service actually applies to their specific type of case.
Alternative Service Methods: While the question focuses specifically
on service by U.S. Marshals, it's worth noting that in many
circumstances, other methods of service (such as private process
servers) may be more expedient or cost-effective, especially for
defendants in distant locations.
Conclusion
Service by U.S. Marshals on defendants located in both Oklahoma and Texas
when filing in an Oklahoma federal court is procedurally possible through
several mechanisms provided by federal statutes and rules. The process
requires court authorization through either specific circumstances (in forma
pauperis status, seaman status, or U.S. government status) or by specific
court order.
For defendants within Oklahoma, service can be effected directly by U.S.
Marshals within the territorial limits of the state. For defendants in Texas,
service can be accomplished through nationwide service provisions (28
U.S.C. § 3004), forwarding to another judicial district (28 U.S.C. § 1921), or
methods authorized by state law (Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4).
In all cases, the plaintiff must complete Form No. 285 with all pertinent
information about the defendant, coordinate with the marshal's office
regarding costs and logistics, and specify the appropriate method of service.
After service is completed, the U.S. Marshal will document the service on
the return portion of Form No. 285.
The availability of service by U.S. Marshals across state lines reflects the
federal judicial system's need to facilitate nationwide enforcement of federal
court orders and judgments. While specific procedural requirements must
be followed, these mechanisms ensure that defendants cannot evade service
simply by being located in a different state from where the action is filed.
For practitioners seeking to effect service by U.S. Marshals on defendants in
different states, careful attention to the procedural requirements, statutory
authorizations, and practical logistics is essential to ensure effective and
valid service that will withstand potential challenges.

jurisdiction issues.(270) Some of these statutes provide for 'nationwide' and
'worldwide' service of process.(271) Lower courts frequently apply these
provisions to permit service of process abroad and the use of a national
contacts test.(272) For example in Go-Video, Inc. v. Akai Electric Co.,(273)
the Ninth Circuit construed 'worldwide' or national service of process
provisions as legislatively authorizing both service abroad and the use of a
national contacts tests for purposes of asserting personal jurisdiction over
foreign defendants.(274) The Go-Video court, as followed by most other
lower courts, found that the use of national contacts in these circumstances
was consonant with the requirements of due process as guaranteed by the
Fifth Amendment.(275) Unless otherwise indicated, courts will read statutes
containing such service provisions as including an authorization for a
national contacts test.(276) After all, 'if Congress can authorize personal
jurisdiction over persons anywhere in the United States, it can also
authorize personal jurisdiction based on contacts of foreign defendants with
the entire United States.'(277)
Summary
Certain federal statutes allow for nationwide service of process, which
means that service can be effected across state lines within the United
States. This is particularly relevant in federal question cases where such
statutes are applicable. The passage also highlights that courts often
interpret these statutes to allow for a national contacts test, which aligns
with due process requirements.

Summary
The U.S. Marshal can serve defendants in civil actions only upon the court's
order at the plaintiff's request. This service is applicable in specific
circumstances, such as when a party is proceeding in forma pauperis, on
behalf of a seaman, on behalf of the United States or its officers, or upon a
court order. The plaintiff must provide all pertinent information about the
defendant and complete Form No. 285 for the U.S. Marshals Service. This
