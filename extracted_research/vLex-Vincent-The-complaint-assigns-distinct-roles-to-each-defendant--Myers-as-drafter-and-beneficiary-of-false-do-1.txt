Question
The complaint assigns distinct roles to each defendant: Myers as drafter and
beneficiary of false documents, Branthoover as organizer and legal advisor,
and Wilson as landlord executing eviction. It details their coordinated
actions, shared objectives, and ongoing communications, including threats
and furtherance of the scheme after the initial acts. A RICO conspiracy claim
does not require that each defendant personally commit every predicate act,
but must plead facts showing a knowing agreement to further the
enterprise’s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity, as established
in Salinas v. United States and Rule 8(a). The complaint’s specific allegations
of division of labor, coordinated timing, and shared unlawful purpose among
the defendants adequately plead the agreement element of a RICO
conspiracy.
Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
The complaint's allegations of distinct roles, coordinated actions, shared
objectives, and ongoing communications among the defendants adequately
establish the agreement element of a RICO conspiracy claim. Under Salinas
v. United States and subsequent interpretations, a RICO conspiracy does not
require each defendant to personally commit every predicate act but rather
necessitates a knowing agreement to further the enterprise's affairs through
a pattern of racketeering activity.
Summary
The complaint at issue presents a scenario where three defendants—Myers,
Branthoover, and Wilson—allegedly participated in a coordinated scheme
with each fulfilling distinct roles: Myers drafted and benefited from false
documents, Branthoover served as organizer and legal advisor, and Wilson
executed evictions as the landlord. The complaint details how these
defendants worked together with shared objectives, coordinated timing, and
ongoing communications, including threats and actions furthering the
scheme even after the initial activities. This division of labor and
collaborative approach forms the foundation for the RICO conspiracy claim
against them.
Under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d) and the Supreme Court's interpretation in Salinas
v. United States, a RICO conspiracy claim does not require each defendant
to personally commit every predicate act of racketeering. Instead, the law
requires only that defendants knowingly agree to further the enterprise's
affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity. This legal standard
recognizes that conspirators may divide responsibilities while pursuing a
common criminal objective. The complaint's specific allegations regarding
the defendants' distinct roles, coordinated actions, shared unlawful purpose,

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
and continued participation in the scheme appear to adequately establish
the agreement element necessary to plead a RICO conspiracy claim.
Background and Relevant Law
Legislation
The RICO conspiracy provision, 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d), states: "It shall be
unlawful for any person to conspire to violate any of the provisions of
subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section" 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d). This section
makes it unlawful for any person to conspire to violate RICO's substantive
provisions, which prohibit engaging in, conducting, or participating in an
enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.
Case Law
The Supreme Court's seminal decision in Salinas v. United States, 522 U.S.
52, 118 S.Ct. 469, 139 L.Ed.2d 352 (1997) established the fundamental
principle that "To be convicted of conspiracy to violate RICO under §1962(d),
the conspirator need not himself have committed or agreed to commit the
two or more predicate acts, such as bribery, requisite for a substantive RICO
offense under §1962(c)." The Court further clarified that Section 1962(d) "is
even more comprehensive than the general conspiracy provision applicable
to federal crimes, §371, since it contains no requirement of an overt or
specific act to effect the conspiracy's object."
This interpretation broadens the scope of RICO conspiracy liability to
include individuals who did not personally commit predicate acts but who
knowingly agreed to the overall criminal objective. The Court emphasized
that in a RICO conspiracy, the conspirator need only have "knew about and
agreed to facilitate [a racketeering] scheme" United States v. Zemlyansky, 
908 F.3d 1, 11 (2nd Cir. 2018) (quoting Salinas).
Multiple circuit courts have further developed and applied the Salinas
standard. For example, the First Circuit explained that for a RICO
conspiracy, "All the government need show is that the defendant agreed to
facilitate a scheme in which a conspirator would commit at least two
predicate acts, if the substantive crime occurred" United States v.
Rodríguez-Torres, 939 F.3d 16, 29 (1st Cir. 2019). This case reaffirms that "A
RICO-conspiracy defendant... need not have personally committed — or even
agreed to personally commit — the predicates."
The Second Circuit emphasized that "the object of a racketeering conspiracy
is to conduct the affairs of a charged enterprise through a pattern of
racketeering, not to commit discrete predicate acts" United States v.
Pizzonia, 577 F.3d 455, 459 (2nd Cir. 2009). This important distinction
underscores that the agreement in a RICO conspiracy focuses on the
enterprise's overall criminal objective rather than specific criminal acts.
Similarly, the Fifth Circuit has held that "To prove a RICO conspiracy, the
government must establish (1) that two or more people agreed to commit a

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
substantive RICO offense and (2) that the defendant knew of and agreed to
the overall objective of the RICO offense" United States v. Delgado, 401 F.3d
290, 296 (5th Cir. 2005). The court explicitly stated that "The conspirator
need not have committed or agreed to commit the two predicate acts," citing
Salinas.
The Fourth Circuit provided additional clarification in United States v.
Adoma, No. 18-4362, No. 18-4364, No. 18-4382 (4th Cir. Jul 30, 2019),
explaining that "a RICO conspiracy contains 'no requirement of some overt
act or specific act.'" The court noted that "The Government may identify and
allege the types of crimes that constitute the pattern of racketeering activity,
without alleging specific racketeering acts at all." This reinforces the
principle that "A defendant can agree to a pattern of racketeering activity
without committing or agreeing to commit any predicate acts himself."
In Empress Casino Joliet Corp. v. Balmoral Racing Club, Inc., 831 F.3d 815,
734-35 (7th Cir. 2016), the Seventh Circuit articulated that a RICO
conspiracy requires proof that "(1) the defendant[s] agreed to maintain an
interest in or control of an enterprise or to participate in the affairs of an
enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity, and (2) the
defendant[s] further agreed that someone would commit at least two
predicate acts to accomplish these goals." The court emphasized that "A
RICO conspirator need not agree to commit personally two predicate acts in
furtherance of the enterprise; rather, he must agree that someone will
commit them."
The Supreme Court in Boyle v. United States, 129 S.Ct. 2237, 556 U.S. 938
(2009) noted that RICO makes it "unlawful for any person employed by or
associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect,
interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or
indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of
racketeering activity." The Court emphasized that a RICO enterprise
requires "a group with a common purpose and course of conduct."
The Tenth Circuit's decision in United States v. Smith, 413 F.3d 1253 (10th
Cir. 2005) (which has been overruled by United States v. Garcia, 793 F.3d
1194 (10th Cir. 2015) on other grounds) explained that "The conspiracy
element of § 1962(d) requires the Government to demonstrate only that the
defendant knew about and agreed to facilitate the commission of—rather
than personally committed or agreed to commit—at least two of the
predicate acts constituting a pattern of racketeering activity." The court
added that "The government need not show that each conspirator knew of or
had contact with all other members. Nor need it show that the conspirators
knew all of the details of the conspiracy or participated in every act in
furtherance of the conspiracy."
Secondary Materials
Secondary sources consistently support this interpretation of RICO
conspiracy law. According to a RICO primer, "A conspiracy may exist even if
a conspirator does not agree to commit or facilitate each and every part of
the substantive offense. The partners in the criminal plan must agree to

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
pursue the same criminal objective and may divide up the work, yet each is
responsible for the acts of each other. If conspirators have a plan which calls
for some conspirators to perpetrate the crime and others to provide support,
the supporters are as guilty as the perpetrators" RICO: A Primer (2022).
Another secondary source notes that "A RICO defendant may also be an
individual who is not formally employed by the enterprise, but still assists
the enterprise in its racketeering activities. The RICO enterprise must have
a continuous structure and purpose independent from the racketeering
activity in which it engages, and its alleged confederates must work with a
common purpose or towards a shared goal" RACKETEER INFLUENCED
AND CORRUPT ORGANIZATIONS (2021).
Analysis
The Agreement Element in RICO Conspiracy Claims
The central issue here concerns whether the complaint's allegations
sufficiently plead the agreement element of a RICO conspiracy when the
defendants performed different roles in the enterprise's activities. Based on
the authorities provided, the answer is clearly yes.
The Supreme Court in Salinas established that a RICO conspiracy does not
require each defendant to personally commit or agree to commit every
predicate act. Instead, as summarized by the Second Circuit in Zemlyansky,
a RICO conspiracy requires proof of "(a) an agreement to join a racketeering
scheme, (b) the defendant's knowing engagement in the scheme with the
intent that its overall goals be effectuated, and (c) that the scheme involved,
or by agreement between any members of the conspiracy was intended to
involve, two or more predicate acts of racketeering" Levin v. Javeri (In re
Firestar Diamond, Inc.), 18-10509 (SHL), Adv. 20-01054 (SHL) (Bankr.
S.D.N.Y. Oct 13, 2023).
The division of labor described in the complaint—Myers drafting and
benefiting from false documents, Branthoover organizing and providing
legal advice, and Wilson executing evictions—demonstrates a coordinated
effort to further the enterprise's affairs through racketeering activity. This
arrangement is precisely what RICO conspiracy law contemplates. As the
RICO primer explains, conspirators "may divide up the work" while pursuing
"the same criminal objective" RICO: A Primer (2022).
Division of Labor Within a RICO Conspiracy
The complaint's allegations regarding the defendants' distinct roles fit
squarely within established RICO conspiracy jurisprudence. As noted in 
United States v. Householder, 1:20-cr-77 (S.D. Ohio Jan 03, 2023), "the focus
of RICO conspiracy is the defendant's agreement to participate in the
conduct of the affairs of the enterprise through a pattern of racketeering
activity; not the defendant's agreement to commit a predicate racketeering
act." The Householder court explicitly recognized that the RICO conspiracy

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
statute "is intentionally drafted to cast a wider net than a general conspiracy
charge."
The coordinated timing and shared unlawful purpose alleged in the
complaint demonstrate the type of agreement required for a RICO
conspiracy. As explained by the Seventh Circuit, a defendant satisfies the
RICO conspiracy requirements if they "intended to further an endeavor
which, if completed, would satisfy all of the elements of a substantive [RICO]
criminal offense [and] it suffices that he adopt the goal of furthering or
facilitating the criminal endeavor" United States v. Householder, 1:20-cr-77
(S.D. Ohio Jan 03, 2023).
The ongoing communications and threats described in the complaint further
support the existence of an agreement. These allegations demonstrate that
the defendants continued to work together to further the scheme even after
the initial acts, suggesting an ongoing enterprise with a "continuous
structure and purpose" RACKETEER INFLUENCED AND CORRUPT
ORGANIZATIONS (2021).
Coordinated Actions and Shared Objectives
The complaint's allegations regarding coordinated actions and shared
objectives among the defendants satisfy the requirement that RICO co-
conspirators "pursue the same criminal objective" United States v. Cianci,
378 F.3d 71 (1st Cir. 2004). The Ninth Circuit explained in United States v.
Brooklier, 685 F.2d 1208 (9th Cir. 1982) that "The purpose of the RICO
statute is to allow a single prosecution of persons who engage in a series of
criminal acts for an enterprise, even if different defendants perform
different tasks or participate in separate acts of racketeering. The same
persons need not commit or endorse the same acts of racketeering."
The specific allegations in the complaint regarding the defendants'
coordinated timing and shared objectives demonstrate what the Supreme
Court in Turkette described as "evidence of an ongoing organization, formal
or informal, and by evidence that the various associates function as a
continuing unit" United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 101 S.Ct. 2524, 69
L.Ed.2d 246 (1981) (which was abrogated by United States v. Lane, 474 U.S.
438, 106 S.Ct. 725, 88 L.Ed.2d 814 (1986) on other grounds related to
joinder issues not relevant to this analysis).
The continuing communications and threats alleged in the complaint also
demonstrate the type of "ongoing organization" and "continuing unit" that
Turkette identified as essential to proving a RICO enterprise. These
allegations suggest that the defendants were functioning as a cohesive unit
rather than as individuals pursuing separate criminal objectives.
Knowing Agreement to Further the Enterprise's Affairs
The complaint's allegations regarding the defendants' shared unlawful
purpose and coordinated actions satisfy the requirement that each
defendant "knew about and agreed to facilitate [a racketeering] scheme" 
Salinas v. United States, 522 U.S. 52, 66, 118 S.Ct. 469, 139 L.Ed.2d 352

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
(1997). As the Third Circuit explained (as cited in United States v. Tocco, 
135 F.3d 116 (2000)), a defendant need only know "the general nature of the
enterprise and that the enterprise extends beyond his role."
The specific allegations regarding the defendants' distinct roles—Myers as
drafter and beneficiary of false documents, Branthoover as organizer and
legal advisor, and Wilson as landlord executing evictions—demonstrate that
each defendant knew about and agreed to facilitate the scheme.
Furthermore, the allegation that the defendants continued to communicate
and further the scheme after the initial acts suggests an ongoing agreement
to participate in the enterprise's affairs.
As the First Circuit noted in United States v. Sandoval, 6 F.4th 63 (1st Cir.
2021), "Given that the conspiracy offense set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d)
does not require the government to prove that the charged acts of
racketeering were actually committed by either the defendant charged with
the conspiracy or by others... no more evidence was needed to support a
finding by a reasonable juror that the agreement element of this conspiracy
offense had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt." This supports the
conclusion that the complaint's allegations regarding the defendants'
agreement are sufficient to plead a RICO conspiracy.
Adequacy of the Pleading
The complaint's specific allegations regarding the defendants' division of
labor, coordinated timing, and shared unlawful purpose appear to satisfy
Rule 8(a)'s pleading requirements for a RICO conspiracy claim. As explained
in United States v. Gurry, Criminal Action No. 16-cr-10343-ADB (D. Mass.
Jan 17, 2019), "an indictment does not need to allege that a defendant
agreed that he or a co-conspirator would commit each element of a
predicate act." Instead, it must simply allege "that the defendant knowingly
joined a conspiracy the objective of which was to operate that enterprise
through an identified pattern of racketeering activity."
The complaint's detailed allegations regarding each defendant's role in the
scheme, their coordinated actions, and their ongoing communications
appear to provide sufficient factual matter to state a claim that is "plausible
on its face" as required by Rule 8(a). The allegations go beyond merely
asserting that the defendants participated in a conspiracy and provide
specific details about how each defendant contributed to the enterprise's
affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.
Exceptions and Caveats
While the complaint's allegations appear to adequately plead the agreement
element of a RICO conspiracy, there are several important caveats to
consider.
First, while a RICO conspiracy does not require each defendant to commit or
agree to commit every predicate act, there must still be evidence that at
least two predicate acts of racketeering were committed or agreed to be

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
committed by someone within the enterprise. As the Seventh Circuit
explained in Empress Casino Joliet Corp. v. Balmoral Racing Club, Inc., 831
F.3d 815, 734-35 (7th Cir. 2016), a RICO conspiracy requires proof that "the
defendant[s] further agreed that someone would commit at least two
predicate acts to accomplish these goals."
Second, while distinct roles among co-conspirators are permitted under
RICO, there must still be evidence that each defendant participated in the
"operation or management" of the enterprise to some degree. As the Sixth
Circuit noted in Ouwinga v. Benistar 419 Plan Servs., Inc., 694 F.3d 783 (6th
Cir. 2012), "participation in the conduct of an enterprise's affairs requires
proof that the defendant participated in the 'operation or management' of
the enterprise." However, this standard is met if the defendant had "some
part in directing the enterprise's affairs," not necessarily primary
responsibility.
Third, for civil RICO conspiracy claims specifically, the plaintiff must allege
injury from an act that is independently wrongful under RICO. As noted in 
Allstate Ins. Co. v. Benhamou, 190 F.Supp.3d 631 (S.D. Tex. 2016), "to
establish civil liability for RICO conspiracy, a claimant must allege injury
from an act that is independently wrongful under RICO."
Fourth, the complaint must still adequately plead the existence of an
enterprise distinct from the pattern of racketeering activity. As the Supreme
Court explained in United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 101 S.Ct. 2524,
69 L.Ed.2d 246 (1981), "In order to secure a conviction under RICO, the
Government must prove both the existence of an 'enterprise' and the
connected 'pattern of racketeering activity.'" The enterprise is proved by
"evidence of an ongoing organization, formal or informal, and by evidence
that the various associates function as a continuing unit."
Conclusion
Based on the provided legal authorities, the complaint's allegations of
distinct roles, coordinated actions, shared objectives, and ongoing
communications among the defendants appear to adequately plead the
agreement element of a RICO conspiracy claim. Under Salinas v. United
States, 522 U.S. 52, 118 S.Ct. 469, 139 L.Ed.2d 352 (1997) and subsequent
cases, a RICO conspiracy does not require each defendant to personally
commit or agree to commit every predicate act. Instead, it requires only that
each defendant knowingly agreed to further the enterprise's affairs through
a pattern of racketeering activity.
The complaint's specific allegations that Myers drafted and benefited from
false documents, Branthoover organized and provided legal advice, and
Wilson executed evictions as the landlord, all while coordinating their
actions and communicating to further a shared unlawful purpose,
demonstrate precisely the type of agreement that RICO conspiracy law
contemplates. As the Ninth Circuit explained in United States v. Brooklier,
685 F.2d 1208 (9th Cir. 1982), "The purpose of the RICO statute is to allow a
single prosecution of persons who engage in a series of criminal acts for an

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
enterprise, even if different defendants perform different tasks or
participate in separate acts of racketeering."
The ongoing communications and threats alleged in the complaint further
strengthen the case for a RICO conspiracy by demonstrating that the
defendants continued to work together to further the scheme even after the
initial acts. This suggests an ongoing enterprise with a "continuous
structure and purpose" RACKETEER INFLUENCED AND CORRUPT
ORGANIZATIONS (2021), which is a key element of a RICO claim.
In conclusion, the complaint's allegations regarding the defendants' division
of labor, coordinated timing, and shared unlawful purpose appear to
adequately plead the agreement element of a RICO conspiracy claim. The
fact that each defendant played a distinct role in the enterprise's activities
does not undermine the RICO conspiracy claim; rather, it aligns precisely
with RICO's purpose of addressing coordinated criminal activity where
different participants may perform different functions within the overall
scheme.
Legal Authorities
U.S. v. Ruggiero, 726 F.2d 913 (2nd Cir. 1984)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Second Circuit
Extract
The government argues that no predicate acts are necessary for a RICO
conspiracy charge against Tomasulo, and that it is sufficient that Tomasulo
was found to have conspired with others to engage through an enterprise in
a pattern of racketeering consisting of predicate acts committed by others.
We are reluctant to accept this extremely broad interpretation of RICO in
the absence of controlling authority. Prevailing case law requires that for the
government to convict on a RICO conspiracy it must prove that defendant
himself at least agreed to commit two or more predicate crimes.
Summary
Requirements for a RICO conspiracy charge, emphasizing that a defendant
must agree to commit predicate crimes, but does not necessarily need to
commit them personally. This aligns with the proposition that a RICO
conspiracy claim does not require each defendant to commit every predicate
act, but rather to agree to further the enterprise's affairs through a pattern
of racketeering activity. The passage supports the idea that the complaint's
allegations of coordinated actions and shared objectives among defendants
can adequately plead the agreement element of a RICO conspiracy.

U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
Section 1962(d) prohibits a person from conspiring to violate § 1962(c). The
conspiracy element of § 1962(d) requires the Government to demonstrate
only that the defendant knew about and agreed to facilitate the commission
of—rather than personally committed or agreed to commit—at least two of
the predicate acts constituting a pattern of racketeering activity that were
proven at trial. See Salinas, 522 U.S. at 66, 118 S.Ct. 469. ... The

U.S. Court of Appeals — Eleventh Circuit
Extract
The appellants also contend that the district court erred in failing to instruct
the jurors that each of the defendants, in order to be convicted of RICO
conspiracy, must have joined the conspiracy by agreeing to commit two
predicate acts. We have recently held that when 'a defendant agreed to
participate in the conduct of an enterprise's affairs with the objective of
violating a substantive RICO provision, it is not necessary that the defendant
agree to personally commit two predicate acts for the required pattern of
racketeering activity.'
Summary
The passage from U.S. v. Hewes clarifies that in a RICO conspiracy, it is not
necessary for each defendant to personally commit two predicate acts.
Instead, it is sufficient if a defendant agrees to participate in the conduct of
an enterprise's affairs with the objective of violating a substantive RICO
provision. This supports the proposition that the complaint can assign
distinct roles to each defendant and still adequately plead a RICO
conspiracy, as long as there is a knowing agreement to further the
enterprise’s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.

facilitate a scheme in which a conspirator would commit at least two
predicate acts, if the substantive crime occurred. See, e.g., Salinas, 522 U.S.

Extract
To show a pattern of racketeering activity conspiracy, a defendant need not
personally agree to commit two predicate acts; rather, he need only 'kn[ow]
about and agree[ ] to facilitate the scheme.' Salinas v. United States, 522
U.S. 52, 66 (1997). Further, a defendant need not know about every member
and component of the enterprise; he need only know 'the general nature of
the enterprise and that the enterprise extends beyond his role.' United
States v. Eufrasio, 935 F.3d 553, 577 n.29 (3d Cir. 1991).
Summary
The passage from "U.S. v Tocco" supports the proposition by clarifying that
in a RICO conspiracy, a defendant does not need to personally commit every
predicate act. Instead, it is sufficient for the defendant to know about and
agree to facilitate the scheme. This aligns with the proposition that the
complaint assigns distinct roles to each defendant and details their
coordinated actions and shared objectives. The passage also emphasizes
that a defendant need only understand the general nature of the enterprise,
which supports the idea of a division of labor and shared unlawful purpose
among the defendants.

(1981)
U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
In order to secure a conviction under RICO, the Government must prove
both the existence of an 'enterprise' and the connected 'pattern of
racketeering activity.' The enterprise is an entity, for present purposes a
group of persons associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a
course of conduct. The pattern of racketeering activity is, on the other hand,
a series of criminal acts as defined by the statute. The former is proved by
evidence of an ongoing organization, formal or informal, and by evidence
that the various associates function as a continuing unit.

Summary
The U.S. Supreme Court in United States v. Turkette clarified that a RICO
enterprise can be an association of individuals with a common purpose, and
it must be distinct from the pattern of racketeering activity. This supports
the proposition by emphasizing that a RICO conspiracy does not require
each defendant to commit every predicate act but rather to be part of an
enterprise with a shared unlawful purpose and coordinated actions.
Salinas v. U.S., 522 U.S. 52, 118 S.Ct. 469, 139 L.Ed.2d 352 (1997)
U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
To be convicted of conspiracy to violate RICO under §1962(d), the
conspirator need not himself have committed or agreed to commit the two
or more predicate acts, such as bribery, requisite for a substantive RICO
offense under §1962(c). Section 1962(d)-which forbids 'any person to
conspire to violate' §1962(c)-is even more comprehensive than the general
conspiracy provision applicable to federal crimes, §371, since it contains no
requirement of an overt or specific act to effect the conspiracy's object.
Summary
The passage from Salinas v. United States clarifies that under §1962(d), a
defendant in a RICO conspiracy does not need to personally commit or agree
to commit the predicate acts required for a substantive RICO offense. This
supports the proposition that the complaint can assign distinct roles to each

there is a knowing agreement to further the enterprise’s affairs through a

U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
RICO makes it 'unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any
enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign
commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of
such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.' 18 U.S.C.
§ 1962(c) (emphasis added). ... Given that it is also unlawful to conspire to
violate § 1962(c), see § 1962(d), this comment provides no assurance that
RICO and § 371 offenses remain distinct. Only if proof of the enterprise
element—the 'group with a common purpose and course of conduct'—

requires evidence of activity or organization beyond that inherent in the
pattern of predicate acts will RICO offenses retain an identity distinct from §
371 offenses.
Summary
Under RICO, it is unlawful to participate in an enterprise's affairs through a
pattern of racketeering activity, and it is also unlawful to conspire to do so.
The requirement for a "group with a common purpose and course of
conduct" aligns with the proposition's assertion that a RICO conspiracy does
not require each defendant to commit every predicate act but must show a
knowing agreement to further the enterprise's affairs. This supports the idea
that distinct roles and coordinated actions among defendants can establish
the agreement element of a RICO conspiracy.
United States v. Sandoval, 6 F.4th 63 (1st Cir. 2021)
U.S. Court of Appeals — First Circuit
Extract
Given that the conspiracy offense set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d) does not
require the government to prove that the charged acts of racketeering were
actually committed by either the defendant charged with the conspiracy or
by others, Salinas, 522 U.S. at 65, 118 S.Ct. 469 ; Rodríguez-Torres, 939 F.3d
at 29 ('All the government need show is that the defendant agreed to
facilitate a scheme in which a conspirator would commit at least two
predicate acts, if the substantive crime occurred.' (emphasis added)), no
more evidence was needed to support a finding by a reasonable juror that
the agreement element of this conspiracy offense had been proved beyond a
reasonable doubt...
Summary
The passage from United States v. Sandoval clarifies that under 18 U.S.C. §
1962(d), a RICO conspiracy does not require proof that each defendant
personally committed the predicate acts. Instead, it is sufficient to show that
the defendant agreed to facilitate a scheme where a conspirator would
commit at least two predicate acts. This aligns with the proposition that the
complaint need only demonstrate a knowing agreement to further the
enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity, without
requiring each defendant to commit every act.

Extract
In order to demonstrate a RICO conspiracy under § 1962(d), a plaintiff must
demonstrate that (1) two or more people agreed to commit a substantive
RICO offense, and (2) the defendant knew of and agreed to the overall
objective of the RICO offense. Chaney v. Dreyfus Serv. Corp., 595 F.3d 219,
239 (5th Cir.2010) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). In the
RICO criminal context, a person need not commit or agree to commit
predicate acts to be held liable. Salinas v. United States, 522 U.S. 52, 63–64,
118 S.Ct. 469, 139 L.Ed.2d 352. However, to establish civil liability for RICO
conspiracy, a claimant must allege injury from an act that is independently
wrongful under RICO.
Summary
Requirements for establishing a RICO conspiracy under § 1962(d),
emphasizing that a defendant need not personally commit every predicate
act to be held liable. This aligns with the proposition that the complaint can
assign distinct roles to each defendant, as long as there is a knowing
agreement to further the enterprise's affairs through a pattern of
racketeering activity. The reference to Salinas v. United States supports the
idea that personal commission of predicate acts is not necessary for liability,
which is a key element of the proposition.

U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
RICO renders criminally and civilly liable 'any person' who uses or invests
income derived 'from a pattern of racketeering activity' to acquire an
interest in or to operate an enterprise engaged in interstate commerce, §
1962(a); who acquires or maintains an interest in or control of such an
enterprise 'through a pattern of racketeering activity,' § 1962(b); who, being
employed by or associated with such an enterprise, conducts or participates
in the conduct of its affairs 'through a pattern of racketeering activity,' §
1962(c); or, finally, who conspires to violate the first three subsections of §
1962, § 1962(d).
Summary
Broad scope of RICO, which imposes liability on individuals who engage in
or conspire to engage in a pattern of racketeering activity. It emphasizes
that RICO applies to any person involved in such activities, whether through
direct participation or conspiracy. This supports the proposition that a RICO
conspiracy claim does not require each defendant to commit every predicate

Summary
Requirements for stating a RICO conspiracy claim, emphasizing the need to
allege an illicit agreement to violate the substantive RICO provision. This
aligns with the proposition that a RICO conspiracy claim does not require
each defendant to commit every predicate act but must show a knowing
agreement to further the enterprise’s affairs through a pattern of
racketeering activity. The passage supports the idea that the complaint's
specific allegations of division of labor and shared unlawful purpose among
the defendants can adequately plead the agreement element of a RICO
conspiracy.

Courts have interpreted these statutory provisions to require that a RICO
conspiracy indictment allege 'that the defendant knowingly joined a
conspiracy the objective of which was to operate that enterprise through an
identified pattern of racketeering activity.' United States v. Glecier, 923 F.2d
496, 500 (7th Cir. 1991); see Salinas v. United States, 522 U.S. 52, 66 (1997)

the defendant 'knew about and agreed to facilitate the scheme'); ... An
indictment does not need to allege that a defendant agreed that he or a co-
conspirator would commit each element of a predicate act.
Summary
The passage from United States v. Gurry discusses the requirements for a
RICO conspiracy indictment, emphasizing that it must allege that the
defendant knowingly joined a conspiracy with the objective of operating an

enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. It references Salinas v.
United States, which supports the notion that a RICO conspiracy claim does
not require each defendant to commit every predicate act, but rather to
agree to facilitate the scheme. This aligns with the proposition that the
complaint's specific allegations of division of labor and shared unlawful
purpose among the defendants adequately plead the agreement element of a
RICO conspiracy.
United States v. Householder, 1:20-cr-77 (S.D. Ohio Jan 03, 2023)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of Ohio
Extract
The Government notes that 'the focus of RICO conspiracy is the defendant's
agreement to participate in the conduct of the affairs of the enterprise
through a pattern of racketeering activity; not the defendant's agreement to
commit a predicate racketeering act.' ... the RICO conspiracy statute in
particular is intentionally drafted to cast a wider net than a general
conspiracy charge. ... For purposes of a RICO conspiracy, what matters is
that 'the defendant intended to further an endeavor which, if completed,
would satisfy all of the elements of a substantive [RICO] criminal offense
[and] it suffices that he adopt the goal of furthering or facilitating the
criminal endeavor.'
Summary
The passage from United States v. Householder emphasizes that a RICO
conspiracy does not require each defendant to commit every predicate act.
Instead, it focuses on the agreement to participate in the enterprise's affairs
through a pattern of racketeering activity. This aligns with the proposition
that distinct roles and coordinated actions among defendants can
adequately plead the agreement element of a RICO conspiracy. The passage
supports the idea that the division of labor and shared unlawful purpose
among defendants can establish the necessary agreement for a RICO
conspiracy claim.

As the Supreme Court has explained, unlike a traditional conspiracy, a RICO
conspiracy contains 'no requirement of some overt act or specific act.'
Salinas, 522 U.S. at 63. Thus, to secure a conviction for racketeering
conspiracy, the Government is not required to prove, or even allege, the

=== PAGE 17 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
actual completion of or agreement to perform any particular racketeering
act by the defendant or any other member of the conspiracy. Cornell, 780 F.
3d at 624. The Government may identify and allege the types of crimes that
constitute the pattern of racketeering activity, without alleging specific
racketeering acts at all. United States v. Glecier, 923 F.2d 496, 500 (7th Cir.
1991). The Government does not need to prove specific 'racketeering acts,'
but instead only needs to prove that each defendant agreed that he or a co-
conspirator would commit at least two acts of racketeering activity of the
type alleged in the indictment, or any combination thereof. Cornell, 780 F.3d
at 624 ('The partners in the criminal plan need only agree to pursue the
same criminal objective, regardless of whether that criminal objective is
ever started or carried out.'). A defendant can agree to a pattern of
racketeering activity without committing or agreeing to commit any
predicate acts himself. See, e.g., Salinas, 522 U.S. at 66; see also United
States v. Delgado, 401 F.3d 290, 296 (5th Cir. 2005) (holding that the
conspirator need not have committed or agreed to commit the two predicate
acts and instead need only have known of and agreed to the overall objective
of the RICO offense).
Summary
In a RICO conspiracy, it is not necessary for each defendant to commit or
agree to commit specific predicate acts. Instead, it is sufficient to show that
each defendant agreed to further the enterprise's affairs through a pattern
of racketeering activity. This aligns with the proposition that the complaint's
specific allegations of division of labor, coordinated timing, and shared
unlawful purpose among the defendants adequately plead the agreement
element of a RICO conspiracy.
U.S. v. Brooklier, 685 F.2d 1208 (9th Cir. 1982)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Ninth Circuit
Extract
The purpose of the RICO statute is to allow a single prosecution of persons
who engage in a series of criminal acts for an enterprise, even if different
defendants perform different tasks or participate in separate acts of
racketeering. The same persons need not commit or endorse the same acts
of racketeering. It is sufficient if a defendant who participates in an
enterprise through a pattern of racketeering knows that the enterprise
operates by a pattern of racketeering. The pattern may be established by
showing two or more acts that constitute offenses, conspiracies, or attempts
of the requisite type, as long as the defendant committed two of the acts and
both of them were connected by a common scheme, plan or motive.
Summary
A RICO conspiracy does not require each defendant to commit every
predicate act, but rather to participate in the enterprise with knowledge of

its racketeering activities. This supports the proposition that distinct roles
and coordinated actions among defendants can adequately plead the
agreement element of a RICO conspiracy.
Ouwinga v. Benistar 419 Plan Servs., Inc., 694 F.3d 783 (6th Cir. 2012)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Sixth Circuit
Extract
A plaintiff must set forth allegations to establish that the defendant
conducted or participated, 'directly or indirectly, in the conduct of [the
RICO] enterprise's affairs.' 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). In Reves v. Ernst & Young,
the Supreme Court held that participation in the conduct of an enterprise's
affairs requires proof that the defendant participated in the 'operation or
management' of the enterprise. 507 U.S. 170, 183, 113 S.Ct. 1163, 122 L.Ed.
2d 525 (1993). RICO liability is not limited to those with primary
responsibility for the enterprise's affairs; only 'some part' in directing the
enterprise's affairs is required. Id. at 179, 113 S.Ct. 1163. However,
defendants must have 'conducted or participated in the conduct of the
‘enterprise's affairs,’ not just their own affairs.'
Summary
The passage explains that for a RICO claim, it is sufficient to show that a
defendant participated in the operation or management of the enterprise's
affairs, even if they did not have primary responsibility. This supports the
proposition that a RICO conspiracy claim does not require each defendant to
commit every predicate act, as long as there is a knowing agreement to
further the enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.
The division of labor and coordinated actions among defendants, as
described in the proposition, align with the requirement that defendants
must have participated in the conduct of the enterprise's affairs.

In Salinas, the Court held that the Government need not prove that each

The passage from the U.S. v. International Longshoremen's Ass'n case
references the Supreme Court's decision in Salinas v. United States, which
clarifies that a RICO conspiracy does not require each defendant to commit

the complaint can assign distinct roles to each defendant and still
adequately plead a RICO conspiracy by showing a knowing agreement to
further the enterprise’s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.

U.S. Bankruptcy Court — Southern District of New York
Extract
Separate from the elements of a substantive RICO violation, RICO
conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d) requires proof '(a) of an agreement to
join a racketeering scheme, (b) of the defendant's knowing engagement in
the scheme with the intent that its overall goals be effectuated, and (c) that
the scheme involved, or by agreement between any members of the
conspiracy was intended to involve, two or more predicate acts of
racketeering.' United States v. Zemlyansky, 908 F.3d 1, 11 (2d Cir. 2018). 'To
prove the agreement element, the [plaintiff] must show that the defendant
'knew about and agreed to facilitate [a racketeering] scheme.' Id. (quoting

Summary
Requirements for establishing a RICO conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d),
emphasizing that a defendant does not need to commit or agree to commit
specific predicate acts. Instead, it is sufficient to show an agreement to join
a racketeering scheme and a knowing engagement in the scheme with the
intent to further its goals. This aligns with the proposition that a RICO
conspiracy claim can be supported by demonstrating a coordinated effort
among defendants with distinct roles, shared objectives, and ongoing
communications, without each defendant committing every predicate act.

The essence of a RICO conspiracy is not an agreement to commit predicate
crimes but an agreement to conduct or participate in the conduct of the
affairs of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering. 'Pattern' is
expressly defined as two or more predicate offenses.
Summary
The passage from U.S. v. Zemek clarifies that a RICO conspiracy does not
require each defendant to commit every predicate act. Instead, it requires
an agreement to conduct the affairs of an enterprise through a pattern of
racketeering activity. This supports the proposition that the complaint's
allegations of distinct roles and coordinated actions among the defendants
can adequately plead the agreement element of a RICO conspiracy, as it
aligns with the legal interpretation that the focus is on the agreement to
further the enterprise's affairs.
U.S. v. Delgado, 401 F.3d 290 (5th Cir. 2005)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
The RICO Act criminalizes conspiracy to violate any of its substantive
provisions. 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d). 'To prove a RICO conspiracy, the
government must establish (1) that two or more people agreed to commit a
substantive RICO offense and (2) that the defendant knew of and agreed to
the overall objective of the RICO offense.' Posada-Rios, 158 F.3d at 857-58.
These elements may be established by circumstantial evidence. Id. Each
requirement is met here. ... The conspirator need not have committed or

known of and agreed to the overall objective of the RICO offense.
Summary
The passage from "U.S. v. Delgado" clarifies that for a RICO conspiracy, it is
not necessary for each conspirator to commit or agree to commit the
predicate acts themselves. Instead, it is sufficient if they know of and agree
to the overall objective of the RICO offense. This aligns with the proposition
that a RICO conspiracy claim does not require each defendant to personally
commit every predicate act but must show a knowing agreement to further
the enterprise’s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.

section 1962(d) offense.
Summary
The passage from U.S. v. Glecier clarifies that for a RICO conspiracy charge
under section 1962(d), it is not necessary to allege or prove that each
defendant personally committed specific predicate acts. This aligns with the
proposition that a RICO conspiracy claim can be supported by showing a
knowing agreement to further the enterprise’s affairs through a pattern of
racketeering activity, without requiring each defendant to have committed

U.S. v. Pizzonia, 577 F.3d 455 (2nd Cir. 2009)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Second Circuit
Extract
RICO's conspiracy provision thus proscribes an agreement to conduct or to
participate in the conduct of the enterprise's affairs through a pattern of
racketeering activity... the agreement proscribed by section 1962(d) is [a]
conspiracy to participate in a charged enterprise's affairs through a pattern
of racketeering, not [a] conspiracy to commit predicate acts... a RICO
conspiracy is never simply an agreement to commit specified predicate acts
that allegedly form a pattern of racketeering. Nor is it merely an agreement
to join in a particular enterprise. Rather, it is an agreement to conduct or to
participate in the conduct of a charged enterprise's affairs through a pattern
of racketeering.
Summary
A RICO conspiracy involves an agreement to conduct or participate in the
conduct of an enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.
It emphasizes that the conspiracy is not merely about committing specific
predicate acts but about furthering the enterprise's affairs through those
acts. This aligns with the proposition that a RICO conspiracy claim does not
require each defendant to commit every predicate act but to show a
knowing agreement to further the enterprise's affairs. The distinct roles and
coordinated actions of the defendants in the proposition reflect this
understanding of a RICO conspiracy.

Summary
The passage from U.S. v. Sinito explains that to prove a RICO conspiracy, it
is necessary to demonstrate an illicit agreement to violate the substantive

As a general matter, a jury’s finding that a defendant did not commit certain
substantive crimes does not necessarily preclude the government from later
proving that he or she knowingly agreed to facilitate a racketeering scheme
involving, or intended to involve, the same substantive crimes. See Salinas v.
United States, 522 U.S. 52, 65, 118 S.Ct. 469, 139 L.Ed.2d 352 (1997)
(holding that RICO’s conspiracy provision 'does not ... excuse from [its]
reach ... an actor who does not himself commit ... the two or more predicate
acts requisite to the underlying offense'). ... RICO conspiracy requires proof
that the defendant 'agree[d] to conduct or to participate in the conduct of
[an] enterprise’s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.' United
States v. Pizzonia, 577 F.3d 455, 462 (2d Cir. 2009). To prove the agreement

The passage from "United States v. Zemlyansky" supports the proposition by
clarifying that a RICO conspiracy does not require each defendant to commit
every predicate act. Instead, it requires proof of an agreement to participate
in the enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity. The
passage emphasizes that a defendant can be found guilty of RICO
conspiracy if they knowingly agreed to facilitate the scheme, even if they did

U.S. v. Cianci, 378 F.3d 71 (1st Cir. 2004)
U.S. Court of Appeals — First Circuit
Extract
For purposes of a RICO conspiracy, the sufficiency questions boils down to
whether a jury could have found that the defendants intended to further an
endeavor which, if completed, would have satisfied the 'pattern' requirement
of RICO. See Salinas v. United States, 522 U.S. 52, 61-66, 118 S.Ct. 469, 139

Summary
The passage from U.S. v. Cianci discusses the sufficiency of evidence
required for a RICO conspiracy, emphasizing that it is not necessary for each
defendant to commit every predicate act. Instead, it is sufficient if the
defendants intended to further an endeavor that would satisfy the pattern
requirement of RICO. This aligns with the proposition that a RICO
conspiracy claim can be supported by showing a knowing agreement to
further the enterprise’s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity,
even if each defendant played a distinct role.

This issue was ultimately settled, for better or worse, by the Supreme Court
in its 1997 decision in Salinas v. United States. (160) Consequently, it is
clear today that an individual need not personally agree to commit or
actually commit any predicate acts for RICO liability. (161) Salinas both

however, and there is still some uncertainty as to the exact proof required as
to each defendant. Nonetheless, with the basic outline of RICO conspiracy in

The Supreme Court's decision in Salinas v. United States clarified that for

Extract
A defendant's knowledge of another participant's criminal acts is not enough
to find the defendant responsible for those acts under the first prong. To
determine the scope of the criminal activity that the defendant and the co-
conspirators agreed to undertake jointly, a court may consider any explicit
agreement or implicit consent reasonably inferred from the conduct of the
defendant and others.
Summary
For a RICO conspiracy, it is not necessary for each defendant to commit
every predicate act. Instead, the focus is on the scope of the agreement and
the conduct that can be reasonably inferred as part of the conspiracy. This
supports the proposition that the complaint's detailed allegations of distinct
roles and coordinated actions among the defendants can adequately plead
the agreement element of a RICO conspiracy.

to pursue the same criminal objective,&#34; even if each conspirator does
not agree to commit or facilitate each and every part of the substantive
offense. (173) Section 1962(d) thus permits the government to prosecute
individuals who have not committed any of the predicate acts of
racketeering as long as it proves the defendant &#34;intend[ed] to further
an endeavor which, if completed, would satisfy all of the elements of a
substantive criminal offense.&#34; (174) As a result, a defendant may be
found not guilty of the substantive offense, but may still be convicted of
conspiracy, if there is proof of an agreement to commit the substantive
crime. (175)
Summary
The passage explains that under Section 1962(d) of RICO, a defendant can
be prosecuted for conspiracy even if they did not commit the predicate acts,
as long as there is an agreement to further the criminal endeavor. This
supports the proposition that a RICO conspiracy claim does not require each
defendant to commit every predicate act, but rather to show a knowing
agreement to further the enterprise's affairs through a pattern of
racketeering activity.

Extract
Relevant conduct is not limited to the acts that the defendant personally
participated in or conduct charged against the particular defendant.
Relevant conduct includes all conduct, including the acts and omissions of
others in the enterprise that are reasonably foreseeable in connection with
the jointly undertaken criminal activity and in furtherance of that activity.
(281) To hold a defendant accountable for the acts of others, a court must
find that the acts were: (i) within the scope of the defendant's agreement,
and (ii) foreseeable to the defendant. (282)
Summary
The passage explains that in a RICO conspiracy, a defendant can be held
accountable for the acts of others if those acts are within the scope of the
defendant's agreement and are foreseeable. This supports the proposition
that a RICO conspiracy claim does not require each defendant to personally
commit every predicate act, as long as there is a knowing agreement to
further the enterprise’s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.
The passage aligns with the idea that the complaint's specific allegations of

division of labor and shared unlawful purpose among the defendants can
adequately plead the agreement element of a RICO conspiracy.

Instead, the Supreme Court held in Salinas v. United States that 'partners in
the criminal plan must agree to pursue the same criminal objective,' even if
each conspirator does not agree to commit or facilitate each and every part
of the substantive offense. Section 1962(d) therefore allows for prosecution
of individuals who have not committed any of the predicate acts of
racketeering as long as the government proves the defendant 'intend[ed] to
further an endeavor which, if completed, would satisfy all of the elements of
a substantive criminal offense.'
Summary
The passage from the American Criminal Law Review discusses the legal
standard set by the Supreme Court in Salinas v. United States, which is

directly relevant to the proposition. It clarifies that a RICO conspiracy does
not require each defendant to commit every predicate act, but rather to
agree to further the criminal objective. This supports the proposition that
the complaint's allegations of distinct roles and coordinated actions among
the defendants can adequately plead the agreement element of a RICO
conspiracy.

Extract
A RICO defendant may also be an individual who is not formally employed by
the enterprise, but still assists the enterprise in its racketeering activities.
The RICO enterprise must have a continuous structure and purpose
independent from the racketeering activity in which it engages, and its
alleged confederates must work with a common purpose or towards a
shared goal. The RICO enterprise must also have a mechanism for directing
its affairs on an ongoing, rather than ad hoc, basis.
Summary
The passage outlines that a RICO defendant can be someone who assists the
enterprise in its activities, even if not formally employed by it. It also
emphasizes the need for a continuous structure and shared purpose among
the enterprise's members. This supports the proposition by highlighting that
distinct roles and coordinated actions among defendants can establish a
RICO conspiracy, as long as there is a shared unlawful purpose and ongoing
coordination.

RICO CONSPIRACY The essence of a RICO conspiracy is the existence of an
agreement to violate RICO's substantive provisions. RICO conspiracy was
established by proof of: (a) of an agreement to join a racketeering scheme,
(b) of the defendant's knowing engagement in the scheme with the intent
that its overall goals be effectuated, and (c) that the scheme involved, or by
agreement between any members of the conspiracy was intended to involve,
two or more predicate acts of racketeering.

Summary
Essential elements of a RICO conspiracy, which include an agreement to join
a racketeering scheme, knowing engagement in the scheme with intent to
achieve its goals, and involvement in or intent to involve two or more
predicate acts of racketeering. This directly supports the proposition that a
RICO conspiracy claim does not require each defendant to commit every
predicate act but must show a knowing agreement to further the
enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.
Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy
The Brief - American Bar Association - 2024-01-01
Extract
A violation of § 1962(c), the section on which Sedima relies, requires (1)
conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity. The plaintiff must allege each of the elements to state a claim. They
are all equally essential components, and the complaint will fail if any one of
them is not adequately pleaded... To establish aiding and abetting liability,
the plaintiff typically needs to show that the defendant had knowledge of the
underlying RICO violation and intentionally assisted or encouraged the
unlawful conduct. This can include actions that contribute to the success of
the RICO enterprise, even if the defendant did not directly commit the
predicate acts themselves.
Summary
A RICO claim under § 1962(c) requires the plaintiff to allege conduct of an
enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. The passage also
explains that aiding and abetting liability can be established if a defendant
had knowledge of the RICO violation and intentionally assisted or
encouraged the unlawful conduct, even if they did not directly commit the
predicate acts. This supports the proposition that a RICO conspiracy claim
does not require each defendant to commit every predicate act but must
show a knowing agreement to further the enterprise's affairs.
RICO: A Primer
Extract
A conspiracy may exist even if a conspirator does not agree to commit or
facilitate each and every part of the substantive offense. The partners in the
criminal plan must agree to pursue the same criminal objective and may
divide up the work, yet each is responsible for the acts of each other. If
conspirators have a plan which calls for some conspirators to perpetrate the

crime and others to provide support, the supporters are as guilty as the
perpetrators.
Summary
A RICO conspiracy does not require each conspirator to commit every act of
the offense. Instead, it is sufficient for conspirators to agree on a common
criminal objective and divide the work among themselves. This supports the
proposition that the complaint's allegations of distinct roles and coordinated
actions among the defendants can adequately plead the agreement element
of a RICO conspiracy.
