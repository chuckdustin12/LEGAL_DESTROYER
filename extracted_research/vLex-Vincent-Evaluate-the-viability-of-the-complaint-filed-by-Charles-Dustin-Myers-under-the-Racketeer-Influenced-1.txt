Question
Evaluate the viability of the complaint filed by Charles Dustin Myers under
the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C.
§§ 1962(c) and (d), including whether the allegations sufficiently establish
the elements of a RICO claim and whether the court has proper jurisdiction
and venue.
Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
To evaluate the viability of Charles Dustin Myers' RICO complaint under 18
U.S.C. §§ 1962(c) and (d), it is necessary to determine whether the
allegations sufficiently establish the required elements of a RICO claim: (1)
conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity, as well as whether the court has proper jurisdiction and venue.
Without access to the specific allegations in Myers' complaint, I can only
provide a comprehensive analysis of the legal framework and requirements
that would govern the evaluation of such a complaint.
Summary
For Charles Dustin Myers' RICO complaint to be viable under 18 U.S.C. §§
1962(c) and (d), the allegations must sufficiently establish all four essential
elements of a RICO claim: conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of
racketeering activity, along with demonstrating that the alleged conduct
caused injury to his business or property. Additionally, the complaint must
show that the court has proper jurisdiction and venue, which requires
establishing that the enterprise affects interstate commerce and that the
action is brought in a district where the defendant resides, is found, has an
agent, or transacts affairs.
The viability of the complaint will depend on specific factual allegations that
demonstrate the defendants participated in the operation or management of
the enterprise, engaged in at least two related predicate acts within a ten-
year period that show continuity, and that these acts constitute racketeering
activities as defined under 18 U.S.C. § 1961. Furthermore, for the conspiracy
claim under § 1962(d), Myers must adequately allege that each defendant
knowingly agreed that a conspirator would commit a substantive RICO
violation.

Background and Relevant Law
Legislative Framework
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) provides
both criminal and civil remedies against racketeering activities conducted
through an enterprise. The key statutory provisions relevant to Charles
Dustin Myers' complaint are:
18 U.S.C. § 1962 - Prohibited Activities
Section 1962(c), which forms the basis of Myers' first claim, states: "It shall
be unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise
engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce,
to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such
enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of
unlawful debt." 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c)
Section 1962(d), which forms the basis of Myers' second claim, makes it
"unlawful for any person to conspire to violate any of the provisions of
subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section." 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d)
18 U.S.C. § 1961 - Definitions
This section defines key terms used in RICO, including "racketeering
activity," which encompasses a wide range of state and federal offenses.
Specifically, it includes "any act or threat involving murder, kidnapping,
gambling, arson, robbery, bribery, extortion, dealing in obscene matter, or
dealing in a controlled substance or listed chemical... which is chargeable
under State law and punishable by imprisonment for more than one year." 
18 U.S.C. § 1961 It also includes numerous federal offenses such as mail
fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1341), wire fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343), and many others.
The statute further defines a "pattern of racketeering activity" as requiring
"at least two acts of racketeering activity, one of which occurred after the
effective date of this chapter and the last of which occurred within ten years
(excluding any period of imprisonment) after the commission of a prior act
of racketeering activity." 18 U.S.C. § 1961
18 U.S.C. § 1964 - Civil Remedies
This section provides the statutory basis for Myers' civil action: "Any person
injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962 of
this chapter may sue therefor in any appropriate United States district court
and shall recover threefold the damages he sustains and the cost of the suit,
including a reasonable attorney's fee..." 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c)

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
18 U.S.C. § 1965 - Venue and Process
This section establishes the venues where RICO actions may be brought:
"Any civil action or proceeding under this chapter against any person may
be instituted in the district court of the United States for any district in
which such person resides, is found, has an agent, or transacts his affairs." 
18 U.S.C. § 1965(a)
28 U.S.C. § 1331 - Federal Question
This provision establishes federal jurisdiction for RICO claims: "The district
courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the
Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States." 28 U.S.C. § 1331
Judicial Interpretation of RICO Elements
Courts have extensively interpreted the requirements for establishing a
RICO claim. The following judicial decisions provide the framework for
evaluating Myers' complaint:
Elements of a RICO Claim under § 1962(c)
Courts have consistently held that to establish a RICO claim under §
1962(c), a plaintiff must prove four essential elements: "(1) conduct (2) of an
enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity." Sedima,
S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479, 496 (1985)
This four-element test has been widely adopted across federal circuits. As
stated in Torwest DBC, Inc. v. Dick, 810 F.2d 925 (10th Cir. 1987): "A
violation of section 1962(c) thus 'requires (1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3)
through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity.'"
More recent decisions have maintained this standard. In Little v. City of
Valley, the court noted: "In order to establish a federal civil RICO violation
under § 1962(c), the Plaintiffs 'must satisfy four elements of proof: (1)
conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity.'" (quoting Jones v. Childers, 18 F.3d 899, 900 (11th Cir. 1994)).
Some courts have articulated a fifth element related to causation, as noted
in Nutrition Distribution LLC v. Custom Nutraceuticals LLC, 194 F.Supp.3d
952 (D. Ariz. 2016): "In addition, the conduct must be (5) the proximate
cause of harm to the victim."
The "Conduct" Element
The Supreme Court has interpreted the "conduct" element to require
participation in the operation or management of the enterprise. In Reves v.
Ernst Young, 507 U.S. 170, 113 S.Ct. 1163, 122 L.Ed.2d 525 (1993), the
Court held: "In order to 'participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of
such enterprise's affairs,' one must have some part in directing those
affairs." The Court then established the "operation or management" test,

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
stating that "some degree of direction" of the enterprise's affairs is required
for RICO liability.
The "Enterprise" Element
The Supreme Court has defined an "enterprise" broadly. In Boyle v. United
States, 129 S.Ct. 2237, 173 L.Ed.2d 1265, 556 U.S. 938, 77 USLW 4474
(2009), the Court explained that "an enterprise includes any union or group
of individuals associated in fact" and that RICO reaches "a group of persons
associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a course of
conduct." The Court further stated that such an enterprise "is proved by
evidence of an ongoing organization, formal or informal, and by evidence
that the various associates function as a continuing unit."
The RICO statute itself defines "enterprise" to include "any individual,
partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or
group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity." 18 U.S.C.
§ 1961(4)
The "Pattern of Racketeering Activity" Element
Courts have established that a "pattern of racketeering activity" requires
both "relationship" and "continuity" among the predicate acts. In H.J. Inc. v.
Northwestern Bell Telephone Company, 492 U.S. 229, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106
L.Ed.2d 195 (1989), the Supreme Court held that "to prove a 'pattern of
racketeering activity' a plaintiff or prosecutor must show both 'relationship'
and 'continuity'—that the racketeering predicates are related, and that they
either constitute or threaten long-term criminal activity."
The court in Ripley v. Long Distance Relocation Servs., Civil No.
CCB-19-0373 (D. Md. Oct 25, 2019) further explained: "To show a 'pattern'
of racketeering activity, the plaintiff must identify at least two related acts of
racketeering activity, occurring within 10 years of each other, and must
demonstrate 'continuity.'"
Racketeering Activity
The RICO statute defines "racketeering activity" to include numerous state
and federal offenses. For predicate acts based on fraud, courts require
heightened pleading standards. As noted in Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy:
"RICO claims based on mail or wire fraud must comport with Federal Rule of
Civil Procedure 9(b)'s requirement that allegations involving fraud be
pleaded with particularity."
RICO Conspiracy under § 1962(d)
For a conspiracy claim under § 1962(d), the plaintiff must show that
defendants agreed to violate the substantive provisions of RICO. According
to RICO: A Primer, to prove a violation of Section 1962(d), a plaintiff must
prove: "The existence of an enterprise (or that an enterprise would exist);
That the enterprise was (or would be) engaged in, or its activities affected

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
(or would affect), interstate or foreign commerce; and That each defendant
knowingly agreed that a conspirator would commit a violation of 18 U.S.C. §
1962(c)."
Standing Requirements
To establish standing for a civil RICO claim, the plaintiff must demonstrate
an injury to business or property caused by the RICO violation. As stated in 
18 U.S.C. § 1964(c): "Any person injured in his business or property by
reason of a violation of section 1962 of this chapter may sue therefor in any
appropriate United States district court..."
The courts have emphasized this requirement. In RACKETEER
INFLUENCED AND CORRUPT ORGANIZATIONS, it is noted: "To establish
standing in a civil RICO action, a plaintiff must prove the defendant's
violation of § 1962 was the proximate cause of the plaintiff's injury."
Personal injuries are insufficient to establish RICO standing: "Civil RICO
actions provide no damages for the economic consequences of personal
injuries sustained as a result of a RICO predicate act. A plaintiff's business
or property must be directly injured to qualify for relief." RACKETEER
INFLUENCED AND CORRUPT ORGANIZATIONS
Jurisdiction and Venue
Federal district courts have original jurisdiction over RICO claims because
they arise under federal law: "The district courts shall have original
jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or
treaties of the United States." 28 U.S.C. § 1331
Regarding venue, 18 U.S.C. § 1965(a) provides: "Any civil action or
proceeding under this chapter against any person may be instituted in the
district court of the United States for any district in which such person
resides, is found, has an agent, or transacts his affairs."
Analysis
Required Elements of Myers' RICO Claims
For Charles Dustin Myers' RICO complaint to be viable, it must adequately
allege all the required elements of RICO claims under both § 1962(c) and §
1962(d). Without specific details from the complaint, we can outline the
standard that would apply to evaluate its sufficiency.
1. Conduct Element
Myers must allege that each defendant participated in the operation or
management of the claimed enterprise. Under the "operation or
management" test established in Reves v. Ernst Young, 507 U.S. 170 (1993),
the defendants must have had "some part in directing [the enterprise's]

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
affairs." This does not require defendants to have primary responsibility for
the enterprise, but they must have participated to some degree in the
direction of the enterprise's affairs.
The allegations must demonstrate that the defendants were not merely
associated with the enterprise but actively conducted or participated in
conducting the enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.
As noted in Little v. City of Valley, § 1962(c) prohibits an individual from
"participating in the conduct of the affairs of an enterprise engaged in
interstate commerce, through a pattern of racketeering activity."
2. Enterprise Element
Myers must adequately allege the existence of an "enterprise" as defined
under RICO. This enterprise can be a legal entity or an informally associated
group of individuals. As clarified in Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938
(2009), an enterprise can be "any union or group of individuals associated in
fact" with "a common purpose of engaging in a course of conduct."
The enterprise must be distinct from the pattern of racketeering activity
itself. Myers needs to show "evidence of an ongoing organization, formal or
informal, and... evidence that the various associates function as a continuing
unit." Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938 (2009)
Additionally, the enterprise must "affect interstate or foreign commerce" as
required by 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). However, as noted in Civil Rico: A Tool of
Advocacy: "RICO requires no more than a slight effect upon interstate
commerce. Even a minimal effect on interstate commerce satisfies this
jurisdictional requirement."
3. Pattern of Racketeering Activity
Myers must allege a "pattern of racketeering activity" by identifying at least
two related predicate acts occurring within ten years of each other. As
established in H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Company, 492 U.S.
229 (1989), the pattern must demonstrate both "relationship" and
"continuity" among the predicate acts.
"Relationship" means the acts must have "the same or similar purposes,
results, participants, victims, or methods of commission, or otherwise are
interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not isolated events." 
RECONCEIVING COERCION-BASED CRIMINAL DEFENSES
"Continuity" refers to "either a closed period of repeated conduct, or to past
conduct that by its nature projects into the future with a threat of
repetition." RECONCEIVING COERCION-BASED CRIMINAL DEFENSES
The importance of demonstrating ongoing criminal activity is emphasized in 
Pemberton v. Walker, 22-cv-716-wmc (W.D. Wis. Feb 27, 2024): "the Supreme
Court has emphasized that RICO was enacted in response to 'long-term
criminal conduct,' not isolated or sporadic unlawful activity."

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
4. Racketeering Activity
Myers must allege specific predicate acts that qualify as "racketeering
activity" under 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1), which includes numerous state and
federal offenses. If the predicate acts involve fraud (such as mail or wire
fraud), Myers must plead these allegations with particularity as required by
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b).
As noted in Nutrition Distribution LLC v. Custom Nutraceuticals LLC, 194
F.Supp.3d 952 (D. Ariz. 2016): "The plaintiff must adequately plead the
elements of each predicate act, satisfying the pleading standard that would
apply if the predicate act were a stand-alone claim."
5. RICO Conspiracy Claim under § 1962(d)
For the conspiracy claim under § 1962(d), Myers must allege that each
defendant knowingly agreed that someone would commit a substantive
RICO violation. According to RICO: A Primer, this requires showing:
"The existence of an enterprise (or that an enterprise would exist);"
"That the enterprise was (or would be) engaged in, or its activities
affected (or would affect), interstate or foreign commerce;" and
"That each defendant knowingly agreed that a conspirator would
commit a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c)."
It's important to note that a RICO conspiracy is distinct from a conspiracy to
commit individual predicate acts. As explained in Crimes: "A conspiracy to
commit predicate acts of racketeering is different in kind from a conspiracy
to conduct the affairs of the enterprise through a pattern of racketeering
activity."
6. Standing Requirements
Myers must demonstrate that he suffered an injury to his business or
property caused by the alleged RICO violations. Personal injuries or
emotional distress are insufficient for RICO standing. As noted in Burnett v.
Al Baraka Inv. And Development Corp., 274 F.Supp.2d 86 (D. D.C. 2003):
"The plaintiffs in this case have alleged personal injuries, and economic
losses derived therefrom, but not any specific injuries to business or
property that are separate from their personal injuries."
Myers must also establish proximate causation between the RICO violation
and his injury. According to DEFENDING RICO CLAIMS IN THE BUSINESS
CONTEXT PART II: RICO CLAIMS MUST ALLEGE INJURY TO BUSINESS
OR PROPERTY: "the plaintiff must allege that he suffered an injury to his
business or property that bears some causal relationship to the alleged act
or acts that violated RICO."

Jurisdiction and Venue Analysis
Subject Matter Jurisdiction
Federal district courts have subject matter jurisdiction over RICO claims
under federal question jurisdiction. As provided in 28 U.S.C. § 1331: "The
district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising
under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States." Since RICO is
a federal statute, any civil action brought under RICO would fall under
federal jurisdiction.
Venue
For venue to be proper, Myers' complaint must establish that the action was
filed in a district where at least one defendant "resides, is found, has an
agent, or transacts his affairs" as required by 18 U.S.C. § 1965(a).
Additionally, 18 U.S.C. § 1965(b) provides that if the "ends of justice
require," other parties residing in other districts can be brought before the
court where the action was initially filed.
Potential Challenges to Myers' RICO
Complaint
Without the details of Myers' specific allegations, we can identify several
common challenges that RICO complaints frequently face:
1. Failure to Adequately Allege an Enterprise
Myers must clearly identify an enterprise that is distinct from the pattern of
racketeering activity itself. As the Supreme Court established, an
"enterprise" must have some structure and continuity beyond the predicate
acts.
2. Inadequate Pleading of Predicate Acts
If Myers' complaint relies on fraud-based predicate acts, these must be
pleaded with particularity under Rule 9(b). Failure to specify the time, place,
and content of the alleged fraudulent conduct could be grounds for
dismissal.
3. Failure to Establish a Pattern of Racketeering Activity
Myers must allege at least two related predicate acts within a ten-year
period that demonstrate both "relationship" and "continuity." If the alleged
acts are isolated or sporadic, they may not satisfy the pattern requirement.

=== PAGE 9 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
4. Lack of Standing
If Myers fails to allege a concrete injury to his business or property that was
proximately caused by the RICO violation, his standing could be challenged.
Personal injuries or emotional distress are insufficient.
5. Prior Criminal Conviction Requirement
It is worth noting that there was previously a split in the circuits regarding
whether prior criminal convictions were required for RICO civil actions. In 
Bernstein v. Bank Leumi Le-Israel BM, 598 F. Supp. 922 (E.D. Pa. 1984), the
court held that "in order to bring a civil RICO action, plaintiffs must
establish that defendants have been convicted of the underlying predicate
offenses."
However, this view was later rejected by the Supreme Court in Sedima,
S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479 (1985), which held that prior criminal
convictions are not required for civil RICO actions. Thus, Myers is not
required to show prior criminal convictions for the alleged predicate acts.
Conclusion
The viability of Charles Dustin Myers' RICO complaint under 18 U.S.C. §§
1962(c) and (d) depends on whether his allegations sufficiently establish all
required elements of a RICO claim and whether the court has proper
jurisdiction and venue.
To survive judicial scrutiny, the complaint must adequately allege:
That each defendant conducted or participated in the conduct of
An enterprise that affects interstate commerce
Through a pattern (demonstrating relationship and continuity)
Of racketeering activity (qualifying predicate acts under 18 U.S.C. §
1961)
For the conspiracy claim under § 1962(d), Myers must adequately allege that
each defendant knowingly agreed that someone would commit a substantive
RICO violation.
Additionally, Myers must demonstrate standing by showing an injury to his
business or property that was proximately caused by the RICO violation.
Personal injuries or emotional distress alone would be insufficient.
Federal jurisdiction is established under 28 U.S.C. § 1331, and venue is
proper in any district where at least one defendant "resides, is found, has an
agent, or transacts his affairs" under 18 U.S.C. § 1965(a).
Without the specific allegations contained in Myers' complaint, it is
impossible to determine with certainty whether the complaint satisfies these
requirements. However, the legal framework outlined above provides the
standard against which the complaint should be evaluated.

Gutierrez v. Givens, 1 F.Supp.2d 1077 (S.D. Cal. 1998)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of California
Extract
To state a cause of action under RICO, Plaintiffs must establish (1) conduct
(2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity (5)
causing injury to the Plaintiffs' business or property by the conduct
constituting the violation. See Sedima v. Imrex Co., Inc., 473 U.S. 479, 496,
105 S.Ct. 3275, 87 L.Ed.2d 346 (1985).
Summary
Essential elements required to establish a RICO claim: conduct, enterprise,
pattern of racketeering activity, and injury to business or property. This
framework is crucial for evaluating the viability of any RICO complaint,
including the one filed by Charles Dustin Myers. The passage does not
address jurisdiction or venue directly but focuses on the substantive
elements of a RICO claim.
Dooley v. United Technologies Corp., 786 F.Supp. 65 (D. D.C. 1992)
U.S. District Court — District of Columbia
Extract
The Court finds two alternative bases on which to exercise personal
jurisdiction over the defendants in this case. First, the Court finds that RICO
provides for nationwide service of process under section 1965(d).
Alternatively, the Court finds that it has personal jurisdiction over each
defendant under the 'transacting business clause' of the District of Columbia
long-arm statute. Because the Court finds that it may exercise personal
jurisdiction over all the defendants under either RICO section 1965(d) or
section 13-423(a)(1) of the District of Columbia long-arm statute, it does not
reach the question of whether any of the other grounds asserted by the
plaintiff also support this Court's exercise of personal jurisdiction in this
case.
Summary
The court in "Dooley v. United Technologies Corp." found that RICO provides
for nationwide service of process under section 1965(d), which can establish
personal jurisdiction over defendants in RICO cases. Additionally, the court
found that personal jurisdiction could also be established under the
"transacting business clause" of the District of Columbia long-arm statute.
This suggests that in RICO cases, courts may have broad jurisdictional

reach, which is relevant to determining whether the court has proper
jurisdiction in Charles Dustin Myers' RICO complaint.
Rodriguez v. Pan Am. Health Org., 612 F.Supp.3d 1372 (S.D. Fla. 2020)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of Florida
Extract
Plaintiffs' final argument is that RICO's venue provision supersedes Section
1391(f). See 18 U.S.C. § 1965 (defining venue for civil actions under RICO).
Plaintiffs reason that RICO's alternative venue provision applies here
because Section 1391's introductory provision states that the Section 'shall'
control venue in all actions 'except as otherwise provided by law.' § 1391(a).
Plaintiffs argue Section 1391(a) therefore encompasses RICO's alternative
venue provision, which supersedes any exclusivity implied by the FSIA and
Section 1391(f). ... Therefore, the Court finds that Plaintiffs cannot use
RICO's venue provision to establish venue in the Southern District of
Florida.
Summary
The court in Rodriguez v. Pan Am. Health Org. addressed the issue of
whether RICO's venue provision could supersede other statutory venue
provisions, specifically those under the FSIA. The court concluded that
RICO's venue provision does not supersede the FSIA's venue restrictions,
indicating that RICO's venue provision cannot be used to establish venue in
a district where it is otherwise improper under the FSIA. This suggests that
in evaluating the viability of a RICO complaint, it is crucial to consider
whether the venue is proper under applicable statutory provisions, and not
solely rely on RICO's venue provision.
Magic Toyota v. Southeast Toyota Distributors, 784 F.Supp. 306 (D. S.C.
1992)
U.S. District Court — District of South Carolina
Extract
Plaintiffs assert that venue is proper as to these three defendants pursuant
to 18 U.S.C. § 1965(a) and (b) and 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2). The Court will first
analyze whether venue properly lies in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §
1391, the general venue statute... Failing to find proper venue here pursuant
to § 1391, the Court next turns to § 1965(a) and (b) of RICO to determine
whether they provide an alternative source of venue in this District. The
venue provisions of RICO are supplemental to those found in § 1391.

=== PAGE 12 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
If venue is not proper under the general statute, the court will look to the
RICO-specific provisions as a supplemental source for establishing venue.
Republic of Panama v. BCCI Holdings (Luxembourg) S.A., 119 F.3d 935 (11th
Cir. 1997)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Eleventh Circuit
Extract
The First American defendants nevertheless contend that we need not
decide whether the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause limits the reach of
RICO's nationwide service of process provision because, having failed to
state a claim under RICO, Panama should not be allowed to utilize that
statute's nationwide service of process provision to establish jurisdiction
over them. ... We adopt the same approach and conclude that insofar as an
asserted federal claim is not wholly immaterial or insubstantial, a plaintiff is
entitled to take advantage of the federal statute's nationwide service of
process provision. ... Similarly, Panama does not allege, or provide us with
sufficient facts to infer, the agreement between BCCI and the First American
defendants necessary to support their RICO conspiracy claim under §
1962(d) of the RICO statute. Section 1962(d) makes it unlawful to conspire
to violate any of the substantive provisions of RICO, including § 1962(c). A
plaintiff can establish a RICO conspiracy claim in one of two ways: (1) by
showing that the defendant agreed to the overall objective of the conspiracy;
or (2) by showing that the defendant agreed to commit two predicate acts.
Summary
Requirements for establishing jurisdiction under RICO's nationwide service
of process provision and the elements necessary to state a RICO conspiracy
claim under § 1962(d). It highlights that a plaintiff must allege a non-
immaterial or substantial federal claim to utilize the nationwide service of
process provision. Additionally, for a RICO conspiracy claim, the plaintiff
must show either an agreement to the overall objective of the conspiracy or
an agreement to commit two predicate acts. These insights are relevant to
evaluating the viability of a RICO complaint, as they provide guidance on
jurisdictional and substantive requirements.
Burnett v. Al Baraka Inv. And Development Corp., 274 F.Supp.2d 86 (D. D.C.
2003)
U.S. District Court — District of Columbia

=== PAGE 13 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
A civil cause of action will lie under RICO for '[a]ny person injured in his
business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962 ....' 18 U.S.C. §
1964(c). This language has been construed as conferring standing, without
which a plaintiff may not maintain a RICO claim. Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex
Co., Inc., 473 U.S. 479, 496, 105 S.Ct. 3275, 87 L.Ed.2d 346 (1985). The
plaintiffs in this case have alleged personal injuries, and economic losses
derived therefrom, but not any specific injuries to business or property that
are separate from their personal injuries.
Summary
The plaintiffs in the Burnett case failed to establish such an injury, leading to
the dismissal of their RICO claims.
United States v. Iossifov, 45 F.4th 899 (6th Cir. 2022)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Sixth Circuit
Extract
Because the preponderance of the evidence shows that 'an act in
furtherance of the attempt or conspiracy took place' in the Eastern District
of Kentucky, the district court's venue determination was proper. 18 U.S.C. §
1956(i)(2) ; see also Whitfield, 543 U.S. at 218, 125 S.Ct. 687.
Summary
For a RICO claim, the venue is proper if an act in furtherance of the
conspiracy took place in the district where the case is being tried. This is
relevant to determining whether the court has proper jurisdiction and venue
for Charles Dustin Myers' RICO complaint.
D'Addario v. Geller, 264 F.Supp.2d 367 (E.D. Va. 2003)
U.S. District Court — Eastern District of Virginia
Extract
Title 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) provides that 'it shall be unlawful for any person
employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities
of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate,
directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a
pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt.' According to
18 U.S.C. § 1961, racketeering must involve the commission of two or more
predicate acts, including mail fraud and obstruction of justice. A plaintiff
must plead all elements of the alleged violation of section 1962 in order to

state a civil claim under section 1964(c). Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex, Co., 473
U.S. 479, 496, 105 S.Ct. 3275, 87 L.Ed.2d 346 (1985).
Summary
To establish a RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), a plaintiff must
demonstrate that the defendant was involved in an enterprise affecting
interstate or foreign commerce and engaged in a pattern of racketeering
activity, which includes committing two or more predicate acts such as mail
fraud or obstruction of justice. The plaintiff must plead all elements of the
alleged violation to state a civil claim under section 1964(c). This
information is crucial for evaluating whether Charles Dustin Myers'
complaint sufficiently establishes the elements of a RICO claim.

2020)
U.S. District Court — District of New Hampshire
Extract
Several motions to dismiss the plaintiff's claims against defendants in this
civil action brought under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act (RICO) turn on whether this court may exercise personal
jurisdiction over non-resident defendants under (i) New Hampshire's long-
arm statute, N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 510:4, (ii) RICO, 18 U.S.C. § 1965, or (iii)
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(k)(2), often referred to as the 'federal,
long-arm' rule. And whether the court dismisses the action entirely or
transfers it to one or more other jurisdictions depends on whether the
plaintiff has carried his burden of demonstrating that the case could have
been brought in those jurisdictions.
Summary
Jurisdictional challenges in a RICO case, specifically the need for
establishing personal jurisdiction over non-resident defendants. It highlights
the importance of demonstrating minimum contacts with the forum state or
using federal rules to establish jurisdiction. This is relevant to evaluating the
viability of a RICO complaint, as jurisdiction is a critical component.

Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C. § 1964-1968. 'Any person injured in his business or
property by reason of a violation of section 1962' may invoke the civil RICO
remedies. 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c). If the plaintiff proves its injury resulted from
a violation of § 1962, the plaintiff is entitled to 'recover threefold the
damages he sustain[ed] and the cost of the suit, including a reasonable
attorney's fee.' 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c).
Summary
General explanation of the civil RICO statute, specifically 18 U.S.C. §
1964(c), which allows any person injured in their business or property by a
violation of section 1962 to seek civil remedies. This includes the potential
to recover treble damages and attorney's fees. This information is crucial for
evaluating the viability of a RICO complaint, as it outlines the legal basis for
a private party to bring a RICO claim and the potential outcomes if the claim
is successful.
Boyle v. United States, 129 S.Ct. 2237, 173 L.Ed.2d 1265, 556 U.S. 938, 77
USLW 4474 (2009)
U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
RICO makes it “unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any
enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign
commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of
such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.” 18
U.S.C. § 1962(c) (emphasis added). ... In light of these statutory features, we
explained in Turkette that “an enterprise includes any union or group of
individuals associated in fact” and that RICO reaches “a group of persons
associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a course of
conduct.” 452 U.S., at 580, 583, 101 S.Ct. 2524. Such an enterprise, we said,
“is proved by evidence of an ongoing organization, formal or informal, and
by evidence that the various associates function as a continuing unit.” Id., at
583, 101 S.Ct. 2524.
Summary
The U.S. Supreme Court in Boyle v. United States clarified the definition of
an "enterprise" under RICO. The Court emphasized that an enterprise can
be any group of individuals associated in fact, with or without a formal
structure, as long as they function as a continuing unit with a common
purpose. This interpretation is crucial for evaluating whether the allegations
in Charles Dustin Myers' complaint sufficiently establish the elements of a
RICO claim, particularly the existence of an enterprise. The passage also
highlights that the enterprise must affect interstate or foreign commerce,
which is relevant for determining jurisdiction.

Reves v. Ernst Young, 507 U.S. 170, 113 S.Ct. 1163, 122 L.Ed.2d 525 (1993)
U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
A provision of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act
(RICO), 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), makes it unlawful 'for any person employed by
or associated with [an interstate] enterprise... to conduct or participate,
directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a
pattern of racketeering activity....' ... The question presented is whether one
must participate in the operation or management of the enterprise itself to
be subject to liability under this provision. ... Once we understand the word
'conduct' to require some degree of direction and the word 'participate' to
require some part in that direction, the meaning of § 1962(c) comes into
focus. In order to 'participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such
enterprise's affairs,' one must have some part in directing those affairs. ...
The 'operation or management' test expresses this requirement in a
formulation that is easy to apply.
Summary
Liability under this provision is not limited to those with primary
responsibility or formal positions within the enterprise, but some degree of
direction or participation in the management of the enterprise's affairs is
required. This interpretation is crucial for evaluating whether the
allegations in Charles Dustin Myers' complaint sufficiently establish the
elements of a RICO claim.
Inc v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Company, 492 U.S. 229, 109 S.Ct. 2893,
106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989)
U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
RICO's legislative history, however, establishes that Congress intended that
to prove a 'pattern of racketeering activity' a plaintiff or prosecutor must
show both 'relationship' and 'continuity'—that the racketeering predicates
are related, and that they either constitute or threaten long-term criminal
activity... Neither RICO's language nor its legislative history supports a rule
that a defendant's racketeering activities form a pattern only if they are
characteristic of organized crime... RICO renders criminally and civilly liable
'any person' who uses or invests income derived 'from a pattern of
racketeering activity' to acquire an interest in or to operate an enterprise
engaged in interstate commerce, § 1962(a); who acquires or maintains an
interest in or control of such an enterprise 'through a pattern of
racketeering activity,' § 1962(b); who, being employed by or associated with
such an enterprise, conducts or participates in the conduct of its affairs

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
'through a pattern of racketeering activity,' § 1962(c); or, finally, who
conspires to violate the first three subsections of § 1962, § 1962(d).
Summary
To establish a RICO claim, a plaintiff must demonstrate a "pattern of
racketeering activity," which requires showing both "relationship" and
"continuity" of the criminal acts. It also emphasizes that RICO applies
broadly and is not limited to organized crime, meaning that individuals or
legitimate businesses can be liable under RICO if they engage in a pattern of
racketeering activity. This interpretation is crucial for evaluating the
viability of a RICO complaint, as it outlines the necessary elements that must
be alleged and proven.
Sedima v. Imrex Company, Inc, 473 U.S. 479, 105 S.Ct. 3275, 87 L.Ed.2d 346
(1985)
U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C.
§§ 1961-1968, which is directed at 'racketeering activity'—defined in §
1961(1) to encompass, inter alia, acts 'indictable' under specific federal
criminal provisions, including mail and wire fraud—provides in § 1964(c) for
a private civil action to recover treble damages by any person injured in his
business or property 'by reason of a violation of section 1962.' Section
1962(c) prohibits conducting or participating in the conduct of an enterprise
'through a pattern of racketeering activity.'
Summary
The passage provides insight into the requirements for a RICO claim under
18 U.S.C. §§ 1962(c) and (d). It explains that RICO targets "racketeering
activity," which includes acts indictable under federal criminal provisions
such as mail and wire fraud. Section 1964(c) allows for a private civil action
to recover treble damages for injuries caused by a violation of section 1962.
Section 1962(c) specifically prohibits conducting or participating in an
enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. This information is
crucial for evaluating whether Charles Dustin Myers' complaint sufficiently
establishes the elements of a RICO claim, as it outlines the necessary
components of such a claim.
Bernstein v. Bank Leumi Le-Israel BM, 598 F. Supp. 922 (E.D. Pa. 1984)
U.S. District Court — Eastern District of Pennsylvania

=== PAGE 18 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
Defendants argue that the RICO count must be dismissed since plaintiffs
have failed to allege that defendants have been convicted of any of the
predicate acts listed in the RICO statute. See 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1). The court
finds this argument persuasive and shall dismiss the complaint on that
basis... Although the Third Circuit Court of Appeals has not addressed the
question of whether a prior criminal conviction is a prerequisite to a civil
RICO action, other courts have answered the question in the affirmative. In
Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., Inc., 741 F.2d 482, 496 (2d Cir.1984), the
second circuit held that in order to bring a civil RICO action, plaintiffs must
establish that defendants have been convicted of the underlying predicate
offenses... This court agrees with and adopts the Sedima and Viola opinions
to the extent they require criminal convictions of the underlying predicate
offenses prior to commencement of a civil RICO action.
Summary
The court in Bernstein v. Bank Leumi Le-Israel BM dismissed a RICO claim
because the plaintiffs failed to allege that the defendants had been convicted
of the predicate acts. The court followed the reasoning in Sedima, which
requires a prior criminal conviction for the underlying predicate offenses in
a civil RICO action. This suggests that for a civil RICO claim to be viable,
there must be allegations of prior criminal convictions for the predicate acts.

A violation of section 1962(c) thus 'requires (1) conduct (2) of an enterprise
(3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity.' Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex
Co., 473 U.S. 479, 105 S.Ct. 3275, 3285, 87 L.Ed.2d 346 (1985). RICO
defines racketeering activity as, inter alia, any act that is indictable under
18 U.S.C. Sec. 1341 (mail fraud) or 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1343 (wire fraud). See 18
U.S.C. Sec. 1961(1)(B). RICO also states that a 'pattern of racketeering
activity' requires at least two acts of racketeering activity.
Summary
To establish a RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), a plaintiff must
demonstrate four elements: conduct, of an enterprise, through a pattern, of
racketeering activity. The passage also clarifies that racketeering activity
includes acts indictable under specific sections such as mail and wire fraud,
and that a pattern requires at least two acts of such activity. This
information is crucial for evaluating whether Charles Dustin Myers'
complaint sufficiently establishes a RICO claim.
Nutrition Distribution LLC v. Custom Nutraceuticals LLC, 194 F.Supp.3d 952
(D. Ariz. 2016)
U.S. District Court — District of Arizona
Extract
RICO makes it unlawful for 'any person employed by or associated with any
enterprise engaged in...interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or
participate...in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of
racketeering activity.' 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). 'Racketeering activity' includes
any of several listed crimes 'which is chargeable under State law and
punishable by imprisonment for more than one year,' as well as any act
chargeable under one of several enumerated federal statutes. § 1961(1). A
'pattern of racketeering activity' requires at least two acts of racketeering
activity, which must be 'related' and 'amount to or pose a threat of continued
criminal activity.' ... To state a RICO civil claim, a plaintiff must allege '(1)
the conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity.' Eclectic Props. E., LLC v. Marcus & Millichap Co., 751 F.3d 990,
997 (9th Cir.2014) (citation omitted). 'In addition, the conduct must be (5)
the proximate cause of harm to the victim.' Id. (citation omitted). Pleading a
pattern of racketeering activity requires the plaintiff to allege that the
defendant participated in at least two acts that were chargeable under the
enumerated federal statutes. The plaintiff must adequately plead the

=== PAGE 20 ===

elements of each predicate act, satisfying the pleading standard that would
apply if the predicate act were a stand-alone claim.
Summary
Essential elements required to establish a RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. §
1962(c). It specifies that a plaintiff must allege conduct of an enterprise
through a pattern of racketeering activity, which includes at least two acts of
racketeering that are related and pose a threat of continued criminal
activity. Additionally, the conduct must be the proximate cause of harm to
the victim. The passage also emphasizes the need for specificity in pleading
the elements of each predicate act, which must meet the standard required
if the predicate act were a stand-alone claim. This information is crucial for
evaluating whether Charles Dustin Myers' complaint sufficiently establishes
the elements of a RICO claim.
Sheftelman v. Jones, 605 F.Supp. 549 (N.D. Ga. 1984)
U.S. District Court — Northern District of Georgia
Extract
Plaintiff must allege the existence of seven elements to satisfy the pleading
burden under the substantive RICO statute: (1) that the defendant (2)
through the commission of two or more acts (3) constituting a 'pattern' (4) of
'racketeering activity' (5) directly or indirectly invests in, or maintains an
interest in, or participates in (6) an 'enterprise' (7) the activities of which
affect interstate or foreign commerce. ... The court finds that the plaintiff's
RICO count in the Amended Complaint contains two glaring and fatal
defects: a failure to allege a violation of section 1962 and a failure to allege
an injury by reason of a violation of section 1962.
Summary
Essential elements required to establish a RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. §
1962, which are generally applicable to any RICO case. It highlights the
necessity of alleging a violation of section 1962 and an injury resulting from
such a violation. The court in "Sheftelman v. Jones" dismissed the RICO
claim due to the plaintiff's failure to allege these critical elements,
emphasizing their importance in establishing a viable RICO claim.

burdens. First, he must allege that the defendant has violated the
substantive RICO statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1962 (1976), commonly known as
'criminal RICO.' In so doing, he must allege the existence of seven
constituent elements: (1) that the defendant (2) through the commission of
two or more acts (3) constituting a 'pattern' (4) of 'racketeering activity' (5)
directly or indirectly invests in, or maintains an interest in, or participates in
(6) an 'enterprise' (7) the activities of which affect interstate or foreign
commerce.... Plaintiff must allege adequately defendant's violation of section
1962 before turning to the second burden — i.e., invoking RICO's civil
remedies of treble damages, attorneys fees and costs....

Little v. City of Valley
U.S. District Court — Middle District of Alabama
Extract
Plaintiffs bring their RICO claim solely under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). Under §
1962(c), it is illegal “for any person employed by or associated with any
enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign
commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of
such enterprise&#39;s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity[.]”
18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). In other words, § 1962(c) prohibits an individual from
“participating in the conduct of the affairs of an enterprise engaged in
interstate commerce, through a pattern of racketeering activity.” Almanza v.
United Airlines, Inc., 851 F.3d 1060, 1066 (11th Cir. 2017). Thus, in order to
establish a federal civil RICO violation under § 1962(c), the Plaintiffs “must
satisfy four elements of proof: ‘(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a
pattern (4) of racketeering activity.&#39;” Jones v. Childers, 18 F.3d 899,

corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of
individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.” 18 U.S.C. §
1961(4). Under RICO, “racketeering activity” includes such predicate acts as
extortion under state law and the Hobbs Act. See 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1). “A
pattern is established by at least two acts of racketeering activity the last
which occurred within ten years. .. after the commission of a prior act of

18 U.S.C. § 1962 18 U.S.C. § 1962 Prohibited Activities
Extract
It shall be unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any
enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign
commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of
such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity or
collection of unlawful debt. It shall be unlawful for any person to conspire to
violate any of the provisions of subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section.
Summary
The RICO Act makes it unlawful for individuals associated with an enterprise
affecting interstate or foreign commerce to engage in or conspire to engage
in racketeering activities. This is directly relevant to evaluating whether
Charles Dustin Myers' complaint under RICO sufficiently establishes the
elements of a RICO claim, as it outlines the prohibited activities under the

28 U.S.C. § 1391 28 U.S.C. § 1391 Venue Generally
Extract
A civil action may be brought in- a judicial district in which any defendant
resides, if all defendants are residents of the State in which the district is
located; a judicial district in which a substantial part of the events or
omissions giving rise to the claim occurred, or a substantial part of property
that is the subject of the action is situated; or if there is no district in which
an action may otherwise be brought as provided in this section, any judicial
district in which any defendant is subject to the court's personal jurisdiction
with respect to such action.
Summary
28 U.S.C. § 1391 provides the general rules for determining the proper
venue for civil actions in U.S. district courts. It specifies that a civil action
may be brought in a judicial district where any defendant resides, where a
substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred,

Extract
The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising
under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.
Summary
28 U.S.C. § 1331 provides federal district courts with original jurisdiction
over civil actions that arise under federal laws. Since RICO is a federal

Extract
Any person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of
section 1962 of this chapter may sue therefor in any appropriate United
States district court and shall recover threefold the damages he sustains and
the cost of the suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee, except that no
person may rely upon any conduct that would have been actionable as fraud
in the purchase or sale of securities to establish a violation of section 1962.
Summary
The U.S. district courts have jurisdiction over civil RICO claims, and
individuals injured in their business or property due to a violation of section
1962 can file a lawsuit. The passage also specifies that damages can be
trebled, and attorney's fees can be recovered. However, it excludes claims
based on securities fraud unless there is a criminal conviction related to the
fraud. This information is crucial for evaluating the viability of Charles
Dustin Myers' complaint under RICO, as it outlines the jurisdictional basis
and potential remedies available.

Summary
Comprehensive list of activities that qualify as racketeering under the RICO
statute. For a complaint to be viable under RICO, it must allege that the
defendant engaged in a "pattern of racketeering activity," which requires at
least two acts of racketeering activity as defined in this section. The passage
also outlines the types of crimes that can be considered racketeering
activities, which are essential for determining whether the allegations in the
complaint meet the statutory requirements.

Extract
Standing for a civil cause of action under RICO is established when a
plaintiff shows: a violation of § 1962(a), (b), (c), ... the Supreme Court
considered the issue of standing where the underlying violation was an
alleged RICO conspiracy prohibited by § 1962(d). The Court held that an
injury caused by an overt act that is neither an act of racketeering nor
otherwise unlawful under RICO is insufficient to establish standing in a civil
RICO suit. Consequently, a plaintiff bringing a civil RICO claim for injuries
sustained from a violation of § 1962(d) must demonstrate that the injuries
arose from a predicate act wrongful under RICO. Civil RICO actions provide
no damages for the economic consequences of personal injuries sustained as
a result of a RICO predicate act. A plaintiff’s business or property must be
directly injured to qualify for relief. Moreover, to establish standing in a civil
RICO action, a plaintiff must prove the defendant’s violation of § 1962 was
the proximate cause of the plaintiff’s injury.
Summary
Requirements for establishing standing in a civil RICO action, which is
crucial for evaluating the viability of a complaint under RICO. It specifies
that a plaintiff must demonstrate a violation of § 1962 and that the injury
must arise from a predicate act that is wrongful under RICO. Additionally,
the injury must be to the plaintiff's business or property, and the defendant's
violation must be the proximate cause of the injury. This information is

Corporate Criminal Liability: End It, Don't Mend It.
The Journal of Corporation Law - University of Iowa Journal of
Corporation Law - Smith, Stephen F. - 2022-06-22
Extract
Subsection 1962(c), the most commonly used basis for substantive RICO
charges, is instructive. It imposes civil and criminal liability on the persons
'employed by or associated with' organized-crime syndicates or other RICO
'enterprises' who 'conduct, or participate in the conduct of, the [enterprise's]
affairs' through a 'pattern of racketeering activity.' (18) Although, as used in
federal law, the term 'persons' can be construed to encompass corporations
and certain other legal entities depending on context, (19) RICO defines
'person' narrowly so as to exclude organized crime syndicates. (20)
Congress thus recognized that the vital objective of eradicating organized
crime could be fully accomplished by taking aim at those who commit the
racketeering activities...
Summary
The passage provides insight into the requirements for a RICO claim under
18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), which is relevant to evaluating the viability of a
complaint under this statute. It explains that liability is imposed on
individuals associated with a RICO enterprise who conduct its affairs
through a pattern of racketeering activity. This is crucial for determining
whether the allegations in Charles Dustin Myers' complaint sufficiently
establish the elements of a RICO claim. The passage also clarifies the
definition of "person" under RICO, which is important for understanding who
can be held liable.
Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy
The Brief - American Bar Association - 2024-01-01
Extract
A violation of § 1962(c), the section on which Sedima relies, requires (1)
conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity. The plaintiff must allege each of the elements to state a claim. They
are all equally essential components, and the complaint will fail if any one of
them is not adequately pleaded. In particular, RICO claims based on mail or
wire fraud must comport with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b)’s
requirement that allegations involving fraud be pleaded with particularity.
The practitioner through their pleadings must articulate with great care and

=== PAGE 30 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
attention a viable racketeering claim. In addition, § 1962(a), (b), and (c) are
limited in scope to conduct involving enterprises engaged in or the activities
of which affect interstate commerce. It is the activities of the enterprise, not
each predicate act, that must affect interstate or foreign commerce. RICO
requires no more than a slight effect upon interstate commerce. Even a
minimal effect on interstate commerce satisfies this jurisdictional
requirement.
Summary
To establish a RICO claim under § 1962(c), the plaintiff must allege and
prove four essential elements: conduct, enterprise, pattern, and
racketeering activity. Each element is crucial, and failure to adequately
plead any one of them will result in the complaint's failure. Additionally, the
activities of the enterprise must affect interstate commerce, even if only
slightly, to satisfy jurisdictional requirements. The passage also highlights
the need for particularity in pleading fraud-related RICO claims, in
compliance with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b).
PAYORS, PLAYERS, AND PROXIMATE CAUSE.
Notre Dame Law Review - University of Notre Dame Law School -
Crusey, Elisabeth F. - 2022-05-01
Extract
RICO is not just a tool for government control over organized crime. It is
also a remedial statute for civil matters. (31) It 'authorize[s]... criminal or
civil remedies on conduct already criminal, when performed in a specified
fashion' as delineated by the statute. (32) Section 1962 provides civil
remedies for four types of conduct: (1) using income derived from a pattern
of racketeering activity (33) to acquire an interest in an enterprise; (2)
acquiring or maintaining an interest in an enterprise through a pattern of
racketeering activity; (3) conducting the affairs of an enterprise through a
pattern of racketeering activity; and (4) conspiring to commit any of these
offenses. (34) Today, Congress urges courts to construe RICO liberally from
the 'perspective of the victim, not the perpetrator.' (35) A private civil right
of action in [section] 1964 provides that '[a]ny person injured in his business
or property by reason of a violation of section 1962... may sue.' (36) Notably,
a successful plaintiff under [section] 1964 is entitled to treble damages and
the cost of the suit, including attorney fees. (37)
Summary
Four types of conduct under Section 1962 that can form the basis of a RICO
claim. It also highlights the liberal construction of RICO from the victim's
perspective and the potential for treble damages and attorney fees for
successful plaintiffs. This information is crucial for evaluating whether
Charles Dustin Myers' complaint sufficiently establishes the elements of a
RICO claim.

The RICO statute defines racketeering activity to include a variety of
criminal acts, both state and federal, that are punishable by more than one
year of imprisonment. This definition is crucial for determining whether the
allegations in a RICO complaint sufficiently establish the elements of a RICO
claim. The passage provides the foundational legal framework necessary to

RECONCEIVING COERCION-BASED CRIMINAL DEFENSES.
Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology - Northwestern University,
School of Law - Galoob, Stephen R. - 2022-03-22
Extract
The inquiry here is meant to invoke the 'pattern of racketeering activity'
element of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).
The Organized Crime Control Act (1970), which includes RICO, provides that
'criminal conduct forms a pattern if it embraces criminal acts that have the
same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of
commission, or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics
and are not isolated events.' The Supreme Court characterized this
requirement as a 'relationship' element and held that the statute further
requires a 'continuity' element, 'referring either to a closed period of
repeated conduct, or to past conduct that by its nature projects into the
future with a threat of repetition.'

=== PAGE 32 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
The passage provides insight into the requirements for establishing a
"pattern of racketeering activity" under RICO, which is crucial for evaluating
the viability of a RICO claim. It explains that a pattern involves criminal acts
with similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods, and that
these acts must be interrelated and not isolated. Additionally, the Supreme
Court's interpretation requires a "relationship" and "continuity" element,
meaning the conduct must either be repeated over a closed period or project
into the future with a threat of repetition. This information is essential for
assessing whether Charles Dustin Myers' allegations meet the necessary
criteria for a RICO claim.
Spoofing and Layering.
The Journal of Corporation Law - University of Iowa Journal of
Corporation Law - Mark, Gideon - 2020-01-01
Extract
Fourth, most recently the DOJ aggressively added the Racketeer Influenced
and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) (231) to its toolbox. In August 2019
three JPMorgan Chase traders who allegedly placed thousands of spoof
orders on COMEX and New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc. (NYMEX) during
the period May 2008 to August 2016 were indicted in the Northern District
of Illinois on multiple counts, including a RICO conspiracy count. (232)
White collar criminal cases involving RICO charges are rare, and this
indictment included the first RICO charges in a spoofing or layering case
(233) and the first RICO charges against any Wall Street traders since the
mid-1980s. (234) The 2019 indictment essentially alleges that the three
traders converted the bank's precious metals trading desk into a criminal
enterprise. A RICO charge may be easier for the government to prove than a
pure spoofing charge because jurors 'are likely to have a more intuitive
understanding of criminal enterprises than of spoofing,' (235) so if the
prosecution is successful then this case may serve as a template in future
spoofing cases. (236)
Summary
The passage provides insight into the use of RICO in financial fraud cases,
particularly spoofing and layering. It highlights a precedent where RICO
was successfully applied, suggesting that RICO can be a viable tool in
prosecuting complex financial fraud cases. This is relevant to evaluating the
viability of a RICO complaint, as it demonstrates that RICO can be applied in
similar contexts and may be easier to prove than other charges due to
jurors' understanding of criminal enterprises.

Extract
In a substantive Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO)
prosecution, the five-year statute of limitations begins from the date of the
last predicate act in which the defendant personally participated, not the
date of the last predicate act committed by the enterprise as a whole. State
must specifically plead a RICO conspiracy if it intends to charge a defendant
accordingly. In a RICO conspiracy, the crime is premised not upon the
commission of the predicate acts of racketeering, or even an agreement to
commit predicate acts, but upon an agreement to participate in the affairs of
the criminal enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. While the
state may plead and prove a substantive RICO charge by establishing a
pattern of racketeering activity that includes conspiracies to commit
predicate acts, this does not convert a plainly pleaded substantive RICO
charge into a RICO conspiracy. A conspiracy to commit predicate acts of
racketeering is different in kind from a conspiracy to conduct the affairs of
the enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity.
Summary
The passage provides insight into the statute of limitations for RICO
prosecutions, which is crucial for determining the viability of a complaint. It
specifies that the five-year statute of limitations begins from the date of the
last predicate act in which the defendant personally participated.
Additionally, it clarifies the distinction between a substantive RICO charge
and a RICO conspiracy charge, emphasizing the need for specific pleading of
a RICO conspiracy if that is the charge. This information is essential for
evaluating whether the allegations in Charles Dustin Myers' complaint
sufficiently establish the elements of a RICO claim and whether the
complaint is timely.

APPLYING THE MORRISON TEST TO CLAIMS ARISING UNDER THE RICO
ACT... Since the Morrison decision, federal courts have applied the Morrison
test to claims arising in non-transactional matters, and in particular, several
courts have applied the Morrison test in cases arising under the Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c)... the
challenge of applying Morrison in RICO cases stems from the difficulty in
ascertaining where a RICO enterprise is located... the district court in
Chevron Corp. took a different approach when considering a RICO claim
that involved a scheme formulated predominantly by Americans to extort
funds from Chevron Corp. (a U.S. Company) through 'a pattern of

racketeering activity that included acts in the United States by Americans as
well as acts in Ecuador by both Americans and Ecuadorians.'... the court
found that 'the focus properly is on the pattern of racketeering activity and
its consequences.'
Summary
The Morrison test is applied to RICO claims to determine their territoriality.
The focus is on the pattern of racketeering activity and its consequences,
rather than solely on the location of the enterprise. This is relevant to
evaluating whether a RICO claim sufficiently establishes the necessary
elements, such as the existence of an enterprise, a pattern of racketeering
activity, and injury to business or property. The passage also highlights the
complexity of determining jurisdiction and venue in RICO cases, especially
when activities occur both domestically and internationally.
RICO: A Primer
Extract
RICO provides for a civil action against persons engaged in a 'pattern of
racketeering activity' or 'collection of an unlawful debt.' A successful
plaintiff may recover treble damages, costs, and attorneys' fees... Among
other things, 'racketeering activities' include 'any act which is indictable
under' a list of federal criminal statutes. The list covers an expansive range
of violations, for example, violations of the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. ' 1951
(extortion); 18 U.S.C. ' 1341 (mail fraud) and 1343 (wire fraud); 18 U.S.C. '
1831 (economic espionage); 18 U.S.C. ' 1832 (theft of trade secrets); 18

18 U.S.C. ' 2318-2320 (copyright infringement). Mail and wire fraud are the
most common predicate acts... Under Section 1962(d), it is a violation to
conspire to commit any of the three substantive RICO offenses. To prove a
violation of Section 1962(d), a plaintiff must prove the following elements: *
The existence of an enterprise (or that an enterprise would exist); * That the
enterprise was (or would be) engaged in, or its activities affected (or would
affect), interstate or foreign commerce; and * That each defendant
knowingly agreed that a conspirator would commit a violation of 18 U.S.C. '

Extract
RICO is not a simple statute. It pertains to conduct associated with an
'enterprise' and 'a pattern racketeering activity.' An enterprise is an
individual or legal entity, or a union or group of individuals associated in fact
although not a legal entity, while a pattern of racketeering activity requires
long-term, organized conduct to violate state and federal laws. There are
four types of activities outlawed by RICO, and claims under Section 1962(c)
are the most commonly asserted: * Section 1962(a) prohibits a person from
investing in an enterprise any income derived from a pattern of racketeering
activity; * Section 1962(b) prohibits a person from using a pattern of
racketeering activity to acquire or maintain control over an enterprise; *
Section 1962(c) prohibits a person from conducting the affairs of an

whether a plaintiff can claim the required 'domestic injury.' Slip op. at 8.
This inquiry will require courts to look specifically at the 'circumstances

States.' Id. at 3.
Summary
The passage provides insight into how courts should assess whether a
domestic injury exists for a civil RICO claim, which is a critical element for
establishing the viability of such a claim. The Supreme Court's decision
emphasizes a context-specific inquiry based on the facts alleged in the
complaint, rather than a bright-line rule based on the plaintiff's residence.
This approach is relevant to evaluating whether Charles Dustin Myers'
complaint sufficiently establishes the elements of a RICO claim, particularly
the requirement of a domestic injury.
Defending RICO Claims In The Business Context Part II: RICO Claims Must
Allege Injury To Business Or Property
Extract
In Part II, we describe one of the best tools businesses have in the toolkit—
moving to dismiss a RICO claim because the plaintiff failed to allege that his
purported injuries are sufficient to convey what is 'RICO standing.'
Fortunately for defendants, the RICO standing requirement greatly restricts
the types of claims that can survive a motion to dismiss. If a plaintiff brings a
civil suit alleging a RICO violation, the plaintiff must plausibly allege that his
injury animating the RICO claim is associated with his business or property
by reason of the defendant's violation of the RICO laws. Absent these
allegations, the lawsuit must be dismissed. RICO standing is distinct from
the more well-known concept of constitutional standing. For RICO claims, in
addition to pleading a sufficiently specific injury, including allegations that
the plaintiff has suffered known damages (as opposed to mere speculative or
unprovable damages), the plaintiff must allege that he suffered an injury to
his business or property that bears some causal relationship to the alleged
act or acts that violated RICO.
Summary
The passage provides insight into the requirements for establishing a RICO
claim, specifically the necessity of alleging an injury to business or property
that is causally related to the alleged RICO violation. This is a critical
component of RICO standing, which is distinct from constitutional standing.
The passage emphasizes that without these allegations, a RICO claim is
likely to be dismissed. This information is generally applicable to any RICO
claim, including the one filed by Charles Dustin Myers, as it outlines the
fundamental requirements for a RICO claim to be viable.

participation through a pattern of racketeering activity with at least two
acts. This information is relevant to evaluating whether Charles Dustin
Myers' complaint under RICO sufficiently establishes the necessary
elements of a RICO claim.
Defending RICO Claims In The Business Context Part III
Extract
In Part I of this series Defending RICO Claims in the Business Context, we
described why a plan to defend against potential claims under the Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C. &#39; 1961-68,
should be in every business&#39;s toolkit. In Part II, we explained that one
of the best tools businesses have in that toolkit is moving to dismiss a RICO
claim early because the plaintiff failed to allege that his purported injuries
are sufficient to convey what is known as &#34;RICO standing.&#34; Both
of these parts specifically addressed the federal RICO laws. However,
because many states have their own versions of these laws, which are often
called &#34;Little RICO Acts,&#34; businesses should also be aware of the
potential risks of liability under analogous RICO laws in the states where
they operate.
Summary
The passage highlights the importance of establishing "RICO standing" as a
critical element in defending against RICO claims. It suggests that a
common defense strategy is to move to dismiss a RICO claim if the plaintiff
fails to allege sufficient injuries to establish standing. This is relevant to
evaluating the viability of Charles Dustin Myers' complaint, as it
underscores the necessity for Myers to demonstrate that his injuries meet
the threshold for RICO standing. Additionally, the passage notes the
existence of state-level RICO laws, which could be relevant if Myers'
complaint involves state claims.

Summary
Elements required to state a civil RICO claim, which include the existence of
an enterprise affecting interstate commerce, the defendant's association
with the enterprise, participation in the enterprise's affairs, and a pattern of
racketeering activity with at least two acts. This information is relevant to
evaluating whether Charles Dustin Myers' complaint under RICO sufficiently
establishes the necessary elements for a claim.
SCOTUS Clarified RICO's Domestic Injury Requirement, Did Not Create
New Civil Right Of Action For Enforcing Arbitration Awards
Extract
Post-Smagin, civil RICO remains a narrow and burdensome path for any
plaintiff and, while perceptions of the high court's tacit approval may
incentivize new test cases, filing longshot racketeering claims will do more
harm than good to an asset recovery campaign. Foreign creditors chasing
assets hidden behind fraudulent schemes still need to scrutinize carefully
whether theirs is the rare case supporting civil RICO liability. ... In the wake
of Smagin, civil RICO remains a longshot claim with heavy burdens and
discouraging odds. Smagin neither changes the complex substantive
standards applicable to civil RICO claims nor increases a plaintiff's chances
of prevailing on the merits of such claims. Instead, the Supreme Court
merely confirmed that foreign plaintiffs can meet the domestic injury
requirement, which is but one of the many requirements needed to
substantiate a civil RICO claim. Would-be plaintiffs still must overcome
highly-burdensome challenges inherent in civil RICO claims, including
exacting requirements to establish a RICO enterprise, a pattern of
racketeering activity and the elements of specifically-enumerated predicate
acts. When claims are fraud-based (most civil RICO theories are), the
heightened specificity requirements of Rule 9 of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure compound each of these burdens.
Summary
The Supreme Court's decision in Smagin clarified that foreign plaintiffs can
meet the domestic injury requirement for civil RICO claims. However, the
decision did not alter the substantive requirements of a civil RICO claim,
which remain complex and burdensome. Plaintiffs must still establish a
RICO enterprise, a pattern of racketeering activity, and specific predicate
acts, with heightened specificity for fraud-based claims. This indicates that
while the domestic injury requirement may be met, the overall viability of a
RICO claim remains challenging due to these stringent requirements.
