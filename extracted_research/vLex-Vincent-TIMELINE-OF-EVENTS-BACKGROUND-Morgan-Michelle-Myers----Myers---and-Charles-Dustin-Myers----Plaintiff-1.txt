Question
TIMELINE OF EVENTS BACKGROUND Morgan Michelle Myers, (“Myers”)
and Charles Dustin Myers, (“Plaintiff”) were married on June 20, 2015, and
have two daughters, C.R.M. and M.E.M, aged seven and nine. The evidence
in this case will show that in early December of 2023, the entire family was
blindsided by Myers’ sudden announcement that she wanted a divorce from
Plaintiff. REC. 717 The evidence will further show that Myers’ reasoning for
this divorce changes over time – beginning with how Plaintiff spoke to her,
and then switches to abuse and sexual harassment, and allegations of drug
abuse, claims that were only brought up in her initial pleadings. On
December 12, 2023, Plaintiff discovered a large volume of text messages
between Myers and two individuals identified as Debbie Price and Damen
Kazlauskas of Fort Worth, Texas spanning between October 2022 and
December 2023. REC. 254-714 In response to this discovery, Myers began to
communicate with Defendant Daniel Kenneth Branthoover, a resident of
Yukon, Oklahoma, who assisted her in the planning, drafting, traveling, and
submitting of fraudulent documents to the 322nd District Court of Tarrant
County designed to divest Plaintiff of his home and business operations.
When these allegations were raised to the State, they failed to adjudicate
them and violated the Plaintiff’s constitutional rights when he was deprived
of the guarantees of equal protection under the law and when he was not
afforded due process before being deprived of property. REC. 183. The
central question is whether Defendants Munford, Kaitcer, Carter, and Baker
are victims of the initial scheme – or willing participants in an expanded
associate-in-fact enterprise that began in December of 2023 as the Myers-
Branthoover enterprise. A. The Myers-Branthoover Enterprise 1. On
December 14, 2023, Defendants Morgan Michelle Myers and Daniel
Kenneth Branthoover, under deceptive pretenses (REC. 1704), began to
communicate via text message, and began to construct a scheme and
arranged a meeting of the minds that took place in in Yukon, Oklahoma, over
the weekend of December 15, 2023. REC. 274-278. The deceptive text
message from Defendant Branthoover claiming that he wanted to assist
Plaintiff was following an attempt by Myers to receive an ex-parte order of
protection from the 322nd District Court of Tarrant county, attempted on
December 14, 2023. REC. 78 B. Initial Predicate Acts: Wire Fraud and
Travel Act Violation 2. Both defendants planned and agreed to meet for the
purpose of drafting an original petition for divorce and affidavit of indigency
to be later submitted to the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County with the
intent of having Plaintiff removed from his matrimonial residence located at
6641 Anne Court, Watauga, Texas 76148, which also serves as his place of
business, serving clients across the United States, Canada, and the United
Kingdom. REC. 812 ¶ 16 3. During defendant Myers’ interstate travel, she
emptied the marital bank account into defendant Branthoover’s PayPal
account, amounting to $1,576. REC. 723. These proceeds were used to
purchase a second phone, registered under 817-940-0852. This phone
number was used on the fraudulent pleadings prepared during defendant
Myers’ stay in Oklahoma, which she transported from Yukon, Oklahoma
back to Texas on December 17, 2023. REC. 86; REC. 99; REC. 102; REC.
107. C. Admissions 4. On December 16, 2023, Plaintiff reached out to

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
defendant Branthoover and requested that the $1,576 be returned as they
were needed for Christmas gifts for the children, and for business
advertising expenses for his business. REC. 728-729. In response, defendant
Branthoover admitted that the purpose of defendant Myers’ visit was to help
her prepare paperwork for divorce litigation and confirmed that the transfer
of $1,576 did in fact occur. REC. 730. Plaintiff’s bank statement from
December 2023 further confirms this transaction. REC. 723. D. Post-
submission Collaboration 5. On December 18, 2023, defendant Myers
submitted the fraudulently prepared original petition for divorce, and an
affidavit of indigency to the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County. After
these documents were submitted, defendant Branthoover sent a text
message to Plaintiff on December 19, 2023, holding himself out to be
defendant Myers’ attorney, showing his involvement extends past the initial
help in preparing the fraudulent documents. REC. 1712-1713 6. Four days
later, on December 22, 2023, defendant Myers submitted another knowingly
fraudulent application for protective to the 322nd District Court of Tarrant
County claiming that family violence had occurred on December 18, 2023,
supported by both an affidavit and unsworn declaration. REC. 108-109. E.
Significant and Intentional Misrepresentations 7. On December 27 and
December 28, 2023, respectively, the documents prepared by Myers with
the assistance of Branthoover were served on Plaintiff via the U.S.
Constable, and contained the following misrepresentations: i. That
defendant Myers could not afford court costs; REC. 72, REC. 85-96 ii. That
defendant Myers had an active order of protection against the Plaintiff with
a finding of family violence that had occurred during the marriage; REC. 78
at 10 iii. That defendant Myers was financially responsible for the family
vehicles, rent payments, utilities, and other household expenses, making
herself appear as the primary breadwinner; REC. 92 iv. That defendant
Myers would be harassed or abused if Plaintiff were given her newly
acquired phone number that was obtained while in Oklahoma; REC. 81 at
15. v. That defendant Myers and Plaintiff ceased living together on
December 1, 2023; REC. 74 at 4 vi. That family violence occurred on
December 18, 2023, in the presence of the two Children. REC. 108-109. vii.
That both family vehicles were defendant Myers’ separate property acquired
before marriage. REC. 79 at 11B F. Evidence to the Contrary 8. On the same
day Defendant Myers claimed to be in an emergency requiring the Plaintiff’s
prompt removal from the home, she can be seen at the home with Plaintiff
and the children in no state of emergency and also still cohabitating in the
marital home. REC 1715. 9. Again, on December 29, 2023, Defendant Myers
can be seen with Plaintiff at the family home, smiling and laughing with the
children in no state of emergency and still collaborating with Plaintiff in the
marital home. REC. 1735. 10. The citation for the application for protective
order ordered Respondent to show cause as to why it should not issue with a
hearing scheduled for January 16, 2024. REC. 118. 11. In response to
extensive misrepresentation above, Plaintiff prepared an original answer,
filed a motion to consolidate, and provided background information which
alleged that defendant Myers was intentionally abusing the legal process.
REC. 130-132. Plaintiff was ordered to show cause on January 16, 2024,
regarding the protective order application. REC. 118 G. Inclement Weather
and First Appearance 12. On January 15, 2024, the Tarrant County District
Courts Facebook page sent out a notice informing the members of the public
that the court would be closed on January 16, 2024, due to inclement

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
weather. REC. 1202. 13. Unaware of the closure at the time, the parties
appeared at the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County on January 16, 2024,
and were met with a dark courtroom, with only one judge in the building at
the time of their arrival – Defendant James Munford (“Munford”). 14.
Defendant Munford summarily ordered the Plaintiff out of his home,
inadvertently assisting the Myers-Branthoover associate-in-fact enterprise of
achieving their primary goal in having the Plaintiff removed from his
residence, despite the broader goal being to obtain a decree of divorce to
permanently divest Plaintiff of his interests. REC. 183. 15. Defendant
Munford’s initial order was baseless, made in the absence of any emergency,
without a hearing, and disregarded the Plaintiff’s pleadings, telling Myers
“you’re going to have to find evidence of family violence!” clearly aware that
this order was made without any regard to the Plaintiff’s constitutional
rights. 16. Defendant Jeffrey Kaitcer, (“Kaitcer”) walked into the courtroom
late due to the inclement weather and turned the courtroom into a laughing
matter as he began to joke with Defendant Munford, and instructed the
parties to download the AppClose app for communication, and the matter
was reset for January 22, 2024. There exists no record of this proceeding,
only marked appearances on the docket. H. Reset #1 – January 22, 2024,
Setting 17. At the January 22 reset hearing, the parties appeared only to
have the case reset once more because defendant Myers allegedly retained
the services of Defendant Cooper Carter, (“Carter”) in the lobby of the
courthouse just moments before the hearing was scheduled to begin. No
appearance can be traced to this setting by either party on the docket (REC.
1551), and once again, no hearing was held, and the case reset for a second
time to February 1, 2024. REC. 186. 18. Kaitcer permitted attorney Dan
Bacalis, Plaintiff’s prior attorney, to fill out the Associate Judge’s Report, and
the parties never went before him as indicated by the case docket’s lack of
appearance on this date by either party. I. Reset #2 – February 1, 2024,
Setting 19. One day prior to the February 1 setting, both attorneys,
Defendant Carter and Dan Bacalis, both amended the petition for divorce
and counterpetition for divorce without the parties’ knowledge. (REC. 189,
REC. 209) These amended documents were similar, submitted on the same
day, and raised concerns for Plaintiff regarding his quality of representation.
20. At the February 1 setting, both parties were in the conference rooms
outside of Defendant Kaitcer’s courtroom, when attorney Bacalis walks in
holding a settlement agreement. When Plaintiff refused this option and
requested that they go have a hearing before the judge. 21. This is when
Bacalis stated, as witness affidavits corroborate, that he “knows this Judge
and this is the best we can get.” and further stated “[w]e’ll be here all day.
We can come back and change it later.” 22. Outraged by this response,
Plaintiff paid very close attention to the settlement offer Bacalis was
pressuring him to sign, and noticed the following provisions: A typed written
Order conforming to this Report will follow within 20 days from the date this
Report is signed. The Temporary Order shall be prepared by DAN BACALIS.
Each attorney should approve the Order. The parties do not need to approve
the Order. The attorney reviewing the proposed Order shall have five (5)
days to do so. There arc no ten (JO) day letters. If an agreement is not
reached, a Motion to Sign shall be filed and set within thirty (30) days from
the signing of this Report. IT IS SO ORDERED (REC. 233) J. Termination of
Counsel and the Emergency Motion 23. With the above provisions in mind,
Plaintiff signed the document and immediately fired his attorney and

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
provided notice to the court. REC. 221. By doing so, Plaintiff gained access
back to the residency, invalidated the agreement, and was able to use the
time back in the house to run damage control on his business operations
while preparing to expose the Myers-Branthoover enterprise to the court via
a MOTION TO RECONSIDER EVIDENCE AND VACATE TEMPORARY
ORDERS, which was filed on February 9, 2024, within three business days of
the February 1 agreed associate judge’s report being served by the clerk.
REC. 240 24. In this motion, it was specifically stated that: i. “I am seeking
immediate court intervention to correct procedural e rrors and address the
misuse of the legal system by the Petitioner.” REC. 244 ii. “Particularly, Dan
Branthoover became involved. He is the boyfriend of the Petitioner’s Mother.
Shortly thereafter, I received a notice from our joint bank account stating
that $1,576 had just been withdrawn. As our bank statement for December
2023 will demonstrate – the transaction record shows the funds being
transferred directly to Mr. Branthoover’s PayPal account” REC. 245 iii. “The
Petitioner's action of filing for divorce under an Affidavit of Inability to pay
three days after transferring $1,576 to herself starkly contravenes the
mandates set forth in Chapter 10, Section 10.001 of the Civil Practice and
Remedies Code”. REC 247 at B2 iv. “The Petitioner violated Chapter 10,
Section 10.001 a second time within the same document when she
intentionally elected to waive the 60-day waiting period claiming to have an
active protective order against me that found family violence had occurred
during our marriage.” REC 247 at B3. v. “This suit was the second attempt
by the Petitioner to have me removed from the home, which ultimately
succeeded.” REC 248 at D1 25. The motion went on to explain the factual
pattern described up to this point, putting the court on notice of the key
issues with provided exhibits which were duly served on Carter. In response
to Plaintiff’s motion, he received the first of just two email communications
from Carter throughout the case’s history, where she claimed she would be
filing a counter motion when disclosing her availability for the hearing on
Plaintiff’s emergency motion. REC. 2794 No such countermotion was filed
by Carter. K. Summary Judgment and Notice of Hearing 26. By February 22,
no response had been filed by Carter, so Plaintiff filed a Partial Motion for
Summary Judgment. REC. 758. Plaintiff also submitted a proposed parenting
plan as Exhibit D. REC. 769. No response was ever received from Carter. 27.
On February 27, 2024, Defendant Munford signed and issued a notice of
hearing to the parties with the hearing set for March 14, 2024. REC. 776. L.
Plaintiff’s Notice to the Court and Defendant Myers’ Self-Help Remedies 28.
On March 3, 2024, Plaintiff notified the Court that he would not be leaving
the home as it was not in the best interests of his children. REC. 782. 29.
The following day, on March 6, 2024, while walking his daughters to school,
Myers ran inside the family home, and locked him out of the marital
residence, leaving a sign on the door that said “[y]ou should have been out
by Saturday you are now locked out!” REC. 1748. 30. Plaintiff called local
law enforcement to help him regain entry into the home, where mother
produced the agreed associate judge’s report signed on February 1, 2024,
and used it as a means to block Plaintiff’s entrance to the home. 31. To avoid
further conflict, Plaintiff was escorted into the home where he was able to
grab only his computer and a few clothes and went to Flower Mound to
temporarily stay with his father until the time of the hearing on his
emergency motion, scheduled for March 14, 2024, at 9:00 A.M. L. The
Hearing On Plaintiff’s Emergency Motion 32. On March 14, 2024, the

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
parties arrived at the 322nd District Court, and on the way into the
courtroom, defendants Myers and Carter could be seen in the conference
room, quickly shuffling papers back and forth. 33. After checking in with the
bailiff, Plaintiff turned around to see defendant Carter extending to him a
document titled “Temporary Orders” that were the reduced version of the
February 1 associate judge’s report. REC. 888. 34. These orders, which were
not prepared by Dan Bacalis, which were not agreed to by the parties, were
reduced well outside of the 20-day requirement as ordered by the judge, and
which were never filed with the clerk, stated the following
misrepresentations: i. On February 1, 2024, the Court heard Petitioner's
motion for temporary orders. ii. The parties have agreed to the terms of this
order as evidenced by the signatures below. REC. 888. iii. The Court, after
examining the record and the agreement of the parties and hearing the
evidence and argument of counsel, finds that all necessary prerequisites of
the law have been legally satisfied and that the Court has jurisdiction of this
case and of all the parties. REC. 888. iv. The dates that the parties would
have access to the family residence was altered, changing the date Plaintiff
was supposed to leave from March 1, 2024, to March 20, 2024, and
changing Myers’ date of re-entry from March 1, 2024, to March 30, 2024,
leaving a 10-day window where no one would occupy the residence. v. This
modification was made to prevent Myers from being liable for illegally
locking Plaintiff out of the home on March 6, 2024. 35. On the last page of
the orders, Plaintiff’s attorney who was terminated weeks earlier did not
sign the document, and Plaintiff refused to sign the document for the
forthcoming reasons: i. It claimed a hearing occurred on a motion which was
never set for a hearing or served on the Plaintiff and doesn’t exist on the
docket. ii. It was prepared by defendant Carter, not Dan Bacalis. iii. The
associate judge was presiding over a de novo request of his own prior
report. iv. The matrimonial address was incorrect, as it stated “6641 Anns
Court”, rather than 6641 Anne Court. REC. 915, REC. 922 v. The orders
were not in the best interests of the children. vi. Notwithstanding the
Plaintiff’s revocation of consent by filing the emergency motion, the terms
were altered right before they were rendered into effect by defendant
Kaitcer. vii. Plaintiff did not agree to the terms as he was in court that very
day to expose Myers. M. Predicate Acts: Extortion 36. Kaitcer, knowing that
no response was filed, knowing that he was presiding over a hearing to
which he had no subject matter jurisdiction, and knowing that the temporary
orders produced by defendant Carter was served just moments earlier,
signed another associate judge’s report pre-drafted by defendant Carter,
which summarily denied the Plaintiff’s emergency motion, ignored the fact
that Carter had not provided a response, and within the report itself,
Plaintiff was ordered to sign the document that Carter had just presented to
him despite raising objections to its’ contents, and despite his consent not
being present. REC. 795. 37. Finally, defendant Kaitcer refused to consider
Plaintiff’s exhibits, including six affidavits prepared by his business clients
who have been directly affected by his inability to provide the real-time
market data services his clients relied on, who were located throughout the
United States. REC. 851; REC. 854; REC. 857; REC. 860; REC. 863; REC.
867; REC. 870. 38. Following the setting, the orders were rendered into
effect without Plaintiff’s signature (REC. 925) , and Plaintiff filed a request
for findings of fact and conclusions of law (REC. 883), and filed and
amended a “Preparatory Notice for Judicial Review” which recounted the

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
factual timeline up to that point, and included the affidavits that Kaitcer
refused to accept on March 14, 2024. REC. 798, REC. 851, REC. 854, REC.
857, REC. 860, REC. 863, REC. 867, REC. 870. 39. The orders stated they
were to remain in effect until the final decree of divorce, and Plaintiff’s
journey of one-sided appeals began. N. One Sided Appellate Efforts, and
Defective IWO 40. Following the rendition of the temporary orders on March
26, 2024, Plaintiff spent between April 8, 2024 and September 15, 2024,
appealing via mandamus to the Second Court of Appeals and the Texas
Supreme Court. REC. 1010. 41. During the appellate efforts, Carter filed one
of two motions in the case, which was a motion for pre-trial conference filed
on April 24, 2024, on her behalf by Roderick D. Marx, a party not named in
the suit. REC. 1014, REC. 1016. 42. Plaintiff immediately objected to the
pre-trial conference, and no response was ever issued by Carter or the
court. REC. 1018. 43. On April 30th, Plaintiff filed his notice of completion
regarding the parenting course as ordered, despite actively trying to vacate
them. REC. 1047. No parenting course was ever completed by Myers. 44. On
May 2, 2024, Plaintiff’s en banc reconsideration was denied in the Second
Court of Appeals, and he began preparing an appeal to the Supreme Court
of Texas. REC. 1067. 45. On May 19, 2024, Carter sent the second and last
email correspondence that would be received in the case, which falsely
claimed he agreed to the orders signed on March 14, 2024, and requested
that he fill out an IWO, which Plaintiff found to be defective. REC. 1722,
REC. 1728. No further correspondence was received by Carter. O.
Fraudulent Intervention and Branthoover’s Continued Involvement 46. On
June 23rd Plaintiff filed a motion in state court entitled MOTION FOR
JOINDER OF PERSONS NEEDED FOR JUST ADJUDICATION at 12:14 P.M.
REC. 1075. This motion received no response from Carter. 47. On June 23rd
at 1:54 P.M., directly following the submission of the motion, Branthoover
texted Plaintiff stating “Lol. And here comes another denial. Please sue me
individually. Please.”, referring to the earlier filed motion and showing his
continued oversight of the case’s progression since his initial predicate acts.
48. Four days later, on June 28, 2024, the Texas Office of the Attorney
General allegedly filed an intervention pleading, claiming that Plaintiff was
past due on child support, and requested information from Plaintiff. REC.
1099. 49. Most notably, the certificate of service to this intervention
pleading was allegedly signed by Holly Hayes, the designated attorney for
the OAG, yet the name underneath the signature line reads CHOYA
BURKLEY. REC. 1102. 50. Plaintiff promptly objected to the intervention,
and never received any response from the OAG, Carter, or the court. REC.
1106. P. Supreme Court, Rule 12, and Emergency Temporary Orders 51. As
Plaintiff continued to appeal to the Supreme Court of Texas, all prosecution
came to an end in the trial court. It wasn’t until September 15, 2024, that
Plaintiff filed a first amended rehearing motion in the Texas Supreme Court,
(REC. 1136) and after noticing Carter’s lack of participation, he began to
question her authority given several ambiguities surrounding her
representation, and filed a rule 12 motion to show authority. REC. 1170. No
response was ever received to this motion from Carter. 52. At this point,
Plaintiff had been staying in Airbnb homes while he sought relief to ensure
he could remain close to his daughters during this time. On September 26,
2024, he filed and later amended an EMERGENCY MOTION FOR
TEMPORARY ORDERS and requested expedited relief by October 1, 2024,
as that was when Plaintiff was forced to move away from the area due to

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
cost of living being unsustainable. REC. 1184. No response was ever
received from Carter regarding this motion. 53. By October 1, Plaintiff had
no choice but to start pursuing administrative remedies, and thought the
court was biased against him given the case’s history up to that point. He
began to prepare a Joint Motion to Recuse defendants Munford and Kaitcer
and filed it with the clerk of the court on October 7, 2024. REC. 1197. Q.
Predicate Act: Wire Fraud 54. On October 8, 2024, Defendant Munford
signed and forwarded a “Joint Motion to Recuse” attached to his order of
referral to regional presiding judge David L. Evans but was notably missing
the exhibits and affidavit critical to the motion. REC. 1222 55. A copy of this
exchange was sent via defendant Baker on 4:43 P.M. on October 8. REC.
1254 56. Plaintiff immediately pointed out the discrepancies between the
motion filed and the motion forwarded to David L. Evans, where she replied
and admitted that the full document had been e-filed and remains with the
court. REC. 1255 57. Unsatisfied with this response, Plaintiff further pointed
out that the filing size of the document filed and the one referring to David
L. Evans was significantly different. No further correspondence was
received by Baker until the following day. REC. 1256 58. The following day
on October 8, 2024, defendant Munford signed and filed an “Amended Order
of Referral” which had the full motion attached this time, albeit still
modified as the hyperlinks and bookmarks had been removed. REC. 1282 59.
This amended referral was sent via email correspondence by Baker at 11:17
A.M. on October 8, 2024, who stated that due to the size of the motion, it
was split into three parts. REC. 1258. This excuse directly contradicts the
standard filing procedure in Tarrant County, which was raised and
subsequently ignored in an objection. REC. 1269. No response was filed in
regard to the motion to recuse or objection by Carter. R. Recusal Denial and
More Delays, and Federal Removal 60. Justice E. Lee Gabriel was assigned
to hear the motion, which had to be rescheduled due to technical difficulties
for November 7, 2024. REC. 1306. 61. The morning of the hearing, Plaintiff
woke up with a dental emergency, and promptly notified all parties, and
requested a reset for the hearing, which everyone agreed to. REC.
1393-1396. 62. Despite this agreement, the recusal was denied for failure to
appear, and made no mention of the agreement or the emergency. REC.
1398. 63. With no other remedies left, Plaintiff removed the case to Federal
Court on December 2, 2024, which was quickly remanded back on
December 4, 2024. REC. 1426. 64. On December 14, 2024, defendant
Branthoover texted Plaintiff, sending a threat which stated “[w]hen things
all over, you get to deal with me.” at 2:15 P.M. REC. 1720 65. On December
16, 2024, Plaintiff initiated suit against Daniel Kenneth Branthoover in the
Western District of Oklahoma seeking relief in the form of damages from the
ongoing deprivation from his home. REC. 1451. 66. Plaintiff notified the
Texas court of this lawsuit on December 31, 2024. REC. 1446. S. Further
Delays, Motion to Dismiss for Want of Prosecution, and the Original SAPCR
67. On January 24, 2025, Plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss for want of
prosecution due to the total lack of participation in the case by the opposing
party. REC. 1527. No response was ever received from Carter on this
motion. 68. On January 29, 2025, defendant Myers began disposing of
Plaintiff’s personal belongings that remained on the family property. REC.
1629-1631. 69. On February 12, 2025, Plaintiff learned that his youngest
daughter was suffering from dental pain due to Myers’ failure to obtain
dental insurance for the children. REC. 3281. 70. By March 14, (REC.

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
1833-1837) the judges had still not been reinstated from the first recusal,
which lad Plaintiff to reach out to Baker to request a hearing on his
unopposed summary judgment that had been on the docket since February
22, 2024, where he had to remind her to reinstate the judges back into the
case. REC. 1833-1837. 71. Given the delays, and since the case had been
brought in bad faith initially, the Plaintiff opened an original SAPCR suit in
the 233rd District Court of Tarrant County on March 18, 2025, where he
argued for dominant jurisdiction in a cover letter sent to the clerk. REC.
2260. T. Counsel Suddenly Becomes Active 72. The very next day, defendant
Carter filed an original answer filed on her behalf by Roderick Marx. REC.
2279. The motion was a boilerplate motion, and was followed by a motion to
consolidate, which was filed in the wrong court, and was also filed on
Carter’s behalf by RODERICK D. MARX. REC. 2284. 73. The Plaintiff
immediately responded by filing a motion to strike (REC. 1957) a Rule 12
motion to show authority challenging both Carter and RODERICK D MARX’s
authority (REC. 2288) and on March 24, 2025, an emergency ex-parte TRO
to prevent Myers from barring Plaintiff’s access to the home. (REC. 2302)
No responses were ever received from Carter on these motions. 74. On
March 26, 2025, an objection was filed to Carter’s consolidation motion in
the 233rd court. REC. 1881. 75. Plaintiff reached out to the coordinator from
the 233rd and went through the process to present the motion to the judge.
REC. 2338-2341. 76. On March 29, 2025, Plaintiff appeared before Associate
Judge Kate Stone, who refused to hear Plaintiff’s emergency motion despite
no response being filed, and told him to leave the courtroom. The hearing
date scheduled for April 10, 2025, as agreed by Carter and Plaintiff (REC.
2358), was actually un-set by Stone. REC. 2361. 77. The grounds for this
outright refusal was due to Carter calling in a favor from the judge without
even being present in the courtroom, to where Stone left the room, came
back, and told the Plaintiff to leave informing him that a motion to
consolidate would be filed by Carter the following week. U. Five Concurrent
Mandamus Petitions 78. Subsequently, after he was turned away from the
courtroom, Carter’s consolidation motion wasn’t filed until April 4, 2025
(REC. 2367), resulting in two mandamus petitions to try again to have the
March 14, 2024, order signed by Kaitcer vacated, and to compel Kate Stone
to hear the emergency TRO. See 25-0361, 25-0367. 79. On the same day the
mandamus was filed against Stone, District Judge Kenneth Newell sua
sponte granted Carter’s consolidation motion in both courts without a
hearing, and without addressing the emergency situation for the children or
the Plaintiff’s objections, leading to a third mandamus proceeding. REC.
2393, See also 25-0378. 80. On April 23, 2025, a notice of trial setting was
served on the parties by defendant Munford in the midst of all of these
issues. REC. 1773. 81. The same day, Plaintiff filed an objection and
requested an emergency stay. REC. 2219. No response was received to this
objection by either Munford or Carter. 82. Two days later on April 25, 2025,
Plaintiff filed his second recusal motion, and amended it on April 28, 2025,
this time only against Munford, and requested that the rules of procedure be
followed, and objected to the involvement of the court coordinator given the
prior recusal’s ambiguity and significant delays caused by her involvement.
REC. 2488 No response to this motion was ever filed from Carter. 83. Baker
continued to be involved in the recusal process, this time erroneously
forwarding an order of referral from defendant Kaitcer, who was not named
in the recusal motion. REC. 2615. 84. Plaintiff immediately objected on April

29, 2025, naming two issues: 1) the coordinator was still involved, and 2) the
order of referral sent by Kaitcer was erroneous. REC. 2620. 84. Plaintiff
objected to the order of assignment of John H. Cayce (REC. 3149) which was
issued on May 7, 2025, due to the unresolves issues. REC. 2620. 85. David L.
Evans overruled this objection on May 15, 2025, leading to mandamus
petition 25-0426, a direct appeal to the Texas Supreme Court. REC. 3507.
86. On May 20, 2025, John H. Cayce summarily denied the recusal, including
the denial of a motion to recuse Kaitcer which was never filed, leading to
mandamus petition 25-0458, a second direct appeal to the Texas Supreme
Court. 87. All five petitions were denied both initially and on rehearing, and
all emergency motions to stay proceedings were dismissed. The only insights
given from the appellate courts was: “Denied, per curiam.” No response was
filed by any implicated judge or opposing counsel. V. Federal RICO Case and
the Push Towards Final Trial 88. In June of 2025, Plaintiff amended his
complaint against Daniel Kenneth Branthoover and enjoined Myers as a
defendant, which they defended pro-se. 89. Plaintiff communicated this
action with the trial court, and no further action was taken in the case until
August of 2025, when defendant Munford sua sponte set the case for final
trial on December 10, 2025. 90. Plaintiff immediately objected to this trial
setting, and moved to recuse Munford for a third time. 91. The court
coordinator continued to be involved in the process, leading to a subsequent
motion to recuse the regional presiding judge, David L. Evans. 92. Plaintiff
now prepares this suit to hold defendants accountable for their collective
actions, and to prevent their common goal from being achieved, which is to
obtain defendant Myers a final decree of divorce. 93. For the forthcoming
reasons, the conduct outlined herein constitutes conduct of an enterprise
through a pattern of racketeering activity, as several predicate acts were
committed, the enterprise shares a common purpose, and Plaintiff has
suffered direct and ongoing injury to business and property as a direct result
of the defendant’s collective predicate acts. EXPLAIN HOW THIS SATISFIES

REFERENCE EXACT PARAGRAPH NUMBERS FROM THE ENUMERATED
TIMELINE
Answer (Tenth Circuit)
Short response
The timeline and evidence described satisfy the required elements of a RICO
claim in the Tenth Circuit by demonstrating the existence of an association-
in-fact enterprise (the Myers-Branthoover group), a common goal to divest
the Plaintiff of property and business interests, a pattern of racketeering
activity through predicate acts such as wire fraud and Travel Act violations,
and direct injury to the Plaintiff’s business and property. The conduct,
relationships, and continuity among the participants, as well as the use of
interstate communications and travel to further the scheme, align with the
standards articulated by the Tenth Circuit and federal RICO law.
Summary
The Myers-Branthoover enterprise, as detailed in the timeline, constitutes
an association-in-fact enterprise under RICO because it involved a
structured, ongoing collaboration between Myers, Branthoover, and
potentially others, with the shared purpose of depriving the Plaintiff of his
home and business through fraudulent means. The actions taken—such as
the interstate transfer of funds, preparation and submission of fraudulent
court documents, and coordinated communications—demonstrate a pattern
of racketeering activity, including wire fraud and Travel Act violations,
which are recognized predicate acts under RICO.
The evidence shows that the enterprise operated over a substantial period,
involved multiple related acts, and had a decision-making framework and
continuity sufficient to meet the Tenth Circuit’s requirements for a RICO
enterprise. The Plaintiff’s direct and ongoing injury to his business and
property, as a result of these acts, further supports the RICO claim. The
involvement of other defendants may be characterized as either inadvertent
or willing participation in the broader enterprise, depending on their
knowledge and intent, but the core elements of a RICO violation are
satisfied by the conduct of Myers and Branthoover as outlined in the
enumerated timeline.
Background and Relevant Law
RICO Statutory Framework
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), codified at
18 U.S.C. §§ 1961–1968, provides a civil cause of action for individuals
injured in their business or property by reason of a pattern of racketeering
activity conducted through an enterprise affecting interstate or foreign
commerce. Section 1962(c) is the most commonly invoked provision and

=== PAGE 11 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
prohibits any person employed by or associated with an enterprise from
conducting or participating in the conduct of such enterprise’s affairs
through a pattern of racketeering activity. Section 1962(d) further prohibits
conspiracies to violate any of the substantive RICO provisions.
To establish a civil RICO claim under Section 1962(c), a plaintiff must prove:
The existence of an enterprise;
The enterprise’s engagement in, or effect on, interstate or foreign
commerce;
The defendant’s employment by or association with the enterprise;
The defendant’s participation, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of
the enterprise’s affairs; and
The defendant’s participation through a pattern of racketeering activity
or collection of unlawful debt.
See RICO: A Primer (2022-01-31).
Predicate Acts
RICO defines “racketeering activity” to include a wide range of criminal
offenses, including wire fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343) and violations of the Travel
Act (18 U.S.C. § 1952). A “pattern of racketeering activity” requires at least
two predicate acts within a ten-year period, but the acts must be related and
amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity.
See 100 Mount Holly Bypass v. Axos Bank, Case No. 2:20-CV-856-TS-CMR
(D. Utah Jul 27, 2021).
Enterprise and Association-in-Fact
An “enterprise” under RICO includes any individual, partnership,
corporation, association, or group of individuals associated in fact, even if
not a legal entity. For an association-in-fact enterprise, the Tenth Circuit
requires:
A purpose;
Relationships among those associated with the enterprise;
Longevity sufficient to permit the associates to pursue the enterprise’s
purpose;
A decision-making framework or mechanism for controlling the group;
Functioning as a continuing unit; and
Existence separate and apart from the pattern of racketeering activity.
See U.S. v. Hutchinson, 573 F.3d 1011 (10th Cir. 2009).

Analysis
1. Existence of an Enterprise
a. Association-in-Fact Structure
The Myers-Branthoover group constitutes an association-in-fact enterprise.
The timeline shows that Myers and Branthoover began communicating with
a shared purpose (REC. 1704, 274-278), namely, to divest the Plaintiff of his
home and business through fraudulent legal filings and manipulation of
court processes. Their collaboration involved planning, decision-making, and
coordinated action, including meetings in Yukon, Oklahoma, and ongoing
electronic communications (REC. 274-278, 1704).
The enterprise had a clear structure: Myers and Branthoover each played
defined roles—Myers as the petitioner in the divorce and Branthoover as the
planner, drafter, and facilitator of fraudulent documents and financial
transactions (REC. 812 ¶ 16, 723, 86, 99, 102, 107). The group functioned as
a continuing unit over several months, from at least December 2023 through
the subsequent legal proceedings, and their activities were not limited to a
single act but involved a series of coordinated steps (see, e.g., REC.
274-278, 812 ¶ 16, 723, 86, 99, 102, 107, 1712-1713, 108-109, 72, 85-96, 78
at 10, 92, 81 at 15, 74 at 4, 108-109, 79 at 11B).
This satisfies the Tenth Circuit’s requirements for an association-in-fact
enterprise, which does not require a formal legal entity but does require a
common purpose, relationships, and sufficient longevity to pursue the
enterprise’s goals (U.S. v. Hutchinson, 573 F.3d 1011 (10th Cir. 2009)).
b. Decision-Making Framework and Continuity
The timeline demonstrates a decision-making framework: Myers and
Branthoover planned the scheme, agreed on the steps to be taken, and
executed those steps in a coordinated manner (REC. 274-278, 812 ¶ 16, 723,
86, 99, 102, 107). Their actions were not isolated but part of a continuing
course of conduct, with each act building upon the previous ones to further
the enterprise’s objectives.
The group’s existence was separate from the pattern of racketeering
activity, as the enterprise was formed for the purpose of achieving a specific
goal (divesting Plaintiff of property and business interests) and engaged in
multiple acts over time to accomplish that goal (U.S. v. Hutchinson, 573 F.3d
1011 (10th Cir. 2009)).

=== PAGE 13 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
2. Common Goal
The common goal of the enterprise was to deprive the Plaintiff of his home,
business, and property interests through fraudulent means. This is
evidenced by:
The planning and execution of fraudulent legal filings designed to
remove Plaintiff from his residence and business (REC. 812 ¶ 16, 86,
99, 102, 107, 888, 915, 922);
The transfer and use of marital funds to further the scheme (REC. 723,
728-730);
The submission of false affidavits and misrepresentations to the court
(REC. 72, 85-96, 78 at 10, 92, 81 at 15, 74 at 4, 108-109, 79 at 11B);
The ongoing manipulation of court proceedings to maintain control over
the Plaintiff’s property and business (REC. 795, 925, 883, 798, 851,
854, 857, 860, 863, 867, 870).
The evidence shows that the participants were united in their objective and
worked together to achieve it, satisfying the requirement of a shared
purpose (U.S. v. Hutchinson, 573 F.3d 1011 (10th Cir. 2009)).
3. Pattern of Racketeering Activity
a. Predicate Acts
The timeline identifies multiple predicate acts that qualify as racketeering
activity under RICO:
Wire Fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343): Myers transferred $1,576 in marital
funds to Branthoover’s PayPal account during interstate travel, and
these funds were used to purchase a phone for use in the fraudulent
scheme (REC. 723, 86, 99, 102, 107). The use of electronic
communications (text messages, emails) to plan and execute the
scheme further supports the wire fraud allegation (REC. 1704, 274-278,
1712-1713).
Travel Act Violations (18 U.S.C. § 1952): Myers traveled from Texas
to Oklahoma to meet with Branthoover, where they planned and
prepared fraudulent legal documents, which were then transported
back to Texas and submitted to the court (REC. 274-278, 812 ¶ 16, 86,
99, 102, 107).
Submission of Fraudulent Documents: The preparation and
submission of false affidavits and pleadings to the court, containing
material misrepresentations about financial status, family violence, and
property ownership, constitute further predicate acts (REC. 72, 85-96,
78 at 10, 92, 81 at 15, 74 at 4, 108-109, 79 at 11B).
These acts are related, as they all furthered the common goal of the
enterprise, and they occurred over a substantial period (from at least
December 2023 through 2025), satisfying the continuity requirement for a
pattern of racketeering activity (100 Mount Holly Bypass v. Axos Bank, Case
No. 2:20-CV-856-TS-CMR (D. Utah Jul 27, 2021)).

=== PAGE 14 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
b. Continuity and Relatedness
The predicate acts were not isolated incidents but part of an ongoing
scheme. The acts were related in that they all aimed to deprive the Plaintiff
of his property and business, and they posed a threat of continued criminal
activity, as the enterprise continued to operate and adapt its tactics over
time (see, e.g., REC. 274-278, 812 ¶ 16, 723, 86, 99, 102, 107, 888, 915,
922, 795, 925, 883, 798, 851, 854, 857, 860, 863, 867, 870).
The timeline shows that the enterprise’s activities extended over a
substantial period, with multiple acts occurring over months and involving
ongoing coordination and adaptation to changing circumstances (100 Mount
Holly Bypass v. Axos Bank, Case No. 2:20-CV-856-TS-CMR (D. Utah Jul 27,
2021)).
4. Injury to Business or Property
The Plaintiff suffered direct and ongoing injury to his business and property
as a result of the enterprise’s actions. He was deprived of his home and
business operations, lost access to marital funds, and was unable to provide
services to clients, resulting in financial harm (REC. 812 ¶ 16, 723, 851, 854,
857, 860, 863, 867, 870). These injuries are precisely the type of harm RICO
is designed to redress (100 Mount Holly Bypass v. Axos Bank, Case No. 2:20-
CV-856-TS-CMR (D. Utah Jul 27, 2021)).
5. Participation of Other Defendants
The timeline raises the question of whether Munford, Kaitcer, Carter, and
Baker were victims of the initial scheme or willing participants in the
expanded enterprise. The evidence suggests that, at a minimum, Myers and
Branthoover were the core members of the enterprise, with others
potentially becoming involved through their actions in the legal proceedings.
Inadvertent Participation: Some defendants may have participated
inadvertently, such as by issuing orders or facilitating court processes
without knowledge of the underlying scheme (REC. 183, 795, 925, 883,
798, 851, 854, 857, 860, 863, 867, 870).
Willing Participation: Others may have become willing participants if
they knowingly furthered the enterprise’s objectives or ignored clear
evidence of fraud and misrepresentation (REC. 795, 925, 883, 798, 851,
854, 857, 860, 863, 867, 870).
RICO liability can extend to those who knowingly participate in the conduct
of the enterprise’s affairs, even if they were not original members of the
scheme (RICO: A Primer (2022-01-31)).
6. Conspiracy to Commit RICO Violations
Section 1962(d) makes it unlawful to conspire to violate any of the
substantive RICO provisions. The coordinated actions and communications
among Myers, Branthoover, and potentially others support a claim of
• 
• 

=== PAGE 15 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
conspiracy to commit RICO violations, as they agreed to and took steps to
further the enterprise’s objectives (REC. 274-278, 812 ¶ 16, 723, 86, 99,
102, 107, 1704, 1712-1713).
Exceptions and Caveats
While the evidence supports the core elements of a RICO claim, the liability
of certain defendants (such as Munford, Kaitcer, Carter, and Baker) may
depend on their knowledge and intent. RICO does not impose liability for
inadvertent or unwitting participation; there must be knowing and willful
involvement in the conduct of the enterprise’s affairs. The timeline provides
some evidence of possible willing participation, but further factual
development may be necessary to establish the requisite intent for each
defendant.
Additionally, the continuity and relatedness of the predicate acts must be
sufficiently established to meet the pattern requirement. The timeline
provides strong evidence of continuity and relatedness, but the ultimate
determination will depend on the court’s assessment of the facts.
Conclusion
The timeline and evidence provided satisfy the required elements of a RICO
claim in the Tenth Circuit. The Myers-Branthoover group constitutes an
association-in-fact enterprise with a common goal to deprive the Plaintiff of
his home and business through a pattern of racketeering activity, including
wire fraud and Travel Act violations. The enterprise operated over a
substantial period, involved multiple related acts, and caused direct injury to
the Plaintiff’s business and property. The involvement of other defendants
may be characterized as inadvertent or willing participation, depending on
their knowledge and intent, but the core elements of a RICO violation are
satisfied by the conduct of Myers and Branthoover as outlined in the
enumerated timeline. The Plaintiff’s claim is well-supported under the
standards articulated by the Tenth Circuit and federal RICO law.
Legal Authorities
U.S. v. Hutchinson, 573 F.3d 1011 (10th Cir. 2009)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
RICO makes it a crime for individuals to engage in a pattern of racketeering
as part of 'an enterprise,' and proof of such an enterprise naturally is
essential to securing a conviction under the statute. Id. at 2243. After
Congress enacted RICO, however, the circuits promptly split about the
meaning and reach of the enterprise element. Must an enterprise be a
formal legal entity? Or may the term also encompass looser, less formal
groups? The Supreme Court provided guidance on this question in United

=== PAGE 16 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 101 S.Ct. 2524, 69 L.Ed.2d 246 (1981). ... It
is this sort of informal, association-in-fact enterprise that Mr. Hutchinson
was charged with leading at the Alpine Rose, and about which the district
court had to instruct the jury. Yet, while Turkette clarified much about the
contours of RICO's enterprise element, it did not resolve everything.
Mirroring what happened in the wake of RICO's passage, shortly after
Turkette the circuits again promptly split. This time they debated, among
other things, how much 'structure' an association-in-fact enterprise must
display to distinguish it from a RICO 'pattern of racketeering,' in order to
distinguish these distinct statutory elements. ... For our part, in United
States v. Smith, 413 F.3d 1253 (10th Cir.2005), we sided with the Third
Circuit and those courts requiring more rather than less 'structure.' We held
that, to distinguish the RICO enterprise element from the statute's pattern
of racketeering activity, the government must prove: (1) the existence of a
decision-making framework or mechanism for controlling the group, (2) that
various associates functioned as a continuing unit, and (3) that the
enterprise had an existence separate and apart from the pattern of
racketeering activity. Id. at 1266-67. On appeal before us, Mr. Hutchinson
complains that the district court's jury instructions did not adequately take
account of Smith. At trial, the jury was instructed that an association-in-fact
enterprise ... Second, the Court held that, while the enterprise and pattern
of racketeering activity are 'of course' separate elements under RICO, such
that 'proof of one does not necessarily establish the other,' id. (quoting
Turkette, 452 U.S. at 583, 101 S.Ct. 2524), at the same time 'evidence used
to prove the pattern of racketeering activity and the evidence establishing
an enterprise 'may in particular cases coalesce.'' Id. (quoting Turkette, 452
U.S. at 583, 101 S.Ct. 2524). Accordingly, 'a group that does nothing but
engage in extortion through old-fashioned, unsophisticated, and brutal
means may fall squarely within the statute's reach.' Id. at 2246. ... As to the
relevant 'relationship,' the Court explained that not only must members of
the group only share a common purpose, there also must be evidence of
'interpersonal relationships' aimed at effecting that purpose—evidence that
the members of the group have 'joined together' to advance 'a certain object'
or 'engag[e] in a course of conduct.' Id. at 2244. As to longevity, the Court
held that the group must associate on the basis of its shared purpose for a
'sufficient duration to permit an association to 'participate' in [the affairs of
the enterprise] through 'a pattern of racketeering activity,'' id. (quoting 18
U.S.C. § 1962), though 'nothing in RICO exempts an enterprise whose
associates engage in spurts of activity punctuated by periods of quiescence,'
id. at 2245. The Court acknowledged that its structural requirements for an
enterprise are modest, certainly far more modest than Riccobene's or
Smith's, but stressed that this result is compelled by the plain language of
Congress's statute: 'This enumeration of included enterprises is obviously
broad, encompassing [in RICO's plain language terms] 'any ... group of
individuals associated in fact.'' Id. at 2243 (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4))
(final alteration in original) (emphasis in original). 'The term 'any' ensures
that the definition has a wide reach, ... and the very concept of an
association in fact is expansive. In addition, the RICO statute provides that
its terms are to be 'liberally construed to effectuate its remedial purposes.''
Id. (quoting Pub.L. No. 91-452 § 904(a), 84 Stat. 947).

Summary
The passage explains the requirements for establishing a RICO enterprise,
particularly an association-in-fact enterprise, which does not need to be a
formal legal entity. The Tenth Circuit requires proof of a decision-making
framework, functioning as a continuing unit, and existence separate from
the pattern of racketeering. The passage also highlights that evidence for
the enterprise and racketeering pattern may overlap, and that the
enterprise must have a common purpose and interpersonal relationships.
This supports the proposition by showing that the alleged actions of Myers
and Branthoover could constitute an association-in-fact enterprise under
RICO, given their coordinated actions and shared goal of defrauding the
Plaintiff.
100 Mount Holly Bypass v. Axos Bank, Case No. 2:20-CV-856-TS-CMR (D.
Utah Jul 27, 2021)
U.S. District Court — District of Utah
Extract
RICO provides a private right of action in federal court for individuals
injured in their business or property through fraudulent conduct. It
encompasses many traditional common-law fraud claims if the requisite
pattern and entity requirements are met. ... In short, a RICO plaintiff must
prove '(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of
racketeering activity' or conspiracy to do the same. ... Section 1961(4) of
RICO defines an enterprise as 'any individual, partnership, corporation,
association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals
associated in fact although not a legal entity.' ... Where the alleged
enterprise is an 'association-in-fact'—that is, comprised of actors not
formally or legally affiliated with one another—the enterprise must have (1)
'a purpose,' (2) 'relationships among those associated with the enterprise,'
and (3) 'longevity sufficient to permit these associates to pursue the
enterprise's purpose.' ... Section 1961 of RICO defines 'racketeering activity'
to include any of a long list of 'predicate acts.' Among others, these include
some state-law felonies and acts indictable under 18 U.S.C. §§ 1341 (mail
fraud), 1343 (wire fraud), 1344 (bank fraud), 1512 (tampering with a
witness, victim, or an informant), and 1952 (racketeering). ... The RICO
statute defines a 'pattern of racketeering activity' as at least two acts of
racketeering activity within a ten-year period. The Supreme Court has
clarified that two predicate acts are necessary but not sufficient to show a
pattern. A pattern also requires 'that the racketeering predicates are
related, and that they amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal
activity.' Continuity requires that the predicate acts extend over a
'substantial period of time' and that 'the predicates themselves involve a
distinct threat of long-term racketeering activity. .. [or] are a regular way of
conducting the defendant's ongoing legitimate business or the RICO
enterprise.'

Summary
Elements required to establish a RICO claim, including the need for conduct
of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. It defines an
enterprise and explains the concept of an association-in-fact, which is
relevant to the Myers-Branthoover enterprise. The passage also lists
predicate acts, such as wire fraud and racketeering, which are applicable to
the alleged actions of Myers and Branthoover. The requirement for a pattern
of racketeering activity, including continuity and relatedness of acts, is also
addressed, which is relevant to the timeline of events described.
RICO: A Primer
Extract
There are four separate and distinct RICO violations set out in section 1962:
(a) acquiring or operating an enterprise using racketeering proceeds; (b)
controlling an enterprise using racketeering activities; (c) conducting the
affairs of an enterprise using racketeering activities; and (d) conspiring to so
acquire, control, or conduct. Each of the subsections incorporates the basic
elements of 'enterprise' and a 'pattern of racketeering activity.' Section
1962(c) is, far and away, the most often used and important substantive
RICO provision. Under section 1962(c), it is a violation to conduct the affairs
of an enterprise affecting interstate or foreign commerce 'through' a pattern
of racketeering activity or through the alternative theory of collection of an
unlawful debt. To prove a violation of Section 1962(c), a plaintiff must prove
the following elements: * Existence of an enterprise; * The enterprise
engaged in, or its activities affected, interstate or foreign commerce; * The
defendant was employed by or was associated with the enterprise; * The
defendant conducted or participated, either directly or indirectly, in the
conduct of the affairs of the enterprise; and * The defendant participated in
the affairs of the enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity or
collection of unlawful debt.
Summary
Elements required to establish a RICO violation under Section 1962(c),
which includes the existence of an enterprise, the enterprise's engagement
