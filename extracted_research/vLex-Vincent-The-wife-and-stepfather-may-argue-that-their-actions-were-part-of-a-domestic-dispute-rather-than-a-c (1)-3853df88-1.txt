Question
The wife and stepfather may argue that their actions were part of a
domestic dispute rather than a criminal enterprise. The husband may face
challenges in proving the intent behind the wife's and stepfather's actions,
as well as the connection between the predicate acts and the alleged injury.
RICO claims require proof of a criminal enterprise and a pattern of
racketeering activity, which can be difficult to establish in cases involving
personal or domestic disputes. The husband must provide clear evidence of
the fraudulent scheme, the predicate acts, and the resulting injury to
overcome these challenges and establish a viable RICO claim.
Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
RICO claims in domestic dispute contexts face significant challenges due to
the need to demonstrate a criminal enterprise distinct from personal
disagreements and establish a pattern of racketeering activity. Successfully
pursuing such claims requires clear evidence of fraudulent conduct causing
specific injury to business or property, elements that are difficult to establish
when defendants can characterize their actions as part of ordinary domestic
conflicts.
Summary
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) was
designed to combat organized criminal activity, requiring plaintiffs to prove
conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity that
causes injury to business or property. In the context of domestic disputes,
establishing these elements presents substantial hurdles, as actions taken
within familial relationships are not typically characterized as criminal
enterprises. When a wife and stepfather argue that their actions were
merely part of a domestic dispute rather than organized criminal activity,
this defense directly challenges the fundamental enterprise and pattern
elements required under RICO.
To overcome these challenges, a husband bringing such claims needs
compelling evidence that demonstrates the wife and stepfather formed an
actual enterprise with a common purpose and organizational structure,
engaged in specific predicate acts that constitute racketeering activity, and
that these acts caused concrete financial injury to his business or property.
Courts have consistently applied demanding standards for RICO claims,
emphasizing that the statute was designed for widespread fraud and
organized criminal activity, not ordinary disputes or personal conflicts.
Without clear evidence distinguishing the alleged conduct from typical
domestic disagreements, such claims are unlikely to survive judicial scrutiny.

Background and Relevant Law
Elements of a Civil RICO Claim
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) provides a
civil cause of action for individuals who have been injured by certain
patterns of criminal activity. To establish a viable RICO claim under 18
U.S.C. § 1962(c), plaintiffs must demonstrate several essential elements.
The fundamental elements of a RICO claim are consistently described across
federal jurisprudence. As articulated in La Ronde-Bey v. Chica, a plaintiff
must show: "(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of
racketeering activity." Similar formulations appear in Tashjian v. Deutsche
Bank, CIVIL ACTION NO. 19-cv-40074-DHH (D. Mass. Feb 23, 2021) and 
Studco Bldg. Sys. U.S., LLC v. 1st Advantage Fed. Credit Union, 509 F.Supp.
3d 560 (E.D. Va. 2020).
These elements are deliberately demanding. The court in Studco Bldg. Sys.
emphasized that RICO's elements are "'demanding' because 'Congress
contemplated that only a party engaging in widespread fraud would be
subject to RICO's serious consequences.'" This underscores that RICO was
not designed for ordinary disputes but rather for serious, organized criminal
activity.
Enterprise Requirement
A critical component of any RICO claim is establishing the existence of an
"enterprise." According to La Ronde-Bey v. Chica, an "enterprise" includes
"any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity,
and any union or group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal
entity."
In Eclectic Props. E., LLC v. Marcus & Millichap Co., 751 F.3d 990 (9th Cir.
2014), the Ninth Circuit elaborated that to show the existence of an
enterprise, "plaintiffs must plead that the enterprise has (A) a common
purpose, (B) a structure or organization, and (C) longevity necessary to
accomplish the purpose."
Importantly, Sundquist v. Hultquist, Cause No. 1:20-CV-275-HAB (N.D. Ind.
Sep 09, 2020) notes that "any RICO enterprise must consist of more than a
group of people who get together to commit a pattern of racketeering
activity." The enterprise must be "distinct, separate, and apart from a
pattern of racketeering activity." This requirement poses a particular
challenge in domestic dispute contexts, where the relationship between
parties may not constitute a distinct enterprise with organizational
structure.

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Pattern of Racketeering Activity
Beyond establishing an enterprise, a plaintiff must also demonstrate a
"pattern of racketeering activity." As defined in various cases, this requires
at least two predicate acts of racketeering within a ten-year period.
Marshall v. Goguen, 604 F.Supp.3d 980 (D. Mont. 2022) explains that a
"'pattern' of racketeering activity requires evidence of at least two predicate
acts within ten years of one another," which the Supreme Court has
interpreted to require "similarity between both the acts (relationship) and
continuing activity (continuity)."
Moreover, Studco Bldg. Sys. clarifies that "simply proving two or more
predicate acts is insufficient for a RICO plaintiff to succeed." The plaintiff
"must show that the racketeering predicates are related, and that they
amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity." This reinforces
the high standard required for establishing a pattern under RICO.
Standing and Injury Requirement
For a plaintiff to have standing to bring a RICO claim, they must
demonstrate a specific kind of injury. La Ronde-Bey v. Chica states that a
plaintiff "only has standing to bring a RICO claim if, and can only recover to
the extent that, he has been injured in his business or property by the
conduct constituting the violation." Crucially, the court notes that "personal
injury or emotional harm are not proper bases for a RICO claim."
The secondary source Defending RICO Claims In The Business Context Part
II: RICO Claims Must Allege Injury To Business Or Property emphasizes that
"the plaintiff must allege that he suffered an injury to his business or
property that bears some causal relationship to the alleged act or acts that
violated RICO." This causal relationship between the predicate acts and the
specific business or property injury is essential for establishing standing.
Pleading Standard
RICO claims, particularly those involving fraud, are subject to heightened
pleading standards. Sundquist v. Hultquist notes that "allegations of fraud in
a civil RICO complaint are subject to Rule 9(b)'s heightened pleading
standard, which requires a plaintiff to plead all averments of fraud with
particularity."
Similarly, Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy highlights that "RICO claims based
on mail or wire fraud must comport with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
9(b)'s requirement that allegations involving fraud be pleaded with
particularity." This means vague allegations or general assertions of
wrongdoing are insufficient to survive judicial scrutiny.

Analysis: Challenges in the Domestic Dispute
Context
Difficulty Establishing an Enterprise in Domestic
Relationships
In the context of a domestic dispute, proving the existence of an enterprise
that meets RICO's requirements presents significant challenges. When a
wife and stepfather claim their actions were part of a domestic dispute, they
directly challenge the enterprise element of a RICO claim.
Family relationships, even those involving alleged wrongdoing, do not
automatically constitute the type of enterprise contemplated by RICO. As 
Sundquist v. Hultquist explains, an enterprise must be "distinct, separate,
and apart from a pattern of racketeering activity." In domestic contexts, it
can be difficult to demonstrate that family members formed an organized
entity with the common purpose, structure, and longevity necessary to
qualify as a RICO enterprise.
Reynolds v. Condon, 908 F.Supp. 1494 (N.D. W.Va. 1996) provides some
flexibility in that "the common or shared purpose of the 'RICO
enterprise' [need not] in fact be the criminal or injurious scheme of which
the plaintiff complains," but the enterprise must still have "continuity of
structure and structure distinct from that inherent in a pattern of
racketeering activity." Establishing this distinct structure in a family
relationship poses a significant hurdle.
Proving Criminal Intent vs. Domestic Conflict
A fundamental challenge in applying RICO to domestic disputes is
distinguishing criminal intent from actions that, while potentially harmful,
are part of personal or family conflicts. Defending Civil RICO Claims: A
Defense Plan Should Be In Every Business's Arsenal emphasizes that "if
there is nothing criminal in nature about the complained-of conduct, RICO
should not apply."
The wife and stepfather's argument that their actions were merely part of a
domestic dispute directly challenges the criminal intent element needed for
RICO predicate acts. Courts are generally cautious about applying RICO to
what might be characterized as ordinary disputes. As noted in Saine v. AIA,
INC., 582 F.Supp. 1299 (D. Colo. 1984), courts must "avoid a slavish
literalism that would escort into federal court through RICO what
traditionally have been civil actions in state courts."
This judicial reluctance to expand RICO beyond its intended scope creates
an additional hurdle for the husband to overcome. He must convincingly
demonstrate that the wife and stepfather's actions constituted criminal
activity rather than merely harmful conduct within a domestic dispute.

Challenges in Establishing a Pattern of Racketeering
Activity
Even if individual predicate acts can be established, demonstrating a pattern
of racketeering activity in domestic disputes presents its own challenges. 
Studco Bldg. Sys. emphasizes that RICO's remedies are not appropriate for
"the ordinary run of commercial transactions." By extension, they are even
less appropriate for ordinary domestic conflicts.
The pattern requirement demands both relationship between the acts and
continuity of criminal activity. RICO: A Primer explains that "proof of
'continuity plus relationship' is necessary" for establishing a pattern. In
domestic disputes, actions may be isolated or sporadic rather than
continuous, making it difficult to demonstrate the required pattern.
Additionally, Defending Civil RICO Claims: A Defense Plan Should Be In
Every Business's Arsenal notes that "if the alleged conduct occurred once or
twice, or was not continuous, it cannot form a pattern of conduct sufficient
to support a RICO claim." This continuity requirement presents a substantial
obstacle when the alleged wrongdoing occurs within the context of a
domestic relationship rather than an ongoing criminal enterprise.
Proving Injury to Business or Property
Another significant challenge involves demonstrating the specific type of
injury required for RICO claims. La Ronde-Bey v. Chica explicitly states that
"personal injury or emotional harm are not proper bases for a RICO claim."
The plaintiff must show "a concrete financial loss in the form of an injury to
business or property."
In domestic disputes, injuries often include emotional distress, reputation
damage, and other personal harms that do not qualify as injuries to business
or property under RICO. The husband must identify and prove specific
financial losses directly caused by the alleged racketeering activity to
establish standing for a RICO claim.
Furthermore, Defending RICO Claims In The Business Context Part II
emphasizes that the plaintiff must show damages that are "known" rather
than "mere speculative or unprovable damages." This requirement for
concrete, provable financial damages adds another layer of difficulty to
establishing a RICO claim in a domestic context.
Heightened Pleading Standards
The heightened pleading standards applicable to RICO claims present yet
another obstacle. Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy notes that "the practitioner
through their pleadings must articulate with great care and attention a
viable racketeering claim." This is particularly challenging in domestic
disputes, where specific details about alleged fraudulent schemes may be
difficult to articulate with the required particularity.

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
As Tashjian v. Deutsche Bank demonstrates, courts will dismiss RICO claims
that "do not contain sufficient factual material from which the Court can
reasonably infer that the defendants' alleged actions were the conduct of an
enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity." The husband would
need to provide specific, non-conclusory facts showing both the enterprise
and pattern elements to survive judicial scrutiny.
Evidentiary Requirements to Establish a
Viable RICO Claim
Clear Evidence of a Fraudulent Scheme
To overcome the defense that actions were merely part of a domestic
dispute, the husband must provide clear evidence of a fraudulent scheme. 
Eclectic Props. E., LLC v. Marcus & Millichap Co. notes that racketeering
activity involving mail and wire fraud requires evidence of "the formation of
a scheme to defraud" and "the specific intent to defraud."
This evidence must be specific and detailed enough to satisfy the heightened
pleading standards. Vague allegations or general assertions of wrongdoing
will be insufficient to establish a fraudulent scheme, particularly when the
defendants can characterize their actions as part of normal, if contentious,
domestic relations.
Specific Predicate Acts
The husband must also identify and provide evidence of specific predicate
acts that qualify as racketeering activity under RICO. Nutrition Distribution
LLC v. Custom Nutraceuticals LLC, 194 F.Supp.3d 952 (D. Ariz. 2016)
emphasizes that "the plaintiff must adequately plead the elements of each
predicate act, satisfying the pleading standard that would apply if the
predicate act were a stand-alone claim."
This means that for each alleged predicate act, the husband must provide
evidence that meets all elements of the underlying crime. For example, if
mail or wire fraud is alleged, there must be evidence of a scheme to defraud,
use of mail or wires, and specific intent to defraud. The evidence must be
sufficiently detailed to differentiate criminal activity from non-criminal
domestic disputes.
Concrete Evidence of Injury to Business or Property
To establish standing for a RICO claim, the husband must provide concrete
evidence of injury to his business or property. As La Ronde-Bey v. Chica
makes clear, personal injury or emotional harm is insufficient for a RICO
claim.
The husband would need to demonstrate specific financial losses directly
caused by the alleged racketeering activity. This requires establishing not

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
only the existence of damages but also a causal connection between those
damages and the alleged wrongful conduct.
Exceptions and Caveats
Domestic Relations Exception to Federal Jurisdiction
While not directly addressed in the provided materials, it is worth noting
that federal courts have traditionally been reluctant to intervene in domestic
relations matters. This judicial philosophy, known as the domestic relations
exception to federal jurisdiction, could further complicate a RICO claim
arising from what is characterized as a domestic dispute.
Although RICO provides federal jurisdiction, courts might view with
skepticism attempts to transform what they perceive as fundamentally
domestic matters into federal racketeering claims. This could lead to
additional scrutiny of the enterprise and pattern elements when the
underlying conflict is domestic in nature.
Distinguishing Criminal Enterprises from Domestic
Relationships
The line between a RICO enterprise and a domestic relationship can be
difficult to define. Reynolds v. Condon suggests that an enterprise need not
have an inherently criminal purpose, but it must still have organizational
characteristics distinct from the pattern of racketeering activity.
In domestic contexts, this distinction can be particularly blurry. Family
relationships already have their own structures and purposes independent of
any alleged wrongdoing. However, these natural family structures may not
necessarily constitute the type of enterprise contemplated by RICO, which
was designed primarily to address organized criminal activity.
Conclusion
Successfully establishing a RICO claim in the context of a domestic dispute
presents formidable challenges. The husband faces significant hurdles in
proving that the wife and stepfather's actions constituted conduct of an
enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity rather than merely
actions taken within the context of a domestic conflict.
To overcome these challenges, the husband must provide clear evidence that
distinguishes the alleged wrongdoing from ordinary domestic disputes. This
includes establishing the existence of an enterprise with organizational
structure, demonstrating a pattern of related and continuous criminal
activity, and providing concrete evidence of injury to business or property
directly caused by the alleged racketeering activity.
The courts have consistently emphasized that RICO was designed to address
organized criminal activity and widespread fraud, not ordinary disputes or

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
personal conflicts. As stated in Studco Bldg. Sys. U.S., LLC v. 1st Advantage
Fed. Credit Union, RICO's elements are "'demanding' because 'Congress
contemplated that only a party engaging in widespread fraud would be
subject to RICO's serious consequences.'"
In the absence of compelling evidence that clearly establishes all required
elements, courts will likely be reluctant to allow RICO claims to proceed in
what they perceive as fundamentally domestic disputes. The wife and
stepfather's defense that their actions were part of a domestic dispute
rather than a criminal enterprise directly challenges the core elements
required for a successful RICO claim and presents a substantial obstacle for
the husband to overcome.
Only with specific, detailed evidence of a fraudulent scheme, qualifying
predicate acts, and concrete financial injury can the husband hope to
establish a viable RICO claim in the face of the domestic dispute defense.
The burden of proof is substantial, reflecting the courts' careful approach to
applying RICO's serious consequences only in cases that truly involve the
organized criminal activity the statute was designed to combat.
Legal Authorities
Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., Inc., 741 F.2d 482 (2nd Cir. 1984)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Second Circuit
Extract
We agree with the district court that the appellant has failed to allege any
injury to its business 'by reason of a violation of section 1962,' as required
by section 1964(c). The 'by reason of' standing limitation to RICO has been
endorsed by a great many district courts... RICO was intended not simply to
provide additional remedies for already compensable injuries, but rather to
provide added remedies and procedures to fight certain specific kinds of
organized criminality. The 'by reason of' language, therefore, requires that
plaintiffs allege injury caused by an activity which RICO was designed to
deter, which, whatever it may be, is different from that caused simply by
such predicate acts as are alleged here.
Summary
The passage highlights the challenges in establishing a RICO claim,
particularly the requirement to show an injury "by reason of" a RICO
violation. This implies that the injury must be linked to the type of organized
criminality RICO was designed to combat, rather than just any predicate
acts. This supports the proposition that proving a RICO claim in a domestic
dispute context can be difficult, as the husband must demonstrate a
connection between the alleged acts and the type of criminal enterprise
RICO targets.

U.S. District Court — Northern District of West Virginia
Extract
More specifically, the defendants attack the plaintiff's RICO claim, the only
one upon which federal jurisdiction is based, as time-barred, pleading no
proper RICO enterprise or conduct of that enterprise by the RICO
defendants, and failing to allege a pattern of racketeering activity or
continuing criminal activity... Thus, to establish a RICO violation under 18
U.S.C. § 1962(c) a plaintiff must demonstrate '(1) conduct (2) of an
enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity that must
include at least two racketeering acts.'... The court concludes here that
there is no requirement that the common or shared purpose of the 'RICO
enterprise' in fact be the criminal or injurious scheme of which the plaintiff
complains, or even that the common or shared purpose be illegal activity
aimed at this or other victims; the enterprise need only have a common or
shared purpose, which may be legal or otherwise, and may be related to the
predicate acts or not, as the case may be, as well as the other organizational
characteristics of an enterprise, continuity of structure and structure
distinct from that inherent in a pattern of racketeering activity... The court
turned next to the adequacy of the pleading of the elements of a substantive
RICO claim under § 1962(c). Although the court concludes that a law firm
may properly be a 'RICO enterprise,' the court concludes that there are no
adequate allegations, nor could there be, that the RICO defendants
'conducted' the affairs of that RICO enterprise through a pattern of
racketeering.
Summary
Requirements for establishing a RICO violation, emphasizing the need for a
plaintiff to demonstrate conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of
racketeering activity. It highlights the challenges in proving the existence of
a RICO enterprise, especially when the alleged enterprise may not have a
shared illegal purpose. This supports the proposition that proving a RICO
claim in a domestic dispute context can be difficult, as the husband must
clearly establish the fraudulent scheme, predicate acts, and resulting injury.

Summary
Requirements for establishing a RICO claim, emphasizing the need for a
distinct enterprise and a pattern of racketeering activity. It highlights the
challenges in proving such claims, especially in cases that may involve
personal or domestic disputes, where the existence of an organized, long-
term criminal enterprise is difficult to establish. The passage also notes the
heightened pleading standard for fraud allegations, which requires
particularity in the claims. This supports the proposition that the husband
may face challenges in proving the intent and connection between the
predicate acts and the alleged injury, as well as the difficulty in establishing
a RICO claim in a domestic context.

U.S. District Court — District of Colorado
Extract
RICO does not by its terms prohibit only the acts of those associated with
'organized crime.' It was, however, the declared purpose of Congress to
'seek the eradication of organized crime in the United States.' See United
States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 589, 101 S.Ct. 2524, 2531, 69 L.Ed.2d 246

The passage highlights that RICO is not limited to organized crime but
should be interpreted in light of its purpose to avoid bringing traditional
civil actions into federal court under RICO. This supports the proposition
that proving a RICO claim in a domestic dispute can be challenging, as the
courts are cautious about extending RICO to cases that may not align with
its intended purpose. The passage suggests that the husband must provide

We start with the elements a plaintiff must plead to state a RICO violation...
The RICO statute sets out four elements: a defendant must participate in (1)
the conduct of (2) an enterprise that affects interstate commerce (3) through
a pattern (4) of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt. 18 U.S.C.
§ 1962(c). In addition, the conduct must be (5) the proximate cause of harm
to the victim... To show the existence of an enterprise under the second
element, plaintiffs must plead that the enterprise has (A) a common purpose,
(B) a structure or organization, and (C) longevity necessary to accomplish
the purpose... Racketeering activity, the fourth element, requires predicate
acts, which in this case are alleged to be mail and wire fraud... and contain
three elements: (A) the formation of a scheme to defraud, (B) the use of the
mails or wires in furtherance of that scheme, and (C) the specific intent to
defraud.
Summary
Necessary elements to establish a RICO violation, which includes proving
the existence of an enterprise, a pattern of racketeering activity, and specific
intent to defraud. These elements are crucial in distinguishing between a
criminal enterprise and a personal or domestic dispute. The passage
highlights the challenges in proving these elements, especially in cases
where the alleged actions may be part of a domestic dispute rather than a
criminal enterprise. This supports the proposition that the husband may face

activity ( § 1962(c) ); or conspiring to commit any of the above ( §
1962(d) ). ... Racketeering activity, the fourth element of a § 1962(c) claim,
requires predicate acts. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1). A 'pattern' of racketeering
activity requires evidence of at least two predicate acts within ten years of
one another, id. § 1961(5), which the Supreme Court has interpreted to
require a plaintiff to show similarity between both the acts (relationship)
and continuing activity (continuity), H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 239–41, 109 S.Ct.
2893.
Summary
To establish a RICO claim, a plaintiff must demonstrate a pattern of
racketeering activity and a connection to an enterprise. This involves
proving predicate acts and a continuity of criminal conduct. In cases
involving personal or domestic disputes, such as the one described in the
proposition, it can be challenging to establish these elements, as the actions
may not clearly fit the definition of a criminal enterprise or pattern of
racketeering activity. The passage highlights the complexity and specificity
required in proving a RICO claim, which supports the proposition that the
husband may face challenges in proving the intent and connection between
the acts and the alleged injury.
Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy
The Brief - American Bar Association - 2024-01-01
Extract
A violation of § 1962(c), the section on which Sedima relies, requires (1)
conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity. The plaintiff must allege each of the elements to state a claim. They
are all equally essential components, and the complaint will fail if any one of
them is not adequately pleaded. In particular, RICO claims based on mail or

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
wire fraud must comport with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b)’s
requirement that allegations involving fraud be pleaded with particularity.
The practitioner through their pleadings must articulate with great care and
attention a viable racketeering claim.
Summary
Essential elements required to establish a RICO claim under § 1962(c),
emphasizing the need for a structured enterprise, a pattern of racketeering
activity, and specific conduct. It highlights the challenges in pleading such
claims, particularly the requirement for particularity in fraud allegations.
This supports the proposition by illustrating the difficulties the husband may
face in proving the existence of a criminal enterprise and a pattern of
racketeering activity, especially in a domestic context where such elements
may not be readily apparent.
Defending Civil RICO Claims: A Defense Plan Should Be In Every Business's
Arsenal
Extract
RICO is not a simple statute. It pertains to conduct associated with an
'enterprise' and 'a pattern racketeering activity.' An enterprise is an
individual or legal entity, or a union or group of individuals associated in fact
although not a legal entity, while a pattern of racketeering activity requires
long-term, organized conduct to violate state and federal laws... Second, to
prove most types of RICO claims, the plaintiff must plead that the defendant
committed some qualifying criminal action, the most common of which is
mail, wire or securities fraud... If there is nothing criminal in nature about
the complained-of conduct, RICO should not apply. It is an abuse of the RICO
statute to attempt to shoehorn ordinary business or contractual disputes
into a civil RICO claim. Third, the plaintiff must plead a pattern of
racketeering activity for most RICO claims. If the alleged conduct occurred
once or twice, or was not continuous, it cannot form a pattern of conduct
sufficient to support a RICO claim.
Summary
Complexity of RICO claims, emphasizing the need for a clear demonstration
of a criminal enterprise and a pattern of racketeering activity. It highlights
the difficulty in proving such claims, especially when the conduct in question
may not be inherently criminal or when it resembles ordinary disputes. This
aligns with the proposition that proving a RICO claim in a domestic dispute
context can be challenging due to the need for clear evidence of criminal
intent and a pattern of illegal activity.

Summary
Complexity of RICO claims, emphasizing the need for a clear demonstration
of a criminal enterprise and a pattern of racketeering activity. It highlights
that RICO claims are not applicable to ordinary disputes and require proof
of criminal conduct. This supports the proposition that the husband may
face challenges in proving the intent and connection between the wife's and
stepfather's actions and the alleged injury, as personal or domestic disputes
may not meet the RICO criteria.
Defending RICO Claims In The Business Context Part II: RICO Claims Must
Allege Injury To Business Or Property
Extract
If a plaintiff brings a civil suit alleging a RICO violation, the plaintiff must
plausibly allege that his injury animating the RICO claim is associated with
his business or property by reason of the defendant's violation of the RICO
laws. Absent these allegations, the lawsuit must be dismissed. RICO
standing is distinct from the more well-known concept of constitutional
standing. For RICO claims, in addition to pleading a sufficiently specific
injury, including allegations that the plaintiff has suffered known damages
(as opposed to mere speculative or unprovable damages), the plaintiff must
allege that he suffered an injury to his business or property that bears some
causal relationship to the alleged act or acts that violated RICO.
Summary
RICO claims require a plaintiff to demonstrate a specific injury to business
or property that is causally linked to the alleged RICO violation. This
requirement can be particularly challenging in cases involving personal or
domestic disputes, where the connection between the alleged acts and a

=== PAGE 17 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
business or property injury may not be clear. The passage highlights the
necessity for the plaintiff to provide clear evidence of the injury and its
causal relationship to the RICO violation, which aligns with the proposition
that the husband may face challenges in proving the intent and connection
between the predicate acts and the alleged injury.
RICO: A Primer
Extract
The heart of a RICO case is the existence of a pattern of racketeering
activity. Under the statute, 'racketeering activity' includes a host of
offenses... A RICO enterprise includes 'any individual, partnership,
corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of
individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.' Courts have
interpreted 'enterprise' broadly, and the definition captures both legitimate
and illegitimate enterprises... A 'pattern' may exist where any combination
of two or more offenses occurred within a period of time. In Sedima, S.P.R.L.
v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479, the Supreme Court held that the RICO pattern
element requires more than merely proving two predicate acts of
racketeering. Rather, proof of 'continuity plus relationship' is necessary.
Summary
The passage explains the requirements for establishing a RICO claim,
including the need to prove a pattern of racketeering activity and the
existence of an enterprise. It highlights the complexity of proving a RICO
case, especially the necessity of demonstrating "continuity plus relationship"
for the pattern element. This supports the proposition that proving a RICO
claim in a domestic dispute context can be challenging, as the husband must
clearly establish the fraudulent scheme, predicate acts, and resulting injury,
which may be difficult if the actions are argued to be part of a domestic
dispute rather than a criminal enterprise.
