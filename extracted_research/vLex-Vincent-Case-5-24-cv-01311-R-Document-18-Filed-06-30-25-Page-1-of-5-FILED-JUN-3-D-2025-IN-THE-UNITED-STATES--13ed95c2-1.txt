(3) MEMORANDUM OF LAW I. INT RODUCTION Plaintiffs First Amen ded
Complaint attempts to reframe a contentious domestic dispute and family
court li tigation as a federal RICO conspiracy. However, the Complaint fails
to allege the essential elements of a RICO claim, lacks particularity, and is
improperly venued in this District. Moreover, the factual a ll egations are
speculative, conclusory, and unsupported by a dmissible evidence. II. LEGAL
STA NDARD To survive a motion to dismiss u n der Rule 12(b)(6), a
complaint must contain "enough facts to state a claim to relief t h at is p
lausible on its face." Be ll At!. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007).
Mere labels, conclusions, or a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause
ofaction are insufficient. Ashcroft v. Iqba l, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). 1 Case
5:24-cv-01311-R Document 18 Filed 06/30/25 Page 2 of 5 Ill.ARGUMENT A.
Plaintiff Fails to State a RICO Claim To state a civil RICO claim, a plaintiff
must allege: (1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of
racketeering activity. Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. lmrex Co., 473 U.S. 479,496 (1985).
Plaintiff fails to plausibly allege any of these elements. 1. No Plausible
"Enterprise" Plaintiff alleges an "association-in-fact" enterprise between two
individuals involved in a personal relationship. Courts have consistently held
that personal relationships, even if strained or adversarial, do not constitute
a RICO enterprise. See United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 583 (1981);
Begala v. PNC Bank, Ohio, N.A., 214 F.3d 776, 781 (6th Cir. 2000). 2. No
Pattern of Racketeering Activity Plaintiffs allegations span a short period
and involve no ongoing threat of criminal activity. The Supreme Court has
held that a "pattern" requires continuity and relatedness. H.J. Inc. v.
Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 239 (1989). Sporadic or isolated
acts do not suffice. See Sil-Flo, Inc. v. SFHC, Inc., 917 F.2d 1507, 1516 (10th
Cir. 1990). 3. No Predicate Acts Plaintiff alleges wire fraud and Travel Act
violations, but fails to plead them with the specificity required under Rule
9(b ). See Koch v. Koch Indus., Inc., 203 F.3d 1202, 2 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R
Document 18 Filed 06/30/25 Page 3 of 5 1236 (10th Cir. 2000). The
Complaint lacks dates, content, and context of the alleged fraudulent
communications. 8. Plaintiff's Claims Are Based on a Domestic Dispute The
gravamen of Plaintiffs complaint is a failed marriage and related family
court proceedings. Courts have repeatedly rejected attempts to convert
family law disputes into RICO claims. See Annulli v. Panikkar, 200 F.3d 189,
200 (3d Cir. 1999); Bell v. Dean, No. 2:09-CV-1082-WKW, 2010 WL 185608
(M.D. Ala. Jan. 19, 2010); Benton v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., No. 1:13-
CV-01454, 2014 WL 1407584 (N.D. Ga. Apr. 10, 2014). C. Plaintiff Lacks
Standing Under RICO To have standing under 18 U.S.C. § 1964( c ), a
plaintiff must show injury to "business or property." Emotional distress,
reputational harm, or speculative business losses are not sufficient See

Holmes v. Sec. Investor Prot Corp., 503 U.S. 258, 268 (1992); Reiter v.
Sonotone Corp., 442 U.S. 330, 339 (1979). D. Venue Is Improper in the
Western District of Oklahoma Under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b ), venue is proper
only where a substantial part of the events giving rise to the claim occurred.
Plaintiffs allegations center on events in Texas, including divorce
proceedings in Tarrant County. The only connection to Oklahoma is the
residence of one defendant, which is insufficient. See Woodke v. Dahm, 70 F.
3d 983, 985 (8th Cir. 1995). 3 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R Document 18 Filed
06/30/25 Page 4 of 5 E. Counterarguments to Plaintiffs Specific Claims 1.
Alleged Wire Fraud Plaintiff claims a $1,576 transfer was fraudulent.
However, both parties had access to the joint account Courts have held that
transfers between spouses from joint accounts do not constitute fraud. See
United States v. Sayakhom, 186 F.3d 928, 939 (9th Cir. 1999). 2. Alleged
Travel Act Violation Plaintiff alleges interstate travel to commit fraud.
However, travel for personal reasons, even if related to a divorce, does not
constitute a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1952 unless it furthers a criminal
enterprise. See United States v. Nardella, 393 U.S. 286, 290 (1969). 3.
Alleged Perjury and False Filings Even if Plaintiffs allegations of false
statements in court filings were true, perjury in state court proceedings is
not a predicate act under RICO. See Kim v. Kimm, 884 F.3d 98, 104 (2d Cir.
2018). IV. CONCLUSION For the foregoing reasons, Defendants respectfully
request that the Court: 1. Dismiss Plaintiffs First Amended Complaint with
prejudice under Rule 12(b)(6); 2. Alternatively, dismiss for improper venue
under Rule 12(b)(3); and 3. Grant such other relief as the Court deems just
and proper. 4 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R Document 18 Filed 06/30/25 Page 5 of 5

DISTRICT COURT FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF OKLAHOMA
CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, Plaintiff, v. DANIEL KENNETH BRANTHOOVER
& MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS Defendants § § § § § Case No.: CIV-24-1311-
R § § § § § PLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT
DANIEL BRANTHOOVER’S MOTION TO DISMISS FIRST AMENDED
COMPLAINT Branthoover's motion to dismiss fails because Plaintiff has
adequately pled all RICO elements with sufficient particularity, including
predicate acts of wire fraud and Travel Act violations, a pattern of
racketeering activity spanning 18 months, an enterprise with distinct roles,
and concrete business injuries. Branthoover's alteration of his motion by
removing "COMES NOW DAN AND MORGAN" after Plaintiff pointed out he
couldn't file for Myers demonstrates his unauthorized practice of law and
furthers the conspiracy allegations. For the forthcoming reasons,
Defendant’s motion to dismiss should be DENIED and the case should be
permitted to proceed to discovery after Defendant Myers’ motion to dismiss
or response to Plaintiff’s complaint is filed with the Court. 2 I. Introduction
1. Defendant Branthoover's motion to dismiss must be denied because
Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged each essential element of a civil RICO claim
under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) and (d). The complaint meticulously details
predicate acts of wire fraud and Travel Act violations with the required
particularity under Rule 9(b), establishes a pattern of racketeering activity
through related acts spanning approximately 18 months (satisfying both
closed-ended and open-ended continuity requirements), identifies a distinct
enterprise with defined roles, and demonstrates concrete injury to business
and property as required for standing under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c). 2.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Branthoover’s attempt to file on behalf of Myers and subsequent alteration
of the motion document after being challenged provides further evidence
supporting Plaintiff’s allegations of unauthorized practice of law and
ongoing conspiracy. This conduct aligns with the pattern of deceptive
behavior alleged throughout the complaint and demonstrates that the
fraudulent activity continues even during the litigation process, reinforcing
the open-ended continuity of the enterprise’s operations. II. Legal
Framework: RICO Requirements A. Sufficiency of RICO Claim Allegations 3.
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) prohibits
conducting or participating in the conduct of an enterprise's affairs through
a pattern of racketeering activity, 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). To establish a civil
RICO claim, a plaintiff must allege "(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3)
through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity," plus injury to business or
property. 3 4. Under 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1), "racketeering activity" includes
"any act which is indictable under" numerous federal criminal statutes,
including wire fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343) and Travel Act violations (18 U.S.C. §
1952). A "pattern of racketeering activity" requires at least two acts of
racketeering activity within a ten-year period, 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5). 5. An
"enterprise" includes "any individual, partnership, corporation, association,
or other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals associated in fact
although not a legal entity," 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4). III. Analysis of
Branthoover's Motion to Dismiss A. Sufficiency of RICO Claim Allegations 6.
Branthoover first argues that Plaintiff's complaint fails to allege facts
sufficient to support a RICO claim. This argument is without merit when
analyzed against the detailed allegations in the complaint. Predicate Acts -
Wire Fraud 7. The complaint extensively details acts that constitute wire
fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343. Wire fraud requires "(1) a scheme or artifice
to defraud or obtain money by false pretenses, representations or promises;
and (2) use of interstate wire communications to facilitate that scheme." 8.
Plaintiff alleges with precision: i. Myers transferred $1,576 from the parties'
joint marital PNC account to Branthoover's PayPal account (username
"dmb575"), completely depleting the account balance. (Complaint ¶25) 4 ii.
The transfer occurred on December 15, 2023, immediately following
Branthoover's deceptive phone call. (Complaint ¶25) iii. 92 text messages
were exchanged between Myers and Branthoover on December 14, 2023,
coordinating their plan across state lines. (Complaint ¶19) iv. Interstate
communications occurred between Texas (where Myers was located) and
Oklahoma (where Branthoover was located). (Complaint ¶67) v. Branthoover
deceived Plaintiff by stating "I've been where you are before. I want to help
both of you," when his true intent was to assist Myers in depleting their joint
account. (Complaint ¶22) 9. These allegations satisfy the elements of wire
fraud as they establish a scheme to defraud, use of interstate wire
communications in furtherance of the scheme, and intent to deprive another
of money or property. Predicate Acts - Travel Act Violations 10. The
complaint also details violations of the Travel Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1952, which
prohibits travel in interstate commerce or use of interstate facilities with
intent to promote, manage, establish, carry on, or facilitate unlawful activity.
11. Plaintiff alleges: i. Myers traveled interstate from Texas to Oklahoma on
December 15, 2023, to coordinate with Branthoover. (Complaint ¶¶23-24) 5
ii. This travel was specifically intended to prepare fraudulent court
documents. (Complaint ¶33) iii. Myers transported the fraudulent
documents back to Texas on December 17, 2023. (Complaint ¶35) iv. After

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
the interstate travel, Myers filed the fraudulent documents with Texas
courts. (Complaint ¶¶39-42) 12. These allegations establish all elements of a
Travel Act violation: interstate travel, intent to facilitate unlawful activity,
and subsequent performance of acts furthering that unlawful activity.
Pattern of Racketeering Activity 13. Under 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5), a "pattern of
racketeering activity" requires at least two acts of racketeering activity
within a ten-year period. However, the Tenth Circuit requires more than just
two predicate acts; the acts must be related and continuous. 14. Plaintiff's
complaint alleges multiple related predicate acts spanning approximately 18
months, from December 2023 through May 2025: i. Wire transfer of $1,576
on December 15, 2023. (Complaint ¶25) ii. Interstate travel and document
preparation on December 15-17, 2023. (Complaint ¶¶35-39) iii. Filing of
fraudulent court documents on December 18, 2023. (Complaint ¶39) iv.
Filing of fraudulent protective order application on December 22, 2023.
(Complaint ¶45) 6 v. Threatening communications continuing through
December 12, 2024. (Complaint ¶51) vi. Most recent threatening
communication on May 24, 2025. (Complaint ¶52) vii. The transmission of a
motion to dismiss across interstate communications by Branthoover, CC’ing
defendant Myers as if filing on her behalf. See Exhibit 1. 15. These acts are
related as they share the same purpose (depriving Plaintiff of property
rights), involve the same participants (Myers and Branthoover), target the
same victim (Plaintiff), and employ similar methods (deception and
manipulation of legal processes). 16. The pattern also demonstrates both
closed-ended continuity (acts spanning over 18 months and is ongoing) and
open-ended continuity (threat of continued criminal activity, evidenced by
Branthoover's May 2025 message threatening future retaliation). An
enterprise under RICO includes "any individual, partnership, corporation,
association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals
associated in fact although not a legal entity," 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4).
Enterprise 17. Plaintiff alleges an association-in-fact enterprise between
Myers and Branthoover with clear organizational structure: i. Myers acted
as the "inside" operative with access to marital assets and ability to file
documents in Texas courts. (Complaint ¶91) 7 ii. Branthoover served as the
"outside" operative providing administrative oversight, expertise on
protective orders, and a base of operations in Oklahoma. (Complaint ¶91) iii.
The enterprise functioned as a continuing unit from December 2023 through
June 27, 2025, with consistent roles and coordinated actions. (Complaint
¶91) 18. This enterprise is distinct from the pattern of racketeering activity
itself, possessing structure beyond what was necessary to commit the
predicate acts. Injury to Business or Property 19. For standing under 18
U.S.C. § 1964(c), a plaintiff must allege injury to business or property by
reason of a RICO violation. 20. Plaintiff alleges concrete, quantifiable
injuries: i. Loss of $1,576 fraudulently transferred from the joint marital
account. (Complaint ¶¶25, 104) ii. Business losses from disruption of his
home-based financial analytics business. (Complaint ¶¶115-123) iii.
Documented revenue loss with specific projections based on historical
performance. (Complaint ¶¶121-122) iv. Total damages quantified at
$101,370.58. (Complaint ¶126) 21. These allegations establish concrete
injury to business and property as required for RICO standing. 8 B. Pleading
Fraud with Particularity (Rule 9(b)) 22. Branthoover argues that Plaintiff's
allegations of wire fraud fail to meet the heightened pleading standard of
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b). This argument fails given the detailed

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
factual allegations in the complaint. 23. Rule 9(b) requires that a party
"state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake,"
including the "who, what, when, where, and how" of the alleged misconduct.
The complaint provides these details with precision: i. Who: Myers and
Branthoover. (Complaint ¶¶5-6) ii. What: Transfer of $1,576 from joint
marital account to Branthoover's PayPal account. (Complaint ¶25) iii. When:
December 15, 2023, with exact timestamps for communications. (Complaint
¶¶22, 25) iv. Where: Interstate between Texas and Oklahoma. (Complaint
¶67) v. How: Through PayPal, using account identifier "dmb575". (Complaint
¶28) 24. The complaint also details: i. The content of specific
communications, including direct quotes. (Complaint ¶¶22, 30, 40) ii. The
specific documents prepared and filed fraudulently. (Complaint ¶39) 9 iii.
The precise false statements contained in those documents. (Complaint
¶¶43-44, 46) 25. These allegations amply satisfy Rule 9(b)'s requirement to
plead fraud with particularity. C. RICO Claims Based on Domestic Disputes
26. Branthoover argues that Plaintiff's allegations arise primarily from a
domestic dispute and related family court proceedings, which do not
constitute the type of organized criminal activity contemplated by RICO.
While courts have been skeptical of RICO claims arising solely from
domestic disputes, Plaintiff's allegations go far beyond a mere domestic
disagreement. The complaint alleges a sophisticated scheme involving: i.
Interstate travel and commerce. (Complaint ¶¶23-25, 35) ii. Strategic
coordination between multiple parties. (Complaint ¶¶19, 33, 91-92) iii.
Financial crimes including wire fraud. (Complaint ¶¶25-28) iv. Manipulation
of multiple court proceedings. (Complaint ¶¶39-46) v. Substantial business
injuries. (Complaint ¶¶115-123) 27. This is precisely the type of interstate
racketeering activity that RICO was designed to address, regardless of
whether it arose in the context of a domestic relationship. 10 D. RICO
Standing and Injury 28. Branthoover argues that Plaintiff lacks standing to
bring a RICO claim because he has not alleged a concrete injury to business
or property as required under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c). 29. This argument is
contradicted by the complaint's detailed allegations of specific injuries: i.
Loss of $1,576 fraudulently transferred from the joint marital account.
(Complaint ¶¶25, 104) ii. Documented business disruption when Plaintiff
was forced to vacate his home, where he operated his business. (Complaint
¶119) iii. Specific impact on business operations, including inability to
maintain internet connectivity required for his digital financial analytics
business. (Complaint ¶120) iv. Quantified loss of business revenue based on
historical performance data. (Complaint ¶¶121-122) v. Total damages of
$101,370.58, consisting of $99,794.58 in lost business income and $1,576 in
fraudulently transferred funds. (Complaint ¶126) 30. These allegations
establish concrete, non-speculative injuries to business and property that
are directly traceable to defendants' alleged RICO violations. 11 E.
Continuity of Racketeering Activity 31. Branthoover argues that Plaintiff
fails to allege continuity of racketeering activity. Under 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5),
a "pattern of racketeering activity" requires at least two acts of racketeering
activity within a ten-year period. However, courts have established that
these acts must demonstrate either "closed-ended" continuity (a series of
related acts extending over a substantial period) or "open-ended" continuity
(past conduct that by its nature projects into the future with a threat of
repetition). 32. The complaint alleges both: i. Closed-ended continuity:
Related acts spanning from December 2023 through May 2025,

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
approximately 18 months (Complaint ¶¶49-52, 86) ii. Open-ended continuity:
Ongoing threats and monitoring activities with explicit threats of future
retaliation, including Branthoover's May 24, 2025 message stating "Where's
my lawsuit? Heard your vm about me. File it. Let's do this :)" (Complaint
¶¶51-52, 86) 33. This temporal scope exceeds what courts typically consider
sufficient to establish continuity for RICO purposes. F. Venue in the Western
District of Oklahoma 34. Branthoover challenges venue in the Western
District of Oklahoma. Under 18 U.S.C. § 1965(a), "Any civil action or
proceeding under this chapter against any person may be instituted in the
district court of the United States for any district in which such person
resides, is found, has an agent, or transacts his affairs." 12 35. Additionally,
under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b), venue is proper in "a judicial district in which any
defendant resides" or "a judicial district in which a substantial part of the
events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred." 36. Venue is proper in
the Western District of Oklahoma because: i. Branthoover resides in
Canadian County, Oklahoma, which is within the Western District.
(Complaint ¶5) 37. Substantial parts of the events occurred in Oklahoma,
including: i. Preparation of fraudulent court documents at Branthoover's
residence (Complaint ¶33) ii. Myers' interstate travel to Oklahoma to
coordinate the scheme. (Complaint ¶23) iii. Receipt of the fraudulently
transferred funds in Oklahoma. (Complaint ¶25) 38. These connections
establish proper venue in the Western District of Oklahoma under both 18
U.S.C. § 1965(a) and 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b). G. Significance of Branthoover's
Motion Alteration 39. Branthoover's alteration of his motion document after
serving it on Plaintiff provides further evidence supporting the RICO claims.
The original motion began with "COMES NOW Defendant, Daniel Kenneth
Branthoover and Morgan Michelle Myers," but was later modified to remove
the reference to filing on behalf of Myers after Plaintiff pointed out that
Branthoover could not file for her. See Exhibit 1 40. This alteration is
significant for several reasons: 13 i. It demonstrates Branthoover's
continued unauthorized practice of law, consistent with Plaintiff's allegations
in paragraph 31, which states that "at no time relevant to this litigation has
Defendant Branthoover possessed a license to practice law in any
jurisdiction within the United States". ii. It shows ongoing deceptive
conduct, as Branthoover attempted to conceal his improper filing by altering
the document after being confronted. iv. It corroborates Plaintiff's
allegations regarding Branthoover's administrative role and pattern of
misrepresentations v. It provides evidence of the continuing nature of the
conspiracy alleged in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d) 41. This conduct is
remarkably similar to Branthoover's earlier text message in which he falsely
claimed to be a legal representative, stating: "Charlie, it's come to my
understanding you have retained an attorney. I'm sure he has told you that
all further communication should take place between attorneys. I must
formally ask you refrain from discussing details of this case with my client
moving forward and only communicate with me or your attorney".
(Complaint ¶40). H. The Divorce Process Initiated Under Branthoover's
Advisement 42. The complaint specifically alleges that the divorce process
was initiated under Branthoover's advisement and with his direct
involvement. Paragraph 30 states that Branthoover told Plaintiff "You Are
Getting Divorced..." followed by "I hope I can help 14 with the paperwork
and make things go as smoothly as possible." This statement preceded any
divorce filings, indicating Branthoover's prior knowledge of and involvement

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
in the planned legal action. 43. Paragraphs 39 and 43 detail how the
fraudulent divorce petition was prepared in Oklahoma under Branthoover's
"direct administrative oversight" and contained numerous false statements
designed to deceive the Texas courts. These allegations establish that
Branthoover was an active participant in initiating and directing the divorce
process as part of the fraudulent scheme. 44. This involvement directly
counters Branthoover's argument that this is merely a domestic dispute
outside RICO's scope, as it shows his direct participation in an interstate
scheme involving predicate acts of wire fraud and Travel Act violations. 45.
Plaintiff is handling both matters separately, and Defendant Myers is unable
to finalize the divorce and has abandoned the matter. I. Perjury and
Subordinate Perjury 46. Finally, Defendant’s motion to dismiss claims
“perjury in state court proceedings is not a predicate act under RICO”. This
mischaracterizes Plaintiff’s complaint, as perjury and subordinate perjury
were not alleged to have been predicate acts themselves, but were alleged
“to support a pattern of racketeering activity…” (Complaint ¶57). 47. The
Second Circuit's decision in U.S. v. Eisen, 974 F.2d 246 (2nd Cir. 1992) is
particularly instructive. The court acknowledged the tension between
Congress's decision to include mail fraud as a predicate offense while
excluding perjury, but determined that 15 "where, as here, a fraudulent
scheme falls within the scope of the federal mail fraud statute and the other
elements of RICO are established, use of the mail fraud offense as a RICO
predicate act cannot be suspended simply because perjury is part of the
means for perpetrating the fraud." Id. at 254. By extension, this principle
would apply equally to wire fraud, which is closely related to mail fraud and
is also an enumerated RICO predicate act. 48. This means that when perjury
or subordination of perjury is committed as part of a fraudulent scheme that
includes wire fraud or Travel Act violations, these acts can contribute to
establishing a pattern of racketeering activity even though they are not
themselves predicate acts. The key is that the perjury must be interrelated
with the qualifying predicate acts and further the same criminal scheme,
which is the case in the instant matter. IV. Conclusion 46. Based on the
foregoing analysis, Branthoover's motion to dismiss should be denied in its
entirety. Plaintiff has adequately alleged all elements required for a civil
RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) and conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. §
1962(d), including: i. Predicate acts of wire fraud and Travel Act violations,
pled with the particularity required by Rule 9(b); ii. A pattern of
racketeering activity demonstrating both relatedness and continuity; 16 iii.
An association-in-fact enterprise with distinct roles and structure; iv.
Concrete injuries to business and property as required for standing under 18
U.S.C. § 1964(c); and v. Proper venue in the Western District of Oklahoma.
47. Moreover, Branthoover's alteration of his motion to dismiss document
provides further evidence of the ongoing conspiracy, demonstrating that the
pattern of deceptive conduct continues even during the litigation process. V.
Prayer WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court: i. Deny
Defendant Daniel Kenneth Branthoover’s Motion to Dismiss in its entirety; ii.
Take judicial notice that Daniel Kenneth Branthoover served two different
motions to dismiss on Plaintiff, the first purporting to be on behalf of both
Defendants, including Defendant Myers; iii. Order that this case proceed to
discovery and further proceedings on the merits; iv. Grant such other and
further relief as the Court deems just and proper. 17 Respectfully submitted,

Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
The plaintiff is likely to prevail against the motion to dismiss because he has
adequately pleaded all elements of a RICO claim, including predicate acts, a
pattern of racketeering activity, an enterprise, and concrete injury to
business and property. Venue is also proper in the Western District of
Oklahoma under 18 U.S.C. § 1965(a) since defendant Branthoover resides
there and substantial parts of the alleged activities occurred in Oklahoma.
Summary
Plaintiff Charles Dustin Myers has filed a RICO claim against defendants
Daniel Kenneth Branthoover and Morgan Michelle Myers (the plaintiff's
apparently estranged spouse), alleging they engaged in a pattern of
racketeering activity involving wire fraud and Travel Act violations.
Defendant Branthoover has moved to dismiss the complaint under Fed. R.
Civ. P. 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim and under 12(b)(3) for improper
venue. Based on the available materials, the plaintiff has adequately pleaded
all required elements for a RICO claim to survive a motion to dismiss.
The plaintiff's detailed factual allegations appear sufficient to establish the
predicate acts of wire fraud and Travel Act violations, a pattern of
racketeering activity spanning approximately 18 months, a distinct
enterprise with defined roles between the defendants, and concrete injury to
business and property required for RICO standing. Additionally, venue is
proper in the Western District of Oklahoma under 18 U.S.C. § 1965(a)
because defendant Branthoover resides there and substantial activities
related to the alleged scheme took place in Oklahoma. The motion to dismiss
should therefore be denied.
Background and Relevant Law
RICO Requirements
To prevail on a civil RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), a plaintiff must
allege "(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of

=== PAGE 9 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
racketeering activity" plus injury to business or property. Racketeering
activity includes specific federal criminal violations, notably wire fraud (18
U.S.C. § 1343) and Travel Act violations (18 U.S.C. § 1952). A "pattern of
racketeering activity" requires at least two predicate acts within a ten-year
period.
For venue in RICO cases, 18 U.S.C. § 1965(a) provides: "Any civil action or
proceeding under this chapter against any person may be instituted in the
district court of the United States for any district in which such person
resides, is found, has an agent, or transacts his affairs." This venue provision
is specific to RICO actions and supplements the general venue provisions in
28 U.S.C. § 1391.
Analysis
1. Sufficiency of the RICO Claim
A. Predicate Acts
The plaintiff has alleged two types of predicate acts with sufficient
particularity: wire fraud and Travel Act violations.
For wire fraud, the plaintiff alleges specific dates, amounts, and methods of
fraudulent transfers, including a $1,576 transfer from a joint marital
account to Branthoover's PayPal account on December 15, 2023. The
complaint also details 92 text messages exchanged between Myers and
Branthoover on December 14, 2023, coordinating their alleged plan across
state lines. These communications allegedly contained deceptive statements
designed to facilitate the scheme.
For Travel Act violations, the plaintiff alleges that Myers traveled interstate
from Texas to Oklahoma on December 15, 2023, specifically to coordinate
with Branthoover and prepare fraudulent court documents, which were later
transported back to Texas and filed with Texas courts. These allegations
establish the elements of a Travel Act violation: interstate travel with intent
to facilitate unlawful activity, followed by subsequent acts furthering that
activity.
Per the secondary source "Defending Civil RICO Claims: A Defense Plan
Should Be In Every Business's Arsenal", to prove most RICO claims, "the
plaintiff must plead that the defendant committed some qualifying criminal
action, the most common of which is mail, wire or securities fraud." The
plaintiff here has done so by pleading specific instances of wire fraud and
Travel Act violations with particularity.
B. Pattern of Racketeering Activity
A pattern of racketeering activity requires both relatedness among the
predicate acts and continuity of conduct. The plaintiff alleges related

=== PAGE 10 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
predicate acts spanning approximately 18 months, from December 2023
through May 2025, including:
Wire transfer of funds (December 15, 2023)
Interstate travel and document preparation (December 15-17, 2023)
Filing of allegedly fraudulent court documents (December 18, 2023)
Filing of allegedly fraudulent protective order application (December
22, 2023)
Threatening communications through December 12, 2024
Most recent threatening communication on May 24, 2025
These acts appear related as they share the same purpose (allegedly
depriving the plaintiff of property rights), involve the same participants,
target the same victim, and employ similar methods. The pattern
demonstrates both "closed-ended continuity" (acts spanning over 18 months)
and "open-ended continuity" (threat of continued activity, evidenced by
alleged ongoing threatening communications).
The secondary source notes that "the plaintiff must plead a pattern of
racketeering activity for most RICO claims. If the alleged conduct occurred
once or twice, or was not continuous, it cannot form a pattern of conduct
sufficient to support a RICO claim." Here, the plaintiff has alleged numerous
related acts over an 18-month period, which appears sufficient to establish a
pattern under this standard.
C. Enterprise
An "enterprise" under RICO includes "any individual, partnership,
corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of
individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity." The plaintiff
alleges an association-in-fact enterprise between Myers and Branthoover
with a defined organizational structure:
Myers allegedly acted as the "inside" operative with access to marital
assets and ability to file documents in Texas courts
Branthoover allegedly served as the "outside" operative providing
administrative oversight, expertise on protective orders, and a base of
operations in Oklahoma
The alleged enterprise functioned as a continuing unit from December
2023 through June 27, 2025, with consistent roles and coordinated
actions
These allegations appear sufficient to establish an enterprise distinct from
the predicate acts themselves, with structure beyond what was necessary to
commit those acts.
D. Injury to Business or Property
For civil RICO standing under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c), a plaintiff must allege
injury to business or property by reason of a RICO violation. The secondary
source emphasizes that "to bring a civil RICO claim, a plaintiff must
demonstrate that their business or property was injured as a result of a
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 

=== PAGE 11 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
RICO violation. In other words, there must be some sort of concrete
financial loss directly flowing from the purported violation to support a RICO
claim."
The plaintiff alleges concrete, quantifiable injuries:
Loss of $1,576 fraudulently transferred from the joint marital account
Business losses from disruption of his home-based financial analytics
business
Documented revenue loss with specific projections based on historical
performance
Total damages quantified at $101,370.58
These allegations establish concrete injury to business and property as
required for RICO standing, going beyond mere emotional distress or
speculative losses criticized in the secondary source.
2. Rule 9(b) Particularity Requirement
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) requires that a party "state with
particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake," including the
"who, what, when, where, and how" of the alleged misconduct. The
secondary source notes that because RICO claims often involve fraud, "those
instances must be particularly identified in the plaintiff's pleading—a barrier
that can prove difficult to accomplish."
The plaintiff's complaint appears to meet this standard by providing
extensive details:
Who: Myers and Branthoover
What: Transfer of $1,576 from joint marital account to Branthoover's
PayPal account
When: December 15, 2023, with exact timestamps for communications
Where: Interstate between Texas and Oklahoma
How: Through PayPal, using account identifier "dmb575"
The complaint also details the content of specific communications (with
direct quotes), the specific documents allegedly prepared and filed
fraudulently, and the precise false statements allegedly contained in those
documents. These allegations satisfy Rule 9(b)'s requirement to plead fraud
with particularity.
3. RICO Claims Based on Domestic Disputes
Branthoover argues that the plaintiff's allegations arise primarily from a
domestic dispute and related family court proceedings, which should not be
transformed into a RICO claim. While courts have indeed been skeptical of
RICO claims arising solely from domestic disputes, the plaintiff's allegations
go beyond a mere domestic disagreement to allege a coordinated scheme
involving:
Interstate travel and commerce

• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 

=== PAGE 12 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Strategic coordination between multiple parties
Financial crimes including wire fraud
Manipulation of multiple court proceedings
Substantial business injuries
According to the secondary source, "civil RICO claims are not limited to
conduct traditionally associated with organized crime, but they certainly are
not meant to apply to ordinary business disputes." The question here is
whether the allegations rise above an "ordinary" domestic dispute. The
plaintiff has alleged specific predicate acts (wire fraud and Travel Act
violations) that would be criminal regardless of whether they occurred in a
domestic context. This may distinguish this case from those in which courts
have rejected attempts to "shoehorn ordinary business or contractual
disputes into a civil RICO claim."
4. Venue
Branthoover challenges venue in the Western District of Oklahoma, arguing
that the events primarily occurred in Texas. However, 18 U.S.C. § 1965(a)
establishes that RICO actions may be instituted "in the district court of the
United States for any district in which such person resides, is found, has an
agent, or transacts his affairs."
Venue is proper in the Western District of Oklahoma because:
Branthoover resides in Canadian County, Oklahoma, which is within the
Western District
Substantial parts of the events allegedly occurred in Oklahoma,
including:
Preparation of allegedly fraudulent court documents at
Branthoover's residence
Myers' alleged interstate travel to Oklahoma to coordinate the
scheme
Receipt of the allegedly fraudulently transferred funds in
Oklahoma
These connections establish proper venue in the Western District of
Oklahoma under 18 U.S.C. § 1965(a).
5. Unauthorized Practice of Law and Continuing Conduct
The plaintiff has also pointed to Branthoover's conduct during the litigation
as further evidence supporting the RICO claims. Specifically, the plaintiff
alleges that Branthoover initially attempted to file his motion on behalf of
both defendants, but later altered the document after being challenged. This
could potentially provide further evidence of the alleged pattern of deceitful
conduct and may support the plaintiff's claims regarding the continuing
nature of the alleged conspiracy.

Exceptions and Caveats
While the plaintiff's claims appear to meet the pleading requirements to
survive a motion to dismiss, several factors could still affect the ultimate
outcome:
Burden of Proof: At later stages, the plaintiff will face a higher burden
of proof to establish each element of the RICO claim with evidence.
Limited Case Law on Domestic RICO Claims: There is limited case
law addressing RICO claims in the context of domestic disputes, and
courts may be reluctant to extend RICO to what might be characterized
as a family law matter.
Federal Court Jurisdiction: Federal courts generally avoid
entanglement in domestic relations cases, which are typically the
province of state courts. The court may scrutinize whether this case
genuinely presents a federal question distinct from the underlying
domestic dispute.
Joint Account Transfer: The defendant has argued that transfers
between spouses from joint accounts do not constitute fraud. While the
plaintiff has alleged deceptive intent behind the transfer, this aspect
may require further factual development.
Conclusion
Based on the available materials, the plaintiff appears to have sufficiently
alleged all elements required for a civil RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. §
1962(c) and conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d) to survive a motion to
dismiss. The complaint contains detailed allegations of:
Predicate acts of wire fraud and Travel Act violations, pleaded with the
particularity required by Rule 9(b)
A pattern of racketeering activity demonstrating both relatedness and
continuity
An association-in-fact enterprise with distinct roles and structure
Concrete injuries to business and property as required for standing
under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c)
Proper venue in the Western District of Oklahoma under 18 U.S.C. §
1965(a)
According to "Defending Civil RICO Claims: A Defense Plan Should Be In
Every Business's Arsenal", "to bring a civil RICO claim, a plaintiff must
demonstrate that their business or property was injured as a result of a
RICO violation." The plaintiff here has alleged specific financial losses from
both the direct transfer of funds and the disruption to his business
operations, which appear to satisfy this requirement.
While the court may still have concerns about applying RICO in what
originated as a domestic dispute, the plaintiff's detailed allegations of

interstate wire fraud and Travel Act violations, coupled with concrete
business injuries, make this more than a typical domestic relations case. The
defendant's motion to dismiss should therefore be denied, allowing the case
to proceed to discovery where the factual basis for these allegations can be
more fully developed and tested.
Legal Authorities
18 U.S.C. § 1965 18 U.S.C. § 1965 Venue and Process
Extract
Any civil action or proceeding under this chapter against any person may be
instituted in the district court of the United States for any district in which
such person resides, is found, has an agent, or transacts his affairs.
Summary
The venue for a RICO action can be established in any district where the
defendant resides, is found, has an agent, or transacts affairs. This is
relevant to the case because it addresses the defendants' argument
regarding improper venue. Since Branthoover resides in the Western
District of Oklahoma, the venue is proper under 18 U.S.C. § 1965.
Defending Civil RICO Claims: A Defense Plan Should Be In Every Business's
Arsenal
Extract
Civil RICO claims are not limited to conduct traditionally associated with
organized crime, but they certainly are not meant to apply to ordinary
business disputes. While there are a number of defenses available as to each
of the four types of civil RICO claims, there are several RICO defenses that
should be in every business's playbook. First, to bring a civil RICO claim, a
plaintiff must demonstrate that their business or property was injured as a
result of a RICO violation. In other words, there must be some sort of
concrete financial loss directly flowing from the purported violation to
support a RICO claim. Thus, if a plaintiff does not have a concrete financial
loss, then the RICO claim must be dismissed. Asserting personal injuries,
such as emotion distress, is insufficient. Second, to prove most types of
RICO claims, the plaintiff must plead that the defendant committed some
qualifying criminal action, the most common of which is mail, wire or
securities fraud. Business deals gone sour do not count. Rather, the plaintiff
must be able to prove the elements of the asserted crime, and often an
intent to defraud. If there is nothing criminal in nature about the
complained-of conduct, RICO should not apply. It is an abuse of the RICO
statute to attempt to shoehorn ordinary business or contractual disputes
into a civil RICO claim. Third, the plaintiff must plead a pattern of
racketeering activity for most RICO claims. If the alleged conduct occurred

=== PAGE 15 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
once or twice, or was not continuous, it cannot form a pattern of conduct
sufficient to support a RICO claim. And oftentimes, because there is a fraud
component, those instances must be particularly identified in the plaintiff's
pleading—a barrier that can prove difficult to accomplish.
Summary
Requirements for a civil RICO claim, emphasizing the need for concrete
financial loss, qualifying criminal action, and a pattern of racketeering
activity. It highlights that RICO claims are not meant for ordinary disputes
and require specific elements to be proven. This information is generally
applicable to any case involving RICO claims, including the case of Charles
Dustin Myers v. Daniel Kenneth Branthoover and Morgan Michelle Myers.
