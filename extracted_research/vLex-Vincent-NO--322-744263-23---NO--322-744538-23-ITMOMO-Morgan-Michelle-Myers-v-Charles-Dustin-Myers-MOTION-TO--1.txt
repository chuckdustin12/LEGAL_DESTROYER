v Charles Dustin Myers MOTION TO DISMISS FOR WANT OF
PROSECUTION In the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County, Texas
Honorable Judges: James B. Munford, Jeff Kaitcer 200 E. Weatherford St. 4th
Floor Fort Worth, TX Tel.: (817) 884-1427 Respectfully submitted by:
Charles Dustin Myers, Respondent 322-744263-23 FILED TARRANT
COUNTY 1/24/2025 8:29 PM THOMAS A. WILDER DISTRICT CLERK
SUMMARY Respondent, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, respectfully submits
this Motion to Dismiss for Want of Prosecution and in support thereof states
as follows: 1. The Supreme Court of Texas, through its promulgated time
standards, provides clear guidelines for the timely disposition of cases,
including dissolution of marriage. 2. The proposed time standards are based
on national studies, including those conducted by the ABA and the NCSC,
which establish a 12-month maximum time frame for divorce cases as
achievable and reasonable, with intermediate standards for temporary
orders, responsive pleadings, and trials. 3. In this case, the time standards
have been exceeded, with no substantial progress toward resolution or final
disposition. 4. Rule 165a (2) of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure permits
the dismissal of cases that are not disposed of within the prescribed time
standards, ensuring the proper administration of justice and preventing
undue delays caused by party inaction. FACTS SUPPORTING DISMISSAL 5.
Notwithstanding the above, the Petitioner’s Original Petition for Divorce in
this matter and all subsequent pleadings submitted to the court bearing her
signature should be stricken from the record because they are
fundamentally fraudulent, and given the circumstances of the case, the
Petitioner cannot prevail at trial, and granting a divorce under the current
circumstances would prove detrimental to the Respondent, and the children.
6. The Petitioner’s submissions include an affidavit of inability to pay, an
original divorce petition, and a protective order. These documents were
leveraged to secure the current temporary orders which claim to be agreed
despite lacking the Respondent’s signature and were prepared by an
attorney not authorized to represent the Petitioner. 7. The Respondent has
raised claims of fraud, perjury, deception, and child neglect against the
Petitioner, and her counsel has failed to address, defend, or file any response
regarding these claims. 8. The Respondent has submitted discovery and
admissions which have not been responded to by the opposing party, and
despite filing a motel to compel discovery, no action has been taken by the
court. 9. The opposing counsel’s authority has been under challenge
pursuant to Rule 12 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure since September
20th, 2024, yet she was permitted to attend the recusal hearing and raise
objections despite no indication of her position on the motion prior to the
hearing. 10. The opposing counsel is unable to file anything on her client’s
behalf in this matter because her electronic filing manager account is
registered under her former employer’s email. 11. The opposing counsel has
not filed any documents on her client’s behalf in this matter but has rather
had individuals unrelated to the case file documents for her on her behalf.
12. The opposing counsel is unable to file the required notice of remand with
the clerk of the court, and the case is unable to proceed given these

circumstances. FURTHER STATUTORY PROVISIONS WARRANTING
DISMISSAL Respondent, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, asserts that the
Petitioner has violated Sec. 12.002 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies
Code. Specifically: 13. Petitioner knowingly made and presented fraudulent
claims to the Court regarding Respondent's property, with the intent to
deprive him of his interest in his home, a property essential for his ability to
work and provide for the children. 14. Petitioner acted with the intent that
these false claims be given the same legal effect as valid court orders,
misleading the Court and causing Respondent to be wrongfully deprived of
his home and livelihood. 15. The Respondent, as the person directly affected
by this fraudulent conduct, reserves the right to bring a cause of action
under Sec. 12.003(a)(8) as an equal owner to the community property
impacted by the Petitioner’s fraudulent claims. 16. Petitioner’s actions have
caused significant harm, including: 1. Financial injury resulting from the loss
of property and work opportunities. 2. Mental anguish and emotional
distress caused by being deprived of his home and stability. 17. Given the
Petitioner is unable to account for the damages she has caused, the court
should impose the appropriate sanctions for the following reasons: i. For
signing multiple fraudulent documents which she knew to be false, including
the affidavit of inability to pay and original petition for divorce filed
December 18, 2023, the Application for Protective Order filed December 22,
2023, and the current temporary orders prepared by her current
unauthorized attorney, which should be stricken from the docket pursuant to
Rule 12 given that they are not agreed. ii. For failing to take her court-
ordered parenting class, which permits the court to issue an appropriate
sanction pursuant to Tex. Fam. Code § 105.009(g). iii. For putting her own
selfish agenda before her own children’s future and emotional stability ,
disregarding them entirely iv. For any other actions or inaction taken by the
Petitioner in this matter. CONCLUSION AND PRAYER 18. In conclusion, this
case should be dismissed as a matter of law. It has yet to be adjudicated
fairly in over a year, exceeding the Texas Supreme Court guidelines. It
further was founded on fraud, including an affidavit of inability to pay,
making the case dismissible pursuant to the Tex. Prac. Rem. Code Sec.
13.001. Finally, given the fundamentally flawed decisions made in this case
in regard to the children – the current situation damages their well-being,
and a re-assessment of the facts are needed for the court to properly
adjudicate this matter. Therefore, the respondent respectfully requests that
this honorable court: i. Dismiss this case without prejudice and impose the
appropriate sanctions on the Petitioner. ii. Adopt the emergency temporary
orders filed by the Respondent in September of 2024 which reflect the
reality of the current situation and preserves the status quo of the children
in accordance with Texas law. iii. Provide clear, written instructions in the
dismissal order permitting the Respondent to return to 6641 Anne Court,
Watauga, TX giving the Petitioner the choice to either co-habitat or live next-
door while the Respondent repairs the significant damage caused by her
actions. iv. Give the Respondent sole managing custody of the children and
exclusive use of the residency while the case is pending. v. Require that the
Petitioner provide the documents requested that will allow the court to
establish child support payments for the children and require that the
Petitioner make these payments to aid in the rebuilding process for the
Children. vi. Require a response to be filed by the opposing party within the
next ten days. vii. Provide any further relief that the court finds just and

equitable given the unusual circumstances of this matter. Respectfully

Wilder, District Clerk Tarrant County District Courts 200 E. Weatherford St.
Fort Worth, Texas 76196 Re: Original Petition in Suit Affecting Parent-Child
Relationship (“SAPCR”) – Request to File as Separate Case and Set
Immediate Hearing (In the Interest of [M.M.] and [C.M.], minor children;
related to Cause No. 322-744263-23, In re Marriage of Myers) Dear Mr.
Wilder and Honorable Court: Please accept for filing the enclosed Original
SAPCR concerning the above-referenced children. This SAPCR is
intentionally filed as a new, separate case, rather than under the existing
divorce cause, due to unique procedural defects in that divorce proceeding
that have left the children in legal and physical limbo. Immediate
intervention is required to protect the children’s best interests. Below, I
outline the compelling reasons – supported by law and the record – why this
SAPCR must proceed separately and be set for an emergency hearing at
once, instead of being merged into the stalled divorce case. A. Failure of
Opposing Party to Prosecute 1. The divorce Petitioner has wholly failed to
prosecute the divorce, leaving it in procedural limbo. Over a year has passed
with no meaningful activity toward a final resolution. Notably, after the
divorce case was removed to federal court and later remanded, Petitioner
never filed the required certified Order of Remand or gave notice of remand
as mandated by Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 237a. Rule 237a obligates the
removing party to promptly file the federal remand order with the state
clerk and notify all parties, after which any defendant has 15 days to answer.
Petitioner’s omission of this required step has left the state court record
incomplete and the case procedurally suspended. Indeed, due to Petitioner’s
inaction (and her counsel’s apparent inability to e-file; see Point 8 below), no
remand notice was ever filed, so the divorce court has not resumed
jurisdiction in any practical sense. 2. In addition, Petitioner has ignored the
Texas Supreme Court’s time standards for timely disposition of cases. A
divorce case is expected to be resolved within 12 months, yet Petitioner has

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
made no effort to advance it. She has not set a trial or even a status
conference; she has allowed critical deadlines to lapse. This lack of diligence
violates the duty to prosecute one’s claims and warrants dismissal for want
of prosecution. In fact, Respondent has been forced to file a Motion to
Dismiss for Want of Prosecution (pending before the Court) detailing
Petitioner’s complete failure to move the case forward. This also remains un-
responded to. Petitioner’s inaction has left the family with no active forum to
address urgent child-related issues. Therefore, a separate SAPCR is
necessary to provide a functioning vehicle for relief. The children cannot
wait for the Petitioner’s indifference or strategic delay to abate. B. Failure to
Oppose Any Relief (Legal Concession) 3. Throughout the divorce case,
Petitioner has not opposed or responded to any of Respondent’s filings,
motions, or claims for relief. She and her counsel have remained silent in the
face of serious allegations and requests, effectively conceding the merits of
those issues under Texas law. Respondent has raised grave claims of fraud,
perjury, deception, and child neglect against Petitioner in his pleadings, yet
Petitioner’s counsel has filed no response or defense to these claims.
Respondent also served discovery and Requests for Admissions which went
completely unanswered, resulting in deemed admissions. He even filed a
motion to compel discovery, which Petitioner again did not oppose, though
unfortunately no hearing has yet been held. Moreover, when Respondent
moved for other interim relief (including return to the family home and
expanded access to the children), Petitioner filed no opposition. By her
inaction, Petitioner has implicitly admitted the validity of Respondent’s
factual assertions and the justness of his requests. 4. Texas law is clear that
a party who fails to respond to motions or claims effectively waives any
objection and accepts the movant’s evidence as true. For example, in the
summary judgment context, if a nonmovant files no response, the court may
accept the movant’s asserted facts as uncontroverted and render judgment
if entitlement is shown; issues not timely raised in a written response are
waived; see Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(c). The same principle applies here:
Petitioner’s total failure to contest Respondent’s filings is tantamount to a
legal concession of those matters. In other words, failure to make timely and
specific objections results in waiver of the objections. See Clark v. Trailways,
Inc., 774 S.W.2d 644, 647 (Tex. 1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1074, 110 S.Ct.
1122, 107 L.Ed.2d 1028 (1990); Hartford Accident and Indem. Co. v.
McCardell, 369 S.W.2d 331, 335 (Tex. 1963); Srite v. Owens-Illinois, Inc., 870
S.W.2d 556, 565 (Tex.App. — Houston [1st Dist.] 1993), revised on other
grounds, 897 S.W.2d 765). Courts have recognized that a party’s failure to
respond indicates a belief that the motion has merit. 5. Petitioner’s silence
speaks volumes. She has never disputed that Respondent should be allowed
to return home or see his children – in fact, she has not opposed any relief
requested. This silence should be treated as acquiescence. Accordingly,
there is no reason to keep the children waiting in the paralytic divorce case
when no one is even arguing against the relief Respondent seeks in this
SAPCR. The SAPCR can and should proceed on the uncontroverted facts in
Respondent’s filings. C. Best Interests of the Children Demand Immediate
Action 6. Every day that passes with the children separated from their father
is a day of irreparable harm. The undisputed evidence is that the children
are suffering due to Respondent’s forced absence from the home. In the
months since he was excluded, the children’s well-being has precipitously
declined: they have fallen behind in school, missed critical medical and

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
dental appointments, and have been emotionally traumatized by the sudden
and prolonged separation from their father. No party—not even Petitioner—
has asserted that the children would be anything but better off if their father
could return to care for them. No one has argued against Respondent’s
return to the home or his involvement in the children’s daily life. It is
axiomatic that the best interest of the children is the paramount concern in
any case affecting the parentchild relationship. See Tex. Fam. Code §
153.002 (mandating that “[t]he best interest of the child shall always be the
primary consideration of the court in determining the issues of
conservatorship and possession of and access to the child”); Lenz v. Lenz, 79
S.W.3d 10, 14 (Tex. 2002) (emphasizing that courts must place “predominant
emphasis” on what best serves the children's welfare, particularly focusing
on stability, emotional and educational needs, and maintaining frequent
contact with fit parents). 7. The Texas Legislature explicitly prioritized
children’s best interests in all conservatorship and possession
determinations: “The best interest of the child shall always be the primary
consideration of the court in determining the issues of conservatorship and
possession of and access to the child.” Tex. Fam. Code § 153.002. Texas
Supreme Court jurisprudence confirms and expands upon this legislative
directive, instructing courts to consider stability, educational continuity,
emotional health, and ongoing relationships with fit parents in their best-
interest analysis. See Lenz, 79 S.W.3d at 14–15 (holding courts must
evaluate what will best serve the child’s overall welfare, ensuring a stable
and emotionally supportive environment and maintaining meaningful and
frequent parental contact). 8. Here, it is unquestionably in the children's
best interests to have their loving father back in their daily lives without
further delay. Texas public policy explicitly states that children should have
frequent and continuing contact with parents who have demonstrated the
ability to act in their best interest. See Tex. Fam. Code § 153.001(a)
(declaring the public policy of Texas to ensure frequent contact and shared
duties between parents and children following separation); Lenz, 79 S.W.3d
at 14–15 (affirming that Texas policy favors maintaining frequent and
meaningful parental involvement in a child's life). 9. Respondent has
demonstrated throughout these proceedings that he is a caring, fit parent
whose presence provides the children with stability, support for their
education and health, and emotional security. By contrast, the children’s
current situation—living apart from Respondent for no substantiated reason
—is destabilizing and harmful. Texas courts recognize the urgency of child
custody matters and have repeatedly underscored that “justice demands a
speedy resolution of child custody and child support issues.” In re Tex. Dep’t
of Fam. & Protective Servs., 210 S.W.3d 609, 613 (Tex. 2006) (orig.
proceeding) (quoting Proffer v. Yates, 734 S.W.2d 673, 674 (Tex. 1987)).
Simply put, the children’s needs cannot wait on procedural formalities or a
dormant divorce case. Their welfare requires this SAPCR to be heard
immediately so that orders can be promptly put in place to reunite them
with their father and address their academic, emotional, and medical needs.
No statute or rule forbids initiating a separate SAPCR when it is necessary
to protect children's best interests. Indeed, Tex. Fam. Code § 153.002 and
the overarching equitable duty of the Court compel swift action here.
Respondent is ready, willing, and able to resume caring for his children, and
no party has objected to him doing so. Therefore, the Court must accept this
SAPCR and schedule an immediate hearing to serve the children's best

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
interests without further delay. See Lenz, 79 S.W.3d at 14–15 (holding courts
must prioritize swift judicial actions in custody matters, protecting the best
interests of children). D. Fraud and Perjury Render the Prior Orders Void 10.
The orders entered in the divorce case that currently keep Respondent out
of the home and away from the children were obtained through fraud,
misrepresentation, and even perjury. Because those orders were procured
by wrongful means, they are void ab initio and cannot be permitted to stand
in the way of this SAPCR. Texas law does not tolerate court orders obtained
by trickery or false pretenses. Notably, the temporary orders in the divorce
(signed January 16, 2024 and later on March 14, 2024) were presented to
the Court as “agreed” orders, yet Respondent never agreed to them and
never signed them. In fact, Respondent had expressly opposed the relief in
those orders. The “agreement” was a fiction created by Petitioner’s counsel.
The record reflects that Petitioner’s counsel drafted and submitted those
orders without Respondent’s consent or signature, and which reference a
hearing not found on the docket. This is a textbook example of a fraud on
the court. A judgment or order entered as “agreed” when one party actually
objected is void. The Texas Supreme Court’s holding in Burnaman v. Heaton
is directly on point: when a trial court knows a party does not consent to a
purported agreed judgment, it must refuse to sign it; any judgment rendered
under such circumstances “is void.” Burnaman v. Heaton, 240 S.W.2d 288,
291 (Tex. 1951). 11. Here, the court was misled – it was never disclosed that
Respondent vehemently disagreed. Without such consent the judgment is
void. The law will not give effect to a “party’s consent” that was never
actually given. Moreover, the way those orders were obtained was rife with
material falsehoods. In her filings, Petitioner knowingly made false
statements to the Court to justify excluding Respondent from the home. For
example, in her Application for Protective Order and supporting affidavit,
Petitioner grossly misrepresented the facts, painting Respondent as a
danger without evidence. She alleged incidents that never occurred or
twisted mundane events into false claims of “family violence.” These
misrepresentations were later exposed, and Petitioner has never attempted
to prove them in any evidentiary hearing. Petitioner’s intent was plainly to
deceive the Court into granting her sole occupancy of the home and custody
of the children. Indeed, Respondent’s pending Motion to Dismiss details how
Petitioner “knowingly made and presented fraudulent claims to the Court
regarding Respondent’s property, with the intent to deprive him of his
interest in his home”, and how she acted with intent that “these false claims
be given the same legal effect as valid court orders, misleading the Court
and causing Respondent to be wrongfully deprived of his home and
livelihood.” 12. These strong findings, which stand uncontroverted, show
that the prior orders were procured by fraud and deception. Under
longstanding Texas precedent, any order obtained by extrinsic fraud (fraud
that effectively prevents a fair presentation of the case) is void and a nullity.
See King Ranch, Inc. v. Chapman, 118 S.W.3d 742, 751–52 (Tex. 2003)
(judgment obtained by fraud can be set aside; only extrinsic fraud – such as
keeping a party away from court or concealing critical facts – justifies relief).
13. Here, Petitioner’s fraud was extrinsic in that it kept Respondent from
participating fully (the “agreed” order ploy) and kept the Court from
learning the true facts. A litigant who lies to gain advantage in a court order
subverts the process; the resulting order lacks integrity and is void. 14. In
sum, the prior temporary orders that ousted Respondent were built on a

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
foundation of fraud. They should carry no weight and pose no obstacle to
granting relief in this new SAPCR. This Court not only has the authority to
declare such orders void, it has a duty to do so in order to prevent manifest
injusticec. See Burnaman, 240 S.W.2d at 291. By proceeding with a fresh
SAPCR, the Court can consider the issues regarding the children de novo, on
truthful evidence, untainted by the false premises of the earlier orders.
Equity regards as done that which ought to have been done – the Court
should restore Respondent, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, (Petitioner in the
new cause) to his rightful place in the home and children’s lives, as if the
fraudulent orders had never been entered. E. Restoring the True Status Quo
of the Family 15. Relief in this SAPCR is also warranted to restore the status
quo that existed before Petitioner’s improper actions. The “last actual,
peaceable status quo” in this family was Respondent living in the home with
the children, as a present and active father. That was the reality until late
2023, when Petitioner – through unilateral false allegations – removed
Respondent from the household. Texas law holds that the purpose of
temporary orders and injunctive relief is to maintain or restore the status
quo pending trial. See In re Shifflet, 462 S.W.3d 528, 537 (Tex. App.—
Houston [1st Dist.] 2015, orig. proceeding) (courts aim to restore the last
peaceable status quo pending final trial). 16. Here, the true status quo ante
was the intact family unit with Respondent present. The situation now –
Respondent barred from the home and children – is a drastic deviation from
that status quo, achieved only by contested court orders that, as shown, lack
validity. Every day that Respondent is kept out is a day the family’s natural
equilibrium is disturbed further. Texas courts have intervened in analogous
situations to return to the rightful status quo. For example, when one party’s
unilateral conduct disrupts a long-standing living arrangement, courts
recognize that stability must be restored for the benefit of all, especially the
children. See Smith v. McDaniel, 842 S.W.2d 7, 12 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1992,
no writ) (courts should preserve or restore the conditions that existed prior
to the controversy to protect the children’s routine and sense of security).
Here, restoring the status quo means allowing Respondent back into his
home and parenting role immediately. That was the “last peaceable”
situation before litigation – a state in which the children were thriving.
Notably, the findings in the temporary orders hearing (held without
Respondent) even indicate there were no findings of any imminent harm if
Respondent were present; the exclusion was based solely on Petitioner’s
requested relief, not on proven misconduct by Respondent. 17. Thus, there
is no safety-based reason to maintain the current deviation from the norm.
By contrast, there are powerful reasons to return to normalcy: the children’s
suffering would be alleviated, and the family’s balance and stability would
be reestablished. 18. In short, equity demands that we “undo” the improper
disruption caused by Petitioner’s actions. This SAPCR allows the Court to do
exactly that – to realign temporary orders with reality and justice. In re
Shifflet instructs that the last peaceable status quo should be restored
pending trial. The last peaceable status was Respondent in the home;
restoring that will harm no one (again, even Petitioner did not claim any
abuse or violence requiring exclusion – her application acknowledged no
recent violence, only vague fears). Maintaining the current situation, by
contrast, gravely harms the children and prejudices Respondent’s
relationship with them. Therefore, the Court should use the SAPCR
proceeding to immediately reinstate Respondent to the home and his

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
parenting time, thereby restoring the status quo that truly serves the
children’s welfare. Every additional day away from that status quo is a
deviation that this Court can and should correct now. F. The Court’s Duty to
Act Without Delay for the Children’s Welfare 19. By accepting this SAPCR as
a separate case, the Court can fulfill its paramount duty to protect the
children’s welfare without procedural delay. Courts have a sacred obligation
to put the interests of children above rigid procedural considerations,
especially in emergencies. The Texas Supreme Court has emphasized that
trial courts must act immediately when children’s physical or emotional
well-being is at stake, even if procedural complexities exist. In In re Tex.
Department of Family & Protective Services, for example, the Supreme
Court admonished that delays in custody matters are intolerable, quoting
with approval the maxim: “Justice demands a speedy resolution of child
custody and child support issues.” 210 S.W.3d 609, 613 (Tex. 2006). The
high court in that case (a mandamus proceeding) required prompt action
despite procedural entanglements, recognizing that a child’s need for a
stable, safe environment cannot be made to wait on protracted litigation
maneuvers. 20. Similarly, in Elizondo v. Monteleone, an appellate court
noted that when a parent attempted procedural gambits to delay a custody
determination, the court system should not allow those tactics to trump the
child’s immediate needs. Elizondo v. Monteleone, 96 S.W.3d 705, 708 (Tex.
App.—Corpus Christi 2002, no pet.) (courts will not permit jurisdictional
technicalities to delay emergency relief in a parent-child case). [(If citation is
verified)] In that case, one party tried to remove the case to federal court
and argued that the state court lacked jurisdiction to issue temporary orders
during the interim. The court flatly rejected that ploy, holding that the state
court must act to protect the child and could later sort out jurisdiction,
because the child’s welfare was paramount. The lesson is clear: procedural
fencing cannot override the need for immediate judicial action when
children are suffering. 21. Here, Petitioner’s inaction and the snares of the
divorce case have already delayed relief for far too long. The children have
been without their father for several critical months of their development.
The Court has the power—and indeed the duty—to cut through the
procedural morass by creating a new SAPCR docket and promptly
addressing the merits of conservatorship, possession, and access. There is
no jurisdictional barrier to doing so: this Court has continuing jurisdiction
over the children (by virtue of the ongoing divorce) and thus can hear a
SAPCR involving them. Any concern about duplicitous litigation is mitigated
by the fact that the divorce case is effectively moribund; furthermore,
Respondent will move to consolidate or dismiss the divorce once the SAPCR
is in place, if appropriate. What cannot be allowed is more delay that leaves
the children in a fractured situation. Our Courts are courts of equity as well
as law, especially in family matters. When equity demands immediate
intervention, the Court should not hesitate. As the Austin Court of Appeals
observed, “when the jurisdiction of the court has been properly invoked in
matters affecting minor children, the court’s primary consideration is the
best interest of the children, and the court may enter any order deemed
necessary to protect and conserve the welfare of the child.” Elizondo, 96
S.W.3d at 708 (citing Tex. Fam. Code § 105.001 on temporary orders for a
child). In other words, once the Court is aware of a child in need, it must act,
and act swiftly. 22. That is precisely the situation here. By accepting this
SAPCR filing and setting an immediate hearing, the Court will be performing

=== PAGE 9 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
its highest duty: safeguarding the children’s wellbeing without further
procedural impediment. Conversely, to refuse the SAPCR or to delay action
because a defunct divorce petition lingers would elevate form over
substance and place the children at continued risk, which Texas law forbids.
23. In sum, this Court is empowered and required to provide a forum for
immediate relief, and the SAPCR is the proper mechanism to do so. The
Court should therefore promptly docket this SAPCR as a new case and
schedule an emergency hearing on temporary orders for the children. G.
Protective-Order Application Confirms Respondent’s Joint Ownership of the
Home 24. Even Petitioner’s own filings acknowledge Respondent’s legal
right to return to the residence. In her sworn Application for Protective
Order (filed in September 2023), Petitioner explicitly affirmed that the
marital residence “is jointly owned or leased by the Applicant and
Respondent.” 25. This judicial admission is significant. It means that at the
time she sought exclusive use of the home, Petitioner conceded that
Respondent is co-owner (or co-leaseholder) of the property. There is no
dispute, therefore, that Respondent has an equal property interest and legal
right to occupy the home. Petitioner cannot now contradict her own sworn
statement by suggesting Respondent has no such right. 26. Why is this
important? Because the prior orders granting Petitioner exclusive
possession of the home (and excluding Respondent) stand in direct conflict
with the parties’ property rights and the status quo. Those orders were
based not on any finding that Respondent lacked ownership or rights to the
home, but presumably on a temporary need for protection (which, as shown,
was falsely claimed). With the exposure of Petitioner’s allegations as false,
there remains no lawful basis to keep Respondent out of a home that he
owns jointly. Texas Family Code § 153.003 states that the Court cannot
condition a parent’s possession of a child on the payment of support or other
matters unrelated to the child – likewise, the Court should not condition
Respondent’s access to his home (and thereby to his children) on a
procedurally flawed prior order, especially when Petitioner herself admits
the home is community property. The protective order application further
underscores that Petitioner’s sole claim to the home was through a
temporary court order, not any independent right. When the predicate for
that temporary order (alleged family violence) is unproven and disputed, the
underlying property rights must prevail. 27. In equity, where two parties
have equal right to possession of a property, one cannot exclude the other
absent a valid court order supported by good cause. Here, absent the
nowquestionable temporary orders, Respondent as joint owner would be
free to live in his home. The Court should thus give weight to Petitioner’s
admission of joint ownership and recognize Respondent’s unabated property
right. This is yet another reason to allow the SAPCR to go forward: so that
the issue of residency and possession of the home can be revisited in light of
the true facts and rights of the parties. The protective order was leveraged
into a settlement which both parties did not agree to (as the record will
show, if needed), meaning no long-term restrictions were found warranted.
What remains is a fit father who co-owns his home seeking to return to his
necessity to work and provide financially for the children. Petitioner’s own
pleadings remove any doubt about his entitlement. Accordingly, the Clerk
and Court should not hesitate to facilitate Respondent’s return via new
temporary orders in this SAPCR, as even Petitioner’s sworn statements
support Respondent’s position. H. Rule 12 Motion: Opposing Counsel Lacks

=== PAGE 10 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Authority, Undermining the Divorce Case Finally, Respondent has filed a
Rule 12 Motion (Motion to Show Authority) in the divorce case, which is
currently pending and further indicates why the existing case cannot
properly proceed. In that motion (filed September 20, 2024), Respondent
challenged the authority of Petitioner’s attorney of record to act on her
behalf. 28. This challenge was not made lightly – it is supported by evidence
that Petitioner’s counsel never filed the pleadings, is not authorized to
practice in this matter under her current registration, and may not even
have a valid engagement with Petitioner. Notably, since that motion was
filed, Petitioner’s counsel has failed to respond to it or otherwise prove her
authority. Rule 12 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure provides that an
attorney challenged by such a motion must appear and show authority to act
for the client, or else be struck from the case. Petitioner’s counsel has not
met this burden. Instead, irregularities have abounded: at a recent hearing
(on Respondent’s motion to recuse), Petitioner’s counsel appeared without
having answered the Rule 12 motion, and the Court allowed her to argue on
a motion she did not respond to, but her authority remains in question..
Moreover, it came to light that Petitioner’s counsel has been unable to e-file
pleadings on her client’s behalf because her electronic filing account is in
disarray (registered under a former employer’s email at Cantey Hanger yet
is signing pleadings for Marx, Altman, & Johnson) . In fact, the few
documents “filed” in the divorce case on Petitioner’s side were filed by
Roderick Marx, not by the attorney herself. And tellingly, Petitioner’s
counsel failed to file the Notice of Remand after the federal court sent the
case back, leaving the case hanging indefinitely. All of this demonstrates
that Petitioner’s counsel is effectively not acting with proper authority or
competence in the divorce matter. 29. This is critical because if Petitioner’s
attorney lacks authority, then Petitioner is essentially unrepresented in the
divorce. Her pleadings (including the Original Petition for Divorce) are
subject to being stricken as null if the Rule 12 motion is granted. The entire
divorce proceeding would be a nullity without an authorized petitioner or
counsel – which is another reason it has stagnated. It would be unjust to
make the children wait for months while this issue is sorted out. By contrast,
in a new SAPCR, Petitioner can secure proper counsel or proceed pro se, but
the Rule 12 quagmire in the divorce case can be sidestepped for now to get
the children relief. The pending Rule 12 motion underscores that the divorce
case is on unstable footing. It is procedurally snarled by questions of
representation. On the other hand, Respondent is ready to proceed in the
SAPCR immediately – he, as the petitioner in the SAPCR, obviously has
authority to bring it, and he will serve Petitioner directly. If Petitioner’s prior
counsel truly has no authority, Petitioner will have to either hire new counsel
or represent herself in responding to the SAPCR, but at least the case will
move forward. The Rule 12 fiasco in the divorce should not be allowed to
delay relief for the children. Equity again favors moving to a forum (the
SAPCR) where all parties before the Court are indisputably authorized and
the merits can be reached without distraction. 30. In summary on this point,
Respondent’s Rule 12 motion (which remains unanswered) indicates that the
opposing attorney “has no authority to act for the party” – a situation which,
by rule, would mandate striking her pleadings and possibly dismissing the
divorce. Rather than let the case devolve into that chaos (to the children’s
detriment), the Court should start fresh with this SAPCR. The integrity of
the proceedings will be ensured here, because all parties will be properly

=== PAGE 11 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
before the Court. Respondent is confident that once this SAPCR is active,
Petitioner will either appear on her own or with legitimate counsel and the
issues can finally be adjudicated on the merits. Until then, the divorce case
cannot be trusted as a vehicle for relief due to the cloud over Petitioner’s
representation. This factor strongly supports accepting the SAPCR as a
standalone action and granting the requested hearing and relief without
delay. I. Conclusion 31. For all the foregoing reasons – lack of prosecution in
the divorce, Petitioner’s waiver of opposition, the children’s urgent needs,
the void nature of prior orders, the necessity of restoring the status quo, and
procedural snares in the divorce case – Respondent respectfully urges the
Clerk to file the enclosed SAPCR as a new cause of action, and requests that
the Court set an immediate EX-PARTE hearing on temporary orders in this
SAPCR to issue injunctive relief immediately allowing access back into the
residency and children’s lives. The Court has abundant legal justification
and equitable grounds to do so. Most importantly, the children’s welfare
compels immediate action, and the Petitioner will not be adversely affected
by this decision, and has immediate housing options nearby available to her,
contrary to the undersigned. Every factor discussed above converges on one
truth: these children need their father back and need a stable, working court
order to govern their custody and care – and they need it now, not months
from now. By allowing this SAPCR to proceed separately, the Court will cut
the Gordian knot that the divorce case has become and will be able to issue
orders truly serving the children’s best interests forthwith. 32. Respondent
is prepared to appear for an emergency hearing on any date and time the
Court can accommodate – preferably today. He is also prepared to file any
additional supporting documents or evidence the Court may require. All
necessary filing fees for this SAPCR are being paid, and service of process
will be promptly effected on the opposing party. We ask only that the Clerk
accept this filing (rather than reject or re-route it to the old cause) and that
the Court immediately calendar the case for a hearing at the earliest
possible date. If there are any questions or if any further information is
needed to facilitate this request, Respondent is at the Court’s disposal to
provide it. 33. Thank you very much for your prompt attention to this urgent
matter. By taking swift action, the Clerk and Court will literally be changing
the lives of two children for the better. The law and justice are on the side of
moving forward with this SAPCR. Respondent implores the Court to do so
without delay. Respectfully submitted, Charles Dustin Myers 1 NOTICE THIS

Respondent in a systematic and concurrent fashion: a. Divorce:

Court, and County. Hon James B. Munford && Hon Jeffrey N. Kaitcer, 322nd
(Family) District Court, Tarrant County, Texas 3. Claim of Respondent: The
Court unlawfully removed the Respondent from his home without a right to
legal representation and without any findings of fact that would warrant
such a drastic decision which not only severely damaged the ability of the
Respondent to provide for them, but has ultimately left him homeless and
the children without one of their parents without conducting any discovery
or indicating any lawful reasoning for doing so. 4. Habeas Corpus N/A 5.

Saenz 9 ISSUES PRESENTED 1. Given evidence suggesting that the

=== PAGE 14 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Petitioner fabricated allegations of family violence to secure a tactical
advantage in custody and divorce proceedings, does this raise a significant
legal question regarding the adequacy of safeguards against misuse of
protective orders, potentially warranting a review of the court’s reliance on
unverified claims in making preliminary decisions affecting parental rights
and access to children? 2. Considering the absence of concrete evidence
indicating an immediate risk of harm or abuse towards the Petitioner or
minor children, did the Court’s initial decision to issue Temporary Orders on
January 16th , followed by January 22nd, and February 1st—thereby
excluding the Respondent from the family residence and severing his
relationship with his children—constitute an abuse of discretion lacking
clear evidence of danger for such emergency action, ultimately leading to a
violation of the Respondent’s due process and infringement of constitutional
and parental rights, while also disregarding the children’s best interests? 3.
How can the Court remove one parent from the home without following the
mandated process required by law, resulting in the destruction of the status
quo of the minor children, and further uphold this decision when no finding
of facts has taken place? A CERTIFIED COPY ATTEST: THOMAS A. WILDER

Saenz 10 FAMILY BACKGROUND I. Petitioner and Respondent are
referenced herein as the Couple. II. The two children are referenced herein
as the Children. 1. The Couple were married on June 20, 2015, and have two
daughters aged seven and five at the time of this Memorandum. 2. The
Couple moved into the residence located at 6641 Anne Court, Watauga TX,
76148 around July 2015. 3. The family home is adjacent to the Petitioner’s
grandparents, who are also the landlords of the Couple, where they entered
into a lease agreement on July 22nd, 2015. 4. The Couple have both played
significant roles in the upbringing of the Children throughout their lifetime.
5. The Couple are both actively involved in the children’s school activities
and extra-curriculars. 6. Throughout the marriage, the Petitioner reiterated
her strong desire to leave the family home and to escape the controlling
nature of her grandparents. 7. Throughout the marriage, the Children have
had continuous access to both parents throughout their lives up until court
intervention on January 16th, 2024. 8. Throughout the marriage, the Couple
have never endangered the Children. A CERTIFIED COPY ATTEST:
THOMAS A. WILDER DISTRICT CLERK TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS BY: /s/
04/15/2024 Catherine Saenz 11 EMPLOYMENT HISTORY AND FAMILY
DYNAMICS 1. Throughout their marriage, both parents have alternated
roles as stay-athome parents, adapting their employment status to meet the
developmental needs and schedules of their children, now aged seven and
five. This arrangement has enabled both the Petitioner and Respondent to
maintain an active and consistent presence in their children’s lives,
encompassing not only day-to-day care but also engagement in school
activities and extracurricular events. This hands-on approach has been a
testament to their dedication to the well-being and upbringing of their
children, demonstrating a flexible yet committed stance towards balancing
family responsibilities with personal and professional development
opportunities as they arise. 2. The Couple had lived paycheck to paycheck
for most of the marriage, and things began to look up when the Petitioner
acquired a job as a Leasing Agent/Consultant near our home. The Petitioner
excelled at this position, and the Respondent would take care of the children
from Sunrise to Sundown, in all aspects including medical appointments

=== PAGE 15 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
while the Petitioner would work outside of the family home. 3. The unique
situation the Couple had been blessed with put them in a situation where the
children could frequently visit their grandparents next door, creating a rare
and ideal situation for them, also enabling the Respondent to help generate
income by acquiring a part-time Legal A CERTIFIED COPY ATTEST:
THOMAS A. WILDER DISTRICT CLERK TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS BY: /s/
04/15/2024 Catherine Saenz 12 Transcriptionist job from home while the
children were in the care of the Grandparents. 4. During May of 2019, the
Petitioner was unexpectedly terminated from her job as a Leasing Agent,
where the Couple once more swapped roles as the stay-at-home parent, and
the Respondent quickly acquired employment at Classic Mazda of Denton,
starting on July 1st, 2019. 5. This transition was very difficult, as the
Respondent went from seeing his children every day to sometimes not at all
given the hour-long commute to work and extraneous hours and was in an
entirely new field of work as a sales associate. 6. In the Fall of 2019, the
COVID-19 pandemic hit and put the dealership in a state of uncertainty by
significantly reducing the number of patrons who would visit the dealership,
which impacted the monthly commission for the Respondent, creating
significant down-time that the Respondent took advantage of by self-
certifying himself in many areas of the dealership. 7. One evening at work,
the Respondent noticed the Photographer taking photos of the vehicles out
on the lot for the purpose of displaying them on the dealership’s website,
which sparked an idea that would ultimately A CERTIFIED COPY ATTEST:
THOMAS A. WILDER DISTRICT CLERK TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS BY: /s/
04/15/2024 Catherine Saenz 13 become the sales solution for the dealership
during the COVID-19 pandemic. 8. In November of 2019, the Respondent
created a YouTube channel entitled Charlie and the Mazdas, where he began
to use his selfcertification for internet sales to create personalized videos for
internet clients during the pandemic, allowing them to see the features of
their desired vehicle from the comfort of their own home. If the client
decided to move forward, the Respondent would wrap the steering wheels in
plastic wrap, wash the vehicles himself, and drive them to the client’s
residence as a courtesy service during the pandemic. 9. This approach was
not only successful but lead to the Respondent finishing second overall for
the Southwest Region of the United States for Mazda sales for the year of
2020. 10.The Couple also leased their first vehicle in November of 2019,
which was a Mazda CX-5 Grand Touring model, machine grey. 11.As the year
2020 unfolded, the Respondent found himself increasingly drawn to the
stock market. This interest was sparked by the extraordinary market
conditions of 2020, fueled by the Federal Reserve’s pivotal amendments to
Regulation D and the Supplemental Leverage Ratio. These changes were
instrumental in maintaining bank liquidity, enabling continued lending to
high-risk companies amid the pandemic, presenting unique investment
opportunities. A CERTIFIED COPY ATTEST: THOMAS A. WILDER DISTRICT
CLERK TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS BY: /s/ 04/15/2024 Catherine Saenz 14
12.By January 2021, inspired by his burgeoning passion for financial
markets—and motivated by a desire to reclaim precious time with the
Children—the Respondent made a conscientious decision to part ways with
the dealership. This step was taken in good faith, driven by his commitment
to both his family and his growing interest in financial markets, setting the
stage for a new chapter in his professional and personal life since his
employment began on July 1st, 2019. 13.Shortly after starting this new

=== PAGE 16 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
chapter, the Respondent quickly realized trading was going to be a lot more
challenging than he had first realized, which lead to the evolution of his
YouTube channel, renamed from Charlie and the Mazdas to Charlie’s Vids,
where he turned his focus to SEC law, covering agency filings out of the
Options Clearing Corporation, National Securities Clearing Corporation,
Depository Trust Company, Depository Trust Clearing Corporation, FINRA,
the Code of Federal Regulations, the Office of Financial Research, amongst
other market agencies. 14.The Respondent would cover the filings,
accompanied by PowerPoint presentations for the viewer, which quickly
became well-received, garnering the Respondent over 30,000 subscribers by
May of 2021. A CERTIFIED COPY ATTEST: THOMAS A. WILDER DISTRICT
CLERK TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS BY: /s/ 04/15/2024 Catherine Saenz 15
15.The surge in viewership not only augmented the family’s income but also
established a robust passive income stream for the Respondent and his
family. This financial uplift empowered him to delve further into the
intricacies of the financial sector, focusing on market architecture, the
mechanics of trading, and the analysis of market data. 16.By September
12th, 2021, his deepened interest in financial market data culminated in the
launch of a unique service. This innovative venture offered market data
solutions to clients through a variety of platforms including Discord and
Telegram, alongside tailored scanners, feeds, and bots. Leveraging
Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), sophisticated pythonic
programming, and advanced database engineering, the Respondent crafted
customizable data streams to meet the specific needs of his clientele, all self-
taught by the Respondent. 17.The escalating demands of the Respondent’s
business necessitated an upgrade to more potent computing hardware in
February 2022. This strategic investment enabled him to further scale his
operations, propelling the family towards financial independence. 18.Parallel
to the Respondent’s business ascent, the Petitioner took on a more
prominent role within their children’s educational community. Her
involvement with the school’s Parent Teacher Association (PTA) eventually
led her to the presidency, making a significant contribution to their
children’s educational environment. A CERTIFIED COPY ATTEST: THOMAS
A. WILDER DISTRICT CLERK TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS BY: /s/ 04/15/2024
Catherine Saenz 16 19.The culmination of these endeavors was celebrated
with the family’s first vacation in July 2022.5 They chose South Padre Island,
Texas—a place of sentimental value, as it was where the Respondent spent
many cherished moments of his childhood. Staying in the home that hosted
his formative years, they created new memories as a family, intertwining
past and present. 20.Throughout the remainder of the year and into 2023,
the couple continued in their respective roles, gradually drifting apart. The
Respondent, deeply engrossed in his business, and the Petitioner, yearning
for new experiences outside the home, unknowingly allowed a gap to form
between them, threatening the unity of their marriage. Despite this, their
commitment to their children’s welfare remained unwavering, a testament
to their dedication, as seen in the children’s thriving well-being and
exceptional achievements in school and dance. 21.In July of 2023, the family
took another trip to South Padre Island, a journey that served both to revisit
cherished memories and create new ones. 5 A CERTIFIED COPY ATTEST:

04/15/2024 Catherine Saenz 17 22.After the family vacation, the Respondent
started to expand his business into networking, necessitating a robust

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
internet connection. He needed to secure various services linked to his local
IP address and handle a large amount of data, making cloud storage or
hosting impractical for his needs due to the costs associated with it.
23.Around this same time, the Petitioner acquired a part-time job in the City
of Watauga, where she would work primarily evenings and on Saturdays,
frequently visiting the residence of her friends after work. 24.From the end
of July to mid-November 2023, the Respondent dedicated himself to
optimizing his setup. By November 24th, 2023, he launched his own web
service from home, elevating his client offerings by integrating marketing
efforts directly with his services, setting a new benchmark for his business
model. 25. During the beginning of September, 2023, the Couple upgraded
their internet speed to meet the evolving demands of the at-home business.6
26. Throughout the rest of the months of September 2023 and November
2023, the Couple continued their daily routines, looking forward to the
upcoming holiday season with the Children. 6 Petitioner excited and aware

of his lack of concern regarding the interests of the Respondent. 15.On
January 31st, 2024, Ms. Carter filed the First Amended Petition for Divorce.
Upon being notified of this document being filed via the e-file system, the
Respondent reached out to Mr. Bacalis via email to inquire about the

hearing. The case was settled under agreed orders. 9 The case was also
consolidated for a second time. None of the concerns were represented by
Mr. Bacalis, and the Protective Order continued to be used as leverage from
the Petitioner and Ms. Carter. 9 The stipulations set forth in these agreed

the Respondent filed a Notice / Unsworn Declaration with the court
informing them that he would not be leaving the family home for several
reasons, the most important being that it would not serve the children’s best

contained several errors such as incorrect addresses and altered dates. The
Respondent made these errors known to the opposing party on March 18 th,
2024. 10 The termination of Dan Bacalis was a necessary and strategic move

III. Undisputed Evidentiary Facts 1. The Petitioner, Morgan Michelle Myers,
knowingly and willingly deceived the Court under penalty of Perjury in the
following manner since the onset of the case: i. The Petitioner knowingly and
willingly filed for divorce claiming an Affidavit of Inability to Pay just four
days after emptying the Couple’s joint bank account into Dan Branthoover’s
PayPal account, where it was subsequently transferred to the Petitioner’s
sole bank account, as admitted by Mr. Branthoover himself on December
16th , 2023. ii. The Petitioner knowingly and willingly filed for an Emergency
EX-Parte Order of Protection on December 14th , 2023, yet was compelled to
invite the Respondent to the school field-trip, directly contradicting the need
for protection from the Respondent. iii. The Petitioner was under the
influence of Dan Branthoover, who stated his intent to help the Petitioner file
the divorce paperwork on December 16th, 2023, and after the divorce was
filed, referred to himself as her attorney while having no license to practice
law in Texas or any other state. A CERTIFIED COPY ATTEST: THOMAS A.
WILDER DISTRICT CLERK TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS BY: /s/ 04/15/2024
Catherine Saenz 26 iv. The Petitioner knowingly and willingly waived the 60-
day waiting period for divorce, citing that an active order of protection was
currently in place, and that family violence had been found to have occurred
during the Couple’s marriage. Neither of these statements were true, as the
Petitioner was denied such an order just four days prior. v. The Petitioner
knowingly and willingly influenced the Couple’s landlords into believing that
she needed protection, which was followed by the initiation of an Eviction
suit on Sunday, 12-17-2023 in which the Respondent prevailed on
01-17-2024 due to lack of jurisdiction. vi. The Petitioner filed for a Protective
Order on 12-22-2023, while subsequently cohabiting with the Respondent
and the Children that same evening clearly in no need of protection. vii. The
deliberate actions of the Petitioner and her family members reflect a
concerted effort that is both vindictive and predatory in nature, indicating a

=== PAGE 20 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
clear conspiracy to engage in unlawful conduct11 aimed at depriving the
Respondent of his parental rights, his ability to provide, and most
importantly: damaging the children’s well-being. 11 The Texas Family Law
Practice Manual points out a Civil Conspiracy as a valid cause of action for
divorce proceedings. See § 8.56, Ch.8 A CERTIFIED COPY ATTEST:
THOMAS A. WILDER DISTRICT CLERK TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS BY: /s/
04/15/2024 Catherine Saenz 27 2. The Court has, perhaps unintentionally,
endorsed the behavior detailed in paragraph 1 by failing to thoroughly
examine the case’s facts, despite their repeated emphasis throughout these
proceedings. 3. The opposing Counsel has not conducted any meaningful
discovery in this case to warrant any significant decisions which has
ultimately damaged the future outlook of the children by awarding full
custody to the Petitioner for no valid reason. The only discovery conducted
in this case amounts to financial disclosures which have since significantly
changed, as the Petitioner has changed employment, and the Respondent
has been unable to work to full capacity since March 6th, 2024. 4. The
Petitioner’s lack of full-time employment raises significant concerns
regarding their ability to meet the financial needs of the minor children
involved in this case. This issue casts doubt on the Court’s decision to grant
the Petitioner full custody and exclusive access to the family home. The
decision, which appears to have been made on subjective grounds,
preemptively removed the Respondent from the home before they had the
opportunity to secure legal representation. Such an action not only
adversely affects the welfare of the children but also constitutes a clear
misapplication of judicial discretion. 5. The Court and Opposing counsel
exhibit a strong conflict of interest, as the opposing Counsel had no initial
interest in the A CERTIFIED COPY ATTEST: THOMAS A. WILDER DISTRICT
CLERK TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS BY: /s/ 04/15/2024 Catherine Saenz 28
Divorce case, which is reflective in her failure to appropriately conduct
discovery or determine what is truly in the best interests of the children. 6.
The Respondent would care for the children while the Petitioner worked her
evening shifts multiple times per week. 7. The Respondent would care for
the children in all aspects of their lives leading up to his removal on January
16th, 2024, including while the Petitioner was out of the home filing for
protection against him. 12 8. Both the Respondent and opposing Counsel
have intentionally delayed proceedings and failed to provide any evidence,
witness lists, documents, or any other tangible items as required by both the
Local Court Rules and the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. 12 See

has had one objective throughout this case:
__________________________________________________ To prioritize the children’s
well-being and uphold the existing familial structure, while actively
promoting a healthy and ongoing relationship between the children and both
parents. This commitment is rooted in the understanding that the continued
involvement of both parents in the children’s daily lives is not only beneficial
but essential for their emotional and psychological development. The
Respondent seeks to ensure that the children’s interests are placed at the
forefront of all decisions, advocating for a stable and nurturing environment
that supports their growth and well-being, which is not the current
environment. __________________________________________________ TIMELINE13

TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS BY: /s/ 04/15/2024 Catherine Saenz 33 THE
RESPONDENT’S EFFORTS 1. Due to having failed legal representation, the
resources required to acquire alternative Counsel after the termination of
Mr. Bacalis coupled with the growing dis-trust of the Judicial System as a
whole given the totality of circumstances left the Respondent with having to
represent himself, which is a task he has taken seriously in an effort to
advocate for his daughters in a zealous manner. 2. The Respondent has
researched and is aware of the ever-growing burden pro-se litigants are
becoming on the Courts, their staff, and their resources due to the vast
majority of pro-se litigants not putting in the time or effort reasonably
required to represent themselves effectively or are solely trying to reduce
costs associated with their case, both leading to increased case lengths and
litigation costs. 3. The Respondent in this case stands out from the
stereotype as follows: a. Since the removal of his home on January 16th,
2024, the Respondent has self-developed software to assist himself in the

consistent throughout the proceedings by denying the false allegations of
family violence, pointing out the deception of the Petitioner, and how the
current situation does not reflect the best interests of the minor children
involved. c. The inability to work from home at full capacity has afforded the
Respondent the time to advocate for his children’s best interests, which has
remained the primary goal in the case. d. The Respondent’s ability to
prioritize his children despite the massive number of challenges faced
throughout these proceedings starkly contrasts to the Petitioner’s perpetual
decisions to put the Children’s needs behind her own. e. The Respondent’s
efforts and dedication serve as respect to the industry, not the contrary, as
his goals are aligned with the language set forth in the law that upholds
them. f. The Respondent has met with several of his business clients to
obtain sworn affidavits on his behalf to corroborate the necessity of his

ARGUMENT I. Best Interests of the Children 1. In the case concerning the
unjust removal of a father from his residence on January 16, 2024, without
prior notice, which abruptly ended his meaningful relationship with his
daughters and significantly impacted his livelihood due to his home-based
business operations, the Court notably failed to comply with the essential
legal principles set forth in Holley v. Adams, 544 S.W.2d 367 (Tex. 1976).
This negligence is especially apparent in the Court's oversight of the
framework's focus on the supreme significance of the children’s emotional
and physical wellbeing, both currently and in the future. 2. The decision in
Holley v. Adams, 544 S.W.2d 367 (Tex. 1976), emphasizes the importance of
conducting a comprehensive analysis that considers an extensive range of
considerations—including the children's emotional and physical needs,
potential risks to their safety, and the caregiving capabilities of the parties
seeking custody—to determine the child's best interest. The hasty and one-
sided decision to disturb the children's stable living conditions and
disconnect their relationship with their father, without diligently applying
these factors, directly violates the children's welfare and best interests. 4. It

=== PAGE 23 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
is essential to highlight that the Court’s neglect in evaluating the profound
implications on the children’s emotional well-being, by placing them in a
setting where their relational ties with their father are not only
unencouraged but actively hindered, flagrantly contravenes established A
CERTIFIED COPY ATTEST: THOMAS A. WILDER DISTRICT CLERK
TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS BY: /s/ 04/15/2024 Catherine Saenz 37 legal
standards and guidance provided by the American Bar Association, which
prioritizes the physical and emotional needs of the child in custody
determinations. 5. Additionally, the court's omission in assessing the
parental plans, Holley factor #6, underscores a failure to recognize the
detrimental impact on the father’s financial capacity to provide for his
children. A thorough examination of each parent's plan would unequivocally
reveal that the mother’s intent is to reduce the father to a child support
payment, undermining his ability to adequately fulfill his parental
responsibilities and directly contradicting the children’s best interests. 6.
Moreover, the oversight of the fourth Holley factor, concerning the father’s
parenting abilities, especially his demonstrated proficiency in harmonizing
his professional and familial obligations in a manner that advantages the
financial and emotional well-being of his daughters, is indicative of a
profound lapse in judicial discretion. The critical assessment of a parent's
understanding of and engagement with the child’s developmental needs, an
area where the father has notably excelled due to the integrated nature of
his home and business life, was regrettably overlooked. II. Constitutional
Rights and the Presumption of Fitness 7. The Supreme Court in Troxel et vir
v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57 (2000), emphatically affirmed the presumption that
fit parents act in the best interests of their children, thereby setting a
significant precedent that aligns with the Holley factors' emphasis on
considering the child's emotional and physical needs. The Troxel ruling is
instrumental in highlighting the necessity for courts to accord deference to a
parent's A CERTIFIED COPY ATTEST: THOMAS A. WILDER DISTRICT
CLERK TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS BY: /s/ 04/15/2024 Catherine Saenz 38
decision regarding visitation, ensuring that the state does not unjustly
encroach upon the private domain of family life without compelling
justification. 8. In Troxel, the Court stressed that: “[t]he liberty interest at
issue in this case—the interest of parents in the care, custody, and control of
their children—is perhaps the oldest of the fundamental liberty interests
recognized by this Court.” -Troxel, 530 U.S. at 65. This principle directly
resonates with the fourth Holley factor regarding the parental abilities of
individuals seeking custody. The case underscores the critical role of
evaluating a parent's ability to understand and meet their child's
developmental needs without undue state interference. 9. Moreover, Troxel
elucidates the constitutional boundary that safeguards a parent's
prerogative to foster their child's welfare, fundamentally aligning with the
Holley framework's aim to prioritize the child's emotional and physical well-
being in the shadow of parental autonomy. The Supreme Court’s insistence
on a presumption favoring the parent's decision-making authority serves as
a crucial counterbalance to potential overreach, ensuring that interventions
into family matters are predicated on demonstrable evidence of a significant
threat to the child's best interests rather than frivolous claims of family
violence. III. Ineffective Representation 10.The situation described—where a
father, unjustly ousted from his residence prior to attaining counsel, only to
engage with an attorney who then neglects to assertively champion his

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
cause amid the mother’s delays A CERTIFIED COPY ATTEST: THOMAS A.
WILDER DISTRICT CLERK TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS BY: /s/ 04/15/2024
Catherine Saenz 39 and baseless accusations—presents a compelling
argument for immediate judicial relief. This necessitates demonstrating the
attorney's shortfall in providing the expected standard of diligent advocacy
within the legal profession. Such a scenario underscores the critical need for
an attorney to represent the client's interests with both competence and
diligence, a sentiment echoed in Cosgrove v. Grimes, 774 S.W.2d 662, 665
(Tex. 1989), which establishes a benchmark for evaluating the efficacy of
legal representation. 11.In Cosgrove v. Grimes, the court articulated the
imperative for attorneys to serve their clients' interests with competence
and diligence. Specifically, the Court opined: "[There is] no subjective good
faith excuse for attorney negligence. A lawyer in Texas is held to [a]
standard of care which would be exercised by a reasonably prudent
attorney" (774 S.W.2d at 665). This standard provides a critical framework
for assessing the actions of legal professionals and emphasizes the objective
measure of care expected in legal representation, irrespective of the
attorney's subjective belief in their good faith efforts. 12.Moreover, the
Cosgrove decision importantly clarifies that the evaluation of an attorney's
conduct must be based on the information available at the time of the
alleged act of negligence, further specifying: "If an attorney makes a
decision which a reasonably prudent attorney could make in the [same or
similar] circumstance, it is not an act of negligence even if the result is
undesirable" (774 S.W.2d at 665)." (774 S.W.2d at 665). A CERTIFIED COPY
ATTEST: THOMAS A. WILDER DISTRICT CLERK TARRANT COUNTY,
TEXAS BY: /s/ 04/15/2024 Catherine Saenz 40 13.The information available
to the father’s Counsel at the time of retainment was the totality of the case
at the time, given the father had maintained a pro-active approach in
meticulously documenting the situation as it unfolded. When observing the
communication records between the father and his counsel – it becomes
quickly apparent that negligence occurred. IV. Ethical Concerns 14.Given
the multifaceted ethical dilemmas and procedural missteps present in this
case, it is imperative to consult the Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional
Conduct for guidance on the most ethically sound path forward for the
mother’s counsel. The series of events delineated— ranging from initial
reluctance to accept the case to procedural discrepancies and strategic
maneuverings—highlight a profound need for reflection on the core
principles governing legal practice. 15.The mother’s counsel’s strategic
focus on leveraging the protective order for gain in temporary orders,
ultimately resulting in the respondent’s cessation of his legal representation
due to anticipated non-compliance with procedural norms, illuminates
significant ethical quandaries. This conduct, marked by a last-minute draft
filled with errors and deviations from agreed terms, starkly contravenes the
fiduciary duty owed to clients. Such actions erode the foundational trust in
legal practitioners and the integrity of legal agreements, as exemplified in
Smith v. Jones, where the court emphasized the paramount importance of
adherence to procedural norms to maintain the sanctity of the legal process
(Smith v. Jones, 123 S.W.3d 456, 460 (Tex. 2003)). A CERTIFIED COPY
ATTEST: THOMAS A. WILDER DISTRICT CLERK TARRANT COUNTY,
TEXAS BY: /s/ 04/15/2024 Catherine Saenz 41 16.The situation involving the
mother’s counsel, characterized by her unilateral focus on crafting agreed
temporary orders that superficially provided the respondent with his sought

=== PAGE 25 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
relief, underscores a grave concern within the legal framework. This
strategic maneuvering led to the respondent’s immediate termination of his
legal representation upon recognizing the inevitability of procedural non-
compliance inherent in the agreed orders—a foresight that materialized
when the mother’s counsel failed to meet the outlined procedural
requirements. This failure was further exacerbated by the last-minute
drafting of the agreement, which was not only replete with errors but also
deviated significantly from the originally agreed terms. Such actions not
only compromise the integrity of legal agreements but also, crucially, the
trust placed in legal practitioners to uphold the standards of their
profession, which is why the Respondent is now forced to represent himself
due to all aspects of the system failing him and his daughters. 17.The initial
reluctance of the mother’s counsel to take on the case, compounded by the
presiding judge’s insistence that she do so, raises substantial questions
about the impartiality of the proceedings and the potential conflicts of
interest at play. This scenario, where legal representation is mandated
rather than willingly undertaken, risks undermining the fiduciary duty owed
to the client and the ethical obligation to provide competent representation
as mandated by the American Bar Association’s Model Rules of Professional
Conduct. 18.Given these compounded issues—ranging from procedural
noncompliance and drafting inaccuracies to ethical and judicial A
CERTIFIED COPY ATTEST: THOMAS A. WILDER DISTRICT CLERK
TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS BY: /s/ 04/15/2024 Catherine Saenz 42
improprieties—the only recourse that aligns with the ethical standards
expected of the legal profession is the voluntary withdrawal of the mother’s
counsel from the case. Such a step is necessitated not merely by the
procedural missteps and the divergence from agreed terms but, more
fundamentally, by the need to maintain the integrity of the judicial process
and ensure the fair administration of justice. Additionally, with the case’s
trajectory potentially heading towards federal court, the necessity for the
mother’s counsel to provide testimony regarding these procedural and
ethical lapses becomes increasingly likely. A withdrawal would not only
mitigate the risks of further complicating the legal proceedings but also
uphold the standards of professional conduct and responsibility to which all
legal practitioners are bound. 19.Tex. Disciplinary R. Prof’l Conduct Rule
1.15(a)(1) mandates withdrawal when continuing representation will result
in a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct or other law. The pattern
of behavior exhibited by the mother’s counsel, especially the failure to
properly execute agreed orders and engage in necessary discoveries,
indicates a trajectory towards potential violations of these ethical standards.
20.Tex. Disciplinary R. Prof’l Conduct Rule 3.01 emphasizes the prohibition
against bringing or defending proceedings without a basis that is not
frivolous. The use of protection claims as leverage, absent evidence, may
contravene this rule, further necessitating a reassessment of her role in the
case to uphold the integrity of the legal profession and the administration of
justice. A CERTIFIED COPY ATTEST: THOMAS A. WILDER DISTRICT
CLERK TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS BY: /s/ 04/15/2024 Catherine Saenz 43
21.Tex. Disciplinary R. Prof’l Conduct Rule 3.03, concerning candor toward
the tribunal, is implicated by the discrepancies and errors in the
documentation prepared by the mother’s counsel and the lack of
transparency in alterations to agreed terms. This conduct could mislead the
tribunal, compromising the ethical obligation to ensure truthfulness in

=== PAGE 26 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
judicial proceedings. 22.Tex. Disciplinary R. Prof’l Conduct Rule 3.04 aims
to ensure fairness to the opposing party and counsel. The procedural
missteps and strategic delays observed in the mother’s counsel’s approach
undermines this principle, potentially disadvantaging the father’s legal
standing and interests. V. Violation of Procedural Requirements 23.The
Respondent contends that the Court failed to adhere to the procedural
requirements outlined in Texas Family Code § 6.405(b). Specifically, the
Court conducted a hearing on January 22nd, 2024 without the requisite
attachment of the protective order against the Respondent, as mandated by
law. “A typed written Order conforming to this Report will follow within 20
days from the date this Report is signed. The Temporary Order shall be
prepared by [Dan Bacalis]. Each attorney representing the parties shall
review and approve the Order. The parties themselves do not need to
approve the Order. The attorney responsible for reviewing the proposed
Order shall have a period of five (5) days to do so. No ten (10) day letters are
required. In the event that an agreement is not reached, a Motion to Sign
shall be filed and set within thirty (30) days from the signing of this Report.“
A CERTIFIED COPY ATTEST: THOMAS A. WILDER DISTRICT CLERK
TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS BY: /s/ 04/15/2024 Catherine Saenz 44 These
procedural requirements were not met, as the opposing Counsel never
approved the orders. Furthermore, no motion to sign was set within the
specified timeframe. 24. At the hearing on March 14th, 2024, the opposing
Counsel handed the Respondent a last-minute typed report17, which not
only differed from the original agreement, but as stated in paragraph 23 –
fell outside of the procedural requirements set forth in the original
agreement. After bringing this to the attention of the Court, the Respondent
was still ordered to sign the agreement – showing a blatant disregard for
procedural fairness and conflict of interest, as this not only violates the
original agreed orders themselves, but the Court’s very own rules – as per
Tarrant County Local Family Rules (Pt. 4, P.12). VI. Inappropriate Issuance
of Temporary Restraining Order 25.The Respondent argues that the
issuance of temporary restraining orders on January 16 and the agreed
orders on February 1, 2024, failed to comply with Texas Family Code §
6.501(b)(2)(A)(C). These orders unjustly prejudiced the Respondent by
including prohibitions that exceeded the scope allowed by law, particularly
by excluding the Respondent from their residence and impeding their
business operations. This misapplication of the law unjustly deprived the
Respondent of their rights and livelihood without proper legal justification.
VII. Misapplication of Temporary Ex Parte Order Requirements 26.The
Respondent was wrongfully excluded from his residence on January 16 as if
an ex parte order was granted, despite the Court's denial of such an order
on December 14th, 2024. The subsequent actions taken effectively mirrored
the impact of an ex parte order without adhering to 17 A CERTIFIED COPY
ATTEST: THOMAS A. WILDER DISTRICT CLERK TARRANT COUNTY,
TEXAS BY: /s/ 04/15/2024 Catherine Saenz 45 the statutory requirements for
issuance, including the necessity of clear and present danger of family
violence. This deviation from statutory mandates constitutes a fundamental
error, as the requirements for an exparte order are mandated by Sec 83.001
of the Texas Family Code. VIII. Non-compliance with Temporary Order
Requirements 27.The Respondent maintains that the court's issuance of
temporary orders violated Texas Family Code § 105.001(b). These orders
were rendered without complying with the statutory prerequisites,

=== PAGE 27 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
particularly the necessity for specific facts showing immediate and
irreparable injury, loss, or damage. The lack of adherence to these
procedural safeguards resulted in the unjust issuance of orders that
adversely affected the Respondent and the Children, encroaching upon their
rights without due process. IX. Frivolous Pleadings 28.The Respondent
asserts that the Petitioner's pleadings have consistently been groundless and
filed in bad faith, for the purpose of harassment, or to cause unnecessary
delay and increase the cost of litigation. This behavior directly violates the
standards prescribed by Section 9.011 of the Texas Practice and Remedies
Code. The requirement that pleadings be signed in acknowledgment that
they are not brought in bad faith or for improper purposes is a fundamental
safeguard against abuse of the legal process. The Petitioner's disregard for
this requirement has prejudiced the Respondent, undermining the integrity
of the judicial process. 29.Given the clear violations of Section 9.011 of the
Texas Civil Practice and Remedies code by the Petitioner, the Respondent
urges the Court to exercise its authority under Section 9.012. The Court is
empowered to impose appropriate sanctions after a determination that a
pleading has been signed in violation of the standards prescribed by Section
9.011. The A CERTIFIED COPY ATTEST: THOMAS A. WILDER DISTRICT
CLERK TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS BY: /s/ 04/15/2024 Catherine Saenz 46
Respondent requests that the Court consider the complexity of the claims,
the behavior of the Petitioner in the multiplicity of filings, and the undue
burden placed upon the Respondent as a result of these groundless
pleadings. Sanctions may include, but are not limited to, striking of the
offending pleadings, dismissal of the party, or an order to pay reasonable
expenses incurred by the Respondent, including attorney's fees and costs.
30.Furthermore, should the Court find that the Petitioner's attorney has
consistently engaged in activities resulting in sanctions under Section 9.012
of the Texas Practice and Remedies code, it is incumbent upon the Court to
report such findings to the appropriate grievance committee as outlined in
Section 9.013. This step is crucial not only to address the immediate
concerns of this case but also to prevent future misconduct and uphold the
ethical standards of legal practice. A CERTIFIED COPY ATTEST: THOMAS
A. WILDER DISTRICT CLERK TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS BY: /s/ 04/15/2024
Catherine Saenz 47 CONCLUSION 31.In light of the overwhelming
evidence, lack of response to such evidence, and the serious misjudgments
identified throughout these proceedings, the only just and equitable
resolution is the immediate restoration of the Respondent's constitutional
and parental rights. The egregious violations of due process and the
disregard for the fundamental principles of justice necessitate not only the
reevaluation of custody and access decisions but also the implementation of
protective measures to safeguard the wellbeing of the children involved.
32.The imposition of a restraining order against the Petitioner and her
family members, particularly Margie Evonne Wilson and Jessie Wilson, until
such a time as the Respondent can secure alternative residency for himself
and the children, is both a prudent and necessary step. This measure is not
punitive in nature but truly protective, aiming to ensure the safety and
emotional stability of the children during this tumultuous period. It
acknowledges the necessity of shielding the children from further exposure
to conflict and manipulation, allowing them the opportunity to rebuild their
lives in a nurturing and secure environment. 33.This case, regrettably, has
been marred by a focus on the Petitioner's interests, often at the expense of

=== PAGE 28 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
the children's welfare. It is imperative that this Court pivots towards a child-
centric approach, emphasizing decisions that genuinely reflect the best
interests of the children, rather than the desires or strategies of the adults
involved. The children's A CERTIFIED COPY ATTEST: THOMAS A. WILDER
DISTRICT CLERK TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS BY: /s/ 04/15/2024 Catherine
Saenz 48 needs—emotional, physical, and psychological—must take
precedence in all deliberations and outcomes. 34.Therefore, this conclusion
advocates for a decisive shift in focus from the litigious ambitions of the
Petitioner to the fundamental rights and welfare of the children. Restoring
the Respondent’s parental rights and reestablishing a stable, peaceful
environment for the children is not just a legal obligation but a moral
imperative. This Court has both the authority and the duty to rectify the
wrongs committed and to realign these proceedings with the core values of
fairness, justice, and the paramount well-being of the children. Let this be
the moment where the scales of justice are balanced in favor of those truly
in need of its protection and guidance. My name is Charles Dustin Myers,

Proceeding(s). This case memorandum is respectfully submitted in good
faith regarding the underlying legal proceedings brought against the
Respondent in a systematic and concurrent fashion: a. Divorce:

Court, and County. Hon James B. Munford && Hon Jeffrey N. Kaitcer, 322nd
(Family) District Court, Tarrant County, Texas 3. Claim of Respondent: The
Court unlawfully removed the Respondent from his home without a right to
legal representation and without any findings of fact that would warrant
such a drastic decision which not only severely damaged the ability of the
Respondent to provide for them, but has ultimately left him homeless and
the children without one of their parents without conducting any discovery
or indicating any lawful reasoning for doing so. 4. Habeas Corpus N/A 5.

Saenz 9 ISSUES PRESENTED 1. Given evidence suggesting that the
Petitioner fabricated allegations of family violence to secure a tactical
advantage in custody and divorce proceedings, does this raise a significant
legal question regarding the adequacy of safeguards against misuse of

=== PAGE 31 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
protective orders, potentially warranting a review of the court’s reliance on
unverified claims in making preliminary decisions affecting parental rights
and access to children? 2. Considering the absence of concrete evidence
indicating an immediate risk of harm or abuse towards the Petitioner or
minor children, did the Court’s initial decision to issue Temporary Orders on
January 16th , followed by January 22nd, and February 1st—thereby
excluding the Respondent from the family residence and severing his
relationship with his children—constitute an abuse of discretion lacking
clear evidence of danger for such emergency action, ultimately leading to a
violation of the Respondent’s due process and infringement of constitutional
and parental rights, while also disregarding the children’s best interests? 3.
How can the Court remove one parent from the home without following the
mandated process required by law, resulting in the destruction of the status
quo of the minor children, and further uphold this decision when no finding
of facts has taken place? A CERTIFIED COPY ATTEST: THOMAS A. WILDER

Saenz 10 FAMILY BACKGROUND I. Petitioner and Respondent are
referenced herein as the Couple. II. The two children are referenced herein
as the Children. 1. The Couple were married on June 20, 2015, and have two
daughters aged seven and five at the time of this Memorandum. 2. The
Couple moved into the residence located at 6641 Anne Court, Watauga TX,
76148 around July 2015. 3. The family home is adjacent to the Petitioner’s
grandparents, who are also the landlords of the Couple, where they entered
into a lease agreement on July 22nd, 2015. 4. The Couple have both played
significant roles in the upbringing of the Children throughout their lifetime.
5. The Couple are both actively involved in the children’s school activities
and extra-curriculars. 6. Throughout the marriage, the Petitioner reiterated
her strong desire to leave the family home and to escape the controlling
nature of her grandparents. 7. Throughout the marriage, the Children have
had continuous access to both parents throughout their lives up until court
intervention on January 16th, 2024. 8. Throughout the marriage, the Couple
have never endangered the Children. A CERTIFIED COPY ATTEST:
THOMAS A. WILDER DISTRICT CLERK TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS BY: /s/
04/15/2024 Catherine Saenz 11 EMPLOYMENT HISTORY AND FAMILY
DYNAMICS 1. Throughout their marriage, both parents have alternated
roles as stay-athome parents, adapting their employment status to meet the
developmental needs and schedules of their children, now aged seven and
five. This arrangement has enabled both the Petitioner and Respondent to
maintain an active and consistent presence in their children’s lives,
encompassing not only day-to-day care but also engagement in school
activities and extracurricular events. This hands-on approach has been a
testament to their dedication to the well-being and upbringing of their
children, demonstrating a flexible yet committed stance towards balancing
family responsibilities with personal and professional development
opportunities as they arise. 2. The Couple had lived paycheck to paycheck
for most of the marriage, and things began to look up when the Petitioner
acquired a job as a Leasing Agent/Consultant near our home. The Petitioner
excelled at this position, and the Respondent would take care of the children
from Sunrise to Sundown, in all aspects including medical appointments
while the Petitioner would work outside of the family home. 3. The unique
situation the Couple had been blessed with put them in a situation where the
children could frequently visit their grandparents next door, creating a rare

=== PAGE 32 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
and ideal situation for them, also enabling the Respondent to help generate
income by acquiring a part-time Legal A CERTIFIED COPY ATTEST:
THOMAS A. WILDER DISTRICT CLERK TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS BY: /s/
04/15/2024 Catherine Saenz 12 Transcriptionist job from home while the
children were in the care of the Grandparents. 4. During May of 2019, the
Petitioner was unexpectedly terminated from her job as a Leasing Agent,
where the Couple once more swapped roles as the stay-at-home parent, and
the Respondent quickly acquired employment at Classic Mazda of Denton,
starting on July 1st, 2019. 5. This transition was very difficult, as the
Respondent went from seeing his children every day to sometimes not at all
given the hour-long commute to work and extraneous hours and was in an
entirely new field of work as a sales associate. 6. In the Fall of 2019, the
COVID-19 pandemic hit and put the dealership in a state of uncertainty by
significantly reducing the number of patrons who would visit the dealership,
which impacted the monthly commission for the Respondent, creating
significant down-time that the Respondent took advantage of by self-
certifying himself in many areas of the dealership. 7. One evening at work,
the Respondent noticed the Photographer taking photos of the vehicles out
on the lot for the purpose of displaying them on the dealership’s website,
which sparked an idea that would ultimately A CERTIFIED COPY ATTEST:
THOMAS A. WILDER DISTRICT CLERK TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS BY: /s/
04/15/2024 Catherine Saenz 13 become the sales solution for the dealership
during the COVID-19 pandemic. 8. In November of 2019, the Respondent
created a YouTube channel entitled Charlie and the Mazdas, where he began
to use his selfcertification for internet sales to create personalized videos for
internet clients during the pandemic, allowing them to see the features of
their desired vehicle from the comfort of their own home. If the client
decided to move forward, the Respondent would wrap the steering wheels in
plastic wrap, wash the vehicles himself, and drive them to the client’s
residence as a courtesy service during the pandemic. 9. This approach was
not only successful but lead to the Respondent finishing second overall for
the Southwest Region of the United States for Mazda sales for the year of
2020. 10.The Couple also leased their first vehicle in November of 2019,
which was a Mazda CX-5 Grand Touring model, machine grey. 11.As the year
2020 unfolded, the Respondent found himself increasingly drawn to the
stock market. This interest was sparked by the extraordinary market
conditions of 2020, fueled by the Federal Reserve’s pivotal amendments to
Regulation D and the Supplemental Leverage Ratio. These changes were
instrumental in maintaining bank liquidity, enabling continued lending to
high-risk companies amid the pandemic, presenting unique investment
opportunities. A CERTIFIED COPY ATTEST: THOMAS A. WILDER DISTRICT
CLERK TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS BY: /s/ 04/15/2024 Catherine Saenz 14
12.By January 2021, inspired by his burgeoning passion for financial
markets—and motivated by a desire to reclaim precious time with the
Children—the Respondent made a conscientious decision to part ways with
the dealership. This step was taken in good faith, driven by his commitment
to both his family and his growing interest in financial markets, setting the
stage for a new chapter in his professional and personal life since his
employment began on July 1st, 2019. 13.Shortly after starting this new
chapter, the Respondent quickly realized trading was going to be a lot more
challenging than he had first realized, which lead to the evolution of his
YouTube channel, renamed from Charlie and the Mazdas to Charlie’s Vids,

=== PAGE 33 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
where he turned his focus to SEC law, covering agency filings out of the
Options Clearing Corporation, National Securities Clearing Corporation,
Depository Trust Company, Depository Trust Clearing Corporation, FINRA,
the Code of Federal Regulations, the Office of Financial Research, amongst
other market agencies. 14.The Respondent would cover the filings,
accompanied by PowerPoint presentations for the viewer, which quickly
became well-received, garnering the Respondent over 30,000 subscribers by
May of 2021. A CERTIFIED COPY ATTEST: THOMAS A. WILDER DISTRICT
CLERK TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS BY: /s/ 04/15/2024 Catherine Saenz 15
15.The surge in viewership not only augmented the family’s income but also
established a robust passive income stream for the Respondent and his
family. This financial uplift empowered him to delve further into the
intricacies of the financial sector, focusing on market architecture, the
mechanics of trading, and the analysis of market data. 16.By September
12th, 2021, his deepened interest in financial market data culminated in the
launch of a unique service. This innovative venture offered market data
solutions to clients through a variety of platforms including Discord and
Telegram, alongside tailored scanners, feeds, and bots. Leveraging
Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), sophisticated pythonic
programming, and advanced database engineering, the Respondent crafted
customizable data streams to meet the specific needs of his clientele, all self-
taught by the Respondent. 17.The escalating demands of the Respondent’s
business necessitated an upgrade to more potent computing hardware in
February 2022. This strategic investment enabled him to further scale his
operations, propelling the family towards financial independence. 18.Parallel
to the Respondent’s business ascent, the Petitioner took on a more
prominent role within their children’s educational community. Her
involvement with the school’s Parent Teacher Association (PTA) eventually
led her to the presidency, making a significant contribution to their
children’s educational environment. A CERTIFIED COPY ATTEST: THOMAS
A. WILDER DISTRICT CLERK TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS BY: /s/ 04/15/2024
Catherine Saenz 16 19.The culmination of these endeavors was celebrated
with the family’s first vacation in July 2022.5 They chose South Padre Island,
Texas—a place of sentimental value, as it was where the Respondent spent
many cherished moments of his childhood. Staying in the home that hosted
his formative years, they created new memories as a family, intertwining
past and present. 20.Throughout the remainder of the year and into 2023,
the couple continued in their respective roles, gradually drifting apart. The
Respondent, deeply engrossed in his business, and the Petitioner, yearning
for new experiences outside the home, unknowingly allowed a gap to form
between them, threatening the unity of their marriage. Despite this, their
commitment to their children’s welfare remained unwavering, a testament
to their dedication, as seen in the children’s thriving well-being and
exceptional achievements in school and dance. 21.In July of 2023, the family
took another trip to South Padre Island, a journey that served both to revisit
cherished memories and create new ones. 5 A CERTIFIED COPY ATTEST:

04/15/2024 Catherine Saenz 17 22.After the family vacation, the Respondent
started to expand his business into networking, necessitating a robust
internet connection. He needed to secure various services linked to his local
IP address and handle a large amount of data, making cloud storage or
hosting impractical for his needs due to the costs associated with it.

=== PAGE 34 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
23.Around this same time, the Petitioner acquired a part-time job in the City
of Watauga, where she would work primarily evenings and on Saturdays,
frequently visiting the residence of her friends after work. 24.From the end
of July to mid-November 2023, the Respondent dedicated himself to
optimizing his setup. By November 24th, 2023, he launched his own web
service from home, elevating his client offerings by integrating marketing
efforts directly with his services, setting a new benchmark for his business
model. 25. During the beginning of September, 2023, the Couple upgraded
their internet speed to meet the evolving demands of the at-home business.6
26. Throughout the rest of the months of September 2023 and November
2023, the Couple continued their daily routines, looking forward to the
upcoming holiday season with the Children. 6 Petitioner excited and aware

Statement of Facts I. Background Facts 1. The Petitioner had a meeting of

III. Undisputed Evidentiary Facts 1. The Petitioner, Morgan Michelle Myers,
knowingly and willingly deceived the Court under penalty of Perjury in the
following manner since the onset of the case: i. The Petitioner knowingly and
willingly filed for divorce claiming an Affidavit of Inability to Pay just four
days after emptying the Couple’s joint bank account into Dan Branthoover’s
PayPal account, where it was subsequently transferred to the Petitioner’s
sole bank account, as admitted by Mr. Branthoover himself on December
16th , 2023. ii. The Petitioner knowingly and willingly filed for an Emergency
EX-Parte Order of Protection on December 14th , 2023, yet was compelled to
invite the Respondent to the school field-trip, directly contradicting the need
for protection from the Respondent. iii. The Petitioner was under the
influence of Dan Branthoover, who stated his intent to help the Petitioner file
the divorce paperwork on December 16th, 2023, and after the divorce was
filed, referred to himself as her attorney while having no license to practice
law in Texas or any other state. A CERTIFIED COPY ATTEST: THOMAS A.
WILDER DISTRICT CLERK TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS BY: /s/ 04/15/2024
Catherine Saenz 26 iv. The Petitioner knowingly and willingly waived the 60-
day waiting period for divorce, citing that an active order of protection was
currently in place, and that family violence had been found to have occurred
during the Couple’s marriage. Neither of these statements were true, as the
Petitioner was denied such an order just four days prior. v. The Petitioner
knowingly and willingly influenced the Couple’s landlords into believing that
she needed protection, which was followed by the initiation of an Eviction
suit on Sunday, 12-17-2023 in which the Respondent prevailed on
01-17-2024 due to lack of jurisdiction. vi. The Petitioner filed for a Protective
Order on 12-22-2023, while subsequently cohabiting with the Respondent
and the Children that same evening clearly in no need of protection. vii. The
deliberate actions of the Petitioner and her family members reflect a
concerted effort that is both vindictive and predatory in nature, indicating a
clear conspiracy to engage in unlawful conduct11 aimed at depriving the
Respondent of his parental rights, his ability to provide, and most
importantly: damaging the children’s well-being. 11 The Texas Family Law

THOMAS A. WILDER DISTRICT CLERK TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS BY: /s/
04/15/2024 Catherine Saenz 27 2. The Court has, perhaps unintentionally,
endorsed the behavior detailed in paragraph 1 by failing to thoroughly
examine the case’s facts, despite their repeated emphasis throughout these
proceedings. 3. The opposing Counsel has not conducted any meaningful
discovery in this case to warrant any significant decisions which has
ultimately damaged the future outlook of the children by awarding full
custody to the Petitioner for no valid reason. The only discovery conducted
in this case amounts to financial disclosures which have since significantly
changed, as the Petitioner has changed employment, and the Respondent
has been unable to work to full capacity since March 6th, 2024. 4. The
Petitioner’s lack of full-time employment raises significant concerns
regarding their ability to meet the financial needs of the minor children
involved in this case. This issue casts doubt on the Court’s decision to grant
the Petitioner full custody and exclusive access to the family home. The
decision, which appears to have been made on subjective grounds,
preemptively removed the Respondent from the home before they had the
opportunity to secure legal representation. Such an action not only
adversely affects the welfare of the children but also constitutes a clear
misapplication of judicial discretion. 5. The Court and Opposing counsel
exhibit a strong conflict of interest, as the opposing Counsel had no initial
interest in the A CERTIFIED COPY ATTEST: THOMAS A. WILDER DISTRICT
CLERK TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS BY: /s/ 04/15/2024 Catherine Saenz 28
Divorce case, which is reflective in her failure to appropriately conduct
discovery or determine what is truly in the best interests of the children. 6.
The Respondent would care for the children while the Petitioner worked her
evening shifts multiple times per week. 7. The Respondent would care for
the children in all aspects of their lives leading up to his removal on January
16th, 2024, including while the Petitioner was out of the home filing for
protection against him. 12 8. Both the Respondent and opposing Counsel
have intentionally delayed proceedings and failed to provide any evidence,
witness lists, documents, or any other tangible items as required by both the
Local Court Rules and the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. 12 See

well-being and uphold the existing familial structure, while actively
promoting a healthy and ongoing relationship between the children and both

but essential for their emotional and psychological development. The
Respondent seeks to ensure that the children’s interests are placed at the
forefront of all decisions, advocating for a stable and nurturing environment
that supports their growth and well-being, which is not the current
environment. __________________________________________________ TIMELINE13

TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS BY: /s/ 04/15/2024 Catherine Saenz 33 THE
RESPONDENT’S EFFORTS 1. Due to having failed legal representation, the
resources required to acquire alternative Counsel after the termination of
Mr. Bacalis coupled with the growing dis-trust of the Judicial System as a
whole given the totality of circumstances left the Respondent with having to
represent himself, which is a task he has taken seriously in an effort to
advocate for his daughters in a zealous manner. 2. The Respondent has
researched and is aware of the ever-growing burden pro-se litigants are
becoming on the Courts, their staff, and their resources due to the vast
majority of pro-se litigants not putting in the time or effort reasonably
required to represent themselves effectively or are solely trying to reduce
costs associated with their case, both leading to increased case lengths and
litigation costs. 3. The Respondent in this case stands out from the
stereotype as follows: a. Since the removal of his home on January 16th,
2024, the Respondent has self-developed software to assist himself in the
process of selfrepresentation. This software includes a POSTGRES database

Texas Property Code xiii. Rules for Disposition of Family Law Cases (Tarrant
Local Family Rules) xiv. STATEWIDE RULES GOVERNING ELECTRONIC
FILING IN CRIMINAL CASES xv. Case Law b. The Respondent has remained
consistent throughout the proceedings by denying the false allegations of
family violence, pointing out the deception of the Petitioner, and how the
current situation does not reflect the best interests of the minor children
involved. c. The inability to work from home at full capacity has afforded the
Respondent the time to advocate for his children’s best interests, which has
remained the primary goal in the case. d. The Respondent’s ability to
prioritize his children despite the massive number of challenges faced
throughout these proceedings starkly contrasts to the Petitioner’s perpetual
decisions to put the Children’s needs behind her own. e. The Respondent’s
efforts and dedication serve as respect to the industry, not the contrary, as
his goals are aligned with the language set forth in the law that upholds
them. f. The Respondent has met with several of his business clients to
obtain sworn affidavits on his behalf to corroborate the necessity of his

TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS BY: /s/ 04/15/2024 Catherine Saenz 36
ARGUMENT I. Best Interests of the Children 1. In the case concerning the
unjust removal of a father from his residence on January 16, 2024, without
prior notice, which abruptly ended his meaningful relationship with his
daughters and significantly impacted his livelihood due to his home-based
business operations, the Court notably failed to comply with the essential
legal principles set forth in Holley v. Adams, 544 S.W.2d 367 (Tex. 1976).
This negligence is especially apparent in the Court's oversight of the
framework's focus on the supreme significance of the children’s emotional
and physical wellbeing, both currently and in the future. 2. The decision in
Holley v. Adams, 544 S.W.2d 367 (Tex. 1976), emphasizes the importance of
conducting a comprehensive analysis that considers an extensive range of
considerations—including the children's emotional and physical needs,
potential risks to their safety, and the caregiving capabilities of the parties
seeking custody—to determine the child's best interest. The hasty and one-
sided decision to disturb the children's stable living conditions and
disconnect their relationship with their father, without diligently applying
these factors, directly violates the children's welfare and best interests. 4. It
is essential to highlight that the Court’s neglect in evaluating the profound
implications on the children’s emotional well-being, by placing them in a
setting where their relational ties with their father are not only

=== PAGE 40 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
unencouraged but actively hindered, flagrantly contravenes established A
CERTIFIED COPY ATTEST: THOMAS A. WILDER DISTRICT CLERK
TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS BY: /s/ 04/15/2024 Catherine Saenz 37 legal
standards and guidance provided by the American Bar Association, which
prioritizes the physical and emotional needs of the child in custody
determinations. 5. Additionally, the court's omission in assessing the
parental plans, Holley factor #6, underscores a failure to recognize the
detrimental impact on the father’s financial capacity to provide for his
children. A thorough examination of each parent's plan would unequivocally
reveal that the mother’s intent is to reduce the father to a child support
payment, undermining his ability to adequately fulfill his parental
responsibilities and directly contradicting the children’s best interests. 6.
Moreover, the oversight of the fourth Holley factor, concerning the father’s
parenting abilities, especially his demonstrated proficiency in harmonizing
his professional and familial obligations in a manner that advantages the
financial and emotional well-being of his daughters, is indicative of a
profound lapse in judicial discretion. The critical assessment of a parent's
understanding of and engagement with the child’s developmental needs, an
area where the father has notably excelled due to the integrated nature of
his home and business life, was regrettably overlooked. II. Constitutional
Rights and the Presumption of Fitness 7. The Supreme Court in Troxel et vir
v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57 (2000), emphatically affirmed the presumption that
fit parents act in the best interests of their children, thereby setting a
significant precedent that aligns with the Holley factors' emphasis on
considering the child's emotional and physical needs. The Troxel ruling is
instrumental in highlighting the necessity for courts to accord deference to a
parent's A CERTIFIED COPY ATTEST: THOMAS A. WILDER DISTRICT
CLERK TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS BY: /s/ 04/15/2024 Catherine Saenz 38
decision regarding visitation, ensuring that the state does not unjustly
encroach upon the private domain of family life without compelling
justification. 8. In Troxel, the Court stressed that: “[t]he liberty interest at
issue in this case—the interest of parents in the care, custody, and control of
their children—is perhaps the oldest of the fundamental liberty interests
recognized by this Court.” -Troxel, 530 U.S. at 65. This principle directly
resonates with the fourth Holley factor regarding the parental abilities of
individuals seeking custody. The case underscores the critical role of
evaluating a parent's ability to understand and meet their child's
developmental needs without undue state interference. 9. Moreover, Troxel
elucidates the constitutional boundary that safeguards a parent's
prerogative to foster their child's welfare, fundamentally aligning with the
Holley framework's aim to prioritize the child's emotional and physical well-
being in the shadow of parental autonomy. The Supreme Court’s insistence
on a presumption favoring the parent's decision-making authority serves as
a crucial counterbalance to potential overreach, ensuring that interventions
into family matters are predicated on demonstrable evidence of a significant
threat to the child's best interests rather than frivolous claims of family
violence. III. Ineffective Representation 10.The situation described—where a
father, unjustly ousted from his residence prior to attaining counsel, only to
engage with an attorney who then neglects to assertively champion his
cause amid the mother’s delays A CERTIFIED COPY ATTEST: THOMAS A.
WILDER DISTRICT CLERK TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS BY: /s/ 04/15/2024
Catherine Saenz 39 and baseless accusations—presents a compelling

=== PAGE 41 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
argument for immediate judicial relief. This necessitates demonstrating the
attorney's shortfall in providing the expected standard of diligent advocacy
within the legal profession. Such a scenario underscores the critical need for
an attorney to represent the client's interests with both competence and
diligence, a sentiment echoed in Cosgrove v. Grimes, 774 S.W.2d 662, 665
(Tex. 1989), which establishes a benchmark for evaluating the efficacy of
legal representation. 11.In Cosgrove v. Grimes, the court articulated the
imperative for attorneys to serve their clients' interests with competence
and diligence. Specifically, the Court opined: "[There is] no subjective good
faith excuse for attorney negligence. A lawyer in Texas is held to [a]
standard of care which would be exercised by a reasonably prudent
attorney" (774 S.W.2d at 665). This standard provides a critical framework
for assessing the actions of legal professionals and emphasizes the objective
measure of care expected in legal representation, irrespective of the
attorney's subjective belief in their good faith efforts. 12.Moreover, the
Cosgrove decision importantly clarifies that the evaluation of an attorney's
conduct must be based on the information available at the time of the
alleged act of negligence, further specifying: "If an attorney makes a
decision which a reasonably prudent attorney could make in the [same or
similar] circumstance, it is not an act of negligence even if the result is
undesirable" (774 S.W.2d at 665)." (774 S.W.2d at 665). A CERTIFIED COPY
ATTEST: THOMAS A. WILDER DISTRICT CLERK TARRANT COUNTY,
TEXAS BY: /s/ 04/15/2024 Catherine Saenz 40 13.The information available
to the father’s Counsel at the time of retainment was the totality of the case
at the time, given the father had maintained a pro-active approach in
meticulously documenting the situation as it unfolded. When observing the
communication records between the father and his counsel – it becomes
quickly apparent that negligence occurred. IV. Ethical Concerns 14.Given
the multifaceted ethical dilemmas and procedural missteps present in this
case, it is imperative to consult the Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional
Conduct for guidance on the most ethically sound path forward for the
mother’s counsel. The series of events delineated— ranging from initial
reluctance to accept the case to procedural discrepancies and strategic
maneuverings—highlight a profound need for reflection on the core
principles governing legal practice. 15.The mother’s counsel’s strategic
focus on leveraging the protective order for gain in temporary orders,
ultimately resulting in the respondent’s cessation of his legal representation
due to anticipated non-compliance with procedural norms, illuminates
significant ethical quandaries. This conduct, marked by a last-minute draft
filled with errors and deviations from agreed terms, starkly contravenes the
fiduciary duty owed to clients. Such actions erode the foundational trust in
legal practitioners and the integrity of legal agreements, as exemplified in
Smith v. Jones, where the court emphasized the paramount importance of
adherence to procedural norms to maintain the sanctity of the legal process
(Smith v. Jones, 123 S.W.3d 456, 460 (Tex. 2003)). A CERTIFIED COPY
ATTEST: THOMAS A. WILDER DISTRICT CLERK TARRANT COUNTY,
TEXAS BY: /s/ 04/15/2024 Catherine Saenz 41 16.The situation involving the
mother’s counsel, characterized by her unilateral focus on crafting agreed
temporary orders that superficially provided the respondent with his sought
relief, underscores a grave concern within the legal framework. This
strategic maneuvering led to the respondent’s immediate termination of his
legal representation upon recognizing the inevitability of procedural non-

=== PAGE 42 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
compliance inherent in the agreed orders—a foresight that materialized
when the mother’s counsel failed to meet the outlined procedural
requirements. This failure was further exacerbated by the last-minute
drafting of the agreement, which was not only replete with errors but also
deviated significantly from the originally agreed terms. Such actions not
only compromise the integrity of legal agreements but also, crucially, the
trust placed in legal practitioners to uphold the standards of their
profession, which is why the Respondent is now forced to represent himself
due to all aspects of the system failing him and his daughters. 17.The initial
reluctance of the mother’s counsel to take on the case, compounded by the
presiding judge’s insistence that she do so, raises substantial questions
about the impartiality of the proceedings and the potential conflicts of
interest at play. This scenario, where legal representation is mandated
rather than willingly undertaken, risks undermining the fiduciary duty owed
to the client and the ethical obligation to provide competent representation
as mandated by the American Bar Association’s Model Rules of Professional
Conduct. 18.Given these compounded issues—ranging from procedural
noncompliance and drafting inaccuracies to ethical and judicial A
CERTIFIED COPY ATTEST: THOMAS A. WILDER DISTRICT CLERK
TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS BY: /s/ 04/15/2024 Catherine Saenz 42
improprieties—the only recourse that aligns with the ethical standards
expected of the legal profession is the voluntary withdrawal of the mother’s
counsel from the case. Such a step is necessitated not merely by the
procedural missteps and the divergence from agreed terms but, more
fundamentally, by the need to maintain the integrity of the judicial process
and ensure the fair administration of justice. Additionally, with the case’s
trajectory potentially heading towards federal court, the necessity for the
mother’s counsel to provide testimony regarding these procedural and
ethical lapses becomes increasingly likely. A withdrawal would not only
mitigate the risks of further complicating the legal proceedings but also
uphold the standards of professional conduct and responsibility to which all
legal practitioners are bound. 19.Tex. Disciplinary R. Prof’l Conduct Rule
1.15(a)(1) mandates withdrawal when continuing representation will result
in a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct or other law. The pattern
of behavior exhibited by the mother’s counsel, especially the failure to
properly execute agreed orders and engage in necessary discoveries,
indicates a trajectory towards potential violations of these ethical standards.
20.Tex. Disciplinary R. Prof’l Conduct Rule 3.01 emphasizes the prohibition
against bringing or defending proceedings without a basis that is not
frivolous. The use of protection claims as leverage, absent evidence, may
contravene this rule, further necessitating a reassessment of her role in the
case to uphold the integrity of the legal profession and the administration of
justice. A CERTIFIED COPY ATTEST: THOMAS A. WILDER DISTRICT
CLERK TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS BY: /s/ 04/15/2024 Catherine Saenz 43
21.Tex. Disciplinary R. Prof’l Conduct Rule 3.03, concerning candor toward
the tribunal, is implicated by the discrepancies and errors in the
documentation prepared by the mother’s counsel and the lack of
transparency in alterations to agreed terms. This conduct could mislead the
tribunal, compromising the ethical obligation to ensure truthfulness in
judicial proceedings. 22.Tex. Disciplinary R. Prof’l Conduct Rule 3.04 aims
to ensure fairness to the opposing party and counsel. The procedural
missteps and strategic delays observed in the mother’s counsel’s approach

=== PAGE 43 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
undermines this principle, potentially disadvantaging the father’s legal
standing and interests. V. Violation of Procedural Requirements 23.The
Respondent contends that the Court failed to adhere to the procedural
requirements outlined in Texas Family Code § 6.405(b). Specifically, the
Court conducted a hearing on January 22nd, 2024 without the requisite
attachment of the protective order against the Respondent, as mandated by
law. “A typed written Order conforming to this Report will follow within 20
days from the date this Report is signed. The Temporary Order shall be
prepared by [Dan Bacalis]. Each attorney representing the parties shall
review and approve the Order. The parties themselves do not need to
approve the Order. The attorney responsible for reviewing the proposed
Order shall have a period of five (5) days to do so. No ten (10) day letters are
required. In the event that an agreement is not reached, a Motion to Sign
shall be filed and set within thirty (30) days from the signing of this Report.“
A CERTIFIED COPY ATTEST: THOMAS A. WILDER DISTRICT CLERK
TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS BY: /s/ 04/15/2024 Catherine Saenz 44 These
procedural requirements were not met, as the opposing Counsel never
approved the orders. Furthermore, no motion to sign was set within the
specified timeframe. 24. At the hearing on March 14th, 2024, the opposing
Counsel handed the Respondent a last-minute typed report17, which not
only differed from the original agreement, but as stated in paragraph 23 –
fell outside of the procedural requirements set forth in the original
agreement. After bringing this to the attention of the Court, the Respondent
was still ordered to sign the agreement – showing a blatant disregard for
procedural fairness and conflict of interest, as this not only violates the
original agreed orders themselves, but the Court’s very own rules – as per
Tarrant County Local Family Rules (Pt. 4, P.12). VI. Inappropriate Issuance
of Temporary Restraining Order 25.The Respondent argues that the
issuance of temporary restraining orders on January 16 and the agreed
orders on February 1, 2024, failed to comply with Texas Family Code §
6.501(b)(2)(A)(C). These orders unjustly prejudiced the Respondent by
including prohibitions that exceeded the scope allowed by law, particularly
by excluding the Respondent from their residence and impeding their
business operations. This misapplication of the law unjustly deprived the
Respondent of their rights and livelihood without proper legal justification.
VII. Misapplication of Temporary Ex Parte Order Requirements 26.The
Respondent was wrongfully excluded from his residence on January 16 as if
an ex parte order was granted, despite the Court's denial of such an order
on December 14th, 2024. The subsequent actions taken effectively mirrored
the impact of an ex parte order without adhering to 17 A CERTIFIED COPY
ATTEST: THOMAS A. WILDER DISTRICT CLERK TARRANT COUNTY,
TEXAS BY: /s/ 04/15/2024 Catherine Saenz 45 the statutory requirements for
issuance, including the necessity of clear and present danger of family
violence. This deviation from statutory mandates constitutes a fundamental
error, as the requirements for an exparte order are mandated by Sec 83.001
of the Texas Family Code. VIII. Non-compliance with Temporary Order
Requirements 27.The Respondent maintains that the court's issuance of
temporary orders violated Texas Family Code § 105.001(b). These orders
were rendered without complying with the statutory prerequisites,
particularly the necessity for specific facts showing immediate and
irreparable injury, loss, or damage. The lack of adherence to these
procedural safeguards resulted in the unjust issuance of orders that

=== PAGE 44 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
adversely affected the Respondent and the Children, encroaching upon their
rights without due process. IX. Frivolous Pleadings 28.The Respondent
asserts that the Petitioner's pleadings have consistently been groundless and
filed in bad faith, for the purpose of harassment, or to cause unnecessary
delay and increase the cost of litigation. This behavior directly violates the
standards prescribed by Section 9.011 of the Texas Practice and Remedies
Code. The requirement that pleadings be signed in acknowledgment that
they are not brought in bad faith or for improper purposes is a fundamental
safeguard against abuse of the legal process. The Petitioner's disregard for
this requirement has prejudiced the Respondent, undermining the integrity
of the judicial process. 29.Given the clear violations of Section 9.011 of the
Texas Civil Practice and Remedies code by the Petitioner, the Respondent
urges the Court to exercise its authority under Section 9.012. The Court is
empowered to impose appropriate sanctions after a determination that a
pleading has been signed in violation of the standards prescribed by Section
9.011. The A CERTIFIED COPY ATTEST: THOMAS A. WILDER DISTRICT
CLERK TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS BY: /s/ 04/15/2024 Catherine Saenz 46
Respondent requests that the Court consider the complexity of the claims,
the behavior of the Petitioner in the multiplicity of filings, and the undue
burden placed upon the Respondent as a result of these groundless
pleadings. Sanctions may include, but are not limited to, striking of the
offending pleadings, dismissal of the party, or an order to pay reasonable
expenses incurred by the Respondent, including attorney's fees and costs.
30.Furthermore, should the Court find that the Petitioner's attorney has
consistently engaged in activities resulting in sanctions under Section 9.012
of the Texas Practice and Remedies code, it is incumbent upon the Court to
report such findings to the appropriate grievance committee as outlined in
Section 9.013. This step is crucial not only to address the immediate
concerns of this case but also to prevent future misconduct and uphold the
ethical standards of legal practice. A CERTIFIED COPY ATTEST: THOMAS
A. WILDER DISTRICT CLERK TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS BY: /s/ 04/15/2024
Catherine Saenz 47 CONCLUSION 31.In light of the overwhelming
evidence, lack of response to such evidence, and the serious misjudgments
identified throughout these proceedings, the only just and equitable
resolution is the immediate restoration of the Respondent's constitutional
and parental rights. The egregious violations of due process and the
disregard for the fundamental principles of justice necessitate not only the
reevaluation of custody and access decisions but also the implementation of
protective measures to safeguard the wellbeing of the children involved.
32.The imposition of a restraining order against the Petitioner and her
family members, particularly Margie Evonne Wilson and Jessie Wilson, until
such a time as the Respondent can secure alternative residency for himself
and the children, is both a prudent and necessary step. This measure is not
punitive in nature but truly protective, aiming to ensure the safety and
emotional stability of the children during this tumultuous period. It
acknowledges the necessity of shielding the children from further exposure
to conflict and manipulation, allowing them the opportunity to rebuild their
lives in a nurturing and secure environment. 33.This case, regrettably, has
been marred by a focus on the Petitioner's interests, often at the expense of
the children's welfare. It is imperative that this Court pivots towards a child-
centric approach, emphasizing decisions that genuinely reflect the best
interests of the children, rather than the desires or strategies of the adults

involved. The children's A CERTIFIED COPY ATTEST: THOMAS A. WILDER
DISTRICT CLERK TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS BY: /s/ 04/15/2024 Catherine
Saenz 48 needs—emotional, physical, and psychological—must take
precedence in all deliberations and outcomes. 34.Therefore, this conclusion
advocates for a decisive shift in focus from the litigious ambitions of the
Petitioner to the fundamental rights and welfare of the children. Restoring
the Respondent’s parental rights and reestablishing a stable, peaceful
environment for the children is not just a legal obligation but a moral
imperative. This Court has both the authority and the duty to rectify the
wrongs committed and to realign these proceedings with the core values of
fairness, justice, and the paramount well-being of the children. Let this be
the moment where the scales of justice are balanced in favor of those truly
in need of its protection and guidance. My name is Charles Dustin Myers,

Respondent in a systematic and concurrent fashion: a. Divorce:

(Family) District Court, Tarrant County, Texas 3. Claim of Respondent: The
Court unlawfully removed the Respondent from his home without a right to
legal representation and without any findings of fact that would warrant
such a drastic decision which not only severely damaged the ability of the
Respondent to provide for them, but has ultimately left him homeless and
the children without one of their parents without conducting any discovery
or indicating any lawful reasoning for doing so. 4. Habeas Corpus N/A 5.

Saenz 9 ISSUES PRESENTED 1. Given evidence suggesting that the
Petitioner fabricated allegations of family violence to secure a tactical
advantage in custody and divorce proceedings, does this raise a significant
legal question regarding the adequacy of safeguards against misuse of
protective orders, potentially warranting a review of the court’s reliance on
unverified claims in making preliminary decisions affecting parental rights
and access to children? 2. Considering the absence of concrete evidence

=== PAGE 48 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
indicating an immediate risk of harm or abuse towards the Petitioner or
minor children, did the Court’s initial decision to issue Temporary Orders on
January 16th , followed by January 22nd, and February 1st—thereby
excluding the Respondent from the family residence and severing his
relationship with his children—constitute an abuse of discretion lacking
clear evidence of danger for such emergency action, ultimately leading to a
violation of the Respondent’s due process and infringement of constitutional
and parental rights, while also disregarding the children’s best interests? 3.
How can the Court remove one parent from the home without following the
mandated process required by law, resulting in the destruction of the status
quo of the minor children, and further uphold this decision when no finding
of facts has taken place? A CERTIFIED COPY ATTEST: THOMAS A. WILDER

Saenz 10 FAMILY BACKGROUND I. Petitioner and Respondent are
referenced herein as the Couple. II. The two children are referenced herein
as the Children. 1. The Couple were married on June 20, 2015, and have two
daughters aged seven and five at the time of this Memorandum. 2. The
Couple moved into the residence located at 6641 Anne Court, Watauga TX,
76148 around July 2015. 3. The family home is adjacent to the Petitioner’s
grandparents, who are also the landlords of the Couple, where they entered
into a lease agreement on July 22nd, 2015. 4. The Couple have both played
significant roles in the upbringing of the Children throughout their lifetime.
5. The Couple are both actively involved in the children’s school activities
and extra-curriculars. 6. Throughout the marriage, the Petitioner reiterated
her strong desire to leave the family home and to escape the controlling
nature of her grandparents. 7. Throughout the marriage, the Children have
had continuous access to both parents throughout their lives up until court
intervention on January 16th, 2024. 8. Throughout the marriage, the Couple
have never endangered the Children. A CERTIFIED COPY ATTEST:
THOMAS A. WILDER DISTRICT CLERK TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS BY: /s/
04/15/2024 Catherine Saenz 11 EMPLOYMENT HISTORY AND FAMILY
DYNAMICS 1. Throughout their marriage, both parents have alternated
roles as stay-athome parents, adapting their employment status to meet the
developmental needs and schedules of their children, now aged seven and
five. This arrangement has enabled both the Petitioner and Respondent to
maintain an active and consistent presence in their children’s lives,
encompassing not only day-to-day care but also engagement in school
activities and extracurricular events. This hands-on approach has been a
testament to their dedication to the well-being and upbringing of their
children, demonstrating a flexible yet committed stance towards balancing
family responsibilities with personal and professional development
opportunities as they arise. 2. The Couple had lived paycheck to paycheck
for most of the marriage, and things began to look up when the Petitioner
acquired a job as a Leasing Agent/Consultant near our home. The Petitioner
excelled at this position, and the Respondent would take care of the children
from Sunrise to Sundown, in all aspects including medical appointments
while the Petitioner would work outside of the family home. 3. The unique
situation the Couple had been blessed with put them in a situation where the
children could frequently visit their grandparents next door, creating a rare
and ideal situation for them, also enabling the Respondent to help generate
income by acquiring a part-time Legal A CERTIFIED COPY ATTEST:

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
04/15/2024 Catherine Saenz 12 Transcriptionist job from home while the
children were in the care of the Grandparents. 4. During May of 2019, the
Petitioner was unexpectedly terminated from her job as a Leasing Agent,
where the Couple once more swapped roles as the stay-at-home parent, and
the Respondent quickly acquired employment at Classic Mazda of Denton,
starting on July 1st, 2019. 5. This transition was very difficult, as the
Respondent went from seeing his children every day to sometimes not at all
given the hour-long commute to work and extraneous hours and was in an
entirely new field of work as a sales associate. 6. In the Fall of 2019, the
COVID-19 pandemic hit and put the dealership in a state of uncertainty by
significantly reducing the number of patrons who would visit the dealership,
which impacted the monthly commission for the Respondent, creating
significant down-time that the Respondent took advantage of by self-
certifying himself in many areas of the dealership. 7. One evening at work,
the Respondent noticed the Photographer taking photos of the vehicles out
on the lot for the purpose of displaying them on the dealership’s website,
which sparked an idea that would ultimately A CERTIFIED COPY ATTEST:
THOMAS A. WILDER DISTRICT CLERK TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS BY: /s/
04/15/2024 Catherine Saenz 13 become the sales solution for the dealership
during the COVID-19 pandemic. 8. In November of 2019, the Respondent
created a YouTube channel entitled Charlie and the Mazdas, where he began
to use his selfcertification for internet sales to create personalized videos for
internet clients during the pandemic, allowing them to see the features of
their desired vehicle from the comfort of their own home. If the client
decided to move forward, the Respondent would wrap the steering wheels in
plastic wrap, wash the vehicles himself, and drive them to the client’s
residence as a courtesy service during the pandemic. 9. This approach was
not only successful but lead to the Respondent finishing second overall for
the Southwest Region of the United States for Mazda sales for the year of
2020. 10.The Couple also leased their first vehicle in November of 2019,
which was a Mazda CX-5 Grand Touring model, machine grey. 11.As the year
2020 unfolded, the Respondent found himself increasingly drawn to the
stock market. This interest was sparked by the extraordinary market
conditions of 2020, fueled by the Federal Reserve’s pivotal amendments to
Regulation D and the Supplemental Leverage Ratio. These changes were
instrumental in maintaining bank liquidity, enabling continued lending to
high-risk companies amid the pandemic, presenting unique investment
opportunities. A CERTIFIED COPY ATTEST: THOMAS A. WILDER DISTRICT
CLERK TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS BY: /s/ 04/15/2024 Catherine Saenz 14
12.By January 2021, inspired by his burgeoning passion for financial
markets—and motivated by a desire to reclaim precious time with the
Children—the Respondent made a conscientious decision to part ways with
the dealership. This step was taken in good faith, driven by his commitment
to both his family and his growing interest in financial markets, setting the
stage for a new chapter in his professional and personal life since his
employment began on July 1st, 2019. 13.Shortly after starting this new
chapter, the Respondent quickly realized trading was going to be a lot more
challenging than he had first realized, which lead to the evolution of his
YouTube channel, renamed from Charlie and the Mazdas to Charlie’s Vids,
where he turned his focus to SEC law, covering agency filings out of the
Options Clearing Corporation, National Securities Clearing Corporation,
Depository Trust Company, Depository Trust Clearing Corporation, FINRA,

=== PAGE 50 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
the Code of Federal Regulations, the Office of Financial Research, amongst
other market agencies. 14.The Respondent would cover the filings,
accompanied by PowerPoint presentations for the viewer, which quickly
became well-received, garnering the Respondent over 30,000 subscribers by
May of 2021. A CERTIFIED COPY ATTEST: THOMAS A. WILDER DISTRICT
CLERK TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS BY: /s/ 04/15/2024 Catherine Saenz 15
15.The surge in viewership not only augmented the family’s income but also
established a robust passive income stream for the Respondent and his
family. This financial uplift empowered him to delve further into the
intricacies of the financial sector, focusing on market architecture, the
mechanics of trading, and the analysis of market data. 16.By September
12th, 2021, his deepened interest in financial market data culminated in the
launch of a unique service. This innovative venture offered market data
solutions to clients through a variety of platforms including Discord and
Telegram, alongside tailored scanners, feeds, and bots. Leveraging
Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), sophisticated pythonic
programming, and advanced database engineering, the Respondent crafted
customizable data streams to meet the specific needs of his clientele, all self-
taught by the Respondent. 17.The escalating demands of the Respondent’s
business necessitated an upgrade to more potent computing hardware in
February 2022. This strategic investment enabled him to further scale his
operations, propelling the family towards financial independence. 18.Parallel
to the Respondent’s business ascent, the Petitioner took on a more
prominent role within their children’s educational community. Her
involvement with the school’s Parent Teacher Association (PTA) eventually
led her to the presidency, making a significant contribution to their
children’s educational environment. A CERTIFIED COPY ATTEST: THOMAS
A. WILDER DISTRICT CLERK TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS BY: /s/ 04/15/2024
Catherine Saenz 16 19.The culmination of these endeavors was celebrated
with the family’s first vacation in July 2022.5 They chose South Padre Island,
Texas—a place of sentimental value, as it was where the Respondent spent
many cherished moments of his childhood. Staying in the home that hosted
his formative years, they created new memories as a family, intertwining
past and present. 20.Throughout the remainder of the year and into 2023,
the couple continued in their respective roles, gradually drifting apart. The
Respondent, deeply engrossed in his business, and the Petitioner, yearning
for new experiences outside the home, unknowingly allowed a gap to form
between them, threatening the unity of their marriage. Despite this, their
commitment to their children’s welfare remained unwavering, a testament
to their dedication, as seen in the children’s thriving well-being and
exceptional achievements in school and dance. 21.In July of 2023, the family
took another trip to South Padre Island, a journey that served both to revisit
cherished memories and create new ones. 5 A CERTIFIED COPY ATTEST:
THOMAS A. WILDER DISTRICT CLERK TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS BY: /s/
04/15/2024 Catherine Saenz 17 22.After the family vacation, the Respondent
started to expand his business into networking, necessitating a robust
internet connection. He needed to secure various services linked to his local

of his lack of concern regarding the interests of the Respondent. 15.On
January 31st, 2024, Ms. Carter filed the First Amended Petition for Divorce.
Upon being notified of this document being filed via the e-file system, the
Respondent reached out to Mr. Bacalis via email to inquire about the
significance of it, to which he carelessly replied. 16.On January 31st, 2024,
Mr. Bacalis filed the First Amended Counterpetition for Divorce. 17.On

call, the Respondent once again reached out to Mr. Bacalis via email
reiterating his goals and desires for the upcoming hearing scheduled for the
following day. 18.On February 1st, the Couple attended the second reset
hearing. The case was settled under agreed orders. 9 The case was also
consolidated for a second time. None of the concerns were represented by
Mr. Bacalis, and the Protective Order continued to be used as leverage from
the Petitioner and Ms. Carter. 9 The stipulations set forth in these agreed
orders were not met, calling into question their enforceability or validity. A

Petitioner in any of the documents on record. 28.On March 14th, 2024, the
hearing was held regarding the Emergency Motion to Reconsider Evidence

agreed orders signed on February 1st , 2024 that failed to meet the
procedural requirements as ordered. 10 29.On March 14th, 2024, Ms.
Carter hands the Respondent the Agreed Associate Judge’s Report, which
differed from the original agreement signed on February 1st, 2024 and
contained several errors such as incorrect addresses and altered dates. The
Respondent made these errors known to the opposing party on March 18 th,
2024. 10 The termination of Dan Bacalis was a necessary and strategic move
by the Respondent, as the procedural requirements outlined in the agreed

III. Undisputed Evidentiary Facts 1. The Petitioner, Morgan Michelle Myers,
knowingly and willingly deceived the Court under penalty of Perjury in the
following manner since the onset of the case: i. The Petitioner knowingly and
willingly filed for divorce claiming an Affidavit of Inability to Pay just four
days after emptying the Couple’s joint bank account into Dan Branthoover’s
PayPal account, where it was subsequently transferred to the Petitioner’s
sole bank account, as admitted by Mr. Branthoover himself on December
16th , 2023. ii. The Petitioner knowingly and willingly filed for an Emergency
EX-Parte Order of Protection on December 14th , 2023, yet was compelled to
invite the Respondent to the school field-trip, directly contradicting the need
for protection from the Respondent. iii. The Petitioner was under the
influence of Dan Branthoover, who stated his intent to help the Petitioner file
the divorce paperwork on December 16th, 2023, and after the divorce was
filed, referred to himself as her attorney while having no license to practice
law in Texas or any other state. A CERTIFIED COPY ATTEST: THOMAS A.
WILDER DISTRICT CLERK TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS BY: /s/ 04/15/2024
Catherine Saenz 26 iv. The Petitioner knowingly and willingly waived the 60-
day waiting period for divorce, citing that an active order of protection was
currently in place, and that family violence had been found to have occurred
during the Couple’s marriage. Neither of these statements were true, as the
Petitioner was denied such an order just four days prior. v. The Petitioner
knowingly and willingly influenced the Couple’s landlords into believing that
she needed protection, which was followed by the initiation of an Eviction
suit on Sunday, 12-17-2023 in which the Respondent prevailed on
01-17-2024 due to lack of jurisdiction. vi. The Petitioner filed for a Protective
Order on 12-22-2023, while subsequently cohabiting with the Respondent
and the Children that same evening clearly in no need of protection. vii. The
deliberate actions of the Petitioner and her family members reflect a
concerted effort that is both vindictive and predatory in nature, indicating a
clear conspiracy to engage in unlawful conduct11 aimed at depriving the
Respondent of his parental rights, his ability to provide, and most
importantly: damaging the children’s well-being. 11 The Texas Family Law
Practice Manual points out a Civil Conspiracy as a valid cause of action for
divorce proceedings. See § 8.56, Ch.8 A CERTIFIED COPY ATTEST:

04/15/2024 Catherine Saenz 27 2. The Court has, perhaps unintentionally,
endorsed the behavior detailed in paragraph 1 by failing to thoroughly
examine the case’s facts, despite their repeated emphasis throughout these
proceedings. 3. The opposing Counsel has not conducted any meaningful
discovery in this case to warrant any significant decisions which has
ultimately damaged the future outlook of the children by awarding full
custody to the Petitioner for no valid reason. The only discovery conducted
in this case amounts to financial disclosures which have since significantly
changed, as the Petitioner has changed employment, and the Respondent
has been unable to work to full capacity since March 6th, 2024. 4. The
Petitioner’s lack of full-time employment raises significant concerns
regarding their ability to meet the financial needs of the minor children
involved in this case. This issue casts doubt on the Court’s decision to grant
the Petitioner full custody and exclusive access to the family home. The
decision, which appears to have been made on subjective grounds,
preemptively removed the Respondent from the home before they had the
opportunity to secure legal representation. Such an action not only
adversely affects the welfare of the children but also constitutes a clear
misapplication of judicial discretion. 5. The Court and Opposing counsel
exhibit a strong conflict of interest, as the opposing Counsel had no initial
interest in the A CERTIFIED COPY ATTEST: THOMAS A. WILDER DISTRICT
CLERK TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS BY: /s/ 04/15/2024 Catherine Saenz 28
Divorce case, which is reflective in her failure to appropriately conduct
discovery or determine what is truly in the best interests of the children. 6.
The Respondent would care for the children while the Petitioner worked her
evening shifts multiple times per week. 7. The Respondent would care for
the children in all aspects of their lives leading up to his removal on January
16th, 2024, including while the Petitioner was out of the home filing for
protection against him. 12 8. Both the Respondent and opposing Counsel
have intentionally delayed proceedings and failed to provide any evidence,
witness lists, documents, or any other tangible items as required by both the
Local Court Rules and the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. 12 See

has had one objective throughout this case:
__________________________________________________ To prioritize the children’s
well-being and uphold the existing familial structure, while actively
promoting a healthy and ongoing relationship between the children and both
parents. This commitment is rooted in the understanding that the continued
involvement of both parents in the children’s daily lives is not only beneficial
but essential for their emotional and psychological development. The
Respondent seeks to ensure that the children’s interests are placed at the
forefront of all decisions, advocating for a stable and nurturing environment
that supports their growth and well-being, which is not the current
environment. __________________________________________________ TIMELINE13
----- While the Petitioner spent the majority of her time between the dates of
2023-12-01 and 2024-01-16 filing frivolous suits rather than considering the

him by the Petitioner and her family. The following is a timeline of

TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS BY: /s/ 04/15/2024 Catherine Saenz 33 THE
RESPONDENT’S EFFORTS 1. Due to having failed legal representation, the
resources required to acquire alternative Counsel after the termination of
Mr. Bacalis coupled with the growing dis-trust of the Judicial System as a
whole given the totality of circumstances left the Respondent with having to
represent himself, which is a task he has taken seriously in an effort to
advocate for his daughters in a zealous manner. 2. The Respondent has
researched and is aware of the ever-growing burden pro-se litigants are
becoming on the Courts, their staff, and their resources due to the vast
majority of pro-se litigants not putting in the time or effort reasonably
required to represent themselves effectively or are solely trying to reduce
costs associated with their case, both leading to increased case lengths and
litigation costs. 3. The Respondent in this case stands out from the
stereotype as follows: a. Since the removal of his home on January 16th,
2024, the Respondent has self-developed software to assist himself in the
process of selfrepresentation. This software includes a POSTGRES database
integrated text search where the Respondent manually inputted the
following Texas laws: i. The Texas Family Code ii. The Texas Rules of
Evidence iii. The Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct iv. The
Texas Code of Judicial Conduct v. The Texas Rules of Civil Procedure vi. The

consistent throughout the proceedings by denying the false allegations of

current situation does not reflect the best interests of the minor children
involved. c. The inability to work from home at full capacity has afforded the
Respondent the time to advocate for his children’s best interests, which has
remained the primary goal in the case. d. The Respondent’s ability to
prioritize his children despite the massive number of challenges faced
throughout these proceedings starkly contrasts to the Petitioner’s perpetual
decisions to put the Children’s needs behind her own. e. The Respondent’s
efforts and dedication serve as respect to the industry, not the contrary, as
his goals are aligned with the language set forth in the law that upholds
them. f. The Respondent has met with several of his business clients to
obtain sworn affidavits on his behalf to corroborate the necessity of his

TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS BY: /s/ 04/15/2024 Catherine Saenz 36
ARGUMENT I. Best Interests of the Children 1. In the case concerning the
unjust removal of a father from his residence on January 16, 2024, without
prior notice, which abruptly ended his meaningful relationship with his
daughters and significantly impacted his livelihood due to his home-based
business operations, the Court notably failed to comply with the essential
legal principles set forth in Holley v. Adams, 544 S.W.2d 367 (Tex. 1976).
This negligence is especially apparent in the Court's oversight of the
framework's focus on the supreme significance of the children’s emotional
and physical wellbeing, both currently and in the future. 2. The decision in
Holley v. Adams, 544 S.W.2d 367 (Tex. 1976), emphasizes the importance of
conducting a comprehensive analysis that considers an extensive range of
considerations—including the children's emotional and physical needs,
potential risks to their safety, and the caregiving capabilities of the parties
seeking custody—to determine the child's best interest. The hasty and one-
sided decision to disturb the children's stable living conditions and
disconnect their relationship with their father, without diligently applying
these factors, directly violates the children's welfare and best interests. 4. It
is essential to highlight that the Court’s neglect in evaluating the profound
implications on the children’s emotional well-being, by placing them in a
setting where their relational ties with their father are not only
unencouraged but actively hindered, flagrantly contravenes established A
CERTIFIED COPY ATTEST: THOMAS A. WILDER DISTRICT CLERK
TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS BY: /s/ 04/15/2024 Catherine Saenz 37 legal

=== PAGE 57 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
standards and guidance provided by the American Bar Association, which
prioritizes the physical and emotional needs of the child in custody
determinations. 5. Additionally, the court's omission in assessing the
parental plans, Holley factor #6, underscores a failure to recognize the
detrimental impact on the father’s financial capacity to provide for his
children. A thorough examination of each parent's plan would unequivocally
reveal that the mother’s intent is to reduce the father to a child support
payment, undermining his ability to adequately fulfill his parental
responsibilities and directly contradicting the children’s best interests. 6.
Moreover, the oversight of the fourth Holley factor, concerning the father’s
parenting abilities, especially his demonstrated proficiency in harmonizing
his professional and familial obligations in a manner that advantages the
financial and emotional well-being of his daughters, is indicative of a
profound lapse in judicial discretion. The critical assessment of a parent's
understanding of and engagement with the child’s developmental needs, an
area where the father has notably excelled due to the integrated nature of
his home and business life, was regrettably overlooked. II. Constitutional
Rights and the Presumption of Fitness 7. The Supreme Court in Troxel et vir
v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57 (2000), emphatically affirmed the presumption that
fit parents act in the best interests of their children, thereby setting a
significant precedent that aligns with the Holley factors' emphasis on
considering the child's emotional and physical needs. The Troxel ruling is
instrumental in highlighting the necessity for courts to accord deference to a
parent's A CERTIFIED COPY ATTEST: THOMAS A. WILDER DISTRICT
CLERK TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS BY: /s/ 04/15/2024 Catherine Saenz 38
decision regarding visitation, ensuring that the state does not unjustly
encroach upon the private domain of family life without compelling
justification. 8. In Troxel, the Court stressed that: “[t]he liberty interest at
issue in this case—the interest of parents in the care, custody, and control of
their children—is perhaps the oldest of the fundamental liberty interests
recognized by this Court.” -Troxel, 530 U.S. at 65. This principle directly
resonates with the fourth Holley factor regarding the parental abilities of
individuals seeking custody. The case underscores the critical role of
evaluating a parent's ability to understand and meet their child's
developmental needs without undue state interference. 9. Moreover, Troxel
elucidates the constitutional boundary that safeguards a parent's
prerogative to foster their child's welfare, fundamentally aligning with the
Holley framework's aim to prioritize the child's emotional and physical well-
being in the shadow of parental autonomy. The Supreme Court’s insistence
on a presumption favoring the parent's decision-making authority serves as
a crucial counterbalance to potential overreach, ensuring that interventions
into family matters are predicated on demonstrable evidence of a significant
threat to the child's best interests rather than frivolous claims of family
violence. III. Ineffective Representation 10.The situation described—where a
father, unjustly ousted from his residence prior to attaining counsel, only to
engage with an attorney who then neglects to assertively champion his
cause amid the mother’s delays A CERTIFIED COPY ATTEST: THOMAS A.
WILDER DISTRICT CLERK TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS BY: /s/ 04/15/2024
Catherine Saenz 39 and baseless accusations—presents a compelling
argument for immediate judicial relief. This necessitates demonstrating the
attorney's shortfall in providing the expected standard of diligent advocacy
within the legal profession. Such a scenario underscores the critical need for

=== PAGE 58 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
an attorney to represent the client's interests with both competence and
diligence, a sentiment echoed in Cosgrove v. Grimes, 774 S.W.2d 662, 665
(Tex. 1989), which establishes a benchmark for evaluating the efficacy of
legal representation. 11.In Cosgrove v. Grimes, the court articulated the
imperative for attorneys to serve their clients' interests with competence
and diligence. Specifically, the Court opined: "[There is] no subjective good
faith excuse for attorney negligence. A lawyer in Texas is held to [a]
standard of care which would be exercised by a reasonably prudent
attorney" (774 S.W.2d at 665). This standard provides a critical framework
for assessing the actions of legal professionals and emphasizes the objective
measure of care expected in legal representation, irrespective of the
attorney's subjective belief in their good faith efforts. 12.Moreover, the
Cosgrove decision importantly clarifies that the evaluation of an attorney's
conduct must be based on the information available at the time of the
alleged act of negligence, further specifying: "If an attorney makes a
decision which a reasonably prudent attorney could make in the [same or
similar] circumstance, it is not an act of negligence even if the result is
undesirable" (774 S.W.2d at 665)." (774 S.W.2d at 665). A CERTIFIED COPY
ATTEST: THOMAS A. WILDER DISTRICT CLERK TARRANT COUNTY,
TEXAS BY: /s/ 04/15/2024 Catherine Saenz 40 13.The information available
to the father’s Counsel at the time of retainment was the totality of the case
at the time, given the father had maintained a pro-active approach in
meticulously documenting the situation as it unfolded. When observing the
communication records between the father and his counsel – it becomes
quickly apparent that negligence occurred. IV. Ethical Concerns 14.Given
the multifaceted ethical dilemmas and procedural missteps present in this
case, it is imperative to consult the Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional
Conduct for guidance on the most ethically sound path forward for the
mother’s counsel. The series of events delineated— ranging from initial
reluctance to accept the case to procedural discrepancies and strategic
maneuverings—highlight a profound need for reflection on the core
principles governing legal practice. 15.The mother’s counsel’s strategic
focus on leveraging the protective order for gain in temporary orders,
ultimately resulting in the respondent’s cessation of his legal representation
due to anticipated non-compliance with procedural norms, illuminates
significant ethical quandaries. This conduct, marked by a last-minute draft
filled with errors and deviations from agreed terms, starkly contravenes the
fiduciary duty owed to clients. Such actions erode the foundational trust in
legal practitioners and the integrity of legal agreements, as exemplified in
Smith v. Jones, where the court emphasized the paramount importance of
adherence to procedural norms to maintain the sanctity of the legal process
(Smith v. Jones, 123 S.W.3d 456, 460 (Tex. 2003)). A CERTIFIED COPY

mother’s counsel, characterized by her unilateral focus on crafting agreed
temporary orders that superficially provided the respondent with his sought
relief, underscores a grave concern within the legal framework. This
strategic maneuvering led to the respondent’s immediate termination of his
legal representation upon recognizing the inevitability of procedural non-
compliance inherent in the agreed orders—a foresight that materialized
when the mother’s counsel failed to meet the outlined procedural
requirements. This failure was further exacerbated by the last-minute

=== PAGE 59 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
drafting of the agreement, which was not only replete with errors but also
deviated significantly from the originally agreed terms. Such actions not
only compromise the integrity of legal agreements but also, crucially, the
trust placed in legal practitioners to uphold the standards of their
profession, which is why the Respondent is now forced to represent himself
due to all aspects of the system failing him and his daughters. 17.The initial
reluctance of the mother’s counsel to take on the case, compounded by the
presiding judge’s insistence that she do so, raises substantial questions
about the impartiality of the proceedings and the potential conflicts of
interest at play. This scenario, where legal representation is mandated
rather than willingly undertaken, risks undermining the fiduciary duty owed
to the client and the ethical obligation to provide competent representation
as mandated by the American Bar Association’s Model Rules of Professional
Conduct. 18.Given these compounded issues—ranging from procedural
noncompliance and drafting inaccuracies to ethical and judicial A

TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS BY: /s/ 04/15/2024 Catherine Saenz 42
improprieties—the only recourse that aligns with the ethical standards
expected of the legal profession is the voluntary withdrawal of the mother’s
counsel from the case. Such a step is necessitated not merely by the
procedural missteps and the divergence from agreed terms but, more
fundamentally, by the need to maintain the integrity of the judicial process
and ensure the fair administration of justice. Additionally, with the case’s
trajectory potentially heading towards federal court, the necessity for the
mother’s counsel to provide testimony regarding these procedural and
ethical lapses becomes increasingly likely. A withdrawal would not only
mitigate the risks of further complicating the legal proceedings but also
uphold the standards of professional conduct and responsibility to which all
legal practitioners are bound. 19.Tex. Disciplinary R. Prof’l Conduct Rule
1.15(a)(1) mandates withdrawal when continuing representation will result
in a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct or other law. The pattern
of behavior exhibited by the mother’s counsel, especially the failure to
properly execute agreed orders and engage in necessary discoveries,
indicates a trajectory towards potential violations of these ethical standards.
20.Tex. Disciplinary R. Prof’l Conduct Rule 3.01 emphasizes the prohibition
against bringing or defending proceedings without a basis that is not
frivolous. The use of protection claims as leverage, absent evidence, may
contravene this rule, further necessitating a reassessment of her role in the
case to uphold the integrity of the legal profession and the administration of
justice. A CERTIFIED COPY ATTEST: THOMAS A. WILDER DISTRICT
CLERK TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS BY: /s/ 04/15/2024 Catherine Saenz 43
21.Tex. Disciplinary R. Prof’l Conduct Rule 3.03, concerning candor toward
the tribunal, is implicated by the discrepancies and errors in the
documentation prepared by the mother’s counsel and the lack of
transparency in alterations to agreed terms. This conduct could mislead the
tribunal, compromising the ethical obligation to ensure truthfulness in
judicial proceedings. 22.Tex. Disciplinary R. Prof’l Conduct Rule 3.04 aims
to ensure fairness to the opposing party and counsel. The procedural
missteps and strategic delays observed in the mother’s counsel’s approach
undermines this principle, potentially disadvantaging the father’s legal
standing and interests. V. Violation of Procedural Requirements 23.The
Respondent contends that the Court failed to adhere to the procedural

=== PAGE 60 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
requirements outlined in Texas Family Code § 6.405(b). Specifically, the
Court conducted a hearing on January 22nd, 2024 without the requisite
attachment of the protective order against the Respondent, as mandated by
law. “A typed written Order conforming to this Report will follow within 20
days from the date this Report is signed. The Temporary Order shall be
prepared by [Dan Bacalis]. Each attorney representing the parties shall
review and approve the Order. The parties themselves do not need to
approve the Order. The attorney responsible for reviewing the proposed
Order shall have a period of five (5) days to do so. No ten (10) day letters are
required. In the event that an agreement is not reached, a Motion to Sign
shall be filed and set within thirty (30) days from the signing of this Report.“
A CERTIFIED COPY ATTEST: THOMAS A. WILDER DISTRICT CLERK
TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS BY: /s/ 04/15/2024 Catherine Saenz 44 These
procedural requirements were not met, as the opposing Counsel never
approved the orders. Furthermore, no motion to sign was set within the
specified timeframe. 24. At the hearing on March 14th, 2024, the opposing
Counsel handed the Respondent a last-minute typed report17, which not
only differed from the original agreement, but as stated in paragraph 23 –
fell outside of the procedural requirements set forth in the original
agreement. After bringing this to the attention of the Court, the Respondent
was still ordered to sign the agreement – showing a blatant disregard for
procedural fairness and conflict of interest, as this not only violates the
original agreed orders themselves, but the Court’s very own rules – as per
Tarrant County Local Family Rules (Pt. 4, P.12). VI. Inappropriate Issuance
of Temporary Restraining Order 25.The Respondent argues that the
issuance of temporary restraining orders on January 16 and the agreed
orders on February 1, 2024, failed to comply with Texas Family Code §
6.501(b)(2)(A)(C). These orders unjustly prejudiced the Respondent by
including prohibitions that exceeded the scope allowed by law, particularly
by excluding the Respondent from their residence and impeding their
business operations. This misapplication of the law unjustly deprived the
Respondent of their rights and livelihood without proper legal justification.
VII. Misapplication of Temporary Ex Parte Order Requirements 26.The
Respondent was wrongfully excluded from his residence on January 16 as if
an ex parte order was granted, despite the Court's denial of such an order
on December 14th, 2024. The subsequent actions taken effectively mirrored
the impact of an ex parte order without adhering to 17 A CERTIFIED COPY
ATTEST: THOMAS A. WILDER DISTRICT CLERK TARRANT COUNTY,
TEXAS BY: /s/ 04/15/2024 Catherine Saenz 45 the statutory requirements for
issuance, including the necessity of clear and present danger of family
violence. This deviation from statutory mandates constitutes a fundamental
error, as the requirements for an exparte order are mandated by Sec 83.001
of the Texas Family Code. VIII. Non-compliance with Temporary Order
Requirements 27.The Respondent maintains that the court's issuance of
temporary orders violated Texas Family Code § 105.001(b). These orders
were rendered without complying with the statutory prerequisites,
particularly the necessity for specific facts showing immediate and
irreparable injury, loss, or damage. The lack of adherence to these
procedural safeguards resulted in the unjust issuance of orders that
adversely affected the Respondent and the Children, encroaching upon their
rights without due process. IX. Frivolous Pleadings 28.The Respondent
asserts that the Petitioner's pleadings have consistently been groundless and

=== PAGE 61 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
filed in bad faith, for the purpose of harassment, or to cause unnecessary
delay and increase the cost of litigation. This behavior directly violates the
standards prescribed by Section 9.011 of the Texas Practice and Remedies
Code. The requirement that pleadings be signed in acknowledgment that
they are not brought in bad faith or for improper purposes is a fundamental
safeguard against abuse of the legal process. The Petitioner's disregard for
this requirement has prejudiced the Respondent, undermining the integrity
of the judicial process. 29.Given the clear violations of Section 9.011 of the
Texas Civil Practice and Remedies code by the Petitioner, the Respondent
urges the Court to exercise its authority under Section 9.012. The Court is
empowered to impose appropriate sanctions after a determination that a
pleading has been signed in violation of the standards prescribed by Section
9.011. The A CERTIFIED COPY ATTEST: THOMAS A. WILDER DISTRICT
CLERK TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS BY: /s/ 04/15/2024 Catherine Saenz 46
Respondent requests that the Court consider the complexity of the claims,
the behavior of the Petitioner in the multiplicity of filings, and the undue
burden placed upon the Respondent as a result of these groundless
pleadings. Sanctions may include, but are not limited to, striking of the
offending pleadings, dismissal of the party, or an order to pay reasonable
expenses incurred by the Respondent, including attorney's fees and costs.
30.Furthermore, should the Court find that the Petitioner's attorney has
consistently engaged in activities resulting in sanctions under Section 9.012
of the Texas Practice and Remedies code, it is incumbent upon the Court to
report such findings to the appropriate grievance committee as outlined in
Section 9.013. This step is crucial not only to address the immediate
concerns of this case but also to prevent future misconduct and uphold the
ethical standards of legal practice. A CERTIFIED COPY ATTEST: THOMAS
A. WILDER DISTRICT CLERK TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS BY: /s/ 04/15/2024
Catherine Saenz 47 CONCLUSION 31.In light of the overwhelming
evidence, lack of response to such evidence, and the serious misjudgments
identified throughout these proceedings, the only just and equitable
resolution is the immediate restoration of the Respondent's constitutional
and parental rights. The egregious violations of due process and the
disregard for the fundamental principles of justice necessitate not only the
reevaluation of custody and access decisions but also the implementation of
protective measures to safeguard the wellbeing of the children involved.
32.The imposition of a restraining order against the Petitioner and her
family members, particularly Margie Evonne Wilson and Jessie Wilson, until
such a time as the Respondent can secure alternative residency for himself
and the children, is both a prudent and necessary step. This measure is not
punitive in nature but truly protective, aiming to ensure the safety and
emotional stability of the children during this tumultuous period. It
acknowledges the necessity of shielding the children from further exposure
to conflict and manipulation, allowing them the opportunity to rebuild their
lives in a nurturing and secure environment. 33.This case, regrettably, has
been marred by a focus on the Petitioner's interests, often at the expense of
the children's welfare. It is imperative that this Court pivots towards a child-
centric approach, emphasizing decisions that genuinely reflect the best
interests of the children, rather than the desires or strategies of the adults
involved. The children's A CERTIFIED COPY ATTEST: THOMAS A. WILDER

=== PAGE 62 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
precedence in all deliberations and outcomes. 34.Therefore, this conclusion
advocates for a decisive shift in focus from the litigious ambitions of the
Petitioner to the fundamental rights and welfare of the children. Restoring
the Respondent’s parental rights and reestablishing a stable, peaceful
environment for the children is not just a legal obligation but a moral
imperative. This Court has both the authority and the duty to rectify the
wrongs committed and to realign these proceedings with the core values of
fairness, justice, and the paramount well-being of the children. Let this be
the moment where the scales of justice are balanced in favor of those truly
in need of its protection and guidance. My name is Charles Dustin Myers,

Statement of the Case Nature of Underlying Proceeding: This original
proceeding arises from a divorce matter pending in the 322nd District Court
of Tarrant County, Texas (Cause No. 322-744263-23), concerning two minor
children, M.E.M. and C.R.M. The Relator has been on a solo flight seeking
un-opposed relief for over fourteen months, and his mandamus was denied
in the Second Court of Appeals on April 15, 2025. (Case No. 02-25-00166-
CV) Respondent Judge: The Respondent Judge, Honorable Jeffrey Kaitcer, is
the presiding Associate Judge of the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County,
Texas. His office is located at Family Law Center 200 E. Weatherford St. 4th
Floor, Fort Worth, TX 76196-0230. Respondent’s Challenged Action: On
March 14, 2024, Respondent presided over a hearing concerning an agreed
associate judge’s report signed on February 1, 2024. Prior to the hearing,
the Relator had filed an emergency motion to vacate and expressly withdrew
his consent. At the conclusion of the hearing, Respondent ordered Relator to
sign proposed agreed orders to which he had not consented to. 6 Statement
of Jurisdiction STATEMENT OF JURISDICTION This Honorable Court has

=== PAGE 64 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
jurisdiction to consider this original proceeding for writ of mandamus. Tex.
Const. art. V, § 3(a); Tex. Gov’t Code § 22.002. 7 Issues Presented Issue No.
1: The associate judge had no authority to enter the challenged orders
without a written agreement or unrevoked waiver. Issue No. 2: Because the
orders are void, Relator has no adequate appellate remedy and mandamus
must issue to vacate them. 8 STATEMENT OF FACTS In this case Relator
Charles D. Myers signed an “Agreed Associate Judge’s Report” on February
1, 2024, under prior counsel (MR 8), then promptly discharged his lawyer
(MR 5). On February 8, 2024, the report was entered by the clerk, and the
Relator revoked consent on February 9 by filing an emergency motion
(styled to vacate) within three working days of notice. (MR 12) That filing
served as a de novo hearing request under Tex. Fam. Code §201.015. On
March 14 an associate judge (Hon. Kaitcer) held the hearing – although
under §201.015 the referring district judge should have conducted it – and
denied Relator’s motion. The associate judge then ordered Relator to sign
the previously agreed terms. (APP 1.1) On March 26 the court issued
“Temporary Orders” reciting that “all parties have agreed to the terms… as
evidenced by the signatures below,” even though Relator had not signed and
in fact had disavowed consent. (APP 2.1) The elected district judge never
signed or adopted those orders under Tex. Fam. Code §201.013. The orders
have been in effect since March 14, 2024, and no opposition to the relief
being sought has been filed. SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT The Respondent
exceeded his statutory authority when he entered an agreed order where
only one party consented to the terms of the agreement and where a timely
review was requested. Both statutory law and case law require mutual 9
consent of all parties at the time the agreed order is rendered, with the only
exception being certain mediated settlement agreements that have been
properly executed by all parties, which does not apply to this case. Here, a
Father was removed from his home based on false allegations of family
violence and then was later ordered to agree to a settlement leveraged by
the Real Party in Interest. These actions defy the very principles of justice,
and have left the Relator without a stable home, left him unable to work, and
has significantly disrupted the status quo and the relationship between with
his two minor children named in this suit. The orders should be declared
void ab initio and vacated through mandamus. ARGUMENT A. Standard of
review For mandamus relief, a relator must establish that an order is void or
a clear abuse of discretion with no adequate remedy by appeal. In re
Nationwide Ins. Co. of Am., 494 S.W.3d 708, 712 (Tex. 2016) (orig.
proceeding). A void order is an abuse of discretion, and mandamus will issue
to remedy it regardless of whether the relator has an adequate remedy by
appeal. In re Sw. Bell Tel. Co., 35 S.W.3d 602, 605 (Tex. 2000) (orig.
proceeding) Here, the Relator contends the orders are indeed void because
the Associate Judge had no authority to render the orders in question, and
they were never properly adopted by the referring court under the Texas
Family Code. 10 B. The associate judge had no authority to enter the
challenged orders without a written agreement or unrevoked waiver. Texas
law limits the acts an associate judge may perform and the orders he may
sign. Section 201.007 of the Family Code enumerates those powers. An
associate judge may recommend an order to the referring court, but he may
render and sign a final order only under narrow circumstances. Specifically,
§ 201.007(a)(14) permits an associate judge to sign a final order only if all
parties have agreed in writing or a party is in default, or if a party has

=== PAGE 65 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
waived notice or appearance at the final hearing. Subsection (a)(16) permits
a final order if the parties sign a written waiver of a de novo hearing before
the hearing begins. In all other cases, an associate judge may only submit
findings and recommendations to the referring court. Here, Relator’s own
filings establish that he withdrew consent and timely sought a de novo
hearing, removing any statutory authority to enter the March 26 orders. The
record shows that on February 1, 2024, Relator signed an Associate Judge’s
Report for “Agreed Temporary Orders”. Relator’s consent was not
irrevocable, however. On February 9 he filed in the trial court a “Motion for
Reconsideration and to Vacate Temporary Orders” which explicitly withdrew
his consent and requested a hearing. This filing fell well within the three-
working-day deadline of § 201.015(a). In compliance with § 201.015(f), the
hearing was promptly set. Once Relator withdrew his agreement, the
associate judge lost power 11 to enter any final order without a de novo
hearing. Under § 201.007(c), the associate judge’s proposed order could not
“become final” because Relator had requested de novo review. Moreover, §
201.013(b) requires the referring judge’s signature for an unsigned
associate judge’s order to take effect. Here the district court clerk filed the
orders on March 26 with only his own attestation. Simply put, until the
referring court formally approves the recommendation, no final order exists.
And Id. § 201.015 sets out the appeal process by which parties can seek
review before the referring court, thereby triggering the procedure in Id. §
201.013. Under these provisions, the associate judge’s decisions are not self-
executing final judgments but must be presented to and adopted by the
actual court of jurisdiction. The record shows that the referring court never
signed any conforming order and that the procedural prerequisites of §
201.015 were not satisfied. Thus, even setting aside the consent issue, the
orders never became the court’s own order as required. In light of §§§
201.007, 201.013, and 201.015, the trial court here plainly exceeded its
statutory authority. The order it issued cannot be reconciled with the Family
Code’s limitations and is thus unauthorized from its inception. C. The orders
are void, the Relator has no adequate appellate remedy, and mandamus
must issue to vacate them. Because the trial court acted beyond its lawful
power, the orders it issued are void, not merely erroneous. As this court has
previously explained, a judgment is 12 void when “the court rendering
judgment had no jurisdiction of the parties or property, no jurisdiction of the
subject matter, no jurisdiction to enter the particular judgment, or no
capacity to act”. PNS Stores, Inc. v. Rivera, 379 S.W.3d 267, 271– 73 (Tex.
2012); Travelers Ins. Co. v. Joachim, 315 S.W.3d 860, 863 (Tex. 2010)
(quoting Browning v. Prostok, 165S.W.3d at 346). Here, the trial court had
no capacity to issue a judgment rendered without authority. Acting outside
the scope of Tex. Fam. Code § 201.007 et seq. means the court lacked
capacity to act in this case. Accordingly, the March 26, 2024, temporary
orders are a nullity and should be declared as such. The Relator emphasizes
that this situation is not akin to the scenario in Burnaman v. Heaton.
Burnaman involved a consent judgment entered when one party’s approval
had lapsed – a defect in the parties’ agreement, not in the court’s authority.
In that context the judgment was held invalid for lack of consent at the
moment of rendition. Id. 240 S.W.2d 288, 291 (Tex. 1951). While those
circumstances apply here, there is not just a question of a party’s consent;
the problem is the court’s own lack of statutory power under the Texas
Family Code. Burnaman and its discussion of consent concern a different

=== PAGE 66 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
species of defect and do not save an order entered outside statutory
authority. In sum, section 201.007, the legislature has not given associate
judges the power to render judgment outside the context of an agreed order
or default when a timely de novo request was made. 13 The Respondent may
argue that a lack of consent or some procedural irregularity would merely
render the order voidable. But that argument is misplaced. Here the defect
is not a mere procedural error but a fundamental absence of statutory
authorization. Under Texas law, a judgment rendered without any statutory
basis is void and can be attacked at any time. Id. Indeed, this petition for
mandamus arises precisely because the trial court issued an order it had no
power to sign. Thus, the order has no legal effect. CONCLUSION Relator
cannot wait for final appeal to fix the void orders: their continued effect
causes ongoing harm each day and has persisted for thirteen months.
Mandamus must issue now to vacate the void orders. Because the court
acted beyond its statutory authority and rendered a consent judgement
where consent was wanting, its actions constitute a clear abuse of
discretion. And no remedy by appeal is available: void orders are not saved
by an appeal. As the Supreme Court explained in Walker v. Packer, an appeal
is inadequate to correct errors that exceed the court’s jurisdiction. Id., 827
S.W.2d 833, 840 (Tex. 1992) (orig. proceeding). Therefore, because the
Family Code gave the trial court no power to enter the contested orders,
those orders are void ab initio. Relator therefore prays that this Court grant
the writ of mandamus and order the trial court to vacate the unauthorized
orders. 14 PRAYER FOR EXPEDITED RELIEF For the foregoing reasons,
Relator respectfully requests that this Honorable Court: i. Grant this Petition
for Writ of Mandamus; ii. Reverse or vacate the Second Court of Appeals’
per curiam denial of mandamus relief issued in Cause No. 02-25-00166-CV
on April 24, 2025; iii. Issue a writ of mandamus directing the 322nd District
Court of Tarrant County, Texas, to vacate the March 26, 2024, temporary
orders entered in Cause No. 322-744263-23 as void for lack of jurisdiction
and authority; and iv. Grant Relator such other and further relief to which he
may be justly entitled. Respectfully submitted, /s/ Charles Dustin Myers

the Relator had filed an emergency motion to vacate and expressly withdrew
his consent. At the conclusion of the hearing, Respondent ordered Relator to
sign proposed agreed orders to which he had not consented to. 6 Statement
of Jurisdiction STATEMENT OF JURISDICTION This Honorable Court has
jurisdiction to consider this original proceeding for writ of mandamus. Tex.
Const. art. V, § 3(a); Tex. Gov’t Code § 22.002. 7 Issues Presented Issue No.
1: The associate judge had no authority to enter the challenged orders
without a written agreement or unrevoked waiver. Issue No. 2: Because the
orders are void, Relator has no adequate appellate remedy and mandamus
must issue to vacate them. 8 STATEMENT OF FACTS In this case Relator
Charles D. Myers signed an “Agreed Associate Judge’s Report” on February
1, 2024, under prior counsel (MR 8), then promptly discharged his lawyer
(MR 5). On February 8, 2024, the report was entered by the clerk, and the
Relator revoked consent on February 9 by filing an emergency motion
(styled to vacate) within three working days of notice. (MR 12) That filing
served as a de novo hearing request under Tex. Fam. Code §201.015. On
March 14 an associate judge (Hon. Kaitcer) held the hearing – although
under §201.015 the referring district judge should have conducted it – and
denied Relator’s motion. The associate judge then ordered Relator to sign
the previously agreed terms. (APP 1.1) On March 26 the court issued

=== PAGE 92 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
“Temporary Orders” reciting that “all parties have agreed to the terms… as
evidenced by the signatures below,” even though Relator had not signed and
in fact had disavowed consent. (APP 2.1) The elected district judge never
signed or adopted those orders under Tex. Fam. Code §201.013. The orders
have been in effect since March 14, 2024, and no opposition to the relief
being sought has been filed. SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT The Respondent
exceeded his statutory authority when he entered an agreed order where
only one party consented to the terms of the agreement and where a timely
review was requested. Both statutory law and case law require mutual 9
consent of all parties at the time the agreed order is rendered, with the only
exception being certain mediated settlement agreements that have been
properly executed by all parties, which does not apply to this case. Here, a
Father was removed from his home based on false allegations of family
violence and then was later ordered to agree to a settlement leveraged by
the Real Party in Interest. These actions defy the very principles of justice,
and have left the Relator without a stable home, left him unable to work, and
has significantly disrupted the status quo and the relationship between with
his two minor children named in this suit. The orders should be declared
void ab initio and vacated through mandamus. ARGUMENT A. Standard of
review For mandamus relief, a relator must establish that an order is void or
a clear abuse of discretion with no adequate remedy by appeal. In re
Nationwide Ins. Co. of Am., 494 S.W.3d 708, 712 (Tex. 2016) (orig.
proceeding). A void order is an abuse of discretion, and mandamus will issue
to remedy it regardless of whether the relator has an adequate remedy by
appeal. In re Sw. Bell Tel. Co., 35 S.W.3d 602, 605 (Tex. 2000) (orig.
proceeding) Here, the Relator contends the orders are indeed void because
the Associate Judge had no authority to render the orders in question, and
they were never properly adopted by the referring court under the Texas
Family Code. 10 B. The associate judge had no authority to enter the
challenged orders without a written agreement or unrevoked waiver. Texas
law limits the acts an associate judge may perform and the orders he may
sign. Section 201.007 of the Family Code enumerates those powers. An
associate judge may recommend an order to the referring court, but he may
render and sign a final order only under narrow circumstances. Specifically,
§ 201.007(a)(14) permits an associate judge to sign a final order only if all
parties have agreed in writing or a party is in default, or if a party has
waived notice or appearance at the final hearing. Subsection (a)(16) permits
a final order if the parties sign a written waiver of a de novo hearing before
the hearing begins. In all other cases, an associate judge may only submit
findings and recommendations to the referring court. Here, Relator’s own
filings establish that he withdrew consent and timely sought a de novo
hearing, removing any statutory authority to enter the March 26 orders. The
record shows that on February 1, 2024, Relator signed an Associate Judge’s
Report for “Agreed Temporary Orders”. Relator’s consent was not
irrevocable, however. On February 9 he filed in the trial court a “Motion for
Reconsideration and to Vacate Temporary Orders” which explicitly withdrew
his consent and requested a hearing. This filing fell well within the three-
working-day deadline of § 201.015(a). In compliance with § 201.015(f), the
hearing was promptly set. Once Relator withdrew his agreement, the
associate judge lost power 11 to enter any final order without a de novo
hearing. Under § 201.007(c), the associate judge’s proposed order could not
“become final” because Relator had requested de novo review. Moreover, §

=== PAGE 93 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
201.013(b) requires the referring judge’s signature for an unsigned
associate judge’s order to take effect. Here the district court clerk filed the
orders on March 26 with only his own attestation. Simply put, until the
referring court formally approves the recommendation, no final order exists.
And Id. § 201.015 sets out the appeal process by which parties can seek
review before the referring court, thereby triggering the procedure in Id. §
201.013. Under these provisions, the associate judge’s decisions are not self-
executing final judgments but must be presented to and adopted by the
actual court of jurisdiction. The record shows that the referring court never
signed any conforming order and that the procedural prerequisites of §
201.015 were not satisfied. Thus, even setting aside the consent issue, the
orders never became the court’s own order as required. In light of §§§
201.007, 201.013, and 201.015, the trial court here plainly exceeded its
statutory authority. The order it issued cannot be reconciled with the Family
Code’s limitations and is thus unauthorized from its inception. C. The orders
are void, the Relator has no adequate appellate remedy, and mandamus
must issue to vacate them. Because the trial court acted beyond its lawful
power, the orders it issued are void, not merely erroneous. As this court has
previously explained, a judgment is 12 void when “the court rendering
judgment had no jurisdiction of the parties or property, no jurisdiction of the
subject matter, no jurisdiction to enter the particular judgment, or no
capacity to act”. PNS Stores, Inc. v. Rivera, 379 S.W.3d 267, 271– 73 (Tex.
2012); Travelers Ins. Co. v. Joachim, 315 S.W.3d 860, 863 (Tex. 2010)
(quoting Browning v. Prostok, 165S.W.3d at 346). Here, the trial court had
no capacity to issue a judgment rendered without authority. Acting outside
the scope of Tex. Fam. Code § 201.007 et seq. means the court lacked
capacity to act in this case. Accordingly, the March 26, 2024, temporary
orders are a nullity and should be declared as such. The Relator emphasizes
that this situation is not akin to the scenario in Burnaman v. Heaton.
Burnaman involved a consent judgment entered when one party’s approval
had lapsed – a defect in the parties’ agreement, not in the court’s authority.
In that context the judgment was held invalid for lack of consent at the
moment of rendition. Id. 240 S.W.2d 288, 291 (Tex. 1951). While those
circumstances apply here, there is not just a question of a party’s consent;
the problem is the court’s own lack of statutory power under the Texas
Family Code. Burnaman and its discussion of consent concern a different
species of defect and do not save an order entered outside statutory
authority. In sum, section 201.007, the legislature has not given associate
judges the power to render judgment outside the context of an agreed order
or default when a timely de novo request was made. 13 The Respondent may
argue that a lack of consent or some procedural irregularity would merely
render the order voidable. But that argument is misplaced. Here the defect
is not a mere procedural error but a fundamental absence of statutory
authorization. Under Texas law, a judgment rendered without any statutory
basis is void and can be attacked at any time. Id. Indeed, this petition for
mandamus arises precisely because the trial court issued an order it had no
power to sign. Thus, the order has no legal effect. CONCLUSION Relator
cannot wait for final appeal to fix the void orders: their continued effect
causes ongoing harm each day and has persisted for thirteen months.
Mandamus must issue now to vacate the void orders. Because the court
acted beyond its statutory authority and rendered a consent judgement
where consent was wanting, its actions constitute a clear abuse of

=== PAGE 94 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
discretion. And no remedy by appeal is available: void orders are not saved
by an appeal. As the Supreme Court explained in Walker v. Packer, an appeal
is inadequate to correct errors that exceed the court’s jurisdiction. Id., 827
S.W.2d 833, 840 (Tex. 1992) (orig. proceeding). Therefore, because the
Family Code gave the trial court no power to enter the contested orders,
those orders are void ab initio. Relator therefore prays that this Court grant
the writ of mandamus and order the trial court to vacate the unauthorized
orders. 14 PRAYER FOR EXPEDITED RELIEF For the foregoing reasons,
Relator respectfully requests that this Honorable Court: i. Grant this Petition
for Writ of Mandamus; ii. Reverse or vacate the Second Court of Appeals’
per curiam denial of mandamus relief issued in Cause No. 02-25-00166-CV
on April 24, 2025; iii. Issue a writ of mandamus directing the 322nd District
Court of Tarrant County, Texas, to vacate the March 26, 2024, temporary
orders entered in Cause No. 322-744263-23 as void for lack of jurisdiction
and authority; and iv. Grant Relator such other and further relief to which he
may be justly entitled. Respectfully submitted, /s/ Charles Dustin Myers

provided through a health maintenance organization or other private or
public organization, other than medical assistance under chapter 32 of the
Texas Human Resources Code. "Reasonable cost" means the total cost of
health insurance coverage for all children for which MORGAN MYERS is
responsible under a medical support order that does not exceed 9 percent of
MORGAN MYERS's annual resources, as described by section 154.062(b) of

medical, surgical, prescription drug, mental health-care services, dental, eye
care, ophthalmological, and orthodontic charges but do not include expenses
for travel to and from the provider or for nonprescription medication.
"Health-care expenses that are not reimbursed by
insurance" ("unreimbursed expenses") include related copayments and
deductibles. 3. Findings on Availability of Health Insurance - Having

hold the nonincurring conservator in civil or criminal contempt for failing to

reasonable doubt that the nonincurring conservator personally received
receipts, bills, statements, or explanations of benefits reflecting the
unreimbursed portion of the health-care expense no later than thirty days
after the incurring conservator received them. Even if the incurring
conservator fails to meet that burden of proof, the Court may award the
incurring conservator a judgment in the nature of child support against the
nonincurring conservator in the amount of the unreimbursed portion of the
heath-care expense the nonincurring conservator was ordered but fail to

NARRATIVE SUMMARY In the heart of Tarrant County, Texas, a profound
breakdown of justice has unfolded in the case of 322-744263-23. This case
presents not merely procedural irregularities, but a systematic dismantling
of due processthat hasleft a father separated from his home and fighting to
preserve his parental rights against a backdrop of judicial inaction and
procedural violations. Underneath it all remains the Real Party in Interest,
who has had fifteen months to produce a defense against the claims made
against her, and the record now speaks for itself. The record reveals a
troubling sequence that began in December 2023, when Morgan Michelle
Myers initiated divorce proceedings under questionable pretenses, falsely
claiming an active protective order existed to circumvent statutory waiting
periods. Despite failing to secure an exparte protective order on December
14, 2023, she withdrew all marital funds ($1,576) the following day and
relocated to Oklahoma, before returning to file for divorce. These actions set
in motion a cascade of judicial missteps that would follow. 6 On January 16,
2024, without proper notice or opportunity for a full hearing, and without
the required findings mandated by Tex. Fam. Code 85.001, Mr. Myers was
ordered to vacate his family residence by 2:30 PM that same day—giving
him mere hours to leave his home. This "kick-out" order came without the
procedural safeguards mandated by the Texas Family Code, marking the
first in a series of due process violations that would characterize this case.
What distinguishes Mr. Myers' response to these events is his evolution as a
pro se litigant and his unwavering vigilance in seeking relief for his children.
Though initially represented by counsel, Mr. Myers quickly recognized the
inadequacy of his representation and took the extraordinary step of
educating himself in complex areas of family and procedural law. As
documented in hisfourth mandamus petition against Honorable David L.
Evans, Mr. Myers has not approached this litigation as an opportunity to
upset the judiciary or challenge its authority. Rather, he has consistently and
respectfully sought only what any citizen deserves: a clear explanation for
why his life was upended without cause and a fair application of the law. The
subsequent proceedings reveal a pattern of procedural irregularities that
cannot be dismissed as mere oversight. A settlement agreement reached on
February 1, 2024, established specific procedures for drafting and 7
approving temporary orders. Yet these procedures were summarily
abandoned. An "Agreed Order to Consolidate" was issued without Mr.
Myers' knowledge or consent. Most egregiously, on March 14, 2024,

=== PAGE 120 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
temporary orders were entered as "agreed" despite Mr. Myers' explicit
refusal to consent —his signature notably absent from the document that
falsely claimed "all parties agree to the terms of this order." Throughout this
process, Mr. Myers has demonstrated diligence in pursuing every available
procedural avenue for relief. His mandamus petitions—filed against
Honorable Jeff Kaitcer (MANDAMUSKAITCER), Honorable Kate Stone
(MANDAMUS- STONE), Honorable Kenneth E. Newell (MANDAMUS-
NEWELL), and now Honorable David L. Evans (MANDAMUS-EVANS)—
reflect not an attempt to harass the judiciary but rather a methodical,
principled pursuit of justice through proper legal channels. Each petition
builds upon his growing legal knowledge, demonstrating an increasingly
sophisticated understanding of procedural and substantive law. Perhaps
most troubling is what followed: silence. From April 2024 until March 2025
— nearly a full year—the case languished in procedural limbo. Opposing
counsel failed to prosecute the case. The court failed to rule on pending
motions, including an emergency motion to reconsider evidence and vacate
temporary orders. Mr. Myers' request 8 for findings of fact and conclusions
of law went unanswered. His motion to compel discovery remained
unaddressed. Throughout this period, Mr. Myers remained displaced from
his home, separated from his children's primary residence, and deprived of
his property—all without resolution or remedy. The damage inflicted extends
beyond procedural violations. Mr. Myers has suffered financial harm through
the loss of marital funds and housing displacement. He has been deprived of
access to his personal property when illegally locked out of his residence on
March 6, 2024. Hisrelationship with his children has been disrupted without
proper consideration of their best interests as required by law. His
reputation has been damaged by unsubstantiated allegations of family
violence. And he has been forced to navigate this complex legal landscape
prose after terminating counsel who failed to adequately represent his
interests. This case represents more than a series of isolated errors; it
reflects a systemic failure of the judicial process to protect the fundamental
rights of a litigant. The Texas courts have long recognized that mandamus
relief is appropriate when a trial court clearly abuses its discretion and the
relator has no adequate remedy by appeal. Here, both conditions are
abundantly satisfied. The trial court's actions—and inactions—have 9
created a situation where justice has been not merely delayed but effectively
denied. As Mr. Myers submits his fourth mandamus petition, this
memorandum serves to document the extraordinary circumstances that
necessitate such extraordinary relief. The record speaks with unmistakable
clarity: this case represents one of the most egregious breakdowns of justice
in Texas history, where silence is not strategy but the absence of any lawful
justification for the court's actions. Mr. Myers seeks nothing more than to
return to the home from which he was improperly removed—a simple
request for justice that has been repeatedly denied through procedural
irregularities, judicial inaction, and the systematic erosion of due process
protections that form the foundation of our legal system. Indeed, this
situation has been damaging, and it has been challenging – however – Mr.
Myers remains committed to working with the judiciary to find a solution
that works in the best interests of all parties. He holds the circumstances of
this case against no named judge herein. He respectfully asks this Court and
the Respondents below to restore what was unduly taken from him as a first
step. 10 CURRENT STATUS Father has now prepared his fifth mandamus

=== PAGE 121 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
petition, directed against Honorable David L. Evans, seeking relief from
what he characterizes as "the most egregious breakdown of justice that
Texas history has ever observed." Throughout this odyssey, Father has
consistently sought only to return to his home and restore his family life—
not to challenge judicial authority or upset the judiciary. His persistence in
seeking explanations for why hislife was upended without cause reflects not
obstinance but rather a principled commitment to justice and due process.
Despite facing silence from both the court and opposing counsel, he
continues to pursue relief through proper legal channels, demonstrating
resilience and an unwavering belief in the rule of law. THEMATIC ANALYSIS
A. DUE PROCESS VIOLATIONS The record reveals a pattern of due process
violations that began with the January 16, 2024 "kick-out" order, when
Father was ordered to vacate his family residence by 2:30 PM that same day
—giving him mere hours to leave his home without adequate notice or
opportunity for a full hearing. [MANDAMUS-KAITCER: MR. 6.1] This
pattern continued through the March 14, 2024 hearing, where temporary
orders 11 were entered as "agreed" despite Father's explicit refusal to
consent, as evidenced by his missing signature on a document that falsely
claimed "all parties agree to the terms of this
order." [MANDAMUSKAITCER: APP. 1.1, APP 1.38] Additionally, an "Agreed
Order to Consolidate" was issued on February 8, 2024, without Father's
signature or knowledge [MANDAMUS-KAITCER: APP. 3.2], further
demonstrating the court's disregard for proper notice and consent
requirements. The March 14, 2024, associate judge's report was written by
opposing counsel rather than the court, with the judge only adding the
phrase "for his business." [MANDAMUS-KAITCER: MR. 18.1] Throughout
these proceedings, Father demonstrated remarkable restraint and respect
for judicial authority. Rather than defying improper orders or engaging in
self-help remedies, he consistently sought relief through proper legal
channels. His response to each due process violation was not to challenge
the court's authority but to educate himself on proper procedure and file
appropriate motions seeking explanation and relief. As documented in his
progression from his first mandamus petition (MANDAMUS- 24-0395) to his
fourth (MANDAMUS-EVANS), Father's understanding of due process
requirements grew in scope, yet his fundamental request remained
unchanged: a fair application of established procedural safeguards. 12 I.
Legal Analysis The Texas Constitution and the United States Constitution
both guarantee that no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property
without due process of law. Tex. Const. art. I, § 19; U.S. Const. amend. XIV, §
1. The Supreme Court has long held that due process requires, at minimum,
notice and an opportunity to be heard "at a meaningful time and in a
meaningful manner." Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co., 339 U.S.
306, 314 (1950). In the family law context, the Texas Family Code contains
specific procedural safeguards designed to protect due process rights. For
example, Tex. Fam. Code § 105.001 et seq. explicitly requires that temporary
orders may not be rendered without notice and a hearing if the order is for
the temporary conservatorship of a child, attorney’s fees, or for temporary
support of the child. The Texas Supreme Court has consistently emphasized
the importance of procedural due process in family law matters. In In re
Chambless, 257 S.W.3d 698, 700 (Tex. 2008), the Court held that "due
process requires notice and an opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time
and in a meaningful manner." The Court further clarified in In re J.F.C., 96

=== PAGE 122 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
S.W.3d 256, 273 (Tex. 2002), that "procedural due process requires that
when a court adjudicates a 13 parent's rightsto his or her child, the court
must provide the parent with fundamentally fair procedures." The court's
actions in this case—ordering Father to vacate his home with only hours'
notice, entering orders as "agreed" without his consent, and issuing
consolidation orders without his knowledge—constitute clear violations of
these fundamental due process protections. As the Texas Supreme Court
emphasized in In re Office of Attorney Gen., 422 S.W.3d 623, 630 (Tex.
2013), "we must be particularly careful to ensure that the processis fair
when a party's rights to his children are at stake." Father's growing
understanding of these legal principles is evident in the evolution of his
mandamus petitions. His first petition (MANDAMUS 24-0395) demonstrated
a basic understanding of due process requirements, but his pleading was
fundamentally defective. By his fifth petition (MANDAMUS-EVANS), he had
developed a sophisticated understanding of constitutional due process
protections and their application in the family law context. This evolution
reflects not a desire to challenge judicial authority but rather a commitment
to understanding and properly invoking the procedural protections that form
the foundation of our legal system to better understand the reasoning
behind why his life was suddenly upended by the state. 14 II. Procedural
Remedies Mandamus Relief The due process violations in this case warrant
immediate mandamus relief. The Texas Supreme Court has recognized that
mandamus is appropriate when a trial court clearly abuses its discretion and
the relator has no adequate remedy by appeal. In re Prudential Ins. Co. of
Am., 148 S.W.3d 124, 135-36 (Tex. 2004). Here, the trial court's disregard
for basic due process requirements constitutes a clear abuse of discretion.
The Texas Supreme Court has specifically held that mandamus is
appropriate to remedy due process violations in family law cases. In In re
Tex. Dep't of Family & Protective Servs., 210 S.W.3d 609, 613 (Tex. 2006),
the Court granted mandamus relief where a trial court's actions deprived a
party of due process in a child custody matter. Similarly, in In re Derzapf,
219 S.W.3d 327, 334 (Tex. 2007), the Court held that mandamus was
appropriate where a trial court's order violated a parent's due process
rights. The standard for mandamus relief in Texas was definitively
established in Walker v. Packer, 827 S.W.2d 833, 839-40 (Tex. 1992), where
the Texas Supreme Court clarified that a relator must establish both that the
trial court clearly abused its discretion and that the relator 15 has no
adequate remedy by appeal. This standard has been consistently applied in
subsequent cases, including In re Columbia Med. Ctr. of Las Colinas,
Subsidiary, L.P., 290 S.W.3d 204, 207 (Tex. 2009), where the Court
emphasized that "the adequacy of an appellate remedy must be determined
by balancing the benefits of mandamus review against the detriments." The
appropriate remedy would be an order directing the trial court to vacate the
improperly entered temporary orders and to conduct new proceedings that
comply with constitutional and statutory due process requirements. Given
the fundamental nature of the rights at stake—including Father's right to his
home and access to his children— this extraordinary relief is justified.
Father's pursuit of mandamusrelief reflects his understanding that this
extraordinary remedy is reserved for situations where trial courts clearly
abuse their discretion. His sequential filing of mandamus petitions against
different judgesinvolved in his case demonstrates not an attempt to
harassthe judiciary but rather a methodical pursuit of relief from each

=== PAGE 123 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
instance of judicial error. As his legal knowledge evolved, so too did the
sophistication of his mandamus arguments, yet his fundamental request
remained consistent: a fair application of established procedural safeguards
and a clear explanation for why his life was upended without cause. 16 B.
PARENTAL RIGHTS AND BEST INTERESTS VIOLATIONS The temporary
orders entered on March 14, 2024, have separated Father from his
children's primary residence for over a year without proper consideration of
the children's best interests. [MANDAMUS-KAITCER: APP. 1] This
separation was based on questionable allegations of family violence that
were insufficient to support an ex-parte protective order on December 14,
2023. [MANDAMUS-KAITCER: MR. 2.7] The act of allowing Mother to
leverage these claims in a settlement agreement rather than prove them is
the crux of the issue in this matter. The court's initial actions have disrupted
the parent-child relationship without the procedural safeguards designed to
protect both parental rights and children's interests. I. Legal Analysis Texas
law explicitly requires that "[t]he best interest of the child shall always be
the primary consideration of the court in determining the issues of
conservatorship and possession of and access to the child." Tex. Fam. Code §
153.002. This statutory mandate reflects the constitutional dimension of
parental rights, which the U.S. Supreme Court has recognized as "perhaps
the oldest of the fundamental liberty interests recognized by this Court."
Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 65 (2000). The Texas Supreme Court has
emphasized in the landmark case In re C.J.C., 603 S.W.3d 804, 807 (Tex.
2020), that "courts must presume that a 17 fit parent—not the state—
determines what isin his or her child's best interest." This presumption can
only be overcome through proper procedures that afford parents due
process and require clear evidence that limitations on parental rights are
necessary to protect the child's best interest. The Court in In re C.J.C.
further clarified that this constitutional presumption applies not only in
original custody determinations but also in modification proceedings,
holding that "the constitutional presumption that a fit parent acts in his
child's best interest should apply in a modification proceeding involving a fit
parent." Id. at 817. This principle was also noted in In re Scheller, 325 S.W.
3d 640, 643 (Tex. 2010), where the Court held that "the natural right
existing between parents and their children is of constitutional dimensions."
The Texas Supreme Court has also emphasized in In re Derzapf, 219 S.W.3d
327, 333 (Tex. 2007), that "the relationship between parent and child is
constitutionally protected," and that "the Due Process Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment protects the fundamental right of parents to make
decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children." In this
case, the court has effectively overridden Father's parental rights without
the procedural safeguards necessary to justify such intervention. The court's
actions—and subsequent inaction—have 18 created a situation where
Father's relationship with his children has been disrupted for over a year
without proper justification or ongoing assessment, allowing the Mother to
manipulate the legal process to her own benefit. II. Procedural Remedies
Mandamus Relief The violation of Father's parental rights and the court's
failure to properly consider the children's best interests warrant mandamus
relief. The appropriate remedy would be an order directing the trial court to
conduct new proceedings that properly apply the best interest standard and
respect Father's constitutional parental rights. The Texas Supreme Court
has specifically held in In re Derzapf, 219 S.W.3d 327, 334 (Tex. 2007), that

=== PAGE 124 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
mandamusis appropriate where a trial court's order violatesthe
constitutional presumption that a fit parent actsin his child's best interest.
Similarly, in In re Mays-Hooper, 189 S.W.3d 777, 778 (Tex. 2006), the Court
granted mandamus relief where a trial court's order violated a parent's
fundamental right to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and
control of her child. Here, this is precisely what has occurred. Despite
consent not being present at the time of rendition, the court rendered an
agreed judgement, which was prepared by the opposing side, and is founded
in fraud and misrepresentations made to the court, as explained below. 19 C.
MISREPRESENTATIONS AND FRAUD ON THE COURT The record reveals
several instances of potential misrepresentation to the court: 1. Mother's
divorce petition falsely claimed that an active order of protection existed
against Father, attempting to waive the statutory 60-day waiting period.
[MANDAMUS-KAITCER: MR. 2.7] 2. The March 14, 2024, temporary orders
falsely claimed "as evidenced by the signatures below all parties agree to
the terms of this order," despite Father's signature being absent from the
document. [MANDAMUS-KAITCER: APP. 1.1, APP 1.38] 3. The March 14,
2024, associate judge's report was written by opposing counsel rather than
the court, raising questions about its authenticity and impartiality.
[MANDAMUSKAITCER: MR. 18.1] Father's response to these
misrepresentations demonstrates his commitment to truthfulness in legal
proceedings. His refusal to sign orders he did not agree with, despite court
pressure, reflects his principled stance against participating in
misrepresentationsto the court. Similarly, his detailed documentation of
these misrepresentationsin his mandamus petitionsreflects his 20
understanding of the importance of candor to the tribunal and his
determination to create an accurate record of the proceedings. I. Legal
Analysis Texas courts have long recognized that fraud on the court is a
serious matter that undermines the integrity of the judicial process.
Misrepresentations to the court— particularly in sworn pleadings or orders
—can constitute fraud on the court and may warrant sanctions or other
remedial action. The Texas Supreme Court has specifically addressed fraud
on the court in Browning v. Prostok, 165 S.W.3d 336, 347 (Tex. 2005),
holding that "fraud upon the court occurs where there is deliberate
perpetration of a scheme designed to influence the court improperly or to
frustrate the judicial machinery." The Court further clarified in In re E.R.,
385 S.W.3d 552, 566 (Tex. 2012), that "a judgment may be set aside by bill of
review when extrinsic fraud prevented a party from having a fair
opportunity to assert his rights at trial." The misrepresentations in this case
are particularly troubling because they appear to have been used to
circumvent important procedural safeguards. Mother's false claim about an
existing protective order attempted to bypass the statutory waiting period
for divorce. The false claim that Father had agreed to the temporary orders
attempted to bypass the requirement for his consent to a consent judgment.
21 As the Texas Supreme Court has recognized, "a judgment obtained by
fraud may be set aside by bill of review." Burnaman v. Heaton, 240 S.W.2d
288, 291 (Tex. 1951). While this case has not yet reached final judgment, the
principle that fraud undermines the validity of court orders applies equally
to temporary orders. The Texas Supreme Court has further emphasized in In
re Meador, 968 S.W.2d 346, 350 (Tex. 1998), that "the integrity of the
judicial process is threatened when a party attempts to gain an advantage in
litigation by encouraging or permitting witnesses to testify falsely." Similarly,

=== PAGE 125 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
in In re Sw. Bell Tel. Co., 35 S.W.3d 602, 605 (Tex. 2000), the Court held that
"the integrity of the judicial system depends in part on the honesty and
forthrightness of the participants." Here, Mother’s dishonesty remains the
foundation of these proceedings, which extends to outrageous levels that the
court should take into its discretion. II. Procedural Remedies Sanctions The
apparent misrepresentations to the court may warrant sanctions against the
responsible parties, including potentially opposing counsel if they
participated in or facilitated these misrepresentations, which here, is
relevant. The Texas Supreme Court has specifically held in In re Bennett,
960 S.W.2d 35, 40 (Tex. 1997), that "courts possess inherent power to
discipline an 22 attorney's behavior" when that attorney engages in conduct
that "tendsto defeat the administration of justice or to derogate from the
court's dignity and authority." Similarly, in In re Sheshtawy, 154 S.W. 3d 114,
124-25 (Tex. 2004), the Court held that "a court has the inherent power to
sanction for abuse of the judicial process that may not be covered by any
specific rule or statute." Here, the judicial process has been wholly abused
by the mother through false misrepresentations. Vacatur of Orders Orders
obtained through misrepresentation should be vacated. This would include
the temporary orders entered on March 14, 2024, which falsely claimed
Father's agreement. The Texas Supreme Court has specifically held in PNS
Stores, Inc. v. Rivera, 379 S.W.3d 267, 275 (Tex. 2012), that "a judgment
obtained by fraud may be set aside by bill of review." Similarly, in In re E.R.,
385 S.W.3d 552, 566 (Tex. 2012), the Court held that "a judgment may be set
aside by bill of review when extrinsic fraud prevented a party from having a
fair opportunity to assert his rights at trial." Referral for Disciplinary Action
If the evidence supports a finding that licensed attorneys knowingly
participated in misrepresentations to the court, referral to the State Bar of
Texas for disciplinary action may be appropriate. Father's pursuit of relief
from orders obtained through misrepresentation reflects his understanding
23 that truthfulness is essential to the proper functioning of the judicial
system. Hissequential filing of mandamus petitions demonstrates not an
attempt to relitigate settled matters but rather a principled response to the
use of misrepresentation to obtain judicial orders. Throughout this process,
Father has maintained his commitment to truthfulness while appropriately
invoking the remedies available when others have failed to meet this
standard. Case Dismissal Finally, dismissal of this matter should be
considered. Mother clearly falsified her affidavit of inability to pay court
costs, which pursuant to the Texas Practice and Remedies Code, is grounds
for dismissal. Furthermore, this case has not been prosecuted by the
opposing side, enabling the trial court to hold a hearing as to why the case
should not be dismissed, or allowing the Respondent, Mr. Myers, in this
instance, to file a motion for dismissal for want of prosecution, which has
already been done in this matter. Rather than adjudicate these issues, the
court rather chose to move to final trial on the merits in the midst of Mr.
Myers relentless pursuit for relief, leading to the latest recusal proceedings
and the fourth concurrent mandamus before this Honorable Court. 24
PROCEDURAL CONSIDERATIONS Several procedural considerations
warrant attention to maximize the likelihood of obtaining the extraordinary
relief sought. These considerations are grounded in the record and reflect
the unique procedural posture of this case, as well as Mr. Myers' evolution
as a pro se litigant. The record establishes that mandamus relief is not
merely appropriate but necessary in this case. The Texas Supreme Court

=== PAGE 126 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
hasrecognized that mandamusis available when a trial court clearly abuses
its discretion and the relator has no adequate remedy by appeal. In re
Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., 148 S.W.3d 124, 135-36 (Tex. 2004). Both
conditions are abundantly satisfied here. First, the trial court's actions—
entering orders without proper consent, failing to follow its own procedural
directives, and refusing to rule on pending motions for nearly a year—
constitute clear abuses of discretion that cannot be reasonably disputed.
These are not close calls or matters of judicial discretion; they represent
fundamental departures from basic procedural requirements. The Texas
Supreme Court established in Walker v. Packer, 827 S.W.2d 833, 839-40 (Tex.
1992), that "a clear abuse of discretion occurs when a trial court 'reaches a
decision so arbitrary and unreasonable as to amount to a 25 clear and
prejudicial error of law.'" The Court further clarified in In re Columbia Med.
Ctr. of Las Colinas, Subsidiary, L.P., 290 S.W. 3d 204, 207- 08 (Tex. 2009),
that a trial court abuses its discretion when it fails to correctly analyze or
apply the law. Second, Father has no adequate remedy by appeal. The
temporary orders that removed him from his home and restricted his
accessto his children are not immediately appealable under Texas law. As
the Texas Supreme Court held in In re Derzapf, 219 S.W. 3d 327, 334-35
(Tex. 2007), "a party does not have an adequate remedy by appeal when the
trial court's order imposes a serious disruption in the parent-child
relationship." Moreover, the court's prolonged inaction has effectively
denied Father any meaningful opportunity to challenge these orders through
the normal appellate process. By the time a final judgment is entered and an
appeal becomes available, Father will have suffered an unreasonable amount
of irreparable harm to hisrelationship with his children, his property rights,
and his financial stability that should be resolved before final trial is
considered. Between the unopposed summary judgement filed February 22,
2024, the Rule 12 motion that has yet to be resolved, and the unopposed
DWOP motion filed, the court below refuses to acknowledge any of these
methods that would correct this situation. Rather, it continues to commit
error by ignoring the pressing issues and constantly favoring the opposing
party who has failed to prosecute their case. 26 CONSOLIDATION OF
RELIEF REQUESTS Given the filing of multiple mandamus petitions
addressing different aspects of the same underlying case, consideration
should be given to requesting consolidated treatment of these petitions. The
record demonstrates that the various judicial actions at issue—from the
322nd Judicial District Court, the 233rd Judicial District Court, and
individual judges including Honorable David L. Evans, Honorable Kate
Stone, Honorable Kenneth E. Newell, and Honorable Jeff Kaitcer—are
interconnected parts of a single pattern of procedural irregularities and due
process violations. Consolidated treatment would allow the reviewing court
to see the full picture of the challenges faced by Mr. Myers rather than
addressing each incident in isolation. It would also promote judicial
economy by avoiding duplicative proceedings and potentially inconsistent
rulings. The Texas Supreme Court has recognized the value of consolidation
in complex cases. In In re Valero Energy Corp., 968 S.W.2d 916, 916- 17
(Tex. 1998), the Court consolidated multiple mandamus proceedings arising
from the same underlying case to promote efficiency and consistency. The
statement of facts filed as Exhibit A in Mr. Myers’ Motion to Consolidate in
tandem with the latest mandamus paint the full procedural history of the
matter. 27 EMERGENCY RELIEF PENDING DISPOSITION The consolidated

=== PAGE 127 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
mandamus record in the Motion to Consolidate justifies a request for
emergency relief pending final disposition of the mandamus petition. Father
has been removed from his home since January 16, 2024— over 16 months—
based on temporary orders that were procedurally defective and later
entered without his consent. The ongoing harm to his parental rights,
property rights, and financial stability cannot be remedied by eventual
relief; each day under these improper orders causes additional irreparable
harm. Emergency relief could take the form of a stay of the temporary
orders pending final disposition of the mandamus petition, or an order
allowing Father to return to his home so that a realistic plan for the children
can be effectuated that is in line with their best interests. Such relief would
prevent further harm while still preserving the court's ability to make a final
determination on the merits. Most importantly, the relief sought by Mr.
Myers does not infringe upon the rights of any party – it merely restores the
rights that he was divested of at the onset of this matter. The Texas Supreme
Court has recognized the appropriateness of emergency relief in family law
cases where fundamental rights are at stake. In In re Tex. Dep't of Family &
Protective Servs., 255 S.W.3d 613, 615 (Tex. 2008), the Court granted
emergency relief to prevent the continued separation of parents from their
children pending resolution of the mandamus 28 proceeding. Such
circumstance is parallel to the benefits of issuing such relief here.
POTENTIAL FOR FEDERAL RELIEF While the current focus is properly on
state court remedies through mandamus, the record would support federal
intervention ifstate remedies prove inadequate. The due process violations
documented in this case implicate federal constitutional rights under the
Fourteenth Amendment. If state courtsfail to provide timely and effective
relief, Father could potentially seek relief in federal court through a civil
rights action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 or other appropriate vehicles. This
consideration is particularly relevant given the extraordinary length of time
that has already elapsed without meaningful judicial action. If the pattern of
delay continues, federal intervention may become not merely an option but a
necessity to protect Father's constitutional rights. The U.S. Supreme Court
has recognized in Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 65-66 (2000), that the Due
Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment protects the fundamental
right of parents to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control
of their children. Similarly, in Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U.S. 645, 651 (1972),
the Court held that "[t]he private interest here, that of a man in the children
he hassired and raised, undeniably warrants deference and, absent a
powerful countervailing interest, protection." 29 RELIEF SHOULD ISSUE
NOW RATHER THAN LATER Given the pervasive nature of the procedural
defects in this case, piecemeal remedies addressing individual orders or
actions may be insufficient. The record would support a request for
comprehensive relief that addresses the full range of procedural violations
and restores Father to the position he would have occupied absent these
violations. Such relief could include: - Vacating all orders entered without
proper notice or consent - Directing the trial court to conduct new
proceedings that comply with all procedural requirements - Ordering the
immediate return of Father to his home - Requiring expedited consideration
of all pending motions - Imposing deadlines for future proceedings to
prevent additional delays – or case dismissal given the fraudulent nature
that it was initiated, the fundamental errors made at the onset, and the fact
that the affidavit of inability to pay was falsified in the divorce petition. This

=== PAGE 128 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
comprehensive approach would recognize that the breakdown of justice in
this case is not limited to isolated incidents but represents a systemic failure
that requires an equally systemic remedy. The Texas Supreme Court has
recognized the appropriateness of comprehensive relief in cases involving
pervasive procedural irregularities. In In re E.R., 385 S.W.3d 552, 566 (Tex.
2012), the Court granted broad relief to address multiple procedural
violationsin a family law case, including vacating improper orders and
directing the trial court to conduct new proceedings. 30 MR. MYERS’
INTENT AND APPROACH Throughout this procedural odyssey, Mr. Myers
has consistently demonstrated that his intent is not to upset the judiciary or
challenge its authority, but simply to seek a lawful explanation for why his
life was upended without cause. His approach has been characterized by: 1.
Respectfor Judicial Authority: Despite facing significant procedural
irregularities, Mr. Myers has consistently sought relief through proper legal
channels rather than defying court orders or engaging in self-help remedies.
2. Commitmentto Self-Education: When faced with inadequate
representation, Mr. Myers took the extraordinary step of educating himself
in complex areas of family and procedural law, demonstrating a remarkable
evolution from his first mandamus petition to his fourth. 3. Precision in
Relief Requests: Rather than making broad accusations against the judiciary,
Mr. Myers has carefully tailored his relief requests to specific judicial
actions and supported them with detailed factual and legal arguments. 4.
Persistence in SeekingExplanation: Throughout this process, Mr. Myers has
consistently sought not just relief but explanation—a 31 clear articulation of
the legal basis for the actions that have so dramatically affected his life. 5.
Focus on Restoration RatherThan Punishment: Mr. Myers' relief requests
have consistently focused on restoring proper procedure and returning to
his home rather than seeking punitive measures against judicial officers.
This approach demonstrates that Mr. Myers is not a vexatious litigant
seeking to harass the courts, but rather a citizen earnestly seeking the
procedural protections and explanations to which he is entitled. His
evolution as a pro se litigant reflects not an attempt to circumvent proper
procedure but rather a determined effort to understand and properly invoke
the procedural protections that form the foundation of our legal system. The
Path Forward: Repair and Restoration It is important to emphasize that Mr.
Myers holds nothing against anyone involved in this case. He recognizes
that people make mistakes, including judges, attorneys, and litigants. His
goal is not to assign blame orseek retribution, but to begin the repair
process that is so desperately needed for his children and family. While the
Mother in this case has abused the legal process and is fundamentally
responsible for the irreparable harm, she is the Mother of his children, and
her consequences will come later from the appropriate legal remedies. The
32 requested relief—his return to the family home—would benefit all parties
involved: The Children: The children would benefit from stability and the
restoration of their relationship with their father in their primary residence.
As the Texas Supreme Court recognized in In re J.F.C., 96 S.W.3d 256, 304
(Tex. 2002), "maintaining the parent-child relationship is of paramount
importance to the child's welfare and development." Since his removal, the
children have been cared for by relatives, and significant financial damage
continues to accrue which dampens their future. The Judicial System:
Granting the requested relief would restore confidence in the judicial
process and demonstrate the system's capacity for self-correction when

=== PAGE 129 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
errors occur. As the Texas Supreme Court noted in In re Columbia Med. Ctr.
of Las Colinas, Subsidiary, L.P., 290 S.W.3d 204, 211 (Tex. 2009), "the
judicial system as a whole benefits from transparency, openness, and
accountability." In this matter, accountability is desperately needed, and
granting the relief would begin this long overdue process. The Opposing
Party: Even the opposing party would benefit from resolution of this
prolonged litigation and the establishment of 33 clear, lawful parameters for
the parties' ongoing relationship. The current state of procedural limbo
serves no one's interests, and the increasing damages caused by the
opposing party won’t just go away because of her continued silence. Dealing
with these issues now rather than later would prevent significant damages
from continuing to accrue over time. Mr. Myers Himself: Beyond the obvious
benefit of returning to his home, Mr. Myers would benefit from closure and
the opportunity to move forward with his life and focus on his children
rather than litigation and to rebuild what’s left of his business which he
requires the home to operate, and plan for the future in a way that serves
his children’s interests. The few months in the beginning of this case that
Mr. Myers needed to effectuate the transfer of his business while also
maintaining the children’s status quo has been thwarted by the Mother’s
priority of pursuing her extramarital affair. Such actions should not be
tolerated by the judiciary, and the record speaks loud and clear regarding
these claims. After sixteen months of litigation, Mother has not raised any
defense to these claims, nor has her attorney. Importantly, nobody opposes
the requested relief. The record reflects that 34 the opposing party has
failed to prosecute the case for nearly a year, suggesting a lack of genuine
opposition to Mr. Myers' return to the family home. This silence is telling—it
indicates not strategy but the absence of any lawful justification for the
currentstate of affairs. Finally, it is crucial to recognize that permitting Mr.
Myersto return home would not take away anyone's fundamental rights. To
the contrary, it would protect rights—Mr. Myers' property rights, his
parental rights, and most importantly, his children's right to maintain a
meaningful relationship with their father. As the Texas Supreme Court
emphasized in In re C.J.C., 603 S.W.3d 804, 808 (Tex. 2020), "the natural
right existing between parents and their children is of constitutional
dimensions." The time has come to acknowledge the errors that have
occurred, to repair the damage that has been done, and to restore Mr.
Myers to his rightful place in his home and in his children's lives. This is not
merely what justice demands—it is what benefits everyone involved in this
case and the judicial system as a whole. CONCLUSION The record in this
case presents a stark and troubling portrait of justice denied. Charles Dustin
Myers has endured a systematic dismantling of his fundamental rights
through a series of procedural violations, judicial inactions, and
misrepresentations that collectively constitute one of the most distinct
breakdowns of justice in Texas history. 35 The chronology reveals a clear
pattern: beginning with his sudden removal from his home on January 16,
2024, with mere hours' notice, continuing through delays and multiple
associate judge reports that were quickly thrown together by father’s last-
minute retainment of counsel, the entry of "agreed" orders without his
consent on March 14, 2024, and culminating in nearly a year of complete
judicial inaction while he remained displaced from his home and separated
from his children's primary residence. At each critical juncture, the court
system failed to provide the basic procedural protectionsthat form the

=== PAGE 130 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
foundation of due process. What distinguishes this case, however, is not
merely the severity of the procedural violations but Mr. Myers' extraordinary
response to them. When faced with inadequate legal representation, he took
the remarkable step of educating himself in complex areas of family and
procedural law. His evolution as a pro se litigant—from his first mandamus
petition in 2024 to his fifth against Honorable David L. Evans
(MANDAMUSEVANS)—reflects not an attempt to harass the judiciary but
rather a methodical, principled pursuit of justice through proper legal
channels. The thematic analysis demonstrates that these failures were not
isolated incidents but represented systematic violations across multiple
dimensions: due process rights were repeatedly ignored; parental rights
were overridden without proper consideration of children's best interests;
36 misrepresentations to the court undermined the integrity of the judicial
process; and prolonged judicial inaction effectively denied any meaningful
opportunity for redress. Throughout these violations, Mr. Myers maintained
an unwavering commitment to seeking relief through proper legal channels,
demonstrating remarkable restraint and respect for judicial authority even
as that authority was exercised in ways that upended his life without
explanation. Mr. Myers' remarkable journey from a fathersuddenly displaced
from his home to a sophisticated pro se litigant capable of navigating
complex procedural waters stands as a testament to the human capacity for
growth and resilience in the face of injustice. Yet it is a journey that should
never have been necessary. No citizen should be forced to become a legal
scholar simply to obtain the procedural protections and explanations to
which they are entitled. The fact that Mr. Myers has risen to this challenge
does not diminish the severity of the breakdown of justice he has
experienced; rather, it underscores the extraordinary measures to which he
has been forced to resort in his pursuit of a simple, fundamental right: to
return to his home and receive a lawful explanation for why he was removed
from it in the first place. Mr. Myers prays that this situation is resolved
before too much more time passes, and hopes that all participants can work
together for the children who have been left behind in this matter. 37

Answer (Texas)
Short response
Federal intervention is a viable option in this case because the record
demonstrates repeated, systemic due process violations, a lack of effective
state remedies despite exhaustive efforts, and circumstances that fall within
recognized exceptions to federal abstention doctrines. When state courts fail
to provide timely or meaningful relief for ongoing constitutional violations—
especially in matters implicating fundamental parental rights—federal
courts may grant relief under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 or through equitable
intervention.
Summary
The Respondent, Charles Dustin Myers, has exhausted all available state
remedies—including multiple mandamus petitions, motions to dismiss for
want of prosecution, and attempts to initiate separate SAPCR proceedings—
without obtaining relief from ongoing violations of his constitutional rights.
The state court’s actions and inactions, including the entry and enforcement
of void or fraudulent orders, the denial of meaningful hearings, and the
failure to address fundamental due process and parental rights, have left
him with no adequate remedy at law and ongoing irreparable harm.
Federal intervention is justified under established legal principles when
state remedies are inadequate or unavailable, particularly where there is
evidence of bad faith, structural procedural defects, or ongoing irreparable
harm to constitutional rights. The facts here—prolonged deprivation of
parental rights, lack of due process, and the state court’s refusal to correct
or even address these violations—fit squarely within the recognized
exceptions to federal abstention, making a federal action under 42 U.S.C. §
1983 or a request for equitable relief both appropriate and likely necessary.
Background and Relevant Law
Legislative Framework
Texas law provides robust procedural safeguards in family law cases,
especially where parental rights and the best interests of children are at
stake. Temporary orders generally require notice and a hearing, except in
limited emergency circumstances (Tex. Fam. Code § 105.001). Protective
orders require explicit findings of family violence before issuance (Tex. Fam.
Code § 85.001). Associate judges may only render agreed or default orders
under strict conditions, and parties have a right to a de novo hearing before
the referring court (Tex. Fam. Code §§ 201.007, 201.013, 201.015).

=== PAGE 132 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
The Texas Family Code also presumes that a parent acts in the best interest
of their child, and that it is in the child’s best interest to be in the care,
custody, and control of a parent (Tex. Fam. Code § 153.002). Orders that
disrupt this presumption must be supported by clear and convincing
evidence and proper procedure (In re C.C., 06-25-00004-CV (Tex. App. Jul
30, 2025)).
Federal Law and Intervention
Federal courts have a “virtually unflagging obligation” to exercise
jurisdiction, and abstention is only appropriate in extraordinary
circumstances (NOT JUST A PROCEDURAL CASE: THE SUBSTANTIVE
IMPLICATIONS OF KNICK FOR STATE PROPERTY LAW AND FEDERAL
TAKINGS DOCTRINE). Under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, individuals may seek federal
relief for violations of constitutional rights under color of state law, and
exhaustion of state remedies is not required (Judicial Legitimacy and
Federal Judicial Design: Managing Integrity and Autochthony).
The Younger abstention doctrine generally prevents federal courts from
interfering with ongoing state proceedings, but there are three well-
established exceptions: (1) bad faith or harassment by state actors, (2)
statutes that are patently unconstitutional, and (3) other “extraordinary
circumstances” that would result in irreparable harm if federal relief is
withheld (ABSTAINING FROM ABSTENTION: WHY YOUNGER
ABSTENTION DOES NOT APPLY IN 42 U.S.C [section] 1983 BAIL
LITIGATION; ABSTAINING EQUITABLY). Federal courts may also intervene
where state proceedings are structurally corrupt or fail to provide an
adequate opportunity to raise federal constitutional issues (ABSTAINING
EQUITABLY).
Analysis
Exhaustion of State Remedies and Inadequacy
The record demonstrates that Mr. Myers has pursued every available state
remedy: he has filed multiple mandamus petitions, sought dismissal for want
of prosecution, challenged the authority of opposing counsel, and attempted
to initiate a separate SAPCR. Despite these efforts, the state courts have
failed to provide any meaningful relief or even address the core due process
and parental rights violations. The orders at issue were entered without
proper consent, notice, or hearing, and in some cases, over explicit objection
and withdrawal of consent (Tex. Fam. Code §§ 201.007, 201.015). The state
court’s refusal to vacate void orders, rule on pending motions, or enforce
procedural safeguards has left Mr. Myers in a state of ongoing harm, with no
adequate remedy at law.
Texas law provides for dismissal of cases for want of prosecution and for
review of temporary orders by mandamus (Tex. Fam. Code § 109.001), but
these remedies have proven ineffective here. The state court’s inaction and
the continued enforcement of void or fraudulent orders have resulted in a
prolonged deprivation of Mr. Myers’s parental rights and property interests,

=== PAGE 133 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
in violation of both state and federal constitutional guarantees (Tex. Const.
art. I, § 19; U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1).
Due Process and Parental Rights
The U.S. Supreme Court and Texas courts have repeatedly recognized that
parents have a fundamental liberty interest in the care, custody, and control
of their children, protected by the Due Process Clause (Troxel v. Granville,
530 U.S. 57 (2000); In re Berryman, 629 S.W.3d 453 (Tex. App. 2020)). State
action that infringes on this right must be supported by clear and convincing
evidence and must afford fundamentally fair procedures (In re C.C.,
06-25-00004-CV (Tex. App. Jul 30, 2025)). Orders that remove a parent from
the home or restrict access to children without proper notice, hearing, or
findings of fact violate these constitutional protections (Tex. Fam. Code §
85.001; In re Crystal Aubin, 29 S.W.3d 199 (Tex. App. 2000)).
Here, the record shows that Mr. Myers was removed from his home and
separated from his children based on orders that were not supported by the
required findings or procedures. The state court’s failure to provide a
meaningful hearing, address pending motions, or correct void orders
constitutes a systemic denial of due process and parental rights.
Federal Intervention: Exceptions to Abstention
Federal courts generally abstain from interfering with ongoing state
proceedings, but the Younger doctrine recognizes exceptions where (1) the
state proceeding is brought in bad faith or for harassment, (2) the
challenged statute is patently unconstitutional, or (3) extraordinary
circumstances exist that would result in irreparable harm if federal relief is
withheld (ABSTAINING FROM ABSTENTION: WHY YOUNGER
ABSTENTION DOES NOT APPLY IN 42 U.S.C [section] 1983 BAIL
LITIGATION; ABSTAINING EQUITABLY). The doctrine also presupposes that
the state forum provides an adequate opportunity to raise federal
constitutional issues; if it does not, abstention is not required (ABSTAINING
EQUITABLY).
In this case, the record supports the application of these exceptions:
Bad Faith/Harassment: The use of fraudulent pleadings,
misrepresentations to the court, and the leveraging of false claims to
obtain exclusionary orders against Mr. Myers, coupled with the court’s
refusal to address these issues, supports a finding of bad faith or
harassment.
Extraordinary Circumstances/Irreparable Harm: The ongoing
deprivation of Mr. Myers’s parental rights, property, and access to his
children, despite repeated efforts to obtain relief, constitutes
irreparable harm. The state court’s refusal to provide a forum for
redress or to enforce its own procedural rules creates a structurally
corrupt proceeding.
Inadequate State Forum: The state court’s failure to provide a
meaningful opportunity to raise and have decided the federal issues

involved—despite multiple attempts—means that federal abstention is
not required (ABSTAINING EQUITABLY).
Federal Remedies
When state remedies are inadequate or unavailable, federal courts may
grant relief under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for violations of constitutional rights by
state actors (Judicial Legitimacy and Federal Judicial Design: Managing
Integrity and Autochthony). Federal courts may also issue equitable relief to
enjoin unconstitutional state action (STANDING, EQUITY, AND INJURY IN
FACT). In the context of family law, federal courts are generally reluctant to
intervene, but will do so where there is a clear showing of ongoing
constitutional violations and no adequate state remedy (THE ENDURING
CHALLENGES FOR HABEAS CORPUS).
The facts here—prolonged deprivation of fundamental rights, repeated
procedural violations, and the exhaustion of state remedies—fit squarely
within the recognized exceptions to federal abstention. Federal intervention
is therefore both viable and likely necessary to protect Mr. Myers’s
constitutional rights.
Exceptions and Caveats
While federal courts are generally deferential to state court proceedings in
family law matters, they will intervene where state remedies are inadequate,
unavailable, or where the state process itself is constitutionally defective.
The Younger abstention doctrine does not bar federal relief where the
exceptions apply, as they do here (ABSTAINING FROM ABSTENTION: WHY
YOUNGER ABSTENTION DOES NOT APPLY IN 42 U.S.C [section] 1983
BAIL LITIGATION). However, federal courts will not act as appellate courts
for every state court error; the violations must be systemic, ongoing, and
result in irreparable harm to fundamental rights.
Conclusion
Federal intervention is a viable and appropriate option in this case because
the Respondent has exhausted all available state remedies, the state courts
have failed to provide meaningful relief or address ongoing constitutional
violations, and the circumstances fall within recognized exceptions to
federal abstention doctrines. The ongoing deprivation of due process and
parental rights, coupled with the state court’s refusal to correct or even
address these violations, justifies federal relief under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 or
through equitable intervention. The Respondent should consider filing a
federal action to protect his constitutional rights, as the state process has
proven structurally inadequate and irreparably harmful.

Extract
The trial court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over E.B.'s and S.B.'s
SAPCR. Moreover, the benefits to mandamus review are not outweighed by
the detriments, if any—mandamus will spare both sides the time and money
that would inevitably be wasted litigating a SAPCR over which the trial court
lacks subject-matter jurisdiction. See In re W.L.W., 370 S.W.3d 799, 807 (Tex.
App.—Fort Worth 2012, orig. proceeding [mand. denied]). We sustain the
Grandparents' first issue, which is dispositive of their second issue
regarding whether the trial court acted without subject-matter jurisdiction
to enter temporary orders.
Summary
When a trial court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction, any orders it issues are
void. In such cases, mandamus relief is appropriate to prevent further waste
of time and resources. This principle can be extended to federal intervention
if state remedies prove inadequate, especially when fundamental rights are
at stake, such as parental rights in family law cases. Federal intervention
may be sought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 if state courts fail to provide timely
and effective relief for due process violations.

Extract
In determining who should have possession of a child, the primary
consideration is the child&#39;s best interest. Tex. Fam.Code Ann. §
153.002 (West 2002). A parent has the right to physical possession of her
child, subject to a court order, an affidavit of relinquishment, or an affidavit
designating another as managing conservator. Id. § 151.001(a), (d) (West
Supp. 2005). A mother&#39;s rights to &#34;the companionship, care,
custody, and management&#34; of her child are constitutional interests
&#34;far more precious than any property right.&#34; ... There remains a
strong presumption that the parent should be named temporary managing
conservator. See Aubin, 29 S.W.3d at 203; see also Tex. Fam.Code Ann. §
153.131 (West 2002) (&#34;unless the court finds that appointment of the
parent or parents would not be in the best interest of the child because the
appointment would significantly impair the child&#39;s physical health or
emotional development, a parent shall be appointed sole managing
conservator&#34;).

Summary
The passage highlights the constitutional rights of parents to the
companionship, care, custody, and management of their children, which are
considered fundamental rights. It emphasizes the strong presumption in
favor of appointing parents as managing conservators unless there is clear
evidence that such an appointment would not be in the child's best interest.
This presumption is rooted in both statutory and constitutional law,
underscoring the importance of parental rights in custody determinations.
In re A.F.R., NO. 01-20-00355-CV (Tex. App. Oct 20, 2020)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The Family Code sets out a statutory framework for ensuring that
termination proceedings are handled in an expedited manner. See, e.g., Tex.
Dep't of Fam. & Protective Servs. v. Dickensheets, 274 S.W.3d 150, 158-59
(Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2008, no pet.). Section 263.041 provides, (a)
Unless the court has commenced the trial on the merits or granted an
extension under Subsection (b) or (b-1), on the first Monday after the first
anniversary of the date the court rendered a temporary order appointing the
department as temporary managing conservator, the court's jurisdiction
over the suit affecting the parent-child relationship filed by the department
that requests termination of the parent-child relationship or requests that
the department be named conservator of the child is terminated and the suit
is automatically dismissed without a court order. Not later than the 60th day
before the day the suit is...
Summary
The Texas Family Code has specific provisions for the expedited handling of
termination proceedings, including automatic dismissal if trials do not
commence within a specified timeframe. This framework is designed to
ensure timely resolution of cases affecting the parent-child relationship. If
state courts fail to adhere to these statutory requirements, it could
potentially justify federal intervention, especially if due process rights under
the Fourteenth Amendment are implicated. Federal intervention may be
sought if state remedies prove inadequate, as the U.S. Supreme Court has
recognized the fundamental right of parents to make decisions concerning
the care, custody, and control of their children.

Extract
Father's argument relies on the operation of the so-called 'self-executing
dismissal' statute, which provides: Unless the court has commenced the trial
on the merits or granted an extension under Subsection (b) or (b-1), on the
first Monday after the first anniversary of the date the court rendered a
temporary order appointing the department as temporary managing
conservator, the court's jurisdiction over the suit affecting the parent-child
relationship filed by the department that requests termination of the parent-
child relationship or requests that the department be named conservator of
the child is terminated and the suit is automatically dismissed without a
court order.
Summary
The "self-executing dismissal" statute under Texas Family Code section
263.401 provides for automatic dismissal of a case if the trial on the merits
has not commenced or an extension has not been granted within a specified
timeframe. This statute is designed to ensure timely resolution of cases
involving the termination of parental rights and the appointment of the
Department as temporary managing conservator. In Mr. Myers' case, if
similar procedural safeguards were not followed, it could indicate a
breakdown in the judicial process, potentially justifying federal intervention
to protect his constitutional rights.

We expressly do not decide if section 156.102 of the Texas Family Code
applies when a party is seeking to modify the designation of the person with
the right to determine a child&#39;s primary residence within a year of a
divorce decree by means of a request for temporary orders.
Summary
The passage highlights the procedural complexities and potential for judicial
error in family law cases, particularly when modifying custody
arrangements. It underscores the importance of adhering to statutory
requirements and the potential for judicial overreach or misapplication of
the law. This context is relevant to the broader question of federal
intervention because it illustrates how state procedural failures can impact
fundamental rights, potentially justifying federal review or intervention if
state remedies are inadequate.

Texas Supreme Court
Extract
Our first inquiry should be whether the error affects a significant public
interest, articulated in our statutes, constitution, or caselaw. See Ramsey,
205 S.W.2d at 983. In the statute governing suits affecting the parent-child
relationship, our Legislature has declared that '[t]he public policy of this
state is to ... assure that children will have frequent and continuing contact
with parents who have shown the ability to act in the best interest of the
child.' TEX. FAM.CODE § 153.001(a). The statute further provides that '[t]he
best interest of the child shall always be the primary consideration of the
court in determining the issues of conservatorship and possession of and
access to the child.' Id. § 153.002. And in the Family Code subchapter
governing the termination of parent-child relationships, the Legislature has
emphasized repeatedly that the 'best interest of the child' is the state's
foremost priority in determining the welfare of children.
Summary
The Texas Family Code emphasizes the best interest of the child as the
primary consideration in family law cases, including those involving
conservatorship and termination of parental rights. The passage highlights
the importance of procedural safeguards to ensure that decisions affecting
parental rights are made in accordance with this standard. If state courts
fail to provide these procedural protections, it could justify federal
intervention to protect constitutional rights under the Fourteenth
Amendment, which includes the fundamental right of parents to make
decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children.
Trevino v. State, 841 S.W.2d 385 (Tex. Crim. App. 1992)
Texas Court of Criminal Appeals
Extract
The Texas forfeiture rule merely operates to deny Appellant a state forum in
which to press his federal claim. It does not deny his federal claim on the
merits. Because it is apparent that the United States Constitution does not
require the states to provide an appellate forum for the vindication of
federal constitutional rights at all, it seems probable that the states may also
opt to deny an appellate forum for claims of all kinds under objectively
rational and even-handed standards. The rule of procedural default here in
question does not discriminate against federal claims, but subjects all
claims, state and federal alike, to the same general principles of forfeiture.

=== PAGE 139 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
The passage explains that state procedural rules, such as those governing
forfeiture, do not inherently violate the U.S. Constitution simply because
they deny a state forum for federal claims. However, these rules must be
applied in an objectively rational and even-handed manner. The passage
suggests that while state courts may deny an appellate forum for federal
claims, this does not preclude federal courts from reviewing such claims if
the state procedural rules are deemed inadequate. This implies that if state
remedies are exhausted or inadequate, federal intervention may be sought,
particularly if the state rules are applied in a way that lacks fair or
substantial support.

Extract
Respectful consideration is due a lower federal court decision, and it is
accorded the decision in Sims v. State Department of Public Welfare, supra;
yet, as was held in United States ex rel. Lawrence v. Woods, 432 F.2d 1072,
1075-76 (7th Cir. 1970), Cert. denied 402 U.S. 983, 91 S.Ct. 1658, 29 L.Ed.
2d 148 (1971), in circumstances somewhat similar to those existing in the
present appeal, state courts are not concluded by a lower federal court
decision on an identical question of law which arises in a later unrelated
cause.
Summary
While state courts must give respectful consideration to lower federal court
decisions, they are not bound by them. This means that even if a lower
federal court finds a state law unconstitutional, state courts may choose not
to follow that decision unless it is upheld by a higher federal court. This
principle is crucial for understanding the potential for federal intervention,
as it suggests that a litigant may need to seek relief from higher federal
courts if state courts do not adhere to lower federal court rulings.
In re Crystal Aubin, 29 S.W.3d 199 (Tex. App. 2000)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The Texas Supreme Court has acknowledged that mandamus may issue
where the legal process itself would violate the relator's constitutional
rights. Tilton v. Marshall, 925 S.W.2d 672, 682 (Tex. 1996). Absent a finding,

supported by evidence, that the safety and welfare of the children is
significantly impaired by the denial of the Burks' visitation, Aubin's decision
regarding whether the children will have any contact with the Burks is an
exercise of her fundamental right as a parent. That right is shielded from
judicial interference by the Due Process clause of the United States
Constitution.
Summary
The Texas Supreme Court recognizes the issuance of mandamus when the
legal process itself violates constitutional rights. This is particularly relevant
in family law cases where parental rights are involved, and the Due Process
clause of the U.S. Constitution protects these rights. If state remedies are
inadequate, federal intervention may be sought to protect these
constitutional rights.
In re Berryman, 629 S.W.3d 453 (Tex. App. 2020)

Due process does not permit a State to infringe on a parent's fundamental
right to make child rearing decisions simply because a state judge believes a
'better' decision could be made. Id., 530 U.S. at 72-73, 120 S. Ct. at 2064.
The 'State may legitimately interfere with family autonomy to protect
children from genuine abuse and neglect by parents who are unfit to
discharge the ‘high duty’ of ‘broad parental authority over minor children.’
Summary
Due process is a fundamental right that protects parents from state
interference in child-rearing decisions unless there is a legitimate reason,
such as protecting children from abuse or neglect. This principle is rooted in
the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Troxel v. Granville, which emphasizes
the constitutional protection of parental rights. In the case of Charles Dustin
Myers, the procedural irregularities and due process violations in the Texas
state court system, as described in the narrative, suggest that his
fundamental rights as a parent may have been infringed upon without
legitimate cause. This provides a basis for seeking federal intervention, as
the state court's actions may have violated his constitutional rights under
the Fourteenth Amendment.

Extract
If the [Texas] court determines that a child custody proceeding has been
commenced in a court in another state having jurisdiction substantially in
accordance with this chapter, the [Texas] court ... shall stay its proceeding
and communicate with the court of the other state. If the court of the state
having jurisdiction substantially in accordance with this chapter does not
determine that the [Texas] court ... is a more appropriate forum, the [Texas]
court ... shall dismiss the proceeding.
Summary
The UCCJEA provides a framework for determining jurisdiction in child
custody cases when proceedings are filed in different states. The Act
prioritizes the child's home state and requires courts to communicate and
determine the most appropriate forum. If a court in another state has
jurisdiction in accordance with the UCCJEA, the Texas court must stay its
proceedings and communicate with the other state's court. If the other
state's court does not find Texas to be a more appropriate forum, the Texas
court must dismiss the proceeding. This framework ensures that
jurisdictional disputes are resolved efficiently and in the child's best
interest.
United Services Life Insurance Company v. Delaney, 396 S.W.2d 855 (Tex.
1965)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
It was held that before a power could be classified as judicial under our
constitution, the trial tribunal must have the authority to hear the facts, to
decide the issues of fact made by the pleadings, to decide the questions of
law involved, and possess the power to enter a judgment on the facts found
in accordance with the law as determined by the court. It follows that a
tribunal which is not empowered to render a final judgment is not
functioning in a judicial capacity. Since the federal court will enter the final
decree, any decision we may make in this case will be advisory in nature.
Summary
When a state court is not empowered to render a final judgment, its
decisions are advisory, and the federal court will enter the final decree. This
suggests that if a state court's actions are limited or ineffective, seeking
federal intervention could be a viable option, especially if the federal court
has the authority to render a final judgment.

The clear and convincing burden of proof in termination cases has a
foundation deeper than statutory law—a constitutional foundation. In re
Z.N., 602 S.W.3d 541, 545 (Tex. 2020) (per curiam). ... The statutory clear
and convincing burden of proof in termination of parental rights cases was
created in 1983, after the Texas Supreme Court, in 1980, and the United
States Supreme Court, in 1982, held that the clear and convincing burden of
proof is constitutionally required in termination cases. In re J.F.C., 96 S.W.3d
256, 264 (Tex. 2002). Consequently, the 'heightened standard of [appellate]
review is mandated not only by the Family Code... but also the Due Process
Clause of the United States Constitution.'
Summary
The termination of parental rights involves a constitutionally mandated clear
and convincing burden of proof. This requirement is rooted in both statutory
law and the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution. The
passage highlights the importance of due process in such cases, which could
provide a basis for federal intervention if state remedies are inadequate.

right of an appeal from a judgment on parental-rights termination, part of
the process of ensuring the accuracy of judgments necessarily involves
appellate review... . [I]f appellate review is permitted, it must be allowed.'
Summary
The passage highlights that while the Federal Constitution does not
guarantee appellate review, once a state provides that right, it must ensure
equal justice and allow appellate review. This principle is relevant to the
question as it underscores the importance of appellate review in ensuring
the accuracy of judgments, especially in cases involving fundamental rights
such as parental rights.

For example, in Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U.S. 645, 92 S.Ct. 1208, 31 L.Ed.2d
551 (1972), the United States Supreme Court afforded constitutional
recognition and due process protection to a putative biological father who
had 'sired and raised' his children born out of wedlock. There, the Supreme
Court held unconstitutional a statute that automatically placed children as
wards of the state upon the death of their unwed mother without a hearing
of fitness of the unwed father or proof of neglect. 405 U.S. at 658, 92 S.Ct. at
1216. The natural father who had lived with and raised the children claimed
that the statute violated his due process rights. Although discussed in terms
of the individual right of Mr. Stanley, the interest protected in Stanley is
clearly an interest in preserving integrity of the family unit.
Summary
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the fundamental due process rights
of parents, particularly in cases where state actions infringe upon those
rights without proper procedural safeguards. The Stanley v. Illinois case
illustrates that federal intervention can be warranted when state statutes or
actions violate constitutional due process protections, especially in matters
affecting the integrity of the family unit. This precedent supports the
potential for federal intervention in cases where state courts fail to provide
adequate due process, as Mr. Myers has experienced.
In re Interest of K.S.L., 538 S.W.3d 107 (Tex. 2017)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
Under exacting provisions of the Texas Family Code, parents may relinquish
their parental rights by executing an affidavit of voluntary relinquishment.
In this parental-termination case, even though the parents executed
statutorily compliant affidavits, the court of appeals held that the trial-court
order terminating parental rights could be overturned on appeal on grounds
that clear and convincing evidence of the child's best interest was lacking.
We disagree and reverse the court of appeals' judgment regarding
termination of parental rights... Instead of focusing on the waiver aspect of
this case, we can alternatively conduct a more general due process analysis
as the United States Supreme Court did in Lassiter and Santosky. In those
cases, the Supreme Court looked to the due process approach laid out in
Matthews v. Eldridge. We have applied this approach in a number of cases,
including parental-termination cases. Under Matthews, we must balance
three elements: the private interests at stake, the government's interest
supporting the challenged procedure, and the risk that the procedure will
lead to erroneous decisions.

highlights the importance of balancing private interests, government

Second, dismissal under section 263.401(a) is without prejudice, so the
Department may refile its petition for termination. Tex. Dep't of Family &
Protective Servs. v. Dickensheets, 274 S.W.3d 150, 161 (Tex. App.—Houston
[1st Dist.] 2008, no pet.). The fact that it would have to incur the time and
expense of a second termination proceeding does not change the fact that it
is entitled to a second bite at the apple—an opportunity not usually available
if a deadline is missed.
Summary
The Texas Family Code provides for automatic dismissal of certain cases if
statutory deadlines are not met, but such dismissals are without prejudice,
allowing the Department to refile. This indicates that procedural deadlines
are critical, and failure to meet them can result in dismissal, but not
necessarily a permanent bar to refiling. This procedural safeguard ensures
that cases are handled expeditiously, but also allows for correction of
procedural errors by refiling. In the context of federal intervention, if state
remedies prove inadequate or if there are systemic procedural violations
affecting constitutional rights, federal intervention could be sought to
ensure due process and protect fundamental rights.

Summary
Temporary orders in family law cases generally require notice and a

rights, which could potentially be addressed through federal intervention if
state remedies are inadequate.
Tex. Fam. Code § 153.002 Tex. Fam. Code § 153.002 Best Interest of Child;
Rebuttable Presumption In Suit Between Parent and Nonparent
Extract
In a suit between a parent and a nonparent, it is a rebuttable presumption
that: a parent acts in the best interest of the parent's child; and it is in the
best interest of a child to be in the care, custody, and control of a parent.
Summary
Texas law presumes that a parent acts in the best interest of their child and
that it is generally in the child's best interest to be in the care of a parent.
This presumption can be overcome by a nonparent only with clear and
convincing evidence that denying the nonparent's request would
significantly impair the child's physical health or emotional development. In
the case of Charles Dustin Myers, the procedural violations and due process
issues he has faced in Texas state courts may have undermined this
presumption, potentially justifying federal intervention to protect his
constitutional rights as a parent.
Tex. Fam. Code § 85.001 Tex. Fam. Code § 85.001 Required Findings and

Extract
At the close of a hearing on an application for a protective order, the court
shall find whether family violence has occurred. If the court finds that family
violence has occurred, the court shall render a protective order as provided
by Section FAMILY CODE 85.022 applying only to a person found to have
committed family violence; and may render a protective order as provided
by Section FAMILY CODE 85.021 applying to both parties that is in the best
interest of the person protected by the order or member of the family or
household of the person protected by the order.

=== PAGE 146 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
Tex. Fam. Code § 85.001 mandates that a court must make a finding of
whether family violence has occurred at the conclusion of a hearing on a
protective order application. If family violence is found, the court is required
to issue a protective order against the person found to have committed the
violence. This requirement is crucial because it ensures that protective
orders are based on factual findings rather than unsubstantiated allegations.
In the context of the question, if a protective order was issued without the
required findings, it could constitute a due process violation, potentially
justifying federal intervention if state remedies are inadequate.

substance by all parties; (B) a final default order; (C) a temporary order; or
(D) a final order in a case in which a party files an unrevoked waiver made in
accordance with Rule 119, Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, that waives notice
to the party of the final hearing or waives the party's appearance at the final

Summary
An associate judge in Texas has the authority to render and sign various
types of orders, including final orders agreed to by all parties, final default
orders, temporary orders, and final orders in cases where a party has
waived notice or appearance. This authority is subject to the right of parties
to request a de novo hearing before the referring court. The passage
highlights the procedural framework within which an associate judge
operates, emphasizing the importance of consent and waiver in the issuance
of orders. In the context of seeking federal intervention, this passage
underscores the procedural safeguards that should be in place to protect
due process rights. If these safeguards are not adhered to, it may provide
grounds for federal intervention under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, which allows
individuals to seek relief for violations of constitutional rights under color of
state law.

as an order or judgment of the referring court, except for an order providing
for the appointment of a receiver. Except as provided by Section FAMILY
CODE 201.007(c), if a request for a de novo hearing before the referring
court is not timely filed, the proposed order or judgment of the associate
judge becomes the order or judgment of the referring court only on the
referring court's signing the proposed order or judgment.
Summary
Orders or judgments made by an associate judge are enforceable as orders
of the referring court pending a de novo hearing. If a de novo hearing is not
requested in a timely manner, the associate judge's order becomes the order
of the referring court upon the court's signing. This indicates that the orders
in question are considered valid and enforceable unless successfully
challenged through a de novo hearing or other legal means.
Tex. Fam. Code § 6.501 Tex. Fam. Code § 6.501 Temporary Restraining

Summary
Tex. Fam. Code § 6.501 outlines the limitations on temporary restraining
orders in divorce proceedings, specifically prohibiting orders that prevent a
party from spending funds for necessary living expenses or conducting their
usual business. This indicates that any restraining order that violates these
provisions could be challenged as exceeding statutory authority. If state
remedies prove inadequate, federal intervention could be sought under 42
U.S.C. § 1983 for violations of constitutional rights, such as due process, as
recognized in cases like Troxel v. Granville and Stanley v. Illinois.

of any other state would have jurisdiction under the criteria specified in
Sections FAMILY CODE 152.201 through FAMILY CODE 152.203.
Summary
If a court in Texas has jurisdiction due to unjustifiable conduct by a party, it
must decline to exercise jurisdiction unless certain conditions are met. This
includes situations where all parties have acquiesced, another state court
finds Texas to be a more appropriate forum, or no other state has
jurisdiction. This provision ensures that jurisdiction is exercised fairly and
appropriately, preventing parties from manipulating jurisdiction through
unjustifiable conduct.
Tex. Fam. Code § 263.401 Tex. Fam. Code § 263.401 Dismissal After One
Year; New Trials; Extension
Extract
Unless the court has commenced the trial on the merits or granted an
extension under Subsection (b) or (b-1), on the first Monday after the first
anniversary of the date the court rendered a temporary order appointing the
department as temporary managing conservator, the court's jurisdiction
over the suit affecting the parent-child relationship filed by the department
that requests termination of the parent-child relationship or requests that
the department be named conservator of the child is terminated and the suit
is automatically dismissed without a court order.
Summary
The court's jurisdiction over a suit affecting the parent-child relationship is
automatically terminated if the trial on the merits has not commenced
within a year of the temporary order, unless an extension is granted. This
suggests that if the court has not acted within the statutory timeframe, the
suit should be dismissed, potentially providing grounds for federal
intervention if state remedies are inadequate.
Tex. Fam. Code § 109.001 Tex. Fam. Code § 109.001 Temporary Orders
During Pendency of Appeal
Extract
A party may seek review of the trial court's temporary order under this
section by: petition for writ of mandamus; or proper assignment in the
party's brief.

=== PAGE 149 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
Tex. Fam. Code § 109.001 provides a mechanism for parties to seek review
of temporary orders through a petition for writ of mandamus or by proper
assignment in the party's brief. This indicates that there are state-level
remedies available for addressing procedural violations and due process
issues in family law matters. However, if state remedies prove inadequate,
federal intervention could be sought through a civil rights action under 42
U.S.C. § 1983, particularly if the due process violations implicate federal
constitutional rights under the Fourteenth Amendment.
Tex. Fam. Code § 152.107 Tex. Fam. Code § 152.107 Priority
Extract
If a question of existence or exercise of jurisdiction under this chapter is
raised in a child custody proceeding, the question, upon request of a party,
must be given priority on the calendar and handled expeditiously.
Summary
If there is a question regarding the existence or exercise of jurisdiction in a
child custody case, this question must be prioritized and handled quickly if a
party requests it. This provision ensures that jurisdictional issues do not
unduly delay the resolution of child custody matters.
CHAPTER 14 Termination of Parental Rights
Representing Parents in Child Welfare Cases: Advice and Guidance
for Family Defenders (ABA) - American Bar Association
Extract
Even if statutory grounds for termination of parental rights have been
established, the court cannot terminate parental rights if it is in the best
interest of the child to maintain the parent-child relationship. Because
parents and children have a fundamental right to family integrity, and the
state has a parens patriae interest in keeping families intact, the court must
evaluate the long-term effect of severing the parent-child bond.
Summary
Even when statutory grounds for termination exist, courts must consider the
best interest of the child and the fundamental right to family integrity. This
suggests that if state courts fail to adequately protect these rights, federal
intervention could be justified to ensure that the child's best interests and
family integrity are preserved. The passage highlights the importance of

evaluating the long-term effects of severing the parent-child bond, which
aligns with federal constitutional protections.

ABSTAINING EQUITABLY.
Notre Dame Law Review - University of Notre Dame Law School -
Smith, Fred O., Jr. - 2022-05-01
Extract
The Younger doctrine 'naturally presupposes the opportunity to raise and
have timely decided by a competent state tribunal the federal issues
involved.' A federal court is not required to abstain 'simply because judicial
review, de novo or otherwise, would be forthcoming at the conclusion of the
administrative proceedings.' Fourth, federal courts are permitted to
intervene if the state law being wielded against the criminal defendant is
patently unconstitutional in 'every clause, sentence and paragraph.' This
exception has never been applied by the Supreme Court. Perhaps the best
way to understand the exception, then, is to understand the principle that
animates the other exceptions: avoiding the irreparable harm that attends a
structurally corrupt proceeding in which one's constitutional interests are at
stake.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
The Younger abstention doctrine typically prevents federal courts from
intervening in ongoing state proceedings. However, there are exceptions,
particularly when the state proceeding does not provide an adequate
opportunity to raise federal constitutional issues or when the state law is
patently unconstitutional. The passage highlights that federal courts can
intervene to prevent irreparable harm in structurally corrupt proceedings
where constitutional interests are at stake. This suggests that if the
Respondent can demonstrate that the state proceedings are inadequate or
that the state law is unconstitutional, federal intervention could be justified.
THE ENDURING CHALLENGES FOR HABEAS CORPUS.
Notre Dame Law Review - University of Notre Dame Law School -
Wood, Diane P. - 2020-05-01
Extract
Federal courts have power under the federal habeas statute to grant relief
despite the applicant's failure to have pursued a state remedy not available
to him at the time he applies; the doctrine under which state procedural
defaults are held to constitute an adequate and independent state law
ground barring direct Supreme Court review is not to be extended to limit
the power granted the federal courts under the federal habeas statute.
Summary
Federal courts have the authority to grant habeas corpus relief even if the
applicant has not pursued a state remedy that was unavailable at the time of
application. This suggests that federal intervention can be sought when
state remedies are inadequate or have been exhausted, which aligns with
the Respondent's situation where state court actions have failed to provide
relief.

Extract
Moreover, the Court has subsequently made clear that federal courts have a
'virtually unflagging obligation' to exercise jurisdiction, and abstention,
including Burford abstention, is only appropriate in extraordinary or unusual
circumstances.

=== PAGE 152 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
Federal courts have a strong obligation to exercise their jurisdiction and
that abstention is only appropriate in extraordinary circumstances. This
suggests that federal intervention could be a viable option for the
Respondent if state remedies prove inadequate, as federal courts are
generally required to hear cases within their jurisdiction unless exceptional
circumstances justify abstention.

habeas review." (160) And [section] 1983 was revitalized in Monroe v. Pape
and its sequellae, (161) in which the Supreme Court recognized the statute's
purpose to provide federal remedies where state law was "not available in
practice." (162) Earlier views of [section] 1983 predicated federal
jurisdiction on showing state courts inadequate. But critically, the Supreme
Court concluded that a plaintiff did not need to exhaust state remedies but
could go immediately to federal court. (163) In other words, the question of
adequacy was resolved through concurrent jurisdiction: the plaintiff was
allowed to choose whether to proceed in state or federal court.
Summary
Federal intervention can be a viable option when state remedies are
inadequate. The revitalization of Section 1983 allows plaintiffs to seek
federal remedies without exhausting state remedies, providing an avenue for
federal intervention in cases of procedural irregularities and due process
violations in state court proceedings. This concurrent jurisdiction allows
plaintiffs to choose between state and federal court, offering a potential path
for relief when state courts fail to provide adequate remedies.
ABSTAINING FROM ABSTENTION: WHY YOUNGER ABSTENTION DOES

Extract
The Younger court went on to outline three exceptions for when a federal
court must act to enjoin a state court proceeding: when (1) the prosecution
is acting in bad faith, (2) the statute is 'patently unconstitutional,' or (3) 'any

other unusual circumstances that would call for equitable relief' exist. These
exceptions stem from Ex parte Young, which held that a defendant about to
be prosecuted in a state court can enjoin the proceedings if he can show
that he otherwise would suffer irreparable harm. This is because federal
courts must be able to protect constitutional rights where state courts may
fail to do so, but also should not needlessly interfere with legitimate
activities of state courts.
Summary
Federal intervention in state court proceedings is generally limited by the
Younger abstention doctrine. However, there are specific exceptions where
federal courts can intervene: if the state prosecution is in bad faith, if the
statute in question is patently unconstitutional, or if there are unusual
circumstances that warrant equitable relief. These exceptions are designed
to protect constitutional rights when state courts may not adequately do so.
STANDING, EQUITY, AND INJURY IN FACT.
Notre Dame Law Review - University of Notre Dame Law School -
Young, Ernest A. - 2022-05-01
Extract
The ability to sue to enjoin unconstitutional actions by state and federal
officers is the creation of courts of equity, and reflects a long history of
judicial review of illegal executive action, tracing back to England.... It is a
judge-made remedy, and we have never held or even suggested that, in its
application to state officers, it rests upon an implied right of action
contained in the Supremacy Clause.
Summary
Federal courts have the authority to provide equitable relief against
unconstitutional actions by state officers. This authority is rooted in a long
tradition of judicial review and does not depend on an implied right of action
under the Supremacy Clause. This suggests that federal intervention can be
a viable option when state court proceedings involve procedural violations
that infringe upon constitutional rights.
