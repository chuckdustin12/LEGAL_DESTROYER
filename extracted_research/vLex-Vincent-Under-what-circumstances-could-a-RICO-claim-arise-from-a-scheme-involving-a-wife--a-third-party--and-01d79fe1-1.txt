Question
Under what circumstances could a RICO claim arise from a scheme
involving a wife, a third party, and a relative, where actions include
transferring money to conceal assets, making false statements about abuse,
and using legal processes to remove a spouse from the marital home?
Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
A RICO claim could arise from a scheme involving a wife, third party, and
relative when their coordinated actions constitute an enterprise engaged in
a pattern of racketeering activity, such as mail fraud, wire fraud, or money
laundering. Specific predicate acts like transferring money to conceal
assets, making false statements, and abusing legal processes must form a
pattern showing both relationship and continuity that affects interstate
commerce.
Summary
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) provides
both criminal penalties and civil remedies against individuals who conduct
or participate in an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity.
Based on the provided materials, a RICO claim could potentially arise from a
scheme involving family members and third parties in a domestic context
when their coordinated actions constitute an "enterprise" engaged in a
"pattern of racketeering activity" as defined by 18 U.S.C. § 1961. The
scheme described—involving transferring money to conceal assets, making
false statements about abuse, and manipulating legal processes—could
potentially qualify as predicate acts under RICO if they involve mail fraud,
wire fraud, money laundering, obstruction of justice, or other qualifying
offenses.
For a viable RICO claim to exist in this scenario, several essential elements
must be established: (1) the existence of an enterprise consisting of the wife,
third party, and relative; (2) a pattern of racketeering activity involving at
least two related predicate acts within ten years that demonstrate both
relationship and continuity; (3) conduct by the defendants participating in
the operation or management of the enterprise; (4) an effect on interstate
commerce; and (5) injury to business or property resulting from the
racketeering activity. The claim could be brought under various subsections
of 18 U.S.C. § 1962, depending on the specific nature of the defendants'
involvement, with potential civil remedies including treble damages and
attorney's fees under 18 U.S.C. § 1964.

Background and Relevant Law
Statutory Framework
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) provides
both criminal and civil remedies against racketeering activity. To understand
when a RICO claim could arise in the context of the scheme described in the
question, it is essential to examine the key statutory provisions that define
the elements of a RICO violation.
Prohibited Activities
Under 18 U.S.C. § 1962, several activities are prohibited:
"It shall be unlawful for any person through a pattern of racketeering
activity or through collection of an unlawful debt to acquire or maintain,
directly or indirectly, any interest in or control of any enterprise which is
engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign
commerce."
The statute specifically prohibits four types of activities:
Using income derived from racketeering activity to acquire an interest
in an enterprise (§ 1962(a))
Acquiring or maintaining an interest in an enterprise through
racketeering activity (§ 1962(b))
Conducting the affairs of an enterprise through a pattern of
racketeering activity (§ 1962(c))
Conspiring to violate any of the above provisions (§ 1962(d))
Definition of "Racketeering Activity"
18 U.S.C. § 1961 defines "racketeering activity" to include numerous federal
and state offenses:
"'racketeering activity' means (A) any act or threat involving murder,
kidnapping, gambling, arson, robbery, bribery, extortion, dealing in obscene
matter, or dealing in a controlled substance or listed chemical (as defined in
section 102 of the Controlled Substances Act), which is chargeable under
State law and punishable by imprisonment for more than one year; (B) any
act which is indictable under any of the following provisions of title 18,
United States Code: ... section 1341 (relating to mail fraud), section 1343
(relating to wire fraud), section 1344 (relating to financial institution
fraud), ... section 1503 (relating to obstruction of justice), section 1510
(relating to obstruction of criminal investigations), section 1511 (relating to
the obstruction of State or local law enforcement), section 1512 (relating to
tampering with a witness, victim, or an informant), section 1513 (relating to
retaliating against a witness, victim, or an informant), ... section 1956
(relating to the laundering of monetary instruments), section 1957 (relating
to engaging in monetary transactions in property derived from specified
unlawful activity)..."

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Of particular relevance to the scenario involving concealed assets and false
statements are offenses such as mail fraud, wire fraud, obstruction of
justice, and money laundering.
Money Laundering
18 U.S.C. § 1956 addresses the laundering of monetary instruments:
"Whoever, knowing that the property involved in a financial transaction
represents the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity, conducts or
attempts to conduct such a financial transaction which in fact involves the
proceeds of specified unlawful activity... knowing that the transaction is
designed in whole or in part... to conceal or disguise the nature, the
location, the source, the ownership, or the control of the proceeds of
specified unlawful activity..."
This provision could be particularly relevant to the scenario involving
transferring money to conceal assets.
Civil Remedies
18 U.S.C. § 1964 provides civil remedies for RICO violations:
"Any person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of
section 1962 of this chapter may sue therefor in any appropriate United
States district court and shall recover threefold the damages he sustains and
the cost of the suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee..."
This provision establishes the right of an injured party to sue and potentially
recover treble damages and attorneys' fees.
Case Law Interpretations
Elements of a RICO Claim
Courts have consistently identified four essential elements required to
establish a RICO claim. In Lockhart v. Deluca (E.D. Mich. 2023), the court
explained:
"To state a RICO claim, a plaintiff must plead: '(1) conduct (2) of an
enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity.'" (citing Sedima,
S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., Inc., 473 U.S. 479, 496 (1985)).
Similarly, in Studco Bldg. Sys. U.S., LLC v. 1st Advantage Fed. Credit Union,
509 F.Supp.3d 560 (E.D. Va. 2020), the court stated:
"Generally, the elements of a civil Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act (RICO) claim are (1) a person, (2) an enterprise, (3) a
pattern of (4) racketeering activity (5) which causes injury to the plaintiff."

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Enterprise Requirement
The concept of an "enterprise" is fundamental to a RICO claim. In Boyle v.
United States, 556 U.S. 938 (2009), the Supreme Court explained:
"RICO defines 'enterprise' to include 'any individual, partnership,
corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of
individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.'" (quoting 18 U.S.C.
§ 1961(4)).
In Ouwinga v. Benistar 419 Plan Servs., Inc., 694 F.3d 783, 793 (6th Cir.
2012), the court articulated specific requirements for pleading an
enterprise:
"To plead an enterprise, for instance, a plaintiff must allege: 1) an ongoing
organization with some sort of framework or superstructure for making and
carrying out decisions; 2) that the members of the enterprise functioned as a
continuing unit with established duties; and 3) that the enterprise was
separate and distinct from the pattern of racketeering activity in which it
engaged."
The enterprise requirement has been further clarified in Begala v. PNC
Bank, 214 F.3d 776 (6th Cir. 2000), which emphasized the "distinctness
requirement":
"Under RICO, a corporation cannot be both the 'enterprise' and the 'person'
conducting or participating in the affairs of that enterprise."
Pattern of Racketeering Activity
For a viable RICO claim, the defendants must engage in a "pattern of
racketeering activity." In H.J. Inc v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Company,
492 U.S. 229 (1989), the Supreme Court explained:
"RICO's legislative history, however, establishes that Congress intended that
to prove a 'pattern of racketeering activity' a plaintiff or prosecutor must
show both 'relationship' and 'continuity'—that the racketeering predicates
are related, and that they either constitute or threaten long-term criminal
activity."
The requirement for at least two acts of racketeering activity within a ten-
year period is specified in Ouwinga v. Benistar 419 Plan Servs., Inc., 694 F.
3d 783 (6th Cir. 2012):
"A pattern of racketeering activity requires, at a minimum, two acts of
racketeering activity within ten years of each other."
Conduct Requirement
The "conduct" element of a RICO claim was addressed in Reves v. Ernst
Young, 507 U.S. 170 (1993):

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
"It is clear from the statute's language and legislative history that Congress
did not intend to extend § 1962(c) liability beyond those who participate in
the operation or management of an enterprise through a pattern of
racketeering activity."
This establishes the operation or management test for RICO liability under §
1962(c).
Predicate Acts
Various predicate acts that can constitute "racketeering activity" have been
identified in cases. In United Energy Owners Committee, Inc. v. U.S. Energy
Management Systems, Inc., 837 F.2d 356 (9th Cir. 1988), the court
recognized that:
"The plaintiffs allege that the defendants' activities constitute predicate acts
of mail and wire fraud in furtherance of a fraudulent... scheme."
Similarly, in Bridge v. Phoenix Bond & Indem. Co., 553 U.S. 639 (2008), the
Supreme Court explained:
"Mail fraud, in turn, occurs whenever a person, 'having devised or intending
to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud,' uses the mail 'for the purpose of
executing such scheme or artifice.'" (quoting § 1341).
Analysis
Application to the Described Scheme
To determine whether a RICO claim could arise from a scheme involving a
wife, a third party, and a relative engaging in activities such as transferring
money to conceal assets, making false statements about abuse, and using
legal processes to remove a spouse from the marital home, each element of
a RICO claim must be analyzed.
Enterprise Element
First, the group consisting of the wife, third party, and relative could
potentially constitute an "enterprise" under RICO if they form an ongoing
organization with some framework for making and carrying out decisions
and function as a continuing unit.
As explained in Ouwinga v. Benistar 419 Plan Servs., Inc., 694 F.3d 783 (6th
Cir. 2012), an enterprise requires "an ongoing organization with some sort
of framework or superstructure for making and carrying out decisions" and
that "the members of the enterprise functioned as a continuing unit with
established duties."
The Supreme Court in Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938 (2009) held that
an enterprise includes "any union or group of individuals associated in fact
although not a legal entity." This broad definition could encompass the

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
informal association of family members and third parties working together
toward common goals, even without a formal organizational structure.
Pattern of Racketeering Activity
Second, the actions described in the question must constitute a "pattern of
racketeering activity." This requires at least two acts of racketeering within
ten years that demonstrate both "relationship" and "continuity."
The specific activities mentioned—transferring money to conceal assets,
making false statements about abuse, and using legal processes to remove a
spouse from the marital home—could qualify as predicate acts under RICO if
they involve:
Mail or Wire Fraud: If electronic communications or postal services
were used to execute the scheme, this could constitute mail or wire
fraud under 18 U.S.C. §§ 1341 or 1343. As noted in Bridge v. Phoenix
Bond & Indem. Co., 553 U.S. 639 (2008), mail fraud occurs whenever
someone "having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice
to defraud" uses the mail "for the purpose of executing such scheme or
artifice."
Money Laundering: Transferring money to conceal assets could
potentially violate 18 U.S.C. § 1956, which prohibits financial
transactions designed "to conceal or disguise the nature, the location,
the source, the ownership, or the control of the proceeds of specified
unlawful activity." If the transfers involve amounts over $10,000, they
might also violate 18 U.S.C. § 1957, which prohibits "monetary
transaction[s] in criminally derived property of a value greater than
$10,000."
Obstruction of Justice: Making false statements about abuse in legal
proceedings or manipulating the legal system could potentially
constitute obstruction of justice under 18 U.S.C. § 1512, which prohibits
"knowingly us[ing] intimidation, threaten[ing], or corruptly
persuad[ing] another person... with intent to influence, delay, or
prevent the testimony of any person in an official proceeding."
As explained in H.J. Inc v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Company, 492 U.S.
229 (1989), the pattern must show both "relationship" and "continuity." The
relationship element would be satisfied if the acts have "the same or similar
purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of commission."
Continuity could be established by showing either "a series of related
predicate acts extending over a substantial period of time" (closed-ended
continuity) or a "threat of continuing criminal activity extending indefinitely
into the future" (open-ended continuity).
Conduct Element
The participants in the scheme must conduct or participate in the operation
or management of the enterprise through the pattern of racketeering
activity. As established in Reves v. Ernst Young, 507 U.S. 170 (1993), liability
1. 
2. 
3. 

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
extends to "those who participate in the operation or management of an
enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity."
In the context of the described scheme, if the wife, third party, and relative
are actively making decisions and taking actions to further the enterprise's
goals through the predicate acts, this element could be satisfied.
Interstate Commerce Element
For RICO to apply, the enterprise's activities must affect interstate
commerce. This requirement is often broadly interpreted and could be
satisfied if any aspect of the scheme crosses state lines, such as electronic
transfers of funds between banks in different states or communications
across state boundaries.
Injury Element
For a civil RICO claim, the plaintiff must demonstrate an injury to business
or property resulting from the RICO violation. As stated in Studco Bldg. Sys.
U.S., LLC v. 1st Advantage Fed. Credit Union, 509 F.Supp.3d 560 (E.D. Va.
2020), the elements include "which causes injury to the plaintiff."
In this scenario, the spouse who was removed from the marital home and
whose assets were concealed could potentially demonstrate economic injury,
such as loss of property rights or financial damages.
Specific Applications Under Different RICO Provisions
The scheme could potentially give rise to claims under different subsections
of 18 U.S.C. § 1962:
Under § 1962(a): If the proceeds from the racketeering activities
(such as fraudulently obtained assets) were used to establish or operate
another enterprise affecting interstate commerce.
Under § 1962(b): If the racketeering activities were used to acquire or
maintain interest in or control of an enterprise, such as gaining control
over marital property.
Under § 1962(c): If the participants conducted the affairs of the
enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity, which would be
the most common basis for a claim in this scenario.
Under § 1962(d): If there was a conspiracy among the wife, third
party, and relative to violate any of the above provisions.
As explained in Portionpac Chemical Corp. v. Sanitech Systems, 217 F.Supp.
2d 1238 (M.D. Fla. 2002), these provisions cover various aspects of
racketeering activity, including "investing income derived, directly or
indirectly, from a pattern of racketeering activity," "acquiring or maintaining
an interest in any enterprise... through a pattern of racketeering activity,"
"conducting or participating in the affairs of any enterprise... through a

pattern of racketeering activity," and "conspiring to violate any of the
provisions."
Exceptions and Caveats
Limitations on RICO Claims
Despite the potential applicability of RICO to the described scheme, several
important limitations could affect the viability of such a claim:
Ordinary Business or Personal Disputes: Courts are generally
reluctant to apply RICO to ordinary business or personal disputes. As
noted in Studco Bldg. Sys. U.S., LLC v. 1st Advantage Fed. Credit
Union, 509 F.Supp.3d 560 (E.D. Va. 2020), "we have reserved RICO
liability for 'ongoing unlawful activities whose scope and persistence
pose a special threat to social well-being.'" A domestic dispute, even if
it involves potentially fraudulent activities, might not rise to this level
without additional factors indicating a broader scheme.
Continuity Requirement: The scheme must demonstrate sufficient
continuity to establish a pattern. If the actions were isolated incidents
related to a single dispute rather than an ongoing pattern of criminal
activity, this requirement might not be met.
Predicate Acts: The specific activities must qualify as predicate acts
under RICO. If the actions do not involve mail fraud, wire fraud, money
laundering, obstruction of justice, or other qualifying offenses, they
would not support a RICO claim.
Interstate Commerce: The enterprise must affect interstate
commerce. If all activities were purely local in nature, this jurisdictional
requirement might not be satisfied.
Pleading Standards: RICO claims are subject to heightened pleading
standards, especially when based on fraud. As noted in Civil Rico: A
Tool of Advocacy, "RICO claims based on mail or wire fraud must
comport with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b)'s requirement that
allegations involving fraud be pleaded with particularity."
Distinction Between Civil and Criminal RICO Claims
It's important to distinguish between civil and criminal RICO claims. While
the substantive elements are similar, the procedural context and burdens of
proof differ significantly:
Criminal RICO: Prosecuted by the government with potential
penalties including fines and imprisonment up to 20 years (or life in
certain circumstances), as specified in 18 U.S.C. § 1963: "Whoever
violates any provision of section 1962 of this chapter shall be fined
under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years (or for life if the
violation is based on a racketeering activity for which the maximum

penalty includes life imprisonment), or both, and shall forfeit to the
United States..."
Civil RICO: Initiated by private plaintiffs with remedies including
treble damages and attorney's fees, as provided in 18 U.S.C. § 1964:
"Any person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation
of section 1962 of this chapter may sue therefor in any appropriate
United States district court and shall recover threefold the damages he
sustains and the cost of the suit, including a reasonable attorney's
fee..."
In the described scenario, the injured spouse would likely pursue a civil
RICO claim seeking damages, while criminal RICO charges would require
prosecution by federal authorities.
Conclusion
A RICO claim could potentially arise from a scheme involving a wife, a third
party, and a relative engaging in activities such as transferring money to
conceal assets, making false statements about abuse, and using legal
processes to remove a spouse from the marital home, but only if specific
requirements are met.
For such a claim to succeed, the plaintiff would need to establish:
Enterprise: The wife, third party, and relative must form an
association-in-fact enterprise with some structure and continuity of
purpose.
Racketeering Activity: The actions must constitute predicate acts
under RICO, such as mail fraud, wire fraud, money laundering, or
obstruction of justice.
Pattern: There must be at least two predicate acts within ten years
that demonstrate both relationship and continuity.
Conduct: The defendants must participate in the operation or
management of the enterprise through the pattern of racketeering
activity.
Interstate Commerce: The enterprise's activities must affect
interstate commerce.
Injury: For a civil RICO claim, the plaintiff must demonstrate injury to
business or property resulting from the RICO violation.
While domestic disputes are not typical subjects of RICO actions, the
statute's broad language could encompass such schemes when they involve
qualifying criminal activities conducted through an enterprise. However,
courts generally reserve RICO for "ongoing unlawful activities whose scope
and persistence pose a special threat to social well-being," so the scheme
•

2. 
3. 
4. 
5. 
6. 

=== PAGE 10 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
would need to demonstrate significant scope, persistence, and impact
beyond an isolated domestic incident.
The potential civil remedies for a successful RICO claim include treble
damages and attorney's fees, making it an attractive option for plaintiffs who
can meet the stringent requirements of establishing all elements of the
claim. However, the heightened pleading standards and the courts' general
reluctance to apply RICO to ordinary disputes present significant challenges
to bringing such claims in domestic contexts.
Legal Authorities

USLW 4474 (2009)
U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
RICO makes it 'unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any
enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign
commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of
such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.' 18 U.S.C.
§ 1962(c). The statute defines 'enterprise' to include 'any individual,
partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or
group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.' § 1961(4).
Summary
The passage from Boyle v. United States provides insight into the
requirements for a RICO claim, specifically the need for an "enterprise" and
a "pattern of racketeering activity." An enterprise can be any group of
individuals associated in fact, even if not a legal entity. The actions
described in the question, such as transferring money to conceal assets and
making false statements, could potentially be considered racketeering
activities if they meet the statutory definitions. The involvement of a wife, a
third party, and a relative could form an "enterprise" if they are associated
in fact for a common purpose. Therefore, if these actions are part of a
pattern of racketeering activity affecting interstate or foreign commerce, a
RICO claim could potentially arise.

Extract
In 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c), RICO provides a private right of action for treble
damages to '[a]ny person injured in his business or property by reason of a
violation,' as pertinent here, of § 1962(c), which makes it 'unlawful for any
person employed by or associated with' a qualifying enterprise 'to conduct
or participate ... in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern
of racketeering activity,' including 'mail fraud,' § 1961(1)(B). Mail fraud, in
turn, occurs whenever a person, 'having devised or intending to devise any
scheme or artifice to defraud,' uses the mail 'for the purpose of executing
such scheme or artifice.' § 1341.
Summary
Mail fraud involves using the mail to execute a scheme to defraud. This is
relevant to the question as it suggests that if the scheme involving the wife,
third party, and relative includes mail fraud as part of the actions to conceal
assets or make false statements, it could potentially give rise to a RICO
claim.
Reves v. Ernst Young, 507 U.S. 170, 113 S.Ct. 1163, 122 L.Ed.2d 525 (1993)
U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
A provision of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act
(RICO), 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), makes it unlawful 'for any person employed by
or associated with [an interstate] enterprise... to conduct or participate,
directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a
pattern of racketeering activity... .' ... It is clear from the statute's language
and legislative history that Congress did not intend to extend § 1962(c)
liability beyond those who participate in the operation or management of an
enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity.
Summary
The passage from Reves v. Ernst Young clarifies that for a RICO claim under
§ 1962(c) to arise, the individuals involved must participate in the operation
or management of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity.
This means that merely being associated with an enterprise is not enough;
there must be active participation in its management or operations. In the
context of the question, if the wife, third party, and relative are conducting
or participating in the management of an enterprise (which could be a
loosely defined association for the purpose of the scheme) through a pattern
of racketeering activities such as fraud or obstruction of justice, a RICO
claim could potentially arise.

106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989)
U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
RICO's legislative history, however, establishes that Congress intended that
to prove a 'pattern of racketeering activity' a plaintiff or prosecutor must
show both 'relationship' and 'continuity'—that the racketeering predicates
are related, and that they either constitute or threaten long-term criminal
activity. ... RICO renders criminally and civilly liable 'any person' who uses
or invests income derived 'from a pattern of racketeering activity' to acquire
an interest in or to operate an enterprise engaged in interstate commerce, §
1962(a); who acquires or maintains an interest in or control of such an
enterprise 'through a pattern of racketeering activity,' § 1962(b); who, being
employed by or associated with such an enterprise, conducts or participates
in the conduct of its affairs 'through a pattern of racketeering activity,' §
1962(c); or, finally, who conspires to violate the first three subsections of §
1962, § 1962(d).
Summary
To establish a RICO claim, there must be a demonstration of both a
relationship and continuity in the racketeering activities. This means that
the actions must be related and either constitute or threaten long-term
criminal activity. The passage also outlines the types of activities that can
lead to RICO liability, such as using income derived from racketeering to
operate an enterprise or participating in the conduct of an enterprise's
affairs through racketeering.

U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
RICO essentially seeks to prevent organized criminals from taking over or
operating legitimate businesses. Its language, however, extends its scope
well beyond those central purposes. RICO begins by listing certain predicate
acts, called `racketeering activity,` which consist of other crimes, ranging
from criminal copyright activities, the facilitation of gambling, and mail
fraud to arson, kidnaping, and murder. § 1961(1) (2000 ed., Supp. III). It
then defines a `pattern of racketeering activity` to include engaging in `at
least two` predicate acts in a 10-year period. § 1961(5) (2000 ed.). And it
forbids certain business-related activities involving such a `pattern` and an
`enterprise.` The forbidden activities include using funds derived from a
`pattern of racketeering activity` in acquiring, establishing, or operating any

=== PAGE 13 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
enterprise, and conducting the affairs of any enterprise through such `a
pattern.`
Summary
RICO's scope extends beyond organized crime to include a variety of
predicate acts that can form a pattern of racketeering activity. This includes
acts like mail and wire fraud, which could potentially relate to the actions
described in the question, such as transferring money to conceal assets or
making false statements. The passage also clarifies that a pattern of
racketeering activity involves at least two predicate acts within a 10-year
period, which is relevant to determining if the described scheme could
constitute a RICO violation.

(1985)
U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C.
§§ 1961-1968, which is directed at 'racketeering activity'—defined in §
1961(1) to encompass, inter alia, acts 'indictable' under specific federal
criminal provisions, including mail and wire fraud—provides in § 1964(c) for
a private civil action to recover treble damages by any person injured in his
business or property 'by reason of a violation of section 1962.' Section
1962(c) prohibits conducting or participating in the conduct of an enterprise
'through a pattern of racketeering activity.'
Summary
A RICO claim can arise if there is a "pattern of racketeering activity"
involving acts that are "indictable" under federal criminal provisions, such
as mail and wire fraud. The passage highlights that RICO provides for a
private civil action to recover treble damages for injuries to business or
property resulting from a violation of section 1962. This suggests that if the
scheme involving the wife, third party, and relative includes activities that
can be classified as racketeering, such as fraud or other indictable offenses,
a RICO claim could potentially be pursued.

Extract
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, 18 U.S.C. §§
1961-1968, makes it unlawful 'to conduct' an 'enterprise's affairs through a
pattern of racketeering activity,' where 'racketeering' is defined as behavior
that violates certain enumerated federal statutes or state laws addressing
specific topics and bearing specific penalties. 18 U.S.C. §§ 1962(c);
1961(1). ... Accordingly, to state a claim for a RICO violation, a plaintiff must
allege a cognizable injury to its business or property resulting from the '(1)
conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity.' ... Before a RICO plaintiff can allege a 'pattern of racketeering
activity,' he must plead instances of 'racketeering activity' or 'predicate
acts.' ... A list of acts that constitute racketeering activity can be found at 18
U.S.C. § 1961(1). Plaintiff's Amended Complaint alleges two of the identified
acts: bribery and mail fraud.
Summary
Elements necessary to establish a RICO claim, which are applicable to any
case under U.S. Federal law. The passage does not specifically address the
scenario involving a wife, a third party, and a relative, but it provides the
legal framework for understanding how a RICO claim could arise if the
actions in the scenario meet the criteria of racketeering activity and
enterprise conduct.
Nutrition Distribution LLC v. Custom Nutraceuticals LLC, 194 F.Supp.3d 952
(D. Ariz. 2016)
U.S. District Court — District of Arizona
Extract
RICO makes it unlawful for 'any person employed by or associated with any
enterprise engaged in...interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or
participate...in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of
racketeering activity.' 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). 'Racketeering activity' includes
any of several listed crimes 'which is chargeable under State law and
punishable by imprisonment for more than one year,' as well as any act
chargeable under one of several enumerated federal statutes. § 1961(1). A
'pattern of racketeering activity' requires at least two acts of racketeering
activity, which must be 'related' and 'amount to or pose a threat of continued
criminal activity.'
Summary
Framework for understanding when a RICO claim might arise, which could
be applicable to the described scheme if the actions meet these criteria.

Lockhart v. Deluca
U.S. District Court — Eastern District of Michigan
Extract
The Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO, was
enacted to curb “racketeering activity,” which it defines as any act
“chargeable” under several generically described state criminal laws, any
act “indictable” under numerous specific federal criminal provisions,
including mail and wire fraud, and any “offense” involving bankruptcy or
securities fraud or drug-related activities that is “punishable” under federal
law.” 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1); see also Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., Inc., 473
U.S. 479, 481-82 (1985). For violations of RICO, Congress has provided
primarily criminal penalties. See 18 U.S.C. § 1963. But § 1964 establishes a
civil cause of action for “[a]ny person injured in his business of property by
reason of a violation of [18 U.S.C. § 1962].” To state a RICO claim, a plaintiff
must plead: “(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of
racketeering activity.” Sedima, S.P.R.L., 473 U.S. at 496. The Sixth Circuit
has instructed that RICO pleadings must be liberally construed, Begala v.
PNC Bank, 214 F.3d 776, 781 (6th Cir. 2000), but plaintiffs nonetheless must
offer allegations establishing each element. Each of these elements, in turn,
has its own sub-elements. To plead an enterprise, for instance, a plaintiff
must allege: 1) an ongoing organization with some sort of framework or
superstructure for making and carrying out decisions; 2) that the members
of the enterprise functioned as a continuing unit with established duties;
and 3) that the enterprise was separate and distinct from the pattern of
racketeering activity in which it engaged. Ouwinga v. Benistar 419 Plan
Servs., Inc., 694 F.3d 783, 793 (6th Cir. 2012). As for the “conduct” element,
the plaintiff's allegations must establish that a defendant participated,
“directly or indirectly, in the conduct of [the RICO] enterprise's affairs.” 18
U.S.C. § 1962(c).
Summary
Elements required to establish a RICO claim, which includes conduct of an
enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. It specifies that
racketeering activity can include acts chargeable under state laws or
indictable under federal laws, such as mail and wire fraud. The passage also
details the sub-elements necessary to plead an enterprise, such as an
ongoing organization and distinct duties among its members. This
information is relevant to determining if a scheme involving a wife, a third
party, and a relative could constitute a RICO violation if it involves such
activities as transferring money to conceal assets or making false
statements, provided these actions form a pattern of racketeering activity.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
The issuing and processing of the checks constitute a violation of the civil
RICO statute. In order to prove a violation of civil RICO, plaintiff must prove:
(1) that there existed an enterprise, which affected interstate commerce; (2)
that codefendants were employed by or associated with the enterprise; (3)
that codefendants participated in the conduct of the enterprise's affairs; and
(4) that codefendants' participation was through a pattern of racketeering
activity. ... Codefendants' participation in the enterprise constituted a
pattern of racketeering. The 'pattern of racketeering activity' consists of a
requisite number of criminal acts performed by the persons composing the
enterprise. ... A pattern requires at least two criminal activities within ten
years. ... In addition, the racketeering predicates must be related and
amount to or pose a continued threat of criminal activity.
Summary
Elements required to establish a civil RICO claim: the existence of an
enterprise affecting interstate commerce, association with the enterprise,
participation in the enterprise's affairs, and participation through a pattern
of racketeering activity. The pattern of racketeering activity must include at
least two related criminal acts within ten years that pose a continued threat
of criminal activity. This framework can be applied to assess whether a
scheme involving a wife, a third party, and a relative, with actions such as
transferring money to conceal assets and making false statements, could
constitute a RICO violation if these actions form a pattern of racketeering
activity.
United Energy Owners Committee, Inc. v. U.S. Energy Management
Systems, Inc., 837 F.2d 356 (9th Cir. 1988)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Ninth Circuit
Extract
The plaintiffs allege that the defendants' activities constitute predicate acts
of mail and wire fraud in furtherance of a fraudulent solar energy tax shelter
scheme. The plaintiffs claim that the defendants injured them by violating
(1) RICO section 1962(c) by participating in the conduct of the affairs of
enterprises through a pattern of racketeering activity, and (2) RICO section
1962(a) by using or investing the income or proceeds of the racketeering
activity to acquire interests in and to establish and operate other businesses
which are engaged in interstate commerce. The plaintiffs also claim that the
defendants engaged in a conspiracy in violation of RICO section 1962(d) by
their violation of sections 1962(a) and (c).

Summary
A RICO claim can arise when there is a pattern of racketeering activity,
which includes predicate acts such as mail and wire fraud. The passage also
highlights the necessity of an enterprise being involved in the conduct of
racketeering activities. In the context of the question, if the actions of
transferring money to conceal assets, making false statements, and using
legal processes are part of a pattern of racketeering activity and involve an
enterprise, a RICO claim could potentially be established.
Tashjian v. Deutsche Bank, CIVIL ACTION NO. 19-cv-40074-DHH (D. Mass.
Feb 23, 2021)
U.S. District Court — District of Massachusetts
Extract
To plead a civil RICO action, a plaintiff must plead specific, non-conclusory,
facts which, if accepted as true, show the existence of four elements: '(1)
conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity.' ... To plead a 'pattern' of 'racketeering activity,' a plaintiff must set
forth well-pled allegations of conduct violating specified federal or state
statutes. Racketeering acts include (1) offenses chargeable under State law
and punishable by imprisonment of more than one year that involve murder,
kidnapping, gambling, arson, robbery, bribery, extortion, dealing in obscene
matter, or dealing in a controlled substance, and (2) violations of certain
federal statutes, such as the mail and wire fraud statutes. ... A ''pattern of
racketeering activity'' requires at least two acts of racketeering activity'
within ten years of each other. ... To satisfy this mandate, a plaintiff must
plead facts showing that racketeering acts are 'related, and that they
amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity.'
Summary
Framework for understanding the elements necessary to establish a RICO
claim, which could be applicable to the scenario described in the question if
the actions meet these criteria.

3d 560 (E.D. Va. 2020)
U.S. District Court — Eastern District of Virginia
Extract
Generally, the elements of a civil Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act (RICO) claim are (1) a person, (2) an enterprise, (3) a
pattern of (4) racketeering activity (5) which causes injury to the plaintiff. 18
U.S.C.A. § 1962 (a, c). ... The Supreme Court has explained that a civil RICO
claim has four essential elements: '(1) conduct; (2) of an enterprise; (3)
through a pattern; (4) of racketeering activity.' ... 'Racketeering activity'
includes mail and wire fraud. See 18 U.S.C.A. § 1961(1)(B). ... For a pattern
of racketeering activity to exist, 'two or more predicate acts of racketeering
must have been committed within a ten-year period.' ... Instead, '[w]e have
reserved RICO liability for ‘ongoing unlawful activities whose scope and
persistence pose a special threat to social well-being.’
Summary
Essential elements required to establish a civil RICO claim, which includes
the necessity of demonstrating a pattern of racketeering activity that causes
injury to the plaintiff. It specifies that racketeering activity can include acts
like mail and wire fraud, and emphasizes that RICO is intended for serious,
ongoing unlawful activities that pose a threat to social well-being. This is

Begala v. PNC Bank, 214 F.3d 776 (6th Cir. 2000)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Sixth Circuit
Extract
Under RICO, an enterprise is prohibited from engaging in a coordinated
effort to collect an unlawful debt. Specifically, the RICO statute provides: It
shall be unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any
enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign
commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of
such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity or
collection of unlawful debt. 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). Plaintiffs' complaint fails
adequately to allege the existence of a RICO enterprise, although not
entirely for the reasons cited by the district court. The district court held
that the complaint had failed to allege an enterprise distinct from PNC
because all of the entities listed in the complaint were subdivisions or agents
of PNC. Under RICO, a corporation cannot be both the 'enterprise' and the
'person' conducting or participating in the affairs of that enterprise. See,
e.g., Puckett v. Tennessee Eastman Co., 889 F.2d 1481, 1489 (6th Cir. 1989).
Under the 'non-identity' or 'distinctness' requirement, a corporation may not
be liable under section 1962(c) for participating in the affairs of an
enterprise that consists only of its own subdivisions, agents, or members. An
organization cannot join with its own members to undertake regular
corporate activity and thereby become an enterprise distinct from itself.
Summary
For a RICO claim to arise, there must be an "enterprise" that is distinct from
the "person" conducting the racketeering activity. The enterprise must
engage in a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt.
The passage emphasizes the need for a distinct entity or association-in-fact
that functions as a continuing unit, which is not met if the alleged enterprise
consists solely of subdivisions or agents of a single entity. This is relevant to
the question as it highlights the necessity of establishing a distinct
enterprise in a RICO claim, which could be applicable in a scheme involving
a wife, a third party, and a relative if they form an association-in-fact that
engages in racketeering activities.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
To state a RICO claim, a plaintiff must plead the following elements: “(1)
conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity.” ... A plaintiff must set forth allegations to establish that the
defendant conducted or participated, “directly or indirectly, in the conduct
of [the RICO] enterprise's affairs.” ... RICO defines an “enterprise” as “any
individual, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity and
any union or group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal
entity.” ... To establish a substantive RICO violation, a plaintiff must show “a
pattern of racketeering activity.” ... A pattern of racketeering activity
requires, at a minimum, two acts of racketeering activity within ten years of
each other.
Summary
To establish a RICO claim, there must be conduct of an enterprise through a
pattern of racketeering activity. The enterprise can be any group of
individuals associated in fact, and there must be at least two acts of
racketeering activity within ten years. The conduct must involve
participation in the operation or management of the enterprise's affairs. This
framework can be applied to the scenario involving a wife, a third party, and
a relative if their actions constitute an enterprise and a pattern of
racketeering activity.
18 U.S.C. § 1962 18 U.S.C. § 1962 Prohibited Activities
Extract
It shall be unlawful for any person through a pattern of racketeering activity
or through collection of an unlawful debt to acquire or maintain, directly or
indirectly, any interest in or control of any enterprise which is engaged in, or
the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce.
Summary
A RICO claim could arise if the actions of the wife, third party, and relative
constitute a "pattern of racketeering activity" as defined by the statute. This
would involve multiple acts of racketeering, such as fraud or obstruction of
justice, that are related and continuous. The actions must also affect
interstate or foreign commerce. If the scheme involves using the legal
process to fraudulently remove a spouse from the marital home and conceal
assets, and these actions are part of a broader pattern of illegal activity, it
could potentially fall under RICO.

Summary
If such a violation occurs, the injured party can sue in a U.S. district court
and potentially recover threefold damages and legal costs. This suggests
that if the scheme involving the wife, third party, and relative includes
activities that constitute racketeering under section 1962, a RICO claim
could be viable.
18 U.S.C. § 1961 18 U.S.C. § 1961 Definitions
Extract
As used in this chapter- 'racketeering activity' means (A) any act or threat
involving murder, kidnapping, gambling, arson, robbery, bribery, extortion,
dealing in obscene matter, or dealing in a controlled substance or listed
chemical (as defined in section 102 of the Controlled Substances Act), which
is chargeable under State law and punishable by imprisonment for more
than one year; (B) any act which is indictable under any of the following
provisions of title 18, United States Code: ... section 1341 (relating to mail
fraud), section 1343 (relating to wire fraud), section 1344 (relating to
financial institution fraud), ... section 1503 (relating to obstruction of
justice), section 1510 (relating to obstruction of criminal investigations),
section 1511 (relating to the obstruction of State or local law enforcement),
section 1512 (relating to tampering with a witness, victim, or an informant),
section 1513 (relating to retaliating against a witness, victim, or an
informant), ... section 1956 (relating to the laundering of monetary
instruments), section 1957 (relating to engaging in monetary transactions in
property derived from specified unlawful activity), ...
Summary
A RICO claim could arise if the actions of the wife, third party, and relative
involve activities that fall under the definition of "racketeering activity" as
per 18 U.S.C. § 1961. This includes acts such as mail fraud, wire fraud,
obstruction of justice, tampering with witnesses, and money laundering. If
the scheme involves transferring money to conceal assets, making false
statements, and using legal processes in a fraudulent manner, these could
potentially be considered as racketeering activities if they meet the criteria
outlined in the statute.

represents the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity, conducts or
attempts to conduct such a financial transaction which in fact involves the
proceeds of specified unlawful activity-(A)(i) with the intent to promote the
carrying on of specified unlawful activity; or... (B) knowing that the

not more than $500,000 or twice the value of the property involved in the
transaction, whichever is greater, or imprisonment for not more than twenty
years, or both.
Summary
A RICO claim could arise if the scheme involves financial transactions
intended to conceal or disguise the nature, location, source, ownership, or
control of proceeds from unlawful activity. This is relevant to the question as
it involves transferring money to conceal assets, which could be considered
a financial transaction designed to disguise the proceeds of unlawful activity.

supervised release, parole, or release pending judicial proceedings; shall be
fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both.
Summary
18 U.S.C. § 1512 addresses actions that involve tampering with witnesses,
victims, or informants in federal proceedings. This includes using
intimidation, threats, or corrupt persuasion to influence or prevent
testimony, or to conceal or alter evidence. In the context of a RICO claim, if
the scheme involving a wife, a third party, and a relative includes actions
that obstruct justice by tampering with witnesses or evidence, it could
potentially fall under this statute. The passage highlights the legal
consequences of such actions, which could be relevant if the scheme
involves federal offenses or proceedings.

Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy
The Brief - American Bar Association - 2024-01-01
Extract
A violation of § 1962(c), the section on which Sedima relies, requires (1)
conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity. The plaintiff must allege each of the elements to state a claim. They
are all equally essential components, and the complaint will fail if any one of
them is not adequately pleaded. In particular, RICO claims based on mail or
wire fraud must comport with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b)’s
requirement that allegations involving fraud be pleaded with particularity...
A plaintiff only has standing to sue if they have been injured in their
business or property by conduct constituting the violation. To establish a §
1962(c) RICO claim, the following elements must be proven: • Enterprise: A
structured group of individuals associated for a common purpose. • Pattern
of racketeering activity: At least two acts of racketeering, as specified within
the statute, within 10 years. • Conduct: Directly or indirectly conducting the
enterprise’s affairs through racketeering. • Injury: An injury to business or
property due to the racketeering activity.
Summary
To establish a RICO claim under § 1962(c), there must be conduct of an
enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity, and the plaintiff must
have suffered an injury to business or property due to this activity. The
passage highlights the necessity of proving an enterprise, a pattern of
racketeering activity, conduct, and injury. These elements are essential for a
RICO claim, and the passage provides a framework for understanding how a
scheme involving transferring money to conceal assets, making false
statements, and using legal processes could potentially fit into a RICO claim
if these elements are met.
RECONCEIVING COERCION-BASED CRIMINAL DEFENSES.
Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology - Northwestern University,
School of Law - Galoob, Stephen R. - 2022-03-22
Extract
The inquiry here is meant to invoke the 'pattern of racketeering activity'
element of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).
The Organized Crime Control Act (1970), which includes RICO, provides that
'criminal conduct forms a pattern if it embraces criminal acts that have the
same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of
commission, or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics
and are not isolated events.' The Supreme Court characterized this
requirement as a 'relationship' element and held that the statute further
requires a 'continuity' element, 'referring either to a closed period of

=== PAGE 25 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
repeated conduct, or to past conduct that by its nature projects into the
future with a threat of repetition.'
Summary
For a RICO claim to arise, there must be a "pattern of racketeering activity,"
which involves criminal acts that are related by purpose, result,
participants, victims, or methods, and are not isolated events. Additionally,
there must be a "continuity" element, indicating either repeated conduct
over a closed period or conduct that poses a threat of future repetition. This
information is crucial in determining whether the actions described in the
question could constitute a RICO violation.
Crimes
The Florida Criminal Cases Notebook. Volume 1-2 - James Publishing
- Joseph C. Bodiford - 2021-04-30
Extract
State must specifically plead a RICO conspiracy if it intends to charge a
defendant accordingly. In a RICO conspiracy, the crime is premised not upon
the commission of the predicate acts of racketeering, or even an agreement
to commit predicate acts, but upon an agreement to participate in the affairs
of the criminal enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. While
the state may plead and prove a substantive RICO charge by establishing a
pattern of racketeering activity that includes conspiracies to commit
predicate acts, this does not convert a plainly pleaded substantive RICO
charge into a RICO conspiracy. A conspiracy to commit predicate acts of
racketeering is different in kind from a conspiracy to conduct the affairs of
the enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity.
Summary
For a RICO claim to arise, there must be an agreement to participate in the
affairs of a criminal enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity.
This means that simply committing predicate acts or agreeing to commit
them is not enough; there must be a broader agreement to conduct the
enterprise's affairs through these acts. The passage clarifies the distinction
between a substantive RICO charge and a RICO conspiracy, emphasizing the
need for a specific agreement to participate in the enterprise's affairs.
Defending Civil RICO Claims: A Defense Plan Should Be In Every Business's
Arsenal

=== PAGE 26 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
RICO is not a simple statute. It pertains to conduct associated with an
'enterprise' and 'a pattern racketeering activity.' An enterprise is an
individual or legal entity, or a union or group of individuals associated in fact
although not a legal entity, while a pattern of racketeering activity requires
long-term, organized conduct to violate state and federal laws. There are
four types of activities outlawed by RICO, and claims under Section 1962(c)
are the most commonly asserted: * Section 1962(a) prohibits a person from
investing in an enterprise any income derived from a pattern of racketeering
activity; * Section 1962(b) prohibits a person from using a pattern of
racketeering activity to acquire or maintain control over an enterprise; *
Section 1962(c) prohibits a person from conducting the affairs of an
enterprise through a pattern of racketeering; and * Section 1962(d)
prohibits a person from conspiring to violate Sections 1962(a), (b), or (c).
Summary
Types of activities prohibited under RICO, including conducting the affairs of
an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering and conspiring to violate
these provisions. For a RICO claim to arise in the context of the question,
the actions of transferring money to conceal assets, making false
statements, and using legal processes would need to be part of a long-term,
organized conduct that violates state or federal laws. Additionally, there
must be an "enterprise" involved, and the actions must form a "pattern of
racketeering activity."
Defending Civil RICO Claims: A Defense Plan Should Be In Every Business's
Arsenal
Extract
RICO is not a simple statute. It pertains to conduct associated with an
'enterprise' and 'a pattern racketeering activity.' An enterprise is an
individual or legal entity, or a union or group of individuals associated in fact
although not a legal entity, while a pattern of racketeering activity requires
long-term, organized conduct to violate state and federal laws. ... Second, to
prove most types of RICO claims, the plaintiff must plead that the defendant
committed some qualifying criminal action, the most common of which is
mail, wire or securities fraud. ... Third, the plaintiff must plead a pattern of
racketeering activity for most RICO claims. If the alleged conduct occurred
once or twice, or was not continuous, it cannot form a pattern of conduct
sufficient to support a RICO claim.

the plaintiff must prove that the defendant committed a qualifying criminal
action, such as fraud, and that there is a pattern of racketeering activity,
which means the conduct must be continuous and not isolated incidents.
RICO: A Primer
Extract
RICO provides for a civil action against persons engaged in a 'pattern of
racketeering activity' or 'collection of an unlawful debt.' A successful
plaintiff may recover treble damages, costs, and attorneys' fees... The heart
of a RICO case is the existence of a pattern of racketeering activity. Under
the statute, 'racketeering activity' includes a host of offenses... A plaintiff is
required to demonstrate that the defendant conducted the affairs of an
enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity... A 'pattern' may exist
where any combination of two or more offenses occurred within a period of
time... A plaintiff may demonstrate a pattern by establishment that the
predicate acts pose a threat of continued criminal activity, which is generally
demonstrated by showing either: Closed-ended continuity. Proving 'a series
of related predicate acts extending over a substantial period of time.' Open-
ended continuity. A threat of 'continuing criminal activity extending
indefinitely into the future,' in light of the nature of the enterprise and
predicate acts alleged.
Summary
A RICO claim requires a pattern of racketeering activity, which involves two
or more predicate offenses. The pattern can be demonstrated through
closed-ended continuity (a series of related acts over time) or open-ended
continuity (a threat of ongoing criminal activity). The actions described in
the question, such as transferring money to conceal assets and making false
statements, could potentially be considered predicate acts if they fall under
the offenses listed in the RICO statute. If these actions are part of a scheme
that shows a pattern of racketeering activity, a RICO claim could arise.
