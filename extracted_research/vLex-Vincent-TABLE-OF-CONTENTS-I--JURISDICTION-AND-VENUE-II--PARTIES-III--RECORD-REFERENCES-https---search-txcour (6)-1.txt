Plaintiff incorporates by reference public records from the Texas Supreme
Court, and requests the court to take judicial notice of these documents. The
Fifth Circuit has repeatedly held that it is proper for federal courts to take
judicial notice of matters of public record, including documents filed in state
court proceedings (Miller v. Dunn, 35 F.4th 1007 (5th Cir. 2022); LUV N'
Care, Ltd. v. Jackel Int'l Ltd., 502 F.Supp.3d 1106 (W.D. La. 2020); Wright v.
Arlington Indep. Sch. Dist., Civil Action No. 4:19-cv-00278-P (N.D. Tex. Nov
25, 2019)). Plaintiff therefore requests that this Court take judicial
knowledge of the consolidated mandamus record, as its’ authenticity is not
reasonably disputed. Here, all record references point to the public
consolidated mandamus record, as submitted to the Texas Supreme Court, a
copy of which has been served upon each defendant named in this complaint
either individually or through their agent. Link to the record: https://

bc41-bbc08c814365 All references to the record are marked herein with
“REC. [page]” and are hyperlinked to take the reader directly to the
reference. The record is filed under affidavit, and remains unopposed at the
time of filing this complaint. Therefore, Plaintiff respectfully asks that the
Court take judicial notice of the record under Federal Rule of Evidence 201,
filed on June 6, 2025, in the Texas Supreme Court under case numbers
25-0361, 25-0367, 25-0378, 25-0426, and 25-0458. II. TIMELINE OF
EVENTS BACKGROUND Morgan Michelle Myers, (“Myers”) and Charles
Dustin Myers, (“Plaintiff”) were married on June 20, 2015, and have two
daughters, C.R.M. and M.E.M, aged seven and nine. The evidence in this
case will show that in early December of 2023, the entire family was
blindsided by Myers’ sudden announcement that she wanted a divorce from
Plaintiff. REC. 717 The evidence will further show that Myers’ reasoning for
this divorce changes over time – beginning with how Plaintiff spoke to her,
and then switches to abuse and sexual harassment, and allegations of drug
abuse, claims that were only brought up in her initial pleadings. On
December 12, 2023, Plaintiff discovered a large volume of text messages
between Myers and two individuals identified as Debbie Price and Damen
Kazlauskas of Fort Worth, Texas spanning between October 2022 and
December 2023. REC. 254-714 In response to this discovery, Myers began to
communicate with Defendant Daniel Kenneth Branthoover, a resident of
Yukon, Oklahoma, who assisted her in the planning, drafting, traveling, and
submitting of fraudulent documents to the 322nd District Court of Tarrant
County designed to divest Plaintiff of his home and business operations.
When these allegations were raised to the State, they failed to adjudicate
them and violated the Plaintiff’s constitutional rights when he was deprived
of the guarantees of equal protection under the law and when he was not
afforded due process before being deprived of his property. REC. 183. The
central question is whether Defendants Munford, Kaitcer, Carter, and Baker
are victims of the initial scheme – or willing participants in an expanded
associate-in-fact enterprise that began in December of 2023 as the Myers-
Branthoover enterprise. A. The Myers-Branthoover Enterprise 1. On
December 14, 2023, Defendants Morgan Michelle Myers (“Myers)” and
Daniel Kenneth Branthoover (“Branthoover”), acting in concert and under
deceptive pretenses, (REC. 1704), initiated text-message communications
through which they formed and advanced a common plan and agreement.
Over the weekend of December 15, 2023, they met in Yukon, Oklahoma, to
further that plan ( REC. 274-278). The deceptive text message from
Defendant Branthoover claiming that he wanted to assist Plaintiff was
following an attempt by Myers to receive an ex-parte order of protection
from the 322nd District Court of Tarrant county, attempted on December 14,
2023 (REC. 78). B. Interstate Travel and Transfer 2. As part of their
agreement, both Defendants planned to draft and submit an original petition
for divorce and an affidavit of indigency to the 322nd District Court of
Tarrant County, with the intended and foreseeable result of removing
Plaintiff from his matrimonial residence at 6641 Anne Court, Watauga, Texas
76148—which also serves as his place of business for clients in the United
States, Canada, and the United Kingdom that rely on his market data
services (REC. 812 ¶ 16). 3. During Defendant Myers’s interstate travel, she
transferred the parties’ marital funds into Defendant Branthoover’s PayPal
account in the amount of $1,576 (REC. 723). Those proceeds funded a
second mobile phone (817-940-0852), listed on the fraudulent pleadings that

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Myers and Branthoover jointly prepared in Oklahoma, which Myers then
carried from Yukon to Texas on December 17, 2023 (REC. 86; 99; 102; 107).
C. Admissions 4. On December 16, 2023, Plaintiff reached out to
Branthoover and requested that the $1,576 be returned as they were needed
for Christmas gifts for the children, and for business advertising expenses
for his business. REC. 728-729. In response, defendant Branthoover
admitted that the purpose of defendant Myers’ visit was to help her prepare
paperwork for divorce litigation and confirmed that the transfer of $1,576
did in fact occur. REC. 730. Plaintiff’s bank statement from December 2023
further confirms this transaction. REC. 723. D. Post-submission
Collaboration 5. On December 18, 2023, defendant Myers submitted the
fraudulently prepared original petition for divorce, and an affidavit of
indigency to the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County. After these
documents were submitted, defendant Branthoover sent a text message to
Plaintiff on December 19, 2023, at 5:50 P.M. CST, holding himself out to be
defendant Myers’ attorney, showing his involvement extends past the initial
help in preparing the fraudulent documents. REC. 1712-1713 6. Four days
later, on December 22, 2023, defendant Myers submitted another knowingly
fraudulent application for protective to the 322nd District Court of Tarrant
County claiming that family violence had occurred on December 18, 2023,
supported by both an affidavit and unsworn declaration. REC. 108-109. E.
Significant and Intentional Misrepresentations 7. On December 27 and
December 28, 2023, respectively, the documents prepared by Myers with
the assistance of Branthoover were served on Plaintiff via the U.S.
Constable, and contained the following misrepresentations: i. That
defendant Myers could not afford court costs; REC. 72, REC. 85-96 ii. That
defendant Myers had an active order of protection against the Plaintiff with
a finding of family violence that had occurred during the marriage; REC. 78
at 10 iii. That defendant Myers was financially responsible for the family
vehicles, rent payments, utilities, and other household expenses, making
herself appear as the primary breadwinner; REC. 92 iv. That defendant
Myers would be harassed or abused if Plaintiff were given her newly
acquired phone number that was obtained while in Oklahoma; REC. 81 at
15. v. That defendant Myers and Plaintiff ceased living together on
December 1, 2023; REC. 74 at 4 vi. That family violence occurred on
December 18, 2023, in the presence of the two Children. REC. 108-109. vii.
That both family vehicles were defendant Myers’ separate property acquired
before marriage. REC. 79 at 11B F. Evidence to the Contrary 8. On the same
day Defendant Myers claimed to be in an emergency requiring the Plaintiff’s
prompt removal from the home, she can be seen at the home with Plaintiff
and the children in no state of emergency and also still cohabitating in the
marital home. REC 1715. 9. Again, on December 29, 2023, Defendant Myers
can be seen with Plaintiff at the family home, smiling and laughing with the
children in no state of emergency and still collaborating with Plaintiff in the
marital home. REC. 1735. 10. The citation for the application for protective
order ordered Respondent to show cause as to why it should not issue with a
hearing scheduled for January 16, 2024. REC. 118. 11. In response to
extensive misrepresentation above, Plaintiff prepared an original answer,
filed a motion to consolidate, and provided background information which
alleged that defendant Myers was intentionally abusing the legal process.
REC. 130-132. Plaintiff was ordered to show cause on January 16, 2024,
regarding the protective order application. REC. 118 G. Inclement Weather

and First Appearance 12. On January 15, 2024, the Tarrant County District
Courts Facebook page sent out a notice informing the members of the public
that the court would be closed on January 16, 2024, due to inclement
weather. REC. 1202. 13. Unaware of the closure at the time, the parties
appeared at the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County on January 16, 2024,
and were met with a dark courtroom, with only one judge in the building at
the time of their arrival – Defendant James Munford (“Munford”). 14.
Defendant Munford summarily ordered the Plaintiff out of his home,
inadvertently assisting the Myers-Branthoover associate-in-fact enterprise of
achieving their primary goal in having the Plaintiff removed from his
residence, despite the broader goal being to obtain a decree of divorce to
permanently divest Plaintiff of his interests. REC. 183. 15. Defendant
Munford’s initial order was baseless, made in the absence of any emergency,
without a hearing, and disregarded the Plaintiff’s pleadings, telling Myers
“you’re going to have to find evidence of family violence!” clearly aware that
this order was made without any regard to the Plaintiff’s constitutional
rights. 16. Defendant Jeffrey Kaitcer, (“Kaitcer”) walked into the courtroom
late due to the inclement weather and turned the courtroom into a laughing
matter as he began to joke with Defendant Munford, and instructed the
parties to download the AppClose app for communication, and the matter
was reset for January 22, 2024. There exists no record of this proceeding,
only marked appearances on the docket. H. Reset #1 – January 22, 2024,
Setting 17. At the January 22 reset hearing, the parties appeared only to
have the case reset once more because defendant Myers allegedly retained
the services of Defendant Cooper Carter, (“Carter”) in the lobby of the
courthouse just moments before the hearing was scheduled to begin. No
appearance can be traced to this setting by either party on the docket (REC.
1551), and once again, no hearing was held, and the case reset for a second
time to February 1, 2024. REC. 186. 18. Kaitcer permitted attorney Dan
Bacalis, Plaintiff’s prior attorney, to fill out the Associate Judge’s Report, and
the parties never went before him as indicated by the case docket’s lack of
appearance on this date by either party. I. Reset #2 – February 1, 2024,
Setting 19. One day prior to the February 1 setting, both attorneys,
Defendant Carter and Dan Bacalis, both amended the petition for divorce
and counterpetition for divorce without the parties’ knowledge. (REC. 189,
REC. 209) These amended documents were similar, submitted on the same
day, and raised concerns for Plaintiff regarding his quality of representation.
20. At the February 1 setting, both parties were in the conference rooms
outside of Defendant Kaitcer’s courtroom, when attorney Bacalis walks in
holding a settlement agreement. When Plaintiff refused this option and
requested that they go have a hearing before the judge. 21. This is when
Bacalis stated, as witness affidavits corroborate, that he “knows this Judge
and this is the best we can get.” and further stated “[w]e’ll be here all day.
We can come back and change it later.” 22. Outraged by this response,
Plaintiff paid very close attention to the settlement offer Bacalis was
pressuring him to sign, and noticed the following provisions: A typed written
Order conforming to this Report will follow within 20 days from the date this
Report is signed. The Temporary Order shall be prepared by DAN BACALIS.
Each attorney should approve the Order. The parties do not need to approve
the Order. The attorney reviewing the proposed Order shall have five (5)
days to do so. There arc no ten (JO) day letters. If an agreement is not
reached, a Motion to Sign shall be filed and set within thirty (30) days from

=== PAGE 5 ===

the signing of this Report. IT IS SO ORDERED (REC. 233) J. Termination of
Counsel and the Emergency Motion 23. With the above provisions in mind,
Plaintiff signed the document and immediately fired his attorney and
provided notice to the court. REC. 221. By doing so, Plaintiff gained access
back to the residency, invalidated the agreement, and was able to use the
time back in the house to run damage control on his business operations
while preparing to expose the Myers-Branthoover enterprise to the court via
a MOTION TO RECONSIDER EVIDENCE AND VACATE TEMPORARY
ORDERS, which was filed on February 9, 2024, within three business days of
the February 1 agreed associate judge’s report being served by the clerk.
REC. 240 24. In this motion, it was specifically stated that: i. “I am seeking
immediate court intervention to correct procedural e rrors and address the
misuse of the legal system by the Petitioner.” REC. 244 ii. “Particularly, Dan
Branthoover became involved. He is the boyfriend of the Petitioner’s Mother.
Shortly thereafter, I received a notice from our joint bank account stating
that $1,576 had just been withdrawn. As our bank statement for December
2023 will demonstrate – the transaction record shows the funds being
transferred directly to Mr. Branthoover’s PayPal account” REC. 245 iii. “The
Petitioner's action of filing for divorce under an Affidavit of Inability to pay
three days after transferring $1,576 to herself starkly contravenes the
mandates set forth in Chapter 10, Section 10.001 of the Civil Practice and
Remedies Code”. REC 247 at B2 iv. “The Petitioner violated Chapter 10,
Section 10.001 a second time within the same document when she
intentionally elected to waive the 60-day waiting period claiming to have an
active protective order against me that found family violence had occurred
during our marriage.” REC 247 at B3. v. “This suit was the second attempt
by the Petitioner to have me removed from the home, which ultimately
succeeded.” REC 248 at D1 25. The motion went on to explain the factual
pattern described up to this point, putting the court on notice of the key
issues with provided exhibits which were duly served on Carter. In response
to Plaintiff’s motion, he received the first of just two email communications
from Carter throughout the case’s history, where she claimed she would be
filing a counter motion when disclosing her availability for the hearing on
Plaintiff’s emergency motion. REC. 2794 No such countermotion was filed
by Carter. K. Summary Judgment and Notice of Hearing 26. By February 22,
no response had been filed by Carter, so Plaintiff filed a Partial Motion for
Summary Judgment. REC. 758. Plaintiff also submitted a proposed parenting
plan as Exhibit D. REC. 769. No response was ever received from Carter. 27.
On February 27, 2024, Defendant Munford signed and issued a notice of
hearing to the parties with the hearing set for March 14, 2024. REC. 776. L.
Plaintiff’s Notice to the Court and Defendant Myers’ Self-Help Remedies 28.
On March 3, 2024, Plaintiff notified the Court that he would not be leaving
the home as it was not in the best interests of his children. REC. 782. 29.
The following day, on March 6, 2024, while walking his daughters to school,
Myers ran inside the family home, and locked him out of the marital
residence, leaving a sign on the door that said “[y]ou should have been out
by Saturday you are now locked out!” REC. 1748. 30. Plaintiff called local
law enforcement to help him regain entry into the home, where mother
produced the agreed associate judge’s report signed on February 1, 2024,
and used it as a means to block Plaintiff’s entrance to the home. 31. To avoid
further conflict, Plaintiff was escorted into the home where he was able to
grab only his computer and a few clothes and went to Flower Mound to

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
temporarily stay with his father until the time of the hearing on his
emergency motion, scheduled for March 14, 2024, at 9:00 A.M. L. The
Hearing On Plaintiff’s Emergency Motion 32. On March 14, 2024, the
parties arrived at the 322nd District Court, and on the way into the
courtroom, defendants Myers and Carter could be seen in the conference
room, quickly shuffling papers back and forth. 33. After checking in with the
bailiff, Plaintiff turned around to see defendant Carter extending to him a
document titled “Temporary Orders” that were the reduced version of the
February 1 associate judge’s report. REC. 888. 34. These orders, which were
not prepared by Dan Bacalis, which were not agreed to by the parties, were
reduced well outside of the 20-day requirement as ordered by the judge, and
which were never filed with the clerk, stated the following
misrepresentations: i. On February 1, 2024, the Court heard Petitioner's
motion for temporary orders. ii. The parties have agreed to the terms of this
order as evidenced by the signatures below. REC. 888. iii. The Court, after
examining the record and the agreement of the parties and hearing the
evidence and argument of counsel, finds that all necessary prerequisites of
the law have been legally satisfied and that the Court has jurisdiction of this
case and of all the parties. REC. 888. iv. The dates that the parties would
have access to the family residence was altered, changing the date Plaintiff
was supposed to leave from March 1, 2024, to March 20, 2024, and
changing Myers’ date of re-entry from March 1, 2024, to March 30, 2024,
leaving a 10-day window where no one would occupy the residence. v. This
modification was made to prevent Myers from being liable for illegally
locking Plaintiff out of the home on March 6, 2024. 35. On the last page of
the orders, Plaintiff’s attorney who was terminated weeks earlier did not
sign the document, and Plaintiff refused to sign the document for the
forthcoming reasons: i. It claimed a hearing occurred on a motion which was
never set for a hearing or served on the Plaintiff and doesn’t exist on the
docket. ii. It was prepared by defendant Carter, not Dan Bacalis. iii. The
associate judge was presiding over a de novo request of his own prior
report. iv. The matrimonial address was incorrect, as it stated “6641 Anns
Court”, rather than 6641 Anne Court. REC. 915, REC. 922 v. The orders
were not in the best interests of the children. vi. Notwithstanding the
Plaintiff’s revocation of consent by filing the emergency motion, the terms
were altered right before they were rendered into effect by defendant
Kaitcer. vii. Plaintiff did not agree to the terms as he was in court that very
day to expose Myers. M. Predicate Acts: Extortion 36. Kaitcer, knowing that
no response was filed, knowing that he was presiding over a hearing to
which he had no subject matter jurisdiction, and knowing that the temporary
orders produced by defendant Carter was served just moments earlier,
signed another associate judge’s report pre-drafted by defendant Carter,
which summarily denied the Plaintiff’s emergency motion, ignored the fact
that Carter had not provided a response, and within the report itself,
Plaintiff was ordered to sign the document that Carter had just presented to
him despite raising objections to its’ contents, and despite his consent not
being present. REC. 795. 37. Finally, defendant Kaitcer refused to consider
Plaintiff’s exhibits, including six affidavits prepared by his business clients
who have been directly affected by his inability to provide the real-time
market data services his clients relied on, who were located throughout the
United States. REC. 851; REC. 854; REC. 857; REC. 860; REC. 863; REC.
867; REC. 870. 38. Following the setting, the orders were rendered into

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
effect without Plaintiff’s signature (REC. 925) , and Plaintiff filed a request
for findings of fact and conclusions of law (REC. 883), and filed and
amended a “Preparatory Notice for Judicial Review” which recounted the
factual timeline up to that point, and included the affidavits that Kaitcer
refused to accept on March 14, 2024. REC. 798, REC. 851, REC. 854, REC.
857, REC. 860, REC. 863, REC. 867, REC. 870. 39. The orders stated they
were to remain in effect until the final decree of divorce, and Plaintiff’s
journey of one-sided appeals began. N. One Sided Appellate Efforts, and
Defective IWO 40. Following the rendition of the temporary orders on March
26, 2024, Plaintiff spent between April 8, 2024 and September 15, 2024,
appealing via mandamus to the Second Court of Appeals and the Texas
Supreme Court. REC. 1010. 41. During the appellate efforts, Carter filed one
of two motions in the case, which was a motion for pre-trial conference filed
on April 24, 2024, on her behalf by Roderick D. Marx, a party not named in
the suit. REC. 1014, REC. 1016. 42. Plaintiff immediately objected to the
pre-trial conference, and no response was ever issued by Carter or the
court. REC. 1018. 43. On April 30th, Plaintiff filed his notice of completion
regarding the parenting course as ordered, despite actively trying to vacate
them. REC. 1047. No parenting course was ever completed by Myers. 44. On
May 2, 2024, Plaintiff’s en banc reconsideration was denied in the Second
Court of Appeals, and he began preparing an appeal to the Supreme Court
of Texas. REC. 1067. 45. On May 19, 2024, Carter sent the second and last
email correspondence that would be received in the case, which falsely
claimed he agreed to the orders signed on March 14, 2024, and requested
that he fill out an IWO, which Plaintiff found to be defective. REC. 1722,
REC. 1728. No further correspondence was received by Carter. O.
Fraudulent Intervention and Branthoover’s Continued Involvement 46. On
June 23rd Plaintiff filed a motion in state court entitled MOTION FOR
JOINDER OF PERSONS NEEDED FOR JUST ADJUDICATION at 12:14 P.M.
REC. 1075. This motion received no response from Carter. 47. On June 23rd
at 1:54 P.M., directly following the submission of the motion, Branthoover
texted Plaintiff stating “Lol. And here comes another denial. Please sue me
individually. Please.”, referring to the earlier filed motion and showing his
continued oversight of the case’s progression since his initial predicate acts.
48. Four days later, on June 28, 2024, the Texas Office of the Attorney
General allegedly filed an intervention pleading, claiming that Plaintiff was
past due on child support, and requested information from Plaintiff. REC.
1099. 49. Most notably, the certificate of service to this intervention
pleading was allegedly signed by Holly Hayes, the designated attorney for
the OAG, yet the name underneath the signature line reads CHOYA
BURKLEY. REC. 1102. 50. Plaintiff promptly objected to the intervention,
and never received any response from the OAG, Carter, or the court. REC.
1106. P. Supreme Court, Rule 12, and Emergency Temporary Orders 51. As
Plaintiff continued to appeal to the Supreme Court of Texas, all prosecution
came to an end in the trial court. It wasn’t until September 15, 2024, that
Plaintiff filed a first amended rehearing motion in the Texas Supreme Court,
(REC. 1136) and after noticing Carter’s lack of participation, he began to
question her authority given several ambiguities surrounding her
representation, and filed a rule 12 motion to show authority. REC. 1170. No
response was ever received to this motion from Carter. 52. At this point,
Plaintiff had been staying in Airbnb homes while he sought relief to ensure
he could remain close to his daughters during this time. On September 26,

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
2024, he filed and later amended an EMERGENCY MOTION FOR
TEMPORARY ORDERS and requested expedited relief by October 1, 2024,
as that was when Plaintiff was forced to move away from the area due to
cost of living being unsustainable. REC. 1184. No response was ever
received from Carter regarding this motion. 53. By October 1, Plaintiff had
no choice but to start pursuing administrative remedies, and thought the
court was biased against him given the case’s history up to that point. He
began to prepare a Joint Motion to Recuse defendants Munford and Kaitcer
and filed it with the clerk of the court on October 7, 2024. REC. 1197. Q.
Predicate Act: Wire Fraud 54. On October 8, 2024, Defendant Munford
signed and forwarded a “Joint Motion to Recuse” attached to his order of
referral to regional presiding judge David L. Evans but was notably missing
the exhibits and affidavit critical to the motion. REC. 1222 55. A copy of this
exchange was sent via defendant Baker on 4:43 P.M. on October 8. REC.
1254 56. Plaintiff immediately pointed out the discrepancies between the
motion filed and the motion forwarded to David L. Evans, where she replied
and admitted that the full document had been e-filed and remains with the
court. REC. 1255 57. Unsatisfied with this response, Plaintiff further pointed
out that the filing size of the document filed and the one referring to David
L. Evans was significantly different. No further correspondence was
received by Baker until the following day. REC. 1256 58. The following day
on October 8, 2024, defendant Munford signed and filed an “Amended Order
of Referral” which had the full motion attached this time, albeit still
modified as the hyperlinks and bookmarks had been removed. REC. 1282 59.
This amended referral was sent via email correspondence by Baker at 11:17
A.M. on October 8, 2024, who stated that due to the size of the motion, it
was split into three parts. REC. 1258. This excuse directly contradicts the
standard filing procedure in Tarrant County, which was raised and
subsequently ignored in an objection. REC. 1269. No response was filed in
regard to the motion to recuse or objection by Carter. R. Recusal Denial and
More Delays, and Federal Removal 60. Justice E. Lee Gabriel was assigned
to hear the motion, which had to be rescheduled due to technical difficulties
for November 7, 2024. REC. 1306. 61. The morning of the hearing, Plaintiff
woke up with a dental emergency, and promptly notified all parties, and
requested a reset for the hearing, which everyone agreed to. REC.
1393-1396. 62. Despite this agreement, the recusal was denied for failure to
appear, and made no mention of the agreement or the emergency. REC.
1398. 63. With no other remedies left, Plaintiff removed the case to Federal
Court on December 2, 2024, which was quickly remanded back on
December 4, 2024. REC. 1426. 64. On December 14, 2024, defendant
Branthoover texted Plaintiff, sending a threat which stated “[w]hen things
all over, you get to deal with me.” at 2:15 P.M. REC. 1720 65. On December
16, 2024, Plaintiff initiated suit against Daniel Kenneth Branthoover in the
Western District of Oklahoma seeking relief in the form of damages from the
ongoing deprivation from his home. REC. 1451. 66. Plaintiff notified the
Texas court of this lawsuit on December 31, 2024. REC. 1446. S. Further
Delays, Motion to Dismiss for Want of Prosecution, and the Original SAPCR
67. On January 24, 2025, Plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss for want of
prosecution due to the total lack of participation in the case by the opposing
party. REC. 1527. No response was ever received from Carter on this
motion. 68. On January 29, 2025, defendant Myers began disposing of
Plaintiff’s personal belongings that remained on the family property. REC.

=== PAGE 9 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
1629-1631. 69. On February 12, 2025, Plaintiff learned that his youngest
daughter was suffering from dental pain due to Myers’ failure to obtain
dental insurance for the children. REC. 3281. 70. By March 14, (REC.
1833-1837) the judges had still not been reinstated from the first recusal,
which lad Plaintiff to reach out to Baker to request a hearing on his
unopposed summary judgment that had been on the docket since February
22, 2024, where he had to remind her to reinstate the judges back into the
case. REC. 1833-1837. 71. Given the delays, and since the case had been
brought in bad faith initially, the Plaintiff opened an original SAPCR suit in
the 233rd District Court of Tarrant County on March 18, 2025, where he
argued for dominant jurisdiction in a cover letter sent to the clerk. REC.
2260. T. Counsel Suddenly Becomes Active 72. The very next day, defendant
Carter filed an original answer filed on her behalf by Roderick Marx. REC.
2279. The motion was a boilerplate motion, and was followed by a motion to
consolidate, which was filed in the wrong court, and was also filed on
Carter’s behalf by RODERICK D. MARX. REC. 2284. 73. The Plaintiff
immediately responded by filing a motion to strike (REC. 1957) a Rule 12
motion to show authority challenging both Carter and RODERICK D MARX’s
authority (REC. 2288) and on March 24, 2025, an emergency ex-parte TRO
to prevent Myers from barring Plaintiff’s access to the home. (REC. 2302)
No responses were ever received from Carter on these motions. 74. On
March 26, 2025, an objection was filed to Carter’s consolidation motion in
the 233rd court. REC. 1881. 75. Plaintiff reached out to the coordinator from
the 233rd and went through the process to present the motion to the judge.
REC. 2338-2341. 76. On March 29, 2025, Plaintiff appeared before Associate
Judge Kate Stone, who refused to hear Plaintiff’s emergency motion despite
no response being filed, and told him to leave the courtroom. The hearing
date scheduled for April 10, 2025, as agreed by Carter and Plaintiff (REC.
2358), was actually un-set by Stone. REC. 2361. 77. The grounds for this
outright refusal was due to Carter calling in a favor from the judge without
even being present in the courtroom, to where Stone left the room, came
back, and told the Plaintiff to leave informing him that a motion to
consolidate would be filed by Carter the following week. U. Five Concurrent
Mandamus Petitions 78. Subsequently, after he was turned away from the
courtroom, Carter’s consolidation motion wasn’t filed until April 4, 2025
(REC. 2367), resulting in two mandamus petitions to try again to have the
March 14, 2024, order signed by Kaitcer vacated, and to compel Kate Stone
to hear the emergency TRO. See 25-0361, 25-0367. 79. On the same day the
mandamus was filed against Stone, District Judge Kenneth Newell sua
sponte granted Carter’s consolidation motion in both courts without a
hearing, and without addressing the emergency situation for the children or
the Plaintiff’s objections, leading to a third mandamus proceeding. REC.
2393, See also 25-0378. 80. On April 23, 2025, a notice of trial setting was
served on the parties by defendant Munford in the midst of all of these
issues. REC. 1773. 81. The same day, Plaintiff filed an objection and
requested an emergency stay. REC. 2219. No response was received to this
objection by either Munford or Carter. 82. Two days later on April 25, 2025,
Plaintiff filed his second recusal motion, and amended it on April 28, 2025,
this time only against Munford, and requested that the rules of procedure be
followed, and objected to the involvement of the court coordinator given the
prior recusal’s ambiguity and significant delays caused by her involvement.
REC. 2488 No response to this motion was ever filed from Carter. 83. Baker

=== PAGE 10 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
continued to be involved in the recusal process, this time erroneously
forwarding an order of referral from defendant Kaitcer, who was not named
in the recusal motion. REC. 2615. 84. Plaintiff immediately objected on April
29, 2025, naming two issues: 1) the coordinator was still involved, and 2) the
order of referral sent by Kaitcer was erroneous. REC. 2620. 84. Plaintiff
objected to the order of assignment of John H. Cayce (REC. 3149) which was
issued on May 7, 2025, due to the unresolves issues. REC. 2620. 85. David L.
Evans overruled this objection on May 15, 2025, leading to mandamus
petition 25-0426, a direct appeal to the Texas Supreme Court. REC. 3507.
86. On May 20, 2025, John H. Cayce summarily denied the recusal, including
the denial of a motion to recuse Kaitcer which was never filed, leading to
mandamus petition 25-0458, a second direct appeal to the Texas Supreme
Court. 87. All five petitions were denied both initially and on rehearing, and
all emergency motions to stay proceedings were dismissed. The only insights
given from the appellate courts was: “Denied, per curiam.” No response was
filed by any implicated judge or opposing counsel. V. Federal RICO Case and
the Push Towards Final Trial 88. In June of 2025, Plaintiff amended his
complaint against Daniel Kenneth Branthoover and enjoined Myers as a
defendant, which they defended pro-se. 89. Plaintiff communicated this
action with the trial court, and no further action was taken in the case until
August of 2025, when defendant Munford sua sponte set the case for final
trial on December 10, 2025. 90. Plaintiff immediately objected to this trial
setting, and moved to recuse Munford for a third time. 91. The court
coordinator continued to be involved in the process, leading to a subsequent
motion to recuse the regional presiding judge, David L. Evans. 92. Plaintiff
now prepares this suit to hold defendants accountable for their collective
actions, and to prevent their common goal from being achieved, which is to
obtain defendant Myers a final decree of divorce. 93. For the forthcoming
reasons, the conduct outlined herein constitutes conduct of an enterprise
through a pattern of racketeering activity, as several predicate acts were
committed, the enterprise shares a common purpose, and Plaintiff has
suffered direct and ongoing injury to business and property as a direct result
of the defendant’s collective predicate acts. RICO The timeline and evidence
provided demonstrate that the Myers-Branthoover group constitutes an
association-in-fact enterprise under RICO, with a common goal to deprive
the Plaintiff of his home and business through a pattern of racketeering
activity—specifically, wire fraud, Travel Act violations, and fraudulent court
filings—causing direct injury to the Plaintiff’s business and property. The
conduct, structure, and continuity among the participants, as well as the use
of interstate communications and travel, satisfy the elements of a RICO
claim in the Tenth Circuit, with the liability of other defendants depending
on their knowledge and intent. A. Summary The Myers-Branthoover
enterprise, as detailed in the factual timeline, meets the Tenth Circuit’s
requirements for a RICO claim by establishing an association-in-fact
enterprise with a defined structure, purpose, and continuity. The group’s
coordinated actions—including interstate transfer of funds, preparation and
submission of fraudulent legal documents, and ongoing manipulation of
court proceedings—constitute a pattern of racketeering activity, with
predicate acts of wire fraud and Travel Act violations that are related and
continuous. Plaintiff’s direct and ongoing injury to his business and property,
including loss of home, business operations, and client relationships, is
proximately caused by the enterprise’s acts. While Myers and Branthoover’s

=== PAGE 11 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
liability is clear, the involvement of other defendants (Munford, Kaitcer,
Carter, and Baker) may be characterized as inadvertent or willing
participation, depending on their knowledge and intent, but the core
elements of a RICO violation are satisfied by the conduct of Myers and
Branthoover as outlined in the enumerated timeline. The additional acts
committed by each defendant, as alleged, furthered the scheme of the
enterprise despite each additional defendant having actual knowledge of the
fraudulent scheme. RICO Statutory Framework The Racketeer Influenced
and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), codified at 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961–1968,
provides a civil cause of action for individuals injured in their business or
property by reason of a pattern of racketeering activity conducted through
an enterprise affecting interstate or foreign commerce. The most commonly
invoked provision, § 1962(c), prohibits any person employed by or associated
with an enterprise from conducting or participating in the conduct of such
enterprise’s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity. Section
1962(d) further prohibits conspiracies to violate any of the substantive RICO
provisions. To establish a civil RICO claim under § 1962(c), a plaintiff must
prove: i. The existence of an enterprise; ii. The enterprise’s engagement in,
or effect on, interstate or foreign commerce; iii. The defendant’s
employment by or association with the enterprise; iv. The defendant’s
participation, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of the enterprise’s affairs;
v. The defendant’s participation through a pattern of racketeering activity or
collection of unlawful debt. See 100 Mount Holly Bypass v. Axos Bank, Case
No. 2:20-CV-856-TS-CMR (D. Utah Jul 27, 2021). B. Predicate Acts and
Pattern Requirement RICO defines “racketeering activity” to include a wide
range of criminal offenses, including wire fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343) and
violations of the Travel Act (18 U.S.C. § 1952). A “pattern of racketeering
activity” requires at least two predicate acts within a ten-year period, but
the acts must be related and amount to or pose a threat of continued
criminal activity. The Supreme Court has clarified that a RICO violation
requires both an “enterprise” and a “pattern of racketeering activity,” with
the enterprise being a group of persons associated for a common purpose,
and the pattern involving a series of criminal acts (United States v. Harris,
695 F.3d 1125 (10th Cir. 2012)). The Tenth Circuit has further explained
that, to establish a pattern, it is not enough to simply show that two
predicate acts occurred within ten years; the acts must also be related and
pose a threat of continued criminal activity (U.S. v. Smith, 413 F.3d 1253
(10th Cir. 2005)). Note, however, that U.S. v. Smith has been stated as
overruled by United States v. Nissen, 555 F.Supp.3d 1174 (D. N.M. 2021) on
unrelated grounds, but its articulation of the pattern requirement remains
consistent with current law. C. Enterprise and Association-in-Fact An
“enterprise” under RICO includes any individual, partnership, corporation,
association, or group of individuals associated in fact, even if not a legal
entity. For an association-in-fact enterprise, the Tenth Circuit requires: i. A
purpose; ii. Relationships among those associated with the enterprise; iii.
Longevity sufficient to permit the associates to pursue the enterprise’s
purpose; iv. A decision-making framework or mechanism for controlling the
group; v. Functioning as a continuing unit; vi. Existence separate and apart
from the pattern of racketeering activity. See 100 Mount Holly Bypass. D.
Conspiracy Section 1962(d) makes it unlawful to conspire to violate any of
the substantive RICO provisions. A RICO conspiracy does not require the
establishment of an enterprise but requires that a defendant adopts the goal

=== PAGE 12 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
of furthering or facilitating a criminal endeavor that would satisfy the
elements of a substantive RICO offense (United States v. Martinez, 543
F.Supp.3d 1209 (D. N.M. 2021); United States v. Randall, 661 F.3d 1291
(10th Cir. 2011)). E. Injury Requirement RICO provides a private right of
action for individuals injured in their business or property through
fraudulent conduct, and there is no requirement that the conduct be
connected to organized crime in a civil setting (Plains Resources, Inc. v.
Gable, 782 F.2d 883 (10th Cir. 1986)). ANALYSIS F. Existence of an
Association-in-Fact Enterprise The timeline establishes that Myers and
Branthoover formed an association-in-fact enterprise beginning in December
2023 (¶¶ 1–7, 93). Their collaboration was structured, with Myers as the
petitioner in the divorce and Branthoover as the planner, drafter, and
facilitator of fraudulent documents and financial transactions. The group
had a clear purpose: to divest the Plaintiff of his home and business through
fraudulent legal filings and manipulation of court processes (¶¶ 1–7, 93).
The enterprise’s structure is evidenced by: i. The initial planning and
agreement to meet in Yukon, Oklahoma, to draft fraudulent documents (¶¶
1–3); ii. The use of interstate communications and travel to further the
scheme (¶¶ 2–3); iii. Ongoing coordination and adaptation to changing
circumstances, including the preparation and submission of false affidavits
and pleadings, and manipulation of court proceedings (¶¶ 5–7, 34, 93). This
satisfies the Tenth Circuit’s requirements for an association-in-fact
enterprise, which does not require a formal legal entity but does require a
common purpose, relationships, and sufficient longevity to pursue the
enterprise’s goals. G. Structure, Purpose, Relationships, and Continuity The
Myers-Branthoover group meets the requirements for an association-in-fact
enterprise: i. Purpose: The shared goal was to deprive the Plaintiff of his
home, business, and property interests through fraudulent means (¶¶ 1–7,
93). ii. Relationships: Myers and Branthoover maintained ongoing
communications, coordinated actions, and divided roles in the scheme (¶¶ 1–
7, 93). iii. Longevity and Continuity: The enterprise operated over a
substantial period, from at least December 2023 through present day 2025,
with multiple related acts and ongoing adaptation to changing
circumstances (¶¶ 1–93). iv. Decision-Making Framework: The group
planned, agreed on steps, and executed those steps in a coordinated manner
(¶¶ 1–7, 93). v. Existence Separate from Predicate Acts: The enterprise was
formed for the purpose of achieving a specific goal and engaged in multiple
acts over time to accomplish that goal. H. Predicate Acts: Wire Fraud, Travel
Act Violations, and Fraudulent Filings The timeline identifies multiple
predicate acts that qualify as racketeering activity under RICO: i. Wire
Fraud: Myers transferred $1,576 in marital funds to Branthoover’s PayPal
account during interstate travel, and these funds were used to purchase a
phone for use in the fraudulent scheme (¶¶ 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 34). The use of
electronic communications (text messages, emails) to plan and execute the
scheme further supports the wire fraud allegation (¶¶ 1–7, 34). ii. Travel Act
Violations: Myers traveled from Texas to Oklahoma to meet with
Branthoover, where they planned and prepared fraudulent legal documents,
which were then transported back to Texas and submitted to the court (¶¶ 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, 7). iii. Fraudulent Filings: The preparation and submission of false
affidavits and pleadings to the court, containing material misrepresentations
about financial status, family violence, and property ownership, constitute
further predicate acts (¶¶ 5, 6, 7, 34). At least two related predicate acts

=== PAGE 13 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
within ten years are required (U.S. v. Smith, 413 F.3d 1253 (10th Cir. 2005)),
and the timeline shows multiple, related predicate acts over a substantial
period (¶¶ 1–93). I. Pattern of Racketeering Activity: Relatedness and
Continuity The predicate acts were not isolated incidents but part of an
ongoing scheme. The acts were related in that they all aimed to deprive the
Plaintiff of his property and business, and they posed a threat of continued
criminal activity, as the enterprise continued to operate and adapt its tactics
over time (¶¶ 1–93). The timeline shows that the enterprise’s activities
extended over a substantial period, with multiple acts occurring over
months and involving ongoing coordination and adaptation to changing
circumstances. J. Injury to Business or Property Plaintiff suffered direct and
ongoing injury to his business and property as a result of the enterprise’s
actions. He was deprived of his home and business operations, lost access to
marital funds, and was unable to provide services to clients, resulting in
financial harm (¶¶ 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 37). These injuries are precisely the type
of harm RICO is designed to redress. Plains Resources, Inc. v. Gable, 782 F.
2d 883 (10th Cir. 1986)). K. Participation of Other Defendants: Inadvertent
or Willing The timeline raises the question of whether Munford, Kaitcer,
Carter, and Baker were victims of the initial scheme or willing participants
in the expanded enterprise. The evidence suggests that, at a minimum,
Myers and Branthoover were the core members of the enterprise, with
others potentially becoming involved through their actions in the legal
proceedings (¶¶ 14–93). i. Inadvertent Participation: Some defendants may
have participated inadvertently, such as by issuing orders or facilitating
court processes without knowledge of the underlying scheme (¶¶ 14–93). ii.
Willing Participation: Others may have become willing participants if they
knowingly furthered the enterprise’s objectives or ignored clear evidence of
fraud and misrepresentation (¶¶ 14–93). RICO does not impose liability for
inadvertent or unwitting participation; there must be knowing and willful
involvement in the conduct of the enterprise’s affairs. For the forthcoming
reasons, Plaintiff alleges that the Defendants are willing participants in the
scheme. VICTIM OR PARTICIPANT RICO liability extends to those who
knowingly participate in the conduct of the enterprise’s affairs, even if they
were not original members (RICO: A Primer (2022-01-31)). The timeline
raises the question of whether Munford, Kaitcer, Carter, and Baker were
victims of the initial scheme or willing participants in the expanded
enterprise. The evidence suggests that, at a minimum, Myers and
Branthoover were the core members of the enterprise, with others becoming
involved through their actions in the legal proceedings (¶¶ 14–93). The
timeline demonstrates that Carter, Kaitcer, and Myers engaged in extortion
by leveraging the threat of adverse legal action, fraudulent court orders, and
the manipulation of judicial process to coerce Plaintiff into relinquishing
property and business interests, satisfying the elements of extortion as a
predicate act under RICO and the Travel Act. Munford and Baker, for their
part, committed wire fraud by intentionally sending altered or incomplete
court documents via interstate email, with the intent to mislead, obstruct
relief, and further the enterprise’s objective of finalizing the divorce and
depriving Plaintiff of his property, thus meeting the requirements for wire
fraud as a RICO predicate act. These acts, as detailed in the timeline, are
not isolated but part of a coordinated pattern of racketeering activity within
an association-in-fact enterprise, as required by RICO in the Tenth Circuit.
The conduct of each defendant is tied to specific predicate acts—extortion

=== PAGE 14 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
for Carter, Kaitcer, and Myers (notably at timeline events 33–37), and wire
fraud for Munford and Baker (notably at events 54–59, 83)—demonstrating
knowing and willful participation in the enterprise’s broader scheme to
deprive Plaintiff of his home and business through fraudulent and coercive
means. A. Extortion and Wire Fraud The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961–1968, provides a civil cause of
action for injury to business or property caused by a pattern of racketeering
activity conducted through an enterprise affecting interstate commerce.
Predicate acts under RICO include extortion (as defined by the Hobbs Act
and the Travel Act) and wire fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343), among others.
Extortion is defined as obtaining property from another, with his consent,
induced by wrongful use of actual or threatened force, violence, or fear, or
under color of official right. The Travel Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1952, includes
extortion as an “unlawful activity” and does not require it to be part of a
business enterprise (U.S. v. Welch, 327 F.3d 1081 (10th Cir. 2003)). The
Tenth Circuit recognizes that extortion under the Travel Act can be
established by showing threats or coercion to obtain something of value,
including property or legal rights, in violation of state or federal law. Wire
fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343 requires (1) a scheme to defraud or obtain
property by false or fraudulent pretenses, (2) intent to defraud, and (3) use
of interstate wire communications to execute the scheme (Clinton v. Sec.
Benefit Life Ins. Co., 63 F.4th 1264 (10th Cir. 2023); United States v.
Holloway, 826 F.3d 1237 (10th Cir. 2016)). The Tenth Circuit requires that
the deprivation of property be a central object of the scheme, and that the
use of wires (including email) be knowing and in furtherance of the
fraudulent scheme (United States v. Tao, 629 F.Supp.3d 1083). B. Extortion
by Carter, Kaitcer, and Myers Extortion, as a RICO predicate act, is defined
broadly under federal law and the Travel Act. It includes obtaining property
or rights through threats, coercion, or misuse of official process (U.S. v.
Welch, 327 F.3d 1081 (10th Cir. 2003)). The Tenth Circuit does not require
extortion to be part of a business enterprise for Travel Act purposes; a single
act suffices if it has the requisite interstate nexus. The timeline shows the
following: i. Event 33–34: Carter, with Myers, prepared and presented
“Temporary Orders” that misrepresented facts (e.g., that Plaintiff agreed to
terms he did not, that a hearing occurred when it did not, and that the
orders were in the best interests of the children). These orders altered the
dates of access to the home to shield Myers from liability for locking Plaintiff
out, and were presented to Plaintiff in a context where he was under threat
of losing his home and business. iii. Event 36: Kaitcer, knowing the orders
were disputed and that no response had been filed, signed an associate
judge’s report pre-drafted by Carter, summarily denying Plaintiff’s
emergency motion and ordering Plaintiff to sign the disputed document,
despite his objections and lack of consent. iv. Event 35: Plaintiff refused to
sign the orders for multiple reasons, including their fraudulent content and
the lack of due process, but the orders were rendered into effect without his
signature. These acts collectively demonstrate the use of legal process and
the threat of adverse judicial action to coerce Plaintiff into surrendering his
property and business interests. The manipulation of court orders, the
misrepresentation of facts, and the pressure to sign under threat of losing
his home constitute extortion under the Travel Act and RICO (U.S. v. Welch,
327 F.3d 1081 (10th Cir. 2003). Myers’s role is clear: she was the beneficiary
and instigator of the fraudulent filings and the manipulation of court

=== PAGE 15 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
process, using the threat of legal action and the actual deprivation of
Plaintiff’s property to achieve her goal. Carter and Kaitcer acted in concert
with Myers, knowingly facilitating the extortion by preparing, presenting,
and enforcing fraudulent orders, and by using the authority of the court to
coerce Plaintiff. The fact that Plaintiff was ordered to sign a document he
objected to, under threat of continued deprivation of his home and business,
is classic extortion by color of official right. All three defendants knew that
Plaintiff did not agree to the order, as he had just fired his attorney to
challenge any basis for an agreement. This implies that despite the motion
being served on all defendants, they chose to ignore the allegations of a
fraudulent scheme and further the affairs of the enterprise. These actions
meet the requirements for extortion as a RICO predicate act: they involved
the wrongful use of threats and official process to obtain property (the home
and business) from Plaintiff, with his consent induced by fear of further loss
or legal harm. The acts were not isolated but part of a coordinated scheme
to achieve the enterprise’s goal of finalizing the divorce and divesting
Plaintiff of his property B. Wire Fraud by Munford and Baker Wire fraud
under 18 U.S.C. § 1343 requires a scheme to defraud, intent to defraud, and
use of interstate wire communications to execute the scheme (Clinton v. Sec.
Benefit Life Ins. Co., 63 F.4th 1264 (10th Cir. 2023); United States v.
Holloway, 826 F.3d 1237 (10th Cir. 2016)). The Tenth Circuit recognizes that
sending altered or incomplete court documents via email, with the intent to
mislead or deprive someone of property or rights, can constitute wire fraud
if the deprivation of property is a central object of the scheme (United
States v. Tao, 629 F.Supp.3d 1083). The timeline shows the following: i.
Event 54: Munford signed and forwarded a “Joint Motion to Recuse”
attached to his order of referral, but the document was missing critical
exhibits and affidavits necessary for Plaintiff’s relief. ii. Event 55: Baker sent
a copy of this incomplete filing via email, representing it as the full
document. iii. Event 56–57: When Plaintiff pointed out the discrepancies,
Baker provided inconsistent explanations, first claiming the full document
was e-filed, then later stating it was split into three parts due to size. iv.
Event 58: Munford signed and filed an “Amended Order of Referral” with the
full motion attached, but with hyperlinks and bookmarks removed, further
impairing the document’s integrity. v. Event 59, 83: Baker continued to
forward altered or incomplete orders and referrals, even when procedural
irregularities were raised. These acts involved the knowing use of interstate
email to transmit altered or incomplete court documents, with the intent to
prevent Plaintiff from obtaining relief and to further the enterprise’s goal of
finalizing the divorce and depriving Plaintiff of his property. The use of email
to transmit these documents satisfies the interstate wire requirement, and
the intent to defraud is evidenced by the deliberate alteration and
misrepresentation of the filings. The conduct of Munford and Baker meets
the elements of wire fraud: (1) a scheme to defraud Plaintiff of property and
rights, (2) intent to defraud by preventing relief and misleading the court
and Plaintiff, and (3) use of interstate wire communications (email) to
execute the scheme (Clinton v. Sec. Benefit Life Ins. Co., 63 F.4th 1264 (10th
Cir. 2023)). The deprivation of property (Plaintiff’s home and business) was
a central object of the scheme, not a minor part. RELATIONSHIP AND
CONTINUITY All these acts—extortion by Carter, Kaitcer, and Myers, and
wire fraud by Munford and Baker—were committed in furtherance of the
Myers-Branthoover enterprise’s overarching objective: to finalize the

=== PAGE 16 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
divorce and divest Plaintiff of his home and business. The acts were
coordinated, continuous, and related, satisfying the RICO pattern
requirement. The timeline shows that each defendant’s conduct was not an
isolated error or routine administrative act, but part of a deliberate scheme
to use the legal process, threats, and fraudulent communications to achieve
the enterprise’s unlawful goals. DAMAGES The harm inflicted upon Plaintiff
is staggering. He has lost the home in which he lived for nearly a third of his
life, the companionship of his spouse, and the society of his children. His
income has collapsed. For two years he has been consigned to a futile
appellate gauntlet, even as Defendants Munford, Kaitcer, Baker, and Carter
have repeatedly exceeded the bounds of their lawful authority in furtherance
of a broader scheme. What began as a concerted effort by Myers and
Branthoover to dispossess Plaintiff of his residence and property
metastasized into a calculated plan to procure a final decree of divorce once
the initial objective had been achieved. The objective was plain: by
engineering a final decree, Defendants would not only hobble Plaintiff’s
ability to bring this suit but also invite invocation of the Rooker–Feldman
doctrine and related abstention principles to preclude federal jurisdiction.
Now, after two years of unremitting effort, Plaintiff seeks the only
meaningful remedy remaining: federal redress to halt the ongoing abuses of
authority, to unwind tainted actions, and to compensate him fully for the
catastrophic losses Defendants have wrought. Take each piece in the TABLE
OF CONTENTS, research the topic, and tie it to the factual timeline, filling
out each element of the RICO complaint and tie each element to the factual
allegations by enumerated paragraph number. What are the legal standards
for pleading the existence, structure, and membership of a RICO enterprise
in the Fifth Circuit, and how should these be supported by factual
allegations?
Answer (Fifth Circuit)
Short response
To plead the existence, structure, and membership of a RICO enterprise in
the Fifth Circuit, a plaintiff must allege specific facts showing an ongoing
organization—formal or informal—with a common purpose, relationships
among members, and continuity, all of which must be distinct from the
pattern of racketeering activity itself. These elements must be supported by
detailed factual allegations as to each defendant’s role, the enterprise’s
structure and function, and how the enterprise operated as a continuing
unit.
Summary
The Fifth Circuit requires that a RICO complaint set out, with particularity,
the existence of an enterprise that is separate from the racketeering acts,
has an ongoing organization, and whose members function as a continuing
unit. The complaint must provide specific facts—not mere conclusory
statements—detailing the enterprise’s structure, purpose, relationships, and

=== PAGE 17 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
the roles of each defendant, as well as how the enterprise’s affairs were
conducted through a pattern of racketeering activity.
To satisfy these standards, a plaintiff must name the individuals or entities
constituting the enterprise, describe the structure and purpose of the group,
explain the relationships and decision-making processes among members,
and show that the enterprise existed independently of the predicate acts.
Each defendant’s participation must be individually described, and the
complaint must plausibly allege that the group functioned as a continuing
unit over time, with sufficient longevity to pursue its purpose, as supported
by the factual timeline and record references.
Background and Relevant Law
Legislative and Regulatory Framework
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), codified at
18 U.S.C. §§ 1961–1968, provides a civil cause of action for injury to business
or property by reason of a pattern of racketeering activity conducted
through an enterprise affecting interstate or foreign commerce. The statute
defines a RICO “enterprise” as any individual, partnership, corporation,
association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals
associated in fact although not a legal entity (18 U.S.C. § 1961(4)). The
“person” alleged to have engaged in racketeering must be distinct from the
enterprise (18 U.S.C. § 1961(3); see also Provost v. First Guar. Bank (W.D. La.
2019)).
A civil RICO claim under § 1962(c) requires the plaintiff to allege: (1) a
person who engages in (2) a pattern of racketeering activity (3) connected to
the acquisition, establishment, conduct, or control of an enterprise (Bustos v.
Invierte En Tex. (W.D. Tex. 2024); D&T Partners L.L.C. v. Baymark Partners
Mgmt., L.L.C. (5th Cir. 2024); Maiden Biosciences, Inc. v. Document Sec.
Sys. (N.D. Tex. 2021)). A “pattern of racketeering activity” requires at least
two predicate acts that are related and amount to or pose a threat of
continued criminal activity (Austin v. Baker & Hostetler, LLP (In re Uplift
RX, LLC) (Bankr. N.D. Tex. 2024); St. Germain v. Howard (5th Cir. 2009)).
Case Law
The Fifth Circuit has developed a clear framework for pleading a RICO
enterprise, especially when the alleged enterprise is an “association-in-fact”
rather than a formal legal entity. The key requirements are:
Existence Separate from Racketeering: The enterprise must exist
independently of the pattern of racketeering activity; it cannot be
defined solely by the predicate acts (Guardino v. Hart (5th Cir. 2023); 
Oblio Telecom, Inc. v. Patel (N.D. Tex. 2008); United Healthcare
Sevices, Inc. v. Next Health, LLC (N.D. Tex. 2021); Whelan v.
Winchester Production Co. (5th Cir. 2003); Montesano v. Seafirst
Commercial Corp. (5th Cir. 1987); U.S. v. Cauble (5th Cir. 1983)).
1. 

=== PAGE 18 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Ongoing Organization: The enterprise must be an ongoing
organization, formal or informal, with associates functioning as a
continuing unit (Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938 (2009), as adopted
in United Healthcare Sevices, Inc. v. Next Health, LLC (N.D. Tex. 2021);
Fulkerson v. Wehner Multifamily, LLC (N.D. Tex. 2019); Delta Truck &
Tractor, Inc. v. J.I. Case Co. (5th Cir. 1988)).
Common Purpose and Structure: The enterprise must have a
common purpose, relationships among those associated, and sufficient
longevity to pursue the enterprise’s purpose (X. Wen v. SanQuest, Inc.
(N.D. Tex. 2025); Masel v. Villarreal (E.D. Tex. 2018); Megatel Homes,
LLC v. Moayedi (N.D. Tex. 2021)).
Decision-Making Structure: The enterprise must function as a
continuing unit, which can be shown by a hierarchical or consensual
decision-making structure (Gordon v. Neugebauer (S.D. Tex. 2014); 
Douglass v. Beakley (N.D. Tex. 2012)).
Specificity in Pleading: The complaint must plead specific facts, not
mere conclusory allegations, establishing the enterprise and the roles
of each defendant (Rodriguez v. Meta Platforms, Inc. (N.D. Tex. 2025); 
Masel v. Villarreal (E.D. Tex. 2018)).
Distinctness: The RICO “person” must be distinct from the
“enterprise” (Whelan v. Winchester Prod. Co. (5th Cir. 2003); Provost v.
First Guar. Bank (W.D. La. 2019)).
Association-in-Fact Enterprises: For an association-in-fact, the
plaintiff must show (1) existence separate from the racketeering
pattern, (2) ongoing organization, and (3) members functioning as a
continuing unit (Oblio Telecom, Inc. v. Patel (N.D. Tex. 2008); Gordon v.
Neugebauer (S.D. Tex. 2014); Delta Truck & Tractor, Inc. v. J.I. Case Co.
(5th Cir. 1988)).
Conspiracy: For a RICO conspiracy claim under § 1962(d), the plaintiff
must allege an agreement to commit predicate acts and plead the
conspiracy and overt acts with particularity (Allstate Ins. Co. v.
Donovan (S.D. Tex. 2012); Chaney v. Dreyfus Service Corp. (5th Cir.
2010)).
Analysis
Application to the Factual Timeline and Table of Contents
I. Jurisdiction and Venue
Jurisdiction and venue are foundational but not unique to RICO; the
complaint must allege that the enterprise’s activities affect interstate or
foreign commerce, as required by 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) (Maiden Biosciences,
Inc. v. Document Sec. Sys. (N.D. Tex. 2021)). The factual timeline supports
this by referencing interstate transfers (e.g., funds from Texas to Oklahoma)

4. 
5. 
6. 
7. 
8. 

=== PAGE 19 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
and the impact on business operations serving clients in multiple states and
countries (see timeline, ¶2).
II. Parties
The complaint must identify the RICO “person(s)”—the defendants alleged
to have engaged in racketeering—and the “enterprise,” which must be
distinct from the person(s) (Provost v. First Guar. Bank (W.D. La. 2019); X.
Wen v. SanQuest, Inc. (N.D. Tex. 2025)). The timeline names Myers,
Branthoover, Munford, Kaitcer, Carter, and Baker, and describes their roles
in the alleged enterprise (see timeline, ¶¶1–93).
III. Record References
The Fifth Circuit permits courts to take judicial notice of public records,
including state court filings, when authenticity is not reasonably disputed
(Miller v. Dunn (5th Cir. 2022); LUV N' Care, Ltd. v. Jackel Int'l Ltd. (W.D. La.
2020)). The complaint’s incorporation of the Texas Supreme Court
mandamus record is proper and supports the factual allegations.
IV. Introduction
The introduction should summarize the nature of the enterprise, the pattern
of racketeering activity, and the injury to the plaintiff’s business or property,
as required by RICO (Bustos v. Invierte En Tex. (W.D. Tex. 2024)).
V. Factual Timeline (A–V)
Each subsection of the timeline should be tied to the elements of a RICO
claim:
A. The Myers-Branthoover Enterprise: The complaint must allege
specific facts showing that Myers and Branthoover formed an
association-in-fact enterprise with a common purpose (to deprive
Plaintiff of his home and business), ongoing organization (planning,
drafting, and filing documents), and continuity (actions spanning
months) (Boyle v. United States, as adopted in United Healthcare
Sevices, Inc. v. Next Health, LLC (N.D. Tex. 2021); Gordon v.
Neugebauer (S.D. Tex. 2014)).
B. Interstate Travel and Transfer: Allegations of interstate activity
(e.g., Myers traveling to Oklahoma, transferring funds) support the
enterprise’s engagement in interstate commerce and the use of
interstate wires, both of which are required for RICO jurisdiction and
for certain predicate acts (wire fraud, Travel Act violations) (Bustos v.
Invierte En Tex. (W.D. Tex. 2024)).
C–E. Admissions, Post-submission Collaboration, Significant
Misrepresentations: These sections provide factual detail about the
roles and relationships among enterprise members, the group’s
purpose, and the ongoing nature of their collaboration, all of which are
• 
• 
• 

=== PAGE 20 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
necessary to plead an association-in-fact enterprise (Fulkerson v.
Wehner Multifamily, LLC (N.D. Tex. 2019); Masel v. Villarreal (E.D. Tex.
2018)).
F. Evidence to the Contrary: Allegations that contradict the
defendants’ representations support the claim that the enterprise
engaged in fraudulent conduct, a key component of many RICO
predicate acts (e.g., wire fraud, extortion).
G–L. Court Proceedings and Manipulation: The timeline’s detailed
account of court proceedings, resets, and manipulation of legal process
demonstrates the enterprise’s ongoing organization and decision-
making structure, as well as the roles of each defendant in furthering
the enterprise’s goals (Gordon v. Neugebauer (S.D. Tex. 2014); Oblio
Telecom, Inc. v. Patel (N.D. Tex. 2008)).
M. Predicate Acts: Extortion: The complaint must allege specific
facts showing that certain defendants used threats, coercion, or misuse
of official process to obtain property or rights from Plaintiff, which
constitutes extortion under RICO (Bustos v. Invierte En Tex. (W.D. Tex.
2024); St. Germain v. Howard (5th Cir. 2009)).
N–Q. Appellate Efforts, Fraudulent Intervention, Wire Fraud:
These sections provide further detail about the enterprise’s continuity,
the roles of each defendant, and the use of interstate wires to further
the scheme, all of which are necessary to plead a pattern of
racketeering activity and the structure of the enterprise (Boyle v.
United States; United Healthcare Sevices, Inc. v. Next Health, LLC
(N.D. Tex. 2021)).
R–V. Delays, Mandamus, Federal RICO Case: The ongoing nature of
the enterprise, the adaptation to changing circumstances, and the
continued pursuit of the enterprise’s goals over time all support the
requirement of longevity and continuity (Delta Truck & Tractor, Inc. v.
J.I. Case Co. (5th Cir. 1988)).
VI. The RICO Enterprise (A–C)
A. Structure and Membership: The complaint must name the
individuals or entities constituting the enterprise, describe their roles,
and explain how they functioned as a continuing unit (Chapter 7.
Pleading and Practice Issues; X. Wen v. SanQuest, Inc. (N.D. Tex.
2025)). The timeline’s detailed account of each defendant’s actions
supports this requirement.
B. Expansion, Purpose, and Continuity: The complaint must allege
facts showing the enterprise’s purpose (e.g., to deprive Plaintiff of
property), the relationships among members, and the group’s
continuity over time (Boyle v. United States; Gordon v. Neugebauer
(S.D. Tex. 2014)).
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 

=== PAGE 21 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
C. Decision-Making and Functioning as a Unit: The complaint
should describe the enterprise’s decision-making structure, whether
hierarchical or consensual, and provide examples of coordinated
actions and adaptation to changing circumstances (Oblio Telecom, Inc.
v. Patel (N.D. Tex. 2008)).
VII. Predicate Acts (A–E)
The complaint must allege at least two predicate acts of racketeering
activity that are related and pose a threat of continued criminal activity
(Austin v. Baker & Hostetler, LLP (In re Uplift RX, LLC) (Bankr. N.D. Tex.
2024); St. Germain v. Howard (5th Cir. 2009)). The timeline provides
detailed factual allegations of wire fraud, extortion, Travel Act violations,
and fraudulent court filings, all of which are recognized predicate acts under
RICO (Bustos v. Invierte En Tex. (W.D. Tex. 2024)).
VIII. RICO Conspiracy (A–B)
For a RICO conspiracy claim, the complaint must allege an agreement
among defendants to commit predicate acts and describe overt acts taken in
furtherance of the conspiracy, with particularity (Allstate Ins. Co. v. Donovan
(S.D. Tex. 2012); Chaney v. Dreyfus Service Corp. (5th Cir. 2010)).
IX. Potential Defenses
The complaint should anticipate and address potential defenses, such as
preclusion, Rooker-Feldman, Younger abstention, and judicial immunity, as
these may bar or limit the RICO claim (Rodriguez v. Meta Platforms, Inc.
(N.D. Tex. 2025)).
X. State Law Claims
While not required for a RICO claim, the inclusion of state law claims (fraud,
abuse of process, intentional infliction of emotional distress) may provide
alternative bases for relief and support the overall narrative of the
enterprise’s conduct.
XI–XIII. Claims for Relief, Damages, Prayer for Relief
The complaint must specify the relief sought, including compensatory,
treble, and punitive damages, as well as injunctive and declaratory relief, as
permitted by RICO and related statutes.
Pleading Standards
The Fifth Circuit applies the plausibility standard from Twombly and Iqbal:
the complaint must contain enough factual matter, accepted as true, to state
a claim to relief that is plausible on its face (Douglass v. Beakley (N.D. Tex.
2012)). Labels, conclusions, and formulaic recitations of elements are
• 

=== PAGE 22 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
insufficient; the complaint must “nudge” the claim across the line from
conceivable to plausible.
Supporting Factual Allegations
To meet these standards, the complaint should:
Name each individual or entity in the enterprise and describe their
roles and relationships.
Detail the structure, purpose, and function of the enterprise, including
how decisions were made and how the group operated as a continuing
unit.
Provide specific facts as to each defendant’s participation in the
enterprise’s affairs and the commission of predicate acts.
Demonstrate that the enterprise existed independently of the
racketeering acts and had sufficient longevity to pursue its purpose.
Tie each factual allegation to the relevant element of the RICO claim,
using record references and supporting documentation.
Exceptions and Caveats
The enterprise must be distinct from the pattern of racketeering
activity; simply alleging a group committed predicate acts is insufficient
(Guardino v. Hart (5th Cir. 2023); Oblio Telecom, Inc. v. Patel (N.D. Tex.
2008)).
The RICO “person” must be distinct from the “enterprise” (Provost v.
First Guar. Bank (W.D. La. 2019); X. Wen v. SanQuest, Inc. (N.D. Tex.
2025)).
The complaint must avoid lumping defendants together and must plead
specific facts as to each defendant’s role (Rodriguez v. Meta Platforms,
Inc. (N.D. Tex. 2025)).
Khurana v. Innovative Health Care Systems, Inc., 130 F.3d 143 (5th Cir.
1997), was vacated by a later case, so while its discussion of
association-in-fact enterprises is instructive, reliance should be placed
on more recent and controlling Fifth Circuit authority.
Conclusion
In the Fifth Circuit, pleading the existence, structure, and membership of a
RICO enterprise requires detailed, specific factual allegations showing an
ongoing organization with a common purpose, relationships among
members, and continuity, all distinct from the racketeering acts themselves.
The complaint must describe the enterprise’s structure, purpose, and
function, name each member and their role, and tie each defendant’s
conduct to the enterprise’s affairs and the commission of predicate acts, as
supported by the factual timeline and record references. Meeting these
standards is essential to survive a motion to dismiss and proceed with a
RICO claim.

Crowe v. Henry, 43 F.3d 198 (5th Cir. 1995)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
A plaintiff asserting a RICO claim must allege the existence of an enterprise.
Montesano v. Seafirst Commercial Corp., 818 F.2d 423, 427 (5th Cir.1987). A
RICO enterprise can be either a legal entity or an association-in-fact. Manax
v. McNamara, 842 F.2d 808, 811 (5th Cir.1988). ... To establish an
association-in-fact enterprise, a plaintiff must 'show evidence of an ongoing
organization, formal or informal, and ... evidence that the various associates
function as a continuing unit.'
Summary
In the Fifth Circuit, a plaintiff must allege the existence of a RICO
enterprise, which can be a legal entity or an association-in-fact. For an
association-in-fact, the plaintiff must show evidence of an ongoing
organization, whether formal or informal, and that the associates function as
a continuing unit. This establishes the legal standard for pleading a RICO
enterprise in the Fifth Circuit.
Montesano v. Seafirst Commercial Corp., 818 F.2d 423 (5th Cir. 1987)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
In Atkinson v. Anadarko Bank & Trust Co., 808 F.2d 438 (5th Cir.1987), we
held that to establish an association in fact enterprise, the plaintiff must
show 'evidence of an ongoing organization, formal or informal, and ...
evidence that the various associates function as a continuing unit.' Id. at 440
(quoting United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 583, 101 S.Ct. 2524, 2528,
69 L.Ed.2d 246 (1981); Shaffer v. Williams, 794 F.2d 1030, 1032 (5th Cir.
1986)). This enterprise is not a 'pattern of racketeering activity,' but must be
'an entity separate and apart from the pattern of activity in which it
engages.'
Summary
Clear standard for pleading a RICO enterprise in the Fifth Circuit. It
requires evidence of an ongoing organization, whether formal or informal,
and evidence that the associates function as a continuing unit. Importantly,
the enterprise must be distinct from the pattern of racketeering activity
itself, meaning it must exist as an entity separate from the illegal acts it
engages in. This standard is crucial for plaintiffs to meet when alleging a
RICO violation, as the existence of an enterprise is an essential element of a
RICO claim.

Allstate Ins. Co. v. Donovan, CIVIL ACTION NO. H-12-0432 (S.D. Tex. Jul 03,
2012)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of Texas
Extract
The Fifth Circuit has stated that 'the core of a RICO civil conspiracy is an
agreement to commit predicate acts, [therefore] a RICO civil conspiracy
complaint, at the very least, must allege specifically such an agreement.' Tel-
Phonic, 975 F.2d at 1140. '[A] plaintiff alleging a conspiracy to commit fraud
[claim] must 'plead with particularity the conspiracy as well as the overt
acts... taken in furtherance of the conspiracy.' Kanneqanti, 565 F.3d at 193.
Summary
The passage provides insight into the requirements for pleading a RICO
enterprise in the Fifth Circuit. It emphasizes the necessity of alleging an
agreement to commit predicate acts and the need to plead the conspiracy
and overt acts with particularity. This aligns with the broader requirement in
RICO cases to establish the existence of an enterprise and its activities
through detailed factual allegations.
Khurana v. Innovative Health Care Systems, Inc., 130 F.3d 143 (5th Cir.
1997)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
The statutory definition of enterprise includes 'any individual, partnership,
corporation, association, or other alleged legal entity, and any union or
group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.' 18 U.S.C.
§ 1961(4). Khurana alleged that the enterprise is an association-in-fact of all
five defendants (the three individuals and the two corporate entities).
Summary
The passage provides insight into the statutory definition of a RICO
enterprise under 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4), which includes any group of
individuals associated in fact, even if not a legal entity. The case illustrates
that a RICO enterprise can be alleged as an association-in-fact of multiple
defendants, including individuals and corporate entities. This aligns with the
requirement that a RICO enterprise must have a structure, purpose, and
continuity, and the factual allegations should support these elements by
detailing the relationships and roles of the members within the enterprise.

BT (N.D. Tex. Feb 26, 2021)
U.S. District Court — Northern District of Texas
Extract
A RICO plaintiff must allege facts to show a 'pattern of racketeering activity,'
which consists of two or more predicate criminal acts that are (1) related
and (2) amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity. See 18
U.S.C. §§ 1961(5), 1962(c). ... Walker v. Beaumont Indep. Sch. Dist., 938 F.3d
724, 738 (5th Cir. 2019) (citing In re McCann, 268 F. App'x 359, 366 (5th Cir.
2008)); see also Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938, 946 (2009) (an
informal enterprise, or association-in-fact enterprise, must have at least
three structural features: 'a purpose, relationships among those associated
with the enterprise, and longevity sufficient to permit these associates to
pursue the enterprise's purpose.'). If a complaint 'alleges an enterprise
created by the alleged racketeering activity itself,' it has not sufficiently
pleaded 'the existence of an enterprise separate and apart from the pattern
of racketeering activity in which it engages.'
Summary
Requirements for pleading a RICO enterprise in the Fifth Circuit,
emphasizing the need for a pattern of racketeering activity and the
structural features of an association-in-fact enterprise. It highlights that an
enterprise must have a purpose, relationships, and longevity, and must exist
separately from the racketeering activity.

associated in fact although not a legal entity.' Allstate Ins. Co. v. Plambeck,
802 F.3d 665, 673 (5th Cir. 2015) (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4)).
Summary
Definition of a RICO enterprise as recognized in the Fifth Circuit, which
includes any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or group of
individuals associated in fact, even if not a legal entity. This definition is
crucial for understanding how to plead the existence of a RICO enterprise in
the Fifth Circuit.

Guardino v. Hart, 22-20278 (5th Cir. Jun 05, 2023)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
18 U.S.C. § 1962(b) and (c) prohibit any person from gaining an interest in
or conducting the affairs of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering
activity. While the RICO statute defines 'enterprise' broadly to include a
'group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity,' 18 U.S.C.
§ 1961(4), an association-in-fact enterprise must have an existence 'that can
be defined apart from the commission of the predicate acts.'
Summary
The passage provides insight into the requirements for pleading a RICO
enterprise in the Fifth Circuit. It emphasizes that an association-in-fact
enterprise must have an existence that is separate and distinct from the
pattern of racketeering activity. This means that the enterprise should have
a purpose, structure, and function that are independent of the criminal acts
it engages in. The passage highlights the necessity of alleging more than
just the commission of predicate acts to establish the existence of a RICO
enterprise.
Whelan v. Winchester Production Co., 319 F.3d 225 (5th Cir. 2003)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
Central to the district court's grant of summary judgment was its conclusion
that Whelan failed to demonstrate an enterprise. An enterprise is a group of
persons or entities associating together for the common purpose of
engaging in a course of conduct. United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576,
583, 101 S.Ct. 2524, 2528, 69 L.Ed.2d 246 (1981). The enterprise may be a
legal entity or 'any union or group of individuals associated in fact although
not a legal entity.' 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4) (emphasis added). The plaintiff
alleging an association-in-fact enterprise must adduce evidence
demonstrating '`an ongoing organization, formal or informal, and ...
evidence that the various associates function as a continuing unit'.
Summary
Clear definition of what constitutes an enterprise under RICO in the Fifth
Circuit. It emphasizes that an enterprise can be a legal entity or an
association-in-fact, which requires evidence of an ongoing organization and
that the associates function as a continuing unit. This aligns with the
broader understanding of RICO enterprises, as established in United States
v. Turkette. The passage is applicable to any RICO case within the Fifth

Circuit, making it a general standard for pleading the existence, structure,
and membership of a RICO enterprise.
Amuneke-Nze v. Crain
U.S. District Court — Western District of Texas
Extract
To state a civil RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962, a plaintiff must allege (1)
a person who engages in (2) a pattern of racketeering activity, (3) connected
to the acquisition, establishment, conduct, or control of an enterprise.
Abraham v. Singh, 480 F.3d 351, 355 (5th Cir. 2007). To establish a 'pattern
of racketeering activity,' a plaintiff must allege 'two or more predicate
criminal acts that are (1) related and (2) amount to or pose a threat of
continued criminal activity.' St. Germain v. Howard, 556 F.3d 261, 263 (5th
Cir. 2009). The RICO statute proscribes various categories of predicate acts
that may constitute racketeering activity, including extortion and mail and
wire fraud. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1). Section 1961 defines an enterprise as 'any
individual, partnership, corporation, association or other legal entity, and
any union or group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal
entity.' Allstate Ins. Co. v. Plambeck, 802 F.3d 665, 673 (5th Cir. 2015)
(quoting 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4)). An enterprise '(1) must have an existence
separate and apart from the pattern of racketeering, (2) must be an ongoing
organization and (3) its members must function as a continuing unit as
shown by a hierarchical or consensual decision making structure.' Id.
(citation omitted).
Summary
Clear outline of the legal standards for pleading a RICO claim in the Fifth
Circuit. It specifies the need to allege a person engaged in a pattern of
racketeering activity connected to an enterprise. It also defines what
constitutes a pattern of racketeering activity and an enterprise, emphasizing
the need for the enterprise to have an existence separate from the
racketeering activity and to function as a continuing unit.
Dell Inc. v. Mishra, CAUSE NO.: A-16-CV-00641-SS (W.D. Tex. Aug 03, 2018)
U.S. District Court — Western District of Texas
Extract
RICO defines 'enterprise' to include 'any individual, partnership,
corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of
individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.' 18 U.S.C.A. §
1961(4). If the alleged enterprise is an association-in-fact, the plaintiff must
show evidence of an ongoing organization, formal or informal, and by

=== PAGE 28 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
evidence that the various associates in the enterprise function as a
continuing unit with a common purpose. Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S.
938, 944-45 (2009). The Fifth Circuit also requires a plaintiff establish the
association-in-fact enterprise (1) has an existence separate and apart from
the pattern of racketeering, (2) is an ongoing organization and (3) has
members that function as a continuing unit as shown by a hierarchical or
consensual decision making structure.
Summary
Clear explanation of the legal standards for pleading a RICO enterprise in
the Fifth Circuit. It specifies that an association-in-fact enterprise must have
an existence separate from the racketeering pattern, be an ongoing
organization, and have members functioning as a continuing unit with a
decision-making structure. This aligns with the requirements set forth in
Boyle v. United States and is applicable to RICO claims in the Fifth Circuit.
Trevino v. Pechero, 592 F.Supp.2d 939 (S.D. Tex. 2008)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of Texas
Extract
RICO requires a showing that (1) a person that engages in (2) a pattern of
racketeering activity, (3) connected to the acquisition, establishment,
conduct, or control of an enterprise. Crowe v. Henry, 43 F.3d 198, 204 (5th
Cir.1995) (quoting Delta Truck & Tractor, Inc. v. J.I. Case Co., 855 F.2d 241
(5th Cir.1988)) (emphasis in original). ... In the Fifth Circuit, a plaintiff must
distinguish between RICO persons and RICO enterprises. Abraham v. Singh,
480 F.3d 351, 357 (5th Cir.2007). The enterprise is not a pattern of
racketeering activity, but must exist separate and apart from the pattern of
racketeering activity in which it engages. Whelan v. Winchester Production
Co., 319 F.3d 225, 229 (5th Cir.2003). The Court is not aware of cases which
indicate that the Fifth Circuit requires any sort of formal structure within an
association-in-fact enterprise.
Summary
Requirements for a RICO claim in the Fifth Circuit, emphasizing the need to
distinguish between RICO persons and enterprises. It clarifies that an
enterprise must exist separately from the pattern of racketeering activity
and does not require a formal structure. This information is crucial for
understanding how to plead the existence, structure, and membership of a
RICO enterprise in the Fifth Circuit.

Extract
In order to demonstrate a RICO conspiracy under § 1962(d), the Receivers
must demonstrate '(1) that two or more people agreed to commit a
substantive RICO offense and (2) that [DSC] knew of and agreed to the
overall objective of the RICO offense.' United States v. Sharpe, 193 F.3d 852,
869 (5th Cir.1999). A person cannot be held liable for a RICO conspiracy
'merely by evidence that he associated with other... conspirators or by
evidence that places the defendant in a climate of activity that reeks of
something foul.'
Summary
Requirements for pleading a RICO conspiracy in the Fifth Circuit. It
specifies that to establish a RICO conspiracy, it must be shown that two or
more people agreed to commit a substantive RICO offense and that the
defendant knew of and agreed to the overall objective of the RICO offense.
Mere association with conspirators or being in a suspicious environment is
insufficient for liability. This provides a clear standard for what must be
demonstrated in terms of agreement and knowledge for a RICO conspiracy
claim.

Extract
A RICO enterprise is 'any individual, partnership, corporation, association,
or other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals associated in fact
although not a legal entity.' 18 U.S.C. § 1961. Generally, '[a] RICO enterprise
can be either a legal entity or an association-in-fact.' Crowe v. Henry, 43 F.3d
198, 204 (5th Cir. 1995) (citing Manax v. McNamara, 842 F.2d 808, 811 (5th
Cir. 1988)). An association-in-fact enterprise, however, is 'simply a
continuing unit that functions with a common purpose.' Boyle v. United
States, 556 U.S. 938, 948 (2009). It need not have a hierarchical structure,

Masel v. Villarreal, Civil Action No. 4:17-CV-00533 (E.D. Tex. Apr 18, 2018)
U.S. District Court — Eastern District of Texas
Extract
A plaintiff asserting a civil RICO claim must allege the existence of such an
enterprise. An enterprise is a group of persons or entities associating
together for the common purpose of engaging in a course of conduct. The
enterprise may be a legal entity or 'any group of individuals associated in
fact although not a legal entity.' An association-in-fact enterprise, 'need not
have a hierarchical structure or a 'chain of command'; decisions may be
made on an ad hoc basis and by any number of methods. Members of the
group need not have fixed roles; different members may perform different
roles at different times.' The plaintiff 'must plead specific facts, not mere
conclusory allegations, which establishes the enterprise.'
Summary
Requirements for pleading a RICO enterprise in the Fifth Circuit,
emphasizing the need for specific factual allegations that demonstrate a
group of individuals associating for a common purpose. It clarifies that an
enterprise can be an association-in-fact without a formal structure, and that
plaintiffs must provide specific facts rather than conclusory statements to
establish the enterprise.

Summary
Elements required to establish a RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) in the
Fifth Circuit, which includes demonstrating conduct of an enterprise
through a pattern of racketeering activity. It specifies that an enterprise can
be a legal entity or an association-in-fact, which is a group of individuals

U.S. v. Cauble, 706 F.2d 1322 (5th Cir. 1983)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
The statute states: 'enterprise' includes any individual, partnership,
corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of
individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.' The Supreme Court
has held that this language encompasses both wholly legal entities and
completely illegal associations-in-fact. But '[t]he 'enterprise' is not the
'pattern of racketeering activity'; it is an entity separate and apart from the
pattern of activity in which it engages.' Therefore, in every case the
government must prove not only that there was a pattern of racketeering
activity but that it was conducted through an enterprise as thus defined.
Summary
The passage from U.S. v. Cauble provides insight into the legal standards for
pleading a RICO enterprise in the Fifth Circuit. It clarifies that an
"enterprise" under RICO can include both legal entities and associations-in-
fact, which are groups of individuals associated together for a common
purpose. Importantly, the enterprise must be distinct from the pattern of
racketeering activity itself. This means that in a RICO case, it is not enough
to show that racketeering acts occurred; it must also be demonstrated that
these acts were conducted through an enterprise. This distinction is crucial
for establishing the existence, structure, and membership of a RICO
enterprise.

other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals associated in fact
although not a legal entity.' 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1961(4). In United States v.
Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 583, 101 S.Ct. 2524, 2528-29, 69 L.Ed.2d 246
(1981), the Supreme Court stressed that continuity is a necessary attribute
of an association-in-fact enterprise. We have incorporated this notion of
continuity into our definition of such enterprises.
Summary
The passage highlights that in the Fifth Circuit, the concept of continuity is
essential for defining an association-in-fact enterprise under RICO. This
means that the enterprise must have a continuous existence beyond the
commission of the predicate acts. The enterprise can include any group of
individuals associated in fact, even if not a legal entity, and must have a
structure that allows it to pursue its goals over time.

An enterprise is a group of persons or entities associating for the common
purpose of engaging in a course of conduct. Whelan v. Winchester Prod. Co.,
319 F.3d 225, 229 (5th Cir. 2003). The statute defines 'enterprise' as
including any individual, partnership, corporation, association or other legal
entity, and any union or group of individuals associated in fact although not
a legal entity. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4). The enterprise must be an entity separate
and apart from the pattern of activity in which it engages. United States v.
Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 583 (1981). Moreover, the defendant who commits
the predicate offenses must also be distinct from the enterprise.

A 'person' within the meaning of RICO 'includes any individual or entity
capable of holding a legal or beneficial interest in property.' 18 U.S.C. §

threat of engaging in the acts of racketeering.' Crowe v. Henry, 43 F.3d 198,
204 (5th Cir. 1995). ... Finally, the third element—connection to the
acquisition, establishment, conduct or control of an enterprise. 'An
enterprise is a group of persons or entities associating together for the
common purpose of engaging in a course of conduct.' Whelan, 319 F.3d at
229 (citing United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 583 (1981)). 'The
enterprise may be a legal entity or 'any group of individuals associated in

functions with a common purpose.' Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938, 948
(2009).
Summary
The passage provides insight into the legal standards for pleading a RICO
enterprise in the Fifth Circuit. It explains that a RICO "person" is broadly
defined and must pose a continuous threat of engaging in racketeering acts.
It also clarifies that an "enterprise" can be a legal entity or an association-in-
fact, which is a group of individuals associated together for a common
purpose. This association must function as a continuing unit. These elements
must be supported by factual allegations demonstrating the enterprise's
structure, purpose, and continuity.
Oblio Telecom, Inc. v. Patel, 711 F.Supp.2d 668 (N.D. Tex. 2008)
U.S. District Court — Northern District of Texas
Extract
An association-in-fact enterprise “(1) must have an existence separate and
apart from the pattern of racketeering, (2) must be an ongoing
organization[,] and (3) its members must function as a continuing unit as
shown by a hierarchical or consensual decision making structure.” Crowe,
43 F.3d at 205; Calcasieu, 943 F.2d at 1461; Delta Truck, 855 F.2d at 243.
“Since an association-in-fact enterprise must have an existence separate and
apart from the pattern of racketeering, proof of a pattern of racketeering
activity does not necessarily establish a RICO enterprise.” Calcasieu, 943 F.
2d at 1461 (internal citation omitted).
Summary
Requirements for pleading a RICO enterprise in the Fifth Circuit. It specifies
that an association-in-fact enterprise must have an existence separate from
the pattern of racketeering, be an ongoing organization, and have members
functioning as a continuing unit with a decision-making structure. This
means that simply proving a pattern of racketeering is insufficient; there
must be specific factual allegations that establish the enterprise's separate
existence and organizational structure.

2090, 150 L.Ed.2. 198 (2001). ... The Second Amended Complaint alleges
that 'Duhon and Plaintiff each constituted a 'person' within the meaning of
18 U.S.C. § 1961(3), as each was capable of holding a legal or beneficial
interest in property,' and that 'the corporation First Guaranty Bank
constituted an 'Enterprise' within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4)'
because '[a]mong other things, the Enterprise provided loans and other
banking services across multiple states, and it transacted business through
the use of the United States mails and interstate telephone wires.' (Rec.
Doc. 40, ¶¶ 147-149). The Second Amended Complaint further pleads that
'Senior Vice President Duhon is a separate person, distinct from the
Enterprise itself, who unlawfully used the Enterprise as a vehicle through
which unlawful activity was committed.' (Id. at 150).
Summary
Requirement for a RICO claim to establish two distinct entities: a "person"
and an "enterprise." It emphasizes that the "person" must be distinct from
the "enterprise" and that the enterprise must engage in activities affecting
interstate commerce. The passage also illustrates how factual allegations
should support these elements by detailing the roles and actions of the
"person" and the "enterprise."

900 F.Supp.2d 736 Douglass v. Beakley
Extract
In analyzing a motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) (“Rule
12(b)(6)”), the Court accepts all well-pleaded facts as true, viewing them in
the light most favorable to the plaintiff. Martin K. Eby Constr. Co. v. Dall.
Area Rapid Transit, 369 F.3d 464, 467 (5th Cir.2004). The motion should be
granted only if the complaint does not include enough facts to state a claim
to relief that is plausible on its face. Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544,
570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). A claim must be “nudged ...
across the line from conceivable to plausible.” Id. “A pleading that offers
‘labels and conclusions' or ‘a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause
of action will not do.’ ” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937,

The statutory definition of a RICO enterprise is an 'individual, partnership,
corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of
individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.' 18 U.S.C. §
1961(4). An enterprise 'does not have to be a formal or legal entity, but it
must have some sort of hierarchical or consensual decision-making
structure, and it must exist for purposes other than just to commit predicate
acts.' Walker v. Beaumont Indep. Sch. Dist., 938 F.3d 724, 738 (5th Cir.

Rodriguez v. Meta Platforms, Inc.
Extract
Although the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act (“RICO”)
recognizes a civil RICO claim,[] and Plaintiff cites to RICO, he fails to
identify which of the four substantive violations he asserts. See 18 U.S.C. §
1962(a)-(d). The elements required to state a claim vary according to the
particular RICO claim asserted.[] Regardless of which of the four RICO
sections Plaintiff relies upon, three threshold elements must be met.[] The
defendant must be (1) a person who engages in (2) a pattern of racketeering
activity (3) connected to the acquisition, establishment, conduct, or control
of an enterprise.[] A pattern of racketeering activity consists of two or more
predicate acts, federal or state, that are (1) related and (2) amount to or
pose a threat of continued criminal activity.[] A RICO plaintiff “must plead
specific facts, not mere conclusory allegations, which establish the
enterprise,”[] and “plaintiff must plead the specified facts as to each
defendant. It cannot. .. ‘lump[ ] together the defendants.&#39;”[]
Plaintiff&#39;s Complaint includes conclusory allegations of “defamation,
unauthorized access, and systematic harassment,”[] but those activities do
no not constitute “racketeering activity” as defined in the RICO statute.[]
Further, he does not allege any specific facts, dates, names, communications
or events to support his conclusory allegations of criminal activity, nor does
he explain how these acts constitute “racketeering” activity or are related to
a continued threat of criminal activity. Plaintiff&#39;s broad use of the term
“RICO” is insufficient to state a claim.
Summary
Requirements for pleading a RICO claim in the Fifth Circuit, emphasizing
the need for specific factual allegations rather than conclusory statements.
It highlights the necessity of identifying the specific RICO violation,
establishing a pattern of racketeering activity, and connecting it to an
enterprise. The passage also stresses the importance of detailing the
involvement of each defendant individually, rather than making generalized
allegations against a group.

Summary
Clear standard for what constitutes a pattern of racketeering activity under
RICO in the Fifth Circuit. It specifies that a plaintiff must allege two or more
predicate acts that are related and pose a threat of continued criminal
activity. This is essential for establishing a RICO claim, as it defines the
threshold for what constitutes a pattern of racketeering activity.
Bustos v. Invierte En Tex.
Extract
To state a civil RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962, a plaintiff must allege
three common elements: “(1) a person who engages in (2) a pattern of
racketeering activity, (3) connected to the acquisition, establishment,
conduct, or control of an enterprise.” N. Cypress Med. Ctr. Operating Co.,
Ltd. v. Cigna Healthcare, 781 F.3d 182, 201 (5th Cir. 2015) (quotation
omitted). An act of “racketeering activity,” commonly referred to as a
“predicate act,” is defined to include certain criminal acts, including mail
and wire fraud, and any act indictable under the Immigration and
Nationality Act. See 18 U.S.C § 1961 (defining “racketeering activity”);
Waste Mgmt. of La., L.L.C. v. River Birch, Inc., 920 F.3d 958, 964 (5th Cir.

Church, Inc. v. Sawyer, 90 F.3d 118, 122 (5th Cir. 1996) (quoting In re
Burzynski, 989 F.2d 733, 741-42 (5th Cir. 1993)). The RICO statute defines
an enterprise as “any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or
other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals associated in fact
although not a legal entity.” 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4). The Fifth Circuit has
further explained that an “enterprise can be either a legal entity or an
association-in-fact.” St. Paul Mercury Ins. Co. v. Williamson, 224 F.3d 425,
440 (5th Cir. 2000). An association-in-fact enterprise “must have at least
three structural features: a purpose, relationships among those associated
with the enterprise, and longevity sufficient to permit these associates to
pursue the enterprise's purpose.” Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938, 946
(2009). In essence, “an association-in-fact enterprise is a group of persons
associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a course of
conduct.” Id. (quotations omitted). To allege that an enterprise is an
association-in-fact, a plaintiff must plausibly allege that the organization
“functions as a continuing unit over time through a hierarchical or
consensual decision-making structure.” Elliott v. Foufas, 867 F.2d 877, 881
(5th Cir. 1989). Additionally, the Fifth Circuit has held that the defendant
who allegedly engaged in racketeering-the RICO person-must be “distinct
from the [RICO] enterprise” with respect to claims asserted under 18 U.S.C.
§§ 1962(c) and 1962(d). Id. at 881. This “separate and distinct” requirement
means that a plaintiff cannot claim that a company is both the RICO
enterprise and the “RICO person” who engaged in racketeering. See Whelan
v. Winchester Prod. Co., 319 F.3d 225, 229 (5th Cir. 2003).
Summary
Detailed explanation of the legal standards for pleading a RICO enterprise in
the Fifth Circuit. It outlines the requirements for an enterprise, including
the need for a distinct RICO person and enterprise, and the structural
features of an association-in-fact enterprise. This information is directly
relevant to understanding how to support a RICO claim with factual
allegations.
D&T Partners LLC v. Baymark Partners LP
Extract
All four subsections of § 1962 have three common elements: '1) a person
who engages in 2) a pattern of racketeering activity, 3) connected to the
acquisition, establishment, conduct, or control of an enterprise.' Crowe, 43
F.3d at 204 (emphasis omitted). The statute broadly defines 'person' to
include 'any individual or entity capable of holding a legal or beneficial
interest in property.' 18 U.S.C. § 1961(3); Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S.
938, 944 (2009) ('The term ‘any’ ensures that the definition has a wide
reach ....'). 'To establish th[e] pattern [element], a plaintiff must show both a
relationship between the predicate offenses. .. and the threat of continuing
activity.' Malvino v. Delluniversita, 840 F.3d 223, 231 (5th Cir. 2016). '[A]n
enterprise. .. ‘is proved by evidence of an ongoing organization, formal or

informal, and by evidence that the various associates function as a
continuing unit.' Boyle, 556 U.S. at 945 (quoting United States v. Turkette,
452 U.S. 576, 583 (1981)).
Summary
Legal standards for pleading a RICO enterprise in the Fifth Circuit,
emphasizing the need to demonstrate a person engaged in a pattern of
racketeering activity connected to an enterprise. It highlights the
requirement for an enterprise to be an ongoing organization, either formal
or informal, with associates functioning as a continuing unit. This is crucial
for establishing the existence, structure, and membership of a RICO
enterprise.
Earl v. The Boeing Co.
Extract
A RICO person 'includes any individual or entity capable of holding a legal
or beneficial interest in property,' 18 U.S.C. § 1961(3), while a RICO
enterprise 'includes any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or
other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals associated in fact
although not a legal entity,' id. § 1961(4). 'Racketeering activity' means any
of the predicate acts specified in § 1961(1). Two or more of these predicate
acts form a 'pattern of racketeering activity' when they are '(1) related and
(2) amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity.' St. Germain v.
Howard, 556 F.3d 261, 263 (5th Cir. 2009); see 18 U.S.C § 1961(5).
Summary
Definitions of a RICO person and enterprise, as well as the requirements for
a pattern of racketeering activity. It specifies that a RICO enterprise can be
any group of individuals associated in fact, even if not a legal entity, and that
a pattern of racketeering activity requires at least two related predicate acts
that pose a threat of continued criminal activity. This is applicable to RICO
cases in the Fifth Circuit.
Midwest Feeders, Inc. v. Bank of Franklin
Extract
A conspiracy under Mississippi law is 'a combination of persons for the
purpose of accomplishing an unlawful purpose or a lawful purpose
unlawfully.' To establish a civil conspiracy a plaintiff must prove: '(1) an
agreement between two or more persons, (2) an unlawful purpose, (3) an
overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy, and (4) resulting damages to the
plaintiff.'

Extract
To sue for a violation of [section] 1962(c), a plaintiff must show that
someone both received income from a pattern of racketeering activity and
then used or invested such income in an enterprise. (310) Most courts hold
that a compensable injury must flow from the use or investment of the
income and cannot just flow from the predicate acts. (311)... The court also
held that the plaintiff was unable to show that the health insurance
companies had associated with an enterprise engaged in racketeering
activity and thus, found no violation of [section] 1962(c) or [section] 1962(d).
(362)
Summary
Necessity for a plaintiff to demonstrate that income from racketeering
activity was used or invested in an enterprise, and that a compensable injury
must result from this use or investment. It also highlights the requirement to
show association with an enterprise engaged in racketeering activity, which
is crucial for pleading a RICO enterprise.

Extract
To establish liability under 1962(c), a plaintiff must prove the existence of
two distinct entities: (i) a 'person,' and (ii) an 'enterprise' that is not simply
the same entity referred to by a different name. The enterprise must be
engaged in, or its activities must affect, interstate or foreign commerce. The
plaintiff must also demonstrate that the defendant's violation of [section]
1962 was the proximate cause of the plaintiff's injury to have standing for a
civil RICO action.
Summary
Clear explanation of the requirements for establishing a RICO enterprise,
emphasizing the need for distinct entities and the impact on interstate

Summary
For a RICO claim under § 1962(c), the plaintiff must prove the existence of
the defendant's association with the enterprise. This is a critical element, as
failure to establish this association results in the loss of the claim. The
passage suggests that the courts treat the question of "associating with" as
a factual matter, meaning that the plaintiff must provide factual allegations
that demonstrate this association.

The Brief - American Bar Association - 2024-01-01
Extract
A violation of § 1962(c), the section on which Sedima relies, requires (1)
conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity. The plaintiff must allege each of the elements to state a claim. They
are all equally essential components, and the complaint will fail if any one of
them is not adequately pleaded. In particular, RICO claims based on mail or
wire fraud must comport with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b)’s
requirement that allegations involving fraud be pleaded with particularity.
The practitioner through their pleadings must articulate with great care and
attention a viable racketeering claim. In addition, § 1962(a), (b), and (c) are
limited in scope to conduct involving enterprises engaged in or the activities
of which affect interstate commerce. It is the activities of the enterprise, not
each predicate act, that must affect interstate or foreign commerce. RICO
requires no more than a slight effect upon interstate commerce.
Summary
To plead a RICO claim under § 1962(c), a plaintiff must allege conduct of an
enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. Each element must be
adequately pleaded, and claims involving fraud must meet the particularity
requirement of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b). The enterprise's
activities must affect interstate commerce, but only a slight effect is
required. This guidance is applicable to RICO claims in the Fifth Circuit.

the defendant acted as part of an enterprise to further the act of hiding
assets to minimize divorce settlements; and (iii) there must be either
multiple violations of the same predicate act, or the commission of more
than one predicate act. (360)
Summary
The passage highlights the necessity for a plaintiff to demonstrate that the
defendant's RICO violation was the proximate cause of their injury. It also
outlines criteria for a successful RICO action in divorce cases, emphasizing
the need to show injury to business or property, the defendant's
participation in an enterprise, and multiple predicate acts. This aligns with

RICO CONSPIRACY The essence of a RICO conspiracy is the existence of an
agreement to violate RICO's substantive provisions. RICO conspiracy was
established by proof of: (a) of an agreement to join a racketeering scheme,
(b) of the defendant's knowing engagement in the scheme with the intent
that its overall goals be effectuated, and (c) that the scheme involved, or by
agreement between any members of the conspiracy was intended to involve,
two or more predicate acts of racketeering.
Summary
Elements necessary to establish a RICO conspiracy, which include an
agreement to join a racketeering scheme, knowing engagement in the
scheme with intent to achieve its goals, and involvement in or intent to
involve two or more predicate acts of racketeering. These elements are
crucial for pleading the existence, structure, and membership of a RICO
enterprise, as they demonstrate the coordinated and intentional nature of
the enterprise's activities.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
RICO, 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), prohibits 'any person employed by or associated
with any enterprise engaged in ... interstate or foreign commerce, to
conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such
enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.' The statute
thus requires the plaintiff to allege an enterprise, the conduct of the affairs
of the enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity, and injury to
[its] business or property ... caused by the violation of Section 1962.
Summary
Clear outline of the statutory requirements for a RICO claim under 18 U.S.C.
§ 1962(c). It specifies that a plaintiff must allege the existence of an
enterprise, the conduct of the enterprise's affairs through a pattern of
racketeering activity, and an injury to business or property caused by the
violation. This aligns with the general legal standards for pleading a RICO
enterprise, which require detailed factual allegations to support the
existence, structure, and membership of the enterprise.
RICO: A Primer
Extract
A plaintiff is required to demonstrate that the defendant conducted the
affairs of an enterprise though a pattern of racketeering activity. The person
and the enterprise generally must be distinct; but, of course, a Rico person
can be a part of an enterprise. A RICO enterprise includes 'any individual,
partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or
group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.' Courts
have interpreted 'enterprise' broadly, and the definition captures both
legitimate and illegitimate enterprises. The statutory list is not exhaustive
but merely illustrative.
Summary
A RICO enterprise can include a wide range of entities, both legitimate and
illegitimate. The definition is broad and not limited to formal legal entities,
allowing for a group of individuals associated in fact to qualify as an
enterprise. This broad interpretation means that factual allegations should
demonstrate how the defendants conducted the affairs of such an enterprise
through a pattern of racketeering activity, ensuring that the person and the
enterprise are distinct, although a RICO person can be part of the
enterprise.

Extract
RICO is not a simple statute. It pertains to conduct associated with an
'enterprise' and 'a pattern racketeering activity.' An enterprise is an
individual or legal entity, or a union or group of individuals associated in fact
although not a legal entity, while a pattern of racketeering activity requires
long-term, organized conduct to violate state and federal laws.
Summary
To plead a RICO enterprise, the plaintiff must demonstrate conduct
associated with an "enterprise" and a "pattern of racketeering activity." An
enterprise can be an individual, legal entity, or a group of individuals
associated in fact, even if not a legal entity. The pattern of racketeering
activity requires long-term, organized conduct that violates state and federal
laws. This provides a foundational understanding of what constitutes a RICO
enterprise and the necessary elements to establish it in a legal claim.
