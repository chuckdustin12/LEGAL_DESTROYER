Question
Morgan was in Texas, and Daniel was in Oklahoma, and their scheme
involved actions across state lines, including communications and the
preparation of documents intended for use in Texas courts. RICO applies to
activities that affect interstate or foreign commerce (18 U.S.C. § 1962). The
interstate nature of their actions (e.g., communications and document
preparation across state lines) establishes the required nexus to interstate
commerce under RICO.
Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
The interstate nature of Morgan and Daniel's scheme involving
communications and document preparation across state lines from Texas to
Oklahoma establishes the required nexus to interstate commerce under
RICO. Federal courts have consistently held that even a minimal effect on
interstate commerce is sufficient to satisfy RICO's jurisdictional
requirement.
Summary
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) contains a
jurisdictional element requiring that the enterprise or its activities affect
interstate or foreign commerce. Based on the provided materials, the
interstate communications and cross-state preparation of documents
between Morgan in Texas and Daniel in Oklahoma clearly satisfy this
jurisdictional requirement. This conclusion is supported by federal statute,
case law, and secondary materials that consistently establish that even a
minimal effect on interstate commerce is sufficient to meet RICO's interstate
commerce nexus.
The courts have adopted a low threshold for establishing the interstate
commerce connection, with multiple jurisdictions confirming that RICO
"requires no more than a slight effect upon interstate commerce." The
activities described in the scenario—communications across state lines and
preparation of documents in one state for use in another state's courts—go
beyond this minimal threshold. These activities establish a clear connection
to interstate commerce that brings the scheme within RICO's jurisdictional
scope under 18 U.S.C. § 1962.
Statutory Framework
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) explicitly
requires an interstate commerce nexus as a jurisdictional element for all
four of its criminal provisions. The primary statutory basis for RICO claims is
found in 18 U.S.C. § 1962, which states in relevant part:

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
"It shall be unlawful for any person through a pattern of racketeering
activity or through collection of an unlawful debt to acquire or maintain,
directly or indirectly, any interest in or control of any enterprise which is
engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign
commerce." 18 U.S.C. § 1962
This statutory language makes clear that RICO's application is limited to
enterprises that either engage in interstate commerce or whose activities
affect such commerce. This is a jurisdictional prerequisite for any RICO
claim.
Additionally, 18 U.S.C. § 3237 provides further context for how federal law
addresses crimes that cross state boundaries:
"Except as otherwise expressly provided by enactment of Congress, any
offense against the United States begun in one district and completed in
another, or committed in more than one district, may be inquired of and
prosecuted in any district in which such offense was begun, continued, or
completed. Any offense involving the use of the mails, transportation in
interstate or foreign commerce, or the importation of an object or person
into the United States is a continuing offense and, except as otherwise
expressly provided by enactment of Congress, may be inquired of and
prosecuted in any district from, through, or into which such commerce, mail
matter, or imported object or person moves." 18 U.S.C. § 3237
This provision reinforces the federal government's jurisdiction over offenses
that cross state boundaries, which aligns with RICO's focus on interstate
activities.
Judicial Interpretation of RICO's Interstate
Commerce Requirement
Minimal Effect Standard
Federal courts have consistently interpreted RICO's interstate commerce
requirement as having a low threshold. The Southern District of Texas
articulated this standard in Trevino v. Pechero:
"Because RICO is a federal statute, the racketeering must have at least a
minimal nexus with interstate commerce." Trevino v. Pechero, 592 F.Supp.2d
939 (S.D. Tex. 2008) (citing R.A.G.S. Couture, Inc. v. Hyatt, 774 F.2d 1350,
1353 (5th Cir.1985))
This "minimal nexus" standard defines the jurisdictional threshold for RICO
cases. Courts have repeatedly emphasized that the interstate commerce
requirement is not stringent. As noted in an administrative decision:
"Even a minimal effect on interstate commerce satisfies this jurisdictional
requirement." Santos v. Delta Airlines, Inc.

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
This interpretation of the interstate commerce requirement has been
reinforced by multiple circuit courts, creating a consistent judicial standard:
"Even a slight impact on interstate commerce suffices. See United States v.
Bagnariol, 665 F.2d 877, 892 (9th Cir. 1981) ('The effect on commerce is an
essential element of a RICO violation, but the required nexus need not be
great. A minimal effect on interstate commerce satisfies this jurisdictional
element.')" The resurrection of the 'single scheme' exclusion to RICO's
pattern requirement
Other courts have used similar language to describe this standard:
"RICO requires no more than a slight effect upon interstate commerce";
"minimal impact"; "even a minimal effect on interstate commerce satisfies
this jurisdictional element." Chapter 4. Elements of Cause of Action (citing
United States v. Doherty, 867 F.2d 47 (1st Cir. 1989); United States v.
Robinson, 763 F.2d 778 (6th Cir. 1985); United States v. Muskovsky, 863 F.2d
1319 (7th Cir. 1988), cert. denied, 489 U.S. 1067 (1989))
Focus on the Enterprise's Activities
Courts have clarified that the interstate commerce requirement focuses on
the enterprise itself or its activities, rather than on each predicate act:
"It is the activities of the enterprise, not each predicate act, that must affect
interstate or foreign commerce." Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy
This distinction is important when analyzing whether Morgan and Daniel's
scheme satisfies RICO's jurisdictional requirements. The overall pattern of
activities and their collective effect on interstate commerce, rather than
each individual action, determines whether RICO applies.
Elements of a RICO Claim
To establish a RICO violation under section 1962(c), one of the essential
elements is proving that:
"The enterprise engaged in, or its activities affected, interstate or foreign
commerce..." RICO: A Primer
This element appears consistently in cases discussing RICO violations. The
Southern District of Texas in Jones v. Enterprise Rent a Car Co. of Texas
outlined the RICO provisions:
"Plaintiff avers that Defendants violated RICO's four main criminal and civil
liability provisions, as set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 1962. First, Plaintiff alleges
that Defendants violated 18 U.S.C. § 1962(a), which makes it unlawful for
any person to use or invest income derived from a pattern of racketeering
activity towards the acquisition, establishment, or operation of an enterprise
engaged in or affecting interstate commerce." Jones v. Enterprise Rent a Car
Co. of Texas, 187 F.Supp.2d 670 (S.D. Tex. 2002)
The court continued:

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
"Second, Plaintiff claims that Defendants acquired or maintained an interest
in an enterprise engaged in or affecting interstate commerce through a
pattern of racketeering activity, as expressly prohibited by 18 U.S.C. §
1962(b). Third, Plaintiff argues that Defendants violated 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c)
by conducting the affairs of an enterprise engaged in or affecting interstate
commerce through a pattern of racketeering activity." Jones v. Enterprise
Rent a Car Co. of Texas, 187 F.Supp.2d 670 (S.D. Tex. 2002)
This case emphasizes that the interstate commerce nexus is a critical
element across all RICO liability provisions.
A more recent case from the Southern District of Texas, Peel v. cPaperless
LLC, provides further clarification on the elements required for a RICO
claim:
"To state a civil RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962, a plaintiff must allege
three common elements: (1) a person who engages in (2) a pattern of
racketeering activity, (3) connected to the acquisition, establishment,
conduct, or control of an enterprise." Peel v. cPaperless LLC, 4:23-CV-02417
(S.D. Tex. Nov 08, 2024)
Additionally, this case notes:
"An act of 'racketeering activity,' commonly referred to as a 'predicate act,'
is defined to include certain criminal acts, including mail and wire fraud." 
Peel v. cPaperless LLC, 4:23-CV-02417 (S.D. Tex. Nov 08, 2024)
This is particularly relevant to Morgan and Daniel's scheme, as their
interstate communications could potentially constitute mail or wire fraud,
which are recognized predicate acts under RICO.
Necessity of Interstate Commerce Connection
Courts have consistently emphasized that the interstate commerce
connection is an essential element of RICO claims:
"RICO, 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), prohibits 'any person employed by or associated
with any enterprise engaged in ... interstate or foreign commerce, to
conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such
enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.'" Santos v.
Delta Airlines, Inc.
Similarly, secondary sources have emphasized that without this connection,
RICO claims cannot proceed:
"Fifth, a RICO claim cannot exist without some nexus to interstate
commerce. If the alleged conduct does not affect interstate commerce, it
must be dismissed." Defending Civil RICO Claims: A Defense Plan Should Be

Application to Morgan and Daniel's Activities
Communications Across State Lines
Morgan and Daniel's communications between Texas and Oklahoma clearly
establish an interstate connection. When parties in different states
communicate to further a scheme, these communications inherently involve
interstate commerce. Under the "minimal nexus" standard established in 
Trevino v. Pechero, 592 F.Supp.2d 939 (S.D. Tex. 2008), these interstate
communications are sufficient to establish the required connection to
interstate commerce.
If these communications occurred via mail, telephone, or electronic means,
they could potentially constitute mail or wire fraud, which are recognized
predicate acts under RICO as noted in Peel v. cPaperless LLC, 4:23-
CV-02417 (S.D. Tex. Nov 08, 2024). This further strengthens the interstate
commerce connection, as these federal offenses inherently involve interstate
activity.
Document Preparation Across State Lines
The preparation of documents in Oklahoma for use in Texas courts also
demonstrates an interstate element. This activity involves the movement of
information and legal work product across state boundaries, which affects
interstate commerce. Even under the "minimal effect" standard articulated
in multiple sources, including Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy and Chapter 4.
Elements of Cause of Action, this cross-border document preparation
satisfies RICO's jurisdictional requirement.
The fact that these documents were intended for use in Texas courts while
being prepared in Oklahoma demonstrates that the enterprise's activities
spanned multiple states, which aligns with the interstate commerce
requirement of 18 U.S.C. § 1962.
Application of the Enterprise Standard
As noted in Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy, "It is the activities of the
enterprise, not each predicate act, that must affect interstate or foreign
commerce." In this case, the enterprise operated by Morgan and Daniel
clearly conducted activities that crossed state lines. Their collaborative
scheme involving parties in different states and actions that connected those
states demonstrates that the enterprise itself was engaged in or affecting
interstate commerce.
Under 18 U.S.C. § 3237, offenses that begin in one district and are
completed in another, or that involve interstate commerce, can be
prosecuted in any district where the offense occurred. This provision
supports the application of RICO to Morgan and Daniel's interstate scheme:
"Any offense involving the use of the mails, transportation in interstate or
foreign commerce, or the importation of an object or person into the United

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
States is a continuing offense and, except as otherwise expressly provided
by enactment of Congress, may be inquired of and prosecuted in any district
from, through, or into which such commerce, mail matter, or imported
object or person moves." 18 U.S.C. § 3237
Their activities across state lines create the type of continuing offense
addressed by this statute, further supporting RICO's applicability.
Pattern of Racketeering Activity
While not fully addressed in the original question, it's worth noting that
establishing a RICO violation also requires proving a "pattern of
racketeering activity." As explained in RICO: A Primer:
"There are four separate and distinct RICO violations set out in section
1962: (a) acquiring or operating an enterprise using racketeering proceeds;
(b) controlling an enterprise using racketeering activities; (c) conducting the
affairs of an enterprise using racketeering activities; and (d) conspiring to so
acquire, control, or conduct. Each of the subsections incorporates the basic
elements of 'enterprise' and a 'pattern of racketeering activity.'"
The interstate nature of Morgan and Daniel's scheme satisfies the interstate
commerce requirement for RICO jurisdiction, but a complete RICO case
would also need to establish that their activities constituted a pattern of
racketeering activity as defined by the statute.
Comparison to Established Legal Standards
Morgan and Daniel's activities can be analyzed in comparison to established
legal standards for RICO's interstate commerce requirement. The Southern
District of Texas in Cedra Pharmacy Houston, LLC v. UnitedHealth Grp.,
Inc., CIVIL ACTION NO. H-17-3800 (S.D. Tex. Mar 07, 2019) discussed 18
U.S.C. § 1962(a), which prohibits using income from racketeering activity in
"any enterprise which is engaged in, or the activities of which affect,
interstate or foreign commerce."
Multiple courts have emphasized that "even a minimal effect on interstate
commerce satisfies this jurisdictional element" The resurrection of the
'single scheme' exclusion to RICO's pattern requirement. Morgan and
Daniel's interstate communications and document preparation exceed this
minimal threshold.
The interstate nature of their scheme aligns with the RICO violations
outlined in Jones v. Enterprise Rent a Car Co. of Texas, 187 F.Supp.2d 670
(S.D. Tex. 2002), which included "conducting the affairs of an enterprise
engaged in or affecting interstate commerce through a pattern of
racketeering activity."

Extraterritorial Considerations
While not directly applicable to interstate activities, the principles
underlying RICO's application to foreign conduct provide additional context
for understanding its jurisdictional reach. As noted in CRIMINAL LAW -
NINTH CIRCUIT HOLDING HIGHLIGHTS CUMBERSOME APPLICATION
OF PRESUMPTION AGAINST EXTRATERRITORIALITY IN FEDERAL
STATUTES WITH STATE PREDICATES - UNITED STATES V. PEREZ:
"The second approach, 'the pattern of racketeering activity test,' held that
RICO had extraterritorial application when 'significant acts in the pattern of
racketeering activity took place in the United States....'"
This reinforces that RICO focuses on where significant acts occur. In Morgan
and Daniel's case, significant acts occurred in both Texas and Oklahoma,
establishing a clear interstate connection.
Conclusion
Based on the statutory language of 18 U.S.C. § 1962 and consistent judicial
interpretation, Morgan and Daniel's scheme involving communications and
document preparation across state lines clearly establishes the required
nexus to interstate commerce under RICO. Federal courts have consistently
held that even a minimal effect on interstate commerce satisfies RICO's
jurisdictional requirement, and the interstate nature of their activities
exceeds this threshold.
The fact that Morgan was in Texas while Daniel was in Oklahoma, and that
their scheme involved communications crossing state lines and the
preparation of documents in one state for use in courts of another state,
demonstrates an enterprise whose activities affected interstate commerce.
These activities satisfy the jurisdictional element required by RICO, making
the federal statute applicable to their scheme.
Under 18 U.S.C. § 3237, offenses that cross state boundaries can be
prosecuted in any district where they began, continued, or were completed.
This provision further supports the application of federal law, including
RICO, to Morgan and Daniel's interstate activities.
In summary, the interstate nature of Morgan and Daniel's actions establishes
the required nexus to interstate commerce under RICO, satisfying the
jurisdictional requirement necessary for the federal statute to apply to their
scheme.

Summary
The passage discusses how the defendants in the case were alleged to have
violated RICO provisions by engaging in activities that affected interstate
commerce. This is relevant to the proposition because it highlights the
requirement under RICO that the enterprise or activities must affect
interstate commerce. The case provides an example of how RICO can be
applied to activities that cross state lines, similar to the actions of Morgan
and Daniel.

18 U.S.C. § 1962(a) provides specifically, in pertinent part: It shall be
unlawful for any person who has received any income derived, directly or
indirectly, from a pattern of racketeering activity or through collection of an
unlawful debt in which such person has participated as a principal within
the meaning of section 2, Title 18, United States Code, to use or invest,
directly or indirectly, any part of such income, or the proceeds of such

interstate or foreign commerce.
Summary
Requirements under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(a) for a RICO violation, emphasizing
that the activities of the enterprise must affect interstate or foreign
commerce. This directly supports the proposition that Morgan and Daniel's
interstate actions could establish the necessary nexus to interstate
commerce under RICO, as their scheme involved actions across state lines.

Extract
To state a civil RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962, a plaintiff must allege
three common elements: (1) a person who engages in (2) a pattern of
racketeering activity, (3) connected to the acquisition, establishment,
conduct, or control of an enterprise. ... An act of 'racketeering activity,'
commonly referred to as a 'predicate act,' is defined to include certain
criminal acts, including mail and wire fraud.
Summary
Elements necessary to establish a civil RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962,
which includes engaging in a pattern of racketeering activity. The mention of
mail and wire fraud as predicate acts is particularly relevant because these
acts often involve interstate communications, which can establish the
required nexus to interstate commerce. This supports the proposition that
Morgan and Daniel's interstate actions, such as communications and
document preparation, could fall under RICO if they constitute a pattern of
racketeering activity.

Summary
The passage explains that for RICO to apply, the activities of an enterprise
must affect interstate or foreign commerce, but this effect need only be
minimal. The cited cases support the notion that even a slight or minimal
impact on interstate commerce is sufficient to satisfy RICO's jurisdictional
requirement. This aligns with the proposition that Morgan and Daniel's

RICO: A Primer
Extract
RICO Violations... Under section 1962(c), it is a violation to conduct the
affairs of an enterprise affecting interstate or foreign commerce 'through' a
pattern of racketeering activity or through the alternative theory of
collection of an unlawful debt. To prove a violation of Section 1962(c), a
plaintiff must prove the following elements:... The enterprise engaged in, or
its activities affected, interstate or foreign commerce;... Section 1962(d)...
To prove a violation of Section 1962(d), a plaintiff must prove the following
elements:... That the enterprise was (or would be) engaged in, or its
activities affected (or would affect), interstate or foreign commerce...
Summary
Requirements for proving a violation of RICO under sections 1962(c) and
1962(d), emphasizing the necessity for the enterprise's activities to affect
interstate or foreign commerce. This directly supports the proposition that
Morgan and Daniel's interstate actions, such as communications and

or through the alternative theory of collection of an unlawful debt.
Summary
RICO applies to activities that affect interstate or foreign commerce. The
passage specifically mentions that conducting the affairs of an enterprise
affecting interstate commerce through a pattern of racketeering activity is a
violation under Section 1962(c). This supports the proposition that the
interstate nature of Morgan and Daniel's actions, such as communications
and document preparation across state lines, establishes the required nexus
to interstate commerce under RICO.
