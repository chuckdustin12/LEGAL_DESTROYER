Question
Myers transferred $1,576 from a joint marital account to Branthoover’s
PayPal account, and used those funds to purchase a burner phone and
conceal the source and ownership of the funds. 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(B)(i)
criminalizes conducting a financial transaction with proceeds of specified
unlawful activity (such as wire fraud or theft) with the intent to conceal or
disguise the nature, location, source, ownership, or control of the proceeds.
The transfer and use of misappropriated marital funds to further conceal the
fraudulent scheme constitutes money laundering, another RICO predicate.
Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
The transfer of funds from a joint marital account to a PayPal account for the
purpose of purchasing a burner phone to conceal the source and ownership
of the funds can constitute money laundering under 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)
(B)(i) if the funds were proceeds of specified unlawful activity and the
transaction was conducted with the intent to conceal the nature, source, or
ownership of those proceeds. The key elements required for such a
transaction to qualify as money laundering are: (1) conducting a financial
transaction, (2) knowing the funds involved were proceeds of some form of
unlawful activity, (3) the funds were in fact proceeds of specified unlawful
activity, and (4) the transaction was designed to conceal or disguise the
nature, location, source, ownership, or control of the proceeds.
Summary
The transfer of $1,576 from a joint marital account to Branthoover's PayPal
account for the purchase of a burner phone can constitute money laundering
under 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(B)(i) if the requisite elements are satisfied.
Money laundering under this provision requires that a person knowingly
conduct a financial transaction involving proceeds of specified unlawful
activity with the intent to conceal or disguise the nature, location, source,
ownership, or control of those proceeds. In this case, the transfer of funds
through PayPal and subsequent purchase of a burner phone appears
designed to conceal the source and ownership of the funds, which is
precisely the type of conduct targeted by the statute.
For Myers' actions to constitute money laundering as a RICO predicate, the
government must prove that: (1) Myers conducted a financial transaction
(the transfer to PayPal and purchase of the burner phone); (2) the funds
involved were proceeds of specified unlawful activity (such as wire fraud or
theft); (3) Myers knew the funds were proceeds of some form of unlawful
activity; and (4) Myers knew the transaction was designed to conceal or
disguise the nature, location, source, ownership, or control of the proceeds.
Based on the established case law, Myers' actions of transferring funds to a

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
PayPal account and purchasing a burner phone with the intent to conceal
the source and ownership of misappropriated funds would satisfy the
elements of money laundering under 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(B)(i) if the funds
were indeed proceeds of specified unlawful activity.
Background and Relevant Law
Statutory Framework
The primary statutory authority at issue is 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(B)(i),
which prohibits money laundering. According to the 2025 version of this
statute:
"Whoever, knowing that the property involved in a financial transaction
represents the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity, conducts or
attempts to conduct such a financial transaction which in fact involves the
proceeds of specified unlawful activity- ... (B) knowing that the transaction is
designed in whole or in part- (i) to conceal or disguise the nature, the
location, the source, the ownership, or the control of the proceeds of
specified unlawful activity; ... shall be sentenced to a fine of not more than
$500,000 or twice the value of the property involved in the transaction,
whichever is greater, or imprisonment for not more than twenty years, or
both." 18 U.S.C. § 1956 (2025)
Elements of Money Laundering Under § 1956(a)(1)(B)(i)
Federal courts have consistently identified the key elements required to
establish a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(B)(i). For example, in United
States v. Joyner, 23-4126, 23-4139 (4th Cir. Dec. 30, 2024), the Fourth
Circuit outlined the elements as follows:
"In order to sustain a concealment money laundering conviction, the
Government must prove: (1) the defendant conducted or attempted to
conduct a financial transaction; (2) the transaction involved the proceeds of
specified unlawful activity; (3) the defendant knew the proceeds were from
'some form of unlawful activity'; and (4) the defendant knew a purpose of
the transaction was to conceal or disguise 'the nature, the location, the
source, the ownership, or the control' of the proceeds. 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)
(B)(i)."
Similarly, the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida in 
Absolute Activist Value Master Fund Ltd. v. Devine, Case No: 2:15-CV-328-
FtM-29DNF (M.D. Fla. Jul. 1, 2015) articulated the same four elements:
"A person is guilty of money laundering under 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(B)(i)
when: (1) the defendant conducted or attempted to conduct a financial
transaction; (2) the transaction involved the proceeds of a statutorily
specified unlawful activity; (3) the defendant knew the proceeds were from
some form of illegal activity; and (4) the defendant knew a purpose of the
transaction was to conceal or disguise the nature, location, source,
ownership, or control of the proceeds."

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
The Third Circuit in United States v. Bansal, 663 F.3d 634 (3rd Cir. 2011)
provided a similar explanation of the elements:
"A person is guilty of money laundering under § 1956 if he, (1) knowing that
the property involved in a financial transaction represents the proceeds of
some form of unlawful activity, (2) conducts or attempts to conduct such a
financial transaction involving the proceeds of unlawful activity, (3) with
either (a) the intent to promote the carrying on of specified unlawful
activity; or (b) knowing that the transaction is designed in whole or in part
(i) to conceal or disguise the nature, the location, the source, the ownership,
or the control of the proceeds of specified unlawful activity; or (ii) to avoid a
transaction reporting requirement under State or Federal law."
It should be noted that United States v. Bansal was cited in United States v.
Montague, 84 F.4th 533 (2nd Cir. 2023), which did not follow it. However,
the negative treatment relates to other aspects of the case and does not
affect the court's articulation of the elements of money laundering under §
1956.
Breadth and Purpose of the Money Laundering Statute
Courts have broadly interpreted the scope of § 1956(a)(1)(B)(i) to encompass
a wide range of financial transactions designed to conceal the nature,
location, source, ownership, or control of proceeds. In Cuellar v. United
States, 128 S.Ct. 1994, 553 U.S. 550 (2008), the Supreme Court emphasized
that:
"Congress used broad language that captures more than classic money
laundering: In addition to concealing or disguising the nature or source of
illegal funds, Congress also sought to reach transportation designed to
conceal or disguise the funds' location, ownership, or control."
Cuellar v. United States was cited in Jamieson v. United States, 692 F.3d 435
(6th Cir. 2012), which did not follow it. However, this negative treatment
does not undermine the Court's broad interpretation of the money
laundering statute's scope, as the disagreement was on a different aspect of
the case.
The Tenth Circuit in U.S. v. Lovett, 964 F.2d 1029 (10th Cir. 1992) further
clarified the breadth of the statute, stating:
"[T]he money laundering statute is not aimed solely at commercial
transactions intended to disguise the relationship of the item purchased with
the person providing the proceeds; the statute is aimed broadly at
transactions designed in whole or in part to conceal or disguise in any
manner the nature, location, source, ownership or control of the proceeds of
unlawful activity."
Intent to Conceal as a Key Element
Courts have consistently emphasized that the intent to conceal or disguise
the nature, location, source, ownership, or control of proceeds is a critical

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
element of the offense. In U.S. v. Garcia-Emanuel, 14 F.3d 1469 (10th Cir.
1994), the court explained:
"In speaking of transactions that are 'designed ... to conceal ... the nature,
the location, the source, the ownership or the control' of assets, 18 U.S.C.
Sec. 1956(a)(1)(B)(i), the statute is aimed at transactions that are engaged
in for the purpose of concealing assets. Merely engaging in a transaction
with money whose nature has been concealed through other means is not in
itself a crime. In other words, the government must prove that the specific
transactions in question were designed, at least in part, to launder money,
not that the transactions involved money that was previously laundered
through other means."
This emphasizes that the focus is on the purpose of the transaction itself -
whether it was designed to conceal the source or ownership of the proceeds.
Examples of Transactions Indicating Intent to Conceal
Courts have identified various types of transactions that can indicate an
intent to conceal the source or ownership of funds. In a secondary source
discussing "Money laundering" (2014-09-22), several examples were
provided:
"Examples of evidence of intent to disguise or conceal transaction, including
statements by defendant probative of intent to conceal, unusual secrecy
surrounding transaction, structuring transaction in way to avoid attention,
depositing illegal profits in bank account of legitimate business, using third
parties to conceal real owner, or engaging in unusual financial moves
cumulating in transaction."
Similarly, in United States v. Thomas (11th Cir. 2024-02-20), the court noted
that:
"Evidence that a defendant converted funds into a form that is more difficult
to trace, easier to hide, or less suspicious, such as exchanging cash for
jewelry, can support a violation of § 1956. Regardless of whether the source
of the transacted money was easily discoverable, 'the statute requires only
that proceeds be concealed, not that they be concealed well.'"
Specified Unlawful Activity
For conduct to constitute money laundering under § 1956(a)(1)(B)(i), the
funds involved must be proceeds of "specified unlawful activity." In U.S. v.
Hasson, 333 F.3d 1264 (11th Cir. 2003), the court noted:
"Mail and wire fraud constitute 'specified unlawful activity' under the
statutes. 18 U.S.C. § 1956(c)(7)(A) (incorporating RICO predicate offenses
listed in 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1))."
This concept was elaborated in United States v. Approximately Five Hundred
Forty-One Thousand Nine Hundred Fifty-Three Dollars & Zero Cents

($541,953.00) Seized from JP Morgan Chase, 23-CV-9585 (MKB) (PK) (E.D.
N.Y. Mar. 27, 2025), which stated:
"[W]hen the underlying crime is completed, a transaction conducted with
the proceeds from that crime may provide the basis for a money laundering
conviction' and 'funds become proceeds when they are derived from an
already completed offense, or a completed phase of an ongoing offense.'"
Analysis
Application to Myers' Transaction
Based on the provided facts and the legal framework outlined above, we can
analyze whether Myers' actions constitute money laundering under 18
U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(B)(i).
Element 1: Conducting a Financial Transaction
Myers transferred $1,576 from a joint marital account to Branthoover's
PayPal account, then used those funds to purchase a burner phone.
According to United States v. Approximately Five Hundred Forty-One
Thousand Nine Hundred Fifty-Three Dollars & Zero Cents ($541,953.00)
Seized from JP Morgan Chase (E.D. N.Y. 2025), "The required 'financial
transaction' can be a 'transfer' or 'delivery' of cash." The transfer of funds to
a PayPal account clearly constitutes a financial transaction under the
statute.
Element 2: The Funds Were Proceeds of Specified Unlawful Activity
For Myers' actions to constitute money laundering, the funds transferred
must be proceeds of specified unlawful activity. Based on the information
provided, the funds were "misappropriated marital funds" used "to further
conceal the fraudulent scheme." If these funds were proceeds of wire fraud
or theft, as suggested in the proposition, they would qualify as proceeds of
specified unlawful activity under § 1956. As noted in U.S. v. Hasson (11th
Cir. 2003), "Mail and wire fraud constitute 'specified unlawful activity' under
the statutes."
Element 3: Knowledge That the Funds Were Proceeds of Unlawful
Activity
Myers must have known that the funds were proceeds of some form of
unlawful activity. If Myers misappropriated the funds from a joint marital
account as part of a fraudulent scheme, it is reasonable to infer that Myers
knew the funds were derived from unlawful activity.

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Element 4: Intent to Conceal the Nature, Location, Source,
Ownership, or Control of the Proceeds
The facts state that Myers used the funds "to purchase a burner phone and
conceal the source and ownership of the funds." This directly speaks to the
intent element required by § 1956(a)(1)(B)(i). The use of a PayPal account as
an intermediary and the purchase of a burner phone (which is inherently
designed for anonymity) are actions that courts have recognized as
indicating an intent to conceal.
In United States v. Myers, No. 1:14-cr-172 (W.D. Mich. Jul. 15, 2021), the
court addressed a similar situation:
"[A]cts designed in whole or in part to conceal or disguise the nature,
location, source, ownership, or control of the proceeds. It is a reasonable
conclusion that Myers' use of a fake name and fake identification to
withdraw untraceable cash was, in fact, money laundering, and Myers'
disagreement with the jury's logical conclusion does not render the evidence
insufficient."
While the facts in the cited case involve a different Myers, the reasoning is
applicable: actions taken to make funds less traceable, such as using a
PayPal account as an intermediary and purchasing a burner phone, can
indicate an intent to conceal the source or ownership of the funds.
Similarly, in United States v. Thomas (11th Cir. 2024-02-20), the court noted
that "[e]vidence that a defendant converted funds into a form that is more
difficult to trace, easier to hide, or less suspicious... can support a violation
of § 1956." The purchase of a burner phone with misappropriated funds
could be viewed as converting the funds into a form that is more difficult to
trace.
Commingling of Funds
One potential issue is that the funds came from a joint marital account. In 
U.S. v. Phythian, 529 F.3d 807 (8th Cir. 2008), the court observed:
"Where a defendant commingles 'illegal proceeds with the identity or the
funds of a legitimate and usually preexisting business .... [s]uch
commingling effectively conceals the nature, source, ownership, and/or
control of the unlawful proceeds.'"
If the joint marital account contained both legitimate and illegitimate funds,
the act of transferring funds from this account to a PayPal account could
itself be seen as an attempt to conceal the source of the funds.
Comparison to Other Money Laundering Cases
The facts in this case bear similarities to other money laundering cases. For
instance, in United States v. Amaya, No. CR 11-4065-MWB (N.D. Iowa Aug.
10, 2012), the court found:

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
"[T]here is sufficient evidence to support the jury's finding that Javier knew
the purpose of his agreement was to participate in a transaction to conceal
the true source and ownership of the funds involved."
In that case, the defendant participated in financial transactions that served
no legitimate purpose, which was enough to suggest an improper agreement
designed to conceal the true source and ownership of the funds.
Similarly, in United States v. Williams, 605 F.3d 556 (8th Cir. 2010), the
court addressed a charge under § 1956(a)(1)(B)(i) where the defendant
conducted financial transactions knowing that they were designed to
conceal or disguise the nature, location, source, ownership, or control of the
proceeds of specified unlawful activity.
Money Laundering as a RICO Predicate
The proposition states that the transfer and use of misappropriated marital
funds to further conceal the fraudulent scheme constitutes money
laundering, "another RICO predicate." This is accurate, as money laundering
under § 1956 is listed as a predicate offense under the Racketeer Influenced
and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). As noted in U.S. v. Hasson (11th Cir.
2003), money laundering violations under § 1956 are incorporated as RICO
predicate offenses.
Exceptions and Caveats
The Funds Must Be Proceeds of Specified Unlawful Activity
A key requirement for a transaction to constitute money laundering is that
the funds involved must be proceeds of specified unlawful activity. As
explained in United States v. Joyner (4th Cir. 2024), the government must
prove that "the transaction involved the proceeds of specified unlawful
activity." If the funds in the joint marital account were not derived from
unlawful activity as defined in the statute, the transaction would not qualify
as money laundering.
Intent to Conceal Must Be Proven
The intent to conceal the nature, location, source, ownership, or control of
the proceeds is a critical element that must be proven. As stated in U.S. v.
Garcia-Emanuel (10th Cir. 1994):
"[T]he government must prove that the specific transactions in question
were designed, at least in part, to launder money, not that the transactions
involved money that was previously laundered through other means."
If Myers can demonstrate that the transfer to the PayPal account and the
purchase of the burner phone were not designed to conceal the nature,
source, or ownership of the funds, but rather were for some legitimate
purpose, the transaction might not qualify as money laundering.

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
The Level of Concealment
Courts have indicated that the statute does not require sophisticated or
effective concealment, only that there was an intent to conceal. In United
States v. Thomas (11th Cir. 2024-02-20), the court noted:
"Regardless of whether the source of the transacted money was easily
discoverable, 'the statute requires only that proceeds be concealed, not that
they be concealed well.'"
This suggests that even if Myers' efforts to conceal the source and
ownership of the funds were not particularly sophisticated or effective, they
could still constitute money laundering if the other elements are met.
Conclusion
Based on the legal framework outlined above, Myers' actions of transferring
$1,576 from a joint marital account to Branthoover's PayPal account and
using those funds to purchase a burner phone with the intent to conceal the
source and ownership of the funds could constitute money laundering under 
18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(B)(i) if certain conditions are met.
Specifically, the government would need to prove that:
Myers conducted a financial transaction (the transfer to PayPal and
purchase of a burner phone);
The funds involved were proceeds of specified unlawful activity (such
as wire fraud or theft);
Myers knew the funds were proceeds of some form of unlawful activity;
and
Myers knew the transaction was designed to conceal or disguise the
nature, location, source, ownership, or control of the proceeds.
The facts presented suggest that Myers' actions satisfy these elements,
particularly given that the purpose of the transaction was explicitly to
"conceal the source and ownership of the funds." The use of a PayPal
account as an intermediary and the purchase of a burner phone, which is
inherently designed for anonymity, further support the inference that the
transaction was designed to conceal.
This analysis aligns with numerous court decisions interpreting § 1956(a)(1)
(B)(i), which have consistently held that transactions designed to make
funds less traceable or to disguise their source or ownership can constitute
money laundering. If all the elements are satisfied, then Myers' actions
would indeed constitute money laundering, which is a predicate offense
under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).

U.S. Court of Appeals — Eleventh Circuit
Extract
Hasson was convicted of conspiring to promote specified unlawful activity
using proceeds derived from unlawful activity and conspiring to conceal
proceeds derived from specified unlawful activity in violation of § 1956(a)(1)
(A)(i) and (a)(1)(B)(i)... Mail and wire fraud constitute 'specified unlawful
activity' under the statutes. 18 U.S.C. § 1956(c)(7)(A) (incorporating RICO
predicate offenses listed in 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1)).
Summary
The passage from "U.S. v. Hasson" illustrates that under 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)
(1)(B)(i), it is a crime to conduct a financial transaction with proceeds from
specified unlawful activities, such as wire fraud, with the intent to conceal
the nature, location, source, ownership, or control of those proceeds. The
case demonstrates that using funds derived from unlawful activities to
conceal their origin or ownership can constitute money laundering. This
directly supports the proposition that Myers' actions of transferring funds to
conceal their source and ownership could be considered money laundering
under the same statute.
United States v. Williams, 605 F.3d 556 (8th Cir. 2010)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Eighth Circuit
Extract
The government charged Williams under 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(B)(i). That
statutory section covers [w]hoever, knowing that the property involved in a
financial transaction represents the proceeds of some form of unlawful
activity, conducts or attempts to conduct such a financial transaction which
in fact involves the proceeds ... knowing that the transaction is designed in
whole or in part ... to conceal or disguise the nature, the location, the
source, the ownership, or the control of the proceeds of specified unlawful
activity.
Summary
Statutory language of 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(B)(i), which criminalizes
financial transactions involving proceeds of unlawful activity with the intent
to conceal or disguise the nature, location, source, ownership, or control of
those proceeds. The case of Williams provides an example of how
structuring transactions to avoid detection can be evidence of intent to
conceal, which is relevant to the proposition that Myers's actions constituted
money laundering. The use of a fictitious name or other means to disguise
the source or ownership of funds aligns with the statutory requirement of
intent to conceal.

United States v. Myers, 854 F.3d 341 (6th Cir. 2017)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Sixth Circuit
Extract
The charged crime here is concealment money laundering, in which
someone, 'knowing that the property involved in a financial transaction
represents the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity, conducts ... such
a financial transaction ... to conceal or disguise the nature, the location, the
source, the ownership, or the control of the proceeds of specified unlawful
activity.' 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1). The ultimate criminal act that is prohibited
is 'conduct[ing]' a financial transaction involving 'the proceeds of some form
of unlawful activity' to conceal the proceeds' illegal source.
Summary
The passage explains the elements of concealment money laundering, which
involves conducting a financial transaction with the proceeds of unlawful
activity with the intent to conceal the source or ownership of those
proceeds. This directly relates to the proposition, as Myers's actions of
transferring funds to a PayPal account and purchasing a burner phone could
be seen as an attempt to conceal the source and ownership of
misappropriated funds, thus constituting money laundering.
United States v. Myers, No. 1:14-cr-172 (W.D. Mich. Jul 15, 2021)
U.S. District Court — Western District of Michigan
Extract
Relatedly, Myers argues that there was insufficient evidence of money
laundering because he claims he did not intend to disguise the funds he
withdrew. He claims that when he withdrew the funds (using a false name
and fake identification), he did not intend to conceal the source of the funds,
but rather, just to 'divvy up' and spend the cash. Again, this represents a
fundamental misunderstanding of what money laundering is: acts designed
in whole or in part to conceal or disguise the nature, location, source,
ownership, or control of the proceeds. It is a reasonable conclusion that
Myers' use of a fake name and fake identification to withdraw untraceable
cash was, in fact, money laundering, and Myers' disagreement with the
jury's logical conclusion does not render the evidence insufficient. What
Myers did with the cash after he withdrew it is irrelevant; the jury was
instructed that the Government only needed to prove that the withdrawals
themselves were designed to conceal.

=== PAGE 11 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
The court found Myers' actions of using a false name and fake identification
to withdraw funds as indicative of money laundering. This aligns with the
proposition that transferring funds to conceal their source or ownership
constitutes money laundering. The court emphasized that the intent to
conceal is a key element, and the use of deceptive means to handle the
funds supports the charge of money laundering.
U.S. v. Seher, 562 F.3d 1344 (11th Cir. 2009)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Eleventh Circuit
Extract
Count One alleged that Seher conducted a financial transaction with two
disjunctive intents—'to conceal and/or disguise the nature, location, source,
ownership and control of the proceeds of the said unlawful activity and/or to
avoid transaction reporting requirements under federal law'—with the
unlawful activity in question being the distribution of cocaine... The unlawful
activity in question was the distribution of cocaine, which is a felony under
21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1). Count One discussed three disjunctive intents for the
money laundering: promoting the carrying on of cocaine distribution, in
violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(A)(i); concealing or disguising the nature
of proceeds from that distribution, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(B)(i);
and avoiding a federal transaction reporting requirement, in violation of 18
U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(B)(ii).
Summary
The court in "U.S. v. Seher" addressed the application of 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)
(1)(B)(i) in a case involving money laundering. The court discussed the
necessary intents for a money laundering offense, which include the intent
to conceal or disguise the nature, location, source, ownership, or control of
proceeds from unlawful activity. This is directly relevant to the proposition,
as it involves the use of misappropriated funds to conceal the fraudulent
scheme, which aligns with the intent to conceal or disguise the source and
ownership of the funds.

the property involved in a financial transaction represents the proceeds of
some form of unlawful activity, (2) conducts or attempts to conduct such a

=== PAGE 12 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
financial transaction involving the proceeds of unlawful activity, (3) with
either (a) the intent to promote the carrying on of specified unlawful

(i) to conceal or disguise the nature, the location, the source, the ownership,
or the control of the proceeds of specified unlawful activity; or (ii) to avoid a
transaction reporting requirement under State or Federal law. See § 1956(a)
(1).
Summary
Elements required for a conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 1956, which includes
conducting a financial transaction with the intent to conceal or disguise the
nature, location, source, ownership, or control of the proceeds of specified
unlawful activity. This directly supports the proposition that Myers' actions
could constitute money laundering if the funds transferred were proceeds of
unlawful activity and the transaction was intended to conceal their source or
ownership.

FtM-29DNF (M.D. Fla. Jul 01, 2015)
U.S. District Court — Middle District of Florida
Extract
A person is guilty of money laundering under 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(B)(i)
when: (1) the defendant conducted or attempted to conduct a financial
transaction; (2) the transaction involved the proceeds of a statutorily
specified unlawful activity; (3) the defendant knew the proceeds were from
some form of illegal activity; and (4) the defendant knew a purpose of the
transaction was to conceal or disguise the nature, location, source,
ownership, or control of the proceeds.
Summary
Clear legal framework that aligns with the proposition that Myers' actions
could constitute money laundering if the funds were misappropriated and
used to conceal a fraudulent scheme.
United States v. Amaya, No. CR 11-4065-MWB (N.D. Iowa Aug 10, 2012)
U.S. District Court — Northern District of Iowa
Extract
In Count 2, Angel Amaya, his brother Javier Amaya, and two other co-
defendants were charged with a money-laundering conspiracy offense,
alleging a conspiracy to conduct financial transactions involving the

=== PAGE 13 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
proceeds of unlawful drug activity, (a) with intent to promote the carrying on
of that unlawful activity, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(A)(i), (b) to
conceal and disguise the nature, location, source, ownership, and control of
the proceeds of that unlawful activity, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)
(B)(i)... The prosecution argues that the evidence at trial showed that Javier
joined in the agreement, because the evidence shows that, at the request of
his brother, Javier participated in two financial transactions—depositing
funds in an account in Iowa, then withdrawing those funds at a bank in
California—and that those transactions served no legitimate purpose, which
is enough to suggest the improper agreement. Furthermore, the prosecution
argues that there is sufficient evidence to support the jury's finding that
Javier knew the purpose of his agreement was to participate in a transaction
to conceal the true source and ownership of the funds involved.
Summary
The court found sufficient evidence to support a conviction for money
laundering under 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(B)(i) by demonstrating that the
defendants conducted financial transactions with the intent to conceal the
source and ownership of the funds. This is directly relevant to the
proposition, as it involves the use of financial transactions to disguise the
nature and ownership of funds, which is similar to the alleged actions of
Myers in transferring funds to conceal their source and ownership.
U.S. v. Garcia-Emanuel, 14 F.3d 1469 (10th Cir. 1994)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
In speaking of transactions that are 'designed ... to conceal ... the nature,
the location, the source, the ownership or the control' of assets, 18 U.S.C.
Sec. 1956(a)(1)(B)(i), the statute is aimed at transactions that are engaged
in for the purpose of concealing assets. Merely engaging in a transaction
with money whose nature has been concealed through other means is not in
itself a crime. In other words, the government must prove that the specific
transactions in question were designed, at least in part, to launder money,
not that the transactions involved money that was previously laundered
through other means.
Summary
The intent to conceal is a critical element of the offense. In the case of
Myers, the transfer of funds to a PayPal account and the purchase of a
burner phone could be seen as actions designed to conceal the source and
ownership of the funds, aligning with the statute's requirements.

2008 Daily Journal D.A.R. 7982 (2008)
U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
The federal money laundering statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1956, prohibits specified
transfers of money derived from unlawful activities. Subsection (a)(1) makes
it unlawful to engage in certain financial transactions... Congress used broad
language that captures more than classic money laundering: In addition to
concealing or disguising the nature or source of illegal funds, Congress also
sought to reach transportation designed to conceal or disguise the funds'
location, ownership, or control.
Summary
The passage from Cuellar v. United States clarifies that 18 U.S.C. § 1956 is
not limited to traditional money laundering activities that make funds
appear legitimate. Instead, it also covers actions intended to conceal or
disguise the nature, location, source, ownership, or control of illegal funds.
This broad interpretation supports the proposition that Myers' actions of
transferring funds to a PayPal account and using them to purchase a burner
phone, with the intent to conceal the source and ownership, could constitute
money laundering under the statute.
United States v. Thomas
U.S. Court of Appeals — Eleventh Circuit
Extract
Personal payments made with 'previously laundered proceeds' violate § 1956
when 'designed to conceal the nature or source of the money.' Evidence that
a defendant converted funds into a form that is more difficult to trace, easier
to hide, or less suspicious, such as exchanging cash for jewelry, can support
a violation of § 1956. Regardless of whether the source of the transacted
money was easily discoverable, 'the statute requires only that proceeds be
concealed, not that they be concealed well.'
Summary
The passage discusses how personal payments made with laundered
proceeds can violate § 1956 if they are designed to conceal the nature or
source of the money. It also highlights that converting funds into a form that
is more difficult to trace or less suspicious can support a violation of the
statute. This aligns with the proposition that Myers' actions of transferring
funds to a PayPal account and purchasing a burner phone were intended to

conceal the source and ownership of the funds, thus constituting money
laundering.
U.S. v. Phythian, 529 F.3d 807 (8th Cir. 2008)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Eighth Circuit
Extract
Counts 7 through 9 of the indictment charged Phythian with knowingly
depositing checks payable to another person in violation of 18 U.S.C. §
1956(a)(1)(B)(i). There are four elements to this offense: (1) defendant
conducted, or attempted to conduct a financial transaction which in any way
or degree affected interstate commerce or foreign commerce; (2) the
financial transaction involved proceeds of illegal activity; (3) defendant knew
the property represented proceeds of some form of unlawful activity; and (4)
defendant conducted or attempted to conduct the financial transaction
knowing the transaction was 'designed in whole or in part [] to conceal or
disguise the nature, the location, the source, the ownership or the control of
the proceeds of specified unlawful activity.' ... Where a defendant
commingles 'illegal proceeds with the identity or the funds of a legitimate
and usually preexisting business .... [s]uch commingling effectively conceals
the nature, source, ownership, and/or control of the unlawful proceeds.'
Summary
Elements required to establish a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(B)(i),
which includes conducting a financial transaction with proceeds from illegal
activity with the intent to conceal the nature, source, or ownership of those
proceeds. The case of Phythian involved commingling illegal proceeds with
legitimate funds to conceal their origin, which is similar to the proposition
where Myers allegedly used misappropriated marital funds to conceal a
fraudulent scheme. This supports the argument that such actions can
constitute money laundering under the statute.
United States v. Joyner, 23-4126, 23-4139 (4th Cir. Dec 30, 2024)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fourth Circuit
Extract
In order to sustain a concealment money laundering conviction, the
Government must prove: (1) the defendant conducted a financial transaction
with the proceeds of specified unlawful activity; (2) the defendant knew that
the proceeds were from 'some form of unlawful activity'; and (3) the
defendant knew that the transaction was designed to conceal or disguise
'the nature, the location, the source, the ownership, or the control' of the
proceeds. 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(B)(i).

=== PAGE 16 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
Elements required to prove a concealment money laundering offense under
18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(B)(i). It specifies that the government must
demonstrate that the defendant conducted a financial transaction with
proceeds from unlawful activity, knew the proceeds were from some form of
unlawful activity, and knew the transaction was designed to conceal or
disguise the nature, location, source, ownership, or control of the proceeds.
This directly supports the proposition that Myers' actions could constitute
money laundering if the funds were misappropriated and used to conceal the
fraudulent scheme.

Morgan Chase, 23-CV-9585 (MKB) (PK) (E.D. N.Y. Mar 27, 2025)
U.S. District Court — Eastern District of New York
Extract
Section 1956(a)(1)(B)(i) requires that (1) 'there be proceeds from a specified
unlawful activity, known to be such by the defendant' and (2) 'the defendant
conduct or attempt to conduct a financial transaction with those proceeds,
knowing the transaction is designed to conceal or disguise the nature or
source of the funds.' ... '[W]hen the underlying crime is completed, a
transaction conducted with the proceeds from that crime may provide the
basis for a money laundering conviction' and 'funds become proceeds when
they are derived from an already completed offense, or a completed phase of
an ongoing offense.' ... 'The required ‘financial transaction’ can be a
‘transfer’ or ‘delivery’ of cash. . .'
Summary
18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(B)(i) criminalizes financial transactions conducted
with proceeds from specified unlawful activities with the intent to conceal or
disguise the nature or source of the funds. The passage explains that a
financial transaction, such as a transfer, can be considered money
laundering if it involves proceeds from a completed unlawful activity and is
intended to conceal the source or ownership of those funds. This directly
supports the proposition that Myers' actions could constitute money
laundering if the funds were misappropriated and used to conceal a
fraudulent scheme.
U.S. v. Lovett, 964 F.2d 1029 (10th Cir. 1992)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit

=== PAGE 17 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
We see no reason why the concealment requirement may not be met by
other affirmative acts related to the commercial transaction--acts designed
to quell the suspicions of third parties regarding the nature, location,
source, ownership or control of the proceeds of the defendant's unlawful
activity. In short, the money laundering statute is not aimed solely at
commercial transactions intended to disguise the relationship of the item
purchased with the person providing the proceeds; the statute is aimed
broadly at transactions designed in whole or in part to conceal or disguise in
any manner the nature, location, source, ownership or control of the
proceeds of unlawful activity.
Summary
The passage from U.S. v. Lovett clarifies that the money laundering statute
under 18 U.S.C. § 1956 is not limited to transactions that conceal the
identity of the participants but also includes any transactions designed to
conceal or disguise the nature, location, source, ownership, or control of the
proceeds of unlawful activity. This interpretation supports the proposition
that Myers' actions of transferring funds to a PayPal account and purchasing
a burner phone to conceal the source and ownership of the funds could
constitute money laundering, as these actions are designed to disguise the
nature and source of the funds.
U.S. v. Iacaboni, 221 F.Supp.2d 104 (D. Mass. 2002)
U.S. District Court — District of Massachusetts
Extract
The proper scope of money laundering by concealment is a much simpler
matter. Indeed, the language of the statute speaks for itself. As noted, a
person commits 'concealment' money laundering when he conducts a
financial transaction involving the proceeds of an unlawful activity 'knowing
that the transaction is designed in whole or in part to conceal or disguise the
nature, the location, the source, the ownership, or the control of the
proceeds of specified unlawful activity.' 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(B)(i).
Therefore, a person commits this version of money laundering each time he
engages in a financial transaction with the design of hiding the location or
source of the ill-gotten gains.
Summary
Any financial transaction intended to hide the source or ownership of illicit
funds can be considered money laundering. This directly supports the
proposition that Myers' actions of transferring funds to a PayPal account and
using them to purchase a burner phone to conceal the source and ownership
of the funds could constitute money laundering.

18 U.S.C. § 1956 18 U.S.C. § 1956 Laundering of Monetary Instruments
Extract
Whoever, knowing that the property involved in a financial transaction
represents the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity, conducts or
attempts to conduct such a financial transaction which in fact involves the
proceeds of specified unlawful activity- ... (B) knowing that the transaction is
designed in whole or in part- (i) to conceal or disguise the nature, the
location, the source, the ownership, or the control of the proceeds of
specified unlawful activity; ... shall be sentenced to a fine of not more than
$500,000 or twice the value of the property involved in the transaction,
whichever is greater, or imprisonment for not more than twenty years, or
both.
Summary
The passage from 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(B)(i) directly addresses the
criminalization of financial transactions conducted with the intent to conceal
or disguise the nature, location, source, ownership, or control of proceeds
derived from specified unlawful activities. In the proposition, Myers' actions
of transferring funds from a joint marital account to a PayPal account and
using those funds to purchase a burner phone to conceal the source and
ownership align with the elements of money laundering as described in the
statute. The statute's broad language encompasses transactions designed to
conceal the true nature of the funds, which supports the argument that
Myers' actions constitute money laundering.

The four alternative intent requirements under [sections] 1956 are: (1)
intent to promote the carrying on of specified unlawful activity; (2) intent to
engage in a violation of [sections] 7201 or [sections] 7206 of the Internal
Revenue Code; (3) intent to conceal or disguise the nature, location, source,

intent to avoid a reporting requirement under State or Federal law.(127)
Intent is a necessary element for a money laundering conviction,(128) and
the specific intent determines how to charge a suspect.(129) Sections
1956(a)(1)(B) and (a)(2)(B) require that the defendant take action knowing
that the transaction or transportation is designed to conceal information
about the proceeds of specified criminal activity, or knowing that it is
intended to avoid a transaction reporting requirement under state or federal
law.(133)
