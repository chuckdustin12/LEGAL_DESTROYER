Question
I. Introduction Within the last 23 days, four mandamus petitions have been
docketed involving the same parties but identify distinct legal errors made
by the trial courts below. In sum, the respondents include two Associate
Judges, a District Judge, and a Regional Presiding Judge currently presiding
over recusal proceedings. Each of the Respondents, the Real Party, her
counsel, and the Office of the Attorney General were duly notified of all
intentions to initiate these actions, the relief sought, and to date no input
has been provided. The legal errors identified are significant and
multifaceted: (1) an issuance of a void order by rendering a consent
judgment where consent was lacking and in excess statutory authority; (2) a
refusal to hear a properly filed emergency Temporary Restraining Order
(TRO); (3) a swift and improper consolidation of cases without a hearing;
and (4) a failure to adhere to Rule 18a regarding recusal proceedings. These
actions have not only violated procedural norms but have also exacerbated
the legal and personal hardships faced by the petitioner, and consolidation
would serve the interest of judicial efficiency in providing a more wholistic
view of these issues. 2 Amended Statement of Facts Relator, CHARLES
DUSTIN MYERS, is referred to herein as “Father.” Real Party in Interest,
MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS, is referred to herein at “Mother”. Each
record citation marked with (R. X-X) is referencing the concurrently filed
Amended Consolidated Mandamus Record. A. The Precipitating Event and
Background Facts The events giving rise to these proceedings began on
December 12, 2023, when the father discovered a series of text message
exchanges between the mother and two individuals outside the marriage—
identified in the record as Damen Kazlauskas and Debbie Price (R. 253–711).
This discovery occurred shortly after the mother’s abrupt announcement of
her intent to divorce and raised concerns regarding the children’s well-being
and emotional environment. In an effort to address the matter
constructively, the father contacted the mother’s grandfather— who resides
next door to the marital home—via text message to request a family meeting
to discuss the situation (R. 717–720). The following day, however, when
Father confronted Mother with the discovery—presenting his concerns in
the form of data visualizations (R. 255– 257)—she began distancing herself,
starting by redirecting the planned family conversation into a private
meeting solely between herself and her grandparents (R. 1716). On
December 14, 2023, Mother initiated text communication with her 3
stepfather, Dan Branthoover, who resides in Yukon, Oklahoma (R. 274–278).
Mr. Branthoover then contacted Father via text message, stating that he
wanted to help both parties and requested a phone conversation (R. 1703).
That conversation resulted in an arrangement for Mother to travel to Mr.
Branthoover’s residence over the weekend beginning December 15, 2023,
where Mr. Branthoover later acknowledged that he would be assisting with
the divorce paperwork (R. 1710). During this same period, Mother also
sought an ex parte emergency protective order against Father from the
322nd District Court of Tarrant County, as referenced in her divorce petition
(R. 78 at 9B). B. Travel,Influence and Conversion of Marital Assets While en
route to, or upon arrival at, Mr. Branthoover’s residence, Mother withdrew
the entirety of the funds from the joint marital bank account, totaling $1,576

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
(R. 723; 1716–1717). The transaction was facilitated by Mr. Branthoover,
who used his PayPal account—identified as “dmb575” (R. 1707)—as an
intermediary to transfer the funds. This identifier corresponds to the
relevant December 2023 bank statement (R. 1706). Both Mr. Branthoover
and Mother later admitted that the transaction had occurred (R. 1709,
1716). As a result, on December 16, 2023, Father was notified that the joint
account had been overdrawn, which caused the suspension of his business’s
advertising services due to a failed payment (R. 726–727). Father
subsequently contacted Mr. 4 Branthoover in writing to request the return of
the funds, explaining that the money was needed to cover essential family
expenses and to purchase Christmas presents for the children (R. 728–729).
During this exchange, Mr. Branthoover explicitly informed Father that
Mother’s visit was for the purpose of receiving assistance with the
preparation of divorce paperwork (R. 730). C. The Eviction The situation
escalated further on December 17, 2023, when Father was served with an
eviction notice by Mother’s grandmother, Margie Wilson. The notice cited a
protective order and a divorce petition as the basis for eviction, despite
those documents not having been formally filed at the time (R. 735). The
case was later heard by the Honorable Judge Swearingin Jr. and was
dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction (R. 736–737) on January 17,
2024. D. The Divorce Petition On December 18, 2023, Mother formally filed
for divorce (R. 71–81) and requested an “Uncontested Cases” form from the
court (R. 101). In her divorce petition, she claimed that the parties had
stopped living together as spouses on or around December 1, 2023 (R. 74 at
4). She also asserted financial indigence, stating that she had only $21 in
her bank account (R. 91) while being responsible for $1,610 in monthly
expenses (R. 92). Contradicting the timeline established by the eviction
notice served the previous day, the petition further alleged that an 5 active
protective order was already in place against Father, and that a finding of
family violence had been made during the marriage—thereby waiving the
statutory 60-day waiting period (R. 78 at 10). Mother further claimed that
the marital property would be divided by agreement yet designated both
family vehicles as her separate property (R. 79). She requested joint
managing conservatorship (R. 75 at 6D) and sought standard visitation
rights for Father (R. 76 at 6F), while simultaneously alleging that she and
the children could face abuse or serious harm if Father were provided with
her contact information (R. 81 at 15). E. The Protective Order Four days
after filing for divorce, on December 22, 2023, Mother filed an application
for a protective order (R. 103–109). In supporting documents, including an
affidavit (R. 108) and an unsworn declaration, she alleged that family
violence occurred on December 18, 2023—the same day she filed for divorce
(R. 109). However, evidence indicates that on that same day, Mother was
present at the family home with Father, exhibiting no signs of being in a
state of emergency (R. 1692). Mother continued to cohabit with Father
intermittently following these filings, as evidenced by her presence at the
family home on December 29, 2023, participating in a typical evening with
Father and the children (R. 1716). Father 6 was formally served with the
protective order suit on December 27, 2023 (R. 117- 118). Within the
protective order application, Mother requested that Father be prohibited
from approaching within 200 feet of the children’s school, that he cease all
communication with her, and that he complete a battering intervention and
prevention program (R. 105). She acknowledged the joint ownership of the

=== PAGE 3 ===

matrimonial residence but nonetheless requested spousal support, child
support, and Father’s immediate removal from the home (R. 106). Adding
another layer to the situation, the day after the divorce was filed—on
December 19, 2023—Mr. Branthoover contacted Father via text message,
claiming to represent Mother in the legal proceedings (R. 1712). Despite
these filings and allegations, Father continued to cohabit with Mother
leading up to the first scheduled legal proceeding: a show cause hearing set
for January 16, 2024. During this interim period, Father prioritized the
children and spent time with them during their holiday break (R. 826–829).
F.Father Prepares His Defense In response to the series of legal actions
initiated by Mother, Father waited until after the children’s Christmas
holiday to formally begin preparing his defense. He first filed an original
answer to the protective order application, denying all allegations of family
violence (R. 129–133). In his answer, Father raised the 7 affirmative
defenses of fraud, illegality, and duress, asserting that Mother was
attempting to misuse the legal process (R. 131). To support his position,
Father attached two exhibits: the first was a copy of his Texas Department of
Public Safety (TxDPS) record, demonstrating no history of violence (R. 134–
136); the second highlighted inconsistencies within Mother’s divorce
petition (R. 137–140). Subsequently, on January 3, 2024, Father filed a
motion to consolidate the protective order proceedings with the divorce case
(R. 142–145). He also submitted a background report intended to provide
the court with context regarding the children’s familial circumstances (R.
146–148). Father later filed a motion for continuance to obtain legal
representation (R. 149–151), accompanied by additional documentation
related to the family situation (R. 152–155), including text message evidence
from Mr. Branthoover intended to refute Mother’s claim of indigency (R.
161–164). Finally, on January 13, 2024, Father submitted an unsworn
declaration detailing the sequence of events leading up to that point (R.
175–179). G. Setting #1 – Show Cause The first court hearing was scheduled
for January 16, 2024 (R. 117-118). The parties appeared but announced they
were not ready to proceed (R. 180–181). Due to inclement weather
conditions, the Honorable James Munford presided over the matter
temporarily. Judge Munford granted a continuance but also ordered 8 Father
to vacate the family residence effective immediately—without conducting an
evidentiary hearing, making specific findings, or considering Father’s
submitted pleadings. This resulted in a de facto temporary termination of
Father’s custodial rights, and the case was reset for January 22, 2024, to be
heard by the Honorable Jeffrey Kaitcer (R. 182–185). Faced with the sudden
loss of his residence and access to his children, Father sought legal
representation immediately and retained attorney Daniel R. Bacalis on
January 19, 2024—just three days before the rescheduled hearing (R. 818 at
9). Father promptly briefed Mr. Bacalis on the situation, providing insights
into the family dynamics through a comprehensive statement of context (R.
168–174). H. Reset #1 – Show Cause On the rescheduled date of January 22,
2024, the parties appeared at the courthouse for the second setting. Mother
initially appeared without legal counsel but retained attorney Cooper L.
Carter in the courthouse lobby just prior to the hearing. This prompted a
further delay, as the Honorable Judge Kaitcer granted a continuance sua
sponte, resetting the case once more to February 1, 2024 (R. 185– 187). In
the period between settings, both Mr. Bacalis, representing Father, and Mr.
Carter, representing Mother, filed amended pleadings in the divorce

proceedings (R. 188-207, R. 208-219). 9 I. Reset #2 – Show Cause At the
third scheduled setting on February 1, 2024, both parties arrived with their
respective counsel and announced they were ready to proceed. 1 However,
instead of the matter being heard by Honorable Jeffrey Kaitcer, father’s
counsel, Mr. Bacalis, drafted an “Agreed Associate Judge’s Report” which
was presented to father in the hallway outside the courtroom. (R. 228-234).
This proposed agreement included terms to non-suit (dismiss) the protective
order application, grant father residency in the family home only until
March 1, 2024, and outline the division of financial responsibilities (R.
231-232). Father expressed significant reservations and initially refused to
sign the agreed order, stating his desire to proceed to trial to address
mother's allegations directly and hold her accountable, where he was told by
his counsel, “I know the judge, this is the best we can get,” and felt
pressured into signing the agreement as the only presented option, which is
corroborated by father’s witness in an affidavit (R. 1367-1369). Feeling
frustrated by this outcome, father paid particular attention to the procedural
requirements highlighted in bold text within the agreement signed on
February 1, 2024 (R. 233). The Father then realized that if he terminated his
attorney, he wouldn’t be able to prepare the written order and made the
decision to terminate his counsel and represent himself moving forward. 1
No recorded appearance from either party can be found in the record on
this date. 10 J. Father Proceeds Pro Se Shortly after the court setting, Father
terminated the services of his attorney, Dan Bacalis, and notified the court
(R. 220–222). An agreed motion for withdrawal of counsel was subsequently
filed (R. 223–227). On February 8, 2024, the associate judge’s report dated
February 1, 2024, was filed into the record (R. 228-234). Around the same
time, an agreed order of consolidation was entered—consolidating the
protective order suit with the divorce matter—without Father’s knowledge
or signature (R. 235–238). In response, Father prepared an Emergency
Motion to Vacate, which he filed the following day (R. 239–243). The motion
included a supporting brief summarizing the procedural history and
outlining what Father described as Mother’s unlawful campaign against him
(R. 244–252), and sought a de novo hearing on specific issues. The exhibits
accompanying the motion included text message evidence and data
visualizations involving Mother, Damen Kazlauskas, and Debbie Price,
originally discovered on December 12, 2023 (R. 253–714); text messages
between Father and Mother’s grandfather indicating the divorce was
unexpected (R. 715-720); evidence of marital asset conversion between
Mother and Daniel Branthoover (R. 721–723); documentation of the
overdrawn joint bank account and related communications from
Branthoover (R. 724–731); a copy of the eviction notice served by Margie
Wilson, which Mother later tore in half and marked “VOID” (R. 732-735); 11
and the judgment of dismissal in the eviction proceeding, entered on
January 17, 2024—the day after Father was removed from the residence (R.
736-737). A few days later, the court issued the order granting Attorney
Bacalis’s withdrawal (R. 738–741). Father then prepared and filed a Motion
for Partial Summary Judgment, accompanied by a supporting brief (R. 757–
767). He attached a Proposed Parenting Plan as Exhibit D to the motion (R.
768–772) and a proposed order (R. 773–774). No response was ever
provided to these pleadings by the opposing party. K. Events Preceding the
March 14 Hearing On February 22, 2024, the parties received notice that a
hearing on Father’s Emergency Motion was scheduled for March 14, 2024

signed by Hon. James Munford (R. 775-779). Father subsequently filed a
notice stating his intention to remain in the marital residence due to work
requirements and childcare responsibilities (R. 781–785). He then provided
initial disclosures to the parties (R. 786–792) and received no response to
his emergency motion. Two days later, while Father was taking the children
to school, Mother locked him out of the marital residence and left a sign on
the door declaring that “You should have been out by Saturday you are now
locked out.” (R. 1747–1748). To avoid unnecessary conflict, Father
temporarily stayed in Flower Mound, Texas, with his own father while
awaiting the hearing. 12 L. Setting #4 – Emergency Motion to Vacate and
Reconsider Evidence Father appeared for the scheduled hearing on his
Emergency Motion (R. 793).2 Upon entering the courtroom, he was handed
a document titled “Temporary Orders,” which was a modified version of the
February 1, 2024, agreement previously prepared by Father’s former
counsel (R. 887). These orders were prepared by Cooper L. Carter after the
20-day deadline stipulated in the original agreement. No agreement had
been reached, as evidenced by the parties’ presence in court to contest the
matter, and no motion to sign had been set or filed—contrary to the judge’s
prior directive (R. 233) and agreement of the parties. The proposed orders
also claimed that a hearing had been held on February 1, 2024, for
“Mother’s Motion for Temporary Orders,”3 and that all parties were in
agreement with the terms “as evidenced by the signatures below” (R. 888).
In reality, the February 1 setting resulted only in an associate judge’s report,
drafted informally in the hallway by Father’s prior counsel. Despite this, the
proposed order stated that the court “heard evidence and argument”—a
statement Father asserts was inaccurate (R. 888). At that time, the only
other scheduled hearing was on Mother’s Application for Protective Order,
which had been non-suited in the February 1 Associate Judge’s Report after
two delays. Once the hearing began, Father’s Emergency Motion was denied
without 2 No recorded appearance by the Real Party in Interest, Morgan
Michelle Myers, can be found in the record on this date. 3 This document
has never been served to the Relator. 13 explanation, and he was ordered to
sign the very agreement he had appeared in court to contest (R. 794-795).
Notably, the order itself contained two distinct sets of handwriting, was
prepared by the opposing counsel, and Father refused to sign the document
because he did not agree to its terms (R. 795). Notably, Father also refused
to sign the Temporary Orders claiming his consent (R. 925). No order was
ever issued regarding Father’s Emergency Motion to Vacate. Following the
setting, Father began exploring his appellate remedies and drafted a
Preparatory Notice for Judicial Review, which he later amended twice (R.
797–846). The document provided a detailed account of the parties’ family
background (R. 807), employment history, and household dynamics (R. 808–
815). It included a statement of facts segmented into background facts (R.
816–817), procedural facts (R. 817–821), and undisputed evidentiary facts
(R. 822–825). The pleading also contained video evidence of Father with the
children during the Mother’s initial campaign to have him removed from the
residence (R. 826-829). Appended to the filing were affidavits from Father’s
business clients attesting to his need to remain in the marital residence for
professional reasons pending the divorce (R. 850–852, R. 853–855, R. 856–
858, R. 859–861, R. 862–865, R. 866– 868, R. 869–872). The disputed
Temporary Orders that claimed consent were filed into the record by the
clerk on March 26, 2024. Father promptly responded by filing a formal

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Request for Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law regarding the 14
March 14 decision (R. 882–886).4 He then filed a notice of his intent to seek
mandamus relief by April 8, 2024 (R. 902–905). M. The Appellate
Proceedings In April 2024, Father prepared a Motion for Emergency Relief
directed to the Second Court of Appeals (R. 979–1007) and a Petition for
Writ of Mandamus (R. 931–978). The Petition was accepted by the appellate
court under cause number 02- 24-00149-CV on April 8, 2024, and the trial
court was notified of the filing that same day (R. 1009-1010). Two days later,
Father’s Motion for Emergency Relief and Petition for Writ of Mandamus
were denied per curiam (R. 1011–1012). Father then submitted a Motion for
Rehearing on April 18, 2024 (R. 1028–1044). Six days later, on April 24,
2024, Cooper L. Carter filed a Motion for Pre-Trial Conference (R. 1013–
1016), to which Father promptly objected (R. 1017–1023). The following day,
Father’s Motion for Rehearing was denied by the Second Court of Appeals
(R. 1045). Father moved for en banc reconsideration on April 26, 2024 (R.
1052–1066). On April 30, 2024, although Father continued to disagree with
the Temporary Orders and the hardship they imposed, he abided by the
court’s directives and filed a Notice of Completion regarding the court-
ordered parenting class, which both parties were required to complete by
May 1, 2024 (R. 1046–1050).5 The en banc reconsideration 4 No findings
were ever issued. 5 No notice of completion was ever filed by the Mother. 15
motion was denied the following day (R. 1067). Father then prepared a
second Petition for Writ of Mandamus before this Court, which was accepted
under cause number 24-0395. The trial court was notified of the filing by
postcard (R. 1068–1073). On May 9, 2024, Cooper L. Carter emailed Father
requesting his signature on an Income Withholding Order and claimed that
the orders were agreed (R. 1115). Father reviewed the proposed order,
determined that it was defective (R. 1117–1122), and communicated his
objections to Ms. Carter (R. 1116). N. Intervention From the Texas Attorney
General’s Office Subsequently, an intervention pleading was filed by the
Office of the Attorney General, seeking relief from the trial court regarding
child support obligations (R. 1098–1104). Father objected to this
intervention (R. 1105–1113). Notably, upon examining the pleading
purportedly filed by “Holly Hayes,” Father observed that the signature line
did not match the name of the listed attorney of record. Additionally, the font
sizes in the document appeared inconsistent, suggesting that the signature
may have been irregular (R. 1102). No further correspondence was filed by
the Attorney General’s Office in this matter. By July 2024, during Father’s
designated month for visitation under the disputed orders, he stayed in an
Airbnb near the marital home to maintain stability for the children and
worked with the host to attempt to establish a source of business revenue
(R. 1736–1746). 16 On August 30, 2024, this Court declined to hear Father’s
mandamus petition, and the trial court was notified (R. 1157–1162).
Immediately following the denial, Father prepared a Motion for Rehearing,
which he submitted and later amended in mid-September (R. 1135–1156).
The court was notified of the rehearing filing (R. 1163–1168). O. Challenge
to Opposing Counsel’s Authority Under Rule 12 After filing the Motion for
Rehearing with this Court, Father served discovery requests on the opposing
party, including Requests for Production of Documents (R. 1410–1411) and
Requests for Admissions (R. 1411–1415). In addition, Father filed a motion
under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 12, challenging Cooper L. Carter’s
authority to represent Mother in the trial court (R. 1169–1177). This

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
challenge was based on ambiguity surrounding Ms. Carter’s employment
status and the fact that her pleadings were being filed by Roderick D. Marx
—an individual who was not listed as counsel of record and not a party to
the case (R. 219, R. 1016). P.Declining Resources and Exhaustion of
Remedies Facing rapidly declining credit, reduced income (R. 1717–1718),
and limited housing options, Father filed an Emergency Motion for
Temporary Orders on September 24, 2024, requesting relief by October 1,
2024 (R. 1183–1195). When no relief was granted and no response was
received from the opposing party, Father 17 filed a motion seeking the joint
recusal of Judge James Munford and Associate Judge Jeff Kaitcer. The motion
asserted that the nature of Mother’s initial allegations had created an
appearance of bias that could undermine fairness in the proceedings (R.
1196–1220). Q. The First Recusal – Procedural Abnormalities Two days after
the recusal motion was filed, Judge James Munford declined to recuse
himself without explanation and referred the matter to the Honorable David
L. Evans, the 8th Administrative Regional Judge of Fort Worth (R. 1221–
1243). Upon reviewing this referral, Father observed that the version of the
motion submitted to Judge Evans differed significantly from the one he
originally filed. Father’s original filing was a single, 20.21 MB hyperlinked
PDF submitted via the re:SearchTX platform (R. 1253-1254). The version
transmitted to Judge Evans was missing exhibits and the supporting
affidavit. Father notified the court coordinator of the discrepancy and noted
that the file was approximately 18 MB smaller (R. 1254–1255). Receiving no
response, Father filed a formal notice with the court outlining these
procedural irregularities (R. 1245–1252). The following day, Judge Munford
issued an amended order of referral and again declined to recuse, without
explanation (R. 1281–1283). This time, the recusal motion was divided into
three separate files, with the court citing the "size of the motion" as
justification (R. 1356-1357). Father objected to the handling of the recusal
process (R. 1268–1280), noting that the Tarrant County District 18 Clerk’s
publicly available filing guidelines instruct litigants to compile all exhibits
into a single document (R. 1272 at 9). He also noted that his original 20.21
MB file was well within the platform’s approximately 30 MB capacity and
that fragmenting the submission contradicted the court’s standard
electronic filing protocol (R. 1271 at 6–7). R. The First Recusal – the
Appointment of Justice Lee Gabriel Activity paused until October 18, 2024,
when the parties received postcard notification that Father’s Supreme Court
Motion for Rehearing had been denied (R. 1292–1297). Three days later,
Judge David L. Evans issued an order setting a video conference regarding
the recusal motion for October 30, 2024 (R. 1298– 1301). On the day before
the conference, Judge Evans appointed retired Justice Lee Gabriel to preside
over the recusal matter (R. 1305–1308). During the scheduled video
conference, internet connectivity issues arose, and the hearing was
rescheduled to November 7, 2024, to be held in person at the 322nd District
Court. In anticipation of possible objections from opposing counsel—who
had not filed a response to the recusal motion—Father filed a PreTrial
Motion in Limine to prevent unnecessary interruptions during his
presentation and to reiterate key facts of the case (R. 1309-1315). Two days
later, Father submitted a Request for Confirmation of Procedural
Requirements, respectfully asking the district clerk to provide a certified
copy of 19 Justice Gabriel’s oath of office, in an effort to ensure procedural
transparency (R. 1319–1324). S. The First Recusal – Dental Emergency On

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
the morning of the rescheduled in-person hearing, November 7, 2024,
Father awoke experiencing significant dental distress, which he promptly
communicated to his father (R. 1391–1392), opposing counsel and the court
coordinator via email (R. 1394), and to Mother directly (R. 1395). Opposing
counsel agreed in writing to reschedule the hearing due to the emergency
(R. 1393). Nonetheless, four days later, on November 11, 2024, the court
coordinator disseminated via email an order signed by Justice Gabriel
denying Father’s recusal motion. The order specifically referenced Father’s
absence from the November 7 hearing but made no mention of the dental
emergency (R. 1397). In response, Father filed a Motion to Enter Judgment
on November 13, 2024, in which he articulated objections to the procedural
irregularities surrounding the recusal proceedings (R. 1325–1369). This
motion was supported by an affidavit elaborating upon those irregularities
(R. 1346–1349). Shortly thereafter, Father filed a Notice of Intent to Remove
the case to federal court, citing exhaustion of state judicial remedies and
setting forth jurisdictional grounds for removal to the U.S. District Court for
the Northern District of Texas (R. 1371–1397). 20 On November 18, 2024,
Father also submitted a Motion to Compel Discovery (R. 1398–1407)
pertaining to discovery requests initially served on Mother on September
17, 2024, attached as Exhibit A (R. 1408–1418). He requested that the court
deem the requested admissions conclusively established by operation of law
due to Mother’s failure to respond (R. 1405). The recusal proceedings
concluded when the court formally documented and served the order
denying Father’s recusal motion on November 19, 2024 (R. 1422– 1423). At
that point, the parties awaited formal confirmation of the termination of
Justice Lee Gabriel’s assignment, as such termination would not effectuate
“…until the undersigned Presiding Judge has terminated this assignment in
writing.” (R. 1306.) T. Federal Removal, Remand, and Initiation of
Proceedings Against Daniel Kenneth Branthoover Following the denial of the
recusal motion, Father spent the next two weeks compiling the necessary
record in preparation for federal removal. On December 2, 2024, he filed a
Notice of Removal with the state trial court (R. 1425–1444). Two days later,
however, the United States District Court remanded the matter back to state
court for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.6 On December 14, 2024, Dan
Branthoover sent Father a threatening text 6 The Petitioner has not fulfilled
her obligation under Tex. R. Civ. P. 237a by failing to serve a certified copy of
the Order of Remand. 21 message (R. 1719–1720). At that point, Father’s
financial losses had exceeded $75,000 (R. 1460–1462), prompting him to
initiate separate federal litigation against Daniel Branthoover in the U.S.
District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma. That action sought
damages arising from Mr. Branthoover’s involvement in the events
underlying this case, and was later amended (R. 1450–1464). Father
provided notice of the related federal case to the state trial court on
December 31, 2024 (R. 1445–1449). The federal complaint was filed
pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a) (R. 1428), and its statement of facts closely
mirrored those presented in the current matter (R. 1452–1455). U. Case
Abandonment The divorce case remained largely inactive until January 16,
2025, when Father submitted a comprehensive Case Memorandum and
served copies upon Judges James Munford and Jeff Kaitcer of the 322nd
Judicial District Court, Visiting Retired Justice Lee Gabriel, Regional Judge
David L. Evans, and opposing counsel Cooper L. Carter (R. 1465–1519). On
January 26, 2025, Father filed a Motion to Dismiss for Want of Prosecution,

=== PAGE 9 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
citing the lack of activity in the case by the opposing party and the Court’s
time standards for divorce proceedings (R. 1526–1533). On January 29,
2025, facing the imminent repossession of his primary vehicle, Father
returned to the matrimonial residence to retrieve his secondary vehicle.
Inside, he discovered numerous personal items that Mother had placed in 22
the vehicle. He temporarily relocated these items to the porch (R. 1628–
1629). Upon returning the next day to collect the children for his scheduled
possession, Father observed that Mother had moved the items from the
porch to the curb (R. 1630-1631). No further docket activity occurred until
February 25, 2025, when Father filed a Notice of Loss of Employment,
notifying the court of a significant reduction in income (R. 1520–1525). At
the same time, he submitted a Motion to Sign, requesting a ruling on his
long-pending Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, which had remained
unresolved since its original filing on February 22, 2024 (R. 1636–1656), and
which the court acknowledged during the March 14, 2024, hearing (R.
1369). Father also filed an Objection and Request for Judicial Notice,
recapping relevant procedural history and identifying pending matters
requiring rulings (R. 1660–1677). On February 28, 2025, Father filed a
Request for Ruling on his outstanding motions (R. 1678–1685). On March 5,
2025, he submitted a Notice of New Information, documenting Watauga
Police Department involvement regarding his personal property being
placed at the curb by Mother (R. 1686–1695). On March 12, 2025, Father
filed a Notice of Continued Obstruction, itemizing pending, unopposed
motions and emphasizing the ongoing lack of response from opposing
counsel (R. 1929–1942). He reinforced these concerns on March 14, 2025,
through 23 a Notice of Submission, restating the uncontested factual
background and the judicial inaction on multiple unresolved filings (R. 1943–
1955). By March 18, 2025, Father contacted the court coordinator via email,
highlighting that neither Judge Munford nor Judge Kaitcer had been
formally reinstated to preside over the case, despite Justice Gabriel’s denial
of recusal being entered nearly four months earlier (R. 1506-1507). In light
of the continued judicial inactivity, and being confident in his understanding
of dominant jurisdiction based on the extensive record, Father initiated a
new Original Suit Affecting the Parent- Child Relationship (SAPCR) in the
233rd District Court of Tarrant County, submitting a cover letter explaining
his need for immediate relief for himself and his minor children (R. 2259–
2277). V. The SAPCR Suit and the Sudden Reappearance of Counsel On
March 18, 2025, the 233rd District Court of Tarrant County accepted
Father’s original SAPCR petition (R. 2053–2064). Shortly thereafter, Mother
reappeared in the litigation after several months of inactivity and filed a
general denial in response to the SAPCR petition (R. 2278–2282). This
pleading was submitted on behalf of Cooper L. Carter by Roderick D. Marx
(R. 2282). Mr. Marx subsequently filed a motion to consolidate the SAPCR
matter back into the original divorce case in the 322nd District Court (R.
2283–2286), again purporting to act on Ms. Carter’s behalf (R. 2286). Father
moved to strike both the general denial and the motion to consolidate 24 (R.
1956–1965), and attached an exhibit showing that opposing counsel was
registered under a different law firm than what appeared on her pleadings.
(R. 1962–1963). Father also filed a second Rule 12 Motion challenging
Cooper L. Carter’s authority to represent Mother in the 233rd District
Court, citing Ms. Carter’s continued failure to formally appear and the
repeated filings by Mr. Marx in her name (R. 2287–2300). As of the date of

=== PAGE 10 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
this filing, no response has been submitted to any of these pleadings by Ms.
Carter. W. The Emergency TRO On March 24, 2025, Father filed an
Objection to Consolidation in the second-filed case (R. 1880–1888) and an
Emergency Motion for Temporary Restraining Order (TRO), seeking to
prevent Mother from restricting his access to the family residence and to
safeguard the children (R. 2301–2326). The TRO incorporated the same
statement of facts that remains unopposed in multiple pleadings (R. 2304–
2312). Father then coordinated with court staff to schedule the presentation
of his emergency motion and documented all communications (R. 2333–
2365) regarding these interactions. In those communications, Father first
inquired about the status of his request and informed the court that the
opposing party had been notified of the substance of the relief sought (R.
2338). The clerk advised that in-person presentation was required, and
Father requested to appear between 9 a.m. and 2 p.m. on March 28, 2025,
again confirming that the opposing party had been served (R. 2339). Father
25 delivered the intended materials to opposing counsel in advance of that
presentation (R. 2351), and the clerk confirmed the scheduled time (R. 2339-
2340). On March 28, 2025, Father appeared before the court coordinator,
who assisted in securing opposing counsel’s agreement to set the TRO
hearing for April 10, 2025, from the available dates provided (R. 2358). The
coordinator initialed the scheduling notice to reflect that agreement (R.
2360-2361). Father then proceeded to present the motion to the Honorable
Kate Stone, who summarily declined to even hear it based solely on a
prospective objection communicated by Mother’s counsel—who was not
even present in court (R. 2352). Even the coordinator acknowledged that the
motion could have been heard on the spot, and noted that it could have been
transferred after the emergency was addressed (R. 2356). Instead, the
Associate Judge declined entirely to entertain the motion, ultimately
triggering cause number 25-0367, now pending before this Honorable
Court. On April 1, 2025, Father filed a Pre-Objection in the 322nd court
addressing opposing counsel’s anticipated motion to consolidate (R. 1889–
1915). He also submitted a Respondent’s Statement in the 322nd District
Court (R. 1916–1919) and a separate Petitioner’s Statement in the 233rd
District Court (R. 1920–1928). Father then filed a Petitioner’s Notice in the
233rd, presenting a side-by-side analysis of the children’s best interests and
relevant procedural considerations (R. 1995–2004). 26 On April 3, 2025,
Roderick Marx filed the Motion to Consolidate on behalf of Mother’s counsel
that had been used to block the emergency hearing in the 322nd District
Court, which failed to acknowledge Father’s prior objection (R. 2366–2369).
In response, Father filed a Pre-Objection to Transfer in the 233rd District
Court (R. 2084–2087) realizing that the case would need to be transferred at
some point along with a Notice of New Information advising the court that
Mother was now engaged to Damen Kazlauskas—the individual with whom
she exchanged extensive messages at the outset of this case (R. 2019–2024).
Father also submitted a Comprehensive Legal Analysis in Support of
Dismissal in the 322nd District Court, setting forth grounds to dismiss the
original divorce matter so that the SAPCR could proceed independently (R.
1975–1994). X. The Dragon in Triplicate A few days later, Father filed a
Notice of Intent to File Mandamus in the 233rd District Court (R. 2065–
2083) and a Notice of Intent to File Prohibition in the 322nd District Court
(R. 2005–2018). On April 10, 2025, Father filed an Emergency Motion for
Declaratory Relief (R. 1775–1786) and a Petition for Writ of Mandamus in

=== PAGE 11 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
the Second Court of Appeals, naming the Honorable Kate Stone as
Respondent under cause number 02-25-00164-CV (“the SAPCR Mandamus”)
(R. 2025–2052). Directly after this mandamus was submitted to the Second
Court of Appeals, District Judge Kenneth Newell from the 233rd District
Court sua sponte granted Mother’s Motion to Consolidate in the 233rd
District Court and then filed it 27 with the 322nd District Court. (R.
2392-2395). The following day, the first-filed petition (“the SAPCR
mandamus”) was denied per curiam in the Second Court of Appeals. On
April 15, 2025, Father filed a Dominant Jurisdiction Analysis in the 322nd
District Court (R. 2088–2100), along with a second memorandum titled
Procedural Irregularities with Temporary Orders realizing that he was
dealing with three potential abuses of discretion from three separate judges
(R. 2172– 2202). That same day, Father filed a second Petition for Writ of
Mandamus in the Second Court of Appeals, this time naming the Honorable
Jeff Kaitcer as Respondent under cause number 02-25-00166-CV (“the Void
Order Mandamus”) (R. 2396–2447) and filed an Emergency Motion for Stay
to halt the proceedings given the extraordinary circumstances of this matter.
(R. 2106–2123). See No. 02- 25-00166-CV The following day, Father filed a
third Petition for Writ of Mandamus, naming the Honorable Kenneth Newell
as Respondent under cause number 02-25- 00171-CV (“the Consolidation
Mandamus”) for his arbitrary grant of Mother’s contested motion without a
hearing (R. 2223–2253). On the same day, Father’s second mandamus
petition was denied per curiam. By April 17, 2025, all three mandamus
petitions had been denied per curiam, and Father moved for reconsideration
en banc in all three matters (R. 2448–2467; R. 2203–2217; R. 2155–2171),
thus giving birth to the “Dragon in Triplicate” – three separate judges 28
implicated in three distinct abuses of discretion within the same family law
matter. Y. The Sudden Move to Final Trial On April 23, 2025, with all three
mandamus petitions pending, Father received a Notice of Court Proceeding
scheduling a conference for April 29, 2025, purposed for setting the matter
for final trial (R. 1772–1772). That same day, Father filed a formal objection
to the setting (R. 2218–2222). The following day, Father’s first filed en banc
motion for reconsideration (the “Void Order” mandamus) was denied per
curiam by the appellate court. To address the unresolved issues regarding
subject-matter jurisdiction over these orders, Father filed a Plea to the
Jurisdiction asking the Honorable James Munford to clarify the legal basis
for the current orders (R. 2468–2479). In a further effort to protect his
procedural rights, Father filed a Second Motion to Recuse Judge Munford on
April 25, 2025 (R. 1787–1859). Later that same day, Mother notified Father
that the emergency circumstance which had formed the original basis for
Father’s urgent push for the Emergency TRO petition had now materialized
(R. 1766–1771). With this new development, Father filed a Notice of Non-
Appearance and Objection to Trial Setting (R. 2480–2486) and amended his
pending Motion to Recuse (R. 2487–2608). Despite the allegations and the
procedural defects raised, Judge Munford declined to recuse himself for a
second time without any substantive explanation (R. 2609–2613). 29
Separately, the Honorable Jeff Kaitcer—though not named in the recusal
motion—filed a voluntary recusal from the case (R. 2614–2618). In response,
Father filed an Objection to Procedural Handling of the Recusal
Proceedings, explaining that Judge Kaitcer’s referral order was improper
and specifically objected to the court coordinator managing the recusal
process (R. 2619–2625). On May 1, 2025, the appellate court denied

=== PAGE 12 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Father’s two remaining en banc motions per curiam (R. 2626-2627;
2628-2629). That same day, Father filed his second Petition for Writ of
Mandamus before this Court under cause number 25- 0361. 7 He filed a
third petition the next day, May 2, 2025, under cause number 25- 0367,
followed by a fourth on May 7, 2025, under cause number 25-0378. There
are now three concurrent mandamuses before this Honorable Court, but the
risk of compounding error continues down below. Z. Risk of Future Error An
Order of Assignment was forwarded by the coordinator from the Honorable
David L. Evans appointing Senior Chief Justice John Cayce to oversee the
recusal matters on May 6, 2025 (R. 3148-3150). Because the Order of
Assignment still incorrectly named the Honorable Jeffrey Kaitcer and the
coordinator was still handling the matters, Father filed a second objection
(R. 3151-3166). 7 The first filed mandamus before this court was filed on
April 8, 2024 under case number 25-0395. 30 AA. The Need for Relief
Continues On May 12, 2025, Father filed an Affidavit in cause number
25-0361 reiterating the need for an emergency stay of the trial court
proceedings (R. 3488- 3500). Three days later, the Honorable David L. Evans
overruled the Father’s objections regarding the involvement of the court
coordinator and the Hon. Kaitcer motion which was never filed (R.
3506-3508). The next day, Father filed an emergency notice with the Court
reiterating that the date by which he requested relief was approaching, and
he reiterated the need for an emergency stay and reminded the Court that
no opposition to the relief being sought had been raised. (R. 3501-3505). AB.
Mandamus #4 On May 19, 2025, the Father filed a Petition for Writ of
Mandamus before this Court as an Original Proceeding which was docketed
as case number 25-0426 on the grounds that the Regional Presiding Judge’s
refusal to comply with Rule 18a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure was an
abuse of discretion (R. 3509-3559). Father then prepared a Case
Memorandum and filed it in that cause number (R. 3837-3876). The next
day, Father filed an Emergency Motion to Stay reiterating the need for a stay
of the proceedings below given errors continue to compound. (R.
3877-3896). AC. Mandamus #5 The very same day, Hon. John H. Cayce, Jr.,
assigned by Hon. David L. 31 Evans, summarily denied the recusal of Hon.
James Munford, District Judge of the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County
(R. 3897-3900). An order was also issued denying the recusal of Hon. Jeff
Kaitcer, referring to a motion that was never filed. (R. 3901-3904). The next
day, Father filed a Notice of Intent to File Mandamus, raising the issue “…
that the record, on its face, demonstrates a clear deviation from procedural
due process and established Texas jurisprudence regarding recusal
proceedings, warranting immediate corrective action to uphold this court’s
impartiality and public confidence in the judiciary.” (R. 3905-3914). AD.
Striking the OAG Finally, on May 22, 2025, Father filed a Motion to Strike
the Intervention of the Office of the Attorney General requesting that “[i]f a
justiciable interest cannot be demonstrated or if a response is not filed by a
future date deemed appropriate by the Court, order that the intervention
pleading from the Office of the Attorney General naming Holly Hayes as
counsel be stricken from the record (R. 3915-3956). sHOw how that the
court cannot just sua sponte move the case to final trial despite all of these
issues. charles myers has been abused by the judicial system, and must stop
the final hearing from happening. Charles Myers has repeatedly sought
mandamus relief to halt proceedings and correct procedural and substantive
errors, but the trial court has continued to set the case for final trial despite

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
these pending appellate matters. Mandamus is available to correct clear
abuses of discretion by a trial court, especially where there is no adequate
remedy by appeal and the error threatens to render the proceedings
fundamentally unfair. See In re Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., 148 S.W.3d 124,
135-36 (Tex. 2004). Given the ongoing procedural irregularities, unresolved
motions, and risk of irreparable harm, mandamus relief is warranted to stay
the final trial until all issues are properly resolved.
Answer (Texas)
Short response
The trial court cannot lawfully proceed to final trial while there are
unresolved recusal motions, pending mandamus petitions, and significant
procedural irregularities; to do so would constitute a clear abuse of
discretion and risk rendering any resulting orders void. Mandamus relief is
warranted to halt the final trial until all outstanding legal and procedural
issues are properly resolved.
Summary
Texas law strictly prohibits a trial judge from taking further action in a case
once a motion to recuse has been filed and not yet decided, except for
limited circumstances expressly stated in writing. Orders issued in violation
of this rule are void, and mandamus is the appropriate remedy to prevent
irreparable harm and ensure the integrity of the proceedings, especially
where there are multiple, unresolved procedural and substantive errors as
in Charles Myers’s case.
Given the record of repeated failures to rule on properly filed motions, the
refusal to hear emergency relief, improper consolidation without hearing,
and the mishandling of recusal proceedings, the trial court’s attempt to
move the case to final trial is not only procedurally improper but also
fundamentally unfair. The law provides that mandamus should issue to halt
such proceedings, as Myers lacks an adequate remedy by appeal and the
risk of compounding error and injustice is substantial.
Background and Relevant Law
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a: Recusal and
Disqualification
Under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a, when a motion to recuse is filed
before evidence is offered at trial, the judge is required to take no further
action in the case until the motion is decided, except for good cause stated
in writing or on the record, see Rule 18a. Recusal and Disqualification of
Judges, Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a. This rule is mandatory and strictly enforced by
Texas appellate courts.

=== PAGE 14 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Mandamus Relief: Standards and Rationale
Mandamus is an extraordinary remedy available to correct a clear abuse of
discretion by a trial court when there is no adequate remedy by appeal, see 
In re Prudential Ins. Co. of America, 148 S.W.3d 124 (Tex. 2003); In re
Battenfield; In re Z Resorts Mgmt.; In re Southwestern Bell Telephone Co.
L.P., 235 S.W.3d 619 (Tex. 2007). The relator bears the burden of showing
both prongs: (1) a clear abuse of discretion and (2) the lack of an adequate
remedy by appeal.
A trial court abuses its discretion when it fails to follow guiding rules and
principles, acts arbitrarily or unreasonably, or fails to rule on properly filed
motions within a reasonable time, see Rio Grande Valley Gas Co., In re, 987
S.W.2d 167 (Tex. App. 1999); In re Blakeney, 254 S.W.3d 659 (Tex. App.
2008). When a judge fails to comply with the mandatory requirements of
Rule 18a regarding recusal, all subsequent actions by that judge are void,
see In re Gold, 04-25-00085-CV (Tex. App. May 07, 2025); In re Marshall,
515 S.W.3d 420 (Tex. App. 2017); In re Norman, 191 S.W.3d 858 (Tex. App.
2006).
Mandamus is also appropriate to compel a trial court to exercise its
discretion and to prevent arbitrary halts or improper accelerations in
proceedings, see In re Johnnie Tasby, 40 S.W.3d 190 (Tex. App. 2001).
Analysis
1. The Effect of a Pending Recusal Motion
The most direct and dispositive authority is Texas Rule of Civil Procedure
18a and its interpretation by the Texas appellate courts. When a motion to
recuse is filed before evidence is offered at trial, the judge must not take
further action in the case until the motion is resolved, unless there is good
cause stated in writing or on the record, see Rule 18a. Recusal and
Disqualification of Judges, Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a. The Texas Court of Appeals has
repeatedly held that any orders or actions taken by a judge after a recusal
motion is filed, but before it is decided, are void, see In re Gold,
04-25-00085-CV (Tex. App. May 07, 2025); In re Marshall, 515 S.W.3d 420
(Tex. App. 2017); In re Norman, 191 S.W.3d 858 (Tex. App. 2006).
In In re Gold, the court made clear that once a recusal motion is filed, the
respondent judge is limited to either recusing themselves or referring the
motion to the regional presiding judge. Any further action, including setting
the case for trial, is beyond the judge’s authority and renders subsequent
orders void. This principle is echoed in In re Marshall, where the court
conditionally granted mandamus relief and declared a temporary restraining
order void because it was signed after a recusal motion was filed but before
it was resolved.
Thus, if the trial court in Myers’s case proceeded to set the matter for final
trial while a recusal motion was pending and unresolved, such action is not

=== PAGE 15 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
merely erroneous but void as a matter of law. This alone is sufficient to
warrant mandamus relief to halt the proceedings.
2. Failure to Rule on Properly Filed Motions
Texas courts have consistently held that a trial court must consider and rule
on properly filed and pending motions within a reasonable time, see In re
Blakeney, 254 S.W.3d 659 (Tex. App. 2008); In re Z Resorts Mgmt.. A failure
to do so constitutes an abuse of discretion, and mandamus may issue to
compel the court to act. In Myers’s case, the record reflects a pattern of the
trial court failing to rule on multiple motions, including emergency motions,
motions for summary judgment, and requests for findings of fact and
conclusions of law. This failure to address pending matters before moving to
final trial is a clear abuse of discretion.
Moreover, the Texas Court of Appeals in In re Z Resorts Mgmt. found that
when a trial court fails to rule on matters that have been properly filed and
pending for a reasonable time, and the relator has requested rulings, the
court’s inaction is an abuse of discretion justifying mandamus relief.
3. Refusal to Hear Emergency TRO
The refusal to hear a properly filed emergency motion for a temporary
restraining order (TRO) is another significant procedural error. The right to
be heard on emergency relief is fundamental, especially in family law cases
where the welfare of children and the preservation of property or status quo
may be at stake. Arbitrarily refusing to hear such a motion, particularly
when the opposing party has been notified and is not present to object,
deprives the movant of due process and the opportunity to protect their
rights. This is the type of error that, if not corrected, can result in
irreparable harm and is not adequately remedied by appeal, see In re
Shulman, 544 S.W.3d 861 (Tex. App. 2017).
4. Improper Consolidation Without Hearing
The consolidation of cases without a hearing, especially over a party’s
objection and without proper notice or opportunity to be heard, is a
procedural irregularity that can amount to an abuse of discretion. The Texas
Court of Appeals in Flores v. Peschel, 927 S.W.2d 209 (Tex. App. 1996)
recognized that improper transfers or consolidations that create
jurisdictional conflicts between courts justify mandamus relief. In Myers’s
case, the record indicates that consolidation was ordered sua sponte and
without a hearing, further compounding the procedural defects.
5. Void Orders and Lack of Consent
The issuance of a consent judgment or order where consent is lacking, or
where the order exceeds the court’s statutory authority, is void and subject
to collateral attack. Texas law is clear that a void order is not merely
voidable, but is a legal nullity and can be set aside at any time, see In re
Marshall, 515 S.W.3d 420 (Tex. App. 2017); In re Gold, 04-25-00085-CV (Tex.

=== PAGE 16 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
App. May 07, 2025). If the trial court in Myers’s case rendered orders
purporting to reflect the parties’ agreement when, in fact, consent was
lacking or coerced, those orders are void and cannot form the basis for
further proceedings, including a final trial.
6. Adequacy of Remedy by Appeal
The Texas Supreme Court has repeatedly emphasized that mandamus is
appropriate where the error cannot be adequately remedied by appeal, see 
In re Prudential Ins. Co. of America, 148 S.W.3d 124 (Tex. 2003); In re State,
54 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 1754, 355 S.W.3d 611 (Tex. 2011). In family law cases,
where the rights of parents and children are at stake and the risk of
irreparable harm is high, appellate remedies are often inadequate. The
hardship and waste of judicial resources that would result from allowing a
final trial to proceed under a cloud of unresolved procedural defects and
void orders further supports the need for immediate mandamus relief.
The balancing of benefits and detriments, as articulated in In re State, 54
Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 1754, 355 S.W.3d 611 (Tex. 2011), weighs heavily in favor of
granting mandamus to prevent the waste of time and money that would
result from enduring eventual reversal of improperly conducted
proceedings.
7. Judicial Efficiency and the Risk of Compounding Error
Allowing the trial court to proceed to final trial in the face of multiple,
unresolved legal errors and pending appellate matters not only risks
compounding error but also undermines public confidence in the judiciary.
The Texas Supreme Court in In re Prudential Ins. Co. of America, 148 S.W.3d
124 (Tex. 2003) recognized that mandamus is necessary to prevent the loss
of substantial rights and to ensure that the judicial process is fair and
orderly.
Exceptions and Caveats
While the denial of a motion to recuse is generally reviewable on appeal
after final judgment, mandamus is available when the judge fails to comply
with the mandatory duty to either recuse or refer the motion to the
presiding judge, see In re Norman, 191 S.W.3d 858 (Tex. App. 2006). Thus,
the availability of mandamus in Myers’s case is not precluded by the general
rule regarding appellate review of recusal denials.
There may be rare circumstances where a court can proceed despite a
pending recusal motion, but only for good cause stated in writing or on the
record, see Rule 18a. Recusal and Disqualification of Judges, Tex. R. Civ. P.
18a. The record here does not reflect any such good cause.

=== PAGE 17 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Conclusion
The trial court’s attempt to move the case to final trial while there are
unresolved recusal motions, pending mandamus petitions, and significant
procedural irregularities is a clear abuse of discretion under Texas law.
Orders issued in violation of Rule 18a are void, and the failure to rule on
properly filed motions or to hear emergency relief further compounds the
error. Mandamus is the appropriate and necessary remedy to halt the final
trial and prevent irreparable harm, as Myers lacks an adequate remedy by
appeal and the risk of injustice is substantial. The court must stay the
proceedings until all outstanding legal and procedural issues are properly
resolved, in accordance with the guiding rules and principles established by
Texas law and the appellate courts.

circumstances, abating the case for the time period at issue is an abuse of
discretion and effectively vitiates Shulman’s ability to present a claim or
defense. Because relator lacks an adequate remedy by ordinary appeal, we
conditionally grant the petition for writ of mandamus as to the abatement
order.
Summary
The Texas Court of Appeals found that the trial court's decision to abate the
case was an abuse of discretion because it effectively prevented the relator
from presenting a claim or defense. The court granted mandamus relief
because there was no adequate remedy by appeal. This supports the
proposition that mandamus is available to correct clear abuses of discretion
by a trial court, especially when the error threatens to render the
proceedings fundamentally unfair.
In re Prudential Ins. Co. of America, 148 S.W.3d 124 (Tex. 2003)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
The issue before us in the present case — whether a pre-suit waiver of trial
by jury is enforceable — fits well within the types of issues for which
mandamus review is not only appropriate but necessary. It is an issue of law,

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
one of first impression for us, but likely to recur... It eludes answer by
appeal. In no real sense can the trial court's denial of Prudential's
contractual right to have the Secchis waive a jury ever be rectified on
appeal... Finally, we note that other courts have granted mandamus relief to
enforce contractual jury waivers, including the only other Texas court to
have addressed the issue.
Summary
The passage from "In re Prudential Ins. Co. of America" illustrates that
mandamus relief is appropriate when a trial court's error cannot be rectified
on appeal, particularly when substantial rights are at risk of being
permanently lost. This aligns with the proposition that mandamus is
available to correct clear abuses of discretion by a trial court, especially
when the error threatens to render the proceedings fundamentally unfair.
In re Blakeney, 254 S.W.3d 659 (Tex. App. 2008)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
A trial court is required to consider and rule on a properly filed and pending
motion within a reasonable time. See In re Shaw, 175 S.W.3d 901, 904 (Tex.
App.-Texarkana 2005, orig. proceeding); In re Tasby, 40 S.W.3d 190, 191
(Tex.App.-Texarkana 2001, orig. proceeding). In proper cases, mandamus
may issue to compel the trial court to act.
Summary
Texas courts have established that a trial court must rule on motions within
a reasonable time. If a court fails to do so, mandamus relief may be
appropriate to compel the court to act. This principle is applicable to the
situation described in the proposition, where Charles Myers is seeking to
prevent a final trial from proceeding due to unresolved motions and
procedural irregularities.
In re State, 54 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 1754, 355 S.W.3d 611 (Tex. 2011)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
Because the trial court abused its discretion, we must consider whether the
State has an adequate remedy by appeal. If it does not, mandamus is proper.
We assess the adequacy of an appellate remedy by 'balancing the benefits of
mandamus review against the detriments.' In re Team Rocket, L.P., 256 S.W.
3d 257, 262 (Tex.2008). In performing this balancing, we look at a number

=== PAGE 19 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
of factors, among them 'whether mandamus will spare litigants and the
public ‘the time and money utterly wasted enduring eventual reversal of
improperly conducted proceedings.’ ' Id. ( quoting In re Prudential Ins. Co.
of Am., 148 S.W.3d 124, 136 (Tex.2004)).
Summary
Conditions under which mandamus relief is appropriate, particularly when a
trial court's actions result in an inadequate remedy by appeal. It emphasizes
the importance of preventing the waste of judicial and public resources by
avoiding improperly conducted proceedings. This aligns with the proposition
that mandamus petitions have been filed due to distinct legal errors by trial
courts, suggesting that mandamus relief is necessary to address these
errors and prevent further waste.
Rio Grande Valley Gas Co., In re, 987 S.W.2d 167 (Tex. App. 1999)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Mandamus will issue only to correct a clear abuse of discretion when there
is no adequate remedy by appeal. Mitchell Energy Corp. v. Ashworth, 943
S.W.2d 436, 437 (Tex.1997) (citing Walker v. Packer, 827 S.W.2d 833, 839
(Tex.1992)). A trial court abuses its discretion when it does not follow
guiding rules and principles and reaches an arbitrary and unreasonable
decision. Republic Royalty Co. v. Evins, 931 S.W.2d 338, 342 (Tex.App.--
Corpus Christi 1996, orig. proceeding); Excel Corp. v. Valdez, 921 S.W.2d
444, 448 (Tex.App.--Corpus Christi 1996, orig. proceeding); see Walker, 827
S.W.2d at 839. When one court directly interferes with the jurisdiction of the
other, mandamus becomes appropriate. In re McCall, 967 S.W.2d 934,
938-39 (Tex.App.--Corpus Christi 1998, orig. proceeding); Republic, 931 S.W.
2d at 341; Flores v. Peschel, 927 S.W.2d 209, 211 (Tex.App.--Corpus Christi
1996, orig. proceeding).
Summary
Conditions under which mandamus relief is appropriate, specifically when a
trial court abuses its discretion by not following guiding rules and
principles, resulting in an arbitrary and unreasonable decision. This is
directly relevant to the proposition, as it supports the argument that
mandamus relief is warranted in cases where there are significant legal
errors and procedural irregularities, as alleged in the four mandamus
petitions mentioned in the proposition.
In re Gold, 04-25-00085-CV (Tex. App. May 07, 2025)
Texas Court of Appeals

=== PAGE 20 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
Once Gold filed the motion to recuse, respondent could not take further
action other than signing an order of recusal or an order referring the
motion to the regional presiding judge. See Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a(f)(1); In re
Marshall, 515 S.W.3d 420, 422 (Tex. App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2017, orig.
proceeding). The failure to take one of these two actions renders subsequent
orders void. In re Marshall, 515 S.W.3d at 422; In re Norman, 191 S.W.3d
858, 861 (Tex. App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2006, orig. proceeding) ('If a judge
fails to comply with the rules governing motions for recusal, all subsequent
actions by the judge in that case are void.').
Summary
The passage from "In re Gold" highlights that when a motion to recuse is
filed, the judge must either recuse themselves or refer the motion to the
regional presiding judge. Any actions taken by the judge after the filing of a
recusal motion, without addressing the motion, are considered void. This is
directly relevant to the proposition as it underscores the procedural error of
a judge proceeding with actions, such as setting a final trial, while a recusal
motion is pending. This supports the argument that the trial court's actions
in Charles Myers' case, if taken while a recusal motion was pending, would
be void and thus constitute a legal error.
In re Ortegon, 616 S.W.3d 48 (Tex. App. 2020)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will issue only to correct a clear
abuse of discretion when there is no other adequate remedy at law. In re Sw.
Bell Tel. Co., L.P., 235 S.W.3d 619, 623 (Tex. 2007) (orig. proceeding). A trial
court has no discretion in determining what the law is or applying the law to
the facts. Walker v. Packer, 827 S.W.2d 833, 840 (Tex. 1992) (orig.
proceeding). Thus, a clear failure by the trial court to analyze or apply the
law correctly will constitute an abuse of discretion, and may result in
appellate reversal by extraordinary writ. Id.
Summary
Mandamus is an appropriate remedy when a trial court clearly abuses its
discretion, especially when there is no adequate remedy by appeal. This
aligns with the proposition that mandamus relief is warranted to correct
procedural and substantive errors that threaten to render proceedings
fundamentally unfair.
In re Battenfield

=== PAGE 21 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Mandamus requires an 'abuse of discretion' by the trial court. In re USAA
Gen. Indem. Co., 624 S.W.3d 782, 787 (Tex. 2021) (orig. proceeding)
('Mandamus is an extraordinary remedy requiring the relator to show that
(1) the trial court abused its discretion and (2) the relator lacks an adequate
remedy on appeal.')... The second mandamus prong, whether there is an
'adequate remedy by appeal,' is 'simply a proxy for the careful balance of
jurisprudential considerations that determine when appellate courts will use
original mandamus proceedings to review the actions of lower courts.' In re
Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., 148 S.W.3d 124, 136 (Tex. 2004) (orig.
proceeding).
Summary
Requirements for mandamus relief, emphasizing that it is appropriate when
there is an abuse of discretion by the trial court and no adequate remedy by
appeal. This aligns with the proposition that mandamus can be used to
address procedural and substantive errors that threaten to make
proceedings fundamentally unfair. The passage also highlights the flexibility
of mandamus as a remedy, which is crucial in family law cases where the
rights of parents and children are involved.
In re Z Resorts Mgmt.
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
To be entitled to mandamus relief, a relator must show (1) the trial court
clearly abused its discretion and (2) the relator lacks an adequate remedy by
appeal. In re Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., 148 S.W.3d 124, 135-36 (Tex. 2004)
(orig. proceeding). The relator bears the burden of proving these two
requirements. Walker v. Packer, 827 S.W.2d 833, 840 (Tex. 1992) (orig.
proceeding). ... We conclude that these matters were properly filed, they
have been pending a reasonable time given the circumstances of this case,
relators requested rulings on the matters, and the trial court has failed to
rule. Accordingly, we conclude the trial court has clearly abused its
discretion in failing to rule on these matters.
Summary
The requirements for mandamus relief include showing that the trial court
abused its discretion and that there is no adequate remedy by appeal. The
passage also highlights that a trial court's failure to rule on properly filed
motions can constitute an abuse of discretion. This is relevant to the
proposition because it supports the argument that the trial court's actions in

=== PAGE 22 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
the described case may warrant mandamus relief due to procedural errors
and the lack of rulings on pending matters.
In re Johnnie Tasby, 40 S.W.3d 190 (Tex. App. 2001)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
This Court may not prescribe the manner in which a trial court exercises its
discretion, but we may, by mandamus, order a trial court to exercise its
discretion in some manner. Cooke v. Millard, 854 S.W.2d 134, 135 (Tex. App.-
Houston. [1st Dist.] 1992, orig. proceeding); Jones v. Smith, 470 S.W.2d 305,
307 (Tex. Civ. App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 1971, orig. proceeding). A trial court
may not arbitrarily halt proceedings in a pending case, and mandamus will
lie to compel a trial court to hear and rule on motions pending before it. See
Greenberg, Benson, Fisk & Fielder, P.C. v. Howell, 685 S.W.2d 694, 695 (Tex.
App.-Dallas 1984, orig. proceeding).
Summary
The Texas Court of Appeals recognizes the use of mandamus to compel a
trial court to exercise its discretion and to prevent arbitrary halts in
proceedings. This supports the proposition that mandamus relief is
appropriate when there are distinct legal errors and procedural
irregularities, as alleged in the multiple mandamus petitions filed by Charles
Myers.
In re Marshall, 515 S.W.3d 420 (Tex. App. 2017)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Relator contends the TRO is void because respondent: (a) signed it after
relator filed a motion to recuse, and (b) did not first grant the motion or
refer the motion to the regional presiding judge under Texas Rule of Civil
Procedure 18(a)(f). We conditionally grant the requested mandamus relief...
Once the motion to recuse was filed, respondent could not take further
action other than signing an order of recusal or an order referring the
motion to the regional presiding judge. See Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a(f)(2)(A) ; In re
Susan C. Norman, 191 S.W.3d at 861. Failing to take one of these two
actions renders subsequent orders void. Id. ('[i]f a judge fails to comply with
the rules governing motions for recusal, all subsequent actions by the judge
in that case are void.')... We conclude that because the respondent signed
the TRO after the handwritten motion to recuse was filed without complying
with Rule 18a(f)(1), the TRO is void. A TRO that is void is subject to remedy
by mandamus.

=== PAGE 23 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
When a motion to recuse is filed, the judge must either recuse themselves or
refer the motion to the regional presiding judge. Any actions taken by the
judge without complying with this requirement render subsequent orders
void. This supports the proposition that procedural errors, such as failing to
adhere to recusal rules, can lead to void orders and justify mandamus relief.
In re Norman, 191 S.W.3d 858 (Tex. App. 2006)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Denial of a motion to recuse is appealable upon final judgment. TEX.R. CIV.
P. 18a(f). Thus, a relator challenging the denial of a recusal motion ordinarily
has an adequate remedy by appeal of the denial of a motion to recuse.
However, mandamus relief is available when a judge violates a mandatory
statutory duty either to recuse or refer a motion to recuse. McLeod v. Harris,
582 S.W.2d 772, 775 (Tex.1979); In re Healthmark Partners, L.L.C., No.
14-04-00743-CV, 2004 WL 1899953, at *1 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.],
Aug. 26, 2004, orig. proceeding) (mem.op).
Summary
When a judge fails to comply with the mandatory duty to either recuse
themselves or refer a recusal motion to the presiding judge, mandamus
relief is available. This is relevant to Charles Myers' situation, as it suggests
that if the trial court judges did not properly handle recusal motions, their
subsequent actions could be void, and mandamus relief could be warranted
to address these procedural errors.
Flores v. Peschel, 927 S.W.2d 209 (Tex. App. 1996)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
By the present mandamus proceeding, John and Jewel Flores complain that
the respondent, judge of the 25th Judicial District Court in Gonzales County,
had no authority to transfer to his own court a proceeding which was then
pending in the Calhoun County Court at Law No. 1. We agree and
conditionally grant mandamus relief... In the present case, the order of the
Gonzales County court purports to divest the Calhoun County court of
jurisdiction over a case pending in the latter court. This presents a sufficient
present conflict of jurisdictions between courts to justify mandamus relief.

=== PAGE 24 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
The passage from "Flores v. Peschel" illustrates a situation where a court
improperly attempted to transfer a case from another court, leading to a
jurisdictional conflict. This supports the proposition by highlighting a legal
error that justifies mandamus relief, similar to the errors alleged in the
proposition regarding improper consolidation and jurisdictional issues.
In re Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. L.P., 235 S.W.3d 619 (Tex. 2007)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
Mandamus relief is an extraordinary remedy that issues only if the court
clearly abused its discretion and the relator has no adequate remedy by
appeal. ... That, coupled with the hardship occasioned by postponed
appellate review, makes mandamus an appropriate remedy.
Summary
The passage from the Texas Supreme Court decision outlines the conditions
under which mandamus relief is appropriate: when a trial court has clearly
abused its discretion and there is no adequate remedy by appeal. This aligns
with the proposition that the trial court's actions have violated procedural
norms and caused significant hardship, warranting mandamus relief. The
passage also emphasizes the hardship caused by postponed appellate
review, which is relevant to the ongoing procedural irregularities and
unresolved motions in the case at hand.
Rule 18a. Recusal and Disqualification of Judges
Extract
Restrictions on Further Action. (A) Motion Filed Before Evidence Offered at
Trial. If a motion is filed before evidence has been offered at trial, the
respondent judge must take no further action in the case until the motion
has been decided, except for good cause stated in writing or on the record.
Summary
When a motion to recuse is filed before evidence is offered at trial, the judge
is restricted from taking further action in the case until the motion is
decided. This supports the proposition that procedural errors have occurred,
as it suggests that the trial court should not proceed to final trial while there
are pending motions to recuse that have not been resolved. This aligns with

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
the petitioner's argument that the trial court's actions are procedurally
irregular and warrant mandamus relief.
