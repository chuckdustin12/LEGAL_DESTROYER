Question
Morgan Michelle Myers, Margie Evonne Wilson, and Danielle Kenneth
Branthoover acted together with a common goal of removing Charles Dustin
Myers from his home. The individuals coordinated their actions, including
preparing false documents in Oklahoma and submitting them to Texas
courts. An "enterprise" under RICO includes any group of individuals
associated in fact, even if not a formal organization, as long as they share a
common purpose and function as a continuing unit (18 U.S.C. § 1961(4)).
The coordinated actions and shared goal of the individuals suggest the
existence of an enterprise under RICO.
Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
The coordinated actions of Morgan Michelle Myers, Margie Evonne Wilson,
and Danielle Kenneth Branthoover to remove Charles Dustin Myers from his
home, including preparing false documents in Oklahoma and submitting
them to Texas courts, strongly suggest the existence of an "enterprise"
under RICO as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4). The individuals' shared goal
and coordinated interstate activities satisfy the broad definition of an
"association-in-fact" enterprise under RICO jurisprudence, which includes
any group of individuals associated together for a common purpose, even
without a formal organizational structure.
Summary
The coordinated actions of Morgan Michelle Myers, Margie Evonne Wilson,
and Danielle Kenneth Branthoover to remove Charles Dustin Myers from his
home through the preparation of false documents in Oklahoma and their
submission to Texas courts establish a strong case for the existence of an
"enterprise" under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act
(RICO). Under 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4), an "enterprise" includes "any individual,
partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or
group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity." This
definition has been consistently interpreted broadly by courts to include
informal associations of individuals who share a common purpose and
function as a continuing unit.
The case law from the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas
consistently supports the proposition that an association-in-fact enterprise
under RICO requires evidence of: (1) a common purpose among the
participants; (2) an ongoing organization, whether formal or informal; and
(3) members functioning as a continuing unit, as demonstrated by a
decision-making structure. The coordinated interstate activities of the three
individuals—preparing false documents in Oklahoma and submitting them to
Texas courts—demonstrate both the required organization and common

purpose. Their shared goal of removing Charles Dustin Myers from his home
provides the unifying purpose that courts have recognized as sufficient to
establish an enterprise under RICO, even without a formal structure or
economic motive.
Relevant Legal Framework
Legislation
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) provides
the statutory foundation for analyzing whether the actions of Morgan
Michelle Myers, Margie Evonne Wilson, and Danielle Kenneth Branthoover
constitute an "enterprise." The key provisions include:
18 U.S.C. § 1961(4) defines an "enterprise" as including "any individual,
partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or
group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity." 18 U.S.C.
§ 1961(4) (2025). This expansive definition encompasses both formal legal
entities and informal associations.
18 U.S.C. § 1962 establishes the prohibited activities under RICO, including:
"It shall be unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any
enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign
commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of
such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity or
collection of unlawful debt." 18 U.S.C. § 1962 (2025). This provision
establishes the connection required between the enterprise and interstate
commerce, as well as the pattern of racketeering activity.
Case Law Interpretation
Enterprise Definition and Requirements
Courts have consistently interpreted the definition of "enterprise" under
RICO broadly. In State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Punjwani, CIVIL ACTION
NO. H-19-1491 (S.D. Tex. Dec 31, 2019), the court outlined that claims under
RICO have three common elements: "(1) a person who engages in (2) a
pattern of racketeering activity, (3) connected to the acquisition,
establishment, conduct, or control of an enterprise." The court further
affirmed that an enterprise "includes any individual, partnership,
corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of
individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity."
Similarly, in Cedra Pharmacy Houston, LLC v. UnitedHealth Grp., Inc., CIVIL
ACTION NO. H-17-3800 (S.D. Tex. Mar 07, 2019), the court noted that if a
plaintiff is alleging an association-in-fact enterprise, there must be
allegations and evidence demonstrating "an ongoing organization, formal or
informal, and... evidence that the various associates function as a continuing
unit."

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Association-in-Fact Requirements
The requirements for establishing an association-in-fact enterprise were
elaborated in Allstate Ins. Co. v. Benhamou, 190 F.Supp.3d 631 (S.D. Tex.
2016), where the court stated: "When the alleged enterprise is an
association-in-fact enterprise, the plaintiff must show evidence of: (1) an
existence separate and apart from the pattern of racketeering; (2) ongoing
organization; and (3) members that function as a continuing unit as shown
by a hierarchical or consensual, decision-making structure." The court
emphasized that "alleging that association-in-fact members actively
associate with one another and work cooperatively and illegally to achieve a
goal is sufficient to establish plausible enterprise status."
Formal Structure Not Required
Importantly, courts have clarified that a formal structure is not required for
an association-in-fact enterprise. In Trevino v. Pechero, 592 F.Supp.2d 939
(S.D. Tex. 2008), the court explicitly stated: "The Court is not aware of cases
which indicate that the Fifth Circuit requires any sort of formal structure
within an association-in-fact enterprise." This interpretation aligns with
earlier precedent in Heden v. Hill, 937 F.Supp. 1230 (S.D. Tex. 1996), which
noted that an enterprise is proved by "evidence of an ongoing organization,
formal or informal, and by evidence that the various associates function as a
continuing unit."
Broad Interpretation of Enterprise
The breadth of the "enterprise" definition has been consistently emphasized
in case law. In Bonton v. Archer Chrysler Plymouth, Inc., 889 F.Supp. 995
(S.D. Tex. 1995), the court stated: "RICO defines 'enterprise' very broadly...
There is no restriction upon the associations embraced by the definition: an
enterprise includes any union or group of individuals associated in fact."
Similarly, Mitchell Energy Corp. v. Martin, 616 F.Supp. 924 (S.D. Tex. 1985)
emphasized that "the definition of enterprise for purposes of RICO is very
broad" and "does not require that the enterprises be a legal entity."
Secondary Materials
Secondary materials further support this broad interpretation. "RICO: A
Primer" (2022) confirms that "courts have interpreted 'enterprise' broadly,
and the definition captures both legitimate and illegitimate enterprises. The
statutory list is not exhaustive but merely illustrative." "RICO: A
Primer" (2022-01-31).
Another source notes that federal courts have significant discretion in
recognizing a RICO enterprise: "There is no rigid standard that must be
satisfied. Minimally, a RICO enterprise must be an ongoing organization,
formal or informal, whose associates operate as a continuous unit." "What
can RICO not do? RICO and the non-economic intrastate enterprise that
perpetrates only non-economic racketeering activity." (2009-03-22).

Analysis of the Alleged Enterprise
Common Purpose
The facts indicate that Morgan Michelle Myers, Margie Evonne Wilson, and
Danielle Kenneth Branthoover "acted together with a common goal of
removing Charles Dustin Myers from his home." This shared purpose
satisfies one of the key requirements for an association-in-fact enterprise
under RICO. As noted in Allstate Ins. Co. v. Benhamou, 190 F.Supp.3d 631
(S.D. Tex. 2016), "alleging that association-in-fact members actively
associate with one another and work cooperatively and illegally to achieve a
goal is sufficient to establish plausible enterprise status."
The Supreme Court's interpretation, as referenced in "RICO - the rejection
of an economic motive requirement." (1995-03-22), defines enterprise as "a
group of persons associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a
course of conduct," which does not require an economic motive. This broad
interpretation encompasses the described activities of the three individuals
who coordinated their actions toward the common goal of removing Charles
Dustin Myers from his home.
Ongoing Organization
The coordinated nature of the individuals' actions suggests an ongoing
organization. They "coordinated their actions, including preparing false
documents in Oklahoma and submitting them to Texas courts." This level of
coordination across state lines requires planning, communication, and
organization, albeit potentially informal. As established in Cedra Pharmacy
Houston, LLC v. UnitedHealth Grp., Inc., CIVIL ACTION NO. H-17-3800
(S.D. Tex. Mar 07, 2019), an association-in-fact enterprise requires "an
ongoing organization, formal or informal."
The fact that the individuals prepared documents in one state (Oklahoma)
and submitted them to courts in another state (Texas) indicates a level of
sophistication and planning that goes beyond spontaneous action,
suggesting an ongoing organization.
Functioning as a Continuing Unit
The coordination of activities across state lines—preparing false documents
in Oklahoma and submitting them to Texas courts—suggests that the
individuals functioned as a continuing unit throughout at least this series of
actions. As noted in Heden v. Hill, 937 F.Supp. 1230 (S.D. Tex. 1996), an
enterprise is proved by "evidence of an ongoing organization, formal or
informal, and by evidence that the various associates function as a
continuing unit."
The collaboration required to prepare false documents and navigate the
judicial systems of multiple states demonstrates a level of cohesion and
continuity in the group's operations. This continuity satisfies the
requirement that members of an association-in-fact enterprise "function as a

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
continuing unit," as required by Allstate Ins. Co. v. Benhamou, 190 F.Supp.
3d 631 (S.D. Tex. 2016).
Existence Separate from Pattern of Racketeering Activity
Courts have emphasized that an enterprise must exist separate and apart
from the pattern of racketeering activities. As stated in In re Enron Corp.
Securities, Derivative & Erisa, 284 F.Supp.2d 511 (S.D. Tex. 2003), the
enterprise is not the pattern of racketeering activity itself.
In this case, the association of Morgan Michelle Myers, Margie Evonne
Wilson, and Danielle Kenneth Branthoover can be distinguished from their
alleged racketeering activities (preparing false documents and submitting
them to courts). Their association—formed with the goal of removing
Charles Dustin Myers from his home—exists conceptually separate from the
specific alleged fraudulent acts they employed to achieve that goal.
This distinction satisfies the requirement that the enterprise must have "an
existence separate and apart from the pattern of racketeering," as required
by Allstate Ins. Co. v. Benhamou, 190 F.Supp.3d 631 (S.D. Tex. 2016).
Interstate Commerce Connection
The preparation of false documents in Oklahoma and their submission to
Texas courts clearly establishes an interstate connection, which is relevant
to the jurisdiction of RICO under 18 U.S.C. § 1962. As stated in the statute, it
applies to "any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect,
interstate or foreign commerce." 18 U.S.C. § 1962 (2025). The cross-state
nature of the activities satisfies this jurisdictional requirement.
Potential Challenges to Enterprise
Classification
Potential Argument: Lack of Formal Organization
One might argue that the three individuals lack the formal organization
necessary to constitute an enterprise under RICO. However, this argument
fails in light of consistent judicial interpretation that no formal structure is
required. As explicitly stated in Trevino v. Pechero, 592 F.Supp.2d 939 (S.D.
Tex. 2008), "The Court is not aware of cases which indicate that the Fifth
Circuit requires any sort of formal structure within an association-in-fact
enterprise."
Similarly, Heden v. Hill, 937 F.Supp. 1230 (S.D. Tex. 1996) emphasized that
an enterprise can be "formal or informal." The coordinated interstate
activities of the three individuals demonstrate sufficient organization, even if
informal, to satisfy the requirements for an association-in-fact enterprise
under RICO.

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Potential Argument: Limited Duration of Association
Another potential challenge might be that the association of the three
individuals was of limited duration and therefore does not satisfy the
"continuing unit" requirement. However, the preparation of false documents
and their submission to courts necessarily involves multiple steps and
actions over time, suggesting a relationship of sufficient duration to satisfy
the "continuing unit" requirement.
Moreover, the "continuity" requirement can be satisfied by a "closed period
of repeated conduct," as noted in "RECONCEIVING COERCION-BASED
CRIMINAL DEFENSES." (2022-03-22), which referenced Supreme Court
precedent defining continuity as "referring either to a closed period of
repeated conduct, or to past conduct that by its nature projects into the
future with a threat of repetition."
Potential Argument: Enterprise Indistinguishable from
Racketeering Activity
A third potential challenge might be that the alleged enterprise is not
sufficiently distinct from the pattern of racketeering activity itself. However,
as discussed above, the association formed for the purpose of removing
Charles Dustin Myers from his home exists conceptually separate from the
specific alleged fraudulent acts employed to achieve that goal.
This distinction satisfies the requirement established in In re Enron Corp.
Securities, Derivative & Erisa, 284 F.Supp.2d 511 (S.D. Tex. 2003) and other
cases that the enterprise must exist separate and apart from the pattern of
racketeering activities.
Application of RICO Elements to the Facts
Person Element
Each of the three individuals—Morgan Michelle Myers, Margie Evonne
Wilson, and Danielle Kenneth Branthoover—can be considered a "person"
under RICO. The statute does not restrict the type of individuals who can be
considered persons for RICO purposes.
Pattern of Racketeering Activity Element
While the full details of the alleged racketeering activities are not provided,
the preparation of false documents and their submission to courts could
potentially constitute predicate acts under RICO, such as mail fraud, wire
fraud, or obstruction of justice. As noted in "Civil Rico: A Tool of
Advocacy" (2024-01-01), "A 'pattern of racketeering activity' [can be shown]
by pointing to at least two distinct but related predicate acts. Related
predicate acts have the 'same or similar purposes, results, participants,
victims, or methods.'"

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
The preparation of false documents in Oklahoma and their submission to
Texas courts would likely constitute multiple related predicate acts with the
same purpose (removing Charles Dustin Myers from his home), the same
participants (the three individuals), the same victim (Charles Dustin Myers),
and similar methods (preparation and submission of fraudulent documents).
Enterprise Element
As extensively analyzed above, the coordinated actions of Morgan Michelle
Myers, Margie Evonne Wilson, and Danielle Kenneth Branthoover in pursuit
of their common goal of removing Charles Dustin Myers from his home
strongly suggest the existence of an association-in-fact enterprise under the
broad definition provided in 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4) and consistently interpreted
by courts.
Conduct Element
The individuals' preparation of false documents and their submission to
courts represent active participation in the conduct of the enterprise's
affairs. This satisfies the conduct element of RICO, which requires that the
persons "conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such
enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity." 18 U.S.C. §
1962 (2025).
Conclusion
The coordinated actions of Morgan Michelle Myers, Margie Evonne Wilson,
and Danielle Kenneth Branthoover to remove Charles Dustin Myers from his
home, including preparing false documents in Oklahoma and submitting
them to Texas courts, strongly suggest the existence of an "enterprise"
under RICO as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4).
The evidence supports this conclusion in several ways:
Common Purpose: The individuals acted together with the shared
goal of removing Charles Dustin Myers from his home, satisfying the
requirement that members of an association-in-fact enterprise share a
common purpose.
Ongoing Organization: The coordination required to prepare false
documents in one state and submit them to courts in another
demonstrates an ongoing organization, albeit potentially informal,
which satisfies the requirement that an association-in-fact enterprise
have an ongoing organizational structure.
Functioning as a Continuing Unit: The collaboration necessary to
execute their plan across state lines indicates that the individuals
functioned as a continuing unit throughout their activities, satisfying
the continuity requirement for an association-in-fact enterprise.

Existence Separate from Racketeering Activity: The association
formed for the purpose of removing Charles Dustin Myers from his
home exists conceptually separate from the specific alleged fraudulent
acts employed to achieve that goal, satisfying the requirement that the
enterprise exist separate and apart from the pattern of racketeering
activities.
Interstate Commerce Connection: The cross-state nature of the
activities satisfies the jurisdictional requirement that the enterprise
engage in or affect interstate commerce.
The consistent judicial interpretation of 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4) supports a broad
understanding of what constitutes an "enterprise" under RICO, including
informal associations of individuals who share a common purpose and
function as a continuing unit, even without a formal organizational structure
or economic motive. The coordinated interstate activities of Morgan
Michelle Myers, Margie Evonne Wilson, and Danielle Kenneth Branthoover
in pursuit of their common goal strongly suggest the existence of such an
enterprise.
Legal Authorities
Allstate Ins. Co. v. Benhamou, 190 F.Supp.3d 631 (S.D. Tex. 2016)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of Texas
Extract
RICO defines an enterprise as 'any individual, partnership, corporation,
association or other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals
associated in fact although not a legal entity.' Plambeck, 802 F.3d at 673
(quoting 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4) ) (internal quotation marks omitted).
Accordingly, a RICO enterprise can be either a legal entity or an association-
in-fact. ... When the alleged enterprise is an association-in-fact enterprise,
the plaintiff must show evidence of: (1) an existence separate and apart from
the pattern of racketeering; (2) ongoing organization; and (3) members that
function as a continuing unit as shown by a hierarchical or consensual,
decision-making structure. ... Thus, alleging that association-in-fact
members actively associate with one another and work cooperatively and
illegally to achieve a goal is sufficient to establish plausible enterprise
status.
Summary
Requirements for establishing such an enterprise, including a common
purpose, ongoing organization, and functioning as a continuing unit. The
coordinated actions and shared goal of the individuals in the proposition
align with these requirements, suggesting the existence of an enterprise
under RICO.

Farmers Tex. Cnty. Mut. Ins. Co. v. 1St Choice Accident & Injury, LLC
U.S. District Court — Southern District of Texas
Extract
Plambeck states: The defendants point to no binding authority that an
enterprise must have a purpose besides committing racketeering activity.
Instead, they assert that there must be a different purpose because a RICO
enterprise cannot be the pattern of racketeering itself. But in [United States
v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 583 (1981)], the Court rejected a similar challenge
that would have excluded from 'enterprise' those entities pursuing solely
unlawful ends.
Summary
The passage from the case discusses the interpretation of what constitutes
an "enterprise" under RICO. It clarifies that an enterprise does not need a
separate lawful purpose and can exist solely for unlawful activities. This
supports the proposition that the coordinated actions of the individuals,
even if solely for unlawful purposes, can constitute an enterprise under
RICO.
Mitchell Energy Corp. v. Martin, 616 F.Supp. 924 (S.D. Tex. 1985)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of Texas
Extract
The final argument Defendants advance on the RICO claims involve the
enterprise requirement of the RICO statute. Defendants argue that Plaintiffs
have failed to allege the existence of an enterprise separate from the
Defendants. The Court has considered and rejected the argument that such
a separate enterprise must be pled. In the Fifth Circuit, the 'definition of
enterprise for purposes of RICO is very broad ...', Alcorn, 731 F.2d at 1168,
and the statute does not require that the enterprises be a legal entity. 18
U.S.C. § 1961(4).
Summary
The definition of an "enterprise" under RICO is broad and does not require
the enterprise to be a legal entity. This supports the proposition that a group
of individuals acting with a common purpose, such as preparing false
documents and submitting them to courts, can constitute an enterprise
under RICO.

U.S. District Court — Southern District of Texas
Extract
Defendant Chrysler argues that individual RICO defendants cannot
constitute the RICO enterprise and that an 'association-in-fact' enterprise
requires some sort of structure, but she cites only Seventh and Ninth Circuit
cases for these propositions. (Doc. 38 at 3). In the Fifth Circuit, a plaintiff
must distinguish between RICO persons and RICO enterprises. Abraham v.
Singh, 480 F.3d 351, 357 (5th Cir.2007). The enterprise is not a pattern of
racketeering activity, but must exist separate and apart from the pattern of
racketeering activity in which it engages. Whelan v. Winchester Production
Co., 319 F.3d 225, 229 (5th Cir.2003). The Court is not aware of cases which
indicate that the Fifth Circuit requires any sort of formal structure within an
association-in-fact enterprise.
Summary
Within the Fifth Circuit, an "association-in-fact" enterprise under RICO does
not require a formal structure. This supports the proposition that individuals
can form an enterprise if they share a common purpose and function as a
continuing unit, even if they are not a formal organization. The passage also
emphasizes the need to distinguish between RICO persons and enterprises,
which aligns with the proposition that the individuals acted together with a
common goal, suggesting the existence of an enterprise.

Broad definition of "enterprise" under RICO, which includes any group of
individuals associated in fact, even if not a formal organization. It
emphasizes that an enterprise can be informal and is demonstrated by
evidence of an ongoing organization where associates function as a

U.S. District Court — Southern District of Texas
Extract
For purposes of civil RICO liability, 'enterprise' includes any individual,
partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or
group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity." See 18
U.S.C. § 1961(4). Thus, a RICO enterprise can be either a legal entity or an
association-in-fact. In re Burzynski, 989 F.2d at 743. Regardless of whether
the enterprise is alleged to be a legal entity or an association-in-fact, '[t]he
'enterprise' is not the 'pattern of racketeering activity'; it is an entity
separate and apart from the pattern of [racketeering] activity in which it
engages.
Summary
A RICO enterprise can be an association-in-fact, which does not need to be a
formal legal entity. This supports the proposition that the individuals
involved could be considered an enterprise under RICO if they acted with a
common purpose and functioned as a continuing unit, even if they were not
a formal organization.

Claims under RICO, 18 U.S.C. § 1962, have three common elements: '(1) a
person who engages in (2) a pattern of racketeering activity, (3) connected
to the acquisition, establishment, conduct, or control of an enterprise.'... An
enterprise 'includes any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or

Summary
To establish a RICO claim, there must be a person engaged in a pattern of
racketeering activity connected to an enterprise. The definition of an
"enterprise" under RICO includes any group of individuals associated in fact,
even if not a formal organization, as long as they share a common purpose.

in the conduct of the enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering
activity. This supports the proposition by suggesting that if Morgan Michelle
Myers, Margie Evonne Wilson, and Danielle Kenneth Branthoover acted
together with a common goal and engaged in a pattern of racketeering
activity, they could be considered an "enterprise" under RICO. Their
coordinated actions, such as preparing false documents and submitting
them to courts, could be seen as participating in the conduct of the
enterprise's affairs.
RICO - the rejection of an economic motive requirement.
Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology - Northwestern University,
School of Law - Randolph, Jennifer G. - 1995-03-22
Extract
RICO requires that the enterprise have an economic motive, the Court
defined enterprise as 'an entity,... a group of persons associated together for
a common purpose of engaging in a course of conduct,' which does not
require an economic motive. Thus, the Court established precedent for a
liberal reading of RICO, and specifically the term 'enterprise.' ... The Court
concluded that the [sections] 1961 (4) definition of enterprise as 'any
individual, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, and
any union or group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal
entity,' does not indicate an economic motive.
Summary
The definition of "enterprise" under RICO does not require an economic
motive. The Court's interpretation allows for a broad understanding of what
constitutes an enterprise, including any group of individuals associated in
fact for a common purpose. This supports the proposition that the
coordinated actions and shared goal of the individuals in question could
suggest the existence of an enterprise under RICO, even if their actions
were not economically motivated.

What can RICO not do? RICO and the non-economic intrastate enterprise
that perpetrates only non-economic racketeering activity.

School of Law - Nisbet, Brian - 2009-03-22
Extract
Enterprise and racketeering activity, defined in [section] 1961(1) and (4) of
RICO, are generous in scope. '[A]ny individual, partnership, corporation,
association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals
associated in fact although not a legal entity' can constitute a RICO
enterprise. Federal courts have a significant amount of discretion in
recognizing a RICO enterprise. There is no rigid standard that must be
satisfied. Minimally, a RICO enterprise must be an ongoing organization,
formal or informal, whose associates operate as a continuous unit.
Summary
The definition of a RICO enterprise is broad and includes any group of
individuals associated in fact, even if not a formal organization. The passage
emphasizes that federal courts have discretion in recognizing a RICO
enterprise and that there is no rigid standard, only that the enterprise must
be an ongoing organization, formal or informal, whose associates operate as
a continuous unit. This supports the proposition that the coordinated actions
and shared goal of the individuals in question could suggest the existence of
a RICO enterprise.

and any union or group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal
entity.” This language is expansive; the word “includes” renders the
statutory list illustrative, not exhaustive. See, e.g., Boyle v. United States,
556 U.S. 938, 944 & n.2 (2009) (“The statute does not specifically define the
outer boundaries of the ‘enterprise’ concept but states that the term
‘includes any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal
entity, and any union or group of individuals associated in fact although not
a legal entity.’ . . . This provision does not purport to set out an exhaustive
definition of the term ‘enterprise.’”); United States v. Huber, 603 F.2d 387
(2d Cir. 1979), cert. denied, 445 U.S. 927 (1980) (“The definition... by
evidence of an ongoing organization, formal or informal, and [second] by
evidence that the various associates function as a continuing unit.” Third,

“pattern” requirements: “The ‘enterprise’ is not the ‘pattern of racketeering

activity,’ it is an entity separate and apart from the pattern of activity in
which it engages.” Id. at 583.
Summary
The definition of an "enterprise" under RICO is broad and includes any
group of individuals associated in fact, even if not a legal entity. The passage
emphasizes that an enterprise can be informal and is distinct from the
pattern of racketeering activity. This supports the proposition that the
coordinated actions and shared goal of the individuals in question could
constitute an "enterprise" under RICO.
Could you use that in a sentence, please? The intersection of prosecutorial
ethics, relevant conduct sentencing, and criminal RICO indictments.
Notre Dame Law Review - University of Notre Dame Law School -
McClintock, William S. - 2013-12-01
Extract
The definition of 'enterprise' has a complicated judicial history. The
unadorned statutory text defines 'enterprise' as 'any individual, partnership,
corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of
individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.' In United States v.
Turkette, the Court confronted the enterprise concept and held that an
enterprise included both legitimate, legally constituted entities, as well as
criminal groups that are not legally structured, but are nevertheless
associations-in-fact. The enterprise is an entity, for present purposes a group
of persons associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a
course of conduct.
Summary
The definition of "enterprise" under RICO includes groups of individuals
associated in fact, even if they are not legally structured. The case United
States v. Turkette supports the idea that an enterprise can be a group of
individuals working together for a common purpose, which aligns with the
proposition that the individuals coordinated their actions with a shared goal.

The plaintiff must next demonstrate the existence of an 'enterprise.' There is
no requirement that the enterprise be criminal in character; the enterprise
may be a legitimate business, such as a bank or a bank holding company.

Indeed, even the office of state governor has been found to be an enterprise
subject to RICO. Nor must the enterprise be formally organized; it may be
an 'association-in-fact.' The enterprise may be the perpetrator, instrument,
victim or prize of the fraud. The enterprise must be distinguished from the
pattern of racketeering activity. Notwithstanding, the same evidence may be
used to establish both the pattern and the existence of the enterprise.
Summary
An "enterprise" under RICO does not need to be a formal organization or
have a criminal character. It can be an "association-in-fact," which aligns
with the proposition that the individuals acted together with a common goal.
The passage also notes that the same evidence can establish both the
pattern of racketeering activity and the existence of the enterprise,
supporting the idea that the coordinated actions of the individuals could
demonstrate an enterprise under RICO.
Reflections on Reves v. Ernst & Young: its meaning and impact on
substantive, accessory, aiding abetting and conspiracy liability under RICO.
American Criminal Law Review - Georgetown University Law Center -
Blakey, G. Robert - 1996-01-01
Extract
The concept of the 'enterprise' was selected by Congress when it enacted
RICO because it desired to use 'terms and concepts of breadth.' Indeed, the
statute itself broadly describes 'enterprise' to include 'any individual,
partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or
group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.' Thus, any
legal entity may be an enterprise, and any group of persons--in any
combination of natural and legal persons--may also constitute an enterprise,
even though it is not a legal entity, by being an association-in-fact.
Summary
The definition of "enterprise" under RICO is intentionally broad, allowing for
the inclusion of any group of individuals associated in fact, even if not a
formal organization. This supports the proposition that the coordinated
actions and shared goal of the individuals in question could constitute an
"enterprise" under RICO, as they acted together with a common purpose.

Extract
A violation of § 1962(c), the section on which Sedima relies, requires (1)
conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity. The plaintiff must allege each of the elements to state a claim. They
are all equally essential components, and the complaint will fail if any one of
them is not adequately pleaded... A 'racketeering activity' refers to a
violation of a specific statute. For the first element, the plaintiff can show a
'pattern of racketeering activity' by pointing to at least two distinct but
related predicate acts. Related predicate acts have the 'same or similar
purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods.'
Summary
Elements required to establish a RICO claim under § 1962(c), which includes
proving the existence of an enterprise, a pattern of racketeering activity, and
conduct of the enterprise's affairs through racketeering. The passage also
explains that related predicate acts must have similar purposes, results,
participants, victims, or methods, which aligns with the proposition that the
individuals acted with a common goal and coordinated actions.
Corporate Criminal Liability: End It, Don't Mend It.
The Journal of Corporation Law - University of Iowa Journal of
Corporation Law - Smith, Stephen F. - 2022-06-22
Extract
Subsection 1962(c), the most commonly used basis for substantive RICO
charges, is instructive. It imposes civil and criminal liability on the persons
'employed by or associated with' organized-crime syndicates or other RICO
'enterprises' who 'conduct, or participate in the conduct of, the [enterprise's]
affairs' through a 'pattern of racketeering activity.' ... Although it was
originally quite doubtful that purely criminal organizations could constitute
RICO enterprises, the Supreme Court has long endorsed that expansive
interpretation, which breathed new life into RICO by allowing prosecutors to
go directly after organized criminals without awaiting efforts to infiltrate
legitimate businesses. See United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 587
(1981) (holding that purely illegitimate groups can constitute RICO
enterprises).
Summary
RICO's definition of an "enterprise" is broad and includes any group of
individuals associated in fact, even if not a formal organization. The passage
highlights that the Supreme Court has endorsed an expansive interpretation
of RICO, allowing for the prosecution of purely illegitimate groups as
enterprises. This supports the proposition that the coordinated actions and

shared goal of the individuals in question could suggest the existence of an
enterprise under RICO.

RICO conspiracy was established by proof of: (a) of an agreement to join a
racketeering scheme, (b) of the defendant's knowing engagement in the
scheme with the intent that its overall goals be effectuated, and (c) that the
scheme involved, or by agreement between any members of the conspiracy
was intended to involve, two or more predicate acts of racketeering.
Summary
Elements required to establish a RICO conspiracy, which includes an
agreement to join a racketeering scheme, knowing engagement with intent
to effectuate the scheme's goals, and involvement in two or more predicate
acts of racketeering. This supports the proposition that the individuals acted
with a common goal and coordinated actions, suggesting the existence of an
enterprise under RICO.
RECONCEIVING COERCION-BASED CRIMINAL DEFENSES.
Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology - Northwestern University,
School of Law - Galoob, Stephen R. - 2022-03-22
Extract
The inquiry here is meant to invoke the 'pattern of racketeering activity'
element of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).
The Organized Crime Control Act (1970), which includes RICO, provides that
'criminal conduct forms a pattern if it embraces criminal acts that have the
same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of
commission, or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics
and are not isolated events.' The Supreme Court characterized this
requirement as a 'relationship' element and held that the statute further
requires a 'continuity' element, 'referring either to a closed period of
repeated conduct, or to past conduct that by its nature projects into the
future with a threat of repetition.'
Summary
The RICO statute requires a "pattern of racketeering activity," which
involves criminal acts with similar purposes, results, participants, or
methods that are interrelated and not isolated. The passage also highlights

=== PAGE 20 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
the need for a "relationship" and "continuity" element, which can be
demonstrated by repeated conduct or conduct that poses a threat of future
repetition. This supports the proposition that the coordinated actions and
shared goal of the individuals suggest the existence of an enterprise under
RICO.
