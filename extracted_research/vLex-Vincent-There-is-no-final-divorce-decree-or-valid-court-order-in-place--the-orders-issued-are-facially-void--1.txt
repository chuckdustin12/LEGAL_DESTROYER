Question
There is no final divorce decree or valid court order in place; the orders
issued are facially void and unenforceable. Texas law requires a final,
appealable order to confer continuing jurisdiction for modification or
enforcement (see Tex. Fam. Code § 6.702; In re Burlington Coat Factory
Warehouse of McAllen, Inc., 167 S.W.3d 827, 830 (Tex. 2005)). Without a
valid final order, the court lacks jurisdiction to proceed, and the case should
be dismissed.
Answer (Texas)
Short response
Under Texas law, a court does not acquire continuing, exclusive jurisdiction
to modify or enforce family law orders unless a valid, final, and appealable
order has been rendered; orders issued without such finality are void and
unenforceable, depriving the court of jurisdiction to proceed. In the absence
of a final divorce decree or valid court order, the case must be dismissed for
want of jurisdiction.
Summary
Texas statutory and case law uniformly require that a court’s continuing,
exclusive jurisdiction in family law matters—such as divorce, child custody,
or support—arises only upon the rendition of a final, appealable order that
disposes of all issues and parties. If no such final order exists, any
subsequent orders are facially void, and the court lacks authority to modify,
enforce, or otherwise proceed in the matter.
The authorities make clear that interlocutory or incomplete orders, or those
entered after the court’s plenary power has expired, do not confer
jurisdiction and cannot be enforced or modified. As a result, where there is
no valid final decree or enforceable order, Texas courts are required to
dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction.
Background and Relevant Law
Legislative Framework
The Texas Family Code is explicit regarding the acquisition of continuing,
exclusive jurisdiction in family law matters. Section 155.001 provides that a
court acquires such jurisdiction only upon the rendition of a final order.
Specifically, the statute states that, except as otherwise provided, a court
gains continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over matters involving a child only
when a final order is rendered. If no final order has been issued, any

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
subsequent suit must be initiated as an original proceeding, not as a
modification or enforcement action (Tex. Fam. Code § 155.001 (2025)).
This legislative requirement is foundational: it means that the court’s
authority to act in future proceedings—such as modifications of custody,
support, or enforcement—depends entirely on the existence of a valid, final,
and appealable order. Without such an order, the court is without power to
proceed.
Case Law
Texas appellate courts have consistently interpreted and enforced this
statutory requirement. The following principles emerge from the case law:
Finality Requirement for Jurisdiction: Courts acquire continuing,
exclusive jurisdiction only upon the entry of a final order that disposes
of all issues and parties. Orders that are interlocutory, incomplete, or
expressly reserve issues for future adjudication do not confer such
jurisdiction (Moore v. Brown, 993 S.W.2d 871 (Tex. App. 1999); Trevino
v. Ables, 943 S.W.2d 166 (Tex. App. 1997); In re I.A.F. (Tex. App. 2022)).
Voidness of Orders Issued Without Jurisdiction: Any order or
judgment signed after the court’s plenary power has expired, or in the
absence of a final order, is void and unenforceable. Judicial actions
taken after jurisdiction has lapsed are nullities (In re Harris (Tex. App.
2024); In re Office of the Att’y Gen. of Tex., 264 S.W.3d 800 (Tex. App.
2008); In re A.J.F., 313 S.W.3d 475 (Tex. App. 2010)).
Necessity of Finality Language and Disposition of All Issues: For
an order to be final and appealable, it must contain language indicating
finality and must resolve all issues as to all parties. If the order
anticipates further action or reserves issues for later determination, it
is interlocutory and does not confer jurisdiction (In re Marriage of
Maradiaga (Tex. App. 2020); Cowan v. Moreno, 903 S.W.2d 119 (Tex.
App. 1995); Zellers v. Barthel, 727 S.W.2d 364 (Tex. App. 1987); Ault v.
Mulanax, 724 S.W.2d 824 (Tex. App. 1986)).
Procedural Requirements for Modification or Enforcement:
Modifications or enforcement actions require a valid, final order as
their jurisdictional basis. If no such order exists, or if the court’s
plenary power has expired, any subsequent orders are invalid (In re
Marriage of Cobb (Tex. App. 2024); In re B.U.H. (Tex. App. 2020)).
Jurisdictional Consequences: If a court lacks a valid final order, it
cannot proceed with modification or enforcement, and the case must be
dismissed for want of jurisdiction (Trevino v. Ables (Tex. App. 1997); 
Zellers v. Barthel (Tex. App. 1987)).

Analysis
The Requirement of a Final, Appealable Order
The Texas Family Code and the case law are unequivocal: a court’s
continuing, exclusive jurisdiction in family law matters is triggered only by
the rendition of a final order. Section 155.001 of the Family Code is explicit
that such jurisdiction arises only upon the entry of a final order. This is not a
mere procedural formality; it is a jurisdictional prerequisite. The statute
further clarifies that, absent a final order, any subsequent suit must be
brought as an original proceeding, not as a modification or enforcement
action (Tex. Fam. Code § 155.001 (2025)).
The courts have consistently interpreted this requirement to mean that any
order that does not dispose of all issues and parties, or that reserves issues
for future adjudication, is not final and does not confer jurisdiction for
further proceedings. For example, in Moore v. Brown, 993 S.W.2d 871 (Tex.
App. 1999), the court held that continuing, exclusive jurisdiction is acquired
only upon the rendition of a final order in a suit affecting the parent-child
relationship. Similarly, Trevino v. Ables, 943 S.W.2d 166 (Tex. App. 1997)
emphasized that the statutory scheme presumes the existence of a final
decree before a court can exercise continuing, exclusive jurisdiction.
The requirement for finality is further reinforced by the need for the order
to contain language indicating that it is final and appealable, and to resolve
all issues as to all parties. In In re Marriage of Maradiaga (Tex. App. 2020),
the absence of finality language and the anticipation of further action
rendered the order interlocutory and not final. Cowan v. Moreno, 903 S.W.2d
119 (Tex. App. 1995) and Ault v. Mulanax, 724 S.W.2d 824 (Tex. App. 1986)
similarly held that a judgment is final only if it disposes of all issues and
parties, and that interlocutory orders do not confer jurisdiction for appeal or
further proceedings.
Voidness and Lack of Jurisdiction
If a court issues an order after its plenary power has expired, or in the
absence of a valid final order, that order is void and unenforceable. This
principle is well established in Texas law. In In re Harris (Tex. App. 2024),
the court held that any order or judgment signed after the court loses
plenary jurisdiction is void. The court cited prior authority for the
proposition that orders entered outside a trial court’s plenary power are
nullities (In re Office of the Att’y Gen. of Tex., 264 S.W.3d 800 (Tex. App.
2008); In re A.J.F., 313 S.W.3d 475 (Tex. App. 2010)). This means that any
action taken by the court after its jurisdiction has lapsed is without legal
effect.
This principle is directly relevant to the scenario where no final divorce
decree or valid court order exists. Any orders issued in such circumstances
are facially void and unenforceable, and the court lacks jurisdiction to
proceed with modification or enforcement. The case law is clear that the

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
absence of a final order deprives the court of the authority to act, and any
purported orders are nullities.
Procedural Requirements for Modification or Enforcement
The procedural requirements for modification or enforcement actions
further reinforce the necessity of a valid, final order. In In re Marriage of
Cobb (Tex. App. 2024), the court found a modification order invalid because
the trial court’s plenary power over the original divorce decree had expired,
and no proper pleadings or notice for modification had been filed. The court
emphasized that, without a valid final order and compliance with procedural
requirements, any modification order is invalid.
Similarly, In re B.U.H. (Tex. App. 2020) highlighted that a court acquires
continuing, exclusive jurisdiction only upon the rendition of a final order,
and that, absent such an order, the court does not have jurisdiction to
proceed with modifications or enforcement. The case law thus makes clear
that the existence of a valid, final order is a jurisdictional prerequisite for
any subsequent proceedings.
Consequences of Lack of Final Order
The consequences of the absence of a final order are clear: the court lacks
jurisdiction to proceed, and the case must be dismissed. In Trevino v. Ables, 
943 S.W.2d 166 (Tex. App. 1997), the court held that, without a final decree
to modify, the relevant statutory provisions do not apply, and the court lacks
jurisdiction. Zellers v. Barthel, 727 S.W.2d 364 (Tex. App. 1987) similarly
held that, where an order does not dispose of all issues, it is not final and
appealable, and the court lacks jurisdiction to hear the merits of the
controversy.
The requirement for finality is not merely technical; it is a substantive
jurisdictional requirement. Without a valid, final, and appealable order, the
court is without power to act, and any orders issued are void and
unenforceable.
Supplementary Authorities
Supplementary authorities reinforce these principles. For example, In re
C.D.B. (Tex. App. 2015) held that a trial court lacks jurisdiction to modify a
child-support order if it no longer has the power to render an original child-
support order. Jones v. Tex. Dep’t of Family, 400 S.W.3d 173 (Tex. App. 2013)
emphasized the importance of determining which court has continuing,
exclusive jurisdiction before rendering a final order, and that orders issued
without such determination are voidable.
Exceptions and Caveats
While the authorities are clear regarding the requirement for a final,
appealable order to confer jurisdiction, there are limited statutory
exceptions. For example, certain interlocutory orders may be made

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
appealable by statute, but these are exceptions to the general rule and are
not applicable in the absence of a final order disposing of all issues and
parties (Ault v. Mulanax, 724 S.W.2d 824 (Tex. App. 1986)). Additionally, the
Family Code provides for continuing jurisdiction in certain circumstances,
such as enforcement of property division under Section 9.002, but these
provisions still require the existence of a final decree or order as their
jurisdictional basis (In re I.A.F. (Tex. App. 2022)).
It is also important to note that, in rare cases, courts have addressed the
issue of voidable versus void orders, particularly where there is confusion
about which court has continuing, exclusive jurisdiction (Jones v. Tex. Dep’t
of Family, 400 S.W.3d 173 (Tex. App. 2013)). However, these cases do not
undermine the fundamental requirement for a final, appealable order as a
prerequisite for jurisdiction.
Conclusion
Texas law is unequivocal: a court’s continuing, exclusive jurisdiction in
family law matters arises only upon the rendition of a valid, final, and
appealable order that disposes of all issues and parties. Orders that are
interlocutory, incomplete, or entered after the court’s plenary power has
expired are void and unenforceable, and the court lacks jurisdiction to
proceed with modification or enforcement. In the absence of a final divorce
decree or valid court order, the case must be dismissed for want of
jurisdiction. This principle is firmly established in both the Texas Family
Code and the case law, and there are no relevant exceptions that would
permit the court to proceed in the absence of a final order.

Under binding precedent, the trial court lacked jurisdiction over the
respondent's request for modification of the trial court's prior child-support
order and his affirmative claim for reimbursement. ... The Supreme Court of
Texas and this court have held that a trial court lacks jurisdiction to modify a
child-support order after the trial court has lost jurisdiction to render an
original child-support order. ... Because the relevant statutes have not been
changed substantially, this court is bound, by both Red and Harkins, to hold
that the trial court lacked jurisdiction over Brent's petition to modify the

Summary
Lack of jurisdiction of a trial court to modify a child-support order if it no
longer has the power to render an original child-support order. This aligns
with the proposition that without a valid final order, the court lacks
jurisdiction to proceed. The passage references binding precedent and
statutory provisions that support the idea that jurisdiction is contingent
upon the existence of a valid, original order.

There is no finality language in the purported decree. See In re R.R.K., 590
S.W.3d 535, 543 (Tex. 2019) (discussing Lehmann v. Har-Con Corp., 39 S.W.
3d 191, 206 (Tex. 2001) ('This judgment finally disposes of all parties and all
claims and is appealable.'). Moreover, the ruling expressly anticipates the
preparation of a 'Final Decree of Divorce and all necessary documents to
effectuate the division of property and obligations — either counsel may set
for entry as necessary.'
Summary
The court's ruling lacks finality language, which is necessary for an order to
be considered final and appealable. The ruling also anticipates further
action to finalize the decree, which means it is not yet a final order. This
supports the proposition that without a final order, the court lacks
jurisdiction to proceed with modifications or enforcement.
In re Marriage of Cobb, 07-23-00311-CV (Tex. App. Jul 17, 2024)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Richard contends the modification order is invalid because the final divorce
decree was a final judgment and the trial court lost plenary power thirty
days after its rendition. Albeit for different reasons, we agree the
modification order is invalid. ... Generally, a trial court has plenary power for
thirty days after a judgment is signed to otherwise grant a new trial or to
vacate, modify, correct, or reform the judgment. TEX. R. CIV. P. 329b(d). ...
Here, it is undisputed that the trial court's plenary power over the divorce
decree rendered in November 2022 had expired at the time of the status
hearing held in June 2023. More importantly, Kylie did not file a motion to
modify or any pleadings seeking modification of the trial court's custody
determinations, nor did she provide notice to Richard of any modification.

Summary
Expiration of the trial court's plenary power over a final divorce decree and
the requirement for proper pleadings and notice for any modification. It
highlights that without a valid final order and proper procedure, any

valid final order, the court lacks jurisdiction to proceed.
Zellers v. Barthel, 727 S.W.2d 364 (Tex. App. 1987)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
In this appeal we are presented with the question of whether a trial court's
order, which does not dispose of all issues before the court, is final so as to
give this court jurisdiction to hear the merits of the controversy. We find that
the judgment is not final and as a result dismiss the purported appeal for
want of jurisdiction... Finally, the presumption does not apply to judgments
that affirmatively reserve some ultimate issues or decisions for future
adjudication. For example, divorce judgments which expressly reserve the
issue of child support or property division will not be given the presumption
of finality... It is our opinion that the 'Order on Motion to Modify in Suit
Affecting Parent-Child Relationship' is not a final, appealable order. The
order, by its very terms, does not dispose of all issues before the court. As a
result, it falls within the fourth exception to the Aldridge rule because it
reserves an ultimate issue for future adjudication.
Summary
Requirement for a court order to be final in order to confer jurisdiction for
appeal. It highlights that orders which do not resolve all issues or reserve
issues for future adjudication are not considered final. This aligns with the
proposition that without a final order, the court lacks jurisdiction to proceed,
supporting the need for dismissal if no final order is present.

Summary
The passage explains that any order or judgment signed after a court's
plenary jurisdiction has expired is considered void. This directly supports
the proposition that without a valid final order, the court lacks jurisdiction to

Notwithstanding Rule 329b, the Texas Family Code provides for continuing
jurisdiction in certain circumstances. The court that rendered a decree of
divorce or annulment retains the power to enforce a property division,
subject to certain limitations. Tex. Fam. Code § 9.002. Additionally, the
family code's Title 5, which governs 'The Parent-Child Relationship and the
Suit Affecting the Parent-Child Relationship,' states in section 155.001(a)
that '[e]xcept as otherwise provided by this section, a court acquires
continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over the matters provided for by this title
in connection with a child on the rendition of a final order.' Id. § 155.001(a);
see also id. § 101.025 ('parent-child relationship' means 'the legal
relationship between a child and the child's parents' and 'includes the
mother and child relationship and the father and child relationship').
Summary
The Texas Family Code specifies that a court acquires continuing, exclusive
jurisdiction over certain family law matters only upon the rendition of a final
order. This supports the proposition that without a valid final order, the
court lacks jurisdiction to proceed with modifications or enforcement
actions.

Extract
A final decree is generally characterized as appealable. Interlocutory orders
are not appealable unless they are specifically made so by statute. To be

final, a decree must dispose of all issues presented by the pleadings so that
no future action will be necessary to settle and determine the case. ... A
judgment is interlocutory when it determines less than all issues as to all
parties, thereby leaving something to be determined and adjudicated by the
court in disposing of the parties and their rights.
Summary
The passage explains that for a decree to be considered final, it must resolve
all issues presented by the pleadings, leaving no further action necessary.
This aligns with the proposition that without a final, appealable order, the
court lacks jurisdiction to proceed. The passage also distinguishes between
final and interlocutory orders, emphasizing that interlocutory orders do not
confer continuing jurisdiction unless specifically made appealable by statute.
Trevino v. Ables, 943 S.W.2d 166 (Tex. App. 1997)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
By referring to the court of 'continuing, exclusive jurisdiction,' this section
assumes that a final decree has been entered in the suit affecting the parent-
child relationship. See id. § 155.001(d) (noting that a final order establishes
a court of continuing, exclusive jurisdiction). Without a final decree to
modify, section 155.201 does not apply. ... Because this issue was not
addressed, the decree was not a final order and, therefore, did not create a
court of continuing, exclusive jurisdiction.
Summary
The passage from "Trevino v. Ables" clarifies that for a court to have
continuing, exclusive jurisdiction, a final decree must be entered. The case
highlights that without a final order, the court does not have the jurisdiction
to modify or enforce orders, as seen in the reference to Texas Family Code §
155.001(d). This directly supports the proposition that without a valid final
order, the court lacks jurisdiction.

such a final order, the court does not have the jurisdiction to proceed with
modifications or enforcement. This directly supports the proposition that

Summary
For a judgment to be final and appealable in Texas, it must resolve all issues
and determine the rights of all parties involved. If any issue is reserved for
later adjudication, the judgment is considered interlocutory and not final.
This supports the proposition that without a final order, the court lacks
jurisdiction to proceed.

The Texas Department of Family and Protective Services failed to discern
whether any other court was a court of continuing, exclusive jurisdiction
over the children the subject of this suit, which rendered the Court's
decision on December 17, 2010 voidable pursuant to Texas Family Code §
155.104(b). There are two final orders entered in two separate Travis
County cases involving the children the subject of this suit; therefore those
courts are the courts of continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over the children
the subject of this suit, and this Court should set aside the voidable order
entered on December 17, 2010.
Summary
The passage discusses a situation where a court's decision was rendered
voidable because it failed to recognize another court's continuing, exclusive
jurisdiction. This aligns with the proposition that without a valid final order,
a court lacks jurisdiction to proceed. The passage highlights the importance
of determining which court has continuing, exclusive jurisdiction before
rendering a final order, supporting the idea that orders issued without such
determination are voidable.
