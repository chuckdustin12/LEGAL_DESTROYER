Question
Myers, Branthoover, and Wilson engaged in multiple predicate acts,
including: 1. Mail fraud (using the U.S. Mail Service to effectuate service
with false statements in legal documents). 2. Wire fraud (using text
messages and electronic communications to further their schemes). 3.
Extortion (threatening Plaintiff with eviction and other consequences to
coerce compliance). The predicate acts occurred over a period of time,
beginning in December 2023 and continuing through at least May 2025. A
"pattern of racketeering activity" requires at least two predicate acts of
racketeering activity within a 10-year period, and these acts must be related
and amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity (H.J. Inc. v.
Northwestern Bell Telephone Co., 492 U.S. 229 (1989)). The repeated acts of
mail fraud, wire fraud, and extortion over an extended period demonstrate a
pattern of racketeering activity under RICO.
Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
Yes, the alleged actions of Myers, Branthoover, and Wilson constitute a
pattern of racketeering activity under RICO, as they involve multiple
predicate acts of mail fraud, wire fraud, and extortion occurring over an
extended period from December 2023 through May 2025. The activities
satisfy the statutory requirement of at least two predicate acts within a 10-
year period and meet the relatedness and continuity requirements
established by the Supreme Court in H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell
Telephone Co.
Summary
Based on the relevant statutory provisions and case law, the alleged conduct
of Myers, Branthoover, and Wilson constitutes a pattern of racketeering
activity under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO)
Act. The individuals allegedly engaged in multiple predicate acts recognized
under RICO, including mail fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1341), wire fraud (18 U.S.C. §
1343), and extortion (18 U.S.C. § 1951), over a period extending from
December 2023 through May 2025. These actions satisfy the statutory
requirement of at least two predicate acts within a 10-year period
established by 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5).
Furthermore, the conduct meets both the "relationship" and "continuity"
requirements established by the Supreme Court in H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern
Bell Telephone Co., 492 U.S. 229 (1989). The predicate acts appear to be
related as they involve similar purposes, methods, and victims, and
demonstrate continuity through their occurrence over approximately 18
months. This extended timeframe is sufficient to establish "closed-ended
continuity" as a pattern of repeated criminal conduct over a substantial

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
period, rather than isolated or sporadic incidents. As such, the alleged
actions form a pattern of racketeering activity that would support a RICO
claim.
Background and Relevant Law
Legislative Framework
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) provides
both criminal penalties and civil remedies for certain prohibited activities
carried out as part of an ongoing criminal organization. To establish a RICO
violation, it is necessary to prove both the existence of an "enterprise" and a
connected "pattern of racketeering activity."
Under 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1), "racketeering activity" encompasses a wide
range of criminal offenses, including mail fraud, wire fraud, and extortion.
According to 18 U.S.C. § 1961: "'racketeering activity' means... section 1341
(relating to mail fraud), section 1343 (relating to wire fraud),... section 1951
(relating to interference with commerce, robbery, or extortion)..."
The statute further defines a "pattern of racketeering activity" in 18 U.S.C. §
1961(5): "'pattern of racketeering activity' requires at least two acts of
racketeering activity, one of which occurred after the effective date of this
chapter and the last of which occurred within ten years (excluding any
period of imprisonment) after the commission of a prior act of racketeering
activity."
The substantive prohibition relevant to this analysis is found in 18 U.S.C. §
1962(c), which states: "It shall be unlawful for any person through a pattern
of racketeering activity or through collection of an unlawful debt to acquire
or maintain, directly or indirectly, any interest in or control of any enterprise
which is engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign
commerce."
The predicate acts alleged in this case are defined in the following statutes:
Mail Fraud: 18 U.S.C. § 1341 prohibits the use of the postal service to
execute "any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or
property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or
promises."
Wire Fraud: 18 U.S.C. § 1343 prohibits the use of "wire, radio, or
television communication in interstate or foreign commerce" to execute
a scheme to defraud.
Extortion: 18 U.S.C. § 1951 defines extortion as "the obtaining of
property from another, with his consent, induced by wrongful use of
actual or threatened force, violence, or fear, or under color of official
right."

Case Law
The statutory definition of a "pattern of racketeering activity" has been
extensively interpreted by courts. In the seminal case of H.J. Inc. v.
Northwestern Bell Telephone Co., 492 U.S. 229 (1989), the Supreme Court
held that "in order to prove a pattern of racketeering activity, a plaintiff or
prosecutor must show at least two racketeering predicates that are related
and that amount to, or threaten the likelihood of, continued criminal
activity."
The Court clarified that relationship and continuity are separate
requirements: "'Continuity' is both a closed- and open-ended concept,
referring either to a closed period of repeated conduct, or to past conduct
that by its nature projects into the future with a threat of repetition." The
Court further explained that "a party alleging a RICO violation may
demonstrate continuity over a closed period by proving a series of related
predicates extending over a substantial period of time. Predicate acts
extending over a few weeks or months and threatening no future criminal
conduct do not satisfy this requirement: Congress was concerned in RICO
with long-term criminal conduct."
This interpretation has been consistently applied by lower courts. For
instance, in Price v. Rampersad, 22-cv-03131-DG-SJB (E.D. N.Y. Jan 03,
2023), the court reiterated that "To state a claim under RICO's civil
provision, 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), a plaintiff must allege (1) that the defendant
(2) through the commission of two or more acts (3) constituting a
'pattern' (4) of 'racketeering activity' (5) directly or indirectly invests in, or
maintains [an] interest in, or participates in (6) an 'enterprise' (7) the
activities of which affect interstate or foreign commerce." The court also
affirmed that "For acts to form a 'pattern' of racketeering activity, there
must be at least two acts, and they must be related and 'amount to, or pose
a threat of, continuing criminal activity.'"
Similarly, in Nutrition Distribution LLC v. Custom Nutraceuticals LLC, 194
F.Supp.3d 952 (D. Ariz. 2016), the court explained that a "pattern of
racketeering activity" requires at least two acts of racketeering activity that
are "related" and "amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity."
The "relationship" prong has been defined in Wisdom v. First Midwest Bank,
of Poplar Bluff, 167 F.3d 402 (8th Cir. 1999), which states that this element
is satisfied if the predicate acts "have the same or similar purposes, results,
participants, victims, or methods of commission, or otherwise are
interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not isolated events."
With respect to the "continuity" requirement, courts have recognized two
types of continuity. In Tabas v. Tabas, 47 F.3d 1280 (3rd Cir. 1995), the court
explained that "continuity means that plaintiffs must allege 'more than
sporadic or isolated activity.'" This case was declined to extend by Yucaipa
Am. All. Fund I, LP v. Ehrlich, No. 16-3664 (3rd Cir. Nov 15, 2017), but the
core principles regarding continuity remain valid.

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
The Heinrich v. Waiting Angels Adoption Servs., Inc., 668 F.3d 393 (6th Cir.
2012) decision further clarified that while the statute requires a minimum of
two predicate acts, "the Supreme Court has held that the minimum two acts
are not necessarily sufficient. In order to show a 'pattern' of racketeering
activity, a plaintiff must show that the racketeering predicates are related,
and that they amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity."
Regarding the specific predicate acts, U.S. v. International Longshoremen's
Ass'n, 518 F.Supp.2d 422 (E.D. N.Y. 2007) explained that "The essential
elements of a mail [or wire] fraud violation are (1) a scheme to defraud, (2)
money or property [as the object of the scheme], and (3) use of the mails [or
wires] to further the scheme."
It's worth noting that United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576 (1981) was
abrogated by United States v. Lane, 474 U.S. 438 (1986), but the abrogation
was on grounds unrelated to the core principles of RICO discussed here.
Similarly, US v. LOCAL 1804-1, INTERN. LONGSHOREMEN'S ASS'N, 812 F.
Supp. 1303 (S.D. N.Y. 1993) was stated as abrogated by United States v.
Philip Morris USA, Inc., 907 F.Supp.2d 1 (D. D.C. 2012), but the fundamental
elements of establishing a pattern of racketeering activity were not affected.
Secondary Materials
Secondary sources further elucidate the requirements for establishing a
pattern of racketeering activity under RICO. According to Civil Rico: A Tool
of Advocacy (2024), "A violation of § 1962(c)... requires (1) conduct (2) of an
enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity." The source also
notes that "RICO claims based on mail or wire fraud must comport with
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b)'s requirement that allegations involving
fraud be pleaded with particularity."
RICO: A Primer (2022) confirms that "Among other things, 'racketeering
activities' include 'any act which is indictable under' a list of federal criminal
statutes. The list covers an expansive range of violations, for example,
violations of the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1951 (extortion); 18 U.S.C. § 1341
(mail fraud) and 1343 (wire fraud)... Mail and wire fraud are the most
common predicate acts..."
On the issue of continuity, Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations
(2022) explains that "A plaintiff can satisfy RICO's pattern requirement two
ways: (1) by alleging a long-running series of interrelated predicate acts
constituting a closed-ended conspiracy; or (2) by alleging at least two
interrelated predicate acts and the distinct threat of continued racketeering
activities, demonstrating an open-ended conspiracy."
RECONCEIVING COERCION-BASED CRIMINAL DEFENSES (2022) further
elaborates on the relationship requirement, noting that "criminal conduct
forms a pattern if it embraces criminal acts that have the same or similar
purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of commission, or
otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not
isolated events."

Analysis
The Alleged Predicate Acts Constitute "Racketeering
Activity" Under RICO
The first step in determining whether the actions of Myers, Branthoover, and
Wilson constitute a pattern of racketeering activity is to establish that the
alleged acts qualify as "racketeering activity" under the statute.
According to 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1), "racketeering activity" includes acts
indictable under specific federal statutes, including mail fraud (18 U.S.C. §
1341), wire fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343), and extortion (18 U.S.C. § 1951). This is
confirmed by multiple authorities, including RICO: A Primer (2022), which
states that "racketeering activities" include violations of "the Hobbs Act, 18
U.S.C. § 1951 (extortion); 18 U.S.C. § 1341 (mail fraud) and 1343 (wire
fraud)."
The alleged acts in this case clearly fall within these statutory definitions:
Mail Fraud: Myers, Branthoover, and Wilson allegedly used "the U.S.
Mail Service to effectuate service with false statements in legal
documents." Under 18 U.S.C. § 1341, this conduct is prohibited when it
is part of "any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or
property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or
promises."
Wire Fraud: The individuals allegedly used "text messages and
electronic communications to further their schemes." 18 U.S.C. § 1343
prohibits the use of wire communications "for the purpose of executing
such scheme or artifice" to defraud.
Extortion: They allegedly engaged in "threatening Plaintiff with eviction
and other consequences to coerce compliance." Under 18 U.S.C. §
1951, extortion is defined as "the obtaining of property from another,
with his consent, induced by wrongful use of actual or threatened force,
violence, or fear."
As clarified in U.S. v. International Longshoremen's Ass'n, 518 F.Supp.2d 422
(E.D. N.Y. 2007), the essential elements of mail and wire fraud are "(1) a
scheme to defraud, (2) money or property [as the object of the scheme], and
(3) use of the mails [or wires] to further the scheme." Based on the facts
presented, the alleged use of false statements in legal documents sent
through U.S. Mail and the use of electronic communications to further
fraudulent schemes appear to satisfy these elements.
The Alleged Acts Form a "Pattern" Under RICO's Statutory
Definition
Having established that the alleged acts qualify as "racketeering activity,"
the next question is whether they form a "pattern" as defined by the statute
and interpreted by the courts.
1.

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Under 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5), a "'pattern of racketeering activity' requires at
least two acts of racketeering activity, one of which occurred after the
effective date of this chapter and the last of which occurred within ten years
(excluding any period of imprisonment) after the commission of a prior act
of racketeering activity." The facts indicate that Myers, Branthoover, and
Wilson engaged in "multiple predicate acts" from December 2023 through
May 2025, a period of approximately 18 months. This clearly satisfies the
minimum statutory requirement of at least two predicate acts within a ten-
year period.
However, as noted in Heinrich v. Waiting Angels Adoption Servs., Inc., 668 F.
3d 393 (6th Cir. 2012), "while the statute defines the minimum number of
acts necessary to establish a pattern of racketeering activity, the Supreme
Court has held that the minimum two acts are not necessarily sufficient."
The Supreme Court in H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co., 492 U.S.
229 (1989) established that to constitute a "pattern," the predicate acts
must be both (1) related and (2) continuous.
The Alleged Acts Satisfy the "Relationship" Requirement
The "relationship" requirement is satisfied when the predicate acts "have
the same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of
commission, or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics
and are not isolated events," as explained in Wisdom v. First Midwest Bank,
of Poplar Bluff, 167 F.3d 402 (8th Cir. 1999).
In this case, the alleged acts of mail fraud, wire fraud, and extortion appear
to be related as they:
Involve the same participants (Myers, Branthoover, and Wilson)
Target the same victim (the Plaintiff)
Share a similar purpose (to coerce compliance from the Plaintiff)
Employ related methods (use of legal documents with false statements,
electronic communications, and threats)
This conclusion is supported by RECONCEIVING COERCION-BASED
CRIMINAL DEFENSES (2022), which notes that "criminal conduct forms a
pattern if it embraces criminal acts that have the same or similar purposes,
results, participants, victims, or methods of commission, or otherwise are
interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not isolated events."
The Alleged Acts Satisfy the "Continuity" Requirement
The "continuity" requirement can be established in one of two ways: through
"closed-ended continuity" (a series of related predicates extending over a
substantial period) or "open-ended continuity" (a threat of continued
criminal activity), as outlined in H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co.,
492 U.S. 229 (1989).
In this case, the alleged acts occurred "over a period of time, beginning in
December 2023 and continuing through at least May 2025," a period of
approximately 18 months. This timeframe appears sufficient to establish
• 
• 
• 
• 

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
"closed-ended continuity." The Supreme Court in H.J. Inc. indicated that
"Predicate acts extending over a few weeks or months and threatening no
future criminal conduct do not satisfy this requirement," suggesting that a
period of 18 months would be considered "a substantial period of time."
This conclusion is supported by Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations (2022), which explains that a plaintiff can satisfy RICO's
pattern requirement by "alleging a long-running series of interrelated
predicate acts constituting a closed-ended conspiracy."
Even if closed-ended continuity were not established, the facts suggest that
"open-ended continuity" might also be present. The alleged pattern of
conduct extending from December 2023 through May 2025 suggests
ongoing activity that, at the time of the last act, might have posed "a threat
of continuing criminal activity extending indefinitely into the future," as
described in RICO: A Primer (2022).
As noted in Tabas v. Tabas, 47 F.3d 1280 (3rd Cir. 1995), continuity can be
established when the commission of the predicate acts is "a regular way of
conducting defendant's ongoing legitimate business." Though this case was
declined to extend by Yucaipa Am. All. Fund I, LP v. Ehrlich, No. 16-3664
(3rd Cir. Nov 15, 2017), the principle remains valid in assessing continuity. If
the alleged acts were part of a regular pattern of conduct by Myers,
Branthoover, and Wilson, this would further support a finding of continuity.
The Alleged Acts Constitute a "Pattern of Racketeering
Activity" Under RICO
Based on the above analysis, the alleged actions of Myers, Branthoover, and
Wilson appear to constitute a "pattern of racketeering activity" under RICO.
They engaged in multiple predicate acts recognized as "racketeering
activity" under 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1), including mail fraud, wire fraud, and
extortion. These acts occurred over a period of approximately 18 months,
satisfying the statutory requirement of at least two predicate acts within a
ten-year period. Furthermore, the acts appear to be related, sharing similar
participants, victims, purposes, and methods, and demonstrate continuity
through their occurrence over a substantial period.
As summarized in Price v. Rampersad, 22-cv-03131-DG-SJB (E.D. N.Y. Jan 03,
2023), to state a claim under RICO, a plaintiff must allege "(1) that the
defendant (2) through the commission of two or more acts (3) constituting a
'pattern' (4) of 'racketeering activity' (5) directly or indirectly invests in, or
maintains [an] interest in, or participates in (6) an 'enterprise' (7) the
activities of which affect interstate or foreign commerce." The alleged
conduct of Myers, Branthoover, and Wilson satisfies at least elements (2),
(3), and (4) of this test.

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Exceptions and Caveats
While the alleged conduct appears to satisfy the requirements for a "pattern
of racketeering activity," several caveats should be noted:
Specificity of Allegations: As noted in Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy
(2024), "RICO claims based on mail or wire fraud must comport with
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b)'s requirement that allegations
involving fraud be pleaded with particularity." The success of any RICO
claim would depend on the specific details of the alleged fraudulent
statements and schemes.
Enterprise Requirement: A full RICO violation requires not only a
pattern of racketeering activity but also an "enterprise." As explained in 
United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576 (1981), an enterprise is "a
group of persons associated together for a common purpose of
engaging in a course of conduct" and is proved by "evidence of an
ongoing organization, formal or informal, and by evidence that the
various associates function as a continuing unit." Although this case
was abrogated by United States v. Lane, 474 U.S. 438 (1986), the
abrogation did not affect the definition of an enterprise. The facts
provided do not specify whether Myers, Branthoover, and Wilson
constituted an "enterprise" for RICO purposes.
Interstate Commerce: As noted in Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy (2024),
RICO requires that the activities of the enterprise "affect interstate or
foreign commerce." The facts provided do not address this
jurisdictional requirement.
Specific Intent: The predicate acts of mail fraud and wire fraud require
proof of specific intent to defraud. While the facts allege "false
statements in legal documents" and the use of electronic
communications "to further their schemes," a successful RICO claim
would require evidence of fraudulent intent.
Conclusion
Based on the legislative framework, case law, and secondary materials
provided, the alleged actions of Myers, Branthoover, and Wilson constitute a
pattern of racketeering activity under RICO. The conduct involves multiple
predicate acts recognized under 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1), including mail fraud,
wire fraud, and extortion. These acts occurred over an extended period from
December 2023 through May 2025, satisfying the statutory requirement of
at least two predicate acts within a ten-year period.
Furthermore, the alleged acts meet the "relationship" and "continuity"
requirements established by the Supreme Court in H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern
Bell Telephone Co., 492 U.S. 229 (1989). They are related, sharing common
participants, victims, purposes, and methods, and demonstrate continuity
through their occurrence over approximately 18 months, a substantial
period sufficient to establish "closed-ended continuity."

While additional elements would need to be established for a complete RICO
violation—including the existence of an enterprise and an effect on
interstate commerce—the facts presented are sufficient to conclude that the
alleged actions demonstrate a pattern of racketeering activity as defined by 
18 U.S.C. § 1961(5) and interpreted by the courts.
Legal Authorities
Wisdom v. First Midwest Bank, of Poplar Bluff, 167 F.3d 402 (8th Cir. 1999)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Eighth Circuit
Extract
Section 1962(c) of the RICO Act makes it 'unlawful for any person employed
by or associated with any enterprise engaged in ... interstate ... commerce,
to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such
enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.' ... The pattern
element 'requires at least two acts of racketeering activity.' 18 U.S.C. §
1961(5); see also H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229,
237-38, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989). However, a mere allegation
of two or more acts is insufficient to state a RICO claim; the predicate acts
must be related and must 'amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal
activity.' ... The relationship prong of the pattern element is satisfied if the
predicate acts 'have the same or similar purposes, results, participants,
victims, or methods of commission, or otherwise are interrelated by
distinguishing characteristics and are not isolated events.' ... The second
prong, continuity, can be either closed-ended or open-ended. Closed-ended
continuity involves 'a series of related predicates extending over a
substantial period of time;' open-ended continuity involves acts which, by
their nature, threaten repetition into the future.
Summary
Legal framework for understanding how multiple acts of mail fraud, wire
fraud, and extortion could constitute a pattern of racketeering activity if
they are related and continuous.

1987)
U.S. District Court — District of Minnesota
Extract
The RICO act defines 'pattern of racketeering activity' in the following
terms: 'pattern of racketeering activity' requires at least two acts of
racketeering activity, one of which occurred after the effective date of this
chapter and the last of which occurred within ten years (excluding any

period of imprisonment) after... As the Court noted in its November 21 order,
continuity presents a more problematic analysis, both on the facts of this
case and in general. At a minimum, continuity means that plaintiffs must
allege 'more than sporadic or isolated activity.' ... The term pattern 'connotes
a multiplicity of events: ... The continuity inherent in the term presumes
repeated criminal activity, not merely repeated acts to carry out the same
criminal activity.' ... In this respect, ongoing criminal activity or at least a
threat of ongoing criminal activity is a key indicium of continuity.
Summary
Definition of "pattern of racketeering activity" under RICO, requiring at least
two acts of racketeering within a ten-year period. It emphasizes the need for
continuity, which involves more than sporadic or isolated activity, and
suggests that ongoing or threatened ongoing criminal activity is a key
indicator of continuity. This supports the proposition that the repeated acts
of mail fraud, wire fraud, and extortion over an extended period
demonstrate a pattern of racketeering activity.
Heinrich v. Waiting Angels Adoption Servs., Inc., 668 F.3d 393 (6th Cir.
2012)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Sixth Circuit
Extract
To establish a substantive RICO violation, a plaintiff must show “a pattern of
racketeering activity.” 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). A pattern of racketeering activity
requires, at minimum, two acts of racketeering activity within ten years of
each other. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5). While the statute defines the minimum
number of acts necessary to establish a pattern of racketeering activity, the
Supreme Court has held that the minimum two acts are not necessarily
sufficient. In order to show a “pattern” of racketeering activity, a plaintiff
must show “that the racketeering predicates are related, and that they
amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity.” H.J. Inc. v. Nw.
Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 237–39, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989).
Summary
Requirements for establishing a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO,
which includes at least two predicate acts within a ten-year period that are
related and pose a threat of continued criminal activity. This directly
supports the proposition that Myers, Branthoover, and Wilson's actions
could constitute a pattern of racketeering activity if they engaged in
multiple predicate acts like mail fraud, wire fraud, and extortion over an
extended period.

106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989)
U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
Held: 1. In order to prove a pattern of racketeering activity, a plaintiff or
prosecutor must show at least two racketeering predicates that are related
and that amount to, or threaten the likelihood of, continued criminal activity.
Proof of neither relationship nor continuity requires a showing that the
racketeering predicates were committed in furtherance of multiple criminal
schemes. Pp. 236-249. ... 'Continuity' is both a closed- and open-ended
concept, referring either to a closed period of repeated conduct, or to past
conduct that by its nature projects into the future with a threat of
repetition. ... A party alleging a RICO violation may demonstrate continuity
over a closed period by proving a series of related predicates extending over
a substantial period of time. Predicate acts extending over a few weeks or
months and threatening no future criminal conduct do not satisfy this
requirement: Congress was concerned in RICO with long-term criminal
conduct.
Summary
To establish a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO, there must be at
least two related predicate acts that either amount to or pose a threat of
continued criminal activity. The concept of continuity can be demonstrated
through a closed period of repeated conduct or conduct that projects into
the future with a threat of repetition. This aligns with the proposition that
Myers, Branthoover, and Wilson engaged in multiple predicate acts over an
extended period, demonstrating a pattern of racketeering activity.

Extract
RICO takes aim at 'racketeering activity,' which it defines as any act

any of numerous acts 'chargeable' or 'indictable' under enumerated state

Summary
The RICO statute defines racketeering activity to include acts such as mail
and wire fraud. The statute requires at least two acts of racketeering within
a 10-year period to establish a pattern. This aligns with the proposition that
Myers, Branthoover, and Wilson engaged in multiple predicate acts of mail
and wire fraud, which could constitute a pattern of racketeering activity
under RICO.
Tabas v. Tabas, 47 F.3d 1280 (3rd Cir. 1995)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Third Circuit
Extract
Central to the dispute in this case is the question whether defendants
participated in 'a pattern of racketeering activity.' The RICO statute defines
a 'pattern' of racketeering activity as requiring 'at least two acts of
racketeering activity' within a ten year period. 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1961(5)...
From this review, the Court concluded that 'to prove a pattern of
racketeering activity a plaintiff must show that the racketeering predicates
are related, and that they amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal
activity.' Id. at 239, 109 S.Ct. at 2900... The question remains, then, what
more is required in order to evaluate whether continuity has been
established when predicate acts have occurred over a period of several
years. One helpful consideration can be found in the Court's requirements
for open-ended continuity. In H.J. Inc. the Court states that open-ended
continuity is established when the commission of the predicate acts is 'a
regular way of conducting defendant's ongoing legitimate business.' 492
U.S. at 243, 109 S.Ct. at 2902.
Summary
The RICO statute requires at least two acts of racketeering activity within a
ten-year period, and these acts must be related and pose a threat of
continued criminal activity. The passage also discusses the concept of
continuity, which can be established if the predicate acts are a regular way
of conducting the defendant's business. This aligns with the proposition that
Myers, Branthoover, and Wilson engaged in a pattern of racketeering
activity through repeated acts of mail fraud, wire fraud, and extortion over
an extended period.

U.S. Court of Appeals — Second Circuit

=== PAGE 13 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
Two of the RICO counts allege that the fraudulent purchase orders, invoices
and credit memoranda constitute a pattern of racketeering activity, the
predicate acts being separate and numerous violations of the Mail Fraud
Act, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1341 (1982) and the Wire Fraud Act, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1343
(1982)... Section 1964(c) states that anyone 'injured' 'by reason of' a
violation of section 1962 is entitled to treble damages. Section 1962
'violations' include conducting 'enterprises' 'through a pattern of
racketeering'; a 'pattern of racketeering' is defined by section 1961(5) as
two or more 'acts of racketeering' occurring within a given time. 'Acts of
racketeering' are defined by section 1961(1), inter alia, as any of a number
of acts 'chargeable under State law,' acts 'indictable' under a variety of
federal laws, or an 'offense' under the federal securities law.
Summary
The court discusses the requirements for establishing a pattern of
racketeering activity under RICO. It highlights that predicate acts such as
mail fraud and wire fraud can constitute a pattern of racketeering activity if
they occur within a specified time frame. This supports the proposition that
Myers, Branthoover, and Wilson's actions could be considered a pattern of
racketeering activity if they engaged in multiple predicate acts like mail and
wire fraud.
Reynolds v. Condon, 908 F.Supp. 1494 (N.D. W.Va. 1996)
U.S. District Court — Northern District of West Virginia
Extract
Thus, to establish a RICO violation under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) a plaintiff must
demonstrate '(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of
racketeering activity that must include at least two racketeering acts.' ...
The requirements that the acts be related and amount to or pose a threat of
continued criminal activity are also essential. ... If the misconduct has been
sufficiently long-lived, and involved sufficient and sufficiently-related acts to
constitute a pattern of, not just sporadic, criminal conduct, it meets the
requirements of the statute.
Summary
Requirements for establishing a RICO violation, emphasizing the need for a
pattern of racketeering activity that includes at least two acts. It also
highlights the importance of the acts being related and posing a threat of
continued criminal activity. This supports the proposition by providing a
legal framework for demonstrating a pattern of racketeering activity
through multiple predicate acts, such as mail fraud, wire fraud, and
extortion, over an extended period.

F. Supp. 1303 (S.D. N.Y. 1993)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of New York
Extract
To satisfy the 'pattern' requirement of RICO, the government must
demonstrate that each defendant committed at least two acts of
racketeering activity, 'one of which occurred after the effective date of this
chapter October 15, 1970 and the last of which occurred within ten years
(excluding any period of imprisonment) after the commission of a prior act
of racketeering activity.' 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5). The Supreme Court has stated
that a plaintiff alleging a pattern of racketeering activity must demonstrate
(1) that there is a 'relationship' between the predicate acts and (2) that the
predicates themselves amount to, or that they otherwise constitute a threat
of, continuing racketeering activity.
Summary
To establish a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO, it is necessary to
demonstrate at least two predicate acts of racketeering activity within a ten-
year period. Additionally, there must be a relationship between the acts, and
they must pose a threat of continued criminal activity. This aligns with the
proposition that Myers, Branthoover, and Wilson engaged in multiple
predicate acts, including mail fraud, wire fraud, and extortion, over an
extended period, thereby demonstrating a pattern of racketeering activity.

2007)
U.S. District Court — Eastern District of New York
Extract
A substantial number of, the predicate acts alleged in the Amended
Complaint are asserted to be violations of the federal mail and wire fraud
statutes, 18 U.S.C. §§ 1341, 1343. As the Second Circuit has repeatedly
recognized, '[t]he essential elements of a mail [or wire] fraud violation are
(1) a scheme to defraud, (2) money or property [as the object of the
scheme], and (3) use of the mails [or wires] to further the scheme.'
Summary
The essential elements of mail and wire fraud under RICO are a scheme to
defraud, the object being money or property, and the use of mails or wires to
further the scheme. This directly supports the proposition that Myers,

U.S. v. Shifman, 124 F.3d 31 (1st Cir. 1997)
U.S. Court of Appeals — First Circuit
Extract
In order to have engaged in a 'pattern' of racketeering activity, a defendant
must have committed at least two racketeering acts within ten years of one
another. See 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5). These acts must be related and 'amount to
or pose a threat of continued criminal activity.' H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell
Telephone Co., 492 U.S. 229, 239, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 2900, 106 L.Ed.2d 195
(1989).
Summary
To establish a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO, there must be at
least two related acts of racketeering within a ten-year period that pose a
threat of continued criminal activity. This aligns with the proposition that
Myers, Branthoover, and Wilson engaged in multiple predicate acts over an
extended period, demonstrating a pattern of racketeering activity.
United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 101 S.Ct. 2524, 69 L.Ed.2d 246
(1981)
U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
In order to secure a conviction under RICO, the Government must prove
both the existence of an 'enterprise' and the connected 'pattern of
racketeering activity.' The enterprise is an entity, for present purposes a
group of persons associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a
course of conduct. The pattern of racketeering activity is, on the other hand,
a series of criminal acts as defined by the statute. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1) (1976
ed., Supp. III). The former is proved by evidence of an ongoing organization,
formal or informal, and by evidence that the various associates function as a
continuing unit. The latter is proved by evidence of the requisite number of
acts of racketeering committed by the participants in the enterprise.
Summary
To establish a RICO violation, there must be proof of both an "enterprise"
and a "pattern of racketeering activity." The enterprise can be a group of
individuals associated for a common purpose, and the pattern of
racketeering activity involves a series of criminal acts. This supports the

=== PAGE 16 ===

proposition by indicating that Myers, Branthoover, and Wilson's actions
could constitute a RICO violation if they formed an enterprise and engaged
in a pattern of racketeering activity, such as mail fraud, wire fraud, and
extortion.

Co., 473 U.S. 479, 105 S.Ct. 3275, 3285, 87 L.Ed.2d 346 (1985). RICO
defines racketeering activity as, inter alia, any act that is indictable under
18 U.S.C. Sec. 1341 (mail fraud) or 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1343 (wire fraud). See 18
U.S.C. Sec. 1961(1)(B). RICO also states that a 'pattern of racketeering
activity' requires at least two acts of racketeering activity.
Summary
A RICO violation requires conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of
racketeering activity, which includes acts such as mail and wire fraud. The
passage confirms that these acts are considered racketeering activities
under RICO, and a pattern requires at least two such acts. This aligns with
the proposition that Myers, Branthoover, and Wilson engaged in multiple
predicate acts of mail and wire fraud, which could constitute a pattern of
racketeering activity.

racketeering activity.' 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). 'Racketeering activity' includes
any of several listed crimes 'which is chargeable under State law and
punishable by imprisonment for more than one year,' as well as any act
chargeable under one of several enumerated federal statutes. § 1961(1). A
'pattern of racketeering activity' requires at least two acts of racketeering

Extract
Finally, in H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co.,(35) the Supreme
Court made an express decision not to limit RICO strictly to organized
crime.(36) ... The Court rejected a narrow reading of the phrase 'pattern of
racketeering activity,' holding that it does not require proof of 'multiple
illegal schemes'(39) or that the predicate acts be 'indicative of an organized
crime perpetrator.'(40) Instead, the Court settled on a broad meaning for
'pattern of racketeering' that requires a 'plaintiff or prosecutor [merely to]
prove [a] continuity of racketeering activity, or its threat, simpliciter.'(41)
Summary
The Supreme Court has interpreted RICO broadly, not limiting it to
organized crime or requiring multiple illegal schemes. The Court
emphasized that a pattern of racketeering activity can be established by
showing continuity or the threat of such activity. This supports the
proposition that the repeated acts of mail fraud, wire fraud, and extortion by
Myers, Branthoover, and Wilson over an extended period can demonstrate a
pattern of racketeering activity under RICO.

The raw number of mail or wire fraud violations may not reflect accurately
the extent of deceptive conduct. Under §§ 1341 and 1343, each mailing and
interstate wire communication is a separate offense, even if each relates to
the same scheme to defraud... The existence of a multiplicity of predicate
acts consisting of mail and wire fraud may be no indication of the requisite
continuity of the underlying fraudulent activity... ‘pattern of racketeering
activity’ requires at least two acts of racketeering activity... the continuity
requirement, according to Sedima, consists of a ‘threat of continuing
activity.’

American Criminal Law Review - Georgetown University Law Center -
Allison, Bridget - 1998-03-22
Extract
The first element of RICO requires two or more predicate acts of
'racketeering activity.' RICO defendants need not be convicted of each
'racketeering activity' before a substantive RICO offense is charged. Under
[sections] 1961(1), the term 'racketeering activity' includes a broad
assortment of state and federal crimes... The Supreme Court made a second
attempt to clarify the 'pattern' concept in H.J., Inc. v. Northwestern Bell
Telephone Co. In that case, the Court held that when proving a 'pattern of
racketeering activity,' RICO requires both relationship and continuity of
predicate acts as separate elements. However, the Court recognized that
proof of these factors will often overlap. The relationship prong is defined by
the connection of the defendant's criminal acts to one another: 'continuity' is
successfully proved if a prosecutor can show actual continuity during a past,
closed period of repeated conduct or an open-ended threat of continued
racketeering activity in the future.
Summary
Requirements for establishing a "pattern of racketeering activity" under
RICO, which includes committing at least two predicate acts of racketeering
activity. It also emphasizes the need for these acts to be related and to
demonstrate continuity, either through repeated conduct over a closed
period or an ongoing threat of future criminal activity. This directly supports
the proposition that Myers, Branthoover, and Wilson's actions could
constitute a pattern of racketeering activity if they engaged in multiple
related predicate acts over an extended period.

The predicate acts of mail fraud, wire fraud, and extortion are recognized
under federal law as potential RICO violations. The passage also confirms
the requirement of at least two related predicate acts within a ten-year
period that amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity, as
established in H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co. This aligns with

RICO applies only where the commission of two predicate acts constitutes a
'pattern of racketeering activity.' (48) While the statutory definition of
'pattern of racketeering activity' requires at least two acts of racketeering
that occur within ten years of each other, (49) proof of such acts, without
more, may not suffice to establish a RICO violation. (50) There must also be
proof that the predicate acts are continuous and interrelated. (51) Thus, 'two
isolated acts of racketeering do not constitute a pattern.' (52) In H.J. Inc. v.

must establish both a relationship between the predicate acts and continuity
of those acts to prove a 'pattern of racketeering activity' for RICO purposes.

A 'pattern of racketeering activity' also requires evidence that the predicate
acts are continuous and interrelated, rather than isolated and sporadic. A
plaintiff can satisfy RICO’s pattern requirement two ways: (1) by alleging a
long-running series of interrelated predicate acts constituting a closed-
ended conspiracy; or (2) by alleging at least two interrelated predicate acts
and the distinct threat of continued racketeering activities, demonstrating
an open-ended conspiracy.
Summary
To establish a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO, there must be at
least two predicate acts that are continuous and interrelated. The passage
provides two ways to satisfy this requirement: through a closed-ended
conspiracy with a long-running series of interrelated acts or an open-ended
conspiracy with at least two interrelated acts and a threat of continued
activity. This directly supports the proposition that the actions of Myers,
Branthoover, and Wilson, if proven to be continuous and interrelated, could
constitute a pattern of racketeering activity.

Summary
The definition of a "pattern of racketeering activity" under RICO requires at
least two predicate acts within a ten-year period. These acts must be
continuous and interrelated, which aligns with the proposition that Myers,
Branthoover, and Wilson engaged in multiple predicate acts over an
extended period. The passage also explains the concept of closed-ended and
open-ended conspiracies, which supports the argument that the acts in
question demonstrate a pattern of racketeering activity.
Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy
The Brief - American Bar Association - 2024-01-01
Extract
A violation of § 1962(c), the section on which Sedima relies, requires (1)
conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity. The plaintiff must allege each of the elements to state a claim. They
are all equally essential components, and the complaint will fail if any one of
them is not adequately pleaded. In particular, RICO claims based on mail or
wire fraud must comport with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b)’s
requirement that allegations involving fraud be pleaded with particularity.
The practitioner through their pleadings must articulate with great care and
attention a viable racketeering claim. In addition, § 1962(a), (b), and (c) are
limited in scope to conduct involving enterprises engaged in or the activities
of which affect interstate commerce. It is the activities of the enterprise, not
each predicate act, that must affect interstate or foreign commerce. RICO
requires no more than a slight effect upon interstate commerce. Even a
minimal effect on interstate commerce satisfies this jurisdictional
requirement.
Summary
Essential elements required to establish a RICO claim under § 1962(c),
which includes conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering
activity. It emphasizes the need for particularity in pleading fraud-related
RICO claims, aligning with the proposition's assertion of mail and wire
fraud. The passage also notes the requirement for the enterprise's activities
to affect interstate commerce, which is a jurisdictional requirement for RICO
claims. This supports the proposition by providing a legal framework for
establishing a pattern of racketeering activity involving mail and wire fraud.

Extract
The inquiry here is meant to invoke the 'pattern of racketeering activity'
element of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).
The Organized Crime Control Act (1970), which includes RICO, provides that
'criminal conduct forms a pattern if it embraces criminal acts that have the
same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of
commission, or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics
and are not isolated events.' The Supreme Court characterized this
requirement as a 'relationship' element and held that the statute further
requires a 'continuity' element, 'referring either to a closed period of
repeated conduct, or to past conduct that by its nature projects into the
future with a threat of repetition.'
Summary
Detailed explanation of what constitutes a "pattern of racketeering activity"
under RICO. It highlights the need for criminal acts to have similar
purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of commission, and to be
interrelated by distinguishing characteristics. Additionally, it emphasizes the
requirement of a "continuity" element, which can be demonstrated by
repeated conduct over a closed period or conduct that poses a threat of
future repetition. This directly supports the proposition that the repeated
acts of mail fraud, wire fraud, and extortion by Myers, Branthoover, and
Wilson over an extended period demonstrate a pattern of racketeering
activity.
RICO: A Primer
Extract
Among other things, 'racketeering activities' include 'any act which is
indictable under' a list of federal criminal statutes. The list covers an
expansive range of violations, for example, violations of the Hobbs Act, 18
U.S.C. ' 1951 (extortion); 18 U.S.C. ' 1341 (mail fraud) and 1343 (wire
fraud)... Mail and wire fraud are the most common predicate acts... A
'pattern' may exist where any combination of two or more offenses occurred
within a period of time... The racketeering acts need not be similar or
directly related to each other; rather, it is sufficient that the racketeering
acts are related in some way to the affairs of the charged enterprise... A
plaintiff may demonstrate a pattern by establishment that the predicate acts
pose a threat of continued criminal activity, which is generally demonstrated
by showing either: * Closed-ended continuity. Proving 'a series of related
predicate acts extending over a substantial period of time.' * Open-ended
continuity. A threat of 'continuing criminal activity extending indefinitely
into the future,' in light of the nature of the enterprise and predicate acts
alleged.

Summary
The passage outlines that mail fraud, wire fraud, and extortion are
recognized as predicate acts under RICO. It also explains the concept of a
"pattern of racketeering activity," which requires at least two predicate acts
that are related and pose a threat of continued criminal activity. The passage
further clarifies that the acts need not be similar but must be related to the
enterprise's affairs. This supports the proposition that the repeated acts of
mail fraud, wire fraud, and extortion by Myers, Branthoover, and Wilson
over an extended period demonstrate a pattern of racketeering activity
under RICO.

Summary
The passage outlines that racketeering activities under RICO include mail
fraud, wire fraud, and extortion, which are the predicate acts alleged in the
proposition. It also explains the concept of a "pattern of racketeering
activity," which requires at least two predicate acts that are related and pose
a threat of continued criminal activity. The passage further clarifies that the
acts need not be similar but must be related to the enterprise's affairs, and
continuity can be demonstrated through closed-ended or open-ended
continuity. This directly supports the proposition that the alleged acts by
Myers, Branthoover, and Wilson constitute a pattern of racketeering activity
under RICO.
