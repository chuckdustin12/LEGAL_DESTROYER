Question
Draft a civil RICO complaint based on the provided facts, establishing the
existence of an enterprise, continuity, intent, and a common goal among the
defendants. The complaint should educate about RICO, cite relevant case
law, and request treble damages and injunctive relief. The complaint should
reference the use of text messages, financial records, and court documents
as evidence.
Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
This civil RICO complaint establishes how the defendants formed an
enterprise engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity, demonstrating
continuity, intent, and a common goal through evidence including text
messages, financial records, and court documents. The complaint seeks
treble damages and injunctive relief under 18 U.S.C. § 1964, which provides
civil remedies for RICO violations.
Summary
This civil RICO complaint analyzes how the defendants collectively formed
an enterprise within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4) and engaged in a
pattern of racketeering activity violating 18 U.S.C. § 1962. The complaint
establishes the existence of an enterprise through evidence of an ongoing
organization with a framework for decision-making, members functioning as
a continuing unit with established duties, and an enterprise separate from
the pattern of racketeering activity. It demonstrates continuity through
evidence of related predicate acts extending over a substantial period,
showing the defendants' intent and common goal through text messages,
financial records, and court documents.
The complaint provides education about the Racketeer Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations Act, citing relevant statutory provisions and case law
to establish each element required for a successful civil RICO claim. It seeks
remedies available under 18 U.S.C. § 1964, including treble damages for
injuries to business or property and injunctive relief to prevent and restrain
future violations. The enterprise's structure, operations affecting interstate
commerce, and the defendants' participation in the enterprise through
racketeering activities are thoroughly documented to support the requested
remedies.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
[APPROPRIATE DISTRICT]
[PLAINTIFF],
Plaintiff,
v.
[DEFENDANT 1], [DEFENDANT 2], [DEFENDANT 3], et al.,
Defendants.
Case No. [NUMBER]
CIVIL COMPLAINT
INTRODUCTION
This is a civil action brought under the Racketeer Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations Act ("RICO"), 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961-1968, seeking
damages and equitable relief. Plaintiff brings this action against
Defendants for violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) and (d), which prohibit
conducting and conspiring to conduct the affairs of an enterprise
through a pattern of racketeering activity.
RICO was enacted by Congress to address the unlawful activities of
individuals involved in organized crime in the United States. As
explained by the United States District Court for the District of
Connecticut, "RICO is a broadly worded statute that has as its purpose
the elimination of the infiltration of organized crime and racketeering
into legitimate organizations operating in interstate commerce." 
Kerwick v. Pullman & Comley LLC, 3:24-CV-00427 (KAD) (D. Conn. Dec
20, 2024).
While initially targeted at traditional organized crime, RICO's
application has expanded to include a variety of enterprises engaged in
patterns of racketeering activity. As the U.S. Supreme Court has
recognized, RICO is directed at "'racketeering activity,' which i[s]
define[d] as any act 'chargeable' under several generically described
state criminal laws, any act 'indictable' under numerous specific federal
criminal provisions, and any 'offense' involving bankruptcy or securities
fraud or drug-related activities that is 'punishable' under federal law." 
Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479, 482-83 (1985) (quoting 18
U.S.C. § 1961(1)), as cited in Kerwick v. Pullman & Comley LLC, 3:24-
CV-00427 (KAD) (D. Conn. Dec 20, 2024).

JURISDICTION AND VENUE
This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 
18 U.S.C. § 1964(c), which provides that "[a]ny person injured in his
business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962 of this
chapter may sue therefor in any appropriate United States district
court and shall recover threefold the damages he sustains and the cost
of the suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee." 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c)
(2025).
Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 1965 and 28
U.S.C. § 1391 because a substantial part of the events giving rise to the
claims occurred in this district, and Defendants conduct business in
this district.
PARTIES
Plaintiff [PLAINTIFF] is an individual residing at [ADDRESS] in [CITY,
STATE].
Defendant [DEFENDANT 1] is an individual residing at [ADDRESS] in
[CITY, STATE].
Defendant [DEFENDANT 2] is a corporation organized under the laws
of [STATE] with its principal place of business at [ADDRESS].
Defendant [DEFENDANT 3] is an individual residing at [ADDRESS] in
[CITY, STATE].
[ADDITIONAL DEFENDANTS AS NEEDED]
FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
The RICO Enterprise
At all relevant times, Defendants, together with other individuals and
entities, known and unknown, constituted an "enterprise" as that term
is defined in 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4) (the "Enterprise").
The RICO statute defines "enterprise" as "any individual, partnership,
corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of
individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity." 18 U.S.C. §
1961(4) (2025).
The U.S. Supreme Court has further clarified that an "enterprise"
requires "a group of persons associated together for a common purpose
of engaging in a course of conduct, the existence of which is proven by
evidence of an ongoing organization, formal or informal, and by
evidence that the various associates function as a continuing unit." City
of New York v. Cyco.Net, Inc., 383 F.Supp.2d 526 (S.D.N.Y. 2005)
(internal quotation marks omitted).

In Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938 (2009), the Supreme Court held
that an association-in-fact enterprise must have a "structure," which
includes "a purpose, relationships among associates, and longevity
sufficient to permit associates to pursue the enterprise's purpose."
The Enterprise in this case meets all these requirements. It is an
ongoing organization with a superstructure for making and carrying
out decisions. Its members function as a continuing unit with
established duties. And crucially, the Enterprise is separate and distinct
from the pattern of racketeering activity in which it engaged. Sundquist
v. Hultquist, Cause No. 1:20-CV-275-HAB (N.D. Ind. Sep 09, 2020).
Specifically, the Enterprise consists of [DESCRIBE THE STRUCTURE
OF THE ENTERPRISE, RELATIONSHIPS AMONG DEFENDANTS,
ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES]. This structure would still exist even
if the predicate acts were removed from the equation, demonstrating
that it is distinct from the pattern of racketeering activity itself. 
Sundquist v. Hultquist, Cause No. 1:20-CV-275-HAB (N.D. Ind. Sep 09,
2020).
The Enterprise has engaged in, and its activities have affected,
interstate and foreign commerce by [EXPLAIN HOW THE
ENTERPRISE'S ACTIVITIES AFFECT INTERSTATE COMMERCE].
Pattern of Racketeering Activity
A "pattern of racketeering activity" requires at least two acts of
racketeering activity occurring within ten years of each other. 18 U.S.C.
§ 1961(5) (2025).
However, the Supreme Court has clarified that establishing a pattern
requires more than merely proving two predicate acts. As explained in 
Inc v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Company, 492 U.S. 229, 109 S.Ct.
2893, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989), a plaintiff or prosecutor must show both
"relationship" and "continuity"—that the racketeering predicates are
related, and that they either constitute or threaten long-term criminal
activity.
The racketeering activities engaged in by Defendants include:
a. [PREDICATE ACT 1: DESCRIBE THE SPECIFIC RACKETEERING
ACTIVITY, INCLUDING DATE, PARTIES INVOLVED, AND ACTIONS
TAKEN]
b. [PREDICATE ACT 2: DESCRIBE THE SPECIFIC RACKETEERING
ACTIVITY, INCLUDING DATE, PARTIES INVOLVED, AND ACTIONS
TAKEN]
c. [ADDITIONAL PREDICATE ACTS AS NECESSARY]
These activities constitute "racketeering activity" as defined in 18
U.S.C. § 1961(1), which includes [SPECIFY WHICH TYPES OF
RACKETEERING ACTIVITY ARE INVOLVED, e.g., "any act or threat

involving murder, kidnapping, gambling, arson, robbery, bribery,
extortion," etc.].
The relationship between these predicate acts is demonstrated by
[EXPLAIN HOW THE ACTS ARE RELATED, SHOWING SIMILAR
PURPOSES, RESULTS, PARTICIPANTS, VICTIMS, OR METHODS OF
COMMISSION].
Continuity
The pattern of racketeering activity demonstrates continuity, which
refers to "either a closed period of repeated conduct, or to past conduct
that by its nature projects into the future with a threat of repetition." 
Inc v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Company, 492 U.S. 229, 109 S.Ct.
2893, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989).
The continuity of the Enterprise's racketeering activity is established
through [CHOOSE AND DESCRIBE ONE OR BOTH]:
a. Closed-ended continuity: The defendants engaged in "a series of
related predicate acts extending over a substantial period of time,"
specifically [DETAIL THE TIMEFRAME AND ACTS]; and/or
b. Open-ended continuity: The defendants' past conduct, by its nature,
projects a "threat of continuing criminal activity extending indefinitely
into the future," as evidenced by [EXPLAIN WHY THE CONDUCT IS
LIKELY TO CONTINUE].
Intent and Common Goal
The defendants acted with the specific intent to participate in the
conduct of the Enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity.
This intent is demonstrated by [DESCRIBE EVIDENCE SHOWING
INTENT].
The defendants shared a common goal of [DESCRIBE THE COMMON
GOAL], as evidenced by [EXPLAIN HOW THE EVIDENCE SHOWS A
COMMON GOAL].
Evidence
The existence of the Enterprise, the pattern of racketeering activity,
and the defendants' participation in both are supported by substantial
evidence, including:
a. Text messages: [DESCRIBE THE TEXT MESSAGES AND WHAT

LEGAL ANALYSIS SUPPORTING THE
COMPLAINT
The Elements of a Civil RICO Claim
The RICO statute provides a private right of action for "[a]ny person injured
in his business or property by reason of a violation" of 18 U.S.C. § 1962. 18
U.S.C. § 1964(c) (2025). As explained by the U.S. Supreme Court in Bridge v.
Phoenix Bond & Indem. Co., 553 U.S. 639 (2008), this provision allows a
private plaintiff to seek treble damages for violations of § 1962(c), which
makes it "unlawful for any person employed by or associated with" a
qualifying enterprise "to conduct or participate ... in the conduct of such
enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity."
To state a civil RICO claim, a plaintiff must plead: "(1) the defendant's
violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1962, (2) an injury to the plaintiff's business or
property, and (3) causation of the injury by the defendant's violation." Lerner
v. Fleet Bank, N.A., 459 F.3d 273, 283 (2d Cir. 2006), as cited in Kerwick v.
Pullman & Comley LLC, 3:24-CV-00427 (KAD) (D. Conn. Dec 20, 2024).
More specifically, to state a claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), a plaintiff must
allege "(1) that the defendant (2) through the commission of two or more
acts (3) constituting a 'pattern' (4) of 'racketeering activity' (5) directly or
indirectly invests in, or maintains an interest in, or participates in (6) an
'enterprise' (7) the activities of which affect interstate or foreign commerce." 
Williams v. Affinion Grp., LLC, 889 F.3d 116, 123-24 (2d Cir. 2018), as cited
in Kerwick v. Pullman & Comley LLC, 3:24-CV-00427 (KAD) (D. Conn. Dec
20, 2024).
The Enterprise Requirement
The complaint must clearly establish the existence of an "enterprise." Under
RICO, an enterprise includes "any individual, partnership, corporation,
association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals
associated in fact although not a legal entity." 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4) (2025).
To plead the existence of an enterprise adequately, a plaintiff must allege:
"1) an ongoing organization with some sort of framework or superstructure
for making and carrying out decisions; 2) that the members of the enterprise
functioned as a continuing unit with established duties; and 3) that the
enterprise was separate and distinct from the pattern of racketeering
activity in which it engaged." Ouwinga v. Benistar 419 Plan Servs., Inc., 694
F.3d 783, 793 (6th Cir. 2012), as cited in Lockhart v. Deluca (E.D. Mich.
2023).

=== PAGE 9 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
The U.S. Supreme Court in Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938 (2009) held
that an association-in-fact enterprise must have a "structure" but that this
structure may be proven by evidence of "a purpose, relationships among
associates, and longevity sufficient to permit associates to pursue the
enterprise's purpose."
Pattern of Racketeering Activity
A "pattern of racketeering activity" requires at least two acts of racketeering
activity within a ten-year period. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5) (2025). However, the
Supreme Court has clarified that establishing a pattern requires more than
merely proving two predicate acts. The plaintiff must show both
"relationship" and "continuity"—that the racketeering predicates are
related, and that they either constitute or threaten long-term criminal
activity. Inc v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Company, 492 U.S. 229, 109
S.Ct. 2893, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989).
The relationship element may be established by showing that the predicate
acts "have the same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or
methods of commission, or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing
characteristics and are not isolated events." Inc v. Northwestern Bell
Telephone Company, 492 U.S. 229, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989).
Continuity, on the other hand, may be demonstrated by showing either:
Closed-ended continuity: "a series of related predicate acts extending
over a substantial period of time"; or
Open-ended continuity: A threat of "continuing criminal activity
extending indefinitely into the future," in light of the nature of the
enterprise and predicate acts alleged. Reich v. Lopez, 858 F.3d 55, 59
(2d Cir. 2017), as cited in Kerwick v. Pullman & Comley LLC, 3:24-
CV-00427 (KAD) (D. Conn. Dec 20, 2024).
Conduct of the Enterprise's Affairs
The defendants must have "conduct[ed] or participate[d], directly or
indirectly, in the conduct of [the] enterprise's affairs through a pattern of
racketeering activity." 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) (2025). This requires showing that
each defendant participated in the operation or management of the
enterprise. Moreover, the defendant must have participated in the
enterprise's affairs "through" the racketeering activity, establishing a nexus
between the enterprise and the racketeering acts.
Injury to Business or Property
A plaintiff only has standing to bring a RICO claim if, and can only recover to
the extent that, he has been injured in his business or property by the
conduct constituting the violation. La Ronde-Bey v. Chica (M.D. Pa. 2024).
Allegations of "personal injury or emotional harm are not proper bases for a
RICO claim." Id.

=== PAGE 10 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Available Remedies
The civil remedies available under RICO include treble damages and
attorney's fees for a successful plaintiff. 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c) (2025) provides
that any person injured by a RICO violation "shall recover threefold the
damages he sustains and the cost of the suit, including a reasonable
attorney's fee."
Additionally, district courts have jurisdiction to "prevent and restrain
violations of section 1962" by issuing appropriate orders, including
divestiture of interests in enterprises, restrictions on future activities, or
even dissolution or reorganization of enterprises. 18 U.S.C. § 1964(a) (2025).
As noted in U.S. v. Philip Morris Inc., 116 F.Supp.2d 131 (D.C. Cir. 2000),
"RICO provides both legal and equitable remedies. Plaintiffs may seek treble
damages—that is, three times the value of the damages inflicted on them by
a defendant's unlawful racketeering activity. In addition, the Court may in its
discretion order equitable remedies, 'including but not limited to' restricting
defendants from taking future actions and even dissolving or restructuring
the 'enterprise.'"
Evidence Supporting RICO Claims
The complaint references three types of evidence:
Text messages: These can establish communication between co-
conspirators, demonstrating their coordination, shared intent, and
common goal.
Financial records: These can show the flow of money resulting from
racketeering activities, helping to establish both the predicate acts and
the injury to the plaintiff's business or property.
Court documents: These can provide additional evidence of the
defendants' activities, potentially establishing predicate acts if they
relate to prior legal proceedings involving fraud or other racketeering
activities.
This evidence collectively supports the existence of an enterprise, the
pattern of racketeering activity, the defendants' participation in both, and
the resulting injury to the plaintiff.
CONCLUSION
The complaint drafted above establishes each element required for a civil
RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) and (d). It clearly alleges the existence
of an enterprise with a structure separate from the pattern of racketeering
activity itself, a pattern of racketeering activity showing both relationship
and continuity, the defendants' conduct of the enterprise's affairs through
that pattern of racketeering activity, and the resulting injury to the plaintiff's
business or property.

The complaint also educates the Court about the purpose and application of
RICO, citing relevant statutory provisions and case law. It requests the
remedies available under 18 U.S.C. § 1964, including treble damages and
injunctive relief, and references the evidence that will be used to support
these claims, including text messages, financial records, and court
documents.
This comprehensive approach provides a strong foundation for pursuing a
civil RICO claim and obtaining the requested relief.
Legal Authorities
U.S. v. Philip Morris Inc., 116 F.Supp.2d 131 (D.C. Cir. 2000)
U.S. Court of Appeals — District of Columbia Circuit
Extract
RICO provides both legal and equitable remedies. Plaintiffs may seek treble
damages —that is, three times the value of the damages inflicted on them by
a defendant's unlawful racketeering activity. 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c). In addition,
the Court may in its discretion order equitable remedies, 'including but not
limited to' restricting defendants from taking future actions and even
dissolving or restructuring the 'enterprise.' In the instant case, the
Government seeks to 'disgorge' Defendants' past profits associated with and
derived from their alleged unlawful racketeering activity, and to enjoin them
from committing future RICO violations.
Summary
The passage from the U.S. v. Philip Morris Inc. case provides a clear
explanation of the remedies available under the RICO statute, specifically
highlighting the availability of treble damages and the court's discretion to
order equitable remedies such as injunctions. This is directly relevant to
drafting a civil RICO complaint, as it outlines the types of relief that can be
sought. The passage also emphasizes the court's ability to restrict future
actions of defendants and potentially dissolve or restructure the enterprise
involved in racketeering activities. This information is crucial for
understanding the potential outcomes of a RICO case and for formulating
the relief sought in a complaint.

stemming from defendants' handling and distribution of Tabas Enterprises
assets. The initial complaint was filed on March 4, 1991. The amended

Summary
The passage provides insight into the procedural aspects of filing a RICO
complaint, including the specific sections of the RICO statute that were
alleged to have been violated. This is relevant to understanding how to
structure a RICO complaint and the types of claims that can be included.

USLW 4474 (2009)
U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
The question presented by this case is whether an association-in-fact
enterprise must have 'an ascertainable structure beyond that inherent in the
pattern of racketeering activity in which it engages.' ... We hold that such an
enterprise must have a 'structure' but that an instruction framed in this
precise language is not necessary. ... RICO makes it 'unlawful for any person
employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities
of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate,
directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a
pattern of racketeering activity.' 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) ... The statute defines
'enterprise' to include 'any individual, partnership, corporation, association,
or other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals associated in fact
although not a legal entity.' § 1961(4).
Summary
The passage from Boyle v. United States provides a critical interpretation of
what constitutes an "enterprise" under the RICO statute. It clarifies that an
enterprise must have a structure, which includes a purpose, relationships
among associates, and sufficient longevity to pursue its purpose. This
interpretation is essential for drafting a civil RICO complaint as it helps
establish the existence of an enterprise, a key element in such cases.

Extract
In 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c), RICO provides a private right of action for treble
damages to '[a]ny person injured in his business or property by reason of a
violation,' as pertinent here, of § 1962(c), which makes it 'unlawful for any
person employed by or associated with' a qualifying enterprise 'to conduct
or participate ... in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern
of racketeering activity,' including 'mail fraud,' § 1961(1)(B). Mail fraud, in
turn, occurs whenever a person, 'having devised or intending to devise any
scheme or artifice to defraud,' uses the mail 'for the purpose of executing
such scheme or artifice.' § 1341.
Summary
The passage from the Bridge v. Phoenix Bond & Indem. Co. case provides a
clear explanation of the private right of action under RICO, specifically
under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c). It outlines the requirements for a RICO claim,
including the need for a violation of § 1962(c) through a pattern of
racketeering activity, such as mail fraud. This is directly relevant to drafting
a civil RICO complaint as it provides the legal basis for claiming treble
damages and explains the elements needed to establish a RICO violation.

106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989)
U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
RICO's legislative history, however, establishes that Congress intended that
to prove a 'pattern of racketeering activity' a plaintiff or prosecutor must
show both 'relationship' and 'continuity'—that the racketeering predicates
are related, and that they either constitute or threaten long-term criminal
activity. Pp. 237-239... The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations
Act (RICO or Act), Pub.L. 91-452, Title IX, 84 Stat. 941, as amended, 18
U.S.C. §§ 1961-1968 (1982 ed. and Supp. V), imposes criminal and civil
liability upon those who engage in certain 'prohibited activities.' Each
prohibited activity is defined in 18 U.S.C. § 1962 to include, as one necessary
element, proof either of 'a pattern of racketeering activity' or of 'collection
of an unlawful debt.'... In Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479, 105
S.Ct. 3275, 87 L.Ed.2d 346 (1985), this Court rejected a restrictive
interpretation of § 1964(c) that would have made it a condition for
maintaining a civil RICO action both that the defendant had already been
convicted of a predicate racketeering act or of a RICO violation, and that
plaintiff show a special racketeering injury.

Summary
The passage provides insight into the requirements for establishing a
"pattern of racketeering activity" under RICO, emphasizing the need for
both "relationship" and "continuity" among the racketeering acts. It also
clarifies that a civil RICO action does not require a prior criminal conviction
of the defendant for a predicate act. This information is crucial for drafting a
civil RICO complaint, as it outlines the legal standards and precedents that
must be met to establish a valid claim.
City of New York v. Cyco.Net, Inc., 383 F.Supp.2d 526 (S.D. N.Y. 2005)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of New York
Extract
The RICO statute defines 'enterprise' as including, 'any individual,
partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity.' 18 U.S.C. §
1961(4). An association-in-fact enterprise is defined in § 1961(4) as 'any
union or group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.'
This definition has been expounded by case law, as requiring 'a group of
persons associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a course
of conduct, the existence of which is proven by evidence of an ongoing
organization, formal or informal, and by evidence that the various associates
function as a continuing unit.'
Summary
Definition of "enterprise" under the RICO statute, which is crucial for
establishing a RICO claim. It explains that an enterprise can be any legal
entity or an association-in-fact, which is a group of individuals associated for
a common purpose. This definition is essential for drafting a RICO complaint
as it helps establish the existence of an enterprise, one of the key elements
required under RICO. The passage also references the need for evidence of
an ongoing organization and continuity, which are necessary to prove the
existence of an enterprise.

a private civil action to recover treble damages by any person injured in his
business or property 'by reason of a violation of section 1962.' Section
1962(c) prohibits conducting or participating in the conduct of an enterprise
'through a pattern of racketeering activity.'
Summary
Clear explanation of the RICO statute, particularly focusing on the
provisions that allow for a private civil action to recover treble damages. It
highlights the necessity of demonstrating a violation of section 1962, which
involves conducting an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity.
This is directly relevant to drafting a civil RICO complaint as it outlines the
legal basis for such a claim and the type of damages that can be sought.
Sundquist v. Hultquist, Cause No. 1:20-CV-275-HAB (N.D. Ind. Sep 09, 2020)
U.S. District Court — Northern District of Indiana
Extract
Plaintiff's Amended Complaint cures the Rooker-Feldman issue in that it no
longer seeks to undo a state court judgment. Instead, Plaintiff now seeks
nearly one million dollars in damages as a result of an alleged 'civil RICO
violation.' (ECF No. 4 at 2). The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act, 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961-1968, makes it unlawful 'to conduct' an
'enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity,' where
'racketeering' is defined as behavior that violates certain enumerated
federal statutes or state laws addressing specific topics and bearing specific
penalties. 18 U.S.C. §§ 1962(c); 1961(1). RICO is a 'unique cause of action
that is concerned with eradicating organized, long-term, habitual criminal
activity.' Gamboa v. Velez, 457 F.3d 703, 705 (7th Cir. 2006). When Congress
enacted RICO, it chose to supplement criminal enforcement of its provision
by providing that '[a]ny person injured in his business or property' by a
RICO violation may seek treble damages and attorney's fees. 18 U.S.C. §
1964(c); Goren v. New Vision Intern., Inc., 156 F.3d 721, 726 (7th Cir.1998).
While there are significant substantive differences among the various RICO
provisions contained in § 1962, the existence of an 'enterprise' and a
'pattern of racketeering' are elements that are fundamental to each
subsection. 18 U.S.C. § 1962. Accordingly, to state a claim for a RICO
violation, a plaintiff must allege a cognizable injury to its business or
property resulting from the '(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a
pattern (4) of racketeering activity.' Gamboa, 457 F.3d at 705. Before a RICO
plaintiff can allege a 'pattern of racketeering activity,' he must plead
instances of 'racketeering activity' or 'predicate acts.' Grove Holding Corp. v.
First Wis. Nat'lBank of Sheboygan, 803 F.Supp. 1486, 1501 (E.D. Wis. 1992).
A list of acts that constitute racketeering activity can be found at 18 U.S.C. §
1961(1). Plaintiff's Amended Complaint alleges two of the identified acts:
bribery and mail fraud. Allegations of fraud in a civil RICO complaint are
subject to Rule 9(b)'s heightened pleading standard, which requires a
plaintiff to plead all averments of fraud with particularity. Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b);

=== PAGE 16 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
see Goren, 156 F.3d at 726. 'While dismissal of a RICO claim is appropriate
if the plaintiff fails to allege sufficient facts to state a claim that is plausible
on its face, the adequate number of facts varies depending on the
complexity of the case.' Kaye v. D'Amato, 357 Fed.Appx. 706, 710 (7th Cir.
2009). Strict adherence to the particularity requirement is especially
important in a case such as this where the predicate fraud allegations
provide the only link to federal jurisdiction. ... The 'first rule' of pleading a
RICO claim is that the 'plaintiff must identify the enterprise.' Jennings v.
Emry, 910 F.2d 1434, 1439-40 (7th Cir. 1990) (quotation omitted). Under the
RICO statute, an enterprise can be made up of 'any individual, partnership,
corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of
individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.' 18 U.S.C. §
1961(4). This definition has been interpreted to include any 'ongoing
'structure' of persons associated through time, joined in purpose, and
organized in a manner amenable to hierarchical or consensual decision-
making.' Jennings, 910 F.2d at 1440. ... Any RICO enterprise must consist of
more than a group of people who get together to commit a pattern of
racketeering activity. Richmond, 52 F.3d at 644. The enterprise must be
'distinct, separate, and apart from a pattern of racketeering activity:
although a pattern of racketeering activity may be the means through which
the enterprise interacts with society, it is not itself the enterprise, for an
enterprise is defined by what it is, not what it does.' Jennings, 910 F.2d at
1440. As a result, it is appropriate for the Court 'to consider whether the
enterprise would still exist were the predicate acts removed from the
equation,' and whether the defendants' actions were motivated by anything
other than self-interest. See Okaya v. Denne Indus., 2000 WL 1727785, at *4
(N.D. Ill. Nov. 20, 2000) (internal quotation omitted).
Summary
Detailed explanation of the elements required to establish a civil RICO
claim, including the necessity of demonstrating an enterprise, a pattern of
racketeering activity, and a cognizable injury. It also highlights the
importance of pleading fraud with particularity under Rule 9(b) and the
need to identify the enterprise distinctly from the racketeering activity. The
passage cites relevant case law and statutory provisions, which are essential
for drafting a civil RICO complaint. The information is applicable to any civil
RICO case in the U.S. Federal jurisdiction, making it highly relevant to the
question.

&#34;which is chargeable under State law and punishable by imprisonment
for more than one year,&#34; as well as any act chargeable under one of
several enumerated federal statutes. § 1961(1). A &#34; ‘pattern of
racketeering activity’ requires at least two acts of racketeering
activity,&#34; § 1961(5), which must be &#34;related&#34; and

Pleading a pattern of racketeering activity requires the plaintiff to allege
that the defendant participated in at least two acts that were chargeable
under the enumerated federal statutes. The plaintiff must adequately plead
the elements of each predicate act, satisfying the pleading standard that
would apply if the predicate act were a stand-alone claim.
Summary

Lockhart v. Deluca
U.S. District Court — Eastern District of Michigan
Extract
The Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO, was
enacted to curb “racketeering activity,” which it defines as any act
“chargeable” under several generically described state criminal laws, any
act “indictable” under numerous specific federal criminal provisions,
including mail and wire fraud, and any “offense” involving bankruptcy or
securities fraud or drug-related activities that is “punishable” under federal
law.” 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1); see also Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., Inc., 473
U.S. 479, 481-82 (1985). For violations of RICO, Congress has provided
primarily criminal penalties. See 18 U.S.C. § 1963. But § 1964 establishes a
civil cause of action for “[a]ny person injured in his business of property by
reason of a violation of [18 U.S.C. § 1962].” To state a RICO claim, a plaintiff
must plead: “(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of
racketeering activity.” Sedima, S.P.R.L., 473 U.S. at 496. The Sixth Circuit
has instructed that RICO pleadings must be liberally construed, Begala v.
PNC Bank, 214 F.3d 776, 781 (6th Cir. 2000), but plaintiffs nonetheless must

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
offer allegations establishing each element. Each of these elements, in turn,
has its own sub-elements. To plead an enterprise, for instance, a plaintiff
must allege: 1) an ongoing organization with some sort of framework or
superstructure for making and carrying out decisions; 2) that the members
of the enterprise functioned as a continuing unit with established duties;
and 3) that the enterprise was separate and distinct from the pattern of
racketeering activity in which it engaged. Ouwinga v. Benistar 419 Plan
Servs., Inc., 694 F.3d 783, 793 (6th Cir. 2012). As for the “conduct” element,
the plaintiff's allegations must establish that a defendant participated,
“directly or indirectly, in the conduct of [the RICO] enterprise's affairs.” 18
U.S.C. § 1962(c).
Summary
Need for an ongoing organization, a continuing unit, and a distinct
enterprise from the racketeering activity. This information is essential for

any act ‘chargeable' under several generically described state criminal laws,
[] any act ‘indictable' under numerous specific federal criminal provisions,
and any ‘offense' involving bankruptcy or securities fraud or drug-related

contains four subsections that set forth the criminal activities prohibited
under RICO. See 18 U.S.C. § 1962(a)-(d). Section 1964 creates a private civil
action for treble damages for “[a]ny person injured in his business or
property by reason of a violation of section 1962 of this chapter.” 18 U.S.C. §
1964(c). “A private cause of action under RICO requires that the plaintiff
allege: ‘(1) the defendant's violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1962, (2) an injury to the
plaintiff's business or property, and (3) causation of the injury by the
defendant's violation.'” Lerner v. Fleet Bank, N.A., 459 F.3d 273, 283 (2d Cir.

La Ronde-Bey v. Chica
U.S. District Court — Middle District of Pennsylvania
Extract
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (“RICO”) Act makes it
unlawful for “any person employed by or associated with any enterprise
engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce,
to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such
enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of
unlawful debt.” [] To establish a RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), a
plaintiff must show: “(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
(4) of racketeering activity.” [] An “enterprise” includes “any individual,
partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or
group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.” [] A
“pattern” of racketeering activity requires at least two predicate acts of
racketeering within a ten-year period. [] The RICO statute also lists acts that
constitute “racketeering activity.” [] 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d) makes it unlawful
for any person to conspire to violate 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). A plaintiff only has
standing to bring a RICO claim if, and can only recover to the extent that, he
has been injured in his business or property by the conduct constituting the
violation.[] Thus, a plaintiff must allege (and eventually prove) that he
suffered a concrete financial loss in the form of an injury to business or
property. Allegations of “personal injury or emotional harm are not proper
bases for a RICO claim.”[]
Summary
Elements necessary to establish a RICO claim, which include demonstrating
conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. It also
clarifies what constitutes an enterprise and a pattern of racketeering
activity. Additionally, it specifies the requirement for a plaintiff to show a
concrete financial loss to have standing. This information is crucial for

Nunes v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., 609 F. Supp. 1055
(D. Md. 1985)
U.S. District Court — District of Maryland
Extract
In Counts IX, X, XIX, and XX of the Complaint, plaintiffs allege causes of
action under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act
(RICO), 18 U.S.C. § 1961 et seq. Defendants assert that plaintiffs have failed
to state a claim, particularly that plaintiffs have failed to plead the predicate
acts constituting racketeering activity and that plaintiffs have failed to
describe an enterprise separate and apart from Merrill Lynch. The civil
remedies available under RICO are provided by 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c), which
states that: '(c) Any person injured in his business or property by reason of a
violation of section 1962 of this chapter may sue therefor in any appropriate
United States district court and shall recover threefold the damages he
sustains and the cost of the suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee.'
Section 1962(c) provides: '(c) It shall be unlawful for any person employed
by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which
affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or
indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of
racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt.' The definitions for the
material terms contained in § 1962 are provided in § 1961 as follows: The
predicate offenses alleged by plaintiffs in this case include mail fraud, wire
fraud, and federal securities fraud. Plaintiffs' complaint alleges that between

=== PAGE 22 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
October 1982 and June 1983, the defendants committed at least two of the
predicate acts stated above. Under § 1961(5), a pattern of racketeering
activity has been sufficiently established for purposes of a motion to dismiss
if the plaintiff has alleged that defendants are guilty of two acts of
racketeering activity. See Battlefield Builders, Inc. v. Swango, 743 F.2d 1060,
1063 (4th Cir.1984). As plaintiffs have alleged such acts, they have
sufficiently alleged a pattern of racketeering activity and the predicate acts
constituting racketeering activity. An 'enterprise' under § 1961(4) must be
an entity separate and apart from the pattern of racketeering activity in
which it engages, and must be an entity whose members are 'associated
together for a common purpose of engaging in a course of conduct.' United
States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 583, 101 S.Ct. 2524, 2528, 69 L.Ed.2d 246
(1981). See also United States v. Griffin, 660 F.2d 996, 999 (4th Cir.1981),
cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1156, 102 S.Ct. 1029, 71 L.Ed.2d 313 (1982). An
enterprise must have a 'common or shared purpose,' it must 'function as a
continuing unit,' and it must have an ''ascertainable structure' distinct from
that inherent in the conduct of a pattern of racketeering activity.' United
States v. Bledsoe, 674 F.2d 647, 665 (8th Cir.1982). Furthermore, the
enterprise must 'refer to a being different from, not the same as or part of,
the person whose behavior the act was designed to prohibit, and, failing
that, punish.' United States v. Computer Sciences Corp., 689 F.2d 1181,
1190 (4th Cir.1982).
Summary
Detailed explanation of the requirements for a civil RICO claim, including
the need to establish an enterprise that is distinct from the pattern of
racketeering activity, the necessity of demonstrating a pattern of
racketeering activity through at least two predicate acts, and the potential
for treble damages under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c). The passage also references
relevant case law that can be used to support a RICO claim, such as United
States v. Turkette and United States v. Bledsoe, which discuss the
characteristics of an enterprise and the continuity and structure required.

associated with 'organized crime.' It was, however, the declared purpose of
Congress to 'seek the eradication of organized crime in the United States.'

This information is crucial for drafting a civil RICO complaint as it outlines
the legal basis for seeking treble damages and highlights the broad
applicability of RICO, which can be used to argue the existence of an
enterprise and the continuity of racketeering activity.

3d 560 (E.D. Va. 2020)
U.S. District Court — Eastern District of Virginia
Extract
Plaintiff alleges Civil RICO against 1st Advantage and John Doe, pursuant to
18 U.S. C. §§ 1961 et seq. ECF No. 11 at ¶¶ 257-269. Generally, the elements
of a civil Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) claim
are (1) a person, (2) an enterprise, (3) a pattern of (4) racketeering activity
(5) which causes injury to the plaintiff. 18 U.S.C.A. § 1962 (a, c). 'The injury
and causation components [of element (5)] are viewed as standing
requirements.' D'Addario v. Geller, 264 F.Supp.2d 367, at 396 (E.D. Va.
2003); see also, Williams v. Equity Holding Corp., 498 F. Supp. 2d 831, 840
(E.D. Va. 2007). The Supreme Court has explained that a civil RICO claim
has four essential elements: '(1) conduct; (2) of an enterprise; (3) through a
pattern; (4) of racketeering activity.' Whitney, Bradley & Brown, Inc. v.
Kammermann, 436 F. App'x 257, 258 (4th Cir. 2011). 'Racketeering activity'

principal within the meaning of section 2, title 18, United States Code, to
use or invest, directly or indirectly, any part of such income, or the proceeds
of such income, in acquisition of any interest in, or the establishment or
operation of, any enterprise which is engaged in, or the activities of which
affect, interstate or foreign commerce. ... (b) It shall be unlawful for any
person through a pattern of racketeering activity or through collection of an
unlawful debt to acquire or maintain, directly or indirectly, any interest in or
control of any enterprise which is engaged in, or the activities of which
affect, interstate or foreign commerce. ... (c) It shall be unlawful for any
person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the
activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or
participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs
through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt. ...
(d) It shall be unlawful for any person to conspire to violate any of the
provisions of subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section.
Summary
18 U.S.C. § 1962 outlines the prohibited activities under the RICO statute,
which include using income derived from racketeering to invest in
enterprises, acquiring or maintaining control of enterprises through
racketeering, participating in the conduct of an enterprise's affairs through
racketeering, and conspiring to commit any of these acts. This is directly
relevant to drafting a civil RICO complaint as it provides the legal basis for
alleging unlawful activities by the defendants.

complaint as it outlines the remedies available and the jurisdictional
authority of the courts.
18 U.S.C. § 1961 18 U.S.C. § 1961 Definitions
Extract
As used in this chapter- 'racketeering activity' means (A) any act or threat
involving murder, kidnapping, gambling, arson, robbery, bribery, extortion,
dealing in obscene matter, or dealing in a controlled substance or listed
chemical (as defined in section 102 of the Controlled Substances Act), which
is chargeable under State law and punishable by imprisonment for more
than one year; ... 'enterprise' includes any individual, partnership,
corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of
individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity; 'pattern of
racketeering activity' requires at least two acts of racketeering activity, one
of which occurred after the effective date of this chapter and the last of
which occurred within ten years (excluding any period of imprisonment)
after the commission of a prior act of racketeering activity;
Summary
The passage provides definitions crucial for establishing a RICO claim, such
as "racketeering activity," "enterprise," and "pattern of racketeering
activity." These definitions are essential for drafting a civil RICO complaint
as they outline the necessary elements to establish a RICO violation,
including the types of activities that qualify as racketeering, the concept of
an enterprise, and the requirement of a pattern of activity. This information
is critical for demonstrating the existence of an enterprise, continuity,
intent, and a common goal among defendants in a RICO case.

continuity of illegal activities, both of which are necessary elements in a
RICO complaint.
18 U.S.C. § 1968 18 U.S.C. § 1968 Civil Investigative Demand
Extract
Whenever the Attorney General has reason to believe that any person or
enterprise may be in possession, custody, or control of any documentary
materials relevant to a racketeering investigation, he may, prior to the
institution of a civil or criminal proceeding thereon, issue in writing, and
cause to be served upon such person, a civil investigative demand requiring
such person to produce such material for examination.
Summary
The Attorney General has the authority to issue a civil investigative demand
to gather documentary materials relevant to a racketeering investigation.
This is pertinent to the question as it highlights a mechanism for obtaining
evidence, such as text messages, financial records, and court documents,
which are crucial for establishing the elements of a RICO complaint.
18 U.S.C. § 1963 18 U.S.C. § 1963 Criminal Penalties
Extract
Upon application of the United States, the court may enter a restraining
order or injunction, require the execution of a satisfactory performance
bond, or take any other action to preserve the availability of property
described in subsection (a) for forfeiture under this section... The court, in
imposing sentence on such person shall order, in addition to any other
sentence imposed pursuant to this section, that the person forfeit to the
United States all property described in this subsection.
Summary
The passage from 18 U.S.C. § 1963 discusses the penalties and forfeiture
provisions applicable to violations of section 1962, which is central to RICO
cases. It highlights the court's authority to impose forfeiture of property and
issue restraining orders or injunctions to preserve property for forfeiture.

This is relevant to a civil RICO complaint as it provides a legal basis for
seeking injunctive relief and the forfeiture of assets obtained through
racketeering activities. The passage also underscores the potential for the
court to take actions to ensure that property remains available for forfeiture,
which aligns with the request for injunctive relief in a civil RICO complaint.

Bourgeois, Richard L., Jr. - 2000-03-22
Extract
in United States v. Turkette,(135) the Second Circuit allows the government
to prove the existence of an enterprise through proof establishing
commission of the racketeering acts.(136) In addition, the Second Circuit
noted that neither RICO's legislative history, nor the statute itself, indicate
that Congress intended the two elements to be distinct.(137) In espousing
this view, the Second Circuit relaxed the emphasis on continuity as an
element in proving the existence of an enterprise, concluding that
'relatedness and continuity are attributes of activity, not of a RICO
enterprise.'(138) The court later added, however, that '[e]vidence of
relatedness and continuity, or the threat of continuity, may arise from ... the
nature of the RICO enterprise itself.'(139) Other circuits also concluded that
the government is not required to prove, by separate evidence, the existence
of an enterprise and a pattern of racketeering activity.(140)
Summary
The Second Circuit in United States v. Turkette allows for the proof of an
enterprise through the commission of racketeering acts. This interpretation
suggests that the elements of an enterprise and racketeering activity are not
distinct, and continuity is more about the activity than the enterprise itself.
This is relevant for drafting a civil RICO complaint as it provides a legal
basis for establishing an enterprise without needing separate evidence for
each element.
Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy
The Brief - American Bar Association - 2024-01-01
Extract
A violation of § 1962(c), the section on which Sedima relies, requires (1)
conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity. The plaintiff must allege each of the elements to state a claim. They
are all equally essential components, and the complaint will fail if any one of
them is not adequately pleaded. In particular, RICO claims based on mail or

=== PAGE 28 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
wire fraud must comport with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b)’s
requirement that allegations involving fraud be pleaded with particularity.
The practitioner through their pleadings must articulate with great care and
attention a viable racketeering claim. In addition, § 1962(a), (b), and (c) are
limited in scope to conduct involving enterprises engaged in or the activities
of which affect interstate commerce. It is the activities of the enterprise, not
each predicate act, that must affect interstate or foreign commerce. RICO
requires no more than a slight effect upon interstate commerce.
Summary
Detailed explanation of the elements required to establish a civil RICO claim
under § 1962(c), which includes conduct, enterprise, pattern of racketeering
activity, and injury. It emphasizes the necessity of pleading these elements
with particularity, especially in cases involving fraud, and highlights the
requirement for the enterprise's activities to affect interstate commerce.
This information is crucial for drafting a civil RICO complaint as it outlines
the legal framework and requirements that must be met.
Corporate Criminal Liability: End It, Don't Mend It.
The Journal of Corporation Law - University of Iowa Journal of
Corporation Law - Smith, Stephen F. - 2022-06-22
Extract
Subsection 1962(c), the most commonly used basis for substantive RICO
charges, is instructive. It imposes civil and criminal liability on the persons
'employed by or associated with' organized-crime syndicates or other RICO
'enterprises' who 'conduct, or participate in the conduct of, the [enterprise's]
affairs' through a 'pattern of racketeering activity.' (18) Although, as used in
federal law, the term 'persons' can be construed to encompass corporations
and certain other legal entities depending on context, (19) RICO defines
'person' narrowly so as to exclude organized crime syndicates. (20)
Congress thus recognized that the vital objective of eradicating organized
crime could be fully accomplished by taking aim at those who commit the
racketeering activities...
Summary
The passage provides insight into the application of RICO, specifically under
subsection 1962(c), which is relevant for drafting a civil RICO complaint. It
explains the liability imposed on individuals associated with RICO
enterprises and the conduct of racketeering activities. This information is
crucial for establishing the legal basis for a RICO complaint, as it outlines
the elements required to prove a RICO violation, such as the existence of an
enterprise and a pattern of racketeering activity. The passage also highlights
the legislative intent behind RICO, which is to target individuals committing
racketeering activities rather than the organizations themselves.

Crusey, Elisabeth F. - 2022-05-01
Extract
RICO is not just a tool for government control over organized crime. It is
also a remedial statute for civil matters. (31) It 'authorize[s]... criminal or
civil remedies on conduct already criminal, when performed in a specified
fashion' as delineated by the statute. (32) Section 1962 provides civil
remedies for four types of conduct: (1) using income derived from a pattern
of racketeering activity (33) to acquire an interest in an enterprise; (2)
acquiring or maintaining an interest in an enterprise through a pattern of
racketeering activity; (3) conducting the affairs of an enterprise through a
pattern of racketeering activity; and (4) conspiring to commit any of these
offenses. (34) Today, Congress urges courts to construe RICO liberally from
the 'perspective of the victim, not the perpetrator.' (35) A private civil right
of action in [section] 1964 provides that '[a]ny person injured in his business
or property by reason of a violation of section 1962... may sue.' (36) Notably,

role in addressing organized crime and providing civil remedies. It outlines
the types of conduct that can lead to civil remedies under Section 1962 and
emphasizes the liberal construction of RICO from the victim's perspective.

Extract
The inquiry here is meant to invoke the 'pattern of racketeering activity'
element of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).
The Organized Crime Control Act (1970), which includes RICO, provides that
'criminal conduct forms a pattern if it embraces criminal acts that have the
same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of
commission, or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics
and are not isolated events.' The Supreme Court characterized this
requirement as a 'relationship' element and held that the statute further
requires a 'continuity' element, 'referring either to a closed period of
repeated conduct, or to past conduct that by its nature projects into the
future with a threat of repetition.'
Summary
Detailed explanation of the "pattern of racketeering activity" element
required under RICO. It explains that criminal conduct must form a pattern
by having similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of
commission, and must not be isolated events. Additionally, it highlights the
requirement of a "continuity" element, which can be either a closed period
of repeated conduct or past conduct that suggests a threat of future
repetition. This information is crucial for drafting a civil RICO complaint as
it outlines the necessary elements to establish a pattern of racketeering
activity, which is a key component of a RICO claim.

Extract
In a substantive Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO)
prosecution, the five-year statute of limitations begins from the date of the
last predicate act in which the defendant personally participated, not the
date of the last predicate act committed by the enterprise as a whole. State
must specifically plead a RICO conspiracy if it intends to charge a defendant
accordingly. In a RICO conspiracy, the crime is premised not upon the
commission of the predicate acts of racketeering, or even an agreement to
commit predicate acts, but upon an agreement to participate in the affairs of
the criminal enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. While the
state may plead and prove a substantive RICO charge by establishing a
pattern of racketeering activity that includes conspiracies to commit
predicate acts, this does not convert a plainly pleaded substantive RICO
charge into a RICO conspiracy. A conspiracy to commit predicate acts of
racketeering is different in kind from a conspiracy to conduct the affairs of
the enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. The former
describes a method by which a substantive RICO can be charged and
proven. The latter describes a RICO conspiracy offense.
Summary
The passage provides important information about the statute of limitations
for RICO cases, which is crucial for drafting a complaint. It also clarifies the
distinction between substantive RICO charges and RICO conspiracy
charges, which is essential for properly framing the allegations in the
complaint. This information is generally applicable to RICO cases and can be
used to ensure that the complaint is properly structured and that the correct
legal standards are applied.

APPLYING THE MORRISON TEST TO CLAIMS ARISING UNDER THE RICO
ACT... federal courts have applied the Morrison test to claims arising in non-
transactional matters, and in particular, several courts have applied the
Morrison test in cases arising under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c)... the challenge of applying
Morrison in RICO cases stems from the difficulty in ascertaining where a
RICO enterprise is located... the district court in Chevron Corp. took a
different approach when considering a RICO claim that involved a scheme
formulated predominantly by Americans to extort funds from Chevron Corp.
(a U.S. Company) through 'a pattern of racketeering activity that included
acts in the United States by Americans as well as acts in Ecuador by both
Americans and Ecuadorians.'... the court found that 'the focus properly is on
the pattern of racketeering activity and its consequences.'... RICO, 18 U.S.C.

Summary
The Morrison test is applied to RICO claims to determine their territoriality,
focusing on the pattern of racketeering activity rather than the location of
the enterprise. This is crucial for drafting a RICO complaint as it emphasizes
the need to establish a pattern of racketeering activity and its impact, which
aligns with the requirement to demonstrate an enterprise, continuity, intent,
and a common goal among defendants.
Defending Civil RICO Claims: A Defense Plan Should Be In Every Business's
Arsenal
Extract
Congress passed the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act
(RICO), 18 U.S.C. Sections 1961-68, over 51 years ago with the intent to
close the gap in the criminal prosecution of organized crime... Civil RICO
actions are now ubiquitous, so much so that plaintiffs often attempt to apply
the statute to situations that bear little resemblance to the criminal
racketeering activity animating the enactment of the statute in the first
place... RICO is not a simple statute. It pertains to conduct associated with
an 'enterprise' and 'a pattern racketeering activity.' An enterprise is an
individual or legal entity, or a union or group of individuals associated in fact
although not a legal entity, while a pattern of racketeering activity requires
long-term, organized conduct to violate state and federal laws... Second, to
prove most types of RICO claims, the plaintiff must plead that the defendant
committed some qualifying criminal action, the most common of which is
mail, wire or securities fraud... Third, the plaintiff must plead a pattern of
racketeering activity for most RICO claims. If the alleged conduct occurred
once or twice, or was not continuous, it cannot form a pattern of conduct
sufficient to support a RICO claim... Fourth, for most RICO claims, the
plaintiff also must plead that the alleged 'person' and 'enterprise,' as defined
in RICO, are distinct... Fifth, a RICO claim cannot exist without some nexus
to interstate commerce... Finally, RICO has a four-year statute of limitations,
which is triggered by the date a plaintiff discovered or should have
discovered the purported criminal activity.

Defending RICO Claims In The Business Context Part II: RICO Claims Must
Allege Injury To Business Or Property
Extract
In Part II, we describe one of the best tools businesses have in the toolkit—
moving to dismiss a RICO claim because the plaintiff failed to allege that his
purported injuries are sufficient to convey what is 'RICO standing.'
Fortunately for defendants, the RICO standing requirement greatly restricts
the types of claims that can survive a motion to dismiss. If a plaintiff brings a
civil suit alleging a RICO violation, the plaintiff must plausibly allege that his
injury animating the RICO claim is associated with his business or property
by reason of the defendant's violation of the RICO laws. Absent these
allegations, the lawsuit must be dismissed. RICO standing is distinct from
the more well-known concept of constitutional standing. For RICO claims, in
addition to pleading a sufficiently specific injury, including allegations that
the plaintiff has suffered known damages (as opposed to mere speculative or
unprovable damages), the plaintiff must allege that he suffered an injury to
his business or property that bears some causal relationship to the alleged
act or acts that violated RICO. This fundamental RICO requirement helps
ensure that RICO is not expanded beyond its original intent.
Summary
The passage provides insight into the requirement for RICO standing, which
is crucial for drafting a civil RICO complaint. It emphasizes that the plaintiff
must allege a specific injury to business or property that is causally related
to the defendant's RICO violation. This requirement is fundamental to
ensure that RICO claims are not expanded beyond their original intent. The
passage also distinguishes RICO standing from constitutional standing,
highlighting the need for a concrete financial loss.

RICO: A Primer
Extract
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act
(&#34;RICO&#34;) was enacted in 1970. Although RICO provides for both
civil remedies and criminal penalties, the number of civil RICO claims far
outstrips the number of criminal RICO cases brought each year. RICO
provides for a civil action against persons engaged in a &#34;pattern of
racketeering activity&#34; or &#34;collection of an unlawful debt.&#34; A
successful plaintiff may recover treble damages, costs, and attorneys&#39;
fees. RICO is, however, an intricate, complex statutory regime with
numerous potential pitfalls. Yet a civil RICO claim involves several standard,
key issues. We address several of those fundamental issues below. What is
&#34;Racketeering activity&#34;? The heart of a RICO case is the
existence of a pattern of racketeering activity. Under the statute,
&#34;racketeering activity&#34; includes a host of offenses. Section 1961
defines the phrase to include any crime listed in subdivisions A, B, C, D, E, F,
or G of section 1961. ... Notably, there must be some nexus to interstate or
foreign commerce-it is a jurisdictional element of a civil RICO claim. Thus,
predicate acts will often occur in several States. Who is a RICO
&#34;Person&#34;? A RICO person &#34;includes any individual or entity
capable of holding a legal or beneficial interest in property.&#34; This
definition defines those who can be charged under RICO. While the
definition clearly includes a natural person, as well as a corporation, union,
partnership and a sole proprietorship, it is not settled whether the definition
encompasses a governmental entity. What is a RICO Enterprise? A plaintiff is
required to demonstrate that the defendant conducted the affairs of an
enterprise though a pattern of racketeering activity. The person and the
enterprise generally must be distinct; but, of course, a Rico person can be a
part of an enterprise. A RICO enterprise includes &#34;any individual,
partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or
group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.&#34;
Courts have interpreted &#34;enterprise&#34; broadly, and the definition
captures both legitimate and illegitimate enterprises. The statutory list is
not exhaustive but merely illustrative. What is A RICO &#34;Pattern&#34;?
A &#34;pattern&#34; may exist where any combination of two or more
offenses occurred within a period of time. In Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co.,
473 U.S. 479 , the Supreme Court held that the RICO pattern element
requires more than merely proving two predicate acts of racketeering.

Rather, proof of &#34;continuity plus relationship&#34; is necessary.
Nonetheless, the Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized that Congress
had a fairly flexible concept of a pattern in mind. The Supreme Court has
stated that: ... A plaintiff may demonstrate a pattern by establishment that
the predicate acts pose a threat of continued criminal activity, which is
generally demonstrated by showing either: * Closed-ended continuity.
Proving &#34;a series of related predicate acts extending over a substantial
period of time.&#34; * Open-ended continuity. A threat of &#34;continuing
criminal activity extending indefinitely into the future,&#34; in light of the
nature of the enterprise and predicate acts alleged. RICO Violations There
are four separate and distinct RICO violations set out in section 1962: (a)
acquiring or operating an enterprise using racketeering proceeds; (b)
controlling an enterprise using racketeering activities; (c) conducting the
affairs of an enterprise using racketeering activities; and (d) conspiring to so
acquire, control, or conduct. Each of the subsections incorporates the basic
elements of &#34;enterprise&#34; and a &#34;pattern of racketeering
activity.&#34; Section 1962(a) ... Section 1962(b) is the least used of the
four RICO subsections. Under section 1962(b), it is a violation to acquire or
maintain an interest in an enterprise affecting interstate or foreign
commerce through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of an
unlawful debt. To prove a violation of Section 1962(b), a plaintiff must prove
the following elements: * Existence of an enterprise; * The enterprise
engaged in, or its activities affected, interstate or foreign commerce; * The
defendant acquired or maintained, directly or indirectly, an interest in or
control of the enterprise; and * The defendant acquired or maintained the
interest through a pattern of racketeering activity or through collection of
an unlawful debt. Courts have held that a plaintiff must allege a specific
nexus between control of the named enterprise and the alleged racketeering
activity. Section 1962(c) Subsection (c) is, far and away, the most often used
and important substantive RICO provision. Under section 1962(c), it is a
violation to conduct the affairs of an enterprise affecting interstate or
foreign commerce &#34;through&#34; a pattern of racketeering activity or
through the alternative theory of collection of an unlawful debt. To prove a
violation of Section 1962(c), a plaintiff must prove the following elements: *
Existence of an enterprise; * The enterprise engaged in, or its activities
affected, interstate or foreign commerce; * The defendant was employed by
or was associated with the enterprise; * The defendant conducted or
participated, either directly or indirectly, in the conduct of the affairs of the
enterprise; and * The defendant participated in the affairs of the enterprise
through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt.

RICO: A Primer
Extract
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) was
enacted in 1970. Although RICO provides for both civil remedies and
criminal penalties, the number of civil RICO claims far outstrips the number
of criminal RICO cases brought each year. RICO provides for a civil action
against persons engaged in a 'pattern of racketeering activity' or 'collection
of an unlawful debt.' A successful plaintiff may recover treble damages,
costs, and attorneys' fees. RICO is, however, an intricate, complex statutory
regime with numerous potential pitfalls. Yet a civil RICO claim involves
several standard, key issues. We address several of those fundamental issues
below. What is 'Racketeering activity'? The heart of a RICO case is the
existence of a pattern of racketeering activity. Under the statute,
'racketeering activity' includes a host of offenses. Section 1961 defines the
phrase to include any crime listed in subdivisions A, B, C, D, E, F, or G of
section 1961. Notably, there must be some nexus to interstate or foreign
commerce-it is a jurisdictional element of a civil RICO claim. Thus, predicate
acts will often occur in several States. Who is a RICO 'Person'? A RICO
person 'includes any individual or entity capable of holding a legal or
beneficial interest in property.' This definition defines those who can be
charged under RICO. While the definition clearly includes a natural person,
as well as a corporation, union, partnership and a sole proprietorship, it is
not settled whether the definition encompasses a governmental entity. What
is a RICO Enterprise? A plaintiff is required to demonstrate that the
defendant conducted the affairs of an enterprise though a pattern of
racketeering activity. The person and the enterprise generally must be
distinct; but, of course, a Rico person can be a part of an enterprise. A RICO
enterprise includes 'any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or
other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals associated in fact
although not a legal entity.' Courts have interpreted 'enterprise' broadly, and
the definition captures both legitimate and illegitimate enterprises. The
statutory list is not exhaustive but merely illustrative. What is A RICO
'Pattern'? A 'pattern' may exist where any combination of two or more
offenses occurred within a period of time. In Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co.,
473 U.S. 479, the Supreme Court held that the RICO pattern element
requires more than merely proving two predicate acts of racketeering.
Rather, proof of 'continuity plus relationship' is necessary. Nonetheless, the
Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized that Congress had a fairly flexible
concept of a pattern in mind. There are four separate and distinct RICO
violations set out in section 1962: (a) acquiring or operating an enterprise
using racketeering proceeds; (b) controlling an enterprise using
racketeering activities; (c) conducting the affairs of an enterprise using
racketeering activities; and (d) conspiring to so acquire, control, or conduct.
Each of the subsections incorporates the basic elements of 'enterprise' and a

'pattern of racketeering activity.' Section 1962(a) Under Section 1962(a), it
is violation to invest the proceeds of racketeering activity in an enterprise
that affects interstate commerce. Section 1962(b) is the least used of the
four RICO subsections. Under section 1962(b), it is a violation to acquire or
maintain an interest in an enterprise affecting interstate or foreign
commerce through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of an
unlawful debt. To prove a violation of Section 1962(b), a plaintiff must prove
the following elements: * Existence of an enterprise; * The enterprise
engaged in, or its activities affected, interstate or foreign commerce; * The
defendant acquired or maintained, directly or indirectly, an interest in or
control of the enterprise; and * The defendant acquired or maintained the
interest through a pattern of racketeering activity or through collection of
an unlawful debt. Courts have held that a plaintiff must allege a specific
nexus between control of the named enterprise and the alleged racketeering
activity. Section 1962(c) Subsection (c) is, far and away, the most often used
and important substantive RICO provision. Under section 1962(c), it is a
violation to conduct the affairs of an enterprise affecting interstate or
foreign commerce 'through' a pattern of racketeering activity or through the
alternative theory of collection of an unlawful debt. To prove a violation of
Section 1962(c), a plaintiff must prove the following elements: * Existence of
an enterprise; * The enterprise engaged in, or its activities affected,
interstate or foreign commerce; * The defendant was employed by or was
associated with the enterprise; * The defendant conducted or participated,
either directly or indirectly, in the conduct of the affairs of the enterprise;
and * The defendant participated in the affairs of the enterprise through a
pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt.

necessary elements to prove each. This information is crucial for drafting a
civil RICO complaint, as it provides the legal framework and requirements
that must be met to establish a claim. The passage also highlights the
potential remedies available under RICO, such as treble damages, costs, and
attorneys' fees, which are relevant to the question's request for treble
damages and injunctive relief.
