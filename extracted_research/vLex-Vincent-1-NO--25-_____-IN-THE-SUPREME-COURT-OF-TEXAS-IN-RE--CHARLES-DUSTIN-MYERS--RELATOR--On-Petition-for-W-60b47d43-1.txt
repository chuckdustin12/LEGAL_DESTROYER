Underlying Proceeding: This original SAPCR was initiated to escape a
dormant divorce suit to obtain emergency relief for the children named in
this matter on March 19, 2025. There is a closely related case before this
court (25- 0361) that spells out the series of events leading up to the facts
supporting this Mandamus petition. The Second Court of Appeals denied
mandamus relief on April 11, 2025, and denied En Banc Reconsideration on
May 1, 2025. This Mandamus followed. Respondent Judge: The Respondent
Judge, Honorable Kate Stone, is the presiding Associate Judge of the 233rd
District Court of Tarrant County, Texas. Her office is located at Family Law
Center 200 E. Weatherford St. 5th Floor, Fort Worth, TX 76196-0230.
Respondent’s Challenged Inaction: On March 28,2025, the Respondent
refused to hear the Relator’s properly filed emergency TRO and turned him
away from the courtroom. Three weeks later, the emergency materialized,
resulting in a dental emergency sustained by the youngest child named in
this matter. 7 Statement of Jurisdiction STATEMENT OF JURISDICTION This
Honorable Court has jurisdiction to consider this original proceeding for
writ of mandamus. Tex. Const. art. V, § 3(a); Tex. Gov’t Code § 22.002. 8
Issues Presented Issue No. 1: Did the Respondent Judge clearly abuse her
discretion by refusing to hear or rule upon Relator’s properly filed
emergency motion, thereby failing to perform a ministerial duty and leaving
the Relator without an adequate appellate remedy? Issue No. 2: Does the
pattern of judicial inaction in this case, including the appellate court’s
unexplained denial of relief, warrant intervention by this Court to uphold
due process, protect fundamental parental rights, and maintain public
confidence in the judiciary? 9 PRIOR STATEMENT OF FACTS
INCORPORATED Relator incorporates the statement of facts, mandamus
record, and appendix filed in the Petition for Writ of Mandamus
(02-25-00164-CV) which was denied per curiam on April 11, 2025, and again
on May 1, 2025, by the Second Court of Appeals. STATEMENT OF FACTS
There is a broader systemic issue facing the Texas judiciary that warrants
this Court’s careful attention. In 2020, an analysis by the Texas Home School
Coalition reviewed all Texas appellate cases involving parental-presumption
challenges (post-Troxel v. Granville) and found courts “failed to protect
parents’ constitutional rights more than 78% of the time” in certain
contested suits. 1 That report warned of a “systematic trampling” of
parental rights. In practical terms, family courts have been accused of
issuing temporary orders that strip parents of custody or visitation rights
without the evidentiary safeguards or signed findings usually mandated by
statute (e.g. without findings on endangerment or notice of rights). Such
patterns of perceived overreach erode trust: if parents feel judges routinely
ignore law and deny due process, confidence in “fairness” drops. In late

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
2023 this Court agreed to review Stary v. Ethridge, a case where a mother
received a lifetime protective order barring contact with her children, even
1 https://thsc.org/texas-courts-ignoring-parental-rights/
#:~:text=The%20result%3F 10 though her parental rights had not been
terminated. The Stary case highlights dueprocess concerns: critics note that
standard protective-order proceedings use a lower evidentiary standard
(preponderance) and do not include termination-like warnings or appointed
counsel. In Stary, what began as a temporary ex-parte order became a
permanent ban without a termination hearing. The appeal argues this is
effectively a hidden termination of parental rights without the stringent
safeguards (clear-andconvincing evidence, written findings) normally
required. Such high-profile instances—where a parent loses access
permanently, yet no termination suit is ever filed—raise alarm among family
law observers and fuel public anxiety that courts may be misusing protective
orders to sidestep due process. Texas has enjoyed above-50% confidence in
courts for decades (52% in 1998, 60% in 2018) However, recent signals
point downward. National polls (Gallup, NCSC) and Texas legislative
testimony suggest current trust/satisfaction is significantly lower – in the
mid-40s to 50s percentage range. 2 High-profile cases (like Stary) and media
reports (e.g. the ACLU’s Jackson case) highlight these problems, reinforcing
the perception that Texas family courts sometimes act without
accountability. In this case, the problem rests with the judiciary itself. The
important question here is whether this Court will act and address the
issues presented below. 2 HOUSE COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY AND CIVIL
JURISPRUDENCE JANUARY 2025 11 INTRODUCTION Justice dies in
silence. For fourteen months, this father has shouted into judicial chambers
only to receive echoes of inaction and per curiam denials devoid of
explanation. This is no ordinary dispute—it is a test of judicial integrity.
When a trial court abdicates its duty and appellate courts hide behind
unexplained refusals to intervene, the system itself fractures. The issues
presented go beyond the merits of a single mandamus petition. The record
speaks loudly and clearly for itself. But the deeper wound here is systemic: a
court system that permits fundamental rights—parental rights at the core of
our constitutional values—to be stripped without notice, hearing, or
statutory findings, undermines the rule of law itself. See 25-0361. The
silence of these courts does more than compound procedural errors. It
emboldens litigants who exploit judicial complacency, incentivizes deceitful
pleadings, and breeds public distrust. Worse, it leaves vulnerable children
trapped in uncertainty, becoming collateral damage in a legal system that
has lost sight of its purpose. This case demands attention—not merely for
the rights of one father, but for the legitimacy and accountability of Texas
courts as protectors of the most sacred relationships and freedoms we
possess. The refusal to act by the courts below have resulted in a direct
injury to the child which could have been prevented. 12 ARGUMENT A.
STANDARD OF REVIEW Mandamus is an extraordinary remedy, reserved
for situations where a trial court clearly abuses its discretion and no
adequate remedy by appeal exists. In re Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., 148 S.W.
3d 124, 135–36 (Tex. 2004). A core principle underpinning mandamus relief
is the obligation of a trial court to act on matters properly brought before it.
When a motion, such as Relator’s emergency request for a Temporary
Restraining Order (TRO), has been properly filed and presented to the trial
court, the act of considering and ruling upon that motion is not

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
discretionary; it is ministerial in nature. See In re Layton, 257 S.W.3d 794,
795 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 2008, orig. proceeding) ("When a motion is
properly filed and pending before a trial court, the act of considering and
ruling upon that motion is a ministerial duty."). Mandamus is the appropriate
mechanism to compel a trial court to fulfill this fundamental duty. Id.
Furthermore, fundamental due process, enshrined in both the U.S. and
Texas Constitutions, demands that parties be afforded a meaningful
opportunity to be heard before a court grants or denies relief, particularly
when fundamental rights like parenting are implicated. Creel v. District Atty.
for Medina County, 818 S.W.2d 45, 46 (Tex. 1991). In this case, the record
demonstrates that Relator properly filed and attempted to present an
emergency TRO concerning the safety and welfare of his child. The 13
Respondent Judge, however, refused even to hear the matter, turning the
Relator away from the courtroom on March 28, 2025. This outright refusal
to consider a properly filed emergency motion constitutes a failure to
perform a clear ministerial duty. As established in Layton, such inaction
warrants mandamus relief. The subsequent denial of mandamus by the
Second Court of Appeals, without explanation, effectively endorses this
dereliction of duty, leaving Relator with no adequate remedy by appeal for
the trial court's refusal to act on an urgent matter directly impacting child
safety. B. JUDICIAL INACTION VIOLATES DUE PROCESS AND
FUNDAMENTAL PARENTAL RIGHTS, RESULTING IN PREVENTABLE
HARM The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment forbids any
State from depriving a person of life, liberty, or property without due
process of law. U.S. CONST. amend. XIV, § 1. This guarantee encompasses
both procedural fairness and substantive protections against governmental
infringement upon fundamental liberty interests. Reno v. Flores, 507 U.S.
292, 301-02 (1993). Among the most fundamental liberty interests
recognized by the Supreme Court is the right of parents to direct the
upbringing and care of their children. Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 65
(2000). Texas law echoes these protections, mandating that the best interest
of the child is the primary consideration in custody matters (Tex. Fam. Code
§ 153.002) and requiring procedural safeguards before parental rights are
restricted. 14 Here, the Respondent Judge’s refusal to hear Relator’s
emergency TRO on March 28, 2025, represents a profound violation of these
constitutional and statutory mandates. By turning Relator away and failing
even to schedule a hearing on his properly filed motion alleging imminent
risk to his child, the court denied him the basic procedural due process
required under Creel. This was not a mere delay; it was a complete denial of
the opportunity to be heard on an emergency matter specifically provided
for under the Texas Family Code (See Tex. Fam. Code § 105.001, authorizing
temporary orders for child safety). While Texas law allows for ex parte TROs
under certain urgent circumstances, it simultaneously requires that a
hearing be set promptly, typically within 14 days (See TRCP 680), to ensure
due process is ultimately satisfied. The Respondent’s refusal to even
consider the TRO application flouted these principles entirely. This inaction
occurred despite Relator presenting a justiciable emergency concerning his
child's welfare. The court’s refusal stands in stark contrast to its apparent
swiftness in acting upon the Real Party in Interest's initial application, which
Relator contends was based on false pretenses. The court accepted that
initial emergency filing seemingly without scrutiny, removing Relator from
his home and restricting access to his children based on allegations later

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
proven questionable, yet refused to even entertain Relator’s subsequent,
legitimate 15 emergency concerning actual harm. This differential treatment
further underscores the arbitrary nature of the refusal and the denial of
equal protection. The consequences of this judicial dereliction were not
hypothetical; they were tragically real. As Relator warned, the delay
precipitated by the court's refusal to act allowed the foreseen harm to
materialize: the youngest child suffered a preventable dental emergency
requiring intervention. This direct injury, stemming from the court's failure
to perform its ministerial duty to hear the emergency motion, highlights the
inadequacy of any remedy other than mandamus. An appeal after final
judgment cannot undo the harm suffered by the child or rectify the profound
denial of process experienced by Relator when faced with an immediate
threat to his child's well-being. C. THE REFUSAL TO ACT AND
SUBSEQUENT APPELLATE INACTION ERODE PUBLIC CONFIDENCE AND
DEMAND SUPREME COURT INTERVENTION The issues presented
transcend the specific facts of this case and touch upon the broader integrity
of the Texas judiciary. When a trial court refuses to perform its clear
ministerial duty to hear and rule upon a properly filed emergency motion
alleging child endangerment, see Barnes v. State, 832 S.W.2d 424, 426 (Tex.
App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1992, orig. proceeding) (confirming the ministerial
duty to consider and rule on properly filed motions), and the appellate court
subsequently denies mandamus relief without explanation, it sends a chilling
16 message. Such inaction suggests the courthouse doors may be closed to
those seeking urgent protection for children, potentially violating the Texas
Constitution’s Open Courts Provision, which guarantees access to the courts
for redress of injuries. Tex. Const. art. I, § 13. This apparent disregard for
mandatory duties and fundamental rights fuels the perception, noted in the
original petition referencing the Texas Home School Coalition report and the
Stary v. Ethridge case, that courts may sometimes prioritize expediency or
other factors over due process and parental rights. The Respondent Judge's
refusal to act, followed by the perfunctory denial from the Second Court of
Appeals, creates an accountability vacuum. It allows a clear dereliction of a
ministerial duty—the duty to hear and rule, In re Layton, 257 S.W.3d 794,
795 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 2008, orig. proceeding)—to stand uncorrected,
despite the direct and preventable harm caused to the child. While
mandamus is an extraordinary remedy, its purpose includes compelling
public officials to perform ministerial acts and correcting clear abuses of
discretion where no adequate appellate remedy exists. See In re Prudential
Ins. Co. of Am, 148 S.W.3d 124, 135-36 (Tex. 2004). When judicial inaction
directly leads to irreparable harm, particularly to a child, the remedy by
appeal is inherently inadequate. Id. at 136. This Court's intervention is
necessary not only to rectify the specific injustice suffered by Relator and his
child but also to reaffirm the 17 fundamental principle that Texas courts
must provide a meaningful forum for litigants, especially in emergencies
involving child safety, and must perform their ministerial duties without bias
or arbitrary refusal. The unexplained silence from the lower courts cannot
substitute for adherence to the rule of law and undermines the public trust
essential for the judiciary's legitimacy. Mandamus relief is essential to
compel the Respondent Judge to fulfill her duty and to restore a measure of
faith in the judicial process. CONCLUSION AND PRAYER This is not merely
a dispute over procedural timelines; it is a plea for the enforcement of
fundamental legal obligations and the protection of a children’s well-being.

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
The Respondent Judge's refusal to even consider Relator's emergency
motion, particularly when contrasted with the sister court's earlier actions
from the sister court that removed Relator from his home based on false
allegations, demands correction. The integrity of the judicial process
requires that courts fulfill their basic duties, especially when immediate
risks to children are alleged. Failure to do so constitutes a clear abuse of
discretion warranting mandamus relief. Therefore, all premises considered,
the Relator prays that this Honorable Court: 1. Reverse and order that the
trial court: (1) hear the emergency TRO filed on March 28, 2025; 18 2.
Provide any further relief to the Relator the court deems necessary

APP 1.2 The children are suffering daily from their father being prevented
access to the marital home. The Respondent has prevented access since
March 6, 2024, knowing the Petitioner's need for the residence to work. This
has left the children without the care of either parent for the majority of the
time, and are being told that the divorce has been finalized and that their
father is a bad person. Prior to the Respondent's removal, the Children were
cared for both emotionally and financially by the Petitioner. The Respondent
knowingly and willingly sabotaged this relationship to further her own
agenda with a separate relationship. The emotional well-being and stability
of the children have been destroyed, and their stable life has been
dismantled by the Respondent in bad faith. There exists no legal basis for
the current situation to persist, and the children are already showing signs
of distress, emotional trauma, and are beginning to struggle academically.
The children need the Petitioner's stable, nurturing care during this difficult
time, and they will soon lose all access to their Father who will be homless
given the circumstances. The Petitioner has been fighting for over a year to
get back into his residence to no avail. The Respondent has refused to
participate, and continues to prioritize her new relationship over the
children. Notice would only spark more deceptive legal actions from the
Respondent to try and subvert justice. FM-FH-101-Temporary Restraining

PM Status SENT Did Kate Stone improperly refuse to allow a hearing on an
emergency temporary restraining order regarding a child, un-set a
scheduled hearing, and instruct the litigant to leave the courtroom, thereby
violating Texas procedural law and due process rights, and allowing
opposing counsel to interfere with the proceedings despite not being
present in the courtroom? Brief the State Commission on Judicial Conduct
on this issue and if an investigation should commecnce.
Answer (Texas)
Short response
The available record and controlling Texas law strongly indicate that Judge
Kate Stone’s refusal to hear a properly filed emergency temporary
restraining order (TRO) regarding a child, her unsetting of a scheduled
hearing, and her instruction for the litigant to leave the courtroom likely
violated both Texas procedural law and due process rights. These actions, if
substantiated, warrant investigation by the State Commission on Judicial
Conduct.
Summary
Texas law imposes a ministerial duty on trial judges, including associate
judges, to consider and rule on properly filed motions—especially those
involving the safety and welfare of children. The refusal to hear an
emergency TRO, particularly when accompanied by the unsetting of a
scheduled hearing and exclusion of a party from the courtroom, constitutes
a potential denial of due process and a clear departure from established
statutory and case law requirements, justifying scrutiny by judicial oversight
authorities.
The facts as presented suggest not only a failure to perform a non-
discretionary judicial function but also a possible erosion of public
confidence in the judiciary’s impartiality and accessibility. The State
Commission on Judicial Conduct should commence an investigation to
determine whether Judge Stone’s conduct violated the Texas Code of Judicial
Conduct, the Texas Family Code, and constitutional due process guarantees,
and to ensure accountability and the protection of fundamental rights in the
Texas courts.

=== PAGE 34 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Background and Relevant Law
Legislative Framework
Texas Family Code § 105.001 authorizes courts to issue temporary orders,
including TROs, for the safety and welfare of children in suits affecting the
parent-child relationship. Except for certain emergency orders sought by
governmental entities, the statute requires that such orders generally be
rendered only after notice and a hearing. The law is explicit that the court
may not refuse to hear a properly filed emergency motion unless a statutory
exception applies, and it is designed to ensure that parties have a
meaningful opportunity to be heard before their rights are affected.
Texas Family Code § 201.007 sets forth the powers of associate judges,
including the authority to conduct hearings, hear evidence, regulate
proceedings, and issue temporary orders. Unless specifically limited by an
order of referral, an associate judge is required to exercise these powers in
accordance with the law and cannot arbitrarily refuse to conduct hearings
on matters properly before the court.
Case Law
Texas appellate courts have repeatedly held that a trial court has a
ministerial duty to consider and rule on motions that are properly filed and
pending before it. This duty is not discretionary and is enforceable by
mandamus if the court fails to act within a reasonable time (In re Layton,
257 S.W.3d 794, 795 (Tex. App. 2008); Barnes v. State, 832 S.W.2d 424, 426
(Tex. App. 1992)). The refusal to rule on such motions, especially in the
context of emergency relief affecting child safety, constitutes a denial of due
process and is subject to correction by higher courts (Creel v. District
Attorney for Medina County, Tex., 818 S.W.2d 45 (Tex. 1991)).
The courts have also emphasized that due process requires notice and a
meaningful opportunity to be heard before a court can grant or deny relief
that affects fundamental rights, such as parental rights (In re Ramirez,
04-24-00361-CV (Tex. App. Aug 14, 2024); In re K.M., NO. 12-18-00044-CV
(Tex. App. Apr 18, 2018)). The Texas Code of Judicial Conduct further
mandates that judges must accord every person with a legal interest in a
proceeding the right to be heard according to law (In re Goddard, NO.
12-18-00355-CV (Tex. App. Feb 06, 2019)).
Analysis
1. Ministerial Duty to Hear and Rule on Emergency
Motions
The Texas Family Code and controlling case law are unequivocal: when a
motion is properly filed and pending, the trial court has a ministerial duty to
consider and rule on it within a reasonable time (In re Layton, 257 S.W.3d
794, 795 (Tex. App. 2008); Barnes v. State, 832 S.W.2d 424, 426 (Tex. App.

=== PAGE 35 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
1992)). This duty is heightened in cases involving the safety and welfare of
children, where the legislature has provided for expedited procedures and
emergency relief (Tex. Fam. Code § 105.001).
The record indicates that the relator, Charles Dustin Myers, properly filed an
emergency TRO seeking immediate relief for his children. The judge’s
refusal to hear the motion, her unsetting of a scheduled hearing, and her
instruction for the litigant to leave the courtroom, if true, represent a clear
failure to perform a non-discretionary judicial function. Such conduct is not
justified by any statutory exception and is inconsistent with the associate
judge’s powers and duties under Tex. Fam. Code § 201.007.
2. Due Process and the Right to Be Heard
Due process under both the U.S. and Texas Constitutions requires that
parties be given notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard before the
court takes action affecting their rights (Creel v. District Attorney for
Medina County, Tex., 818 S.W.2d 45 (Tex. 1991)). The Texas Supreme Court
has held that summary dismissal of a petition without notice or hearing is a
denial of due process. In the context of family law, where parental rights are
at stake, the courts have been especially vigilant in enforcing these
procedural safeguards (In re Ramirez, 04-24-00361-CV (Tex. App. Aug 14,
2024); In re K.M., NO. 12-18-00044-CV (Tex. App. Apr 18, 2018)).
The facts presented suggest that Judge Stone’s actions deprived the relator
of any opportunity to be heard on his emergency motion, in direct
contravention of these constitutional and statutory requirements. The
refusal to even schedule or conduct a hearing, particularly when the matter
involves alleged imminent harm to a child, is a grave procedural violation.
3. Judicial Conduct and Public Confidence
The Texas Code of Judicial Conduct requires judges to act impartially,
diligently, and in accordance with the law. The refusal to hear a properly
filed emergency motion, especially when accompanied by the exclusion of a
party from the courtroom and the apparent allowance of interference by
opposing counsel not present in the courtroom, raises serious questions
about impartiality, fairness, and the integrity of the judicial process (In re
Goddard, NO. 12-18-00355-CV (Tex. App. Feb 06, 2019)).
Such conduct, if substantiated, not only undermines the rights of the parties
but also erodes public confidence in the judiciary’s ability to provide a fair
and accessible forum for the resolution of urgent disputes. The Texas
Constitution’s Open Courts Provision guarantees access to the courts for
redress of injuries, and judicial inaction that effectively closes the
courthouse doors to those seeking emergency protection for children is
antithetical to this guarantee.
4. Remedy and Oversight
Mandamus is the appropriate remedy to compel a trial court to perform its
ministerial duties when there is no adequate remedy by appeal (In re

=== PAGE 36 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Layton, 257 S.W.3d 794, 795 (Tex. App. 2008); In re Herring, 221 S.W.3d 729
(Tex. App. 2007)). However, where the conduct in question may also
constitute a violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct or a pattern of judicial
misconduct, the State Commission on Judicial Conduct is empowered to
investigate and, if necessary, discipline judges who fail to uphold the law and
the rights of litigants.
The facts as presented—refusal to hear an emergency motion, unsetting a
scheduled hearing, instructing a litigant to leave the courtroom, and
allowing improper interference by opposing counsel—are sufficiently serious
to warrant an investigation by the Commission. Such an investigation would
serve not only to address the specific conduct at issue but also to reinforce
the standards of judicial accountability and the protection of fundamental
rights in Texas courts.
Exceptions and Caveats
It is important to note that a trial court is afforded a reasonable time to act
on pending motions, and what constitutes a reasonable time depends on the
circumstances (Barnes v. State, 832 S.W.2d 424, 426 (Tex. App. 1992)).
However, in the context of emergency relief for child safety, delays or
refusals to act are rarely justified absent extraordinary circumstances.
Additionally, while the record suggests that opposing counsel may have
interfered with the proceedings despite not being present in the courtroom,
the precise nature and impact of this interference would need to be
established through investigation. The Commission should consider all
relevant evidence, including the court record, witness statements, and any
communications between the parties and the court.
Conclusion
In summary, the refusal by Judge Kate Stone to hear a properly filed
emergency TRO regarding a child, her unsetting of a scheduled hearing, and
her instruction for the litigant to leave the courtroom, if substantiated,
constitute a likely violation of Texas procedural law and due process rights.
These actions are inconsistent with the ministerial duties imposed by the
Texas Family Code and controlling case law, and they undermine the
fundamental right to be heard in matters affecting child safety and parental
rights. The State Commission on Judicial Conduct should commence an
investigation to determine whether Judge Stone’s conduct violated the law
and the Code of Judicial Conduct, and to ensure accountability and the
protection of the public’s confidence in the Texas judiciary.

In re Crystal Aubin, 29 S.W.3d 199 (Tex. App. 2000)
Texas Court of Appeals

=== PAGE 37 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
The Texas Supreme Court has acknowledged that mandamus may issue
where the legal process itself would violate the relator's constitutional
rights. Tilton v. Marshall, 925 S.W.2d 672, 682 (Tex. 1996). Absent a finding,
supported by evidence, that the safety and welfare of the children is
significantly impaired by the denial of the Burks' visitation, Aubin's decision
regarding whether the children will have any contact with the Burks is an
exercise of her fundamental right as a parent. That right is shielded from
judicial interference by the Due Process clause of the United States
Constitution.
Summary
The Texas Supreme Court recognizes the issuance of mandamus in cases
where legal processes infringe upon constitutional rights, such as due
process. This is particularly relevant in family law cases where parental
rights are at stake. The passage highlights the importance of evidence-
supported findings when judicial decisions affect parental rights,
emphasizing the protection of these rights under the Due Process clause.

Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Moreover, the record does not indicate that James, whose conduct was the
reason for and the subject of the temporary protective order, ever objected
to continuation of the order or sought to have the order vacated. The family
code contemplates the setting aside of a temporary ex parte protective order
on the filing of a motion by one affected by the order and after a hearing.
TEX. FAM. CODE ANN. § 83.004. In this case, no one affected by the order
filed a motion to vacate. Chapter 83, which governs temporary ex parte
orders, contains no express language either permitting or prohibiting the
sua sponte setting aside of a temporary protective order. See id. §§ 83.001-.
006 (West 2014). Assuming Respondent's inherent authority allowed him to
sua sponte vacate the order, Section 83.004 would appear to require a
hearing before vacating a temporary protective order. See id. § 83.004; see
also Rymer v. Lewis, 206 S.W.3d 732, 736 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2006, no pet.)
(trial courts possess inherent power to control the disposition of their cases).
Furthermore, the code of judicial conduct requires a judge to 'accord to
every person who has a legal interest in a proceeding, or that person's
lawyer, the right to be heard according to law.' TEX. CODE JUD. CONDUCT,
Canon 3(B)(8), reprinted in TEX. GOV'T CODE ANN., tit. 2, subtit. G App. B

Summary
The Texas Family Code requires a hearing before vacating a temporary
protective order, and the Code of Judicial Conduct mandates that judges
must allow parties with a legal interest in a proceeding the right to be
heard. This suggests that a judge cannot unilaterally refuse to hear a
properly filed motion for a temporary restraining order without violating
procedural law and due process rights.
In re Ramirez, 04-24-00361-CV (Tex. App. Aug 14, 2024)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
A trial court 'may make a temporary order for the safety and welfare of the
child, including an order modifying a prior temporary order' in a suit
affecting the parent-child relationship. Tex. Fam. Code § 105.001(a).
However, except in situations not applicable here, a modification of a
temporary order regarding the temporary conservatorship of a child or
temporary support of a child generally may not be rendered except after
notice and hearing. Id. § 105.001(a)(1)-(2), (b); Herring, 221 S.W.3d at 731.
In Herring, this court determined the trial court abused its discretion by
failing to give notice and an adversary hearing before modifying custody of
the child.
Summary
Texas Family Code § 105.001 requires notice and a hearing before modifying
temporary orders regarding child conservatorship or support. The passage
highlights that failing to provide notice and an adversarial hearing
constitutes an abuse of discretion by the trial court. This is relevant to the
question as it addresses the procedural requirements for temporary orders
and the necessity of a hearing, which may have been violated in the scenario
involving Kate Stone.

This court is authorized to issue mandamus relief to correct a clear abuse of
discretion for which relator has no other adequate remedy. Walker v. Packer,
827 S.W.2d 833, 839-40 (Tex.1992). Because temporary orders in suits
affecting the parent-child relationship are not appealable, a petition for a
writ of mandamus is an appropriate means to challenge them. Dancy v.
Daggett, 815 S.W.2d 548, 549 (Tex.1991); In re Pensom, 126 S.W.3d 251, 257

(Tex.App.-San Antonio 2003, orig. proceeding). ... Here, according to the
trial court's order setting hearing, the only matter set for December 7, 2006
was the motion for entry of judgment. Barrientos did not file and serve on
Herring any pleading asking the court to give her temporary custody. Plus,
the trial court's new temporary order was not prompted by any emergency.
We conclude the trial court's failure to provide Herring notice prior to
issuing a new temporary custody order was a clear abuse of discretion.
Summary
Issuance of mandamus relief to correct a clear abuse of discretion when
there is no other adequate remedy. It highlights that temporary orders in
suits affecting the parent-child relationship are not appealable, making a
writ of mandamus an appropriate means to challenge them. The passage
also emphasizes the importance of providing notice before issuing
temporary custody orders and identifies the failure to do so as a clear abuse
of discretion.
In re K.M., NO. 12-18-00044-CV (Tex. App. Apr 18, 2018)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
In a suit affecting the parent-child relationship, a trial court may make a
temporary order for the child's safety and welfare, including an order (1) for
the temporary conservatorship of the child, (2) for the temporary support of
the child, (3) to restrain a party from disturbing the peace of the child or
another party, (4) to prohibit a person from removing the child beyond a
geographical area identified by the court, or (5) for payment of reasonable
attorney's fees and expenses. TEX. FAM. CODE ANN. § 105.001(a). The trial
court is further authorized to render temporary orders in a suit for
modification. Id. § 156.006(a) (West Supp. 2017). Other than an emergency
order sought by a governmental entity, an order may not be rendered under
section 105.001(a)(1), (2), or (5) except after notice and a hearing.
Summary
Texas law requires a trial court to hold a hearing before rendering certain
temporary orders in suits affecting the parent-child relationship, except in
cases of emergency orders sought by a governmental entity. This implies
that a refusal to hold a hearing on an emergency temporary restraining
order, as alleged in the question, could potentially violate procedural law if
the situation did not meet the criteria for an emergency order without a
hearing.
In re Layton, 257 S.W.3d 794 (Tex. App. 2008)

=== PAGE 40 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
A trial court has a ministerial duty to consider and rule on motions properly
filed and pending before the court and mandamus may issue to compel the
judge to act. Safety-Kleen Corp. v. Garcia, 945 S.W.2d 268, 269 (Tex.App.-
San Antonio 1997, orig. proceeding) (citing O'Donniley v. Golden, 860 S.W.2d
267, 269-70 (Tex. App.-Tyler 1993, orig. proceeding)). However, the trial
court is afforded a reasonable time in which to perform this ministerial duty.
Barnes v. State, 832 S.W.2d 424, 426 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 1992,
orig. proceeding). Whether the trial court has failed to act within a
reasonable time is dependent upon the circumstances of the case. Id.
Summary
A trial court has a ministerial duty to consider and rule on motions that are
properly filed and pending. This duty is not discretionary, and mandamus
may be issued to compel the judge to act if they fail to do so. However, the
court is allowed a reasonable time to perform this duty, and what constitutes
a reasonable time depends on the circumstances of the case.
Creel v. District Attorney for Medina County, Tex., 818 S.W.2d 45 (Tex. 1991)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
The dispositive issue in this cause is whether it was a denial of due process
for the trial court to summarily dismiss Creel's petition absent either notice
or hearing. Fundamental requirements of due process demand an
opportunity to be heard. Armstrong v. Manzo, 380 U.S. 545, 552, 85 S.Ct.
1187, 1191, 14 L.Ed.2d 62, 66 (1965). Consequently, the issue of whether
the district attorney's compliance was moot must still be decided pursuant
to notice and hearing. The trial court acted improperly when it summarily
dismissed Creel's petition for writ of mandamus.
Summary
The Texas Supreme Court has established that due process requires an
opportunity to be heard, and a trial court acts improperly if it dismisses a
petition without notice or a hearing. This principle is generally applicable to
cases in Texas where due process rights are in question.

Extract
When a motion is properly filed and pending before a trial court, the act of
giving consideration to and ruling upon that motion is a ministerial act. ... In
such circumstances, a trial court must consider and rule upon the motion
within what, when all the surrounding circumstances are taken into account,
constitutes a reasonable time. ... A refusal to rule within a reasonable time
would frustrate that process and, moreover, would constitute a denial of due
course of law, ... Consequently, mandamus is available to compel a trial court
to make a ruling within a reasonable time.
Summary
When a motion is properly filed and pending, the trial court has a ministerial
duty to consider and rule on it within a reasonable time. Failure to do so
constitutes a denial of due process, and mandamus can be used to compel
the court to act. This principle is generally applicable to all cases where a
motion is pending before a trial court.
Stary v. Ethridge, 695 S.W.3d 417 (Tex. App. 2022)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Appellant Christine Lenore Stary appeals from the trial court’s order
granting a lifetime family-violence protective order prohibiting her from
communicating with or going near her three minor children. In four issues,
Stary argues that: (1) the trial court violated her right to due process by
granting a lifetime protective order based only on proof by a preponderance
of the evidence rather than by the heightened standard of proof by clear and
convincing evidence; (2) the trial court violated her right to due process by
granting the protective order for a period exceeding two years on the basis
of an unadjudicated felony charge without applying a heightened burden of
proof; (3) the evidence is insufficient to support the trial court’s findings that
she committed family violence and is likely to commit family violence in the
future; and (4) the trial court abused its discretion by excluding evidence of
appellee Brady Neal Ethridge’s domestic abuse of her and denying her
request to make an offer of proof. We affirm.
Summary
Due process rights related to protective orders, specifically the standard of
proof required. It highlights the argument that a protective order that
effectively terminates parental rights should require a higher standard of
proof, similar to parental termination proceedings. This is relevant to the
question as it touches upon due process rights in family law proceedings,
which could be analogous to the situation involving Kate Stone.

Tex. Fam. Code § 105.001 Tex. Fam. Code § 105.001 Temporary Orders
Before Final Order
Extract
In a suit, the court may make a temporary order, including the modification
of a prior temporary order, for the safety and welfare of the child... Except
as provided by Subsection (c), temporary restraining orders and temporary
injunctions under this section shall be granted without the necessity of an
affidavit or verified pleading stating specific facts showing that immediate
and irreparable injury, loss, or damage will result before notice can be
served and a hearing can be held. Except as provided by Subsection (h), an
order may not be rendered under Subsection (a), , or except after notice and
a hearing.
Summary
Texas law allows for temporary restraining orders and temporary injunctions
to be granted without the necessity of an affidavit or verified pleading in
certain circumstances. However, an order under Subsection (a) generally
requires notice and a hearing unless it is an emergency order sought by a
governmental entity. This suggests that a court should not refuse to hear a
properly filed emergency motion without providing notice and a hearing,
unless specific exceptions apply.
Tex. Fam. Code § 201.007 Tex. Fam. Code § 201.007 Powers of Associate
Judge
Extract
Except as limited by an order of referral, an associate judge may: conduct a
hearing; hear evidence; compel production of relevant evidence; rule on the
admissibility of evidence; issue a summons for: (A) the appearance of
witnesses; and (B) the appearance of a parent who has failed to appear
before an agency authorized to conduct an investigation of an allegation of
abuse or neglect of a child after receiving proper notice; examine a witness;
swear a witness for a hearing; make findings of fact on evidence; formulate
conclusions of law; recommend an order to be rendered in a case; regulate
all proceedings in a hearing before the associate judge; order the
attachment of a witness or party who fails to obey a subpoena; order the
detention of a witness or party found guilty of contempt, pending approval
by the referring court as provided by Section FAMILY CODE 201.013;
without prejudice to the right to a de novo hearing before the referring
court under Section FAMILY CODE 201.015 and subject to Subsection (c),
render and sign: (A) a final order agreed to in writing as to both form and
substance by all parties; (B) a final default order; (C) a temporary order; or
(D) a final order in a case in which a party files an unrevoked waiver made in
accordance with Rule 119, Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, that waives notice
to the party of the final hearing or waives the party's appearance at the final

hearing; take action as necessary and proper for the efficient performance
of the associate judge's duties; and render and sign a final order if the
parties waive the right to a de novo hearing before the referring court under
Section FAMILY CODE 201.015 in writing before the start of a hearing
conducted by the associate judge.
Summary
An associate judge in Texas has the authority to conduct hearings, hear
evidence, and issue temporary orders. This includes the ability to regulate
all proceedings in a hearing before them. If Judge Kate Stone, as an
associate judge, refused to conduct a hearing on an emergency temporary
restraining order without a valid reason or order of referral limiting her
powers, it could be seen as a failure to perform her duties as outlined in the
Texas Family Code. This could potentially violate procedural law and due
process rights if the refusal was unjustified.
