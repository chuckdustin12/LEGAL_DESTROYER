Question
1. A father was ordered out of his home without any findings and without
issuing any protective order. No hearing was held, no evidence was
admitted, and no witnesses were called. The parties expressly agreed to
continue the case to acquire legal representation. He had four hours to
vacate. 2. At the next setting, parties acquired counsel, and the case was
delayed again because petitioner caused a delay for not hiring counsel until
the last second before the hearing in the lobby of the courtroom. 3. The
judge who ordered the respondent out of his home did so based on
knowingly fraudulent documents submitted by the petitioner, who went as
far as to claim there was an active order of protection in place with a finding
of family violence during the marriage which was knowingly false to waive
the 60-day waiver. 4. Father raised these allegations in his original answer,
which wasn't even considered by the Court. 5. At the third reset hearing, the
father's counsel drafted an "Agreed associate judge's report" and only gave
him the option of settling with one month back in the home. He refused. His
attorney then stated "i dont want to be here all day. we can come back later
and change things". 5. Left with no alternative, father signed the agreement
because he noticed the following provisions: "A typed written Order
conforming to this Report will follow within 20 days from the date this
Report is signed. The Temporary Order shall be prepared by DAN BACALIS .
Each attorney should approve the Order. The parties do not need to approve
the Order. The attorney reviewing the proposed Order shall have five (5)
days to do so. There arc no ten (10) day letters. If an agreement is not
reached, a Motion to Sign shall be filed and set within thirty (30) daysfrom
the signing of this Report. AGREED AS IP. FORM AND SUBSTANCE" 6.
Immediately after this was signed, father fired his attorney and proceeded
PRO-SE and filed an emergency motion. 7. Opposing counsel emailed father
and said she'd be filing a counter motion. 8. The emergency motion was
scheduled for a hearing on March 14, 2024, signed by the district judge. 9.
When arriving to court on March 14, which was well after the timeline
ordered in the prior feb 1 agreement, the opposing counsel, who was not
dan bacalis, handed him the reduced "temporary orders" which falsely
claimed a hearing occurred on Feb 1 for a motion for TRO, which the docket
has no notice of hearing for such a motion and this motion was not served to
the respondent whatsoever. 8. She then handed the judge a proposed order
denyting the emergency motion despite not even providing a response to the
motion or raising counterarguments. 9. The judge granted the proposed
order before the respondent could even review it, which was written in the
opposing counsel's handwriting. 10. The terms of the agreement had been
unilaterally changed to where there was a 10 day window where nobody
would occupy the home. 11. Father was denied summarily, was not afforded
an opporunity to present his unopposed motion, and the temporary orders
were rendered that expressly state: "Based on the signatures below, all
parties agree to the terms of this order" yet on the signature page both the
repsondent and his attorney that was suppoed to draft the reduced version
is missing. The judge rendered it anyway. EXPLAIN HOW THIS IS
EXTRINSIC FRAUD

Answer (Texas)
Short response
The described scenario constitutes extrinsic fraud because the father was
denied a fair opportunity to present his case due to fraudulent conduct by
the opposing party and procedural irregularities that prevented him from
fully litigating his rights, as recognized by Texas law. Extrinsic fraud occurs
when a party is kept from participating in the proceedings or is misled in a
way that undermines the judicial process, which is precisely what the facts
here demonstrate.
Summary
Extrinsic fraud, under Texas law, refers to wrongful conduct that prevents a
party from having a fair opportunity to present their case or defenses in
court, typically through deception, denial of notice, or manipulation of the
judicial process outside the adversarial proceedings. In the scenario
described, the father was ordered out of his home without a hearing, based
on fraudulent documents, and was repeatedly denied the opportunity to
present his case or respond to motions, all of which align with the
established definition of extrinsic fraud.
The actions of the petitioner and the court—such as submitting knowingly
false documents, denying the father notice and a hearing, and rendering
orders without proper procedure or signatures—constitute conduct that is
collateral to the issues being litigated and directly prevented the father from
fully participating in the proceedings. Texas courts have consistently held
that such conduct amounts to extrinsic fraud, which is grounds for setting
aside a judgment or order through a bill of review.
Background and Relevant Law
Legislative Framework
Under Texas law, temporary orders in family law cases are governed by Tex.
Fam. Code § 105.001. This statute allows courts to issue temporary orders
for the safety and welfare of the child, but generally requires notice and a
hearing before such orders are rendered, except in specific emergency
circumstances. Orders issued without notice and a hearing, outside of these
exceptions, violate procedural requirements and due process, especially
when they affect fundamental rights such as possession of the home.
Additionally, Tex. Pen. Code § 32.46 criminalizes the fraudulent securing of
document execution, including causing someone to sign a document
affecting property or legal rights without effective consent, with intent to
defraud or harm. This is relevant where court orders or agreements are
procured through deception or without proper consent.

Case Law
Texas courts have developed a robust body of law distinguishing between
intrinsic and extrinsic fraud in the context of attacking judgments. Only
extrinsic fraud—fraud that prevents a party from fully litigating their rights
or defenses—will support a bill of review to set aside a judgment.
Key authorities include:
In re Garcia: To succeed on a bill of review, a party must show a
meritorious defense, that they were prevented from presenting by the
fraud or wrongful act of the opposing party, and that this was not due
to their own fault. Only extrinsic fraud, which denies a party the
opportunity to fully litigate their rights, is sufficient (In re Garcia,
13-25-00219-CV (Tex. App. Jun 30, 2025)).
PNS Stores, Inc. v. Rivera: Extrinsic fraud is conduct that distorts the
judicial process by denying a party the opportunity to fully litigate their
rights, such as being misled or denied knowledge of the suit (PNS
Stores, Inc. v. Rivera, 379 S.W.3d 267 (Tex. 2012)).
Montgomery v. Kennedy: Extrinsic fraud is collateral to the issues
tried and prevents a real trial on the merits (Montgomery v. Kennedy,
669 S.W.2d 309 (Tex. 1984)).
King Ranch, Inc. v. Chapman: Only extrinsic fraud, not intrinsic
fraud (such as perjured testimony or fraudulent documents considered
by the court), supports a bill of review. Extrinsic fraud involves being
kept away from court, denied knowledge of the suit, or misled in a way
that prevents participation (King Ranch, Inc. v. Chapman, 118 S.W.3d
742 (Tex. 2003)).
Sotelo v. Scherr and Stiggers v. Washington Mutual Bank:
Extrinsic fraud includes wrongful conduct outside the trial, such as
preventing a party from attending court, making false promises, or
denying knowledge of the suit (Sotelo v. Scherr, 242 S.W.3d 823 (Tex.
App. 2007); Stiggers v. Washington Mutual Bank, No. 04-06-00575-CV
(Tex. App. Feb 07, 2007)).
O'Meara v. O'Meara: Examples of extrinsic fraud include keeping a
party away from court by false promises or keeping them ignorant of
the suit, or when an attorney betrays the client’s interests (O'Meara v.
O'Meara, 181 S.W.2d 891 (Tex. App. 1944)).
Ince v. Ince: Although this case was overruled by Ramsey v. State, 249
S.W.3d 568 (Tex. App. 2008) on unrelated grounds, its articulation of
extrinsic fraud as wrongful conduct outside the adversary trial, such as
keeping a party away from court or denying knowledge of the suit,
remains consistent with other authorities (Ince v. Ince, 58 S.W.3d 187
(Tex. App. 2001)).

Analysis
Application of Law to the Facts
The facts presented describe a series of procedural and substantive
irregularities that collectively deprived the father of a fair opportunity to
present his case:
No Hearing, No Evidence, No Findings: The father was ordered out
of his home without a hearing, without evidence being admitted, and
without witnesses. The parties had agreed to continue the case to
obtain counsel, yet the court issued an order requiring the father to
vacate within four hours. This lack of notice and opportunity to be
heard is a classic example of extrinsic fraud, as it denied the father the
chance to litigate his rights (PNS Stores, Inc. v. Rivera, 379 S.W.3d 267
(Tex. 2012); Montgomery v. Kennedy, 669 S.W.2d 309 (Tex. 1984)).
Fraudulent Documents and Misrepresentations: The petitioner
submitted documents falsely claiming the existence of an active
protective order and a finding of family violence, which were knowingly
untrue. The use of fraudulent documents to obtain a court order,
especially when the opposing party is not given a chance to contest
them, constitutes extrinsic fraud if it prevents a fair trial (King Ranch,
Inc. v. Chapman, 118 S.W.3d 742 (Tex. 2003); Bakali v. Bakali, 830 S.W.
2d 251 (Tex. App. 1992)). While fraudulent documents alone may be
intrinsic fraud if they are considered and could have been challenged at
trial, here the documents were used to procure an order without a
hearing or notice, making the fraud extrinsic.
Denial of Opportunity to Present Defenses: The father raised the
issue of fraud in his original answer, but the court did not consider it.
At subsequent hearings, procedural irregularities and the conduct of
both counsel and the court further prevented him from presenting his
case. For example, the "Agreed associate judge's report" was presented
as the only option, and the father was pressured to sign under duress,
with the promise that things could be changed later. Such conduct,
especially when combined with the attorney's lack of advocacy and the
court's failure to ensure a fair process, can amount to extrinsic fraud
(Layton v. Nationsbanc Mortg. Corp., 141 S.W.3d 760 (Tex. App. 2004); 
O'Meara v. O'Meara, 181 S.W.2d 891 (Tex. App. 1944)).
Procedural Irregularities and Unilateral Changes: The subsequent
handling of the emergency motion—where the opposing counsel
presented a proposed order denying the motion without providing a
response or allowing the father to review it, and the judge signed it
without the required signatures—further deprived the father of due
process. The court's acceptance of an order that falsely claimed a
hearing occurred, and that lacked the signatures of the respondent and
his attorney, is a procedural defect that prevented the father from
having his day in court (Stiggers v. Washington Mutual Bank, No.

04-06-00575-CV (Tex. App. Feb 07, 2007); Lawrence v. Lawrence, 911
S.W.2d 443 (Tex. App. 1995)).
Denial of Notice and Opportunity to Be Heard: The father was not
served with notice of the motion for temporary restraining order, and
the docket did not reflect any such hearing. Texas law requires notice
and a hearing before temporary orders are rendered, except in limited
emergency circumstances (Tex. Fam. Code § 105.001). The lack of
notice and the court's reliance on false representations deprived the
father of due process and the opportunity to contest the orders.
Attorney and Judicial Misconduct: The conduct of the father's own
attorney, who pressured him to settle and failed to advocate for his
interests, combined with the court's acceptance of orders without
proper procedure, further supports a finding of extrinsic fraud. Texas
courts have recognized that betrayal by one's attorney or collusion
between counsel and the court can constitute extrinsic fraud (Layton v.
Nationsbanc Mortg. Corp., 141 S.W.3d 760 (Tex. App. 2004); O'Meara v.
O'Meara, 181 S.W.2d 891 (Tex. App. 1944)).
Synthesis
The cumulative effect of these actions is that the father was systematically
denied the opportunity to fully litigate his rights and defenses. The
fraudulent conduct was not merely an issue that could have been addressed
at trial (intrinsic fraud), but rather conduct that occurred outside the
adversarial process and prevented a real trial on the merits (extrinsic fraud).
The court's reliance on false documents, the lack of notice and hearing, the
procedural irregularities, and the attorney's failure to advocate all
contributed to a process that was fundamentally unfair and deprived the
father of due process.
Texas courts have consistently held that such conduct constitutes extrinsic
fraud and is grounds for setting aside a judgment or order through a bill of
review (In re Garcia, 13-25-00219-CV (Tex. App. Jun 30, 2025); PNS Stores,
Inc. v. Rivera, 379 S.W.3d 267 (Tex. 2012); Montgomery v. Kennedy, 669 S.W.
2d 309 (Tex. 1984); King Ranch, Inc. v. Chapman, 118 S.W.3d 742 (Tex.
2003)).
Exceptions and Caveats
It is important to distinguish between extrinsic and intrinsic fraud. If the
fraudulent conduct consists solely of false documents or perjured testimony
that was or could have been addressed at trial, it is considered intrinsic
fraud and does not support a bill of review (King Ranch, Inc. v. Chapman,
118 S.W.3d 742 (Tex. 2003); Tice v. City of Pasadena, 767 S.W.2d 700 (Tex.
1989)). However, in this case, the fraudulent conduct prevented the father
from even having a trial or hearing, which is the hallmark of extrinsic fraud.
Additionally, a party seeking relief based on extrinsic fraud must show that
the fraud was not due to their own fault or negligence and that they have a
5.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
meritorious defense (In re Garcia, 13-25-00219-CV (Tex. App. Jun 30, 2025); 
Lambert v. Coachmen Industries of Texas, Inc., 761 S.W.2d 82 (Tex. App.
1988)). The facts suggest the father acted promptly and raised the issue at
the earliest opportunity, supporting the argument that he was not at fault.
Conclusion
The facts described constitute extrinsic fraud under Texas law because the
father was denied a fair opportunity to present his case due to fraudulent
conduct by the opposing party, procedural irregularities, and the court's
failure to provide notice and a hearing. This conduct was collateral to the
issues being litigated and prevented a real trial on the merits, fitting
squarely within the definition of extrinsic fraud as articulated by Texas
courts. As such, the father would have strong grounds to seek relief from the
orders through a bill of review or similar procedural mechanism. The most
crucial point is that extrinsic fraud is not about the merits of the underlying
dispute, but about the denial of a fair process, which is precisely what
occurred in this scenario.
Legal Authorities
Thomas v. 462 Thomas Family Props., LP, 559 S.W.3d 634 (Tex. App. 2018)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Specifically as to his request for an equitable bill of review, appellant
alleges: 'The misconduct of the presiding judge and opposing counsel
constitutes extrinsic fraud which denied [appellant] the right to fully and
fairly present his claims, deprived [appellant] of due process, and
fundamentally distorted the judicial process.' ... Taking appellant’s
allegations, together with inferences reasonably drawn from them, as true,
appellant’s petition for a bill of review complains he was denied the right to
a fair trial by a neutral and detached judge because the judge and an
attorney of record for the prevailing party had an undisclosed personal
relationship that was sufficient to 'constitute attorney and judicial
misconduct which destroyed the integrity of the proceedings leading to the
Judgment and denied [appellant] of his due process rights.'
Summary
Extrinsic fraud involves misconduct that prevents a party from fully and
fairly presenting their case, thereby violating due process rights. In the
provided case, the allegations of a personal relationship between the judge
and an attorney, which was undisclosed, were considered sufficient to claim
extrinsic fraud. This is relevant to the question as it provides a framework
for understanding how judicial and attorney misconduct can constitute
extrinsic fraud by distorting the judicial process and denying due process.

2012)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
A direct attack on 'a judgment on the basis of extrinsic fraud is allowed
because such fraud distorts the judicial process to such an extent that
confidence in the ability to discover the fraudulent conduct through the
regular adversarial process is undermined.' Browning, 165 S.W.3d at 348.
Extrinsic fraud is fraud that denies a litigant the opportunity to fully litigate
at trial all the rights or defenses that could have been asserted. King Ranch,
118 S.W.3d at 752. It occurs when a litigant has been misled by his
adversary by fraud or deception, or was denied knowledge of the suit.
Summary
Extrinsic fraud is defined as fraud that prevents a party from fully
participating in the litigation process, either by misleading them or by
denying them knowledge of the suit. In the situation described in the
question, the father was ordered out of his home without a hearing,
evidence, or witnesses, and based on fraudulent documents. This suggests
that he was denied the opportunity to fully litigate his rights, as he was
misled by the opposing party's fraudulent claims and the court's actions.
This aligns with the definition of extrinsic fraud provided in the passage, as
it involves deception that undermines the judicial process and prevents a
fair trial.
Montgomery v. Kennedy, 669 S.W.2d 309 (Tex. 1984)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
In relation to attacks on final judgments, fraud is classified as either
extrinsic or intrinsic. Only extrinsic fraud will entitle petitioners to bill of
review relief. Alexander v. Hagedorn, Id. at 574, 226 S.W.2d at 1001. We
have stated or expressly approved that extrinsic fraud is that fraud which
denies a losing litigant the opportunity to fully litigate his rights or defenses
upon trial. Id. Extrinsic fraud is 'collateral' fraud in the sense that it must be
collateral to the matter actually tried and not something which was actually
or potentially in issue in the trial. Crouch v. McGaw, 134 Tex. 633, 639, 138
S.W.2d 94, 97 (1940). Extrinsic fraud is conduct that prevents a real trial
upon the issues involved. O'Meara v. O'Meara, 181 S.W.2d 891, 893
(Tex.Civ.App.--San Antonio 1944, writ ref'd).

Summary
Extrinsic fraud is defined as fraud that prevents a party from fully litigating
their case, and it must be collateral to the issues actually tried. This means
that if a party was denied the opportunity to present their case or defenses
due to fraudulent actions that were not part of the issues being litigated, it
could be considered extrinsic fraud. In the situation described, the father
was ordered out of his home without a hearing, evidence, or witnesses, and
the judge acted on fraudulent documents. This could be seen as extrinsic
fraud because it denied the father the opportunity to fully litigate his rights
and defenses.
King Ranch, Inc. v. Chapman, 118 S.W.3d 742, 2003 WL 22025017 (Tex.
2003)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
Fraud in relation to attacks on final judgments is either extrinsic or intrinsic.
Only extrinsic fraud will support a bill of review. Tice v. City of Pasadena,
767 S.W.2d 700, 702 (Tex.1989). Extrinsic fraud is fraud that denied a party
the opportunity to fully litigate at trial all the rights or defenses that could
have been asserted. Id. Intrinsic fraud, by contrast, relates to the merits of
the issues that were presented and presumably were or should have been
settled in the former action. Id. Within that term are included such matters
as fraudulent instruments, perjured testimony, or any matter which was
actually presented to and considered by the trial court in rendering the
judgment assailed. Id. Such fraud will not support a bill of review, because
each party must guard against adverse findings on issues directly presented.
Id.; Alexander, 226 S.W.2d at 998.
Summary
Only extrinsic fraud, not intrinsic fraud, can support a bill of review, which is
relevant to the father's situation if he seeks to challenge the judgment.

and not something which was actually or potentially in issue. Montgomery,
669 S.W.2d at 312.
Summary
Extrinsic fraud involves wrongful conduct that prevents a party from fully
presenting their case or defenses in court. This type of fraud is considered
to occur outside the adversarial proceedings and is collateral to the issues
tried. In the situation described, the father was denied the opportunity to
fully litigate his rights due to fraudulent documents and actions by the
petitioner, which were not addressed in the court proceedings. This aligns
with the definition of extrinsic fraud as it involves conduct that occurred
outside the adversarial process and denied the father a fair opportunity to
present his case.
In re Interest of K.M.L., 443 S.W.3d 101 (Tex. 2014)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
Rule 245 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure provides that a trial court
“may set contested cases on written request of any party, or on the court's
own motion, with reasonable notice of not less than forty-five days to the
parties of a first setting for trial, or by agreement of the parties.” Tex.R. Civ.
P. 245. If a timely answer has been filed in a contested case or the defendant
has otherwise made an appearance, due process rights are violated when a
judgment is subsequently entered without the party having received notice
of the setting of the case, Peralta v. Heights Med. Ctr., 485 U.S. 80, 86–87,
108 S.Ct. 896, 99 L.Ed.2d 75 (1988), even when that party previously waived
notice of citation.
Summary
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 245 requires reasonable notice of not less than
forty-five days for the first setting of a contested case trial. If a party has
filed a timely answer or made an appearance, their due process rights are
violated if a judgment is entered without them receiving notice of the trial
setting. This is relevant to the question because it highlights a potential
procedural violation in the father's case, where he was allegedly not given
proper notice or opportunity to contest the orders against him.

Summary
Extrinsic fraud in Texas is defined as wrongful conduct that occurs outside
the adversarial proceedings and prevents a party from fully litigating their
case. This is distinct from intrinsic fraud, which involves issues that were or
could have been addressed in the original proceedings. The situation
described in the question involves several elements that could be considered
extrinsic fraud: the father was ordered out of his home without a hearing or
evidence, fraudulent documents were submitted, and the father was not
given an opportunity to present his case or respond to motions. These
actions could be seen as denying him the opportunity to fully litigate his
rights, fitting the definition of extrinsic fraud.
Alderson v. Alderson, 352 S.W.3d 875 (Tex. App. 2011)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Extrinsic fraud is fraud that denied the petitioner the opportunity to litigate
fully all the rights or defenses that could have been asserted at trial. See
King Ranch, 118 S.W.3d at 752. Such fraud must be purposeful in nature.
See Layton, 141 S.W.3d at 763. There must be proof of some deception
practiced by the respondent, collateral to the issues in the case. See King
Ranch, 118 S.W.3d at 753; Bakali v. Bakali, 830 S.W.2d 251, 255 (Tex.App.-
Dallas 1992, no writ).
Summary
Extrinsic fraud involves purposeful deception that prevents a party from
fully litigating their case. It requires proof of deception that is collateral to
the issues in the case. In the situation described, the father was denied the
opportunity to present his case fully due to fraudulent documents and
procedural irregularities, which could be considered extrinsic fraud if it can
be shown that these actions were purposeful and collateral to the main
issues.

In a petition for bill of review, the petitioner must allege extrinsic fraud as
distinguished from intrinsic fraud. See Nelson v. Chaney, 193 S.W.3d 161, ___
(Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] March 23, 2006, no pet. h.); Tice v. City of

S.W.3d 187, 190 (Tex.App.-Waco 2001, no pet.) (citing Tice, 767 S.W.2d at
700). Extrinsic fraud is fraud that denies a party the opportunity to fully
litigate at trial all the rights or defenses that he could have asserted. Tice,
767 S.W.2d at 702. Extrinsic fraud is 'wrongful conduct practiced outside of
the adversary trial—such as keeping a party away from court, making false
promises of compromise, denying a party knowledge of the suit—that affects
the manner in which the judgment is procured.' Ince, 58 S.W.3d at 190
(citing Alexander v. Hagedorn, 148 Tex. 565, 574, 226 S.W.2d 996, 1002

collateral to the matter actually tried and not something which was actually
or potentially in issue in the trial.'
Summary
Clear definition of extrinsic fraud, which is relevant to the question.
Extrinsic fraud involves wrongful conduct that prevents a party from fully
participating in a trial, such as being kept away from court or being denied
knowledge of the suit. This is distinct from intrinsic fraud, which involves
issues that were or could have been addressed during the trial.

Fraud which will justify the setting aside of a final judgment in a bill of
review proceeding must be extrinsic, and not intrinsic. ... 'But the fraud
which will authorize vacation by the court of its former judgment in such
case must be what has been termed 'extrinsic fraud.' By that is meant fraud
by the other party to the suit which has prevented the losing party either
from knowing about his rights or defenses, or from having a fair opportunity
of presenting them upon the trial. Such, for instance, as where he has been
misled by his adversary by fraud or deception, did not know of the suit, or
was betrayed by his attorney. In other words, fraud which denied him the
opportunity to fully litigate upon the trial all the rights or defenses he was
entitled to assert.. . .'
Summary
The passage defines extrinsic fraud as actions by the opposing party that
prevent the losing party from knowing their rights or having a fair
opportunity to present their case. This includes being misled by the
adversary or being betrayed by one's attorney. In the situation described,
the father was allegedly misled by fraudulent documents and was not given
a fair opportunity to present his case, as no hearing was held, and his
original answer was not considered. These actions align with the definition
of extrinsic fraud as they potentially denied him the opportunity to fully
litigate his rights.
Amanda v. Montgomery, 877 S.W.2d 482 (Tex. App. 1994)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
For the purposes of a bill of review proceeding, there are two kinds of fraud:
extrinsic and intrinsic. Montgomery v. Kennedy, 669 S.W.2d 309, 312 (Tex.
1984); ... Extrinsic fraud is fraud committed by the other party that: 1.
prevents the losing party from either (a) knowing about a right or defense

=== PAGE 13 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
he is entitled to assert, or (b) having a fair opportunity to present such a
right or defense at trial; 2. is committed outside of the trial; ... Only the
commission of extrinsic fraud will afford relief to a bill of review
complainant. Montgomery, 669 S.W.2d at 312; ... Fraud is extrinsic when it is
'collateral to the matter tried and not something which actually or
potentially was in issue in the [original] trial.'
Summary
Extrinsic fraud involves actions by the opposing party that prevent a fair
trial by either concealing rights or defenses or by actions outside the trial.
This is relevant to the father's situation as he was allegedly misled by
fraudulent documents and denied a fair opportunity to present his case,
which aligns with the definition of extrinsic fraud.
Sotelo v. Scherr, 242 S.W.3d 823 (Tex. App. 2007)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Absent a showing of extrinsic fraud, a bill of review must be filed within four
years of the date of the judgment which the proponent seeks to set aside. ...
'Extrinsic fraud' is fraud that denied a party the opportunity to fully litigate
all the rights and defenses that the party was entitled to assert at trial. ... It
is wrongful conduct practiced outside the trial, such as preventing a party
from going to court, making false promises of compromise, or denying a
party knowledge of the suit.
Summary
Extrinsic fraud involves wrongful conduct outside the trial that prevents a
party from fully litigating their case. This includes actions like preventing a
party from attending court, making false promises, or denying knowledge of
the suit. In the situation described, the father was ordered out of his home
without a hearing, evidence, or witnesses, and based on fraudulent
documents. This could be seen as extrinsic fraud because it denied him the
opportunity to fully litigate his rights and defenses.
Lawrence v. Lawrence, 911 S.W.2d 443 (Tex. App. 1995)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Extrinsic fraud is a wrongful act of the opposing party that prevents the
losing party from either knowing about his rights or defenses or from having
a fair opportunity of presenting them at trial. Alexander v. Hagedorn, supra.

Extrinsic fraud is collateral to the matter tried and not something that was
actually or potentially in issue at trial. Law v. Law, 792 S.W.2d 150, 153
(Tex.App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 1990, writ denied).
Summary
Extrinsic fraud involves actions by the opposing party that prevent the other
party from knowing their rights or having a fair opportunity to present their
case. In the situation described, the father was ordered out of his home
without a hearing, evidence, or witnesses, and based on fraudulent
documents. This aligns with the definition of extrinsic fraud as it suggests
the father was deprived of a fair opportunity to present his case due to the
opposing party's wrongful actions.
In re Garcia, 13-25-00219-CV (Tex. App. Jun 30, 2025)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
A bill of review plaintiff must ordinarily plead and prove: (1) a meritorious
defense to the underlying cause of action; (2) which the plaintiff was
prevented from making by the fraud, accident, or wrongful act of the
opposing party, or official mistake; (3) unmixed with any fault or negligence
on his or her own part. ... In this regard, though fraud may be either
extrinsic or intrinsic, only extrinsic fraud will support a bill of review.
'Extrinsic fraud is fraud that denied a party the opportunity to fully litigate
at trial all the rights or defenses that could have been asserted.'
Summary
Framework for understanding how extrinsic fraud is defined and what must
be proven in a bill of review.
Bettwieser v. Jeffery, No. 05-18-01266-CV (Tex. App. Aug 03, 2020)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Extrinsic fraud is conduct that denied a litigant the opportunity to litigate
rights or defenses that could have been asserted at trial because he was
'misled by his adversary by fraud or deception, or was denied knowledge of
the suit.' PNS Stores, Inc. v. Rivera, 379 S.W.3d 267, 275 (Tex. 2012).
Extrinsic fraud 'prevents a real trial upon the issues involved.' Montgomery
v. Kennedy, 669 S.W.2d 309, 313 (Tex. 1984). 'Extrinsic fraud is 'collateral'
fraud in the sense that it must be collateral to the matter actually tried and

=== PAGE 15 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
not something which was actually or potentially in issue in the trial.' Id. at
312.
Summary
Extrinsic fraud involves actions that prevent a party from having a fair
opportunity to present their case, often through deception or denial of
knowledge about the proceedings. This is distinct from intrinsic fraud, which
involves issues that were or could have been addressed during the trial. In
the situation described, the father's lack of opportunity to present his case,
the fraudulent documents, and the misleading actions by the opposing
counsel could be considered extrinsic fraud as they potentially denied him a
fair trial.
Chapman v. King Ranch, 41 S.W.3d 693 (Tex. App. 2001)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Fraud, in relation to attacks on judgments, is either extrinsic or intrinsic,
and only extrinsic fraud will support a bill of review. Id. Extrinsic fraud is
fraud that denied a party the opportunity to fully litigate at trial all the
rights or defenses that the party was entitled to assert. Tice v. City of
Pasadena, 767 S.W.2d 700, 702-04 (Tex. 1989). 'Extrinsic fraud is 'collateral'
fraud in the sense that it must be collateral to the matter actually tried and
not something which was actually or potentially in issue in the trial.'
Montgomery v. Kennedy, 669 S.W.2d 309, 312 (Tex. 1984).
Summary
Extrinsic fraud is defined as fraud that prevents a party from fully litigating
their rights or defenses in a trial. It is considered collateral to the issues
actually tried, meaning it is not directly related to the matters that were or
could have been addressed in the trial. This is relevant to the question
because the father's situation involves allegations of fraudulent actions that
prevented him from fully presenting his case, such as the submission of
fraudulent documents and the lack of a proper hearing.
Crouch v. Panama Refining Co. 134 Tex. 633
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
Fraud is classified as intrinsic or extrinsic. Included in the term 'intrinsic
fraud' are false testimony, fraudulent instruments, and any fraudulent
matter that was presented and considered in rendering judgment. Intrinsic

=== PAGE 16 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
fraud does not furnish a ground, in an independent suit brought for that
purpose, for setting aside a judgment. Fraud must be extrinsic to justify the
setting aside of a judgment, and must be collateral to the matter tried, and
not something which was actually or potentially in issue in the trial; unless
the presentation of such defense was prevented by fraud, accident, or act of
the opposing party, without fault or negligence of the party against whom
the judgment was rendered.
Summary
The passage distinguishes between intrinsic and extrinsic fraud. Intrinsic
fraud involves fraudulent actions that were part of the trial process, such as
false testimony or fraudulent documents, and does not provide grounds for
setting aside a judgment. Extrinsic fraud, on the other hand, involves actions
that prevent a party from fully participating in the trial, such as being misled
or deceived by the opposing party, and can justify setting aside a judgment.
In the situation described, the father's inability to present his case due to
fraudulent documents and the lack of a fair hearing could be considered
extrinsic fraud, as it prevented him from having a fair opportunity to present
his defense.
Lambert v. Coachmen Industries of Texas, Inc., 761 S.W.2d 82 (Tex. App.
1988)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
A bill of review petitioner must ordinarily plead and prove (1) a meritorious
defense to the cause of action alleged to support the judgment, (2) that he
was prevented from making by the fraud, accident or wrongful act of his
opponent, (3) unmixed with any fault or negligence of his own... Only
extrinsic fraud will entitle a petitioner to relief in a bill of review proceeding.
Montgomery v. Kennedy, 669 S.W.2d 309, 312 (Tex.1984)... Extrinsic fraud
warranting the setting aside of a final judgment has been defined as 'that
fraud which denies a losing litigant the opportunity to fully litigate his rights
or defenses upon trial.'
Summary
The passage from Lambert v. Coachmen Industries of Texas, Inc. provides a
framework for understanding extrinsic fraud in the context of a bill of review
in Texas. It defines extrinsic fraud as actions that prevent a party from fully
litigating their case, such as fraudulent actions by the opposing party that
deny the opportunity to present a defense. In the situation described, the
father was denied the opportunity to fully litigate his rights due to
fraudulent documents and actions by the opposing party, which aligns with
the definition of extrinsic fraud provided in the passage.

O'Meara v. O'Meara, 181 S.W.2d 891 (Tex. App. 1944)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
‘Extrinsic fraud’ or ‘collateral fraud’ exists when unsuccessful party is kept
away from the court by a false promise of compromise or purposely keeping
him in ignorance of the suit, or when an attorney fraudulently pretends to
represent a party and connives at his defeat, or corruptly sells out his
client’s interests, and such fraudulent acts in fact prevent the unsuccessful
party from having a trial.
Summary
Extrinsic fraud involves actions that prevent a party from having a fair trial
or presenting their case. This includes being kept away from court by false
promises or being kept in ignorance of the suit. In the situation described,
the father was ordered out of his home without a hearing, based on
fraudulent documents, and was not given a fair opportunity to present his
case. These actions align with the definition of extrinsic fraud as they
prevented him from having a fair trial.
Law v. Law, 792 S.W.2d 150 (Tex. App. 1990)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Extrinsic fraud is fraud which is collateral to the matter tried, and not
something that was actually or potentially in issue in the trial. Crouch, 134
Tex. at 639, 138 S.W.2d at 97. Extrinsic fraud is the type of fraud that
prevents the party from litigating the issues; for example, if a party did not
know of the suit.
Summary
Legal definition of extrinsic fraud that can be applied to assess whether the
father's situation fits this definition.
Tice v. City of Pasadena, 767 S.W.2d 700 (Tex. 1989)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
Fraud in its relation to attacks on final judgments is either extrinsic or
intrinsic. Only extrinsic fraud will support a bill of review. 'Extrinsic fraud' is

=== PAGE 18 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
fraud which denied a party the opportunity to fully litigate upon the trial all
the rights or defenses he was entitled to assert. 'Intrinsic fraud,' by contrast,
relates to the merits of the issues which were presented and presumably
were or should have been settled in the former action. Within that term are
included such matters as fraudulent instruments, perjured testimony, or any
matter which was actually presented to and considered by the trial court in
rendering the judgment assailed. Such fraud will not support a bill of review,
for each party must guard against adverse findings upon issues directly
presented.
Summary
The passage distinguishes between extrinsic and intrinsic fraud. Extrinsic
fraud is defined as fraud that prevents a party from fully litigating their
rights or defenses, which is necessary to support a bill of review. Intrinsic
fraud, on the other hand, involves issues that were or should have been
addressed in the original trial, such as fraudulent documents or perjured
testimony. The situation described involves allegations of fraudulent
documents and a lack of opportunity for the father to present his case,
which aligns with the definition of extrinsic fraud as it suggests he was
denied the opportunity to fully litigate his rights.
Ince v. Ince, 58 S.W.3d 187 (Tex. App. 2001)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Extrinsic fraud, on the other hand, is wrongful conduct practiced outside of
the adversary trial such as keeping a party away from court, making false
promises of compromise, denying a party knowledge of the suit that affects
the manner in which the judgment is procured. Alexander v. Hagedorn, 226
S.W.2d 996, 1002 (Tex. 1950). Only extrinsic fraud supports a bill of review.
Tice, 767 S.W.2d at 702.
Summary
Extrinsic fraud involves wrongful conduct that prevents a party from fully
participating in the legal process, such as being kept away from court or
being misled about the proceedings. In the situation described, the father
was ordered out of his home without a hearing, based on fraudulent
documents, and was not given an opportunity to present his case. These
actions could be considered extrinsic fraud because they involve conduct
outside the trial process that affected the fairness of the proceedings.
Nelson v. Chaney, 193 S.W.3d 161 (Tex. App. 2006)
Texas Court of Appeals

Extract
Only 'extrinsic fraud' will support a bill of review. See Tice v. City of
Pasadena, 767 S.W.2d 700, 702 (Tex.1989); Ince v. Ince, 58 S.W.3d 187, 190
(Tex.App.-Waco 2001, no pet.). Extrinsic fraud is fraud that is collateral to
the matter being tried and prevents a litigant from having a fair opportunity
to assert his rights at trial. Ince, 58 S.W.3d at 190. Conversely, 'intrinsic
fraud' relates to matters that could have been litigated in the initial action,
including fraudulent instruments and perjured testimony. Id.
Summary
Extrinsic fraud is defined as fraud that is collateral to the matter being tried
and prevents a litigant from having a fair opportunity to assert his rights at
trial. This is distinct from intrinsic fraud, which involves issues that could
have been addressed during the original trial, such as fraudulent documents
or false testimony. In the situation described, the father's inability to present
his case due to fraudulent documents and the lack of a fair hearing could be
considered extrinsic fraud, as it prevented him from asserting his rights.
Bakali v. Bakali, 830 S.W.2d 251 (Tex. App. 1992)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
In order to set aside a judgment because of fraud of the opposing party, the
fraud must be extrinsic and not intrinsic. Extrinsic fraud requires proof of
some deception practiced by the adverse party, collateral to the issues in the
case, which prevents the petitioner from fully presenting his claim or
defense in the underlying action.
Summary
Definition of extrinsic fraud, which is necessary to understand how the
situation described in the question could be considered extrinsic fraud.
Extrinsic fraud involves deception by the opposing party that is collateral to
the issues in the case and prevents a party from fully presenting their case.
In the situation described, the father was allegedly prevented from fully
presenting his case due to fraudulent documents and actions by the
opposing party, which could be considered extrinsic fraud.
Tex. Fam. Code § 105.001 Tex. Fam. Code § 105.001 Temporary Orders
Before Final Order

=== PAGE 20 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
In a suit, the court may make a temporary order, including the modification
of a prior temporary order, for the safety and welfare of the child, including
an order: ... restraining a party from disturbing the peace of the child or
another party; ... (b) Except as provided by Subsection (c), temporary
restraining orders and temporary injunctions under this section shall be
granted without the necessity of an affidavit or verified pleading stating
specific facts showing that immediate and irreparable injury, loss, or damage
will result before notice can be served and a hearing can be held. Except as
provided by Subsection (h), an order may not be rendered under Subsection
(a), , or except after notice and a hearing.
Summary
Orders should not be rendered without notice and a hearing unless specific
exceptions apply, such as emergency orders sought by a governmental
entity. This is relevant to the question because it highlights procedural
requirements that may not have been followed in the described scenario,
potentially constituting extrinsic fraud if the father was denied the
opportunity to be heard or if fraudulent documents were used to obtain the
order.
Tex. Pen. Code § 32.46 Tex. Pen. Code § 32.46 Fraudulent Securing of
Document Execution
Extract
A person commits an offense if the person, with the intent to defraud or
harm any person: causes another person, without that person's effective
consent, to sign or execute any document affecting property or service or
the pecuniary interest of any person; or causes a public servant, without the
public servant's effective consent, to file or record any purported judgment
or other document purporting to memorialize or evidence an act, an order, a
directive, or process of: (A) a purported court that is not expressly created
or established under the constitution or the laws of this state or of the
United States; (B) a purported judicial entity that is not expressly created or
established under the constitution or laws of this state or of the United
States; or (C) a purported judicial officer of a purported court or purported
judicial entity described by Paragraph (A) or (B).
Summary
The passage addresses the fraudulent securing of document execution,
which involves causing someone to sign or execute a document without
effective consent, with the intent to defraud or harm. This is relevant to the
question as it involves allegations of fraudulent documents being used in
court proceedings, which could be considered extrinsic fraud if it led to a
judgment or order being issued without proper consent or knowledge.
