Question
Defendants Myers and Branthoover coordinated and planned the fraudulent
acts, including wire fraud, money laundering, and obstruction, as part of an
ongoing scheme. 18 U.S.C. § 1349 criminalizes attempts and conspiracies to
commit wire fraud, and 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d) prohibits conspiracy to violate
RICO. The coordinated planning and execution of multiple predicate acts by
the defendants constitutes conspiracy to commit fraud and racketeering
under federal law.
Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
The coordinated planning and execution of multiple predicate acts by Myers
and Branthoover, including wire fraud, money laundering, and obstruction,
constitutes a conspiracy to commit fraud and racketeering under federal
law. Both 18 U.S.C. § 1349 and 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d) provide statutorily
defined grounds for prosecuting such coordinated fraudulent schemes.
Summary
Under federal law, when individuals coordinate and plan fraudulent acts as
part of an ongoing scheme, they may be liable for conspiracy charges under
both 18 U.S.C. § 1349 (conspiracy to commit wire fraud) and 18 U.S.C. §
1962(d) (conspiracy to violate RICO). The legal framework supporting this
conclusion is found in the statutory provisions themselves, which explicitly
criminalize conspiracies to commit wire fraud and to violate RICO's
substantive provisions, as well as extensive case law interpreting and
applying these statutes.
The case law establishes that for a RICO conspiracy under § 1962(d),
prosecutors must prove an agreement to participate in an enterprise's
affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity, which requires at least two
predicate acts. For wire fraud conspiracy under § 1349, prosecutors must
establish that the defendants knowingly agreed to participate in a fraudulent
scheme where the use of interstate wires was reasonably foreseeable. The
coordinated planning and execution of multiple predicate acts by Myers and
Branthoover - specifically wire fraud, money laundering, and obstruction -
falls squarely within the conduct prohibited by these conspiracy statutes.

Legislation
The analysis of whether the coordinated planning and execution of multiple
predicate acts by defendants Myers and Branthoover constitutes conspiracy

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
to commit fraud and racketeering begins with the relevant statutory
framework.
18 U.S.C. § 1349 - Attempt and Conspiracy
18 U.S.C. § 1349 explicitly criminalizes attempts and conspiracies to commit
wire fraud. The statute provides: "Any person who attempts or conspires to
commit any offense under this chapter shall be subject to the same penalties
as those prescribed for the offense, the commission of which was the object
of the attempt or conspiracy." 18 U.S.C. § 1349 Attempt and Conspiracy, 18
U.S.C. § 1349. This provision directly establishes that individuals who
conspire to commit wire fraud are subject to the same penalties as those
who actually commit the offense.
18 U.S.C. § 1962(d) - RICO Conspiracy
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) includes a
specific provision prohibiting conspiracy to violate its substantive provisions. 
18 U.S.C. § 1962(d) states: "It shall be unlawful for any person to conspire to
violate any of the provisions of subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section." 18
U.S.C. § 1962 Prohibited Activities, 18 U.S.C. § 1962. This means that it is
unlawful to conspire to engage in, conduct, or participate in an enterprise's
affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.
18 U.S.C. § 1961 - Definitions
To understand the scope of RICO conspiracy charges, it is essential to
examine how the law defines key terms. Under 18 U.S.C. § 1961,
"racketeering activity" includes a range of specified criminal acts, including:
"(B) any act which is indictable under any of the following provisions of title
18, United States Code: ... section 1343 (relating to wire fraud), ... section
1503 (relating to obstruction of justice), ... section 1956 (relating to the
laundering of monetary instruments)..." 18 U.S.C. § 1961 Definitions, 18
U.S.C. § 1961.
The statute further defines a "pattern of racketeering activity" as requiring
"at least two acts of racketeering activity, one of which occurred after the
effective date of this chapter and the last of which occurred within ten years
(excluding any period of imprisonment) after the commission of a prior act
of racketeering activity" 18 U.S.C. § 1961 Definitions, 18 U.S.C. § 1961.
18 U.S.C. § 1956 - Laundering of Monetary Instruments
Money laundering, one of the predicate acts allegedly committed by Myers
and Branthoover, is defined in 18 U.S.C. § 1956, which provides:
"Whoever, knowing that the property involved in a financial transaction
represents the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity, conducts or
attempts to conduct such a financial transaction which in fact involves the
proceeds of specified unlawful activity... shall be sentenced to a fine of not

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
more than $500,000 or twice the value of the property involved in the
transaction, whichever is greater, or imprisonment for not more than twenty
years, or both." 18 U.S.C. § 1956 Laundering of Monetary Instruments, 18
U.S.C. § 1956.
The statute further specifies that "a financial transaction shall be considered
to be one involving the proceeds of specified unlawful activity if it is part of
a set of parallel or dependent transactions, any one of which involves the
proceeds of specified unlawful activity, and all of which are part of a single
plan or arrangement." 18 U.S.C. § 1956 Laundering of Monetary
Instruments, 18 U.S.C. § 1956.
Case Law
Elements of RICO Conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d)
Courts have consistently interpreted § 1962(d) to require specific elements
for a RICO conspiracy conviction. In Said v. Chojnacki, (N.D. Ill. Dec. 6,
2023), the court explained that to state a claim under § 1962(d), a plaintiff
"must allege that the defendant (1) agreed to maintain an interest in or
control of an enterprise, or to participate in an enterprise's affairs, (2)
through a pattern of racketeering activity, and (3) that the defendant agreed
that some member of the conspiracy (not necessarily the defendant herself)
would commit at least two predicate acts in furtherance of those goals."
Similarly, Levin v. Javeri (In re Firestar Diamond, Inc.), 18-10509 (SHL), Adv.
20-01054 (SHL) (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. Oct 13, 2023) stated that separate from the
elements of a substantive RICO violation, RICO conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. §
1962(d) requires proof "(a) of an agreement to join a racketeering scheme,
(b) of the defendant's knowing engagement in the scheme with the intent
that its overall goals be effectuated, and (c) that the scheme involved, or by
agreement between any members of the conspiracy was intended to involve,
two or more predicate acts of racketeering."
The Supreme Court, in Salinas v. U.S., 522 U.S. 52, 118 S.Ct. 469, 139 L.Ed.
2d 352 (1997), established that to be convicted of conspiracy to violate RICO
under § 1962(d), "the conspirator need not himself have committed or
agreed to commit the two or more predicate acts, such as bribery, requisite
for a substantive RICO offense under § 1962(c)." The Court further explained
that "Section 1962(d)—which forbids 'any person to conspire to violate' §
1962(c)—is even more comprehensive than the general conspiracy provision
applicable to federal crimes, § 371, since it contains no requirement of an
overt or specific act to effect the conspiracy's object."
The Court in Salinas also clarified the nature of conspiracy: "A conspiracy
may exist even if a conspirator does not agree to commit or facilitate each
and every part of the substantive offense... The partners in the criminal plan
must agree to pursue the same criminal objective and may divide up the
work, yet each is responsible for the acts of each other." Salinas v. U.S., 522
U.S. 52, 118 S.Ct. 469, 139 L.Ed.2d 352 (1997).

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
This interpretation was reaffirmed in United States v. Zemlyansky, 908 F.3d
1 (2nd Cir. 2018), which held that "RICO conspiracy requires proof that the
defendant 'agree[d] to conduct or to participate in the conduct of [an]
enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.'" To prove the
pattern element, "the government must show that two or more 'predicate
acts were, or were intended to be, committed as part of [the] conspiracy.'"
Requirements for Conspiracy to Commit Wire Fraud under 18 U.S.C. §
1349
The elements required to prove a conspiracy to commit wire fraud were
outlined in United States v. Ruan, 966 F.3d 1101 (11th Cir. 2020). The court
stated that to prove such a conspiracy, "the government need not
demonstrate an agreement specifically to use the interstate wires to further
the scheme to defraud." Instead, "it is enough to prove that the defendant
knowingly and voluntarily agreed to participate in a scheme to defraud and
that the use of the interstate wires in furtherance of the scheme was
reasonably foreseeable."
It is important to note that United States v. Ruan, 966 F.3d 1101 (11th Cir.
2020) was subsequently vacated by Ling Cui v. United States. However, the
specific legal principle regarding the elements of wire fraud conspiracy
remains valid as it has been consistently applied in other cases and is
consistent with the statutory text of § 1349.
Relationship Between Mail/Wire Fraud and RICO
Secondary materials clarify the relationship between mail/wire fraud and
RICO violations. As explained in Mail and Wire Fraud (July 1, 2022), "Mail
and wire fraud are predicate felonies under the Racketeer Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations Act ("RICO") and are specified as unlawful activity for
purposes of the federal money laundering statutes."
Similarly, another source confirms that prosecutors have used mail and wire
fraud statutes "to prosecute money laundering and Racketeer Influenced
and Corrupt Organizations Act ('RICO') violations. A violation of [sections]
1341 or [sections] 1343 can provide the unlawful act necessary to establish
a RICO or money laundering violation." Mail and wire fraud (June 22, 1999).
The Enterprise Requirement
The Supreme Court in United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 101 S.Ct.
2524, 69 L.Ed.2d 246 (1981) explained that securing a conviction under
RICO requires proving "both the existence of an 'enterprise' and the
connected 'pattern of racketeering activity.'" The enterprise is defined as "an
entity, for present purposes a group of persons associated together for a
common purpose of engaging in a course of conduct." This is "proved by
evidence of an ongoing organization, formal or informal, and by evidence
that the various associates function as a continuing unit."

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
It should be noted that United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 101 S.Ct.
2524, 69 L.Ed.2d 246 (1981) was abrogated by United States v. Lane, 474
U.S. 438, 106 S.Ct. 725, 88 L.Ed.2d 814 (1986). However, Lane addressed
issues related to misjoinder of defendants and did not overturn Turkette's
core holding regarding the definition of an enterprise under RICO, which
remains valid law.
In Boyle v. United States, 129 S.Ct. 2237, 173 L.Ed.2d 1265, 556 U.S. 938,
77 USLW 4474 (2009), the Supreme Court further clarified that an
"enterprise" under RICO need not have a formal structure. The Court held
that evidence was sufficient to prove a RICO violation when it demonstrated
that the participants "included a core group, along with others recruited
from time to time; and that the core group was loosely and informally
organized, lacking a leader, hierarchy, or any long-term master plan."
Pattern of Racketeering Activity
Multiple cases emphasize the requirement of a pattern of racketeering
activity for RICO violations. In U.S. v. Goldin Industries, Inc., 219 F.3d 1271
(11th Cir. 2000), the court explained that a "'pattern' of racketeering activity
requires that a defendant commit two acts of racketeering activity within a
ten-year period."
The relationship between predicate acts was discussed in Schwamborn v.
U.S., 507 F.Supp.2d 229 (E.D. N.Y. 2007), which noted that to establish a
RICO violation, the government must prove that the alleged predicate acts
were "related," meaning they shared "the same or similar purposes, results,
participants, victims, or methods of commission, or otherwise are
interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and [were] not isolated
events."
Analysis
Applicability of 18 U.S.C. § 1349 to Myers and
Branthoover's Conduct
Based on the provided statutory language and case law, it is clear that 18
U.S.C. § 1349 criminalizes conspiracies to commit wire fraud. As stated in 18
U.S.C. § 1349 Attempt and Conspiracy, 18 U.S.C. § 1349, "Any person who
attempts or conspires to commit any offense under this chapter shall be
subject to the same penalties as those prescribed for the offense, the
commission of which was the object of the attempt or conspiracy."
The coordination and planning of fraudulent acts by Myers and Branthoover,
specifically including wire fraud, falls squarely within the conduct prohibited
by § 1349. Under the standard articulated in United States v. Ruan, 966 F.3d
1101 (11th Cir. 2020), the government would need to prove that Myers and
Branthoover "knowingly and voluntarily agreed to participate in a scheme to
defraud and that the use of the interstate wires in furtherance of the scheme
was reasonably foreseeable." The allegation that they "coordinated and

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
planned" the fraudulent acts strongly suggests the existence of such an
agreement.
Real-world application of § 1349 in similar circumstances can be seen in
cases like United States v. Ologeanu, No. 5:18-CR-81-REW-MAS (E.D. Ky. Apr
04, 2020), where a defendant was charged with conspiracy to commit wire
fraud under § 1349 as part of a broad online fraud scheme that also involved
money laundering.
Applicability of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d) to Myers and
Branthoover's Conduct
The coordinated planning and execution of multiple predicate acts by Myers
and Branthoover also constitutes a conspiracy to violate RICO under 18
U.S.C. § 1962(d). The statute explicitly makes it "unlawful for any person to
conspire to violate any of the provisions of subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this
section." 18 U.S.C. § 1962 Prohibited Activities, 18 U.S.C. § 1962.
To establish a RICO conspiracy under § 1962(d), several elements must be
proven:
Agreement to Participate in an Enterprise: As explained in Said v.
Chojnacki (N.D. Ill. Dec. 6, 2023), the defendant must have "agreed to
maintain an interest in or control of an enterprise, or to participate in
an enterprise's affairs." The coordination between Myers and
Branthoover suggests the existence of such an agreement.
Through a Pattern of Racketeering Activity: This requires showing
that the defendants agreed to conduct the enterprise's affairs through
multiple predicate acts. Under 18 U.S.C. § 1961 Definitions, 18 U.S.C. §
1961, wire fraud, obstruction of justice, and money laundering all
qualify as "racketeering activity."
Agreement to Commit Predicate Acts: As held in Salinas v. U.S., 522
U.S. 52, 118 S.Ct. 469, 139 L.Ed.2d 352 (1997), the defendants need
not have personally committed or agreed to commit the predicate acts,
as long as they "knew about and agreed to facilitate the scheme." The
allegation that Myers and Branthoover "coordinated and planned" the
fraudulent acts suggests such knowledge and agreement.
The Predicate Acts as Part of a Pattern
The facts indicate that Myers and Branthoover engaged in multiple
predicate acts: wire fraud, money laundering, and obstruction. Under 18
U.S.C. § 1961 Definitions, 18 U.S.C. § 1961, these all qualify as "racketeering
activity." To constitute a "pattern," at least two such acts are required, which
is satisfied by the three types of activity alleged.
The relatedness of these acts is also important. As noted in Schwamborn v.
U.S., 507 F.Supp.2d 229 (E.D. N.Y. 2007), predicate acts must share "the
same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of
commission, or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics
1. 
2. 
3. 

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
and [were] not isolated events." The characterization of these acts as "part
of an ongoing scheme" suggests they meet this relatedness requirement.
The Enterprise Element
The enterprise element is also satisfied by Myers and Branthoover's alleged
conduct. As clarified in Boyle v. United States, 129 S.Ct. 2237, 173 L.Ed.2d
1265, 556 U.S. 938, 77 USLW 4474 (2009), an enterprise can be "loosely and
informally organized, lacking a leader, hierarchy, or any long-term master
plan." The coordination between Myers and Branthoover, even without a
formal structure, could constitute an "enterprise" under this definition.
The Interrelationship of Wire Fraud, Money Laundering,
and RICO
Secondary materials emphasize the close relationship between wire fraud,
money laundering, and RICO violations. As explained in Mail and Wire Fraud
(July 1, 2022), wire fraud is a predicate felony under RICO and specified
unlawful activity for purposes of money laundering statutes. This means that
the wire fraud allegedly committed by Myers and Branthoover can serve as
both a predicate act for RICO purposes and the underlying unlawful activity
for money laundering charges.
Similarly, Mail & wire fraud (Jan. 1, 1997) notes that mail and wire fraud
statutes "have also been useful in prosecuting money laundering and
violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act
('RICO'). Violating [sections] 1341 and/or [sections] 1343 can create the
unlawful acts necessary to establish a RICO or money laundering violation."
This interrelationship supports the conclusion that the coordinated planning
and execution of wire fraud, money laundering, and obstruction by Myers
and Branthoover constitutes a conspiracy to commit fraud and racketeering
under both 18 U.S.C. § 1349 and 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d).
Case Examples
Multiple cases provide examples of similar patterns of conduct being
prosecuted as conspiracies under federal law. In United States v. Voigt, 89 F.
3d 1050 (3rd Cir. 1996), the defendants were charged with conspiracy to
commit wire fraud, wire fraud, and money laundering, among other charges.
The court noted that "Alevy pleaded guilty prior to trial and testified for the
government. Travis, Anderskow and Anchors were tried with Voigt. Travis
was acquitted; Anderskow and Anchors were convicted of various charges
including conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud and money
laundering."
Similarly, in U.S. v. Bradley, 644 F.3d 1213, 23 Fla. L. Weekly Fed. C 20 (11th
Cir. 2011), the government prosecuted schemes "under the anti-
racketeering, conspiracy, mail fraud, wire fraud, and money laundering
statutes, 18 U.S.C. §§ 1962, 371, 1341, 1343, and 1956, respectively." The
defendants were charged with "two RICO offenses, violations of 18 U.S.C. §§

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
1962(c) and (d), respectively, plus one count of conspiracy to commit wire
fraud or to pay illegal kickbacks, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371, another
count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371,
forty-nine counts of wire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1343, one count of
conspiracy to commit money laundering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1956(h)."
These cases demonstrate that conduct similar to that alleged against Myers
and Branthoover—coordination of fraudulent acts including wire fraud and
money laundering—has been successfully prosecuted as conspiracy under
both §§ 1349 and 1962(d).
Exceptions and Caveats
Necessity of Proving an Enterprise for RICO Conspiracy
While the coordinated actions of Myers and Branthoover likely constitute a
conspiracy under federal law, establishing a RICO conspiracy specifically
requires proving the existence of an "enterprise." As explained in Kruse v.
Repp, 611 F.Supp.3d 666 (S.D. Iowa 2020), to state an actionable RICO
conspiracy, a plaintiff must plead facts that show "(a) 'an enterprise existed';
(b) 'the enterprise affected interstate or foreign commerce'; (c) 'the
defendant associated with the enterprise'; and (d) 'the defendant 'objectively
manifested an agreement to participate ... in the affairs of [the] enterprise.'"
Without sufficient evidence of an "enterprise" that affected interstate
commerce, a RICO conspiracy charge under § 1962(d) might fail, even if a
conspiracy to commit wire fraud under § 1349 could still be established.
No Requirement to Personally Commit Predicate Acts
It is important to note that under Salinas v. U.S., 522 U.S. 52, 118 S.Ct. 469,
139 L.Ed.2d 352 (1997), a defendant can be convicted of RICO conspiracy
without personally committing or agreeing to commit the predicate acts. As
clarified in U.S. v. Edwards, 303 F.3d 606 (5th Cir. 2002), citing Salinas, an
"individual co-conspirator does not need to personally commit predicate acts
to be convicted of a RICO conspiracy." This means that even if one of the
defendants played a more supportive role and did not directly engage in
wire fraud, money laundering, or obstruction, they could still be convicted of
RICO conspiracy if they knew about and agreed to facilitate the scheme.
Substantive RICO Violation Not Always Required for RICO
Conspiracy
There is some disagreement in the case law regarding whether a substantive
RICO violation must be established to support a RICO conspiracy charge. LD
v. United Behavioral Health, CASE NO. 4:20-cv-02254 YGR (N.D. Cal. Aug
26, 2020) held that "A defendant cannot be liable for a RICO conspiracy
under Section 1962(d) if the defendant is not liable under the substantive
RICO provisions, namely Sections 1962(a), (b), or (c)." This suggests that
failing to establish the elements of a substantive RICO violation would
preclude a RICO conspiracy conviction.

=== PAGE 9 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
However, other cases, such as United States v. Gurry, Criminal Action No.
16-cr-10343-ADB (D. Mass. Jan 17, 2019), have interpreted Salinas more
broadly: "to prove a RICO conspiracy claim, it is sufficient to prove that the
defendant 'knew about and agreed to facilitate the scheme.'" This suggests
that a defendant could be convicted of RICO conspiracy even without
establishing all the elements of a substantive RICO violation, as long as
there was an agreement to facilitate the scheme.
Conclusion
Based on the provided statutory language and case law, the coordinated
planning and execution of multiple predicate acts by Myers and
Branthoover, including wire fraud, money laundering, and obstruction,
constitutes conspiracy to commit fraud and racketeering under federal law.
This conclusion is supported by both 18 U.S.C. § 1349, which criminalizes
conspiracies to commit wire fraud, and 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d), which prohibits
conspiracies to violate RICO.
Under § 1349, the government would need to prove that Myers and
Branthoover knowingly and voluntarily agreed to participate in a scheme to
defraud and that the use of interstate wires in furtherance of the scheme
was reasonably foreseeable. Under § 1962(d), the government would need to
establish an agreement to participate in the affairs of an enterprise through
a pattern of racketeering activity, with knowledge that the scheme involved
or was intended to involve two or more predicate acts of racketeering.
The predicate acts allegedly committed by Myers and Branthoover—wire
fraud, money laundering, and obstruction—all qualify as "racketeering
activity" under 18 U.S.C. § 1961. Their coordination in planning and
executing these acts as part of an ongoing scheme suggests the existence of
both an agreement to participate in a fraudulent scheme (for § 1349
purposes) and an agreement to participate in an enterprise's affairs through
a pattern of racketeering (for § 1962(d) purposes).
Multiple cases demonstrate that similar patterns of conduct have been
successfully prosecuted under both conspiracy statutes. While there are
certain exceptions and caveats, particularly regarding the need to establish
an "enterprise" for RICO conspiracy charges, the overall weight of the
statutory language and case law supports the conclusion that the
defendants' alleged conduct constitutes conspiracy under federal law.

U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
On May 20, 1997, Powers was indicted by a grand jury in the Northern
District of Texas. He was charged in Count 1 with a conspiracy to violate the

=== PAGE 10 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
mail and wire fraud laws, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371. Counts 2 through 7
charged him with executing his scheme by various mailings, in violation of
18 U.S.C. § 1341. Counts 8 through 15 charged him with executing the same
scheme by use of the wires, i.e., telephone calls, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §
1343. Counts 16 through 20 charged him with money laundering to hide the
proceeds of his fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(B)(i).
Summary
The passage from "U.S. v. Powers" illustrates how a defendant was charged
with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering, similar to the
proposition regarding Myers and Branthoover. The case demonstrates the
application of federal statutes, such as 18 U.S.C. § 1343 for wire fraud and
18 U.S.C. § 1956 for money laundering, in prosecuting coordinated
fraudulent schemes. This supports the proposition that coordinated planning
and execution of multiple predicate acts can constitute conspiracy to commit
fraud and racketeering under federal law.
U.S. v. Sharpe, 193 F.3d 852 (5th Cir. 1999)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
The indictment charged Nix with racketeering, conspiracy to violate the
racketeering statute, fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, money
laundering, and conspiracy to obstruct justice... The elements of a Section
371 conspiracy are: (1) an agreement between the defendant and one or
more other persons to violate a law of the United States; (2) an overt act by
one of the conspirators in furtherance of the conspiracy; and (3) the
defendant's intent to further an unlawful objective of the conspiracy... These
defendants conspired to violate 18 U.S.C. 1962(c) by conducting and
participating, directly and indirectly, in the conduct of the affairs of the
enterprise, through a pattern of racketeering activities.
Summary
Elements of a conspiracy under Section 371, which include an agreement to
violate U.S. law, an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy, and intent to
further an unlawful objective. The passage also discusses the violation of 18
U.S.C. 1962(c) through a pattern of racketeering activities, which aligns with
the proposition's mention of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d) prohibiting conspiracy to
violate RICO.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
The operative indictment in this matter alleges a lengthy international RICO
conspiracy... Specifically, the document charges that Defendants... were
'members and associates of a criminal organization'... leaders, members,
and associates engaged in, among other things, acts of mail and wire fraud,
money laundering, identity theft, and counterfeit trademark trafficking.
These acts were committed in furtherance of a wide-scale online auction
fraud scheme... Defendant Stoica is charged with conspiring... to commit
wire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1349... and four types of money
laundering, all in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1956(h)... Moreover, the Indictment
charges Nistor with knowing participation in the RICO conspiracy...
Defendant concedes that the money laundering charge constitutes an
alleged 'predicate act for the RICO charge.'
Summary
Concrete example of how such charges are applied in practice, supporting
the proposition's legal basis.

Extract
Counts 1 and 2 each charged a conspiracy with multiple objects, in violation
of 18 U.S.C. § 371, and the jury was instructed that it only had to find that
Jefferson had conspired to commit one of the substantive offenses identified.
Count 1 charged Jefferson with conspiring to commit bribery, to commit
honest services wire fraud, and to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act,
and Count 2 charged him with conspiring to commit bribery and honest
services wire fraud. Counts 6, 7, and 10 charged Jefferson with honest
services wire fraud, in contravention of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1343 and 1346, under
the alternative theories identified above. Finally, in the 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c)
RICO charge of Count 16, eleven of the twelve racketeering acts specified in
the indictment fell under two alternative theories: bribery and honest
services wire fraud.
Summary
The passage from "United States v. Jefferson" illustrates how conspiracy
charges can be applied when multiple predicate acts, such as bribery and
wire fraud, are coordinated as part of a scheme. The case demonstrates that
a conspiracy charge can be sustained if the jury finds that the defendant
conspired to commit any of the substantive offenses. This aligns with the
proposition that coordinated planning and execution of multiple predicate
acts by defendants can constitute conspiracy to commit fraud and
racketeering under federal law.

U.S. v. Zichettello, 208 F.3d 72 (2nd Cir. 1998)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Second Circuit
Extract
Counts One and Two charged them with participating and conspiring to
participate in the affairs of the TPBA through a pattern of racketeering in
violation of 18 U.S.C. 1962(c) & (d). These counts also alleged that the
appellants had committed eleven racketeering acts in furtherance of the
charged enterprise, including bribery, mail fraud, wire fraud, money
laundering, and witness tampering... A RICO conspiracy charge 'is proven if
the defendant 'embraced the objective of the alleged conspiracy,' and agreed
to commit... predicate acts in furtherance thereof.'
Summary
The passage describes how defendants were charged with participating in a
RICO conspiracy by committing multiple predicate acts, including wire fraud
and money laundering. It explains that a RICO conspiracy charge is proven
if the defendant agreed to commit predicate acts in furtherance of the
conspiracy's objectives. This directly supports the proposition that
coordinated planning and execution of multiple predicate acts by defendants
can constitute a conspiracy to commit fraud and racketeering under federal
law.
U.S. v. Edwards, 303 F.3d 606 (5th Cir. 2002)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
On August 4, 1999, a grand jury returned a 34-count superseding
indictment, charging appellants Edwin Edwards, Stephen Edwards, Martin,
Johnson and Brown with a violation of RICO [18 U.S.C. § 1961 et seq.],
conspiracy to violate RICO [18 U.S.C. § 1962(d)], mail and wire fraud [18
U.S.C. § 1341 et seq.], extortion [18 U.S.C. § 1951], money laundering [18
U.S.C. § 1956], interstate travel and communication in aid of racketeering
[18 U.S.C. § 1952] and false statements [18 U.S.C. § 1001]. ... Finally, though
unnecessary, this evidence was also admissible as against Martin because
the 15th Riverboat License extortion scheme was part of the RICO
conspiracy, of which Martin was charged and convicted. Cf. Salinas v. United
States, 522 U.S. 52, 64, 118 S.Ct. 469, 139 L.Ed.2d 352 (1997) (holding that
individual co-conspirator does not need to personally commit predicate acts
to be convicted of a RICO conspiracy).

=== PAGE 13 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
The passage describes a case where multiple defendants were charged with
RICO violations and conspiracy to violate RICO, among other charges. It
highlights that a co-conspirator does not need to personally commit
predicate acts to be convicted of a RICO conspiracy, as established in
Salinas v. United States. This supports the proposition that coordinated
planning and execution of multiple predicate acts by defendants can
constitute a conspiracy to commit fraud and racketeering under federal law.
U.S. v. Voigt, 89 F.3d 1050 (3rd Cir. 1996)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Third Circuit
Extract
On December 13, 1993, Voigt and four alleged coconspirators--Skip Alevy,
Mercedes Travis, Ralph Anderskow, and Donald Anchors--were charged in a
twenty-eight-count superseding indictment. The indictment charged Voigt
personally with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, fifteen counts
of wire fraud, four counts of money laundering, two counts of tax evasion,
and criminal forfeiture allegations arising out of the money laundering
counts. After a three-month trial, a jury convicted Voigt of all counts except
one count of wire fraud. ... Alevy pleaded guilty prior to trial and testified for
the government. Travis, Anderskow and Anchors were tried with Voigt.
Travis was acquitted; Anderskow and Anchors were convicted of various
charges including conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud and money
laundering.
Summary
The passage describes a case where multiple defendants were charged and
convicted of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering, among
other charges. This supports the proposition by illustrating a precedent
where coordinated fraudulent acts, including wire fraud and money
laundering, were prosecuted under conspiracy charges. The case
demonstrates how the legal system addresses coordinated criminal activities
involving multiple defendants, which aligns with the proposition regarding
Myers and Branthoover.

Count 19 charged the appellants with conspiring with Perhacs, Palmer, and
Parker to commit mail or wire fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1349. To

=== PAGE 14 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
prove such a conspiracy, 'the government need not demonstrate an
agreement specifically to use the interstate wires to further the scheme to
defraud.' United States v. Hasson, 333 F.3d 1264, 1270 (11th Cir. 2003).
Instead, 'it is enough to prove that the defendant knowingly and voluntarily
agreed to participate in a scheme to defraud and that the use of the
interstate wires in furtherance of the scheme was reasonably
foreseeable.' ... Count 1 charged the appellants with conspiring to violate
RICO based on predicate acts of drug distribution and mail or wire fraud. To
establish a conspiracy to violate RICO under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d), 'the
government must prove that the defendants ‘objectively manifested, through
words or actions, an agreement to participate in the conduct of the affairs of
the enterprise through the commission of two or more predicate crimes.'
Summary
Clear explanation of the legal standards for proving conspiracy to commit
wire fraud and RICO violations. It highlights that for wire fraud conspiracy
under 18 U.S.C. § 1349, it is sufficient to show that the defendant agreed to
participate in a fraudulent scheme and that the use of interstate wires was
foreseeable. For RICO conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d), it is necessary
to demonstrate an agreement to participate in the enterprise's affairs
through the commission of two or more predicate crimes. These standards
directly support the proposition that coordinated planning and execution of
multiple predicate acts by defendants can constitute conspiracy to commit
fraud and racketeering under federal law.

(SHL) (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. Oct 13, 2023)
U.S. Bankruptcy Court — Southern District of New York
Extract
The Trustee alleges that the Moving Defendants conspired with the
Executive Defendants to violate 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) by committing acts of
mail and wire fraud, money laundering, obstruction of justice, bankruptcy
fraud, and violating the National Stolen Property Act. ... Separate from the
elements of a substantive RICO violation, RICO conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. §
1962(d) requires proof '(a) of an agreement to join a racketeering scheme,
(b) of the defendant's knowing engagement in the scheme with the intent
that its overall goals be effectuated, and (c) that the scheme involved, or by
agreement between any members of the conspiracy was intended to involve,
two or more predicate acts of racketeering.' United States v. Zemlyansky,
908 F.3d 1, 11 (2d Cir. 2018). ... To prove the pattern element-that two or
more predicate acts were involved-it 'need not [be] establish[ed] that the
defendant 'committed or agreed to commit two predicate acts himself.' ...
Rather, the pattern element may be established 'through evidence that 'the
co-conspirators, not solely the defendant, agreed to conduct the affairs of
the enterprise through a pattern of racketeering.'

=== PAGE 15 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
Elements required to establish a RICO conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d),
which includes an agreement to join a racketeering scheme, knowing
engagement in the scheme, and involvement in two or more predicate acts
of racketeering. It also clarifies that a defendant need not personally commit
or agree to commit two predicate acts, as long as there is evidence that co-
conspirators agreed to conduct the enterprise's affairs through a pattern of
racketeering. This directly supports the proposition that coordinated
planning and execution of multiple predicate acts by defendants can
constitute a conspiracy to commit fraud and racketeering under federal law.
U.S. v. Bradley, 644 F.3d 1213, 23 Fla. L. Weekly Fed. C 20 (11th Cir. 2011)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Eleventh Circuit
Extract
The Government chose to prosecute the Bradleys' schemes under the anti-
racketeering, conspiracy, mail fraud, wire fraud, and money laundering
statutes, 18 U.S.C. §§ 1962, 371, 1341, 1343, and 1956, respectively... Count
1 was brought under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations
Act (“RICO”), 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). Count 1 alleged that the Bradleys, Bio–
Med, Tellechea, and others constituted an “enterprise” engaged in interstate
commerce and that they conducted that enterprise “through a pattern of
racketeering activity.” All of the acts that made up the pattern of
racketeering alleged in Count 1, i.e., the acts the Bradleys and Bio–Med
were found to have committed in carrying out the recycling scheme, were
based on fraud—mail fraud; wire fraud; transportation of blood-derivatives
acquired by fraud; laundering money obtained by mail fraud and wire
fraud... The indictment charged Bradley, Jr., with two RICO offenses,
violations of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1962(c) and (d), respectively, plus one count of
conspiracy to commit wire fraud or to pay illegal kickbacks, in violation of
18 U.S.C. § 371, another count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, in
violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371, forty-nine counts of wire fraud, in violation of 18
U.S.C. § 1343, one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering, in
violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1956(h)...
Summary
The passage describes how the Bradleys were prosecuted for engaging in a
pattern of racketeering activity, which included wire fraud and money
laundering, under RICO and conspiracy statutes. It highlights the use of 18
U.S.C. § 1962(d) to charge conspiracy to violate RICO and 18 U.S.C. § 1343
for wire fraud. This supports the proposition that coordinated planning and
execution of fraudulent acts can constitute conspiracy to commit fraud and
racketeering under federal law.

United States v. Jimenez Recio, 537 U.S. 270 (2003)
U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
The conspiracy poses a 'threat to the public' over and above the threat of the
substantive crime's commission—both because the '[c]ombination in crime
makes more likely the commission of [other] crimes' and because it
'decreases the probability that the individuals involved will depart from their
path of criminality.'
Summary
The U.S. Supreme Court recognizes the inherent dangers of conspiracies,
which include the increased likelihood of committing additional crimes and
the reduced probability of conspirators abandoning their criminal activities.
This understanding supports the proposition that coordinated planning and
execution of multiple predicate acts by defendants can constitute a
conspiracy to commit fraud and racketeering under federal law.
U.S. v. Goldin Industries, Inc., 219 F.3d 1271 (11th Cir. 2000)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Eleventh Circuit
Extract
A 'pattern' of racketeering activity requires that a defendant commit two
acts of racketeering activity within a ten-year period. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5).
Racketeering activity is defined as the commission of certain federal crimes,
including for our purposes here, the crime of mail fraud pursuant to 18
U.S.C. § 1341... The Supreme Court has held that the existence of an
enterprise 'is proved by evidence of an ongoing organization, formal or
informal, and by evidence that the various associates function as a
continuing unit.' United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 583, 101 S.Ct.
2524, 69 L.Ed.2d 246 (1981).
Summary
Requirements for establishing a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO,
which includes committing two acts of racketeering within a ten-year period.
It also explains that an enterprise can be any group functioning as a
continuing unit, which aligns with the proposition that Myers and
Branthoover coordinated and planned fraudulent acts as part of an ongoing
scheme. The passage supports the idea that their actions could constitute a
conspiracy to commit fraud and racketeering under federal law.

United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 101 S.Ct. 2524, 69 L.Ed.2d 246
(1981)
U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
In order to secure a conviction under RICO, the Government must prove
both the existence of an 'enterprise' and the connected 'pattern of
racketeering activity.' The enterprise is an entity, for present purposes a
group of persons associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a
course of conduct. The pattern of racketeering activity is, on the other hand,
a series of criminal acts as defined by the statute. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1) (1976
ed., Supp. III). The former is proved by evidence of an ongoing organization,
formal or informal, and by evidence that the various associates function as a
continuing unit.
Summary
For a RICO violation, the government must demonstrate both an enterprise
and a pattern of racketeering activity. The enterprise can be a group of
individuals associated for a common criminal purpose, and the pattern of
racketeering involves multiple criminal acts. This supports the proposition
that coordinated planning and execution of multiple predicate acts by
defendants can constitute a conspiracy to commit fraud and racketeering
under federal law.
Salinas v. U.S., 522 U.S. 52, 118 S.Ct. 469, 139 L.Ed.2d 352 (1997)
U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
To be convicted of conspiracy to violate RICO under §1962(d), the
conspirator need not himself have committed or agreed to commit the two
or more predicate acts, such as bribery, requisite for a substantive RICO
offense under §1962(c). Section 1962(d)-which forbids 'any person to
conspire to violate' §1962(c)-is even more comprehensive than the general
conspiracy provision applicable to federal crimes, §371, since it contains no
requirement of an overt or specific act to effect the conspiracy's object... A
conspiracy may exist even if a conspirator does not agree to commit or
facilitate each and every part of the substantive offense... The partners in
the criminal plan must agree to pursue the same criminal objective and may
divide up the work, yet each is responsible for the acts of each other.
Summary
Under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d), a defendant can be convicted of conspiracy to
violate RICO without having committed or agreed to commit the predicate

=== PAGE 18 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
acts themselves. The statute is broader than the general conspiracy statute
because it does not require an overt act. This means that if Myers and
Branthoover coordinated and planned fraudulent acts as part of a scheme,
they could be held liable for conspiracy under RICO even if they did not
personally commit each act. The passage supports the idea that coordinated
planning and execution of multiple predicate acts can constitute a
conspiracy to commit fraud and racketeering.
Boyle v. United States, 129 S.Ct. 2237, 173 L.Ed.2d 1265, 556 U.S. 938, 77
USLW 4474 (2009)
U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
The evidence at petitioner Boyle's trial for violating the Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) provision forbidding 'any
person ... associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of
which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate,
directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a
pattern of racketeering activity,' 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), was sufficient to prove,
among other things, that Boyle and others committed a series of bank thefts
in several States; that the participants included a core group, along with
others recruited from time to time; and that the core group was loosely and
informally organized, lacking a leader, hierarchy, or any long-term master
plan... Given that it is also unlawful to conspire to violate § 1962(c), see §
1962(d)...
Summary
The passage from "Boyle v. United States" illustrates how a group, even if
loosely organized without a formal hierarchy, can be considered an
"enterprise" under RICO if it engages in a pattern of racketeering activity.
The case also highlights that it is unlawful to conspire to violate RICO
provisions, as per 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d). This supports the proposition that
coordinated planning and execution of multiple predicate acts, such as those
alleged against Myers and Branthoover, can constitute a conspiracy to
commit fraud and racketeering under federal law.

conspiracy the objective of which was to operate that enterprise through an
identified pattern of racketeering activity.' United States v. Glecier, 923 F.2d
496, 500 (7th Cir. 1991); see Salinas v. United States, 522 U.S. 52, 66 (1997)
(holding that to prove a RICO conspiracy claim, it is sufficient to prove that
the defendant 'knew about and agreed to facilitate the scheme'); United
States v. Ortiz, No. C 12-00119 SI, 2013 WL 6842541, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Dec.
27, 2013) (applying Salinas and stating that '[i]t is sufficient that the
indictment alleges that [the defendant] knew about the enterprise's
racketeering activities and agreed to help facilitate them'). This requires an
allegation that the defendant agreed that a co-conspirator would commit at
least two acts of racketeering activity.
Summary
For a RICO conspiracy charge, it is necessary to allege that the defendant
knowingly joined a conspiracy with the objective of operating an enterprise
through a pattern of racketeering activity. The passage highlights that it is
sufficient to prove that the defendant knew about and agreed to facilitate
the scheme, and that an agreement to commit at least two acts of
racketeering activity is required. This aligns with the proposition that Myers
and Branthoover coordinated and planned fraudulent acts as part of an
ongoing scheme, which would constitute a conspiracy under federal law.
Morrow v. Black, 742 F.Supp. 1199 (E.D. N.Y. 1990)
U.S. District Court — Eastern District of New York
Extract
Plaintiffs in their second claim allege that defendants violated § 1962(c) of
the RICO statute. Section 1962(c) of the statute renders civilly liable any
person who being employed by or associated with an enterprise engaged in
interstate commerce conducts or participates, directly or indirectly, in the
conduct of that enterprise's affairs through a 'pattern of racketeering
activity'... Plaintiffs in their third claim allege that defendants violated §
1962(d) of the RICO statute. Section 1962(d) renders liable any person who
'conspires' to commit a RICO violation... The statute defines 'racketeering
activity' as any act or threat involving specified state law crimes, any act
indictable under various specified federal statutes, and certain federal
offenses, including mail fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1341), and wire fraud (18 U.S.C. §
1343).
Summary
The RICO statute, specifically sections 1962(c) and 1962(d), addresses the
liability of individuals involved in a pattern of racketeering activity and those
who conspire to commit such violations. The passage highlights that
racketeering activity includes federal offenses like wire fraud, which is
relevant to the proposition. The court's discussion of the continuity and

=== PAGE 20 ===

relatedness of predicate acts supports the idea that coordinated planning
and execution of multiple acts can constitute a conspiracy under RICO.
Portionpac Chemical Corp. v. Sanitech Systems, 217 F.Supp.2d 1238 (M.D.
Fla. 2002)
U.S. District Court — Middle District of Florida
Extract
Congress designed the Federal Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act (RICO), Title 18, United States Code, Section 1961, et
seq. as a flexible tool to fight organized crime. As such, it makes the
following activities unlawful: ... (d) conspiring to violate any of the
provisions of Section 1962(a)-(c). 18 U.S.C. § 1962. ... To engage in a 'pattern
of racketeering activity,' the defendant must have participated in 'at least
two acts of racketeering activity, one of which occurred after the effective
date of [RICO] and the last of which occurred within ten years (excluding
any term of imprisonment) after the commission of a prior act of
racketeering activity.' 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5).
Summary
The RICO statute is designed to combat organized crime by making it
unlawful to conspire to violate its provisions. The statute requires
participation in at least two acts of racketeering activity to establish a
pattern, which aligns with the proposition that coordinated planning and
execution of multiple predicate acts by the defendants constitutes
conspiracy to commit fraud and racketeering under federal law.

Section 1962(d) provides, 'It shall be unlawful for any person to conspire to

defendant cannot be liable for a RICO conspiracy under Section 1962(d) if
the defendant is not liable under the substantive RICO provisions, namely

Summary
The passage explains that under Section 1962(d) of RICO, it is unlawful to
conspire to violate any of the substantive provisions of RICO, which include
Sections 1962(a), (b), and (c). This supports the proposition that a
conspiracy to commit fraud and racketeering, as alleged against defendants
Myers and Branthoover, would be unlawful if it involves a conspiracy to
violate these substantive RICO provisions. The passage also highlights the
necessity of establishing a substantive RICO violation to support a
conspiracy claim under Section 1962(d).
Said v. Chojnacki
U.S. District Court — Northern District of Illinois
Extract
Section 1962(d) makes it 'unlawful for any person to conspire to violate any
of the provisions of subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section.' 18 U.S.C. §
1962(d). To state a claim under § 1962(d), a plaintiff 'must allege that the
defendant (1) agreed to maintain an interest in or control of an enterprise,
or to participate in an enterprise's affairs, (2) through a pattern of
racketeering activity, and (3) that the defendant agreed that some member
of the conspiracy (not necessarily the defendant herself) would commit at
least two predicate acts in furtherance of those goals.'
Summary
Elements necessary to establish a conspiracy under RICO, specifically under
18 U.S.C. § 1962(d). It explains that a defendant must agree to participate in
an enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity and that
some member of the conspiracy would commit at least two predicate acts.
This directly supports the proposition that coordinated planning and
execution of multiple predicate acts by defendants can constitute a
conspiracy to commit fraud and racketeering under federal law.
Schwamborn v. U.S., 507 F.Supp.2d 229 (E.D. N.Y. 2007)
U.S. District Court — Eastern District of New York
Extract
Count 1 alleged racketeering in violation of the Racketeering Influenced
Corrupt Organizations Act of 1970 ('RICO'), 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), against all
of the defendants, and identified a total of twenty-one predicate
racketeering acts... Count 2 alleged racketeering conspiracy in violation of
RICO, 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d), and incorporated by reference the predicate acts
identified in Count 1... The remaining counts asserted in the Superseding

=== PAGE 22 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Indictment against Mr. Schwamborn were essentially coextensive with the
acts alleged as RICO predicates: conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud
(Count 24), substantive wire fraud (Count 25), substantive mail fraud (Count
26), money laundering (Count 27)... RICO defines a 'pattern of racketeering
activity,' a necessary element for liability under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), as
'requir[ing] at least two acts of racketeering activity... 'Racketeering activity'
is defined as the violation of any one of a lengthy list of state or federal
crimes, including, as relevant here, mail fraud, wire fraud, money
laundering... In order to establish a RICO violation, the government must
prove, inter alia, that the alleged predicate acts were 'related,' i.e., that they
shared 'the same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or
methods of commission, or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing
characteristics and [were] not isolated events.'
Summary
The passage discusses the application of RICO statutes to a case involving
multiple predicate acts, including wire fraud and money laundering. It
explains the requirements for establishing a RICO violation, such as the
need for related predicate acts and the definition of a "pattern of
racketeering activity." This directly supports the proposition that
coordinated planning and execution of multiple predicate acts by defendants
can constitute a conspiracy to commit fraud and racketeering under federal
law.
U.S. v. Zemek, 634 F.2d 1159 (9th Cir. 1980)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Ninth Circuit
Extract
RICO prohibits investment in, control, or operation of an 'enterprise'
through a pattern of racketeering activity. See 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961-1968...
Section 1962, the substantive portion of RICO, employs the foregoing
definitions to create three offenses. See 18 U.S.C. § 1962(a)-(c). Pertinent to
this appeal is subsection 1962(c) which prohibits any person employed by or
associated with an enterprise from conducting its affairs through
racketeering activity. Count I charged each appellant with a conspiracy to
violate this subsection under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d). The indictment alleged
107 overt acts in furtherance of this conspiracy... The essence of a RICO
conspiracy is not an agreement to commit predicate crimes but an
agreement to conduct or participate in the conduct of the affairs of an
enterprise through a pattern of racketeering. 'Pattern' is expressly defined
as two or more predicate offenses.
Summary
The passage from "U.S. v. Zemek" provides a detailed explanation of how
RICO statutes apply to conspiracies involving racketeering activities. It
clarifies that RICO prohibits conducting an enterprise's affairs through a

=== PAGE 23 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
pattern of racketeering activity and that a RICO conspiracy involves an
agreement to conduct such affairs. The passage also highlights that a
pattern of racketeering is defined as two or more predicate offenses, which
aligns with the proposition that coordinated planning and execution of
multiple predicate acts by defendants can constitute a conspiracy under
RICO.

U.S. District Court — Southern District of Iowa
Extract
Those who conspire to violate RICO also fall within the statute's broad
purview. 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d). ... Section 1962(d) makes it unlawful for any
person to conspire to violate RICO's substantive provisions. To state an
actionable RICO conspiracy, a plaintiff must plead facts that show (a) 'an
enterprise existed'; (b) 'the enterprise affected interstate or foreign
commerce'; (c) 'the defendant associated with the enterprise'; and (d) 'the
defendant ‘objectively manifested an agreement to participate ... in the
affairs of [the] enterprise.’ ... A conspiracy may exist even if a conspirator
does not agree to commit or facilitate each and every part of the substantive
offense so long as [t]he partners in the criminal plan ... agree to pursue the
same criminal objective.
Summary
18 U.S.C. § 1962(d) criminalizes conspiracies to violate RICO's substantive
provisions. The passage explains the elements required to establish a RICO
conspiracy, including the existence of an enterprise, its effect on commerce,
the defendant's association with the enterprise, and an agreement to
participate in its affairs. The passage also clarifies that a conspiracy can
exist even if not all conspirators agree to every part of the offense, as long
as they share a common criminal objective.
U.S. v. Glecier, 923 F.2d 496 (7th Cir. 1991)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Seventh Circuit
Extract
All that 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1962(d), the 'RICO conspiracy statute,' provides is
that it is unlawful 'to conspire to violate any of the provisions of subsections
(a), (b) or (c) of this section.' Section 1962(c), the familiar 'substantive' RICO
provision, criminalizes the participation in the affairs of an enterprise
affecting interstate commerce through a pattern of racketeering activity.
Section 1962(d), like all conspiracy provisions, has as its target the act of

agreement--here, the agreement to engage in activity that implicates section
1962(c).
Summary
The focus of a RICO conspiracy charge is the agreement to engage in
racketeering activity, which supports the idea that Myers and Branthoover's
coordination and planning of fraudulent acts could be prosecuted under this
statute.
U.S. v. Hasson, 333 F.3d 1264 (11th Cir. 2003)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Eleventh Circuit
Extract
Following a seven-week trial, the jury returned a guilty verdict convicting
Hasson of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, three counts of wire fraud,
conspiracy to launder money, and conspiracy to obstruct justice. The jury
found that the objects of the conspiracy to launder money were violations of
18 U.S.C. §§ 1956(a)(1)(A)(i) (promotion of unlawful activity), (a)(1)(B)(i)
(concealment of unlawful activity), and 1957 (transaction involving more
than $10,000 in unlawful proceeds). The jury found that the object of the
conspiracy to obstruct justice was a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1503.
Summary
The passage from "U.S. v. Hasson" demonstrates that a jury can convict
individuals for conspiracy to commit wire fraud, money laundering, and
obstruction of justice when there is evidence of coordinated planning and
execution of these acts. The case illustrates that the government does not
need to prove an agreement specifically to use interstate wires but rather
that the defendants knowingly participated in a scheme to defraud, and the
use of interstate wires was foreseeable. This supports the proposition that
coordinated planning and execution of multiple predicate acts by defendants
can constitute conspiracy under federal law.
United States v. Zemlyansky, 908 F.3d 1 (2nd Cir. 2018)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Second Circuit
Extract
RICO conspiracy requires proof that the defendant 'agree[d] to conduct or to
participate in the conduct of [an] enterprise’s affairs through a pattern of
racketeering activity.' United States v. Pizzonia, 577 F.3d 455, 462 (2d Cir.
2009). To prove the agreement element, the government must show that the
defendant 'knew about and agreed to facilitate [a racketeering] scheme.'

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Salinas, 522 U.S. at 66, 118 S.Ct. 469; see also Pizzonia, 577 F.3d at 459
('[T]he object of a racketeering conspiracy is to conduct the affairs of a
charged enterprise through a pattern of racketeering, not to commit
discrete predicate acts.'). To prove the pattern element, the government
must show that two or more 'predicate acts were, or were intended to be,
committed as part of [the] conspiracy.'
Summary
The focus is on the agreement to conduct the enterprise's affairs through a
pattern of racketeering activity, rather than on committing specific acts. This
supports the proposition that Myers and Branthoover's coordinated planning
and execution of multiple predicate acts can constitute a conspiracy to
commit fraud and racketeering.
18 U.S.C. § 1962 18 U.S.C. § 1962 Prohibited Activities
Extract
It shall be unlawful for any person to conspire to violate any of the
provisions of subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section.
Summary
The passage from 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d) explicitly states that it is unlawful for
any person to conspire to violate the provisions of subsections (a), (b), or (c).
These subsections relate to engaging in, conducting, or participating in an
enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity. This directly
supports the proposition that the coordinated planning and execution of
multiple predicate acts by the defendants constitutes a conspiracy to commit
fraud and racketeering under federal law.
18 U.S.C. § 1349 18 U.S.C. § 1349 Attempt and Conspiracy
Extract
Any person who attempts or conspires to commit any offense under this
chapter shall be subject to the same penalties as those prescribed for the
offense, the commission of which was the object of the attempt or
conspiracy.
Summary
18 U.S.C. § 1349 explicitly criminalizes attempts and conspiracies to commit
offenses under Chapter 63, which includes wire fraud. This means that
individuals who conspire to commit wire fraud are subject to the same
penalties as those who actually commit the offense. This supports the

=== PAGE 26 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
proposition that the coordinated planning and execution of fraudulent acts
by the defendants can be prosecuted under this statute as a conspiracy to
commit wire fraud.
18 U.S.C. § 1961 18 U.S.C. § 1961 Definitions
Extract
As used in this chapter- 'racketeering activity' means ... (B) any act which is
indictable under any of the following provisions of title 18, United States
Code: ... section 1343 (relating to wire fraud), ... section 1503 (relating to
obstruction of justice), ... section 1956 (relating to the laundering of
monetary instruments), ... 'pattern of racketeering activity' requires at least
two acts of racketeering activity, one of which occurred after the effective
date of this chapter and the last of which occurred within ten years
(excluding any period of imprisonment) after the commission of a prior act
of racketeering activity;
Summary
The definition of "racketeering activity" includes acts such as wire fraud,
obstruction of justice, and money laundering, which are relevant to the
alleged activities of Myers and Branthoover. The passage also defines a
"pattern of racketeering activity" as requiring at least two acts, which aligns
with the proposition that the defendants coordinated multiple predicate
acts. This supports the argument that their actions could constitute a
conspiracy to commit fraud and racketeering under federal law.
18 U.S.C. § 1956 18 U.S.C. § 1956 Laundering of Monetary Instruments
Extract
Whoever, knowing that the property involved in a financial transaction
represents the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity, conducts or
attempts to conduct such a financial transaction which in fact involves the
proceeds of specified unlawful activity... shall be sentenced to a fine of not
more than $500,000 or twice the value of the property involved in the
transaction, whichever is greater, or imprisonment for not more than twenty
years, or both. For purposes of this paragraph, a financial transaction shall
be considered to be one involving the proceeds of specified unlawful activity
if it is part of a set of parallel or dependent transactions, any one of which
involves the proceeds of specified unlawful activity, and all of which are part
of a single plan or arrangement.
Summary
The passage from 18 U.S.C. § 1956 outlines the criminalization of conducting
or attempting to conduct financial transactions involving proceeds from

=== PAGE 27 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
unlawful activities. It specifies that such transactions are considered part of
a single plan or arrangement if they are parallel or dependent, which aligns
with the proposition that Myers and Branthoover coordinated and planned
fraudulent acts as part of an ongoing scheme. This supports the notion of
conspiracy to commit fraud and racketeering, as it highlights the legal
framework for addressing coordinated financial crimes.
Mail and wire fraud.
American Criminal Law Review - Georgetown University Law Center -
Messier, Flo - 1999-06-22
Extract
The two statutes have been widely used to 'cover not only the full range of
consumer frauds, stock frauds, land frauds, bank frauds, insurance frauds,
and commodity frauds, but [also]... such areas as blackmail, counterfeiting,
election fraud, and bribery.' Prosecutors have also used these statutes to
prosecute money laundering and Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act ('RICO') violations. A violation of [sections] 1341 or
[sections] 1343 can provide the unlawful act necessary to establish a RICO
or money laundering violation. Once a mail fraud or wire fraud offense has
been proven, then both the RICO and the money laundering statutes allow
for more severe penalties.
Summary
A proven mail or wire fraud offense can serve as a predicate act for RICO
violations, which aligns with the proposition that coordinated fraudulent
acts can constitute a conspiracy under federal law.

Rosenblatt, Raphael - 1997-01-01
Extract
They have also been useful in prosecuting money laundering and violations
of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act ('RICO').
Violating [sections] 1341 and/or [sections] 1343 can create the unlawful acts
necessary to establish a RICO or money laundering violation. Once a mail
fraud or wire fraud offense has been proven, both the RICO and the money
laundering statutes allow for more severe penalties. ... In cases where mail
and wire fraud is alleged as part of a conspiracy, the prosecution must show
that the defendant was a member of the conspiracy at some point during the
five years preceding the indictment.
Summary
Mail and wire fraud statutes are instrumental in prosecuting money
laundering and RICO violations. The passage explains that violations of
sections 1341 and 1343 can establish the unlawful acts necessary for RICO
or money laundering charges. It also highlights that mail and wire fraud can
be part of a conspiracy, which aligns with the proposition that Myers and
Branthoover coordinated fraudulent acts as part of an ongoing scheme. The
passage supports the idea that such coordinated acts can lead to conspiracy
charges under federal law.
Mail and Wire Fraud

Summary
Mail and wire fraud are considered predicate felonies under RICO, which is
relevant to the proposition that Myers and Branthoover's actions could
constitute a conspiracy to commit fraud and racketeering. The reference to
United States v. Goldin Indus., Inc. and Zichettello supports the idea that
such activities can be part of a RICO conspiracy. This aligns with the
proposition that the defendants' coordinated actions could be prosecuted
under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d) for conspiracy to violate RICO.
Mail and wire fraud.

Zelcer, Amy - 2012-03-22
Extract
This Article provides an overview of the prosecution of offenses under the
federal mail and wire fraud statutes. Because the character, language, and
scope of the mail and wire fraud statutes are similar, legal analysis and case
law on mail fraud are equally applicable to wire fraud... Mail and wire fraud
law has evolved through both congressional action and court decision.
Currently, to be convicted of a mail or wire fraud offense, the government
must show beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant perpetrated: (i) a
scheme to defraud that includes a material deception... United States v.
Goldin Indus., 219 F.3d 1271, 1274 (11th Cir. 2000) (defining racketeering
activity as the commission of certain federal crimes, including crime of mail

(affirming multi-defendant convictions on counts including: (i) mail fraud in
connection with monthly bribes related to conspiracy to violate RICO, and
(ii) wire fraud in connection with campaign finance scheme).
Summary
N overview of the prosecution of mail and wire fraud offenses, highlighting
that the legal analysis and case law for mail fraud are applicable to wire
fraud. It also discusses the elements required for conviction, including a
scheme to defraud with material deception. The passage references case law
that defines racketeering activity to include mail fraud and affirms
convictions for conspiracy to violate RICO, which supports the proposition
that coordinated fraudulent acts can constitute conspiracy under federal
law.

Extract
Further, mail and wire fraud are predicate felonies under the Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (“RICO”) and are specified as
unlawful activity for purposes of the federal money laundering statutes.
Summary
Mail and wire fraud are considered predicate felonies under RICO, which
means they can be used as the basis for a RICO charge. This supports the
proposition that the coordinated planning and execution of multiple
predicate acts, such as wire fraud, by the defendants can constitute a
conspiracy to commit fraud and racketeering under federal law. Additionally,
the mention of these acts as unlawful activities for money laundering
statutes further supports the involvement in a broader fraudulent scheme.
Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy
The Brief - American Bar Association - 2024-01-01
Extract
RICO’s broad definition of racketeering activity and the act’s reference to
mail and wire fraud as predicate offenses begs the question: Why not RICO?
That is, should the plaintiff consider adding a RICO count to an existing
state cause of action? Moreover, since an action under RICO arises under
federal law, a plaintiff can elect to have access to federal court. Civil RICO is
so broad and offers such a potentially broad pathway to pleading of such a
claim in light of the inclusion of mail and wire fraud as predicate acts that a
plaintiff can take almost any given set of facts and fashion their pleadings
and be afforded the opportunity to plead a civil racketeering claim. The key
is to make certain that each of the four critical elements previously set out is
properly pleaded.
Summary
RICO's broad definition allows for the inclusion of mail and wire fraud as
predicate acts, which are relevant to the proposition. The passage suggests
that RICO can be applied broadly to various sets of facts, including those
involving coordinated fraudulent acts. This supports the idea that the
defendants' actions could be framed as a RICO violation if the elements are
properly pleaded.

constitute a conspiracy to commit fraud and racketeering under federal law.
Insurance Fraud is a Violent Crime.
Insurance Advocate - CINN Group, Inc. - 2024-03-01
Extract
RICO CONSPIRACY The essence of a RICO conspiracy is the existence of an
agreement to violate RICO's substantive provisions. RICO conspiracy was
established by proof of: (a) of an agreement to join a racketeering scheme,
(b) of the defendant's knowing engagement in the scheme with the intent
that its overall goals be effectuated, and (c) that the scheme involved, or by
agreement between any members of the conspiracy was intended to involve,
two or more predicate acts of racketeering.
Summary
Essential elements required to establish a RICO conspiracy, which includes
an agreement to join a racketeering scheme, knowing engagement in the
scheme with intent, and involvement of two or more predicate acts of
racketeering. This directly supports the proposition that Myers and
Branthoover's coordinated planning and execution of multiple predicate acts
could constitute a conspiracy to commit fraud and racketeering under
federal law.

Extract
RICO is not just a tool for government control over organized crime. It is
also a remedial statute for civil matters. (31) It 'authorize[s]... criminal or
civil remedies on conduct already criminal, when performed in a specified
fashion' as delineated by the statute. (32) Section 1962 provides civil
remedies for four types of conduct: ... (4) conspiring to commit any of these
offenses. (34)
Summary
The passage explains that RICO is a statute that provides both criminal and
civil remedies for conduct that is already criminal when performed in a
specified manner. It specifically mentions that Section 1962 provides
remedies for conspiring to commit offenses related to racketeering activity.
This directly supports the proposition that the coordinated planning and
execution of multiple predicate acts by the defendants constitutes
conspiracy to commit fraud and racketeering under federal law.
Review of Criminal Penalties and Collateral Consequences for Antitrust and
Related Violations
Antitrust Cartel Leniency and Sentencing Handbook - American Bar
Association - 2023-05-07
Extract
Previously, conspiracies to commit mail or wire fraud only carried a five-year
maximum prison sentence under the general conspiracy statute, 18 U.S.C. §
371. Thus, the enactment of section 1349 ensured that conspiracies to
commit mail and wire fraud would carry the same maximum prison terms as
the enhanced maximums under the amended mail and wire fraud statutes.
Section 1349 also filled a gap in the wire fraud statute, which did not cover
attempts, as did the mail fraud statute. Further, section 1349, unlike 18
U.S.C. § 371, does not require proof of an overt act.
Summary
The passage highlights the significance of 18 U.S.C. § 1349 in addressing
conspiracies to commit wire fraud by aligning the penalties with those for
actual wire fraud offenses and eliminating the requirement for an overt act.
This supports the proposition by emphasizing that coordinated planning and
execution of fraudulent acts, such as those by Myers and Branthoover, fall
under the purview of § 1349, which criminalizes such conspiracies.

The conduct described in article 21 could be punishable under various
Federal criminal theories, including but not limited to mail and wire fraud,
antitrust violations, conspiracy, and securities fraud, depending upon the
facts of a given case. Additionally, commercial bribery can be charged
federally under 18 U.S.C. 1952(b)(2) (interstate and foreign travel or
transportation in aid of racketeering enterprises)...
Summary
Conduct involving wire fraud and conspiracy can be prosecuted under
federal criminal theories, including 18 U.S.C. § 1349 for attempts and
conspiracies to commit wire fraud. It also mentions the use of 18 U.S.C.
1952(b)(2) for racketeering-related activities, which aligns with the RICO
statute's focus on racketeering enterprises. This supports the proposition
that coordinated planning and execution of fraudulent acts can be
prosecuted under these federal laws.
RICO: A Primer
Extract
Under Section 1962(d), it is a violation to conspire to commit any of the
three substantive RICO offenses. To prove a violation of Section 1962(d), a
plaintiff must prove the following elements: * The existence of an enterprise
(or that an enterprise would exist); * That the enterprise was (or would be)
engaged in, or its activities affected (or would affect), interstate or foreign
commerce; and * That each defendant knowingly agreed that a conspirator
would commit a violation of 18 U.S.C. ' 1962(c). The Supreme Court held
that to establish a RICO conspiracy offense under Section 1962(d), there is
no requirement that the defendant 'himself committed or agreed to commit
the two predicate acts requisite for a substantive RICO offense under '
1962(c).' The Supreme Court explained: A conspiracy may exist even if a
conspirator does not agree to commit or facilitate each and every part of the
substantive offense. The partners in the criminal plan must agree to pursue
the same criminal objective and may divide up the work, yet each is
responsible for the acts of each other. If conspirators have a plan which calls
for some conspirators to perpetrate the crime and others to provide support,
the supporters are as guilty as the perpetrators.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
The passage explains the elements required to prove a RICO conspiracy
under Section 1962(d), emphasizing that a defendant does not need to
commit or agree to commit the predicate acts themselves. Instead, it is
sufficient for the defendant to knowingly agree to further the criminal
objectives of the conspiracy. This supports the proposition that Myers and
Branthoover's coordinated planning and execution of fraudulent acts could
constitute a conspiracy to commit fraud and racketeering, even if they did
not personally commit each predicate act.

Summary
The passage explains that under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d), it is a violation to
conspire to commit RICO offenses, and it is not necessary for a defendant to
have committed the predicate acts themselves. The passage further clarifies
that conspirators can be held responsible for the acts of others if they share
a common criminal objective. This supports the proposition that Myers and
Branthoover's coordinated planning and execution of fraudulent acts could
constitute a conspiracy under RICO, even if they did not personally commit
each act.
Defending Civil RICO Claims: A Defense Plan Should Be In Every Business's
Arsenal

=== PAGE 35 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
RICO is not a simple statute. It pertains to conduct associated with an
'enterprise' and 'a pattern racketeering activity.' An enterprise is an
individual or legal entity, or a union or group of individuals associated in fact
although not a legal entity, while a pattern of racketeering activity requires
long-term, organized conduct to violate state and federal laws. There are
four types of activities outlawed by RICO, and claims under Section 1962(c)
are the most commonly asserted: ... Section 1962(d) prohibits a person from
conspiring to violate Sections 1962(a), (b), or (c). ... Second, to prove most
types of RICO claims, the plaintiff must plead that the defendant committed
some qualifying criminal action, the most common of which is mail, wire or
securities fraud.
Summary
RICO involves conduct associated with an enterprise and a pattern of
racketeering activity, which requires long-term, organized conduct. Section
1962(d) specifically prohibits conspiracy to violate other sections of RICO,
which aligns with the proposition that coordinated planning and execution of
multiple predicate acts by the defendants could constitute a conspiracy to
commit fraud and racketeering. The passage also highlights that wire fraud
is a common qualifying criminal action under RICO, supporting the
proposition's mention of wire fraud as part of the fraudulent acts.
