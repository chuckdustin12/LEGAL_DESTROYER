Question
The court is the sole judge of witness credibility and may choose to believe
or disbelieve any witness’s testimony. Texas courts have broad discretion in
family law matters and are not required to accept or reject testimony solely
based on prior dishonesty (see In re J.P.B., 180 S.W.3d 570, 573 (Tex. 2005)).
Even with credibility issues, the court could find some or all of the wife’s
testimony credible if corroborated by other evidence or circumstances.
Answer (Texas)
Short response
Texas law clearly establishes that the trial court is the sole judge of witness
credibility and may accept or reject any portion of a witness’s testimony,
even if the witness has a history of dishonesty, particularly when other
evidence corroborates the testimony. This broad discretion is especially
pronounced in family law matters, where courts are not required to
disbelieve testimony solely due to prior credibility issues.
Summary
Texas statutes and case law consistently affirm that the trial court, as
factfinder, has exclusive authority to determine the credibility and weight of
witness testimony in family law proceedings. Appellate courts defer to these
determinations unless they are unreasonable, and the trial court may
accept, reject, or partially credit testimony, even from a witness with a
history of dishonesty, especially if corroborated by other evidence or
circumstances.
This principle is codified in the Texas Family Code and reinforced by a long
line of appellate and Supreme Court decisions, which emphasize the trial
court’s unique position to observe witness demeanor and resolve evidentiary
conflicts. The law does not require the court to categorically reject
testimony due to impeachment or prior dishonesty; rather, the court may
find some or all of such testimony credible if supported by the record.
Background and Relevant Law
Legislative Framework
The Texas Family Code directly addresses the role of the court or jury in
evaluating spousal testimony in divorce proceedings. Section 6.704 of the
Texas Family Code provides that when a husband or wife testifies, the court
or jury trying the case is responsible for determining both the credibility of
the witness and the weight to be given to their testimony (Tex. Fam. Code §
6.704). This statutory provision does not impose any limitations based on a

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
witness’s prior dishonesty or impeachment; instead, it vests the factfinder
with full discretion to assess credibility and assign weight as it deems
appropriate.
Case Law
Texas appellate and Supreme Court decisions have repeatedly affirmed and
elaborated on the statutory principle that the trial court is the sole judge of
witness credibility and the weight of testimony. This doctrine is especially
robust in family law cases, where the trial court’s ability to observe witness
demeanor and assess the context of testimony is considered paramount.
Core Principles
Multiple recent appellate decisions reiterate that the trial court, as
factfinder in a bench trial, is uniquely positioned to observe and evaluate
witness demeanor, credibility, and the subtle influences that may not be
apparent from the written record. For example, the Texas Court of Appeals
in In re G.T. (2024) and In re J.C.H-P. (2023) both cite the Texas Supreme
Court’s decision in In re J.P.B., 180 S.W.3d 570 (Tex. 2005), emphasizing that
the trier of fact is the sole judge of credibility and that appellate courts must
defer to these determinations.
Similarly, In re P.D.H. (2024) and In re N.L.S. (2023) confirm that the trial
court may believe all, part, or none of a witness’s testimony, and that
appellate courts will not substitute their judgment for that of the trial court
on credibility issues. This principle is echoed in W.G. v. Tex. Dep't of Family
& Protective Servs. (2023), In re K.C.W. (2022), and In re J.L.W. (2021), all of
which stress the deference owed to the trial court’s credibility
determinations.
The Texas Supreme Court in In re A.B., 437 S.W.3d 498 (Tex. 2014) and In re
J.P.B., 180 S.W.3d 570 (Tex. 2005) has made clear that the factfinder is the
exclusive judge of witness credibility and that appellate review must respect
this role, intervening only if the credibility determination is unreasonable.
Application to Witnesses with Credibility Issues
The law does not require the trial court to reject testimony solely because a
witness has been impeached or has a history of dishonesty. Instead, the
court may accept, reject, or partially credit such testimony, particularly if it
is corroborated by other evidence or circumstances. For instance, In re
M.A.P. (2012) illustrates that a factfinder may disbelieve a witness whose
credibility is impaired by dishonesty, but by implication, may also choose to
believe some or all of that witness’s testimony if the record supports it.
This approach is further supported by In re S.T.G. (2018), which states that
appellate courts do not reweigh credibility but defer to the factfinder’s
reasonable determinations, and by In re I.G.W. (2018), which affirms that the
trial court’s orders will be upheld on any legal theory supported by the

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
evidence, including where the court has resolved credibility issues in favor
of one party.
Deference and Standard of Review
The standard of review for credibility determinations is highly deferential.
Appellate courts will not disturb the trial court’s findings unless they are
unreasonable or unsupported by substantive and probative evidence (In re
K.C.W. (2022); In re L.L.D. (2021)). This deference is rooted in the trial
court’s superior ability to observe witness demeanor and assess the context
of testimony, as repeatedly emphasized in the case law.
Superseded Authority
It is important to note that In re A.B., 412 S.W.3d 588 (Tex. App. 2013) has
been superseded by In re A.B., 437 S.W.3d 498 (Tex. 2014). The latter is now
the controlling authority and should be relied upon for the principle that the
factfinder is the sole judge of credibility and that appellate courts must defer
to these determinations.
Secondary Materials
Pattern jury instructions and related secondary materials reinforce the legal
principles established by statute and case law. For example, standard Texas
jury instructions state that the factfinder is the sole judge of witness
credibility and may accept or reject any testimony in whole or in part, even
after impeachment (Plaintiff's Requested Jury Instructions and Questions -
Gender Discrimination and Breach of Contract (2023)). While these
instructions are directed at juries, the same principles apply to judges
sitting as factfinders in bench trials, as is common in family law cases.
Analysis
The Court’s Role as Sole Judge of Credibility
The legislative and judicial authorities are unequivocal: the trial court (or
jury, where applicable) is the exclusive judge of witness credibility and the
weight to be given to testimony in Texas family law proceedings. Section
6.704 of the Texas Family Code directly assigns this responsibility to the
court or jury, and the case law uniformly affirms this allocation of authority
(Tex. Fam. Code § 6.704; In re J.P.B., 180 S.W.3d 570 (Tex. 2005); In re A.B.,
437 S.W.3d 498 (Tex. 2014)).
This means that the trial court is not bound to accept or reject testimony in
its entirety; rather, it may believe all, part, or none of any witness’s
testimony, as confirmed in In re P.D.H. (2024) and In re N.L.S. (2023). The
court’s discretion is particularly broad in family law matters, where the
factual context is often complex and the trial judge’s ability to observe
witness demeanor is critical.

Treatment of Witnesses with Credibility Issues
Texas law does not require the trial court to disbelieve a witness solely
because of prior dishonesty or impeachment. Instead, the court may
consider the entirety of the evidence, including corroborating
circumstances, and may credit testimony that is otherwise supported by the
record. This is illustrated in In re M.A.P. (2012), where the factfinder was
permitted to disbelieve a witness whose credibility was impaired by
dishonesty, but the principle applies equally in the reverse: the court may
believe testimony from a witness with credibility issues if corroborated.
The appellate courts’ role is limited to reviewing whether the trial court’s
credibility determinations are reasonable and supported by substantive and
probative evidence (In re K.C.W. (2022); In re L.L.D. (2021)). Appellate
courts do not reweigh credibility or substitute their judgment for that of the
trial court (In re S.T.G. (2018); In re I.G.W. (2018)).
Corroboration and Partial Credibility
The trial court’s discretion extends to crediting portions of a witness’s
testimony that are corroborated by other evidence or circumstances, even if
the witness has been impeached or has a history of dishonesty. The court
may accept, reject, or partially credit testimony as it deems appropriate,
based on its assessment of the evidence as a whole (In re P.D.H. (2024); In re
J.C.H-P. (2023); In re N.L.S. (2023)).
This approach is consistent with the pattern jury instructions, which state
that the factfinder may accept or reject any testimony in whole or in part,
and may assign whatever weight it deems appropriate to impeached
testimony (Plaintiff's Requested Jury Instructions and Questions and
Questions - Gender Discrimination and Breach of Contract (2023)).
Appellate Deference
Appellate courts are required to defer to the trial court’s credibility
determinations unless those determinations are unreasonable or
unsupported by the evidence (In re J.P.B., 180 S.W.3d 570 (Tex. 2005); In re
A.B., 437 S.W.3d 498 (Tex. 2014)). This deference is rooted in the trial
court’s superior ability to observe witness demeanor and assess the context
of testimony, as repeatedly emphasized in the case law.
The standard of review is abuse of discretion, and appellate courts will not
disturb the trial court’s findings unless there is no substantive and probative
evidence to support them (In re L.L.D. (2021); In re I.G.W. (2018)). This high
threshold ensures that the trial court’s credibility determinations are rarely
overturned on appeal.
Superseded Authority
As noted, In re A.B., 412 S.W.3d 588 (Tex. App. 2013) has been superseded
by In re A.B., 437 S.W.3d 498 (Tex. 2014). The latter is now the controlling

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
authority and should be relied upon for the principle that the factfinder is
the sole judge of credibility and that appellate courts must defer to these
determinations.
Exceptions and Caveats
While the trial court’s discretion in assessing credibility is broad, it is not
unlimited. Appellate courts may intervene if the trial court’s credibility
determinations are unreasonable or unsupported by substantive and
probative evidence (In re K.C.W. (2022); In re J.P.B., 180 S.W.3d 570 (Tex.
2005)). However, this is a high bar, and in practice, appellate courts rarely
overturn credibility determinations.
Additionally, while the court may credit testimony from a witness with a
history of dishonesty if corroborated by other evidence, it must still base its
findings on the record as a whole. The court cannot arbitrarily disregard
uncontroverted evidence or make findings that are unsupported by the
evidence (In re H.R.M., 209 S.W.3d 105 (Tex. 2006)).
Conclusion
Texas law is clear that the trial court is the sole judge of witness credibility
and may accept, reject, or partially credit any testimony, even from a
witness with a history of dishonesty, particularly when corroborated by other
evidence or circumstances. This principle is codified in the Texas Family
Code and reinforced by a long line of appellate and Supreme Court
decisions, which emphasize the trial court’s unique position to observe
witness demeanor and resolve evidentiary conflicts. Appellate courts defer
to these determinations unless they are unreasonable or unsupported by the
evidence. Thus, in family law matters, the court has broad discretion to find
some or all of a witness’s testimony credible, even in the face of prior
credibility issues, provided the record supports such a finding.

However, as we have noted previously, witness credibility issues 'that

Summary
The Court emphasizes that credibility determinations belong to the
factfinder (jury/trial court), and appellate courts defer to those
determinations. The statement that it was within the jury’s province to
disbelieve a witness underscores that the factfinder may accept or reject
testimony in whole or part based on demeanor and the record, consistent
with broad discretion in family-law contexts and the ability to credit
testimony when corroborated by other evidence.

Extract
A determination of standing under this section is necessarily fact specific
and resolved on an ad hoc basis. In re M.P.B., 257 S.W.3d at 809.
Accordingly, such determinations are situations where the trial court is the
sole judge of witness credibility and the weight to be given their testimony
and we do not disturb the trial court's resolution of evidentiary conflicts that
turn on credibility determinations or the weight of the evidence. See In re
I.I.G.T., 412 S.W.3d at 806 (citing City of Keller v. Wilson, 168 S.W.3d 802,
819 (Tex. 2005) and Golden Eagle Archery, Inc. v. Jackson, 116 S.W.3d 757,
761 (Tex. 2003)).
Summary
The court of appeals affirms that in family-law matters involving fact-specific
determinations, the trial court is the sole judge of witness credibility and the
weight of testimony. Appellate courts will not disturb credibility-based
resolutions. This supports the proposition that a trial court may believe or
disbelieve any witness and, despite prior credibility issues, accept testimony
if corroborated, consistent with broad discretion recognized in cases like In

Summary
The passages explicitly state that the factfinder is the only judge of witness
credibility and may accept or reject any portion of testimony. This directly
supports the proposition’s core point that courts can credit or discount
testimony, even in the face of credibility issues, particularly when
corroborated by other evidence. While Gaston is a criminal case, the
principle of deference to the factfinder’s credibility determinations is
broadly recognized in Texas and is consistent with the family-law discretion
component referenced by In re J.P.B.

Summary
The passage explicitly states credibility determinations are the factfinder’s
exclusive province and cites In re J.P.B., aligning with the proposition that
courts may believe or disbelieve testimony and are not bound by prior
dishonesty alone. It supports that a trial court can accept parts of testimony
if supported by the record, with appellate courts deferring unless
unreasonable.

illustrates that a factfinder may disbelieve a witness whose credibility is
impaired by dishonesty, and by implication may believe or disbelieve

(trial court/jury), that appellate courts defer even when the record shows
credibility issues, and that the factfinder may accept or reject parts of
testimony. This supports the proposition that courts need not categorically
reject testimony due to credibility concerns and may believe testimony if
corroborated.

Summary
The Texas Supreme Court explicitly states that the factfinder (judge or jury)
is the “sole arbiter” of witness credibility and demeanor. This supports the
proposition that the trial court may believe or disbelieve testimony and that
appellate courts must defer to those credibility determinations, even where
credibility is contested. While the passage is in the termination context, the
credibility principle is general and aligns with In re J.P.B. and related
authorities.

Extract
In reviewing termination findings for factual sufficiency, a court of appeals
must give due deference to a jury's factfindings, In re C.H., 89 S.W.3d 17, 27
(Tex.2002), and should not supplant the jury's judgment with its own, Golden
Eagle Archery, Inc. v. Jackson, 116 S.W.3d 757, 761 (Tex.2003). The court
should inquire 'whether the evidence is such that a factfinder could
reasonably form a firm belief or conviction about the truth of the []
allegations.' In re C.H., 89 S.W.3d at 25. 'If, in light of the entire record, the
disputed evidence that a reasonable factfinder could not have credited in
favor of the finding is so significant that a factfinder could not reasonably
have formed a firm belief or conviction, then the evidence is factually
insufficient.'
Summary
The passage emphasizes appellate deference to the factfinder’s (jury’s)
determinations and forbids substituting appellate judgment for the
factfinder’s. Credibility determinations are core factfinder functions; thus,
this supports that the trial factfinder may believe or disbelieve testimony
and appellate courts will not reweigh credibility absent insufficiency. This
aligns with broad discretion in family law factfinding and allows acceptance
of testimony despite credibility attacks if a firm belief can be formed from
the whole record.

incompetent evidence is legally insufficient to support a judgment, even if
admitted without objection... an appellate court conducting a legal

one light, and reasonable jurors can reach only one conclusion from it.
Summary
City of Keller clarifies that fact-finders (jurors/trial courts) may disregard
evidence and make credibility choices, and appellate courts defer to those
determinations except in narrow circumstances (e.g., incompetent evidence
or conclusive contrary proof). This supports the idea that a trial court can
believe or disbelieve witness testimony and is not compelled to reject
testimony solely due to credibility attacks, so long as some evidence
supports the finding and no conclusive contrary proof exists. That aligns
with Texas courts' discretion in weighing testimony, including in family
cases, consistent with In re J.P.B.

The opinion explicitly states that the trial court, as factfinder, makes
credibility determinations, and appellate courts defer to those

substantive and probative evidence can support the court’s decision,
reinforcing that the court may credit portions of testimony despite
credibility concerns.

‘In reviewing the legal sufficiency of the evidence to support the termination

‘[A] reviewing court must assume that the factfinder resolved disputed facts
in favor of its finding if a reasonable factfinder could do so.’ ... ‘In reviewing
the factual sufficiency of the evidence ... A [reviewing court] should consider
whether disputed evidence is such that a reasonable factfinder could not

court must hold the evidence to be factually insufficient if, in light of the
entire record, the disputed evidence contrary to the judgment is so
significant that a reasonable factfinder could not have resolved that disputed
evidence in favor of the ultimate finding.’
Summary
The quoted standards require appellate courts to defer to the factfinder’s
resolution of disputed evidence, which necessarily includes credibility
determinations. By instructing courts to view evidence in the light most
favorable to the finding and to assume the factfinder resolved disputes in
favor of its findings, the passages support that the trial court may believe or
disbelieve testimony—even amid credibility issues—so long as a reasonable
factfinder could do so, especially when other evidence corroborates it.

factfinder's role to draw any reasonable inferences from the evidence that it
chooses and to choose between conflicting reasonable inferences.
Summary
The passage states the factfinder is the sole arbiter of credibility and may
disbelieve any witness, and can draw reasonable inferences—supporting
that courts may accept or reject testimony in whole or in part, even where
credibility is contested, especially if supported by other evidence. This aligns
with the proposition’s core: credibility determinations rest with the trial
court, which may credit testimony despite prior dishonesty if corroborated.

Summary
The passages affirm that no witness, including experts, may opine directly
on another witness’s truthfulness because doing so would invade the
factfinder’s exclusive role to assess credibility. This supports the proposition
that the court (as factfinder in a bench trial or the jury otherwise) is the sole
judge of credibility and may accept or reject testimony in whole or in part,
regardless of prior dishonesty, consistent with In re J.P.B.

Summary
The quoted language expressly states the trier of fact is the sole judge of
credibility (citing In re J.P.B.) and that appellate courts defer to the trial
court’s credibility determinations, particularly in bench trials. This supports
the proposition that the court may believe or disbelieve testimony and
exercise broad discretion, even where credibility is contested, allowing it to
credit testimony in whole or in part if supported by the record.
T. A. W. v. Tex. Dep't of Family & Protective Servs., NO. 03-20-00364-CV
(Tex. App. Jan 08, 2021)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
In our review, we must 'provide due deference to the decisions of the
factfinder, who, having full opportunity to observe witness testimony first-
hand, is the sole arbiter when assessing the credibility and demeanor of
witnesses.' In re A.B., 437 S.W.3d 498, 503 (Tex. 2014); In re J.P.B., 180 S.W.
3d 570, 573 (Tex. 2005). ... Having considered the evidence related to best
interest, deferring to the trial court's determinations on witness credibility,
the resolution of conflicts in the evidence, and the weight to be given the
testimony, see A.B., 437 S.W.3d at 503, we hold that the Holley factors weigh
in favor of the trial court's finding...
Summary
The passages reaffirm that the trial court, as factfinder in a bench trial, is
the sole arbiter of witness credibility and that appellate courts defer to those
determinations. This supports the proposition that the court may believe or
disbelieve testimony, even amid credibility issues, and may resolve conflicts
and assign weight to testimony, including accepting portions corroborated
by other evidence.

resolved disputed facts in favor of its finding if a reasonable factfinder could
have done so, and we disregard all evidence that a reasonable factfinder
could have disbelieved or found incredible.
Summary
The passages state that appellate courts defer to the trial court (factfinder)
on credibility, do not reweigh credibility, and assume disputed facts were
resolved in favor of the findings while disregarding evidence a reasonable
factfinder could disbelieve. This confirms the trial court’s authority to
believe or disbelieve testimony, even where credibility is contested, aligning
with the proposition that courts can credit parts of testimony and need not
reject testimony solely due to prior dishonesty when other evidence
supports it.
In re J.L.W., 04-21-00141-CV (Tex. App. Sep 22, 2021)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
In both legal and factual sufficiency review, the trial court, as factfinder, is
the sole judge of the weight and credibility of the evidence... We must defer
to the factfinder’s resolution of disputed evidentiary issues and cannot
substitute our judgment for that of the factfinder. See, e.g., In re H.R.M.,
209 S.W.3d 105, 108 (Tex. 2006) (per curiam) (factual sufficiency); In re
J.P.B., 180 S.W.3d 570, 573 (Tex. 2005) (legal sufficiency).
Summary
The passage explicitly states the trial court is the sole judge of weight and
credibility and that appellate courts defer to those determinations, citing In
re J.P.B. This supports the notion that the court may credit or discredit
testimony, even amid credibility concerns, and can rely on corroborating
evidence.

appeal.' ... We therefore defer to the trial court's judgment regarding
credibility determinations.
Summary
The passage expressly states the trier of fact is the sole judge of credibility
(citing In re J.P.B.) and emphasizes appellate deference to trial courts’
credibility determinations in bench trials. This supports that a trial court
may accept or reject testimony in whole or part and is not constrained to
disbelieve testimony due to prior dishonesty, particularly where other
evidence corroborates it.
In re J.C.H-P.
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The trier of fact is the sole judge of the credibility of witnesses and the
weight to be given their testimony. J.P.B., 180 S.W.3d at 573. In a bench trial,
such as here, 'the trial judge is best able to observe and assess the
witnesses' demeanor and credibility, and to sense the 'forces, powers, and
influences' that may not be apparent from merely reading the record on
appeal.' ... We therefore defer to the trial court's judgment regarding
credibility determinations.
Summary
The court of appeals reaffirms that the trier of fact (here, the trial judge in a
bench trial) is the sole judge of witness credibility and weight of testimony,
citing In re J.P.B. Appellate courts defer to these credibility determinations.
This supports that the trial court has broad discretion to credit or discredit
testimony, even where credibility has been challenged, and may rely on
corroborating circumstances or other evidence in doing so.
In re K.C.W.
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Under the factual sufficiency standard, we defer to the factfinder's
determinations on the credibility of the witnesses 'so long as those
determinations are not themselves unreasonable.' In re J.P.B., 180 S.W.3d

S.W.3d 607, 625 (Tex. 2004)); see also In re C.H., 89 S.W.3d 17, 26 (Tex.
2002) ('A standard that focuses on whether a reasonable jury could form a
firm conviction or belief retains the deference an appellate court must have

fact[]finder and is the sole judge of witness credibility.' In re A.M., 418 S.W.
3d 830, 841 (Tex. App.-Dallas 2013, no pet.) (citing Nguyen v. Nguyen, 355
S.W.3d 82, 88 (Tex. App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2011, pet. denied)). 'The
fact[]finder may choose to believe one witness over another, and we may not
impose our own opinion to the contrary.' Id. (citing Nguyen, 355 S.W.3d at
88).
Summary
The Texas appellate courts defer to the trial court’s credibility
determinations unless unreasonable (citing In re J.P.B.). In a bench trial, the
trial court is expressly “the sole judge of witness credibility” and may choose
to believe one witness over another. These principles support that a trial
court in a family law case has broad discretion to credit or discount
testimony, even if there are credibility concerns, and may accept portions
corroborated by other evidence. The deference articulated in J.P.B. and
related cases underpins that prior dishonesty does not compel rejection of
testimony.

Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
"We also recognize that the trial court, as the factfinder, is the sole arbiter of
a witness' demeanor and credibility, and it may believe all, part, or none of a
witness' testimony." In re A.M., No. 06-18-00012-CV, 2018 WL 3077784, at
*3 (Tex. App.-Texarkana June 22, 2018, pet. denied) (mem. op.) (citing In re
H.R.M., 209 S.W.3d at 109).
Summary
The passage expressly states the trial court is the sole arbiter of credibility
and may believe all, part, or none of any testimony. That directly supports
the proposition that the court can credit or discredit testimony in whole or
in part, even when there are credibility concerns. Although the excerpt does
not mention prior dishonesty expressly, it confirms the court’s broad
discretion on credibility determinations in family-law contexts.

We must 'provide due deference to the decisions of the factfinder, who,
having full opportunity to observe witness testimony first-hand, is the sole
arbiter when assessing the credibility and demeanor of witnesses.' ...
'Because the factfinder 'is the sole arbiter of the witnesses' credibility and
demeanor,' appellate review must defer to the trial court's factual
determinations, even in parental termination cases.'" ... "'As conservatorship
determinations are 'intensely fact driven,' the trial court is in the best
position to 'observe the demeanor and personalities of the witnesses and can
"feel" the forces, powers, and influences that cannot be discerned by merely
reading the record.'
Summary
The passages confirm that Texas trial courts are the sole arbiters of witness
credibility and that appellate courts defer to those determinations. They also
emphasize the trial court’s broad discretion in fact-intensive family law
matters, supporting that a court may accept or reject testimony (in whole or
part) based on its credibility assessment, including considering
corroborating evidence despite credibility concerns.
In re A.L.E., 279 S.W.3d 424 (Tex. App. 2009)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Legal and factual insufficiency challenges are not independent grounds for
asserting error in custody determinations, but are relevant factors in
assessing whether the trial court abused its discretion.... An abuse of
discretion does not occur if some evidence of a substantive and probative
character exists to support the trial court's decision. ... We consider only the
evidence most favorable to the trial court's ruling, and will uphold its
judgment on any legal theory supported by the evidence.
Summary
The passage emphasizes the deferential abuse-of-discretion standard in
custody cases, requiring appellate courts to view the evidence in the light
most favorable to the trial court’s ruling and to uphold the judgment if
supported by some substantive, probative evidence. This deference implies
the trial court’s primacy in resolving conflicts in testimony and assessing
credibility, consistent with the proposition that the court can choose to
believe or disbelieve testimony and is not compelled to reject it due to
credibility issues if there is supporting evidence.

Extract
Accordingly, in reviewing the evidence for legal sufficiency in parental
termination cases, we 'look at all the evidence in the light most favorable to
the finding to determine whether a reasonable trier of fact could have
formed a firm belief or conviction that its finding was true.' ... In conducting
our review, we must disregard all evidence that a reasonable trier of fact
could have disbelieved; however, we must consider undisputed evidence
even if it does not support the finding.
Summary
The mandate to view evidence in the light most favorable to the finding and
to disregard evidence a reasonable factfinder could have disbelieved reflects
that the trial court (as trier of fact) is entrusted with credibility
determinations and may choose to credit or discount testimony. This
supports the principle that the court can believe or disbelieve any witness
and that appellate courts defer to that role, even where there are credibility
concerns, especially if other evidence corroborates portions of testimony.

Wife
Extract
If the husband or wife testifies, the court or jury trying the case shall
determine the credibility of the witness and the weight to be given the
witness's testimony.
Summary
The statute explicitly assigns to the court or jury the role of determining the
credibility and weight of a spouse’s testimony in divorce proceedings. This
supports the proposition that the fact-finder is the sole judge of credibility
and may accept or reject testimony, in whole or in part. While the statute
does not mention prior dishonesty, its allocation of credibility assessment to
the fact-finder aligns with the proposition that courts have discretion to
credit testimony notwithstanding impeachment, especially when
corroborated by other evidence.

believability of each witness and the weight to be given to his or her

Summary
The passages explicitly state that the factfinder is the sole judge of witness
credibility and may accept or reject any witness’s testimony in whole or in
part, even after impeachment. This aligns with the proposition that courts
(as factfinders in family bench trials) have broad discretion to credit or
discredit testimony, including testimony from a witness with prior
dishonesty, especially when corroborated.

Summary
The PJC language confirms that the fact-finder in Texas (jury or, in a bench
trial, the judge) is the sole arbiter of witness credibility and may accept or
reject testimony in whole or in part, even after impeachment. This aligns
with the proposition that courts need not automatically discard testimony
due to prior dishonesty and may credit portions corroborated by other
evidence.

the evidence is not necessarily determined by the number of witnesses... You
may find that the testimony of one witness... is more credible than the
testimony of a larger number of witnesses to the contrary.
Summary
The PJC-based instructions state that the fact-finder is the sole judge of
witness credibility, can accept or reject any testimony in whole or in part,
and may weigh corroboration and impeachment. This supports the
proposition that Texas fact-finders are not required to disbelieve testimony
solely due to prior dishonesty and may credit testimony if corroborated.
While the text addresses juries, Texas law applies the same credibility
principle to judges sitting as fact-finders in family law cases, aligning with In
re J.P.B.’s deference to the fact-finder on credibility.
