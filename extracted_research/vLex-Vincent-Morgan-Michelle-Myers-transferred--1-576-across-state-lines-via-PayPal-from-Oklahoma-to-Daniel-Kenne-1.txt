Question
Morgan Michelle Myers transferred $1,576 across state lines via PayPal
from Oklahoma to Daniel Kenneth Branthoover, who used the funds to
purchase a second phone for fraudulent purposes. RICO requires that the
enterprise’s activities affect interstate or foreign commerce (18 U.S.C. §
1962). Even minimal effects on interstate commerce are sufficient to satisfy
this element. (United States v. Robertson, 514 U.S. 669 (1995)). The transfer
of funds across state lines via PayPal and the use of those funds to further
the fraudulent scheme demonstrate an effect on interstate commerce,
satisfying this element of RICO.
Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
The transfer of $1,576 via PayPal across state lines from Oklahoma to fund
fraudulent activities satisfies RICO's interstate commerce requirement.
Courts have consistently held that even minimal effects on interstate
commerce are sufficient to meet this jurisdictional element of RICO.
Summary
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) requires
that an enterprise's activities affect interstate or foreign commerce as a
jurisdictional element under 18 U.S.C. § 1962. In the scenario presented,
Morgan Michelle Myers transferred $1,576 via PayPal across state lines
from Oklahoma to Daniel Kenneth Branthoover, who subsequently used
these funds to purchase a second phone for fraudulent purposes. This
transfer of funds across state lines and its use in furthering a fraudulent
scheme constitutes activity that affects interstate commerce, thereby
satisfying this essential element of RICO.
Courts have consistently interpreted RICO's interstate commerce
requirement broadly, holding that even minimal or de minimis effects on
interstate commerce are sufficient to satisfy this jurisdictional element. The
use of interstate instrumentalities, such as electronic fund transfers across
state lines via services like PayPal, has been recognized as establishing the
necessary nexus with interstate commerce required by RICO. This
interpretation is supported by extensive case law and secondary materials
that emphasize the minimal threshold needed to demonstrate an effect on
interstate commerce under RICO.

Background and Relevant Legislation
18 U.S.C. § 1962 - Prohibited Activities
The foundation of RICO is established in 18 U.S.C. § 1962, which prohibits
specific activities related to enterprises engaged in or affecting interstate
commerce. The statute specifically states:
"It shall be unlawful for any person through a pattern of racketeering
activity or through collection of an unlawful debt to acquire or maintain,
directly or indirectly, any interest in or control of any enterprise which is
engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign
commerce." 18 U.S.C. § 1962
This provision explicitly requires that the enterprise in question must either
be "engaged in" interstate or foreign commerce or that the "activities" of the
enterprise "affect" interstate or foreign commerce. This requirement serves
as a jurisdictional hook that brings the prohibited conduct within the
purview of federal law under the Commerce Clause.
18 U.S.C. § 1343 - Fraud By Wire, Radio, Or Television
Although the primary focus is on § 1962, it's worth noting that wire fraud
under 18 U.S.C. § 1343 is often a predicate act for RICO violations and is
relevant to the interstate nature of the activity described:
"Whoever, having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to
defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent
pretenses, representations, or promises, transmits or causes to be
transmitted by means of wire, radio, or television communication in
interstate or foreign commerce, any writings, signs, signals, pictures, or
sounds for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice, shall be fined
under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both." 18 U.S.C. §
1343
This statute is relevant because the electronic transfer of funds via PayPal
across state lines could constitute wire fraud if done as part of a fraudulent
scheme, providing a potential predicate act for RICO purposes.
Case Law Analysis
The Interstate Commerce Requirement
The courts have consistently interpreted RICO's interstate commerce
requirement broadly. In BCCI Holdings v. Khalil, Civil Action No. 95-1252 (D.
D.C. 6/23/1999), the court explained that an enterprise is engaged in
interstate and foreign commerce when it is "directly engaged in the
production, distribution, or acquisition of goods and services in interstate
commerce." The court further clarified that "the interstate commerce

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
requirement is met if either the activity of the enterprise or the predicate
acts of racketeering affect interstate commerce."
This interpretation aligns with the Supreme Court's ruling in United States
v. Robertson, as referenced in the question, which established that even
minimal effects on interstate commerce are sufficient to satisfy this element
of RICO.
De Minimis Standard for Interstate Commerce Effects
Multiple courts have affirmed that only a minimal impact on interstate
commerce is necessary to support a RICO conviction. In Puerto Rico Am.
Ins. Co. v. Burgos, 867 F.Supp.2d 216 (D. P.R. 2011), the court stated:
"[O]nly a minimal effect on interstate commerce is necessary... United States
v. Owens, 167 F.3d 739, 755 (1st Cir.1999) (holding that only a minimal
effect on interstate commerce is necessary)... United States v. Johnson, 440
F.3d 832, 841 (6th Cir.2006) (ruling that '[o]nly a minimal impact on
interstate commerce is necessary to support a RICO conviction' and that 'the
interstate nature of the predicate acts themselves can establish the required
connection between the enterprise and the interstate commerce.')"
This de minimis standard is further supported by additional case law. In 
Huntington Nat'l Bank v. Guishard, Wilburn & Shorts, LLC, Case No. 2:12-
CV-1035 (S.D. Ohio Nov 26, 2012), the court recognized that "because many
of the federal checks at issue were knowingly stolen from out-of-state
payees, and the substantial portions of the fraudulently obtained funds
appear to have been transferred out of state, such conduct also constitutes
interstate transport of stolen property within the meaning of the RICO
statute."
This case is particularly relevant to the scenario at hand, as it involves the
transfer of funds across state lines as part of a fraudulent scheme, similar to
the PayPal transfer from Oklahoma to fund the purchase of a phone for
fraudulent purposes.
Predicate Acts and Interstate Commerce
The courts have evolved in their interpretation of what satisfies RICO's
interstate commerce requirement. While some courts initially held that the
enterprise itself must affect interstate commerce, many courts now
recognize that the predicate acts alone can establish the necessary nexus
with interstate commerce.
In P & P MARKETING, INC. v. Ditton, 746 F. Supp. 1354 (N.D. Ill. 1990), the
court explained:
"For purposes of the predicate acts of mail and wire fraud, 18 USC §§ 1341
and 1343, it is not required that the false representations be sent through
the U.S. mails or made through the use of interstate wires... It is only
necessary to have a scheme to defraud coupled with a mailing or use of
interstate wires in furtherance of the scheme and the use of the mails or

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
interstate wires need not be an essential part of the scheme, but it is
sufficient if such use is incident to an essential component of the scheme."
This interpretation is particularly relevant to the scenario involving PayPal
transfers across state lines, as it suggests that the use of interstate wires
(electronic fund transfers) in furtherance of a fraudulent scheme is sufficient
to establish the interstate commerce nexus required by RICO, even if the use
of interstate wires was not an essential part of the scheme.
Instrumental Use of Interstate Commerce
In Wanamaker v. Columbian Rope Co., 740 F.Supp. 127 (N.D. N.Y. 1990), the
court outlined the essential elements of a RICO claim, including that "the
activities of which affect interstate commerce or foreign commerce." This
reinforces that an effect on interstate commerce is an essential element that
must be alleged and proven in a RICO action.
The secondary materials provide further clarity on this point. According to 
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (2022-07-01):
"United States v. Delgado, 401 F.3d 290, 297 (5th Cir. 2005) (finding that the
use of interstate instrumentalities is sufficient to show the minimal nexus
with interstate commerce necessary for RICO);"
This confirms that the use of interstate instrumentalities, such as PayPal for
transferring funds across state lines, is sufficient to establish the minimal
nexus with interstate commerce necessary for RICO.
Analysis of Secondary Materials
Secondary materials provide additional support and clarification on the
interstate commerce requirement under RICO.
Minimal Effect Standard
The RICO: A Primer (2022-01-31) emphasizes that to prove a violation of
Section 1962(c), a plaintiff must prove several elements, including that
"[t]he enterprise engaged in, or its activities affected, interstate or foreign
commerce." This source confirms that the effect on interstate commerce is
one of the essential elements that must be established in a RICO claim.
In Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy (2024-01-01), it is stated that "RICO
requires no more than a slight effect upon interstate commerce. Even a
minimal effect on interstate commerce satisfies this jurisdictional
requirement." This resource directly supports the proposition that the
transfer of funds across state lines via PayPal would satisfy RICO's interstate
commerce requirement.

=== PAGE 5 ===

De Minimis Impact
Multiple secondary sources consistently affirm the de minimis standard for
RICO's interstate commerce requirement. According to What can RICO not
do? RICO and the non-economic intrastate enterprise that perpetrates only
non-economic racketeering activity (2009-03-22):
"RICO's jurisdictional element only requires an effect on interstate
commerce. Affecting interstate commerce implies a very minimal nexus
between the racketeering activity or enterprise and interstate commerce...
Historically, the Government needed to provide evidence sufficient to
establish only a de minimis nexus between interstate commerce and the
defendant's enterprise or individual predicate acts."
Similarly, Racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations (2005-03-22)
notes:
"See United States v. Feliciano, 223 F.3d 102, 117 (2d Cir. 2000) (holding
'effect on interstate or foreign commerce could have occurred in any way,
and it need only have been minimal'); United States v. Frega, 179 F.3d 793,
800 (9th Cir. 1999) (requiring individual predicate acts of racketeering only
have a de minimis impact on interstate commerce); United States v. Owens,
167 F.3d 739, 755 (1st Cir. 1999) (holding only a minimal effect on interstate
commerce is necessary)..."
These sources confirm that courts have consistently interpreted RICO's
interstate commerce requirement broadly, requiring only a minimal or de
minimis effect on interstate commerce.
Evolution of Court Interpretation
Secondary materials also document the evolution of court interpretations
regarding what satisfies RICO's interstate commerce requirement.
According to Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (2021-07-01):
"Alleged racketeering activity must impact interstate commerce to be
actionable under RICO. Courts exercise RICO jurisdiction when the
enterprise itself affects interstate commerce or when the predicate acts
have at least a de minimis impact on interstate commerce. The effect on
interstate commerce must be demonstrated by 'proof of a probable or
potential impact.' Effect on interstate commerce may also be established by
examining how the enterprise's actions impacted the victim of the predicate
acts."
Similarly, Racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations (2007-03-22)
states:
"For RICO to apply, the alleged racketeering activity must affect interstate
commerce. Courts initially held that the enterprise itself, and not the
predicate acts, must affect interstate commerce. However, many courts now
exercise RICO jurisdiction if the predicate acts have a de minimis impact on

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
interstate commerce, demonstrated by 'proof of a probable or potential
impact.'"
This evolution in court interpretation is further documented in Racketeer
influenced and corrupt organizations (1997-01-01):
"The racketeering activity must have some effect on interstate commerce.
Courts initially held that the enterprise itself, and not the predicate acts,
must affect interstate commerce. However, many courts now exercise
jurisdiction when the predicate acts form a nexus with interstate commerce.
In R.A.G.S. Couture, Inc. v. Hyatt, the Fifth Circuit held that as long as
interstate commerce is affected by either the enterprise or its 'activities,'
RICO's 'interstate commerce' requirement is satisfied. These 'activities' can
even be the illegal predicate acts themselves."
These sources collectively demonstrate that while courts initially required
the enterprise itself to affect interstate commerce, many courts now
recognize that the predicate acts themselves can establish the necessary
nexus with interstate commerce if they have even a minimal impact on
interstate commerce.
Predicate Acts as Sufficient Basis
Several secondary sources specifically address the sufficiency of predicate
acts in establishing the interstate commerce nexus. According to Racketeer
influenced and corrupt organizations (2006-03-22):
"Courts initially held that the enterprise itself, and not the predicate acts,
must affect interstate commerce. However, many courts now exercise RICO
jurisdiction if the predicate acts have a de minimis impact on interstate
commerce, demonstrated by 'proof of a probable or potential impact.'
Additionally, this element may be satisfied if the enterprise's activities have
an impact on interstate commerce, which includes activities that 'affect
interstate commerce by impacting the victim.'"
Similarly, Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (1999-06-22)
states:
"The alleged racketeering activity must affect interstate commerce. Courts
initially held that the enterprise itself, and not the predicate acts, must
affect interstate commerce. In contrast, many courts now exercise RICO
jurisdiction if the predicate acts have a de minimis impact on interstate
commerce, demonstrated by 'proof of a probable or potential impact.'
Moreover, the enterprise's activities may be held to impact interstate
commerce indirectly; that is, its activities 'may affect interstate commerce
by impacting the victim.'"
These sources reinforce the understanding that predicate acts, such as wire
fraud involving interstate fund transfers, can themselves establish the
necessary impact on interstate commerce required by RICO.

Application to the Facts
Applying the legal framework established by the legislation, case law, and
secondary materials to the scenario presented:
Interstate Nature of the Transaction: Morgan Michelle Myers
transferred $1,576 via PayPal from Oklahoma across state lines to
Daniel Kenneth Branthoover. This electronic transfer of funds across
state lines constitutes the use of an interstate instrumentality, which
courts have recognized as sufficient to establish a minimal nexus with
interstate commerce necessary for RICO (Racketeer Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations (2022-07-01)).
Fraudulent Purpose: The funds were used to purchase a second
phone for fraudulent purposes. This connects the interstate transfer to
a potentially fraudulent scheme, which could constitute wire fraud
under 18 U.S.C. § 1343, a common predicate act for RICO purposes.
De Minimis Effect: Courts have consistently held that only a minimal
effect on interstate commerce is necessary to satisfy RICO's
jurisdictional element (Puerto Rico Am. Ins. Co. v. Burgos, 867 F.Supp.
2d 216 (D. P.R. 2011)). The transfer of $1,576 across state lines, while
not a large sum, is sufficient to satisfy this de minimis standard.
Predicate Acts as Basis: Modern court interpretations allow
predicate acts themselves to establish the necessary nexus with
interstate commerce (Racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations
(1997-01-01)). The interstate wire transfer in furtherance of a
fraudulent scheme could serve as a predicate act that establishes this
nexus.
Enterprise Activities: RICO requires that the enterprise's activities
affect interstate commerce. If the enterprise in question includes the
participants in the fraudulent scheme, then the enterprise's activities
(transferring funds across state lines to purchase a phone for
fraudulent purposes) clearly affect interstate commerce.
Exceptions and Caveats
While the analysis strongly suggests that the interstate transfer of funds via
PayPal satisfies RICO's interstate commerce requirement, there are a few
caveats to consider:
Enterprise Requirement: RICO requires not just predicate acts, but
also an "enterprise." As stated in BCCI Holdings v. Khalil, Civil Action
No. 95-1252 (D. D.C. 6/23/1999): "A RICO 'enterprise' includes 'any
individual, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity,
and any union or group of individuals associated in fact although not a
legal entity.' 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4). An enterprise is established by a
common purpose among the participants, organization, and continuity."

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
The scenario as presented does not provide detailed information about
the enterprise structure. A complete RICO analysis would require
establishing that an enterprise exists with a common purpose,
organization, and continuity.
Pattern of Racketeering Activity: RICO requires a "pattern of
racketeering activity," which generally means at least two predicate
acts within a ten-year period. The scenario describes only one transfer
of funds, which might be insufficient to establish a pattern unless other
predicate acts can be identified.
Jurisdictional Variance: While the majority trend is to accept a de
minimis effect on interstate commerce, there may be some
jurisdictional variance in how strictly courts apply this standard. As
noted in Defending Civil RICO Claims: A Defense Plan Should Be In
Every Business's Arsenal (2022-02-03): "If the alleged conduct does not
affect interstate commerce, it must be dismissed." The specifics of how
the funds were used and how the fraudulent scheme operated could be
relevant to determining whether the interstate commerce requirement
is satisfied in a particular jurisdiction.
Conclusion
Based on the legislative framework, case law, and secondary materials
examined, the transfer of $1,576 across state lines via PayPal from
Oklahoma to fund fraudulent activities satisfies RICO's interstate commerce
requirement. Courts have consistently held that even minimal effects on
interstate commerce are sufficient to meet this jurisdictional element of
RICO, and the use of interstate instrumentalities like electronic fund
transfers has been specifically recognized as establishing the necessary
nexus with interstate commerce.
The evolution of court interpretations, as documented in multiple secondary
sources, shows a clear trend toward accepting that predicate acts
themselves can establish the necessary impact on interstate commerce if
they have even a minimal effect. In this scenario, the interstate transfer of
funds via PayPal and their subsequent use to purchase a phone for
fraudulent purposes clearly demonstrates an effect on interstate commerce,
thereby satisfying this element of RICO.
While additional elements would need to be established for a complete RICO
case—such as the existence of an enterprise and a pattern of racketeering
activity—the interstate commerce requirement appears to be satisfied based
on the facts presented and the legal authorities reviewed.

For purposes of the predicate acts of mail and wire fraud, 18 USC §§ 1341
and 1343, it is not required that the false representations be sent through
the U.S. mails or made through the use of interstate wires. U.S. v. Lea, 618 F.
2d 426, 430 (7th Cir.1980). It is only necessary to have a scheme to defraud
coupled with a mailing or use of interstate wires in furtherance of the
scheme and the use of the mails or interstate wires need not be an essential
part of the scheme, but it is sufficient if such use is incident to an essential
component of the scheme. Id. The defendant need not have personally used
the mails or interstate wires, it is sufficient that their use by others was
reasonably foreseeable.
Summary
The use of interstate wires, such as transferring funds via PayPal across
state lines, can be considered incidental to an essential component of a
fraudulent scheme. This supports the proposition that the transfer of funds
across state lines via PayPal affects interstate commerce, satisfying the
RICO requirement.

Furthermore, to the extent that Plaintiffs provide coverage for their policy
holders outside of Puerto Rico, e.g., in the continental United States,
Plaintiffs engage in the distribution or acquisition of goods or services in
interstate commerce. Accordingly, Plaintiffs comply with the first element of
a substantive RICO claim. See Aetna, 43 F.3d at 1558 (finding that a
legitimate business which is a major property and casualty insurer doing
business in many states is an 'enterprise' affecting interstate commerce
under RICO); United States v. Owens, 167 F.3d 739, 755 (1st Cir.1999)
(holding that only a minimal effect on interstate commerce is necessary),
rev'd in part on other grounds, 483 F.3d 48 (1st Cir.2007); United States v.

impact on interstate commerce is necessary to support a RICO conviction'
and that 'the interstate nature of the predicate acts themselves can establish
the required connection between the enterprise and the interstate
commerce.')
Summary
The court recognizes that even minimal effects on interstate commerce are
sufficient to satisfy the RICO requirement. The passage cites multiple cases
supporting the notion that the interstate nature of predicate acts can
establish the necessary connection to interstate commerce. This aligns with

U.S. 669, 672, 115 S.Ct. 1732, 131 L.Ed.2d 714 (1995) (citations omitted).
The interstate commerce requirement is met if either the activity of the
enterprise or the predicate acts of racketeering affect interstate commerce.
Summary
A RICO enterprise can be any group with a common purpose, and it is
considered engaged in interstate commerce if its activities or the predicate
acts of racketeering affect interstate commerce. The passage cites United
States v. Robertson, which supports the notion that even minimal effects on
interstate commerce are sufficient. This aligns with the proposition that the
transfer of funds across state lines via PayPal for fraudulent purposes
satisfies the interstate commerce element of RICO.

Summary
The passage from the BCCI Holdings v. Khalil case provides a clear
explanation of what constitutes a RICO "enterprise" and how it can be
engaged in interstate commerce. It emphasizes that an enterprise can affect
interstate commerce either through its activities or through predicate acts
of racketeering. This aligns with the proposition that the transfer of funds
across state lines via PayPal and the subsequent use of those funds for
fraudulent purposes can demonstrate an effect on interstate commerce, thus
satisfying the RICO requirement.

Extract
Section 1962(b) provides that it is unlawful 'for any person through a
pattern of racketeering activity ... to acquire or maintain, directly or
indirectly, any interest in or control of any enterprise which is engaged in, or
the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce.' Section
1962(c) makes it unlawful 'for any person employed by or associated with
any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or
foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the
conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering
activity....' ... In addition, because many of the federal checks at issue were
knowingly stolen from out-of-state payees, and the substantial portions of
the fraudulently obtained funds appear to have been transferred out of
state, such conduct also constitutes interstate transport of stolen property
within the meaning of the RICO statute.
Summary
N example where the transfer of funds out of state and the involvement in
fraudulent activities were sufficient to satisfy the interstate commerce
requirement under RICO. This supports the proposition that the transfer of
funds across state lines via PayPal for fraudulent purposes can demonstrate
an effect on interstate commerce, thus satisfying the RICO element.

Extract
The offenses which underlie 'racketeering activity' are the predicate acts
necessary for a RICO violation. They are defined in 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1) as
acts 'indictable' or 'punishable' under various federal criminal statutes and
acts 'chargeable' under certain state criminal laws, including murder,
kidnapping, arson, robbery, bribery, extortion, dealing in narcotics,
securities fraud, mail fraud and wire fraud. ... A plaintiff seeking to bring a
civil RICO action must allege all of these following essential elements: ... (7)
the activities of which affect interstate commerce or foreign commerce.
Summary
For a RICO violation, the predicate acts must include offenses like wire
fraud, which is relevant to the transfer of funds via PayPal. Additionally, the
passage confirms that one of the essential elements of a RICO claim is that
the activities must affect interstate commerce. The transfer of funds across
state lines via PayPal and the subsequent use of those funds for fraudulent
purposes can be seen as affecting interstate commerce, thus satisfying this
element of RICO.

Summary
The passage from 18 U.S.C. § 1962 outlines that it is unlawful for any person
to engage in racketeering activities that affect interstate or foreign
commerce. The proposition involves the transfer of funds across state lines
via PayPal, which is an activity that affects interstate commerce. The use of
these funds for fraudulent purposes further supports the claim of
racketeering activity. The passage directly supports the proposition by
establishing the legal framework under which such activities are considered
unlawful.

Summary
The passage from 18 U.S.C. § 1343 outlines the federal crime of wire fraud,
which involves transmitting communications across state lines for the
purpose of executing a fraudulent scheme. This directly relates to the
proposition as it involves the transfer of funds across state lines via PayPal,
which is a form of wire communication. The passage supports the notion
that such activities can affect interstate commerce, which is a requirement
under RICO.

Extract
RICO's jurisdictional element only requires an effect on interstate
commerce. (101) Affecting interstate commerce implies a very minimal
nexus between the racketeering activity or enterprise and interstate
commerce. (102) ... Historically, the Government needed to provide evidence
sufficient to establish only a de minimis nexus between interstate commerce
and the defendant's enterprise or individual predicate acts. (168) ... Because
RICO is a general regulatory scheme that bears a substantial relation to
interstate commerce, the de minimis economic character of the individual
instances of racketeering or an enterprise's activities is of no consequence.
(173)
Summary
RICO's jurisdictional element requires only a minimal effect on interstate
commerce. The passage emphasizes that even a de minimis nexus is
sufficient to satisfy this requirement, which aligns with the proposition that
the transfer of funds across state lines via PayPal and their use in a
fraudulent scheme would meet the interstate commerce requirement under
RICO.

Even a de minimis impact on interstate commerce is sufficient to satisfy this
requirement. This aligns with the proposition that the transfer of funds
across state lines via PayPal, even if minimal, can demonstrate an effect on
interstate commerce, thus satisfying the RICO element.

Extract
For RICO to apply, the alleged racketeering activity must affect interstate
commerce. (124) Courts initially held that the enterprise itself, and not the
predicate acts, must affect interstate commerce. (125) However, many
courts now exercise RICO jurisdiction if the predicate acts have a de
minimis impact on interstate commerce, (126) demonstrated by 'proof of a
probable or potential impact.' (127) This element may be satisfied if the
enterprise's activities have an impact on interstate commerce, (128) which
includes activities that 'affect interstate commerce by impacting the
victim.' (129)... (126.) See United States v. Johnson, 440 F.3d 832, 841 (6th
Cir. 2006) (holding that '[o]nly a minimal impact on interstate commerce is
necessary to support a RICO conviction' and that 'the interstate nature of
the predicate acts themselves can establish the required connection
between the enterprise and the interstate commerce'); United States v.
Delgado, 401 F.3d 290, 297 (5th Cir. 2005) (finding that evidence of use of
interstate instrumentalities is sufficient to show the minimal nexus with
interstate commerce necessary for RICO)...
Summary
For RICO to apply, the activities must affect interstate commerce. The courts
have established that even a minimal impact on interstate commerce is
sufficient. The passage cites several cases where the use of interstate
instrumentalities, such as transferring funds across state lines, satisfies the
requirement for a minimal nexus with interstate commerce.

The alleged racketeering activity must affect interstate commerce.(163)
Courts initially held that the enterprise itself, and not the predicate acts,
must affect interstate commerce. (164) In contrast, many courts now
exercise RICO jurisdiction if the predicate acts have a de minimis impact on
interstate commerce,(165) demonstrated by 'proof of a probable or potential
impact.'(166) Moreover, the enterprise's activities may be held to impact
interstate commerce indirectly; that is, its activities 'may affect interstate
commerce by impacting the victim.'(167)
Summary
Even a de minimis impact on interstate commerce is sufficient for RICO
jurisdiction. This aligns with the proposition that the transfer of funds across
state lines via PayPal and their use in a fraudulent scheme can demonstrate
an effect on interstate commerce, thus satisfying the RICO requirement.

The racketeering activity must have some effect on interstate commerce.
(156) Courts initially held that the enterprise itself, and not the predicate
acts, must affect interstate commerce.(157) However, many courts now
exercise jurisdiction when the predicate acts form a nexus with interstate
commerce.(158) In R.A.G.S. Couture, Inc. v. Hyatt,(159) the Fifth Circuit
held that as long as interstate commerce is affected by either the enterprise
or its 'activities,' RICO's 'interstate commerce' requirement is satisfied.(160)
These 'activities' can even be the illegal predicate acts themselves.(161)
Summary
The requirement for RICO's interstate commerce element can be satisfied if
either the enterprise or its activities affect interstate commerce. The
passage specifically notes that the illegal predicate acts themselves can
form a nexus with interstate commerce, which aligns with the proposition
that the transfer of funds across state lines via PayPal and their use in a
fraudulent scheme demonstrate an effect on interstate commerce.

Extract
Arguments that RICO unconstitutionally intrudes upon state sovereignty in
violation of the Tenth Amendment have been summarily rejected. (225)
Because the Commerce Clause (226) is the source of Congress's authority to
enact RICO, it is well established that Congress may validly regulate
racketeering activity affecting interstate commerce. (227) The prosecution
must prove the element of 'enterprise' (228) in all RICO cases, (229) and the
defendant's association with an enterprise affecting interstate commerce
provides the RICO jurisdiction. (230) The government is not required to
prove that the predicate acts themselves effected interstate commerce, as
long as the racketeering activity itself effects interstate commerce. (231)...
(121.) See United States v. Nerone, 563 F.2d 836, 854 (7th Cir. 1977)
(requiring government to introduce evidence that the enterprise affects
interstate commerce in order to successfully prosecute a RICO claim). (122.)
See United States v. Feliciano, 223 F.3d 102, 117 (2d Cir. 2000) (holding
'effect on interstate or foreign commerce could have occurred in any way,
and it need only have been minimal'); United States v. Frega, 179 F.3d 793,
800 (9th Cir. 1999) (requiring individual predicate acts of racketeering only
have a de minimis impact on interstate commerce); United States v. Owens,
167 F.3d 739, 755 (1st Cir. 1999) (holding only a minimal effect on interstate
commerce is necessary)...
Summary
RICO's jurisdiction is established through the Commerce Clause, allowing
Congress to regulate activities affecting interstate commerce. The passage
emphasizes that even minimal effects on interstate commerce are sufficient
to satisfy RICO's requirements. This aligns with the proposition that the
transfer of funds across state lines via PayPal and their use in a fraudulent
scheme demonstrate an effect on interstate commerce, thus satisfying
RICO's jurisdictional element.

United States v. Fernandez, 388 F.3d 1199, 1217–18 (9th Cir. 2004) (holding
that predicate acts only need a de minimis effect to establish nexus to
interstate commerce); United States v. Johnson, 440 F.3d 832, 841 (6th Cir.
2006) (holding “[o]nly a minimal impact upon interstate commerce is
necessary to support a RICO conviction” and that “the interstate nature of

117–19 (2d Cir. 2000) (“[The] effect on interstate or foreign commerce could
have occurred in any way, and it need only have been minimal.”);
Summary
The courts have consistently held that only a minimal effect on interstate
commerce is necessary to satisfy the jurisdictional element of RICO. The use
of interstate instrumentalities, such as transferring funds across state lines
via PayPal, is sufficient to establish this minimal nexus. This supports the
proposition that the transfer of funds in this case affects interstate
commerce, satisfying the RICO requirement.

Extract
Alleged racketeering activity must impact interstate commerce to be
actionable under RICO.131 Courts exercise RICO jurisdiction when the
enterprise itself affects interstate commerce132 or when the predicate acts
have at least a de minimis impact on interstate commerce.133 The effect on
interstate commerce must be demonstrated by 'proof of a probable or
potential impact.'134 Effect on interstate commerce may also be established
by examining how the enterprise’s actions impacted the victim of the
predicate acts.135
Summary
The passage explains that for RICO to apply, the racketeering activity must
have an impact on interstate commerce. It further clarifies that even a
minimal or de minimis impact is sufficient to establish this requirement. The
passage also notes that the effect can be demonstrated by showing a
probable or potential impact on interstate commerce. This aligns with the
proposition that the transfer of funds across state lines via PayPal and their

Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy
The Brief - American Bar Association - 2024-01-01
Extract
A violation of § 1962(c), the section on which Sedima relies, requires (1)
conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity. The plaintiff must allege each of the elements to state a claim. They
are all equally essential components, and the complaint will fail if any one of
them is not adequately pleaded. In particular, RICO claims based on mail or
wire fraud must comport with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b)’s
requirement that allegations involving fraud be pleaded with particularity.
The practitioner through their pleadings must articulate with great care and
attention a viable racketeering claim. In addition, § 1962(a), (b), and (c) are
limited in scope to conduct involving enterprises engaged in or the activities
of which affect interstate commerce. It is the activities of the enterprise, not
each predicate act, that must affect interstate or foreign commerce. RICO
requires no more than a slight effect upon interstate commerce. Even a
minimal effect on interstate commerce satisfies this jurisdictional
requirement.
Summary
A RICO violation under § 1962(c) requires demonstrating that the
enterprise's activities affect interstate commerce. The passage emphasizes
that even a minimal effect on interstate commerce is sufficient to satisfy this
requirement. This aligns with the proposition that the transfer of funds
across state lines via PayPal and their use in a fraudulent scheme can
demonstrate the necessary effect on interstate commerce.
RICO: A Primer
Extract
Under Section 1962(a), it is violation to invest the proceeds of racketeering
activity in an enterprise that affects interstate commerce. To prove a
violation of Section 1962(a), a plaintiff must prove the following elements: *
Existence of an enterprise; * The enterprise engaged in, or its activities
affected, interstate or foreign commerce; ... Section 1962(c) ... Under
section 1962(c), it is a violation to conduct the affairs of an enterprise
affecting interstate or foreign commerce 'through' a pattern of racketeering
activity ... To prove a violation of Section 1962(c), a plaintiff must prove the
following elements: * Existence of an enterprise; * The enterprise engaged
in, or its activities affected, interstate or foreign commerce; ...

Summary
Elements required to establish a RICO violation, including the need for the
enterprise to engage in or affect interstate commerce. This directly supports
the proposition that the transfer of funds across state lines via PayPal and
their use in a fraudulent scheme can demonstrate an effect on interstate
commerce, satisfying the RICO requirement.
RICO: A Primer
Extract
To prove a violation of Section 1962(c), a plaintiff must prove the following
elements: * Existence of an enterprise; * The enterprise engaged in, or its
activities affected, interstate or foreign commerce; * The defendant was
employed by or was associated with the enterprise; * The defendant
conducted or participated, either directly or indirectly, in the conduct of the
affairs of the enterprise; and * The defendant participated in the affairs of
the enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of
unlawful debt.
Summary
Elements required to establish such a violation, including the effect on
interstate commerce, which is directly relevant to the proposition that the
transfer of funds across state lines via PayPal affects interstate commerce.
Defending Civil RICO Claims: A Defense Plan Should Be In Every Business's
Arsenal
Extract
Fifth, a RICO claim cannot exist without some nexus to interstate commerce.
If the alleged conduct does not affect interstate commerce, it must be
dismissed. While a company is unlikely to be involved in a dispute without a
relationship to commerce, this element of a RICO claim should nevertheless
be scrutinized as another fruitful avenue for early dismissal.
Summary
A RICO claim requires a nexus to interstate commerce. The passage
emphasizes that if the alleged conduct does not affect interstate commerce,
the claim must be dismissed. This supports the proposition that the transfer
of funds across state lines via PayPal, which is inherently an interstate
transaction, satisfies the interstate commerce requirement of a RICO claim.
