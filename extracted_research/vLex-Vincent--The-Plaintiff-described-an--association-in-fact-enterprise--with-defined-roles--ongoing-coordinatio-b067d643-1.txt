Question
The Plaintiff described an “association-in-fact enterprise” with defined roles,
ongoing coordination, and operational security measures, functioning over
an 18-month period. A RICO enterprise may be an “association-in-fact” that
is “a group of persons associated together for a common purpose of
engaging in a course of conduct.” (Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938, 946
(2009)). The judge’s order did not address the Plaintiff’s detailed allegations
regarding the structure and ongoing operations of the alleged enterprise,
including: - “The enterprise functioned as a continuing unit from December
2023 through May 2025, with consistent roles and coordinated actions
throughout this period.” (Complaint ¶ 91(iii)) - “The enterprise was
maintained through several key mechanisms: Continuous Communication…
Financial Support… Operational Security Measures… Geographic
Distribution…” (Complaint ¶ 92) By failing to address these allegations, the
judge did not properly consider whether the Plaintiff had plausibly alleged
the existence of an enterprise distinct from the racketeering acts, as
required by RICO. 
Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
The Plaintiff’s detailed allegations regarding the structure, roles, and
ongoing operations of the alleged association-in-fact enterprise, if true, are
sufficient under established RICO jurisprudence to plausibly allege the
existence of an enterprise distinct from the pattern of racketeering activity.
The judge’s failure to address these specific allegations means the order did
not properly consider whether the Plaintiff met the pleading requirements
for a RICO enterprise.
Summary
Under federal RICO law, an “association-in-fact enterprise” must possess
three structural features: a common purpose, relationships among those
associated, and sufficient longevity to pursue that purpose. The Plaintiff’s
complaint, describing an 18-month operation with defined roles, ongoing
coordination, and operational mechanisms, aligns with the Supreme Court’s
requirements for pleading such an enterprise.
The judge’s omission of any analysis of these detailed allegations is
inconsistent with controlling authority, which requires courts to assess
whether the Plaintiff has plausibly alleged an enterprise that is distinct from
the racketeering acts themselves. The Plaintiff’s factual assertions, if
credited, would satisfy the low threshold for pleading an association-in-fact
enterprise under RICO, and the court should have addressed them directly.

Background and Relevant Law
Statutory Framework
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), codified at
18 U.S.C. §§ 1961–1968, defines “enterprise” to include “any individual,
partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or
group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity” (18 U.S.C.
§ 1961(4)), as discussed in Wilhite v. Littlelight, CV 19-20-BLG-TJC (D. Mont.
Feb 03, 2023) and United States v. Kelly, 609 F.Supp.3d 85 (E.D. N.Y. 2022).
This definition is intentionally broad and encompasses both formal and
informal organizations, including groups of individuals associated in fact.
Supreme Court and Circuit Precedent
The Supreme Court in Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938 (2009) clarified
the requirements for an “association-in-fact enterprise.” The Court held that
such an enterprise must have at least three structural features: (1) a
purpose, (2) relationships among those associated with the enterprise, and
(3) longevity sufficient to permit these associates to pursue the enterprise’s
purpose. The Court emphasized that an association-in-fact enterprise need
not have a hierarchical structure, fixed roles, a name, regular meetings, or
other formal indicia of organization; rather, it must function as a continuing
unit with a common purpose.
This standard has been consistently applied by lower courts. For example,
the Third Circuit in Spirits v. Ragghianti, 23-2913 (3rd Cir. Jun 26, 2024)
reiterated that a RICO claim must plausibly allege the existence of an
enterprise with the structural attributes identified in Boyle: shared purpose,
relationships, and sufficient longevity. Similarly, the Second Circuit in United
States v. Gershman, 31 F.4th 80 (2nd Cir. 2022) and United States v. Pierce,
785 F.3d 832 (2nd Cir. 2015) confirmed that an association-in-fact enterprise
is simply a continuing unit that functions with a common purpose, without
the need for a rigid hierarchy.
The requirement that the enterprise be distinct from the pattern of
racketeering activity is also well established. The Supreme Court in United
States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576 (1981) (as cited in Boyle and numerous
lower court decisions) held that the enterprise is an entity separate and
apart from the pattern of activity in which it engages, and its existence must
be established independently.
Analysis
1. The Plaintiff’s Allegations and the Boyle Standard
The Plaintiff’s complaint alleges that the enterprise functioned as a
continuing unit from December 2023 through May 2025, with consistent
roles and coordinated actions, and was maintained through mechanisms
such as continuous communication, financial support, operational security,

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
and geographic distribution. These allegations directly address the three
structural features required by Boyle:
Purpose: The Plaintiff alleges a common purpose—presumably the
objective underlying the racketeering activity—which is sufficient under 
Boyle and its progeny (Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938 (2009); 
United States v. Kelly, 609 F.Supp.3d 85 (E.D. N.Y. 2022)).
Relationships: The complaint describes defined roles and ongoing
coordination, indicating relationships among those associated with the
enterprise (Wilhite v. Littlelight, CV 19-20-BLG-TJC (D. Mont. Feb 03,
2023); United States v. Chester, No. 13 CR 00774 (N.D. Ill. Aug 08,
2017)).
Longevity: The alleged 18-month period of operation, with consistent
activity and structure, satisfies the requirement of sufficient longevity
to pursue the enterprise’s purpose (Spirits v. Ragghianti, 23-2913 (3rd
Cir. Jun 26, 2024); Dynarex Corp. v. Farrah, 18 CV 7072 (VB) (S.D. N.Y.
May 28, 2019)).
The Supreme Court in Boyle specifically rejected the need for additional
structural features such as a hierarchical structure, fixed roles, or formal
indicia of organization (Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938 (2009); Nesbitt
v. Regas, No. 13 C 8245 (N.D. Ill. Mar 20, 2015)). The Plaintiff’s allegations,
which go beyond the minimum required by describing operational security
and coordination, are more than sufficient to meet the pleading standard.
2. Distinctness from the Pattern of Racketeering Activity
A critical element under RICO is that the enterprise must be distinct from
the pattern of racketeering activity (United States v. Bergrin, No. 10-2204
(3rd Cir. Apr 12, 2011); Chapter 4. Elements of Cause of Action). The
Plaintiff’s complaint alleges a structured, ongoing organization with
mechanisms for maintaining the enterprise, which is separate from the
specific racketeering acts. This distinction is essential and is supported by
both Supreme Court and circuit precedent (United States v. Turkette, 452
U.S. 576 (1981); Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938 (2009); Chambers v.
King Buick GMC, LLC, 43 F. Supp. 3d 575 (D. Md. 2014)).
Secondary materials reinforce this point, emphasizing that the existence of
the enterprise is a separate element from the pattern of racketeering
activity, and that the group must have a mechanism for directing its affairs
on an ongoing basis (Racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations.
(2011-03-22); RICO: A Primer (2022-01-31)).
3. The Low Threshold for Pleading an Association-in-Fact
Enterprise
Courts have recognized that the threshold for pleading an association-in-fact
enterprise is not high. As noted in Hemmerdinger Corp. v. Ruocco, 976
F.Supp.2d 401 (E.D. N.Y. 2013), Boyle establishes a low threshold for such
allegations. The Plaintiff’s detailed factual assertions regarding the
structure and operations of the enterprise, if taken as true at the pleading
stage, are sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss.

4. The Judge’s Failure to Address the Allegations
Given the controlling authority, the judge’s failure to address the Plaintiff’s
specific allegations regarding the structure and ongoing operations of the
alleged enterprise is a significant omission. Courts are required to assess
whether the Plaintiff has plausibly alleged the existence of an enterprise
with the requisite structural features, distinct from the racketeering acts
(Spirits v. Ragghianti, 23-2913 (3rd Cir. Jun 26, 2024); Wilhite v. Littlelight,
CV 19-20-BLG-TJC (D. Mont. Feb 03, 2023)). By not engaging with these
allegations, the judge did not properly apply the legal standard.
5. No Requirement for Formal Structure or Hierarchy
The Plaintiff’s allegations of defined roles, ongoing coordination, and
operational security measures are more than what is required under Boyle
and its progeny. Courts have repeatedly held that an association-in-fact
enterprise need not have a formal structure, hierarchy, or fixed roles (United
States v. Pierce, 785 F.3d 832 (2nd Cir. 2015); SAAP Energy v. Bell, CASE
NO. 1:12-CV-00098 (W.D. Ky. Aug 28, 2013); In re Insurance Brokerage
Antitrust Litig., 618 F.3d 300 (3rd Cir. 2010)). The Plaintiff’s description of
operational mechanisms and coordination only strengthens the plausibility
of the enterprise’s existence.
6. Distinctness and the “Enterprise” Element
The requirement that the enterprise be distinct from the racketeering
activity is not a mere formality. As explained in Delta Truck & Tractor, Inc. v.
J.I. Case Co., 855 F.2d 241 (5th Cir. 1988) and Racketeer influenced and
corrupt organizations. (2005-03-22), the enterprise must have an existence
separate and apart from the pattern of racketeering, be an ongoing
organization, and function as a continuing unit. The Plaintiff’s allegations of
continuous communication, financial support, and operational security
measures over an extended period are precisely the type of facts that courts
have found sufficient to establish this element.
7. Circuit Variations and Consistency
While some circuits have historically required more specific indicia of
structure, the Supreme Court in Boyle abrogated any requirement for a
hierarchical structure or fixed roles (Nesbitt v. Regas, No. 13 C 8245 (N.D.
Ill. Mar 20, 2015)). The Plaintiff’s allegations, which include both formal and
informal mechanisms for maintaining the enterprise, are consistent with the
current, controlling standard.
8. Negative Treatment of Beauford v. Helmsley
It should be noted that Beauford v. Helmsley, 843 F.2d 103 (2nd Cir. 1988)
was stated as vacated by Wilson v. Askew, 709 F.Supp. 146 (W.D. Ark. 1989).
However, the principles for defining an enterprise in Beauford are consistent
with those later adopted and clarified by the Supreme Court in Boyle and
are therefore still instructive, though not independently controlling.

Exceptions and Caveats
There may be rare cases where a plaintiff’s allegations, even if detailed, are
so conclusory or internally inconsistent that they fail to plausibly allege the
existence of an enterprise. However, where, as here, the Plaintiff has
provided specific factual allegations regarding the structure, roles, and
ongoing operations of the alleged enterprise, courts are generally required
to accept those allegations as true at the pleading stage and assess whether
they meet the Boyle standard.
Additionally, while the enterprise must be distinct from the pattern of
racketeering activity, the proof necessary to establish each element may
overlap, and the existence of the enterprise may be inferred from the way
the group operates (Chapter 4. Elements of Cause of Action; Racketeer
influenced and corrupt organizations. (2010-03-22)).
Conclusion
The Plaintiff’s detailed allegations regarding the structure, roles, and
ongoing operations of the alleged association-in-fact enterprise are
sufficient, if true, to plausibly allege the existence of a RICO enterprise
distinct from the racketeering acts. The judge’s failure to address these
allegations is inconsistent with controlling Supreme Court and circuit
authority, which require courts to assess whether the Plaintiff has met the
low threshold for pleading an association-in-fact enterprise. The Plaintiff’s
complaint, describing an 18-month operation with defined roles,
coordination, and operational mechanisms, aligns with the requirements set
forth in Boyle and its progeny, and should have been analyzed accordingly.

Relying largely on United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 583, 101 S.Ct.
2524, 69 L.Ed.2d 246, the District Court instructed the jury that to establish
a RICO association-in-fact “enterprise,” the Government must prove (1) an
ongoing organization with a framework, formal or informal, for carrying out
its objectives, and (2) that association members functioned as a continuing
unit to achieve a common purpose. The court also told the jury that an
association-in-fact's existence is often more readily proved by what it does
than by abstract analysis of its structure... From the terms of RICO, it is
apparent that an association-in-fact enterprise must have at least three
structural features: a purpose, relationships among those associated with
the enterprise, and longevity sufficient to permit these associates to pursue
the enterprise's purpose.

Summary
The passage from Boyle v. United States clarifies that a RICO association-in-
fact enterprise does not need a formal structure but must have a purpose,
relationships among its members, and sufficient longevity to achieve its
purpose. The Plaintiff's allegations of an enterprise with defined roles,
ongoing coordination, and operational security measures align with these
requirements. The passage supports the proposition that the Plaintiff's
description of the enterprise meets the criteria for an association-in-fact
under RICO.

The existence of an enterprise is a distinct statutory element from the
pattern and must be established in its own right. Boyle v. United States, ---
U.S. ----, 129 S.Ct. 2237, 2245, 173 L.Ed.2d 1265 (2009). The RICO statute
defines an enterprise as “any individual, partnership, corporation,
association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals
associated in fact although not a legal entity.” 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4) (emphasis
added). ... As the Boyle Court succinctly stated, “ ‘an association-in-fact
enterprise is a group of persons associated together for a common purpose
of engaging in a course of conduct.’ ” Boyle, 129 S.Ct. at 2244 (quoting
United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 583, 101 S.Ct. 2524, 69 L.Ed.2d 246

must have a structure. Id. “From the terms of RICO, it is apparent that an
association-in-fact enterprise must have at least three structural features: a

Summary
The passage emphasizes that an "association-in-fact enterprise" under RICO
must have a structure, which includes a purpose, relationships among those
associated, and longevity. This aligns with the Plaintiff's allegations of a
structured enterprise with defined roles and ongoing operations. The
passage supports the proposition that the judge should have considered
whether the Plaintiff's detailed allegations met the RICO requirements for
an enterprise distinct from the pattern of racketeering acts.

The Supreme Court held in United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 583
(1981)—and reaffirmed in Boyle v. United States, 129 S. Ct. 2237, 2244
(2009)—that such an '[association-in-fact] enterprise is an entity, for present
purposes a group of persons associated together for a common purpose of
engaging in a course of conduct,' and it 'is proved by evidence of an ongoing
organization, formal or informal, and by evidence that the various associates
function as a continuing unit.. .. separate and apart from the pattern of
activity in which it engages.' In Boyle, the Court added that 'an association-
in-fact enterprise must have at least three structural features: a purpose,
relationships among those associated with the enterprise, and longevity
sufficient to permit these associates to pursue the enterprise's purpose.' 129
S. Ct. at 2244.
Summary
The passage references the Supreme Court's definition of an "association-in-
fact" enterprise, which includes the need for a common purpose, ongoing
organization, and functioning as a continuing unit. These elements align
with the Plaintiff's allegations of a structured and coordinated enterprise.
The passage also emphasizes that an enterprise must be distinct from the
pattern of racketeering activity, which supports the Plaintiff's argument that
the judge failed to consider the distinct nature of the alleged enterprise.

An association-in-fact enterprise must have an ascertainable structure with
'three structural features: a purpose, relationships among those associated
with the enterprise, and longevity sufficient to permit these associates to
pursue the enterprise's purpose.' Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938, 946
(2009). The Supreme Court in Boyle rejected inferring additional structural
requirements, such as a 'hierarchical structure,' 'fixed roles' for its
members, 'name, regular meetings, dues, established rules and regulations,
disciplinary procedures, or induction or initiation ceremonies.' Id. at 948. In
doing so, the Supreme Court abrogated a body of Seventh Circuit case law
that required RICO enterprises to have a more discernable structure
through hierarchical organization or leadership.
Summary
The Supreme Court in Boyle v. United States clarified the requirements for
an "association-in-fact" enterprise under RICO. The Court emphasized that
such an enterprise must have a purpose, relationships among its members,
and sufficient longevity to pursue its purpose. The Court also rejected the
need for additional structural features like a hierarchical structure or fixed
roles. This supports the proposition that the Plaintiff's allegations of a
structured and ongoing enterprise over an 18-month period could meet the
requirements for an "association-in-fact" enterprise under RICO.

The Supreme Court has defined an enterprise associated in fact as 'simply a
continuing unit that functions with a common purpose.' Boyle v. United
States, 556 U.S. 938, 948 (2009). The absence of the structural attributes of
a more formal enterprise is not material. United States v. Olson, 450 F.3d
655, 664 (7th Cir. 2006) ('We have held that in informal organizations such
as criminal groups, there 'must be some structure, to distinguish an
enterprise from a mere conspiracy, but there need not be much.'). An
enterprise includes 'any union or group of individuals associated in fact,'
which is to say, 'associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a
course of conduct.' Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938, 944 (2009) (quoting

Summary
The passage from United States v. Chester provides a detailed explanation of
what constitutes an "association-in-fact" enterprise under RICO, as defined
by the Supreme Court in Boyle v. United States. It emphasizes that such an
enterprise is a continuing unit with a common purpose, and it does not
require formal structural attributes. The passage also highlights the
necessity of having a purpose, relationships, and longevity to qualify as an
enterprise. This directly supports the proposition that the Plaintiff's
allegations of a structured and ongoing enterprise should have been
considered by the judge.

U.S. District Court — Eastern District of New York
Extract
The RICO statute makes it unlawful for 'any person employed by or
associated with any enterprise' whose activities affect interstate or foreign
commerce 'to conduct or participate ... in the conduct of such enterprise's
affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.' 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). The
statute further defines 'enterprise' to include 'any ... group of individuals
associated in fact although not a legal entity.' 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4). As the
Supreme Court has observed, the 'enumeration of included enterprises is
obviously broad,' and 'the term ‘any’ ensures that the definition has a wide
reach.' Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938, 944, 129 S.Ct. 2237, 173 L.Ed.

structural features: a purpose, relationships among those associated with
the enterprise, and longevity sufficient to permit these associates to pursue
the enterprise's purpose.' Boyle, 556 U.S. at 946, 129 S.Ct. 2237. An
association-in-fact enterprise is 'a group of persons associated together for a

purpose.' (quoting Boyle, 556 U.S. at 948, 129 S.Ct. 2237)).
Summary
Broad definition of a RICO enterprise, emphasizing that an "association-in-
fact" enterprise must have a purpose, relationships among those associated,
and longevity. This aligns with the Plaintiff's allegations of a structured and
ongoing enterprise. The passage supports the proposition by highlighting
that the definition of an enterprise under RICO is broad and includes groups
with a common purpose, which the Plaintiff has alleged.

The concept of continuity as a means of controlling the scope of RICO has
also been incorporated into the enterprise element of section 1962. An
enterprise 'includes any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or
other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals associated in fact
although not a legal entity.' 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1961(4). In United States v.
Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 583, 101 S.Ct. 2524, 2528-29, 69 L.Ed.2d 246
(1981), the Supreme Court stressed that continuity is a necessary attribute

=== PAGE 11 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
of an association-in-fact enterprise. We have incorporated this notion of
continuity into our definition of such enterprises. An association-in-fact
enterprise (1) must have an existence separate and apart from the pattern of
racketeering, (2) must be an ongoing organization and (3) its members must
function as a continuing unit as shown by a hierarchical or consensual
decision making structure.
Summary
The concept of continuity is essential for defining an association-in-fact
enterprise under RICO. The passage outlines that such an enterprise must
have an existence separate from the racketeering acts, be an ongoing
organization, and function as a continuing unit. These elements align with
the Plaintiff's allegations of a structured and ongoing enterprise, which the
judge allegedly failed to consider.

But that breadth is not without limit. '[A] RICO claim must plead facts
plausibly implying the existence of an enterprise with the structural
attributes identified in Boyle: a shared 'purpose, relationships among those

v. United States, 556 U.S. 938, 946 (2009)).
Summary
For a RICO claim to be valid, it must include allegations that plausibly imply
the existence of an enterprise with specific structural attributes: a shared
purpose, relationships among those associated with the enterprise, and
sufficient longevity to pursue the enterprise's purpose. This aligns with the
Plaintiff's allegations of an association-in-fact enterprise with defined roles,
ongoing coordination, and operational security measures over an 18-month
period. The passage supports the proposition by emphasizing the need for
structural attributes in a RICO enterprise, which the Plaintiff has alleged but
the judge did not address.

=== PAGE 12 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
Central to the district court's grant of summary judgment was its conclusion
that Whelan failed to demonstrate an enterprise. An enterprise is a group of
persons or entities associating together for the common purpose of
engaging in a course of conduct. United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576,
583, 101 S.Ct. 2524, 2528, 69 L.Ed.2d 246 (1981). The enterprise may be a
legal entity or 'any union or group of individuals associated in fact although
not a legal entity.' 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4) (emphasis added). The plaintiff
alleging an association-in-fact enterprise must adduce evidence
demonstrating '`an ongoing organization, formal or informal, and ...
evidence that the various associates function as a continuing unit'.
Summary
The definition of an "association-in-fact enterprise" under RICO requires
evidence of an ongoing organization, whether formal or informal, and that
the associates function as a continuing unit. This aligns with the Plaintiff's
allegations of a structured and ongoing enterprise with defined roles and
coordination over an 18-month period. The passage supports the proposition
by emphasizing the need for evidence of continuity and organization, which
the Plaintiff has alleged but the judge did not address.
Beauford v. Helmsley, 843 F.2d 103 (2nd Cir. 1988)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Second Circuit
Extract
If all we had then were Ianniello, this case would be easy; surely here an
enterprise is alleged--an enterprise which meets the requirements of 18
U.S.C. Sec. 1961(4), defining an enterprise as 'any individual, partnership,
corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of
individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.' The allegations
also satisfy the standards of United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 585-87,
101 S.Ct. 2524, 2529-31, 69 L.Ed.2d 246 (1981), which held that the
definition of enterprise encompasses both legitimate and illegitimate
endeavors, that an enterprise need not be involved in racketeering, and that
there need be no relationship between the enterprise and the racketeering
activity.
Summary
The definition of an "enterprise" under RICO is broad and includes both
legitimate and illegitimate endeavors. The passage references the standards
set by United States v. Turkette, which supports the idea that an enterprise
can exist independently of the racketeering activity. This aligns with the
proposition that the Plaintiff's allegations of an "association-in-fact

enterprise" with ongoing operations and structure should be considered as
potentially constituting a RICO enterprise.
Rao v. Bp Products North America, Inc., 589 F.3d 389 (7th Cir. 2009)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Seventh Circuit
Extract
The Supreme Court held in Boyle that an association-in-fact enterprise
under RICO must have a 'structure,' although the jury need not receive an
instruction in these terms. Boyle v. United States, ___ U.S. ___, 129 S.Ct.
2237, 2241, 173 L.Ed.2d 1265 (2009). The Court wrote that an association-
in-fact enterprise must have 'at least three structural features: a purpose,
relationships among those associated with the enterprise, and longevity
sufficient to permit these associates to pursue the enterprise's purpose.' Id.
at 2244. However, it clarified that RICO enterprises are not limited to
'business-like entities' and that they need not have a hierarchical structure
or a 'chain of command.'
Summary
The Supreme Court in Boyle clarified that an association-in-fact enterprise
under RICO must have a structure with at least three features: a purpose,
relationships among those associated, and longevity. This supports the
proposition that the Plaintiff's allegations of a structured, ongoing enterprise
with defined roles and coordination over an 18-month period could meet the
structural requirements for a RICO enterprise. The passage also emphasizes
that such enterprises do not need to be business-like or have a hierarchical
structure, aligning with the Plaintiff's description of the enterprise.

576, 583, 101 S.Ct. 2524, 2528, 69 L.Ed.2d 246 (1981). This circuit requires
that, under section 1962(c), the enterprise be a continuing operation and
that the acts be related to the common purpose.

The definition of a RICO enterprise includes a group of persons associated
for a common purpose, which must be demonstrated by evidence of an
ongoing organization and functioning as a continuing unit. This aligns with

The 'enterprise' element 'includes any individual, partnership, corporation,

associated in fact although not a legal entity.' 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4). The
Supreme Court has reiterated the broad scope of a RICO enterprise. See
Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938, 944 (2009) ('This enumeration of
included enterprises is obviously broad. .. .'). Nonetheless, at a minimum—
given that Plaintiffs do not discuss a partnership, corporation, or formal

Summary
The Supreme Court in Boyle v. United States has defined an "association-in-
fact enterprise" as requiring a purpose, relationships among those
associated, and longevity. This aligns with the Plaintiff's allegations of a

passage supports the proposition by emphasizing the need for a structured
enterprise distinct from the racketeering acts, which the Plaintiff has
alleged but the judge did not address.

RICO defines 'enterprise' to include 'any individual, partnership,
corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of
individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.' 18 U.S.C.A. §
1961(4). If the alleged enterprise is an association-in-fact, the plaintiff must
show evidence of an ongoing organization, formal or informal, and by
evidence that the various associates in the enterprise function as a
continuing unit with a common purpose. Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S.
938, 944-45 (2009). The Fifth Circuit also requires a plaintiff establish the
association-in-fact enterprise (1) has an existence separate and apart from
the pattern of racketeering, (2) is an ongoing organization and (3) has
members that function as a continuing unit as shown by a hierarchical or
consensual decision making structure.
Summary
Requirements for establishing an "association-in-fact" enterprise under
RICO, as defined by 18 U.S.C.A. § 1961(4) and interpreted in Boyle v. United
States. It emphasizes the need for an ongoing organization with a common

Under RICO, an enterprise is defined to include “any individual, partnership,
corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of
individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.” 18 U.S.C. §
1961(4). The existence of an enterprise is a separate element which must be
established by Wilhite. U.S. v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 583 (1981). An
enterprise “is not the ‘pattern of racketeering activity'; it is an entity
separate and apart from the pattern of activity in which it engages. Id. It “is
proved by evidence of an ongoing organization, formal or informal, and by
evidence that various associations function as a continuing unit.” Id. ... “[A]n
association-in-fact enterprise is ‘a group of persons associated together for a
common purpose of engaging in a course of conduct.'” Boyle v. United
States, 556 U.S. 938, 946 (2009) (quoting Turkette, 452 U.S. at 583). Three
structural features are required for an association-in-fact enterprise: “a

Summary
Requirements for establishing an "association-in-fact" enterprise under
RICO, as defined by 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4) and interpreted by the U.S. Supreme
Court in cases like Turkette and Boyle. It emphasizes that an enterprise
must be distinct from the pattern of racketeering activity and must have a
purpose, relationships, and longevity. This supports the proposition that the
Plaintiff's allegations regarding the structure and operations of the

associated in fact although not a legal entity. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4). The Fifth
Circuit has interpreted this to mean 'an ongoing organization, formal or
informal' along with evidence of associates functioning as a 'continuing
unit.' ... The enterprise is not a pattern of racketeering activity, but must
exist separate and apart from the pattern of racketeering activity in which it
engages. Whelan v. Winchester Production Co., 319 F.3d 225, 229 (5th Cir.

Summary
A RICO enterprise can be an "association-in-fact" and does not require a
formal structure, as long as it functions as a "continuing unit" and exists
separately from the pattern of racketeering activity. This supports the
proposition that the Plaintiff's allegations of an "association-in-fact
enterprise" with defined roles and ongoing coordination could meet the
requirements for a RICO enterprise, as the Plaintiff described a structured
and ongoing operation.
SAAP Energy v. Bell, CASE NO. 1:12-CV-00098 (W.D. Ky. Aug 28, 2013)
U.S. District Court — Western District of Kentucky
Extract
A RICO enterprise 'includes any individual, partnership, corporation,
association, or other legal entity, and any union of individuals associated in
fact although not a legal entity.' 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4). The RICO concept of an
enterprise is 'obviously broad, encompassing 'any... group of individuals
associated in fact.'' Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938, 944 (2009) (quoting
18 U.S.C. § 1961(4)). 'An enterprise... 'is proven by evidence of an ongoing
organization, formal or informal, and by evidence that the various associates
function as a continuing unit.' Id. at 945 (quoting United States v. Turkette,
452 U.S. 576, 583 (1981)). To be an enterprise, the association-in-fact must
have a structure. Id. The structure of an enterprise 'must have at least
three... features: a purpose, relationships among those associated with the
enterprise, and longevity sufficient to permit these associates to pursue the
enterprise's purpose.' Id. at 946. But 'this organizational structure need not
be hierarchical, can make decisions on an ad hoc basis, and does not require
the members to have fixed roles.' Ouwinga, 694 F.3d at 794. The plaintiff
must simply show 'a continuing unit that functions with a common purpose.'
Boyle, 556 U.S. at 948.
Summary
Broad definition of a RICO enterprise, emphasizing that it can be an
association-in-fact with a structure that includes a purpose, relationships,
and longevity. The passage also clarifies that the structure need not be
hierarchical or have fixed roles, aligning with the Plaintiff's description of
the enterprise in the proposition. The passage supports the idea that the

Aragon v. Che Ku, 277 F.Supp.3d 1055 (D. Minn. 2017)
U.S. District Court — District of Minnesota
Extract
When a plaintiff alleges that the defendants collectively are members of an
association-in-fact enterprise, the enterprise and the defendants are not
impermissibly identical. Id. For these reasons, so long as Plaintiffs have
adequately alleged an association-in-fact enterprise, the fact that
Defendants are members of that enterprise will not warrant dismissal
because a 'collective entity is something more than the members of which it
is comprised.' Id. '[A]n association-in-fact enterprise must have at least three
structural features: a purpose, relationships among those associated with
the enterprise, and longevity sufficient to permit these associates to pursue
the enterprise's purpose.' Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938, 946, 129
S.Ct. 2237, 173 L.Ed.2d 1265 (2009). Although an association-in-fact need
not have any particular indicia of organization such as a hierarchical
structure, a chain of command, a name, regular meetings, dues, or
established rules and regulations, it must have a discrete existence and
structure uniting its members in a cognizable group. Id. at 948–49, 129 S.Ct.
2237.
Summary
Requirements for an "association-in-fact enterprise" under RICO,
emphasizing that such an enterprise must have a purpose, relationships
among its members, and sufficient longevity. The Plaintiff's allegations in the
proposition align with these requirements, as they describe a structured and
ongoing enterprise with defined roles and coordination over a specified
period. The passage supports the argument that the Plaintiff's allegations, if
true, could establish the existence of an association-in-fact enterprise under
RICO.

U.S. Court of Appeals — Seventh Circuit
Extract
The RICO statute defines “enterprise” as including “any individual,
partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or
group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.” 18 U.S.C.
§ 1961(4) (emphasis added). The Supreme Court reads this definition quite
broadly. See Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938, 944–45, 129 S.Ct. 2237,
173 L.Ed.2d 1265 (2009). In Boyle the Court held that an “association-in-fact
enterprise” has just three elements: “a purpose,” “relationships among those
associated with the enterprise,” and “longevity sufficient to permit these
associates to pursue the enterprise's purpose.”
Summary
The RICO statute's definition of an "enterprise" includes "association-in-fact"
entities, which are broadly interpreted by the Supreme Court. The passage
from Boyle v. United States outlines the three elements necessary for such
an enterprise: a purpose, relationships among associates, and longevity. This
aligns with the Plaintiff's allegations of a structured and ongoing enterprise
with defined roles and coordination over an 18-month period, which the

First, as a matter of law, the requirements for proving a racketeering
enterprise are not so rigid as Meregildo contends. As the Supreme Court
noted in Boyle v. United States, 'an association-in-fact enterprise is simply a
continuing unit that functions with a common purpose. Such a group need

Summary
The passage from United States v. Pierce references the Supreme Court's
decision in Boyle v. United States, which clarifies that an association-in-fact
enterprise under RICO does not require a hierarchical structure or chain of
command. This supports the proposition that the Plaintiff's description of an
enterprise with defined roles and ongoing coordination over an 18-month
period could meet the criteria for a RICO enterprise, even if it lacks a rigid
hierarchy. The passage emphasizes the flexibility in defining a RICO
enterprise, aligning with the Plaintiff's allegations of a structured and
coordinated enterprise.

The statute defines an enterprise as 'any individual, partnership,
corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of
individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.' 18 U.S.C. §
1961(4). The existence of an enterprise 'is proved by evidence of an ongoing
organization, formal or informal, and by evidence that the various associates
function as a continuing unit.' United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 583,
101 S.Ct. 2524, 69 L.Ed.2d 246 (1981). The 'central element of an enterprise
is structure.' Neapolitan, 791 F.2d at 500. We have held that in informal
organizations such as criminal groups, there 'must be some structure, to
distinguish an enterprise from a mere conspiracy, but there need not be
much.'
Summary
The definition of a RICO enterprise includes both formal and informal
organizations, and it requires evidence of an ongoing organization where
associates function as a continuing unit. The central element of an
enterprise is its structure, which distinguishes it from a mere conspiracy.
This supports the proposition that the Plaintiff's allegations of an

three structural features: a purpose, relationships among those associated
with the enterprise, and longevity sufficient to permit these associates to
pursue the enterprise's purpose.' Boyle, 556 U.S. at 946, 129 S.Ct. 2237. Or
to put it plainly, an association-in-fact enterprise is 'simply a continuing unit
that functions with a common purpose.' Id. at 948, 129 S.Ct. 2237.
Summary
An "association-in-fact" enterprise under RICO is broadly defined and
includes any group of individuals associated in fact, even if not a legal entity.
The passage emphasizes the structural features required for such an
enterprise: a purpose, relationships among those associated, and longevity.
This aligns with the Plaintiff's allegations of a structured and ongoing
enterprise with defined roles and coordination, supporting the proposition
that the judge should have considered these allegations in determining the
existence of a RICO enterprise.
In re Insurance Brokerage Antitrust Litig., 618 F.3d 300 (3rd Cir. 2010)

In short, Boyle holds that the RICO statute defines an “enterprise” broadly,
such that the “enterprise” element of a § 1962(c) claim can be satisfied by
showing a “structure,” that is, a common “purpose, relationships among
those associated with the enterprise, and longevity sufficient to permit these
associates to pursue the enterprise's purpose.” Id. at 2244; see id. at 2245
(“[A]n association-in-fact enterprise is simply a continuing unity that

enterprise need have no formal hierarchy or means for decision-making, and
no purpose or economic significance beyond or independent of the group's
pattern of racketeering activity.”

An association-in-fact enterprise does not require a formal hierarchy or

Furthermore, RICO enterprises could be proven by simply adducing
evidence that demonstrates a formal or informal association that is ongoing,
along with evidence that those participating in the organization operate as a
'continuing unit.' (141) ... The majority of federal circuit courts have held
that an association-in-fact enterprise must have 'some sort of structure [to
make] decisions, whether it be hierarchical or consensual,' and that '[t]here
must be some mechanism for controlling and directing the affairs of the
group on an ongoing rather than ad hoc basis.' (154) ... Instead, the Court
ruled that the structure required of an enterprise must include 'a purpose,
relationship among those associated with the enterprise, and longevity
sufficient to permit these associates to pursue the enterprise's
purpose.' (166)
Summary
The definition of a RICO enterprise includes both formal and informal
associations that operate as a continuing unit. The passage highlights that
an enterprise must have a structure for decision-making and control, which
aligns with the Plaintiff's allegations of defined roles and ongoing
coordination. The Supreme Court's ruling in Boyle v. United States further
supports the notion that an enterprise must have a purpose, relationships
among associates, and sufficient longevity, which the Plaintiff has alleged.

For RICO purposes, an enterprise must exist independently from the
racketeering activity in which it engages, its constituents must have a
common or shared purpose, and it must have some continuity of structure or
personnel. To constitute an enterprise, a group must have a mechanism for
directing the affairs of the group on an ongoing, rather than an ad hoc,
basis. ... Informal relationships among entities may suffice to create an
'associated-in-fact' enterprises. ... In order to be an association-in-fact, the
grouping must have a shared purpose, continuity, and unity. ... Recently, in
Boyle v. United States, the Supreme Court clarified that RICO association-in-
fact enterprises need not have 'an ascertainable structure beyond that
inherent in the pattern of racketeering activity.' ... The Court noted an
enterprise need only have the structural features of: 'a purpose,

Summary
Requirements for a RICO enterprise, emphasizing that it must exist
independently from the racketeering activity, have a shared purpose,
continuity, and unity. The Supreme Court's decision in Boyle v. United States
is particularly relevant, as it clarifies that an association-in-fact enterprise
does not need an ascertainable structure beyond the pattern of racketeering

enterprise exhibit three characteristics: &#34;(1) a common or shared
purpose; (2) some continuity of structure and personnel; and (3) an
ascertainable structure distinct from that inherent in a pattern of

Requirements for establishing a RICO enterprise, emphasizing the need for
a common purpose, continuity of structure and personnel, and an
ascertainable structure distinct from racketeering activities. It also
highlights that evidence of an ongoing organization and associates
functioning as a continuing unit is crucial. These elements align with the

entities, including a group of corporations or partnerships, can constitute
'associated-in-fact' enterprises. (87) In order to be an association-in-fact, the
association must have a shared purpose, continuity, unity, an identifiable
structure, (88) and some goals separate from the predicate acts themselves.
(89)... The existence of racketeering activity and enterprise are distinct
elements of a RICO charge, (100) but the proof necessary to establish either
can coincide. (101)... The Turkette Court stated: [w]hile the proof used to
establish these separate elements may in particular cases coalesce, proof of
one does not necessarily establish the other. The 'enterprise' is not the
'pattern of racketeering activity'; it is an entity separate and apart from the
pattern of activity in which it engages. The existence of an enterprise at all
times remains a separate element which must be proved by the Government.

Summary
The passage explains that a RICO enterprise can be an association-in-fact,
which does not require a formal relationship but must have a shared
purpose, continuity, unity, and an identifiable structure. It also emphasizes
that the existence of an enterprise is distinct from the pattern of
racketeering activity, which aligns with the Plaintiff's argument that the
judge failed to consider the distinct structure and operations of the alleged
enterprise.

For RICO purposes, an enterprise must exist independently from the
racketeering activity in which it engages, its constituents must have a
common or shared purpose, and it must have some continuity of structure or
personnel. To constitute an enterprise, a group must have a mechanism for
directing the affairs of the group on an ongoing, rather than ad hoc, basis. ...
Recently, in Boyle v. United States, the Supreme Court clarified that RICO
association-in-fact enterprises need not have 'an ascertainable structure
beyond that inherent in the pattern of racketeering activity.' ... The Court
noted that an enterprise need only have the following structural features: 'a
purpose, relationships among those associated with the enterprise, and
longevity sufficient to permit these associates to pursue the enterprise's
purpose.'
Summary
Requirements for a RICO enterprise, emphasizing that it must exist
independently from the racketeering activity, have a common purpose, and
continuity of structure or personnel. The Supreme Court's decision in Boyle
v. United States clarified that an association-in-fact enterprise does not need
an ascertainable structure beyond the pattern of racketeering activity, but it
must have a purpose, relationships, and longevity. This supports the
proposition that the Plaintiff's allegations of an association-in-fact enterprise
with defined roles and ongoing coordination over an 18-month period could
meet the RICO enterprise criteria.

Summary
Requirements for a RICO enterprise, emphasizing that it must exist
independently from the racketeering activity, have a common purpose,
continuity, and an identifiable structure. These elements align with the
Plaintiff's allegations of an association-in-fact enterprise with defined roles,
ongoing coordination, and operational security measures. The passage
supports the proposition that the Plaintiff's detailed allegations should have
been considered to determine if an enterprise distinct from the racketeering
acts was plausibly alleged.

‘beyond that inherent in the pattern of racketeering activity’ in which its
members engage?” Boyle, 566 U.S. at 945. Boyle answered this in the
affirmative, but only in the weak sense “that the existence of an enterprise is
a separate element that must be proved.”
Summary
The passage from the guide explains the requirements for an "association-in-
fact" enterprise under RICO, as clarified by the Supreme Court in Boyle v.
United States. It specifies that such an enterprise must have a purpose,
relationships among associates, and sufficient longevity. Additionally, it
emphasizes that the enterprise must be distinct from the pattern of
racketeering activity. These elements align with the Plaintiff's allegations of
a structured and ongoing enterprise, which the judge allegedly failed to
address.

The RICO enterprise must have a continuous structure and purpose
independent from the racketeering activity in which it engages, and its
alleged confederates must work with a common purpose or towards a
shared goal. The RICO enterprise must also have a mechanism for directing
its affairs on an ongoing, rather than ad hoc, basis. Federal courts have
discretion in developing the enterprise prong of RICO, and as such have
recognized several enterprise categories beyond those explicitly mentioned
in the statute. ... structure throughout the period described ... A RICO
enterprise must have ‘an ongoing structure of persons associated through
time, joined in purpose, and organized in a manner amenable to hierarchical
or consensual decision making’.. .. Moreover, because a RICO enterprise is
more than a group of people who get together to commit a pattern of
racketeering activity, there must be an organization with a structure and
goals separate from the predicate acts themselves.
Summary
A RICO enterprise must have a continuous structure and purpose
independent from the racketeering activity, with a mechanism for directing
its affairs on an ongoing basis. The passage also emphasizes the need for an
organization with a structure and goals separate from the predicate acts
themselves. This aligns with the Plaintiff's allegations of an association-in-
fact enterprise with defined roles, ongoing coordination, and operational
security measures.

1961(4) defines “enterprise” as “any individual, partnership, corporation,
association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals
associated in fact although not a legal entity.” Section 1962(c) requires that
the “person” who violates this section must be distinct from the “enterprise”
whose affairs that person is allegedly conducting or participating in. It is

because only the person and not the enterprise can be liable under §
1962(c). The person and enterprise must be separate entities. The violator of
§ 1962(c) who commits the pattern of predicate racketeering acts must be
distinct from the enterprise of predicate racketeering acts whose affairs are
thereby conducted. Therefore, the unlawful enterprise itself cannot also be
the person the plaintiff charges with conducting it. However, the Supreme
Court unanimously decided to narrow, but not eliminate, the concept that

circuits that an associated-in-fact enterprise must have an ascertainable
structure; the Supreme Court rejected the argument that a structure must
bear a resemblance to business-like entities).
Summary
The definition of an "enterprise" under RICO includes "any union or group of
individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity." This supports the
proposition that an "association-in-fact enterprise" can exist with defined
roles and ongoing coordination. The passage also references Boyle v. United
States, which clarifies that an associated-in-fact enterprise must have an
ascertainable structure, supporting the Plaintiff's allegations of a structured
and ongoing enterprise.
RICO: A Primer
Extract
A RICO enterprise includes 'any individual, partnership, corporation,
association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals
associated in fact although not a legal entity.' Courts have interpreted
'enterprise' broadly, and the definition captures both legitimate and
illegitimate enterprises. The statutory list is not exhaustive but merely
illustrative.
Summary
The definition of a RICO enterprise is broad and includes any group of
individuals associated in fact, even if not a legal entity. This supports the
proposition that the Plaintiff's description of an "association-in-fact
enterprise" with defined roles and ongoing coordination fits within the broad
interpretation of a RICO enterprise. The passage also indicates that the
statutory list of what constitutes an enterprise is illustrative, not exhaustive,
which aligns with the Plaintiff's detailed allegations of the enterprise's
structure and operations.
RICO: A Primer

=== PAGE 30 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
A plaintiff is required to demonstrate that the defendant conducted the
affairs of an enterprise though a pattern of racketeering activity. The person
and the enterprise generally must be distinct; but, of course, a Rico person
can be a part of an enterprise. ... The racketeering acts need not be similar
or directly related to each other; rather, it is sufficient that the racketeering
acts are related in some way to the affairs of the charged enterprise,
including, for example, that: the racketeering acts furthered the goals of or
benefitted the enterprise, the enterprise or the defendant's role in the
enterprise enabled the defendant to commit, or facilitated the commission
of, the racketeering acts, the racketeering acts were committed at the
behest of, or on behalf of, the enterprise, or the racketeering acts had the
same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims or methods of
commission. The continuity requirement is likewise satisfied where the
predicates are a regular way of conducting the defendant's ongoing
legitimate business (in the sense that it is not a business that exists for
criminal purposes), or of conducting or participating in an ongoing and
legitimate RICO 'enterprise.'
Summary
A RICO enterprise can be an association-in-fact, which aligns with the
Plaintiff's description of a structured and coordinated enterprise. The
passage explains that the racketeering acts need not be directly related but
must be connected to the enterprise's affairs, which supports the Plaintiff's
claim of a coordinated enterprise with defined roles and ongoing operations.
The continuity requirement is also addressed, which is relevant to the
Plaintiff's allegation of an 18-month period of operation.
