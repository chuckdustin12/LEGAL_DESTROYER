Statement of the Case Nature of Underlying Proceeding: This original
proceeding arises from a divorce action, No. 322-744263-23, pending in the
322nd District Court of Tarrant County, Texas. The Relator initiated recusal
proceedings under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a, which remain
pending. The issues presented concern the improper handling of those
recusal procedures. Respondent Judge: The Respondent Judge, Honorable
David L. Evans, is the presiding Regional Judge of the 8 th Administrative
Judicial Region of Texas. Respondent’s Challenged Actions: The Respondent
erred when he overruled the Relator's objection requesting that the
mandatory procedures set forth in Rule 18a of the Texas Rules of Civil
Procedure be followed. Further, permitting a judge to file an order of
referral regarding a recusal motion where he was not named introduces
confusion and undermines the purpose of the rule, causes further delays,
and leaves the Relator without an adequate appellate remedy. 7 Statement
of Jurisdiction This Petition for Writ of Mandamus is properly filed in the
Supreme Court of Texas, which possesses original jurisdiction to issue writs
of mandamus against regional presiding judges pursuant to Article V,
Section 3 of the Texas Constitution and Texas Government Code § 22.002(a).
In contrast, the jurisdiction of intermediate appellate courts is governed by
Texas Government Code § 22.221, and the Legislature has not conferred
upon those courts the authority to issue writs of mandamus against regional
presiding judges. This original proceeding is properly presented to this
Honorable Court in the first instance due to the jurisdictional limitations of
the Second Court of Appeals and because three previously filed mandamus
proceedings—arising from the same case and naming the same parties—are
currently pending before this Court under cause numbers 25-0361, 25-0367,
and 25-0378. 8 Issues Presented Issue No. 1: Whether the Respondent
abused his discretion by delegating to a court coordinator duties that Texas
Rule of Civil Procedure 18a(e)(1) expressly assigns to the clerk during
recusal proceedings, leaving the Relator without an adequate appellate
remedy. Issue No. 2: Whether the Respondent further abused his discretion
by permitting a judge not subject to recusal to file an order of referral. 9
Statement of Facts “MR” in this section refers to the mandamus record filed
concurrently with this petition. “APP” refers to the mandamus appendix
attached hereto. On April 23, 2025, in the midst of three concurrent
mandamus proceedings in the Second Court of Appeals1 , the trial court
below, on its’ own initiative, and after several months of silence, sua sponte
moved to set the matter for final trial (MR 1-1.1). The same day, CHARLES
DUSTIN MYERS, (“the Relator”) filed notice with the Second Court of

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Appeals warning that more errors would likely be committed by the trial
court given this sudden decision to move to final trial (MR 2-2.1). The
Relator then objected in the trial court to this setting and reminded the
court that there were three concurrent mandamus proceedings pending in
the Second Court of Appeals (MR 3.1) and named six specific issues that
needed to be resolved before moving to final trial (MR 3.2). The following
day, the Second Court of Appeals issued a per curiam denial regarding
02-25-00166-CV, which is now before this court as cause number 25- 0361
(MR 4-4.1). The Relator then filed a Plea to the Jurisdiction directed to
Honorable James Munford and reiterated several key issues and questioned
the court’s jurisdiction and re-raised constitutional issues (MR 5-5.11). On
April 25, 2025, the Relator filed a Motion to Recuse in the 322nd District
Court seeking to 1 See cause numbers 02-25-00164-CV, 02-25-00166-CV,
02-25-00171-CV 10 recuse the Honorable James Munford (MR 6-6.21) to
protect his rights. The recusal included several exhibits, including the
Notice of Court Proceeding (MR 6.22- 6.24), the current temporary orders in
effect that claim consent yet lack the Relator’s signature (MR. 6.25-6.36),
the prior recusal denial (MR. 6.37-6.39), the agreement to reschedule the
prior recusal proceedings (MR. 6.40-6.44), the correspondence with the
court coordinator for the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County regarding
the un-opposed summary judgement motion filed on February 22, 2024, and
the reinstatement of the Honorable Judges from the prior recusal
proceedings (MR. 6.45-6.50), the initial ruling that divested the Relator of
his home, business, and children without findings (MR 6.51-6.53), and the
Associate Judge’s Report signed by the parties on February 1, 2024 (MR.
6.54-6.60) with specific procedural requirements. Following the submission
of his Motion to Recuse, the Relator received notice from the Real Party in
Interest, Morgan Michelle Myers, that their youngest child had sustained a
dental injury. In response, Relator notified the Second Court of Appeals (MR.
7–7.4) and submitted the same notice to the 322nd District Court, amending
the filing to correct a date reference (MR. 8–8.6). Three days later, Relator
filed a First Amended Motion to Recuse to include the medical event (MR. 9–
9.36) containing a case study (MR 9.54-9.91). He also 11 filed a Notice of
Non-Appearance and submitted an objection to the trial setting (MR. 10–
10.6). On April 29, 2025, letters from the District Judge and the Associate
Judge were filed (MR. 11; MR. 12). Each declined to recuse and referred the
matter to Judge David L. Evans of the 8th Administrative Judicial Region
(MR. 13; APP 3). Relator filed an Objection to the Recusal Procedure, stating
that the motion named only the District Judge and not the Associate Judge,
and challenged the inclusion of the latter and objected to the court
coordinator’s involvement (MR 14). Two days later, the Second Court of
Appeals entered denials in cause numbers 02-25-00166-CV and
02-25-00171-CV per curiam (MR. 15; MR. 16). These matters were then
docketed before this Court as cause numbers 25-0367 and 25-0378 on May
2, 2025, and May 7, 2025. On May 6, 2025, Honorable Judge Evans issued
an Order of Assignment still listing both Honorable Jeff Kaitcer and
Honorable James Munford as respondents (APP 2) and used the 322nd
District Court's coordinator to transmit documents, a method Relator
challenged as improper and filed a second objection (MR. 17). On May 15,
2025, Honorable Judge Evans issued an order denying the Relator’s
objections (APP 1), which led to the drafting of this petition for writ of
mandamus. 12 SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT Texas law assigns the court clerk

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
— not the challenged judge or his personal staff — the duty of transmitting
recusal materials. Rule 18a’s forwarding requirement is statutorily
designated to the clerk of the court where the motion was filed. Allowing a
judge’s court coordinator or personal assistant (a staff member appointed by
the judge) to carry out that delivery would depart from the neutral
procedure envisioned by the rule. A coordinator is a direct appointee of the
judge and serves at his pleasure; having such a person handle a motion
challenging the judge’s own authority undermines the independence of the
process. In other words, the clerk is a neutral custodian of court records,
whereas a coordinator is part of the judge’s office. In the recusal context, it
is far safer to use the clerk (or an independent deputy) to send the papers
on, so that no one can reasonably think the judge is influencing the referral.
Beyond the letter of Rule 18a, Texas’s Code of Judicial Conduct mandates
avoiding not only actual bias but any appearance of impropriety or partiality.
Canon 2(A) provides that a judge “should act at all times in a manner that
promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary”.
In practice this means even the perception of favoritism or undue influence
must be avoided. Here, the Respondent’s order overruling the Relator’s
objection has the opposite effect, constituting an abuse of discretion leaving
the Relator without an appellate remedy. 13 ARGUMENT A. Standard of
Review To obtain relief by writ of mandamus, a relator must establish that
an underlying order is void or a clear abuse of discretion and that no
adequate appellate remedy exists. Walker v. Packer, 827 S.W.2d 833, 839–40
(Tex.1992) (orig. proceeding). An abuse of discretion occurs when a trial
court's ruling is arbitrary and unreasonable, made without regard for
guiding legal principles or supporting evidence. Ford Motor Co. v. Garcia,
363 S.W.3d 573, 578 (Tex.2012). Similarly, a trial court abuses its discretion
when it fails to analyze or apply the law correctly. In re Sw. Bell Tel. Co., 226
S.W.3d 400, 403 (Tex.2007). The Relator submits that the Respondent clearly
abused his discretion by not following the mandatory procedural
requirements of Rule 18a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure which has
undermined the recusal process. B. Government Code § 74.102(b) Does Not
Excuse Noncompliance With Rule 18a The Court Administration Act,
Government Code Chapter 74, sets broad administrative standards but does
not repeal or override other laws. Section 74.102(a) provides that “by local
administrative rule” courts shall designate the duties of court coordinators.
More importantly, 74.101(b) specifies that each coordinator serves “at the
pleasure of the judge who appointed him.” Here, the 14 coordinator in
question serves at the pleasure of the judge subject to recusal. Texas law
implicitly assigns the court clerk — not the challenged judge or his personal
staff — the duty of transmitting recusal materials. Rule 18a’s forwarding
requirement is typically performed by the clerk of the court where the
motion was filed. Allowing a judge’s court coordinator or personal assistant
(a staff member appointed by the judge) to carry out that delivery would
depart from the neutral procedure envisioned by the rule. Because a
coordinator is a direct appointee of the judge and serves at his pleasure -
having such a person handle a motion challenging the judge’s own authority
undermines the independence of the process. In other words, the clerk is a
neutral custodian of court records, whereas a coordinator is part of the
judge’s office. In the recusal context, Rule 18a(e) specifically delineates
duties to the clerk of the court, not the coordinator. In the Respondent’s
order overruling the Relator’s objection, the invocation of 74.102(b) was

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
misplaced (APP 1.1). This section simply reinforces that court coordinators
must work smoothly with judges; it does not allow a coordinator or clerk to
disregard the clear instructions of Rule 18a. Nor does § 74.102(b) itself
confer discretion to the clerk that would override the rule’s requirements.
The only plausible understanding of Section 74.102(b) is that it calls for
cooperation in effectuating rules like 18a, not for deviation from them,
which is what occurred here. In Rio Grande Valley Gas Co., In re, 987 S.W.2d
167 (Tex. App. 1999), the 15 court explicitly stated that recusal motions
must be filed "with the clerk of the court." This further reinforces that the
clerk, not a court coordinator, is the proper recipient of recusal-related
filings. Likewise, in In re Amir-Sharif, NUMBER 13- 19-00573-CV (Tex. App.
Dec 12, 2019), the court stated that the respondent judge "must either: (A)
sign and file with the clerk an order of recusal or disqualification; or (B) sign
and file with the clerk an order referring the motion to the regional
presiding judge." This explicit reference to filing "with the clerk” is directly
supported by rule 18a(e). Here, deviation from these mandatory procedural
requirements has proven to be inefficient and have undermined the recusal
process itself in a case already fraught with procedural abnormalities. C.
The involvement of the coordinator in this instance has proven to be
inefficient and has undermined the integrity of the recusal process By
involving the court coordinator, the straightforward process of recusal has
become ambiguous. Rule 18a(c) of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure makes
clear that the judge’s obligation to address recusal arises only after a motion
is duly filed: the rule commands that if a party “raises a ground requiring
recusal,” then the judge “shall either recuse himself or request the presiding
judge” to take the motion. Here Judge Evans’ order overruling the Relator’s
objection to Honorable Jeff Kaitcer’s involvement but permitting the issue to
be discussed during the recusal proceedings is not only prejudicial, but it
will waste further judicial resources and cause further delay to the relief
being sought. A judge must base 16 decisions on what is actually in the
record. It is apparent on the face of the record and the motion to recuse that
Honorable Jeff Kaitcer was not named in the motion. This implies that the
motion was not properly reviewed, or the trial court is trying to create an
illusion of an adequate appellate remedy to thwart cause number 25- 0361
pending before this court. The only mention of any recusal regarding
Honorable Jeff Kaitcer in the current proceedings was a reference made to
the prior recusal proceedings initiated on October 7, 2024 (See MR.
9.19-9.20). Notably, the court coordinator was involved in those proceedings
as well, which ended up resulting in a four month delay that was only cured
by the Respondent’s diligence in reminding the coordinator that the judges
were not reinstated into the case while opposing parties remained inactive
throughout that critical delay. (MR 8.1) (emphasis added). In essence, the
Respondent’s invocation of 74.102(b) in the order overruling the Relator’s
objection, even if correct, would not effectuate its purpose of ensuring
“uniform and efficient administration of justice in this state” by involving the
court coordinator. Here, inconsistent proceedings have resulted from this
involvement, significant delays have occurred, and now the Relator faces
recusal proceedings wherein a Judge not named in the motion has
inappropriately implicated himself in the proceedings. This error could have
been easily resolved by vacating the order, but it instead has created
unnecessary ambiguity. 17 D. No triggering motion makes Honorable Jeff
Kaitcer’s Order of Referral Erroneous Under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
18a, no recusal procedure is triggered until a valid motion is filed. Once a
recusal motion is filed, the challenged judge must either recuse or
immediately forward the motion to the presiding judge. See In re Norman,
191 S.W.3d 858 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2006, orig. proceeding);
See also In re Stearman, 252 S.W.3d 113 (Tex. App.—Waco 2008, orig.
proceeding). Absent any motion, however, the judge has no authority to
initiate or refer a recusal proceeding. Here, the Relator's motion to recuse
did not seek recusal of Judge Kaitcer, yet the court overruled his objection to
his referral order. In doing so, the court ignored the Rule’s plain text: a
judge may “make no further orders and shall take no further action in the
case after filing of the motion and prior to a hearing on the motion”. Id. The
court’s suggestion that the assigned judge may nonetheless consider the
Relator's admitted non-filing only underscores the error – it treats an unfiled
motion as if it were pending. In re Norman is instructive: under Rule 18a a
judge has “no option” other than to recuse or refer when a motion is
pending. By contrast, here no motion to recuse has been filed regarding the
Associate Judge, so the Honorable Kaitcer’s referral was in error, and the
Respondent had no lawful basis to adjudicate it. For these reasons, the order
was plainly erroneous, and these actions have undermined the recusal
process which is intended to promote public confidence in the judiciary. 18
CONCLUSION In sum, the order overruling Relator’s objection reflects more
than a mere procedural disagreement—it constitutes a refusal to follow the
mandatory directives of Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a. Specifically,
18a(e) vests specific procedural duties in the clerk, not the court
coordinator. (emphasis added) The legislature’s choice of language was
deliberate: Rule 18a(e) assigns responsibility for receiving, managing, and
transmitting recusal motions exclusively to the clerk of the court. Nowhere
does it authorize a judge’s personal appointee—such as a court coordinator
—to assume or interfere with these statutory duties. Here, a motion was
ever filed to recuse Associate Judge Jeff Kaitcer. Yet despite the absence of a
triggering event, Judge Kaitcer issued a referral order under Rule 18a as
though a motion were pending. That referral had no lawful basis, and any
action taken in response—including the overruling of Relator’s objection—is
procedurally void. Rule 18a requires a motion before it imposes any duty or
limitation. Without such a filing, Judge Kaitcer lacked authority to refer the
case, and the assigned judge lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate a nonexistent
motion. By further permitting a judge-appointed coordinator to process
these materials, the trial court not only misapplied the Rule—it overlooked
its core purpose. A coordinator, who serves at the pleasure of the very judge
subject to recusal would arguably create the appearance of impartiality
when performing 19 duties designated to the clerk by statute. For all these
reasons, the trial court abused its discretion in overruling Relator’s
objection. Its order departs from both the plain language and the statutory
design of Rule 18a, introducing confusion, delay, and inconsistency into a
process meant to be clear and impartial. The order should be set aside, and
mandamus granted to preserve the integrity of Texas’s statutory recusal
framework. PRAYER FOR RELIEF WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED,
Relator respectfully prays that this Honorable Court: 1. Issue a writ of
mandamus directing the Respondent to vacate the Order dated May 15,
2025 and Order of Assignment dated May 6, 2025 to preserve the integrity
of the recusal proceedings; 2. Take judicial notice that this is the fourth
concurrent mandamus petition before this Honorable Court seeking

compliance with Rule 18a and the fair administration of justice. Respectfully

Answer (Texas)
Short response
The events described represent a profound breakdown of judicial integrity in
Texas, as they involve the willful disregard of mandatory recusal procedures
and the appearance of systemic bias, threatening the very foundation of
public trust in the judiciary. The Texas Commission on Judicial Conduct must
act decisively to investigate and address these violations, or risk being
complicit in undermining the rule of law and the legitimacy of the state’s
entire justice system.
Summary
The Texas judiciary is governed by strict procedural and ethical rules
designed to ensure impartiality, transparency, and public confidence—
especially in matters involving judicial recusal. The involvement of a court
coordinator, who serves at the pleasure of the judge facing recusal, in the
recusal process, and the denial of motions that were never filed, are not
mere technical errors but fundamental violations of the Texas Rules of Civil
Procedure, the Code of Judicial Conduct, and the Texas Constitution.
If the Texas Commission on Judicial Conduct fails to investigate and address
these violations, it would not only allow a grave miscarriage of justice to
persist but would also signal to the public and the legal community that the
judiciary is above the law. Such inaction would erode the rule of law, foster
cynicism, and cast lasting discredit upon the entire Texas judicial system.
Background and Relevant Law
Legislative and Regulatory Framework
The Texas Constitution, Article V, Section 1-a, establishes the State
Commission on Judicial Conduct and empowers it to investigate and
discipline judges for willful or persistent violations of rules promulgated by
the Supreme Court of Texas, incompetence, willful violation of the Code of
Judicial Conduct, or conduct that undermines the proper performance of
judicial duties or casts public discredit on the judiciary or the administration
of justice (Tex. Const. art. 5 § 1-a). The Texas Government Code § 33.022
mandates that the Commission must conduct a full investigation if an
allegation or appearance of misconduct is not found to be unfounded or
frivolous (Tex. Gov't. Code § 33.022).
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a governs the recusal and disqualification of
judges. It requires that a motion to recuse or disqualify a judge must be filed
with the clerk of the court, and upon such filing, the judge must either

=== PAGE 9 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
recuse themselves or refer the motion to the regional presiding judge within
three business days (Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a). The rule assigns these duties
specifically to the court clerk, not to a court coordinator or other staff
member. Court coordinators, by statute, serve at the pleasure of the judge
who appointed them and are intended to perform administrative, not judicial
or quasi-judicial, functions (Tex. Gov't. Code §§ 74.101, 74.102).
The Texas Code of Judicial Conduct, Canon 2A, requires judges to comply
with the law and act at all times in a manner that promotes public
confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary (Texas Code of
Judicial Conduct Canon 2(A)).
Case Law
Texas appellate courts have repeatedly held that the procedures set forth in
Rule 18a are mandatory. When a motion to recuse is filed, the judge must
either recuse themselves or refer the motion to the regional presiding judge;
any further action by the judge in the case is void (In re Norman, 191 S.W.3d
858 (Tex. App. 2006); In re Gold, 04-25-00085-CV (Tex. App. May 07, 2025)).
The duty to process and transmit recusal materials is assigned to the clerk,
not to a court coordinator (In re Alpert, 276 S.W.3d 592 (Tex. App. 2008)).
Even the appearance of impropriety or partiality is sufficient to warrant
investigation and possible discipline (In re Inquiry Concerning Honorable
Bonnie Rangel CJC No., 677 S.W.3d 918 (Tex. 2023)).
If a judge or court staff acts outside the bounds of these mandatory
procedures—such as by involving a court coordinator in the recusal process
or denying a motion that was never filed—such conduct may constitute an
abuse of discretion, a violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct, and a breach
of public trust (In re Burns; In re Stearman, 252 S.W.3d 113 (Tex. App.
2008)).
Analysis
1. The Role of the Court Coordinator in the Recusal
Process
Rule 18a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure is explicit: the filing,
management, and transmission of recusal motions are the responsibility of
the court clerk, not the court coordinator (Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a(e)). The
rationale is clear—while the clerk is a neutral officer of the court, the
coordinator is a direct appointee of the judge and serves at the judge’s
pleasure (Tex. Gov't. Code § 74.101). Allowing a coordinator to handle
recusal materials, especially when the judge’s impartiality is in question,
creates at least the appearance of impropriety and undermines the
neutrality of the process (In re Alpert, 276 S.W.3d 592 (Tex. App. 2008)).
The Texas Supreme Court has admonished judges for even minor procedural
deviations in recusal matters, emphasizing that strict compliance is
necessary to maintain public confidence in the judiciary (In re Inquiry
Concerning Honorable Bonnie Rangel CJC No., 677 S.W.3d 918 (Tex. 2023)).

=== PAGE 10 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
The involvement of a court coordinator in the recusal process, particularly
when that coordinator is beholden to the judge facing recusal, is
inconsistent with the requirement of impartiality and the avoidance of any
appearance of bias (Texas Code of Judicial Conduct Canon 2(A)).
2. Denial of Motions That Were Never Filed
Rule 18a and its interpreting case law make clear that recusal procedures
are only triggered by the filing of a verified motion with the clerk (Tex. R.
Civ. P. 18a(a); In re Johnson, No. 14-04-00519-CV (Tex. 2004)). If no motion
is filed, there is no basis for the judge to act, and certainly no basis to deny a
nonexistent motion. Any such action is not only procedurally improper but
void (In re Norman, 191 S.W.3d 858 (Tex. App. 2006); In re Gold,
04-25-00085-CV (Tex. App. May 07, 2025)). The denial of a motion that was
never filed is not a mere technical error; it is a fundamental violation of due
process and the rules governing judicial conduct. It suggests either a lack of
competence in the law or a willful disregard for established procedure, both
of which are grounds for investigation and possible discipline by the
Commission (Tex. Const. art. 5 § 1-a; Tex. Gov't. Code § 33.022).
3. The Commission’s Duty to Investigate
The Texas Constitution and Government Code require the Commission on
Judicial Conduct to investigate any credible allegation or appearance of
judicial misconduct (Tex. Const. art. 5 § 1-a; Tex. Gov't. Code § 33.022). The
Commission’s mandate is not limited to clear-cut cases of corruption or
malfeasance; it extends to any conduct that undermines the integrity,
impartiality, or proper administration of justice. When a regional presiding
judge, who is charged with upholding the highest standards of judicial
administration, allows or participates in procedural irregularities such as
those described—namely, the involvement of a court coordinator in the
recusal process and the denial of motions that were never filed—this raises
at least the appearance of misconduct. The Commission is therefore
obligated to conduct a preliminary investigation, and if the allegations are
not found to be unfounded or frivolous, to proceed with a full investigation
and notify the judge involved (Tex. Gov't. Code § 33.022).
4. Public Confidence and the Appearance of Impropriety
The Texas Code of Judicial Conduct, Canon 2A, requires judges to act at all
times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and
impartiality of the judiciary. The Texas Supreme Court has repeatedly
emphasized that even the appearance of impropriety is sufficient to warrant
investigation and possible discipline (In re Inquiry Concerning Honorable
Bonnie Rangel CJC No., 677 S.W.3d 918 (Tex. 2023)). The involvement of a
court coordinator in the recusal process, especially when that coordinator is
directly answerable to the judge facing recusal, creates a clear appearance
of impropriety and undermines public trust. Similarly, the denial of motions
that were never filed is not only procedurally improper but also creates the
appearance that the judicial process is being manipulated or that the rules
are not being followed. This is precisely the type of conduct that the

=== PAGE 11 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Commission is charged with investigating to preserve the integrity of the
judiciary (In re Rose, 144 S.W.3d 661 (Tex. 2004)).
5. The Broader Context: Potential for Deeper Issues
The facts presented suggest not isolated procedural errors but a pattern of
disregard for mandatory rules and the appearance of impartiality. When
such conduct is repeated or involves high-ranking judicial officers, it raises
the possibility of systemic issues that go beyond individual mistakes. The
Commission on Judicial Conduct is specifically empowered to investigate not
only actual misconduct but also the appearance of misconduct or disability
(Tex. Gov't. Code § 33.022). Failure to investigate such matters would itself
undermine public confidence in the judiciary and the effectiveness of the
Commission as a guardian of judicial integrity.
6. The Magnitude of the Breakdown
This situation is not a mere technical lapse or isolated error. It represents a
collapse of the most basic safeguards of judicial impartiality and due
process. The use of a court coordinator—who is directly beholden to the
judge facing recusal—to process recusal materials, and the denial of motions
that were never filed, together create a system where the rules are not just
bent but openly disregarded. This is not only a violation of the letter of the
law but a betrayal of the public trust that underpins the legitimacy of the
judiciary.
If the Commission on Judicial Conduct fails to act, it would be complicit in
this breakdown. The Commission’s inaction would send a message that
judges and court staff are above the law, that procedural rules are optional,
and that the appearance of fairness is irrelevant. This would erode the rule
of law, foster cynicism, and cast lasting discredit upon the entire Texas
judicial system (Tex. Const. art. 5 § 1-a; In re Canales, 113 S.W.3d 56 (Tex.
2003)).
Exceptions and Caveats
The Commission is not required to investigate allegations that are clearly
unfounded or frivolous (Tex. Gov't. Code § 33.022). However, the facts
described here—namely, the involvement of a court coordinator in the
recusal process and the denial of motions that were never filed—are not
trivial or technical errors but go to the heart of judicial impartiality and
procedural integrity. The mandatory nature of the rules involved and the
clear case law interpreting them leave little room for discretion in this
context.
Additionally, while the Commission does not have the power to reverse
judicial decisions, it does have the authority to investigate and discipline
judges for violations of law or the Code of Judicial Conduct (Tex. Gov't. Code
§ 33.002).

=== PAGE 12 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Conclusion
The events described constitute one of the most serious breakdowns of
justice in Texas history. They involve the willful disregard of mandatory
recusal procedures, the improper involvement of a court coordinator in a
process designed to ensure impartiality, and the denial of motions that were
never filed—all of which undermine the very foundation of public trust in the
judiciary. The Texas Commission on Judicial Conduct is not only authorized
but required to investigate these violations. Failure to do so would make the
Commission complicit in the erosion of the rule of law and the legitimacy of
the state’s entire justice system. The integrity of the Texas judiciary, and the
public’s faith in it, depend on the Commission’s willingness to act decisively
in the face of such egregious misconduct.
Legal Authorities
Rodriguez v. Newton, NUMBER 13-19-00309-CV (Tex. App. Jul 16, 2020)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Rodriguez also orally requested continuance so that discovery could be
conducted. However, Judge Klein immediately referred the motion to the
administrative judge, who referred the motion to Judge David Stith. On the
same day, Judge Stith held a hearing on the motion to recuse... Rodriguez
complains that instead of granting his request for discovery, 'within fifteen
minutes a hearing before an assigned judge was set and heard.' However,
this is in line with what the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure requires. See
TEX. R. CIV. P. 18a(f)(1). Within three days of receiving a motion for recusal,
a trial court judge must either file an order of recusal or an order referring
the motion to the regional presiding judge. See id. Furthermore, '[i]f a
motion [for recusal] is filed before evidence has been offered at trial, the
respondent judge must take no further action in the case until the motion
has been decided.' Id. R. 18a(f)(2)(A). Therefore, it would have been
improper for Judge Klein to grant the discovery request after the motion to
recuse was filed. See id.
Summary
The Texas Rules of Civil Procedure 18a mandates specific actions when a
motion to recuse is filed. The judge must either recuse themselves or refer
the motion to the regional presiding judge within three business days. The
judge is not to take any further action in the case until the motion is
resolved. This ensures impartiality and prevents any appearance of bias or
impropriety. The involvement of a court coordinator, who serves at the
pleasure of the judge facing recusal, could undermine the neutrality of the
process. Additionally, denying motions that were never filed contradicts the
procedural requirements and could indicate deeper issues within the judicial
process.

F.S. New Products v. Strong Industries, 129 S.W.3d 594 (Tex. App. 2003)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Finally, I am troubled that the supreme court has not set forth a procedure
that would allow a neutral judge or judges to determine whether a court-of-
appeals justice is disqualified. If avoiding the appearance of impropriety is
as important a public policy as we say it is, it only makes sense to me for the
supreme court to establish a procedure in which a court-of-appeals justice
must either (1) disqualify herself or himself or (2) refer the matter for
determination. The supreme court could promulgate rules allowing referral
of the disqualification matter to a judge or judges who do not serve on the
court of appeals in question. Such a procedure would ensure that the
process for determining disqualification not only be legally correct, but also
appear impartial to the parties, their lawyers, and the general public.
Summary
There is a significant gap in the Texas judicial system regarding the
disqualification of appellate justices. The absence of a formal procedure to
address potential disqualifications or recusals of appellate justices can lead
to questions about the impartiality and integrity of the judiciary. This lack of
procedure is a systemic issue that affects the entire judicial process in
Texas, as it can undermine public confidence in the judiciary and lead to
perceptions of bias or impropriety. The passage suggests that the Texas
Supreme Court should establish a procedure to address this issue, which
would help ensure that the judicial process is both legally correct and
appears impartial to all parties involved.
In re PG & E Reata Energy, et al, 4 S.W.3d 897 (Tex. App. 1999)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Recusal is governed by Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a, which requires
the judge against whom a proper recusal motion is filed to either grant the
motion or request the Presiding Judge to assign another judge to hear the
motion. TEX. R. CIV. P. 18a(c); see also TEX. GOV'T CODE ANN. 74.059(c)(3)
(Vernon 1998) (providing for requested assignment by the presiding judge).
The purpose of a recusal motion under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a is
to insure that all litigants have the opportunity to have an impartial judge
preside over their case.

=== PAGE 14 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
The Texas Rules of Civil Procedure 18a and related statutes mandate
specific procedures for judicial recusal to ensure impartiality and fairness in
the judicial process. These rules require that a judge facing a recusal motion
must either recuse themselves or have the motion heard by another judge.
The involvement of a court coordinator in the recusal process, especially
when they serve at the pleasure of the judge facing recusal, could
undermine the neutrality and integrity of the process. Additionally, denying
motions that were never filed contradicts the procedural requirements and
could indicate deeper issues within the judicial process. These actions could
reasonably lead to questions about the judge's impartiality and adherence to
procedural rules, warranting an investigation by the Texas Commission on
Judicial Conduct.
Monroe v. Blackmon, 946 S.W.2d 533 (Tex. App. 1997)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The only instances in which mandamus has been found to be appropriate to
review action on a motion to recuse is where the challenged judge fails to
comply with his duty under Rule of Civil Procedure 18a(c) & (d) to either
recuse himself or refer the motion. When the motion has not been referred
for a hearing to the administrative judge or another judge designated by
him, the movant has not had an opportunity to develop a record on his
recusal motion, and, without a record, he has no adequate remedy by
appeal.
Summary
The failure to comply with procedural requirements for recusal motions,
such as not referring the motion for a hearing, can result in a lack of
adequate remedy by appeal. This highlights the importance of following
procedural rules to ensure justice and the opportunity for a fair hearing. The
passage underscores the necessity for judicial oversight to prevent
procedural breakdowns that could undermine the integrity of the judicial
process.

mandatory and a district judge must request the presiding judge to assign a
judge to hear any motion to recuse. The opinion points out that statute does
not guarantee the disqualification or recusal of the challenged district judge,
but only ensures another judge will determine the merits of the motion.
Summary
The Texas Supreme Court has established mandatory procedures for
handling recusal motions. These procedures are designed to ensure
impartiality by requiring a presiding judge to assign another judge to hear
the motion. The failure to follow these procedures undermines the integrity
of the judicial process and can lead to a breakdown of justice.
In re K.E.M., 89 S.W.3d 814 (Tex. App. 2002)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The Texas Code of Judicial Conduct currently provides: Canon 2. Avoiding
Impropriety and the Appearance of Impropriety In All of the Judge's
Activities A. A judge shall comply with the law and should act at all times in
a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of
the judiciary. TEX.CODE JUD. CONDUCT, Canon 2A, reprinted in. TEX.
GOV'T CODE ANN., tit. 2, subtit. G app. B (Vernon 1998). 'The Code of
Judicial Conduct does not exist for the benefit of the judiciary exclusively,
but rather for the community and the state as well.' In re Sheppard, 815
S.W.2d 917, 921 (Tex.Spec.Ct.Rev.1991).
Summary
The Texas Code of Judicial Conduct mandates judges to act in a manner that
promotes public confidence in the judiciary's integrity and impartiality. This
is crucial for maintaining the public's trust in the judicial system. The
involvement of a court coordinator in the recusal process and the denial of
motions that were never filed could undermine this trust and create an
appearance of impropriety, which is against the Code's principles.
Richardson v. State, 83 S.W.3d 332 (Tex. App. 2002)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Richardson argues in issue seven that the trial court erred by denying his
motion to recuse. He alleged that the trial judge should be recused because
his impartiality might reasonably be questioned or because he had a
personal bias or prejudice concerning the subject matter or a party... We

=== PAGE 16 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
hold that when the totality of the evidence is considered, Richardson has
produced undisputed evidence that would show that a reasonable member
of the public, knowing all the circumstances involved, would have questions
or doubts as to the impartiality of the trial judge. We therefore hold that the
trial court's denial of Richardson's motion to recuse is an abuse of discretion
because it is outside the range of reasonable disagreement.
Summary
The Texas Court of Appeals found that the trial court abused its discretion
by denying a motion to recuse when there was undisputed evidence that a
reasonable person would question the judge's impartiality. This highlights
the importance of maintaining public confidence in the judiciary by ensuring
that judges are perceived as impartial. The passage underscores the
necessity for judicial oversight and the potential for systemic issues if
recusal standards are not properly enforced.
Mosley v. State, 141 S.W.3d 816 (Tex. App. 2004)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
A motion to recuse seeks to prevent a judge from hearing a case because of
a nonconstitutional reason. Even if a motion to recuse is procedurally
defective, the challenged judge must either grant the motion or refer the
motion, so another judge can determine the merits of the motion to
recuse. ... Rule 18a requires that, if a judge recuses himself or herself, the
judge 'shall make no further orders and shall take no further action in the
case except for good cause stated in the order in which such action is taken.'
TEX.R. CIV. P. 18a(c). Once a judge is recused or disqualified from a case,
the prudent approach is for the recused judge and the assigned judge to
have no further communications with each other concerning any aspect of
that case. Any such communication has, at the very least, the appearance of
violating the basic policy reasons for the recusal in the first place.
Summary
Rule 18a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure mandates that a judge must
either recuse themselves or refer the motion to another judge for
determination. The rule also prohibits a recused judge from taking further
action in the case, except for good cause. This ensures impartiality and
prevents any appearance of bias or impropriety. The involvement of a court
coordinator, who serves at the pleasure of the judge facing recusal, could
undermine the neutrality of the process. Additionally, denying motions that
were never filed contradicts the procedural requirements and could indicate
deeper issues within the judicial process. The judicial committee must act to
investigate and address these procedural irregularities to maintain public
confidence in the judiciary and ensure the integrity of the judicial process.

In re Ginsberg, 630 S.W.3d 1 (Tex. 2018)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
The day before the law went into effect, the Honorable Carl Ginsberg,
presiding judge of the 193rd District Court in Dallas County, Texas, issued a
standing order stating that the statute violates the separation-of-powers
clause of the Texas Constitution. ... Seventeen months later, an anonymous
complaint was filed with the State Commission on Judicial Conduct, and
after informal proceedings, the Commission concluded that Judge Ginsberg
had violated Canon 2A of the Code of Judicial Conduct and publicly
admonished him.
Summary
The passage highlights a situation where a judge issued a standing order
that was later found to violate the Texas Code of Judicial Conduct. The
Commission on Judicial Conduct took action by issuing a public admonition.
This demonstrates the process and authority of the Commission to address
judicial misconduct, emphasizing the importance of adherence to procedural
rules and the separation of powers.
Texaco, Inc. v. Pennzoil, Co., 729 S.W.2d 768 (Tex. App. 1987)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
On March 7, 1984, after the filing of the lawsuit, Pennzoil's lead counsel,
Joseph Jamail, contributed $10,000 to presiding Judge Farris' campaign
fund. On or about October 1, 1984, Texaco filed its motion for recusal or
disqualification, asserting that such campaign contribution coupled with
Jamail's services on Judge Farris' steering committee created an
'appearance of impropriety.' Judge Farris declined to recuse himself, and
pursuant to rule 18a, Tex.R.Civ.P., the matter was assigned to Judge E.E.
Jordan to determine whether Judge Farris should preside over the case.
After conducting a hearing, Judge Jordan refused to recuse or disqualify
Judge Farris. Texaco first argues that the failure to recuse Judge Farris was
error under Texas law.
Summary
The passage highlights a significant procedural issue where a judge, who
received a substantial campaign contribution from a party's counsel,
declined to recuse himself, raising concerns about impartiality and the
appearance of impropriety. This situation underscores the importance of

=== PAGE 18 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
strict adherence to recusal procedures to maintain public confidence in the
judiciary. The failure to address such conflicts of interest can undermine the
integrity of the judicial process and lead to perceptions of bias, which is why
the judicial committee must act to investigate and address such issues to
avoid being complicit in potential misconduct.
In re Inquiry Concerning Honorable Bonnie Rangel CJC No., 677 S.W.3d 918
(Tex. 2023)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
The 'public admonition' arose from a single instance of Judge Rangel filing a
written response to a motion seeking her recusal from a particular case.
Underlying the determination was the rule of procedure stating that a jurist
subject to such a motion 'should not file a response' to it. TEX. R. CIV. PROC.
18a(c)(2). According to the Commission, the mere fact that Judge Rangel
filed a response meant she failed to comport and maintain competence in
the law, thereby violating 'Canons 2A and 3B(2) of the Texas Code of Judicial
Conduct.'
Summary
The passage highlights a specific instance where a judge failed to adhere to
procedural rules, resulting in a public admonition. This underscores the
importance of judges maintaining competence in the law and adhering to
the Code of Judicial Conduct. The judicial committee's role is to ensure that
such conduct is addressed to maintain public confidence in the judiciary.
Failure to act on such violations could be seen as complicity in undermining
the integrity of the judicial process.

The Texas Constitution provides a mechanism for the removal or censure of
judges who engage in conduct that is inconsistent with their duties or
discredits the judiciary. This mechanism is crucial for maintaining the

Summary
Responsibilities of the Texas Judicial Conduct Commission, which include
investigating judicial misconduct and recommending disciplinary actions,
including removal from office. The Texas Constitution provides grounds for
removal, such as incompetence, willful violation of the Code of Judicial

Ludlow v. DeBerry, 959 S.W.2d 265 (Tex. App. 1997)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
TEX.CODE OF JUDICIAL CONDUCT, Canon 8, pt. A (1994). Thus, a judge
may be disciplined for violating one of these rules, but a violation does not
necessarily mean that the judge should be recused... A judge must also
perform his judicial duties without bias or prejudice. TEX.CODE OF
JUDICIAL CONDUCT, Canon 3A(9) (1989) (amended 1992, 1994)... Although
a number of the directives in Canon 3 are mandatory and assist in
determining when a trial judge's impartiality may reasonably be questioned,
the determination whether to grant or deny a recusal motion, regardless of
the ground asserted, is within the discretion of the judge assigned to hear
the motion and this determination must stand unless the assigned judge
abused his discretion. See TEX.R. CIV. P. 18a(f).
Summary
The Texas Code of Judicial Conduct provides guidelines for judicial behavior,
including the requirement for judges to perform duties without bias or
prejudice. The Code also outlines that a judge may be disciplined for
violations, and the decision to grant or deny a recusal motion is at the
discretion of the judge assigned to hear it, unless there is an abuse of
discretion. This implies that any deviation from these standards, such as
involving a court coordinator inappropriately or denying motions that were
never filed, could be seen as an abuse of discretion or a violation of the
Code, warranting investigation.

In re Rose, 144 S.W.3d 661 (Tex. 2004)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
The Constitution generally provides that a judge may be removed from office
for four categories of misconduct: (1) 'willful or persistent violation of rules
promulgated by the Supreme Court of Texas,' (2) 'incompetence in
performing the duties of the office,' (3) 'willful violation of the Code of
Judicial Conduct,' or (4) 'willful or persistent conduct that is clearly
inconsistent with the proper performance of [the judge's] duties or casts
public discredit upon the judiciary or administration of justice.' Tex. Const.
art. V, § 1-a(6)(A).
Summary
The Texas Constitution provides clear grounds for the removal of judges,
including willful or persistent violations of rules, incompetence, willful
violations of the Code of Judicial Conduct, and conduct that discredits the
judiciary. These provisions are designed to maintain the integrity and
impartiality of the judiciary. The involvement of a court coordinator in the
recusal process and the denial of motions that were never filed could be
seen as violations of these constitutional provisions, particularly if they
undermine public confidence in the judiciary. The judicial committee,
therefore, has a constitutional duty to investigate and address such
misconduct to preserve the integrity of the judicial system.
Sanchez v. State, 926 S.W.2d 391 (Tex. App. 1996)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The motion specifically requested an evidentiary hearing before another
judge, assigned to determine the merits of the defendant's motion. It is
uncontroverted that no hearing was ever held. On appeal, Sanchez
complains that an evidentiary hearing was mandatory under TEX.R.CIV.P.

18a once the recusal motion was referred to the administrative judge. We
agree... We hold that is not the situation here, as Guadalupe Sanchez's
motion to recuse set out with particularity her assertions as to why the
judge before whom the case was pending could not perform as a neutral,
unbiased judge... For these reasons, we are compelled to hold that the
administrative judge of the Sixth Judicial Region erred in refusing to hold an
evidentiary hearing on the allegations urged in Guadalupe Sanchez's motion
to recuse.
Summary
The Texas Court of Appeals found a procedural error in the handling of a
recusal motion. The court emphasized the mandatory nature of holding an
evidentiary hearing once a recusal motion is filed and referred to an
administrative judge. The failure to hold such a hearing was deemed an
error, highlighting the importance of procedural compliance to ensure
impartiality and fairness in judicial proceedings.
Duffey v. State, 428 S.W.3d 319 (Tex. App. 2014)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
A motion to recuse a judge 'must assert one or more of the grounds listed in
Rule 18b.' Tex.R. Civ. P. 18a(a)(2). Among other things, a judge must be
recused in any proceeding in which 'the judge's impartiality might
reasonably be questioned,' Tex.R. Civ. P. 18b(b)(1), or the judge 'has a
personal bias or prejudice concerning the subject matter or a party; ... [or]
personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts concerning the
proceedings,' Tex.R. Civ. P. 18b(b)(2). A motion to recuse seeks to prevent a
judge from hearing a case because of a nonconstitutional reason. Even if a
motion to recuse is procedurally defective, he must refer the motion so
another judge can determine the merits of the motion to recuse if the judge
does not then voluntarily recuse himself.
Summary
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a mandates specific procedures for the
recusal of judges, including the requirement that a judge must recuse
themselves or refer the motion to another judge if their impartiality might
reasonably be questioned. This ensures that the process is handled
impartially and without undue influence from the judge facing recusal. The
involvement of a court coordinator, who serves at the pleasure of the judge,
in the recusal process could undermine the impartiality and integrity of the
process. Additionally, denying motions that were never filed contradicts the
procedural requirements and could indicate a deeper issue of judicial
misconduct or procedural irregularity.

State v. Volkswagen Aktiengesellschaft, 692 S.W.3d 467 (Tex. 2022)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
The grounds for disqualification and recusal under Texas law are set out in
Rule of Civil Procedure 18b. Relevant to this case, Rule 18b requires a judge
to recuse if 'the judge’s impartiality might reasonably be questioned' or 'the
judge has a personal bias or prejudice concerning the subject matter or a
party.' Tex. R. Civ. P. 18b(b)(1), (2); see Tex. R. App. P. 16.2 ('The grounds for
recusal of an appellate court justice or judge are the same as those provided
in the Rules of Civil Procedure.'). Canons 2 and 3 of the Code of Judicial
Conduct address these same issues. Titled 'Avoiding Impropriety and the
Appearance of Impropriety in All of the Judge’s Activities,' Canon 2 requires
that '[a] judge shall not allow any relationship to influence judicial conduct
or judgment.'
Summary
The Texas Rules of Civil Procedure and the Code of Judicial Conduct set
clear standards for when a judge must recuse themselves to avoid any
appearance of bias or impropriety. These rules are designed to maintain
public confidence in the judiciary's integrity and impartiality. The
involvement of a court coordinator in the recusal process and the denial of
motions that were never filed could undermine these standards, leading to a
significant breakdown in the justice system. If such actions are not
investigated and addressed, it could suggest a systemic issue that threatens
the judiciary's credibility.

Independence and Impartiality
Extract
A hearing officer presiding over a hearing shall have all powers necessary
and appropriate to conduct a full, fair, and impartial hearing. Hearing
officers shall remain independent and impartial in all matters regarding the
handling of any issues during the pendency of a case and in issuing their
written decisions. A hearing officer shall be disqualified if the hearing officer
has a personal interest in the outcome of the appeal or if the hearing officer
directly or indirectly participated in the determination or Board decision on
appeal. Any party may present facts to the Agency in support of a request to
disqualify a hearing officer. A hearing officer may withdraw from a hearing
to avoid the appearance of impropriety or partiality.

=== PAGE 25 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
The Texas Administrative Code mandates that hearing officers must conduct
hearings impartially and independently. They must disqualify themselves if
they have a personal interest in the case or have participated in the decision
being appealed. This ensures that the hearing process is fair and unbiased,
which is crucial for maintaining public confidence in the judicial system. The
involvement of a court coordinator in the recusal process and the denial of
motions that were never filed, as described in the question, could undermine
this impartiality and integrity, leading to a breakdown of justice.
40 Tex. Admin. Code § 101.913 40 Tex. Admin. Code § 101.913 Powers and
Duties of Impartial Hearing Officer
Extract
The impartial hearing officer has the authority and duty to: conduct a full
and impartial hearing; take action to avoid unnecessary delay in the
disposition of the proceeding; and maintain order.
Summary
Duties and powers of an impartial hearing officer, emphasizing the need for
impartiality, avoidance of unnecessary delays, and maintaining order during
proceedings. This is relevant to the question as it highlights the importance
of procedural integrity and impartiality in judicial processes. The
involvement of a court coordinator in the recusal process and the denial of
motions that were never filed, as described in the question, directly
contravene these principles. Such actions undermine the integrity of the
judicial process and could be seen as a significant breakdown of justice,
necessitating action by the judicial committee to uphold the standards of
impartiality and procedural fairness.
Tex. Gov't. Code § 25.00255 Tex. Gov't. Code § 25.00255 Recusal Or
Disqualification of Judge
Extract
A party in a case in any trial court other than a statutory probate court or
justice court may seek to recuse or disqualify a judge who is sitting in the
case by filing a motion with the clerk of the court in which the case is
pending. The motion: (1) must be verified; (2) must assert one or more of the
grounds listed in Rule 18b; (3) must not be based solely on the judge's ruling
in the case; and (4) must state with detail and particularity facts that: (A)
are within the affiant's personal knowledge, except that facts may be stated
on information and belief if the basis for that belief is specifically stated; (B)
would be admissible in evidence; and (C) if proven, would be sufficient to
justify recusal or disqualification.

=== PAGE 26 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
The process for recusal or disqualification of a judge is clearly defined and
must be initiated by a verified motion filed with the court clerk. The
involvement of a court coordinator, who serves at the pleasure of the judge,
in this process could undermine the neutrality and integrity of the recusal
process. Additionally, denying motions that were never filed contradicts the
procedural requirements outlined in Rule 18a, which could indicate a deeper
issue of judicial misconduct or procedural irregularity.
Tex. Gov't. Code § 74.102 Tex. Gov't. Code § 74.102 Duties
Extract
To promote uniform and efficient administration of justice in this state, the
court coordinators shall cooperate with regional presiding and local
administrative judges and state agencies having duties in the area of the
operation of the courts.
Summary
Court coordinators are expected to cooperate with judges and state agencies
to ensure the efficient administration of justice. This implies that their role is
supportive and administrative, rather than judicial. The involvement of a
court coordinator in the recusal process, especially when the judge they
serve is the subject of the recusal, could potentially compromise the
neutrality and integrity of the process. This is because the court coordinator
serves at the pleasure of the judge, which could lead to a conflict of interest
or the appearance of impropriety. The passage suggests that the duties of
court coordinators are meant to support the judicial process, not to
influence or interfere with it.

Judicial Conduct; Procedure
Extract
Any Justice or Judge of the courts established by this Constitution or created
by the Legislature as provided in Section 1, Article V, of this Constitution,
may, subject to the other provisions hereof, be removed from office for
willful or persistent violation of rules promulgated by the Supreme Court of
Texas, incompetence in performing the duties of the office, willful violation
of the Code of Judicial Conduct, or willful or persistent conduct that is
clearly inconsistent with the proper performance of his duties or casts public
discredit upon the judiciary or administration of justice.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
The Texas Constitution provides a mechanism for the removal or discipline
of judges who violate judicial rules or engage in conduct that discredits the
judiciary. This is relevant to the question because the involvement of a court
coordinator in the recusal process and the denial of motions that were never
filed could be seen as a willful violation of procedural rules and the Code of
Judicial Conduct. Such actions undermine the integrity of the judicial
process and could cast public discredit upon the judiciary. The judicial
committee, therefore, has a constitutional duty to investigate and address
these issues to maintain public confidence in the judiciary.
Tex. Gov't. Code § 22.221 Tex. Gov't. Code § 22.221 Writ Power
Extract
Each court of appeals or a justice of a court of appeals may issue a writ of
mandamus and all other writs necessary to enforce the jurisdiction of the
court.
Summary
The courts of appeals in Texas have the authority to issue writs of
mandamus to enforce their jurisdiction. This power is crucial in ensuring
that lower courts and judges comply with the law and procedural rules. The
involvement of a court coordinator in the recusal process and the denial of
motions that were never filed, as described in the question, could be seen as
a failure to adhere to mandatory procedural rules. This undermines the
integrity of the judicial process and could be considered a significant
breakdown of justice. The judicial committee must act to investigate and
address these issues to maintain public confidence in the judiciary and
ensure that the rule of law is upheld. Failure to act could be seen as
complicity in the breakdown of justice.

Or Recusal of Judges
Extract
A judge is subject to recusal or disqualification on the same grounds and
under the same circumstances as specified in TRCP Rule 18b. Motion. A
motion to recuse or disqualify a judge assigned to a case should: (A) be
made at the earliest practicable time; (B) be verified, if the motion is in
writing; (C) state with particularity the grounds for the motion; and (D) be
based on personal knowledge and include such facts as would be admissible
in evidence, except that facts may be stated on information and belief if the
basis for such belief is specifically stated.

=== PAGE 28 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
The procedures for recusal or disqualification of judges are clearly defined
and must be followed to ensure impartiality and fairness in judicial
proceedings. The involvement of a court coordinator in the recusal process,
especially when the judge they serve is the subject of the recusal, could
potentially compromise the neutrality and integrity of the process. This is
because the court coordinator serves at the pleasure of the judge, which
could lead to a conflict of interest or the appearance of impropriety.
Additionally, denying motions that were never filed contradicts the
procedural requirements outlined in Rule 18a, which could indicate a deeper
issue of judicial misconduct or procedural irregularity.
Tex. Gov't. Code § 33.022 Tex. Gov't. Code § 33.022 Investigations and
Formal Proceedings
Extract
The commission may conduct a preliminary investigation of the
circumstances surrounding an allegation or appearance of misconduct or
disability of a judge to determine if the allegation or appearance is
unfounded or frivolous. If, after conducting a preliminary investigation
under this section, the commission does not determine that an allegation or
appearance of misconduct or disability is unfounded or frivolous, the
commission shall: (A) conduct a full investigation of the circumstances
surrounding the allegation or appearance of misconduct or disability; and
(B) notify the judge in writing of: (i) the commencement of the investigation;
and (ii) the nature of the allegation or appearance of misconduct or
disability being investigated.
Summary
Procedural steps the Commission must take, including notifying the judge
and potentially ordering depositions or appearances. This ensures
accountability and integrity within the judiciary.
Tex. Gov't. Code § 33.002 Tex. Gov't. Code § 33.002 Commission
Extract
The State Commission on Judicial Conduct is established under Section 5 1-
a, Article V, Texas Constitution, and has the powers provided by that section.
The commission is an agency of the judicial branch of state government and
administers judicial discipline. The commission does not have the power or
authority of a court in this state.

Summary
The State Commission on Judicial Conduct is responsible for administering
judicial discipline in Texas. It is an agency of the judicial branch, established
by the Texas Constitution, and has the authority to investigate and discipline
judges for misconduct. However, it does not have the power or authority of a
court. This means that while the Commission can investigate and
recommend disciplinary actions, it cannot overturn court decisions or act as
a judicial body.

persistent conduct that is clearly inconsistent with the proper performance
of a judge's duties' includes: wilful, persistent, and unjustifiable failure to
timely execute the business of the court, considering the quantity and
complexity of the business; wilful violation of a provision of the Texas penal
statutes or the Code of Judicial Conduct; persistent or wilful violation of the
rules promulgated by the supreme court; incompetence in the performance
of the duties of the office; failure to cooperate with the commission; or
violation of any provision of a voluntary agreement to resign from judicial
office in lieu of disciplinary action by the commission.
Summary
Framework for understanding what constitutes judicial misconduct and the
responsibilities of the commission in addressing such issues.
Tex. Gov't. Code § 29.055 Tex. Gov't. Code § 29.055 Procedure Following
Filing of Motion; Recusal Or Disqualification Without Motion
Extract
Before further proceedings in a case in which a motion for the recusal or
disqualification of a municipal judge has been filed, the judge shall: recuse
or disqualify himself or herself; or request the regional presiding judge to
assign a judge to hear the motion.
Summary
The statute mandates specific actions for a judge when a motion for recusal
or disqualification is filed. The judge must either recuse themselves or
request the assignment of another judge. This ensures impartiality and
prevents any appearance of bias or impropriety. The involvement of a court
coordinator in the recusal process, especially when the judge they serve is

the subject of the recusal, could potentially compromise the neutrality and
integrity of the process. This is because the court coordinator serves at the
pleasure of the judge, which could lead to a conflict of interest or the
appearance of impropriety. The passage suggests that the duties of court
coordinators are meant to support the judicial process, not to influence or

EVALUATING JUDICIAL STANDARDS OF CONDUCT IN THE CURRENT
POLITICAL AND SOCIAL CLIMATE: THE NEED TO STRENGTHEN
IMPROPRIETY STANDARDS AND REMOVAL REMEDIES TO INCLUDE
PROCEDURAL JUSTICE AND COMMUNITY HARM.
Albany Law Review - Albany Law School - Kastenberg, Joshua E. -
2019-06-22
Extract
In Texas, the state judicial commission may censure a judge after a formal
proceeding, but it can only recommend removal to the state's highest court.
Moreover, the Texas judiciary has developed a jurisprudence that a
reprimand is assumed to have caused a judge to change his or her behavior,
and therefore should not ordinarily serve as the basis for recusal, thereby
giving the judge a clean slate.
Summary
The Texas judicial system has a limited mechanism for disciplining judges.
The state judicial commission can censure judges but can only recommend
removal to the state's highest court. Additionally, the jurisprudence in Texas
assumes that a reprimand is sufficient to change a judge's behavior, which
may not always be the case. This system could potentially allow judges to
continue engaging in misconduct without facing significant consequences,
leading to a breakdown of justice.
Pretrial Motions

Extract
A Texas judge may be removed from presiding over a case for one of three
reasons: he is constitutionally disqualified; he is subject to a statutory strike
(as in civil cases); or he is subject to statutory disqualification or recusal
under Texas Supreme Court rules. ... Rule 18b(2) of the Texas Rules of Civil
Procedure sets out the law concerning recusal and includes instances in
which a judge must step down from hearing a case for reasons other than
the disqualifying grounds listed in the constitution. Rule 18b(2) states, in

=== PAGE 31 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
relevant part, that a 'judge shall recuse himself in any proceeding in which:
(a) his impartiality might reasonably be questioned; [or] (b) ... Once a
sufficient motion to recuse has been filed, before proceeding further in the
case, the judge must either recuse himself or request the presiding judge of
the administrative judicial district to assign a judge to hear the motion
under Tex. Gov’t Code §74.059(c)(3).
Summary
The Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, specifically Rule 18b(2), mandate that a
judge must recuse themselves if their impartiality might reasonably be
questioned. This is a fundamental aspect of ensuring justice and maintaining
public confidence in the judiciary. The passage also highlights that once a
motion to recuse is filed, the judge must either recuse themselves or have
the motion heard by another judge. This ensures that the process is
impartial and that the judge whose impartiality is questioned does not
continue to act in the case. The involvement of a court coordinator, who
serves at the pleasure of the judge facing recusal, could undermine the
impartiality and integrity of the process. Additionally, denying motions that
were never filed contradicts the procedural requirements and could indicate
a deeper issue of judicial misconduct or procedural irregularity.
