Statement of the Case Nature of Underlying Proceeding: This original
proceeding arises from a divorce action, No. 322-744263-23, pending in the
322nd District Court of Tarrant County, Texas. The Relator initiated recusal
proceedings under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a, which remain
pending. The issues presented concern the improper handling of those
recusal procedures. Respondent Judge: The Respondent Judge, Honorable
David L. Evans, is the presiding Regional Judge of the 8 th Administrative
Judicial Region of Texas. Respondent’s Challenged Actions: The Respondent
erred when he overruled the Relator's objection requesting that the
mandatory procedures set forth in Rule 18a of the Texas Rules of Civil
Procedure be followed. Further, permitting a judge to file an order of
referral regarding a recusal motion where he was not named introduces
confusion and undermines the purpose of the rule, causes further delays,
and leaves the Relator without an adequate appellate remedy. 7 Statement
of Jurisdiction This Petition for Writ of Mandamus is properly filed in the
Supreme Court of Texas, which possesses original jurisdiction to issue writs
of mandamus against regional presiding judges pursuant to Article V,
Section 3 of the Texas Constitution and Texas Government Code § 22.002(a).
In contrast, the jurisdiction of intermediate appellate courts is governed by
Texas Government Code § 22.221, and the Legislature has not conferred
upon those courts the authority to issue writs of mandamus against regional
presiding judges. This original proceeding is properly presented to this
Honorable Court in the first instance due to the jurisdictional limitations of
the Second Court of Appeals and because three previously filed mandamus
proceedings—arising from the same case and naming the same parties—are
currently pending before this Court under cause numbers 25-0361, 25-0367,
and 25-0378. 8 Issues Presented Issue No. 1: Whether the Respondent
abused his discretion by delegating to a court coordinator duties that Texas
Rule of Civil Procedure 18a(e)(1) expressly assigns to the clerk during
recusal proceedings, leaving the Relator without an adequate appellate
remedy. Issue No. 2: Whether the Respondent further abused his discretion
by permitting a judge not subject to recusal to file an order of referral. 9
Statement of Facts “MR” in this section refers to the mandamus record filed
concurrently with this petition. “APP” refers to the mandamus appendix
attached hereto. On April 23, 2025, in the midst of three concurrent
mandamus proceedings in the Second Court of Appeals1 , the trial court
below, on its’ own initiative, and after several months of silence, sua sponte
moved to set the matter for final trial (MR 1-1.1). The same day, CHARLES
DUSTIN MYERS, (“the Relator”) filed notice with the Second Court of

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Appeals warning that more errors would likely be committed by the trial
court given this sudden decision to move to final trial (MR 2-2.1). The
Relator then objected in the trial court to this setting and reminded the
court that there were three concurrent mandamus proceedings pending in
the Second Court of Appeals (MR 3.1) and named six specific issues that
needed to be resolved before moving to final trial (MR 3.2). The following
day, the Second Court of Appeals issued a per curiam denial regarding
02-25-00166-CV, which is now before this court as cause number 25- 0361
(MR 4-4.1). The Relator then filed a Plea to the Jurisdiction directed to
Honorable James Munford and reiterated several key issues and questioned
the court’s jurisdiction and re-raised constitutional issues (MR 5-5.11). On
April 25, 2025, the Relator filed a Motion to Recuse in the 322nd District
Court seeking to 1 See cause numbers 02-25-00164-CV, 02-25-00166-CV,
02-25-00171-CV 10 recuse the Honorable James Munford (MR 6-6.21) to
protect his rights. The recusal included several exhibits, including the
Notice of Court Proceeding (MR 6.22- 6.24), the current temporary orders in
effect that claim consent yet lack the Relator’s signature (MR. 6.25-6.36),
the prior recusal denial (MR. 6.37-6.39), the agreement to reschedule the
prior recusal proceedings (MR. 6.40-6.44), the correspondence with the
court coordinator for the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County regarding
the un-opposed summary judgement motion filed on February 22, 2024, and
the reinstatement of the Honorable Judges from the prior recusal
proceedings (MR. 6.45-6.50), the initial ruling that divested the Relator of
his home, business, and children without findings (MR 6.51-6.53), and the
Associate Judge’s Report signed by the parties on February 1, 2024 (MR.
6.54-6.60) with specific procedural requirements. Following the submission
of his Motion to Recuse, the Relator received notice from the Real Party in
Interest, Morgan Michelle Myers, that their youngest child had sustained a
dental injury. In response, Relator notified the Second Court of Appeals (MR.
7–7.4) and submitted the same notice to the 322nd District Court, amending
the filing to correct a date reference (MR. 8–8.6). Three days later, Relator
filed a First Amended Motion to Recuse to include the medical event (MR. 9–
9.36) containing a case study (MR 9.54-9.91). He also 11 filed a Notice of
Non-Appearance and submitted an objection to the trial setting (MR. 10–
10.6). On April 29, 2025, letters from the District Judge and the Associate
Judge were filed (MR. 11; MR. 12). Each declined to recuse and referred the
matter to Judge David L. Evans of the 8th Administrative Judicial Region
(MR. 13; APP 3). Relator filed an Objection to the Recusal Procedure, stating
that the motion named only the District Judge and not the Associate Judge,
and challenged the inclusion of the latter and objected to the court
coordinator’s involvement (MR 14). Two days later, the Second Court of
Appeals entered denials in cause numbers 02-25-00166-CV and
02-25-00171-CV per curiam (MR. 15; MR. 16). These matters were then
docketed before this Court as cause numbers 25-0367 and 25-0378 on May
2, 2025, and May 7, 2025. On May 6, 2025, Honorable Judge Evans issued
an Order of Assignment still listing both Honorable Jeff Kaitcer and
Honorable James Munford as respondents (APP 2) and used the 322nd
District Court's coordinator to transmit documents, a method Relator
challenged as improper and filed a second objection (MR. 17). On May 15,
2025, Honorable Judge Evans issued an order denying the Relator’s
objections (APP 1), which led to the drafting of this petition for writ of
mandamus. 12 SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT Texas law assigns the court clerk

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
— not the challenged judge or his personal staff — the duty of transmitting
recusal materials. Rule 18a’s forwarding requirement is statutorily
designated to the clerk of the court where the motion was filed. Allowing a
judge’s court coordinator or personal assistant (a staff member appointed by
the judge) to carry out that delivery would depart from the neutral
procedure envisioned by the rule. A coordinator is a direct appointee of the
judge and serves at his pleasure; having such a person handle a motion
challenging the judge’s own authority undermines the independence of the
process. In other words, the clerk is a neutral custodian of court records,
whereas a coordinator is part of the judge’s office. In the recusal context, it
is far safer to use the clerk (or an independent deputy) to send the papers
on, so that no one can reasonably think the judge is influencing the referral.
Beyond the letter of Rule 18a, Texas’s Code of Judicial Conduct mandates
avoiding not only actual bias but any appearance of impropriety or partiality.
Canon 2(A) provides that a judge “should act at all times in a manner that
promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary”.
In practice this means even the perception of favoritism or undue influence
must be avoided. Here, the Respondent’s order overruling the Relator’s
objection has the opposite effect, constituting an abuse of discretion leaving
the Relator without an appellate remedy. 13 ARGUMENT A. Standard of
Review To obtain relief by writ of mandamus, a relator must establish that
an underlying order is void or a clear abuse of discretion and that no
adequate appellate remedy exists. Walker v. Packer, 827 S.W.2d 833, 839–40
(Tex.1992) (orig. proceeding). An abuse of discretion occurs when a trial
court's ruling is arbitrary and unreasonable, made without regard for
guiding legal principles or supporting evidence. Ford Motor Co. v. Garcia,
363 S.W.3d 573, 578 (Tex.2012). Similarly, a trial court abuses its discretion
when it fails to analyze or apply the law correctly. In re Sw. Bell Tel. Co., 226
S.W.3d 400, 403 (Tex.2007). The Relator submits that the Respondent clearly
abused his discretion by not following the mandatory procedural
requirements of Rule 18a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure which has
undermined the recusal process. B. Government Code § 74.102(b) Does Not
Excuse Noncompliance With Rule 18a The Court Administration Act,
Government Code Chapter 74, sets broad administrative standards but does
not repeal or override other laws. Section 74.102(a) provides that “by local
administrative rule” courts shall designate the duties of court coordinators.
More importantly, 74.101(b) specifies that each coordinator serves “at the
pleasure of the judge who appointed him.” Here, the 14 coordinator in
question serves at the pleasure of the judge subject to recusal. Texas law
implicitly assigns the court clerk — not the challenged judge or his personal
staff — the duty of transmitting recusal materials. Rule 18a’s forwarding
requirement is typically performed by the clerk of the court where the
motion was filed. Allowing a judge’s court coordinator or personal assistant
(a staff member appointed by the judge) to carry out that delivery would
depart from the neutral procedure envisioned by the rule. Because a
coordinator is a direct appointee of the judge and serves at his pleasure -
having such a person handle a motion challenging the judge’s own authority
undermines the independence of the process. In other words, the clerk is a
neutral custodian of court records, whereas a coordinator is part of the
judge’s office. In the recusal context, Rule 18a(e) specifically delineates
duties to the clerk of the court, not the coordinator. In the Respondent’s
order overruling the Relator’s objection, the invocation of 74.102(b) was

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
misplaced (APP 1.1). This section simply reinforces that court coordinators
must work smoothly with judges; it does not allow a coordinator or clerk to
disregard the clear instructions of Rule 18a. Nor does § 74.102(b) itself
confer discretion to the clerk that would override the rule’s requirements.
The only plausible understanding of Section 74.102(b) is that it calls for
cooperation in effectuating rules like 18a, not for deviation from them,
which is what occurred here. In Rio Grande Valley Gas Co., In re, 987 S.W.2d
167 (Tex. App. 1999), the 15 court explicitly stated that recusal motions
must be filed "with the clerk of the court." This further reinforces that the
clerk, not a court coordinator, is the proper recipient of recusal-related
filings. Likewise, in In re Amir-Sharif, NUMBER 13- 19-00573-CV (Tex. App.
Dec 12, 2019), the court stated that the respondent judge "must either: (A)
sign and file with the clerk an order of recusal or disqualification; or (B) sign
and file with the clerk an order referring the motion to the regional
presiding judge." This explicit reference to filing "with the clerk” is directly
supported by rule 18a(e). Here, deviation from these mandatory procedural
requirements has proven to be inefficient and have undermined the recusal
process itself in a case already fraught with procedural abnormalities. C.
The involvement of the coordinator in this instance has proven to be
inefficient and has undermined the integrity of the recusal process By
involving the court coordinator, the straightforward process of recusal has
become ambiguous. Rule 18a(c) of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure makes
clear that the judge’s obligation to address recusal arises only after a motion
is duly filed: the rule commands that if a party “raises a ground requiring
recusal,” then the judge “shall either recuse himself or request the presiding
judge” to take the motion. Here Judge Evans’ order overruling the Relator’s
objection to Honorable Jeff Kaitcer’s involvement but permitting the issue to
be discussed during the recusal proceedings is not only prejudicial, but it
will waste further judicial resources and cause further delay to the relief
being sought. A judge must base 16 decisions on what is actually in the
record. It is apparent on the face of the record and the motion to recuse that
Honorable Jeff Kaitcer was not named in the motion. This implies that the
motion was not properly reviewed, or the trial court is trying to create an
illusion of an adequate appellate remedy to thwart cause number 25- 0361
pending before this court. The only mention of any recusal regarding
Honorable Jeff Kaitcer in the current proceedings was a reference made to
the prior recusal proceedings initiated on October 7, 2024 (See MR.
9.19-9.20). Notably, the court coordinator was involved in those proceedings
as well, which ended up resulting in a four month delay that was only cured
by the Respondent’s diligence in reminding the coordinator that the judges
were not reinstated into the case while opposing parties remained inactive
throughout that critical delay. (MR 8.1) (emphasis added). In essence, the
Respondent’s invocation of 74.102(b) in the order overruling the Relator’s
objection, even if correct, would not effectuate its purpose of ensuring
“uniform and efficient administration of justice in this state” by involving the
court coordinator. Here, inconsistent proceedings have resulted from this
involvement, significant delays have occurred, and now the Relator faces
recusal proceedings wherein a Judge not named in the motion has
inappropriately implicated himself in the proceedings. This error could have
been easily resolved by vacating the order, but it instead has created
unnecessary ambiguity. 17 D. No triggering motion makes Honorable Jeff
Kaitcer’s Order of Referral Erroneous Under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
18a, no recusal procedure is triggered until a valid motion is filed. Once a
recusal motion is filed, the challenged judge must either recuse or
immediately forward the motion to the presiding judge. See In re Norman,
191 S.W.3d 858 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2006, orig. proceeding);
See also In re Stearman, 252 S.W.3d 113 (Tex. App.—Waco 2008, orig.
proceeding). Absent any motion, however, the judge has no authority to
initiate or refer a recusal proceeding. Here, the Relator's motion to recuse
did not seek recusal of Judge Kaitcer, yet the court overruled his objection to
his referral order. In doing so, the court ignored the Rule’s plain text: a
judge may “make no further orders and shall take no further action in the
case after filing of the motion and prior to a hearing on the motion”. Id. The
court’s suggestion that the assigned judge may nonetheless consider the
Relator's admitted non-filing only underscores the error – it treats an unfiled
motion as if it were pending. In re Norman is instructive: under Rule 18a a
judge has “no option” other than to recuse or refer when a motion is
pending. By contrast, here no motion to recuse has been filed regarding the
Associate Judge, so the Honorable Kaitcer’s referral was in error, and the
Respondent had no lawful basis to adjudicate it. For these reasons, the order
was plainly erroneous, and these actions have undermined the recusal
process which is intended to promote public confidence in the judiciary. 18
CONCLUSION In sum, the order overruling Relator’s objection reflects more
than a mere procedural disagreement—it constitutes a refusal to follow the
mandatory directives of Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a. Specifically,
18a(e) vests specific procedural duties in the clerk, not the court
coordinator. (emphasis added) The legislature’s choice of language was
deliberate: Rule 18a(e) assigns responsibility for receiving, managing, and
transmitting recusal motions exclusively to the clerk of the court. Nowhere
does it authorize a judge’s personal appointee—such as a court coordinator
—to assume or interfere with these statutory duties. Here, a motion was
ever filed to recuse Associate Judge Jeff Kaitcer. Yet despite the absence of a
triggering event, Judge Kaitcer issued a referral order under Rule 18a as
though a motion were pending. That referral had no lawful basis, and any
action taken in response—including the overruling of Relator’s objection—is
procedurally void. Rule 18a requires a motion before it imposes any duty or
limitation. Without such a filing, Judge Kaitcer lacked authority to refer the
case, and the assigned judge lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate a nonexistent
motion. By further permitting a judge-appointed coordinator to process
these materials, the trial court not only misapplied the Rule—it overlooked
its core purpose. A coordinator, who serves at the pleasure of the very judge
subject to recusal would arguably create the appearance of impartiality
when performing 19 duties designated to the clerk by statute. For all these
reasons, the trial court abused its discretion in overruling Relator’s
objection. Its order departs from both the plain language and the statutory
design of Rule 18a, introducing confusion, delay, and inconsistency into a
process meant to be clear and impartial. The order should be set aside, and
mandamus granted to preserve the integrity of Texas’s statutory recusal
framework. PRAYER FOR RELIEF WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED,
Relator respectfully prays that this Honorable Court: 1. Issue a writ of
mandamus directing the Respondent to vacate the Order dated May 15,
2025 and Order of Assignment dated May 6, 2025 to preserve the integrity
of the recusal proceedings; 2. Take judicial notice that this is the fourth
concurrent mandamus petition before this Honorable Court seeking

extraordinary relief and take the instant petition into consideration
regarding the adjudication of the other three mandamus petitions; 20 3.
Grant such other and further relief, whether at law or in equity, to which
Relator may be justly entitled, including all relief necessary to ensure
compliance with Rule 18a and the fair administration of justice. Respectfully

Dated May 6, 2025, and the Objection dated April 29, 2025 that were filed
Charles Dustin Myers in the above-entitled cause. Mr. Myers complains of
the court coordinator's involvement in the recusal process. A Court
Coordinator's duties include assisting the administrative judges. See Tex.
Gov't Code Ann. § 74.102(b) which provides as follows: To promote uniform
and efficient administration of justice in this state, the court coordinators
shall cooperate with regional presiding and local administrative judges and
state agencies having duties in the area of the operation of the courts. The
court coordinators and clerks work together to assist the trial judges and
the administrative judges. Only the judges, not the litigants, have the
authority to direct the activities of the court coordinators and clerks. Mr.
Myers' objections regarding the involvement are overruled. Mr. Myers also
objects to the referral by Judge Kaitcer of a motion to recuse (Kaitcer
recusal motion) to the undersigned. This objection is overruled. However,
the judge who hears 4 APP 1.1 the Kaitcer recusal motion may take into
consideration Mr. Myers' claim that he did not file a motion to recuse Judge
Kaitcer. The Court, having considered the objections is of the opinion that
the objections should be DENIED. IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the
Objection to Order of Assignment Dated May 6, 2025 and the Objection filed

the clerk of the court in which the case is pending. The motion: (1) must be
verified; (2) must assert one or more of the grounds listed in Rule 18b; (3)
must not be based solely on the judge's ruling in the case; and (4) must state
with detail and particularity facts that: (A) are within the affiant's personal
knowledge, except that facts may be stated on information and belief if the
basis for that belief is specifically stated; (B) would be admissible in
evidence; and (C) if proven, would be sufficient to justify recusal or
disqualification. (b)Time for Filing Motion. (1) Motion to Recuse. A motion to
recuse:(A) must be filed as soon as practicable after the movant knows of
the ground stated in the motion; and (B) must not be filed after the tenth day
before the date set for trial or other hearing unless, before that day, the
movant neither knew nor reasonably should have known: (i) that the judge
whose recusal is sought would preside at the trial or hearing; or (ii) that the
ground stated in the motion existed. (2) Motion to Disqualify. A motion to
disqualify should be filed as soon as practicable after the movant knows of
the ground stated in the motion. (c)Response to Motion. (1) By Another
Party. Any other party in the case may, but need not, file a response to the
motion. Any response must be filed before the motion is heard. (2) By the
Respondent Judge. The judge whose recusal or disqualification is sought
should not file a response to the motion. (d)Service of Motion or Response. A
party who files a motion or response must serve a copy on every other party.
The method of service must be the same as the method of filing. If possible.
(e)Duty of the Clerk. (1) Delivery of a Motion or Response. When a motion or
response is filed, the clerk of the court must immediately deliver a copy to
the respondent judge and to the presiding judge of the administrative

Answer (Texas)
Short response
Regional Presiding Judge David L. Evans did not properly administer the
recusal proceedings in accordance with Texas law by permitting a judge not
named in the recusal motion to file an order of referral, denying an objection
to this effect, and allowing the subject judge’s court coordinator to handle
recusal matters. The State Commission on Judicial Conduct should

=== PAGE 14 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
commence a preliminary investigation into whether these actions constitute
a willful or persistent violation of procedural rules or the Code of Judicial
Conduct.
Summary
The Texas Rules of Civil Procedure and binding case law establish a clear,
mandatory process for handling judicial recusal motions, which vests
specific duties in the judge named in the motion and the court clerk, not in
other judges or court coordinators. The actions taken in this case—allowing
a judge not named in the motion to refer the matter, denying objections to
this process, and involving a court coordinator in duties reserved for the
clerk—deviate from these requirements and raise concerns about
impartiality and the integrity of the recusal process.
Given the constitutional and statutory mandate for judges to comply with
procedural rules and maintain public confidence in the judiciary, these
deviations may amount to misconduct or incompetence under the Texas
Constitution and warrant a formal inquiry by the State Commission on
Judicial Conduct. The Commission should determine whether Judge Evans’s
actions reflect a willful or persistent violation of the law or the Code of
Judicial Conduct, or otherwise cast public discredit on the judiciary.
Background and Relevant Law
Legislative and Regulatory Framework
The Texas Constitution, Article V, Section 1-a, empowers the State
Commission on Judicial Conduct to investigate and, if necessary, sanction
judges for willful or persistent violations of rules promulgated by the
Supreme Court of Texas, incompetence, willful violation of the Code of
Judicial Conduct, or conduct that undermines the judiciary’s integrity or
public confidence (Tex. Const. art. 5 § 1-a). The Commission is authorized to
conduct preliminary and, if warranted, full investigations into allegations of
judicial misconduct (Tex. Gov't. Code § 33.022).
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a governs the recusal and disqualification of
judges. It provides that a party may seek recusal by filing a verified motion
with the clerk of the court in which the case is pending. The rule assigns the
following key duties:
The motion must be filed with the clerk, not with a judge or a court
coordinator (Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a(a), (e)).
Upon filing, the clerk must immediately deliver a copy to the
respondent judge and the regional presiding judge (Tex. R. Civ. P.
18a(e)).
The judge named in the motion must, within three business days, either
recuse themselves or refer the motion to the regional presiding judge
by filing an order with the clerk (Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a(f)(1)).
• 
• 
• 

=== PAGE 15 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
No further action may be taken in the case by the respondent judge
until the motion is resolved, except for good cause stated in writing
(Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a(f)(2)).
The Texas Government Code provides for the appointment and duties of
court coordinators, who serve at the pleasure of the appointing judge and
whose duties are set by local administrative rule (Tex. Gov't. Code §§ 74.101,
74.102). However, these provisions do not override the specific procedural
requirements of Rule 18a.
The Texas Code of Judicial Conduct, Canon 2(A), requires judges to act at all
times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and
impartiality of the judiciary.
Case Law
Texas appellate courts have consistently held that Rule 18a’s procedures are
mandatory and must be strictly followed:
The judge named in a recusal motion must either recuse or refer the
motion to the regional presiding judge; any other action is not
permitted (In re Gold, 04-25-00085-CV (Tex. App. May 07, 2025); In re
Burns; In re Norman, 191 S.W.3d 858 (Tex. App. 2006)).
The authority to assign a judge to hear a recusal motion is vested in the
regional presiding judge, not in other judges or court staff (In re Alpert,
276 S.W.3d 592 (Tex. App. 2008)).
Any order entered by a judge after a recusal motion is filed, other than
an order of recusal or referral, is void (Rio Grande Valley Gas Co., In re,
987 S.W.2d 167 (Tex. App. 1999)).
The clerk, not a court coordinator, is responsible for handling the
delivery of recusal motions and orders (In re Amir-Sharif, NUMBER
13-19-00573-CV (Tex. App. Dec 12, 2019)).
The Texas Supreme Court has emphasized that judges must comply with the
law and conduct themselves in a manner that maintains public confidence in
the judiciary (Thoma, In re, 873 S.W.2d 477 (Tex. 1994)).
Analysis
1. Permitting a Judge Not Named in the Motion to File an
Order of Referral
Rule 18a is explicit that only the judge who is the subject of a recusal motion
has the authority and duty to respond by either recusing or referring the
motion to the regional presiding judge. The rule does not contemplate or
authorize a judge not named in the motion to take any action in response to
a recusal motion (Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a(f)(1)). The case law confirms that the
process is strictly limited to the judge named in the motion (In re Norman,
191 S.W.3d 858 (Tex. App. 2006); In re Stearman, 252 S.W.3d 113 (Tex. App.
2008)).
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 

=== PAGE 16 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
In the present matter, the record indicates that Judge Evans permitted Judge
Kaitcer, who was not named in the operative recusal motion, to file an order
of referral. This is a clear deviation from the mandatory process. The courts
have held that any action outside the prescribed options is void (Rio Grande
Valley Gas Co., In re, 987 S.W.2d 167 (Tex. App. 1999)). Such a deviation
undermines the integrity of the recusal process and may constitute
incompetence or willful violation of procedural rules.
2. Denying an Objection to This Effect
When an objection is raised regarding a procedural irregularity in the
recusal process, the presiding judge is obligated to ensure strict compliance
with Rule 18a. Denying an objection that points out a clear procedural
violation—such as a judge not named in the motion acting on the motion—
perpetuates the error and may amount to a willful or persistent violation of
the rules (Tex. Const. art. 5 § 1-a).
3. Allowing the Subject Judge’s Court Coordinator to
Handle Recusal Matters
Rule 18a assigns the duty of receiving and transmitting recusal motions and
related orders to the clerk of the court, not to a court coordinator (Tex. R.
Civ. P. 18a(e)). The rationale is to ensure neutrality and avoid any
appearance of impropriety, as the clerk is an independent custodian of court
records, while a coordinator serves at the pleasure of the judge and is part
of the judge’s staff (In re Amir-Sharif, NUMBER 13-19-00573-CV (Tex. App.
Dec 12, 2019)). The involvement of a court coordinator in these duties,
especially in a recusal context, risks undermining public confidence in the
impartiality of the process and may violate Canon 2(A) of the Code of
Judicial Conduct.
The Texas Government Code provisions on court coordinators do not
override the specific requirements of Rule 18a. Section 74.102(b) merely
requires coordinators to cooperate with judges and agencies to promote
efficient administration, but it does not authorize them to assume duties
assigned by rule to the clerk (Tex. Gov't. Code § 74.102).
4. Implications for Judicial Conduct
The Texas Constitution and the Code of Judicial Conduct require judges to
comply with procedural rules and to avoid conduct that undermines public
confidence in the judiciary. Willful or persistent failure to follow mandatory
procedures, or conduct that creates an appearance of impropriety, may
constitute grounds for investigation and discipline by the State Commission
on Judicial Conduct (Tex. Const. art. 5 § 1-a; Thoma, In re, 873 S.W.2d 477
(Tex. 1994)).
In this case, the combination of permitting a judge not named in the motion
to act, denying a valid objection, and involving a court coordinator in duties
reserved for the clerk, collectively raise substantial questions about

=== PAGE 17 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
compliance with the law and the maintenance of public confidence in the
judiciary.
Exceptions and Caveats
It is possible that local administrative rules or unique factual circumstances
could, in theory, justify some involvement of a court coordinator in
ministerial tasks. However, the authorities provided make clear that the core
duties under Rule 18a—especially those relating to the handling and referral
of recusal motions—are nondelegable and must be performed by the
designated officials (the named judge and the clerk). No authority provided
supports the proposition that these duties may be assumed by a court
coordinator or by a judge not named in the motion.
No subsequent negative treatment of the controlling authorities has been
identified that would undermine their application to this scenario.
Conclusion
The actions of Regional Presiding Judge David L. Evans in permitting a
judge not named in the recusal motion to file an order of referral, denying
an objection to this process, and allowing the subject judge’s court
coordinator to handle recusal matters, are inconsistent with the mandatory
requirements of Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a and established case law.
These deviations raise serious concerns about compliance with procedural
rules and the maintenance of public confidence in the judiciary. The State
Commission on Judicial Conduct should initiate a preliminary investigation
to determine whether these actions constitute a willful or persistent
violation of the law or the Code of Judicial Conduct, or otherwise amount to
judicial misconduct or incompetence under the Texas Constitution.

Thoma, In re, 873 S.W.2d 477 (Tex. 1994)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
It is axiomatic that an independent and honorable judiciary is indispensable
to justice in our society. A judge should participate in establishing,
maintaining, and enforcing, and should observe high standards of conduct
so that the integrity and independence of the judiciary is preserved. See
TEXAS SUPREME COURT, CODE OF JUDICIAL CONDUCT, Canon 1,
Amended to April 1, 1988, reprinted at TEX.GOV'T CODE ANN., title 2, Subt.
G, Appendix B (Vernon 1988). A judge should respect and comply with the
law and should conduct himself or herself at all times in a manner that
promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary.
Id., Canon 2A.

Summary
Judges are expected to adhere to high standards of conduct to preserve the
integrity and independence of the judiciary. This includes respecting and
complying with the law and conducting themselves in a manner that
promotes public confidence in the judiciary's impartiality. The passage
highlights the importance of judges not allowing personal relationships or
other influences to affect their judicial conduct or judgment.
In re Burns
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
A respondent judge, within three business days after a motion to recuse is
filed, must sign and file with the clerk (1) an order of recusal or
disqualification; or (2) an order referring the motion to the regional
presiding judge. Tex.R.Civ.P. 18a(f). 'An order denying a motion to recuse
may be reviewed only for abuse of discretion on appeal from the final
judgment.' Tex.R.Civ.P. 18a(j)(1)(A). But 'mandamus relief is available when a
judge violates a mandatory statutory duty either to recuse or refer a motion
to recuse.'
Summary
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a mandates that a judge must either recuse
themselves or refer the motion to the regional presiding judge within three
business days of the filing of a recusal motion. The rule does not provide for
a judge not named in the motion to file an order of referral. Additionally, the
rule specifies that the clerk of the court, not a court coordinator, is
responsible for handling the delivery of recusal motions and orders.
Therefore, if Judge Evans allowed a judge not named in the motion to file an
order of referral and permitted a court coordinator to handle recusal
matters, it would be inconsistent with the procedural requirements of Rule
18a.
In re Norman, 191 S.W.3d 858 (Tex. App. 2006)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a, Judge Austin had a mandatory
duty either to recuse himself or to refer the recusal motion to the presiding
judge. TEX.R. CIV. P. 18a. Furthermore, section 74.059(c)(3) of the
Government Code states that a district, statutory probate, or statutory
county court judge shall 'request the presiding judge to assign another judge

=== PAGE 19 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
to hear a motion relating to the recusal of the judge from a case pending in
his court.' TEX. GOV'T CODE ANN. § 74.059(c)(3) (Vernon 2005). Judge
Austin did not have the option of denying the motion.
Summary
Under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a, a judge has a mandatory duty to
either recuse themselves or refer the recusal motion to the presiding judge.
The judge does not have the discretion to deny the motion themselves. This
is relevant to the question because it highlights the procedural requirements
that must be followed in recusal proceedings, which may have been violated
if a judge not named in the motion was allowed to file an order of referral or
if the court coordinator improperly handled recusal matters.
In re Alpert, 276 S.W.3d 592 (Tex. App. 2008)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Rule 18a(f) expressly confers the authority to reassign a case following a
recusal to the regional presiding judge of the administrative judicial
district... Both the Texas Government Code and Texas Rules of Civil
Procedure vest the 'presiding judge of the administrative judicial district'
with the authority to assign a judge to hear a motion for recusal. TEX. GOV'T
CODE ANN. § 25.00255; TEX.R. CIV. P. 18a.
Summary
The authority to reassign a case following a recusal is vested in the regional
presiding judge of the administrative judicial district, according to both the
Texas Rules of Civil Procedure and the Texas Government Code. This means
that any deviation from this procedure, such as allowing a judge not named
in the motion to file an order of referral or involving a court coordinator
inappropriately, would not align with the established legal framework.
Woodruff v. Wright, 51 S.W.3d 727 (Tex. App. 2001)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
When a motion to recuse has been filed, a judge must either recuse himself
or request the presiding administrative judge to assign another judge to
hear the motion. Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a(a),(c),(d). ... The Texas Rules of Civil
Procedure provide that a judge shall recuse himself in any proceeding in
which 'his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.' Tex. R. Civ. P. 18b(2)
(a).

=== PAGE 20 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a requires a judge to either recuse
themselves or refer the motion to the presiding administrative judge when a
motion to recuse is filed. The rule emphasizes the importance of impartiality
and the proper handling of recusal motions. The passage does not directly
address the involvement of a court coordinator or the issue of a judge not
named in the motion filing an order of referral, but it highlights the
procedural requirements and the importance of impartiality in recusal
proceedings.
In re Gold, 04-25-00085-CV (Tex. App. May 07, 2025)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a(f)(1) provides: 'Regardless of whether the
motion [to recuse] complies with this rule, the respondent judge, within
three business days after the motion is filed, must either: (A) sign and file
with the clerk an order of recusal or disqualification; or (B) sign and file with
the clerk an order referring the motion to the regional presiding judge.'
Tex.R.Civ.P. 18a(f)(1). Under the rule's clear terms, when a party files a
motion to recuse, the judge must either grant the motion or refer it to the
regional presiding judge. See id. Once Gold filed the motion to recuse,
respondent could not take further action other than signing an order of
recusal or an order referring the motion to the regional presiding judge.
Summary
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a(f)(1) mandates that a judge must either
recuse themselves or refer the motion to the regional presiding judge within
three business days of a recusal motion being filed. The rule does not
provide for any other actions by the judge, and any subsequent orders made
by the judge without following this procedure are considered void. This rule
is applicable to all Texas courts handling recusal motions.
In re Amir-Sharif, NUMBER 13-19-00573-CV (Tex. App. Dec 12, 2019)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a(f)(1) governs the duties of the respondent
judge when a party files a motion to recuse. See TEX. R. CIV. P. 18a(f)(1).
This rule states that: '[r]egardless of whether the motion complies with this
rule, the respondent judge, within three business days after the motion is
filed, must either: (A) sign and file with the clerk an order of recusal or

=== PAGE 21 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
disqualification; or (B) sign and file with the clerk an order referring the
motion to the regional presiding judge.' ... Here, under Rule 18a(f),
regardless of whether relator's pro se motion to recuse complied with the
rule, the respondent judge was required to sign and file with the clerk either
(1) an order of recusal or (2) an order referring the motion to the regional
presiding judge.
Summary
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a(f)(1) imposes a mandatory duty on the
respondent judge to either recuse themselves or refer the motion to the
regional presiding judge within three business days of the motion being
filed. This rule is applicable regardless of the compliance of the motion with
the rule. The passage does not directly address the issue of a judge not
named in the motion filing an order of referral or the involvement of a court
coordinator, but it emphasizes the mandatory nature of the judge's duties
under Rule 18a(f)(1).
In re Easton, 203 S.W.3d 438 (Tex. App. 2006)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
While a motion to recuse is pending, the legislature has provided that 'the
judge shall make no further orders and shall take no further action in the
case after filing of the motion and prior to a hearing on the motion.' TEX. R.
CIV. P. 18a(d).
Summary
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a(d) mandates that a judge must refrain
from taking any further action in a case once a motion to recuse is filed until
the motion is resolved. This rule is designed to ensure impartiality and
prevent any potential influence on the proceedings while the recusal motion
is under consideration.
In re Moore, NUMBER 13-19-00551-CV (Tex. App. Dec 19, 2019)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Further, the presiding judge of an administrative judicial region is
authorized to assign judges in the region to 'try cases and dispose of
accumulated business.' TEX. GOV'T CODE ANN. § 74.056(a), (b). A judge
sitting by order of assignment has 'all the powers of the judge of the court to
which he is assigned.' See id. § 74.059(a). Generally, visiting judges are

=== PAGE 22 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
assigned either to a particular case or for a specific period of time. Hull, 365
S.W.3d at 41; In re Republic Parking Sys., Inc., 60 S.W.3d 877, 879 (Tex. App.
—Houston [14th Dist.] 2001, orig. proceeding). The terms of the assignment
order control the extent of the assigned judge's authority and when that
authority terminates.
Summary
The presiding judge of an administrative judicial region has the authority to
assign judges to cases and that the terms of the assignment order control
the extent of the assigned judge's authority. This suggests that the presiding
judge has discretion in assigning judges, but the assignment must be in
accordance with the terms set forth in the order.
In re Stearman, 252 S.W.3d 113 (Tex. App. 2008)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Once a recusal motion is filed, a trial judge generally has two options: (1)
recuse himself/herself; or (2) forward the motion to the presiding judge and
request the assignment of another judge to hear the motion. See id. 18a(c),
(d); TEX. GOV'T CODE ANN. § 74.059(c)(3) (Vernon 2005); In re A.R., 236
S.W.3d 460, 477 (Tex.App.-Dallas 2007, no pet.); In re Norman, 191 S.W.3d
858, 860 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2006, orig. proceeding). However,
the judge may make 'further orders' while the recusal motion is pending 'for
good cause stated in the order.' TEX.R. CIV. P. 18a(d).
Summary
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a outlines specific procedures for handling
recusal motions. A judge must either recuse themselves or forward the
motion to the presiding judge for assignment. The rule also allows for
further orders to be made for good cause. The passage does not directly
address the involvement of a court coordinator or the filing of an order of
referral by a judge not named in the motion, but it emphasizes the
procedural requirements and limitations on actions a judge can take once a
recusal motion is filed.
Rio Grande Valley Gas Co., In re, 987 S.W.2d 167 (Tex. App. 1999)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
When a motion to recuse has been filed, a judge must either recuse him- or
herself or request the presiding administrative judge to assign another judge

to hear the motion. Wright v. Wright, 867 S.W.2d 807, 811 (Tex.App.--El Paso
1993, writ denied); Carson, 841 S.W.2d at 492-93; Lamberti, 776 S.W.2d at
652; Petitt v. Laware, 715 S.W.2d 688, 692 (Tex.App.--Houston [1st Dist.]
1986, writ ref'd. n.r.e.); Greenberg, 685 S.W.2d at 695. Any order other than
an order of recusal or referral, entered by a court after a proper motion to
recuse is entered is void.
Summary
When a motion to recuse is filed, the judge in question must either recuse
themselves or request the presiding administrative judge to assign another
judge to hear the motion. Any other order entered by the court after a
proper motion to recuse is filed is considered void. This suggests that the
involvement of a judge not named in the motion to file an order of referral,
as well as the handling of recusal matters by a court coordinator, may not
align with the proper procedure outlined in Texas law.
Tex. Const. art. 5 § 1-a Tex. Const. art. 5 § 1-a Retirement, Censure,
Removal, and Compensation of Justices and Judges; State Commission On
Judicial Conduct; Procedure
Extract
Any Justice or Judge of the courts established by this Constitution or created
by the Legislature as provided in Section 1, Article V, of this Constitution,
may, subject to the other provisions hereof, be removed from office for
willful or persistent violation of rules promulgated by the Supreme Court of
Texas, incompetence in performing the duties of the office, willful violation
of the Code of Judicial Conduct, or willful or persistent conduct that is
clearly inconsistent with the proper performance of his duties or casts public
discredit upon the judiciary or administration of justice.
Summary
The State Commission on Judicial Conduct has the authority to investigate
and potentially remove a judge from office for willful or persistent violation
of rules, incompetence, or conduct that discredits the judiciary. This is
relevant to the question as it provides the basis for investigating whether
Judge Evans' actions in the recusal proceedings could be considered a
violation of judicial conduct rules or incompetence.
Tex. Gov't. Code § 33.022 Tex. Gov't. Code § 33.022 Investigations and
Formal Proceedings
Extract
The commission may conduct a preliminary investigation of the
circumstances surrounding an allegation or appearance of misconduct or

=== PAGE 24 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
disability of a judge to determine if the allegation or appearance is
unfounded or frivolous. If, after conducting a preliminary investigation
under this section, the commission does not determine that an allegation or
appearance of misconduct or disability is unfounded or frivolous, the
commission shall: (A) conduct a full investigation of the circumstances
surrounding the allegation or appearance of misconduct or disability; and
(B) notify the judge in writing of: (i) the commencement of the investigation;
and (ii) the nature of the allegation or appearance of misconduct or
disability being investigated.
Summary
The State Commission on Judicial Conduct has the authority to conduct
preliminary investigations into allegations of judicial misconduct. If the
commission finds that the allegations are not unfounded or frivolous, it is
required to conduct a full investigation and notify the judge involved. This
process ensures that any potential misconduct is thoroughly examined and
that the judge is informed of the investigation and the nature of the
allegations.
