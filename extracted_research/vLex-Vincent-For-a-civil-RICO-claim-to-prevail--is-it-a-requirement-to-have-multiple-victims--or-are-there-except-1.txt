Question
For a civil RICO claim to prevail, is it a requirement to have multiple victims,
or are there exceptions or caveats to this requirement?
Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
Multiple victims are not a statutory requirement for a civil RICO claim to
prevail, though some circuit courts consider the presence of a single victim
to be a factor potentially weighing against finding the necessary "pattern of
racketeering activity." Courts may be less likely to find a valid RICO claim
when there is only one victim in combination with other limiting factors such
as a single scheme of narrow scope or limited duration.
Summary
Civil RICO claims under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c) provide a private right of action
to "[a]ny person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation"
of the substantive RICO prohibitions in § 1962. The statutory elements of a
civil RICO claim focus on the pattern of racketeering activity, the presence
of an enterprise, and injury to the plaintiff's business or property—not on the
number of victims. While the statute itself does not require multiple victims,
judicial interpretations, particularly regarding the "pattern" element, have
sometimes considered the presence of only a single victim as a factor
weighing against finding the necessary continuity.
Circuit courts have developed varying approaches to this issue, with some
circuits (particularly the Second and Sixth Circuits) frequently finding that a
"single scheme with a single victim" is insufficient to establish a pattern of
racketeering activity, especially when combined with other limiting factors
like narrow scope or limited duration. However, this is not a universal rule,
and other factors—such as the number of predicate acts, the duration of
activity, and whether it poses a threat of continuing criminal activity—are
often more determinative than victim count alone. The Supreme Court has
focused on the "continuity plus relationship" test rather than victim count
when analyzing the pattern requirement.
Background and Relevant Law
Statutory Framework
The civil RICO statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c), establishes a private cause of
action for RICO violations. As stated in Bridge v. Phoenix Bond & Indem. Co.,
553 U.S. on 639, 128 S.Ct. 2131 (2008): "The Racketeer Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO or Act), 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961–1968, provides a

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
private right of action for treble damages to '[a]ny person injured in his
business or property by reason of a violation' of the Act's criminal
prohibitions. § 1964(c)."
Similarly, Portionpac Chemical Corp. v. Sanitech Systems, 217 F.Supp.2d
1238 (M.D. Fla. 2002) confirms: "RICO establishes both criminal and civil
penalties for violations of Section 1962. The civil remedies provision
provides a private cause of action for 'any person injured in his business or
property by reason of a violation of Section 1962.' 18 U.S.C. § 1961(c)."
The statutory text does not specify a requirement for multiple victims.
Instead, it focuses on the injury to the plaintiff's business or property caused
by a violation of the RICO provisions.
Elements of a Civil RICO Claim
To establish a civil RICO claim, a plaintiff must prove several elements, none
of which explicitly require multiple victims. As outlined in Studco Bldg. Sys.
U.S., LLC v. 1st Advantage Fed. Credit Union, 509 F.Supp.3d 560 (E.D. Va.
2020): "Generally, the elements of a civil Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act (RICO) claim are (1) a person, (2) an enterprise, (3) a
pattern of (4) racketeering activity (5) which causes injury to the plaintiff. 18
U.S.C.A. § 1962 (a, c)."
This formulation of the elements is consistent across jurisdictions. For
instance, in Little v. City of Valley (M.D. Ala. 2023), the court stated: "Thus,
in order to establish a federal civil RICO violation under § 1962(c), the
Plaintiffs 'must satisfy four elements of proof: (1) conduct (2) of an
enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity.'" (quoting Jones
v. Childers, 18 F.3d 899, 900 (11th Cir. 1994)).
Similarly, Sundquist v. Hultquist, Cause No. 1:20-CV-275-HAB (N.D. Ind. Sep
09, 2020) notes: "Accordingly, to state a claim for a RICO violation, a
plaintiff must allege a cognizable injury to its business or property resulting
from the '(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of
racketeering activity.'"
The "Pattern" Requirement and Continuity
The element most relevant to the multiple victims question is the "pattern of
racketeering activity" requirement. The U.S. Supreme Court has elaborated
on this element in several cases.
In United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 101 S.Ct. 2524 (1981), the Court
explained: "In order to secure a conviction under RICO, the Government
must prove both the existence of an 'enterprise' and the connected 'pattern
of racketeering activity.' The enterprise is an entity, for present purposes a
group of persons associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a
course of conduct. The pattern of racketeering activity is, on the other hand,
a series of criminal acts as defined by the statute. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1) (1976
ed., Supp. III)." It should be noted that Turkette was later abrogated by

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
United States v. Lane, 474 U.S. 438 (1986), but not on grounds relevant to
this particular discussion of RICO elements.
The Supreme Court further refined the "pattern" requirement in H.J. Inc v.
Northwestern Bell Telephone Company, 492 U.S. 229, 109 S.Ct. 2893 (1989):
"RICO's legislative history tells us, however, that the relatedness of
racketeering activities is not alone enough to satisfy § 1962's pattern
element. To establish a RICO pattern it must also be shown that the
predicates themselves amount to, or that they otherwise constitute a threat
of, continuing racketeering activity." This established what became known as
the "continuity plus relationship" test for the pattern element.
The "continuity" aspect is particularly relevant to the multiple victims
question. H.J. Inc. continues: "It is this aspect of RICO's pattern element that
has spawned the 'multiple scheme' test adopted by some lower courts,
including the Court of Appeals in this case. See 829 F.2d, at 650 ('In order to
demonstrate the necessary continuity appellants must allege that
Northwestern Bell "had engaged in similar endeavors in the past or that [it
was] engaged in other criminal activities."... A single fraudulent effort or
scheme is insufficient')."
While H.J. Inc. discussed the "multiple scheme" test, it did not explicitly
address whether multiple victims are required. However, lower courts have
often considered the presence of a single victim as one factor in analyzing
whether the necessary continuity exists.
Circuit Court Interpretations Regarding
Multiple Victims
Second Circuit Approach
The Second Circuit has developed an approach where the presence of a
single victim, combined with other limiting factors, often weighs against
finding a RICO pattern. This is illustrated in Kerwick v. Pullman & Comley
LLC, 3:24-CV-00427 (KAD) (D. Conn. Dec 20, 2024): "'[C]ourts in this Circuit
have repeatedly held that a plaintiff has not alleged a RICO violation where
he or she has pled only a single scheme of a narrow scope, including one
victim and a limited number of participants.' Maguire v. Ameriprise Fin.
Servs., LLC, No. 3:22-CV-128 (VAB), 2022 WL 1718038, at *10 (D. Conn.
May 27, 2022) (quotation omitted) (collecting cases)."
In Kerwick, the court dismissed the RICO claim, noting: "Plaintiff alleges
that Defendants' scheme targeted only her, and it was focused on 'coercively
controlling' her. This type of narrow, limited scheme is insufficient to
establish a pattern of racketeering activity."
Sixth Circuit Approach
The Sixth Circuit has taken a similar approach, as demonstrated in Grubbs v.
Sheakley Grp., Inc., 807 F.3d 785 (6th Cir. 2015). The court noted: "The
court below dismissed both the substantive RICO claim and the RICO

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
conspiracy claim on the ground that Plaintiffs failed to plead either closed—
or open-ended continuity: the alleged racketeering acts of mail and wire
fraud occurred within an eight-month period in pursuance of a single
scheme with a single victim, and Plaintiffs pled no facts indicating that the
alleged acts of racketeering activity would continue into the future."
The Grubbs court further explained: "The Sheakley Defendants also argue
that the alleged activity was a single, terminable scheme with only one
victim that was, by nature, not open-ended. See Moon, 465 F.3d at 725 (no
RICO liability where defendant had 'single objective' and there were 'no
facts suggesting that the scheme would continue beyond the [d]efendants
accomplishing their goal'); Vemco, 23 F.3d at 134 (no RICO liability where
there was a 'single victim and a single scheme for a single purpose')."
Eleventh Circuit Approach
The Eleventh Circuit has taken a more nuanced approach, as seen in Jones
(Gordon, Laura) v. Childers (John H.), Talent Services, Inc., 18 F.3d 899
(11th Cir. 1994). Citing the Third Circuit's decision in Banks v. Wolk, the
court noted: "The Third Circuit, in Banks v. Wolk, 918 F.2d 418 (3d Cir.1990),
has noted that the fact that a RICO plaintiff was not a victim of the
additional frauds alleged as predicate acts should not carry much weight.
The reference to 'similar victims' in H.J., Inc. cannot be read to require that
a plaintiff be injured by more than one predicate act...."
This suggests that the Eleventh Circuit views the victim count as less
determinative than the overall pattern of activity.
Ninth Circuit Approach
The Ninth Circuit has suggested that having multiple victims helps establish
a pattern, without definitively requiring it. In United Energy Owners
Committee, Inc. v. U.S. Energy Management Systems, Inc., 837 F.2d 356 (9th
Cir. 1988), the court stated: "Nevertheless, we held that a plaintiff properly
pleads a RICO pattern where it alleges multiple predicate acts against
multiple victims over a significant period of time (five months) since that
clearly satisfies RICO's requirement of 'two or more acts of racketeering
activity.'"
This language suggests that multiple victims can help satisfy the pattern
requirement, but it does not necessarily establish multiple victims as an
absolute requirement.
Tenth Circuit Approach
The Tenth Circuit has taken a more liberal approach to RICO requirements
in general, as seen in Plains Resources, Inc. v. Gable, 782 F.2d 883 (10th Cir.
1986): "We disagree with the view that, to state such a RICO claim, a
plaintiff must allege and prove that the conduct described as 'racketeering
activity' is connected to criminal conduct of an organized nature. We are
persuaded by the opinions which have held that there is no such
requirement in a civil setting... If the defendant engages in a pattern of

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
racketeering activity in a manner forbidden by [Secs. 1962(a)-(c)], and the
racketeering activities injure the plaintiff in his business or property, the
plaintiff has a claim under Sec. 1964(c). There is no room in the statutory
language for an additional, amorphous 'racketeering injury' requirement."
This approach suggests that the Tenth Circuit would be less likely to impose
extra-statutory requirements like multiple victims.
Analysis of the Multiple Victims Requirement
Based on the authorities reviewed, multiple victims are not a statutory
requirement for a civil RICO claim to prevail. The civil RICO statute, 18
U.S.C. § 1964(c), provides a cause of action to "any person" injured in
business or property by a RICO violation, without specifying that there must
be multiple victims.
The key secondary source, Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy (2024), confirms:
"A plaintiff only has standing to sue if they have been injured in their
business or property by conduct constituting the violation. To establish a §
1962(c) RICO claim, the following elements must be proven: ... • Injury: An
injury to business or property due to the racketeering activity." Similarly, 
PAYORS, PLAYERS, AND PROXIMATE CAUSE (2022) notes: "A private civil
right of action in [section] 1964 provides that '[a]ny person injured in his
business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962... may sue.'"
However, judicial interpretation, particularly regarding the "pattern of
racketeering activity" element, has sometimes treated the presence of only a
single victim as a factor weighing against finding the necessary continuity.
This is not a universal rule but varies by circuit and is typically considered
alongside other factors.
The Role of Victim Count in Pattern Analysis
The presence of multiple victims often helps demonstrate the "continuity"
aspect of the "continuity plus relationship" test established by the Supreme
Court in H.J. Inc. When a scheme involves only a single victim, courts may
scrutinize more closely whether the activity demonstrates sufficient
continuity to constitute a pattern.
This is exemplified in the Second Circuit's approach, as seen in Kerwick,
where the court dismissed a RICO claim that alleged "a single scheme of a
narrow scope, including one victim and a limited number of participants."
Similarly, the Sixth Circuit in Grubbs noted that "a single victim and a single
scheme for a single purpose" could weigh against finding RICO liability.
However, the determinative factor is not necessarily the victim count alone,
but rather whether the alleged activity demonstrates the necessary
continuity. A scheme targeting a single victim could potentially constitute a
pattern of racketeering activity if it involves multiple predicate acts over an
extended period and demonstrates a threat of continued criminal activity.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Factors Beyond Victim Count
Courts consider several factors beyond victim count when analyzing
whether a pattern of racketeering activity exists:
Number and variety of predicate acts: More numerous and diverse
predicate acts may support finding a pattern even with a single victim.
Duration of activity: Longer-lasting schemes are more likely to
constitute a pattern, regardless of victim count.
Threat of continued criminal activity: If the activity poses a threat
of continuing, it may constitute a pattern even with a single victim.
Scope and complexity of the scheme: More complex and broader
schemes may support finding a pattern despite having only one victim.
As stated in Studco Bldg. Sys. U.S., LLC v. 1st Advantage Fed. Credit Union,
509 F.Supp.3d 560 (E.D. Va. 2020): "For a pattern of racketeering activity to
exist, 'two or more predicate acts of racketeering must have been committed
within a ten-year period.'... Consequently, 'simply proving two or more
predicate acts is insufficient for a RICO plaintiff to succeed.'... Instead, 'a
plaintiff ... must show that the racketeering predicates are related, and that
they amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity.'"
Exceptions and Caveats
Circuit Splits and Varying Approaches
There is no uniform national standard regarding the weight given to victim
count in RICO pattern analysis. As demonstrated above, different circuits
have developed different approaches:
The Second and Sixth Circuits often find that a single victim combined
with a single scheme of narrow scope is insufficient for a RICO pattern.
The Eleventh Circuit, citing the Third Circuit, has suggested that victim
count should not "carry much weight" in the analysis.
The Ninth Circuit has indicated that multiple victims help establish a
pattern but has not clearly established this as a requirement.
The Tenth Circuit has generally rejected extra-statutory requirements
for RICO claims.
Given these varying approaches, the importance of victim count depends
significantly on the jurisdiction where the claim is brought.
The Single Scheme Exception
Several courts have found that a "single scheme" targeting a single victim
may be insufficient to establish a pattern of racketeering activity. However,
this is not an absolute rule but rather a factor in the overall continuity
analysis.

In Grubbs v. Sheakley Grp., Inc., 807 F.3d 785 (6th Cir. 2015), the court
noted exceptions to this general principle: "The court below dismissed both
the substantive RICO claim and the RICO conspiracy claim on the ground
that Plaintiffs failed to plead either closed—or open-ended continuity: the
alleged racketeering acts of mail and wire fraud occurred within an eight-
month period in pursuance of a single scheme with a single victim, and
Plaintiffs pled no facts indicating that the alleged acts of racketeering
activity would continue into the future."
This suggests that a single scheme with a single victim might still support a
RICO claim if it demonstrated either closed-ended continuity (sufficient
duration and scope despite being completed) or open-ended continuity (a
threat of continued criminal activity).
Standing Considerations
Some courts have historically attempted to limit RICO standing through
various doctrines, but such limitations have often been rejected. As noted in 
Callan v. State Chemical Mfg. Co., 584 F.Supp. 619 (E.D. Pa. 1984): "The
defendant first asserts that the plaintiffs have no standing to bring a claim
pursuant to § 1964(c). It asserts that the plaintiffs are not within the class of
persons on whose behalf RICO's civil damages were intended. In essence,
the defendant urges an interpretation of § 1964(c) that limits access to
treble damages under RICO to those who have suffered some sort of
'competitive' injury."
The court rejected this limitation, stating: "This position is not without
judicial support... The statute was conceived not as a shield for those
injured, but rather as a sword to be used against organized crime. For that
reason, prohibiting the plaintiffs from pursuing their RICO claims because
they do not fit into that class of plaintiffs that may be said to have suffered a
'competitive injury,' would not seem in any way to promote RICO's remedial
purposes."
This reasoning suggests that courts should be cautious about imposing
extra-statutory limitations on RICO standing, which could include
requirements for multiple victims.
Conclusion
Based on the statutory text and case law, multiple victims are not an
absolute requirement for a civil RICO claim to prevail. The civil RICO
statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c), provides a private right of action to "[a]ny
person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation" of the
substantive RICO prohibitions, without specifying a requirement for multiple
victims.
However, judicial interpretations, particularly regarding the "pattern of
racketeering activity" element, have sometimes treated the presence of only
a single victim as a factor weighing against finding the necessary continuity,

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
especially when combined with other limiting factors such as a single
scheme of narrow scope or limited duration.
The determinative factor is not necessarily the victim count alone, but rather
whether the alleged activity demonstrates sufficient "continuity and
relationship" to constitute a pattern of racketeering activity. Courts consider
several factors beyond victim count, including the number and variety of
predicate acts, the duration of activity, the threat of continued criminal
activity, and the scope and complexity of the scheme.
Different circuits have developed varying approaches to this issue, with
some (particularly the Second and Sixth Circuits) giving significant weight
to victim count in their analysis, while others (such as the Eleventh and
Tenth Circuits) treat it as less determinative.
In practice, a civil RICO claim with a single victim may face greater scrutiny
and potential challenges in some jurisdictions, particularly if the alleged
scheme is also narrow in scope, limited in duration, or lacks other indicia of
the necessary continuity. However, such a claim is not categorically barred
by the statute itself, and with sufficient showing of other factors
demonstrating a pattern of racketeering activity, it could potentially prevail.
In conclusion, while multiple victims are not statutorily required for a civil
RICO claim to prevail, the presence of a single victim may make it more
challenging to establish the necessary "pattern of racketeering activity" in
some jurisdictions, particularly when combined with other limiting factors.
The weight given to victim count varies by circuit and should be considered
alongside other factors in the overall continuity analysis.

(1981)
U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
In order to secure a conviction under RICO, the Government must prove
both the existence of an 'enterprise' and the connected 'pattern of

group of persons associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a
course of conduct. The pattern of racketeering activity is, on the other hand,
a series of criminal acts as defined by the statute. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1) (1976
ed., Supp. III). The former is proved by evidence of an ongoing organization,
formal or informal, and by evidence that the various associates function as a
continuing unit. The latter is proved by evidence of the requisite number of
acts of racketeering committed by the participants in the enterprise.

Summary
The passage from the United States v. Turkette case clarifies that for a RICO
claim, the focus is on proving the existence of an "enterprise" and a "pattern
of racketeering activity." It does not specify a requirement for multiple
victims. Instead, it emphasizes the need for a series of criminal acts and an
ongoing organization. This suggests that the presence of multiple victims is
not a necessary condition for a RICO claim to prevail.

U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
RICO makes it 'unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any
enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign
commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of
such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.' 18 U.S.C.
§ 1962(c) (emphasis added).
Summary
The passage from the Boyle v. United States case provides insight into the
requirements for a RICO claim. It emphasizes the unlawful conduct of
participating in an enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering
activity. The statute does not explicitly require multiple victims for a RICO
claim to prevail. Instead, it focuses on the pattern of racketeering activity
and the involvement in an enterprise affecting commerce. This suggests that
the presence of multiple victims is not a statutory requirement for a civil
RICO claim.

Summary
The passage from the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Bridge v. Phoenix
Bond & Indem. Co. clarifies that under the RICO Act, a private right of
action is available to "any person injured in his business or property" due to
a violation of the Act's criminal prohibitions. This indicates that the statute
does not require multiple victims for a civil RICO claim to prevail. Instead, it
focuses on whether the plaintiff has suffered an injury to business or
property due to a RICO violation. Therefore, the presence of multiple victims
is not a statutory requirement for a civil RICO claim.

106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989)
U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
RICO's legislative history tells us, however, that the relatedness of
racketeering activities is not alone enough to satisfy § 1962's pattern
element. To establish a RICO pattern it must also be shown that the
predicates themselves amount to, or that they otherwise constitute a threat
of, continuing racketeering activity. As to this continuity requirement, §
3575(e) is of no assistance. It is this aspect of RICO's pattern element that
has spawned the 'multiple scheme' test adopted by some lower courts,
including the Court of Appeals in this case. See 829 F.2d, at 650 ('In order to
demonstrate the necessary continuity appellants must allege that
Northwestern Bell 'had engaged in similar endeavors in the past or that [it
was] engaged in other criminal activities.'... A single fraudulent effort or
scheme is insufficient').
Summary
For a RICO claim, the pattern of racketeering activity must show continuity
and relatedness. The "multiple scheme" test mentioned suggests that a
single fraudulent effort or scheme is insufficient, implying that multiple
schemes or a threat of ongoing activity is necessary. However, the passage
does not explicitly state that multiple victims are required, only that there
must be a pattern of activity that suggests continuity.

Extract
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C.
§§ 1961-1968, which is directed at 'racketeering activity'—defined in §
1961(1) to encompass, inter alia, acts 'indictable' under specific federal
criminal provisions, including mail and wire fraud—provides in § 1964(c) for
a private civil action to recover treble damages by any person injured in his
business or property 'by reason of a violation of section 1962.' Section
1962(c) prohibits conducting or participating in the conduct of an enterprise
'through a pattern of racketeering activity.'
Summary
The passage from the Supreme Court case clarifies that a civil RICO claim
can be brought by any person injured in their business or property due to a
violation of section 1962. It does not specify that there must be multiple
victims for a claim to prevail. Instead, it focuses on the injury to the
claimant's business or property due to a pattern of racketeering activity.
This suggests that a single victim can bring a civil RICO claim if they meet
the criteria outlined in the statute.

Summary
Elements necessary to state a claim for a RICO violation, which includes
conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity resulting

are met.

Extract
The defendant first asserts that the plaintiffs have no standing to bring a
claim pursuant to § 1964(c). It asserts that the plaintiffs are not within the
class of persons on whose behalf RICO's civil damages were intended. In
essence, the defendant urges an interpretation of § 1964(c) that limits
access to treble damages under RICO to those who have suffered some sort
of 'competitive' injury. More specifically, the defendant argues that civil
RICO is limited to the owners, customers, or competitors of business
infiltrated by organized crime. This position is not without judicial support...
The statute was conceived not as a shield for those injured, but rather as a
sword to be used against organized crime. For that reason, prohibiting the
plaintiffs from pursuing their RICO claims because they do not fit into that
class of plaintiffs that may be said to have suffered a 'competitive injury,'
would not seem in any way to promote RICO's remedial purposes.
Summary
Standing requirements for a civil RICO claim under § 1964(c). It highlights
that the statute is intended as a tool against organized crime rather than
solely as a remedy for those injured. The court rejects the notion that only
those who have suffered a "competitive injury" have standing, suggesting
that the scope of potential plaintiffs is broader. This implies that having
multiple victims is not a strict requirement for a civil RICO claim, as the
focus is on the eradication of organized crime rather than the number of
victims.

U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
We disagree with the view that, to state such a RICO claim, a plaintiff must
allege and prove that the conduct described as 'racketeering activity' is
connected to criminal conduct of an organized nature. We are persuaded by
the opinions which have held that there is no such requirement in a civil
setting... If the defendant engages in a pattern of racketeering activity in a
manner forbidden by [Secs. 1962(a)-(c) ], and the racketeering activities
injure the plaintiff in his business or property, the plaintiff has a claim under
Sec. 1964(c). There is no room in the statutory language for an additional,
amorphous 'racketeering injury' requirement.
Summary
For a civil RICO claim, it is not necessary to prove that the racketeering
activity is connected to organized crime. The focus is on whether the
defendant engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity that injured the
plaintiff's business or property. The court explicitly states that there is no

=== PAGE 13 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
requirement for an additional 'racketeering injury' beyond the harm caused
by the predicate acts. This suggests that the presence of multiple victims is
not a requirement for a civil RICO claim to prevail.
Kerwick v. Pullman & Comley LLC, 3:24-CV-00427 (KAD) (D. Conn. Dec 20,
2024)
U.S. District Court — District of Connecticut
Extract
Nor has Plaintiff alleged that these purported predicates constituted a
pattern of racketeering. See Rivera v. NCB Mgmt. Servs., Inc., No. 3:23-
CV-221 (MPS), 2023 WL 7553051, at *8 (D. Conn. Nov. 14, 2023). '[C]ourts
in this Circuit have repeatedly held that a plaintiff has not alleged a RICO
violation where he or she has pled only a single scheme of a narrow scope,
including one victim and a limited number of participants.' Maguire v.
Ameriprise Fin. Servs., LLC, No. 3:22-CV-128 (VAB), 2022 WL 1718038, at
*10 (D. Conn. May 27, 2022) (quotation omitted) (collecting cases). Plaintiff
alleges that Defendants' scheme targeted only her, and it was focused on
'coercively controlling' her. This type of narrow, limited scheme is
insufficient to establish a pattern of racketeering activity.
Summary
Within the Second Circuit, courts have consistently held that a RICO
violation is not established when the plaintiff alleges only a single scheme
with a narrow scope, which includes only one victim and a limited number of
participants. This suggests that having multiple victims or a broader scheme
is generally necessary to establish a pattern of racketeering activity under
RICO in this jurisdiction.
Little v. City of Valley
U.S. District Court — Middle District of Alabama
Extract
Thus, in order to establish a federal civil RICO violation under § 1962(c), the
Plaintiffs “must satisfy four elements of proof: ‘(1) conduct (2) of an
enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity.’” Jones v.
Childers, 18 F.3d 899, 900 (11th Cir. 1994) (quoting Sedima, S..P.R.L. v.
Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479, 496 (1985)).

activity. It does not mention the necessity of having multiple victims as a
requirement for a RICO claim. The focus is on the pattern of racketeering
activity and the involvement in an enterprise, not on the number of victims.
Studco Bldg. Sys. U.S., LLC v. 1st Advantage Fed. Credit Union, 509 F.Supp.
3d 560 (E.D. Va. 2020)
U.S. District Court — Eastern District of Virginia
Extract
Generally, the elements of a civil Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act (RICO) claim are (1) a person, (2) an enterprise, (3) a
pattern of (4) racketeering activity (5) which causes injury to the plaintiff. 18
U.S.C.A. § 1962 (a, c). ... For a pattern of racketeering activity to exist, 'two
or more predicate acts of racketeering must have been committed within a
ten-year period.' ... Consequently, 'simply proving two or more predicate
acts is insufficient for a RICO plaintiff to succeed.' ... Instead, 'a plaintiff ...
must show that the racketeering predicates are related, and that they
amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity.'
Summary
Elements required for a civil RICO claim, focusing on the need for a pattern
of racketeering activity, which involves two or more predicate acts. It
emphasizes that these acts must be related and pose a threat of continued
criminal activity. The passage does not specify a requirement for multiple
victims; rather, it focuses on the pattern and continuity of the criminal
activity. This suggests that a single victim can suffice if the other elements
are met.
Grubbs v. Sheakley Grp., Inc., 807 F.3d 785 (6th Cir. 2015)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Sixth Circuit
Extract
The court below dismissed both the substantive RICO claim and the RICO
conspiracy claim on the ground that Plaintiffs failed to plead either closed—
or open-ended continuity: the alleged racketeering acts of mail and wire
fraud occurred within an eight-month period in pursuance of a single
scheme with a single victim, and Plaintiffs pled no facts indicating that the
alleged acts of racketeering activity would continue into the future. ... The
Sheakley Defendants also argue that the alleged activity was a single,
terminable scheme with only one victim that was, by nature, not open-
ended. See Moon, 465 F.3d at 725 (no RICO liability where defendant had
'single objective' and there were 'no facts suggesting that the scheme would
continue beyond the [d]efendants accomplishing their goal'); Vemco, 23 F.3d

=== PAGE 15 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
at 134 (no RICO liability where there was a 'single victim and a single
scheme for a single purpose').
Summary
The court dismissed the RICO claim due to the lack of continuity and the
presence of a single scheme with a single victim. This suggests that having
multiple victims is not an absolute requirement, but the presence of a single
victim in a single, terminable scheme without continuity can be grounds for
dismissal. The court emphasized the need for either closed-ended or open-
ended continuity, which was not demonstrated in this case.
Wilson v. Askew, 709 F.Supp. 146 (W.D. Ark. 1989)
U.S. District Court — Western District of Arkansas
Extract
A violation of § 1962(c) ... requires (1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3)
through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity.
Summary
The passage from the Wilson v. Askew case outlines the elements required
for a RICO violation under § 1962(c), which include conduct of an enterprise
through a pattern of racketeering activity. It does not specify that multiple
victims are required for a RICO claim to prevail. Instead, the focus is on the
pattern of racketeering activity, which implies that the requirement is more
about the nature and continuity of the criminal conduct rather than the
number of victims. This suggests that a RICO claim could potentially prevail
even with a single victim, as long as the other elements are satisfied.
Portionpac Chemical Corp. v. Sanitech Systems, 217 F.Supp.2d 1238 (M.D.
Fla. 2002)
U.S. District Court — Middle District of Florida
Extract
RICO establishes both criminal and civil penalties for violations of Section
1962. The civil remedies provision provides a private cause of action for 'any
person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of Section
1962.' 18 U.S.C. § 1961(c).
Summary
A civil RICO claim can be brought by "any person injured in his business or
property" due to a violation of Section 1962. This suggests that a single

=== PAGE 16 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
victim can bring a civil RICO claim, as the statute does not specify a
requirement for multiple victims. The focus is on the injury to business or
property caused by the RICO violation, not the number of victims.
United Energy Owners Committee, Inc. v. U.S. Energy Management
Systems, Inc., 837 F.2d 356 (9th Cir. 1988)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Ninth Circuit
Extract
Nevertheless, we held that a plaintiff properly pleads a RICO pattern where
it alleges multiple predicate acts against multiple victims over a significant
period of time (five months) since that clearly satisfies RICO's requirement
of 'two or more acts of racketeering activity.'
Summary
A RICO pattern can be properly pleaded when there are multiple predicate
acts against multiple victims over a significant period of time. This suggests
that having multiple victims is a way to satisfy the RICO requirement of
demonstrating a pattern of racketeering activity. However, it does not
explicitly state that multiple victims are a strict requirement, leaving room
for interpretation that there might be exceptions or other ways to satisfy the
pattern requirement.
Jones (Gordon, Laura) v. Childers (John H.), Talent Services, Inc., 18 F.3d
899 (11th Cir. 1994)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Eleventh Circuit
Extract
The Third Circuit, in Banks v. Wolk, 918 F.2d 418 (3d Cir.1990), has noted
that the fact that a RICO plaintiff was not a victim of the additional frauds
alleged as predicate acts should not carry much weight. The reference to
'similar victims' in H.J., Inc. cannot be read to require that a plaintiff be
injured by more than one predicate act....
Summary
The passage from the Third Circuit case, Banks v. Wolk, clarifies that for a
RICO claim, it is not necessary for a plaintiff to be a victim of multiple
predicate acts. The reference to "similar victims" does not imply a
requirement for multiple victims. This suggests that a single victim can
suffice for a RICO claim, provided the other elements of the claim are met.

Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy
The Brief - American Bar Association - 2024-01-01
Extract
A plaintiff only has standing to sue if they have been injured in their
business or property by conduct constituting the violation. To establish a §
1962(c) RICO claim, the following elements must be proven: ... • Injury: An
injury to business or property due to the racketeering activity.
Summary
For a civil RICO claim under § 1962(c), a plaintiff must demonstrate an
injury to their business or property due to the racketeering activity. This
requirement focuses on the injury to the plaintiff rather than the number of
victims. Therefore, the presence of multiple victims is not a requirement for
a civil RICO claim to prevail. The focus is on the direct injury to the
plaintiff's business or property.
PAYORS, PLAYERS, AND PROXIMATE CAUSE.
Notre Dame Law Review - University of Notre Dame Law School -
Crusey, Elisabeth F. - 2022-05-01
Extract
A private civil right of action in [section] 1964 provides that '[a]ny person
injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962...
may sue.' (36) Notably, a successful plaintiff under [section] 1964 is entitled
to treble damages and the cost of the suit, including attorney fees. (37)
Summary
Under section 1964 of the RICO statute, any person who is injured in their
business or property due to a violation of section 1962 may bring a civil suit.
This suggests that there is no explicit requirement for multiple victims to be
present for a civil RICO claim to prevail. The focus is on the injury to the
plaintiff's business or property, not on the number of victims. Therefore, a
single victim can potentially bring a successful civil RICO claim if they meet
the statutory requirements.
Defending RICO Claims In The Business Context Part II: RICO Claims Must
Allege Injury To Business Or Property

=== PAGE 18 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
If a plaintiff brings a civil suit alleging a RICO violation, the plaintiff must
plausibly allege that his injury animating the RICO claim is associated with
his business or property by reason of the defendant's violation of the RICO
laws. Absent these allegations, the lawsuit must be dismissed.
Summary
For a civil RICO claim to prevail, the plaintiff must allege an injury to their
business or property caused by the defendant's violation of RICO laws. It
does not mention the requirement of having multiple victims for a RICO
claim to succeed. The focus is on the plaintiff's injury and its causal
relationship with the alleged RICO violation. Therefore, the passage
suggests that having multiple victims is not a requirement for a civil RICO
claim to prevail.
