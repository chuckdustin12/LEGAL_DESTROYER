Question
Charles Dustin Myers
Answer
Assessment of Charles Dustin Myers as a Litigant
This assessment analyzes Charles Dustin Myers's litigation history based on eight cases found matching the search criteria. Given this limited sample size, the
findings may not fully represent his complete litigation experience.
Typical Role: Myers appears most frequently as a plaintiff or petitioner (e.g., JP01-24-OR00000002, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS vs. Margie Evonne Wilson;
02-25-00171-CV, In re Charles Dustin Myers), initiating legal action. However, he has also been a defendant in several cases, including traffic violations (e.g.,
14-0135J2, State of Texas vs. Charles Myers; SC20-142J2, GEICO COUNTY MUTUAL INSURANCE COMPANY vs CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS) and family law
disputes (4:24-cv-01185, Myers v. Myers). His role as "Relator" in multiple mandamus cases (02-25-00164-CV, In re Charles Dustin Myers, Relator;
02-25-00166-CV, In re Charles Dustin Myers) indicates a proactive approach to seeking court orders against government officials or entities.
Types of Cases: Myers's cases span various areas, including traffic violations, small claims, mandamus actions, and family law disputes (including orders of
retrieval). This diversity suggests a broad range of legal interactions.
Motion Practice Effectiveness: Myers demonstrates both strengths and weaknesses in motion practice. He actively files motions and supporting
documentation, indicating a proactive and prepared approach (e.g., 02-25-00164-CV, In re Charles Dustin Myers, Relator, where he filed a motion for emergency
relief, record, and affidavit on the same day). However, his pursuit of a writ of re-entry in JP01-24-OR00000002, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS vs. Margie Evonne
Wilson was unsuccessful due to jurisdictional issues, suggesting potential challenges in navigating complex legal procedures. His attempt to remove a case to
federal court in 4:24-cv-01185, Myers v. Myers was similarly unsuccessful due to lack of jurisdiction.
Average Case Duration: The analyzed cases have short durations, ranging from a single day to a maximum of eight days. This is significantly shorter than
typical litigation timelines, likely due to the nature of the cases (traffic violations, small claims, mandamus actions) and the outcomes (often dismissals or guilty
pleas). The mandamus cases, while still open, demonstrate a rapid filing and submission process, suggesting a focus on expedited relief.
Success Rate and Notable Outcomes: Determining a definitive success rate is difficult with the limited data. Myers has had successful outcomes in traffic cases
through nolo contendere pleas (e.g., 14-0134J2, State of Texas vs. Charles Myers; 14-0135J2, State of Texas vs. Charles Myers), but his attempts at obtaining
writs and removing a case to federal court have been unsuccessful. The outcomes of his mandamus actions remain undetermined.
Case Endings: The majority of the analyzed cases ended quickly, either through pleas in traffic matters or dismissals/remands in other cases. There is no
indication of cases proceeding to trial in this limited sample.
Significant Cases: The mandamus cases (02-25-00164-CV; 02-25-00166-CV; 02-25-00171-CV) are noteworthy due to their frequency and Myers's role as
"Relator," suggesting a pattern of seeking court orders against government entities or officials. The family law dispute in 4:24-cv-01185, Myers v. Myers and the
subsequent unsuccessful removal to federal court also highlights potential complexities in his legal interactions.
Attorneys/Law Firms: Cooper Carter appears as counsel for Myers in four cases, suggesting a consistent working relationship. The firm Marx Altman & Johnson
appears in one case. The specific types of cases these attorneys/firms handle for Myers cannot be definitively determined from the available data.
Expert Witnesses: There is no evidence of expert witness involvement in any of the analyzed cases.
Additional Insights: The variety of case types and jurisdictions suggests Myers engages with the legal system in multiple contexts. The mandamus actions may
indicate a tendency to challenge official actions or decisions. The jurisdictional issues encountered in some cases highlight the importance of careful
consideration of legal strategy and procedure when dealing with Myers in litigation.
While I did not locate any matching records from Docket Alarm beyond these eight cases, I may be able to help you locate more information. To improve your
results, consider starting with a broader search and date range, then refine as needed. Include synonyms, variations, and both industry-specific and common
terms alike (e.g. searching for "contract" and "agreement"). You may also need to account for jurisdictional differences in terminology.

Extract
Summary
Role: Charles Dustin Myers is identified as the "Relator" in the case, indicating he is the party initiating the action, which typically aligns with the role of a plaintiff.
The case involves a petition for writ of mandamus, suggesting Myers is seeking relief from a court against another party.
Status: The docket entries indicate that several motions and filings, including a motion for emergency relief and a petition for writ of mandamus, were submitted
on April 10, 2025. Given that these filings are recent and no final judgment or ruling has been noted, the case has not yet finished and remains open.

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Background: The cause of action appears to be a petition for a writ of mandamus, indicating that the petitioner seeks to compel a governmental entity or official
to perform a duty owed to the petitioner. The factual background is not explicitly detailed in the docket entries, but the filing of an emergency relief motion and
affidavit suggests urgent circumstances necessitating judicial intervention.
Motion practice: Charles Dustin Myers, as the Relator, filed a petition for a writ of mandamus and sought emergency relief on April 10, 2025, indicating his
proactive role in advocating for immediate judicial action. On the same day, he also submitted an affidavit and the necessary record, demonstrating his thorough
preparation and commitment to supporting his motion. The filings suggest a well-structured approach to compelling the court for the desired legal remedy.
Duration: The case began on April 10, 2025, with the filing of a motion for emergency relief, along with other related documents on the same day. Since there are
no entries indicating the conclusion of the case, it can be inferred that the case was still ongoing as of the last docket entry. Therefore, the duration of the case
from start to finish cannot be determined based on the provided docket entries.
Outcome: On April 10, 2025, a motion for emergency relief, a record, and an affidavit were filed, along with a petition for writ of mandamus. All documents were
submitted on the same day, indicating a coordinated effort to seek immediate judicial intervention. The nature of the case and its urgency suggest potential issues
requiring prompt attention from the court. The outcome remains unclear from the provided entries, pending a ruling or further developments.
Complexity: The case involves a petition for a writ of mandamus, indicating that the petitioner is seeking a court order to compel a government official or entity to
perform a duty that is required by law. The filings on the same day, including a motion for emergency relief, record, and affidavit, suggest urgency and potential
complexity in the underlying issues prompting the mandamus request. Overall, while the case type itself is not inherently complex, the nature of the emergency
relief and accompanying documentation indicates that there may be significant legal and factual questions at play.
Experts: The docket entries do not indicate the involvement of any expert witnesses in the case. The filings include a motion for emergency relief, a record, an
affidavit, and a petition for a writ of mandamus, all submitted by Charles Dustin Myers as the Relator. This suggests that he is actively seeking a specific legal
remedy but does not provide evidence of any experts being hired.
Monetary value: The docket does not provide any specific monetary amounts related to the case, nor does it suggest the scale of damages or financial stakes
involved. Given the nature of the entries, which include motions for emergency relief and a petition for writ of mandamus, it is reasonable to estimate that the case
may involve significant financial implications, potentially ranging from tens of thousands to several million dollars, depending on the underlying issues at stake.
However, without more detailed information from the complaint or associated documents, a precise figure cannot be determined.

Extract
Summary
Role: Charles Dustin Myers is designated as the Defendant in the case, while GEICO County Mutual Insurance Company is identified as the Plaintiff. The docket
entries indicate that a citation was issued for Myers, which is consistent with his role as the party being sued. The Plaintiff's Original Petition was filed prior to the
service request for Myers, further establishing the litigation context.
Status: The case is still ongoing as indicated by the case status "Citation Issued," and the most recent entries show that a citation for the defendant, Charles
Dustin Myers, remains unserved. The last activity recorded was the filing of the Plaintiff's Original Petition on September 10, 2020, followed by service requests
on September 11, 2020. Therefore, the case has not yet been closed.
Background: The case involves a plaintiff, Charles Dustin Myers, who filed an Original Petition on September 10, 2020, although the specific cause of action is
not detailed in the docket entries. The subsequent entries indicate attempts to serve the defendant, but as of September 11, 2020, the defendant remains
unserved, which may affect the progression of the case.
Motion practice: The docket reflects that on September 10, 2020, the Plaintiff, GEICO County Mutual Insurance Company, filed an Original Petition against
Defendant Charles Dustin Myers, who was not formally served with the citation as of September 11, 2020. The service request for the citation was initiated on the
same date, indicating an effort to notify the Defendant of the legal proceedings. As of the last entry, the Defendant remains unserved, which may affect
subsequent motion practice and timelines in the case.
Duration: The case was filed on September 10, 2020, and the last docket entry occurred on September 11, 2020, indicating that the entire case lasted just two
days. The entries show that the citation was unserved, and a service request was made on the same date as the filing, suggesting minimal progress in the case
during this brief period.

11, 2020, a Citation has been issued but remains unserved, indicating that the defendant has not yet been formally notified of the proceedings. The service of the
Citation was requested through EZ Messenger, showing the plaintiff's intention to proceed with the case despite the current status of the defendant's notification.
The case status remains pending as the Citation has not been executed.
Complexity: The case appears to be relatively straightforward, with the initial filing consisting of a Plaintiff's Original Petition dated September 10, 2020, and
subsequent entries indicating attempts to serve the defendant, Charles Dustin Myers, on September 11, 2020. The lack of any complex motions, counterclaims,
or extensive procedural history suggests a low level of complexity at this stage. The reliance on a service request indicates that the case may still be in its early
procedural phases.

Monetary value: The docket does not specify a monetary amount for the case as it only includes procedural entries, such as citations and a service request. The

writ of re-entry and scheduled hearings, suggesting that while the case status is marked as finalized, there may still be unresolved issues or actions pending in
related matters.
Background: The cause of action in this case involves a Writ of Re-Entry, which the plaintiff, Charles Dustin Myers, sought following a lockout situation. The
factual background includes the plaintiff's application for the writ being denied due to a lack of jurisdiction, as indicated by references to standing orders and
orders from the 322nd District Court. Various exhibits were filed, including notices related to the eviction and court orders, suggesting ongoing disputes regarding
possession and jurisdictional issues in family law matters.
Motion practice: Charles Dustin Myers, the Petitioner, actively engaged in the legal proceedings by filing an Application for Writ of Re-Entry and an Application
for Writ of Retrieval on March 6, 2024. He participated in a special hearing via Zoom on March 8, 2024, regarding the Writ of Re-Entry, which was ultimately
denied due to a lack of jurisdiction, as explained by the judge in light of pending family law matters. Throughout this process, Myers submitted multiple exhibits
related to jurisdictional issues and evidence for temporary orders, indicating his commitment to pursuing legal relief concerning possession or access to property.
Duration: The case lasted from March 6, 2024, when the application for writs of re-entry and retrieval were filed, to March 8, 2024, when the writ of re-entry was
denied and the case was finalized, totaling a duration of just two days.
Outcome: The writ of re-entry filed by the plaintiff, Charles Dustin Myers, was denied by the judge due to lack of jurisdiction, as the case is under family law with
standing orders pending from the 322nd District Court. A special hearing was held via Zoom on March 8, 2024, where the court explained the denial, citing prior
dismissals and orders related to jurisdiction. The case has been finalized following this outcome.
Complexity: The case is relatively complex, involving multiple filings including applications for a writ of re-entry and a writ of retrieval, along with various exhibits
that suggest intricate procedural issues, such as jurisdiction and standing orders from another court. The presence of emergency motions, a special hearing set
via video conferencing, and multiple exhibits filed indicates that the legal arguments and procedural posture are nuanced and may require careful consideration.
The judge's denial of the writ due to jurisdictional concerns further complicates the matter, highlighting ongoing litigation in family law.
Experts: There is no indication in the docket that any experts were involved in the case, nor is there any mention of experts being hired by Charles Dustin Myers,
the Petitioner. The entries primarily focus on procedural motions related to the Writ of Re-Entry and Writ of Retrieval, along with various exhibits filed to support
his claims concerning jurisdiction and temporary orders.
Monetary value: The docket entries indicate a family law case primarily focused on a writ of re-entry, with no specific monetary claims or amounts detailed. The
proceedings involve jurisdictional issues and emergency motions, suggesting that the financial stakes may not be substantial, potentially ranging from a few
thousand to tens of thousands of dollars, depending on the property and legal fees involved. However, without explicit monetary claims listed, a precise estimate
remains unclear.
Myers v. Myers
Extract
Summary
Role: Charles Dustin Myers is identified as a Defendant in the case. He is involved in the legal proceedings through a Notice of Removal and has submitted a
Certificate of Interested Persons. The docket also indicates that he has counsel representing him in this matter.
Status: The case has been terminated as of December 6, 2024, when the court ordered it to be remanded to the 322nd Judicial District Court of Tarrant County,
Texas, for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Subsequent docket entries indicate that necessary documents were delivered, but there are no further actions
suggesting the case is still open. Thus, the case is closed.
Background: The cause of action in this case is based on a Notice of Removal under 28 U.S.C. § 1441. The factual background indicates that the case was
removed by defendant Charles Dustin Myers from the 322nd Judicial District Court of Tarrant County, Texas, to the federal court, but was subsequently
remanded back for lack of subject matter jurisdiction as per the order issued by Judge Reed C. O'Connor on December 6, 2024.
Motion practice: Charles Dustin Myers, as a Defendant, filed a Notice of Removal along with multiple attachments, indicating his active participation in the 
motion practice within this case. Despite his efforts to remove the case to federal court, the court ultimately remanded it back to the 322nd Judicial District Court 
of Tarrant County, Texas, citing a lack of subject matter jurisdiction. His representation by counsel suggests a strategic approach to the litigation, although the

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
outcome demonstrates the challenges faced in establishing federal jurisdiction.
Duration: The case lasted from December 4, 2024, when it was filed, to December 6, 2024, when it was terminated, resulting in a total duration of just two days.
The case was remanded to the state court for lack of subject matter jurisdiction shortly after filing.
Outcome: The case was remanded to the 322nd Judicial District Court of Tarrant County, Texas, on December 6, 2024, due to a lack of subject matter
jurisdiction as determined by Judge Reed C. O'Connor. Following the remand order, the court issued a clerk's notice of delivery to the parties involved. The case
is officially closed as of December 6, 2024, with no further proceedings anticipated in the federal court.
Complexity: The case involved a Notice of Removal filed by Charles Dustin Myers, indicating that it was initially in state court before being removed to federal
court under 28 U.S.C. § 1441. However, the court ultimately remanded the case back to the 322nd Judicial District Court of Tarrant County, Texas, due to a lack
of subject matter jurisdiction. The presence of multiple attachments and the involvement of a pro se party suggest some procedural complexity, but the case was
closed relatively quickly, indicating that substantive issues may not have been extensive. Overall, the case appears to be of moderate complexity primarily due to
procedural maneuvers rather than substantive legal disputes.
Experts: The docket does not indicate the involvement of any expert witnesses in the case. It primarily documents the actions taken by Charles Dustin Myers,
who is identified as a Defendant and has legal representation, along with the remand of the case to the state court for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
Monetary value: The docket does not specify a monetary amount associated with the case; however, it indicates that a filing fee of $405.00 was paid, which
suggests that the case may involve a relatively modest financial stake. Given the nature of cases involving removal to federal court and the associated procedural
complexities, a rough estimate for the monetary aspect could be several thousand dollars, likely in the range of $10,000 to $50,000, depending on the underlying
claims.
