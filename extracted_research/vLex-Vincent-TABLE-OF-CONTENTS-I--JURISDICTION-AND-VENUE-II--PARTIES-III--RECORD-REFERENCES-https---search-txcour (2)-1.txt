Plaintiff incorporates by reference public records from the Texas Supreme
Court, and requests the court to take judicial notice of these documents. The
Fifth Circuit has repeatedly held that it is proper for federal courts to take
judicial notice of matters of public record, including documents filed in state
court proceedings (Miller v. Dunn, 35 F.4th 1007 (5th Cir. 2022); LUV N'
Care, Ltd. v. Jackel Int'l Ltd., 502 F.Supp.3d 1106 (W.D. La. 2020); Wright v.
Arlington Indep. Sch. Dist., Civil Action No. 4:19-cv-00278-P (N.D. Tex. Nov
25, 2019)). Plaintiff therefore requests that this Court take judicial
knowledge of the consolidated mandamus record, as its’ authenticity is not
reasonably disputed. Here, all record references point to the public
consolidated mandamus record, as submitted to the Texas Supreme Court, a
copy of which has been served upon each defendant named in this complaint
either individually or through their agent. Link to the record: https://

bc41-bbc08c814365 All references to the record are marked herein with
“REC. [page]” and are hyperlinked to take the reader directly to the
reference. The record is filed under affidavit, and remains unopposed at the
time of filing this complaint. Therefore, Plaintiff respectfully asks that the
Court take judicial notice of the record under Federal Rule of Evidence 201,
filed on June 6, 2025, in the Texas Supreme Court under case numbers
25-0361, 25-0367, 25-0378, 25-0426, and 25-0458. II. TIMELINE OF
EVENTS BACKGROUND Morgan Michelle Myers, (“Myers”) and Charles
Dustin Myers, (“Plaintiff”) were married on June 20, 2015, and have two
daughters, C.R.M. and M.E.M, aged seven and nine. The evidence in this
case will show that in early December of 2023, the entire family was
blindsided by Myers’ sudden announcement that she wanted a divorce from
Plaintiff. REC. 717 The evidence will further show that Myers’ reasoning for
this divorce changes over time – beginning with how Plaintiff spoke to her,
and then switches to abuse and sexual harassment, and allegations of drug
abuse, claims that were only brought up in her initial pleadings. On
December 12, 2023, Plaintiff discovered a large volume of text messages
between Myers and two individuals identified as Debbie Price and Damen
Kazlauskas of Fort Worth, Texas spanning between October 2022 and
December 2023. REC. 254-714 In response to this discovery, Myers began to
communicate with Defendant Daniel Kenneth Branthoover, a resident of
Yukon, Oklahoma, who assisted her in the planning, drafting, traveling, and
submitting of fraudulent documents to the 322nd District Court of Tarrant
County designed to divest Plaintiff of his home and business operations.
When these allegations were raised to the State, they failed to adjudicate
them and violated the Plaintiff’s constitutional rights when he was deprived
of the guarantees of equal protection under the law and when he was not
afforded due process before being deprived of his property. REC. 183. The
central question is whether Defendants Munford, Kaitcer, Carter, and Baker
are victims of the initial scheme – or willing participants in an expanded
associate-in-fact enterprise that began in December of 2023 as the Myers-
Branthoover enterprise. A. The Myers-Branthoover Enterprise 1. On
December 14, 2023, Defendants Morgan Michelle Myers (“Myers)” and
Daniel Kenneth Branthoover (“Branthoover”), acting in concert and under
deceptive pretenses, (REC. 1704), initiated text-message communications
through which they formed and advanced a common plan and agreement.
Over the weekend of December 15, 2023, they met in Yukon, Oklahoma, to
further that plan ( REC. 274-278). The deceptive text message from
Defendant Branthoover claiming that he wanted to assist Plaintiff was
following an attempt by Myers to receive an ex-parte order of protection
from the 322nd District Court of Tarrant county, attempted on December 14,
2023 (REC. 78). B. Interstate Travel and Transfer 2. As part of their
agreement, both Defendants planned to draft and submit an original petition
for divorce and an affidavit of indigency to the 322nd District Court of
Tarrant County, with the intended and foreseeable result of removing
Plaintiff from his matrimonial residence at 6641 Anne Court, Watauga, Texas
76148—which also serves as his place of business for clients in the United
States, Canada, and the United Kingdom that rely on his market data
services (REC. 812 ¶ 16). 3. During Defendant Myers’s interstate travel, she
transferred the parties’ marital funds into Defendant Branthoover’s PayPal
account in the amount of $1,576 (REC. 723). Those proceeds funded a
second mobile phone (817-940-0852), listed on the fraudulent pleadings that

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Myers and Branthoover jointly prepared in Oklahoma, which Myers then
carried from Yukon to Texas on December 17, 2023 (REC. 86; 99; 102; 107).
C. Admissions 4. On December 16, 2023, Plaintiff reached out to
Branthoover and requested that the $1,576 be returned as they were needed
for Christmas gifts for the children, and for business advertising expenses
for his business. REC. 728-729. In response, defendant Branthoover
admitted that the purpose of defendant Myers’ visit was to help her prepare
paperwork for divorce litigation and confirmed that the transfer of $1,576
did in fact occur. REC. 730. Plaintiff’s bank statement from December 2023
further confirms this transaction. REC. 723. D. Post-submission
Collaboration 5. On December 18, 2023, defendant Myers submitted the
fraudulently prepared original petition for divorce, and an affidavit of
indigency to the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County. After these
documents were submitted, defendant Branthoover sent a text message to
Plaintiff on December 19, 2023, at 5:50 P.M. CST, holding himself out to be
defendant Myers’ attorney, showing his involvement extends past the initial
help in preparing the fraudulent documents. REC. 1712-1713 6. Four days
later, on December 22, 2023, defendant Myers submitted another knowingly
fraudulent application for protective to the 322nd District Court of Tarrant
County claiming that family violence had occurred on December 18, 2023,
supported by both an affidavit and unsworn declaration. REC. 108-109. E.
Significant and Intentional Misrepresentations 7. On December 27 and
December 28, 2023, respectively, the documents prepared by Myers with
the assistance of Branthoover were served on Plaintiff via the U.S.
Constable, and contained the following misrepresentations: i. That
defendant Myers could not afford court costs; REC. 72, REC. 85-96 ii. That
defendant Myers had an active order of protection against the Plaintiff with
a finding of family violence that had occurred during the marriage; REC. 78
at 10 iii. That defendant Myers was financially responsible for the family
vehicles, rent payments, utilities, and other household expenses, making
herself appear as the primary breadwinner; REC. 92 iv. That defendant
Myers would be harassed or abused if Plaintiff were given her newly
acquired phone number that was obtained while in Oklahoma; REC. 81 at
15. v. That defendant Myers and Plaintiff ceased living together on
December 1, 2023; REC. 74 at 4 vi. That family violence occurred on
December 18, 2023, in the presence of the two Children. REC. 108-109. vii.
That both family vehicles were defendant Myers’ separate property acquired
before marriage. REC. 79 at 11B F. Evidence to the Contrary 8. On the same
day Defendant Myers claimed to be in an emergency requiring the Plaintiff’s
prompt removal from the home, she can be seen at the home with Plaintiff
and the children in no state of emergency and also still cohabitating in the
marital home. REC 1715. 9. Again, on December 29, 2023, Defendant Myers
can be seen with Plaintiff at the family home, smiling and laughing with the
children in no state of emergency and still collaborating with Plaintiff in the
marital home. REC. 1735. 10. The citation for the application for protective
order ordered Respondent to show cause as to why it should not issue with a
hearing scheduled for January 16, 2024. REC. 118. 11. In response to
extensive misrepresentation above, Plaintiff prepared an original answer,
filed a motion to consolidate, and provided background information which
alleged that defendant Myers was intentionally abusing the legal process.
REC. 130-132. Plaintiff was ordered to show cause on January 16, 2024,
regarding the protective order application. REC. 118 G. Inclement Weather

and First Appearance 12. On January 15, 2024, the Tarrant County District
Courts Facebook page sent out a notice informing the members of the public
that the court would be closed on January 16, 2024, due to inclement
weather. REC. 1202. 13. Unaware of the closure at the time, the parties
appeared at the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County on January 16, 2024,
and were met with a dark courtroom, with only one judge in the building at
the time of their arrival – Defendant James Munford (“Munford”). 14.
Defendant Munford summarily ordered the Plaintiff out of his home,
inadvertently assisting the Myers-Branthoover associate-in-fact enterprise of
achieving their primary goal in having the Plaintiff removed from his
residence, despite the broader goal being to obtain a decree of divorce to
permanently divest Plaintiff of his interests. REC. 183. 15. Defendant
Munford’s initial order was baseless, made in the absence of any emergency,
without a hearing, and disregarded the Plaintiff’s pleadings, telling Myers
“you’re going to have to find evidence of family violence!” clearly aware that
this order was made without any regard to the Plaintiff’s constitutional
rights. 16. Defendant Jeffrey Kaitcer, (“Kaitcer”) walked into the courtroom
late due to the inclement weather and turned the courtroom into a laughing
matter as he began to joke with Defendant Munford, and instructed the
parties to download the AppClose app for communication, and the matter
was reset for January 22, 2024. There exists no record of this proceeding,
only marked appearances on the docket. H. Reset #1 – January 22, 2024,
Setting 17. At the January 22 reset hearing, the parties appeared only to
have the case reset once more because defendant Myers allegedly retained
the services of Defendant Cooper Carter, (“Carter”) in the lobby of the
courthouse just moments before the hearing was scheduled to begin. No
appearance can be traced to this setting by either party on the docket (REC.
1551), and once again, no hearing was held, and the case reset for a second
time to February 1, 2024. REC. 186. 18. Kaitcer permitted attorney Dan
Bacalis, Plaintiff’s prior attorney, to fill out the Associate Judge’s Report, and
the parties never went before him as indicated by the case docket’s lack of
appearance on this date by either party. I. Reset #2 – February 1, 2024,
Setting 19. One day prior to the February 1 setting, both attorneys,
Defendant Carter and Dan Bacalis, both amended the petition for divorce
and counterpetition for divorce without the parties’ knowledge. (REC. 189,
REC. 209) These amended documents were similar, submitted on the same
day, and raised concerns for Plaintiff regarding his quality of representation.
20. At the February 1 setting, both parties were in the conference rooms
outside of Defendant Kaitcer’s courtroom, when attorney Bacalis walks in
holding a settlement agreement. When Plaintiff refused this option and
requested that they go have a hearing before the judge. 21. This is when
Bacalis stated, as witness affidavits corroborate, that he “knows this Judge
and this is the best we can get.” and further stated “[w]e’ll be here all day.
We can come back and change it later.” 22. Outraged by this response,
Plaintiff paid very close attention to the settlement offer Bacalis was
pressuring him to sign, and noticed the following provisions: A typed written
Order conforming to this Report will follow within 20 days from the date this
Report is signed. The Temporary Order shall be prepared by DAN BACALIS.
Each attorney should approve the Order. The parties do not need to approve
the Order. The attorney reviewing the proposed Order shall have five (5)
days to do so. There arc no ten (JO) day letters. If an agreement is not
reached, a Motion to Sign shall be filed and set within thirty (30) days from

=== PAGE 5 ===

the signing of this Report. IT IS SO ORDERED (REC. 233) J. Termination of
Counsel and the Emergency Motion 23. With the above provisions in mind,
Plaintiff signed the document and immediately fired his attorney and
provided notice to the court. REC. 221. By doing so, Plaintiff gained access
back to the residency, invalidated the agreement, and was able to use the
time back in the house to run damage control on his business operations
while preparing to expose the Myers-Branthoover enterprise to the court via
a MOTION TO RECONSIDER EVIDENCE AND VACATE TEMPORARY
ORDERS, which was filed on February 9, 2024, within three business days of
the February 1 agreed associate judge’s report being served by the clerk.
REC. 240 24. In this motion, it was specifically stated that: i. “I am seeking
immediate court intervention to correct procedural e rrors and address the
misuse of the legal system by the Petitioner.” REC. 244 ii. “Particularly, Dan
Branthoover became involved. He is the boyfriend of the Petitioner’s Mother.
Shortly thereafter, I received a notice from our joint bank account stating
that $1,576 had just been withdrawn. As our bank statement for December
2023 will demonstrate – the transaction record shows the funds being
transferred directly to Mr. Branthoover’s PayPal account” REC. 245 iii. “The
Petitioner's action of filing for divorce under an Affidavit of Inability to pay
three days after transferring $1,576 to herself starkly contravenes the
mandates set forth in Chapter 10, Section 10.001 of the Civil Practice and
Remedies Code”. REC 247 at B2 iv. “The Petitioner violated Chapter 10,
Section 10.001 a second time within the same document when she
intentionally elected to waive the 60-day waiting period claiming to have an
active protective order against me that found family violence had occurred
during our marriage.” REC 247 at B3. v. “This suit was the second attempt
by the Petitioner to have me removed from the home, which ultimately
succeeded.” REC 248 at D1 25. The motion went on to explain the factual
pattern described up to this point, putting the court on notice of the key
issues with provided exhibits which were duly served on Carter. In response
to Plaintiff’s motion, he received the first of just two email communications
from Carter throughout the case’s history, where she claimed she would be
filing a counter motion when disclosing her availability for the hearing on
Plaintiff’s emergency motion. REC. 2794 No such countermotion was filed
by Carter. K. Summary Judgment and Notice of Hearing 26. By February 22,
no response had been filed by Carter, so Plaintiff filed a Partial Motion for
Summary Judgment. REC. 758. Plaintiff also submitted a proposed parenting
plan as Exhibit D. REC. 769. No response was ever received from Carter. 27.
On February 27, 2024, Defendant Munford signed and issued a notice of
hearing to the parties with the hearing set for March 14, 2024. REC. 776. L.
Plaintiff’s Notice to the Court and Defendant Myers’ Self-Help Remedies 28.
On March 3, 2024, Plaintiff notified the Court that he would not be leaving
the home as it was not in the best interests of his children. REC. 782. 29.
The following day, on March 6, 2024, while walking his daughters to school,
Myers ran inside the family home, and locked him out of the marital
residence, leaving a sign on the door that said “[y]ou should have been out
by Saturday you are now locked out!” REC. 1748. 30. Plaintiff called local
law enforcement to help him regain entry into the home, where mother
produced the agreed associate judge’s report signed on February 1, 2024,
and used it as a means to block Plaintiff’s entrance to the home. 31. To avoid
further conflict, Plaintiff was escorted into the home where he was able to
grab only his computer and a few clothes and went to Flower Mound to

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
temporarily stay with his father until the time of the hearing on his
emergency motion, scheduled for March 14, 2024, at 9:00 A.M. L. The
Hearing On Plaintiff’s Emergency Motion 32. On March 14, 2024, the
parties arrived at the 322nd District Court, and on the way into the
courtroom, defendants Myers and Carter could be seen in the conference
room, quickly shuffling papers back and forth. 33. After checking in with the
bailiff, Plaintiff turned around to see defendant Carter extending to him a
document titled “Temporary Orders” that were the reduced version of the
February 1 associate judge’s report. REC. 888. 34. These orders, which were
not prepared by Dan Bacalis, which were not agreed to by the parties, were
reduced well outside of the 20-day requirement as ordered by the judge, and
which were never filed with the clerk, stated the following
misrepresentations: i. On February 1, 2024, the Court heard Petitioner's
motion for temporary orders. ii. The parties have agreed to the terms of this
order as evidenced by the signatures below. REC. 888. iii. The Court, after
examining the record and the agreement of the parties and hearing the
evidence and argument of counsel, finds that all necessary prerequisites of
the law have been legally satisfied and that the Court has jurisdiction of this
case and of all the parties. REC. 888. iv. The dates that the parties would
have access to the family residence was altered, changing the date Plaintiff
was supposed to leave from March 1, 2024, to March 20, 2024, and
changing Myers’ date of re-entry from March 1, 2024, to March 30, 2024,
leaving a 10-day window where no one would occupy the residence. v. This
modification was made to prevent Myers from being liable for illegally
locking Plaintiff out of the home on March 6, 2024. 35. On the last page of
the orders, Plaintiff’s attorney who was terminated weeks earlier did not
sign the document, and Plaintiff refused to sign the document for the
forthcoming reasons: i. It claimed a hearing occurred on a motion which was
never set for a hearing or served on the Plaintiff and doesn’t exist on the
docket. ii. It was prepared by defendant Carter, not Dan Bacalis. iii. The
associate judge was presiding over a de novo request of his own prior
report. iv. The matrimonial address was incorrect, as it stated “6641 Anns
Court”, rather than 6641 Anne Court. REC. 915, REC. 922 v. The orders
were not in the best interests of the children. vi. Notwithstanding the
Plaintiff’s revocation of consent by filing the emergency motion, the terms
were altered right before they were rendered into effect by defendant
Kaitcer. vii. Plaintiff did not agree to the terms as he was in court that very
day to expose Myers. M. Predicate Acts: Extortion 36. Kaitcer, knowing that
no response was filed, knowing that he was presiding over a hearing to
which he had no subject matter jurisdiction, and knowing that the temporary
orders produced by defendant Carter was served just moments earlier,
signed another associate judge’s report pre-drafted by defendant Carter,
which summarily denied the Plaintiff’s emergency motion, ignored the fact
that Carter had not provided a response, and within the report itself,
Plaintiff was ordered to sign the document that Carter had just presented to
him despite raising objections to its’ contents, and despite his consent not
being present. REC. 795. 37. Finally, defendant Kaitcer refused to consider
Plaintiff’s exhibits, including six affidavits prepared by his business clients
who have been directly affected by his inability to provide the real-time
market data services his clients relied on, who were located throughout the
United States. REC. 851; REC. 854; REC. 857; REC. 860; REC. 863; REC.
867; REC. 870. 38. Following the setting, the orders were rendered into

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
effect without Plaintiff’s signature (REC. 925) , and Plaintiff filed a request
for findings of fact and conclusions of law (REC. 883), and filed and
amended a “Preparatory Notice for Judicial Review” which recounted the
factual timeline up to that point, and included the affidavits that Kaitcer
refused to accept on March 14, 2024. REC. 798, REC. 851, REC. 854, REC.
857, REC. 860, REC. 863, REC. 867, REC. 870. 39. The orders stated they
were to remain in effect until the final decree of divorce, and Plaintiff’s
journey of one-sided appeals began. N. One Sided Appellate Efforts, and
Defective IWO 40. Following the rendition of the temporary orders on March
26, 2024, Plaintiff spent between April 8, 2024 and September 15, 2024,
appealing via mandamus to the Second Court of Appeals and the Texas
Supreme Court. REC. 1010. 41. During the appellate efforts, Carter filed one
of two motions in the case, which was a motion for pre-trial conference filed
on April 24, 2024, on her behalf by Roderick D. Marx, a party not named in
the suit. REC. 1014, REC. 1016. 42. Plaintiff immediately objected to the
pre-trial conference, and no response was ever issued by Carter or the
court. REC. 1018. 43. On April 30th, Plaintiff filed his notice of completion
regarding the parenting course as ordered, despite actively trying to vacate
them. REC. 1047. No parenting course was ever completed by Myers. 44. On
May 2, 2024, Plaintiff’s en banc reconsideration was denied in the Second
Court of Appeals, and he began preparing an appeal to the Supreme Court
of Texas. REC. 1067. 45. On May 19, 2024, Carter sent the second and last
email correspondence that would be received in the case, which falsely
claimed he agreed to the orders signed on March 14, 2024, and requested
that he fill out an IWO, which Plaintiff found to be defective. REC. 1722,
REC. 1728. No further correspondence was received by Carter. O.
Fraudulent Intervention and Branthoover’s Continued Involvement 46. On
June 23rd Plaintiff filed a motion in state court entitled MOTION FOR
JOINDER OF PERSONS NEEDED FOR JUST ADJUDICATION at 12:14 P.M.
REC. 1075. This motion received no response from Carter. 47. On June 23rd
at 1:54 P.M., directly following the submission of the motion, Branthoover
texted Plaintiff stating “Lol. And here comes another denial. Please sue me
individually. Please.”, referring to the earlier filed motion and showing his
continued oversight of the case’s progression since his initial predicate acts.
48. Four days later, on June 28, 2024, the Texas Office of the Attorney
General allegedly filed an intervention pleading, claiming that Plaintiff was
past due on child support, and requested information from Plaintiff. REC.
1099. 49. Most notably, the certificate of service to this intervention
pleading was allegedly signed by Holly Hayes, the designated attorney for
the OAG, yet the name underneath the signature line reads CHOYA
BURKLEY. REC. 1102. 50. Plaintiff promptly objected to the intervention,
and never received any response from the OAG, Carter, or the court. REC.
1106. P. Supreme Court, Rule 12, and Emergency Temporary Orders 51. As
Plaintiff continued to appeal to the Supreme Court of Texas, all prosecution
came to an end in the trial court. It wasn’t until September 15, 2024, that
Plaintiff filed a first amended rehearing motion in the Texas Supreme Court,
(REC. 1136) and after noticing Carter’s lack of participation, he began to
question her authority given several ambiguities surrounding her
representation, and filed a rule 12 motion to show authority. REC. 1170. No
response was ever received to this motion from Carter. 52. At this point,
Plaintiff had been staying in Airbnb homes while he sought relief to ensure
he could remain close to his daughters during this time. On September 26,

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
2024, he filed and later amended an EMERGENCY MOTION FOR
TEMPORARY ORDERS and requested expedited relief by October 1, 2024,
as that was when Plaintiff was forced to move away from the area due to
cost of living being unsustainable. REC. 1184. No response was ever
received from Carter regarding this motion. 53. By October 1, Plaintiff had
no choice but to start pursuing administrative remedies, and thought the
court was biased against him given the case’s history up to that point. He
began to prepare a Joint Motion to Recuse defendants Munford and Kaitcer
and filed it with the clerk of the court on October 7, 2024. REC. 1197. Q.
Predicate Act: Wire Fraud 54. On October 8, 2024, Defendant Munford
signed and forwarded a “Joint Motion to Recuse” attached to his order of
referral to regional presiding judge David L. Evans but was notably missing
the exhibits and affidavit critical to the motion. REC. 1222 55. A copy of this
exchange was sent via defendant Baker on 4:43 P.M. on October 8. REC.
1254 56. Plaintiff immediately pointed out the discrepancies between the
motion filed and the motion forwarded to David L. Evans, where she replied
and admitted that the full document had been e-filed and remains with the
court. REC. 1255 57. Unsatisfied with this response, Plaintiff further pointed
out that the filing size of the document filed and the one referring to David
L. Evans was significantly different. No further correspondence was
received by Baker until the following day. REC. 1256 58. The following day
on October 8, 2024, defendant Munford signed and filed an “Amended Order
of Referral” which had the full motion attached this time, albeit still
modified as the hyperlinks and bookmarks had been removed. REC. 1282 59.
This amended referral was sent via email correspondence by Baker at 11:17
A.M. on October 8, 2024, who stated that due to the size of the motion, it
was split into three parts. REC. 1258. This excuse directly contradicts the
standard filing procedure in Tarrant County, which was raised and
subsequently ignored in an objection. REC. 1269. No response was filed in
regard to the motion to recuse or objection by Carter. R. Recusal Denial and
More Delays, and Federal Removal 60. Justice E. Lee Gabriel was assigned
to hear the motion, which had to be rescheduled due to technical difficulties
for November 7, 2024. REC. 1306. 61. The morning of the hearing, Plaintiff
woke up with a dental emergency, and promptly notified all parties, and
requested a reset for the hearing, which everyone agreed to. REC.
1393-1396. 62. Despite this agreement, the recusal was denied for failure to
appear, and made no mention of the agreement or the emergency. REC.
1398. 63. With no other remedies left, Plaintiff removed the case to Federal
Court on December 2, 2024, which was quickly remanded back on
December 4, 2024. REC. 1426. 64. On December 14, 2024, defendant
Branthoover texted Plaintiff, sending a threat which stated “[w]hen things
all over, you get to deal with me.” at 2:15 P.M. REC. 1720 65. On December
16, 2024, Plaintiff initiated suit against Daniel Kenneth Branthoover in the
Western District of Oklahoma seeking relief in the form of damages from the
ongoing deprivation from his home. REC. 1451. 66. Plaintiff notified the
Texas court of this lawsuit on December 31, 2024. REC. 1446. S. Further
Delays, Motion to Dismiss for Want of Prosecution, and the Original SAPCR
67. On January 24, 2025, Plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss for want of
prosecution due to the total lack of participation in the case by the opposing
party. REC. 1527. No response was ever received from Carter on this
motion. 68. On January 29, 2025, defendant Myers began disposing of
Plaintiff’s personal belongings that remained on the family property. REC.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
1629-1631. 69. On February 12, 2025, Plaintiff learned that his youngest
daughter was suffering from dental pain due to Myers’ failure to obtain
dental insurance for the children. REC. 3281. 70. By March 14, (REC.
1833-1837) the judges had still not been reinstated from the first recusal,
which lad Plaintiff to reach out to Baker to request a hearing on his
unopposed summary judgment that had been on the docket since February
22, 2024, where he had to remind her to reinstate the judges back into the
case. REC. 1833-1837. 71. Given the delays, and since the case had been
brought in bad faith initially, the Plaintiff opened an original SAPCR suit in
the 233rd District Court of Tarrant County on March 18, 2025, where he
argued for dominant jurisdiction in a cover letter sent to the clerk. REC.
2260. T. Counsel Suddenly Becomes Active 72. The very next day, defendant
Carter filed an original answer filed on her behalf by Roderick Marx. REC.
2279. The motion was a boilerplate motion, and was followed by a motion to
consolidate, which was filed in the wrong court, and was also filed on
Carter’s behalf by RODERICK D. MARX. REC. 2284. 73. The Plaintiff
immediately responded by filing a motion to strike (REC. 1957) a Rule 12
motion to show authority challenging both Carter and RODERICK D MARX’s
authority (REC. 2288) and on March 24, 2025, an emergency ex-parte TRO
to prevent Myers from barring Plaintiff’s access to the home. (REC. 2302)
No responses were ever received from Carter on these motions. 74. On
March 26, 2025, an objection was filed to Carter’s consolidation motion in
the 233rd court. REC. 1881. 75. Plaintiff reached out to the coordinator from
the 233rd and went through the process to present the motion to the judge.
REC. 2338-2341. 76. On March 29, 2025, Plaintiff appeared before Associate
Judge Kate Stone, who refused to hear Plaintiff’s emergency motion despite
no response being filed, and told him to leave the courtroom. The hearing
date scheduled for April 10, 2025, as agreed by Carter and Plaintiff (REC.
2358), was actually un-set by Stone. REC. 2361. 77. The grounds for this
outright refusal was due to Carter calling in a favor from the judge without
even being present in the courtroom, to where Stone left the room, came
back, and told the Plaintiff to leave informing him that a motion to
consolidate would be filed by Carter the following week. U. Five Concurrent
Mandamus Petitions 78. Subsequently, after he was turned away from the
courtroom, Carter’s consolidation motion wasn’t filed until April 4, 2025
(REC. 2367), resulting in two mandamus petitions to try again to have the
March 14, 2024, order signed by Kaitcer vacated, and to compel Kate Stone
to hear the emergency TRO. See 25-0361, 25-0367. 79. On the same day the
mandamus was filed against Stone, District Judge Kenneth Newell sua
sponte granted Carter’s consolidation motion in both courts without a
hearing, and without addressing the emergency situation for the children or
the Plaintiff’s objections, leading to a third mandamus proceeding. REC.
2393, See also 25-0378. 80. On April 23, 2025, a notice of trial setting was
served on the parties by defendant Munford in the midst of all of these
issues. REC. 1773. 81. The same day, Plaintiff filed an objection and
requested an emergency stay. REC. 2219. No response was received to this
objection by either Munford or Carter. 82. Two days later on April 25, 2025,
Plaintiff filed his second recusal motion, and amended it on April 28, 2025,
this time only against Munford, and requested that the rules of procedure be
followed, and objected to the involvement of the court coordinator given the
prior recusal’s ambiguity and significant delays caused by her involvement.
REC. 2488 No response to this motion was ever filed from Carter. 83. Baker

=== PAGE 10 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
continued to be involved in the recusal process, this time erroneously
forwarding an order of referral from defendant Kaitcer, who was not named
in the recusal motion. REC. 2615. 84. Plaintiff immediately objected on April
29, 2025, naming two issues: 1) the coordinator was still involved, and 2) the
order of referral sent by Kaitcer was erroneous. REC. 2620. 84. Plaintiff
objected to the order of assignment of John H. Cayce (REC. 3149) which was
issued on May 7, 2025, due to the unresolves issues. REC. 2620. 85. David L.
Evans overruled this objection on May 15, 2025, leading to mandamus
petition 25-0426, a direct appeal to the Texas Supreme Court. REC. 3507.
86. On May 20, 2025, John H. Cayce summarily denied the recusal, including
the denial of a motion to recuse Kaitcer which was never filed, leading to
mandamus petition 25-0458, a second direct appeal to the Texas Supreme
Court. 87. All five petitions were denied both initially and on rehearing, and
all emergency motions to stay proceedings were dismissed. The only insights
given from the appellate courts was: “Denied, per curiam.” No response was
filed by any implicated judge or opposing counsel. V. Federal RICO Case and
the Push Towards Final Trial 88. In June of 2025, Plaintiff amended his
complaint against Daniel Kenneth Branthoover and enjoined Myers as a
defendant, which they defended pro-se. 89. Plaintiff communicated this
action with the trial court, and no further action was taken in the case until
August of 2025, when defendant Munford sua sponte set the case for final
trial on December 10, 2025. 90. Plaintiff immediately objected to this trial
setting, and moved to recuse Munford for a third time. 91. The court
coordinator continued to be involved in the process, leading to a subsequent
motion to recuse the regional presiding judge, David L. Evans. 92. Plaintiff
now prepares this suit to hold defendants accountable for their collective
actions, and to prevent their common goal from being achieved, which is to
obtain defendant Myers a final decree of divorce. 93. For the forthcoming
reasons, the conduct outlined herein constitutes conduct of an enterprise
through a pattern of racketeering activity, as several predicate acts were
committed, the enterprise shares a common purpose, and Plaintiff has
suffered direct and ongoing injury to business and property as a direct result
of the defendant’s collective predicate acts. RICO The timeline and evidence
provided demonstrate that the Myers-Branthoover group constitutes an
association-in-fact enterprise under RICO, with a common goal to deprive
the Plaintiff of his home and business through a pattern of racketeering
activity—specifically, wire fraud, Travel Act violations, and fraudulent court
filings—causing direct injury to the Plaintiff’s business and property. The
conduct, structure, and continuity among the participants, as well as the use
of interstate communications and travel, satisfy the elements of a RICO
claim in the Tenth Circuit, with the liability of other defendants depending
on their knowledge and intent. A. Summary The Myers-Branthoover
enterprise, as detailed in the factual timeline, meets the Tenth Circuit’s
requirements for a RICO claim by establishing an association-in-fact
enterprise with a defined structure, purpose, and continuity. The group’s
coordinated actions—including interstate transfer of funds, preparation and
submission of fraudulent legal documents, and ongoing manipulation of
court proceedings—constitute a pattern of racketeering activity, with
predicate acts of wire fraud and Travel Act violations that are related and
continuous. Plaintiff’s direct and ongoing injury to his business and property,
including loss of home, business operations, and client relationships, is
proximately caused by the enterprise’s acts. While Myers and Branthoover’s

=== PAGE 11 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
liability is clear, the involvement of other defendants (Munford, Kaitcer,
Carter, and Baker) may be characterized as inadvertent or willing
participation, depending on their knowledge and intent, but the core
elements of a RICO violation are satisfied by the conduct of Myers and
Branthoover as outlined in the enumerated timeline. The additional acts
committed by each defendant, as alleged, furthered the scheme of the
enterprise despite each additional defendant having actual knowledge of the
fraudulent scheme. RICO Statutory Framework The Racketeer Influenced
and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), codified at 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961–1968,
provides a civil cause of action for individuals injured in their business or
property by reason of a pattern of racketeering activity conducted through
an enterprise affecting interstate or foreign commerce. The most commonly
invoked provision, § 1962(c), prohibits any person employed by or associated
with an enterprise from conducting or participating in the conduct of such
enterprise’s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity. Section
1962(d) further prohibits conspiracies to violate any of the substantive RICO
provisions. To establish a civil RICO claim under § 1962(c), a plaintiff must
prove: i. The existence of an enterprise; ii. The enterprise’s engagement in,
or effect on, interstate or foreign commerce; iii. The defendant’s
employment by or association with the enterprise; iv. The defendant’s
participation, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of the enterprise’s affairs;
v. The defendant’s participation through a pattern of racketeering activity or
collection of unlawful debt. See 100 Mount Holly Bypass v. Axos Bank, Case
No. 2:20-CV-856-TS-CMR (D. Utah Jul 27, 2021). B. Predicate Acts and
Pattern Requirement RICO defines “racketeering activity” to include a wide
range of criminal offenses, including wire fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343) and
violations of the Travel Act (18 U.S.C. § 1952). A “pattern of racketeering
activity” requires at least two predicate acts within a ten-year period, but
the acts must be related and amount to or pose a threat of continued
criminal activity. The Supreme Court has clarified that a RICO violation
requires both an “enterprise” and a “pattern of racketeering activity,” with
the enterprise being a group of persons associated for a common purpose,
and the pattern involving a series of criminal acts (United States v. Harris,
695 F.3d 1125 (10th Cir. 2012)). The Tenth Circuit has further explained
that, to establish a pattern, it is not enough to simply show that two
predicate acts occurred within ten years; the acts must also be related and
pose a threat of continued criminal activity (U.S. v. Smith, 413 F.3d 1253
(10th Cir. 2005)). Note, however, that U.S. v. Smith has been stated as
overruled by United States v. Nissen, 555 F.Supp.3d 1174 (D. N.M. 2021) on
unrelated grounds, but its articulation of the pattern requirement remains
consistent with current law. C. Enterprise and Association-in-Fact An
“enterprise” under RICO includes any individual, partnership, corporation,
association, or group of individuals associated in fact, even if not a legal
entity. For an association-in-fact enterprise, the Tenth Circuit requires: i. A
purpose; ii. Relationships among those associated with the enterprise; iii.
Longevity sufficient to permit the associates to pursue the enterprise’s
purpose; iv. A decision-making framework or mechanism for controlling the
group; v. Functioning as a continuing unit; vi. Existence separate and apart
from the pattern of racketeering activity. See 100 Mount Holly Bypass. D.
Conspiracy Section 1962(d) makes it unlawful to conspire to violate any of
the substantive RICO provisions. A RICO conspiracy does not require the
establishment of an enterprise but requires that a defendant adopts the goal

=== PAGE 12 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
of furthering or facilitating a criminal endeavor that would satisfy the
elements of a substantive RICO offense (United States v. Martinez, 543
F.Supp.3d 1209 (D. N.M. 2021); United States v. Randall, 661 F.3d 1291
(10th Cir. 2011)). E. Injury Requirement RICO provides a private right of
action for individuals injured in their business or property through
fraudulent conduct, and there is no requirement that the conduct be
connected to organized crime in a civil setting (Plains Resources, Inc. v.
Gable, 782 F.2d 883 (10th Cir. 1986)). ANALYSIS F. Existence of an
Association-in-Fact Enterprise The timeline establishes that Myers and
Branthoover formed an association-in-fact enterprise beginning in December
2023 (¶¶ 1–7, 93). Their collaboration was structured, with Myers as the
petitioner in the divorce and Branthoover as the planner, drafter, and
facilitator of fraudulent documents and financial transactions. The group
had a clear purpose: to divest the Plaintiff of his home and business through
fraudulent legal filings and manipulation of court processes (¶¶ 1–7, 93).
The enterprise’s structure is evidenced by: i. The initial planning and
agreement to meet in Yukon, Oklahoma, to draft fraudulent documents (¶¶
1–3); ii. The use of interstate communications and travel to further the
scheme (¶¶ 2–3); iii. Ongoing coordination and adaptation to changing
circumstances, including the preparation and submission of false affidavits
and pleadings, and manipulation of court proceedings (¶¶ 5–7, 34, 93). This
satisfies the Tenth Circuit’s requirements for an association-in-fact
enterprise, which does not require a formal legal entity but does require a
common purpose, relationships, and sufficient longevity to pursue the
enterprise’s goals. G. Structure, Purpose, Relationships, and Continuity The
Myers-Branthoover group meets the requirements for an association-in-fact
enterprise: i. Purpose: The shared goal was to deprive the Plaintiff of his
home, business, and property interests through fraudulent means (¶¶ 1–7,
93). ii. Relationships: Myers and Branthoover maintained ongoing
communications, coordinated actions, and divided roles in the scheme (¶¶ 1–
7, 93). iii. Longevity and Continuity: The enterprise operated over a
substantial period, from at least December 2023 through present day 2025,
with multiple related acts and ongoing adaptation to changing
circumstances (¶¶ 1–93). iv. Decision-Making Framework: The group
planned, agreed on steps, and executed those steps in a coordinated manner
(¶¶ 1–7, 93). v. Existence Separate from Predicate Acts: The enterprise was
formed for the purpose of achieving a specific goal and engaged in multiple
acts over time to accomplish that goal. H. Predicate Acts: Wire Fraud, Travel
Act Violations, and Fraudulent Filings The timeline identifies multiple
predicate acts that qualify as racketeering activity under RICO: i. Wire
Fraud: Myers transferred $1,576 in marital funds to Branthoover’s PayPal
account during interstate travel, and these funds were used to purchase a
phone for use in the fraudulent scheme (¶¶ 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 34). The use of
electronic communications (text messages, emails) to plan and execute the
scheme further supports the wire fraud allegation (¶¶ 1–7, 34). ii. Travel Act
Violations: Myers traveled from Texas to Oklahoma to meet with
Branthoover, where they planned and prepared fraudulent legal documents,
which were then transported back to Texas and submitted to the court (¶¶ 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, 7). iii. Fraudulent Filings: The preparation and submission of false
affidavits and pleadings to the court, containing material misrepresentations
about financial status, family violence, and property ownership, constitute
further predicate acts (¶¶ 5, 6, 7, 34). At least two related predicate acts

=== PAGE 13 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
within ten years are required (U.S. v. Smith, 413 F.3d 1253 (10th Cir. 2005)),
and the timeline shows multiple, related predicate acts over a substantial
period (¶¶ 1–93). I. Pattern of Racketeering Activity: Relatedness and
Continuity The predicate acts were not isolated incidents but part of an
ongoing scheme. The acts were related in that they all aimed to deprive the
Plaintiff of his property and business, and they posed a threat of continued
criminal activity, as the enterprise continued to operate and adapt its tactics
over time (¶¶ 1–93). The timeline shows that the enterprise’s activities
extended over a substantial period, with multiple acts occurring over
months and involving ongoing coordination and adaptation to changing
circumstances. J. Injury to Business or Property Plaintiff suffered direct and
ongoing injury to his business and property as a result of the enterprise’s
actions. He was deprived of his home and business operations, lost access to
marital funds, and was unable to provide services to clients, resulting in
financial harm (¶¶ 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 37). These injuries are precisely the type
of harm RICO is designed to redress. Plains Resources, Inc. v. Gable, 782 F.
2d 883 (10th Cir. 1986)). K. Participation of Other Defendants: Inadvertent
or Willing The timeline raises the question of whether Munford, Kaitcer,
Carter, and Baker were victims of the initial scheme or willing participants
in the expanded enterprise. The evidence suggests that, at a minimum,
Myers and Branthoover were the core members of the enterprise, with
others potentially becoming involved through their actions in the legal
proceedings (¶¶ 14–93). i. Inadvertent Participation: Some defendants may
have participated inadvertently, such as by issuing orders or facilitating
court processes without knowledge of the underlying scheme (¶¶ 14–93). ii.
Willing Participation: Others may have become willing participants if they
knowingly furthered the enterprise’s objectives or ignored clear evidence of
fraud and misrepresentation (¶¶ 14–93). RICO does not impose liability for
inadvertent or unwitting participation; there must be knowing and willful
involvement in the conduct of the enterprise’s affairs. For the forthcoming
reasons, Plaintiff alleges that the Defendants are willing participants in the
scheme. VICTIM OR PARTICIPANT RICO liability extends to those who
knowingly participate in the conduct of the enterprise’s affairs, even if they
were not original members (RICO: A Primer (2022-01-31)). The timeline
raises the question of whether Munford, Kaitcer, Carter, and Baker were
victims of the initial scheme or willing participants in the expanded
enterprise. The evidence suggests that, at a minimum, Myers and
Branthoover were the core members of the enterprise, with others becoming
involved through their actions in the legal proceedings (¶¶ 14–93). The
timeline demonstrates that Carter, Kaitcer, and Myers engaged in extortion
by leveraging the threat of adverse legal action, fraudulent court orders, and
the manipulation of judicial process to coerce Plaintiff into relinquishing
property and business interests, satisfying the elements of extortion as a
predicate act under RICO and the Travel Act. Munford and Baker, for their
part, committed wire fraud by intentionally sending altered or incomplete
court documents via interstate email, with the intent to mislead, obstruct
relief, and further the enterprise’s objective of finalizing the divorce and
depriving Plaintiff of his property, thus meeting the requirements for wire
fraud as a RICO predicate act. These acts, as detailed in the timeline, are
not isolated but part of a coordinated pattern of racketeering activity within
an association-in-fact enterprise, as required by RICO in the Tenth Circuit.
The conduct of each defendant is tied to specific predicate acts—extortion

=== PAGE 14 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
for Carter, Kaitcer, and Myers (notably at timeline events 33–37), and wire
fraud for Munford and Baker (notably at events 54–59, 83)—demonstrating
knowing and willful participation in the enterprise’s broader scheme to
deprive Plaintiff of his home and business through fraudulent and coercive
means. A. Extortion and Wire Fraud The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961–1968, provides a civil cause of
action for injury to business or property caused by a pattern of racketeering
activity conducted through an enterprise affecting interstate commerce.
Predicate acts under RICO include extortion (as defined by the Hobbs Act
and the Travel Act) and wire fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343), among others.
Extortion is defined as obtaining property from another, with his consent,
induced by wrongful use of actual or threatened force, violence, or fear, or
under color of official right. The Travel Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1952, includes
extortion as an “unlawful activity” and does not require it to be part of a
business enterprise (U.S. v. Welch, 327 F.3d 1081 (10th Cir. 2003)). The
Tenth Circuit recognizes that extortion under the Travel Act can be
established by showing threats or coercion to obtain something of value,
including property or legal rights, in violation of state or federal law. Wire
fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343 requires (1) a scheme to defraud or obtain
property by false or fraudulent pretenses, (2) intent to defraud, and (3) use
of interstate wire communications to execute the scheme (Clinton v. Sec.
Benefit Life Ins. Co., 63 F.4th 1264 (10th Cir. 2023); United States v.
Holloway, 826 F.3d 1237 (10th Cir. 2016)). The Tenth Circuit requires that
the deprivation of property be a central object of the scheme, and that the
use of wires (including email) be knowing and in furtherance of the
fraudulent scheme (United States v. Tao, 629 F.Supp.3d 1083). B. Extortion
by Carter, Kaitcer, and Myers Extortion, as a RICO predicate act, is defined
broadly under federal law and the Travel Act. It includes obtaining property
or rights through threats, coercion, or misuse of official process (U.S. v.
Welch, 327 F.3d 1081 (10th Cir. 2003)). The Tenth Circuit does not require
extortion to be part of a business enterprise for Travel Act purposes; a single
act suffices if it has the requisite interstate nexus. The timeline shows the
following: i. Event 33–34: Carter, with Myers, prepared and presented
“Temporary Orders” that misrepresented facts (e.g., that Plaintiff agreed to
terms he did not, that a hearing occurred when it did not, and that the
orders were in the best interests of the children). These orders altered the
dates of access to the home to shield Myers from liability for locking Plaintiff
out, and were presented to Plaintiff in a context where he was under threat
of losing his home and business. iii. Event 36: Kaitcer, knowing the orders
were disputed and that no response had been filed, signed an associate
judge’s report pre-drafted by Carter, summarily denying Plaintiff’s
emergency motion and ordering Plaintiff to sign the disputed document,
despite his objections and lack of consent. iv. Event 35: Plaintiff refused to
sign the orders for multiple reasons, including their fraudulent content and
the lack of due process, but the orders were rendered into effect without his
signature. These acts collectively demonstrate the use of legal process and
the threat of adverse judicial action to coerce Plaintiff into surrendering his
property and business interests. The manipulation of court orders, the
misrepresentation of facts, and the pressure to sign under threat of losing
his home constitute extortion under the Travel Act and RICO (U.S. v. Welch,
327 F.3d 1081 (10th Cir. 2003). Myers’s role is clear: she was the beneficiary
and instigator of the fraudulent filings and the manipulation of court

=== PAGE 15 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
process, using the threat of legal action and the actual deprivation of
Plaintiff’s property to achieve her goal. Carter and Kaitcer acted in concert
with Myers, knowingly facilitating the extortion by preparing, presenting,
and enforcing fraudulent orders, and by using the authority of the court to
coerce Plaintiff. The fact that Plaintiff was ordered to sign a document he
objected to, under threat of continued deprivation of his home and business,
is classic extortion by color of official right. All three defendants knew that
Plaintiff did not agree to the order, as he had just fired his attorney to
challenge any basis for an agreement. This implies that despite the motion
being served on all defendants, they chose to ignore the allegations of a
fraudulent scheme and further the affairs of the enterprise. These actions
meet the requirements for extortion as a RICO predicate act: they involved
the wrongful use of threats and official process to obtain property (the home
and business) from Plaintiff, with his consent induced by fear of further loss
or legal harm. The acts were not isolated but part of a coordinated scheme
to achieve the enterprise’s goal of finalizing the divorce and divesting
Plaintiff of his property B. Wire Fraud by Munford and Baker Wire fraud
under 18 U.S.C. § 1343 requires a scheme to defraud, intent to defraud, and
use of interstate wire communications to execute the scheme (Clinton v. Sec.
Benefit Life Ins. Co., 63 F.4th 1264 (10th Cir. 2023); United States v.
Holloway, 826 F.3d 1237 (10th Cir. 2016)). The Tenth Circuit recognizes that
sending altered or incomplete court documents via email, with the intent to
mislead or deprive someone of property or rights, can constitute wire fraud
if the deprivation of property is a central object of the scheme (United
States v. Tao, 629 F.Supp.3d 1083). The timeline shows the following: i.
Event 54: Munford signed and forwarded a “Joint Motion to Recuse”
attached to his order of referral, but the document was missing critical
exhibits and affidavits necessary for Plaintiff’s relief. ii. Event 55: Baker sent
a copy of this incomplete filing via email, representing it as the full
document. iii. Event 56–57: When Plaintiff pointed out the discrepancies,
Baker provided inconsistent explanations, first claiming the full document
was e-filed, then later stating it was split into three parts due to size. iv.
Event 58: Munford signed and filed an “Amended Order of Referral” with the
full motion attached, but with hyperlinks and bookmarks removed, further
impairing the document’s integrity. v. Event 59, 83: Baker continued to
forward altered or incomplete orders and referrals, even when procedural
irregularities were raised. These acts involved the knowing use of interstate
email to transmit altered or incomplete court documents, with the intent to
prevent Plaintiff from obtaining relief and to further the enterprise’s goal of
finalizing the divorce and depriving Plaintiff of his property. The use of email
to transmit these documents satisfies the interstate wire requirement, and
the intent to defraud is evidenced by the deliberate alteration and
misrepresentation of the filings. The conduct of Munford and Baker meets
the elements of wire fraud: (1) a scheme to defraud Plaintiff of property and
rights, (2) intent to defraud by preventing relief and misleading the court
and Plaintiff, and (3) use of interstate wire communications (email) to
execute the scheme (Clinton v. Sec. Benefit Life Ins. Co., 63 F.4th 1264 (10th
Cir. 2023)). The deprivation of property (Plaintiff’s home and business) was
a central object of the scheme, not a minor part. RELATIONSHIP AND
CONTINUITY All these acts—extortion by Carter, Kaitcer, and Myers, and
wire fraud by Munford and Baker—were committed in furtherance of the
Myers-Branthoover enterprise’s overarching objective: to finalize the

=== PAGE 16 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
divorce and divest Plaintiff of his home and business. The acts were
coordinated, continuous, and related, satisfying the RICO pattern
requirement. The timeline shows that each defendant’s conduct was not an
isolated error or routine administrative act, but part of a deliberate scheme
to use the legal process, threats, and fraudulent communications to achieve
the enterprise’s unlawful goals. DAMAGES The harm inflicted upon Plaintiff
is staggering. He has lost the home in which he lived for nearly a third of his
life, the companionship of his spouse, and the society of his children. His
income has collapsed. For two years he has been consigned to a futile
appellate gauntlet, even as Defendants Munford, Kaitcer, Baker, and Carter
have repeatedly exceeded the bounds of their lawful authority in furtherance
of a broader scheme. What began as a concerted effort by Myers and
Branthoover to dispossess Plaintiff of his residence and property
metastasized into a calculated plan to procure a final decree of divorce once
the initial objective had been achieved. The objective was plain: by
engineering a final decree, Defendants would not only hobble Plaintiff’s
ability to bring this suit but also invite invocation of the Rooker–Feldman
doctrine and related abstention principles to preclude federal jurisdiction.
Now, after two years of unremitting effort, Plaintiff seeks the only
meaningful remedy remaining: federal redress to halt the ongoing abuses of
authority, to unwind tainted actions, and to compensate him fully for the
catastrophic losses Defendants have wrought. Take each piece in the TABLE
OF CONTENTS, research the topic, and tie it to the factual timeline, filling
out each element of the RICO complaint and tie each element to the factual
allegations by enumerated paragraph number. What are the pleading
requirements for state law claims (fraud, abuse of process, intentional
infliction of emotional distress, and related claims) in a federal RICO
complaint in the Fifth Circuit, and how should these be tied to the factual
record?
Answer (Fifth Circuit)
Short response
In the Fifth Circuit, state law claims such as fraud, abuse of process, and
intentional infliction of emotional distress included in a federal RICO
complaint must meet the general plausibility standard of Rule 8(a) and, for
fraud-based claims, the heightened particularity requirements of Rule 9(b),
which demand detailed factual allegations tied to the specific elements of
each claim. Each element must be supported by specific facts from the
record, including the "who, what, when, where, and how" of the alleged
conduct, and must be clearly linked to the enumerated factual timeline in
the complaint.
Summary
Federal RICO complaints in the Fifth Circuit that include state law claims
must comply with both the general pleading requirements of Rule 8(a) and,
for fraud or fraud-like claims, the heightened standards of Rule 9(b). This
means that for each state law claim—such as fraud, abuse of process, or

=== PAGE 17 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
intentional infliction of emotional distress—the complaint must set out
specific, non-conclusory facts that support every element of the claim, and
for fraud, must detail the circumstances of the alleged misconduct with
particularity.
To properly plead these claims, the complaint should explicitly connect each
factual allegation to the relevant element of the cause of action, referencing
the timeline and record citations (e.g., "REC. [page]"). For fraud, this
includes identifying the speaker, the content and timing of the
misrepresentation, and the resulting harm; for abuse of process and
intentional infliction of emotional distress, the complaint must similarly
provide detailed facts showing each required element, ensuring that the
allegations are not merely formulaic but are substantiated by the record.
Background and Relevant Law
Federal Pleading Standards: Rule 8(a) and Rule 9(b)
All federal complaints must satisfy Rule 8(a), which requires a "short and
plain statement" showing entitlement to relief, supported by factual
allegations that make the claim plausible rather than speculative. This
standard, articulated in Twombly and Iqbal, requires more than labels,
conclusions, or a formulaic recitation of elements; the complaint must
provide enough factual content to allow the court to reasonably infer liability
(Belton v. Regions Bank; Clapper v. Am. Realty Investors, Inc. (2018); Arruda
v. Curves Int'l, Inc.).
For claims sounding in fraud—including common law fraud, statutory fraud,
and claims under the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act (TDTPA)—Rule
9(b) imposes a heightened standard. The complaint must state with
particularity the circumstances constituting fraud, which the Fifth Circuit
interprets as requiring the "who, what, when, where, and how" of the
alleged fraud (Cloud49, LLC v. Rackspace Tech.; United Healthcare Sevices,
Inc. v. Next Health, LLC (2021); AHBP LLC v. The Lynd Co.; Fonseca v.
Allstate Vehicle & Prop. Ins. Co.). This means specifying the statements or
omissions considered fraudulent, the identity of the speaker, the time and
place of the statements, and what was obtained as a result.
Elements of State Law Claims
Fraud
To plead fraud under Texas law, the plaintiff must allege: (1) a material
misrepresentation; (2) falsity; (3) knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard;
(4) intent to induce reliance; (5) actual and justifiable reliance; and (6)
resulting injury (Sw. Marine & Gen. Ins. Co. v. Valentine; Everhart v.
CitiMortgage, Inc.; Related State Torts). Each of these elements must be
supported by specific facts, and for Rule 9(b), the circumstances of the
misrepresentation must be detailed.

=== PAGE 18 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Abuse of Process
While not subject to Rule 9(b) unless the gravamen is fraud, abuse of
process claims must still meet Rule 8(a)'s plausibility standard. The
elements typically include: (1) an illegal, improper, or perverted use of the
process; (2) an ulterior motive or purpose; and (3) resulting damage. The
complaint must allege facts showing how the process was misused and the
harm caused.
Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress
To state a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress under Texas
law, the plaintiff must allege: (1) intentional or reckless conduct; (2) that is
extreme and outrageous; (3) causing emotional distress; and (4) the distress
is severe (Dean v. Ford Motor Credit Co.; Related State Torts). The conduct
must be more than mere insults or annoyances; it must be so outrageous as
to go beyond all possible bounds of decency.
Analysis
Application of Pleading Standards to the Factual Timeline
I. Jurisdiction and Venue; II. Parties; III. Record References
The complaint must begin by establishing federal subject matter jurisdiction
(e.g., under RICO, 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c)), personal jurisdiction over each
defendant, and proper venue. The parties must be clearly identified, and the
complaint should reference the public records and judicially noticeable
documents, as permitted in the Fifth Circuit (Miller v. Dunn; LUV N' Care,
Ltd. v. Jackel Int'l Ltd.).
IV. Introduction; V. Factual Timeline
The introduction and factual timeline should set out the narrative, but to
meet Rule 8(a) and 9(b), each material fact must be tied to the elements of
the claims. For example, the timeline's description of the Myers-Branthoover
enterprise (¶¶ 1–7) should be cross-referenced in the fraud and RICO
sections, with each misrepresentation or act of extortion specifically
identified by date, content, and actor.
VI. The RICO Enterprise
The complaint must allege the existence of an enterprise, its structure,
purpose, and continuity, and the roles of each defendant. The factual
timeline (e.g., Myers and Branthoover's planning, interstate travel, and
document preparation) should be cited to show the enterprise's existence
and operation, as required for a RICO claim (Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy).

=== PAGE 19 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
VII. Predicate Acts
Each predicate act (wire fraud, extortion, Travel Act violation, fraudulent
court filings) must be described with particularity. For wire fraud, the
complaint should specify the date, content, and method of each fraudulent
communication (e.g., Myers's transfer of funds to Branthoover's PayPal
account on December 16, 2023, REC. 723, 728-730), and explain how it
furthered the scheme. For extortion, the complaint should detail the threats
or misuse of legal process (e.g., Carter and Kaitcer's actions in presenting
and enforcing fraudulent orders, REC. 888, 795).
VIII. RICO Conspiracy
The complaint must allege facts showing an agreement among the
defendants to further the enterprise's unlawful goals, and identify overt acts
in furtherance of the conspiracy, referencing the timeline (e.g., joint
preparation of documents, coordinated court actions).
IX. Potential Defenses
The complaint should anticipate and address potential defenses, such as
preclusion, Rooker-Feldman, Younger abstention, and judicial immunity, by
alleging facts that show why these doctrines do not bar the claims (e.g.,
ongoing injury, lack of final judgment, or acts outside the scope of judicial
immunity).
X. State Law Claims
A. Fraud
For each alleged fraudulent act, the complaint must specify:
Who made the misrepresentation (e.g., Myers, Branthoover, Carter,
Kaitcer, Munford, Baker);
What was said or omitted (e.g., false statements in affidavits, court
filings, or emails);
When and where the statement was made (e.g., December 18, 2023,
original petition for divorce, REC. 86, 99, 102, 107);
Why the statement was false (e.g., evidence to the contrary, REC. 1715,
1735);
What the defendant obtained (e.g., removal of Plaintiff from home,
control of business assets).
Each element of fraud must be supported by specific facts from the record,
not merely conclusions (Sw. Marine & Gen. Ins. Co. v. Valentine; Cloud49,
LLC v. Rackspace Tech.; Unitedhealthcare Servs., Inc. v. Next Health, LLC
(2018)).

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
B. Abuse of Process
The complaint must allege facts showing that the defendants used legal
process (e.g., court orders, motions, or filings) for an improper purpose,
such as to coerce Plaintiff into relinquishing property or to obstruct relief.
The timeline should be referenced to show specific instances (e.g., use of
temporary orders to lock Plaintiff out of his home, REC. 1748, 888, 795).
C. Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress
The complaint must allege facts showing that the defendants' conduct was
intentional or reckless, extreme and outrageous, and caused severe
emotional distress. The timeline should be used to show the cumulative
effect of the defendants' actions (e.g., repeated deprivation of home and
business, interference with parent-child relationship, and ongoing litigation
harassment, REC. 183, 888, 1748, 1629-1631, 3281).
D. Other State Law Claims
For any additional state law claims, the complaint must set out the elements
and tie each to specific facts in the record, ensuring that the allegations are
not conclusory.
XI. Claims for Relief; XII. Damages; XIII. Prayer for Relief
The complaint should specify the relief sought, including compensatory,
treble, and punitive damages, as well as injunctive and declaratory relief.
The damages section should tie the claimed losses to the specific acts and
injuries described in the timeline (e.g., loss of home, business income, and
client relationships).
Tying Allegations to the Factual Record
To satisfy the pleading standards, each element of each claim must be
supported by specific factual allegations, with references to the record (e.g.,
"REC. [page]"). For fraud, this means identifying the precise
misrepresentation, the context, and the resulting harm. For abuse of process
and intentional infliction of emotional distress, the complaint must detail the
conduct, the improper purpose or outrageousness, and the resulting injury.
The complaint should avoid group or collective allegations; instead, it must
specify which defendant is responsible for each act (Fonseca v. Allstate
Vehicle & Prop. Ins. Co.). This individualized pleading is essential to give
each defendant fair notice and to prevent dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6).
Exceptions and Caveats
If the complaint fails to plead fraud with particularity, or if it relies on
conclusory or collective allegations, it is subject to dismissal (Ripley v.
State Farm Lloyds; Aviles v. Allstate Fire & Cas., Ins. Co.).
• 

=== PAGE 21 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
For claims not sounding in fraud, Rule 8(a) still requires factual
allegations that make the claim plausible, not speculative.
For intentional infliction of emotional distress, courts in the Fifth
Circuit have set a high bar for what constitutes "extreme and
outrageous" conduct (Bordelon v. Wells Fargo Fin. La., LLC).
Conclusion
In a federal RICO complaint in the Fifth Circuit, state law claims such as
fraud, abuse of process, and intentional infliction of emotional distress must
be pleaded with specificity and factual detail. Fraud-based claims must meet
Rule 9(b)'s heightened standard, requiring the "who, what, when, where,
and how" of the alleged misconduct, while all claims must satisfy Rule 8(a)'s
plausibility requirement. Each element of each claim must be tied to specific
facts in the record, with individualized allegations against each defendant,
ensuring that the complaint provides fair notice and a clear basis for relief.
Failure to meet these standards risks dismissal at the pleading stage.
Legal Authorities
Douglas v. Renola Equity Fund II, LLC, CIVIL ACTION NO: 13-6192 (E.D. La.
Mar 14, 2014)
U.S. District Court — Eastern District of Louisiana
Extract
To survive a Rule 12 (b)(6) motion to dismiss, the plaintiff must plead
enough facts to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.' Ashcroft
v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550
U.S. 544, 570 (2007)). A claim is facially plausible 'when the plaintiff pleads
factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that
the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.' Id. A court must accept
all well-pleaded facts as true and must draw all reasonable inferences in
favor of the plaintiff. Lormand v. U.S. Unwired, Inc., 565 F.3d 228, 239 (5th
Cir. 2009). ... The requirements of Rule 9(b) are 'supplemental to the
Supreme Court's recent interpretation of Rule 8(a) requiring enough facts
[taken as true] to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.' Lentz v.
Trinchard, 730 F. Supp. 2d 567, 579 (E.D. La. 2010) (citing Grubbs, 565 F.3d
at 185) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570). Further, a plaintiff may plead
fraud ''upon information and belief'' only when the relevant facts are
peculiarly within the opposing party's knowledge, and the plaintiff supports
his allegations with an adequate factual basis.
Summary
Pleading requirements for fraud claims in federal court, emphasizing the
need for specificity under Rule 9(b) and the general plausibility standard
under Rule 8(a) as interpreted by the Supreme Court. It highlights that
fraud must be pled with particularity, and claims must be plausible on their

face, allowing the court to infer liability. This is relevant to the question as it
provides the standard for pleading state law claims in a federal RICO
complaint, which would include fraud, abuse of process, and intentional
infliction of emotional distress.
Bordelon v. Wells Fargo Fin. La., LLC, CIVIL ACTION No. 18-2563 SECTION
I (E.D. La. Jul 25, 2018)
U.S. District Court — Eastern District of Louisiana
Extract
The Wells Fargo defendants move to dismiss pro se plaintiff Donald W.
Bordelon's ('Bordelon') claims for violation of the Racketeer Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations Act ('RICO'), fraud, and intentional infliction of
emotional distress pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). ...
Other sections of this Court have dismissed lawsuits alleging intentional
infliction of emotional distress based on conduct similar to or more
egregious than filing a lawsuit and sending demand letters. For example, the
Court granted summary judgment in favor of a defendant with respect to the
plaintiff's intentional infliction of emotional distress claims in a case in
which the plaintiff alleged that the defendant improperly initiated wage
garnishment proceedings against him. Murungi v. Tex. Guaranteed, 693 F.
Supp. 2d 597, 607 (E.D. La. Feb. 18, 2010) (Vance, J.). The plaintiff also
alleged that he received 'harassing and embarrassing' phone calls from the
defendant, yet that was not enough to meet the standard for outrageous
conduct.
Summary
For a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress to succeed, the
conduct must meet a high standard of outrageousness. The court has
dismissed claims where the conduct was not sufficiently outrageous, even if
it involved improper legal actions or harassing communications. This
suggests that in the Fifth Circuit, plaintiffs must demonstrate conduct that is
extreme and outrageous to meet the pleading requirements for intentional
infliction of emotional distress.
Everhart v. CitiMortgage, Inc., CIVIL ACTION H-12-1338 (S.D. Tex. Jan 22,
2013)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of Texas
Extract
To state a claim for fraud under Texas law a plaintiff must allege (1) that the
defendant made a representation to the plaintiff, (2) that the representation
was material, (3) that the representation was false, (4) that when the

=== PAGE 23 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
misrepresentation was made the defendant knew it was false or made it
recklessly and without knowledge of its truth, (5) that the defendant made it
with the intent that the plaintiff act on it, (6) that the plaintiff relied on the
representation, and (7) that the representation caused injury to the plaintiff.
Summary
Specific elements required to plead a fraud claim under Texas law, which is
relevant to the Fifth Circuit. These elements include making a
representation, its materiality, falsity, knowledge of its falsity, intent for the
plaintiff to act on it, reliance by the plaintiff, and resulting injury. This
information is essential for understanding how to properly plead a fraud
claim in a federal RICO complaint when state law claims are involved.
Cummings v. Wells Fargo, N.A., CIVIL ACTION NO. 1:18-CV-72-SA-DAS (N.D.
Miss. Jan 11, 2019)
U.S. District Court — Northern District of Mississippi
Extract
The Plaintiff asserts various fraud-based claims against the Defendant,
including fraudulent misrepresentation, constructive fraud, fraudulent
inducement, fraudulent deceit, and fraudulent conveyance. In addition to the
standard articulated by the Supreme Court in Iqbal and Twombly, Rule 9(b)
of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires that, '[i]n alleging fraud or
mistake, a party must state with particularity the circumstances constituting
fraud or mistake.'
Summary
When pleading fraud-based claims in federal court, including in the Fifth
Circuit, the plaintiff must meet the heightened pleading standard of Rule
9(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. This rule requires that the
circumstances constituting fraud or mistake be stated with particularity.
This means that the plaintiff must specify the who, what, when, where, and
how of the alleged fraud. This requirement is in addition to the general
pleading standards set by the Supreme Court in Iqbal and Twombly, which
require that a complaint state a plausible claim for relief.
Quintel Tech. Ltd. v. Huawei Techs. USA, Inc., CIVIL ACTION NO. 4:15-
cv-00307-GHD-CMC (E.D. Tex. Sep 27, 2016)
U.S. District Court — Eastern District of Texas

=== PAGE 24 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
The Court 'applies a four-prong test for fraudulent concealment under Texas
law, under which the plaintiff must demonstrate: '(1) the existence of the
underlying tort; (2) the defendant's knowledge of the tort; (3) the
defendant's use of deception to conceal the tort; and (4) the plaintiff's
reasonable reliance on the deception.'
Summary
Clear framework for establishing a claim of fraudulent concealment under
Texas law, which is relevant to the pleading requirements for state law
claims in a federal RICO complaint. The four-prong test requires
demonstrating the existence of the underlying tort, the defendant's
knowledge, the use of deception, and the plaintiff's reliance on the
deception. This framework can be used to tie the factual record to the legal
requirements for fraud claims in the context of a RICO complaint.
Gabriel v. Outlaw, CASE NO. 3:20-CV-60-E-BK (N.D. Tex. Mar 01, 2021)
U.S. District Court — Northern District of Texas
Extract
Plaintiffs also claim Nation, through the same ostensibly illegal acts alleged
in their RICO claim, intentionally inflicted emotional distress on them. Doc.
3 at 15. Nation argues the claim should be dismissed because Plaintiffs have
not plausibly alleged facts to establish the essential elements of this tort.
Doc. 8 at 15. To plausibly allege IIED under Texas law, a plaintiff must
establish that (1) a person acted intentionally or recklessly, (2) the person's
conduct was extreme or outrageous, (3) the conduct caused the plaintiff's
emotional distress, and (4) the distress was severe. Guthrie v. Tifco Ind., 941
F.2d 374, 379 (5th Cir. 1991). The bar for extreme or outrageous conduct is
high. Tortious or otherwise wrongful conduct does not, by itself, satisfy this
element. Bradford v. Vento, 48 S.W.3d 749, 758 (Tex. 2001). To be sufficient,
the alleged conduct must be so outrageous in character, so extreme in
degree, as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency and be regarded as
atrocious and utterly intolerable in civilized society. Id. Plaintiffs' allegations
do not come close to meeting this high bar.
Summary
To successfully plead a claim for IIED under Texas law in the Fifth Circuit, a
plaintiff must establish four elements: intentional or reckless conduct,
extreme or outrageous conduct, causation of emotional distress, and
severity of the distress. The standard for what constitutes extreme or
outrageous conduct is very high, requiring conduct that is beyond all
possible bounds of decency. This passage provides guidance on the pleading

requirements for IIED, which is relevant to understanding how state law
claims should be articulated in a federal RICO complaint.
Cloud49, LLC v. Rackspace Tech.
U.S. District Court — Western District of Texas
Extract
When evaluating a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Rule
12(b)(6) the complaint must be liberally construed in favor of the plaintiff
and all facts pleaded therein must be taken as true. Leatherman v. Tarrant
Cnty. Narcotics Intelligence & Coordination Unit, 507 U.S. 163, 164 (1993);
Baker v. Putnal, 75 F.3d 190, 196 (5th Cir. 1996). Although Federal Rule of
Civil Procedure 8 mandates only that a pleading contain a “short and plain
statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief,” this
standard demands more than unadorned accusations, “labels and
conclusions,” “a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action,” or
“naked assertion[s]” devoid of “further factual enhancement.” ... To the
extent a complaint alleges claims sounding in fraud, Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 9(b) requires that plaintiffs go a step beyond the typical pleading
standard: the underlying factual circumstances must be pleaded “with
particularity.” FED. R. CIV. P. 9(b). “Put simply, Rule 9(b) requires ‘the who,
what, when, where, and how' to be laid out.” Benchmark Elecs. v. J.M. Huber
Corp., 343 F.3d 719, 724 (5th Cir. 2003) (citing Williams v. WMX Techs., Inc.,
112 F.3d 175, 179 (5th Cir. 1997)). Rule 9(b) requires that “[i]n alleging
fraud or mistake, a party must state with particularity the circumstances
constituting fraud or mistake. Malice, intent, knowledge, and other
conditions of a person's mind may be alleged generally.” While
“particularity” varies with the circumstances of each case, Rule 9(b)
generally requires specificity of the time, place, contents, and the identity of
the person making false representations. Benchmark Elecs., Inc., 343 F.3d at
724; WMX Techs., Inc., 112 F.3d at 179 (requiring the “who, what, when,
where, and how” of the alleged fraud be stated).
Summary
Pleading requirements under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 8 and 9(b) for
claims, especially those sounding in fraud. Rule 8 requires a "short and plain
statement" of the claim, while Rule 9(b) requires fraud claims to be stated
with particularity, detailing the "who, what, when, where, and how" of the
alleged fraud. This is crucial for tying the factual record to the claims in a
RICO complaint.
Grupo Tava, LLC v. DMS Co., CIVIL ACTION NO. 4:20-CV-4133 (S.D. Tex.
Apr 12, 2021)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of Texas

=== PAGE 26 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
Rule 9(b) states that, '[i]n alleging fraud or mistake, a party must state with
particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake. Malice, intent,
knowledge, and other conditions of a person's mind may be alleged
generally.' Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b). The particularity required for such pleading,
however, varies from case to case. See Benchmark Elec., Inc. v. J.M. Huber
Corp., 343 F.3d 719, 724 (5th Cir. 2003), modified on other grounds, 355 F.
3d 356 (5th Cir. 2003). 'At a minimum, Rule 9(b) requires allegations of the
particulars of time, place, and contents of the false representations, as well
as the identity of the person making the misrepresentation and what he
obtained thereby.' Id. at 724 (internal citations omitted). More precisely,
Rule 9(b)'s particularity requirement compels that 'the who, what, when,
where, and how [] be laid out.' Id. 'Claims alleging... fraud [and] fraudulent
inducement... are subject to [Rule 9(b)'s] requirements.' Frith v. Guardian
Life Ins. Co. of Am., 9 F.Supp.2d 734, 742 (S.D. Tex. 1998).
Summary
In the Fifth Circuit, when alleging fraud or mistake in a federal RICO
complaint, the plaintiff must adhere to the heightened pleading standard of
Rule 9(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. This rule requires that the
circumstances constituting fraud be stated with particularity, which includes
detailing the time, place, and contents of the false representations, the
identity of the person making the misrepresentation, and what was obtained
as a result. This ensures that the allegations are specific enough to provide
the defendant with notice of the claims against them and to prevent
frivolous claims.
Arruda v. Curves Int'l, Inc., No. 20-50734 (5th Cir. Jun 28, 2021)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
The complaint must provide the grounds entitling the Plaintiffs to relief,
'requir[ing] more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of
the elements of a cause of action will not do.' Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550
U.S. 544, 555 (2007). It must state a plausible claim for relief — one that
may be inferred from the complaint's factual allegations. Ashcroft v. Iqbal,
556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). Because Plaintiffs here rely on fraud as the
predicate act for RICO, their complaint is subject to the heightened pleading
standard of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b), requiring a plaintiff to
'state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud.'
Summary
General pleading requirements for a federal RICO complaint, emphasizing
the need for more than mere labels and conclusions. It highlights the

=== PAGE 27 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
necessity of stating a plausible claim for relief based on factual allegations.
Specifically, when fraud is a predicate act, the complaint must meet the
heightened pleading standard of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b), which
requires particularity in stating the circumstances constituting fraud. This is
relevant to the question as it provides guidance on how to plead state law
claims like fraud within a RICO complaint.
Fustok v. UnitedHealth Grp., Inc., CIVIL ACTION NO. 12-cv-787 (S.D. Tex.
May 20, 2013)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of Texas
Extract
United's fraud claim is subject to the heightened pleading requirements of
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b). Rule 9(b) requires a plaintiff to 'state
with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake.' In the
Fifth Circuit, the Rule 9(b) standard requires 'specificity as to the
statements (or omissions) considered to be fraudulent, the speaker, when
and why the statements were made, and an explanation of why they were
fraudulent.' Plotkin v. IP Axess, Inc., 407 F.3d 690, 696 (5th Cir. 2005); see
also Southland Secs. Corp. v. Inspire Ins. Solutions, Inc., 365 F.3d 353, 362
(5th Cir.2004). Essentially, the standard requires the complaint to allege
answers to 'newspaper questions' ('who, what, when, where, and how') of
the alleged fraud.
Summary
Fraud claims in the Fifth Circuit must meet the heightened pleading
requirements of Rule 9(b), which demands specificity in detailing the
fraudulent acts. This includes identifying the fraudulent statements or
omissions, the speaker, the timing, the reasons for the statements, and why
they are fraudulent. This standard is applicable to fraud claims in federal
court within the Fifth Circuit.
Gonzalez v. State Farm Lloyds, 326 F.Supp.3d 346 (S.D. Tex. 2017)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of Texas
Extract
Twombly and Iqbal lay out a two-prong approach to Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal
motions, which is relevant here for understanding what constitutes the
baseline federal pleading standard. First, the plaintiff must plead 'enough
facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.' A claim has facial
plausibility when its factual content 'allows the court to draw the reasonable
inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.' Second,
the plaintiff must prove the plausibility of his claim with case-specific facts,

=== PAGE 28 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
not mere conclusions: 'a pleading that offers labels and conclusions or a
formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.' 'Nor
does a complaint suffice if it tenders naked assertion[s] devoid of further
factual enhancement.' Thus, although courts must accept as true all well-
pleaded facts, they need not accept as true overt legal conclusions, or legal
conclusions which have been 'couched' as factual allegations. Moreover,
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) heightens the traditional 12(b)(6)
pleading standard when the claim in question involves fraud, requiring that
'a party must state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or
mistake.' The Fifth Circuit has clarified what it means to state 'with
particularity' the circumstances constituting fraud: the plaintiff must allege
the '[1] time, [2] place, [3] contents of the false representations, as well as
the [4] identity of the person making the misrepresentations and [5] what he
obtained thereby.' This doctrine has expanded to include 'all cases where the
gravamen of the claim is fraud even though the theory supporting the claim
is not technically termed fraud.'
Summary
Pleading requirements for fraud and related claims in federal court,
emphasizing the need for specificity under Rule 9(b). This includes detailing
the time, place, content, identity, and benefit of the alleged fraudulent acts.
The passage also highlights the general pleading standard under Rule 12(b)
(6), which requires claims to be plausible and supported by specific facts
rather than mere conclusions. These standards are crucial for tying state
law claims to the factual record in a federal RICO complaint, ensuring that
each element of the claim is supported by detailed and specific allegations.
Sw. Marine & Gen. Ins. Co. v. Valentine
U.S. District Court — Northern District of Texas
Extract
In conducting this analysis, courts look to the pleading requirements set out
in Rule 8(a)(2). See Wooten v. McDonald Transit Assocs., Inc., 788 F.3d 490,
497 (5th Cir. 2015). Factual allegations in the complaint need only 'be
enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level, on the
assumption that all the allegations in the complaint are true (even if
doubtful in fact).' Wooten, 788 F.3d at 497 (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v.
Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007)). The pleading must present 'more than
an unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation,' but
'detailed factual allegations' are not required. ... For common law fraud,

Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b).' Edge Adhesives, Inc. v. Sharpe Concepts, LLC,
No. 4:15-CV-405-O, 2015 WL 12743618, at *3-4 (N.D. Tex. Aug. 31, 2015)
(citations omitted); see also Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b) ('In alleging fraud or mistake, a
party must state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or
mistake.'). The Fifth Circuit interprets Rule 9(b) to require, at minimum
'specificity as to the statements (or omissions) considered to be fraudulent,
the speaker, when and why the statements were made, and an explanation of
why they were fraudulent.'
Summary
General pleading requirements under Rule 8(a)(2) and the specific
heightened pleading requirements for fraud under Rule 9(b) in federal court.
It specifies that for fraud claims, the plaintiff must provide detailed
allegations, including the specifics of the fraudulent statements, the speaker,
timing, and reasons for the fraudulence. This is crucial for tying the factual
record to the legal claims in a RICO complaint, as it ensures that the
allegations are sufficiently detailed to meet the federal standards.
Omni USA, Inc. v. Parker-Hannifin Corp., 798 F.Supp.2d 831 (S.D. Tex. 2011)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of Texas
Extract
Fraud claims must also satisfy the heightened pleading standard set out in
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b): 'In allegations alleging fraud ..., a party
must state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or
mistake. Malice, intent, knowledge, and other conditions of a person's mind
may be alleged generally.' The Fifth Circuit strictly construes the Rule and
requires the plaintiff pleading fraud in federal court 'to specify the
statements contended to be fraudulent, identify the speaker, state when and
where the statements were made, and explain why the statements were
fraudulent.'
Summary
The passage provides specific guidance on the heightened pleading standard
required for fraud claims under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) in the
Fifth Circuit. It emphasizes the need for particularity in alleging fraud,
including specifying the fraudulent statements, identifying the speaker, and
explaining the fraudulent nature of the statements. This is crucial for tying
the factual record to the legal claims in a RICO complaint.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
The Martins allege a state-law claim of intentional infliction of emotional
distress by Haywood, Odin, and Hughes. (Docket Entry No. 1, ¶ 95). In
Wilson v. Monarch Paper Co., 939 F.2d 1138 (5th Cir.1991), the Fifth Circuit
set out in detail the elements of a claim for intentional infliction of emotional
distress under Texas law. First, a plaintiff must show that the defendant
acted intentionally or recklessly. Second, she must show that the defendant's
conduct was 'extreme and outrageous,' 'so outrageous in character, and so
extreme in degree, as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency, and to be
regarded as atrocious.' Dean v. Ford Motor Credit Co., 885 F.2d 300, 306
(5th Cir.1989) (quoting RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF TORTS § 46 cmt. d).
Summary
To plead a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress in the Fifth
Circuit, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant acted intentionally
or recklessly and that the conduct was extreme and outrageous. This aligns
with the requirements under Texas law and is relevant to federal RICO
complaints when state law claims are included.
McCoy v. McCormick, Civil Action 22-443-BAJ-RLB (M.D. La. Feb 15, 2023)
U.S. District Court — Middle District of Louisiana
Extract
To the extent Plaintiff has made allegations of fraud, including as part of her
RICO claims, they are subject to the heightened pleading standard set out in
Rule 9 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. See Tel-Phonic Servs., Inc. v.
TBS Int'l, Inc., 975 F.2d 1134, 1138-39 (5th Cir. 1992). Rule 9 requires a
plaintiff who 'alleg[es] fraud' to 'state with particularity the circumstances
constituting fraud. . .,' but allows '[m]alice, intent, knowledge, and other
conditions of a person's mind [to] be alleged generally.' Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b). To
meet this burden, a plaintiff must plead 'the particulars of time, place, and
contents of the false representations, as well as the identity of the person
making the misrepresentation and what he obtained thereby.'
Summary
In the Fifth Circuit, when alleging fraud as part of a RICO claim, the plaintiff
must adhere to the heightened pleading standard of Rule 9(b) of the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure. This requires stating with particularity the
circumstances constituting fraud, including the time, place, and contents of
the false representations, as well as the identity of the person making the
misrepresentation and what was obtained thereby. This standard ensures
that the allegations are specific enough to provide the defendant with notice
of the claims against them and to prevent frivolous claims.

Ripley v. State Farm Lloyds, NO. 4:19-CV-1066-A (N.D. Tex. Apr 01, 2020)
U.S. District Court — Northern District of Texas
Extract
A complaint must contain 'a short and plain statement of the claim showing
that the pleader is entitled to relief,' Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2), 'in order to give
the defendant fair notice of what the claim is and the grounds upon which it
rests.' Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007) (internal
quotation marks and ellipsis omitted). Although a complaint need not
contain detailed factual allegations, the 'showing' contemplated by Rule 8
requires a plaintiff to do more than simply allege legal conclusions or recite
the elements of a cause of action. Id. at 555 & n.3. Thus, while a court must
accept all the factual allegations in the complaint as true, it need not credit
bare legal conclusions that are unsupported by any factual underpinnings...
Rule 9(b) sets forth the heightened pleading standard imposed for fraud
claims. 'In alleging fraud or mistake, a party must state with particularity
the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake.' Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b).
Succinctly stated, Rule 9(b) requires a party to identify in its pleadings 'the
who, what, when, where, and how' of the events constituting the purported
fraud. Dorsey v. Portfolio Equities, Inc., 540 F.3d 333, 339 (5th Cir. 2008).
Summary
General pleading requirements under Rule 8(a)(2) and the heightened
requirements for fraud under Rule 9(b). Rule 8(a)(2) requires a short and
plain statement of the claim, providing fair notice to the defendant. Rule
9(b) requires fraud claims to be stated with particularity, detailing the "who,
what, when, where, and how" of the alleged fraud. These requirements are
applicable in the Fifth Circuit and are essential for properly pleading state
law claims in a federal RICO complaint.

U.S. District Court — Southern District of Texas
Extract
A civil claim may be dismissed under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)
(6) if it does not contain 'enough facts to state a claim to relief that is
plausible on its face.' Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007).
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2) provides the general requirement for
pleadings in federal court: Each cause of action must include 'a short and
plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.'
While the complaint need not contain detailed factual allegations, it must set
forth 'more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the
elements of a cause of action will not do.' Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555 (internal
citation omitted). Rather, the complaint's '[f]actual allegations must be

enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.' Id. ...
Allegations of fraud or mistake are subject to even a higher pleading
standard than other civil claims. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b)
provides that a party alleging fraud 'must state with particularity the
circumstances constituting fraud.' What constitutes 'particularity' varies
depending on the facts of the case. Benchmark Elec., Inc. v. J.M. Huber
Corp., 343 F.3d 719, 724 (5th Cir. 2003). At a minimum, though, the plaintiff
must 'allege the particulars of [1] time, [2] place, and [3] contents of the
false representations, as well as [4] the identity of the person making the
representation and [5] what that person obtained thereby.'
Summary
General pleading requirements under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2)
and the heightened requirements for fraud under Rule 9(b). Rule 8(a)(2)
requires a short and plain statement of the claim, while Rule 9(b) requires
fraud claims to be stated with particularity, including details such as time,
place, and contents of the false representations. This is relevant for tying
state law claims to the factual record in a federal RICO complaint, as it
provides the standard for how detailed the allegations must be.

misrepresentation and what he obtained thereby.'
Summary
In the Fifth Circuit, when pleading fraud in a federal RICO complaint, the
plaintiff must meet the heightened pleading standard of Rule 9(b) of the
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. This requires the plaintiff to state with
particularity the circumstances constituting fraud, including the time, place,
and contents of the false representations, the identity of the person making
the misrepresentation, and what was obtained as a result. This standard
ensures that the defendant is given sufficient notice of the claims against
them and the specific fraudulent conduct alleged.

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a) generally controls pleading
requirements, calling for 'a short and plain statement of the claim showing
that the pleader is entitled to relief.' FED. R. CIV. P. 8(a)(2). However, in
cases alleging fraud or mistake, the heightened pleading requirements of
Rule 9(b) apply. FED. R. CIV. P. 9(b). Under Rule 9(b), 'a party must state
with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake.' Id.; see
also Matter of Life Partners Holdings, Inc., 926 F.3d 103, 116-17 (5th Cir.

complaint contain factual allegations for the 'time, place, and contents of the
false representations, as well as the identity of the person making the
misrepresentation and what [that person] obtained thereby.'
Summary
General pleading requirements under Rule 8(a) and the heightened
requirements under Rule 9(b) for cases involving fraud or mistake. Rule 8(a)
requires a short and plain statement of the claim, while Rule 9(b) requires
that fraud be stated with particularity, including the time, place, contents of
the false representations, the identity of the person making them, and what
was obtained. This is crucial for tying state law claims to the factual record
in a federal RICO complaint, as it ensures that the allegations are specific
and detailed enough to meet the heightened pleading standard.

2020)
U.S. District Court — Western District of Texas
Extract
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) allows a party to move to dismiss an
action for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted. In deciding
a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, the court
'accepts all well-pleaded facts as true, viewing them in the light most
favorable to the [nonmovant].' In re Katrina Canal Breaches Litig., 495 F.3d
191, 205 (5th Cir. 2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). The Supreme
Court has explained that a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter
'to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.' Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556

Summary
The passage provides insight into the general pleading requirements under

In addition, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) requires that Plaintiffs, '[i]n
alleging fraud or mistake,... must state with particularity the circumstances

conditions of a person's mind may be alleged generally.' Rule 9(b) extends to
all claims or allegations in which the gravamen is fraud, even if the

=== PAGE 35 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
associated theory of liability is not technically termed fraud. For example,
Texas Deceptive Trade Practices-Consumer Protection Act claims generally
have to meet the Rule 9(b) standard. 'The Fifth Circuit has interpreted
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) strictly, requiring the plaintiff to specify
the statements contended to be fraudulent, identify the speaker, state when
and where the statements were made, and explain why the statements were
fraudulent. In short, plaintiffs must plead enough facts to illustrate the who,
what, when, where, why and how of the alleged fraud.' This strict
requirement is 'a gatekeeper to discovery, a tool to weed out meritless fraud
claims sooner than later. [Courts] apply Rule 9(b) to fraud complaints with
bite and without apology.' Nevertheless, 'fraud may be pleaded without long
or highly detailed particularity.' To plead a claim for fraud by
misrepresentation or omission, 'Rule 9(b) typically requires the claimant to
plead the type of facts omitted, the place in which the omissions should have
appeared, and the way in which the omitted facts made the representations
misleading.' The 'particularity' required by Rule 9(b) also disallows
collectivized or group allegations; Plaintiffs must delineate which Defendant
is responsible for which allegedly fraudulent activity. Courts will 'treat a
dismissal for failure to plead fraud with particularity under Rule 9(b) as a
dismissal for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.'
Summary
In the Fifth Circuit, when pleading fraud or related claims in a federal RICO
complaint, the plaintiff must adhere to the strict requirements of Federal
Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b). This rule mandates that the plaintiff specify the
fraudulent statements, identify the speaker, and explain the circumstances
of the fraud with particularity. The rule serves as a gatekeeper to prevent
meritless claims from proceeding to discovery. The passage also emphasizes
that fraud claims must be individualized, specifying which defendant is
responsible for each alleged fraudulent act.

Extract
The elements of common law fraud in Texas are: (1) a material
representation was made; (2) it was false when made; (3) the speaker either
knew it was false, or made it without knowledge of its truth; (4) the speaker
made it with the intent that it should be acted upon; (5) the party acted in
reliance; and (6) the party was injured as a result. ... At a minimum, Rule
9(b) requires allegations of the particulars of time, place, and contents of
the false representations, as well as the identity of the person making the

Summary
In the Fifth Circuit, when pleading state law claims such as fraud in a
federal RICO complaint, the plaintiff must meet the heightened pleading
standard of Rule 9(b). This requires detailing the specifics of the alleged
fraud, including the time, place, and content of the false representations, as
well as identifying the person who made the misrepresentation and what
they gained from it. This ensures that the claim is not speculative and
provides a clear basis for the court to infer liability.

A complaint alleging fraud also must satisfy the heightened pleading
standard of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b). FED. R. CIV. P. 9(b).
Generally, Rule 9(b)'s 'particularity' standard requires 'specificity as to the

To prevail on a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress, Texas
law requires that the following four elements be satisfied: '(1) the defendant
acted intentionally or recklessly, (2) the conduct was 'extreme and
outrageous', (3) the actions of the defendant caused the plaintiff emotional
distress, and (4) the emotional distress suffered by the plaintiff was severe.'

98 F.4th 198 D&T Partners L.L.C. v. Baymark Partners Mgmt., L.L.C.
Extract
In pursuing this action, D&T brings claims under three subsections of the
RICO statute. See id. §§ 1962 (a), (c) & (d). Though the subsections are
distinct, each shares three common elements: '(1) a person who engages in
(2) a pattern of racketeering activity, (3) connected to the acquisition,
establishment, conduct, or control of an enterprise.' Abraham v. Singh, 480
F.3d 351, 355 (5th Cir. 2007) (quoting Word of Faith World Outreach Ctr.
Church, Inc. v. Sawyer, 90 F.3d 118, 122 (5th Cir. 1996)).
Summary
Three common elements required for a RICO claim in the Fifth Circuit: a
person engaging in a pattern of racketeering activity connected to an
enterprise. This is relevant to understanding how state law claims might be
integrated into a RICO complaint, as they would need to be tied to these
elements to establish a pattern of racketeering activity.

Heightened pleading standard for fraud claims under Federal Rule of Civil

Belton v. Regions Bank
Extract
A Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss tests the sufficiency of the complaint
against the legal standard set forth in Rule 8, which requires 'a short and
plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.'
Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2). In order to survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a pleading's
language, on its face, must demonstrate that there exists plausibility for
entitlement to relief. Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 557 (2007).
'Determining whether a complaint states a plausible claim for relief [is]... a
context-specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial
experience and common sense.' Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 679 (2009).
In determining whether it is plausible that a pleader is entitled to relief, a
court does not assume the truth of conclusory statements, but rather looks
for facts which support the elements of the pleader's claim. Twombly, 550
U.S. at 557. Factual assertions are presumed to be true, but 'labels and
conclusions' or 'a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action'
alone are not enough to withstand a 12(b)(6) motion. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678.
Summary
Pleading requirements under Rule 8 and the standards for surviving a Rule
12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. It emphasizes the need for a complaint to
provide a plausible claim for relief, supported by factual assertions rather
than mere conclusions or formulaic recitations of legal elements. This is
relevant to state law claims in a federal RICO complaint, as these claims
must also meet the plausibility standard to survive dismissal.
Clapper v. Am. Realty Investors, Inc.
Extract
Rule 9(b) imposes a heightened pleading standard for fraud claims and
requires that a party state with particularity facts supporting each element
of fraud." "To survive the motions to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), plaintiffs
must plead 'enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its
face.' Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007). 'A claim has facial

misconduct alleged.' Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).
Summary
Pleading standards under Rule 9(b) for fraud claims, which require
particularity in stating facts supporting each element of fraud. It also
references Rule 12(b)(6), which requires that a complaint state a plausible
claim for relief. These standards are applicable in the context of federal
RICO complaints in the Fifth Circuit.
Rodriguez v. Meta Platforms, Inc.
Extract
Rule 8(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires a Complaint set
forth 'sufficient facts from which the court can determine the existence of
subject matter jurisdiction and from which the defendants can fairly
appreciate the claim made against them.' While Rule 8's pleading standard
does not require 'detailed factual allegations,' it does demand more than an
'unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation.' Moreover,
when a plaintiff alleges fraud, Rule 9 requires that the fraud claim be
pleaded with particularity. 'At a minimum, Rule 9(b) requires allegations of
the particulars of ‘time, place, and contents of the false representations, as
well as the identity of the person making the misrepresentation and what he
obtained thereby.'
Summary
Requirements under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for pleading state
law claims in a federal complaint. Rule 8(a) requires sufficient factual
allegations to establish subject matter jurisdiction and to inform defendants
of the claims against them. Rule 9(b) imposes a heightened pleading
standard for fraud claims, requiring specific details about the alleged
fraudulent conduct.
AHBP LLC v. The Lynd Co.

Claims alleging fraud and fraudulent inducement are subject to the
requirements of Rule 9(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Rule 9(b)
states that '[i]n alleging fraud or mistake, a party must state with

Summary
Clear explanation of the heightened pleading standard for fraud claims
under Rule 9(b) in the Fifth Circuit. It specifies that a plaintiff must detail
the fraudulent statements, identify the speaker, and provide the time and
place of the statements, as well as explain why they are fraudulent. This is
essential for tying the factual record to the legal claims in a RICO complaint.
Daughtry v. Silver Fern Chem.
Extract
In order to succeed on their fraud claims, Plaintiffs' pleadings must also

constituting the fraud. See FED. R. CIV. P. 9(b); Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues
& Rts., Ltd., 551 U.S. 308, 319 (2007); Pace, 93 F.4th at 889-90; Stringer v.
Remington Arms Co., L.L.C., 52 F.4th 660, 661 (5th Cir. 2022). Specifically,
Rule 9(b) states: 'In alleging fraud or mistake, a party must state with
particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake.' FED. R. CIV.
P. 9(b). Therefore, Rule 9(b) imposes a heightened standard of pleading for
averments of fraud. See FED. R. CIV. P. 8(a), 9(b); Pace, 93 F.4th at 889; In
re Sherwin Alumina Co., L.L.C., 952 F.3d at 235. A party must plead, at the
minimum, the 'who, what, when, where, and how of the alleged fraud.' In re
Sherwin Alumina Co., L.L.C., 952 F.3d at 235.
Summary
Heightened pleading standard for fraud claims under Rule 9(b), which
requires plaintiffs to specify the "who, what, when, where, and how" of the
alleged fraud. This standard is applicable in the Fifth Circuit and is essential
for any federal RICO complaint that includes state law fraud claims.

3d 464, 467 (5th Cir. 2004)). To survive a motion to dismiss, plaintiffs must
allege enough facts 'to state a claim of relief that is plausible on its face.'
Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007). 'A claim has facial
plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to
draw the reasonable inference that the defendant[s] [are] liable for the
misconduct alleged.' Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). 'The
plausibility standard is not akin to a 'probability requirement,' but it asks for
more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.' Id.; see
also Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555 ('Factual allegations must be enough to raise
a right to relief above the speculative level[.]'). 'Rule 9(b) imposes a
heightened pleading standard for fraud claims and requires that a party
state with particularity facts supporting each element of fraud.' Turner v.

719, 724 (5th Cir. 2003)), aff'd, 514 Fed. Appx. 513 (5th Cir. 2013). 'At a
minimum, Rule 9(b) requires allegations of the particulars of time, place,
and contents of the false representations, as well as the identity of the
person making the misrepresentation and what he obtained thereby.' Id.
(quoting Benchmark Elecs., 343 F.3d at 724) (internal quotation marks
omitted). More colloquially, plaintiffs must plead the 'who, what, when,
where, and how' of the fraud. Williams v. BellHelicopter Textron, Inc., 417 F.
3d 450, 453 (5th Cir. 2005) (quoting United States ex rel. Thompson v.
Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp., 125 F.3d 899, 903 (5th Cir. 1997)).
Summary
General pleading requirements under Rule 12(b)(6) and the heightened
pleading standard under Rule 9(b) for fraud claims. It emphasizes the need
for factual allegations that are plausible and specific, detailing the "who,
what, when, where, and how" of the alleged fraud. This is essential for tying
state law claims to the factual record in a federal RICO complaint.
Llort v. BMW of N. Am., LLC
Extract
In order to state a claim under the TDTPA, a plaintiff must allege the
following elements: '(1) the plaintiff is a consumer, (2) the defendant
engaged in false, misleading, or deceptive acts, and (3) these acts
constituted a producing cause of the consumer's damages.' Doe v. Boys
Clubs of Greater Dallas, Inc., 907 S.W.2d 472, 478 (Tex. 1995) (citing §
17.50(a)(1)). To prove a TDTPA action for failure to disclose information, as
in this case, the plaintiff must show (1) a failure to disclose, (2) which was
known at the time of the transaction, (3) which was intended to induce the
plaintiff into a transaction, and (4) that the plaintiff otherwise would not
have entered the transaction if the information had been disclosed.
Hudspeth v. Enter. Life Ins. Co., 358 S.W.3d 373, 388 (Tex. App.—Houston
[1st Dist.] 2011, no pet.). 'To be actionable under the DTPA, a failure to
disclose material information necessarily requires that the defendant have
known the information and have failed to bring it to the plaintiff's attention.'

=== PAGE 42 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Doe, 907 S.W.2d at 478. In addition, federal courts have held that claims
under the TDTPA must also satisfy Rule 9(b)'s particularity requirement.
E.g., Gonzalez v. State Farm Lloyds, 326 F. Supp. 3d 346, 350 (S.D. Tex.
2017); SHS Inv. v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 798 F. Supp. 2d 811, 815 (S.D.
Tex. 2011).
Summary
Elements required to state a claim under the TDTPA, which includes being a
consumer, the defendant's engagement in deceptive acts, and the causation
of damages. It also emphasizes the need for particularity in pleading under
Rule 9(b) for such claims. This is relevant to understanding the pleading
requirements for state law claims in a federal RICO complaint, as similar
standards of specificity and element satisfaction would apply.
United Healthcare Sevices, Inc. v. Next Health, LLC
Extract
A complaint alleging fraud also must satisfy the heightened pleading
standard of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b). FED. R. CIV. P. 9(b).
Generally, Rule 9(b)'s 'particularity' standard requires 'specificity as to the
statements (or omissions) considered to be fraudulent, the speaker, when
and why the statements were made, and an explanation of why they are
fraudulent.' Plotkin v. IF Axess, Inc., 407 F.3d 690, 696 (5th Cir. 2005);
Benchmark Elecs., Inc. v. J.M. Huber Corp., 343 F.3d 719, 724 (5th Cir.
2003). Accordingly, a plaintiff must plead the 'who, what, when, where, and
how' of the fraud. Benchmark Elecs., Inc., 343 F.3d at 724 (citation omitted).
Summary
Clear explanation of the heightened pleading standard required for fraud
claims under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b). It emphasizes the need
for specificity in the allegations, including details about the fraudulent
statements, the speaker, the timing, the reasons for the statements, and why
they are considered fraudulent. This standard is crucial for ensuring that
defendants have adequate notice of the claims against them and can prepare
a defense.

Extract
Rule 9(b) strives mainly to put defendants on notice and allow them to
prepare an appropriate defense. Further, it serves to protect defendants
from frivolous claims and deter cases filed purely for settlement value,
merely to reopen a completed transaction, or only to obtain discovery.
Therefore, '[a] court should hesitate to dismiss a complaint under Rule 9(b)
if the court is satisfied (1) that the defendant has been made aware of the
particular circumstances for which she will have to prepare a defense at
trial, and (2) that plaintiff has substantial prediscovery evidence of those
facts.'
Summary
The passage highlights the purpose of Rule 9(b), which is to ensure that
defendants are adequately informed of the claims against them so they can
prepare a defense. It also emphasizes that courts should be cautious in
dismissing complaints under Rule 9(b) if the defendant is aware of the
circumstances and the plaintiff has substantial evidence. This suggests that
in a federal RICO complaint, the plaintiff must provide specific details of the
fraudulent scheme and evidence to support the claims, ensuring that the
defendants are on notice.
Conley v. Gibson
Civil Procedure: Pleading - The Center for Computer - Assisted Legal
Instruction (CALI) - Hillel H. Levin - 2011-03-09
Extract
In alleging fraud or mistake, a party must state with particularity the
circumstances constituting fraud or mistake. Malice, intent, knowledge, and
other conditions of a person's mind may be alleged generally.
Summary
When alleging fraud in a federal complaint, the plaintiff must provide
specific details about the fraudulent acts, including the "who, what, when,
where, and how" of the alleged fraud. This requirement ensures that the
defendant is given sufficient notice of the claims against them. However,
conditions of the mind, such as intent or knowledge, can be alleged more
generally. This standard is applicable in the Fifth Circuit and would apply to
any state law fraud claims included in a federal RICO complaint.

To recover damages for intentional infliction of emotional distress, a plaintiff
must prove that: (1) the defendant acted intentionally or recklessly; (2) the
conduct was extreme and outrageous; (3) the actions of the defendant
caused the plaintiff emotional distress; and (4) the resulting emotional
distress was severe." (GTE Southwest, Inc. v. Bruce, 998 S.W.2d 605, 611
(Tex. 1999)). "In order to sustain an action for fraud, the plaintiff must prove
(1) that the defendant made a representation, (2) as to a material fact, (3)
which was false, (4) and known to be false by the defendant, (5) that the
representation was made for the purpose of inducing the other party to rely
upon it, (6) that the other party rightfully did so rely, (7) in ignorance of its
falsity, (8) to his injury.
Summary
The passage provides the elements required to plead intentional infliction of
emotional distress and fraud under Texas law, which is relevant to the Fifth
Circuit. For intentional infliction of emotional distress, the conduct must be
intentional or reckless, extreme and outrageous, and cause severe emotional
distress. For fraud, the plaintiff must show a false representation of a
material fact, known to be false, made to induce reliance, which the plaintiff
relied upon to their detriment.
Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy
The Brief - American Bar Association - 2024-01-01
Extract
A RICO-based complaint must be drafted with the following instructions
from Sedima as a guide. A violation of § 1962(c), the section on which
Sedima relies, requires (1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern
(4) of racketeering activity. The plaintiff must allege each of the elements to
state a claim. They are all equally essential components, and the complaint
will fail if any one of them is not adequately pleaded. In particular, RICO
claims based on mail or wire fraud must comport with Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 9(b)’s requirement that allegations involving fraud be pleaded
with particularity. The practitioner through their pleadings must articulate
with great care and attention a viable racketeering conspiracy. The court
must read the facts alleged in the complaint in the light most favorable to
the plaintiff. But a plaintiff who is unable to identify the enterprise, satisfy
the pattern requirement, or plead other statutory elements with sufficient
specificity can be subject to a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 12(b)(6). Additionally, to the extent that any predicate acts sound
in fraud, the pleading of those acts must satisfy the particularity
requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b), which provides: 'In
alleging fraud or mistake, a party must state with particularity the
circumstances constituting fraud or mistake. Malice, intent, knowledge, and
other conditions of a person’s mind may be alleged generally.' The complaint

=== PAGE 45 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
must describe the predicate acts with specificity and state the time, place,
and content of the alleged communications perpetrating the fraud.
Summary
A RICO complaint must allege each element of a RICO violation with
specificity, particularly when fraud is involved. The complaint must satisfy
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) by stating the circumstances of the
fraud with particularity, including the time, place, and content of the alleged
fraudulent communications. This requirement is crucial to withstand a
motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6).

RICO also provides for civil remedies. Under Section 1964 'any person
injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962'
may bring a civil action in either state or federal court for redress. Thus, a
plaintiff in a civil action must show, in addition to one of the four acts
described in § 1962, an injury to business or property. A showing of such
injury requires proof of concrete financial loss, not 'mere injury' to a
valuable intangible property interest. Oscar v. University Students Co-Op.
Ass'n, 965 F.2d 783, 785 (9th Cir. 1992). Generally, personal injuries are not
recoverable under RICO. See id. at 785-86 (citing Reiter v. Sonotone Corp.,
442 U.S. 330, 339, 99 S. Ct. 2326, 60 L. Ed. 2d 931 (dictum)). Further, in
Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corp., 503 U.S. 258, 268 112 S. Ct.
1311, 117 L. Ed. 2d 532 , the United States Supreme Court held that the ''by

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
reason of' language in section 1964(c) means that in order to prevail on a
civil RICO claim, the plaintiff must show that the defendant's violation was
the 'proximate cause' of the plaintiff's injury.'
Summary
For a civil RICO claim, a plaintiff must demonstrate an injury to business or
property, which requires proof of concrete financial loss. Personal injuries
are generally not recoverable under RICO. Additionally, the plaintiff must
show that the defendant's violation was the proximate cause of the injury.
This information is relevant to understanding the requirements for pleading
state law claims in a federal RICO complaint, as it highlights the necessity of
demonstrating a direct link between the alleged RICO violation and the
injury claimed.
