"Lindsey K. Baker" , Cooper Carter , "CSD-legal- 914@oag.texas.gov" Good
morning, This is a follow-up regarding Respondent’s No-Evidence Motion for
Summary Judgment, heard December 2, 2025, and taken under advisement.
With final trial set for tomorrow, December 9, 2025 at 9:00 a.m., a ruling on
the pending no-evidence motion is necessary, as it determines the scope —
and existence — of any trial issues. I respectfully request that the Court
enter its ruling on the no-evidence motion today, because the Court cannot
determine what, if anything, remains for trial until the motion is ruled upon,
and Respondent cannot prepare for trial without knowing whether any
issues remain to be tried. Thank you for your attention. Respectfully, Charles

Page 2 --- Thank you for your continued correspondence in this matter. I
must bring several procedural issues to your attention regarding the
upcoming hearing. The Texas Office of the Attorney General (OAG), a named
party to this suit since June 28, 2024, has not been CC'ed on the Order
Setting Hearing signed by the Honorable David L. Evans. The OAG must
receive proper notice to participate effectively. (Holly Hayes) Additionally,
the Order Setting Hearing lacks a Certificate of Service, and there has been
no confirmation of docketing from the reSearch Texas vendor. If there is an
alternative vendor to obtain receipt of filing and service, please advise how
to access it to prevent further confusion. I request that these procedural
requirements be met prior to setting the matter for hearing, or alternatively,
that instructions be provided to ensure proper receipt of service and
docketing to confirm all named parties to the suit have receipt of service and
to ensure no further procedural delays occur. These requests are made for
the purpose of maintaining public confidence in the judiciary, as there is
growing public interest in this matter. The above will provide clarity and
ensure that everyone is on the same page regarding the hearing. Thank you
for your attention to these matters. Respectfully, Charles Myers

Baker, Just so I understand, I need the following to be explained, and anyone
CC'ed in this email is free to provide input. Regarding the recusal
procedures (this marks the third): The first recusal, you send me a modified
version of my pleading as if I'm not going to notice it's missing the exhibits
and affidavit critical to the motion. You confirm it was electronically filed
when I bring this discrepancy up, and then suddenly change your answer
when I bring up the file size discrepancy, and modify it again in conjunction

with an amended order of referral but that time split the file into three parts
because of the "size of the motion" which directly contradicts how the filing
procedure works, as per the Tarrant County District Clerk's FAQ. The parties
agreed to continue the case because I had a dental emergency the day of the
first hearing on November 7th, which everyone agreed to in writing, and
which I appreciated. That was denied for a failure to appear. Because I read
the Regional Judge's order, I waited for the next four months while the other
side did absolutely nothing and reached out to you about an unopposed
summary judgement that's been on the docket since February 22, 2024.

any motion at all to the orders of referral, and erroneously included an order
of referral for Judge Jeffrey Kaitcer not once, but now twice, when he wasn't
implicated in either of the second or third motions. All three times I have no
indication that the correct pleading was even sent to the Regional Presiding
Judge, as the orders don't comport with what was filed, and we have judges
electing not to recuse who were never asked to, and then orders denying
motions which were never filed follow. The inconsistency surrounding a
straightforward process set forth in the rules of procedure is being
unnecessarily obfuscated, and there doesn't exist a logical explanation that
warrants confusing a process designed to promote judicial fairness,
transparency, and impartiality. As a final reminder, and in good faith to
prevent any further disruption to the rule of law, these issues must be
addressed or explained: 1. The most recent recusal brings up serious issues
that undermine the judiciary, as I'm concurrently litigating in the Western
District of Oklahoma trying to seek damages from this situation pursuant to
RICO, and I warned the court that because I have no alternative options, and
the Court insists on moving to final trial in the midst of all of these issues, I
must enjoin additional defendants as the court found I was lacking
continuity and relatedness. 2. The actions taken here provide the missing
elements of the RICO claim according to the 10th Circuit, however, I will be
appealing to the 10th circuit given there is a circuit split of authority
regarding this aspect of RICO law. 3. I've given this Court many chances to
provide corrective action, I've tried to warn the court that there's an
ongoing criminal enterprise that was formed in December of 2023, yet it
continues to ignore these unrebutted facts, and has now clearly chosen to
become part of the enterprise I have repeatedly brought to the court's
attention through several different vehicles, including mandamus petitions.
4. We can't even follow recusal procedures correctly, and for some reason
you continue to be involved when nowhere in the Texas Rules of Civil
Procedure does it give you any designated role in this process. 6. You feel
the need to email me these exchanges, when they should just be filed with
the EFM. Nobody in this case requires emailed service, because the attorney
on the other side is registered under the EFM, albeit to her prior employer,
which is another issue the Court continues to ignore. Electronic filing is
REQUIRED, it's not optional for licensed attorneys. 7. I've filed six
mandamus and have received zero responses from any implicated judge, and

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
all the Court has to base its reasoning on is an order that claims consent
with only one side of the case's signature on it. The only argument I've been
given is that your position is to "help effectuate and expedite justice", yet
here - no logical person knowing these facts would think for a second that
the Court is being impartial, or that your involvement has done anything
other than create ambiguities in a process designed to show the Court is, in
fact, unbiased and fair. Again, I understand the bias is there - but you have
to put yourself in my shoes, even if just for a moment, and realize that this
entire time all I've done is try to WARN the court with facts that - to this day
- remain unopposed within a record that exceeds 3,900 pages and exists in
the public domain. https://search.txcourts.gov/SearchMedia.aspx?

bbc08c814365 I don't want to litigate. I don't want to continue to try and
explain what's already obvious. I want to get justice for my children, which
is why instead of performing self-help remedies, I've tried to follow the law
and give the court every opportunity that I possibly could to make them
aware that it is actively assisting a criminal RICO enterprise in furthering
their scheme, providing the continuity and relatedness elements that the
Western District of Oklahoma found was lacking, and that will be appealed
to the 10th circuit. I didn't ask to be in this position, I was put here, and I
have no other options but to initiate a federal action and use the 3,900 page
record and the unexplained misconduct as self-authenticating evidence that
what I've been saying is the truth.12/13/25, 12:15 AM Gmail - FW: Myers

Page 4 --- This is nothing against you personally, Ms. Baker, I understand
politics are at play here with next year's elections coming up - but this is my
life - it has been destroyed, and I have to do everything that the law allows
to ensure that this situation is remedied.In fact, I take nothing that has
occurred personally, because I'm not doing any of this for any other reasons
than it's what's best for my Children. I just can't fathom how the desire to
silence a litigant could outweigh the risk of becoming involved with the
criminal enterprise that has made absolutely no defense to the claims made
against them, and they're being given a vehicle to just walk into court on
December 10th and obtain a final decree of divorce despite all of these
issues, thus effectively concluding the enterprise's affairs. This message is
not meant to intimidate the Court, harass or threaten, but is to merely
communicate what I have been forced into doing, and to reiterate the major
issues that continue to compound. If anyone else were in my position, it's
hard to fathom that they'd feel like they were being treated fairly. I hope
that this Court, at the very least, understands why I have to do this. I've
tried everything else to no avail, and every pleading has been in good faith.
The opposing counsel, Petitioner, and CSD legal have been duly CC'ed in this
email. A few more key notes: 1. Take special note how CSD legal is silent on
the issue of their certificate of service sent in the intervention pleading
containing mismatched names. Holly Hayes is allegedly the attorney of
record, yet she signs with a signature that doesn't match any of the other 85
documents I've pulled containing Holly Hayes signature, and the signature
line says "Choya Burkley". It's comically fraudulent. 2. Take special note how
CSD legal has no basis to even be on the case considering they don't reply to

=== PAGE 9 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
objections served to them, similar to opposing counsel here, and they're
unable to enforce a facially void order, especially when the attorney on the
other side can't file anything in her own name despite being allegedly
retained in her individual capacity. 3. Take special note of how Holly Hayes,
alleged attorney for the OAG, publicly left in 2018, claims to work at the
SBA on her public LinkedIn profile, yet somehow is the attorney of record
for the OAG in this case. 4. Take special note of how Cooper Carter, alleged
attorney for Petitioner, publicly left Marx Altman and Joined Cantey Hanger
in 2022, yet here she claims to be employed by Marx Altman with an EFM
registered to Cantey Hanger, and has every filing submitted "on her behalf
by Roderick Marx" who is not a party named in this suit. 5. Take special note
how Cooper Carter will have zero explanation as to why her EFM account is
registered to her prior employer despite this being brought to her attention
time and time again, and won't have any explanation as to why she hasn't
responded to anything served on her. 6. Take special note of the case docket,
and notice that the Petitioner has only made one appearance in this matter
on January 16, 2024, despite there being three alleged hearings. When you
add in the document tampering, one-sided temporary orders, six ignored
mandamus petitions, the sua sponte final trial setting, and the illegal and
deceptive nature upon which this case was founded in conjunction with
everything else mentioned above...it paints a very clear picture that defies
all reasonable logic and warrants an immediate stay until these issues can
be resolved. It makes no sense. Again, everything herein is not speculative,
it's not accusatory - it's in the public domain, and remains unopposed.
What's stated here is already before the court, the only thing that doesn't
exist is any substantive participation whatsoever by the other side or a
reasonable explanation by the Court. This is not how this process is
supposed to work, and everyone in this email chain knows it. I hope the
Court starts to make the right decisions, because the real party responsible
for this entire mess remains the Petitioner as the record facially establishes,
and no further judicial resources should have to be expended in what should
have already been a remedied situation by operation of law.12/13/25, 12:15

Cooper Carter Cc: "Lindsey K. Baker" All, While I respect the Court's
administrative responsibilities, I must again emphasize that these
responsibilities include ensuring that proceedings are conducted within the
bounds of jurisdiction and procedural law as well as improving justice and
expediting the processing of cases through the courts. That isn't happening
here. As a pro se litigant, I take seriously my duty to aid in the efficient
administration of justice as I am held to the same standards as licensed
attorneys. That includes timely raising jurisdictional objections, preserving
the record, and preventing the court from engaging in proceedings that are
void or wasteful.12/13/25, 12:18 AM Gmail - FW: RE ITMOMO MYERS,

Page 5 --- Setting a hearing on a motion that the court cannot lawfully
decide—especially weeks in advance—undermines that purpose and risks
wasting everyone’s time and resources. I’ve acted in good faith to raise
these concerns now, so that judicial time is not misallocated on a setting that
cannot produce a valid result. To be clear: this Court lacks jurisdiction to
consolidate a matter that is not pending before it. Setting a hearing on such
a motion—absent any transfer of the SAPCR case from the 233rd District
Court—is procedurally unsound and jurisdictionally improper. This concern
is not theoretical; it is a statutory and constitutional defect that cannot be
cured by scheduling preferences or delayed hearings. These objections have
been raised repeatedly in the pleadings. Opposing counsel continues to
ignore them and proceeds as if the jurisdictional prerequisite for
consolidation has been met—it has not.Therefore, reiterating these issues is
done to preserve the record to protect my rights. Even more troubling is the
suggestion that this hearing be delayed until late April. The delay does
nothing to resolve the threshold issue: this Court cannot lawfully entertain a
motion concerning a case over which it has no authority. Setting such a
hearing nearly a month out is not merely inefficient. Let me be clear: these
are not legal arguments, these are statutory facts, and they are being
restated here solely to: Preserve procedural objections, Clarify the record,
and Prevent further waste of judicial resources. There is little justification
for continued delay at this point—particularly considering that Ms. Carter
previously moved to block emergency relief in the 233rd District Court
without acknowledging these jurisdictional conflicts. If opposing counsel
wishes to delay this hearing until late April, that is her prerogative.
However, I respectfully state for the record that: I will not be providing
availability for a hearing that is both procedurally and jurisdictionally

at 10:30 PM To: "Lindsey K. Baker" Ms. Baker, I have filed an objection to
this motion for pre-trial conference on the grounds of litigation that is still
pending with the Second Court of Appeals under case No. 02-24-00149-CV.
See envelope number 87035976. The objection is also grounded in the
Tarrant County Family Law Local Rules, Rule 4.10(b) which requires
certification by the moving party before any proceeding may be set, which
was not present in the motion. For those reasons, and for judicial efficiency,
I respectfully suggest we delay the pre-trial conference until the appeal is
resolved and the procedural prerequisites are met, allowing for a proper
briefing on the conference's merits. Respectfully, Charles Dustin Myers 6641

"Lindsey K. Baker" Cc: Charlie Vids Good Afternoon Lindsey, Our office had
filed a motion for pretrial conference a while back ago. Mr. Myers had filed a
Writ of Mandamus which halted our case in the trial court. The Texas
Supreme Court has since denied Mr. Myers’s Writ of Mandamus regarding
this matter. We would like to schedule a pretrial conference at this time.
Could you please provide some dates that the Court is available to hear this
matter? Mr. Myers has been cc-ed to this e-mail for convenience. Thanks!

at 2:28 PM To: "Lindsey K. Baker" , Cooper Carter Ms. Carter, Thank you for
your email and for including me in the discussion regarding the pretrial
conference. I would like to inform you that I plan on filing a motion for
rehearing with the Texas Supreme Court concerning the Writ of Mandamus,
with a filing deadline of September 16, 2024. Given the significance of this
pending motion, I believe it is in the best interest of both parties to delay
scheduling any pretrial conference until the rehearing has been resolved.
Please see https://search.txcourts.gov/Case.aspx?
cn=24-0395&amp;coa=cossup Additionally, I have not yet been briefed on
the merits of the pretrial conference. As you are aware, according to the
Tarrant County Local Rules, specifically Rule 10 on Motion Practice, all
parties are directed to use all reasonable means to resolve pretrial disputes
to avoid the necessity of judicial intervention. Furthermore, no court
proceeding should be set unless the moving party has certified in a motion
or letter that a conference has been held on the merits of the motion, and
that a reasonable effort to resolve the dispute without court intervention has
been made but failed. Alternatively, if a conference was not held, the reasons
for this must be detailed. To date, I have not received the necessary
information to understand the purpose and merits of the proposed pretrial
conference. Proceeding with scheduling at this time would be premature
and improper. The motion for rehearing will be properly served upon its
submission to the Texas Supreme Court as required by the Texas Rules of
Civil Procedure. Upon resolution of the rehearing, I will be more than happy
to discuss the merits of any pretrial conference moving forward and have a
date set accordingly. Respectfully, Charles Myers chuckdustin12@gmail.com

Page 5 --- To all, I am writing to formally and unequivocally object to the
scheduling of a pretrial conference at this time for the following compelling
reasons: Immediate Legal Deadline: I am currently facing a critical deadline
on September 16th related to an ongoing appeal before the Texas Supreme
Court. The outcome of this appeal directly impacts the temporary residency
issue and other significant aspects of this case. Scheduling a pretrial
conference before this matter is resolved would be not only premature but
also prejudicial to my ability to effectively participate in the proceedings. I
have a right to a re-hearing which I am choosing to pursue at this time.
Ongoing Harm from Temporary Orders: The temporary orders currently in
place continue to inflict significant and ongoing financial harm. It is
imperative that these issues be addressed before any pretrial conference is
scheduled. Proceeding without resolving these matters would be an exercise
in futility and could exacerbate the harm already being caused. Failure to
Serve the Texas OAG: The Texas Attorney General’s office, having
intervened in this case and being docketed as a party in this matter as
indicated on the re:SearchTX platform, and formally requested discovery,
has not been properly served with the necessary information regarding this
pretrial conference. Proceeding with a pretrial conference without their
inclusion is not only procedurally improper but also a clear violation of due
process. Basic Discovery Not Completed The purpose of the pre-trial
conference is rendered meaningless without basic discovery being
completed and without clear reasoning as required. Non-Compliance with
Local Court Rules: Local court rules, specifically the requirement for a
certificate of conference, have not been adhered to. These procedural
safeguards are in place to ensure fairness and transparency in the legal

=== PAGE 17 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
process, and they cannot be bypassed or waived without proper justification.
Scheduling a pretrial conference under these circumstances would violate
these fundamental procedural requirements and render any subsequent
proceedings flawed. Uncertain Temporary Residency: I am in the midst of
securing another temporary residency as my current arrangement expires
on September 14th. This immediate and pressing concern further
complicates my ability to participate meaningfully in any pretrial conference
scheduled at this time. Given these substantial and unresolved issues, the
dates provided for the pretrial conference are untenable as notwithstanding
the procedural defects and noncompliance with local rules, attending such a
conference at the available times would not be possible. Should a pretrial
conference be scheduled despite these serious objections, I will be
compelled to formally object on the record and explore all available legal
remedies to protect my rights and ensure compliance with legal procedures
and due process requirements. I respectfully but firmly request that the
pretrial conference be postponed until these matters are adequately
resolved, including the outcome of the pending appeal, proper service of all
parties with a specific purpose pertaining to the conference, and adherence
to all procedural requirements in the interest of judicial economy and
fairness to all parties in the case. Sincerely, Charles Dustin Myers

Charlie Vids Wed, Oct 9, 2024 at 12:06 AM To: "Lindsey K. Baker" Dear Ms.
Baker, Thank you for your response, and would just ask for some
clarification on a couple of things. There are noticable discrepancies
between the file I submitted, accepted and available on the reSearchTX
platform versus what appears in the court's receipt to the Regional Judge.
My original submission was 20.21 MB, while the version in the courts email
is 423 KB. Additionally, my receipt provides no indication that the exhibits
were filed alongside the motion, particularly the affidavit, which is
referenced in the table of contents. The document I submitted was also
hyperlinked, but those links are missing in the court’s receipt. Could you
please clarify which court system the file is currently in and explain for what
purpose the file was modified to appear as if it were an unverified motion? I
would appreciate your prompt attention to this matter at your earliest
convenience. Best regards, Charles Myers Chuckdustin12@gmail.com

Moot.pdf 442K FUDSTOP Tue, Oct 14, 2025 at 7:57 PM To: "Lindsey K.
Baker" Lindsey, This doesn't even make sense. Why would the Regional
Judge deny a notice of intent as if it were a motion? The title is correct in
declaring the notice as moot, but then it goes on to deny the notice as if it
were a recusal motion. More importantly, why did Judge Munford forward a
notice in the first place? Denying a notice isn't even legally comprehensible
to begin with. Under Texas law, a "notice of intent" is not a motion or
pleading and therefore is not subject to denial by the court; the proper
judicial response is to acknowledge the notice or, if relevant, address the
underlying motion, not the notice itself. The court's order "denying" a notice
of intent lacks a legal basis because such notices are not applications for
relief. 12/13/25, 12:15 AM Gmail - Myers 322-744263-23 https://

because it purports to rule on a filing that does not seek any relief. Such an
order may create confusion about the status of the underlying matter and
the court’s reasoning. The proper practice is for the court to address only
those filings that require a judicial decision—namely, motions and, where
appropriate, pleadings. Also, the order claims the Judge denied a single
motion on September 24, 2025 when he denied two motions which were
never filed. The continuous inconsistency is alarming, and this entire
process is comically fraudulent. The law isn't optional, and all of these issues
are being duly documented for future litigation. Unfortunately, quasi judicial
immunity and judicial immunity will not protect you, Judge Munford, Judge
Kaitcer, or Cooper Carter from liability, as everything that occurred after
January 16, 2024, in this matter is void for lack of subject matter jurisdiction
as Judge Munford never signed the required order of referral before
handing the case off to Judge Kaitcer. Also - Cooper L. Carter has been
representing the Petitioner in this matter without authority. Furthermore,
altering an official government record (such as the recusal motions filed) is
not a judicial act, it's administrative, was done outside of the presence of the
parties, and constitutes a predicate act under RICO because these altered
documents relied on interstate wires. I'm done playing these games with the
Court. I've given the Court every possible legal avenue to correct the issues
within this case, but it's clear we aren't even taking a cursory review of the
pleadings that are being filed. I find it hard to believe that David Evans has
been involved in these proceedings. It's perplexing that a judge with his
experience would continue to make these mistakes that defy all logic and
common sense... such as ruling on motions that were never filed, incorrectly
stating the party names, and now denying a notice. The only common thread
between these recurring issues in these recusal proceedings is your
involvement in a process that does not concern you. The Court, by
continuing to allow the criminals on the other side to subvert the rule of law,
is creating a public safety risk by condoning this behavior. Finally, the RICO
suit will be filed in the Western District of Oklahoma, not here. This message
is sent in good faith. I'm simply trying to follow the law and protect the best
interests of my Children. The suit is being brought because I have no other
remedies. The feelings towards me are irrelevant. The law is what matters.
If you were in my shoes, you'd have the same concerns. I hold nothing
against you personally. I just seek a fair process. So far, that has not been
the case, as the record facially demonstrates. I hope you can understand my
point of view. Have a good evening, Charlie [Quoted text hidden]12/13/25,

"Lindsey K. Baker" Hello, Thanks for the update. However, it would be
procedurally improper to set a matter for hearing given noncompliance with
237a Tex. R. CIV. P by Petitioner. Also, the consolidation motion is moot as a
crucial step in this process was not followed by opposing counsel. The Texas
Family Code requires a suit to be transferred prior to any consolidation
taking place. No such transfer has been filed, so any attempt at
consolidation is improper before the prerequisite requirement is met
pursuant to Tex. R. Civ. P. 6.407(b), which is the statute i assume she is
invoking here. For these reasons, it would be more appropriate to set the
matter for hearing on the DWOP filed and served back in January given the
lack of prosecution until now. That way, no further unnecessary delays occur
and the children get the unopposed relief they've been needing. Thank you,

PM To: "Lindsey K. Baker" , Cooper Carter Lindsey, I'm unsure if you've
received my last email, but the transfer motion cannot just be skipped, and I
had requested a hearing for the DWOP prior to this improper request for a
consolidation. Please refer to Texas Family Code 6.407. Not sure what
purpose a hearing on the consolidation would serve granted it's premature
and doesn't comport with Texas Procedure other than to have it summarily
denied as a matter of law, which also seems to defeat the need for a hearing.
I'm available at the court's earliest convenience for a hearing on the DWOP.
If the Court insists on a consolidation hearing despite it beind proceedurally
premature, I would like to request we also hear the pending DWOP
concurrently in the interest of judicial economy.12/13/25, 12:19 AM Gmail -

Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, filed February 22, 2024, remains
unopposed for over a year. Under TRCP 166a(c) and Local Rule 4.01(d), this
motion is ripe for ruling. Opposing counsel’s failure to respond waives any
objection. Further, opposing counsel (CC'ed here), cannot prosecute her
case in accordance with Texas law, and still has an outstanding rule 12
motion that is now also unopposed. A granting of either motion would
resolve the core case issues, and given the circumstances, is duly
warranted. I formally request an immediate ruling or confirmation of when
the Court will act. Further delay is unacceptable. If the judges cannot legally
act given opposing counsels failure to comply with Tex. R. CIV. P. 237a, then
the matter should be brought before David L. Evans without delay. Sincerely,

16, 2025 at 4:26 PM To: "Lindsey K. Baker" Cc: Cooper Carter Hello Lindsey,
I hope you are doing well. I am following up on the Myers v. Myers matter
(Cause No. 322-744263-23 in the 322nd District Court), which was
remanded back from federal court on December 17, 2024. As of today, the
opposing party still has not filed the Notice of Remand or otherwise re-
engaged with the case. This has left our case in limbo on the court’s docket.
In the meantime, Charles Dustin Myers (Respondent), is suffering ongoing
harm each day without the court’s intervention on pending matters. To
recap the situation briefly:12/13/25, 12:19 AM Gmail - Ruling Requested –

Page 3 --- The federal court remanded the case to state court on 12/17/2024.
Under Texas Rule 237a, it was Petitioner’s responsibility to file the remand
order with the clerk and notify us. That never happened. We are now three
months post- remand, and the case has not been officially re-docketed due to
this oversight. I have multiple pending motions that were filed before and
after the remand. Critically, Petitioner and her counsel have not responded
to ANY of these motions. For example, the Motion for Summary Judgment
(filed 2/26/2024) received no response. More urgently, our Ex Parte Motion
for Child Custody, Exclusive Use of Marital Residence, Contempt, and
Sanctions (filed 2/12/2025) remains unopposed and unaddressed. We also
filed a Proposed Order on 2/20/2025 and a Request for Immediate Ruling on
2/28/2025, with no response from the other side. The issues in that ex parte
motion are time-sensitive and critical: we need a court order for custody and
to regain access to the marital home. Opposing counsel’s failure to follow
procedure has effectively stalled relief that desperately needs attention.
(Respondent has been without access to his home and children for an
extended period through no fault of his own). There are also allegations of
contempt by the opposing party that have not been heard because of these
delays. Given this extraordinary situation, we respectfully ask the Court to
take immediate action. Specifically, we request one of the following at the
Court’s earliest convenience (and we truly mean as soon as possible, even
this week if feasible): Immediate ruling/signing of orders: Since the motions
are unopposed, the Court can rule on them without a hearing. I have a

=== PAGE 29 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
proposed Order for the ex parte motion ready for Judge Kaitcer’s signature.
I urge the Court to sign an order granting Respondent temporary custody of
the children and exclusive use of the residence immediately. This would
provide much- needed stability while the case proceeds. Similarly, the
motion for summary judgment can be granted on the papers, as no
controverting evidence or response was ever filed by Petitioner. Emergency
hearing: If the Court prefers to hold a hearing, please provide the soonest
possible date and time for an emergency hearing on the Ex Parte Motion
(2/12/2025), and a notice will be filed tomorrow. I am prepared to appear on
short notice. Given that the motion is unopposed, the hearing should be
brief. Respondent will gladly testify to confirm the facts if needed. He just
needs the Court’s authorization to move forward – every day of delay is
another day he is barred from his home and children. Filing of Remand
Order: To remove any procedural barrier, Respondent will obtain a certified
copy of the federal remand order and he will file it himself (or hand-deliver a
copy) to the Court. If the clerk needs that filed separately to officially reopen
the case, please let me know – it will be done immediately. I do not want a
clerical formality to stand between the children and justice any longer.
Sanctions for non-compliance (if appropriate): Resppndent also wants the
Court to be aware that opposing counsel’s conduct – failing to file the
remand notice and ignoring court filings – is sanctionable. While the priority
is getting relief for the children, the intent is to address this issue at the
appropriate time. For now, this failure should at least not be rewarded by
further delaying proceedings. Respondent shouldn’t have to wait indefinitely
due to the other side’s procedural neglect. In sum, Respondent is asking for
the Court’s help to break the logjam created by the opposing party. Our
requests are straightforward and unopposed. The court has the authority to
grant the relief either ex parte or by default given the circumstances.
Respondent is simply requesting that the Court exercise that authority as
soon as possible to prevent further irreparable harm. My tone in this email
is urgent because the situation is urgent. I have been exceedingly patient
while trying every avenue to move this case forward. With each passing day,
the situation worsens and the children at issue remain in uncertainty. I trust
that the 322nd District Court strives to resolve such matters fairly and
expeditiously, and I am eager to assist in any way to facilitate a prompt
resolution. Proposed next steps: If Judge Kaitcer (or the assigned judge) is
available to review the file tomorrow, we urge him to sign the proposed
Order (filed 2/20/2025) granting the relief in the 2/12/2025 motion. I am
available by phone or email if the Court has any questions or slight
modifications to the order. Alternatively, please provide a setting for an
emergency hearing as early as possible. Even a telephone or Zoom hearing
would be acceptable, given the urgency, if that would expedite the process.
A notice of hearing will be filed Monday. If there are any concerns about the
procedural posture (such as the missing Notice of Remand), please let me
know. I am prepared to cure any such issue immediately. I can file the
remand order and serve opposing counsel (to the extent she will accept
service) to remove any doubt that the case is properly before the Court.

"Lindsey K. Baker" Dear Ms. Baker, Thanks for your response. As I
previously pointed out, the Order of Assignment from Judge David L. Evans
assigned Justice Lee Gabriel to the case. That assignment remains in effect
until Judge Evans issues a written termination order, as stated. To my
knowledge, no such order has been issued or served. Until that occurs, it
would be procedurally improper to request a court hearing, particularly
given that the opposing party has yet to fulfill their obligation under Texas
Rule of Civil Procedure 237a by filing a Notice of Remand after removal to
federal court. It would be helpful if these issues could be resolved as soon as
possible so that the case can proceed effectively. Best regards, Charles

Explain and cite from specific emails how this situation is unacceptable, and
gives the appearance of bias and impartiality, and document tampering.
Answer (Texas)
Short response
The emails in Cause No. 322-744263-23 reveal persistent procedural
irregularities, unexplained alterations to court filings, and failures in
docketing and service, all of which create an appearance of bias, lack of
impartiality, and potential document tampering. These issues undermine
confidence in the fairness and integrity of the judicial process and may
implicate both ethical and criminal statutes under Texas law.
Summary
The correspondence in this case documents repeated failures to follow basic
procedural safeguards, including proper notice, service, and docketing of
filings, as well as unexplained modifications to critical pleadings such as
motions to recuse. The record shows that parties’ objections to these
irregularities were either ignored or dismissed without meaningful
explanation, and that the court’s administrative staff at times appeared to

=== PAGE 32 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
act outside the bounds of their designated roles, further clouding the
transparency and impartiality of the proceedings.
Such conduct, especially when it involves the alteration, omission, or
mishandling of court records, not only gives the appearance of bias and
partiality but also raises serious concerns about document tampering under
Texas Penal Code provisions. The cumulative effect of these actions is to
erode public trust in the judiciary and to call into question the legitimacy of
any orders or judgments issued in the case.
Background and Relevant Law
Legislative Framework
Texas law provides clear statutory guidance on the handling of court records
and the conduct of judicial proceedings:
Tampering with Governmental Records: Texas Penal Code § 37.10
prohibits knowingly making false entries in, or false alterations of,
governmental records, as well as presenting or using records known to
be false, or impairing the verity or availability of such records,
especially with intent to defraud or harm (Tex. Pen. Code § 37.10).
Tampering with or Fabricating Physical Evidence: Texas Penal
Code § 37.09 criminalizes altering, destroying, or concealing any record
or document with intent to impair its verity or availability as evidence
in a pending proceeding (Tex. Pen. Code § 37.09).
Transfer and Consolidation of SAPCRs: Texas Family Code § 6.407
mandates that a suit affecting the parent-child relationship (SAPCR)
must be transferred to the divorce court before consolidation, and the
divorce court cannot act on the SAPCR until the transfer is complete
(Tex. Fam. Code § 6.407).
Case Law
Recusal Procedures and Void Orders: Texas courts have held that
when a motion to recuse is filed, the judge must either recuse
themselves or refer the motion to the presiding judge; any further
orders entered before this is done are void, and failure to follow these
procedures is an abuse of discretion (Rio Grande Valley Gas Co., In re,
987 S.W.2d 167 (Tex. App. 1999)).
Governmental Records and Pleadings: The Texas Court of Criminal
Appeals has clarified that pleadings and court filings are “governmental
records” for purposes of the Penal Code, and knowingly presenting or
using altered or false court documents constitutes tampering (State v.
Vasilas, 187 S.W.3d 486 (Tex. Crim. App. 2006)).
Sanctions for Document Irregularities: Texas courts have imposed
severe sanctions, including striking pleadings, where parties have
destroyed, altered, or produced documents of questionable authenticity,
recognizing the fundamental importance of record integrity (City of
Dallas v. Cox, 793 S.W.2d 701 (Tex. App. 1990)).

Professional Conduct
Fairness in Adjudicatory Proceedings: The Texas Disciplinary Rules
of Professional Conduct emphasize that altering, concealing, or
destroying evidentiary material—including electronic filings—can
frustrate the rights of parties and may constitute a criminal offense,
and that lawyers must avoid even a single intentional violation of
procedural or evidentiary rules (Tex. Disc. R. Prof. Cond. 3.04).
Analysis
1. Procedural Irregularities and Appearance of Bias
The emails reveal a pattern of procedural failures that collectively give the
appearance of bias and lack of impartiality:
Failure to Docket and Serve Filings: Multiple emails from Charles
Myers document that critical filings—including motions for temporary
orders, amended motions, and joint motions to recuse—were accepted
by the electronic filing manager but not docketed or made available to
the parties. Myers repeatedly requested explanations for these
omissions, emphasizing the importance of a complete and accurate
record for all parties and the court. The court coordinator’s responses
either deflected responsibility to the district clerk or failed to provide
substantive answers, leaving the record incomplete and parties
uncertain about the status of their filings.
Unexplained Alterations to Filings: Myers specifically notes that his
joint motion to recuse, which was accepted by the e-filing system at a
file size of over 20 MB and included critical exhibits and affidavits, was
forwarded to the regional judge in a truncated form (423 KB) without
the supporting materials. He further observes that the court
coordinator split the motion into three parts, allegedly due to file size,
but this explanation is inconsistent with the county’s own e-filing
procedures and with how other judges handled similar filings. Myers’
requests for clarification about these discrepancies were not
meaningfully addressed.
Orders of Referral and Recusal: The emails show that orders of
referral for recusal proceedings were sometimes issued without
attaching the underlying motion, or included orders for judges who
were not the subject of the recusal request. Myers points out that
orders were entered denying motions that were never filed, and that
the process was handled inconsistently, with no clear explanation for
the deviations from standard procedure. This is directly contrary to the
requirements set out in Rio Grande Valley Gas Co., In re, 987 S.W.2d
167 (Tex. App. 1999), which mandates strict adherence to recusal
procedures and voids any orders entered in violation thereof.
Administrative Overreach and Lack of Transparency: The court
coordinator, Lindsey K. Baker, is repeatedly involved in substantive
communications about the status and content of filings, sometimes
instructing parties not to “quote the law” to her and asserting that her
role is limited to scheduling. However, the emails show that she was
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 

=== PAGE 34 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
also responsible for transmitting altered or incomplete versions of
pleadings to the regional judge, and for failing to ensure that all parties
received proper notice and service. This blurring of administrative and
substantive roles further undermines the appearance of impartiality.
These failures are not isolated or technical; they go to the heart of due
process and the right to a fair hearing. When parties cannot rely on the
court’s recordkeeping, service, and procedural safeguards, the legitimacy of
the entire proceeding is called into question.
2. Document Tampering and Criminal Implications
The conduct described in the emails raises serious concerns under Texas
criminal law:
Alteration and Omission of Governmental Records: Under Tex.
Pen. Code § 37.10, knowingly altering, omitting, or impairing the verity
or availability of a governmental record—including court filings and
pleadings—constitutes tampering. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals
has held that court filings are governmental records for this purpose
(State v. Vasilas, 187 S.W.3d 486 (Tex. Crim. App. 2006)). The
unexplained reduction in file size, omission of exhibits and affidavits,
and splitting of motions into multiple parts without clear justification all
fall within the conduct contemplated by this statute, especially if done
with intent to affect the outcome of the proceeding or to disadvantage a
party.
Impairment of Evidence: Tex. Pen. Code § 37.09 further criminalizes
the alteration, destruction, or concealment of documents with intent to
impair their use as evidence in a pending proceeding. The repeated
failure to docket filings, the transmission of incomplete motions, and
the lack of transparency about the status of critical pleadings all impair
the ability of the court and the parties to rely on the record as evidence.
Ethical Violations: The Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional
Conduct make clear that even a single intentional violation of
evidentiary or procedural rules—such as altering or concealing material
evidence—can subject a lawyer to discipline and may also constitute a
criminal offense (Tex. Disc. R. Prof. Cond. 3.04). While the emails do not
establish the intent required for criminal liability, they document
conduct that, if intentional, would be both unethical and unlawful.
3. Jurisdictional and Due Process Concerns
Improper Consolidation and Transfer: The emails show that the
court scheduled hearings on motions to consolidate a SAPCR with a
divorce action without first ensuring that the SAPCR had been
transferred from the court with continuing jurisdiction, as required by 
Tex. Fam. Code § 6.407. Myers repeatedly objected to this, citing the
statute and preserving his objections for the record. The court
coordinator’s response was to instruct him to present his arguments in
person at the hearing, rather than to address the jurisdictional defect.
Proceeding in the absence of jurisdiction is not merely a technical
• 
• 
• 
• 

=== PAGE 35 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
error; it is a fundamental violation of due process and renders any
resulting orders void.
Failure to Provide Notice and Service: Myers also documents that
the Texas Office of the Attorney General, a named party, was not
properly served with orders or notices of hearings, and that certificates
of service were missing or contained mismatched names. This failure to
provide notice to all parties is a basic violation of due process and
further undermines the fairness of the proceedings.
4. Appearance of Bias and Impartiality
Inconsistent and Unexplained Procedures: The cumulative effect of
these irregularities is to create a strong appearance of bias and lack of
impartiality. When one party’s filings are not docketed, are altered or
omitted without explanation, and when the court’s administrative staff
is unable or unwilling to provide clear answers, it is reasonable for a
litigant to question whether the process is fair. The Texas Court of
Appeals has recognized that even the appearance of partiality or
improper communications between judges can undermine confidence in
the judiciary (Ludlow v. DeBerry, 959 S.W.2d 265 (Tex. App. 1997)).
Failure to Address or Remedy Objections: Myers’ repeated, detailed
objections to these irregularities were either ignored or dismissed, and
the court proceeded to set hearings and issue orders without resolving
the underlying procedural defects. This disregard for legitimate
concerns about the integrity of the record and the fairness of the
process further erodes public confidence.
5. Sanctions and Remedies
Striking Pleadings and Other Sanctions: Texas courts have not
hesitated to impose severe sanctions, including striking pleadings,
where parties have destroyed, altered, or produced documents of
questionable authenticity (City of Dallas v. Cox, 793 S.W.2d 701 (Tex.
App. 1990)). While the emails do not establish that any party has
sought such sanctions in this case, the conduct described would
support a strong argument for remedial action to restore the integrity
of the proceedings.
Exceptions and Caveats
Intent Requirement for Criminal Liability: While the conduct
described in the emails raises serious concerns, criminal liability under 
Tex. Pen. Code § 37.10 and § 37.09 requires proof of intent to defraud,
harm, or impair the availability of the record. The emails alone do not
establish this intent, but they document a pattern of conduct that
warrants further investigation.
Role of Administrative Staff: The court coordinator’s involvement in
transmitting and modifying filings may have been intended to facilitate
the process, but the lack of transparency and failure to follow
established procedures creates the risk of both actual and perceived
impropriety.

Conclusion
The emails in Cause No. 322-744263-23 document a series of procedural
failures, unexplained alterations to court filings, and administrative
irregularities that collectively create an appearance of bias, lack of
impartiality, and potential document tampering. These actions undermine
the integrity of the judicial process, violate statutory and ethical duties, and
may constitute criminal conduct if done with the requisite intent. The court’s
failure to address or remedy these issues, despite repeated objections,
further erodes public confidence and calls into question the legitimacy of
any orders or judgments issued in the case. The situation demands
immediate corrective action to restore the fairness and transparency
required by law.
Legal Authorities
Ludlow v. DeBerry, 959 S.W.2d 265 (Tex. App. 1997)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
During the recusal hearing, Judge Steib refused to allow Ludlow to call
Judge Chambers to the stand. Judge Steib later admitted talking with Judge
Chambers before the recusal hearing. Judge Steib denied the recusal motion
on May 13, 1993. ... Ludlow moved to re-open the recusal hearing and
moved the court to reconsider its prior rulings. The trial court denied these
motions.
Summary
The passage describes (1) a recusal hearing where the presiding judge
refused a party’s attempt to call another judge as a witness, and (2) an
admission of prior communications between judges about the case before
the recusal hearing. Such facts go to appearance of impartiality and
potential improper ex parte or extra-record communications in a recusal
context under Texas law. While the passage does not address document
tampering, it supports the argument that certain court actions can create an
appearance of bias or partiality, which is germane to objections about
irregular recusal procedures.
Rio Grande Valley Gas Co., In re, 987 S.W.2d 167 (Tex. App. 1999)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Mandamus will issue only to correct a clear abuse of discretion when there
is no adequate remedy by appeal... A trial court abuses its discretion when it

=== PAGE 37 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
does not follow guiding rules and principles and reaches an arbitrary and
unreasonable decision.... When a motion to recuse has been filed, a judge
must either recuse him- or herself or request the presiding administrative
judge to assign another judge to hear the motion.... Any order other than an
order of recusal or referral, entered by a court after a proper motion to
recuse is entered is void.... Rule 18a(c) requires a judge to either recuse
himself or request the presiding judge to assign a judge to hear a recusal
motion 'prior to any further proceedings in the case.'
Summary
The case establishes that once a proper recusal motion is filed, the judge
must either recuse or refer to the regional presiding judge, and the court
may not take further action; orders other than recusal/referral during
pendency are void. Failure to follow these mandatory steps is an abuse of
discretion correctable by mandamus.
City of Dallas v. Cox, 793 S.W.2d 701 (Tex. App. 1990)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The trial court required the Chief of Police... to identify any written
documents formerly possessed that had been destroyed, mutilated, altered,
or lost... The trial court ordered production of all written documents
authorizing or directing the destruction, mutilation, alteration, or loss of
those documents... [T]he court finds that the City of Dallas has destroyed,
misplaced, or withheld relevant materials... and has produced evidence and
documents of questionable character and authenticity... The trial court
ordered that Dallas’s pleadings ‘shall be and hereby are stricken without the
right to further plead.’
Summary
The case supports that altering, withholding, or producing “documents of
questionable character and authenticity,” and belated production frustrating
inquiry, justify severe sanctions, including striking pleadings. It is relevant
by analogy to claims of docket/document irregularities and altered filings
because it shows Texas courts’ intolerance for record tampering and
discovery abuse and the availability of sanctions.
State v. Vasilas, 187 S.W.3d 486 (Tex. Crim. App. 2006)
Texas Court of Criminal Appeals

=== PAGE 38 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
We granted the State's petition for discretionary review to decide whether a
petition for expunction qualifies as a 'governmental record' under section
37.01 of the Texas Penal Code... One definition of a governmental record is
'anything belonging to, received by, or kept by government for information,
including a court record.'... We will resolve whether pleadings filed with but
not issued by a court fall within the definition of a governmental record
pursuant to § 37.01(2)(A). ... The court of appeals affirmed the trial court,
holding that 'the petition for expunction filed by appellee was not a
governmental record within the meaning of chapter 37 of the penal code.' ...
We will reverse the court of appeals' decision. ... Section 37.10(a)(5)
provides that a person commits the offense of tampering with a
governmental record if he 'makes, presents, or uses a governmental record
with knowledge of its falsity.' ... Pursuant to § 37.10(c)(1), this offense is 'a
Class A misdemeanor unless the actor's intent is to defraud or harm another,
in which event the offense is a state jail felony.'
Summary
The Court of Criminal Appeals held that certain court-related documents
filed with a court can constitute “governmental records” under Penal Code §
37.01(2)(A), reversing a contrary intermediate ruling. Section 37.10(a)(5)
criminalizes making, presenting, or using a governmental record with
knowledge of its falsity, with enhanced punishment if done to defraud or
harm. This provides a Texas criminal-law framework for characterizing
alteration or falsification of filed court documents (including pleadings) as
tampering with a governmental record.
Tex. Gov't. Code § 23.303 Tex. Gov't. Code § 23.303 Procedures Related to
Motions For Summary Judgment; Annual Report
Extract
a) The business court, a district court, or a statutory county court shall, with
respect to a motion for summary judgment: set the motion for a hearing by
oral argument or by submission on a date not later than: (A) the 60th day
after the date the motion was filed; or (B) the 90th day after the date the
motion was filed ... and file with the clerk of the court and provide to the
parties a written ruling on the motion not later than the 90th day after the
date the motion was heard or considered. (b) The court shall record in the
docket the date the motion was heard or considered. ... (c) A clerk ... shall
report the court's compliance ... quarterly ... (d) The Office of Court
Administration ... shall prepare an annual report ... and make the report
publicly available. ... History: ... eff. 12/4/2025. ... Added ... eff. 9/1/2025.

Summary
The statute imposes mandatory deadlines to set, hear/consider, and issue a
written ruling on MSJs, requires docket notation of the hearing/
consideration date, and mandates compliance reporting. It became effective
Sept. 1, 2025 (added) and was amended effective Dec. 4, 2025.
Tex. Fam. Code § 6.407 Tex. Fam. Code § 6.407 Transfer of Suit Affecting
Parent-Child Relationship to Divorce Court
Extract
(a) If a suit affecting the parent-child relationship is pending at the time the
suit for dissolution of a marriage is filed, the suit affecting the parent-child
relationship shall be transferred as provided by Section FAMILY CODE
103.002 to the court in which the suit for dissolution is filed. (b) If the
parties are parents of a child... and the child is under the continuing
jurisdiction of another court under Chapter 155, either party... may move
that court for transfer... The court with continuing jurisdiction shall transfer
the proceeding as provided by Chapter 155. On the transfer of the
proceedings, the court with jurisdiction of the suit for dissolution of a
marriage shall consolidate the two causes of action. (c) After transfer... the
court with jurisdiction of the suit for dissolution of a marriage has
jurisdiction to render an order...
Summary
§ 6.407 requires transfer of a pending SAPCR to the divorce court and
makes consolidation contingent on transfer. It implies a trial court lacks
authority to consolidate SAPCR matters absent a proper transfer from the
court with continuing jurisdiction. This bears on emails scheduling a
“Motion to Consolidate” without any prior transfer and objections noting
that defect.
Tex. Pen. Code § 37.10 Tex. Pen. Code § 37.10 Tampering With
Governmental Record
Extract
A person commits an offense if he: knowingly makes a false entry in, or false
alteration of, a governmental record; makes, presents, or uses any record,
document, or thing with knowledge of its falsity and with intent that it be
taken as a genuine governmental record; [or] intentionally destroys,
conceals, removes, or otherwise impairs the verity, legibility, or availability
of a governmental record." And: "Except as provided by [other subdivisions],
an offense under this section is a Class A misdemeanor unless the actor's
intent is to defraud or harm another, in which event the offense is a state jail
felony.

=== PAGE 40 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
Section 37.10 criminalizes false entries or alterations to governmental
records, using a record known to be false as genuine, and impairing the
verity/availability of such records. If intent to defraud or harm is present,
the offense escalates. This statute provides the legal framework to analyze
allegations that case filings, orders of referral, or recusal motions were
altered, split, or transmitted in a form that impaired their verity or
availability (e.g., claims in the emails that exhibits/affidavits were omitted,
files split, or sizes changed). However, the statute itself does not determine
whether document tampering occurred in the described case; it only defines
the offense elements that could apply if the facts are proven.
Tex. Pen. Code § 37.09 Tex. Pen. Code § 37.09 Tampering With Or
Fabricating Physical Evidence
Extract
A person commits an offense if, knowing that an investigation or official
proceeding is pending or in progress, he: alters, destroys, or conceals any
record, document, or thing with intent to impair its verity, legibility, or
availability as evidence in the investigation or official proceeding; or makes,
presents, or uses any record, document, or thing with knowledge of its
falsity and with intent to affect the course or outcome of the investigation or
official proceeding." and "An offense under Subsection (a) ... is a felony of
the third degree
Summary
Tex. Pen. Code § 37.09 criminalizes altering, destroying, concealing, or using
falsified records or documents, when done knowingly during a pending
investigation or official proceeding, with intent to impair their verity/
availability or to affect the proceeding’s outcome. It applies broadly to court
proceedings. This provision frames how alleged “document tampering” in a
Texas court matter would be assessed. It does not itself prove tampering
occurred in the emails, but supplies the governing rule to evaluate conduct
such as forwarding altered filings or using truncated versions “to affect the
course or outcome.”
Rule 3.04. Fairness In Adjudicatory Proceedings
Extract
Documents and other evidence are often essential to establish a claim or
defense... The exercise of that right can be frustrated if relevant material is
altered, concealed or destroyed. Applicable law in many jurisdictions,
including Texas, makes it an offense to destroy material for the purpose of
impairing its availability in a pending proceeding or one whose

=== PAGE 41 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
commencement can be foreseen. See Texas Penal Code, §§ 37.09(a),
37.10(a). ... Falsifying evidence is also generally a criminal offense. Id. §§
37.09(a), 37.10(a).... Paragraph (a) of this Rule applies to evidentiary
material generally, including computerized information." "Paragraph (c)
subjects a lawyer to discipline only for habitual abuses of procedural or
evidentiary rules... A lawyer in good conscience should not engage in even a
single intentional violation of those rules, however, and a lawyer may be
subject to judicial sanctions for doing so." "The obligations imposed by
[paragraph (c)] to avoid seeking to influence the outcome of a matter by
introducing irrelevant or improper considerations into the deliberative
process are important aspects of a lawyer's duty to maintain the fairness
and impartiality of adjudicatory proceedings.
Summary
The quoted comments establish that altering or falsifying evidentiary
material (including electronic filings) can frustrate discovery rights and may
constitute criminal offenses (Tex. Penal Code §§ 37.09, 37.10). They also
underscore duties to avoid procedural abuses and improper influences that
undermine fairness and impartiality. While the Rule governs lawyer
discipline, its principles are directly pertinent to allegations of altered filings
or procedural manipulation.
