County File DAVID L. EV ANS, PRESIDING JUDGE EIGHTH
ADMINISTRATIVE JUDICIAL REGION OF TEXAS --- If the regional presiding
judge never properly reinstated the trial judge and never officially relieved
the visiting judge, if the trial judge sua sponte set the case for final trial
after the motion to recuse was denied, is this a legal error?
Answer (Texas)
Short response
Yes, it is a legal error for the trial judge to set the case for final trial sua
sponte after a motion to recuse was denied, if the regional presiding judge
never properly reinstated the trial judge and never officially relieved the
visiting judge. Under Texas law, only the assigned judge retains authority
until the presiding judge issues a written order reinstating the original judge
or relieving the assigned judge, and any action taken by a judge without
proper authority is void.

Summary
Texas statutes and case law establish a strict procedural framework for
judicial recusal and the assignment of visiting judges. When a motion to
recuse is filed and a visiting judge is assigned, the original trial judge loses
all authority over the case until the regional presiding judge formally
reinstates them and relieves the visiting judge through a written order
entered into the record.
If the presiding judge fails to issue such an order, the visiting judge remains
the only judge with authority over the case, and any action taken by the
original trial judge—such as setting the case for final trial—is void and
constitutes a legal error. This rule is designed to preserve the integrity of
the recusal process and ensure that only duly authorized judges exercise
judicial power in the matter.
Background and Relevant Law
Legislative Framework
The Texas Government Code and Texas Rules of Civil Procedure provide the
primary statutory and procedural rules governing judicial recusal and the
assignment of visiting judges.
Texas Government Code § 24.002 requires that if a district judge
determines they should recuse themselves, they must enter a recusal order,
request the presiding judge of the administrative judicial region to assign
another judge, and take no further action in the case except for good cause
stated in the order. This provision is mandatory and applies to all district
judges in Texas.
Texas Government Code § 74.059 states that a judge assigned under this
chapter has all the powers of the judge of the court to which they are
assigned. This means that once a visiting judge is assigned, they possess the
full authority of the original judge until officially relieved.
Texas Government Code § 74.053 and § 25.00255 further clarify the
assignment process and the scope of authority for assigned judges,
emphasizing the need for clear, written orders and proper notice to all
parties.
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a is the central procedural rule for
recusal. It provides that when a motion to recuse is filed, the judge must
either recuse themselves or refer the motion to the regional presiding judge.
Once recused, the judge must not take further action in the case unless
there is good cause stated in writing or on the record. If the judge declines
to recuse, they must forward the motion to the presiding judge and refrain
from further action until the motion is resolved.

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Case Law
Texas appellate courts have consistently enforced these statutory and
procedural requirements. The following principles are established by the
case law:
Once a judge recuses themselves or a motion to recuse is referred, the
judge must not take further action in the case until the motion is
resolved and the judge is properly reinstated by written order of the
presiding judge (Ex parte Thuesen, 546 S.W.3d 145, 147 (Tex. Crim.
App. 2017); Cantu v. Moore, 13-23-00087-CV (Tex. App. Dec 12, 2024)).
The authority of a visiting judge is derived solely from the order of
assignment, and the visiting judge retains authority until officially
relieved by the presiding judge (In re B.F.B., 241 S.W.3d 643 (Tex. App.
2007)).
Any action taken by a judge without proper authority—such as acting
before being reinstated or after recusal—is void (In re Gold,
04-25-00085-CV (Tex. App. May 07, 2025); In re Norman, 191 S.W.3d
858 (Tex. App. 2006); Mixon v. Moye, 860 S.W.2d 209 (Tex. App. 1993)).
Orders regarding recusal, reinstatement, or modification of judicial
authority must be made in writing, signed by the presiding judge, and
entered of record (Ex parte Thuesen, 546 S.W.3d 145, 156 (Tex. Crim.
App. 2017)).
Analysis
The Assignment and Authority of Judges
When a motion to recuse is filed, the original trial judge must either recuse
themselves or refer the motion to the regional presiding judge. If the judge
recuses, the presiding judge assigns a visiting judge to handle the recusal
motion and any related matters. The visiting judge’s authority is defined by
the order of assignment and continues until the presiding judge issues a
written order relieving the visiting judge and, if appropriate, reinstating the
original judge (In re B.F.B., 241 S.W.3d 643 (Tex. App. 2007)).
Texas Government Code § 74.059 confirms that an assigned judge has all
the powers of the judge of the court to which they are assigned. Therefore,
unless and until the presiding judge issues a written order relieving the
visiting judge, the visiting judge remains the only judge with authority over
the case.
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a and the related case law make clear
that the original judge, once recused or once a recusal motion is referred,
cannot take further action in the case unless and until they are properly
reinstated by the presiding judge. This rule is strictly enforced to prevent
any appearance of impropriety or partiality and to maintain the integrity of
the judicial process (In re Amos, 397 S.W.3d 309 (Tex. App. 2013); Villareal
v. State, 348 S.W.3d 365 (Tex. App. 2011)).

Void Actions and Legal Error
If the presiding judge never issues a written order reinstating the original
trial judge or relieving the visiting judge, the original judge remains without
authority to act in the case. Any action taken by the original judge in this
period—including setting the case for final trial—is void (In re Gold,
04-25-00085-CV (Tex. App. May 07, 2025); In re Norman, 191 S.W.3d 858
(Tex. App. 2006); Mixon v. Moye, 860 S.W.2d 209 (Tex. App. 1993)).
The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals in Ex parte Thuesen, 546 S.W.3d 145
(Tex. Crim. App. 2017) held that a judge who has recused themselves cannot
take further action in the case unless there is a subsequent written order,
signed by the presiding judge, reinstating them. Any such order must be
entered into the record. The same principle applies to the scenario where a
visiting judge has been assigned: the original judge cannot resume authority
until the presiding judge formally reinstates them.
Similarly, the Texas Court of Appeals in Cantu v. Moore, 13-23-00087-CV
(Tex. App. Dec 12, 2024) reiterated that once a judge recuses themselves,
they lose all judicial authority in the case, and any subsequent action is void
unless the judge is properly reinstated.
The rule is further reinforced by In re Gold, 04-25-00085-CV (Tex. App. May
07, 2025), which states that after a motion to recuse is filed, the judge must
either recuse or refer the motion, and cannot take further action until the
motion is resolved. Any orders made in violation of this rule are void.
The Role of the Presiding Judge
The presiding judge of the administrative judicial region has exclusive
authority to assign judges to hear recusal motions and to reassign or
reinstate judges following recusal proceedings (In re Alpert, 276 S.W.3d 592
(Tex. App. 2008); In re PG & E Reata Energy, et al, 4 S.W.3d 897 (Tex. App.
1999)). Local rules or informal practices cannot override this authority.
Any order reinstating the original judge or relieving the visiting judge must
be in writing, signed by the presiding judge, and entered into the record (Ex
parte Thuesen, 546 S.W.3d 145, 156 (Tex. Crim. App. 2017)). Without such
an order, the original judge remains without authority, and the visiting judge
continues to hold judicial power over the case.
Application to the Present Scenario
In the scenario described, the regional presiding judge assigned a visiting
judge to hear the recusal motions. If the presiding judge never issued a
written order reinstating the original trial judge or relieving the visiting
judge, the visiting judge remained the only judge with authority over the
case. The original trial judge, therefore, had no authority to set the case for
final trial sua sponte after the motion to recuse was denied.
Any such action by the original trial judge is void and constitutes a legal
error under Texas law. This is not a mere technicality; it is a fundamental

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
requirement designed to ensure the impartiality and integrity of the judicial
process.
Authority of the Visiting Judge
The scope of the visiting judge’s authority is defined by the order of
assignment. If the order assigns the visiting judge to hear all pending and
subsequent motions to recuse or disqualify, the visiting judge retains
authority over those matters until officially relieved. The original judge
cannot resume authority until the presiding judge issues a written order to
that effect (In re B.F.B., 241 S.W.3d 643 (Tex. App. 2007)).
Voidness of Orders
Texas courts have repeatedly held that any orders or actions taken by a
judge without proper authority—such as acting after recusal or before
reinstatement—are void and must be set aside (In re Norman, 191 S.W.3d
858 (Tex. App. 2006); Mixon v. Moye, 860 S.W.2d 209 (Tex. App. 1993); 
Brosseau v. Ranzau, 911 S.W.2d 890 (Tex. App. 1995)). Although Brosseau v.
Ranzau, 28 S.W.3d 235 (Tex. App. 2000) was later overruled by Brosseau v.
Ranzau, 58 S.W.3d 305 (Tex. App. 2001), the principle that actions taken
without proper authority are void remains well established in subsequent
and controlling case law.
Exceptions and Caveats
There are limited exceptions to the rule that a judge cannot act after recusal
or before reinstatement. The only exception is if there is good cause stated
in writing or on the record for the judge to take further action while a
recusal motion is pending (In re Gold, 04-25-00085-CV (Tex. App. May 07,
2025)). However, this exception does not apply to the situation where the
judge has not been properly reinstated after a recusal motion is denied.
Additionally, if the recusal motion is a tertiary motion (the third or
subsequent motion for recusal by the same party), Texas Civil Practice and
Remedies Code § 30.016 allows the judge to continue presiding and moving
the case forward as if the motion had not been filed. However, this exception
is narrow and applies only to tertiary motions, which is not indicated in the
present scenario.
Conclusion
In summary, Texas law is clear that once a visiting judge is assigned to a
case following a recusal motion, the original trial judge cannot resume
authority or take any action in the case—including setting it for final trial—
unless and until the regional presiding judge issues a written order
reinstating the original judge and relieving the visiting judge. Any action
taken by the original judge without such authority is void and constitutes a
legal error. This strict procedural requirement is designed to protect the
integrity of the judicial process and ensure that only duly authorized judges

=== PAGE 6 ===

exercise judicial power in the matter. The failure to follow these procedures
can result in the setting aside of any orders or actions taken without proper
authority.
Legal Authorities
Torch Energy Marketing, Inc., In re, 989 S.W.2d 20 (Tex. App. 1998)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Rule 18a establishes the procedure to be followed in filing a motion to
recuse. Once a motion to recuse is filed, the rule provides that 'the judge
shall either recuse himself or request the presiding judge of the
administrative judicial district to assign a judge to hear such motion.' TEX.R.
CIV. P. 18a (c). This language establishes the procedure to be followed when
a motion to recuse is filed, it does not operate as the authority under which
the presiding judge will make the assignment. Such authority is granted by
Chapter 74 of the Government Code.
Summary
Rule 18a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure outlines the procedure for
filing a motion to recuse a judge. Once such a motion is filed, the judge in
question must either recuse themselves or request the presiding judge to
assign another judge to hear the motion. The authority for assigning a judge
comes from Chapter 74 of the Texas Government Code. If the presiding
judge does not properly reinstate the trial judge or relieve the visiting judge,
it could potentially be a procedural error, as the proper procedure for
handling motions to recuse involves specific steps and authority as outlined
in the rules and code.
In re B.F.B., 241 S.W.3d 643 (Tex. App. 2007)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The Murphys argue, in the dispositive point of error, that the visiting judge
lacked authority to hear the case and that the resulting final order is void.
The Murphys' argument reasons that a visiting judge's authority originates
solely from the order of assignment and that the order of assignment in this
case assigned the visiting judge to hear only the motion to recuse... The
substance of the order of assignment indisputably limits the visiting judge's
authority to the motion to recuse. The visiting judge lacked authority to hear
the case on its merits... When a visiting judge's actions exceed the scope of
the assignment, the Texas Supreme Court has held the judgment void.

Summary
The authority of a visiting judge in Texas is derived solely from the order of
assignment. If the order of assignment limits the visiting judge's authority to
a specific matter, such as a motion to recuse, the judge cannot preside over
other matters, such as the merits of the case, without exceeding their
authority. If a visiting judge acts beyond the scope of their assignment, any
resulting judgment is considered void. This principle is applicable to the
question at hand, as it addresses the issue of whether a trial judge can set a
case for trial after a motion to recuse is denied without proper
reinstatement or relief of the visiting judge.
In re Amos, 397 S.W.3d 309 (Tex. App. 2013)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
If a judge recuses himself or herself, the judge thereby voluntarily steps out
of the case for all purposes and another judge is immediately assigned to
hear and dispose of the case. If a judge refers the motion to recuse to the
presiding administrative judge, the rules require the challenged judge to
step aside and another judge to be assigned to resolve the motion. Once the
challenged judge refers the motion for another judge to decide, the
challenged judge must take no further action in the case until the motion is
decided, except for good cause stated in writing or on the record. Tex. R.
Civ. P. 18a(f)(2)(A) (concerning motions to recuse filed before evidence has
been offered at trial).
Summary
Once a motion to recuse is filed, the challenged judge must step aside and
take no further action in the case until the motion is decided. This rule is
designed to preserve the impartiality of the judiciary and ensure that the
recusal process is handled by an independent judge. If the regional
presiding judge did not properly reinstate the trial judge or relieve the
visiting judge, and the trial judge set the case for trial sua sponte, it could
be considered a legal error because it violates the procedure outlined in
Rule 18a.

Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Subsections (c) and (d) of rule 18a provide: (c) Prior to any further
proceedings in the case, the judge shall either recuse himself or request the

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
presiding judge of the administrative judicial district to assign a judge to
hear such motion. If the judge recuses himself, he shall enter an order of
recusal and request the presiding judge of the administrative judicial district
to assign another judge to sit, and shall make no further orders and shall
take no further action in the case except for good cause stated in the order
in which such action is taken. (d) If the judge declines to recuse himself, he
shall forward to the presiding judge of the administrative judicial district, in
either original form or certified copy, an order of referral, the motion, and all
opposing and concurring statements. Except for good cause stated in the
order in which further action is taken, the judge shall make no further
orders and shall take no further action in the case after filing of the motion
and prior to a hearing on the motion.
Summary
Rule 18a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure outlines the procedure for
handling motions to recuse judges. Specifically, if a judge declines to recuse
themselves, they must forward the motion to the presiding judge of the
administrative judicial district and make no further orders or take any
further action in the case until a hearing on the motion is conducted. This
implies that if a trial judge sets a case for final trial sua sponte after a
motion to recuse is denied, without proper reinstatement or relief of the
visiting judge, it could be considered a legal error as it contravenes the
procedural requirements outlined in Rule 18a.
In re PG & E Reata Energy, et al, 4 S.W.3d 897 (Tex. App. 1999)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Once rule 18a was properly invoked, only Judge Hester, the regional
presiding judge (or in certain circumstances, the Chief Justice of the Texas
Supreme Court), had authority to appoint a judge to hear the recusal motion
and sit over the case when the motion was granted. The Hidalgo County
Local Rules must be harmonized with the mandatory procedures of rule 18a
and 74.059(c)(3). Accordingly, the local rules do not and cannot empower
Judge Gonzalez to overrule the regional presiding judge's order appointing
Judge Westergren to hear the cases through trial.
Summary
Once a Rule 18a motion to recuse is properly invoked, only the regional
presiding judge has the authority to appoint a judge to hear the recusal
motion and preside over the case. The passage emphasizes that local rules
cannot override the authority of the regional presiding judge in this context.
This suggests that if the regional presiding judge did not properly reinstate
the trial judge or relieve the visiting judge, any actions taken by the trial
judge, such as setting the case for trial, could be considered a legal error.

Summary
Rule 18a outlines the procedures a judge must follow when a motion to
recuse is filed. Specifically, the judge must either recuse themselves or
request the presiding judge to assign another judge to hear the motion.
Importantly, the judge should not take further action in the case until the
motion is resolved, unless there is good cause stated. This suggests that if a
trial judge sets a case for trial sua sponte after a motion to recuse is denied,
without proper reinstatement or relief of the visiting judge, it could be
considered a legal error.

Rule 18a imposes certain mandatory requirements on a judge once a motion
to recuse is filed: (c) Prior to any further proceedings in the case, the judge
shall either recuse himself or request the presiding judge of the

judge recuses himself, he shall enter an order of recusal and request the
presiding judge of the administrative judicial district to assign another judge

further action is taken, the judge shall make no further orders and shall take
no further action in the case after filing of the motion and prior to a hearing
on the motion.
Summary
Rule 18a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure mandates that once a motion
to recuse is filed, the judge must either recuse themselves or refer the
motion to the presiding judge of the administrative judicial district. The
judge is prohibited from taking further action in the case until the motion is
resolved, except for good cause. If the regional presiding judge did not
properly reinstate the trial judge and did not officially relieve the visiting
judge, and the trial judge set the case for trial sua sponte after the motion to
recuse was denied, it could be considered a legal error. This is because the
trial judge would be taking action in the case without proper authority, as
the visiting judge was not officially relieved.
In re Wilhite, 298 S.W.3d 754 (Tex. App. 2009)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
In Texas, a judge may be removed from a case because he is constitutionally
disqualified, subject to a statutory strike, or recused. ... The pertinent
standard for recusal is that a 'judge shall recuse himself in any proceeding
in which: (a) his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.' See TEX.R.
CIV. P. 18b(2). ... Mandamus relief is proper when a trial court erroneously
denies a motion to disqualify. ... Unlike statutory recusal, disqualification
cannot be waived, and may be raised at any time.
Summary
Grounds and procedures for judicial disqualification and recusal in Texas. It
emphasizes that a judge must recuse themselves if their impartiality might
reasonably be questioned. It also notes that disqualification cannot be
waived and can be raised at any time. This is relevant to the question
because it addresses the procedural requirements and potential errors
related to judicial recusal and disqualification.

Extract
Under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a, Judge Austin had a mandatory
duty either to recuse himself or to refer the recusal motion to the presiding
judge. TEX.R. CIV. P. 18a. Furthermore, section 74.059(c)(3) of the
Government Code states that a district, statutory probate, or statutory
county court judge shall 'request the presiding judge to assign another judge
to hear a motion relating to the recusal of the judge from a case pending in
his court.' TEX. GOV'T CODE ANN. § 74.059(c)(3) (Vernon 2005). Judge
Austin did not have the option of denying the motion... If a judge fails to
comply with the rules governing motions for recusal, all subsequent actions
by the judge in that case are void.
Summary
Under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a and section 74.059(c)(3) of the
Government Code, a judge has a mandatory duty to either recuse
themselves or refer the recusal motion to the presiding judge. If a judge fails
to comply with these rules, all subsequent actions by the judge in that case
are void. This indicates that if the regional presiding judge did not properly
reinstate the trial judge and did not officially relieve the visiting judge, and
the trial judge set the case for final trial after the motion to recuse was
denied, it could be considered a legal error, as the actions taken by the
judge may be void.
Brosseau v. Ranzau, 911 S.W.2d 890 (Tex. App. 1995)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
We agree with appellant that the trial judge erred by violating Rule 18a of
the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure in failing to either recuse himself or refer
the motion to recuse to the presiding judge of the administrative judicial
district... If a trial court fails to comply with the rules provided for in Rule
18a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, all actions taken by the judge
subsequent to such violation are void.
Summary
Rule 18a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure mandates that a judge must
either recuse themselves or refer the motion to the presiding judge of the
administrative judicial district when faced with a motion to recuse. If the
judge fails to comply with these requirements, any actions taken by the
judge after such a violation are considered void. This indicates that if a trial
judge sets a case for final trial after a motion to recuse is denied without
proper reinstatement or relief of the visiting judge, it could be a legal error,
as actions taken after a violation of Rule 18a are void.

Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
TEX.R.CIV.P. 18a provides: (a) At least ten days before the date set for trial
or other hearing ... any party may file with the clerk of the court a motion
stating grounds why the judge before whom the case is pending should not
sit in the case.... (c) Prior to any further proceedings in the case, the judge
shall either recuse himself or request the presiding judge of the
administrative judicial district to assign a judge to hear such motion. If a
judge decides to recuse himself, he shall enter an order of recusal and
request the presiding judge of the administrative judicial district to assign
another judge to sit, and shall make no further orders and shall take no
further action in the case except for good cause stated in the order in which
such action is taken. (d) If the judge declines to recuse himself, he shall
forward to the presiding judge of the administrative judicial district ... an
order of referral, the motion, and all opposing and concurring statements.
Summary
Rule 18a outlines the procedure for recusal of judges in Texas. It specifies
that if a motion for recusal is filed, the judge must either recuse themselves
or refer the motion to the presiding judge of the administrative judicial
district. The judge is not to take further action in the case unless there is
good cause stated. If the presiding judge did not properly reinstate the trial
judge or relieve the visiting judge, and the trial judge set the case for trial
sua sponte after a motion to recuse was denied, it could be a legal error if
the proper procedures outlined in Rule 18a were not followed.
Gaines v. Gaines, 677 S.W.2d 727 (Tex. App. 1984)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
In McLeod v. Harris, 582 S.W.2d 772 (Tex.1979), it was held that under the
express terms of Article 200a, § 6, the trial judge had a mandatory duty to
request the presiding judge to assign another district judge to hear the
motion to recuse. The Court pointed out, however, that the motion to recuse
does not in itself disqualify the judge.
Summary
Under Texas law, specifically Article 200a, § 6, a trial judge has a mandatory
duty to request the presiding judge to assign another district judge to hear a
motion to recuse. However, the mere filing of a motion to recuse does not
automatically disqualify the judge from presiding over the case. This implies

=== PAGE 13 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
that if the presiding judge did not properly reinstate the trial judge or
relieve the visiting judge, and the trial judge set the case for trial sua sponte
after the motion to recuse was denied, it could potentially be a procedural
error if the proper protocol for handling recusal motions was not followed.

At the outset, we note that the denial of a motion to recuse is appealable
upon final judgment. Tex.R. Civ. P. 18a(f). A writ of mandamus is not
available to address the denial of a motion to recuse. In re Union Pac. Res.
Co., 969 S.W.2d 427, 428-29 (Tex.1998) ('the appellate court can cure any
harm by reversing the trial court's judgment and remanding for a new trial
before a different judge').
Summary
The denial of a motion to recuse is appealable upon final judgment, and any
harm can be cured by the appellate court by reversing the trial court's
judgment and remanding for a new trial before a different judge. This
suggests that if there was an error in the process of reinstating the trial
judge or relieving the visiting judge, it could potentially be addressed on
appeal.
Mann v. Denton Cnty., NO. 02-13-00217-CV (Tex. App. Oct 09, 2014)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
After a judge is voluntarily or involuntarily recused from a case, the judge
generally must not make further orders nor take further action. See In re
Amos, 397 S.W.3d 309, 314 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2013, orig. proceeding) ('Any
involvement by the recused judge after recusal can only disserve the public
policy of preserving public confidence in the impartiality of the judiciary.');
Mixon v. Moye, 860 S.W.2d 209, 210 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 1993, orig.
proceeding). In fact, under some circumstances, a judge loses authority to
act, at least temporarily, upon a party's motion for recusal. Under rule of
civil procedure 18a, when a party files a motion to recuse a judge before
evidence has been offered at trial, the judge 'must take no further action in
the case until the motion has been decided, except for good cause stated in
writing or on the record.' Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a(f)(2)(A). When a motion to
recuse is granted, an administrative judge 'must transfer the case to another
court or assign another judge to the case.' Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a(g)(7). Typically,

=== PAGE 14 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
any order signed by a recused judge (or a judge against whom a recusal
motion is pending) is wholly void and must be set aside.
Summary
The passage explains that once a judge is recused, they must not take
further action in the case. If a motion to recuse is pending, the judge must
refrain from taking action until the motion is decided, unless there is good
cause stated in writing or on the record. If a motion to recuse is granted, the
case must be transferred to another court or judge. Any orders made by a
recused judge or a judge with a pending recusal motion are typically void.
This indicates that if the trial judge set the case for final trial after a motion
to recuse was denied, without proper reinstatement or relief of the visiting
judge, it could be considered a legal error.
Woodruff v. Wright, 51 S.W.3d 727 (Tex. App. 2001)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
When a motion to recuse has been filed, a judge must either recuse himself
or request the presiding administrative judge to assign another judge to
hear the motion. Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a(a),(c),(d). ... The Texas Rules of Civil
Procedure provide that a judge shall recuse himself in any proceeding in
which 'his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.' Tex. R. Civ. P. 18b(2)
(a). ... Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a does not prohibit a party from filing more than one
recusal motion against a trial judge. However, it is not clear that a party may
seek a recusal and obtain a hearing and then later again attempt to obtain
the same relief through another hearing covering the same matters.
Summary
Procedure for handling motions to recuse judges in Texas, emphasizing that
a judge must either recuse themselves or have another judge assigned to
hear the motion. It also highlights that a judge should recuse themselves if
their impartiality might reasonably be questioned. The passage further
clarifies that while multiple recusal motions can be filed, it is not clear if a
party can repeatedly seek the same relief through multiple hearings on the
same matters. This information is relevant to understanding whether the
trial judge's actions in setting the case for trial after a recusal motion was
denied could be considered a legal error, especially if the visiting judge was
not officially relieved.

Texas Court of Appeals

=== PAGE 15 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
A judge that recuses sua sponte 'shall enter a recusal order, request the
presiding judge of that administrative judicial region to assign another judge
to sit, and take no further action in the case except for good cause stated in
the' recusal order. Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 24.002... '[O]nce a district judge
signs an order recusing himself or herself under the statute, the recused
judge no longer has any judicial authority to take any action or sign any
orders in the case.'
Summary
The passage from Cantu v. Moore explains that once a judge recuses
themselves, they must request the presiding judge to assign another judge
and cannot take further action in the case. This indicates that if a trial judge
sets a case for trial after a recusal motion is denied without proper
reinstatement, it could be a legal error, as the judge would lack authority to
act without being officially reinstated.
In re Burns
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
A respondent judge, within three business days after a motion to recuse is
filed, must sign and file with the clerk (1) an order of recusal or
disqualification; or (2) an order referring the motion to the regional
presiding judge. Tex.R.Civ.P. 18a(f). 'An order denying a motion to recuse
may be reviewed only for abuse of discretion on appeal from the final
judgment.' Tex.R.Civ.P. 18a(j)(1)(A). But 'mandamus relief is available when a
judge violates a mandatory statutory duty either to recuse or refer a motion
to recuse.'
Summary
Procedural requirements for a judge when a motion to recuse is filed.
Specifically, the judge must either recuse themselves or refer the motion to
the regional presiding judge within three business days. If a judge fails to
comply with this mandatory duty, mandamus relief is available. The passage
also notes that an order denying a motion to recuse can only be reviewed for
abuse of discretion on appeal from the final judgment.
In re Gold, 04-25-00085-CV (Tex. App. May 07, 2025)
Texas Court of Appeals

=== PAGE 16 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a(f)(1) provides: 'Regardless of whether the
motion [to recuse] complies with this rule, the respondent judge, within
three business days after the motion is filed, must either: (A) sign and file
with the clerk an order of recusal or disqualification; or (B) sign and file with
the clerk an order referring the motion to the regional presiding judge.'
Tex.R.Civ.P. 18a(f)(1). Under the rule's clear terms, when a party files a
motion to recuse, the judge must either grant the motion or refer it to the
regional presiding judge. See id. Once Gold filed the motion to recuse,
respondent could not take further action other than signing an order of
recusal or an order referring the motion to the regional presiding judge. See
Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a(f)(1); In re Marshall, 515 S.W.3d 420, 422 (Tex. App.-
Houston [14th Dist.] 2017, orig. proceeding). The failure to take one of these
two actions renders subsequent orders void. In re Marshall, 515 S.W.3d at
422; In re Norman, 191 S.W.3d 858, 861 (Tex. App.-Houston [14th Dist.]
2006, orig. proceeding) ('If a judge fails to comply with the rules governing
motions for recusal, all subsequent actions by the judge in that case are
void.'). Additionally, '[i]f a motion is filed before evidence has been offered at
trial, the respondent judge must take no further action in the case until the
motion has been decided, except for good cause stated in writing or on the
record.' Tex.R.Civ.P. 18a(f)(2)(A). '[T]he 'good cause' required by [r]ule 18a
must relate to the necessity for taking further action in a case in which a
recusal motion is pending, not to any 'good cause' that might support the
merits of the underlying motion.' In re Whatley, No. 14-05-01222-CV, 2006
WL 2257399, at *1 (Tex. App.-Houston [14th Dist.] Aug. 8, 2006, orig.
proceeding) (mem. op. on reh'g).
Summary
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a(f)(1) mandates that when a motion to
recuse is filed, the judge must either recuse themselves or refer the motion
to the regional presiding judge. If the judge fails to do so, any subsequent
actions they take are void. Additionally, if a motion is filed before evidence is
offered at trial, the judge must not take further action until the motion is
decided, unless there is good cause stated in writing or on the record. This
rule is generally applicable to cases in Texas involving motions to recuse.
In re Alpert, 276 S.W.3d 592 (Tex. App. 2008)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Rule 18a(f) expressly confers the authority to reassign a case following a
recusal to the regional presiding judge of the administrative judicial
district... Both the Texas Government Code and Texas Rules of Civil
Procedure vest the 'presiding judge of the administrative judicial district'
with the authority to assign a judge to hear a motion for recusal. TEX. GOV'T
CODE ANN. § 25.00255; TEX.R. CIV. P. 18a.

=== PAGE 17 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
The authority to reassign a case following a recusal is expressly conferred to
the regional presiding judge of the administrative judicial district. This
means that any reassignment or reinstatement of a judge must be done by
the presiding judge. If the presiding judge did not properly reinstate the
trial judge or relieve the visiting judge, and the trial judge set the case for
trial sua sponte, it could be considered a legal error because the proper
procedural authority was not followed.
In re Easton, 203 S.W.3d 438 (Tex. App. 2006)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The Rules of Civil Procedure provide that while a recusal motion is pending
'the judge shall make no further orders and shall take no further action in
the case.' TEX. R. CIV. P. 18a(d) (emphasis added).
Summary
According to Texas Rules of Civil Procedure 18a(d), a judge is prohibited
from making further orders or taking further action in a case while a recusal
motion is pending. This rule is designed to ensure impartiality and prevent
any potential bias or conflict of interest from affecting the proceedings. The
passage suggests that any action taken by a judge while a recusal motion is
pending could be considered a legal error.
Brosseau v. Ranzau, 28 S.W.3d 235 (Tex. App. 2000)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
This Court has previously held that a trial judge, when presented with a
recusal motion, regardless of the 'procedural sufficiency' of that motion, has
only the option to act in one of two specified ways: to recuse himself, or
refer the case to the presiding judge. ... By pursuing an option unavailable
through any rule or statute, the court abused its discretion as a matter of
law.
Summary
When a recusal motion is presented, the trial judge has only two options: to
recuse themselves or refer the case to the presiding judge. Any action
outside of these options, such as setting the case for trial without proper

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
reinstatement or relief of the visiting judge, would be considered an abuse
of discretion as a matter of law.
Villareal v. State , 348 S.W.3d 365 (Tex. App. 2011)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a, a judge presented with a timely
motion to recuse has two, and only two, options: (1) recuse himself or (2)
refer the motion to the presiding judge for his region. ... In civil cases, any
action taken by the trial court after a motion to recuse has been filed is void.
Summary
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a mandates that a judge must either recuse
themselves or refer the motion to the presiding judge when a motion to
recuse is filed. If a trial court takes any action after a motion to recuse has
been filed, such actions are considered void in civil cases. This suggests that
if the trial judge set the case for a final trial after a motion to recuse was
denied without proper reinstatement or relief of the visiting judge, it could
be considered a legal error.
Ex parte Thuesen, 546 S.W.3d 145 (Tex. Crim. App. 2017)
Texas Court of Criminal Appeals
Extract
The State argues that Texas law provides that, after a judge voluntarily
recuses himself, he can take no further action. Thus, in the absence of any
subsequent written order signed by Judge Underwood, Judge Bryan did not
have judicial authority to sign and execute the order reinstating himself on
applicant's case, and his subsequent rulings are void.
Summary
Once a judge recuses themselves, they cannot take further action in the case
unless there is a subsequent written order reinstating them. If a judge acts
without such an order, their actions are void. This principle is applicable to
the question at hand, as it involves the issue of whether a trial judge can set
a case for trial after a motion to recuse was denied without proper
reinstatement.
Mosley v. State, 141 S.W.3d 816 (Tex. App. 2004)

=== PAGE 19 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Rule 18a requires that, if a judge recuses himself or herself, the judge 'shall
make no further orders and shall take no further action in the case except
for good cause stated in the order in which such action is taken.' TEX.R. CIV.
P. 18a(c). Once a judge is recused or disqualified from a case, the prudent
approach is for the recused judge and the assigned judge to have no further
communications with each other concerning any aspect of that case. Any
such communication has, at the very least, the appearance of violating the
basic policy reasons for the recusal in the first place.
Summary
Once a judge is recused, they are not to take further action in the case
unless there is good cause stated. This suggests that if a trial judge, who
was not properly reinstated, took action such as setting a case for trial, it
could be considered a legal error. The passage emphasizes the importance
of maintaining the appearance of justice and avoiding any actions that could
undermine the reasons for recusal.
Mixon v. Moye, 860 S.W.2d 209 (Tex. App. 1993)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Because Judge Moye had recused himself before the order complained of
was rendered and no fact constituting good cause is stated in the order, it is
void and must be set aside.
Summary
The passage from Mixon v. Moye indicates that if a judge has recused
themselves from a case, any orders or actions they take without being
properly reinstated are considered void. This suggests that if a trial judge
sets a case for trial after a motion to recuse is denied, without being
officially reinstated, it could be considered a legal error.
Tex. Gov't. Code § 25.00255 Tex. Gov't. Code § 25.00255 Recusal Or
Disqualification of Judge

=== PAGE 20 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
A judge who hears a motion for recusal or disqualification may also hear any
amended or supplemented motion for recusal or disqualification filed in the
case.
Summary
A judge assigned to hear a motion for recusal or disqualification has the
authority to hear any amended or supplemented motions related to recusal
or disqualification. This suggests that the visiting judge, once assigned,
retains authority over the recusal matters unless officially relieved. If the
regional presiding judge did not officially relieve the visiting judge, the trial
judge setting the case for trial could be seen as a procedural error, as the
visiting judge's authority over recusal matters would still be in effect.
Tex. Gov't. Code § 74.059 Tex. Gov't. Code § 74.059 Powers and Duties
Extract
A judge assigned under the provisions of this chapter has all the powers of
the judge of the court to which he is assigned.
Summary
An assigned judge has all the powers of the judge of the court to which they
are assigned. This implies that until the visiting judge is officially relieved,
they retain the authority to act in the capacity of the trial judge. If the
regional presiding judge did not officially relieve the visiting judge, the trial
judge setting the case for a final trial sua sponte could be considered a legal
error, as the visiting judge still holds the authority.
Tex. Gov't. Code § 24.002 Tex. Gov't. Code § 24.002 Assignment of Judge Or
Transfer of Case On Recusal
Extract
If a district judge determines on the judge's own motion that the judge
should not sit in a case pending in the judge's court because the judge is
disqualified or otherwise should recuse himself or herself, the judge shall
enter a recusal order, request the presiding judge of that administrative
judicial region to assign another judge to sit, and take no further action in
the case except for good cause stated in the order in which the action is
taken.

=== PAGE 21 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
Procedure a district judge must follow if they determine they should recuse
themselves from a case. Specifically, the judge must enter a recusal order,
request the presiding judge to assign another judge, and take no further
action in the case except for good cause stated in the order. This implies that
if a judge is recused, they should not take further actions such as setting a
case for trial unless there is a stated good cause.
Tex. Civ. Prac. and Rem. Code § 30.016 Tex. Civ. Prac. and Rem. Code §
30.016 [Effective Until 9/1/2025] Recusal Or Disqualification of Certain
Judges
Extract
A judge who declines recusal after a tertiary recusal motion is filed shall
comply with applicable rules of procedure for recusal and disqualification
except that the judge shall continue to: preside over the case; sign orders in
the case; and move the case to final disposition as though a tertiary recusal
motion had not been filed.
Summary
When a tertiary recusal motion is filed and declined, the judge is required to
continue presiding over the case, signing orders, and moving the case to
final disposition as if the motion had not been filed. This implies that the
judge has the authority to set the case for final trial even if the motion to
recuse was denied, as long as it is a tertiary recusal motion.
Tex. Gov't. Code § 74.053 Tex. Gov't. Code § 74.053 Objection to Judge
Assigned to a Trial Court
Extract
When a judge is assigned to a trial court under this chapter: the order of
assignment must state whether the judge is an active, former, retired, or
senior judge; and the presiding judge shall, if it is reasonable and
practicable and if time permits, give notice of the assignment to each
attorney representing a party to the case that is to be heard in whole or part
by the assigned judge.
Summary
When a judge is assigned to a trial court, the order of assignment must
clearly state the status of the judge (active, former, retired, or senior).
Additionally, the presiding judge is responsible for notifying each attorney
representing a party in the case about the assignment. This ensures

=== PAGE 22 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
transparency and proper communication regarding the assignment of
judges. If the regional presiding judge did not properly reinstate the trial
judge or relieve the visiting judge, it could potentially be a procedural error,
especially if the parties were not properly notified of the changes in judicial
assignment.

Or Recusal of Judges
Extract
If the presiding judge who is the subject of the motion does not disqualify or
recuse him- or herself from the case, the Chief Judge or a designee of the
Chief Judge shall assign another judge to consider and rule on the motion.
Summary
If a motion to recuse or disqualify a judge is filed and the presiding judge
does not disqualify or recuse themselves, another judge must be assigned to
consider and rule on the motion. This indicates that there is a procedural
requirement for handling motions to recuse or disqualify judges, and if this
procedure is not followed, it could potentially be a legal error.

Extract
Before further proceedings in a case in which a motion for the recusal or
disqualification of a municipal judge has been filed, the judge shall: recuse
or disqualify himself or herself; or request the regional presiding judge to
assign a judge to hear the motion. ... A municipal judge who does not recuse
or disqualify himself or herself: shall forward, in original form or certified
copy, an order of referral, the motion, and all opposing and concurring
statements to the regional presiding judge; and may not take other action in
the case during the time after the filing of the motion for recusal or
disqualification and before a hearing on the motion, except for good cause
stated in the order in which the action is taken.
Summary
The procedure for recusal or disqualification of a municipal judge requires
the judge to either recuse themselves or request the regional presiding
judge to assign another judge to hear the motion. Importantly, the judge may
not take further action in the case after the filing of the motion and before a
hearing on the motion, unless there is good cause stated in an order. This
suggests that if a trial judge sets a case for final trial sua sponte after a

motion to recuse is denied, without proper reinstatement or relief of the
visiting judge, it could be a legal error if it violates the outlined procedure.

Summary
According to Tex. R. Civ. Pro. 18a, once a motion to recuse is filed, the judge
against whom the motion is directed must either recuse themselves or
request the presiding judge of the administrative judicial district to assign
another judge to hear the motion. If the judge does not recuse themselves,
they must forward the motion to the presiding judge and refrain from
making further orders or taking further action in the case until the motion is
heard. This implies that if the regional presiding judge did not properly
reinstate the trial judge and did not officially relieve the visiting judge, and
the trial judge set the case for final trial after the motion to recuse was
denied, it could be considered a legal error. The trial judge should not have
taken further action in the case without proper reinstatement and relief of
the visiting judge.

the presiding judge, and entered of record in the case. Ex parte Thuesen,
546 S.W. 3d at 156.
Summary
Once a judge has recused themselves, they do not have the authority to take
further action in the case. Additionally, any orders regarding the recusal or
reinstatement of a judge must be made in writing, signed by the presiding
judge, and entered into the record. This implies that if the regional presiding
judge did not properly reinstate the trial judge or relieve the visiting judge,
any actions taken by the trial judge, such as setting the case for trial, could
be considered a legal error.

Extract
Once a sufficient motion to recuse has been filed, before proceeding further
in the case, the judge must either recuse himself or request the presiding
judge of the administrative judicial district to assign a judge to hear the
motion under Tex. Gov’t Code §74.059(c)(3).
Summary
Once a motion to recuse is filed, the judge must either recuse themselves or
request the presiding judge to assign another judge to hear the motion. This
suggests that if a motion to recuse was denied, the presiding judge should
have taken steps to either reinstate the original judge or officially relieve the
visiting judge. If these steps were not taken, and the trial judge proceeded
to set the case for trial, it could be considered a procedural error.

Extract
A judge does not have authority to take any further action after signing a
voluntary recusal order. Ex parte Thuesen, 546 S.W.3d 145, 147 (Tex. Crim.
App. 2017).
Summary
Clear rule regarding the authority of a judge post-recusal.

Extract
If the motion is denied, it may be reviewed for abuse of discretion on appeal
from the final judgment. If the motion is granted, the order shall not be
reviewable, and the presiding judge shall assign another judge to sit in the
case.
Summary
If a motion to recuse is denied, it can be reviewed for abuse of discretion on
appeal from the final judgment. This implies that the denial of a recusal
motion does not automatically reinstate the original trial judge or relieve the
visiting judge. The presiding judge must take specific actions to assign
judges appropriately. If the regional presiding judge did not properly
reinstate the trial judge or relieve the visiting judge, and the trial judge set
the case for trial sua sponte, it could be considered a procedural error. The
passage suggests that the proper procedure involves the presiding judge
assigning another judge if the motion is granted, but it does not explicitly
address the scenario where the motion is denied and no further action is
taken by the presiding judge.
