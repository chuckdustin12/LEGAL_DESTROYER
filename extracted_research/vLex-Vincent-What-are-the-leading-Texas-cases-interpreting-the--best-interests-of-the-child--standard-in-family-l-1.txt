Question
What are the leading Texas cases interpreting the 'best interests of the child'
standard in family law, particularly in custody and conservatorship
decisions?
Answer (Texas)
Short response
The leading Texas cases interpreting the "best interests of the child"
standard in family law, especially in custody and conservatorship decisions,
are Holley v. Adams, Lenz v. Lenz, and Gillespie v. Gillespie, with the Holley
factors serving as the primary framework for judicial analysis. Texas courts
consistently apply these factors, as codified and developed through
subsequent case law, to ensure that the child's welfare remains the
paramount consideration in all conservatorship and custody matters.
Summary
Texas family law mandates that the best interests of the child are the
primary consideration in all custody and conservatorship decisions, as set
forth in the Texas Family Code and interpreted by a robust body of case law.
The Texas Supreme Court's decision in Holley v. Adams established a non-
exhaustive list of factors—commonly known as the Holley factors—that
guide courts in evaluating what arrangement best serves the child's welfare,
and these factors have been repeatedly reaffirmed and applied in
subsequent appellate and Supreme Court decisions.
Other landmark cases, such as Lenz v. Lenz and Gillespie v. Gillespie,
reinforce the centrality of the best interest standard and the broad
discretion afforded to trial courts in applying it. The law also recognizes a
strong presumption in favor of parental custody, which can be rebutted only
by clear and convincing evidence that such an arrangement would
significantly impair the child's physical health or emotional development.
While some earlier authorities have been subject to subsequent negative
treatment or statutory codification, the core principles articulated in these
leading cases remain authoritative and continue to shape Texas family law
practice.
Background and Relevant Law
Statutory Framework
The Texas Family Code is the primary legislative authority governing
custody (conservatorship) and possession (access) of children. Section
153.002 of the Family Code unequivocally states that the best interest of the

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
child must always be the court’s primary consideration in determining issues
of conservatorship and possession of and access to the child, see Tex. Fam.
Code § 153.002; In re J.A.J., 243 S.W.3d 611 (Tex. 2007). This statutory
mandate is echoed throughout the case law and forms the bedrock of all
judicial determinations in this area.
The Code also establishes a rebuttable presumption that appointing a parent
as managing conservator is in the child’s best interest, unless it is shown
that such an appointment would significantly impair the child’s physical
health or emotional development, see Tex. Fam. Code § 153.131; In the
Interest of V.L.K., 24 S.W.3d 338 (Tex. 2000). This presumption is deeply
embedded in Texas law and is reflected in both statutory and case law
authorities.
The Holley Factors
The Texas Supreme Court in Holley v. Adams, 544 S.W.2d 367 (Tex. 1976)
articulated a non-exhaustive list of factors for courts to consider when
determining the best interests of the child. These factors, now known as the 
Holley factors, include:
The desires of the child;
The emotional and physical needs of the child now and in the future;
The emotional and physical danger to the child now and in the future;
The parental abilities of the individuals seeking custody;
The programs available to assist these individuals to promote the best
interest of the child;
The plans for the child by these individuals;
The stability of the home or proposed placement;
The acts or omissions of the parent which may indicate that the existing
parent-child relationship is not a proper one;
Any excuse for the acts or omissions of the parent.
These factors are not exclusive, and courts may consider any other relevant
circumstances, see Holley v. Adams, 544 S.W.2d 367 (Tex. 1976); W.G. v. Tex.
Dep't of Family & Protective Servs., 2023 WL 436 S.W.3d 793 (Tex. App.
2023).
The Holley factors have been codified by statute and are routinely cited and
applied in both original and modification proceedings involving
conservatorship and possession, see Corrales v. Department of Family and
Prot., 155 S.W.3d 478 (Tex. App. 2004) (noting codification of Holley
factors).

Case Law
Supreme Court and Leading Appellate Decisions
Holley v. Adams
Holley v. Adams remains the foundational case for the best interest analysis
in Texas. The Supreme Court’s articulation of the Holley factors has been
adopted and applied in countless subsequent cases, both in the context of
termination of parental rights and in conservatorship and custody disputes,
see Holley v. Adams, 544 S.W.2d 367 (Tex. 1976). Although the Holley
decision originally arose in the context of termination, its factors have been
extended to all best interest determinations in family law, including
conservatorship and custody, see In re N.L.D., 412 S.W.3d 810 (Tex. App.
2013); Howe v. Howe, 551 S.W.3d 236 (Tex. App. 2018).
It is important to note that the Holley factors have been codified by statute,
as recognized in Corrales v. Department of Family and Prot., 155 S.W.3d 478
(Tex. App. 2004). This codification does not diminish their authority but
rather reinforces their central role in Texas family law.
Lenz v. Lenz
In Lenz v. Lenz, 79 S.W.3d 10 (Tex. 2002), the Texas Supreme Court
reaffirmed that the best interest of the child is the primary consideration in
all conservatorship and possession decisions. The Court emphasized that the
Family Code provides a public policy framework to ensure frequent and
continuing contact with parents who act in the child’s best interest. The
Court also recognized that the statutory scheme does not provide an
exhaustive list of factors, thus reinforcing the flexible, fact-driven nature of
the best interest inquiry.
Gillespie v. Gillespie
Gillespie v. Gillespie, 644 S.W.2d 449 (Tex. 1982) is another leading case,
frequently cited for the proposition that trial courts have broad discretion in
determining the best interests of the child. Appellate review of such
decisions is under an abuse-of-discretion standard, and a trial court’s
decision will only be reversed if it is arbitrary, unreasonable, or made
without reference to guiding rules and principles, see In re A.L.E., 279 S.W.
3d 424 (Tex. App. 2009); Elshafie v. Elshafie, NUMBER 13-10-00393-CV
(Tex. App. Nov 22, 2011).
Parental Presumption and Its Limits
Texas law strongly presumes that a child’s best interest is served by
appointing a parent as managing conservator, see In the Interest of V.L.K.,
24 S.W.3d 338 (Tex. 2000); Lewelling v. Lewelling, 796 S.W.2d 164 (Tex.
1990); Brook v. Brook, 881 S.W.2d 297 (Tex. 1994). This presumption is
rebuttable and may be overcome by clear and convincing evidence that

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
appointing the parent would significantly impair the child’s physical health
or emotional development, see Tex. Fam. Code § 153.131; Rodriguez, In
Interest of, 940 S.W.2d 265 (Tex. App. 1997).
However, some of these authorities have been subject to subsequent
negative treatment. For example, In the Interest of V.L.K., 24 S.W.3d 338
(Tex. 2000) was disapproved by In re C.J.C., 603 S.W.3d 804 (Tex. 2020), and 
Lewelling v. Lewelling, 796 S.W.2d 164 (Tex. 1990) was stated as
disapproved by In re T.J.S., 71 S.W.3d 452 (Tex. App. 2002). Despite this, the
core principle of the parental presumption and its rebuttal remains codified
in the Family Code and is still applied in practice, as seen in more recent
cases.
Application and Discretion
Texas courts have consistently held that the best interest determination is
intensely fact-driven and that trial courts have wide latitude in weighing the
evidence and applying the Holley factors, see Yeandle v. Yeandle, 2023 WL
2191330 (Tex. App. 2023); Kom v. Kom, 2025 WL 153.134(a) (Tex. App.
2025). The appellate courts will not substitute their judgment for that of the
trial court unless there is a clear abuse of discretion, see In re A.L.E., 279
S.W.3d 424 (Tex. App. 2009).
Modification Proceedings
In modification proceedings, the best interest of the child remains the
primary consideration, but the movant must also show a material and
substantial change in circumstances since the prior order, see Gonzalez v.
Sanchez, No. 07-16-00289-CV (Tex. App. Feb 23, 2018); In re Interest of
K.A.M.S., 583 S.W.3d 335 (Tex. App. 2019). The Holley factors continue to
guide the court’s analysis in these cases.
Domestic Violence and Other Statutory Considerations
The Family Code specifically requires courts to consider evidence of
domestic violence or abuse when making conservatorship decisions, and
may restrict or deny joint managing conservatorship if credible evidence of
abuse or neglect is presented, see In re Marriage of Stein, 153 S.W.3d 485
(Tex. App. 2004) (citing Tex. Fam. Code § 153.004).
Non-Parent Conservators
When a non-parent seeks managing conservatorship, the presumption in
favor of the parent applies, and the non-parent must prove that appointing
the parent would significantly impair the child’s health or development, see 
Whitworth v. Whitworth, 222 S.W.3d 616 (Tex. App. 2007); Brook v. Brook,
881 S.W.2d 297 (Tex. 1994). This principle is also reflected in the statutory
scheme and has been consistently applied in appellate decisions.

Subsequent and Negative Treatment
Some authorities have been subject to subsequent negative treatment or
have been superseded by statute or later case law:
Holley v. Adams, 544 S.W.2d 367 (Tex. 1976) has been codified by
statute, as noted in Corrales v. Department of Family and Prot., 155
S.W.3d 478 (Tex. App. 2004). This codification affirms, rather than
diminishes, the continuing relevance of the Holley factors.
In the Interest of V.L.K., 24 S.W.3d 338 (Tex. 2000) was disapproved by 
In re C.J.C., 603 S.W.3d 804 (Tex. 2020), but the core principle of the
parental presumption remains codified and is still applied.
Lewelling v. Lewelling, 796 S.W.2d 164 (Tex. 1990) was stated as
disapproved by In re T.J.S., 71 S.W.3d 452 (Tex. App. 2002), but the
statutory presumption in favor of parents continues to govern.
Bhan v. Danet, NO. 01-10-00963-CV (Tex. App. Nov 29, 2012) was
superseded by Danet v. Bhan, 436 S.W.3d 793 (Tex. 2014), so reliance
on the earlier case should be limited.
In re Lee, 411 S.W.3d 445 (Tex. 2013) was disagreed with by Cojocar v.
Cojocar, NO. 03-14-00422-CV (Tex. App. Jun 16, 2016), but its
discussion of the best interest standard remains instructive, especially
in the context of mediated settlement agreements.
Analysis
The "best interests of the child" standard in Texas is both statutorily
mandated and judicially developed. The statutory framework, particularly
Texas Family Code §§ 153.002 and 153.131, establishes the best interest of
the child as the paramount consideration and creates a rebuttable
presumption in favor of parental custody. The Holley factors, as articulated
in Holley v. Adams, 544 S.W.2d 367 (Tex. 1976), provide a flexible, non-
exhaustive framework for courts to evaluate the unique facts of each case.
Texas courts have consistently reaffirmed the centrality of the Holley factors
in both original and modification proceedings, see Zachery v. Zachery,
04-24-00531-CV (Tex. App. Aug 20, 2025); Kom v. Kom, 2025 WL 153.134(a)
(Tex. App. 2025); Yeandle v. Yeandle, 2023 WL 2191330 (Tex. App. 2023).
The trial court’s discretion is broad, and appellate review is deferential,
focusing on whether the trial court abused its discretion by acting
arbitrarily, unreasonably, or without reference to guiding principles, see 
Gillespie v. Gillespie, 644 S.W.2d 449 (Tex. 1982); In re A.L.E., 279 S.W.3d
424 (Tex. App. 2009).
The presumption in favor of parental custody is a significant feature of Texas
law, but it is not absolute. It may be rebutted by clear and convincing
evidence that appointing the parent would significantly impair the child’s
physical health or emotional development, see Tex. Fam. Code § 153.131; 
Brook v. Brook, 881 S.W.2d 297 (Tex. 1994). This presumption is rooted in
the belief that the natural parent-child relationship is generally in the child’s
best interest, but the law prioritizes the child’s welfare above all else, see

Mumma v. Aguirre, 364 S.W.2d 220 (Tex. 1963); Taylor v. Meek, 276 S.W.2d
787 (Tex. 1955).
In cases involving allegations of domestic violence or abuse, the court’s
discretion is limited by statutory provisions that require consideration of
such evidence and may preclude joint managing conservatorship if credible
evidence of abuse or neglect is presented, see In re Marriage of Stein, 153
S.W.3d 485 (Tex. App. 2004).
The best interest standard is also applied in modification proceedings,
where the movant must show both a material and substantial change in
circumstances and that the proposed modification is in the child’s best
interest, see Gonzalez v. Sanchez, No. 07-16-00289-CV (Tex. App. Feb 23,
2018); In re Interest of K.A.M.S., 583 S.W.3d 335 (Tex. App. 2019).
Exceptions and Caveats
While the Holley factors and the statutory framework provide clear
guidance, the intensely fact-driven nature of best interest determinations
means that outcomes can vary significantly depending on the specific
circumstances of each case, see Yeandle v. Yeandle, 2023 WL 2191330 (Tex.
App. 2023). The broad discretion afforded to trial courts means that
appellate courts are generally reluctant to overturn best interest
determinations absent a clear abuse of discretion.
Some earlier authorities, such as In the Interest of V.L.K., 24 S.W.3d 338
(Tex. 2000) and Lewelling v. Lewelling, 796 S.W.2d 164 (Tex. 1990), have
been subject to subsequent negative treatment. However, the core principles
they articulate—particularly the parental presumption and its rebuttal—
remain codified in the Family Code and are still applied in practice.
Conclusion
The leading Texas cases interpreting the "best interests of the child"
standard in family law, particularly in custody and conservatorship
decisions, are Holley v. Adams, Lenz v. Lenz, and Gillespie v. Gillespie, with
the Holley factors serving as the primary analytical framework. Texas courts
consistently apply these factors, along with the statutory presumption in
favor of parental custody and specific statutory considerations such as
domestic violence, to ensure that the child's welfare is the paramount
concern in all conservatorship and custody matters. While some earlier
authorities have been limited or superseded, the fundamental principles
established in these leading cases remain authoritative and continue to
guide Texas family law practice.

Extract
The family code does not define or set out the relevant factors to be
considered when determining whether a requested change is in the best
interest of a child. In other contexts involving a 'best interest' analysis,
Texas courts have applied what are commonly referred to as the Holley
factors--a nonexhaustive list of considerations for determining a minor's best
interest. Holley v. Adams, 544 S.W.2d 367, 371-72 (Tex. 1976) (enumerating
list of factors to ascertain best interest of child in parental termination
context); see also In re Doe 2, 19 S.W.3d 278, 282 (Tex. 2000) (applying
Holley factors for best interest determination in judicial bypass provision of
parental notification act); Turner, 47 S.W.3d at 767 (applying best interest
analysis to determine whether modification would be a positive improvement
for child).
Summary
The Texas Family Code does not explicitly define the factors for determining
the best interest of a child. However, Texas courts have consistently applied
the Holley factors, originating from the case Holley v. Adams, as a guiding
framework in various contexts, including custody and conservatorship
decisions. This indicates that Holley v. Adams is a leading case in
interpreting the 'best interests of the child' standard in Texas.
In re N.L.D., 412 S.W.3d 810 (Tex. App. 2013)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Even though termination and conservatorship are reviewed under different
standards, as detailed above, the same factors apply when determining the
best interests of the child. In determining the best interests of the child, a
number of factors have been considered, including (1) the desires of the
child, (2) the emotional and physical needs of the child now and in the
future, (3) the emotional and physical danger to the child now and in the
future, (4) the parental abilities of the individuals seeking custody, (5) the
programs available to assist these individuals, (6) the plans for the child by
these individuals, (7) the stability of the home, (8) the acts or omissions of
the parent that may indicate the existing parent-child relationship is not a
proper one, and (9) any excuse for the acts or omissions of the parent.
Summary
List of factors that are considered when determining the best interests of
the child in Texas family law. These factors are applicable to both

cases.
Elshafie v. Elshafie, NUMBER 13-10-00393-CV (Tex. App. Nov 22, 2011)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
"Because a trial court has broad discretion to decide the best interest of a
child in family law matters such as custody, visitation, and possession, we
review a decision to modify conservatorship for a clear abuse of that
discretion." In re A.L.E., 279 S.W.3d 424, 427 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th
Dist.] 2009, no pet.) (citing Gillespie v. Gillespie, 644 S.W.2d 449, 451 (Tex.
1982)). "A trial court abuses its discretion when it acts arbitrarily or
unreasonably, or when it clearly fails to correctly analyze or apply the law."
Id. (citing In re D.S., 76 S.W.3d 512, 516 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.]
2002, no pet.)).
Summary
The passage highlights the broad discretion given to trial courts in Texas to
determine the best interest of the child in family law matters, such as
custody and conservatorship. It references the case "In re A.L.E." and cites
"Gillespie v. Gillespie" as a precedent, indicating that these cases are
significant in interpreting the 'best interests of the child' standard. The
passage also explains that an abuse of discretion occurs when a court acts
arbitrarily or unreasonably or fails to apply the law correctly.
Perry v. Ponder, 604 S.W.2d 306 (Tex. Ct. App. 1980)
Texas Civil Court of Appeals
Extract
This child support and custody suit was dismissed by the trial court for lack
of personal jurisdiction over the father, a resident of Alabama. The court
found that the father did not have those 'minimum contacts' with the state of
Texas required by due process. Insofar as the petition seeks to impose a
personal obligation of support on the father, we affirm, but insofar as it
seeks appointment of the mother as managing conservator, we reverse on
the ground that since the child and the mother were residents of Texas at
the time the suit was filed, the court should not have limited the inquiry to
the father's contacts, but should have determined whether the child and the
mother had resided in Texas long enough to give this state an interest in the
child's welfare and access to evidence sufficient to enable it to make an
informed decision concerning the child's best interests.

=== PAGE 9 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
The passage from Perry v. Ponder discusses the jurisdictional considerations
in child custody cases, emphasizing that the court should consider the
child's and the mother's residency in Texas to determine the state's interest
in the child's welfare. This aligns with the 'best interests of the child'
standard by ensuring that the court has access to sufficient evidence to
make an informed decision. The case highlights the importance of
considering the child's connections to the state rather than solely focusing
on the nonresident parent's contacts.
Interest of Pena, 999 S.W.2d 521 (Tex. App. 1999)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
We turn now to Elsa's contention that there is legally and factually
insufficient evidence to support the trial court's implied finding that it is in
Christina's best interest to award her father the right of primary possession
pursuant a joint managing conservatorship. Section 153.372 of the Family
Code authorizes the appointment of a parent and nonparent as joint
managing conservators. Section 153.136 provides that if a joint managing
conservatorship is ordered, the best interest of the child ordinarily requires
the court to designate a primary physical residence for the child. Indeed,
Section 153.002 requires that the best interest of the child shall always be
the primary consideration in determining issues of conservatorship and
possession.
Summary
Application of the 'best interests of the child' standard in the context of joint
managing conservatorship, referencing specific sections of the Texas Family
Code that emphasize the importance of this standard in determining
conservatorship and possession. This indicates that the 'best interests of the
child' is a primary consideration in such legal decisions.
Patterson v. Brist, 236 S.W.3d 238 (Tex. App. 2006)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The courts have added other factors that should be considered in
determining whether modification of a prior conservatorship order is in the
child's best interest, particularly when the case involves a request to change
the designation of the managing conservator with the right to determine the
residency of the child or involves relocation. See Long, 144 S.W.3d at 68.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Thus, in determining the child's best interest in the specific context of
modification of conservatorship, the courts consider additional factors: (J)
the child's need for stability; and (K) the need to prevent constant litigation
in child custody cases.
Summary
The passage from Patterson v. Brist provides insight into the factors
considered by Texas courts when determining the best interests of the child
in the context of modifying conservatorship orders. It references the need
for stability and the prevention of constant litigation as important
considerations. This aligns with the broader legal framework in Texas,
where the best interests of the child are paramount in custody and
conservatorship decisions. The case also references other cases like Long
and Holley v. Adams, which are significant in this area of law.
Bhan v. Danet, NO. 01-10-00963-CV (Tex. App. Nov 29, 2012)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Texas case law supports the foregoing construction of sections 153.131 and
153.004. 'In determining the issues of conservatorship and possession of and
access to the child, '[t]he best interest of the child shall always be the
primary consideration of the court.' In re Rodriguez, 940 S.W.2d 265, 271
(Tex. App.— San Antonio 1997, writ denied) (quoting TEX. FAM. CODE ANN.
§ 153.002 (Vernon1996)). While Texas law presumes that a child's best
interest is served by naming the child's biological parent or parents as
managing conservators, this presumption is 'rebuttable.' Id. Such a
rebuttable presumption 'shift[s] the burden of producing evidence to the
party against whom it operates.'
Summary
The passage highlights the importance of the 'best interests of the child'
standard in Texas family law, particularly in conservatorship and custody
decisions. It references the Texas Family Code and a specific case, In re
Rodriguez, which supports the principle that the child's best interest is the
primary consideration. The passage also discusses the rebuttable
presumption favoring biological parents as managing conservators, which is
a significant aspect of Texas family law. This information is directly relevant
to understanding how Texas courts interpret the 'best interests of the child'
standard.

Texas Court of Appeals

=== PAGE 11 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
Our analysis, on the other hand, gives effect to the stated intent of the Texas
Legislature set forth in the Texas Family Code to promote stability for
children and to make the best interests of the children the trial court's
primary consideration in any custody dispute. See, e.g., id. §§ 153.001(a)(2)-.
002. Our analysis gives effect to the Texas Legislature's adoption of a
statutory scheme authorizing modification suits following the death of a
court-ordered managing conservator under circumstances like the present
case. Id. §§ 156.002(b), 102.003(a)(11).
Summary
The Texas Family Code emphasizes the best interests of the child as the
primary consideration in custody disputes. The case "In re P.D.M." interprets
this standard in the context of modification suits, highlighting the legislative
intent to promote stability for children and to allow for modifications when
circumstances change, such as the death of a managing conservator. This
interpretation is consistent with the statutory scheme set forth in the Texas
Family Code, particularly Chapters 153 and 156.
Whitworth v. Whitworth, 222 S.W.3d 616 (Tex. App. 2007)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The majority, however, moves directly from its determination that Carol had
standing to seek temporary and permanent sole managing conservatorship
of K.C. to its determination that she satisfied the burden of proof imposed
upon a non-parent who seeks managing conservatorship of a child by
overcoming the strong presumption in Texas law that the best interest of a
child is served if a natural parent is appointed as a managing conservator.
Summary
Legal standard and burden of proof required for a non-parent to be
appointed as a managing conservator, highlighting the presumption that a
child's best interest is served by appointing a natural parent. This is directly
relevant to understanding how Texas courts interpret the 'best interests of
the child' standard in custody and conservatorship decisions.
In re Lee, 411 S.W.3d 445, 56 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 1247 (Tex. 2013)
Texas Supreme Court

=== PAGE 12 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
The Legislature has made the policy of this state clear: 'The best interest of
the child shall always be the primary consideration of the court in
determining the issues of conservatorship and possession of and access to
the child.' Tex. Fam.Code § 153.002 (emphasis added). I would hold that
under Texas Family Code section 153.0071, and the Family Code as a whole,
a trial court has discretion to refuse to enter judgment on a modification
pursuant to an MSA that could endanger the child's safety and welfare and
is, therefore, not in the child's best interest. To suggest that the Legislature
intended otherwise is, I believe, absurd. I respectfully dissent.
Summary
The Texas Family Code emphasizes that the best interest of the child is the
primary consideration in custody and conservatorship decisions. The case of
In re Lee highlights the tension between the statutory requirements for
MSAs and the overarching policy of prioritizing the child's best interests.
The dissenting opinion in this case argues that trial courts should have
discretion to refuse MSAs that could endanger a child's welfare, reinforcing
the importance of the best interest standard.
In re Marriage of Stein, 153 S.W.3d 485 (Tex. App. 2004)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Well established Texas law affords the trial court with wide latitude in
determining the best interest of minor children, and the decision of the trial
court will be reversed only when it appears from the record as a whole that
the court has abused its discretion. Gillespie v. Gillespie, 644 S.W.2d 449,
451 (Tex.1982). That discretion, however, is now subject to the provisions of
section 153.004 of the Family Code, which applies when there is a history of
domestic violence within the family. (Vernon 2002). Specifically, the Family
Code provides, in pertinent part: (a) In determining whether to appoint a
party as a sole or joint managing conservator, the court shall consider
evidence of the intentional use of abusive physical force by a party against
the party's spouse ... committed within a two-year period preceding the
filing of the suit or during the pendency of the suit. (b) The court may not
appoint joint managing conservators if credible evidence is presented of a
history or pattern of past or present child neglect, or physical or sexual
abuse by one parent directed against the other parent, a spouse, or a
child.... Tex. Fam.Code Ann. § 153.004(a) & (b) (Vernon 2002).
Summary
Texas law provides trial courts with significant discretion in determining the
best interests of the child. However, this discretion is limited by specific

=== PAGE 13 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
provisions in the Texas Family Code, particularly section 153.004, which
addresses situations involving domestic violence. This section mandates that
courts consider evidence of domestic violence when making conservatorship
decisions and restricts the appointment of joint managing conservators if
there is credible evidence of abuse or neglect. This indicates that the 'best
interests of the child' standard is not only broad but also subject to specific
statutory limitations in cases involving domestic violence.
Holley v. Adams, 544 S.W.2d 367 (Tex. 1976)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
The trial court ordered termination under Section 15.02 of the Texas Family
Code Annotated on the grounds that Nanci Holley had failed to support her
child (Section 15.02(1)(E)), that her conduct endangered the emotional well-
being of the child (Section 15.02(1)(D)), and that the termination of the
parent-child relationship was in the best interest of the child (Section
15.02(2)). ... As this case involves the right of the child to the benefit of the
home and environment which will probably best promote its interest and the
right of the parent to surround the child with proper influences, Herrera v.
Herrera,409 S.W.2d 395 (Tex.1966), Legate v. Legate, 87 Tex. 248, 28 S.W.
281 (1894), and as Wiley v. Spratlan, 543 S.W.2d 349 (Tex.1976), recognized
the constitutional dimensions of these rights, this case must be strictly
scrutinized.
Summary
Application of the "best interests of the child" standard in the context of
terminating the parent-child relationship under Section 15.02 of the Texas
Family Code. It highlights the importance of considering the child's right to
a beneficial home environment and the parent's right to influence the child,
referencing other significant cases like Herrera v. Herrera and Wiley v.
Spratlan, which recognize the constitutional dimensions of these rights. This
indicates that the "best interests of the child" standard is a critical factor in
such decisions and must be strictly scrutinized.
In the Interest of V.L.K., 24 S.W.3d 338 (Tex. 2000)

The presumption that the best interest of the child is served by awarding
custody to the parent is deeply embedded in Texas law. See Lewelling v.
Lewelling, 796 S.W.2d 164, 166 (Tex. 1990) (citing Mumma v. Aguirre, 364

1894)). The parental presumption is based upon the natural affection usually
flowing between parent and child. See Taylor v. Meek, 276 S.W.2d 787, 790
(Tex. 1955). The Legislature codified the presumption in Chapter 153 of the
Family Code, which governs original custody determinations: ... Tex. Fam.
Code § 153.131(a). Thus, under Chapter 153, the nonparent can rebut the
parental presumption by showing that the appointment of the parent would
significantly impair the child's health or development. See Brook v. Brook,
881 S.W.2d 297, 298 (Tex. 1994). Chapter 153 also provides that the
parental presumption is rebutted if the natural parent has 'voluntarily
relinquished actual care, control, and possession of the child to a nonparent'
for one year or more and the appointment of a nonparent as managing
conservator is in the best interest of the child. Tex. Fam. Code § 153.373. A
court's primary consideration in any conservatorship case 'shall always be
the best interest of the child.' Tex. Fam. Code § 153.002.
Summary
The passage provides insight into the 'best interests of the child' standard by
highlighting the deeply embedded presumption in Texas law that favors
awarding custody to parents. It references several cases and codified
statutes that establish this presumption and the conditions under which it
can be rebutted. The passage also emphasizes that the primary
consideration in conservatorship cases is the child's best interest, as
codified in the Texas Family Code.

Extract
We begin our analysis by examining the relevant statutory provisions.
Sections 153.002, 153.005, and 153.131 of the Texas Family Code outline
the general standards for determining conservatorship. TEX. FAM.CODE §§
153.002, 153.005, 153.131. Section 153.002 provides that the primary
consideration in determining issues of conservatorship and possession of
and access to the child is always the child's best interest. Id. § 153.002.
Summary
The passage provides insight into the statutory framework that governs
conservatorship decisions in Texas, specifically highlighting that the child's
best interest is the primary consideration. This aligns with the 'best interests
of the child' standard in family law, making it relevant to the question. The
case "In re J.A.J." is a leading case that interprets these statutory provisions,
thus contributing to the understanding of how the 'best interests of the
child' standard is applied in custody and conservatorship decisions.

Because a trial court has broad discretion to decide the best interest of a
child in family law matters such as custody, visitation, and possession, we
review a decision to modify conservatorship for a clear abuse of that
discretion. See Gillespie v. Gillespie, 644 S.W.2d 449, 451 (Tex. 1982). A trial
court abuses its discretion when it acts arbitrarily or unreasonably, or when
it clearly fails to correctly analyze or apply the law. See In re D.S., 76 S.W.3d
512, 516 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2002, no pet.).
Summary
The passage highlights the broad discretion given to trial courts in Texas to
determine the best interests of the child in family law matters, such as
custody and conservatorship. It references the case Gillespie v. Gillespie as a
leading case that establishes this principle. The passage also notes that an

Lewelling v. Lewelling, 796 S.W.2d 164 (Tex. 1990)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
The presumption that the best interest of a child is served by awarding
custody to a natural parent is deeply embedded in Texas law. 1 The
Legislature, in enacting section 14.01(b), codified that presumption by
defining the procedure for appointment of a nonparent as managing
conservator. Prior to 1987, that statute provided in relevant part: § 14.01.
Court Appointment of Managing Conservator (b) A parent shall be appointed
managing conservator of the child unless the court finds that appointment of
the parent would not be in the best interest of the child. Tex.Fam.Code Ann.
§ 14.01(b) (Vernon 1986). Although the parental preference was clear, the
strength of that presumption was not. 2 In 1987, however, the legislature
made clear the paramount importance of the parental presumption by
amending the statute to provide: ... Our decision today is consistent with
recent legislative changes addressing the problem of family violence. As part
of the 1987 amendments to section 14.01, the Legislature added a provision
specifically targeting the problem of family violence. Section 14.01(c)(2),
which sets forth the factors to consider when the natural mother and father
are both seeking custody, states that evidence of abusive physical force by a
parent against his or her spouse or a child shall be considered by the court
in deciding custody. The provision creates a preference that the non-violent
parent, rather than the violent parent, be appointed managing conservator.
7 Thus, in a custody dispute between two parents, section 14.01(c)(2) allows
evidence of spousal abuse to be considered only as a factor that weighs
heavily against the abusive parent; such evidence does not weigh against
the abused.
Summary
Presumption in Texas law that the best interest of a child is served by
awarding custody to a natural parent. It highlights the legislative
amendments to section 14.01 of the Texas Family Code, which emphasize
the importance of this presumption and introduce considerations for family
violence in custody decisions. This case is significant in interpreting the
'best interests of the child' standard, especially in situations involving
nonparent conservatorship and family violence.

Texas Court of Appeals

=== PAGE 17 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
The distinction between an original conservatorship determination and a
modification proceeding is more than procedural or semantic. Under
Chapter 153 of the Texas Family Code, the trial court is required to apply a
'parental presumption' in an original proceeding: [U]nless the court finds
that appointment of the parent or parents would not be in the best interest
of the child because the appointment would significantly impair the child's
physical health or emotional development, a parent shall be appointed sole
managing conservator[] or both parents shall be appointed as joint
managing conservators of the child. ... Consistent with the constitutional
rights of fit parents, the Texas Legislature, for the most part, gives fit
parents priority over non-parents in matters relating to the parents'
children. For example, except as to parents with a history of domestic
violence, the Legislature, in the Texas Family Code, requires that the trial
court appoint a parent as managing conservator in an original
conservatorship suit, unless the court 'finds that appointment of the parent
or parents would not be in the best interest of the child because the
appointment would significantly impair the child's physical health or
emotional development.'
Summary
Application of the 'best interests of the child' standard in the context of
conservatorship decisions under the Texas Family Code. It highlights the
'parental presumption' that favors appointing parents as conservators unless
it is shown that such an appointment would significantly impair the child's
health or development. This presumption is a key aspect of the 'best
interests' standard in Texas family law, indicating the priority given to fit
parents over non-parents.

We review a trial court's best-interest determination in light of the
considerations set out in Holley v. Adams, taking into account the child's
wishes, their emotional and physical needs now and in the future, present
and future emotional or physical danger posed to the child, the parenting
skills of those seeking custody, any programs available to assist those
seeking custody to promote the child's best interest, plans for the child's
future, the stability of the home or proposed placement, conduct by the
parent that might show that the parent-child relationship is inappropriate,
and any excuses for the parent's conduct. 544 S.W.2d 367, 371-72 (Tex.
1976). The Holley factors are not exhaustive and need not all be proved, and
a lack of evidence about some of the factors does not 'preclude a factfinder
from reasonably forming a strong conviction or belief that termination is in
the child's best interest, particularly if the evidence were undisputed that
the parental relationship endangered the safety of the child.' In re C.H., 89
S.W.3d 17, 27 (Tex. 2002). The child's need for permanence is the paramount
consideration when determining a child's present and future physical and

The passage references the Holley v. Adams case, which is a leading case in
Texas for determining the 'best interests of the child' standard. It outlines
several factors that courts consider, such as the child's wishes, emotional
and physical needs, and the stability of the home. The passage also
references In re C.H., which emphasizes the importance of the child's need
for permanence. These cases are foundational in guiding courts on how to

Summary
The passage from Zachery v. Zachery references the Texas Family Code and
two significant cases, Lenz v. Lenz and Holley v. Adams, which are pivotal in
interpreting the 'best interests of the child' standard. The Holley factors are
a well-established set of criteria used by Texas courts to assess what
constitutes the best interests of the child. This makes the passage highly
relevant to understanding the legal framework and precedents guiding
custody and conservatorship decisions in Texas.

(Tex. App. Mar 01, 2019)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
When the trial court appoints joint managing conservators, it must designate
the conservator who has the exclusive right to determine the primary
residence of the child. Tex. Fam. Code § 153.134. In determining which joint
conservator should have the exclusive right, the best interest of the child is
the court's primary consideration, as it is in determining all 'issues of
conservatorship and possession of and access to the child.' Id. § 153.002.
Trial courts generally have wide latitude in determining what is in a child's
best interest, Gillespie v. Gillespie, 644 S.W.2d 449, 451 (Tex. 1982), and
may use a non-exhaustive list of factors to aid in the determination, Holley v.
Adams, 544 S.W.2d 367, 371-72 (Tex. 1976).
Summary
The passage provides insight into how Texas courts interpret the "best
interests of the child" standard in custody and conservatorship decisions. It
references specific Texas Family Code sections and leading cases such as
Gillespie v. Gillespie and Holley v. Adams, which are instrumental in guiding
courts on this issue. The passage highlights the court's discretion and the
factors considered in determining a child's best interest.

Summary
The passage from Long v. Long references Texas Family Code Sections
156.101 and 153.002, which emphasize that the best interest of the child is
the primary consideration in conservatorship and possession cases. It also
mentions the Holley factors, derived from Holley v. Adams, as a
nonexhaustive list used by courts to determine a child's best interest. This
indicates that the Holley case is a leading case in interpreting the best
interest standard. The passage also references In re Doe 2, which
acknowledges the use of Holley factors by intermediate courts.
Chacon v. Gribble, NO. 03-18-00737-CV (Tex. App. Nov 27, 2019)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The best interest of the child shall always be the primary consideration of
the court in determining the issues of conservatorship and possession of and
access to the child." Tex. Fam. Code § 153.002. Ordinarily, there is a
presumption that it is in the child's best interest for the court to appoint
both parents as joint managing conservators. See id. § 153.131(b). ... When
the trial court appoints joint managing conservators, it must designate the
conservator who has the right to determine the primary residence of the
child. Id. § 153.134. As with all "issues of conservatorship," the primary
consideration for the trial court in deciding who should have this exclusive
right is the best interest of the child. Id. § 153.002. Trial courts generally
have wide discretion in determining what is in the child's best interest, see
Gillespie v. Gillespie, 644 S.W.2d 449, 451 (Tex. 1982), and may use a non-
exhaustive list of factors to aid in the determination, Holley v. Adams, 544
S.W.2d 367, 371-72 (Tex. 1976). These factors include (1) the child's desires;
(2) the emotional and physical needs of the child now and in the future; (3)
the emotional and physical danger to the child now and in the future; (4) the
parental abilities of the individuals seeking custody of the child; (5) the
programs available to assist these individuals to promote the best interest of
the child; (6) plans for the child by the parties seeking custody; (7) the
stability of the proposed placement; (8) the parent's acts or omissions that

may indicate that the parent-child relationship is not proper; and (9) any
excuse for the acts or omissions of the parent. Id. Proof of best interest is
not limited to these factors, and no single factor is controlling.
Summary
The passage from the Chacon v. Gribble case provides insight into how Texas
courts interpret the "best interests of the child" standard in family law,
particularly in custody and conservatorship decisions. It references specific
sections of the Texas Family Code that emphasize the primary consideration
of the child's best interest in these matters. The passage also cites the case
of Gillespie v. Gillespie, which highlights the wide discretion courts have in
determining the child's best interest, and Holley v. Adams, which provides a
non-exhaustive list of factors that courts may consider. This indicates that
the "best interests of the child" standard is a flexible and comprehensive
guideline used by Texas courts.
In re Interest of C.F., 565 S.W.3d 832 (Tex. App. 2018)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Texas courts employ the 'parental presumption'—that is, they presume a
child’s best interest is served by remaining with the child’s natural parent.
Id. § 153.131(a) (West 2014); Lewelling v. Lewelling, 796 S.W.2d 164, 166
(Tex. 1990). That presumption is 'deeply embedded in Texas law' and 'based
upon the natural affection usually flowing between parent and child.' In re
V.L.K., 24 S.W.3d 338, 341 (Tex. 2000). The trial court is required to appoint
the parents as joint managing conservators unless it finds (1) appointment of
one or both parents as managing conservator would significantly impair the
child’s health or development; or (2) there is a history of family violence
involving the child’s parents. Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 153.131(a), (b). The
party seeking appointment of a non-parent as managing conservator bears
the burden to rebut the parental presumption. In re K.S., 492 S.W.3d 419,
427 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2016, pet. denied). The best interest of
the child shall always be the primary consideration of the court in
determining conservatorship, possession, and access. See id. § 153.002.
Summary
The passage provides insight into the 'best interests of the child' standard by
discussing the 'parental presumption' in Texas law, which favors the natural
parent unless specific conditions are met. It references several cases and
statutes that are central to understanding how Texas courts interpret this
standard. The passage also outlines the conditions under which a non-parent
may be appointed as a managing conservator, emphasizing the importance
of the child's best interest as the primary consideration.

Taylor v. Meek, 154 Tex. 305, 276 S.W.2d 787 (Tex. 1955)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
The natural parent need only show 'any change of circumstances
demonstrative of the parent's improved condition or fitness as a custodian,
any change of circumstances demonstrative of the fact that the other person
is less well fitted or situated as custodian, or any change of circumstances
relating to the existing custody which is injurious to the best interest of the
child.' The establishment of any one of these changes of condition 'reopens'
the case and it is then tried as though there had been no other decree.
Thereupon the burden shifts to the party contesting the natural parent to
'demonstrate that the best interests of the child require that the parent be
deprived of the custody' which in turn requires a finding that the natural
parent is unfit to have custody; and, therefore, ... Because a change of
custody disrupts the child's living arrangements and the channels of a
child's affection, a change should be ordered only when the trial court is
convinced that the change is to be a positive improvement for the child.

S.W.2d 564, error refused; Miller v. Banks, supra; Cecacci v. Martilli, supra.
The paramount right of a natural parent to a child comes from a legal
presumption that to be raised by its natural parents is to the child's best
interest. This presumption is based upon the natural affection usually
flowing from parentage. Clayton v. Kerbey, Tex.Civ.App., 1921, 226 S.W.

Summary
The passage from "Taylor v. Meek" provides insight into how the 'best
interests of the child' standard is interpreted in Texas family law. It outlines
the conditions under which a natural parent can seek a change in custody,
emphasizing the need for a change in circumstances that affects the child's
best interests. It also highlights the legal presumption that being raised by
natural parents is generally in the child's best interest, unless proven
otherwise. This case is significant in understanding the burden of proof and
the considerations involved in custody decisions.

Wood v. Deaton, 93 Tex. 243, 54 S.W. 901. However, wholly aside from the
binding force of the rule of res judicata, the law favors a high degree of
stability in a young child's home and surroundings, and to achieve that
stability will not permit a change of custody, once judicially determined,
except upon a showing of materially changed conditions, Short v. Short,
Tex.Sup., 354 S.W.2d 933; and will not require it, even then, unless denying
it would constitute an abuse of discretion by the trial judge.
Summary
The passage from Mumma v. Aguirre highlights the presumption that the
natural relationship between parent and child is generally in the child's best
interest, emphasizing stability in the child's environment. It also references
the need for materially changed conditions to alter custody, unless not doing
so would be an abuse of discretion. This case, along with State ex rel. Wood
v. Deaton and Short v. Short, provides insight into how Texas courts
interpret the 'best interests of the child' standard, focusing on stability and
the natural parent-child relationship.
Brook v. Brook, 881 S.W.2d 297 (Tex. 1994)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
In this child custody dispute we are concerned with the type of finding
required for appointment of a parent and a nonparent to be joint managing
conservators under section 14.01(b)(1) of the Texas Family Code. ... The trial
court rendered an order pursuant to the jury's decision in favor of the latter
joint managing conservatorship and determination that such appointment
was in the best interest of the child. ... TEX.FAM.CODE ANN. § 14.01(b)(1)
(Vernon Supp.1994). This provision codifies the longstanding presumption
that 'the best interest of a child is served by awarding custody to a natural
parent.' Lewelling v. Lewelling, 796 S.W.2d 164, 166 (Tex.1990). ... The party
seeking to bar the natural parent from appointment as managing
conservator[ ].... must prove that the appointment of the parent ... would
significantly impair the child's health or emotional development.
Summary
Application of the 'best interests of the child' standard in the context of
appointing joint managing conservators, including a nonparent. It highlights
the presumption in favor of natural parents and the requirement for
evidence of significant impairment to the child's health or emotional
development to bar a natural parent from being appointed as a conservator.
This aligns with the broader legal principle that custody decisions should
prioritize the child's best interests, a central tenet in Texas family law.

In re M.S., 115 S.W.3d 534, 2003 WL 21512654 (Tex. 2003)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
The child bears a substantial interest in the proceedings as well. Indeed, the
Family Code's entire statutory scheme for protecting children's welfare
focuses on the child's best interest. Those interests, some of which the child
shares with the parent, and some of which the child shares with the State,
must necessarily be considered in this analysis.
Summary
The passage from "In re M.S." highlights the importance of the child's best
interests in proceedings related to parental rights. It emphasizes that the
statutory scheme in Texas family law is centered around the child's welfare,
which is a critical component in custody and conservatorship decisions. This
aligns with the broader legal principle that the child's best interests are
paramount in family law cases. The case provides insight into how Texas
courts interpret and apply this standard, making it relevant to the question.

Wiley v. Spratlan, 543 S.W.2d 349 (Tex. 1976)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
Suits for conservatorship, possession, and support are governed by Chapter
14 of the Family Code and those matters are determined by the 'best
interest' test. Section 14.07. Those proceedings are different and have
different purposes from termination cases. Decrees under Chapter 14 may
be modified or changed from time to time, but the parent still retains some
rights in and control over a child. A termination decree, on the other hand,
is complete, final, irrevocable. It divests for all time the parent and child of
all legal rights, privileges, duties, and powers with respect to each other
except for the child's right to inherit. See Section 15.07. The difference in
the proceedings justifies the caution with which courts have
characteristically considered termination cases. Actions which break the ties
between a parent and child 'can never be justified without the most solid
and substantial reasons.' State v. Deaton, 93 Tex. 243, 54 S.W. 901 (1900).
Particularly in an action which permanently sunders those ties, should the
proceedings be strictly scrutinized. This court has always recognized the
strong presumption that the best interest of a minor is usually served by
keeping custody in the natural parents. Herrera v. Herrera, 409 S.W.2d 395
(Tex.1966); Gunn v. Cavanaugh, 391 S.W.2d 723 (Tex.1965); Mumma v.
Aguirre, 364 S.W.2d 220 (Tex.1963).
Summary
The passage from "Wiley v. Spratlan" provides insight into how the 'best
interests of the child' standard is applied in Texas family law, particularly in
cases of conservatorship, possession, and support. It distinguishes between
these proceedings and termination cases, emphasizing the importance of
maintaining parental rights unless there are substantial reasons for
termination. The passage also references other Texas cases that support the
presumption that a child's best interests are usually served by remaining
with their natural parents.

Summary
The passage from "In re C.H." discusses the application of the 'best interests
of the child' standard in the context of parental termination cases. The jury's
finding that termination was in the best interest of the child was a key factor
in the trial court's decision to terminate parental rights. This case illustrates
how the 'best interests of the child' standard is applied in termination
proceedings, which is relevant to custody and conservatorship decisions as
well.
Lenz v. Lenz, 79 S.W.3d 10, 45 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 781 (Tex. 2002)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
The Legislature has made clear that '[t]he best interest of the child shall
always be the primary consideration of the court in determining the issues
of conservatorship and possession of and access to the child.' TEX.
FAM.CODE § 153.002. Yet, the Family Code does not elaborate on the
specific requirements for modification in the residency-restriction context,
and we have no specific statute governing residency restrictions or their
removal for purposes of relocation. Neither have Texas courts articulated
any specific standards to apply in this context. Nonetheless, the Legislature
has provided a basic framework upon which we may build guidelines for
reviewing a modification that removes a residency restriction for purposes
of relocation. Family Code § 153.001 outlines this framework by
pronouncing our public policy for all suits affecting the parent-child
relationship: (a) The public policy of this state is to: (1) assure that children
will have frequent and continuing contact with parents who have shown the
ability to act in the best interest of the child; ... As most of these cases rely
on a best-interest standard as the ultimate guide for determining whether a
modification for purposes of relocation should be granted, the factors they
consider reflect the public policy concerns implicit in Texas' own statutory
best-interest standard for modification. See TEX. FAM.CODE § 156.202(2)
(modification must be 'a positive improvement for and in the best interest of
the child').
Summary
The passage from Lenz v. Lenz discusses the application of the "best
interests of the child" standard in the context of conservatorship and
custody decisions. It highlights that the Texas Family Code § 153.002
mandates that the best interest of the child is the primary consideration in
such decisions. The passage also notes the lack of specific statutory
guidance on residency restrictions and relocation, but it emphasizes the
public policy framework provided by the Family Code to ensure frequent and
continuing contact with parents acting in the child's best interest. This case
is significant in interpreting how the best interest standard is applied,
especially in modifications related to relocation.

In determining issues of conservatorship and possession and access, the
primary consideration is always the best interest of the children. See Tex.
Fam. Code Ann. § 153.002 (West 2014) ; Lenz v. Lenz, 79 S.W.3d 10, 14 (Tex.
2002). We review a trial court's decision to modify an order regarding
conservatorship or the terms of possession of and access to each child under
an abuse-of-discretion standard. See Baltzer v. Medina, 240 S.W.3d 469,
474–75 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2007, no pet.). A trial court abuses
its discretion if it acts arbitrarily, unreasonably, or without reference to any
guiding rules or principles.
Summary
The passage highlights the primary consideration in conservatorship and
possession cases, which is the best interest of the children, as outlined in
Texas Family Code § 153.002. It also references the case Lenz v. Lenz as a
leading case interpreting this standard. The passage further explains the
standard of review for such decisions, which is an abuse-of-discretion
standard, citing Baltzer v. Medina as a relevant case. This information is
crucial for understanding how Texas courts interpret and apply the 'best
interests of the child' standard in family law.
In re Interest of K.A.M.S., 583 S.W.3d 335 (Tex. App. 2019)

The trial court concluded there had been a material and substantial change
in circumstances since the 2006 paternity order and that modifying the
order was in the best interest of the children. See Tex. Fam. Code Ann. §§
153.002, 156.101(a)(1). The trial court named Mother sole managing
conservator and Father possessory conservator. See Tex. Fam. Code Ann. §§
153.005 (Supp.), 153.006. The trial court concluded that a standard
possession order was inappropriate or unworkable under the circumstances,
a modified possession order was not more restrictive than necessary to
protect the best interest of the children, and Father shall have possession at
times mutually agreed to in advance by the parties. See Tex. Fam. Code Ann.

Tex. Fam. Code § 153.004 Tex. Fam. Code § 153.004 History of Domestic
Violence Or Sexual Abuse
Extract
In determining whether to appoint a party as a sole or joint managing
conservator, the court shall consider evidence of the intentional use of
abusive physical force, or evidence of sexual abuse, by a party directed
against the party's spouse, a parent of the child, or any person younger than
18 years of age committed within a two-year period preceding the filing of
the suit or during the pendency of the suit. ... It is a rebuttable presumption
that the appointment of a parent as the sole managing conservator of a child
or as the conservator who has the exclusive right to determine the primary
residence of a child is not in the best interest of the child if credible
evidence is presented of a history or pattern of past or present child neglect,
or physical or sexual abuse by that parent directed against the other parent,
a spouse, or a child.
Summary
The Texas Family Code § 153.004 provides specific guidance on how courts
should consider evidence of domestic violence or sexual abuse when
determining the best interests of the child in custody and conservatorship
decisions. The statute establishes a rebuttable presumption against
appointing a parent as a sole managing conservator if there is credible
evidence of abuse or neglect, indicating that such an appointment is not in
the child's best interest. This legal standard is crucial in guiding courts'
decisions in relevant cases.

(b) by proving by clear and convincing evidence that denial of the relief
requested by the nonparent would significantly impair the child's physical
health or emotional development. If the court renders an order in the suit
granting relief to the nonparent, the court shall state in the order: the
specific facts that support the court's finding that denying the relief
requested by the nonparent would significantly impair the child's physical
health or emotional development; and the extent to which the nonparent has
overcome the presumption under Subsection (b).
Summary
Statutory framework for determining the best interests of the child in
custody and conservatorship decisions. It establishes that the best interest
of the child is the primary consideration and introduces a rebuttable
presumption favoring parents in suits between parents and nonparents. This
presumption can be overcome by clear and convincing evidence that the
child's physical health or emotional development would be significantly
impaired.

Conservatorship
Extract
If a written agreed parenting plan is not filed with the court, the court may
render an order appointing the parents joint managing conservators only if
the appointment is in the best interest of the child, considering the following
factors: whether the physical, psychological, or emotional needs and
development of the child will benefit from the appointment of joint managing
conservators; the ability of the parents to give first priority to the welfare of
the child and reach shared decisions in the child's best interest; whether
each parent can encourage and accept a positive relationship between the
child and the other parent; whether both parents participated in child
rearing before the filing of the suit; the geographical proximity of the
parents' residences; if the child is 12 years of age or older, the child's
preference, if any, regarding the person to have the exclusive right to
designate the primary residence of the child; and any other relevant factor.
Summary
The Texas Family Code § 153.134 provides specific factors that the court
must consider when determining the best interest of the child in appointing

decisions.
Tex. Fam. Code § 153.131 Tex. Fam. Code § 153.131 Presumption that Parent
to Be Appointed Managing Conservator
Extract
(a) Subject to the prohibition in Section FAMILY CODE 153.004, unless the
court finds that appointment of the parent or parents would not be in the
best interest of the child because the appointment would significantly impair
the child's physical health or emotional development, a parent shall be
appointed sole managing conservator or both parents shall be appointed as
joint managing conservators of the child. (b) It is a rebuttable presumption
that the appointment of the parents of a child as joint managing
conservators is in the best interest of the child. A finding of a history of
family violence involving the parents of a child removes the presumption
under this subsection.
Summary
Texas law presumes that appointing parents as joint managing conservators
is in the best interest of the child. However, this presumption can be
rebutted if there is evidence that such an appointment would significantly
impair the child's physical health or emotional development, or if there is a
history of family violence. This statutory provision is crucial in guiding
courts in custody and conservatorship decisions, as it establishes a baseline
presumption that can be challenged under specific circumstances.
Tex. Fam. Code § 263.307 Tex. Fam. Code § 263.307 Factors In Determining
Best Interest of Child
Extract
In considering the factors established by this section, the prompt and
permanent placement of the child in a safe environment is presumed to be in
the child's best interest. The following factors should be considered by the
court and the department in determining whether the child's parents are
willing and able to provide the child with a safe environment: the child's age
and physical and mental vulnerabilities; the frequency and nature of out-of-
home placements; the magnitude, frequency, and circumstances of the harm
to the child; whether the child has been the victim of repeated harm after
the initial report and intervention by the department; whether the child is
fearful of living in or returning to the child's home; the results of psychiatric,
psychological, or developmental evaluations of the child, the child's parents,
other family members, or others who have access to the child's home;

whether there is a history of abusive or assaultive conduct by the child's
family or others who have access to the child's home; whether there is a
history of substance abuse by the child's family or others who have access to
the child's home; whether the perpetrator of the harm to the child is
identified; the willingness and ability of the child's family to seek out,
accept, and complete counseling services and to cooperate with and
facilitate an appropriate agency's close supervision; the willingness and
ability of the child's family to effect positive environmental and personal
changes within a reasonable period of time; whether the child's family
demonstrates adequate parenting skills, including providing the child and
other children under the family's care with: (A) minimally adequate health
and nutritional care; (B) care, nurturance, and appropriate discipline
consistent with the child's physical and psychological development; (C)
guidance and supervision consistent with the child's safety; (D) a safe
physical home environment; (E) protection from repeated exposure to
violence even though the violence may not be directed at the child; and (F)
an understanding of the child's needs and capabilities; and whether an
adequate social support system consisting of an extended family and friends
is available to the child.
Summary
Detailed list of factors that courts and the Department of Family and
Protective Services should consider when determining the best interests of
the child. These factors are crucial in custody and conservatorship
decisions, as they guide the court in assessing the child's safety, the parents'
ability to provide a safe environment, and the overall well-being of the child.

Texas. In re A.C., Nos. 2018-308 & 2018-309, 2018 WL 5304691 (Tex. Oct.
26, 2018). Under the elevated proof standard, a parent’s unrecounted and
uncontroverted admission that termination is in her children’s best
interests, coupled with stipulations as to grounds for termination and
permanency plans, is evidence to support the trial court’s best interest
findings. Such evidence, in the form of statements in a mediated settlement
agreement signed by the parents, counsel, and others, is suficient
Summary
Case "In re A.C." from Texas, which provides insight into how the 'best
interests of the child' standard is applied in the context of terminating
parental rights. The case highlights that a parent's admission, along with
stipulations regarding termination grounds and permanency plans, can be

Extract
A best-interest determination in any proceeding involving a nonparent’s
request for conservatorship or possession, over the objection of a child’s fit
parent, must accord that parent the presumption that he is acting in the
child’s best interest so long as that presumption has not previously been
overcome. In Re C.J.C, No. 19-0694 (Tex. 2020).
Summary
The passage provides insight into the 'best interests of the child' standard by
referencing the case "In Re C.J.C, No. 19-0694 (Tex. 2020)." This case
highlights the presumption that a fit parent is acting in the child's best
interest, which must be considered in any proceeding involving a
nonparent's request for conservatorship or possession. This presumption is a
critical aspect of the 'best interests of the child' standard in Texas family
law.
Child Custody Basics In Texas
Extract
Joint managing conservatorship is presumed to be in a child's best interest.
In other words, it is the default. If there is evidence that joint managing
conservatorship is not in the child's best interest, a court can decide that
one parent should be sole managing conservator. For example, family
violence, alcohol or drug abuse, and similar issues weigh against joint
managing conservatorship. Other factors a court considers include the
child's physical, psychological, or emotional needs; the ability of the parents
to give first priority to the welfare of the child; whether parents encourage
and accept a positive relationship between the child and the other parent;
whether both parents participated in raising the child prior to the suit;
geographical proximity; and (if the child is 12 years of age or older) the
child's preference.
Summary
N overview of the factors considered by Texas courts when determining the
best interests of the child in custody and conservatorship cases. It highlights

=== PAGE 39 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
that joint managing conservatorship is the default presumption, but courts
will consider various factors, such as family violence, substance abuse, and
the child's needs and preferences, to determine if sole managing
conservatorship is more appropriate. This aligns with the 'best interests of
the child' standard used in Texas family law.
