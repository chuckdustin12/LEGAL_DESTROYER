Question
II. JUDGE KAITCER, ATTORNEY COOPER L. CARTER, AND PETITONER
MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS – EXTORTION AND CONSPIRACY TO
COMMTI T EXTORTION 5. On February 1, 2024, the parties signed an
agreement that had the following provisions, and was signed by Associate
Judge Jeffrey Kaitcer: “A typed written Order conforming to this Report will
follow within 20 days from the date this Report is signed. The Temporary
Order shall be prepared by DAN BACALIS. Each attorney should approve
the Order. The parties do not need to approve the Order. The attorney
reviewing the proposed Order shall have five (5) days to do so. There are no
ten (10) day letters. If an agreement is not reached, a Motion to Sign shall
be filed and set within thirty (30) days from the signing of this Report.” (DKT
NO. 26) 6. This order was filed with the Clerk on February 8, 2024, and
became officially binding. However, three days earlier, on February 5, 2024,
the Court was notified that Dan Bacalis had been terminated. (DKT NO. 22)
Therefore, the provisions above, as ordered by Associate Judge Jeffrey
Kaitcer, could not have possibly been met due to Bacalis being ordered to,
and the parties all agreeing that, he would reduce the agreed associate
judge’s report to writing. 7. The Texas Family Code and Government Code
set out the procedures and consequences for requesting a de novo hearing
following an associate judge’s report or temporary order. In family law and
juvenile matters, a party must file a written request for a de novo hearing
with the clerk of the referring court no later than the third working day after
receiving notice of the associate judge’s report or temporary order, as
provided in Texas Family Code sections 201.015 and 201.317, respectively
(Tex. Fam. Code § 201.015; Tex. Fam. Code § 201.317). For other civil
matters, the deadline is seven working days (Tex. Gov't. Code § 54A.115). 8.
Crucially, the filing of a timely request for a de novo hearing divests the
associate judge of jurisdiction over the matters specified in the request,
transferring authority to the referring court (Tex. Fam. Code § 201.015; Tex.
Fam. Code § 201.1041; Tex. Fam. Code § 201.2041). The Family Code further
provides that only the referring court may hear and render orders on
motions for post judgment relief, including motions for new trial or to
vacate, correct, or reform a judgment (Tex. Fam. Code § 201.104). 9. One
day later, on February 9, 2024, Respondent filed an EMERGENCY MOTION
TO VACATE AND RECONSIDER EVIDENCE and provided several exhibits
and served them on the opposing side which showed clear misconduct by
the Petitioner, Morgan Michelle Myers. (DKT NOS. 52-62) No response was
ever received by the opposition regarding this motion. 8. On February 22,
2024, after receiving no response from the opposition, Respondent filed a
MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT asserting that there was no genuine
dispute of material facts raised in the motion with included exhibits. (DKT
NOS. 67-73) 9. On February 27, 2024, Judge Munford issued a notice of
hearing, scheduling the Motion to be heard on March 14, 2024. (DKT NOS.
74,77) 10. On March 3, 2024, Respondent provided notice to the court that
he would not be leaving the marital home on March 1, 2024, given that the
associate judge’s report signed on February 1 had become moot due to
Bacalis’ termination. 11. On March 6, 2024, Petitioner illegally locked
Respondent out of the home by using self-help remedies designed to

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
displace the Respondent from his home and business. 12. On March 14,
2024, the parties appeared, where just minutes before the hearing on
Respondent’s emergency motion was scheduled to begin, attorney Cooper L.
Carter hand-served the reduced version of temporary orders that were
agreed to be prepared by Daniel Bacalis. (DKT NO. 92) 13. This document,
prepared by Cooper L. Carter, was identified as February 1, 2024, agreed
associate judge’s report, which states the following misrepresentations: i.
On February 1, the Court heard Petitioner’s Motion for Temporary Orders. ii.
The parties agree to the terms of this order as evidenced by the signatures
below. iii. The dates of possession of the marital home were altered, giving
Respondent access ONLY until March 20, and the Petitioner access ONLY
until after March 30, leaving a 10-day gap where no one would occupy the
home. iv. On the last page, it reads “AGREED AND CONSENTED TO AS TO
FORM AND SUBSTANCE.” 14. Respondent’s emergency motion was denied
without any justification, and in the Associate Judge’s Report signed on
03/14/2024 signed by Judge Kaitcer, Cooper L. Carter, and Petitioner
Morgan Michelle Myers, which was prepared by Cooper L. Carter, it stated
the following: i. It is ordered that Movant’s motion to vacate is denied. ii. It
is ordered that Movant shall provide Mrs. Myers’ attorney with a list of the
technology he needs from the marital home, for his business. iii. It is
ordered that the parties shall present a signed Temporary Orders by
regarding the AJR on 2/1/2024 by 1:30 pm today. (DKT. NO 97) 15. Judge
Kaitcer, Cooper Carter, and Morgan Michelle Myers knowingly signed a
document and compelled the Respondent to sign the same document which
contained knowingly false statements that resulted in a direct injury to the
Respondent’s business and property that affects interstate commerce
through his clients who are located throughout the United States and
Canada. 16. Despite refusing to sign the document, the court rendered it
into effect anyway on March 26, 2024, despite the document claiming it was
consented to by all parties, despite it being prepared by the wrong attorney,
and despite it referencing a hearing which cannot be found on the docket,
and despite the terms being unilaterally changed. (DKT NO. 96) In fact, the
docket reflects only one appearance made by Morgan Michelle Myers in this
matter which occurred on January 16, 2024. (DKT NO. 45). 17. Crucially,
when a party files a timely request for a de novo hearing, the associate
judge is immediately divested of jurisdiction over the specified matters, and
the referring court assumes exclusive authority (In re Laurie, 691 S.W.3d
769 (Tex. App. 2024); In re Harris (Tex. App. Feb. 29, 2024); In re R.P. (Tex.
App. Aug. 30, 2023); In re T.A., 02-24-00509-CV (Tex. App. Jul 17, 2025)). 18.
Therefore, judicial immunity is not at issue, and the predicate acts
committed by these individuals, as explained in more detail below, form the
basis for the RICO complaint. III. JUDGE JAMES MUNFORD AND COURT
COORDINATOR LINDSEY BAKER 19. On October 7, 2024, Respondent filed
a joint motion to recuse District Judge James Munford and Associate Judge
Jeffrey Kaitcer through the electronic filing manager, serving all parties with
one hyperlinked document containing all exhibits and notarized affidavits
(DKT NO. 227). This recusal was filed in good faith after all appellate efforts
were denied without explanation. See Cause No. 24-0395. 20. On October 8,
2024, Judge Munford sent an order of referral and ruling letter to Regional
Presiding Judge David L. Evans, declining to recuse himself (DKT NOS.
228-229). 21. On October 8, 2024, Court Coordinator Lindsey Baker emailed
a receipt showing the original motion had been modified to exclude exhibits

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
and affidavits (DKT NOS. 230-231). 22. When Respondent pointed this out,
Baker confirmed the pleading had been e-filed and the full document was in
the court's possession (DKT NOS. 230-231). 23. Respondent asked for
clarification about the missing exhibits and affidavits, noting a significant
file size discrepancy between the submitted motion and the one forwarded
to the Regional Presiding Judge (DKT NOS. 230-231). 24. No further
correspondence was received from Baker that day, and the following day an
amended order of referral and ruling letter was emailed to Respondent, with
his motion split into three separate files, allegedly due to the "size of the
pleading" (DKT NOS. 232-233). The pleading's hyperlinks were removed. 25.
The Texas Supreme Court’s decision in In re Rio Grande Valley Gas Co. is
particularly instructive. The Court interpreted Rule 18a to require that, after
a recusal motion is filed, the judge must forward the motion and all related
materials in their original form or as certified copies, and must refrain from
taking any further action in the case except for good cause stated in the
order. The removal of exhibits and affidavits is a substantive alteration that
violates this requirement. IV. ANALYSIS – PREDICATE ACTS A. Compelling
Execution of a Fraudulent Order (HOBBS ACT) 26. The facts allege and the
record confirms that Associate Judge Kaitcer, attorney Cooper L. Carter, and
Petitioner Morgan Michelle Myers knowingly signed and attempted to
compel the respondent to sign a court order containing false statements,
prepared by the incorrect attorney, and referenced a hearing that did not
occur on a motion that was never served on the Respondent. 27. Despite his
refusal to sign, the Court rendered this fraudulent order anyway, which
affected the respondent’s business and property interests, including his
ability to serve interstate clients, thus creating an effect on interstate
commerce. The use of false statements in a court order, which was intended
to deprive the Respondent of property or business interests, could also be
viewed as extortion under color of official right because the judge used his
position to compel compliance on a motion he had no jurisdiction to hear. 28.
The conduct described herein—compelling Respondent to sign or comply
with a court order containing knowingly false statements, prepared by the
wrong attorney, and referencing a non-existent hearing—constitutes
extortion under color of official right as defined by 18 U.S.C. § 1951 (the
Hobbs Act), as it involves the wrongful use of judicial authority to obtain, or
help another obtain, property or business interests, and it affects interstate
commerce. B. Tampering With Court Filings 29. The facts further allege that
after a motion to recuse was filed, court staff (Lindsey Baker) through
directive or on her own accord, altered the filing by removing exhibits and
affidavits, splitting the document, and removing hyperlinks after the motion
was filed and served. Because these actions were plausibly intended to
interfere with the respondent’s rights and to affect the outcome of the
recusal process, and because they involved the use of mail or wire
communications, they can also be characterized as predicate acts under
RICO. IV. ADDITIONAL PREDICATE ACTS INVOLVING THE OFFICE OF
ATTORNEY GENERAL 30. Respondent reminds this Court that the Office of
Attorney General has attempted to collect child support that is not legally
owed by Respondent, which constitutes the collection of an unlawful debt
under RICO. (DKT NO. 216) 31. The collection efforts involved documents
containing fraudulent or mismatched attorney signatures. Specifically,
pleadings submitted to this Court were signed by Holly Hayes, yet the
certificates of service identify Choya Burkley as the attorney of record. Upon

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
information and belief, Holly Hayes no longer works for the OAG, raising
serious questions about these documents' authenticity and legality. 32. The
use of improper signatures on legal documents filed with this Court to
collect an unlawful debt constitutes mail and/or wire fraud under 18 U.S.C.
§§ 1341 and 1343, as these documents were transmitted through electronic
filing systems and/or physical mail. 33. Under RICO, the collection of
unlawful debt is explicitly recognized as a standalone basis for liability,
independent from the requirement to show a pattern of racketeering
activity. 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). 34. Based on personal belief, Respondent
asserts that the intervention filed by the OAG, was, in fact, fraudulent.
Accordingly, a copy of this notice will be forwarded to the Attorney General
of Texas. V. LEGAL FRAMEWORK A. Federal RICO and Predicate Acts 35.
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) provides
both criminal and civil remedies for injuries caused by a pattern of
racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt. To state a civil RICO
claim, a plaintiff must allege: i. Conduct of an enterprise; ii. Through a
pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt; iii. Causing
injury to business or property; iv. Affecting interstate commerce. 32.
Racketeering activity includes acts indictable under federal mail and wire
fraud statutes (18 U.S.C. §§ 1341, 1343), as well as extortion under the
Hobbs Act (18 U.S.C. § 1951). 33. Extortion under the Hobbs Act includes
obtaining property from another, with consent, induced by wrongful use of
actual or threatened force, violence, or fear, or under color of official right,
affecting interstate commerce. B. Pattern, Relatedness, and Continuity 34.
RICO requires a pattern of racketeering activity, meaning at least two
predicate acts that are related and amount to or pose a threat of continued
criminal activity. The facts demonstrate multiple related acts: i. Compelling
execution of fraudulent orders; ii. Tampering with court filings; iii. Collection
of an unlawful debt. 35. These acts are related as they share the same
purpose (depriving Respondent of property and business interests),
participants (parties in this litigation), victims (Respondent), and methods
(fraudulent documents and abuse of court processes and positions of
power). 36. The continuity element is satisfied by the ongoing nature of
these activities spanning nearly two years, with new predicate acts
continuing to emerge, and likely to occur in the future. C. Effect on
Interstate Commerce 37. The alleged conduct directly affects interstate
commerce. Respondent operates a business with clients throughout the
United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada. The fraudulent orders,
tampering with court records, and collection of unlawful debt have impaired
Respondent's ability to serve these interstate clients. (DKT NOS. 81-89) 38.
RICO requires only a minimal effect on interstate commerce, which is
satisfied here through: i. The involvement of interstate clients; ii. Direct
impact on a business engaged in interstate commerce. D. Injury to Business
or Property 39. Respondent has suffered direct injury to his business and
property interests through: i. Being dispossessed of his home; ii. Being
divested of his business operations; iii. Having his ability to serve interstate
clients impaired; iv. Being subjected to the collection of an unlawful debt; v.
Being deprived of fair court proceedings through tampering with filed
documents. E. Judicial Immunity Limitations 40. While judicial immunity
generally protects judges for acts performed in their judicial capacity,
immunity does not apply to: i. Acts taken in the clear absence of all
jurisdiction; ii. Nonjudicial acts. 41. Under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
18a, when a motion to recuse is filed, the judge shall take no further action
in the case until it is decided. Altering a recusal motion after it was filed
would constitute an act taken outside of all jurisdiction. 42. Additionally,
attorneys, private parties, and government agency representatives do not
enjoy judicial immunity when engaging in conduct constituting predicate
acts under RICO. VI. CONCLUSION 43. Based on the facts detailed herein,
which are facially supported by the record, the conduct of the named parties
constitutes a pattern of racketeering activity affecting interstate commerce
and causing direct injury to Respondent's business and property interests
that, if necessary, will be pursued and plead with particularity. 44. This
notice is not an effort to harass, intimidate, or threaten the Court, opposing
counsel, court staff, the Petitioner, or the OAG. These are merely the facts
supported by the record. Respondent prays that this Court take immediate
corrective action regarding the unlawful conduct described herein,
including: a. Investigation into the authenticity of all documents filed in this
matter by the opposing side; b. Restoration of Respondent's property
interests affected by fraudulent orders; c. Addressing the Petitioner's
underlying illegal scheme that forms the foundation of this case, or in the
alternative, require a response from the opposing side; d. Consider case
dismissal given these extraordinary circumstances. 45. Because the Court
has failed to address these critical issues, including the complete lack of
prosecution by the opposing side, and has sua sponte set this matter for final
trial, thereby threatening to permanently divest Respondent of his interests,
he has been left with no choice but to pursue these claims to protect his
children, himself, and their collective livelihood. 46. This provided notice
comes in good faith, and Respondent’s claims are not limited to the context
of this notice, and additional facts or details may be plead if a Federal Action
must be pursued given that the Respondent has no alternative option.

Answer (Texas)
Short response
If the allegations are true, the judges may not have immunity because they
allegedly acted outside their jurisdiction and engaged in nonjudicial acts,
both of which are exceptions to judicial immunity under Texas law. Judge
Munford should be recused because the facts, if proven, demonstrate both a
lack of impartiality and procedural impropriety, including taking further
action after a recusal motion was filed and altering court filings.

Summary
Judicial immunity in Texas is robust but not absolute; it does not protect
judges for actions taken in the clear absence of all jurisdiction or for
nonjudicial acts. The allegations here, if substantiated, indicate that the
judges acted without jurisdiction—by issuing orders after being divested of
authority by a timely de novo hearing request and by taking further action
after a recusal motion was filed—and engaged in nonjudicial conduct, such
as tampering with court filings, which would remove the shield of judicial
immunity.
Furthermore, Texas law and precedent require recusal when a judge’s
impartiality might reasonably be questioned or when the judge acts outside
the bounds of proper judicial conduct. The alleged actions—continuing to act
after a recusal motion, altering the content of a recusal motion, and
participating in or enabling fraudulent orders—constitute grounds for
recusal under both statutory and case law, as they undermine the fairness
and integrity of the judicial process.
Background and Relevant Law
Legislative Framework
Texas law provides that judges are generally immune from liability for acts
performed in their judicial capacity and within their jurisdiction, as codified
in statutes such as Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 101.053 and Tex. Gov’t
Code § 54.974. However, this immunity is expressly limited: it does not apply
to acts taken in the clear absence of all jurisdiction or to nonjudicial acts.
The Texas Family Code and Government Code set out specific procedures for
de novo hearings following an associate judge’s report or temporary order.
Under Tex. Fam. Code §§ 201.015 and 201.317, and Tex. Gov’t Code § 54A.
115, a timely request for a de novo hearing divests the associate judge of
jurisdiction over the specified matters and transfers authority to the
referring court. Only the referring court may hear and render orders on
motions for postjudgment relief, including motions to vacate, correct, or
reform a judgment (Tex. Fam. Code § 201.104).
Regarding recusal, Tex. Gov’t Code § 25.00255 and Texas Rule of Civil
Procedure 18a require that, once a motion to recuse is filed, the judge must
refrain from taking further action in the case except for good cause stated in
the order. The judge must also forward the motion and all related materials
in their original form or as certified copies.
The Texas Constitution (art. 15 § 6) and Tex. Gov’t Code § 33.001 provide for
the removal or discipline of judges for incompetence, partiality, oppression,
or other official misconduct, and for willful or persistent conduct
inconsistent with judicial duties.

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Case Law
Texas courts have consistently held that judicial immunity is absolute for
judicial acts performed within jurisdiction, even if those acts are erroneous,
malicious, or in excess of authority (Dallas County v. Halsey, 87 S.W.3d 552
(Tex. 2002); Smith v. Dist. Attorney Office for Wood Cnty., NO. 03-13-00220-
CV (Tex. App. Oct 24, 2014)). However, there are two well-established
exceptions: (1) when the judge’s actions are nonjudicial in nature, and (2)
when the actions are taken in the complete absence of all jurisdiction
(Mireles v. Waco, 502 U.S. 9 (1991); Partain v. Gabert, 13-21-00037-CV (Tex.
App. Aug 26, 2021); Machetta v. Millard, NO. 01-17-00857-CV (Tex. App. Oct
25, 2018)).
Judicial acts are those normally performed by a judge in their official
capacity, in connection with a case pending before them (Bradt v. West, 892
S.W.2d 56 (Tex. App. 1994)). The focus is not on the propriety of the act, but
on whether the judge had jurisdiction to perform an act of that kind in the
case.
Recusal is required when a judge’s impartiality might reasonably be
questioned, including situations involving personal bias, prejudice, or
personal knowledge of disputed facts (Aguilar v. Anderson, 855 S.W.2d 799
(Tex. App. 1993)). Once a recusal motion is filed, the judge must take no
further action in the case until the motion is resolved, except for good cause
(Tex. Gov’t Code § 25.00255).
Analysis
1. Judicial Immunity: Exceptions and Application
Judicial immunity is a foundational doctrine protecting judges from liability
for acts performed in their judicial capacity and within their jurisdiction.
However, the doctrine is not absolute. The two recognized exceptions are:
(1) actions taken in the clear absence of all jurisdiction, and (2) nonjudicial
acts (Mireles v. Waco, 502 U.S. 9 (1991); Walker v. Hartman, 516 S.W.3d 71
(Tex. App. 2017); Feist v. Gist, NO. 09-18-00255-CV (Tex. App. Oct 24,
2019)).
a. Absence of Jurisdiction
The Texas Family Code is explicit: once a party files a timely request for a de
novo hearing, the associate judge is divested of jurisdiction over the
specified matters, and only the referring court may act (Tex. Fam. Code §
201.015; Tex. Fam. Code § 201.104). If, as alleged, the associate judge or
any other judge continued to issue orders or take action on matters over
which they no longer had jurisdiction, those acts would be performed in the
clear absence of all jurisdiction. This is not a mere procedural error or an
act in excess of authority; it is a fundamental jurisdictional defect that
removes the protection of judicial immunity (Feist v. Gist, NO. 09-18-00255-
CV (Tex. App. Oct 24, 2019); Walker v. Hartman, 516 S.W.3d 71 (Tex. App.
2017)).

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Similarly, if Judge Munford or any other judge took further action in the case
after a motion to recuse was filed, without good cause stated in the order,
this would also be an act outside the scope of their jurisdiction as defined by
statute and rule (Tex. Gov’t Code § 25.00255).
b. Nonjudicial Acts
Judicial immunity does not extend to nonjudicial acts—those not normally
performed by a judge or not taken in the judge’s official capacity (Machetta
v. Millard, NO. 01-17-00857-CV (Tex. App. Oct 25, 2018); Bradt v. West, 892
S.W.2d 56 (Tex. App. 1994)). Tampering with court filings, such as removing
exhibits and affidavits from a recusal motion or altering the content of a filed
document, is not a judicial act. Such conduct is administrative or clerical,
and if done to interfere with a party’s rights or the outcome of a proceeding,
it is outside the scope of judicial immunity.
2. Grounds for Recusal
Texas law requires recusal when a judge’s impartiality might reasonably be
questioned, including situations involving bias, prejudice, or personal
knowledge of disputed facts (Aguilar v. Anderson, 855 S.W.2d 799 (Tex. App.
1993)). The law also mandates that, once a recusal motion is filed, the judge
must refrain from taking further action in the case until the motion is
resolved, except for good cause (Tex. Gov’t Code § 25.00255).
The allegations here, if true, demonstrate both a lack of impartiality and
procedural impropriety:
Judge Munford allegedly took further action after a recusal motion was
filed, in violation of statutory requirements.
The court coordinator, under the judge’s authority, allegedly altered the
content of a recusal motion by removing exhibits and affidavits, which
could be seen as interfering with the recusal process and undermining
the integrity of the proceedings.
The judge allegedly participated in or enabled the issuance of orders
based on false statements, prepared by the wrong attorney, and
referencing hearings that did not occur.
Such conduct, if proven, would create at least the appearance of partiality
and would constitute willful or persistent conduct inconsistent with the
proper performance of judicial duties (Tex. Const. art. 15 § 6; Tex. Gov’t
Code § 33.001). This is more than a mere error or an act in excess of
authority; it is a fundamental breach of the requirements of impartiality and
procedural fairness.
3. Application to the Alleged Facts
Assuming the allegations are true, the following acts would remove the
protection of judicial immunity and require recusal:
Issuing or enforcing orders after being divested of jurisdiction by a
timely de novo hearing request.
• 
• 
• 
• 

=== PAGE 9 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Taking further action in the case after a recusal motion was filed,
without good cause.
Tampering with court filings, such as removing exhibits and affidavits
from a recusal motion.
Participating in or enabling the issuance of fraudulent orders that
misrepresent the facts or the parties’ consent.
Each of these acts falls within the recognized exceptions to judicial
immunity and constitutes grounds for recusal under Texas law and
precedent.
Exceptions and Caveats
It is important to note that judicial immunity is not lost simply because a
judge acts in error, with malice, or in excess of authority (Dallas County v.
Halsey, 87 S.W.3d 552 (Tex. 2002); Smith v. Dist. Attorney Office for Wood
Cnty., NO. 03-13-00220-CV (Tex. App. Oct 24, 2014)). The critical distinction
is whether the judge acted in the clear absence of all jurisdiction or engaged
in nonjudicial acts. If the judge’s actions, though improper, were still within
the general subject-matter jurisdiction of the court and were judicial in
nature, immunity may still apply.
Additionally, the denial of a recusal motion does not automatically void the
judge’s subsequent acts, but such acts may be reversed on appeal if the
appellate court finds that recusal was warranted (Union Pacific Resources
Co., In re, 969 S.W.2d 427 (Tex. 1998)). However, if the judge acted without
jurisdiction or engaged in nonjudicial conduct, those acts may be void or
subject to collateral attack.
Conclusion
In summary, if the allegations are true, the judges may not have immunity
because they allegedly acted outside their jurisdiction—by issuing orders
after being divested of authority and by taking further action after a recusal
motion was filed—and engaged in nonjudicial acts, such as tampering with
court filings. These actions fall squarely within the recognized exceptions to
judicial immunity under Texas law and precedent. Furthermore, the facts, if
proven, demonstrate both a lack of impartiality and procedural impropriety,
requiring recusal to preserve the fairness and integrity of the judicial
process. The relevant statutes and case law provide a clear basis for both
the loss of judicial immunity and the necessity of recusal in these
circumstances.

Extract
Tex. Fam. Code § 201.005 (emphasis added). In turn, our Code Construction
Act provides that the term 'shall,' when it appears in statute, 'imposes a
duty.' Tex. Gov’t Code § 311.016(2). Thus, we agree with the reasoning of the
Fourteenth Court of Appeals, which has held that a trial court 'has no
discretion to overrule a timely objection to the referral' to an associate judge
under the Family Code and conditionally granted a petition for writ of
mandamus to review such an action by the trial court. In re Baker, 495 S.W.
3d 393, 397 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2016, orig. proceeding).
Summary
A trial court does not have discretion to overrule a timely objection to the
referral to an associate judge. This suggests that if a judge acts outside of
their jurisdiction or in violation of procedural rules, such as overruling a
timely objection, they may not be protected by judicial immunity.
Additionally, if a judge fails to follow mandatory procedures, it could be
grounds for recusal.

The same reasons underlying immunity of district judges from tort liability

conclusion that justices of the peace should enjoy a like immunity when
acting in the course of judicial proceedings of which they have jurisdiction.

mere fact that in the course of such a proceeding a justice of the peace may
refuse, but by writ of mandamus be compelled, to perform a clear legal duty,
involving the exercise of no discretion, will not subject him to tort liability.
Summary
Judges, including justices of the peace, are generally immune from tort
liability for actions taken within their jurisdiction during judicial
proceedings. This immunity is meant to protect judges from being sued for
their judicial actions, provided they are acting within their jurisdiction.
However, if a judge acts outside of their jurisdiction or performs nonjudicial
acts, this immunity may not apply. In the context of the question, if Judge
Munford acted outside of his jurisdiction or engaged in nonjudicial acts,
such as altering a recusal motion after it was filed, this could potentially
remove the protection of judicial immunity.

In contrast, the erroneous denial of a recusal motion does not void or nullify
the presiding judge's subsequent acts. While a judgment rendered in such
circumstances may be reversed on appeal, it is not fundamental error and
can be waived if not raised by proper motion. See Buckholts Indep. Sch.
Dist., 632 S.W.2d at 148; Gulf Maritime Warehouse Co. v. Towers, 858 S.W.2d
556, 559 (Tex.App.--Beaumont 1993, writ denied); Aguilar v. Anderson, 855
S.W.2d 799, 809-810 (Tex.App.--El Paso 1993, writ denied); AmSav Group,
Inc. v. Amer. Sav. & Loan Ass'n, 796 S.W.2d 482, 485 (Tex.App.--Houston [14
th Dist.] 1990, writ denied). Recognizing this distinction, our Rules of Civil
Procedure expressly provide for appellate review from a final judgment after
denial of a recusal motion. See TEX.R. CIV. P. 18a(f); Thomas v. Walker, 860
S.W.2d 579, 581 (Tex.App.--Waco 1993, orig. proceeding). If the appellate
court determines that the judge presiding over the recusal hearing abused
his or her discretion in denying the motion and the trial judge should have
been recused, the appellate court can reverse the trial court's judgment and
remand for a new trial before a different judge. This procedure is no
different than the correction of any trial court error through the normal
appellate process.
Summary
The passage explains that the denial of a recusal motion does not
automatically void the actions of the presiding judge. However, if the
appellate court finds that the judge should have been recused, it can reverse
the judgment and order a new trial before a different judge. This indicates
that while the denial of a recusal motion is not a fundamental error, it can be
corrected through the appellate process if it is determined that the judge
abused their discretion. This is relevant to the question of judicial immunity
because it suggests that if a judge acts outside their jurisdiction or in a
manner that violates procedural rules, such as improperly denying a recusal
motion, their actions may be subject to review and correction.

If the trial court refers the suit to an associate judge for trial, '[a] party must
file an objection not later than the 10th day after the date the party receives
notice that the associate judge will hear the trial. If an objection is filed, the

Tex. Fam.Code § 201.005(c) (West Supp.2015). 'If one of the parties files a
timely written objection to the associate judge presiding over trial, the case

2011, orig. proceeding) (mem.op.). Thus, a trial court has no discretion to
overrule a timely objection to the referral.
Summary
If a party files a timely objection to an associate judge presiding over a trial,
the referring court must hear the case instead. This means that the trial
court does not have discretion to ignore such an objection. In the context of
the allegations, if the associate judge continued to act despite a timely
objection, this could be seen as acting outside of their jurisdiction, which
might negate judicial immunity. Additionally, if the judge failed to follow
proper procedures, this could be grounds for recusal.
Delcourt v. Silverman, 919 S.W.2d 777 (Tex. App. 1996)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
It is well-established that judges are absolutely immune from liability for
judicial acts that are not performed in the clear absence of all jurisdiction,
no matter how erroneous the act or how evil the motive. ... When judges
delegate their authority or appoint others to perform services for the court,
the judicial immunity that attaches to the judge may follow the delegation or
appointment. ... This type of absolute immunity is referred to as 'derived
judicial immunity.' ... The policy underlying derived judicial immunity that
protects participants in judicial and other adjudicatory proceedings is
sound. ... Courts around the country have followed the lead of the United
States Supreme Court and adopted a functional approach in determining
whether a party is entitled to absolute immunity.
Summary
Judges are generally protected by absolute immunity for judicial acts unless
those acts are performed in the clear absence of all jurisdiction. This
immunity extends to those who are delegated authority by the judge, known
as derived judicial immunity. However, if a judge acts outside of their
jurisdiction, this immunity may not apply. In the context of the question, if
Judge Munford acted outside of his jurisdiction, such as by altering a recusal
motion after it was filed, this could be considered an act outside of his
jurisdiction, potentially negating his immunity. Additionally, the recusal of a
judge is warranted if there is a question of impartiality or if the judge has
taken actions that are outside the scope of their judicial capacity.

Judicial immunity is absolute immunity, extending to acts performed by the
judge in error, maliciously, and even in excess of his authority. Judicial
immunity is overcome only when it is shown that the actions are nonjudicial
or undertaken in the 'clear absence of all jurisdiction.'
Summary
Judicial immunity in Texas is absolute and covers acts performed by a judge
even if done in error, maliciously, or in excess of authority. However, this
immunity can be overcome if it is shown that the judge's actions were
nonjudicial or undertaken in the clear absence of all jurisdiction. In the
context of the question, if the allegations against Judge Munford suggest
that he acted outside of his jurisdiction or engaged in nonjudicial acts, then
judicial immunity may not apply. Additionally, if a motion to recuse was filed
and the judge continued to act in the case, this could be seen as acting
outside of jurisdiction, supporting the argument for recusal.

Judges acting in their official judicial capacity are immune from liability and

Twilligear v. Carrell, 148 S.W.3d 502, 504 (Tex. App.-Houston [14th Dist.]

maliciously, and even in excess of the judge's authority. Id. (citing Stump v.
Sparkman, 435 U.S. 349, 356-57 (1978)). Like other forms of official
immunity, judicial immunity is an immunity from suit, not just from ultimate
assessment of damages. Mireles v. Waco, 502 U.S. 9, 11 (1991); Bradt v.
West, 892 S.W.2d 56, 67 (Tex. App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 1994, writ denied).
Summary
Judicial immunity in Texas protects judges from liability for acts performed
in their official capacity, even if those acts are erroneous, malicious, or
exceed their authority. However, this immunity applies only to acts within
the scope of their jurisdiction. If a judge acts outside of their jurisdiction,
they may not be protected by judicial immunity. Additionally, the passage
does not directly address recusal, but it implies that if a judge acts outside
their jurisdiction, it could be grounds for recusal.

Judicial immunity deprives a court of subject matter jurisdiction. Dallas Cty.

unless the plaintiff can show: (1) the claim is based on some act not taken in
the judge's judicial capacity or (2) the judge's actions were taken in the
complete absence of all jurisdiction. Mireles v. Waco, 502 U.S. 9, 10-12
(1991). It is an immunity from suit, not just from the assessment of damages.
Mireles, 502 U.S. at 11; Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 224.
Summary
Judicial immunity protects judges from liability for judicial acts performed
within their jurisdiction. However, this immunity does not apply if the
judge's actions were not taken in their judicial capacity or were taken in the
complete absence of all jurisdiction. In the context of the allegations, if
Judge Munford acted outside his jurisdiction or engaged in non-judicial acts,
he may not be protected by judicial immunity. Additionally, if a motion to
recuse was filed, the judge should refrain from taking further action until
the motion is decided, as per Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a.
Partain v. Gabert, 13-21-00037-CV (Tex. App. Aug 26, 2021)

Extract
There are only two circumstances when judicial immunity can be overcome:
(1) when the judge's actions were non-judicial in nature or (2) when the
actions were taken in the complete absence of all jurisdiction. See Mireles v.
Waco, 502 U.S. 9, 11 (1991).
Summary
Judicial immunity in Texas can be overcome if a judge's actions are non-
judicial in nature or if the actions were taken in the complete absence of all
jurisdiction. This means that if Judge Munford's actions fall into either of
these categories, he may not be protected by judicial immunity. Additionally,
if a motion to recuse is filed, the judge should not take further action in the
case until the motion is decided, which could be a basis for recusal if not
adhered to.

Summary
Judicial immunity generally protects judges from suit and liability for actions
performed in their judicial capacity. However, there are two exceptions: (1)
actions taken in the complete absence of all jurisdiction, and (2) nonjudicial
actions. If a judge acts outside of their jurisdiction or performs actions that
are not judicial in nature, they may not be protected by judicial immunity.

Summary
Judicial immunity in Texas protects judges from liability for actions taken in
their official capacity and within their jurisdiction. However, this immunity
does not apply if the actions are nonjudicial or taken in the complete
absence of jurisdiction. In the context of the question, if the allegations
against Judge Munford involve actions taken outside of his jurisdiction or
are nonjudicial, then judicial immunity may not apply. Additionally, if there is
a valid motion to recuse that has not been properly addressed, it could be
grounds for recusal.

because he was in error, took action maliciously[,] or was in excess of his
authority; rather he will be subject to liability only when he has acted in the
clear absence of all jurisdiction.'
Summary
Judicial immunity protects judges from liability for actions taken in their
judicial capacity, even if those actions are erroneous or malicious, as long as
they are within the judge's jurisdiction. However, if a judge acts in the clear
absence of all jurisdiction, they may not be protected by judicial immunity.
In the context of the question, if Judge Munford acted outside of his
jurisdiction, such as by altering a recusal motion after it was filed, this could
be considered an act taken in the absence of jurisdiction, potentially
removing immunity. Additionally, the passage suggests that recusal may be
appropriate if a judge's actions are outside their jurisdiction.

Furthermore, a judge acting in his or her official judicial capacity enjoys
absolute immunity from liability for judicial acts performed within the scope

(judge not deprived of immunity because action taken was in error, was done
maliciously, or was in excess of authority; immunity fails only when judge
acts in clear absence of jurisdiction); Turner v. Pruitt, 342 S.W.2d 422, 423
(Tex. 1961). 'Judges enjoy absolute judicial immunity from liability for
judicial acts, no matter how erroneous the act or how evil the motive[.]'
Summary
Judges in Texas enjoy absolute judicial immunity for acts performed within
their official capacity and jurisdiction. This immunity is not lost even if the
actions were erroneous or malicious, unless the judge acts in the clear
absence of jurisdiction. Therefore, if a judge acts outside of their
jurisdiction, they may not be protected by judicial immunity. In the context
of the question, if Judge Munford acted outside of his jurisdiction, as
alleged, he may not have immunity. Additionally, if there is a valid motion to
recuse based on actions taken outside of jurisdiction or other valid grounds,
the judge should be recused to ensure impartiality and fairness in the
proceedings.

A judge's judicial immunity can be overcome in only two instances: first,
where the complained-of actions were non-judicial; and second, where the
complained-of actions, though judicial in nature, were 'taken in the complete

Summary
Judicial immunity protects judges from lawsuits for actions performed in
their judicial capacity. However, this immunity can be overcome if the
actions were non-judicial or taken in the complete absence of all jurisdiction.
In the context of the allegations, if Judge Munford's actions were outside his
jurisdiction or non-judicial, he may not be protected by judicial immunity.
Additionally, if a motion to recuse was filed, the judge should refrain from
taking further action until the motion is decided, as per Texas Rule of Civil
Procedure 18a. If Judge Munford continued to act after the recusal motion,
it could be argued that he acted outside his jurisdiction, warranting recusal.

A judge has immunity when acting in the course of a judicial proceeding
over which he has jurisdiction. ... 'A judge will not be deprived of immunity
because he was in error, took action maliciously[,] or was in excess of his
authority; rather he will be subject to liability only when he has acted in the
clear absence of all jurisdiction.' ... 'Judicial acts include those performed by
judges in adjudicating, or otherwise exercising their judicial authority over,
proceedings pending in their courts.' ... Although we agree that Walker is
entitled to judicial immunity for ordering Hartman's arrest when a
disturbance (regardless of the cause of the disturbance) involving Hartman
occurred in Walker's courtroom while Walker was presiding, we do not agree
that Walker's alleged actions subsequent to Hartman's arrest are protected
by judicial immunity.
Summary
Judicial immunity protects judges for acts performed in their judicial
capacity, but it does not apply when a judge acts in the clear absence of all
jurisdiction. The passage also indicates that judicial acts are those
performed in adjudicating or exercising judicial authority over proceedings
pending in their courts. If a judge's actions fall outside these parameters,

such as acting without jurisdiction or engaging in nonjudicial acts, immunity
may not apply. Additionally, the passage suggests that actions taken outside

Summary
Judicial immunity protects judges from liability for judicial acts, regardless
of the act's correctness or the judge's motive. However, this immunity does
not apply if the judge acts in the clear absence of all jurisdiction. In the
context of the question, if Judge Munford acted without jurisdiction, as
alleged, then judicial immunity may not protect him. Additionally, the
passage does not directly address recusal, but the lack of jurisdiction could
be a basis for recusal if it affects the judge's ability to impartially preside

Jones v. Sherry, NO. 03-18-00279-CV (Tex. App. Jun 28, 2019)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
In Texas, courts apply a 'functional approach' to determine whether a person
is entitled to derived judicial immunity. Halsey, 87 S.W.3d at 554 (discussing
Delcourt, 919 S.W.2d at 782-83). This approach focuses on the nature of the
function performed, not the identity of the actor, and considers whether the
court officer's conduct is like that of the delegating or appointing judge. Id.
at 555. Under this functional approach, courts must assess 'whether the
person seeking immunity is intimately associated with the judicial process'
and whether 'that person exercises discretionary judgment comparable to
that of the judge.' Id. at 554. When an individual acquires derived judicial
immunity from a particular function, absolute immunity extends to 'every
action taken with regard to that function—whether good or bad, honest or
dishonest, well-intentioned or not.'

=== PAGE 19 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
The functional approach in Texas assesses whether an individual is entitled
to derived judicial immunity by focusing on the nature of the function
performed and whether the conduct is similar to that of a judge. If the
actions of the judges in question were outside the scope of their judicial
functions or were nonjudicial acts, they may not be entitled to immunity.
Additionally, if the actions were taken in the clear absence of all jurisdiction,
immunity would not apply. The passage also highlights that immunity
extends to actions taken with regard to a particular function, whether good
or bad, which suggests that if the actions were outside the judicial function,
immunity might not protect the judges.
Dallas County v. Halsey, 87 S.W.3d 552 (Tex. 2002)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
When entitled to the protection of derived judicial immunity, an officer of the
court receives the same immunity as a judge acting in his or her official
judicial capacity — absolute immunity from liability for judicial acts
performed within the scope of jurisdiction. Stump v. Sparkman, 435 U.S.
349, 356-57, 98 S.Ct. 1099, 55 L.Ed.2d 331 (1978) (stating that '[a] judge

(noting that in judicial proceedings in which the court has jurisdiction, a
judge is immune for his or her actions).
Summary
Judicial immunity protects judges from liability for judicial acts performed
within their jurisdiction. However, this immunity does not apply if a judge
acts in the "clear absence of all jurisdiction." In the context of the question,
if Judge Munford acted outside his jurisdiction, such as by altering a recusal
motion after it was filed, this could be considered an act taken in the clear
absence of all jurisdiction, thus negating judicial immunity. Additionally,
under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a, a judge must refrain from taking
further action in a case once a recusal motion is filed, which could further
support the argument for recusal if this rule was violated.

Chambers v. Pruitt, 241 S.W.3d 679 (Tex. App. 2007)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
In her final issue, Chambers seeks to have this court impose liability on the
trial judge and Kaufman County. Neither is a party to this lawsuit. Further,
in Texas, a judge acting in his or her official capacity is immune from liability
for judicial acts performed within the scope of jurisdiction. See Freeman v.
Wirecut E.D.M., Inc., 159 S.W.3d 721, 728 (Tex. App.-Dallas 2005, no pet.).
Because the trial court had jurisdiction, the judge has immunity. See
Delcourt v. Silverman, 919 S.W.2d 777, 781 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.]
1996, writ denied). Similarly, Kaufman County is immune.
Summary
In Texas, judges are generally immune from liability for actions taken in
their official capacity, as long as those actions are within the scope of their
jurisdiction. This means that if a judge is acting within their jurisdiction,
they are protected by judicial immunity. However, if a judge acts outside of
their jurisdiction, this immunity may not apply. The passage does not
directly address recusal but implies that jurisdiction is a key factor in
determining immunity.

immunity is overcome only for actions that are: (1) nonjudicial, i.e., not
taken in the judge's official capacity; or (2) taken in the complete absence of
all jurisdiction).
Summary
Judges are generally entitled to absolute immunity for actions taken in their
judicial capacity. However, this immunity does not apply if the actions were
taken in the clear absence of all jurisdiction or if the actions were
nonjudicial. In the context of the allegations, if Judge Munford acted outside
of his jurisdiction or engaged in nonjudicial acts, he may not be entitled to
immunity. Additionally, the passage suggests that if a judge takes actions
after a motion to recuse has been filed, it could be considered outside of
their jurisdiction, which could be grounds for recusal.

Judges acting in their official judicial capacity have immunity from liability

Summary
Judicial immunity protects judges from liability for actions taken in their
official capacity, even if those actions are erroneous or exceed their
authority. However, this immunity does not apply to actions that are
nonjudicial or taken in the complete absence of jurisdiction. In the context of
the allegations, if Judge Munford acted outside of his jurisdiction or engaged
in nonjudicial acts, such as altering a recusal motion after it was filed, these
actions could potentially overcome judicial immunity. Additionally, the
passage suggests that judicial immunity does not bar prospective injunctive
relief against a judge, which could be relevant if the Respondent seeks such
relief.

Bumpus v. Fisher, 21 Tex. 561 (Tex. 1858)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
All courts are, and should be, responsible for malicious acts, corruption and
oppression, the superior, by impeachment of the judges, and the inferior, by
indictment, and civil suit before the superior courts.
Summary
The passage from Bumpus v. Fisher indicates that judges, regardless of their
level, can be held accountable for malicious acts, corruption, and
oppression. This suggests that judicial immunity does not protect judges
from actions taken outside their judicial capacity or in the absence of
jurisdiction. In the context of the allegations, if the judges acted maliciously
or corruptly, they may not be protected by judicial immunity. Additionally,
the passage supports the idea that judges can be recused or removed from a
case if there is evidence of such conduct.
Thomas v. Walker, 860 S.W.2d 579 (Tex. App. 1993)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Relator alleges in his petition for writ of mandamus against Judge Black that
the judge's obligation under Rule 18a to voluntarily recuse himself was
mandatory because of what Relator describes as the 'appearance of
partiality' supposedly evidenced by violations of the Code of Judicial
Conduct resulting from Judge Black's alleged ex parte communications with
opposing counsel and her client.
Summary
Obligation of a judge to recuse themselves under Rule 18a when there is an
"appearance of partiality," which can arise from violations of the Code of
Judicial Conduct, such as ex parte communications. This is relevant to the
question because it provides a basis for recusal when a judge's impartiality
might reasonably be questioned. In the context of the allegations against
Judge Munford, if there is an appearance of partiality or actions taken
outside of jurisdiction, such as altering a recusal motion, it could justify
recusal and negate judicial immunity for those specific actions.

jurisdiction. Stump v. Sparkman, 435 U.S. 349, 98 S.Ct. 1099, 55 L.Ed.2d
331 (1978). Further, the Court has stated that: Disagreement with the action
taken by the judge, however, does not justify depriving that judge of his
immunity. Despite the unfairness to litigants that sometimes results, the
doctrine of judicial immunity is thought to be in the best interests of 'the
proper administration of justice ... [, for it allows] a judicial officer, in
exercising the authority vested in him [to] be free to act upon his own
convictions, without apprehension of personal consequences to himself.'
Stump, 435 U.S. at 363, 98 S.Ct. at 1108, 55 L.Ed.2d at 343 (citing Bradley
v. Fisher, 13 Wall. 335, 347, 20 L.Ed. 646, 649 (1872)); see also Pierson v.
Ray, 386 U.S. 547, 87 S.Ct. 1213, 18 L.Ed.2d 288 (1967) (judicial immunity
applies even when a judge is accused of acting maliciously and corruptly).
Summary
Judicial immunity generally protects judges from liability for their judicial
acts, even if those acts are alleged to be done maliciously or corruptly.
However, this immunity does not apply if the acts fall clearly outside the
judge's subject-matter jurisdiction. In the context of the question, if the
allegations are true and the judge acted outside of their jurisdiction, then
judicial immunity may not apply. Additionally, the passage does not directly
address recusal, but it implies that actions outside of jurisdiction could be
grounds for recusal.
Aguilar v. Anderson, 855 S.W.2d 799 (Tex. App. 1993)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Texas law at the time of this decision required that: Judges shall recuse
themselves in proceedings in which their impartiality might reasonably be
questioned.... TEX.R.CIV.P. 18b(2). ... Disqualification and recusal are not
synonymous terms. Disqualification of a judge on the constitutional grounds
of interest, relationship to a party or having served as counsel in the case is
absolute. TEX. CONST. art. V, § 11. Disqualification cannot be waived and
can be raised at any time, even by a collateral attack of the judgment. ... On
the other hand, recusal of a judge on any ground not enumerated as
disqualifying in the Texas Constitution is governed by statute and rule. A
party waives its right to recusal of a judge if it does not raise the issue in a
proper motion. ... TEX.R.CIV.P. 18b(2) (Vernon Supp.1988), in effect at the
time Appellants' Motion to Recuse was filed and heard, provided in pertinent
part: Recusal. Judges shall recuse themselves in proceedings in which their
impartiality might reasonably be questioned, including but not limited to,

instances in which they have a personal bias or prejudice concerning the
subject matter or a party, or personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary
facts concerning the proceeding.
Summary
Conditions under which a judge in Texas should recuse themselves,
specifically when their impartiality might reasonably be questioned. This
includes situations where there is personal bias or prejudice concerning the
subject matter or a party, or personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary
facts. The passage also distinguishes between disqualification and recusal,
noting that disqualification is absolute and based on constitutional grounds,
while recusal is governed by statute and rule. This is relevant to the
question because it provides a legal basis for recusal if the judge's
impartiality is in question, which could be applicable if the allegations
against Judge Munford suggest bias or prejudice.
Bradt v. West, 892 S.W.2d 56 (Tex. App. 1994)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The judges of Texas courts have absolute immunity for their judicial acts
'unless such acts fall clearly outside the judge's subject-matter
jurisdiction.' ... The factors we consider in determining whether a judge's act
is a 'judicial' one are (1) whether the act complained of is one normally
performed by a judge, (2) whether the act occurred in the courtroom or an
appropriate adjunct such as the judge's chambers, (3) whether the
controversy centered around a case pending before the judge, and (4)
whether the act arose out of a visit to the judge in his judicial capacity. ... In
determining whether an act was clearly outside a judge's jurisdiction for
judicial immunity purposes, the focus is not on whether the judge's specific
act was proper or improper, but on whether the judge had the jurisdiction
necessary to perform an act of that kind in the case.
Summary
Judicial immunity in Texas protects judges for acts performed in their
judicial capacity unless those acts fall clearly outside the judge's subject-
matter jurisdiction. The passage outlines factors to determine if an act is
"judicial," such as whether it is normally performed by a judge and whether
it occurred in a judicial setting. The focus is on whether the judge had
jurisdiction to perform the act, not on the propriety of the act itself. If a
judge acts outside their jurisdiction, they may not be protected by judicial
immunity.

=== PAGE 25 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
A magistrate has the same judicial immunity as a district judge or a judge of
a county court at law, as applicable.
Summary
Magistrates, district judges, and judges of county courts at law in Texas are
granted judicial immunity, which typically protects them from liability for
acts performed in their judicial capacity. However, judicial immunity does
not apply to acts taken in the clear absence of all jurisdiction or to
nonjudicial acts. In the scenario described, if the judges acted outside their
jurisdiction or engaged in nonjudicial acts, they may not be protected by
judicial immunity. Additionally, under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a, a
judge must refrain from taking further action in a case once a motion to
recuse is filed until it is decided. If Judge Munford took actions after the
recusal motion was filed, it could be argued that he acted outside his
jurisdiction, which would be a basis for recusal.
Tex. Gov't. Code § 25.00255 Tex. Gov't. Code § 25.00255 Recusal Or
Disqualification of Judge
Extract
A judge who recuses himself or herself: shall enter an order of recusal and:
(A) if the judge serves a statutory probate court located in a county with
only one statutory probate court, request that the presiding judge assign a
judge under Section GOVERNMENT CODE 25.002201 to hear the case; or
(B) subject to Subsection (l), if the judge serves a statutory probate court
located in a county with more than one statutory probate court, request that
the presiding judge order the clerk who serves the statutory probate courts
in that county to randomly reassign the case to a judge of one of the other
statutory probate courts located in the county; and may not take other
action in the case except for good cause stated in the order in which the
action is taken.
Summary
A judge who is subject to recusal or disqualification must enter an order of
recusal and request reassignment of the case to another judge. The judge
may not take further action in the case except for good cause. This indicates
that if a judge continues to act in a case after a recusal motion is filed, it
could be considered an act outside of their jurisdiction, which is relevant to
the question of judicial immunity. Judicial immunity does not apply to acts
taken in the clear absence of all jurisdiction or nonjudicial acts. Therefore, if
Judge Munford continued to act in the case after a recusal motion was filed,
it could be argued that he acted outside of his jurisdiction, potentially
negating judicial immunity.

Tex. Fam. Code § 201.317 Tex. Fam. Code § 201.317 De Novo Hearing
Extract
A party may request a de novo hearing before the referring court by filing
with the clerk of the referring court a written request not later than the
third working day after the date the party receives notice of the substance of
the associate judge's report as provided by Section FAMILY CODE 201.313.
Summary
A party has the right to request a de novo hearing before the referring court
within a specific timeframe after receiving notice of an associate judge's
report. This process is crucial because it divests the associate judge of
jurisdiction over the specified matters and transfers authority to the
referring court. If a judge acts outside of this jurisdictional framework, such
as by taking actions on matters they no longer have jurisdiction over, it
could be argued that they are acting outside the scope of their judicial
capacity, which may limit their judicial immunity. Additionally, if a judge fails
to follow the procedural requirements for recusal, as outlined in Texas Rule
of Civil Procedure 18a, it could be grounds for recusal.
Tex. Gov't. Code § 54A.115 Tex. Gov't. Code § 54A.115 De Novo Hearing
Extract
A party may request a de novo hearing before the referring court by filing
with the clerk of the referring court a written request not later than the
seventh working day after the date the party receives notice of the
substance of the associate judge's decision as provided by Section
GOVERNMENT CODE 54A.111.
Summary
A party has the right to request a de novo hearing before the referring court
within a specified timeframe after receiving notice of an associate judge's
decision. This process is crucial because it divests the associate judge of
jurisdiction over the specified matters, transferring authority to the
referring court. If a judge acts outside of their jurisdiction, such as by taking
actions on matters they no longer have authority over, they may not be
protected by judicial immunity. Additionally, if a judge alters or interferes
with court filings, as alleged, this could be considered a nonjudicial act,
further removing the shield of judicial immunity. The recusal of a judge may
be warranted if there is evidence of bias, misconduct, or actions taken
outside of their jurisdiction, as these undermine the fairness and integrity of
the judicial process.

Tex. Fam. Code § 201.104 Tex. Fam. Code § 201.104 Powers of Associate
Judge
Extract
Only the referring court may hear and render an order on a motion for
postjudgment relief, including a motion for a new trial or to vacate, correct,
or reform a judgment.
Summary
Only the referring court has the authority to hear and render orders on
motions for postjudgment relief. This means that if an associate judge or any
other judge acts outside of this jurisdiction, they may be acting in the clear
absence of all jurisdiction, which is a condition under which judicial
immunity does not apply. In the case presented, if Judge Munford or
Associate Judge Kaitcer acted on matters they were not authorized to
handle, they could be seen as acting outside their jurisdiction, thus
potentially losing judicial immunity. Additionally, if a motion to recuse was
filed and the judge continued to act on the case, this could further support
the argument for recusal due to a lack of impartiality or procedural
impropriety.
Tex. Fam. Code § 201.015 Tex. Fam. Code § 201.015 De Novo Hearing
Before Referring Court
Extract
A party may request a de novo hearing before the referring court by filing
with the clerk of the referring court a written request not later than the
third working day after the date the party receives notice of: the substance
of the associate judge's report as provided by Section FAMILY CODE
201.011; or the rendering of the temporary order, if the request concerns a
temporary order rendered by an associate judge under Section FAMILY
CODE 201.007(a)(C).
Summary
A party has the right to request a de novo hearing before the referring court
within a specific timeframe after receiving notice of an associate judge's
report or temporary order. This provision is crucial because it divests the
associate judge of jurisdiction over the specified matters and transfers
authority to the referring court. If a judge acts outside of this jurisdictional
framework, such as by altering or enforcing orders without proper authority,
it could be argued that they are acting outside the scope of their judicial
capacity, which may limit their judicial immunity. Additionally, if a judge fails
to follow procedural requirements, such as those outlined in Tex. Fam. Code
§ 201.015, it could be grounds for recusal due to a lack of impartiality or
procedural fairness.

Tex. Civ. Prac. and Rem. Code § 101.053 Tex. Civ. Prac. and Rem. Code §
101.053 Judicial
Extract
This chapter does not apply to a claim based on an act or omission of a court
of this state or any member of a court of this state acting in his official
capacity or to a judicial function of a governmental unit. 'Official capacity'
means all duties of office and includes administrative decisions or actions.
Summary
The Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code § 101.053 provides immunity to
courts and their members for acts or omissions performed in their official
capacity. This includes all duties of office, such as administrative decisions
or actions. However, the allegations in the question suggest that the judges
may have acted outside their jurisdiction or engaged in nonjudicial acts,
which could potentially fall outside the scope of this immunity. Additionally,
if a judge takes actions after a motion to recuse has been filed, it could be
argued that they are acting outside their jurisdiction, which may not be
protected by judicial immunity.

accordance with Rule 119, Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, that waives notice
to the party of the final hearing or waives the party's appearance at the final
hearing;
Summary
Powers of an associate judge, including the ability to render and sign certain
orders, subject to the right to a de novo hearing. This indicates that the
associate judge's actions are limited by the right to a de novo hearing,
which, if requested, divests the associate judge of jurisdiction over the
specified matters. This is relevant to the question of judicial immunity
because if a judge acts outside of their jurisdiction, they may not be
protected by judicial immunity. Additionally, the passage highlights the
importance of adhering to procedural rules, which is relevant to the recusal
question, as failure to follow these rules could be grounds for recusal.

Tex. Gov't. Code § 33.022 Tex. Gov't. Code § 33.022 [Effective 9/1/2025]
Investigations and Formal Proceedings
Extract
The commission may conduct a preliminary investigation of the
circumstances surrounding an allegation or appearance of misconduct or
disability of a judge to determine if the allegation or appearance is
unfounded or frivolous... If, after conducting a preliminary investigation
under this section, the commission does not determine that an allegation or
appearance of misconduct or disability is unfounded or frivolous, the
commission: shall: (A) conduct a full investigation of the circumstances
surrounding the allegation or appearance of misconduct or disability; and
(B) not more than seven business days after the commission staff
commences a full investigation under this subsection, notify the judge in
writing of: (i) the commencement of the investigation; (ii) the nature of the
allegation or appearance of misconduct or disability being investigated; and
(iii) the judge's right to attend each commission meeting at which the
complaint is included in the report filed with commission members under
Section 33.0212(a-2)...
Summary
The Texas Government Code provides a mechanism for investigating
allegations of judicial misconduct. If an allegation is not deemed unfounded
or frivolous, a full investigation is conducted, and the judge is notified of the
investigation and the nature of the allegations. This process ensures that
judges are held accountable for their actions and that any misconduct is
thoroughly investigated. This is relevant to the question of judicial immunity
and recusal because it outlines the process by which a judge can be
investigated for misconduct, which may lead to recusal if the allegations are
substantiated.
Tex. Const. art. 15 § 6 Tex. Const. art. 15 § 6 Judges of District Court;
Removal By Supreme Court
Extract
Any judge of the District Courts of the State who is incompetent to
discharge the duties of his office, or who shall be guilty of partiality, or
oppression, or other official misconduct, or whose habits and conduct are
such as to render him unfit to hold such office, or who shall negligently fail
to perform his duties as judge; or who shall fail to execute in a reasonable
measure the business in his courts, may be removed by the Supreme Court.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
The passage provides grounds for the removal of a judge by the Supreme
Court if they are found to be incompetent, guilty of partiality, oppression, or
other official misconduct, or if their conduct renders them unfit to hold
office. This suggests that if a judge engages in misconduct or fails to
perform their duties, they may not be protected by judicial immunity.
Additionally, the passage implies that such conduct could be grounds for
recusal if it affects the judge's ability to impartially and competently preside
over a case.

Definitions
Extract
For purposes of Section 1-a, Article V, Texas Constitution, 'wilful or
persistent conduct that is clearly inconsistent with the proper performance
of a judge's duties' includes: ... wilful violation of a provision of the Texas
penal statutes or the Code of Judicial Conduct; ... persistent or wilful
violation of the rules promulgated by the supreme court; ... failure to
cooperate with the commission; ... The definitions provided by Subsections
(b) and (d) are not exclusive.
Summary
Judges in Texas can be subject to disciplinary actions, including recusal, for
willful or persistent conduct that is inconsistent with their duties. This
includes violations of the Texas penal statutes, the Code of Judicial Conduct,
and rules promulgated by the supreme court. The passage suggests that
such conduct could lead to a judge being recused if it is proven that they
acted outside their jurisdiction or engaged in nonjudicial acts, which are not
protected by judicial immunity.
Qualified and Absolute Immunity at Common Law.
Stanford Law Review - Stanford Law School - Keller, Scott A. -
2021-06-01
Extract
Yet toward the end of its 2019 Term, the Court denied several petitions for
certiorari urging this reexamination. (7) Justice Thomas dissented from the
denial of certiorari in one of... a probate court"--with authority over only
"wills" and "estates"--initiated criminal trials "for public offences," then
jurisdiction would be "entirely wanting," and the judge would lack immunity.
(74) But an officer retained immunity for discretionary acts merely in excess
of jurisdiction. For instance, if a court with criminal jurisdiction held "a

=== PAGE 31 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
particular act to be a public offence"--although the law did not make the act
an offense--the judge would still have immunity even though authorizing an
arrest and trial for that nonoffense "would be in excess of his
jurisdiction." (75) This doctrine therefore retained an "exemption from
liability which obtains for errors." (76)
Summary
N example where a probate court, which only has authority over wills and
estates, initiates criminal trials for public offenses, thus acting entirely
outside its jurisdiction. In such cases, the judge would lack immunity. This
principle is relevant to the question because if Judge Munford acted outside
his jurisdiction, as alleged, he may not be entitled to immunity.
RICO: A Primer
Extract
Under Section 1962(d), it is a violation to conspire to commit any of the
three substantive RICO offenses. To prove a violation of Section 1962(d), a
plaintiff must prove the following elements: * The existence of an enterprise
(or that an enterprise would exist); * That the enterprise was (or would be)
engaged in, or its activities affected (or would affect), interstate or foreign
commerce; and * That each defendant knowingly agreed that a conspirator
would commit a violation of 18 U.S.C. ' 1962(c). The Supreme Court held
that to establish a RICO conspiracy offense under Section 1962(d), there is
no requirement that the defendant 'himself committed or agreed to commit
the two predicate acts requisite for a substantive RICO offense under '
1962(c).'
Summary
The passage explains the elements required to establish a RICO conspiracy
offense, which includes the existence of an enterprise, its engagement in or
effect on interstate commerce, and the knowing agreement of each
defendant that a conspirator would commit a violation. This is relevant to
the question because it provides insight into the legal framework under
which the alleged actions of the judges and other parties could be evaluated
as part of a RICO claim. If the judges were found to be part of a conspiracy
to commit RICO offenses, their actions might fall outside the scope of
judicial immunity, which typically protects judges for acts performed in their
judicial capacity. Additionally, the passage highlights that a defendant does
not need to have committed the predicate acts themselves, which could be
relevant in assessing the involvement of the judges in the alleged
conspiracy.
