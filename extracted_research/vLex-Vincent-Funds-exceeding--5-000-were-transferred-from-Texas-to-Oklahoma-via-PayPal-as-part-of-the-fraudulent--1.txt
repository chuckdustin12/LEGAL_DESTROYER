Question
Funds exceeding $5,000 were transferred from Texas to Oklahoma via
PayPal as part of the fraudulent scheme. 18 U.S.C. § 2314 prohibits the
interstate transportation of stolen, converted, or fraudulently obtained
money or property valued at $5,000 or more. The interstate transfer of
misappropriated marital funds meets the threshold for § 2314, supporting a
RICO predicate act.
Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
The interstate transfer of misappropriated marital funds exceeding $5,000
via PayPal from Texas to Oklahoma satisfies the elements of 18 U.S.C. §
2314, which prohibits the interstate transportation of money valued at
$5,000 or more known to be stolen, converted, or taken by fraud. This
violation of § 2314 can legitimately serve as a predicate act for RICO
purposes.
Summary
Under 18 U.S.C. § 2314, the interstate transportation of stolen, converted, or
fraudulently obtained money or property valued at $5,000 or more is
prohibited. The statute explicitly covers the transmission or transfer of funds
across state lines, and courts have consistently held that electronic
transfers, including wire transfers similar to PayPal transactions, constitute
"transportation" for purposes of the statute. When funds exceeding the
$5,000 threshold are transferred from one state to another with knowledge
that they were obtained through fraud or conversion, all essential elements
of a § 2314 violation are satisfied.
The misappropriation of marital funds, when done with fraudulent intent,
falls within the scope of § 2314 when those funds are transported across
state lines. Federal courts have confirmed that the form of money (cash,
check, wire transfer) is immaterial, and that the essence of the offense is the
interstate movement of fraudulently obtained funds. Since RICO predicate
acts include violations of § 2314, the interstate transfer of misappropriated
marital funds via PayPal that exceeds the $5,000 threshold can properly
serve as a predicate act for RICO purposes, provided all other elements of
the offense are met.

Background and Relevant Law
Federal Statutory Framework
The National Stolen Property Act, specifically 18 U.S.C. § 2314, criminalizes
the interstate transportation of stolen, converted, or fraudulently obtained
money or property. The current version of the statute states: "Whoever
transports, transmits, or transfers in interstate or foreign commerce any
goods, wares, merchandise, securities or money, of the value of $5,000 or
more, knowing the same to have been stolen, converted or taken by fraud...
Shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or
both." 18 U.S.C. § 2314
This statute establishes four essential elements that must be proven for a
violation:
The money or property was stolen, converted, or taken by fraud;
The defendant transported, transmitted, or transferred that property in
interstate or foreign commerce;
At the time of transportation, transmission, or transfer, the defendant
knew the property was stolen, converted, or taken by fraud; and
The value of the property was $5,000 or more.
These elements were clearly articulated in United States v. Merz, Case No.
5:14-cr-32-1 (D. Vt. May 21, 2015), where the court stated: "The essential
elements of a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2314 are: (i) that the goods, wares,
merchandise, securities or money were stolen or converted; (ii) that the
defendant transported, transmitted or transferred the property in interstate
or foreign commerce; (iii) that at the time of the transportation or
transmission, the defendant knew the property was stolen or converted; (iv)
that the value of the property was $5,000 or more."
Electronic Transfers as "Transportation"
A critical legal question concerning the application of § 2314 to cases
involving electronic money transfers is whether such transfers constitute
"transportation" under the statute. Federal courts have consistently
answered this question affirmatively.
In U.S. v. Wright, 791 F.2d 133 (10th Cir. 1986), the Tenth Circuit addressed
"whether the transfer of money from one state to another by wire
constitutes a 'transportation' within the meaning of the National Stolen
Property Act, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2314." The court held that it does, stating: "We
answer the question affirmatively and hold that the government does not
have to prove a physical portage of legal tender as an element of the offense
of interstate transportation of money obtained by fraud." The court further
explained that the ordinary meaning of "transportation" is "to transfer or
convey from one person or place to another," and concluded: "That meaning
unquestionably applies to a transfer of money by wire from one state to
another."

Similarly, in U.S. v. Stack, 853 F.2d 436 (6th Cir. 1988), the court recognized
that wire transfers of credits constitute interstate transportation of
securities for purposes of § 2314. The case involved "causing a security
valued in excess of $5,000 to be transported in interstate commerce, by
means of a wire transfer of credits." The court's inclusion of wire transfers
within § 2314's scope confirms that electronic transmissions of funds across
state lines satisfy the statute's "transportation" requirement.
Form of Money is Immaterial
Courts have also clarified that the form in which money is transferred is
immaterial to the statute's application. In U.S. v. Cardall, 885 F.2d 656 (10th
Cir. 1989), the court explained: "As to the $5,000 or more that must be
involved, the essence of the crime is the movement in interstate commerce
of money taken by fraud. That the money changed form to a check or other
similar type of instrument for convenience in transferring it, is insignificant.
What is significant is that when the transaction is completed, $5,000 or
more of money taken by fraud, exists or may be obtained at the final
destination."
This principle is particularly relevant to modern payment platforms like
PayPal, which facilitate the electronic transfer of funds across state lines
without the physical movement of currency.
Application to Marital Funds
While the provided materials do not specifically address marital funds, the
statute's broad language covers any money "stolen, converted or taken by
fraud." Misappropriated marital funds, when taken through fraud or
conversion, would fall within this scope when transported across state lines.
The application of § 2314 to various types of fraud is illustrated in 
Liquidation Com'n of Banco Intercont. v. Renta, 530 F.3d 1339 (11th Cir.
2008), where the court noted that violations of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2314-15 are "the
most obvious predicate acts" in cases involving "transmission and receipt of
converted funds." The court specifically cited § 2314's prohibition against
transmitting or transferring in interstate or foreign commerce "any... money,
of the value of $5,000 or more, knowing the same to have been stolen,
converted, or taken by fraud."
Connection to RICO Predicate Acts
For a violation of § 2314 to serve as a predicate act under the Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), the violation must be one
of the specified unlawful activities listed in the RICO statute.
The connection between § 2314 violations and RICO predicates is supported
by U.S. v. Capoccia, 503 F.3d 103 (2nd Cir. 2007), which discusses forfeiture
in the context of § 2314 violations. The court referenced 18 U.S.C. § 981(a)
(1)(C), which subjects to civil forfeiture property derived from proceeds
traceable to "any offense constituting 'specified unlawful activity' (as defined

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
in section 1956(c)(7) of this title)." This cross-reference indicates that § 2314
violations qualify as "specified unlawful activity" under RICO.
Further support comes from the secondary source Civil Rico: A Tool of
Advocacy, which explicitly states: "The criminal acts that apply to data theft
are mail fraud, wire fraud, and interstate transportation and receipt of
stolen property, the value of which is $5,000 or more." This directly confirms
that interstate transportation of stolen property valued at $5,000 or more
can serve as a RICO predicate act.
Analysis
Application of § 2314 to PayPal Transfers of Fraudulently
Obtained Marital Funds
Based on the provided materials, the transfer of funds exceeding $5,000
from Texas to Oklahoma via PayPal as part of a fraudulent scheme involving
misappropriated marital funds satisfies all elements required for a violation
of 18 U.S.C. § 2314.
1. Stolen, Converted, or Fraudulently Obtained Money
The scenario describes "misappropriated marital funds," which implies that
the money was either stolen, converted, or obtained through fraud from a
marital estate. Though the precise details of the misappropriation are not
specified, the characterization as "misappropriated" and part of a
"fraudulent scheme" indicates that the money was taken through improper
means that would satisfy the first element of § 2314.
2. Interstate Transportation, Transmission, or Transfer
The funds were transferred from Texas to Oklahoma, which clearly
constitutes interstate commerce. As established in U.S. v. Wright, 791 F.2d
133 (10th Cir. 1986), electronic transfers of funds across state lines qualify
as "transportation" under § 2314. The court explicitly held that "a transfer of
money by wire from one state to another" falls within the statute's scope.
PayPal transfers, like wire transfers, involve the electronic transmission of
funds and therefore satisfy this element.
3. Knowledge that the Money was Stolen, Converted, or Obtained by
Fraud
The scenario describes the transfer as "part of the fraudulent scheme,"
which strongly suggests knowledge that the funds were misappropriated.
For a § 2314 violation, the perpetrator must know that the money was
stolen, converted, or fraudulently obtained at the time of the interstate
transfer. The description of the transfer as part of a "fraudulent scheme"
implies this knowledge.

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
As noted in U.S. v. Stack, 853 F.2d 436 (6th Cir. 1988), the "only element of
the offense for the jury to decide was whether defendant knew the money
was obtained by fraud." The scenario's reference to a "fraudulent scheme"
indicates this knowledge element would likely be satisfied.
4. Value of $5,000 or More
The scenario explicitly states that the funds exceeded $5,000, which meets
the monetary threshold required by § 2314. As explained in Omari v.
Gonzales, 419 F.3d 303 (5th Cir. 2005), the first paragraph of § 2314 applies
to "whoever transports, transmits, or transfers in interstate or foreign
commerce any goods, wares, merchandise, securities or money, of the value
of $5,000 or more, knowing the same to have been stolen, converted or
taken by fraud."
The form in which the money was transferred (via PayPal) is immaterial, as
established in U.S. v. Cardall, 885 F.2d 656 (10th Cir. 1989). What matters is
that "when the transaction is completed, $5,000 or more of money taken by
fraud, exists or may be obtained at the final destination."
PayPal as a Method of Interstate Transportation
PayPal functions as an electronic payment platform that facilitates the
transfer of funds between accounts across state lines. Based on U.S. v.
Wright, 791 F.2d 133 (10th Cir. 1986), such electronic transfers qualify as
"transportation" under § 2314. The court rejected the notion that "physical
portage of legal tender" is required and embraced the ordinary meaning of
transportation as "to transfer or convey from one person or place to
another."
This interpretation is further supported by U.S. v. Williams, 441 F.3d 716
(9th Cir. 2006), which involved the transportation of funds between bank
accounts across national borders. The court recognized that causing such
transportation, even if not directly executing it, falls under § 2314's purview.
By extension, initiating a PayPal transfer of fraudulently obtained funds from
Texas to Oklahoma would similarly constitute a violation of the statute.
Misappropriated Marital Funds in the Context of § 2314
While the provided materials do not specifically address marital funds, the
broad language of § 2314 applies to any money that has been "stolen,
converted or taken by fraud." If one spouse misappropriates marital funds
through fraudulent means or conversion, and then transfers those funds
across state lines, such conduct would fall within § 2314's prohibition.
The Eleventh Circuit's discussion in Liquidation Com'n of Banco Intercont. v.
Renta, 530 F.3d 1339 (11th Cir. 2008) supports this conclusion. The court
recognized that § 2314 prohibits the transmission of converted funds across
state or national boundaries. Marital funds that have been converted or
fraudulently misappropriated by one spouse would logically fall within this
category when transported interstate.

Use as a RICO Predicate Act
For a violation of § 2314 to serve as a predicate act under RICO, it must
qualify as a "specified unlawful activity." The secondary source Civil Rico: A
Tool of Advocacy explicitly confirms that "interstate transportation and
receipt of stolen property, the value of which is $5,000 or more" can serve as
a predicate act for RICO purposes.
This is consistent with THAI AIRWAYS INTERN. v. United Aviation Leasing
BV, 891 F. Supp. 113 (S.D. N.Y. 1994), which recognizes violations of § 2314
as potential "predicate acts" in the RICO context. The court referred to
"transporting converted funds in foreign commerce in violation of 18 U.S.C.
§ 2314" as possible predicate acts, indicating that § 2314 violations involving
interstate or foreign transportation of converted funds can serve as RICO
predicates.
Exceptions and Caveats
Proof Requirements for Fraud or Conversion
While the interstate transfer of misappropriated marital funds via PayPal can
satisfy the elements of § 2314, proving that the funds were actually "stolen,
converted or taken by fraud" requires evidence of fraudulent intent or
unlawful conversion. Not all instances of one spouse transferring marital
funds would necessarily constitute fraud or conversion.
As illustrated in U.S. v. Merz, Case No. 5:14-cr-32-1 (D. Vt. May 21, 2015),
the prosecution must establish that the money was "stolen or converted" as
an essential element of the offense. In cases involving marital funds, this
may require evidence that the spouse lacked authority to transfer the funds
or acted with fraudulent intent.
Jurisdictional Considerations
The application of § 2314 requires that the funds cross state lines. In the
described scenario, the transfer from Texas to Oklahoma clearly satisfies
this requirement. However, if the funds remained within a single state, §
2314 would not apply regardless of the fraudulent nature of the scheme.
Omari v. Gonzales, 419 F.3d 303 (5th Cir. 2005) emphasizes the interstate
commerce requirement by quoting § 2314's prohibition against whoever
"transports, transmits, or transfers in interstate or foreign commerce"
money known to be stolen or fraudulently obtained. The interstate element
is essential to federal jurisdiction under this statute.
RICO Pattern Requirement
While a violation of § 2314 can serve as a RICO predicate act, establishing a
RICO claim requires more than just a single predicate act. RICO typically
requires a "pattern of racketeering activity," which generally means at least

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
two predicate acts within a ten-year period, along with other elements such
as continuity and relationship between the acts.
The provided materials do not address these additional RICO requirements,
which would need to be satisfied for a complete RICO claim based on § 2314
violations.
Conclusion
Based on the provided materials, the interstate transfer of misappropriated
marital funds exceeding $5,000 from Texas to Oklahoma via PayPal as part
of a fraudulent scheme satisfies all elements required for a violation of 18
U.S.C. § 2314. This statute prohibits the transportation, transmission, or
transfer in interstate commerce of money valued at $5,000 or more,
knowing it to have been stolen, converted, or taken by fraud.
Federal courts have consistently held that electronic transfers of funds,
including wire transfers similar to PayPal transactions, constitute
"transportation" under § 2314. The form in which the money is transferred is
immaterial; what matters is that at least $5,000 of fraudulently obtained
money crosses state lines. When marital funds are misappropriated through
fraud or conversion and then transferred across state lines via PayPal, such
conduct falls within § 2314's scope.
Furthermore, violations of § 2314 can serve as predicate acts for RICO
purposes, as confirmed by the provided secondary source and supported by
case law discussing § 2314 violations in the RICO context. Therefore, the
scenario described—where funds exceeding $5,000 were transferred from
Texas to Oklahoma via PayPal as part of a fraudulent scheme involving
misappropriated marital funds—does meet the threshold for a § 2314
violation and can support a RICO predicate act, provided all other elements
of the RICO claim are satisfied.
The analysis supports the proposition that "the interstate transfer of
misappropriated marital funds meets the threshold for § 2314, supporting a
RICO predicate act." However, a complete RICO claim would require
additional elements beyond the scope of the provided materials, including
proof of a pattern of racketeering activity and the relationship of that
pattern to an enterprise.
Legal Authorities
United States v. Merz, Case No. 5:14-cr-32-1 (D. Vt. May 21, 2015)
U.S. District Court — District of Vermont
Extract
The jury found Defendant guilty of the interstate transportation of stolen
money in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2314 which provides: Whoever transports,
transmits, or transfers in interstate or foreign commerce any goods, wares,

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
merchandise, securities or money, of the value of $5,000 or more, knowing
the same to have been stolen, converted or taken by fraud... The essential
elements of a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2314 are: (i) that the goods, wares,
merchandise, securities or money were stolen or converted; (ii) that the
defendant transported, transmitted or transferred the property in interstate
or foreign commerce; (iii) that at the time of the transportation or
transmission, the defendant knew the property was stolen or converted; (iv)
that the value of the property was $5,000 or more.
Summary
18 U.S.C. § 2314 criminalizes the interstate transportation of money or
property valued at $5,000 or more if it is known to be stolen, converted, or
obtained by fraud. The case illustrates the application of this statute,
confirming that the elements required for a violation include the interstate
transfer of such funds with knowledge of their illicit origin. This directly
supports the proposition that the interstate transfer of misappropriated
marital funds exceeding $5,000 could meet the threshold for a § 2314
violation, thus supporting a RICO predicate act.
U.S. v. Wright, 791 F.2d 133 (10th Cir. 1986)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
This appeal also presents the question of whether the transfer of money
from one state to another by wire constitutes a 'transportation' within the
meaning of the National Stolen Property Act, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2314. We
answer the question affirmatively and hold that the government does not
have to prove a physical portage of legal tender as an element of the offense
of interstate transportation of money obtained by fraud... The remaining
issue left to be pursued is whether a transfer of money by wire is a
'transportation' within the meaning of the first subsection of Sec. 2314... The
ordinary meaning of the word is defined as: 'to transfer or convey from one
person or place to another.' Webster's Third New International Dictionary
2430 (1981). That meaning unquestionably applies to a transfer of money by
wire from one state to another.
Summary
The court in "U.S. v. Wright" affirmed that wire transfers of money between
states are considered "transportation" under 18 U.S.C. § 2314. This
interpretation supports the proposition that the interstate transfer of
misappropriated funds via PayPal, which is a form of wire transfer, meets the
threshold for § 2314. The court's decision clarifies that physical movement of
money is not required, and the essence of the offense is the interstate
movement of fraudulently obtained funds.

(S.D. N.Y. 1994)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of New York
Extract
Plaintiff is only partly successful in overcoming the Rule 9(b) threshold for
the predicate acts of transporting converted funds in foreign commerce in
violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2314. This statute provides, in relevant part:
Whoever transports in interstate or foreign commerce any ... money, of the
value of $5,000 or more, knowing the same to have been stolen, converted
or taken by fraud ... shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not
more than ten years, or both.
Summary
Application of 18 U.S.C. § 2314, which criminalizes the transportation of
money valued at $5,000 or more that is known to be stolen, converted, or
obtained by fraud. The case illustrates how this statute can be used as a
predicate act under RICO when funds are transported in foreign commerce
as part of a fraudulent scheme. This supports the proposition that the
interstate transfer of misappropriated funds, such as marital funds, can
meet the threshold for § 2314 and serve as a RICO predicate act.
U.S. v. Williams, 441 F.3d 716 (9th Cir. 2006)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Ninth Circuit
Extract
Count 12 of the superseding indictment charged Defendant with the foreign
transportation of stolen money in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2314. It alleged: On
or about March 21, 2001, in the District of Oregon and elsewhere, defendant
JOHN ANTHONY WILLIAMS, knowingly caused $80,000 to be transported,
transmitted and transferred, from an account at Belize Bank in Belize,
Central America, to an account at Bank of America in Oregon, knowing such
funds were stolen, converted and taken by fraud. ... The first two paragraphs
of 18 U.S.C. § 2314 state: Whoever transports, transmits, or transfers in
interstate or foreign commerce any goods, wares, merchandise, securities or
money, of the value of $5,000 or more, knowing the same to have been
stolen, converted or taken by fraud; or Whoever, having devised or intending
to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or
property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or
promises, transports or causes to be transported, or induces any person or
persons to travel in, or to be transported in interstate or foreign commerce
in the execution or concealment of a scheme or artifice to defraud that
person or those persons of money or property having a value of $ 5,000 or
more[.]

Summary
The passage from "U.S. v. Williams" illustrates the application of 18 U.S.C. §
2314, which criminalizes the transportation of stolen or fraudulently
obtained money across state or international borders when the value
exceeds $5,000. The case demonstrates that causing such transportation,
even if not directly executing it, falls under the statute's purview. This aligns
with the proposition that the interstate transfer of misappropriated marital
funds via PayPal, if exceeding $5,000, would meet the threshold for § 2314
and could support a RICO predicate act.
U.S. v. Capoccia, 503 F.3d 103 (2nd Cir. 2007)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Second Circuit
Extract
The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure require that '[i]f the government
seeks forfeiture of specific property, the court must determine whether the
government has established the requisite nexus between the property and
the offense.' Fed.R.Crim.P. 32.2(b)(1). The 'requisite nexus' for a violation of
18 U.S.C. § 2314 is set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 981(a)(1)(C), which subjects to
civil forfeiture '[a]ny property, real or personal, which constitutes or is
derived from proceeds traceable to a violation of [various sections of Title
18] or any offense constituting "specified unlawful activity" (as defined in
section 1956(c)(7) of this title), or a conspiracy to commit such offense.'
Summary
18 U.S.C. § 2314 prohibits the interstate transportation of stolen or
fraudulently obtained money or property valued at $5,000 or more. The
passage explains the requirement for establishing a nexus between the
property and the offense for forfeiture purposes, which is relevant to
proving a violation of § 2314. This supports the proposition that the
interstate transfer of misappropriated marital funds meets the threshold for
§ 2314, as it involves the transportation of funds obtained through fraud.

U.S. Court of Appeals — Eleventh Circuit
Extract
Although Renta's conduct may have violated other predicate statutes, the
most obvious predicate acts on this record are violations of 18 U.S.C. §§
2314-15, which prohibit transmission and receipt of converted funds,
respectively. Section 2314 provides that 'whoever ... transmits, or transfers

more, knowing the same to have been stolen, converted, or taken by fraud'
commits a felony.
Summary
The passage from the case discusses the application of 18 U.S.C. § 2314,
which criminalizes the interstate transfer of money valued at $5,000 or more
that is known to be stolen, converted, or obtained by fraud. This directly
supports the proposition that the interstate transfer of misappropriated
marital funds exceeding $5,000 via PayPal could meet the threshold for a
violation of § 2314, thus supporting a RICO predicate act.

Extract
Whoever transports in interstate or foreign commerce, any goods, wares,
merchandise, securities or money of the value of $5,000 or more, knowing
the same to have been stolen, converted or taken by fraud, shall commit a
crime. ... Definition of transportation of money taken by fraud. The phrase
transports in interstate commerce, means transporting money from one
state to another. As to the $5,000 or more that must be involved, the essence
of the crime is the movement in interstate commerce of money taken by

instrument for convenience in transferring it, is insignificant. What is
significant is that when the transaction is completed, $5,000 or more of
money taken by fraud, exists or may be obtained at the final destination.
Summary
The form of the money (e.g., check, electronic transfer) is irrelevant as long
as the value threshold is met and the money is transported across state
lines. This supports the proposition that the interstate transfer of
misappropriated marital funds via PayPal, if valued at $5,000 or more, would
meet the criteria for a violation of § 2314 and could serve as a predicate act
for a RICO charge.
U.S. v. Stack, 853 F.2d 436 (6th Cir. 1988)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Sixth Circuit
Extract
Count Three of the indictment charged defendant with causing a security
valued in excess of $5,000 to be transported in interstate commerce, by

=== PAGE 12 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
means of a wire transfer of credits, 'knowing said security to have been
taken by fraud.' It was stipulated that the money received from Gulewicz
and deposited to the TRC account was a security and moved in interstate
commerce. The only element of the offense for the jury to decide was
whether defendant knew the money was obtained by fraud. The jury was
instructed that: Count Three is a different charge and the law applicable to
Count Three provides that whoever transports in interstate commerce
securities or money of a value of $5,000 or more, knowing the same to have
been stolen, embezzled, converted or taken by fraud, shall be guilty of an
offense against the United States.
Summary
18 U.S.C. § 2314 applies to cases where money or securities valued at
$5,000 or more are transported across state lines, knowing they were
obtained by fraud. The case demonstrates that the statute covers wire
transfers of credits as a form of interstate commerce. The passage supports
the proposition by showing that the statute can apply to the interstate
transfer of funds obtained through fraudulent means, which aligns with the
scenario of transferring misappropriated marital funds via PayPal.
Omari v. Gonzales, 419 F.3d 303 (5th Cir. 2005)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
The first five paragraphs of 18 U.S.C. § 2314 set out five alternative ways
that the statute can be violated. The first paragraph describes violation by
'whoever transports, transmits, or transfers in interstate or foreign
commerce any goods, wares, merchandise, securities or money, of the value
of $5,000 or more, knowing the same to have been stolen, converted or
taken by fraud.' 18 U.S.C. § 2314.
Summary
The passage from "Omari v. Gonzales" provides a clear interpretation of 18
U.S.C. § 2314, specifically the first paragraph, which criminalizes the
interstate transportation of money valued at $5,000 or more, knowing it to
have been stolen, converted, or taken by fraud. This directly supports the
proposition that the interstate transfer of misappropriated marital funds via
PayPal, if valued at $5,000 or more, would meet the threshold for a violation
of § 2314. This violation can serve as a predicate act under RICO, as it
involves the transportation of fraudulently obtained funds across state lines.

Extract
Whoever transports, transmits, or transfers in interstate or foreign
commerce any goods, wares, merchandise, securities or money, of the value
of $5,000 or more, knowing the same to have been stolen, converted or
taken by fraud; or... Shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more
than ten years, or both.
Summary
The passage from 18 U.S.C. § 2314 clearly outlines that the interstate
transportation of money valued at $5,000 or more, knowing it to have been
stolen, converted, or taken by fraud, is prohibited. This directly supports the
proposition that the transfer of funds exceeding $5,000 from Texas to
Oklahoma via PayPal, as part of a fraudulent scheme, falls under this
statute. The statute's applicability to interstate commerce and its specific
mention of money and fraudulent schemes align with the scenario described
in the proposition.

Extract
The criminal acts that apply to data theft are mail fraud, wire fraud, and
interstate transportation and receipt of stolen property, the value of which is
$5,000 or more.
Summary
The interstate transportation of stolen property valued at $5,000 or more is
considered a criminal act that can be used as a predicate offense in a RICO
claim. This directly supports the proposition that the interstate transfer of
misappropriated marital funds exceeding $5,000 meets the threshold for §
2314 and can be considered a RICO predicate act.
