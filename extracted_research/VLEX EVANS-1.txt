Statement of the Case Nature of Underlying Proceeding: This original
proceeding arises from a divorce action, No. 322-744263-23, pending in the
322nd District Court of Tarrant County, Texas. The Relator initiated recusal
proceedings under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a, which remain
pending. The issues presented concern the improper handling of those
recusal procedures. Respondent Judge: The Respondent Judge, Honorable
David L. Evans, is the presiding Regional Judge of the 8 th Administrative
Judicial Region of Texas. Respondent’s Challenged Actions: The Respondent
erred when he overruled the Relator's objection requesting that the
mandatory procedures set forth in Rule 18a of the Texas Rules of Civil
Procedure be followed. Further, permitting a judge to file an order of
referral regarding a recusal motion where he was not named introduces
confusion and undermines the purpose of the rule, causes further delays,
and leaves the Relator without an adequate appellate remedy. 7 Statement
of Jurisdiction This Petition for Writ of Mandamus is properly filed in the
Supreme Court of Texas, which possesses original jurisdiction to issue writs
of mandamus against regional presiding judges pursuant to Article V,
Section 3 of the Texas Constitution and Texas Government Code § 22.002(a).
In contrast, the jurisdiction of intermediate appellate courts is governed by
Texas Government Code § 22.221, and the Legislature has not conferred
upon those courts the authority to issue writs of mandamus against regional
presiding judges. This original proceeding is properly presented to this
Honorable Court in the first instance due to the jurisdictional limitations of
the Second Court of Appeals and because three previously filed mandamus
proceedings—arising from the same case and naming the same parties—are
currently pending before this Court under cause numbers 25-0361, 25-0367,
and 25-0378. 8 Issues Presented Issue No. 1: Whether the Respondent
abused his discretion by delegating to a court coordinator duties that Texas
Rule of Civil Procedure 18a(e)(1) expressly assigns to the clerk during
recusal proceedings, leaving the Relator without an adequate appellate
remedy. Issue No. 2: Whether the Respondent further abused his discretion
by permitting a judge not subject to recusal to file an order of referral. 9
Statement of Facts “MR” in this section refers to the mandamus record filed
concurrently with this petition. “APP” refers to the mandamus appendix
attached hereto. On April 23, 2025, in the midst of three concurrent
mandamus proceedings in the Second Court of Appeals1 , the trial court
below, on its’ own initiative, and after several months of silence, sua sponte
moved to set the matter for final trial (MR 1-1.1). The same day, CHARLES
DUSTIN MYERS, (“the Relator”) filed notice with the Second Court of

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Appeals warning that more errors would likely be committed by the trial
court given this sudden decision to move to final trial (MR 2-2.1). The
Relator then objected in the trial court to this setting and reminded the
court that there were three concurrent mandamus proceedings pending in
the Second Court of Appeals (MR 3.1) and named six specific issues that
needed to be resolved before moving to final trial (MR 3.2). The following
day, the Second Court of Appeals issued a per curiam denial regarding
02-25-00166-CV, which is now before this court as cause number 25- 0361
(MR 4-4.1). The Relator then filed a Plea to the Jurisdiction directed to
Honorable James Munford and reiterated several key issues and questioned
the court’s jurisdiction and re-raised constitutional issues (MR 5-5.11). On
April 25, 2025, the Relator filed a Motion to Recuse in the 322nd District
Court seeking to 1 See cause numbers 02-25-00164-CV, 02-25-00166-CV,
02-25-00171-CV 10 recuse the Honorable James Munford (MR 6-6.21) to
protect his rights. The recusal included several exhibits, including the
Notice of Court Proceeding (MR 6.22- 6.24), the current temporary orders in
effect that claim consent yet lack the Relator’s signature (MR. 6.25-6.36),
the prior recusal denial (MR. 6.37-6.39), the agreement to reschedule the
prior recusal proceedings (MR. 6.40-6.44), the correspondence with the
court coordinator for the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County regarding
the un-opposed summary judgement motion filed on February 22, 2024, and
the reinstatement of the Honorable Judges from the prior recusal
proceedings (MR. 6.45-6.50), the initial ruling that divested the Relator of
his home, business, and children without findings (MR 6.51-6.53), and the
Associate Judge’s Report signed by the parties on February 1, 2024 (MR.
6.54-6.60) with specific procedural requirements. Following the submission
of his Motion to Recuse, the Relator received notice from the Real Party in
Interest, Morgan Michelle Myers, that their youngest child had sustained a
dental injury. In response, Relator notified the Second Court of Appeals (MR.
7–7.4) and submitted the same notice to the 322nd District Court, amending
the filing to correct a date reference (MR. 8–8.6). Three days later, Relator
filed a First Amended Motion to Recuse to include the medical event (MR. 9–
9.36) containing a case study (MR 9.54-9.91). He also 11 filed a Notice of
Non-Appearance and submitted an objection to the trial setting (MR. 10–
10.6). On April 29, 2025, letters from the District Judge and the Associate
Judge were filed (MR. 11; MR. 12). Each declined to recuse and referred the
matter to Judge David L. Evans of the 8th Administrative Judicial Region
(MR. 13; APP 3). Relator filed an Objection to the Recusal Procedure, stating
that the motion named only the District Judge and not the Associate Judge,
and challenged the inclusion of the latter and objected to the court
coordinator’s involvement (MR 14). Two days later, the Second Court of
Appeals entered denials in cause numbers 02-25-00166-CV and
02-25-00171-CV per curiam (MR. 15; MR. 16). These matters were then
docketed before this Court as cause numbers 25-0367 and 25-0378 on May
2, 2025, and May 7, 2025. On May 6, 2025, Honorable Judge Evans issued
an Order of Assignment still listing both Honorable Jeff Kaitcer and
Honorable James Munford as respondents (APP 2) and used the 322nd
District Court's coordinator to transmit documents, a method Relator
challenged as improper and filed a second objection (MR. 17). On May 15,
2025, Honorable Judge Evans issued an order denying the Relator’s
objections (APP 1), which led to the drafting of this petition for writ of
mandamus. 12 SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT Texas law assigns the court clerk

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
— not the challenged judge or his personal staff — the duty of transmitting
recusal materials. Rule 18a’s forwarding requirement is statutorily
designated to the clerk of the court where the motion was filed. Allowing a
judge’s court coordinator or personal assistant (a staff member appointed by
the judge) to carry out that delivery would depart from the neutral
procedure envisioned by the rule. A coordinator is a direct appointee of the
judge and serves at his pleasure; having such a person handle a motion
challenging the judge’s own authority undermines the independence of the
process. In other words, the clerk is a neutral custodian of court records,
whereas a coordinator is part of the judge’s office. In the recusal context, it
is far safer to use the clerk (or an independent deputy) to send the papers
on, so that no one can reasonably think the judge is influencing the referral.
Beyond the letter of Rule 18a, Texas’s Code of Judicial Conduct mandates
avoiding not only actual bias but any appearance of impropriety or partiality.
Canon 2(A) provides that a judge “should act at all times in a manner that
promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary”.
In practice this means even the perception of favoritism or undue influence
must be avoided. Here, the Respondent’s order overruling the Relator’s
objection has the opposite effect, constituting an abuse of discretion leaving
the Relator without an appellate remedy. 13 ARGUMENT A. Standard of
Review To obtain relief by writ of mandamus, a relator must establish that
an underlying order is void or a clear abuse of discretion and that no
adequate appellate remedy exists. Walker v. Packer, 827 S.W.2d 833, 839–40
(Tex.1992) (orig. proceeding). An abuse of discretion occurs when a trial
court's ruling is arbitrary and unreasonable, made without regard for
guiding legal principles or supporting evidence. Ford Motor Co. v. Garcia,
363 S.W.3d 573, 578 (Tex.2012). Similarly, a trial court abuses its discretion
when it fails to analyze or apply the law correctly. In re Sw. Bell Tel. Co., 226
S.W.3d 400, 403 (Tex.2007). The Relator submits that the Respondent clearly
abused his discretion by not following the mandatory procedural
requirements of Rule 18a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure which has
undermined the recusal process. B. Government Code § 74.102(b) Does Not
Excuse Noncompliance With Rule 18a The Court Administration Act,
Government Code Chapter 74, sets broad administrative standards but does
not repeal or override other laws. Section 74.102(a) provides that “by local
administrative rule” courts shall designate the duties of court coordinators.
More importantly, 74.101(b) specifies that each coordinator serves “at the
pleasure of the judge who appointed him.” Here, the 14 coordinator in
question serves at the pleasure of the judge subject to recusal. Texas law
implicitly assigns the court clerk — not the challenged judge or his personal
staff — the duty of transmitting recusal materials. Rule 18a’s forwarding
requirement is typically performed by the clerk of the court where the
motion was filed. Allowing a judge’s court coordinator or personal assistant
(a staff member appointed by the judge) to carry out that delivery would
depart from the neutral procedure envisioned by the rule. Because a
coordinator is a direct appointee of the judge and serves at his pleasure -
having such a person handle a motion challenging the judge’s own authority
undermines the independence of the process. In other words, the clerk is a
neutral custodian of court records, whereas a coordinator is part of the
judge’s office. In the recusal context, Rule 18a(e) specifically delineates
duties to the clerk of the court, not the coordinator. In the Respondent’s
order overruling the Relator’s objection, the invocation of 74.102(b) was

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
misplaced (APP 1.1). This section simply reinforces that court coordinators
must work smoothly with judges; it does not allow a coordinator or clerk to
disregard the clear instructions of Rule 18a. Nor does § 74.102(b) itself
confer discretion to the clerk that would override the rule’s requirements.
The only plausible understanding of Section 74.102(b) is that it calls for
cooperation in effectuating rules like 18a, not for deviation from them,
which is what occurred here. In Rio Grande Valley Gas Co., In re, 987 S.W.2d
167 (Tex. App. 1999), the 15 court explicitly stated that recusal motions
must be filed "with the clerk of the court." This further reinforces that the
clerk, not a court coordinator, is the proper recipient of recusal-related
filings. Likewise, in In re Amir-Sharif, NUMBER 13- 19-00573-CV (Tex. App.
Dec 12, 2019), the court stated that the respondent judge "must either: (A)
sign and file with the clerk an order of recusal or disqualification; or (B) sign
and file with the clerk an order referring the motion to the regional
presiding judge." This explicit reference to filing "with the clerk” is directly
supported by rule 18a(e). Here, deviation from these mandatory procedural
requirements has proven to be inefficient and have undermined the recusal
process itself in a case already fraught with procedural abnormalities. C.
The involvement of the coordinator in this instance has proven to be
inefficient and has undermined the integrity of the recusal process By
involving the court coordinator, the straightforward process of recusal has
become ambiguous. Rule 18a(c) of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure makes
clear that the judge’s obligation to address recusal arises only after a motion
is duly filed: the rule commands that if a party “raises a ground requiring
recusal,” then the judge “shall either recuse himself or request the presiding
judge” to take the motion. Here Judge Evans’ order overruling the Relator’s
objection to Honorable Jeff Kaitcer’s involvement but permitting the issue to
be discussed during the recusal proceedings is not only prejudicial, but it
will waste further judicial resources and cause further delay to the relief
being sought. A judge must base 16 decisions on what is actually in the
record. It is apparent on the face of the record and the motion to recuse that
Honorable Jeff Kaitcer was not named in the motion. This implies that the
motion was not properly reviewed, or the trial court is trying to create an
illusion of an adequate appellate remedy to thwart cause number 25- 0361
pending before this court. The only mention of any recusal regarding
Honorable Jeff Kaitcer in the current proceedings was a reference made to
the prior recusal proceedings initiated on October 7, 2024 (See MR.
9.19-9.20). Notably, the court coordinator was involved in those proceedings
as well, which ended up resulting in a four month delay that was only cured
by the Respondent’s diligence in reminding the coordinator that the judges
were not reinstated into the case while opposing parties remained inactive
throughout that critical delay. (MR 8.1) (emphasis added). In essence, the
Respondent’s invocation of 74.102(b) in the order overruling the Relator’s
objection, even if correct, would not effectuate its purpose of ensuring
“uniform and efficient administration of justice in this state” by involving the
court coordinator. Here, inconsistent proceedings have resulted from this
involvement, significant delays have occurred, and now the Relator faces
recusal proceedings wherein a Judge not named in the motion has
inappropriately implicated himself in the proceedings. This error could have
been easily resolved by vacating the order, but it instead has created
unnecessary ambiguity. 17 D. No triggering motion makes Honorable Jeff
Kaitcer’s Order of Referral Erroneous Under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
18a, no recusal procedure is triggered until a valid motion is filed. Once a
recusal motion is filed, the challenged judge must either recuse or
immediately forward the motion to the presiding judge. See In re Norman,
191 S.W.3d 858 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2006, orig. proceeding);
See also In re Stearman, 252 S.W.3d 113 (Tex. App.—Waco 2008, orig.
proceeding). Absent any motion, however, the judge has no authority to
initiate or refer a recusal proceeding. Here, the Relator's motion to recuse
did not seek recusal of Judge Kaitcer, yet the court overruled his objection to
his referral order. In doing so, the court ignored the Rule’s plain text: a
judge may “make no further orders and shall take no further action in the
case after filing of the motion and prior to a hearing on the motion”. Id. The
court’s suggestion that the assigned judge may nonetheless consider the
Relator's admitted non-filing only underscores the error – it treats an unfiled
motion as if it were pending. In re Norman is instructive: under Rule 18a a
judge has “no option” other than to recuse or refer when a motion is
pending. By contrast, here no motion to recuse has been filed regarding the
Associate Judge, so the Honorable Kaitcer’s referral was in error, and the
Respondent had no lawful basis to adjudicate it. For these reasons, the order
was plainly erroneous, and these actions have undermined the recusal
process which is intended to promote public confidence in the judiciary. 18
CONCLUSION In sum, the order overruling Relator’s objection reflects more
than a mere procedural disagreement—it constitutes a refusal to follow the
mandatory directives of Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a. Specifically,
18a(e) vests specific procedural duties in the clerk, not the court
coordinator. (emphasis added) The legislature’s choice of language was
deliberate: Rule 18a(e) assigns responsibility for receiving, managing, and
transmitting recusal motions exclusively to the clerk of the court. Nowhere
does it authorize a judge’s personal appointee—such as a court coordinator
—to assume or interfere with these statutory duties. Here, a motion was
ever filed to recuse Associate Judge Jeff Kaitcer. Yet despite the absence of a
triggering event, Judge Kaitcer issued a referral order under Rule 18a as
though a motion were pending. That referral had no lawful basis, and any
action taken in response—including the overruling of Relator’s objection—is
procedurally void. Rule 18a requires a motion before it imposes any duty or
limitation. Without such a filing, Judge Kaitcer lacked authority to refer the
case, and the assigned judge lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate a nonexistent
motion. By further permitting a judge-appointed coordinator to process
these materials, the trial court not only misapplied the Rule—it overlooked
its core purpose. A coordinator, who serves at the pleasure of the very judge
subject to recusal would arguably create the appearance of impartiality
when performing 19 duties designated to the clerk by statute. For all these
reasons, the trial court abused its discretion in overruling Relator’s
objection. Its order departs from both the plain language and the statutory
design of Rule 18a, introducing confusion, delay, and inconsistency into a
process meant to be clear and impartial. The order should be set aside, and
mandamus granted to preserve the integrity of Texas’s statutory recusal
framework. PRAYER FOR RELIEF WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED,
Relator respectfully prays that this Honorable Court: 1. Issue a writ of
mandamus directing the Respondent to vacate the Order dated May 15,
2025 and Order of Assignment dated May 6, 2025 to preserve the integrity
of the recusal proceedings; 2. Take judicial notice that this is the fourth
concurrent mandamus petition before this Honorable Court seeking

extraordinary relief and take the instant petition into consideration
regarding the adjudication of the other three mandamus petitions; 20 3.
Grant such other and further relief, whether at law or in equity, to which
Relator may be justly entitled, including all relief necessary to ensure
compliance with Rule 18a and the fair administration of justice. Respectfully

Dated May 6, 2025, and the Objection dated April 29, 2025 that were filed
Charles Dustin Myers in the above-entitled cause. Mr. Myers complains of
the court coordinator's involvement in the recusal process. A Court
Coordinator's duties include assisting the administrative judges. See Tex.
Gov't Code Ann. § 74.102(b) which provides as follows: To promote uniform
and efficient administration of justice in this state, the court coordinators
shall cooperate with regional presiding and local administrative judges and
state agencies having duties in the area of the operation of the courts. The
court coordinators and clerks work together to assist the trial judges and
the administrative judges. Only the judges, not the litigants, have the
authority to direct the activities of the court coordinators and clerks. Mr.
Myers' objections regarding the involvement are overruled. Mr. Myers also
objects to the referral by Judge Kaitcer of a motion to recuse (Kaitcer
recusal motion) to the undersigned. This objection is overruled. However,
the judge who hears 4 APP 1.1 the Kaitcer recusal motion may take into
consideration Mr. Myers' claim that he did not file a motion to recuse Judge
Kaitcer. The Court, having considered the objections is of the opinion that
the objections should be DENIED. IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the
Objection to Order of Assignment Dated May 6, 2025 and the Objection filed

the clerk of the court in which the case is pending. The motion: (1) must be
verified; (2) must assert one or more of the grounds listed in Rule 18b; (3)
must not be based solely on the judge's ruling in the case; and (4) must state
with detail and particularity facts that: (A) are within the affiant's personal
knowledge, except that facts may be stated on information and belief if the
basis for that belief is specifically stated; (B) would be admissible in
evidence; and (C) if proven, would be sufficient to justify recusal or
disqualification. (b)Time for Filing Motion. (1) Motion to Recuse. A motion to
recuse:(A) must be filed as soon as practicable after the movant knows of
the ground stated in the motion; and (B) must not be filed after the tenth day
before the date set for trial or other hearing unless, before that day, the
movant neither knew nor reasonably should have known: (i) that the judge
whose recusal is sought would preside at the trial or hearing; or (ii) that the
ground stated in the motion existed. (2) Motion to Disqualify. A motion to
disqualify should be filed as soon as practicable after the movant knows of
the ground stated in the motion. (c)Response to Motion. (1) By Another
Party. Any other party in the case may, but need not, file a response to the
motion. Any response must be filed before the motion is heard. (2) By the
Respondent Judge. The judge whose recusal or disqualification is sought
should not file a response to the motion. (d)Service of Motion or Response. A
party who files a motion or response must serve a copy on every other party.
The method of service must be the same as the method of filing. If possible.
(e)Duty of the Clerk. (1) Delivery of a Motion or Response. When a motion or
response is filed, the clerk of the court must immediately deliver a copy to
the respondent judge and to the presiding judge of the administrative

=== PAGE 12 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
judicial region in which the court is located ( "the regional presiding
judge" ). (2) Delivery of Order of Recusal or Referral. When a respondent

the Respondent Judge; Failure to Comply. (1) Responding to the Motion.
Regardless of whether the motion complies with this rule, the respondent
judge, within three business days after the motion is filed, must either: (A)
sign and May 18, 2025 22:59 2/4APP 8.2 23 file with the clerk an order of

interim or ancillary orders in the pending case as justice may require. (5)
Discovery. Except by order of the regional presiding judge or the judge
assigned to decide the motion, a subpoena or discovery request may not

SOMETHING DEEPER GOING ON HERE
Answer (Texas)
Short response
The Texas Commission on Judicial Conduct is required to investigate the
conduct described because the involvement of a court coordinator in the
recusal process and the denial of motions that were never filed directly
contravene mandatory procedural rules and raise serious concerns about
impartiality and the integrity of the judiciary. Such actions may constitute

=== PAGE 14 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
willful violations of the Texas Code of Judicial Conduct and established law,
thereby triggering the Commission’s statutory duty to conduct a full
investigation.
Summary
The Texas judicial system is governed by strict procedural rules to ensure
impartiality, transparency, and public confidence, especially in matters
involving judicial recusal. When a regional presiding judge allows a court
coordinator—who serves at the pleasure of the judge facing recusal—to
handle recusal materials, or when a judge purports to deny a motion that
was never filed, these actions undermine the neutrality and integrity of the
recusal process and may constitute judicial misconduct.
The Texas Constitution, statutes, and binding case law make clear that such
deviations from established procedure are not merely technical errors but
can amount to willful or persistent violations of the law and the Code of
Judicial Conduct. The Commission on Judicial Conduct is not only authorized
but obligated to investigate credible allegations or appearances of such
misconduct to preserve the integrity of the judiciary and maintain public
trust.
Background and Relevant Law
Legislative and Regulatory Framework
The Texas Constitution, in Article V, Section 1-a, establishes the State
Commission on Judicial Conduct and empowers it to investigate and
discipline judges for willful or persistent violations of rules promulgated by
the Supreme Court of Texas, incompetence, willful violation of the Code of
Judicial Conduct, or conduct that undermines the proper performance of
judicial duties or casts public discredit on the judiciary or the administration
of justice (Tex. Const. art. 5 § 1-a).
Texas Government Code § 33.022 further provides that the Commission may
conduct a preliminary investigation into any allegation or appearance of
judicial misconduct or disability. If the Commission does not find the
allegation unfounded or frivolous, it must conduct a full investigation and
notify the judge involved (Tex. Gov't. Code § 33.022).
The recusal and disqualification of judges in Texas is governed by Texas Rule
of Civil Procedure 18a and related statutes. Rule 18a requires that a motion
to recuse or disqualify a judge must be filed with the clerk of the court, and
upon such filing, the judge must either recuse themselves or refer the
motion to the regional presiding judge within three business days. The rule
assigns specific duties to the court clerk, not to a court coordinator or other
staff member (Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a; Tex. Gov't. Code § 25.00255).
Court coordinators are administrative staff who serve at the pleasure of the
judge who appointed them and whose duties are set by local administrative
rule (Tex. Gov't. Code §§ 74.101, 74.102). Their role is to assist in the

=== PAGE 15 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
efficient administration of justice, not to perform judicial or quasi-judicial
functions, especially in matters where their appointing judge’s impartiality
is at issue.
The Texas Code of Judicial Conduct, Canon 2A, requires judges to comply
with the law and act at all times in a manner that promotes public
confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary.
Case Law
Texas appellate courts have repeatedly held that the procedures set forth in
Rule 18a are mandatory. When a motion to recuse is filed, the judge must
either recuse themselves or refer the motion to the regional presiding judge;
any further action by the judge in the case is void (In re Gold, 04-25-00085-
CV (Tex. App. May 07, 2025); In re Norman, 191 S.W.3d 858 (Tex. App.
2006); In re Amir-Sharif, NUMBER 13-19-00573-CV (Tex. App. Dec 12,
2019)). The duty to process and transmit recusal materials is assigned to the
clerk, not to a court coordinator (In re Alpert, 276 S.W.3d 592 (Tex. App.
2008)).
Moreover, the Texas Supreme Court has made clear that even the
appearance of impropriety or partiality is sufficient to warrant investigation
and possible discipline (In re Inquiry Concerning Honorable Bonnie Rangel
CJC No., 677 S.W.3d 918 (Tex. 2023)). Judges must not only comply with the
law but also maintain professional competence in it, especially regarding
recusal procedures.
If a judge or court staff acts outside the bounds of these mandatory
procedures—such as by involving a court coordinator in the recusal process
or denying a motion that was never filed—such conduct may constitute an
abuse of discretion, a violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct, and a breach
of public trust (In re Burns (2022); In re Stearman, 252 S.W.3d 113 (Tex.
App. 2008)).
Analysis
1. The Role of the Court Coordinator in the Recusal
Process
Rule 18a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure is explicit: the filing,
management, and transmission of recusal motions are the responsibility of
the court clerk, not the court coordinator (Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a(e)). The
rationale is clear—while the clerk is a neutral officer of the court, the
coordinator is a direct appointee of the judge and serves at the judge’s
pleasure (Tex. Gov't. Code § 74.101). Allowing a coordinator to handle
recusal materials, especially when the judge’s impartiality is in question,
creates at least the appearance of impropriety and undermines the
neutrality of the process (In re Alpert, 276 S.W.3d 592 (Tex. App. 2008)).
The Texas Supreme Court has admonished judges for even minor procedural
deviations in recusal matters, emphasizing that strict compliance is

=== PAGE 16 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
necessary to maintain public confidence in the judiciary (In re Inquiry
Concerning Honorable Bonnie Rangel CJC No., 677 S.W.3d 918 (Tex. 2023)).
The involvement of a court coordinator in the recusal process, particularly
when that coordinator is beholden to the judge facing recusal, is
inconsistent with the requirement of impartiality and the avoidance of any
appearance of bias (Tex. Code of Judicial Conduct, Canon 2A).
2. Denial of Motions That Were Never Filed
Rule 18a and its interpreting case law make clear that recusal procedures
are only triggered by the filing of a verified motion with the clerk (Tex. R.
Civ. P. 18a(a); In re Johnson, No. 14-04-00519-CV (Tex. 2004)). If no motion
is filed, there is no basis for the judge to act, and certainly no basis to deny a
nonexistent motion. Any such action is not only procedurally improper but
void (In re Norman, 191 S.W.3d 858 (Tex. App. 2006); In re Gold,
04-25-00085-CV (Tex. App. May 07, 2025)).
The denial of a motion that was never filed is not a mere technical error; it is
a fundamental violation of due process and the rules governing judicial
conduct. It suggests either a lack of competence in the law or a willful
disregard for established procedure, both of which are grounds for
investigation and possible discipline by the Commission (Tex. Const. art. 5 §
1-a; Tex. Gov't. Code § 33.022).
3. The Commission’s Duty to Investigate
The Texas Constitution and Government Code require the Commission on
Judicial Conduct to investigate any credible allegation or appearance of
judicial misconduct (Tex. Const. art. 5 § 1-a; Tex. Gov't. Code § 33.022). The
Commission’s mandate is not limited to clear-cut cases of corruption or
malfeasance; it extends to any conduct that undermines the integrity,
impartiality, or proper administration of justice.
When a regional presiding judge, who is charged with upholding the highest
standards of judicial administration, allows or participates in procedural
irregularities such as those described—namely, the involvement of a court
coordinator in the recusal process and the denial of motions that were never
filed—this raises at least the appearance of misconduct. The Commission is
therefore obligated to conduct a preliminary investigation, and if the
allegations are not found to be unfounded or frivolous, to proceed with a full
investigation and notify the judge involved (Tex. Gov't. Code § 33.022).
4. Public Confidence and the Appearance of Impropriety
The Texas Code of Judicial Conduct, Canon 2A, requires judges to act at all
times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and
impartiality of the judiciary. The Texas Supreme Court has repeatedly
emphasized that even the appearance of impropriety is sufficient to warrant
investigation and possible discipline (In re Inquiry Concerning Honorable
Bonnie Rangel CJC No., 677 S.W.3d 918 (Tex. 2023)). The involvement of a
court coordinator in the recusal process, especially when that coordinator is

=== PAGE 17 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
directly answerable to the judge facing recusal, creates a clear appearance
of impropriety and undermines public trust.
Similarly, the denial of motions that were never filed is not only procedurally
improper but also creates the appearance that the judicial process is being
manipulated or that the rules are not being followed. This is precisely the
type of conduct that the Commission is charged with investigating to
preserve the integrity of the judiciary (In re Rose, 144 S.W.3d 661 (Tex.
2004)).
5. The Broader Context: Potential for Deeper Issues
The facts presented suggest not isolated procedural errors but a pattern of
disregard for mandatory rules and the appearance of impartiality. When
such conduct is repeated or involves high-ranking judicial officers, it raises
the possibility of systemic issues that go beyond individual mistakes. The
Commission on Judicial Conduct is specifically empowered to investigate not
only actual misconduct but also the appearance of misconduct or disability
(Tex. Gov't. Code § 33.022).
Failure to investigate such matters would itself undermine public confidence
in the judiciary and the effectiveness of the Commission as a guardian of
judicial integrity.
Exceptions and Caveats
It is important to note that the Commission is not required to investigate
allegations that are clearly unfounded or frivolous. However, the facts
described here—namely, the involvement of a court coordinator in the
recusal process and the denial of motions that were never filed—are not
trivial or technical errors but go to the heart of judicial impartiality and
procedural integrity. The mandatory nature of the rules involved and the
clear case law interpreting them leave little room for discretion in this
context.
Additionally, while the Commission does not have the power to reverse
judicial decisions, it does have the authority to investigate and discipline
judges for violations of law or the Code of Judicial Conduct (Tex. Gov't. Code
§ 33.002).
Conclusion
The Texas Commission on Judicial Conduct is required by law to investigate
credible allegations or appearances of judicial misconduct, especially when
they involve violations of mandatory procedural rules designed to ensure
impartiality and public confidence in the judiciary. The involvement of a
court coordinator in the recusal process and the denial of motions that were
never filed are clear violations of established law and the Code of Judicial
Conduct. These actions undermine the integrity of the judicial process and
create at least the appearance of impropriety, triggering the Commission’s

duty to investigate and, if warranted, to take disciplinary action. Failure to
do so would erode public trust in the judiciary and the rule of law.

In re Johnson, No. 14-04-00519-CV (TX 7/15/2004) (Tex. 2004)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
Because the procedural requirements in Rule 18a are mandatory, a party
who fails to conform to the requirements waives his right to complain of a
judge's failure to recuse himself. ... Thus, the provisions of the rule
obligating the trial judge either to recuse himself or refer the motion to the
presiding judge of the administrative judicial district never arise unless and
until a formal timely, written and verified motion to recuse is filed.
Summary
The procedural requirements of Rule 18a are mandatory. This means that for
a recusal motion to be considered, it must be formally, timely, written, and
verified. If these requirements are not met, the judge is not obligated to
recuse themselves or refer the motion. This underscores the importance of
following proper procedures in recusal matters.

Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a(f)(1) governs the duties of the respondent
judge when a party files a motion to recuse. See TEX. R. CIV. P. 18a(f)(1).
This rule states that: '[r]egardless of whether the motion complies with this
rule, the respondent judge, within three business days after the motion is
filed, must either: (A) sign and file with the clerk an order of recusal or
disqualification; or (B) sign and file with the clerk an order referring the
motion to the regional presiding judge.' ... Under Rule 18a(f)'s 'clear terms,'
when a party files a motion to recuse, the judge must either grant or refer
the motion without regard to whether the motion meets the rule's technical
requirements. ... Rule 18a's recusal-or-referral requirement is mandatory,
and mandamus relief is appropriate to compel compliance with the rule.
Summary
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a(f)(1) mandates that a judge must either
recuse themselves or refer the motion to the regional presiding judge within
three business days of a motion to recuse being filed. This requirement is

=== PAGE 19 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
mandatory, and failure to comply can be addressed through mandamus
relief. The involvement of a court coordinator in the recusal process,
especially if it leads to procedural errors or delays, undermines the integrity
of the process. Additionally, denying motions that were never filed is a clear
procedural error that violates the mandatory nature of Rule 18a.

Summary
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a outlines specific procedural requirements
for the recusal of judges. This includes the requirement for a judge to enter
an order of recusal and request the presiding judge of the administrative
judicial district to assign another judge to the case. The involvement of a
court coordinator in this process, especially if it deviates from the
prescribed procedure, could undermine the integrity of the recusal process.
Additionally, the denial of motions that were never filed contradicts the
procedural requirements and could indicate a deeper issue that warrants
investigation.
In re Thompson., 330 S.W.3d 411 (Tex. App. 2010)

Rule 18a imposes certain mandatory requirements on a judge once a motion
to recuse is filed: (c) Prior to any further proceedings in the case, the judge
shall either recuse himself or request the presiding judge of the
administrative judicial district to assign a judge to hear such motion. If the
judge recuses himself, he shall enter an order of recusal and request the
presiding judge of the administrative judicial district to assign another judge
to sit, and shall make no further orders and shall take no further action in
the case except for good cause stated in the order in which such action is
taken. (d) If the judge declines to recuse himself, he shall forward to the
presiding judge of the administrative judicial district, in either original form

or certified copy, an order of referral, the motion, and all opposing and
concurring statements. Except for good cause stated in the order in which
further action is taken, the judge shall make no further orders and shall take
no further action in the case after filing of the motion and prior to a hearing
on the motion.
Summary
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a sets forth specific mandatory procedures
that must be followed when a motion to recuse a judge is filed. These
procedures include the requirement for the judge to either recuse
themselves or refer the motion to the presiding judge of the administrative
judicial district. The rule also specifies that the judge must take no further
action in the case until the motion is resolved. The involvement of a court
coordinator in this process, especially if they are part of the judge's staff,
could undermine the neutrality and integrity of the recusal process.
Additionally, denying motions that were never filed violates the procedural
requirements and could indicate deeper issues within the judicial process.
In re PG & E Reata Energy, et al, 4 S.W.3d 897 (Tex. App. 1999)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Recusal is governed by Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a, which requires
the judge against whom a proper recusal motion is filed to either grant the
motion or request the Presiding Judge to assign another judge to hear the
motion. TEX. R. CIV. P. 18a(c); see also TEX. GOV'T CODE ANN. 74.059(c)(3)
(Vernon 1998) (providing for requested assignment by the presiding judge).
The purpose of a recusal motion under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a is
to insure that all litigants have the opportunity to have an impartial judge
preside over their case. ... We held in In re Rio Grande Valley Gas that Judge
Gonzalez's transfer of the Recusal Cases was void because after a motion to
recuse has been filed, a judge must either recuse himself or herself or
request the presiding judge to assign a judge to hear the recusal motion
'prior to any further proceedings in the case.' See TEX. R. CIV. P. 18a(c); In
re Rio Grande Valley Gas, 987 S.W.2d at 179 (emphasis in original).
Summary
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a mandates that when a recusal motion is
filed, the judge must either recuse themselves or request the presiding
judge to assign another judge to hear the motion. This ensures impartiality
in judicial proceedings. The passage highlights that any action taken by a
judge after a recusal motion is filed, without following these procedures, is
void. This underscores the importance of adhering to procedural rules to
maintain the integrity of the judicial process.

In re Stearman, 252 S.W.3d 113 (Tex. App. 2008)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Once a recusal motion is filed, a trial judge generally has two options: (1)
recuse himself/herself; or (2) forward the motion to the presiding judge and
request the assignment of another judge to hear the motion. See id. 18a(c),
(d); TEX. GOV'T CODE ANN. § 74.059(c)(3) (Vernon 2005); In re A.R., 236

858, 860 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2006, orig. proceeding). However,
the judge may make 'further orders' while the recusal motion is pending 'for
good cause stated in the order.' TEX.R. CIV. P. 18a(d).
Summary
Once a recusal motion is filed, the judge has limited options and must either
recuse themselves or forward the motion to the presiding judge. The judge
is restricted from taking further action in the case unless there is "good
cause" stated in the order. This ensures that the recusal process is handled
impartially and without undue influence from the judge facing recusal. The
involvement of a court coordinator, who serves at the pleasure of the judge,
could undermine the neutrality of the process. Additionally, denying motions
that were never filed contradicts the procedural requirements, suggesting a
potential abuse of discretion or procedural irregularity that warrants
investigation.

Next, along came the adoption of Rule 18a, Texas Rules of Civil Procedure,
which was added by order of June 10, 1980, eff. Jan. 1, 1981. It was later
amended by order of December 15, 1983, eff. April 1, 1984. This rule as
originally written applied only to district courts. Rule 18a now provides: ...
(c) Prior to any further proceedings in the case, the judge shall either recuse
himself or request the presiding judge of the administrative judicial district
to assign a judge to hear such motion. If the judge recuses himself, he shall
enter an order of recusal and request the presiding judge of the

Summary
Rule 18a outlines specific procedures that must be followed when a motion
to recuse a judge is filed. The rule mandates that the judge in question must
either recuse themselves or refer the motion to the presiding judge of the
administrative judicial district. The judge is not to take any further action in
the case until the motion is resolved. This ensures impartiality and prevents
any appearance of bias or impropriety. The involvement of a court
coordinator, who serves at the pleasure of the judge facing recusal, could
undermine the neutrality of the process. Additionally, denying motions that
were never filed contradicts the procedural requirements and could indicate
deeper issues within the judicial process.
In re Norman, 191 S.W.3d 858 (Tex. App. 2006)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a, Judge Austin had a mandatory
duty either to recuse himself or to refer the recusal motion to the presiding
judge. TEX.R. CIV. P. 18a. Furthermore, section 74.059(c)(3) of the
Government Code states that a district, statutory probate, or statutory
county court judge shall 'request the presiding judge to assign another judge
to hear a motion relating to the recusal of the judge from a case pending in
his court.' TEX. GOV'T CODE ANN. § 74.059(c)(3) (Vernon 2005). Judge
Austin did not have the option of denying the motion... Furthermore, Judge
Austin was not free to ignore the statutory duty to either recuse or refer the
motion to recuse him and instead deny it, and then rule on the motion to
recuse Judge Wood. Once the motion to recuse Judge Austin was filed, Judge
Austin was precluded from taking any further action other than issuing an
order of recusal of himself or an order of referral to the presiding judge. See
TEX.R. CIV. P. 18a. If a judge fails to comply with the rules governing
motions for recusal, all subsequent actions by the judge in that case are
void.
Summary
The passage highlights the mandatory nature of the duties imposed by Texas
Rule of Civil Procedure 18a on judges when a recusal motion is filed.
Specifically, a judge must either recuse themselves or refer the motion to the
presiding judge. The passage also emphasizes that any actions taken by a
judge after a recusal motion is filed, other than recusal or referral, are void.
This underscores the importance of adhering to procedural rules to maintain
the integrity of the judicial process.

Relators contend that Judge Gonzalez abused his discretion in transferring
the cases for three reasons. First, the relators argue the transfer violates the
mandatory procedures set forth in rule 18a, which provides generally, that
following the filing of a motion to recuse, and prior to any further
proceedings, the judge shall either recuse himself or request the presiding
judge of the administrative judicial district to assign a judge to hear the
motion. TEX.R.CIV.P. 18a. (Vernon Supp.1998)... Rule 18a(c) requires a judge
to either recuse himself or request the presiding judge to assign a judge to
hear a recusal motion 'prior to any further proceedings in the case.'
TEX.R.CIV.P. 18a(c) (Emphasis supplied).
Summary
Rule 18a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure mandates specific procedures
when a motion to recuse is filed. The judge must either recuse themselves or
request the presiding judge to assign another judge to hear the motion
before any further proceedings. This rule is designed to ensure impartiality
and prevent any appearance of bias or impropriety. The involvement of a
court coordinator, who serves at the pleasure of the judge facing recusal,
could undermine the neutrality of the process. Additionally, denying motions
that were never filed violates the procedural requirements and could

Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Relators assert that respondent Judge Medary abused her discretion by
denying relators' motion to recuse Judge Vasquez where 'there was
uncontroverted evidence of 'judge shopping'' by plaintiffs' counsel 'through
manipulation of the random assignment procedures.' Relators filed their
motion to recuse Judge Vasquez on December 4, 2018. Relators argued that
they discovered, during the pendency of the lawsuit, that plaintiffs' counsel
had filed a series of 'bogus' lawsuits before 'selecting' Judge Vasquez's court
to litigate the underlying case, and they argued that Judge Vasquez should
be recused as a result of the plaintiffs' alleged forum shopping. Relators
asserted that recusal is warranted in cases involving alleged forum shopping
because 'the judge's impartiality might reasonably be questioned.'

Summary
The Texas Court of Appeals has addressed issues related to judge shopping
and manipulation of court procedures, which can undermine the integrity of
the judicial process. The passage highlights the importance of addressing
such allegations to maintain public confidence in the judiciary. The
involvement of a court coordinator in the recusal process and the denial of
motions that were never filed could similarly undermine the integrity of the
judicial process and raise questions about impartiality.

Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Mandamus is an extraordinary remedy. In re Sw. Bell Tel. Co., L.P., 235 S.W.
3d 619, 623 (Tex. 2007) (orig. proceeding). A writ of mandamus will issue
only when the relator has no adequate remedy by appeal and the trial court
committed a clear abuse of discretion. In re Cerberus Capital Mgmt., L.P.,
164 S.W.3d 379, 382 (Tex. 2005) (orig. proceeding). The relator has the
burden of establishing both prerequisites. In re Fitzgerald, 429 S.W.3d 886,
891 (Tex. App.-Tyler 2014, orig. proceeding.). A respondent judge, within
three business days after a motion to recuse is filed, must sign and file with
the clerk (1) an order of recusal or disqualification; or (2) an order referring
the motion to the regional presiding judge. Tex.R.Civ.P. 18a(f). 'An order
denying a motion to recuse may be reviewed only for abuse of discretion on
appeal from the final judgment.' Tex.R.Civ.P. 18a(j)(1)(A). But 'mandamus
relief is available when a judge violates a mandatory statutory duty either to
recuse or refer a motion to recuse.' In re Norman, 191 S.W.3d 858, 860 (Tex.
App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2006, orig. proceeding); see In re Runnels, No.
06-19-00061-CV, 2019 WL 3366793, at *1 (Tex. App.-Texarkana July 26,
2019, orig. proceeding) (mem. op.).
Summary
A writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy used when there is no
adequate remedy by appeal and when a trial court has committed a clear
abuse of discretion. The passage also highlights that a judge has a
mandatory statutory duty to either recuse themselves or refer a motion to
recuse to the regional presiding judge within three business days of the
motion being filed. If this duty is violated, mandamus relief is available. This
is relevant to the question because it underscores the importance of
following procedural rules in recusal matters and suggests that any
deviation from these rules, such as involving a court coordinator improperly
or denying motions that were never filed, could constitute an abuse of
discretion warranting investigation.

In re Inquiry Concerning Honorable Bonnie Rangel CJC No., 677 S.W.3d 918
(Tex. 2023)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
The 'public admonition' arose from a single instance of Judge Rangel filing a
written response to a motion seeking her recusal from a particular case.
Underlying the determination was the rule of procedure stating that a jurist
subject to such a motion 'should not file a response' to it. TEX. R. CIV. PROC.
18a(c)(2). According to the Commission, the mere fact that Judge Rangel
filed a response meant she failed to comport and maintain competence in
the law, thereby violating 'Canons 2A and 3B(2) of the Texas Code of Judicial
Conduct.' ... Canon 2A states that: a 'judge shall comply with the law ....' Per
Canon 3B(2), a jurist also 'shall maintain professional competence in' the
law. Of the myriad laws we 'shall comply with' and 'should maintain
professional competence in' is that establishing the procedures to be
followed when a litigant attempts to recuse a trial judge. Those procedures
appear in Rule 18a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure.
Summary
The passage highlights the importance of judges adhering to procedural
rules, specifically Rule 18a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, which
governs the recusal process. It emphasizes that judges must not only comply
with the law but also maintain professional competence in it. The failure to
adhere to these rules can result in sanctions, as seen in the case of Judge
Rangel. This underscores the necessity for the Texas Commission on Judicial
Conduct to investigate any deviations from these procedures, such as the
involvement of a court coordinator in the recusal process or the denial of
motions that were never filed, as these actions could undermine the
integrity of the judicial process.

Procedure provide that a judge shall recuse himself in any proceeding in
which 'his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.' Tex. R. Civ. P. 18b(2)
(a). ... The test for abuse of discretion is not whether in the opinion of the

Summary
The Texas Rules of Civil Procedure require that when a motion to recuse is
filed, the judge must either recuse themselves or have the motion heard by
another judge. The rules also state that a judge should recuse themselves if
their impartiality might reasonably be questioned. The involvement of a
court coordinator, who serves at the pleasure of the judge, in the recusal
process could undermine the impartiality and integrity of the process.
Additionally, denying motions that were never filed is contrary to the
procedural requirements and could indicate an abuse of discretion. These
actions could reasonably lead to questions about the judge's impartiality and
adherence to procedural rules, warranting an investigation by the Texas
Commission on Judicial Conduct.
Ex parte Thuesen, 546 S.W.3d 145 (Tex. Crim. App. 2017)
Texas Court of Criminal Appeals
Extract
The manner in which our judicial system handles the recusal of judges
affects public confidence in the judiciary, as it goes to the 'very heart of the
promise of impartiality.' ... Rule 18a sets out the procedures to be followed
when a party moves to recuse a trial judge. ... The mere existence of a
ground for recusal of a judge does not in itself void or nullify subsequent
proceedings before that judge; the ground can be waived if not raised by
proper motion. ... The Dallas court concluded that a 'fair reading of rules
18a and 18b suggests that[,] in the event a judge should elect to recuse
himself ..., two things are required: (1) an order of recusal, and (2) a request
to the administrative judge of the district to assign another judge to sit.' ...
Further, twenty years after the Dallas court decided Dunn, the Texas
Legislature passed Section 24.002 of the Texas Government Code providing
the procedure that must be followed when a district judge voluntarily
recuses himself: If a district judge determines on the judge's own motion
that the judge should not sit in a case pending in the judge's court because
the judge is disqualified or otherwise should recuse himself or herself, the
judge shall enter a recusal order, request the presiding judge of that
administrative judicial region to assign another judge to sit, and take no
further action in the case except for good cause stated in the order in which
the action is taken.
Summary
The recusal process is critical to maintaining public confidence in the
judiciary, as it ensures impartiality. Rule 18a outlines the procedures for
recusal, emphasizing that a judge must either recuse themselves or refer the
motion to the presiding judge. The involvement of a court coordinator, who
serves at the pleasure of the judge facing recusal, could undermine the
impartiality of the process. Additionally, the denial of motions that were
never filed contradicts the procedural requirements, as a motion must be

properly filed to trigger recusal procedures. The Texas Legislature has
provided specific procedures for voluntary recusal, emphasizing that a judge
should take no further action in the case except for good cause. These
principles highlight the importance of adhering to established procedures to
ensure fairness and impartiality.
Ludlow v. DeBerry, 959 S.W.2d 265 (Tex. App. 1997)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
TEX.CODE OF JUDICIAL CONDUCT, Canon 8, pt. A (1994). Thus, a judge
may be disciplined for violating one of these rules, but a violation does not
necessarily mean that the judge should be recused... A judge must also
perform his judicial duties without bias or prejudice. TEX.CODE OF
JUDICIAL CONDUCT, Canon 3A(9) (1989) (amended 1992, 1994)... Although
a number of the directives in Canon 3 are mandatory and assist in
determining when a trial judge's impartiality may reasonably be questioned,
the determination whether to grant or deny a recusal motion, regardless of
the ground asserted, is within the discretion of the judge assigned to hear
the motion and this determination must stand unless the assigned judge
abused his discretion. See TEX.R. CIV. P. 18a(f).
Summary
The Texas Code of Judicial Conduct provides guidelines for judicial behavior,
including the requirement for judges to perform duties without bias or
prejudice. The Code also outlines that a judge may be disciplined for
violations, and the decision to grant or deny a recusal motion is at the
discretion of the judge assigned to hear it, unless there is an abuse of
discretion. This implies that any deviation from these standards, such as
involving a court coordinator inappropriately or denying motions that were
never filed, could be seen as an abuse of discretion or a violation of the
Code, warranting investigation.

2006, orig. proceeding) ('If a judge fails to comply with the rules governing
motions for recusal, all subsequent actions by the judge in that case are
void.').
Summary
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a mandates specific actions when a motion
to recuse is filed. The judge must either recuse themselves or refer the
motion to the regional presiding judge. Any failure to comply with these
requirements renders subsequent judicial actions void. This rule ensures the
integrity and impartiality of the judicial process by preventing judges from
taking further actions in cases where their impartiality is questioned.
Duffey v. State, 428 S.W.3d 319 (Tex. App. 2014)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
A motion to recuse a judge 'must assert one or more of the grounds listed in
Rule 18b.' Tex.R. Civ. P. 18a(a)(2). Among other things, a judge must be
recused in any proceeding in which 'the judge's impartiality might
reasonably be questioned,' Tex.R. Civ. P. 18b(b)(1), or the judge 'has a
personal bias or prejudice concerning the subject matter or a party; ... [or]
personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts concerning the
proceedings,' Tex.R. Civ. P. 18b(b)(2). A motion to recuse seeks to prevent a
judge from hearing a case because of a nonconstitutional reason. Even if a
motion to recuse is procedurally defective, he must refer the motion so
another judge can determine the merits of the motion to recuse if the judge
does not then voluntarily recuse himself.
Summary
The passage highlights the importance of following procedural rules for
recusal to ensure impartiality and fairness in judicial proceedings. It
emphasizes that even if a motion to recuse is procedurally defective, it must
be referred to another judge for determination. This underscores the
necessity for the Texas Commission on Judicial Conduct to investigate any
deviations from these procedures, such as the involvement of a court
coordinator in the recusal process or the denial of motions that were never
filed, as these actions could undermine the integrity of the judicial process.

Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Rule 18a(f) expressly confers the authority to reassign a case following a
recusal to the regional presiding judge of the administrative judicial
district... Both the Texas Government Code and Texas Rules of Civil
Procedure vest the 'presiding judge of the administrative judicial district'
with the authority to assign a judge to hear a motion for recusal. TEX. GOV'T
CODE ANN. § 25.00255; TEX.R. CIV. P. 18a.
Summary
The authority to handle recusal motions and assign judges is explicitly
vested in the regional presiding judge of the administrative judicial district.
This authority is not to be delegated to court coordinators or other staff
members. The involvement of a court coordinator in the recusal process,
especially when it involves actions like denying motions that were never
filed, undermines the procedural integrity and could be seen as a deviation
from the established legal framework. This deviation could warrant an
investigation by the Texas Commission on Judicial Conduct to ensure
compliance with the law and maintain public confidence in the judiciary.
Gaal v. State , 332 S.W.3d 448 (Tex. Crim. App. 2011)
Texas Court of Criminal Appeals
Extract
A Texas judge may be removed from presiding over a case for one of three
reasons: he is constitutionally disqualified; he is subject to a statutory strike;
or, he is subject to statutory disqualification or recusal under Texas Supreme
Court rules. 'Generally, a motion to recuse seeks to prevent a judge from
hearing a case because of a nonconstitutional reason, while grounds for
disqualification are limited to those identified in the constitution.' Rule
18b(2) of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure sets out the law concerning
recusal and includes instances in which a judge must step down from
hearing a case for reasons other than the disqualifying grounds listed in the
constitution.
Summary
The recusal of a judge in Texas is governed by specific rules, including Rule
18b(2) of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. This rule outlines the
circumstances under which a judge must recuse themselves, which includes
non-constitutional reasons. The involvement of a court coordinator in the

=== PAGE 30 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
recusal process, especially when it deviates from the prescribed procedures,
could undermine the integrity of the process. Additionally, the denial of
motions that were never filed raises concerns about procedural fairness and
adherence to the rules. These issues could warrant an investigation by the
Texas Commission on Judicial Conduct to ensure that the judicial process is
conducted fairly and in accordance with established rules.
Kniatt v. State, 239 S.W.3d 910 (Tex. App. 2007)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
A recusal decision should not be reversed if it is within the zone of
reasonable disagreement. ... A trial court abuses its discretion when it acts
arbitrarily and unreasonably, without reference to guiding rules or
principles, or when it misapplies the law to the established facts of the
case. ... Rule 18b(2)(a) plainly states that a 'judge shall recuse himself in any
proceeding in which... his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.'
TEX.R. CIV. P. 18b(2)(a). Texas cases almost unanimously state the following
reasonable-person test for questioned impartiality: 'In determining whether
a judge's impartiality might be reasonably questioned so as to require
recusal, the proper inquiry is whether a reasonable member of the public at
large, knowing all the facts in the public domain concerning the judge and
the case, would have a reasonable doubt that the judge is actually impartial.'
Summary
The passage highlights the importance of impartiality in judicial proceedings
and the conditions under which a judge should recuse themselves. It
emphasizes that a judge's impartiality might be reasonably questioned if a
reasonable person, knowing all the facts, would doubt the judge's
impartiality. This is relevant to the question because involving a court
coordinator in the recusal process, especially one appointed by the judge
facing recusal, could reasonably lead to questions about impartiality.
Additionally, denying motions that were never filed could be seen as
arbitrary and unreasonable, potentially constituting an abuse of discretion.
Mosley v. State, 141 S.W.3d 816 (Tex. App. 2004)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
A motion to recuse seeks to prevent a judge from hearing a case because of
a nonconstitutional reason. Even if a motion to recuse is procedurally
defective, the challenged judge must either grant the motion or refer the
motion, so another judge can determine the merits of the motion to

=== PAGE 31 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
recuse. ... Rule 18a requires that, if a judge recuses himself or herself, the
judge 'shall make no further orders and shall take no further action in the
case except for good cause stated in the order in which such action is
taken.' ... A judge shall recuse himself or herself in any proceeding in which
the judge's 'impartiality might reasonably be questioned.' TEX.R. CIV. P.
18b(2)(a).
Summary
The Texas Rules of Civil Procedure require that a judge must either recuse
themselves or refer the motion to another judge for determination. This
ensures that the process is impartial and that the judge whose impartiality is
questioned does not continue to act in the case. The involvement of a court
coordinator, who serves at the pleasure of the judge, in the recusal process
could undermine the impartiality and integrity of the process. Additionally,
denying motions that were never filed contradicts the procedural
requirements and could indicate a deeper issue of judicial misconduct or
procedural irregularity.
In re Rose, 144 S.W.3d 661 (Tex. 2004)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
After such investigation as it deems necessary, the Commission may in its
discretion issue a private or public admonition, warning, reprimand, or
requirement that the judge obtain additional training or education. Tex.
Const. art. V, § 1-a(8); see Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 33.001(a)(10). Such [a]
sanction is remedial in nature. It is issued prior to the institution of formal
proceedings to deter similar misconduct by a judge or judges in the future,
to promote proper administration of justice, and to reassure the public that
the judicial system of this state neither permits nor condones misconduct.
Summary
The Texas Commission on Judicial Conduct has the authority to investigate
judicial misconduct and issue sanctions to deter similar behavior in the
future. The involvement of a court coordinator in the recusal process and
the denial of motions that were never filed could be seen as misconduct that
undermines the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary. The Commission's
role is to ensure that such actions do not occur and to maintain public
confidence in the judicial system.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
To promote uniform and efficient administration of justice in this state, the
court coordinators shall cooperate with regional presiding and local
administrative judges and state agencies having duties in the area of the
operation of the courts.
Summary
Court coordinators are expected to cooperate with regional presiding and
local administrative judges to promote the efficient administration of justice.
This implies that their role is supportive and administrative, rather than
judicial. The involvement of a court coordinator in the recusal process,
especially when the judge they serve is the subject of the recusal, could
potentially compromise the neutrality and integrity of the process. This is
because the court coordinator serves at the pleasure of the judge, which
could lead to a conflict of interest or the appearance of impropriety. The
passage suggests that the duties of court coordinators are meant to support
the judicial process, not to influence or interfere with it.
Tex. Gov't. Code § 74.101 Tex. Gov't. Code § 74.101 Court Coordinators
Extract
The local administrative judge and each district or statutory county court
judge may establish a court coordinator system and appoint a court
coordinator for his court to improve justice and expedite the processing of
cases through the courts. Each court coordinator serves at the pleasure of
the judge who appointed him.
Summary
Authority of judges to appoint court coordinators to improve justice and
expedite case processing. It also specifies that court coordinators serve at
the pleasure of the appointing judge, indicating a direct line of authority and
potential influence. This is relevant to the question because it highlights the
potential conflict of interest when a court coordinator, who serves at the
pleasure of a judge facing recusal, is involved in the recusal process. This
could undermine the impartiality and integrity of the judicial process, which
is a concern for the Texas Commission on Judicial Conduct.
Tex. Gov't. Code § 33.002 Tex. Gov't. Code § 33.002 Commission
Extract
The State Commission on Judicial Conduct is established under Section 5 1-
a, Article V, Texas Constitution, and has the powers provided by that section.

=== PAGE 33 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
The commission is an agency of the judicial branch of state government and
administers judicial discipline. The commission does not have the power or
authority of a court in this state.
Summary
The State Commission on Judicial Conduct is responsible for administering
judicial discipline. This implies that the commission has the authority to
investigate matters related to judicial conduct, including potential
misconduct or procedural irregularities involving judges and court
personnel. The involvement of a court coordinator in a recusal process and
the denial of motions that were never filed could be seen as procedural
irregularities or misconduct, which fall under the purview of the
commission's responsibilities.

Removal, and Compensation of Justices and Judges; State Commission On
Judicial Conduct; Procedure
Extract
Any Justice or Judge of the courts established by this Constitution or created
by the Legislature as provided in Section 1, Article V, of this Constitution,
may, subject to the other provisions hereof, be removed from office for
willful or persistent violation of rules promulgated by the Supreme Court of
Texas, incompetence in performing the duties of the office, willful violation
of the Code of Judicial Conduct, or willful or persistent conduct that is
clearly inconsistent with the proper performance of his duties or casts public
discredit upon the judiciary or administration of justice.
Summary
The Texas Commission on Judicial Conduct has the authority to investigate
and potentially remove or discipline judges for willful violations of judicial
rules or conduct that undermines the integrity of the judiciary. The
involvement of a court coordinator in the recusal process and the denial of
motions that were never filed could be seen as a violation of procedural
rules and an act that undermines public confidence in the judiciary.
Therefore, the Commission has a duty to investigate such matters to ensure
the integrity and proper functioning of the judicial system.

Summary
The Texas Commission on Judicial Conduct has the authority to investigate
allegations or appearances of judicial misconduct. If the commission finds
that the allegations are not unfounded or frivolous, it is required to conduct
a full investigation and notify the judge involved. This process ensures
accountability and integrity within the judiciary.
Tex. Gov't. Code § 25.00255 Tex. Gov't. Code § 25.00255 Recusal Or
Disqualification of Judge
Extract
A party in a case in any trial court other than a statutory probate court or
justice court may seek to recuse or disqualify a judge who is sitting in the
case by filing a motion with the clerk of the court in which the case is
pending. The motion: (1) must be verified; (2) must assert one or more of the
grounds listed in Rule 18b; (3) must not be based solely on the judge's ruling
in the case; and (4) must state with detail and particularity facts that: (A)
are within the affiant's personal knowledge, except that facts may be stated
on information and belief if the basis for that belief is specifically stated; (B)
would be admissible in evidence; and (C) if proven, would be sufficient to
justify recusal or disqualification.
Summary
The process for recusal or disqualification of a judge is clearly defined and
must be initiated by a verified motion filed with the court clerk. The
involvement of a court coordinator, who serves at the pleasure of the judge,
in this process could undermine the neutrality and integrity of the recusal
process. Additionally, denying motions that were never filed contradicts the
procedural requirements outlined in Rule 18a, which could indicate a deeper
issue of judicial misconduct or procedural irregularity.

Or Recusal of Judges

=== PAGE 35 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
A judge is subject to recusal or disqualification on the same grounds and
under the same circumstances as specified in TRCP Rule 18b. Motion. A
motion to recuse or disqualify a judge assigned to a case should: (A) be
made at the earliest practicable time; (B) be verified, if the motion is in
writing; (C) state with particularity the grounds for the motion; and (D) be
based on personal knowledge and include such facts as would be admissible
in evidence, except that facts may be stated on information and belief if the
basis for such belief is specifically stated.
Summary
The process for recusal or disqualification of judges is governed by specific
rules that require motions to be made at the earliest practicable time,
verified, and based on personal knowledge. The involvement of a court
coordinator in the recusal process, especially if it deviates from these
established procedures, could undermine the integrity of the process.
Additionally, the denial of motions that were never filed contradicts the
requirement for motions to be verified and based on specific grounds. This
suggests a potential violation of procedural rules, warranting investigation
by the Texas Commission on Judicial Conduct.
Tex. Gov't. Code § 29.055 Tex. Gov't. Code § 29.055 Procedure Following
Filing of Motion; Recusal Or Disqualification Without Motion
Extract
Before further proceedings in a case in which a motion for the recusal or
disqualification of a municipal judge has been filed, the judge shall: recuse
or disqualify himself or herself; or request the regional presiding judge to
assign a judge to hear the motion. A municipal judge who does not recuse or
disqualify himself or herself: shall forward, in original form or certified copy,
an order of referral, the motion, and all opposing and concurring statements
to the regional presiding judge; and may not take other action in the case
during the time after the filing of the motion for recusal or disqualification
and before a hearing on the motion, except for good cause stated in the
order in which the action is taken.
Summary
Procedure that must be followed when a motion for recusal or
disqualification of a municipal judge is filed. It specifies that the judge must
either recuse themselves or request the regional presiding judge to assign
another judge to hear the motion. Importantly, it also states that the judge
may not take any further action in the case after the filing of the motion and
before a hearing on the motion, except for good cause. This procedure
ensures that the process is handled impartially and without undue influence
from the judge facing recusal.

(Ret.), Dan S. Boyd - 2013-05-05
Extract
When a motion for disqualification or recusal is timely filed, before any
further proceedings in the case, the judge must recuse himself or herself or
request the presiding judge of the judicial district to assign a judge to hear
the recusal motion. [TRCP 18a(c).] It is improper for the sitting judge to take
any further action on the case until the recusal motion has been heard.
[Jamilah v. Bass, 862 SW2d 201 (TexApp — Houston [14th Dist] 1993, orig
proc) (trial judge improperly held contempt hearing after motion for recusal
was filed and held attorney who filed the motion in contempt).]
Summary
Under Texas Rules of Civil Procedure 18a, when a motion for recusal is filed,
the judge must either recuse themselves or request the presiding judge to
assign another judge to hear the motion. It is improper for the judge to take
any further action on the case until the recusal motion has been heard. This
ensures impartiality and fairness in judicial proceedings. The involvement of
a court coordinator, who serves at the pleasure of the judge facing recusal,
could undermine the neutrality of the process. Additionally, denying motions
that were never filed is contrary to the procedural requirements and could
indicate deeper procedural issues.
CHAPTER 6 Petitions for Writ of Mandamus
Practitioner's Guide to Civil Appeals in Texas - Full Court Press
Extract
When a judge denies a motion to disqualify and continues to sit in violation
of a constitutional or statutory proscription, mandamus is available to
compel the judge's mandatory disqualification. In that instance, the relator
need not show that the remedy by appeal is inadequate.
Summary
When a judge acts in violation of constitutional or statutory requirements,
such as improperly denying a motion to disqualify, mandamus can be used to
compel the judge's disqualification. This suggests that procedural
irregularities, like involving a court coordinator inappropriately or denying
motions that were never filed, could be grounds for mandamus relief if they
violate statutory procedures. The Texas Commission on Judicial Conduct

would be interested in investigating such violations to ensure judicial
integrity and adherence to procedural rules.
Recusal's Own Conflict of Interest
Criminal Justice - American Bar Association - Louis J. Virelli III -
2025-01-01
Extract
Judges’ recusal practices potentially compound this problem. Recusal
procedures, which have a pedigree as old as recusal itself, create an air of
mystery and isolation around recusal that is unusual in our judicial system.
Judges rarely explain their recusal decisions, creating an (often justifiable,
yet palpable) elusiveness to those decisions that distinguishes them from
more traditional orders and opinions. While this should not be enough to
seriously threaten recusal’s credibility, especially because lower court
judges do sometimes offer explanations, it adds fuel to an already
smoldering fire. Similarly, the fact that judges decide their own recusal
issues in the first instance promotes skepticism about the integrity of those
decisions. For the uninitiated, a judge deciding their own fate in recusal
matters seems like an inherent conflict that could itself...
Summary
Judicial recusal practices can create skepticism and a lack of transparency,
especially when judges are involved in deciding their own recusal issues.
This can lead to perceptions of conflict of interest and undermine the
integrity of the judicial process. The involvement of a court coordinator in
the recusal process, particularly when they are associated with the judge
facing recusal, can further exacerbate these issues. Additionally, the denial
of motions that were never filed raises questions about procedural fairness
and transparency, which are critical to maintaining public confidence in the
judiciary.
