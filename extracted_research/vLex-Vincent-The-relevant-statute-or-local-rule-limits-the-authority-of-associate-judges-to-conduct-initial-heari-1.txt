Question
The relevant statute or local rule limits the authority of associate judges to
conduct initial hearings and requires de novo review by a district judge upon
request. Statutes and local rules in the Fifth Circuit often specify that
associate judges (or magistrate judges) may conduct certain proceedings,
but de novo review must be conducted by a district judge upon proper
request. (See 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1); see also local rules of the relevant
district court). If an associate judge presides over a de novo request, they
act outside the scope of their statutory authority, and thus lack jurisdiction
to do so.
Answer (Fifth Circuit)
Short response
Under 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1) and consistent Fifth Circuit authority, associate
judges (magistrate judges) may conduct certain proceedings, but when a
party properly requests de novo review, only a district judge has jurisdiction
to conduct that review; an associate judge lacks statutory authority to
preside over such de novo determinations. If an associate judge undertakes
de novo review, they act outside the scope of their authority, rendering any
resulting decision jurisdictionally defective.
Summary
The statutory and case law framework in the Fifth Circuit, anchored by 28
U.S.C. § 636(b)(1), strictly limits the authority of associate (magistrate)
judges to making recommendations on dispositive matters, with the district
judge retaining exclusive, nondelegable authority to conduct de novo review
upon proper objection. This structure is reinforced by a consistent line of
Fifth Circuit and district court decisions, as well as administrative guidance,
all of which emphasize that only an Article III district judge may conduct de
novo review, and any attempt by an associate judge to do so exceeds their
jurisdiction.
Accordingly, if a party objects to a magistrate judge’s findings or
recommendations, the district judge must independently review the
contested matters de novo; failure to do so, or any attempt by a magistrate
judge to conduct such review, violates both statutory and constitutional
requirements. This ensures that the final decision-making authority in
dispositive matters remains with the Article III judiciary, preserving the
integrity of the federal judicial process and the rights of the parties.

Background and Relevant Law
Legislative and Regulatory Framework
The central statutory provision governing the authority of magistrate judges
in federal court is 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1). This statute delineates the scope of
duties that may be assigned to magistrate judges and, crucially, the process
for review of their recommendations by district judges. Section 636(b)(1)(A)
allows district judges to refer non-dispositive pretrial matters to magistrate
judges for determination, but specifically excludes certain dispositive
motions (such as motions for summary judgment, to dismiss, or for
injunctive relief) from this delegation. For these excluded matters, § 636(b)
(1)(B) authorizes magistrate judges only to conduct hearings and submit
proposed findings of fact and recommendations for disposition to a district
judge.
The statute further provides that, upon timely objection by a party, a district
judge must make a de novo determination of those portions of the
magistrate judge’s report or recommendations to which objection is made.
The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, particularly Rule 72(b), mirror this
statutory scheme, reinforcing the requirement that dispositive matters are
subject to de novo review by a district judge upon objection.
Case Law
Fifth Circuit and district court decisions have consistently interpreted §
636(b)(1) to mean that magistrate judges may not make final determinations
on dispositive matters unless the parties consent; otherwise, their role is
limited to making recommendations, with the district judge retaining
ultimate authority. The requirement for de novo review by a district judge is
described as nondelegable and essential to the constitutional structure of
federal courts.
Key cases include:
Guilbeau v. Schlumberger Tech. Corp., 719 F.Supp.3d 702 (W.D.
Tex. 2024): This case explains that magistrate judges may handle
certain pretrial matters, but for dispositive issues, they may only issue
recommendations, and a district judge must conduct de novo review if
objections are raised.
United States v. Holt, CASE NO. 1:21CR30 (E.D. Tex. Jun 03,
2021); United States v. Riggs, CASE NO. 1:19CR125-1 (E.D. Tex.
Mar 04, 2021); United States v. Plummer, CASE NO. 9:20CR52-1
(E.D. Tex. Mar 03, 2021); and similar cases: These decisions
uniformly hold that a party must file specific, written objections to
preserve the right to de novo review by a district judge, and that the
district judge must exercise independent judgment rather than merely
adopt the magistrate judge’s recommendations.

Jones v. Johnson, 134 F.3d 309 (5th Cir. 1998): The Fifth Circuit
held that magistrate judges cannot possess final decision-making
authority over substantial issues, as this would violate Article III of the
Constitution. Only the district judge may make final determinations on
such matters.
Hernandez v. Estelle, 711 F.2d 619 (5th Cir. 1983) and U.S. v.
Elsoffer, 644 F.2d 357 (5th Cir. 1981): These cases reinforce that
the district judge’s de novo review is a statutory and constitutional
requirement, and that the magistrate judge’s recommendations do not
carry presumptive weight.
U.S. v. Bolivar-Munoz, 313 F.3d 253 (5th Cir. 2002): The Fifth
Circuit emphasized that the dispositive question is whether the
magistrate judge’s actions are subject to meaningful review by a
district judge, and that the district judge must retain ultimate control.
Charboneau v. Box, Civil Action No. 4:13-CV-678 (E.D. Tex. Mar
29, 2017) and Tige Boats, Inc. v. Interplastic Corp., No. 1:15-
CV-0114-P-BL (N.D. Tex. Dec 21, 2015): These cases further clarify
that the statutory and rule-based framework requires district judges to
conduct de novo review of any properly objected-to recommendations
from magistrate judges.
Administrative Decisions
Administrative guidance from the Department of Justice and related
authorities further supports the statutory and constitutional limitations on
the authority of magistrate judges:
Constitutionality of Vesting Magistrate Judges With Jurisdiction
Over Asset Forfeiture Cases, 120693 DOJ, 93-18 (1993): This
opinion explains that Article III forbids Congress from assigning
jurisdiction over certain cases to magistrate judges without the parties’
consent, and that magistrate judges are considered adjuncts to district
judges.
Enforcement by Federal Magistrates of Summonses Issued by
the FBI, 121186 DOJ, 86-20 (1986): This opinion states that treating
a magistrate judge’s order as a recommendation, subject to de novo
review by a district judge, poses no constitutional problem, but a
magistrate judge cannot issue a final order in such circumstances.
Fifth Circuit: District Court Improperly Referred Bankruptcy
Appeal To Magistrate Judge For Final Determination (2022): The
Fifth Circuit vacated a magistrate judge’s final ruling on a bankruptcy
appeal, holding that only a district judge may make the final
determination, and that the magistrate judge’s role is limited to making
recommendations.

defenses (2022): These materials reiterate that, absent consent,

magistrate judges may only make recommendations, and the district

Analysis
Statutory and Constitutional Limits on Magistrate Judge
Authority
The statutory scheme under 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1) is clear: magistrate judges
may be assigned certain pretrial matters for determination, but for
dispositive matters, their authority is limited to making recommendations to
the district judge. The district judge must then conduct a de novo review of
any portions of the magistrate judge’s report to which a party objects. This
requirement is not merely procedural but is rooted in the constitutional
separation of powers, as only Article III judges may exercise the judicial
power of the United States in making final determinations on substantial
matters, unless the parties consent to a magistrate judge’s jurisdiction.
The Fifth Circuit has repeatedly emphasized that the district judge’s de novo
review is nondelegable and essential to the legitimacy of the process. In 
Jones v. Johnson, 134 F.3d 309 (5th Cir. 1998), the court held that magistrate
judges cannot possess final decision-making authority over substantial
issues, as this would violate Article III. Similarly, in Hernandez v. Estelle,
711 F.2d 619 (5th Cir. 1983), the court remanded a case because the district
court failed to conduct the required de novo review, underscoring the
necessity of independent judicial evaluation by the district judge.
District courts within the Fifth Circuit have consistently applied this
framework. In Guilbeau v. Schlumberger Tech. Corp., 719 F.Supp.3d 702
(W.D. Tex. 2024), the court explained that magistrate judges may handle
certain pretrial matters, but for dispositive issues, they may only issue
recommendations, and a district judge must conduct de novo review if
objections are raised. Numerous other district court decisions, including 
United States v. Holt, CASE NO. 1:21CR30 (E.D. Tex. Jun 03, 2021), United
States v. Riggs, CASE NO. 1:19CR125-1 (E.D. Tex. Mar 04, 2021), and 
United States v. Plummer, CASE NO. 9:20CR52-1 (E.D. Tex. Mar 03, 2021),
reinforce that a party must file specific, written objections to preserve the
right to de novo review, and that the district judge must exercise
independent judgment rather than merely adopt the magistrate judge’s
recommendations.
Administrative decisions echo this statutory and case law framework. The
Department of Justice has opined that Article III forbids Congress from
assigning jurisdiction over certain cases to magistrate judges without the
parties’ consent, and that magistrate judges are considered adjuncts to
district judges (Constitutionality of Vesting Magistrate Judges With
Jurisdiction Over Asset Forfeiture Cases, 120693 DOJ, 93-18 (1993)). The
DOJ further clarified that treating a magistrate judge’s order as a
recommendation, subject to de novo review by a district judge, poses no
constitutional problem, but a magistrate judge cannot issue a final order in

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
such circumstances (Enforcement by Federal Magistrates of Summonses
Issued by the FBI, 121186 DOJ, 86-20 (1986)).
Consequences of Exceeding Statutory Authority
If an associate judge (magistrate judge) presides over a de novo request,
they act outside the scope of their statutory authority. The Fifth Circuit has
made clear that only the district judge may conduct de novo review of
objections to a magistrate judge’s recommendations. Any attempt by a
magistrate judge to conduct such review is ultra vires and renders any
resulting decision jurisdictionally defective.
This principle is illustrated in Jones v. Johnson, 134 F.3d 309 (5th Cir. 1998),
where the court found that a magistrate judge’s final decision-making
without district court review led to a jurisdictional issue. Similarly, in Fifth
Circuit: District Court Improperly Referred Bankruptcy Appeal To
Magistrate Judge For Final Determination (2022), the Fifth Circuit vacated a
magistrate judge’s final ruling on a bankruptcy appeal, holding that only a
district judge may make the final determination, and that the magistrate
judge’s role is limited to making recommendations.
The requirement for de novo review by a district judge is not a mere
formality. As explained in Hernandez v. Estelle, 711 F.2d 619 (5th Cir. 1983),
the district judge must independently evaluate the contested matters, and
failure to do so is reversible error. The district judge’s review must be
substantive and cannot simply rubber-stamp the magistrate judge’s
recommendations (U.S. v. Elsoffer, 644 F.2d 357 (5th Cir. 1981)).
Procedural Safeguards and Party Rights
The procedural requirements for objecting to a magistrate judge’s findings
and recommendations are well established. A party must file specific,
written objections within a specified timeframe (typically fourteen days) to
preserve the right to de novo review by a district judge (United States v.
Holt, CASE NO. 1:21CR30 (E.D. Tex. Jun 03, 2021)). Failure to object waives
the right to de novo review and, except for plain error, appellate review as
well.
When a party does object, the district judge must exercise independent
judgment and cannot delegate this responsibility to a magistrate judge. This
safeguard ensures that the final decision-making authority in dispositive
matters remains with the Article III judiciary, preserving the integrity of the
federal judicial process and the rights of the parties.
Exceptions and Caveats
There is a narrow exception to the requirement for district judge review: if
all parties consent, a magistrate judge may be authorized to conduct all
proceedings, including entry of final judgment, under 28 U.S.C. § 636(c).
However, absent such consent, the statutory and constitutional framework
strictly limits the authority of magistrate judges to making

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
recommendations, with the district judge retaining exclusive authority to
conduct de novo review.
No provided authority suggests any other exception to this rule. The
consistent line of Fifth Circuit and district court decisions, as well as
administrative guidance, all reinforce the nondelegable nature of the district
judge’s authority in conducting de novo review upon proper objection.
Conclusion
The statutory, case law, and administrative framework in the Fifth Circuit is
unequivocal: associate judges (magistrate judges) may conduct certain
proceedings and make recommendations, but when a party properly
requests de novo review, only a district judge has jurisdiction to conduct that
review. Any attempt by an associate judge to preside over a de novo request
exceeds their statutory authority and is jurisdictionally invalid. This
structure preserves the constitutional role of Article III judges and ensures
that parties’ rights to independent judicial review are fully protected.

Freehold Licensing, Inc. v. Aequitatem Capital Partners, LLC, A-18-CV-413
LY (W.D. Tex. Oct 29, 2018)
U.S. District Court — Western District of Texas
Extract
A party's failure to file written objections to the proposed findings and
recommendations contained in this Report within fourteen (14) days after
the party is served with a copy of the Report shall bar that party from de
novo review by the district court of the proposed findings and
recommendations in the Report and, except upon grounds of plain error,
shall bar the party from appellate review of unobjected-to proposed factual
findings and legal conclusions accepted by the district court. See 28 U.S.C. §
636(b)(1)(c); Thomas v. Arn, 474 U.S. 140, 150-153, 106 S.Ct. 466,472-74
(1985); Douglass v. United Services Automobile Ass'n, 79 F.3d 1415, 1428-29
(5th Cir. 1996).
Summary
The passage outlines the procedure for de novo review by a district court
when a party objects to a magistrate judge's report and recommendation. It
specifies that if a party does not file objections, they are barred from de
novo review, highlighting the procedural requirement for district judge
involvement upon request. This supports the proposition that magistrate
judges have limited authority and that district judges must conduct de novo
reviews when properly requested.

U.S. District Court — Eastern District of Texas
Extract
A party who files timely written objections to a magistrate judge's report and
recommendation is entitled to a de novo review of those findings or
recommendations to which the party specifically objects. 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)
(1)(C); Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)(2)-(3). ... The Federal Magistrates Act, 28 U.S.C. §
636, permits 'a [full Article III] judge [to] designate a magistrate judge to
hear and determine any pretrial matter pending before the court, except
[certain dispositive motions]' and further 'permits a judge [to] designate a
magistrate judge to... submit to a judge of the court proposed findings of
fact and recommendations for the disposition, by a judge of the court, of any
[of those excepted] motion[s]...' 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(A)-(B) (2012). ... A
magistrate judge may, therefore, recommend disposition of a motion to
dismiss to the district judge, who will then conduct a de novo review of
those portions of the recommendation to which parties raise specific, timely
objection. 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(C).
Summary
Statutory framework under 28 U.S.C. § 636, which governs the authority of
magistrate judges and the requirement for de novo review by a district
judge upon specific objections. It confirms that magistrate judges can make
recommendations, but the district judge must conduct a de novo review if
objections are raised. This supports the proposition that associate judges
have limited authority and that de novo review by a district judge is required
upon request.

U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
Generally, our precedent instructs that when analyzing a challenge to the
district judge's delegation of authority to a magistrate judge pursuant to §
636(b), the 'dispositive question' is whether the duty assigned to a
magistrate judge is 'subject to meaningful review' by a district judge. Jones
v. Johnson, 134 F.3d 309, 311 (5th Cir.1998); accord Dees, 125 F.3d at 268.
More specifically, we have explained repeatedly that when a district judge
enters a judgment, defects in the order of referral are procedural matters
that can be waived if not properly preserved. ... Here, the magistrate judges'
actions were subject to meaningful review by the district judge. A
magistrate judge's taking of a guilty plea does not bind the district judge.
Dees, 125 F.3d at 268. Instead, the district judge reserves 'ultimate control
over the plea proceedings, which are submitted to the court for its approval.'

Statutory authority of magistrate judges under 28 U.S.C. § 636(b) and
emphasizes that their actions are subject to meaningful review by district
judges. It highlights that district judges have ultimate control over

highlighting the statutory and constitutional safeguards that ensure a
district judge must consider the actual evidence rather than merely adopting
the magistrate's recommendations. This supports the proposition that
associate judges have limited authority and that de novo review by a district
judge is required upon request.
Tige Boats, Inc. v. Interplastic Corp., No. 1:15-CV-0114-P-BL (N.D. Tex. Dec
21, 2015)
U.S. District Court — Northern District of Texas
Extract
Section 636(b)(1) of Title 28 of the United States Code grants magistrate
judges authority to consider and handle both non-dispositive and dispositive
pretrial matters, subject to different standards of review by a district court
judge... Section 636(b)(1)(B) permits district judges to refer dispositive
matters to a magistrate judge for issuance of proposed findings of fact and
recommendations for disposition. The statute provides for the filing of
written objections to proposed findings and recommendations and for a de
novo determination of matters 'to which objection is made.'... Like § 636(b)
(1), Fed. R. Civ. P. 72 recognizes that the authority of magistrate judges and
the corresponding review by the district court ultimately depend on whether
the referred matter is properly characterized as dispositive or non-
dispositive... For dispositive matters, Rule 72(b)(3) provides for a de novo
determination of 'any part of the magistrate judge's disposition that has
been properly objected to.'
Summary
Statutory framework under 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1) and Fed. R. Civ. P. 72,
which delineates the authority of magistrate judges and the requirement for
de novo review by district judges for dispositive matters. It emphasizes that
magistrate judges can handle certain pretrial matters, but for dispositive
issues, a district judge must conduct a de novo review if objections are
raised. This supports the proposition that associate judges (or magistrate
judges) have limited authority and that district judges must review
dispositive matters de novo upon request.

Guilbeau v. Schlumberger Tech. Corp., 719 F.Supp.3d 702 (W.D. Tex. 2024)
U.S. District Court — Western District of Texas
Extract
Through referral under 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1), magistrate judges have
authority to consider and handle both non-dispositive and dispositive
pretrial matters, subject to different standards of review by the presiding
district court judge. Section 636(b)(1)(A) permits district judges to
'designate a magistrate judge to hear and determine any pretrial matter
pending before the court,' except for a motion for injunctive relief, for
judgment on the pleadings, for summary judgment, to dismiss or quash an
indictment or information made by the defendant, to suppress evidence in a
criminal case, to dismiss or to permit maintenance of a class action, to
dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, and to
involuntarily dismiss an action... Section 636(b)(1)(B) permits district judges
to refer dispositive matters to a magistrate judge for issuance of proposed
findings of fact and recommendations for disposition... A judge of the court
shall make a de novo determination of those portions of the report or
specified proposed findings or recommendations to which objection is made.
Summary
Magistrate judges can handle certain pretrial matters, but their authority is
limited by statute. For dispositive matters, magistrate judges can only issue
recommendations, and a district judge must conduct a de novo review if
objections are raised. This supports the proposition that associate judges (or
magistrate judges) lack jurisdiction to preside over de novo requests, as
such requests require a district judge's review.

Objections must be: (1) specific, (2) in writing, and (3) served and filed
within fourteen (14) days after being served with a copy of this report. See
28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1). A party's failure to object bars that party from: (1)
entitlement to de novo review by a district judge of proposed findings and
recommendations, see Rodriguez v. Bowen, 857 F.2d 275, 276-77 (5th Cir.
1988), and (2) appellate review, except on grounds of plain error of

Hernandez v. Estelle, 711 F.2d 619 (5th Cir. 1983)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
Because it appears that the district court's approval of the magistrate's
report did not constitute a de novo review of the portions of the magistrate's
report to which the petitioner objected, as required by 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1),
we remand this case to the district court for such de novo review based on
the now-available transcript of the hearing. In 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1), it is
provided that '[a] judge of the court shall make a de novo determination of
those portions of the [magistrate's] report or specified proposed findings or
recommendations to which objection is made.'
Summary
The Fifth Circuit requires district courts to conduct a de novo review of
magistrate judges' reports when objections are made, as mandated by 28
U.S.C. § 636(b)(1). This requirement ensures that the district judge exercises
their non-delegable authority to independently evaluate the contested
portions of the magistrate's findings. The passage highlights the necessity of
a district judge's involvement in the de novo review process, supporting the
proposition that associate judges lack jurisdiction to preside over such
requests.

U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
The magistrate may do no more than propose a recommendation, and
neither § 636(b) nor the General Order gives such recommendation
presumptive weight.... The authority and the responsibility to make an
informed, final determination, we emphasize, remains with the judge.
Summary
The passage from "U.S. v. Elsoffer" highlights that under § 636(b), a
magistrate judge's role is limited to making recommendations, and the
ultimate decision-making authority rests with the district judge. This aligns
with the proposition that de novo review by a district judge is required upon
request, as the magistrate's recommendations do not carry presumptive
weight. The passage underscores the non-delegable authority of district
judges to make final determinations, supporting the idea that associate
judges lack jurisdiction to preside over de novo requests.
Jones v. Johnson, 134 F.3d 309 (5th Cir. 1998)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
The statute permitted any district court, by rule, to assign magistrates 'such
additional duties as are not inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of
the United States.' Id. § 636(b). As the Dye court noted, however, 'Judicial
decision making, except in relation to minor offenses, ... is not within the
prerogative of the United States magistrate nor can it be delegated to him
by the United States District Judge.' 472 F.2d at 1207 n. 1 (citations
omitted). ... Only when a magistrate judge possesses final decisionmaking
authority over a substantial issue in a case does an Article III problem
arise. ... The district judge effectively ceded authority to act when he
referred the motion for CPC to the magistrate judge 'for disposition and/or
recommendation.' Once the magistrate judge elected to take final action,
rather than submit a report and recommendation, the cession became final,
with the magistrate judge ruling, in a document entitled 'Memorandum and
Order,' that the 'request for a certificate of probable cause is DENIED.' As
the Dees court held, 'Article III judges cannot delegate to magistrate judges
final authority over some important issue in a case.'
Summary
The passage highlights the statutory framework under 28 U.S.C. § 636(b),
which allows magistrate judges to perform additional duties as long as they
are consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States. However,
it emphasizes that magistrate judges cannot possess final decision-making

authority over substantial issues, as this would infringe upon Article III
judicial powers. The passage illustrates a scenario where a magistrate
judge's final decision-making without district court review led to a
jurisdictional issue, supporting the need for de novo review by a district
judge.
The power to award sanctions: does it belong in the hands of magistrate
judges?

Extract
Magistrate judges do not have the authority, under the Act or Rule 72, to
hear and determine dispositive matters.(11) Instead, they must make
recommendations to the district judge for disposition.(12) These
recommendations are subject to de novo review by the district judge, with
no deference to the magistrate judge's recommendation.(13)... (b)(1)(C)
(indicating the district court judge's obligation to conduct de novo review
upon objection); Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b) (same).
Summary
The passage clearly states that magistrate judges do not have the authority
to hear and determine dispositive matters and must instead make
recommendations to the district judge. These recommendations are subject
to de novo review by the district judge, which aligns with the proposition
that de novo review must be conducted by a district judge upon proper
request. The reference to 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1) and Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)
supports the statutory requirement for de novo review by a district judge,
reinforcing the proposition.

Extract
The magistrate judge does not have authority to make a final and binding
disposition of a motion to suppress. Raddatz, 447 U.S. at 673. Rather, the
district court judge must make a de novo determination on those portions of
the magistrate judge’s report and recommendation as to which objection has
been made. FRCrP 59(b)(3); id. at 672 (upholding district court judge’s
order adopting magistrate judge’s report and recommendation that
defendant’s incriminating statements were voluntary where district court
clearly stated scope of its review).
Summary
The passage clearly states that magistrate judges do not have the authority
to make final and binding decisions on dispositive motions, such as motions
to suppress. Instead, a district court judge must conduct a de novo review of
any objections to the magistrate judge's recommendations. This aligns with
the proposition that associate judges (or magistrate judges) have limited
authority and that a district judge must conduct a de novo review upon
request. The passage supports the idea that if a magistrate judge were to
preside over a de novo request, they would be acting outside their statutory
authority.

Fifth Circuit: District Court Improperly Referred Bankruptcy Appeal To
Magistrate Judge For Final Determination
Extract
The Fifth Circuit vacated a magistrate judge's ruling on appeal from a
bankruptcy court judgment, ruling that the district court improperly
referred the appeal to the magistrate judge for a final disposition, rather
than a recommendation subject to review and adoption by the district
court... The Fifth Circuit accordingly vacated the magistrate judge's
judgment and remanded the case to the district court for further
proceedings.
Summary
The Fifth Circuit has clarified that magistrate judges do not have the
authority to make final determinations on appeals from bankruptcy court
judgments. Instead, such matters should be referred to a district judge for a
final decision, highlighting the requirement for de novo review by a district
judge. This supports the proposition that associate judges, such as
magistrate judges, have limited authority and require district judge
oversight for certain proceedings.
