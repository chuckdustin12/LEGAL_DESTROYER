Question
The fraudulent scheme devised by Morgan and Daniel was carried out
through their coordinated actions, including directing Morgan to obtain an
ex-parte order of protection and preparing false documents to present to the
Texas courts. Under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), it is unlawful for any person
employed by or associated with an enterprise to conduct or participate,
directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a
pattern of racketeering activity. Their coordinated actions to execute the
fraudulent scheme demonstrate that they conducted the affairs of the
enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity, satisfying the
requirements of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c).
Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
Morgan and Daniel's coordinated actions in obtaining an ex-parte order of
protection and preparing false documents for Texas courts likely satisfy the
requirements for a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). Their scheme
demonstrates the conduct of an enterprise's affairs through a pattern of
racketeering activity as required by the statute.
Summary
Based on the analysis of the applicable law, Morgan and Daniel's
coordinated fraudulent actions appear to meet the essential elements
required to establish a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). The statute prohibits
any person employed by or associated with an enterprise from conducting or
participating in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of
racketeering activity, which requires evidence of (1) conduct or
participation, (2) of an enterprise, (3) through a pattern, (4) of racketeering
activity.
Morgan and Daniel's coordinated activities in obtaining an ex-parte order of
protection and preparing false documents to present to Texas courts
demonstrate the existence of an association-in-fact enterprise and a pattern
of racketeering activity. Their actions show a relationship between the
predicate acts and continuity, as they worked together to execute a
fraudulent scheme with multiple coordinated steps. The nexus between their
actions, the enterprise, and the pattern of racketeering activity provides
strong support for finding a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c).

Background and Relevant Law
Statutory Framework
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO),
particularly 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), provides the statutory framework for
analyzing Morgan and Daniel's actions. According to 18 U.S.C. § 1962
(2025), "It shall be unlawful for any person employed by or associated with
any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or
foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the
conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering
activity or collection of unlawful debt."
This provision makes it unlawful for individuals associated with an
enterprise to conduct or participate in the enterprise's affairs through a
pattern of racketeering activity. The fraudulent scheme involving Morgan
and Daniel, with their coordinated actions to obtain an ex-parte order and
prepare false documents, may constitute participating in the conduct of an
enterprise's affairs through racketeering activity, potentially aligning with
the requirements of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c).
Essential Elements of a RICO Claim
The case law has established that claims under RICO, 18 U.S.C. § 1962, have
three common elements: "(1) a person who engages in (2) a pattern of
racketeering activity, (3) connected to the acquisition, establishment,
conduct, or control of an enterprise." State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v.
Punjwani, CIVIL ACTION NO. H-19-1491 (S.D. Tex. Dec 31, 2019). This case
also emphasizes that regarding the element of participation, a "nexus
between the defendant, the enterprise, and the racketeering activity" is
required, which is "establish[ed] by proof that the defendant has in fact
committed the racketeering acts alleged, that the defendant's association
with the enterprise facilitated the commission of the acts, and that the acts
had some effect on the enterprise."
Similarly, Allstate Ins. Co. v. Benhamou, 190 F.Supp.3d 631, 651 (S.D. Tex.
2016) specifies that a violation of § 1962(c) requires "(1) conduct or
participation (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity." The court further explains that RICO makes it "unlawful for any
person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the
activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or
participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs
through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt."
Definition of "Enterprise"
RICO defines "enterprise" very broadly. According to Heden v. Hill, 937
F.Supp. 1230, 1242 (S.D. Tex. 1996), the term "enterprise" includes "any
individual, partnership, corporation, association or other legal entity, any
union or group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity."
18 U.S.C. § 1961(4). Importantly, "There is no restriction upon the

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
associations embraced by the definition: a RICO 'enterprise' can be either a
legal entity or an 'association in fact' enterprise."
Furthermore, Heden v. Hill, 937 F.Supp. 1230, 1242 (S.D. Tex. 1996) notes
that "An illegal organization also may be an enterprise for RICO purposes."
An enterprise is proved by "evidence of an ongoing organization, formal or
informal, and by evidence that the various associates function as a
continuing unit." In addition, the enterprise must be shown to have an
existence "separate and apart from the pattern of activity in which it
engages."
The secondary source Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy (2024) similarly defines
an enterprise as "A structured group of individuals associated for a common
purpose." This broad definition encompasses the kind of association that
may have existed between Morgan and Daniel.
Definition of "Pattern of Racketeering Activity"
For a pattern of racketeering activity, Allstate Ins. Co. v. Benhamou, 190
F.Supp.3d 631, 651 (S.D. Tex. 2016) explains that "'Pattern of racketeering
activity' is a defined term and has two components." First, there must be at
least two predicate acts of "racketeering activity." Second, there must be a
pattern of such acts.
Allstate Ins. Co. v. Donovan, CIVIL ACTION NO. H-12-0432 (S.D. Tex. Jul 03,
2012) further elaborates that "A pattern of racketeering activity consists of
two or more predicate criminal acts that are (1) related and (2) amount to or
pose a threat of continued criminal activity." The court also cites 18 U.S.C. §
1961(5), which defines a "pattern of racketeering activity" as requiring at
least two acts of racketeering activity, one of which occurred after the
effective date of this chapter and the last of which occurred within ten years
after the commission of a prior act of racketeering activity.
Additionally, RECONCEIVING COERCION-BASED CRIMINAL DEFENSES
(2022) explains that "criminal conduct forms a pattern if it embraces
criminal acts that have the same or similar purposes, results, participants,
victims, or methods of commission, or otherwise are interrelated by
distinguishing characteristics and are not isolated events." The Supreme
Court characterized this requirement as a "relationship" element and further
required a "continuity" element, "referring either to a closed period of
repeated conduct, or to past conduct that by its nature projects into the
future with a threat of repetition."
Conduct or Participation Requirement
In re Enron Corp. Securities, Derivative & Erisa, 284 F.Supp.2d 511, 564
(S.D. Tex. 2003) explains that the word "conduct" in § 1962(c) means
"participate in the operation or management of the enterprise itself." The
defendant who directs the enterprise need not have the primary
responsibility for directing the enterprise but must have some role in
directing it. "Operation" of an enterprise can be performed by upper

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
management or by "lower rung participants in the enterprise who are under
the direction of the upper management."
Reflections on Reves v. Ernst & Young: its meaning and impact on
substantive, accessory, aiding abetting and conspiracy liability under RICO
(1996) further clarifies that "Section 1962(c)'s disjunctive construction
makes unlawful the direct or indirect conduct of or participation in the
conduct of an enterprise's affairs by any person employed by or associated
with the enterprise." It emphasizes that any person "associated with" the
enterprise—not necessarily only those "employed by" the enterprise—who,
directly or indirectly, participated in the "conduct" of its affairs through a
pattern of racketeering activity risked violating the statute.
Nexus Requirement
Several sources emphasize the necessity of a relationship or nexus between
the pattern of racketeering activity and the enterprise. RACKETEER
INFLUENCED AND CORRUPT ORGANIZATIONS (2021) states that "Section
1962(c), the most commonly used RICO provision, prohibits persons
employed by or associated with an enterprise from conducting or
participating in the conduct or affairs of that enterprise through a pattern of
racketeering activity. A relationship, or nexus, between the pattern of
racketeering activity and the enterprise is required."
Similarly, Racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations (2005) notes that
Section 1962(c) "prohibits persons employed by or associated with an
enterprise from conducting or participating in the conduct or the affairs of
that enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity." This requires a
relationship between the pattern of racketeering activity and the enterprise.
Reflections on Reves v. Ernst & Young: its meaning and impact on
substantive, accessory, aiding abetting and conspiracy liability under RICO
(1996) adds that "The prosecution is, however, required to prove that the
defendant's actions were related to the enterprise and that those acts were
known to and were intended to further the affairs of the enterprise and did
in fact further the affairs of the enterprise."
Analysis
Analysis of the Enterprise Element
Based on the provided legal framework, Morgan and Daniel likely formed an
"association in fact" enterprise under RICO. According to Heden v. Hill, 937
F.Supp. 1230, 1242 (S.D. Tex. 1996), an enterprise can be an "association in
fact" even if it is not a legal entity, and even illegal organizations may qualify
as enterprises for RICO purposes. The enterprise is proved by "evidence of
an ongoing organization, formal or informal, and by evidence that the
various associates function as a continuing unit."
In this case, Morgan and Daniel's coordinated actions in obtaining an ex-
parte order of protection and preparing false documents to present to Texas

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
courts demonstrate the existence of an ongoing, albeit informal,
organization. Their collaboration in executing the fraudulent scheme shows
that they functioned as a continuing unit with a common purpose. As
required by Heden v. Hill, 937 F.Supp. 1230, 1242 (S.D. Tex. 1996), their
enterprise appears to have an existence "separate and apart from the
pattern of activity in which it engages," as their association presumably
existed independently of the specific fraudulent acts they committed.
Furthermore, as noted in RICO: A Primer (2022), courts have interpreted
the definition of "enterprise" broadly, capturing both legitimate and
illegitimate enterprises. The coordinated nature of Morgan and Daniel's
actions suggests a structured association for a common purpose, which
aligns with the definition of an enterprise provided in Civil Rico: A Tool of
Advocacy (2024).
Analysis of the Pattern of Racketeering Activity Element
Morgan and Daniel's actions also appear to constitute a pattern of
racketeering activity. According to Allstate Ins. Co. v. Benhamou, 190
F.Supp.3d 631, 651 (S.D. Tex. 2016), a "pattern of racketeering activity"
requires at least two predicate acts of "racketeering activity." In this case,
the multiple coordinated actions—directing Morgan to obtain an ex-parte
order of protection and preparing false documents to present to Texas
courts—could qualify as separate predicate acts of racketeering activity if
they involved fraud or other qualifying criminal activities.
Furthermore, Allstate Ins. Co. v. Donovan, CIVIL ACTION NO. H-12-0432
(S.D. Tex. Jul 03, 2012) explains that a pattern of racketeering activity
consists of two or more predicate criminal acts that are related and amount
to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity. Morgan and Daniel's
actions appear to be related, as they were part of the same fraudulent
scheme and involved the same participants. The preparation of false
documents and obtaining of an ex-parte order based on those documents
show a continuity of purpose and method.
As noted in RECONCEIVING COERCION-BASED CRIMINAL DEFENSES
(2022), criminal conduct forms a pattern if it embraces criminal acts with
"the same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of
commission, or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics
and are not isolated events." Morgan and Daniel's actions share the same
purpose (executing a fraudulent scheme), the same participants (Morgan
and Daniel), similar methods (fraud and deception), and are clearly
interrelated as part of a coordinated effort to defraud the Texas courts.
Analysis of the Conduct or Participation Element
The conduct or participation element of § 1962(c) also appears to be
satisfied. According to In re Enron Corp. Securities, Derivative & Erisa, 284
F.Supp.2d 511, 564 (S.D. Tex. 2003), "conduct" means "participate in the
operation or management of the enterprise itself." Both Morgan and Daniel
appear to have played active roles in directing and executing the fraudulent
scheme. Daniel directed Morgan to obtain an ex-parte order of protection,

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
and both were involved in preparing false documents, indicating their
participation in the operation and management of the enterprise.
As Reflections on Reves v. Ernst & Young: its meaning and impact on
substantive, accessory, aiding abetting and conspiracy liability under RICO
(1996) clarifies, § 1962(c) makes unlawful the "direct or indirect conduct of
or participation in the conduct of an enterprise's affairs by any person
employed by or associated with the enterprise." Both Morgan and Daniel
were clearly associated with the enterprise and directly participated in its
affairs through their coordinated actions.
Analysis of the Nexus Requirement
The nexus requirement, emphasized in multiple sources, also appears to be
met. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Punjwani, CIVIL ACTION NO.
H-19-1491 (S.D. Tex. Dec 31, 2019) explains that a "nexus between the
defendant, the enterprise, and the racketeering activity" is required, which
is "establish[ed] by proof that the defendant has in fact committed the
racketeering acts alleged, that the defendant's association with the
enterprise facilitated the commission of the acts, and that the acts had some
effect on the enterprise."
In this case, both Morgan and Daniel committed the alleged racketeering
acts (obtaining an ex-parte order through false pretenses and preparing
false documents). Their association with each other facilitated the
commission of these acts, as they worked together to execute the fraudulent
scheme. The acts had an effect on their enterprise by furthering its
fraudulent purpose—namely, obtaining a court order based on false
information.
As required by Reflections on Reves v. Ernst & Young: its meaning and
impact on substantive, accessory, aiding abetting and conspiracy liability
under RICO (1996), Morgan and Daniel's actions were clearly "related to the
enterprise" and were "known to and were intended to further the affairs of
the enterprise and did in fact further the affairs of the enterprise." Their
coordinated efforts to obtain an ex-parte order and prepare false documents
were directly related to the enterprise's fraudulent purpose and were
intended to further that purpose.
Exceptions and Caveats
The Interstate Commerce Requirement
One potential caveat to the application of § 1962(c) in this case is the
interstate commerce requirement. According to 18 U.S.C. § 1962 (2025), the
statute applies to enterprises "engaged in, or the activities of which affect,
interstate or foreign commerce." The provided facts do not explicitly state
whether Morgan and Daniel's activities affected interstate commerce.
However, courts have generally interpreted this requirement broadly, and it
is possible that their fraudulent scheme had some effect on interstate

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
commerce, particularly if it involved financial transactions or
communications across state lines.
Specific Predicate Acts
Another caveat is the requirement that the pattern of racketeering activity
consist of specific predicate acts enumerated in 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1).
According to Allstate Ins. Co. v. Donovan, CIVIL ACTION NO. H-12-0432
(S.D. Tex. Jul 03, 2012), "Predicate acts can be either state or federal
crimes." The facts provided do not specify exactly which crimes Morgan and
Daniel's actions might constitute, but they likely involve fraud or obstruction
of justice, which are listed as predicate acts under § 1961(1).
Continuity Requirement
The continuity requirement for establishing a pattern of racketeering
activity might also present a challenge. According to RICO: A Primer (2022),
proof of "continuity plus relationship" is necessary, which can refer to "a
closed period of repeated conduct, or to past conduct that by its nature
projects into the future with a threat of repetition." If Morgan and Daniel's
fraudulent scheme was a one-time occurrence without any indication of
repeated or ongoing criminal activity, it might be more difficult to establish
the continuity element.
Conclusion
Based on the analysis of the applicable law, Morgan and Daniel's
coordinated actions in obtaining an ex-parte order of protection and
preparing false documents to present to Texas courts likely satisfy the
requirements for a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c).
Their actions demonstrate the existence of an "association in fact"
enterprise, as they worked together in an ongoing, informal organization to
achieve a common fraudulent purpose. Their multiple coordinated actions—
obtaining an ex-parte order and preparing false documents—could qualify as
separate predicate acts of racketeering activity, forming a pattern due to
their relatedness and potential continuity.
Both Morgan and Daniel actively participated in the conduct of the
enterprise's affairs by directing and executing the fraudulent scheme. There
is a clear nexus between their actions, the enterprise, and the pattern of
racketeering activity, as their coordinated efforts were intended to further
the enterprise's fraudulent purpose and did in fact do so.
While there are potential caveats regarding the interstate commerce
requirement, specific predicate acts, and continuity, the overall evidence
suggests that Morgan and Daniel's fraudulent scheme likely falls within the
scope of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). Their coordinated actions to execute a
fraudulent scheme demonstrate that they conducted the affairs of an
enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity, thus satisfying the
requirements of the statute.

It shall be unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any
enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign
commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of
such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity or

operation or management of the enterprise itself.' Reves v. Ernst & Young,
507 U.S. 170, 185, 113 S.Ct. 1163, 122 L.Ed.2d 525 (1993). The defendant

Summary
Legal definition and explanation of what constitutes conducting or
participating in the conduct of an enterprise's affairs through a pattern of
racketeering activity under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). It clarifies that participation
can be direct or indirect and does not require primary responsibility for
directing the enterprise. The passage also explains that a pattern of
racketeering activity must consist of two or more related predicate acts,
which are federal or state crimes. This supports the proposition by showing
that Morgan and Daniel's coordinated actions, if they involve predicate acts
such as fraud, could satisfy the requirements of conducting an enterprise's
affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.

Necessity of showing predicate acts and a pattern of such acts, which aligns
with the proposition that Morgan and Daniel's coordinated actions could
constitute a pattern of racketeering activity. The case also emphasizes that a
pattern requires at least two predicate acts, which could be satisfied by their
actions in obtaining an ex-parte order and preparing false documents.

Heden v. Hill, 937 F.Supp. 1230 (S.D. Tex. 1996)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of Texas
Extract
RICO defines 'enterprise' very broadly. The term 'enterprise' includes 'any
individual, partnership, corporation, association or other legal entity, any
union or group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.'
18 U.S.C. § 1961(4). There is no restriction upon the associations embraced
by the definition: a RICO 'enterprise' can be either a legal entity or an
'association in fact' enterprise. ... An illegal organization also may be an
enterprise for RICO purposes. Turkette, 452 U.S. at 580-81, 101 S.Ct. at
2527-28. An enterprise is proved by 'evidence of an ongoing organization,
formal or informal, and by evidence that the various associates function as a
continuing unit.' Id. at 583, 101 S.Ct. at 2528. In addition, the enterprise
must be shown to have an existence 'separate and apart from the pattern of
activity in which it engages.'
Summary
The definition of an "enterprise" under RICO is broad and includes both
legal entities and associations in fact. The passage explains that an
enterprise can be an illegal organization and is demonstrated by evidence of
an ongoing organization where associates function as a continuing unit. This
supports the proposition that Morgan and Daniel's coordinated actions could
be seen as conducting the affairs of an enterprise through a pattern of
racketeering activity, as their actions could constitute an "association in
fact" enterprise under RICO.

To establish a RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), there must be a person
engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity connected to an enterprise.
The passage explains the need for a nexus between the defendant, the
enterprise, and the racketeering activity, which aligns with the proposition
that Morgan and Daniel's coordinated actions to execute a fraudulent
scheme could satisfy these requirements.

Extract
Reduced to its three essentials, a civil RICO claim must involve: (1) a person
who engages in (2) a pattern of racketeering activity; (3) connected to the
acquisition, establishment, conduct, or control of an enterprise... A 'pattern
of racketeering activity,' as required by § 1962(c), requires at least two acts
of racketeering activity within a ten year period. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5)... To
prove a pattern of racketeering activity a plaintiff or prosecutor must show
that the racketeering predicates are related, and that they amount to or
pose a threat of continued criminal activity.
Summary
A civil RICO claim requires demonstrating a pattern of racketeering activity
connected to an enterprise. The passage explains that a pattern involves at
least two related acts of racketeering that pose a threat of continued
criminal activity. This supports the proposition that Morgan and Daniel's
coordinated actions, if they involve multiple related acts of fraud, could
constitute a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO.

Summary
18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) makes it unlawful for individuals associated with an
enterprise to conduct or participate in the enterprise's affairs through a
pattern of racketeering activity. The fraudulent scheme by Morgan and
Daniel, involving coordinated actions to obtain an ex-parte order and
prepare false documents, can be seen as participating in the conduct of an
enterprise's affairs through racketeering activity. This aligns with the
requirements of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c).

Extract
Section 1962(c)'s disjunctive construction makes unlawful the direct or
indirect conduct of or participation in the conduct of an enterprise's affairs
by any person employed by or associated with the enterprise... any person
'associated with' the enterprise--not necessarily only those 'employed by' the
enterprise--who, directly or indirectly, participated in the 'conduct' of its
affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity risked violating the
statute... The prosecution is, however, required to prove that the defendant's
actions were related to the enterprise and that those acts were known to
and were intended to further the affairs of the enterprise and did in fact
further the affairs of the enterprise.

Summary
Participation can be direct or indirect and does not require employment by
the enterprise. It also emphasizes that the defendant's actions must be
related to and intended to further the enterprise's affairs. This supports the
proposition that Morgan and Daniel's coordinated actions, which furthered
the enterprise's fraudulent scheme, could satisfy the requirements of 18
U.S.C. § 1962(c).

Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy
The Brief - American Bar Association - 2024-01-01
Extract
A violation of § 1962(c), the section on which Sedima relies, requires (1)
conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity. The plaintiff must allege each of the elements to state a claim. They
are all equally essential components, and the complaint will fail if any one of
them is not adequately pleaded... To establish a § 1962(c) RICO claim, the
following elements must be proven: • Enterprise: A structured group of
individuals associated for a common purpose. • Pattern of racketeering
activity: At least two acts of racketeering, as specified within the statute,
within 10 years. • Conduct: Directly or indirectly conducting the enterprise’s
affairs through racketeering.

Summary
Essential elements required to establish a RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. §
1962(c), which includes conduct, enterprise, pattern of racketeering activity,
and injury. The fraudulent scheme by Morgan and Daniel can be seen as
conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity, as it
involves coordinated actions to achieve a common fraudulent purpose. The
passage supports the proposition by providing the legal framework
necessary to argue that their actions satisfy the requirements of § 1962(c).
Corporate Criminal Liability: End It, Don't Mend It.
The Journal of Corporation Law - University of Iowa Journal of
Corporation Law - Smith, Stephen F. - 2022-06-22
Extract
Subsection 1962(c), the most commonly used basis for substantive RICO
charges, is instructive. It imposes civil and criminal liability on the persons
'employed by or associated with' organized-crime syndicates or other RICO
'enterprises' who 'conduct, or participate in the conduct of, the [enterprise's]
affairs' through a 'pattern of racketeering activity.'
Summary
18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) targets individuals associated with enterprises who
conduct or participate in the conduct of the enterprise's affairs through a
pattern of racketeering activity. This aligns with the proposition that Morgan
and Daniel's coordinated actions to execute a fraudulent scheme could be
seen as conducting the affairs of an enterprise through a pattern of
racketeering activity, thus satisfying the requirements of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c).
RECONCEIVING COERCION-BASED CRIMINAL DEFENSES.
Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology - Northwestern University,
School of Law - Galoob, Stephen R. - 2022-03-22
Extract
The inquiry here is meant to invoke the 'pattern of racketeering activity'
element of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).
The Organized Crime Control Act (1970), which includes RICO, provides that
'criminal conduct forms a pattern if it embraces criminal acts that have the
same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of
commission, or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics
and are not isolated events.' The Supreme Court characterized this
requirement as a 'relationship' element and held that the statute further
requires a 'continuity' element, 'referring either to a closed period of

=== PAGE 18 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
repeated conduct, or to past conduct that by its nature projects into the
future with a threat of repetition.'
Summary
The RICO statute requires a "pattern of racketeering activity," which
involves criminal acts with similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or
methods of commission. The passage also highlights the "relationship" and
"continuity" elements, which are essential to establish a pattern. Morgan
and Daniel's coordinated actions, including obtaining an ex-parte order and
preparing false documents, can be seen as interrelated criminal acts with
similar purposes and methods, thus satisfying the "pattern" requirement
under RICO.
RICO: A Primer
Extract
A plaintiff is required to demonstrate that the defendant conducted the
affairs of an enterprise though a pattern of racketeering activity. The person
and the enterprise generally must be distinct; but, of course, a Rico person
can be a part of an enterprise. A RICO enterprise includes 'any individual,
partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or
group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.' Courts
have interpreted 'enterprise' broadly, and the definition captures both
legitimate and illegitimate enterprises. The statutory list is not exhaustive
but merely illustrative. A 'pattern' may exist where any combination of two
or more offenses occurred within a period of time. In Sedima, S.P.R.L. v.
Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479, the Supreme Court held that the RICO pattern
element requires more than merely proving two predicate acts of
racketeering. Rather, proof of 'continuity plus relationship' is necessary.
Summary
The passage explains the requirements for establishing a RICO violation
under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), which includes demonstrating that the defendant
conducted the affairs of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering
activity. The definition of an enterprise is broad and includes both legitimate
and illegitimate entities. The passage also clarifies that a pattern of
racketeering activity requires proof of "continuity plus relationship," which
aligns with the coordinated actions of Morgan and Daniel in executing their
fraudulent scheme.
