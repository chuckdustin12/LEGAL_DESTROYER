Question
Charles Dustin Myers
Answer
Assessment of Charles Dustin Myers as a Litigant
This assessment analyzes Charles Dustin Myers' litigation history based on nine cases found matching the search criteria. This limited sample size may not fully
represent his complete litigation experience.
Typical Role: Myers appears most frequently as a plaintiff or petitioner (e.g., JP01-24-OR00000002, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS vs. Margie Evonne Wilson;
02-25-00164-CV, In re Charles Dustin Myers, Relator), initiating legal action. However, he has also been a defendant (SC20-142J2, GEICO COUNTY MUTUAL
INSURANCE COMPANY vs CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS; 4:24-cv-01185, Myers v. Myers). This suggests a willingness to both pursue and defend legal claims.
Types of Cases: Myers' cases span various areas, including traffic violations (14-0135J2, State of Texas vs. Charles Myers; 14-0134J2, State of Texas vs.
Charles Myers), family law disputes (JP01-24-OR00000002, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS vs. Margie Evonne Wilson; 4:24-cv-01185, Myers v. Myers), and
mandamus proceedings (02-25-00164-CV, In re Charles Dustin Myers, Relator; 02-25-00166-CV, In re Charles Dustin Myers). The mandamus cases suggest a
tendency to challenge lower court decisions or seek to compel specific actions from officials. He also appears in a small claims case (SC20-142J2, GEICO
COUNTY MUTUAL INSURANCE COMPANY vs CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS) as a defendant.
Motion Practice Effectiveness: Myers demonstrates a proactive approach to motion practice, filing motions for emergency relief, writs, and notices of removal
(e.g., 4:24-cv-01185, Myers v. Myers; 25-0361, IN RE CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS). While he appears prepared in his filings, the ultimate success of his motions
is mixed. For instance, his removal attempt in 4:24-cv-01185, Myers v. Myers was unsuccessful due to jurisdictional issues. The mandamus cases, while
demonstrating initiative, lack sufficient information to assess their outcomes.
Average Case Duration: The analyzed cases have short durations, ranging from a single day to a few weeks. However, this is likely skewed by the inclusion of
traffic cases and the limited information available on the mandamus proceedings. Without complete disposition information on all cases, comparing his average
case duration to industry averages is difficult.
Success Rate and Notable Outcomes: Determining a definitive success rate is challenging due to the limited sample size and lack of clear outcomes in several
cases. However, the unsuccessful removal attempt in 4:24-cv-01185, Myers v. Myers and the denial of the writ of re-entry in JP01-24-OR00000002, CHARLES
DUSTIN MYERS vs. Margie Evonne Wilson indicate some setbacks. The traffic cases resulted in guilty pleas or findings.
Case Endings: The majority of the analyzed cases ended with a plea (traffic), court order (mandamus, removal), or denial of a motion (writ of re-entry). There is
no indication of any cases proceeding to trial in this sample.
Most Significant Cases: The mandamus cases (02-25-00164-CV, In re Charles Dustin Myers, Relator; 02-25-00166-CV, In re Charles Dustin Myers; 25-0361,
IN RE CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS) are potentially significant as they involve challenges to legal processes or official actions. The family law case
(JP01-24-OR00000002, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS vs. Margie Evonne Wilson) and the removal case (4:24-cv-01185, Myers v. Myers) also offer insights into
his litigation approach in different contexts.
Attorneys/Law Firms: While the data identifies some attorneys involved in Myers' cases, there isn't enough information to discern a consistent pattern or
preferred firm for specific case types. Cooper Carter appears frequently, suggesting a potential working relationship.
Expert Witnesses: There is no evidence of expert witness involvement in the analyzed cases.
Additional Insights: Myers appears involved in a range of legal matters, often taking a proactive role. He appears comfortable navigating different courts and
legal procedures. However, the limited data makes it difficult to draw definitive conclusions about his overall litigation success or predict future behavior. Further
investigation is recommended when facing him in litigation.

Myers v. Myers
Extract
Summary
Role: Charles Dustin Myers is identified as the Defendant in the case, as indicated by his role in the docket entries, including the Notice of Removal filed by him.
Additionally, he is listed as a Defendant among the case parties, while Morgan Michelle Myers is designated as the Plaintiff. This establishes the clear roles of
each party within the context of the legal proceedings.
Status: The case has been closed as of December 6, 2024, when the court issued an order remanding the case back to the 322nd Judicial District Court of
Tarrant County, Texas, for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Subsequent docket entries confirm the delivery of the remand notice and indicate no further actions
are pending in this court.
Background: The cause of action in this case is a Notice of Removal filed under 28 U.S.C. § 1441. The factual background suggests that the case was initially
filed in the 322nd Judicial District Court of Tarrant County, Texas, and was subsequently removed by Defendant Charles Dustin Myers to federal court, although
the federal court ultimately determined it lacked subject matter jurisdiction, leading to the remand of the case back to state court.
Motion practice: Charles Dustin Myers, as a Defendant in this case, demonstrated a proactive legal strategy by filing a Notice of Removal on December 4, 2024,
complete with a filing fee and extensive attachments, indicating his intent to transfer the case from state to federal court. However, this effort was short-lived, as
the case was remanded back to the 322nd Judicial District Court of Tarrant County, Texas, on December 6, 2024, due to a determination of lack of subject matter
jurisdiction, highlighting the challenges faced in jurisdictional matters.
Duration: The case was filed on December 4, 2024, and terminated just two days later on December 6, 2024. Therefore, the total duration of the case from start
to finish was 2 days.
Outcome: The case was remanded to the 322nd Judicial District Court of Tarrant County, Texas, due to a lack of subject matter jurisdiction, as ordered by Judge
Reed C. O'Connor on December 6, 2024. The Clerk of Court was directed to return the case following standard protocol, and the case is now officially closed.
Complexity: The case involves a Notice of Removal filed by Charles Dustin Myers, indicating a procedural complexity typically associated with jurisdictional
issues. The court subsequently issued an order remanding the case back to the state court for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, suggesting that the initial
removal was contested or improperly filed. This indicates a moderate level of complexity, primarily revolving around jurisdictional matters rather than substantive
legal disputes. The case is now closed, having been returned to the original court.
Experts: The docket does not mention the involvement of any experts in the case, nor does it provide any indication that experts were hired by Charles Dustin
Myers or any other party. The entries primarily focus on procedural matters related to the notice of removal and subsequent remand to state court.
Monetary value: The docket entries do not specify a monetary amount associated with the case, nor do they provide sufficient details to infer a rough estimate.
The only financial detail mentioned is the payment of a filing fee of $405.00, which suggests that the case may not involve a significant monetary claim.

Summary
Role: Charles Dustin Myers is designated as the Petitioner in this case, indicating that he is the Plaintiff. The docket entries reflect his active role in filing
applications and participating in hearings related to the Writ of Re-Entry, underscoring his position as the party initiating the action against Margie Evonne Wilson,
the Respondent.
Status: The docket indicates that the case has been finalized, suggesting that it has concluded. However, recent entries, including a writ of re-entry denial and
ongoing hearings, imply that there may still be unresolved matters or post-judgment activities taking place. Therefore, while the status is marked as finalized, the
case may not be fully closed in practice due to pending issues.
Background: The cause of action in this case appears to be related to a Writ of Re-Entry, as evidenced by the application filed on 03/06/2024 and subsequent
hearings regarding its denial due to lack of jurisdiction. The factual background indicates that the case involves a family law matter with standing orders pending
from the 322nd District Court, and exhibits filed include various orders and notices pertaining to eviction and jurisdictional issues.
Motion practice: Charles Dustin Myers, as the Petitioner in this family law case, filed both an Application for Writ of Re-Entry and an Application for Writ of
Retrieval on March 6, 2024. He participated in a special hearing on March 8, 2024, via Zoom, where the writ of re-entry was denied due to lack of jurisdiction, as
explained by the judge. Multiple exhibits were filed in support of his motions, including prior court orders and notices related to the case. The ongoing proceedings
in the 322nd District Court and the standing orders further complicate his request for relief regarding property possession.
Duration: The case lasted from March 6, 2024, when the application for the writs was filed, until March 8, 2024, when the writ of re-entry was denied by the
judge. This indicates a duration of just two days from the filing to the conclusion of the initial proceedings.

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Outcome: The court denied the plaintiff's application for a writ of re-entry due to lack of jurisdiction, as explained by the judge during a special hearing held via
Zoom on March 8, 2024. The case involved family law matters with standing orders pending from the 322nd District Court. The case has been finalized following
this ruling.
Complexity: The case appears to be moderately complex, involving a Writ of Re-Entry with jurisdictional issues and multiple hearings, including a special hearing
via Zoom. There are several exhibits filed, including motions for summary judgment and emergency motions, indicating a contested legal matter. The case also
references orders from the 322nd District Court, suggesting ongoing family law implications and procedural intricacies that necessitate careful navigation of
jurisdictional challenges.
Experts: There is no indication of any experts being involved in the case, as the docket entries do not reference expert testimony or reports. The Petitioner,
Charles Dustin Myers, filed applications for writs related to property possession but did not present any expert evidence during the proceedings. The writ of
re-entry was denied due to a lack of jurisdiction, highlighting the procedural complexities of the ongoing family law matters in the 322nd District Court.
Monetary value: The docket entries indicate that this case involves a writ of re-entry and related hearings concerning jurisdiction and eviction matters, typically
associated with family law disputes. However, there are no specific monetary amounts mentioned in the entries; thus, it is difficult to estimate the financial stakes
involved. Given the nature of eviction proceedings and potential claims for damages or legal fees, a rough estimate could suggest the case might involve several
thousand dollars, depending on the complexity and duration of the proceedings.

entries only reflect the filing of an affidavit, a record, and the petition for a writ of mandamus on the same date, without reference to expert involvement.
Monetary value: The docket entries indicate that a petition for writ of mandamus was filed, but there are no specific monetary claims or amounts mentioned.
Without additional context or details about the nature of the case, it is difficult to estimate a monetary value, but cases involving writs of mandamus typically do
not involve large sums; they often pertain to procedural or administrative issues rather than direct financial claims. As such, this case may be viewed as relatively
modest in terms of monetary perspective, likely under $100,000.
