Plaintiff incorporates by reference public records from the Texas Supreme
Court, and requests the court to take judicial notice of these documents. The
Fifth Circuit has repeatedly held that it is proper for federal courts to take
judicial notice of matters of public record, including documents filed in state
court proceedings (Miller v. Dunn, 35 F.4th 1007 (5th Cir. 2022); LUV N'
Care, Ltd. v. Jackel Int'l Ltd., 502 F.Supp.3d 1106 (W.D. La. 2020); Wright v.
Arlington Indep. Sch. Dist., Civil Action No. 4:19-cv-00278-P (N.D. Tex. Nov
25, 2019)). Plaintiff therefore requests that this Court take judicial
knowledge of the consolidated mandamus record, as its’ authenticity is not
reasonably disputed. Here, all record references point to the public
consolidated mandamus record, as submitted to the Texas Supreme Court, a
copy of which has been served upon each defendant named in this complaint
either individually or through their agent. Link to the record: https://

bc41-bbc08c814365 All references to the record are marked herein with
“REC. [page]” and are hyperlinked to take the reader directly to the
reference. The record is filed under affidavit, and remains unopposed at the
time of filing this complaint. Therefore, Plaintiff respectfully asks that the
Court take judicial notice of the record under Federal Rule of Evidence 201,
filed on June 6, 2025, in the Texas Supreme Court under case numbers
25-0361, 25-0367, 25-0378, 25-0426, and 25-0458. II. TIMELINE OF
EVENTS BACKGROUND Morgan Michelle Myers, (“Myers”) and Charles
Dustin Myers, (“Plaintiff”) were married on June 20, 2015, and have two
daughters, C.R.M. and M.E.M, aged seven and nine. The evidence in this
case will show that in early December of 2023, the entire family was
blindsided by Myers’ sudden announcement that she wanted a divorce from
Plaintiff. REC. 717 The evidence will further show that Myers’ reasoning for
this divorce changes over time – beginning with how Plaintiff spoke to her,
and then switches to abuse and sexual harassment, and allegations of drug
abuse, claims that were only brought up in her initial pleadings. On
December 12, 2023, Plaintiff discovered a large volume of text messages
between Myers and two individuals identified as Debbie Price and Damen
Kazlauskas of Fort Worth, Texas spanning between October 2022 and
December 2023. REC. 254-714 In response to this discovery, Myers began to
communicate with Defendant Daniel Kenneth Branthoover, a resident of
Yukon, Oklahoma, who assisted her in the planning, drafting, traveling, and
submitting of fraudulent documents to the 322nd District Court of Tarrant
County designed to divest Plaintiff of his home and business operations.
When these allegations were raised to the State, they failed to adjudicate
them and violated the Plaintiff’s constitutional rights when he was deprived
of the guarantees of equal protection under the law and when he was not
afforded due process before being deprived of his property. REC. 183. The
central question is whether Defendants Munford, Kaitcer, Carter, and Baker
are victims of the initial scheme – or willing participants in an expanded
associate-in-fact enterprise that began in December of 2023 as the Myers-
Branthoover enterprise. A. The Myers-Branthoover Enterprise 1. On
December 14, 2023, Defendants Morgan Michelle Myers (“Myers)” and
Daniel Kenneth Branthoover (“Branthoover”), acting in concert and under
deceptive pretenses, (REC. 1704), initiated text-message communications
through which they formed and advanced a common plan and agreement.
Over the weekend of December 15, 2023, they met in Yukon, Oklahoma, to
further that plan ( REC. 274-278). The deceptive text message from
Defendant Branthoover claiming that he wanted to assist Plaintiff was
following an attempt by Myers to receive an ex-parte order of protection
from the 322nd District Court of Tarrant county, attempted on December 14,
2023 (REC. 78). B. Interstate Travel and Transfer 2. As part of their
agreement, both Defendants planned to draft and submit an original petition
for divorce and an affidavit of indigency to the 322nd District Court of
Tarrant County, with the intended and foreseeable result of removing
Plaintiff from his matrimonial residence at 6641 Anne Court, Watauga, Texas
76148—which also serves as his place of business for clients in the United
States, Canada, and the United Kingdom that rely on his market data
services (REC. 812 ¶ 16). 3. During Defendant Myers’s interstate travel, she
transferred the parties’ marital funds into Defendant Branthoover’s PayPal
account in the amount of $1,576 (REC. 723). Those proceeds funded a
second mobile phone (817-940-0852), listed on the fraudulent pleadings that

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Myers and Branthoover jointly prepared in Oklahoma, which Myers then
carried from Yukon to Texas on December 17, 2023 (REC. 86; 99; 102; 107).
C. Admissions 4. On December 16, 2023, Plaintiff reached out to
Branthoover and requested that the $1,576 be returned as they were needed
for Christmas gifts for the children, and for business advertising expenses
for his business. REC. 728-729. In response, defendant Branthoover
admitted that the purpose of defendant Myers’ visit was to help her prepare
paperwork for divorce litigation and confirmed that the transfer of $1,576
did in fact occur. REC. 730. Plaintiff’s bank statement from December 2023
further confirms this transaction. REC. 723. D. Post-submission
Collaboration 5. On December 18, 2023, defendant Myers submitted the
fraudulently prepared original petition for divorce, and an affidavit of
indigency to the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County. After these
documents were submitted, defendant Branthoover sent a text message to
Plaintiff on December 19, 2023, at 5:50 P.M. CST, holding himself out to be
defendant Myers’ attorney, showing his involvement extends past the initial
help in preparing the fraudulent documents. REC. 1712-1713 6. Four days
later, on December 22, 2023, defendant Myers submitted another knowingly
fraudulent application for protective to the 322nd District Court of Tarrant
County claiming that family violence had occurred on December 18, 2023,
supported by both an affidavit and unsworn declaration. REC. 108-109. E.
Significant and Intentional Misrepresentations 7. On December 27 and
December 28, 2023, respectively, the documents prepared by Myers with
the assistance of Branthoover were served on Plaintiff via the U.S.
Constable, and contained the following misrepresentations: i. That
defendant Myers could not afford court costs; REC. 72, REC. 85-96 ii. That
defendant Myers had an active order of protection against the Plaintiff with
a finding of family violence that had occurred during the marriage; REC. 78
at 10 iii. That defendant Myers was financially responsible for the family
vehicles, rent payments, utilities, and other household expenses, making
herself appear as the primary breadwinner; REC. 92 iv. That defendant
Myers would be harassed or abused if Plaintiff were given her newly
acquired phone number that was obtained while in Oklahoma; REC. 81 at
15. v. That defendant Myers and Plaintiff ceased living together on
December 1, 2023; REC. 74 at 4 vi. That family violence occurred on
December 18, 2023, in the presence of the two Children. REC. 108-109. vii.
That both family vehicles were defendant Myers’ separate property acquired
before marriage. REC. 79 at 11B F. Evidence to the Contrary 8. On the same
day Defendant Myers claimed to be in an emergency requiring the Plaintiff’s
prompt removal from the home, she can be seen at the home with Plaintiff
and the children in no state of emergency and also still cohabitating in the
marital home. REC 1715. 9. Again, on December 29, 2023, Defendant Myers
can be seen with Plaintiff at the family home, smiling and laughing with the
children in no state of emergency and still collaborating with Plaintiff in the
marital home. REC. 1735. 10. The citation for the application for protective
order ordered Respondent to show cause as to why it should not issue with a
hearing scheduled for January 16, 2024. REC. 118. 11. In response to
extensive misrepresentation above, Plaintiff prepared an original answer,
filed a motion to consolidate, and provided background information which
alleged that defendant Myers was intentionally abusing the legal process.
REC. 130-132. Plaintiff was ordered to show cause on January 16, 2024,
regarding the protective order application. REC. 118 G. Inclement Weather

and First Appearance 12. On January 15, 2024, the Tarrant County District
Courts Facebook page sent out a notice informing the members of the public
that the court would be closed on January 16, 2024, due to inclement
weather. REC. 1202. 13. Unaware of the closure at the time, the parties
appeared at the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County on January 16, 2024,
and were met with a dark courtroom, with only one judge in the building at
the time of their arrival – Defendant James Munford (“Munford”). 14.
Defendant Munford summarily ordered the Plaintiff out of his home,
inadvertently assisting the Myers-Branthoover associate-in-fact enterprise of
achieving their primary goal in having the Plaintiff removed from his
residence, despite the broader goal being to obtain a decree of divorce to
permanently divest Plaintiff of his interests. REC. 183. 15. Defendant
Munford’s initial order was baseless, made in the absence of any emergency,
without a hearing, and disregarded the Plaintiff’s pleadings, telling Myers
“you’re going to have to find evidence of family violence!” clearly aware that
this order was made without any regard to the Plaintiff’s constitutional
rights. 16. Defendant Jeffrey Kaitcer, (“Kaitcer”) walked into the courtroom
late due to the inclement weather and turned the courtroom into a laughing
matter as he began to joke with Defendant Munford, and instructed the
parties to download the AppClose app for communication, and the matter
was reset for January 22, 2024. There exists no record of this proceeding,
only marked appearances on the docket. H. Reset #1 – January 22, 2024,
Setting 17. At the January 22 reset hearing, the parties appeared only to
have the case reset once more because defendant Myers allegedly retained
the services of Defendant Cooper Carter, (“Carter”) in the lobby of the
courthouse just moments before the hearing was scheduled to begin. No
appearance can be traced to this setting by either party on the docket (REC.
1551), and once again, no hearing was held, and the case reset for a second
time to February 1, 2024. REC. 186. 18. Kaitcer permitted attorney Dan
Bacalis, Plaintiff’s prior attorney, to fill out the Associate Judge’s Report, and
the parties never went before him as indicated by the case docket’s lack of
appearance on this date by either party. I. Reset #2 – February 1, 2024,
Setting 19. One day prior to the February 1 setting, both attorneys,
Defendant Carter and Dan Bacalis, both amended the petition for divorce
and counterpetition for divorce without the parties’ knowledge. (REC. 189,
REC. 209) These amended documents were similar, submitted on the same
day, and raised concerns for Plaintiff regarding his quality of representation.
20. At the February 1 setting, both parties were in the conference rooms
outside of Defendant Kaitcer’s courtroom, when attorney Bacalis walks in
holding a settlement agreement. When Plaintiff refused this option and
requested that they go have a hearing before the judge. 21. This is when
Bacalis stated, as witness affidavits corroborate, that he “knows this Judge
and this is the best we can get.” and further stated “[w]e’ll be here all day.
We can come back and change it later.” 22. Outraged by this response,
Plaintiff paid very close attention to the settlement offer Bacalis was
pressuring him to sign, and noticed the following provisions: A typed written
Order conforming to this Report will follow within 20 days from the date this
Report is signed. The Temporary Order shall be prepared by DAN BACALIS.
Each attorney should approve the Order. The parties do not need to approve
the Order. The attorney reviewing the proposed Order shall have five (5)
days to do so. There arc no ten (JO) day letters. If an agreement is not
reached, a Motion to Sign shall be filed and set within thirty (30) days from

=== PAGE 5 ===

the signing of this Report. IT IS SO ORDERED (REC. 233) J. Termination of
Counsel and the Emergency Motion 23. With the above provisions in mind,
Plaintiff signed the document and immediately fired his attorney and
provided notice to the court. REC. 221. By doing so, Plaintiff gained access
back to the residency, invalidated the agreement, and was able to use the
time back in the house to run damage control on his business operations
while preparing to expose the Myers-Branthoover enterprise to the court via
a MOTION TO RECONSIDER EVIDENCE AND VACATE TEMPORARY
ORDERS, which was filed on February 9, 2024, within three business days of
the February 1 agreed associate judge’s report being served by the clerk.
REC. 240 24. In this motion, it was specifically stated that: i. “I am seeking
immediate court intervention to correct procedural e rrors and address the
misuse of the legal system by the Petitioner.” REC. 244 ii. “Particularly, Dan
Branthoover became involved. He is the boyfriend of the Petitioner’s Mother.
Shortly thereafter, I received a notice from our joint bank account stating
that $1,576 had just been withdrawn. As our bank statement for December
2023 will demonstrate – the transaction record shows the funds being
transferred directly to Mr. Branthoover’s PayPal account” REC. 245 iii. “The
Petitioner's action of filing for divorce under an Affidavit of Inability to pay
three days after transferring $1,576 to herself starkly contravenes the
mandates set forth in Chapter 10, Section 10.001 of the Civil Practice and
Remedies Code”. REC 247 at B2 iv. “The Petitioner violated Chapter 10,
Section 10.001 a second time within the same document when she
intentionally elected to waive the 60-day waiting period claiming to have an
active protective order against me that found family violence had occurred
during our marriage.” REC 247 at B3. v. “This suit was the second attempt
by the Petitioner to have me removed from the home, which ultimately
succeeded.” REC 248 at D1 25. The motion went on to explain the factual
pattern described up to this point, putting the court on notice of the key
issues with provided exhibits which were duly served on Carter. In response
to Plaintiff’s motion, he received the first of just two email communications
from Carter throughout the case’s history, where she claimed she would be
filing a counter motion when disclosing her availability for the hearing on
Plaintiff’s emergency motion. REC. 2794 No such countermotion was filed
by Carter. K. Summary Judgment and Notice of Hearing 26. By February 22,
no response had been filed by Carter, so Plaintiff filed a Partial Motion for
Summary Judgment. REC. 758. Plaintiff also submitted a proposed parenting
plan as Exhibit D. REC. 769. No response was ever received from Carter. 27.
On February 27, 2024, Defendant Munford signed and issued a notice of
hearing to the parties with the hearing set for March 14, 2024. REC. 776. L.
Plaintiff’s Notice to the Court and Defendant Myers’ Self-Help Remedies 28.
On March 3, 2024, Plaintiff notified the Court that he would not be leaving
the home as it was not in the best interests of his children. REC. 782. 29.
The following day, on March 6, 2024, while walking his daughters to school,
Myers ran inside the family home, and locked him out of the marital
residence, leaving a sign on the door that said “[y]ou should have been out
by Saturday you are now locked out!” REC. 1748. 30. Plaintiff called local
law enforcement to help him regain entry into the home, where mother
produced the agreed associate judge’s report signed on February 1, 2024,
and used it as a means to block Plaintiff’s entrance to the home. 31. To avoid
further conflict, Plaintiff was escorted into the home where he was able to
grab only his computer and a few clothes and went to Flower Mound to

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
temporarily stay with his father until the time of the hearing on his
emergency motion, scheduled for March 14, 2024, at 9:00 A.M. L. The
Hearing On Plaintiff’s Emergency Motion 32. On March 14, 2024, the
parties arrived at the 322nd District Court, and on the way into the
courtroom, defendants Myers and Carter could be seen in the conference
room, quickly shuffling papers back and forth. 33. After checking in with the
bailiff, Plaintiff turned around to see defendant Carter extending to him a
document titled “Temporary Orders” that were the reduced version of the
February 1 associate judge’s report. REC. 888. 34. These orders, which were
not prepared by Dan Bacalis, which were not agreed to by the parties, were
reduced well outside of the 20-day requirement as ordered by the judge, and
which were never filed with the clerk, stated the following
misrepresentations: i. On February 1, 2024, the Court heard Petitioner's
motion for temporary orders. ii. The parties have agreed to the terms of this
order as evidenced by the signatures below. REC. 888. iii. The Court, after
examining the record and the agreement of the parties and hearing the
evidence and argument of counsel, finds that all necessary prerequisites of
the law have been legally satisfied and that the Court has jurisdiction of this
case and of all the parties. REC. 888. iv. The dates that the parties would
have access to the family residence was altered, changing the date Plaintiff
was supposed to leave from March 1, 2024, to March 20, 2024, and
changing Myers’ date of re-entry from March 1, 2024, to March 30, 2024,
leaving a 10-day window where no one would occupy the residence. v. This
modification was made to prevent Myers from being liable for illegally
locking Plaintiff out of the home on March 6, 2024. 35. On the last page of
the orders, Plaintiff’s attorney who was terminated weeks earlier did not
sign the document, and Plaintiff refused to sign the document for the
forthcoming reasons: i. It claimed a hearing occurred on a motion which was
never set for a hearing or served on the Plaintiff and doesn’t exist on the
docket. ii. It was prepared by defendant Carter, not Dan Bacalis. iii. The
associate judge was presiding over a de novo request of his own prior
report. iv. The matrimonial address was incorrect, as it stated “6641 Anns
Court”, rather than 6641 Anne Court. REC. 915, REC. 922 v. The orders
were not in the best interests of the children. vi. Notwithstanding the
Plaintiff’s revocation of consent by filing the emergency motion, the terms
were altered right before they were rendered into effect by defendant
Kaitcer. vii. Plaintiff did not agree to the terms as he was in court that very
day to expose Myers. M. Predicate Acts: Extortion 36. Kaitcer, knowing that
no response was filed, knowing that he was presiding over a hearing to
which he had no subject matter jurisdiction, and knowing that the temporary
orders produced by defendant Carter was served just moments earlier,
signed another associate judge’s report pre-drafted by defendant Carter,
which summarily denied the Plaintiff’s emergency motion, ignored the fact
that Carter had not provided a response, and within the report itself,
Plaintiff was ordered to sign the document that Carter had just presented to
him despite raising objections to its’ contents, and despite his consent not
being present. REC. 795. 37. Finally, defendant Kaitcer refused to consider
Plaintiff’s exhibits, including six affidavits prepared by his business clients
who have been directly affected by his inability to provide the real-time
market data services his clients relied on, who were located throughout the
United States. REC. 851; REC. 854; REC. 857; REC. 860; REC. 863; REC.
867; REC. 870. 38. Following the setting, the orders were rendered into

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
effect without Plaintiff’s signature (REC. 925) , and Plaintiff filed a request
for findings of fact and conclusions of law (REC. 883), and filed and
amended a “Preparatory Notice for Judicial Review” which recounted the
factual timeline up to that point, and included the affidavits that Kaitcer
refused to accept on March 14, 2024. REC. 798, REC. 851, REC. 854, REC.
857, REC. 860, REC. 863, REC. 867, REC. 870. 39. The orders stated they
were to remain in effect until the final decree of divorce, and Plaintiff’s
journey of one-sided appeals began. N. One Sided Appellate Efforts, and
Defective IWO 40. Following the rendition of the temporary orders on March
26, 2024, Plaintiff spent between April 8, 2024 and September 15, 2024,
appealing via mandamus to the Second Court of Appeals and the Texas
Supreme Court. REC. 1010. 41. During the appellate efforts, Carter filed one
of two motions in the case, which was a motion for pre-trial conference filed
on April 24, 2024, on her behalf by Roderick D. Marx, a party not named in
the suit. REC. 1014, REC. 1016. 42. Plaintiff immediately objected to the
pre-trial conference, and no response was ever issued by Carter or the
court. REC. 1018. 43. On April 30th, Plaintiff filed his notice of completion
regarding the parenting course as ordered, despite actively trying to vacate
them. REC. 1047. No parenting course was ever completed by Myers. 44. On
May 2, 2024, Plaintiff’s en banc reconsideration was denied in the Second
Court of Appeals, and he began preparing an appeal to the Supreme Court
of Texas. REC. 1067. 45. On May 19, 2024, Carter sent the second and last
email correspondence that would be received in the case, which falsely
claimed he agreed to the orders signed on March 14, 2024, and requested
that he fill out an IWO, which Plaintiff found to be defective. REC. 1722,
REC. 1728. No further correspondence was received by Carter. O.
Fraudulent Intervention and Branthoover’s Continued Involvement 46. On
June 23rd Plaintiff filed a motion in state court entitled MOTION FOR
JOINDER OF PERSONS NEEDED FOR JUST ADJUDICATION at 12:14 P.M.
REC. 1075. This motion received no response from Carter. 47. On June 23rd
at 1:54 P.M., directly following the submission of the motion, Branthoover
texted Plaintiff stating “Lol. And here comes another denial. Please sue me
individually. Please.”, referring to the earlier filed motion and showing his
continued oversight of the case’s progression since his initial predicate acts.
48. Four days later, on June 28, 2024, the Texas Office of the Attorney
General allegedly filed an intervention pleading, claiming that Plaintiff was
past due on child support, and requested information from Plaintiff. REC.
1099. 49. Most notably, the certificate of service to this intervention
pleading was allegedly signed by Holly Hayes, the designated attorney for
the OAG, yet the name underneath the signature line reads CHOYA
BURKLEY. REC. 1102. 50. Plaintiff promptly objected to the intervention,
and never received any response from the OAG, Carter, or the court. REC.
1106. P. Supreme Court, Rule 12, and Emergency Temporary Orders 51. As
Plaintiff continued to appeal to the Supreme Court of Texas, all prosecution
came to an end in the trial court. It wasn’t until September 15, 2024, that
Plaintiff filed a first amended rehearing motion in the Texas Supreme Court,
(REC. 1136) and after noticing Carter’s lack of participation, he began to
question her authority given several ambiguities surrounding her
representation, and filed a rule 12 motion to show authority. REC. 1170. No
response was ever received to this motion from Carter. 52. At this point,
Plaintiff had been staying in Airbnb homes while he sought relief to ensure
he could remain close to his daughters during this time. On September 26,

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
2024, he filed and later amended an EMERGENCY MOTION FOR
TEMPORARY ORDERS and requested expedited relief by October 1, 2024,
as that was when Plaintiff was forced to move away from the area due to
cost of living being unsustainable. REC. 1184. No response was ever
received from Carter regarding this motion. 53. By October 1, Plaintiff had
no choice but to start pursuing administrative remedies, and thought the
court was biased against him given the case’s history up to that point. He
began to prepare a Joint Motion to Recuse defendants Munford and Kaitcer
and filed it with the clerk of the court on October 7, 2024. REC. 1197. Q.
Predicate Act: Wire Fraud 54. On October 8, 2024, Defendant Munford
signed and forwarded a “Joint Motion to Recuse” attached to his order of
referral to regional presiding judge David L. Evans but was notably missing
the exhibits and affidavit critical to the motion. REC. 1222 55. A copy of this
exchange was sent via defendant Baker on 4:43 P.M. on October 8. REC.
1254 56. Plaintiff immediately pointed out the discrepancies between the
motion filed and the motion forwarded to David L. Evans, where she replied
and admitted that the full document had been e-filed and remains with the
court. REC. 1255 57. Unsatisfied with this response, Plaintiff further pointed
out that the filing size of the document filed and the one referring to David
L. Evans was significantly different. No further correspondence was
received by Baker until the following day. REC. 1256 58. The following day
on October 8, 2024, defendant Munford signed and filed an “Amended Order
of Referral” which had the full motion attached this time, albeit still
modified as the hyperlinks and bookmarks had been removed. REC. 1282 59.
This amended referral was sent via email correspondence by Baker at 11:17
A.M. on October 8, 2024, who stated that due to the size of the motion, it
was split into three parts. REC. 1258. This excuse directly contradicts the
standard filing procedure in Tarrant County, which was raised and
subsequently ignored in an objection. REC. 1269. No response was filed in
regard to the motion to recuse or objection by Carter. R. Recusal Denial and
More Delays, and Federal Removal 60. Justice E. Lee Gabriel was assigned
to hear the motion, which had to be rescheduled due to technical difficulties
for November 7, 2024. REC. 1306. 61. The morning of the hearing, Plaintiff
woke up with a dental emergency, and promptly notified all parties, and
requested a reset for the hearing, which everyone agreed to. REC.
1393-1396. 62. Despite this agreement, the recusal was denied for failure to
appear, and made no mention of the agreement or the emergency. REC.
1398. 63. With no other remedies left, Plaintiff removed the case to Federal
Court on December 2, 2024, which was quickly remanded back on
December 4, 2024. REC. 1426. 64. On December 14, 2024, defendant
Branthoover texted Plaintiff, sending a threat which stated “[w]hen things
all over, you get to deal with me.” at 2:15 P.M. REC. 1720 65. On December
16, 2024, Plaintiff initiated suit against Daniel Kenneth Branthoover in the
Western District of Oklahoma seeking relief in the form of damages from the
ongoing deprivation from his home. REC. 1451. 66. Plaintiff notified the
Texas court of this lawsuit on December 31, 2024. REC. 1446. S. Further
Delays, Motion to Dismiss for Want of Prosecution, and the Original SAPCR
67. On January 24, 2025, Plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss for want of
prosecution due to the total lack of participation in the case by the opposing
party. REC. 1527. No response was ever received from Carter on this
motion. 68. On January 29, 2025, defendant Myers began disposing of
Plaintiff’s personal belongings that remained on the family property. REC.

=== PAGE 9 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
1629-1631. 69. On February 12, 2025, Plaintiff learned that his youngest
daughter was suffering from dental pain due to Myers’ failure to obtain
dental insurance for the children. REC. 3281. 70. By March 14, (REC.
1833-1837) the judges had still not been reinstated from the first recusal,
which lad Plaintiff to reach out to Baker to request a hearing on his
unopposed summary judgment that had been on the docket since February
22, 2024, where he had to remind her to reinstate the judges back into the
case. REC. 1833-1837. 71. Given the delays, and since the case had been
brought in bad faith initially, the Plaintiff opened an original SAPCR suit in
the 233rd District Court of Tarrant County on March 18, 2025, where he
argued for dominant jurisdiction in a cover letter sent to the clerk. REC.
2260. T. Counsel Suddenly Becomes Active 72. The very next day, defendant
Carter filed an original answer filed on her behalf by Roderick Marx. REC.
2279. The motion was a boilerplate motion, and was followed by a motion to
consolidate, which was filed in the wrong court, and was also filed on
Carter’s behalf by RODERICK D. MARX. REC. 2284. 73. The Plaintiff
immediately responded by filing a motion to strike (REC. 1957) a Rule 12
motion to show authority challenging both Carter and RODERICK D MARX’s
authority (REC. 2288) and on March 24, 2025, an emergency ex-parte TRO
to prevent Myers from barring Plaintiff’s access to the home. (REC. 2302)
No responses were ever received from Carter on these motions. 74. On
March 26, 2025, an objection was filed to Carter’s consolidation motion in
the 233rd court. REC. 1881. 75. Plaintiff reached out to the coordinator from
the 233rd and went through the process to present the motion to the judge.
REC. 2338-2341. 76. On March 29, 2025, Plaintiff appeared before Associate
Judge Kate Stone, who refused to hear Plaintiff’s emergency motion despite
no response being filed, and told him to leave the courtroom. The hearing
date scheduled for April 10, 2025, as agreed by Carter and Plaintiff (REC.
2358), was actually un-set by Stone. REC. 2361. 77. The grounds for this
outright refusal was due to Carter calling in a favor from the judge without
even being present in the courtroom, to where Stone left the room, came
back, and told the Plaintiff to leave informing him that a motion to
consolidate would be filed by Carter the following week. U. Five Concurrent
Mandamus Petitions 78. Subsequently, after he was turned away from the
courtroom, Carter’s consolidation motion wasn’t filed until April 4, 2025
(REC. 2367), resulting in two mandamus petitions to try again to have the
March 14, 2024, order signed by Kaitcer vacated, and to compel Kate Stone
to hear the emergency TRO. See 25-0361, 25-0367. 79. On the same day the
mandamus was filed against Stone, District Judge Kenneth Newell sua
sponte granted Carter’s consolidation motion in both courts without a
hearing, and without addressing the emergency situation for the children or
the Plaintiff’s objections, leading to a third mandamus proceeding. REC.
2393, See also 25-0378. 80. On April 23, 2025, a notice of trial setting was
served on the parties by defendant Munford in the midst of all of these
issues. REC. 1773. 81. The same day, Plaintiff filed an objection and
requested an emergency stay. REC. 2219. No response was received to this
objection by either Munford or Carter. 82. Two days later on April 25, 2025,
Plaintiff filed his second recusal motion, and amended it on April 28, 2025,
this time only against Munford, and requested that the rules of procedure be
followed, and objected to the involvement of the court coordinator given the
prior recusal’s ambiguity and significant delays caused by her involvement.
REC. 2488 No response to this motion was ever filed from Carter. 83. Baker

=== PAGE 10 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
continued to be involved in the recusal process, this time erroneously
forwarding an order of referral from defendant Kaitcer, who was not named
in the recusal motion. REC. 2615. 84. Plaintiff immediately objected on April
29, 2025, naming two issues: 1) the coordinator was still involved, and 2) the
order of referral sent by Kaitcer was erroneous. REC. 2620. 84. Plaintiff
objected to the order of assignment of John H. Cayce (REC. 3149) which was
issued on May 7, 2025, due to the unresolves issues. REC. 2620. 85. David L.
Evans overruled this objection on May 15, 2025, leading to mandamus
petition 25-0426, a direct appeal to the Texas Supreme Court. REC. 3507.
86. On May 20, 2025, John H. Cayce summarily denied the recusal, including
the denial of a motion to recuse Kaitcer which was never filed, leading to
mandamus petition 25-0458, a second direct appeal to the Texas Supreme
Court. 87. All five petitions were denied both initially and on rehearing, and
all emergency motions to stay proceedings were dismissed. The only insights
given from the appellate courts was: “Denied, per curiam.” No response was
filed by any implicated judge or opposing counsel. V. Federal RICO Case and
the Push Towards Final Trial 88. In June of 2025, Plaintiff amended his
complaint against Daniel Kenneth Branthoover and enjoined Myers as a
defendant, which they defended pro-se. 89. Plaintiff communicated this
action with the trial court, and no further action was taken in the case until
August of 2025, when defendant Munford sua sponte set the case for final
trial on December 10, 2025. 90. Plaintiff immediately objected to this trial
setting, and moved to recuse Munford for a third time. 91. The court
coordinator continued to be involved in the process, leading to a subsequent
motion to recuse the regional presiding judge, David L. Evans. 92. Plaintiff
now prepares this suit to hold defendants accountable for their collective
actions, and to prevent their common goal from being achieved, which is to
obtain defendant Myers a final decree of divorce. 93. For the forthcoming
reasons, the conduct outlined herein constitutes conduct of an enterprise
through a pattern of racketeering activity, as several predicate acts were
committed, the enterprise shares a common purpose, and Plaintiff has
suffered direct and ongoing injury to business and property as a direct result
of the defendant’s collective predicate acts. RICO The timeline and evidence
provided demonstrate that the Myers-Branthoover group constitutes an
association-in-fact enterprise under RICO, with a common goal to deprive
the Plaintiff of his home and business through a pattern of racketeering
activity—specifically, wire fraud, Travel Act violations, and fraudulent court
filings—causing direct injury to the Plaintiff’s business and property. The
conduct, structure, and continuity among the participants, as well as the use
of interstate communications and travel, satisfy the elements of a RICO
claim in the Tenth Circuit, with the liability of other defendants depending
on their knowledge and intent. A. Summary The Myers-Branthoover
enterprise, as detailed in the factual timeline, meets the Tenth Circuit’s
requirements for a RICO claim by establishing an association-in-fact
enterprise with a defined structure, purpose, and continuity. The group’s
coordinated actions—including interstate transfer of funds, preparation and
submission of fraudulent legal documents, and ongoing manipulation of
court proceedings—constitute a pattern of racketeering activity, with
predicate acts of wire fraud and Travel Act violations that are related and
continuous. Plaintiff’s direct and ongoing injury to his business and property,
including loss of home, business operations, and client relationships, is
proximately caused by the enterprise’s acts. While Myers and Branthoover’s

=== PAGE 11 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
liability is clear, the involvement of other defendants (Munford, Kaitcer,
Carter, and Baker) may be characterized as inadvertent or willing
participation, depending on their knowledge and intent, but the core
elements of a RICO violation are satisfied by the conduct of Myers and
Branthoover as outlined in the enumerated timeline. The additional acts
committed by each defendant, as alleged, furthered the scheme of the
enterprise despite each additional defendant having actual knowledge of the
fraudulent scheme. RICO Statutory Framework The Racketeer Influenced
and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), codified at 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961–1968,
provides a civil cause of action for individuals injured in their business or
property by reason of a pattern of racketeering activity conducted through
an enterprise affecting interstate or foreign commerce. The most commonly
invoked provision, § 1962(c), prohibits any person employed by or associated
with an enterprise from conducting or participating in the conduct of such
enterprise’s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity. Section
1962(d) further prohibits conspiracies to violate any of the substantive RICO
provisions. To establish a civil RICO claim under § 1962(c), a plaintiff must
prove: i. The existence of an enterprise; ii. The enterprise’s engagement in,
or effect on, interstate or foreign commerce; iii. The defendant’s
employment by or association with the enterprise; iv. The defendant’s
participation, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of the enterprise’s affairs;
v. The defendant’s participation through a pattern of racketeering activity or
collection of unlawful debt. See 100 Mount Holly Bypass v. Axos Bank, Case
No. 2:20-CV-856-TS-CMR (D. Utah Jul 27, 2021). B. Predicate Acts and
Pattern Requirement RICO defines “racketeering activity” to include a wide
range of criminal offenses, including wire fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343) and
violations of the Travel Act (18 U.S.C. § 1952). A “pattern of racketeering
activity” requires at least two predicate acts within a ten-year period, but
the acts must be related and amount to or pose a threat of continued
criminal activity. The Supreme Court has clarified that a RICO violation
requires both an “enterprise” and a “pattern of racketeering activity,” with
the enterprise being a group of persons associated for a common purpose,
and the pattern involving a series of criminal acts (United States v. Harris,
695 F.3d 1125 (10th Cir. 2012)). The Tenth Circuit has further explained
that, to establish a pattern, it is not enough to simply show that two
predicate acts occurred within ten years; the acts must also be related and
pose a threat of continued criminal activity (U.S. v. Smith, 413 F.3d 1253
(10th Cir. 2005)). Note, however, that U.S. v. Smith has been stated as
overruled by United States v. Nissen, 555 F.Supp.3d 1174 (D. N.M. 2021) on
unrelated grounds, but its articulation of the pattern requirement remains
consistent with current law. C. Enterprise and Association-in-Fact An
“enterprise” under RICO includes any individual, partnership, corporation,
association, or group of individuals associated in fact, even if not a legal
entity. For an association-in-fact enterprise, the Tenth Circuit requires: i. A
purpose; ii. Relationships among those associated with the enterprise; iii.
Longevity sufficient to permit the associates to pursue the enterprise’s
purpose; iv. A decision-making framework or mechanism for controlling the
group; v. Functioning as a continuing unit; vi. Existence separate and apart
from the pattern of racketeering activity. See 100 Mount Holly Bypass. D.
Conspiracy Section 1962(d) makes it unlawful to conspire to violate any of
the substantive RICO provisions. A RICO conspiracy does not require the
establishment of an enterprise but requires that a defendant adopts the goal

=== PAGE 12 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
of furthering or facilitating a criminal endeavor that would satisfy the
elements of a substantive RICO offense (United States v. Martinez, 543
F.Supp.3d 1209 (D. N.M. 2021); United States v. Randall, 661 F.3d 1291
(10th Cir. 2011)). E. Injury Requirement RICO provides a private right of
action for individuals injured in their business or property through
fraudulent conduct, and there is no requirement that the conduct be
connected to organized crime in a civil setting (Plains Resources, Inc. v.
Gable, 782 F.2d 883 (10th Cir. 1986)). ANALYSIS F. Existence of an
Association-in-Fact Enterprise The timeline establishes that Myers and
Branthoover formed an association-in-fact enterprise beginning in December
2023 (¶¶ 1–7, 93). Their collaboration was structured, with Myers as the
petitioner in the divorce and Branthoover as the planner, drafter, and
facilitator of fraudulent documents and financial transactions. The group
had a clear purpose: to divest the Plaintiff of his home and business through
fraudulent legal filings and manipulation of court processes (¶¶ 1–7, 93).
The enterprise’s structure is evidenced by: i. The initial planning and
agreement to meet in Yukon, Oklahoma, to draft fraudulent documents (¶¶
1–3); ii. The use of interstate communications and travel to further the
scheme (¶¶ 2–3); iii. Ongoing coordination and adaptation to changing
circumstances, including the preparation and submission of false affidavits
and pleadings, and manipulation of court proceedings (¶¶ 5–7, 34, 93). This
satisfies the Tenth Circuit’s requirements for an association-in-fact
enterprise, which does not require a formal legal entity but does require a
common purpose, relationships, and sufficient longevity to pursue the
enterprise’s goals. G. Structure, Purpose, Relationships, and Continuity The
Myers-Branthoover group meets the requirements for an association-in-fact
enterprise: i. Purpose: The shared goal was to deprive the Plaintiff of his
home, business, and property interests through fraudulent means (¶¶ 1–7,
93). ii. Relationships: Myers and Branthoover maintained ongoing
communications, coordinated actions, and divided roles in the scheme (¶¶ 1–
7, 93). iii. Longevity and Continuity: The enterprise operated over a
substantial period, from at least December 2023 through present day 2025,
with multiple related acts and ongoing adaptation to changing
circumstances (¶¶ 1–93). iv. Decision-Making Framework: The group
planned, agreed on steps, and executed those steps in a coordinated manner
(¶¶ 1–7, 93). v. Existence Separate from Predicate Acts: The enterprise was
formed for the purpose of achieving a specific goal and engaged in multiple
acts over time to accomplish that goal. H. Predicate Acts: Wire Fraud, Travel
Act Violations, and Fraudulent Filings The timeline identifies multiple
predicate acts that qualify as racketeering activity under RICO: i. Wire
Fraud: Myers transferred $1,576 in marital funds to Branthoover’s PayPal
account during interstate travel, and these funds were used to purchase a
phone for use in the fraudulent scheme (¶¶ 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 34). The use of
electronic communications (text messages, emails) to plan and execute the
scheme further supports the wire fraud allegation (¶¶ 1–7, 34). ii. Travel Act
Violations: Myers traveled from Texas to Oklahoma to meet with
Branthoover, where they planned and prepared fraudulent legal documents,
which were then transported back to Texas and submitted to the court (¶¶ 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, 7). iii. Fraudulent Filings: The preparation and submission of false
affidavits and pleadings to the court, containing material misrepresentations
about financial status, family violence, and property ownership, constitute
further predicate acts (¶¶ 5, 6, 7, 34). At least two related predicate acts

=== PAGE 13 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
within ten years are required (U.S. v. Smith, 413 F.3d 1253 (10th Cir. 2005)),
and the timeline shows multiple, related predicate acts over a substantial
period (¶¶ 1–93). I. Pattern of Racketeering Activity: Relatedness and
Continuity The predicate acts were not isolated incidents but part of an
ongoing scheme. The acts were related in that they all aimed to deprive the
Plaintiff of his property and business, and they posed a threat of continued
criminal activity, as the enterprise continued to operate and adapt its tactics
over time (¶¶ 1–93). The timeline shows that the enterprise’s activities
extended over a substantial period, with multiple acts occurring over
months and involving ongoing coordination and adaptation to changing
circumstances. J. Injury to Business or Property Plaintiff suffered direct and
ongoing injury to his business and property as a result of the enterprise’s
actions. He was deprived of his home and business operations, lost access to
marital funds, and was unable to provide services to clients, resulting in
financial harm (¶¶ 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 37). These injuries are precisely the type
of harm RICO is designed to redress. Plains Resources, Inc. v. Gable, 782 F.
2d 883 (10th Cir. 1986)). K. Participation of Other Defendants: Inadvertent
or Willing The timeline raises the question of whether Munford, Kaitcer,
Carter, and Baker were victims of the initial scheme or willing participants
in the expanded enterprise. The evidence suggests that, at a minimum,
Myers and Branthoover were the core members of the enterprise, with
others potentially becoming involved through their actions in the legal
proceedings (¶¶ 14–93). i. Inadvertent Participation: Some defendants may
have participated inadvertently, such as by issuing orders or facilitating
court processes without knowledge of the underlying scheme (¶¶ 14–93). ii.
Willing Participation: Others may have become willing participants if they
knowingly furthered the enterprise’s objectives or ignored clear evidence of
fraud and misrepresentation (¶¶ 14–93). RICO does not impose liability for
inadvertent or unwitting participation; there must be knowing and willful
involvement in the conduct of the enterprise’s affairs. For the forthcoming
reasons, Plaintiff alleges that the Defendants are willing participants in the
scheme. VICTIM OR PARTICIPANT RICO liability extends to those who
knowingly participate in the conduct of the enterprise’s affairs, even if they
were not original members (RICO: A Primer (2022-01-31)). The timeline
raises the question of whether Munford, Kaitcer, Carter, and Baker were
victims of the initial scheme or willing participants in the expanded
enterprise. The evidence suggests that, at a minimum, Myers and
Branthoover were the core members of the enterprise, with others becoming
involved through their actions in the legal proceedings (¶¶ 14–93). The
timeline demonstrates that Carter, Kaitcer, and Myers engaged in extortion
by leveraging the threat of adverse legal action, fraudulent court orders, and
the manipulation of judicial process to coerce Plaintiff into relinquishing
property and business interests, satisfying the elements of extortion as a
predicate act under RICO and the Travel Act. Munford and Baker, for their
part, committed wire fraud by intentionally sending altered or incomplete
court documents via interstate email, with the intent to mislead, obstruct
relief, and further the enterprise’s objective of finalizing the divorce and
depriving Plaintiff of his property, thus meeting the requirements for wire
fraud as a RICO predicate act. These acts, as detailed in the timeline, are
not isolated but part of a coordinated pattern of racketeering activity within
an association-in-fact enterprise, as required by RICO in the Tenth Circuit.
The conduct of each defendant is tied to specific predicate acts—extortion

=== PAGE 14 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
for Carter, Kaitcer, and Myers (notably at timeline events 33–37), and wire
fraud for Munford and Baker (notably at events 54–59, 83)—demonstrating
knowing and willful participation in the enterprise’s broader scheme to
deprive Plaintiff of his home and business through fraudulent and coercive
means. A. Extortion and Wire Fraud The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961–1968, provides a civil cause of
action for injury to business or property caused by a pattern of racketeering
activity conducted through an enterprise affecting interstate commerce.
Predicate acts under RICO include extortion (as defined by the Hobbs Act
and the Travel Act) and wire fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343), among others.
Extortion is defined as obtaining property from another, with his consent,
induced by wrongful use of actual or threatened force, violence, or fear, or
under color of official right. The Travel Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1952, includes
extortion as an “unlawful activity” and does not require it to be part of a
business enterprise (U.S. v. Welch, 327 F.3d 1081 (10th Cir. 2003)). The
Tenth Circuit recognizes that extortion under the Travel Act can be
established by showing threats or coercion to obtain something of value,
including property or legal rights, in violation of state or federal law. Wire
fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343 requires (1) a scheme to defraud or obtain
property by false or fraudulent pretenses, (2) intent to defraud, and (3) use
of interstate wire communications to execute the scheme (Clinton v. Sec.
Benefit Life Ins. Co., 63 F.4th 1264 (10th Cir. 2023); United States v.
Holloway, 826 F.3d 1237 (10th Cir. 2016)). The Tenth Circuit requires that
the deprivation of property be a central object of the scheme, and that the
use of wires (including email) be knowing and in furtherance of the
fraudulent scheme (United States v. Tao, 629 F.Supp.3d 1083). B. Extortion
by Carter, Kaitcer, and Myers Extortion, as a RICO predicate act, is defined
broadly under federal law and the Travel Act. It includes obtaining property
or rights through threats, coercion, or misuse of official process (U.S. v.
Welch, 327 F.3d 1081 (10th Cir. 2003)). The Tenth Circuit does not require
extortion to be part of a business enterprise for Travel Act purposes; a single
act suffices if it has the requisite interstate nexus. The timeline shows the
following: i. Event 33–34: Carter, with Myers, prepared and presented
“Temporary Orders” that misrepresented facts (e.g., that Plaintiff agreed to
terms he did not, that a hearing occurred when it did not, and that the
orders were in the best interests of the children). These orders altered the
dates of access to the home to shield Myers from liability for locking Plaintiff
out, and were presented to Plaintiff in a context where he was under threat
of losing his home and business. iii. Event 36: Kaitcer, knowing the orders
were disputed and that no response had been filed, signed an associate
judge’s report pre-drafted by Carter, summarily denying Plaintiff’s
emergency motion and ordering Plaintiff to sign the disputed document,
despite his objections and lack of consent. iv. Event 35: Plaintiff refused to
sign the orders for multiple reasons, including their fraudulent content and
the lack of due process, but the orders were rendered into effect without his
signature. These acts collectively demonstrate the use of legal process and
the threat of adverse judicial action to coerce Plaintiff into surrendering his
property and business interests. The manipulation of court orders, the
misrepresentation of facts, and the pressure to sign under threat of losing
his home constitute extortion under the Travel Act and RICO (U.S. v. Welch,
327 F.3d 1081 (10th Cir. 2003). Myers’s role is clear: she was the beneficiary
and instigator of the fraudulent filings and the manipulation of court

=== PAGE 15 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
process, using the threat of legal action and the actual deprivation of
Plaintiff’s property to achieve her goal. Carter and Kaitcer acted in concert
with Myers, knowingly facilitating the extortion by preparing, presenting,
and enforcing fraudulent orders, and by using the authority of the court to
coerce Plaintiff. The fact that Plaintiff was ordered to sign a document he
objected to, under threat of continued deprivation of his home and business,
is classic extortion by color of official right. All three defendants knew that
Plaintiff did not agree to the order, as he had just fired his attorney to
challenge any basis for an agreement. This implies that despite the motion
being served on all defendants, they chose to ignore the allegations of a
fraudulent scheme and further the affairs of the enterprise. These actions
meet the requirements for extortion as a RICO predicate act: they involved
the wrongful use of threats and official process to obtain property (the home
and business) from Plaintiff, with his consent induced by fear of further loss
or legal harm. The acts were not isolated but part of a coordinated scheme
to achieve the enterprise’s goal of finalizing the divorce and divesting
Plaintiff of his property B. Wire Fraud by Munford and Baker Wire fraud
under 18 U.S.C. § 1343 requires a scheme to defraud, intent to defraud, and
use of interstate wire communications to execute the scheme (Clinton v. Sec.
Benefit Life Ins. Co., 63 F.4th 1264 (10th Cir. 2023); United States v.
Holloway, 826 F.3d 1237 (10th Cir. 2016)). The Tenth Circuit recognizes that
sending altered or incomplete court documents via email, with the intent to
mislead or deprive someone of property or rights, can constitute wire fraud
if the deprivation of property is a central object of the scheme (United
States v. Tao, 629 F.Supp.3d 1083). The timeline shows the following: i.
Event 54: Munford signed and forwarded a “Joint Motion to Recuse”
attached to his order of referral, but the document was missing critical
exhibits and affidavits necessary for Plaintiff’s relief. ii. Event 55: Baker sent
a copy of this incomplete filing via email, representing it as the full
document. iii. Event 56–57: When Plaintiff pointed out the discrepancies,
Baker provided inconsistent explanations, first claiming the full document
was e-filed, then later stating it was split into three parts due to size. iv.
Event 58: Munford signed and filed an “Amended Order of Referral” with the
full motion attached, but with hyperlinks and bookmarks removed, further
impairing the document’s integrity. v. Event 59, 83: Baker continued to
forward altered or incomplete orders and referrals, even when procedural
irregularities were raised. These acts involved the knowing use of interstate
email to transmit altered or incomplete court documents, with the intent to
prevent Plaintiff from obtaining relief and to further the enterprise’s goal of
finalizing the divorce and depriving Plaintiff of his property. The use of email
to transmit these documents satisfies the interstate wire requirement, and
the intent to defraud is evidenced by the deliberate alteration and
misrepresentation of the filings. The conduct of Munford and Baker meets
the elements of wire fraud: (1) a scheme to defraud Plaintiff of property and
rights, (2) intent to defraud by preventing relief and misleading the court
and Plaintiff, and (3) use of interstate wire communications (email) to
execute the scheme (Clinton v. Sec. Benefit Life Ins. Co., 63 F.4th 1264 (10th
Cir. 2023)). The deprivation of property (Plaintiff’s home and business) was
a central object of the scheme, not a minor part. RELATIONSHIP AND
CONTINUITY All these acts—extortion by Carter, Kaitcer, and Myers, and
wire fraud by Munford and Baker—were committed in furtherance of the
Myers-Branthoover enterprise’s overarching objective: to finalize the

=== PAGE 16 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
divorce and divest Plaintiff of his home and business. The acts were
coordinated, continuous, and related, satisfying the RICO pattern
requirement. The timeline shows that each defendant’s conduct was not an
isolated error or routine administrative act, but part of a deliberate scheme
to use the legal process, threats, and fraudulent communications to achieve
the enterprise’s unlawful goals. DAMAGES The harm inflicted upon Plaintiff
is staggering. He has lost the home in which he lived for nearly a third of his
life, the companionship of his spouse, and the society of his children. His
income has collapsed. For two years he has been consigned to a futile
appellate gauntlet, even as Defendants Munford, Kaitcer, Baker, and Carter
have repeatedly exceeded the bounds of their lawful authority in furtherance
of a broader scheme. What began as a concerted effort by Myers and
Branthoover to dispossess Plaintiff of his residence and property
metastasized into a calculated plan to procure a final decree of divorce once
the initial objective had been achieved. The objective was plain: by
engineering a final decree, Defendants would not only hobble Plaintiff’s
ability to bring this suit but also invite invocation of the Rooker–Feldman
doctrine and related abstention principles to preclude federal jurisdiction.
Now, after two years of unremitting effort, Plaintiff seeks the only
meaningful remedy remaining: federal redress to halt the ongoing abuses of
authority, to unwind tainted actions, and to compensate him fully for the
catastrophic losses Defendants have wrought. Take each piece in the TABLE
OF CONTENTS, research the topic, and tie it to the factual timeline, filling
out each element of the RICO complaint and tie each element to the factual
allegations by enumerated paragraph number. What are the requirements
for pleading predicate acts (wire fraud, Travel Act violations, extortion,
fraudulent court filings) in a civil RICO complaint in the Fifth Circuit, and
how should these be tied to the factual record?
Answer (Fifth Circuit)
Short response
To plead predicate acts such as wire fraud, Travel Act violations, extortion,
and fraudulent court filings in a civil RICO complaint in the Fifth Circuit, a
plaintiff must allege with particularity the “who, what, when, where, and
how” of each act, show that at least two such acts are related and pose a
threat of continued criminal activity, and tie each act to the conduct of an
enterprise affecting interstate commerce. Each predicate act must be
specifically linked to the factual record, demonstrating a scheme to defraud,
use of interstate wires or mails, specific intent, and actual injury to business
or property.
Summary
In the Fifth Circuit, civil RICO claims require plaintiffs to plead with
specificity the details of each alleged predicate act—such as wire fraud,
extortion, or Travel Act violations—by identifying the participants, dates,
methods, and fraudulent nature of each act, in compliance with Federal Rule
of Civil Procedure 9(b). The complaint must also demonstrate that these acts

=== PAGE 17 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
are related, form a pattern of racketeering activity, and are connected to the
conduct of an enterprise, with each act directly tied to the factual record
and resulting in injury to the plaintiff’s business or property.
To satisfy these requirements, the plaintiff must enumerate each predicate
act in the complaint, cite the relevant statutory provision, and provide
detailed factual allegations (including references to the record) showing
how each act was committed, who was involved, and how it furthered the
enterprise’s unlawful objectives. The complaint must also show that the acts
are not isolated incidents but part of a coordinated scheme, and that the
resulting harm to the plaintiff was a direct and foreseeable consequence of
the defendants’ conduct.
Background and Relevant Law
Legislative and Regulatory Framework
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), codified at
18 U.S.C. §§ 1961–1968, provides a civil cause of action for individuals
injured in their business or property by reason of a pattern of racketeering
activity conducted through an enterprise affecting interstate or foreign
commerce. The statute defines “racketeering activity” to include a range of
criminal offenses, notably wire fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343), mail fraud (18
U.S.C. § 1341), extortion (including under the Hobbs Act and Travel Act),
and other specified crimes (Bustos v. Invierte En Tex., 4:22-CV-02690 (S.D.
Tex. Jun 03, 2024); 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1)).
To state a civil RICO claim under § 1962(c), a plaintiff must allege: (1) a
person who engages in (2) a pattern of racketeering activity (3) connected to
the acquisition, establishment, conduct, or control of an enterprise (St.
Germain v. Howard, 556 F.3d 261, 263 (5th Cir. 2009); Abraham v. Singh,
480 F.3d 351, 355 (5th Cir. 2007)). A “pattern of racketeering activity”
requires at least two predicate acts that are related and amount to or pose a
threat of continued criminal activity (Word of Faith World Outreach Center
Church, Inc. v. Sawyer, 90 F.3d 118, 122 (5th Cir. 1996); St. Paul Mercury
Ins v. Williamson, 224 F.3d 425, 441 (5th Cir. 2000)).
Case Law
The Fifth Circuit has consistently held that RICO claims based on fraud
(including wire fraud and mail fraud) are subject to the heightened pleading
requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b), which requires the
plaintiff to state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud
(Bustos v. Invierte En Tex., 4:22-CV-02690 (S.D. Tex. Jun 03, 2024); Moore v.
Town N. Auto., Inc., Civil Action No. 3:14-CV-1215-D (N.D. Tex. Jul 11,
2014)). This means the complaint must specify the “who, what, when,
where, and how” of each alleged fraudulent act (6315 Magazine, LLC v. Flot
Nola, LLC, CIVIL ACTION NO. 20-1472 SECTION M (4) (E.D. La. Aug 21,
2020)).

=== PAGE 18 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
For wire fraud, the plaintiff must allege: (1) a scheme to defraud or obtain
property by false pretenses, (2) use of interstate wire communications to
execute the scheme, and (3) specific intent to defraud (Van Duzer v. U.S.
Bank Nat'l Ass'n, 995 F.Supp.2d 673 (S.D. Tex. 2014); United Healthcare
Sevices, Inc. v. Next Health, LLC, CIVIL ACTION NO. 3:17-CV-00625-M (N.D.
Tex. Mar 05, 2018)). For extortion, the plaintiff must show the wrongful use
of actual or threatened force, violence, fear, or misuse of official right to
obtain property from another (U.S. v. Welch, 656 F.2d 1039 (5th Cir. 1981)).
A RICO complaint must also allege that the predicate acts caused actual
injury to the plaintiff’s business or property, and that the injury was
proximately caused by the defendants’ conduct (WASTE MANAGEMENT OF
LOUISIANA v. River Birch, Inc., 920 F.3d 958 (5th Cir. 2019)).
Analysis
I. Jurisdiction and Venue
A RICO action may be brought in federal court if the alleged enterprise
affects interstate commerce and the predicate acts include federal crimes
such as wire fraud or extortion (RICO: A Primer (2022-01-31)). The factual
timeline demonstrates interstate activity (e.g., transfer of funds from Texas
to Oklahoma, use of interstate wire communications), satisfying the
jurisdictional requirement.
II. Parties
The complaint must identify each defendant and their role in the alleged
enterprise. Here, the parties include Myers, Branthoover, Munford, Kaitcer,
Carter, and Baker, each alleged to have participated in the enterprise’s
affairs through specific acts detailed in the timeline.
III. Record References
The Fifth Circuit permits courts to take judicial notice of public records,
including state court filings, when evaluating a RICO complaint (Miller v.
Dunn, 35 F.4th 1007 (5th Cir. 2022)). The complaint’s references to the
consolidated mandamus record, with specific REC page citations, provide
the necessary factual support for each alleged act.
IV. Introduction
The introduction should summarize the nature of the enterprise, the pattern
of racketeering activity, and the resulting injury. The complaint alleges a
coordinated scheme to deprive the plaintiff of his home and business
through fraudulent legal filings, extortion, and manipulation of court
proceedings.

=== PAGE 19 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
V. Factual Timeline
Each section of the timeline must be tied to the elements of the RICO claim
and the specific predicate acts:
A. The Myers-Branthoover Enterprise
The complaint must allege the formation of an association-in-fact enterprise,
with a common purpose and ongoing structure (D&T Partners LLC v.
Baymark Partners LP, 2022-05-09). The timeline (¶¶ 1–7) details the initial
agreement, planning, and execution of the scheme, including interstate
meetings and communications.
B. Interstate Travel and Transfer
Allegations of interstate travel and transfer of funds (¶¶ 2–3) support the
interstate commerce requirement and provide factual support for Travel Act
violations and wire fraud.
C. Admissions
Admissions by Branthoover (¶ 4) corroborate the existence of the scheme
and the use of interstate wires to further it.
D. Post-submission Collaboration
Ongoing collaboration (¶ 5) demonstrates the continuity and structure of the
enterprise.
E. Significant and Intentional Misrepresentations
Specific misrepresentations in court filings (¶ 7) are essential for pleading
fraudulent court filings and wire fraud as predicate acts.
F. Evidence to the Contrary
Contradictory evidence (¶¶ 8–11) supports the allegation that the filings
were knowingly false, a key element of fraud.
G–V. Subsequent Events
Each subsequent section (¶¶ 12–93) should be referenced to show the
ongoing nature of the scheme, the participation of each defendant, and the
continuity of the enterprise’s unlawful objectives.

=== PAGE 20 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
VI. The RICO Enterprise
A. Structure and Membership
The complaint must allege an enterprise with a defined structure,
membership, and purpose (Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938, 945 (2009)).
The timeline (¶¶ 1–7, 93) details the roles of Myers, Branthoover, and
others.
B. Expansion, Purpose, and Continuity
The enterprise’s purpose (to deprive plaintiff of property) and continuity
(ongoing acts over months) are established by the timeline.
C. Decision-Making and Functioning as a Unit
Allegations of coordinated planning, decision-making, and execution (¶¶ 1–7,
93) satisfy the requirement that the enterprise function as a continuing unit.
VII. Predicate Acts
A. Wire Fraud
To plead wire fraud, the complaint must allege: (1) a scheme to defraud, (2)
use of interstate wires, and (3) specific intent to defraud (Van Duzer v. U.S.
Bank Nat'l Ass'n, 995 F.Supp.2d 673 (S.D. Tex. 2014)). The complaint should
specify:
Who: Myers, Branthoover, Munford, Baker
What: Transfer of funds, transmission of fraudulent documents, emails
with altered court filings
When: Specific dates (e.g., December 2023 transfers, October 2024
emails)
Where: Texas, Oklahoma, interstate communications
How: Use of PayPal, text messages, emails, court filings
Each act must be tied to a REC page and explained in detail.
B. Travel Act Violations
The Travel Act prohibits interstate travel or use of interstate facilities to
promote or carry on unlawful activity, including extortion (U.S. v. Welch, 656
F.2d 1039 (5th Cir. 1981)). The complaint should allege:
Who: Myers, Branthoover
What: Interstate travel to plan and execute fraudulent filings
When: December 2023
Where: Texas to Oklahoma and back
How: Meetings, transfer of funds, preparation of documents

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
C. Extortion
Extortion as a predicate act requires the wrongful use of threats or official
process to obtain property (U.S. v. Welch, 656 F.2d 1039 (5th Cir. 1981)). The
complaint should allege:
Who: Carter, Kaitcer, Myers
What: Use of fraudulent court orders, threats of legal action, coercion
to sign documents
When: March 2024 and other specified dates
Where: Tarrant County, Texas
How: Presentation and enforcement of orders, threats of loss of home/
business
D. Fraudulent Court Filings
Fraudulent court filings may constitute wire fraud or mail fraud if
transmitted electronically or by mail, and must be pleaded with particularity
(Bustos v. Invierte En Tex., 4:22-CV-02690 (S.D. Tex. Jun 03, 2024)). The
complaint should specify:
Who: Myers, Branthoover, Carter, Kaitcer
What: Submission of false affidavits, petitions, orders
When: Specific dates as per REC references
Where: 322nd District Court, Tarrant County
How: Filing of documents containing material misrepresentations
E. Relatedness and Continuity
The complaint must show that the predicate acts are related (same or
similar purposes, participants, methods) and pose a threat of continued
criminal activity (Word of Faith World Outreach Center Church, Inc. v.
Sawyer, 90 F.3d 118, 122 (5th Cir. 1996)). The timeline demonstrates
ongoing, coordinated acts over an extended period.
VIII. RICO Conspiracy
To plead a RICO conspiracy under § 1962(d), the complaint must allege an
agreement among defendants to commit at least two predicate acts and
further the enterprise’s objectives (Abraham v. Singh, 480 F.3d 351, 355 (5th
Cir. 2007)). The complaint should detail overt acts in furtherance of the
conspiracy, referencing specific REC pages.
IX. Potential Defenses
Defendants may raise defenses such as preclusion, Rooker-Feldman,
Younger abstention, or judicial immunity. The complaint should anticipate
these defenses and allege facts showing why they do not bar the RICO claim
(e.g., ongoing injury, lack of final judgment, acts outside judicial capacity).
•

• 
• 

=== PAGE 22 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
X. State Law Claims
The complaint may also plead state law claims (fraud, abuse of process,
intentional infliction of emotional distress) based on the same factual
allegations, but must distinguish these from the federal RICO claims.
XI. Claims for Relief
The complaint should specify the relief sought, including compensatory,
treble, and punitive damages, as well as injunctive and declaratory relief.
XII. Damages
The complaint must allege actual injury to business or property, with specific
facts showing how the predicate acts caused the harm (WASTE
MANAGEMENT OF LOUISIANA v. River Birch, Inc., 920 F.3d 958 (5th Cir.
2019)).
XIII. Prayer for Relief
The prayer for relief should request all appropriate remedies, referencing
the statutory basis for each.
Exceptions and Caveats
RICO claims based on fraud must meet Rule 9(b)’s heightened pleading
standard; conclusory or speculative allegations are insufficient (6315
Magazine, LLC v. Flot Nola, LLC, CIVIL ACTION NO. 20-1472 SECTION
M (4) (E.D. La. Aug 21, 2020)).
The complaint must show both but-for and proximate causation
between the predicate acts and the injury (WASTE MANAGEMENT OF
LOUISIANA v. River Birch, Inc., 920 F.3d 958 (5th Cir. 2019)).
Judicial immunity may bar claims against judges for acts taken in their
judicial capacity, unless the acts were clearly outside their jurisdiction.
Conclusion
To properly plead predicate acts in a civil RICO complaint in the Fifth
Circuit, the plaintiff must allege with particularity each act of wire fraud,
Travel Act violation, extortion, or fraudulent court filing, specifying the
participants, dates, methods, and fraudulent nature of each act, and tie each
to the conduct of an enterprise affecting interstate commerce. The
complaint must show that these acts are related, form a pattern of
racketeering activity, and directly caused injury to the plaintiff’s business or
property, with each allegation supported by specific references to the factual
record.

Burzynski, In re, 989 F.2d 733 (5th Cir. 1993)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
The plaintiff pleaded acts which could serve as 'predicate acts'--mail fraud
and wire fraud. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1). Our guideline for the elements of RICO
mail fraud is: 1) a scheme to defraud by means of false or fraudulent
representation, 2) interstate or intrastate use of the mails to execute the
scheme, 3) the use of the mails by the defendant connected with scheme,
and 4) actual injury to the plaintiff. Landry v. Air Line Pilots Ass'n Int'l, 901
F.2d 404, 428 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 895, 111 S.Ct. 244, 112 L.Ed.
2d 203 (1990).
Summary
Elements required to plead mail and wire fraud as predicate acts in a RICO
claim within the Fifth Circuit. These elements include a scheme to defraud,
use of mail or wires to execute the scheme, and actual injury to the plaintiff.
This information is directly relevant to understanding how to plead these
predicate acts in a civil RICO complaint.
W. Tex. Nat'l Bank v. FEC Holdings, LP, MO-11-CV-086, MO-11-CV-121 (W.D.
Tex. May 17, 2013)
U.S. District Court — Western District of Texas
Extract
The First Amended Original Complaint gives some specifics about
discussions regarding the loans on the telephone. Misrepresentations,
however, that occurred at a meeting do not constitute wire or mail fraud,
18U.S.C.A. §§ 1341,1343, and thus cannot constitute racketeering activity.
Id. § 1961(1); Tel-Phonic Services, 975 F.2d at 1139. Further, as to the wire
fraud, FEC failed to plead any of the wire transfers were interstate, and
failed to plead the time, place and contents of a predicate act of wire fraud.
Lastly, FEC does not plead how mailing the loan documents and requiring
interest payments over the wires constitutes a pattern of racketeering
activity, or furthers a 'recognizable scheme formed with specific intent to
defraud,' or presents a continued threat of criminal activity.
Summary
Requirements for pleading wire fraud as a predicate act in a civil RICO
complaint. It emphasizes the necessity of pleading specific facts, including
the interstate nature of wire transfers, the time, place, and contents of the
predicate act, and how these acts constitute a pattern of racketeering
activity. The passage also highlights the need to demonstrate a

=== PAGE 24 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
"recognizable scheme formed with specific intent to defraud" and a
continued threat of criminal activity. These requirements are crucial for
establishing a RICO claim in the Fifth Circuit.
Marriott Bros. v. Gage, 704 F.Supp. 731 (N.D. Tex. 1988)
U.S. District Court — Northern District of Texas
Extract
The absence of any RICO predicate acts under 18 U.S.C. § 1962 defeats the
plaintiffs' RICO claims. Even if some of the conduct involving the non-
Marriott loans could be construed as predicate acts (or, in the language of
RICO, 'acts of racketeering activity,' 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5)), the record does
not establish that they were part of the same pattern of racketeering activity
as the Marriott-Yates transaction.
Summary
The passage highlights the importance of demonstrating predicate acts that
are part of a pattern of racketeering activity to sustain a RICO claim. It
emphasizes that even if certain actions could be considered predicate acts,
they must be shown to be part of the same pattern of racketeering activity.
This is crucial for tying the factual record to the legal requirements of a
RICO claim, as it underscores the need for a coherent and connected series
of acts that constitute racketeering activity.
Robinson v. Standard Mortg. Corp., 191 F.Supp.3d 630 (E.D. La. 2016)
U.S. District Court — Eastern District of Louisiana
Extract
To allege a 'pattern of racketeering activity,' a plaintiff must show that the
defendant committed two or more predicate offenses that are (1) related and
(2) amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity. H.J. Inc. v. Nw.
Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 239, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989).
Predicate offenses include violations of certain state and federal laws,
including the wire and mail fraud statutes and the Hobbs Act, which
prohibits extortion. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1).
Summary
Clear explanation of what constitutes a "pattern of racketeering activity"
under RICO, which is essential for pleading a civil RICO claim. It specifies
that a plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant committed at least two
predicate offenses that are related and pose a threat of continued criminal
activity. The passage also identifies wire fraud, mail fraud, and extortion as

examples of predicate offenses under RICO. This information is directly
relevant to understanding how to plead predicate acts in a civil RICO
complaint in the Fifth Circuit.
Martin v. Magee, NO: 10-2786 (E.D. La. Jun 10, 2011)
U.S. District Court — Eastern District of Louisiana
Extract
RICO claims under section 1962 require, inter alia, '1) a person who
engages in 2) a pattern of racketeering activity, 3) connected to the
acquisition, establishment, conduct or control of an enterprise.' Abraham v.
Singh, 480 F.3d 351, 355 (5th Cir. 2007) (quoting Word of Faith World
Outreach Ctr. Church, Inc. v. Sawyer, 90 F.3d 118, 122 (5th Cir. 1996)). To
allege a 'pattern of racketeering activity,' a plaintiff must show that the
defendant committed two or more predicate offenses that are (1) related and
(2) amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity. H.J. Inc. v. Nw.
Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 239 (1989).
Summary
Requirements for a RICO claim under section 1962, which includes
engaging in a pattern of racketeering activity connected to an enterprise. It
specifies that a pattern of racketeering activity requires at least two related
predicate offenses that pose a threat of continued criminal activity. This is
directly relevant to understanding how to plead predicate acts in a civil
RICO complaint in the Fifth Circuit.
Allstate Ins. Co. v. Donovan, CIVIL ACTION NO. H-12-0432 (S.D. Tex. Jul 03,
2012)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of Texas
Extract
Defendants argue that plaintiffs' RICO claims fail as a matter of law because
plaintiffs have not sufficiently alleged that defendants engaged in a pattern
of racketeering activity and have failed to plead fraud with particularity. 'A
pattern of racketeering activity consists of two or more predicate criminal
acts that are (1) related and (2) amount to or pose a threat of continued
criminal activity.' St. Germain, 556 F.3d at 263. See also 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5)
('pattern of racketeering activity' requires at least two acts of racketeering
activity, one of which occurred after the effective date of this chapter and
the last of which occurred within ten years... after the commission of a prior
act of racketeering activity'). Predicate acts can be either state or federal
crimes. Id. Plaintiffs allege that defendants engaged in acts of mail fraud in
violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1841, which prohibits use of the mail to plan or

=== PAGE 26 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
conduct fraudulent schemes. Plaintiffs' mail fraud allegations must be based
on facts capable of establishing: '(1) a scheme to defraud by means of false
or fraudulent representation, (2) interstate or intrastate use of the mails to
execute the scheme, (3) the use of the mails by the defendant connected
with [the] scheme, and (4) actual injury to the plaintiff.' In re Burzynski, 989
F.2d 733, 742 (5th Cir. 1993). '[A]lthough reliance is not an element of
statutory mail or wire fraud, [the Fifth Circuit has] required its showing
when mail or wire fraud is alleged as a RICO predicate.'
Summary
Requirements for pleading predicate acts in a civil RICO complaint in the
Fifth Circuit. It specifies that a pattern of racketeering activity must consist
of at least two related predicate acts that pose a threat of continued criminal
activity. For mail fraud, which is analogous to wire fraud, the complaint must
establish a scheme to defraud, use of the mails (or wires) to execute the
scheme, and actual injury to the plaintiff. The Fifth Circuit also requires
showing reliance when mail or wire fraud is alleged as a RICO predicate.
This information is crucial for understanding how to structure a RICO
complaint and tie it to the factual record.
U.S. v. Welch, 656 F.2d 1039 (5th Cir. 1981)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
Finally, Welch contends that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient
to sustain a conviction on Count V the substantive RICO offense. This Court
has recently stated that five elements comprise a substantive RICO charge:
The government must prove (1) the existence of the enterprise; (2) that the
enterprise affected interstate commerce; (3) that the defendant was
employed by or associated with the enterprise; (4) that he participated in
the conduct of the affairs of the enterprise; and (5) that he participated
through a pattern of racketeering activity.
Summary
Five essential elements required to establish a substantive RICO charge in
the Fifth Circuit. These elements include proving the existence of an
enterprise, its effect on interstate commerce, the defendant's association
with the enterprise, participation in its affairs, and participation through a
pattern of racketeering activity. This framework is crucial for understanding
how to plead predicate acts in a civil RICO complaint, as it provides the
foundational requirements that must be met.

U.S. District Court — Northern District of Texas
Extract
To sufficiently plead a RICO claim, a plaintiff must allege that: (1) a person
(2) engages in a pattern of racketeering activity (3) connected to the
acquisition, establishment, conduct, or control of an enterprise. In re
Burzynski, 989 F.2d 733, 741 (5th Cir. 1993). A 'pattern of racketeering
activity' requires at least two predicate acts of racketeering that are related
and pose a threat of continued criminal activity. Brown v. Protective Life Ins.
Co., 353 F.3d 405, 407 (5th Cir. 2003). In the context of mail or wire fraud,
the plaintiff must demonstrate that the predicate acts consisted of making
false or fraudulent representations calculated to deceive.
Summary
To plead a RICO claim in the Fifth Circuit, a plaintiff must allege a person
engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity connected to an enterprise.
This pattern requires at least two related predicate acts that pose a threat of
continued criminal activity. For wire fraud, the plaintiff must show false or
fraudulent representations intended to deceive. This provides a clear
framework for tying factual allegations to the legal requirements for a RICO
claim.
Interstate Nat&#39;l Dealer Servs. v. MSRV Repair LLC, 6:24-CV-00170-
ADA-DTG (W.D. Tex. Jun 20, 2025)
U.S. District Court — Western District of Texas
Extract
To state a claim for a violation of § 1962(c), the plaintiffs must allege
conduct or participation of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering
activity. Allstate Ins. Co. v. Benhamou, 190 F.Supp.3d 631, 647 (S.D. Tex.
2016) (citing Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. lmrex Co., Inc., 473 U.S. 479, 496 (1985)).
Racketeering activity includes mail or wire fraud. 18 U.SC. § 1961(1)
(defining “racketeering activity”). To establish a RICO conspiracy claim, the
plaintiffs must allege that at least two people agreed to commit a
substantive RICO offense, and the defendants knew of and agreed to the
overall objective of the RICO offense. Chaney v. Dreyfus Serv. Corp., 595 F.
3d 219, 239 (5th Cir. 2010) (listing the elements of a RICO conspiracy claim
under § 1962(d) (quoting United States v. Sharpe, 193 F.3d 852, 869 (5th
Cir. 1999))).
Summary
To plead a civil RICO claim under § 1962(c) in the Fifth Circuit, a plaintiff
must allege the conduct or participation of an enterprise through a pattern
of racketeering activity, which includes acts like wire fraud. For a RICO

=== PAGE 28 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
conspiracy claim under § 1962(d), it must be alleged that at least two people
agreed to commit a substantive RICO offense and were aware of and agreed
to the overall objective of the RICO offense. These elements must be tied to
the factual record by demonstrating how the defendants' actions fit into the
pattern of racketeering activity and the enterprise's objectives.
Verges v. Babovich, 644 F.Supp. 150 (E.D. La. 1986)
U.S. District Court — Eastern District of Louisiana
Extract
Defendants say that the RICO claim is deficient in three essential respects:
1) failure to allege a 'pattern of racketeering activity'; 2) failure to allege,
with the requisite specificity, predicate acts by each defendant, a conspiracy,
and an interstate nexus; and, 3) failure to allege fraud with particularity, as
required by F.R.C.P. 9(b)... Plaintiffs allege facts sufficient to describe
multiple violations of the mail and wire fraud statutes by all of the
defendants (18 U.S.C. §§ 1341 and 1343), which requires only that it appear
from a fair reading of the complaint that each of the defendants have
devised or participated in a scheme to defraud, and used the mails and wires
in furtherance of that scheme. This, plaintiffs have done.
Summary
Requirements for a RICO claim, emphasizing the need to allege a pattern of
racketeering activity, specify predicate acts by each defendant, and detail
the conspiracy and interstate nexus. It also highlights the necessity of
alleging fraud with particularity under F.R.C.P. 9(b). The passage provides
guidance on how to tie these elements to the factual record by ensuring that
the complaint shows each defendant's participation in a scheme to defraud
and the use of mails and wires in furtherance of that scheme.

U.S. District Court — Northern District of Texas
Extract
Rule 9(b) imposes a heightened pleading standard for fraud claims and
requires that a party state with particularity facts supporting each element
of fraud." ... "RICO makes it unlawful 'for any person employed by or
associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect,
interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or
indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of
racketeering activity.'" ... "Reduced to their simplest terms, the essential
elements of a RICO claim are: (1) a person who engages in (2) a pattern of

=== PAGE 29 ===

racketeering activity (3) connected to the acquisition, establishment,
conduct, or control of an enterprise." ... "18 U.S.C. § 1961(1)(B) 'defines
'racketeering activity' according to whether it constitutes 'any act which is
indictable' under several specified sections of title 18 of the United States
Code, [two] of which [are] mail fraud [and wire fraud][.]'
Summary
Requirements for pleading fraud under Rule 9(b), which applies to RICO
claims involving fraud as predicate acts. It specifies that fraud claims must
be stated with particularity, detailing the time, place, contents of false
representations, and the identity of the person making them. The passage
also clarifies the essential elements of a RICO claim, which include engaging
in a pattern of racketeering activity connected to an enterprise. It further
identifies wire fraud as a recognized predicate act under RICO.

(N.D. Miss. Sep 30, 2020)
U.S. District Court — Northern District of Mississippi
Extract
To state a viable RICO claim under any theory, plaintiffs must allege the
following elements: '(1) a person who engages in (2) a pattern of
racketeering activity, (3) connected to the acquisition, establishment,
conduct, or control of an enterprise.' St. Germain v. Howard, 556 F.3d 261,
263 (5th Cir. 2009). '[T]he heart of any RICO complaint is the allegation of a
pattern of racketeering.' Agency Holding Corp. v. Malley-Duff & Assoc., Inc.,
483 U.S. 143, 154 (1987). To establish a pattern of racketeering, plaintiffs
must identify predicate acts with 'continuity plus relationship.' H.J., Inc. v.
Northwest Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 239 (1989).
Summary
Essential elements required to plead a RICO claim in the Fifth Circuit,
emphasizing the need to demonstrate a pattern of racketeering activity
connected to an enterprise. The pattern must show continuity and
relationship among the predicate acts. This is crucial for tying the factual
record to the legal requirements of a RICO claim.
Heden v. Hill, 937 F.Supp. 1230 (S.D. Tex. 1996)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of Texas

=== PAGE 30 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
Under RICO, while four distinct offenses are declared to be unlawful,
common elements are present in all four offenses... Under § 1961(1)(B),
racketeering activity includes any act which is indictable under a number of
federal criminal statutes, including mail fraud and wire fraud... In this case,
Heden alleges mail fraud and wire fraud as predicate acts supporting his
civil RICO claims... Nonetheless, 'the conduct used to support a civil RICO
action must be indictable.'... Thus, the plaintiff must plead and prove each
prong of the predicate offense, or 'racketeering activity,' to maintain a civil
action under the RICO statute... Hence, to maintain his RICO claims, Heden
must show that each element of a mail fraud or wire fraud offense has been
committed by the defendants. For mail fraud, it is necessary to show that (1)
the defendants formed a scheme or artifice to defraud; (2) the defendants
used the United States mails or caused a use of the United States mails in
furtherance of the scheme; and (3) the defendants did so with the specific
intent to deceive or defraud... Similarly, a wire fraud violation consists of (1)
the formation of a scheme or artifice to defraud; (2) use of the United States
wires or causing a use of the United States wires in furtherance of the
scheme; and (3) specific intent to deceive or defraud.
Summary
Elements required to plead predicate acts of mail and wire fraud in a civil
RICO complaint, emphasizing that the conduct must be indictable and that
each element of the offense must be proven. This is relevant to
understanding how to structure a RICO complaint in the Fifth Circuit.
Bustos v. Invierte En Tex., 4:22-CV-02690 (S.D. Tex. Jun 03, 2024)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of Texas
Extract
RICO claims based on allegations of fraud, such as wire or mail fraud, are
subject to the heightened pleading burden imposed by Rule 9(b).” ... To state
a civil RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962, a plaintiff must allege three
common elements: “(1) a person who engages in (2) a pattern of
racketeering activity, (3) connected to the acquisition, establishment,
conduct, or control of an enterprise.” ... “The elements of wire fraud, as set
out in 18 U.S.C. § 1343, are: (1) a scheme to defraud, (2) the use of wire
communications, and (3) a specific intent to defraud.” ... The pleadings do
not identify what predicate acts Plaintiffs' RICO claim relies on, despite
already having a chance to amend.
Summary
Requirements for pleading predicate acts in a civil RICO complaint,
emphasizing the need for specificity under Rule 9(b) when fraud is alleged.

U.S. District Court — Southern District of Texas
Extract
To state a civil RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962, a plaintiff must allege
three common elements: “(1) a person who engages in (2) a pattern of
racketeering activity, (3) connected to the acquisition, establishment,
conduct, or control of an enterprise.” N. Cypress Med. Ctr. Operating Co.,
Ltd. v. Cigna Healthcare, 781 F.3d 182, 201 (5th Cir. 2015) (quotation

“predicate act,” is defined to include certain criminal acts, including mail
and wire fraud.
Summary
Clear framework for what must be included in a RICO claim, emphasizing
the need for specificity in identifying predicate acts.
AJ Holdings of Metairie, LLC v. Fischbein, Civil Action 21-318 (E.D. La. Jan
31, 2022)
U.S. District Court — Eastern District of Louisiana
Extract
To state a claim under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations
Act (“RICO”), a plaintiff must allege three things: a person who engages in a
“pattern of racketeering activity” that is “connected to the acquisition,
establishment, conduct, or control of an enterprise.”... Second, the Plaintiffs
have failed to establish a “pattern of racketeering activity.” To do so, they
“must show at least two predicate acts of racketeering that…relate[] to or
pose a threat of continued criminal activity.”... The United States Supreme
Court has explained: “Continuity” is both a closed- and open-ended concept,
referring either to a closed period of repeated conduct, or to past conduct
that by its nature projects into the future with a threat of repetition…A party
alleging a RICO violation may demonstrate continuity over a closed period
by proving a series of related predicates extending over a substantial period
of time. Predicate acts extending over a few weeks or months and
threatening no future criminal conduct do not satisfy this requirement:
Congress was concerned in RICO with long-term criminal conduct.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
To plead predicate acts in a civil RICO complaint in the Fifth Circuit, a
plaintiff must establish a "pattern of racketeering activity" by showing at
least two predicate acts that relate to or pose a threat of continued criminal
activity. The concept of continuity is crucial, requiring either a closed period
of repeated conduct or past conduct that projects into the future with a
threat of repetition. This ensures that RICO addresses long-term criminal
conduct rather than isolated incidents.
Williams v. Am. Commerical Lines, Inc., CIVIL ACTION NO. 20-139-SDD-
EWD (M.D. La. Jul 23, 2020)
U.S. District Court — Middle District of Louisiana
Extract
To recover under § 1964(c), a plaintiff must prove not only all elements of a
substantive RICO violation but also that 'he has been injured in his business
or property by the conduct constituting the violation,' and 'must also
demonstrate that the substantive violation proximately caused his injury.' 'A
plaintiff must allege specific facts concerning (1) the conduct (2) of an
enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity.' While Plaintiff
vaguely references that Defendants engaged in conduct that rises to the
level of a substantive RICO violation, and that this conduct caused him
injuries, it is not sufficient to simply state the elements of a cause of action.
Summary
Clear outline of the elements required to plead a civil RICO claim,
emphasizing the need for specific factual allegations that demonstrate the
conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity, and the
requirement to show injury to business or property caused by the violation.
U.S. v. Vaccaro, 115 F.3d 1211 (5th Cir. 1997)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
The elements of a RICO violation under § 1962(c) are: (1) the existence of an
enterprise that affects interstate or foreign commerce; (2) the defendant's
association with the enterprise; (3) the defendant's participation in the
conduct of the enterprise's affairs; and (4) at least two predicate acts of
racketeering activity designated in 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1). ... A wire fraud
conviction requires proof of (1) a scheme to defraud and (2) the use of
interstate wire communications in furtherance of the scheme.

Summary
Essential elements required to establish a RICO violation under § 1962(c) in
the Fifth Circuit, which includes proving the existence of an enterprise, the
defendant's association and participation in the enterprise, and at least two
predicate acts of racketeering activity. For wire fraud, it specifies the need
to demonstrate a scheme to defraud and the use of interstate wire
communications in furtherance of that scheme. This information is crucial
for understanding how to plead predicate acts in a civil RICO complaint.
Wing v. JC Bradford &amp; Co., 678 F. Supp. 622 (N.D. Miss. 1987)
U.S. District Court — Northern District of Mississippi
Extract
Bradford argues, however, that plaintiffs have failed to state a claim under
RICO. As defendant notes, an essential element of any RICO claim is that the
plaintiff allege and prove that the defendant has, through the commission of
two or more acts, engaged in a 'pattern of racketeering activity', as defined
in 18 U.S.C. Section 1961(5). Alcorn County v. U.S. Interstate Supplies, Inc.,
731 F.2d 1160, 1168 (5th Cir.1984); United States v. Phillips, 664 F.2d 971,
1011 (5th Cir.1981), cert. denied, 457 U.S. 1136, 102 S.Ct. 2965, 73 L.Ed.2d
1354 (1982). Additionally, in order to violate RICO, a defendant must first
commit a pattern of racketeering activity, and then either use the money he
derives from such activity or use the activity itself to: 1) invest in an
enterprise; 2) acquire or maintain an interest in an enterprise; or, 3) conduct
an enterprise's affairs. Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Company, Inc., 473 U.S.
479, 481-483, 493, 105 S.Ct. 3275, 3278-79, 3284, 87 L.Ed.2d 346 (1985).
Summary
To plead predicate acts in a civil RICO complaint in the Fifth Circuit, a
plaintiff must allege and prove that the defendant engaged in a "pattern of
racketeering activity," which involves the commission of two or more acts as
defined in 18 U.S.C. Section 1961(5). The defendant must then use the
proceeds or the activity itself to invest in, acquire, maintain, or conduct an
enterprise's affairs. This establishes the framework for tying specific
predicate acts like wire fraud, Travel Act violations, extortion, and
fraudulent court filings to the factual record by demonstrating how these
acts form a pattern and are used to further the enterprise.

Extract
Racketeering activity consists of two or more predicate criminal acts that
are (1) related and (2) amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal
activity.” Abraham v. Singh, 480 F.3d 351, 355 (5th Cir. 2007) (citing Word of
Faith World Outreach Ctr. Church, Inc. v. Sawyer, 90 F.3d 118, 122 (5th Cir.

inter alia, “any act which is indictable under. .. [18 U.S.C. §] 1341 (relating to
mail fraud), section 1343 (relating to wire fraud),. .. [and] section[] 2314 []
(relating to interstate transportation of stolen property).” 18 U.S.C. §
1961(1)(B). The Rule 9(b) requirement that fraud claims be pleaded with
particularity “applies to the pleading of fraud as a predicate act in a RICO
claim, ” including mail and wire fraud. Tel-Phonic Servs., Inc. v. TBS
Int&#39;l, Inc., 975 F.2d 1134, 1138 (5th Cir. 1992).
Summary
The passage outlines that in the Fifth Circuit, racketeering activity for a
RICO claim must consist of two or more predicate criminal acts that are
related and pose a threat of continued criminal activity. Predicate acts
include wire fraud, mail fraud, and interstate transportation of stolen
property. Additionally, fraud claims, including those used as predicate acts in
a RICO claim, must be pleaded with particularity under Rule 9(b). This
means that the complaint must specify the fraudulent acts, the parties
involved, and the context in which the fraud occurred.

SECTION M (4) (E.D. La. Aug 21, 2020)
U.S. District Court — Eastern District of Louisiana
Extract
Put simply, complying with Rule 9(b) requires a plaintiff to 'set forth the
'who, what, when, where, and how' of the alleged fraud.' United States ex
rel. Williams v. Bell Helicopter Textron Inc., 417 F.3d 450, 453 (5th Cir.

of mail and wire fraud.'
Summary
In the Fifth Circuit, when pleading predicate acts of fraud in a civil RICO
complaint, the plaintiff must comply with Rule 9(b) of the Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure. This rule requires the plaintiff to detail the 'who, what,
when, where, and how' of the alleged fraud, ensuring that the allegations
are specific and not based on speculation or conclusory statements. This
requirement is crucial for RICO claims that involve predicate acts of mail
and wire fraud.

Word of Faith World Outreach Center Church, Inc. v. Sawyer, 90 F.3d 118
(5th Cir. 1996)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
The central issue on appeal is whether the Church sufficiently pled a
'pattern of racketeering activity.' 'Racketeering activity' consists of two or
more predicate offenses, defined by the statute to include acts violating
federal wire or mail fraud statutes. 18 U.S.C. § 1961. To establish a pattern
of racketeering activity, the Supreme Court explained in H.J. Inc. v.
Northwestern Bell Telephone, Co. 492 U.S. 229, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106 L.Ed.2d
195 (1989), that a plaintiff 'must show that the racketeering predicates are
related, and that they amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal
activity.' Id. at 239, 109 S.Ct. at 2900 (emphasis added). The element of
relatedness is established if the acts have the 'same or similar purposes,
results, participants, victims, or methods of commission.'
Summary
Requirements for pleading a "pattern of racketeering activity" under RICO
in the Fifth Circuit. It specifies that a pattern requires at least two predicate
acts that are related and pose a threat of continued criminal activity. The
relatedness is determined by whether the acts have similar purposes,
results, participants, victims, or methods. This is crucial for establishing a
RICO claim, as it ties the predicate acts to the broader scheme of
racketeering activity.
Abraham v. Singh, 480 F.3d 351 (5th Cir. 2007)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
Plaintiffs allege that Defendants violated 18 U.S.C. § 1962(a), (b), (c), and
(d). These RICO subsections state, in their simplest terms, that: (a) a person
who has received income from a pattern of racketeering activity cannot
invest that income in an enterprise; (b) a person cannot acquire or maintain
an interest in an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering; (c) a person
who is employed by or associated with an enterprise cannot conduct the
affairs of the enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity; and (d) a
person cannot conspire to violate subsections (a), (b), or (c). ... '[B]ecause
the core of a RICO civil conspiracy is an agreement to commit predicate
acts, a RICO civil conspiracy complaint, at the very least, must allege
specifically such an agreement.' Crowe, 43 F.3d at 206 (quoting Tel-Phonic
Servs., Inc. v. TBS Int'l, Inc., 975 F.2d 1134, 1140 (5th Cir.1992)). Plaintiffs
specifically alleged that the Defendants entered into an agreement and that
each agreed to commit at least two predicate acts of racketeering. These

allegations are specific enough to state a claim that the Defendants
conspired to violate § 1962(c).
Summary
Requirements for pleading a RICO violation under 18 U.S.C. § 1962,
emphasizing the need to allege a pattern of racketeering activity and an
agreement to commit predicate acts. It highlights that a RICO civil
conspiracy complaint must specifically allege an agreement to commit at
least two predicate acts of racketeering. This is crucial for establishing a
RICO claim, as it ties the defendants' actions to the statutory requirements
of RICO violations.
Malvino v. Delluniversita, 840 F.3d 223 (5th Cir. 2016)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
To establish that pattern, a plaintiff must show both a relationship between
the predicate offenses—here mail fraud and wire fraud—and the threat of
continuing activity. H.J. Inc. v. Nw. Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 239, 109 S.Ct.
2893, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989). These requirements keep civil RICO focused
on the long term criminal conduct Congress intended it to address, see
Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479, 496 n.14, 105 S.Ct. 3275, 87
L.Ed.2d 346 (1985), and 'prevent RICO from becoming a surrogate for
garden-variety fraud actions properly brought under state law,' Tabas v.
Tabas, 47 F.3d 1280, 1310 (3d Cir. 1995) (quoting Midwest Grinding Co. v.
Spitz, 976 F.2d 1016, 1022 (7th Cir. 1992)).
Summary
In the Fifth Circuit, to plead predicate acts in a civil RICO complaint, a
plaintiff must demonstrate a pattern of racketeering activity. This involves
showing a relationship between the predicate offenses (such as wire fraud)
and a threat of continuing criminal activity. This requirement ensures that
RICO is applied to long-term criminal conduct rather than isolated incidents
or typical fraud cases that should be addressed under state law.
United States v. Imo, 739 F.3d 226 (5th Cir. 2014)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
To prove that a party has committed mail fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1341, the
Government must demonstrate “(1) the defendant devised or intended to
devise a scheme to defraud, (2) the mails were used for the purpose of

=== PAGE 38 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
executing, or attempting to execute, the scheme, and (3) the falsehoods
employed in the scheme were material.” United States v. Read, 710 F.3d
219, 227 (5th Cir.2012) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The
defendant must have known that “the scheme involved false
representations.” Id. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). “The
first element includes a defendant's scheme or artifice ... for obtaining
money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses,
representations, or promises....”
Summary
To plead predicate acts like wire fraud in a civil RICO complaint in the Fifth
Circuit, one must demonstrate a scheme to defraud, the use of
communication methods (like mail or wire) to execute the scheme, and the
materiality of falsehoods. The defendant must have known about the false
representations involved in the scheme. This framework can be applied to
wire fraud, which is relevant to the RICO complaint.
Allstate Ins. Co. v. Benhamou, 190 F.Supp.3d 631 (S.D. Tex. 2016)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of Texas
Extract
The elements of RICO mail fraud are: (1) a scheme to defraud by means of
false or fraudulent representation; (2) interstate or intrastate use of the
mails to execute the scheme; (3) the use of the mails by the defendant
connected with or incident to the scheme; and (4) actual injury to the
plaintiff. Landry, 901 F.2d at 428. Although reliance is not an element of
statutory mail or wire fraud, the Fifth Circuit does require its showing when
mail or wire fraud is alleged as a RICO predicate act. In re MasterCard
Intern., 313 F.3d at 263. Moreover, because Rule 9(b)'s particularity
requirement applies to the pleading of mail fraud as a predicate act in a
RICO case, Landry, 901 F.2d at 430, Plaintiffs 'must state with particularity
the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake.'
Summary
In the Fifth Circuit, when alleging mail or wire fraud as a predicate act in a
RICO complaint, the plaintiff must demonstrate a scheme to defraud, use of
the mails or wires to execute the scheme, and actual injury to the plaintiff.
Additionally, the Fifth Circuit requires a showing of reliance when mail or
wire fraud is alleged as a RICO predicate act. Rule 9(b)'s particularity
requirement also applies, necessitating that the plaintiff state with
particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake.

Extract
A pattern of racketeering activity requires two or more predicate acts and a
demonstration that the racketeering predicates are related and amount to or
pose a threat of continued criminal activity. See Word of Faith World
Outreach Ctr. Church, Inc. v. Sawyer, 90 F.3d 118, 122 (5th Cir. 1996).
Among other things, both RICO mail and wire fraud require evidence of
intent to defraud, i.e., evidence of a scheme to defraud by false or fraudulent
representations.
Summary
To plead predicate acts in a civil RICO complaint in the Fifth Circuit, a
plaintiff must demonstrate two or more predicate acts that are related and
pose a threat of continued criminal activity. Specifically, for mail and wire
fraud, there must be evidence of intent to defraud, which involves a scheme
to defraud by false or fraudulent representations. This means that the
factual record must include evidence showing the defendants' intent and the
fraudulent nature of their actions.
WASTE MANAGEMENT OF LOUISIANA v. River Birch, Inc., 920 F.3d 958
(5th Cir. 2019)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
RICO creates a private civil action to be brought by '[a]ny person injured in
his business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962 of this
chapter ....' Section 1962, which contains RICO’s criminal provision, makes
it 'unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise
engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate ... commerce, to
conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such
enterprise’s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.' Conspiracy to
violate section 1962 is also unlawful. And relevant here, bribery is a
predicate offense and enumerated as a 'racketeering activity' under 18
U.S.C. § 1961(1). 'The Supreme Court requires plaintiffs to establish both
but for cause and proximate cause in order to show injury ‘by reason of’ a
RICO violation.' 'Proximate cause should be evaluated in light of its common-
law foundations [and] ... requires ‘some direct relation between the injury
asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.’ ' 'When a court evaluates a
RICO claim for proximate cause, the central question it must ask is whether
the alleged violation led directly to the plaintiff's injuries.' Therefore, to
satisfy the causation element of RICO in this case, Plaintiff has the burden of
establishing that the payment to Nagin was the but for cause and proximate
cause of his decision to shutter the landfill. This burden requires Plaintiff to
establish that its damages 'w[ere] a foreseeable and natural consequence' of
Defendants’ action.

=== PAGE 40 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
In the Fifth Circuit, a civil RICO claim requires establishing both but-for and
proximate causation between the alleged RICO violation and the plaintiff's
injury. The plaintiff must demonstrate a direct relationship between the
injurious conduct and the injury claimed. This means that the predicate acts,
such as wire fraud, Travel Act violations, extortion, and fraudulent court
filings, must be directly tied to the injury suffered by the plaintiff. The
passage emphasizes the importance of showing that the injury was a
foreseeable and natural consequence of the defendants' actions.
N. Cypress Med. Ctr. Operating Co. v. Cigna Healthcare, 781 F.3d 182 (5th
Cir. 2015)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
North Cypress argues that it properly pled claims under RICO. The district
court held that North Cypress failed to state a plausible claim upon which
relief could be granted under any RICO provision, and thus dismissed these
claims under Rule 12(b)(6). Subsections 1962(a)-(d) of RICO essentially
state that: Three elements are common to claims brought under any of these
subsections: “(1) a person who engages in (2) a pattern of racketeering
activity, (3) connected to the acquisition, establishment, conduct, or control
of an enterprise.” The district court found that North Cypress presented
sufficient facts to plead a pattern of racketeering activity, but not the
individual RICO subsections. We consider each subsection in turn.
Summary
Three common elements required for pleading a RICO claim under any of
the subsections 1962(a)-(d): (1) a person who engages in (2) a pattern of
racketeering activity, (3) connected to the acquisition, establishment,
conduct, or control of an enterprise. This provides a foundational
understanding of what is necessary to plead a RICO claim in the Fifth
Circuit. The passage does not specifically address the requirements for
pleading predicate acts like wire fraud, Travel Act violations, extortion, or
fraudulent court filings, but it does establish the need to connect these acts
to a pattern of racketeering activity and an enterprise.

closed period by proving a series of related predicates extending over a
substantial period of time. Predicate acts extending over a few weeks or
months and threatening no future criminal conduct do not satisfy this
requirement: Congress was concerned in RICO with long-term criminal
conduct. Often a RICO action will be brought before continuity can be
established in this way. In such cases, liability depends on whether the
threat of continuity is demonstrated.
Summary
Necessity of demonstrating a pattern of racketeering activity, which involves
proving a series of related predicate acts over a substantial period. It
emphasizes that short-term acts without a threat of future criminal conduct
do not meet the continuity requirement. This is crucial for RICO claims, as
Congress intended to target long-term criminal conduct. The passage also
suggests that in some cases, the threat of continuity can be sufficient to
establish liability, even if the continuity itself is not yet fully demonstrated.
Van Duzer v. U.S. Bank Nat'l Ass'n, 995 F.Supp.2d 673 (S.D. Tex. 2014)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of Texas
Extract
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) imposes a heightened level of pleading
for fraud claims. A party bringing a fraud claim 'must state with particularity
the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake.' Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b). The
plaintiff must therefore 'specify the statements contended to be fraudulent,
identify the speaker, state when and where the statements were made, and
explain why the statements were fraudulent.' ... To state a civil RICO claim
under any subsection in 18 U.S.C. § 1962, 'there must be: (1) a person who
engages in (2) a pattern of racketeering activity (3) connected to the
acquisition, establishment, conduct, or control of an enterprise.' ... 'A
pattern of racketeering activity requires two or more predicate acts and a
demonstration that the racketeering predicates are related and amount to or
pose a threat of continued criminal activity.' ... The predicate acts
complained of by Plaintiffs are 'mail or wire fraud.' See18 U.S.C. §§ 1341,
1343. 'To state a claim for mail or wire fraud to support a RICO violation
under § 1341 or § 1343, a plaintiff must establish three elements; '(1) a
scheme or artifice to defraud or to obtain money or property by means of
false pretenses, representations, or promises; (2) a use of the interstate
mails or wires for the purpose of executing the scheme; and (3) a specific
intent to defraud either by [d]evising, participating in, or abetting the
scheme.'

Summary
Requirements for pleading fraud under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b),
which requires specificity in the allegations. For a civil RICO claim under 18
U.S.C. § 1962, the plaintiff must demonstrate a pattern of racketeering
activity, which includes at least two predicate acts that are related and pose
a threat of continued criminal activity. Specifically, for mail or wire fraud,
the plaintiff must establish a scheme to defraud, use of interstate mails or
wires, and specific intent to defraud. These elements must be tied to the
factual record by specifying the fraudulent statements, identifying the
speaker, and explaining the fraudulent nature of the statements.
Lavin v. Bank Of Am. Corp.
Extract
Typically, civil liability resulting from a violation of RICO requires the
defendant to engage in a 'pattern of racketeering activity.' 18 U.S.C. § 1962.
The Fifth Circuit requires a showing of two elements to demonstrate a
'pattern of racketeering activity': '(1) predicate acts-the requisite
racketeering activity, and (2) a pattern of such acts.' In re Burzynski, 989 F.
2d 733, 742 (5th Cir. 1993). 'Racketeering activity' is defined as the
commission of any number of state and federal offenses enumerated in
Section 1961(1), such as: mail fraud, wire fraud, drug trafficking, murder,
arson, gambling, bribery, extortion, or embezzlement. 18U.S.C. § 1961(1).
The United States Supreme Court has held that to prove a 'pattern' of
racketeering activity, a plaintiff must show that the predicate acts (1) are
related and (2) amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity.
H.J., Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 237, 239 (1989). A
plaintiff can satisfy the continuity requirement of the RICO statute by
establishing the defendants engaged in either closed conduct or open-ended
conduct-that is, a 'closed period of repeated conduct' or 'past conduct that
by its nature projects into the future with a threat of repetition.' H.J., Inc.,
492 U.S. at 241.
Summary
To plead predicate acts in a civil RICO complaint in the Fifth Circuit, a
plaintiff must demonstrate a pattern of racketeering activity. This requires
showing predicate acts that are related and pose a threat of continued
criminal activity. The continuity requirement can be satisfied by showing
either closed-ended or open-ended conduct. Predicate acts include offenses
like wire fraud, extortion, and others listed in 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1).

D&T Partners LLC v. Baymark Partners LP
Extract
All four subsections of § 1962 have three common elements: “1) a person
who engages in 2) a pattern of racketeering activity, 3) connected to the
acquisition, establishment, conduct, or control of an enterprise.” Crowe, 43
F.3d at 204 (emphasis omitted). The statute broadly defines “person” to
include “any individual or entity capable of holding a legal or beneficial
interest in property.” 18 U.S.C. § 1961(3); Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S.
938, 944 (2009) (“The term ‘any’ ensures that the definition has a wide
reach ....”). “To establish th[e] pattern [element], a plaintiff must show both
a relationship between the predicate offenses. .. and the threat of continuing
activity.” Malvino v. Delluniversita, 840 F.3d 223, 231 (5th Cir. 2016). “[A]n
enterprise. .. ‘is proved by evidence of an ongoing organization, formal or
informal, and by evidence that the various associates function as a
continuing unit.’” Boyle, 556 U.S. at 945 (quoting United States v. Turkette,

Summary
Requirements for pleading a civil RICO claim under § 1962, which includes
demonstrating a person engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity
connected to an enterprise. It emphasizes the need to show a relationship
between predicate offenses and a threat of continuing activity, as well as

Extract
To eradicate 'organized crime in the United States,' Congress passed the
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, a legislative package
that provided the government 'new weapons of unprecedented scope'
targeting organized crime at 'its economic roots.' ... RICO is also more than
a criminal statute. When drafting the legislation, Congress incorporated
provisions in RICO that allow private plaintiffs to seek redress in federal
court. If their lawsuit succeeds, the statute provides a big payout: Plaintiffs
are entitled to triple damages, court costs, and attorney's fees. 18 U.S.C. §
1964(c). ... By its terms, RICO makes it 'unlawful for any person employed
by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which
affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or
indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of
racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt.' 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). ...
In pursuing this action, D&T brings claims under three subsections of the
RICO statute. See id. §§ 1962 (a), (c) & (d). Though the subsections are
distinct, each shares three common elements: '(1) a person who engages in
(2) a pattern of racketeering activity, (3) connected to the acquisition,
establishment, conduct, or control of an enterprise.' Abraham v. Singh, 480
F.3d 351, 355 (5th Cir. 2007) (quoting Word of Faith World Outreach Ctr.

Plaintiff alleges that the defendants 'engaged in a pattern of racketing
activity' in violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations
Act ('RICO'), 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961-1968. (R. Doc. 1 at 22). To recover under
RICO, the plaintiff must establish three elements: (1) a person who engages
in (2) a pattern of racketeering activity (3) connected to the acquisition,
establishment, conduct, or control of an enterprise. Abraham v. Singh, 480 F.
3d 351, 355 (5th Cir. 2007) (quoting Word of Faith World Outreach Ctr.

Plaintiff fails to allege any non-conclusory predicate criminal acts of
'racketeering activity' sufficient to state a claim. 'A pattern of racketeering
activity requires two or more predicate acts and a demonstration that the
racketeering predicates are related and amount to or pose a threat of
continued criminal activity.' St. Paul Mercury Ins. Co. v. Williamson, 224 F.3d

United Healthcare Sevices, Inc. v. Next Health, LLC
Extract
A RICO plaintiff must allege facts to show a 'pattern of racketeering activity,'
which consists of two or more predicate criminal acts that are (1) related
and (2) amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity. See 18
U.S.C. §§ 1961(5), 1962(c). United alleges predicate acts of money
laundering and mail and wire fraud, which are racketeering activities. See
18 U.S.C. §§ 1341, 1343, 1956, 1961(1). Executive Defendants contend
United fails to adequately plead both the predicate acts with specificity and
that a pattern exists. To establish a money laundering violation, a plaintiff
must plead that a RICO defendant '(1) knowingly conducted a financial
transaction; (2) which involved the proceeds of an unlawful activity; and (3)
with the intent to promote or further unlawful activity.' U.S. v. Dovalina, 262
F.3d 472, 475 (5th Cir. 2001); 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(A)(i). The elements of a
claim for wire fraud are the same as mail fraud, except the second element
involves 'the use of, or causing the use of, wire communications in
furtherance of' the scheme. See United States v. Rush, 236 F. App'x 944, 947
(5th Cir. 2007); 18 U.S.C. § 1343.
Summary
Requirements for pleading predicate acts in a RICO complaint, specifically
in the Fifth Circuit. It emphasizes the need to show a pattern of racketeering
activity, which includes two or more related predicate acts that pose a threat

Summary
To plead a RICO claim in the Fifth Circuit, a plaintiff must establish: (1) a
person engaged in (2) a pattern of racketeering activity (3) connected to the
acquisition, establishment, conduct, or control of an enterprise. Predicate
acts such as wire fraud, Travel Act violations, and extortion must be detailed

fraudulent acts, as required by Rule 9(b).
Bustos v. Invierte En Tex.
Extract
To state a civil RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962, a plaintiff must allege
three common elements: “(1) a person who engages in (2) a pattern of
racketeering activity, (3) connected to the acquisition, establishment,
conduct, or control of an enterprise.” N. Cypress Med. Ctr. Operating Co.,
Ltd. v. Cigna Healthcare, 781 F.3d 182, 201 (5th Cir. 2015) (quotation
omitted). An act of “racketeering activity,” commonly referred to as a
“predicate act,” is defined to include certain criminal acts, including mail
and wire fraud, and any act indictable under the Immigration and
Nationality Act. See 18 U.S.C § 1961 (defining “racketeering activity”);
Waste Mgmt. of La., L.L.C. v. River Birch, Inc., 920 F.3d 958, 964 (5th Cir.
2019) (referring to racketeering activity as a “predicate act”). To rise to the
level of “racketeering activity” there must be two or more predicate acts
that are: (1) related; and (2) amount to or pose a threat of continued
criminal activity. Alvarez, 2020 WL 2061491, at *4 (quoting Abraham v.
Singh, 480 F.3d 351, 355 (5th Cir. 2007)); accord Word of Faith, 90 F.3d at
122. The “continuity” element is intended to “prevent RICO from becoming
a surrogate for garden-variety fraud actions properly brought under state
law.” Malvino v. Delluniversita, 840 F.3d 223, 231 (5th Cir. 2016) (quotation
omitted). Continuity can be demonstrated in two ways: “(1) a closed period
of repeated conduct, or (2) an open-ended period of conduct that by its
nature projects into the future with a threat of repetition.” Id. (cleaned up).
Summary
Requirements for pleading a civil RICO claim in the Fifth Circuit, including
the need to allege a pattern of racketeering activity with at least two related
predicate acts that pose a threat of continued criminal activity. This is
essential for understanding how to structure a RICO complaint and tie it to

875 F.3d 179 United States v. Gibson
Extract
A rational juror could find beyond a reasonable doubt that the Gibsons
joined a health care fraud conspiracy (Count 1). That crime comprises three
elements: that (1) two or more persons made an agreement to commit
health care fraud; (2) the defendant knew the unlawful purpose of the
agreement; and (3) the defendant joined in the agreement willfully, that is,
with the intent to further the unlawful purpose. United States v. Willett, 751
F.3d 335, 339 (5th Cir. 2014) (quotation marks omitted). The jury need not
find that the defendants 'actually submitted the fraudulent documentation'
to convict. United States v. Umawa Oke Imo, 739 F.3d 226, 235 (5th Cir.
2014). In fact, the government need not show an overt act at all. United
States v. Njoku, 737 F.3d 55, 67–68 (5th Cir. 2013). Nor must the
prosecution show direct evidence of the conspiracy; 'each element may be
inferred from circumstantial evidence.' Willett, 751 F.3d at 339 (quotation
marks omitted). The illegal agreement may even be 'silent and informal.' Id.
(quotation marks omitted). Still, a conviction must rest on sturdier legs than
mere inference or supposition. United States v. Grant, 683 F.3d 639, 642
(5th Cir. 2012) ('[T]he government must do more than pile inference upon
inference upon which to base a conspiracy charge.' (quotation marks
omitted)).
Summary
In the Fifth Circuit, to plead a conspiracy, including those involving RICO
predicate acts like wire fraud, Travel Act violations, and extortion, the
government must show that two or more persons made an agreement to
commit an unlawful act, the defendant knew the unlawful purpose of the
agreement, and the defendant joined the agreement willfully. The
government does not need to show that the defendants actually committed
the unlawful act or that there was an overt act. Circumstantial evidence can
be used to infer the elements of the conspiracy, but the evidence must be
more than mere inference or supposition.
Earl v. The Boeing Co.

A RICO plaintiff may bring 'a private civil action to recover treble damages
for injury ‘by reason of a violation of’ [RICO's] substantive provisions.'
Sedima, 473 U.S. at 481 (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c)). Succeeding on a
RICO cause of action requires a plaintiff to prove two separate aspects: (1)

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
substantive violation of the statute, and (2) statutory standing. See Nolen v.
Nucentrix Broadband Networks Inc., 293 F.3d 926, 929 (5th Cir. 2002). On
the substantive-violation front, § 1962 of RICO 'sets forth four specific
prohibitions aimed at different ways in which a pattern of racketeering
activity may be used to infiltrate, control, or operate ‘an enterprise which is
engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce.'
RJR Nabisco, Inc. v. European Cmty., 136 S.Ct. 2090, 2097 (2016) (brackets
omitted). Here, Plaintiffs allege two violations of prohibitions (see Dkt. #165
at pp. 87-93). Under § 1962(c), it is unlawful for 'any person employed by or
associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect,
interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or
indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of
racketeering activity.' 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). Under § 1962(d), it is unlawful for
'any person to conspire to violate' any of § 1962's first three subsections. Id.
§ 1962(d). Though each § 1962 subsection varies, all RICO plaintiffs 'must
establish three common elements: ‘(1) a person who engages in (2) a pattern
of racketeering activity, (3) connected to the acquisition, establishment,
conduct, or control of an enterprise.' Snow Ingredients, Inc. v. SnoWizard,

Chapter 4. Elements of Cause of Action
Civil RICO: A Definitive Guide. Fifth Edition - American Bar
Association - Gregory P. Joseph
Extract
In order to survive a motion to dismiss, a plaintiff must allege facts sufficient
to support each of the statutory elements for at least two of the pleaded
predicate acts. To be criminal, conduct must be committed with the mens
rea appropriate to the offense. In order to establish liability under RICO, the
plaintiff must prove that the defendant acted with the appropriate mens rea
at one or two levels, depending on the circuit. In all circuits, the defendant
must possess 'the specific intent associated with the various underlying
predicate offenses.'
Summary
To plead predicate acts in a civil RICO complaint, a plaintiff must allege
facts sufficient to support each statutory element of at least two predicate
acts. The conduct must be criminal, committed with the appropriate mens
rea, and the defendant must have the specific intent associated with the
predicate offenses. This requirement is generally applicable across all
circuits, including the Fifth Circuit.

Reves "operation or management" test to RICO conspiracy.
Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology - Northwestern University,
School of Law - Baumgarterl, Sarah - 2006-09-22
Extract
Mere participation in the predicate offenses listed in RICO, even in
conjunction with a RICO enterprise, may be insufficient to support a RICO
cause of action. A defendant's participation must be in the conduct of the

=== PAGE 51 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
affairs of a RICO enterprise, which ordinarily will require some participation
in the operation or management of the enterprise itself.
Summary
For a civil RICO complaint, it is not enough to merely allege that a defendant
participated in predicate offenses. The defendant must have participated in
the conduct of the enterprise's affairs, which typically requires involvement
in the operation or management of the enterprise. This is crucial for
establishing liability under § 1962(c) of RICO.

complaint, as it provides the necessary elements that must be demonstrated
in the factual record.

Blue-collar crime: conspiracy, organized labor, and the anti-union civil RICO
claim.
Albany Law Review - Albany Law School - Levin, Benjamin -
2011-09-22
Extract
To succeed in a civil RICO action, a plaintiff must show the '(1) conduct (2)
of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity.' In turn, a
'pattern of racketeering activity' requires at least two 'predicate acts' in a
ten-year period.
Summary
A civil RICO action requires demonstrating conduct of an enterprise through
a pattern of racketeering activity, which includes at least two predicate acts
within a ten-year period. This framework is applicable to civil RICO claims in
general, including those in the Fifth Circuit.
Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy
The Brief - American Bar Association - 2024-01-01
Extract
A violation of § 1962(c), the section on which Sedima relies, requires (1)
conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity. The plaintiff must allege each of the elements to state a claim. They
are all equally essential components, and the complaint will fail if any one of
them is not adequately pleaded. In particular, RICO claims based on mail or
wire fraud must comport with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b)’s
requirement that allegations involving fraud be pleaded with particularity.
The practitioner through their pleadings must articulate with great care and
attention a viable racketeering... the RICO scheme and its damages. If there
was no money or property belonging originally to the plaintiffs and taken
into the possession of the defendants as the primary purpose of the scheme,
there is not a valid civil RICO claim.
Summary
A civil RICO complaint must allege conduct of an enterprise through a
pattern of racketeering activity. Each element must be adequately pleaded,
and for claims based on fraud, such as wire fraud, the allegations must meet
the particularity requirements of Rule 9(b). This means the complaint must
describe the predicate acts with specificity, including the time, place, and
content of the alleged fraudulent communications. The passage emphasizes
the importance of articulating a viable racketeering scheme and

demonstrating that the primary purpose of the scheme was to take money or
property from the plaintiffs.
§ 5.06 Mail and Wire Fraud
Intellectual Property and Computer Crimes - Full Court Press -
2020-00-00
Extract
The federal government has routinely charged defendants with violating
Sections 1341 (mail fraud) and 1343 (wire fraud) by engaging in a scheme to
defraud individuals of money or other tangible property interests. While
neither statute provides guidance to the meaning of scheme to defraud,
courts generally emphasize any false or misleading statements made by the
defendant to the victim. It is not necessary for the government to establish
that the defendant had direct contact with the victim. Misrepresentations or
omissions must be material and have been 'reasonably calculated to deceive
persons of ordinary prudence and comprehension.' Since this is an objective
standard, the government is not required to prove that the victim was
actually harmed or that the scheme was successful. Courts, instead, focus on
whether a reasonable person would have...
Summary
Requirements for establishing wire fraud, which is a predicate act under
RICO. It emphasizes that false or misleading statements must be material
and calculated to deceive. The government does not need to prove direct
contact with the victim or actual harm, focusing instead on the potential to
deceive a reasonable person. This aligns with the requirements for pleading
wire fraud in a civil RICO complaint, where the focus is on the scheme to
defraud and the use of interstate communications.

Summary
To plead predicate acts in a civil RICO complaint, the plaintiff must establish
the existence of an enterprise, its engagement in interstate commerce, the
defendant's association with the enterprise, and the defendant's
participation in the enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering
activity. This framework is essential for tying the factual record to the legal
requirements of a RICO claim.

Defending Civil RICO Claims: A Defense Plan Should Be In Every Business's
Arsenal
Extract
Second, to prove most types of RICO claims, the plaintiff must plead that the
defendant committed some qualifying criminal action, the most common of
which is mail, wire or securities fraud. Business deals gone sour do not
count. Rather, the plaintiff must be able to prove the elements of the
asserted crime, and often an intent to defraud. If there is nothing criminal in
nature about the complained-of conduct, RICO should not apply. It is an
abuse of the RICO statute to attempt to shoehorn ordinary business or
contractual disputes into a civil RICO claim. Third, the plaintiff must plead a
pattern of racketeering activity for most RICO claims. If the alleged conduct
occurred once or twice, or was not continuous, it cannot form a pattern of
conduct sufficient to support a RICO claim. And oftentimes, because there is

a fraud component, those instances must be particularly identified in the
plaintiff's pleading—a barrier that can prove difficult to accomplish.
Summary
Necessity for a plaintiff to plead that the defendant committed a qualifying
criminal action, such as wire fraud, and to prove the elements of the
asserted crime, including intent to defraud. It also emphasizes the need to
plead a pattern of racketeering activity, which requires more than isolated
incidents and must be continuous. The passage highlights the importance of
identifying specific instances of fraud in the pleading.
