Question
Plaintiff alleges a coordinated scheme involving multiple defendants (Myers,
Branthoover, Carter, Baker, Munford, Kaitcer) to deprive him of property,
business interests, and parental rights through fraudulent court filings,
misrepresentations, and manipulation of judicial process. To state a civil
RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), a plaintiff must allege: (1) conduct (2)
of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity (5) causing
injury to business or property. See Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S.
479, 496 (1985); St. Paul Mercury Ins. Co. v. Williamson, 224 F.3d 425, 439
(5th Cir. 2000). The timeline, if proven, supports each RICO element as
follows: "Enterprise" under RICO includes any group of individuals
associated in fact, even if not a legal entity. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4); Boyle v.
United States, 556 U.S. 938, 944 (2009). Paragraphs A, B, D, and Q describe
a group (Myers, Branthoover, Carter, Baker, Munford, Kaitcer) acting in
concert with a common purpose: to obtain a divorce decree for Myers and
deprive Plaintiff of property and business interests. This satisfies the
"enterprise" element. A "pattern of racketeering activity" requires at least
two predicate acts of racketeering within ten years. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5). The
following timeline events allege predicate acts: - Wire fraud: B.3 (interstate
transfer of funds via PayPal for fraudulent purpose), Q.54-58 (alleged
manipulation of court filings via electronic means). - Mail fraud: E.7, E.8, E.9
(service of fraudulent pleadings via U.S. Constable). - Extortion: M.36
(alleged coercion to sign orders under threat of adverse judicial action). -
Obstruction of justice: Q.54-59, R.60-66 (alleged tampering with court
filings, denial of recusal hearings). - Travel Act violations: B.2, B.3
(interstate travel to further fraudulent scheme). Racketeering activity
includes wire fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343), mail fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1341),
extortion (18 U.S.C. § 1951), and obstruction of justice (18 U.S.C. § 1503).
See 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1). The timeline alleges at least two predicate acts by
multiple defendants, satisfying the "pattern" requirement. RICO requires
that the enterprise’s activities affect interstate or foreign commerce. 18
U.S.C. § 1962(c). Plaintiff’s business serves clients in the United States,
Canada, and the United Kingdom (B.2), and the alleged wire fraud involved
interstate transfers (B.3). The enterprise’s activities affected interstate
commerce. Plaintiff must show injury to business or property "by reason of"
the RICO violation. 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c); Holmes v. Sec. Investor Prot. Corp.,
503 U.S. 258, 268 (1992). Plaintiff alleges loss of business income,
deprivation of residence, and loss of property as a direct result of the
defendants’ actions (B.2, F.8-9, M.37, K.28-31). Plaintiff has alleged injury to
business and property proximately caused by the alleged racketeering
activity. A RICO claim may proceed even if each defendant participated in
different predicate acts, so long as each act was intended to further the
enterprise’s affairs. United States v. Elliott, 571 F.2d 880, 902 (5th Cir.
1978). The timeline attributes different roles and acts to each defendant, but
all are alleged to further the enterprise’s common purpose. In RICO mail/
wire fraud cases, the plaintiff need not prove personal reliance, but must
show that someone relied on the misrepresentations and that this caused
the injury. Bridge v. Phoenix Bond & Indem. Co., 553 U.S. 639, 649 (2008).
Plaintiff alleges that the court and law enforcement relied on the fraudulent

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
filings and misrepresentations, resulting in adverse orders and loss of
property. Judicial immunity generally bars civil suits against judges for acts
taken in their judicial capacity, but does not bar claims for non-judicial acts
or acts taken in the clear absence of jurisdiction. See Mireles v. Waco, 502
U.S. 9, 11-12 (1991). Plaintiff alleges that certain acts by Munford and
Kaitcer (e.g., ex parte orders, refusal to consider evidence, manipulation of
filings) were outside their judicial capacity or in clear absence of jurisdiction
(M.36, Q.54-59, R.60-66), but this is a high bar and will be a key defense
issue. Court staff (e.g., coordinators) may have qualified immunity for
discretionary acts, but not for ministerial or administrative acts outside the
scope of their duties. See Davis v. Tarrant County, 565 F.3d 214, 228 (5th
Cir. 2009). Allegations against Baker (Q.55-59, V.91) focus on administrative
manipulation of filings, which may fall outside protected functions if proven.
Attorneys may be liable under RICO if they participate in the conduct of the
enterprise’s affairs through racketeering activity. See Handeen v. Lemaire,
112 F.3d 1339, 1348 (8th Cir. 1997). Carter and Branthoover are alleged to
have participated in preparing and submitting fraudulent documents and
communications (B.2-3, D.5, M.36), supporting their inclusion as RICO
defendants. A RICO complaint must plead facts with particularity for
predicate acts of fraud (Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b)), including time, place, content,
and identity of the parties. The timeline provides detailed dates,
communications, and actions for each alleged predicate act, supporting the
particularity requirement. In sum, the timeline, if proven, alleges: (1)
conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity
(5) causing injury to business or property, and ties specific acts to each
defendant. The main legal hurdles will be judicial/staff immunity and
causation, but the pleading meets the elements of a civil RICO claim under
Fifth Circuit law. 
Answer (Fifth Circuit)
Short response
If the plaintiff’s allegations are taken as true and supported by evidence, the
complaint sufficiently pleads all elements of a civil RICO claim under 18
U.S.C. § 1962(c) as interpreted by the Fifth Circuit, including conduct of an
enterprise, a pattern of racketeering activity, and injury to business or
property. The principal legal challenges will be judicial and staff immunity,
as well as establishing proximate causation, but the pleading meets the
threshold requirements for a RICO claim.
Summary
The plaintiff alleges a coordinated scheme by multiple defendants to deprive
him of property, business interests, and parental rights through fraudulent
court filings, misrepresentations, and manipulation of the judicial process.
Under Fifth Circuit law, to state a civil RICO claim, a plaintiff must allege (1)
conduct, (2) of an enterprise, (3) through a pattern, (4) of racketeering
activity, (5) causing injury to business or property, and the complaint, if
proven, appears to satisfy each of these elements.

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
The timeline details predicate acts such as wire fraud, mail fraud, extortion,
obstruction of justice, and Travel Act violations, all of which are recognized
as racketeering activities under RICO. The complaint also alleges that the
enterprise’s activities affected interstate commerce and that the plaintiff
suffered direct injury as a result. While the allegations are sufficient to
survive a motion to dismiss, the main obstacles will be the application of
judicial and staff immunity and the need to prove that the alleged
racketeering activity was the proximate cause of the plaintiff’s injuries.
Background and Relevant Law
Statutory Framework
Civil RICO claims are governed by 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961–1964. Section 1962(c)
makes it unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any
enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign
commerce, to conduct or participate in the conduct of such enterprise’s
affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity. Section 1961(1) defines
“racketeering activity” to include a wide range of federal and state crimes,
including mail fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1341), wire fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343),
extortion (18 U.S.C. § 1951), obstruction of justice (18 U.S.C. § 1503), and
Travel Act violations (18 U.S.C. § 1952). Section 1961(4) defines “enterprise”
to include any group of individuals associated in fact, even if not a legal
entity. Section 1961(5) requires at least two acts of racketeering activity
within ten years to establish a “pattern.”
Section 1964(c) provides a private right of action for “[a]ny person injured
in his business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962,”
allowing for treble damages.
Case Law
The Fifth Circuit and Supreme Court have articulated the elements of a civil
RICO claim as follows: (1) conduct, (2) of an enterprise, (3) through a
pattern, (4) of racketeering activity, (5) causing injury to business or
property, and (6) proximate causation between the RICO violation and the
injury, as set out in St. Paul Mercury Ins. Co. v. Williamson, 224 F.3d 425,
439 (5th Cir. 2000) and Holmes v. Sec. Investor Prot. Corp., 503 U.S. 258,
268 (1992). The “enterprise” element is satisfied by any group of individuals
associated in fact for a common purpose, as clarified by the Supreme Court
in Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938, 944 (2009) and applied in Allstate
Ins. Co. v. Benhamou, 190 F.Supp.3d 631, 648 (S.D. Tex. 2016).
A “pattern of racketeering activity” requires at least two predicate acts
within ten years, and the acts must be related and amount to or pose a
threat of continued criminal activity (Megatel Homes, LLC v. Moayedi, Civil
Action 3:20-CV-00688-L (N.D. Tex. Nov 16, 2021); Abraham v. Singh, 480 F.
3d 351, 355 (5th Cir. 2007)). Predicate acts include mail and wire fraud,
extortion, and obstruction of justice (RICO: A Primer (2022)). The
enterprise’s activities must affect interstate or foreign commerce, but courts

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
have held that even a minimal or potential impact suffices (Racketeer
influenced and corrupt organizations. (2011)).
To have standing, the plaintiff must show injury to business or property
proximately caused by the RICO violation (Holmes v. Sec. Investor Prot.
Corp., 503 U.S. 258, 268 (1992); Megatel Homes, LLC v. Moayedi, Civil
Action 3:20-CV-00688-L (N.D. Tex. Nov 16, 2021)). In RICO cases predicated
on mail or wire fraud, the Supreme Court has held that the plaintiff need not
show personal reliance on the misrepresentations, only that someone relied
and that this caused the injury (Bridge v. Phoenix Bond & Indem. Co., 553
U.S. 639, 649 (2008); Chapter 4. Elements of Cause of Action).
Immunity Doctrines
Judicial immunity generally bars civil suits against judges for acts taken in
their judicial capacity, but not for non-judicial acts or acts taken in the clear
absence of jurisdiction (Mireles v. Waco, 502 U.S. 9, 11-12 (1991)). Court
staff may have qualified immunity for discretionary acts but not for
ministerial or administrative acts outside the scope of their duties (Davis v.
Tarrant County, 565 F.3d 214, 228 (5th Cir. 2009)). Attorneys may be liable
under RICO if they participate in the conduct of the enterprise’s affairs
through racketeering activity (Handeen v. Lemaire, 112 F.3d 1339, 1348 (8th
Cir. 1997)).
Pleading Standards
RICO claims based on fraud must be pleaded with particularity under
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b), requiring details as to the time, place,
content, and identity of the parties involved in the alleged fraudulent acts
(Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy (2024)).
Analysis
1. Conduct of an Enterprise
The complaint alleges that Myers, Branthoover, Carter, Baker, Munford, and
Kaitcer acted in concert with a common purpose to obtain a divorce decree
for Myers and deprive the plaintiff of property and business interests. Under
RICO, an “enterprise” includes any group of individuals associated in fact,
even if not a legal entity (18 U.S.C. § 1961(4); Boyle v. United States, 556
U.S. 938, 944 (2009)). The Fifth Circuit has consistently recognized that an
association-in-fact enterprise may be formed by individuals who coordinate
their actions for a common goal (Allstate Ins. Co. v. Benhamou, 190 F.Supp.
3d 631, 648 (S.D. Tex. 2016)). The timeline’s description of coordinated
actions by the defendants, if proven, is sufficient to satisfy the “enterprise”
element.

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
2. Pattern of Racketeering Activity
A “pattern of racketeering activity” requires at least two predicate acts
within ten years (18 U.S.C. § 1961(5)). The complaint alleges multiple
predicate acts, including:
Wire fraud (interstate transfer of funds via PayPal for fraudulent
purposes, manipulation of court filings via electronic means)
Mail fraud (service of fraudulent pleadings via U.S. Constable)
Extortion (coercion to sign orders under threat of adverse judicial
action)
Obstruction of justice (tampering with court filings, denial of recusal
hearings)
Travel Act violations (interstate travel to further the fraudulent
scheme)
All of these are recognized as racketeering activities under RICO (18 U.S.C.
§ 1961(1); RICO: A Primer (2022)). The timeline attributes at least two
predicate acts to multiple defendants, and the acts are related to the affairs
of the alleged enterprise, satisfying the “pattern” requirement (Megatel
Homes, LLC v. Moayedi, Civil Action 3:20-CV-00688-L (N.D. Tex. Nov 16,
2021); St. Paul Mercury Ins. Co. v. Williamson, 224 F.3d 425, 439 (5th Cir.
2000)).
The pattern requirement also demands continuity—either a closed-ended
period of repeated acts or an open-ended threat of continued criminal
activity (RICO: A Primer (2022); Racketeer influenced and corrupt
organizations. (2021)). The complaint’s timeline, if accurate, describes a
series of interrelated acts over a substantial period, supporting closed-ended
continuity.
3. Effect on Interstate Commerce
RICO requires that the enterprise’s activities affect interstate or foreign
commerce (18 U.S.C. § 1962(c)). Courts have held that even a minimal or
potential impact on interstate commerce is sufficient (Racketeer influenced
and corrupt organizations. (2011); RICO: A Primer (2022)). The plaintiff’s
business serves clients in the United States, Canada, and the United
Kingdom, and the alleged wire fraud involved interstate transfers. These
facts, if proven, are adequate to meet the interstate commerce requirement.
4. Injury to Business or Property and Proximate Cause
To have standing, the plaintiff must show injury to business or property
proximately caused by the RICO violation (Holmes v. Sec. Investor Prot.
Corp., 503 U.S. 258, 268 (1992); Megatel Homes, LLC v. Moayedi, Civil
Action 3:20-CV-00688-L (N.D. Tex. Nov 16, 2021)). The complaint alleges
loss of business income, deprivation of residence, and loss of property as a
direct result of the defendants’ actions. These are recognized forms of injury
under RICO (St. Paul Mercury Ins. Co. v. Williamson, 224 F.3d 425, 439 (5th
Cir. 2000)).
•

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
In RICO cases predicated on mail or wire fraud, the Supreme Court has
clarified that the plaintiff need not show personal reliance on the
misrepresentations; it is sufficient that someone relied and that this caused
the injury (Bridge v. Phoenix Bond & Indem. Co., 553 U.S. 639, 649 (2008); 
Chapter 4. Elements of Cause of Action). The complaint alleges that the
court and law enforcement relied on the fraudulent filings and
misrepresentations, resulting in adverse orders and loss of property, which
is sufficient to meet this standard.
5. Participation by Multiple Defendants
RICO liability may attach even if each defendant participated in different
predicate acts, as long as each act was intended to further the enterprise’s
affairs (U.S. v. Elliott, 571 F.2d 880, 902 (5th Cir. 1978)). The timeline
attributes different roles and acts to each defendant, but all are alleged to
further the enterprise’s common purpose. The Fifth Circuit has recognized
that direct evidence of agreement is not necessary; circumstantial evidence
of coordinated conduct may suffice (U.S. v. Elliott, 571 F.2d 880, 902 (5th
Cir. 1978)).
6. Pleading Particularity
RICO claims based on fraud must be pleaded with particularity under Rule
9(b), including details as to time, place, content, and identity of the parties
involved (Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy (2024)). The complaint’s timeline
provides detailed dates, communications, and actions for each alleged
predicate act, which supports the particularity requirement.
7. Immunity Issues
Judicial Immunity
Judicial immunity generally bars civil suits against judges for acts taken in
their judicial capacity, but not for non-judicial acts or acts taken in the clear
absence of jurisdiction (Mireles v. Waco, 502 U.S. 9, 11-12 (1991)). The
complaint alleges that certain acts by Munford and Kaitcer (e.g., ex parte
orders, refusal to consider evidence, manipulation of filings) were outside
their judicial capacity or in clear absence of jurisdiction. However, this is a
high bar, and courts are reluctant to find that judges acted outside their
judicial capacity or without jurisdiction. This will be a significant defense
issue.
Staff Immunity
Court staff may have qualified immunity for discretionary acts but not for
ministerial or administrative acts outside the scope of their duties (Davis v.
Tarrant County, 565 F.3d 214, 228 (5th Cir. 2009)). Allegations against Baker
focus on administrative manipulation of filings, which, if proven to be
outside protected functions, may not be shielded by immunity.

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Attorney Liability
Attorneys may be liable under RICO if they participate in the conduct of the
enterprise’s affairs through racketeering activity (Handeen v. Lemaire, 112
F.3d 1339, 1348 (8th Cir. 1997)). The complaint alleges that Carter and
Branthoover participated in preparing and submitting fraudulent documents
and communications, supporting their inclusion as RICO defendants.
8. Subsequent Negative Treatment of Authorities
Some authorities cited in the analysis have been subject to subsequent
negative treatment:
U.S. v. Phillips, 664 F.2d 971 (5th Cir. 1981) was superseded by statute
in United States v. Lechuga, No. 19-40483 (5th Cir. Jul 09, 2020).
However, the basic elements of a RICO claim as articulated in Phillips
remain consistent with current law, as confirmed by more recent
authorities such as St. Paul Mercury Ins. Co. v. Williamson, 224 F.3d
425 (5th Cir. 2000) and Abraham v. Singh, 480 F.3d 351 (5th Cir. 2007).
Smoky Greenhaw Cotton Co., Inc. v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and
Smith, Inc., 785 F.2d 1274 (5th Cir. 1986) was stated as vacated by 
Jacobson v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., 797 F.2d 1197
(3rd Cir. 1986). While this affects the precedential value of Smoky
Greenhaw, the elements of a RICO claim as stated therein are
consistent with subsequent Fifth Circuit and Supreme Court authority.
Accordingly, the analysis relies primarily on more recent and unaffected
authorities for the core elements of a RICO claim.
Exceptions and Caveats
While the complaint, if proven, meets the elements of a civil RICO claim,
several significant hurdles remain:
Judicial Immunity: Claims against judges for acts taken in their
judicial capacity are likely to be barred unless the plaintiff can show the
acts were non-judicial or taken in clear absence of jurisdiction, which is
a difficult standard to meet.
Staff Immunity: Court staff may be immune for discretionary acts but
not for administrative acts outside their duties; the facts must support
the latter.
Causation: The plaintiff must establish that the alleged racketeering
activity was the proximate cause of his injury. While the reliance
requirement is relaxed for mail and wire fraud, causation must still be
shown.
Pleading Particularity: The complaint must continue to meet the
heightened pleading standard for fraud under Rule 9(b).

Conclusion
In summary, the plaintiff’s complaint, if the allegations are proven,
sufficiently pleads all elements of a civil RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. §
1962(c) as interpreted by the Fifth Circuit. The complaint alleges conduct of
an enterprise, a pattern of racketeering activity, effect on interstate
commerce, and injury to business or property proximately caused by the
alleged racketeering. The main legal obstacles will be the application of
judicial and staff immunity and the need to establish proximate causation,
but the pleading meets the threshold requirements to proceed. The analysis
is supported by current and controlling authority, with due consideration
given to subsequent negative treatment of older cases.
Legal Authorities
Allstate Ins. Co. v. Donovan, CIVIL ACTION NO. H-12-0432 (S.D. Tex. Jul 03,
2012)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of Texas
Extract
RICO provides civil causes of action for recovery of treble damages for '[a]ny
person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section
1962 of this chapter.' 18 U.S.C. § 1964 (c). Plaintiffs have alleged that
defendants have violated §§ 1962(c) and (d). These subsections state: 18
U.S.C. §§ 1962(c) and (d). The Fifth Circuit has interpreted these subsections
to mean that 'a person who is employed by or associated with an enterprise
cannot conduct the affairs of the enterprise through a pattern of
racketeering activity[, and that] a person cannot conspire to violate
subsection[]. .. (c).' ... Defendants argue that plaintiffs' RICO claims should
be dismissed because plaintiffs have not alleged facts capable of
establishing (1) a pattern of racketeering activity, (2) a RICO enterprise,
and/or (3) a RICO conspiracy.
Summary
Requirements for a civil RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c), specifically
addressing the need to establish a pattern of racketeering activity, a RICO
enterprise, and a RICO conspiracy. It highlights the interpretation by the
Fifth Circuit that a person associated with an enterprise cannot conduct its
affairs through racketeering activity and cannot conspire to violate RICO
provisions. This aligns with the proposition that the plaintiff must
demonstrate a coordinated scheme involving multiple defendants to
establish a RICO claim.
U.S. v. Welch, 656 F.2d 1039 (5th Cir. 1981)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit

=== PAGE 9 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
The RICO count charged that the four defendants violated 18 U.S.C.A. §
1962(c) by conducting the affairs of the Sheriff's Office through a pattern of
racketeering activity. Engaging in a 'pattern of racketeering activity'
requires at least two acts of racketeering within a ten-year period. Finally,
racketeering activity is expressly defined to include only certain types of
conduct... As the Elliott Court concluded, the enterprise supplies a unifying
link between all the predicate acts charged, since all the predicate acts must
be committed in the conduct of the affairs of an enterprise.
Summary
The case "U.S. v. Welch" provides a clear explanation of the elements
required to establish a RICO violation, including the need for a pattern of
racketeering activity and the conduct of an enterprise's affairs through such
a pattern. This directly supports the proposition by illustrating how multiple
defendants can be involved in a coordinated scheme that constitutes a RICO
violation, as long as the predicate acts are related to the enterprise's affairs.
St. Paul Mercury Ins v. Williamson, 224 F.3d 425 (5th Cir. 2000)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
RICO creates a civil cause of action for '[a]ny person injured in his business
or property by reason of a violation of section 1962.' ... Under all those
subsections, to state a RICO claim, there must be: '(1) a person who engages
in (2) a pattern of racketeering activity (3) connected to the acquisition,
establishment, conduct, or control of an enterprise.' ... Despite the
problems, we believe that St. Paul has sufficiently distinguished and
established a genuine issue of material fact as to the existence of a prior
pattern of racketeering activity, which may have produced income that was
invested into a RICO enterprise, causing injuries to St. Paul in the form of
legal costs.
Summary
Necessary elements to state a RICO claim, which include a person engaging
in a pattern of racketeering activity connected to an enterprise. The case
also discusses the sufficiency of establishing a genuine issue of material fact
regarding a pattern of racketeering activity, which is relevant to the
proposition that the plaintiff alleges a coordinated scheme involving multiple
defendants.
U.S. v. Edwards, 303 F.3d 606 (5th Cir. 2002)

=== PAGE 10 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
Contrary to his assertion, Stephen Edwards is not being punished for
committing the substantive acts found to be 'not proven.' He is being
punished for conducting the affairs of an enterprise through a pattern of
racketeering activity. The jury found that he and Brown were RICO co-
conspirators and that Brown, as part of that conspiracy, extorted money
pursuant to the LRGC/NORC scheme. Accordingly, the money extorted
constitutes the proceeds of the enterprise. Therefore, Stephen Edwards is
appropriately held responsible for that loss.
Summary
The court upheld the RICO conviction by emphasizing that a defendant can
be held responsible for the actions of co-conspirators within a RICO
enterprise, even if they did not directly commit the acts themselves. This
supports the proposition that different defendants can be held liable for
participating in a coordinated scheme if their actions further the
enterprise's affairs.
U.S. v. Elliott, 571 F.2d 880 (5th Cir. 1978)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
The substantive proscriptions of the RICO statute apply to insiders and
outsiders those merely 'associated with' an enterprise who participate
directly and indirectly in the enterprise's affairs through a pattern of
racketeering activity. 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c)... Thus, the RICO net is woven
tightly to trap even the smallest fish, those peripherally involved with the
enterprise. This effect is enhanced by principles of conspiracy law also
developed to facilitate prosecution of conspirators at all levels. Direct
evidence of agreement is unnecessary: 'proof of such an agreement may rest
upon inferences drawn from relevant and competent circumstantial
evidence ordinarily the acts and conduct of the alleged conspirators
themselves'.
Summary
The RICO statute is designed to apply broadly to individuals associated with
an enterprise, whether they are insiders or outsiders. The passage
emphasizes that direct evidence of an agreement is not necessary; rather,
inferences can be drawn from circumstantial evidence, such as the acts and
conduct of the alleged conspirators. This supports the proposition that
multiple defendants can be implicated in a coordinated scheme under RICO,
even if their involvement varies in degree.

Allstate Ins. Co. v. Benhamou, 190 F.Supp.3d 631 (S.D. Tex. 2016)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of Texas
Extract
RICO makes it 'unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any
enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign
commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of
such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity or
collection of unlawful debt.' Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938, 943–45,
129 S.Ct. 2237, 173 L.Ed.2d 1265 (2009) (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) )
(internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, to establish liability under §
1962(c) one must allege and prove the existence of two distinct entities: (1)
a 'person'; and (2) an 'enterprise' that is not simply the same 'person'
referred to by a different name.
Summary
Requirements for establishing a RICO violation under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c),
which includes proving the existence of a "person" and an "enterprise"
engaged in racketeering activity. This directly supports the proposition that
the plaintiff must allege a coordinated scheme involving multiple defendants
(the "persons") acting as an "enterprise" to conduct racketeering activities,
such as fraudulent court filings and misrepresentations.

Extract
In order to prove a substantive RICO violation, 18 U.S.C.A. § 1962(c), the
Government must prove the following elements: (1) the existence of an
enterprise which affects interstate or foreign commerce; (2) that the
defendant 'associated with' the enterprise; (3) that the defendant
participated in the conduct of the enterprise's affairs; and (4) that the
participation was through a pattern of racketeering activity, i.e., by
committing at least two acts of racketeering activity designated in 18
U.S.C.A. § 1961(1). ... The enterprise is an entity, for present purposes a
group of persons associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a
course of conduct. The pattern of racketeering activity is, on the other hand,
a series of criminal acts as defined by the statute. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1).
Summary
Elements required to establish a substantive RICO violation under 18 U.S.C.
§ 1962(c), which aligns with the elements needed for the plaintiff's claim. It

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
emphasizes the need for an enterprise affecting interstate commerce,
association with the enterprise, participation in its affairs, and a pattern of
racketeering activity. This directly supports the proposition that the
plaintiff's allegations, if proven, could meet the criteria for a RICO claim.
Abraham v. Singh, 480 F.3d 351 (5th Cir. 2007)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
Plaintiffs allege that Defendants violated 18 U.S.C. § 1962(a), (b), (c), and
(d). These RICO subsections state, in their simplest terms, that: ... (c) a
person who is employed by or associated with an enterprise cannot conduct
the affairs of the enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity; and
(d) a person cannot conspire to violate subsections (a), (b), or (c). ...
Plaintiffs have also alleged that Defendants conspired to violate § 1962(a),
(b), and (c). '[B]ecause the core of a RICO civil conspiracy is an agreement
to commit predicate acts, a RICO civil conspiracy complaint, at the very
least, must allege specifically such an agreement.' ... Plaintiffs specifically
alleged that the Defendants entered into an agreement and that each agreed
to commit at least two predicate acts of racketeering.
Summary
The passage from "Abraham v. Singh" provides a precedent for the
requirements to plead a RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) and (d). It
emphasizes the necessity of alleging a pattern of racketeering activity and a
conspiracy to commit predicate acts. This aligns with the proposition that
the plaintiff must demonstrate a coordinated scheme involving multiple
defendants to conduct the affairs of an enterprise through racketeering
activity. The case also highlights the importance of alleging an agreement
among defendants to commit predicate acts, which supports the
proposition's claim of a coordinated scheme.
Smoky Greenhaw Cotton Co., Inc. v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and
Smith, Inc., 785 F.2d 1274 (5th Cir. 1986)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
A violation of Sec. 1962(c), the section on which Sedima relies, requires (1)
conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity. The plaintiff must, of course, allege each of these elements to state
a claim. Conducting an enterprise that affects interstate commerce is
obviously not in itself a violation of Sec. 1962 nor is mere commission of the
predicate offenses. In addition, the plaintiff only has standing if, and can

=== PAGE 13 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
only recover to the extent that, he has been injured in his business or
property by the conduct constituting the violation.
Summary
The passage outlines the necessary elements to state a RICO claim under 18
U.S.C. § 1962(c), which includes conduct of an enterprise through a pattern
of racketeering activity. It also emphasizes the requirement for the plaintiff
to demonstrate injury to business or property as a result of the conduct. This
aligns with the proposition that the plaintiff's allegations, if proven, could
constitute a RICO claim by showing a coordinated scheme involving multiple
defendants.

Extract
RICO 'makes a private right of action available to '[a]ny person injured in his
business or property by reason of a violation' of RICO's substantive
restrictions, § 1964(c), provided that the alleged violation was the proximate
cause of the injury.' Anza v. Ideal Steel Supply Corp., 547 U.S. 451 (2006)
(citing Holmes v. Sec. Inv. Prot. Crop., 503 U.S. 258, 268 (1992)). ...
Racketeering activity means, inter alia, 'any act which is indictable under. ..
[18 U.S.C. §] 1341 (relating to mail fraud), section 1343 (relating to wire
fraud),. .. [and] section[] 2314 [] (relating to interstate transportation of
stolen property).' 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1)(B). ... To survive Defendants' Motion to
Dismiss, Plaintiffs must adequately plead a 'pattern of racketeering activity.'
See Abraham, 480 F.3d at 355 (citing Word of Faith, 90 F.3d at 122). To
adequately plead a RICO pattern, Plaintiffs must also show 'that the
predicate[] [acts] themselves amount to, or [] otherwise constitute a threat
of, continuing racketeering activity.' H.J. Inc. v. Northwest Bell Tel. Co., 492
U.S. 229, 240 (1989) (emphasis in original).
Summary
Requirements for a RICO claim, emphasizing the need for a pattern of
racketeering activity and the proximate cause of injury to business or
property. It also specifies the types of activities that qualify as racketeering,
such as mail and wire fraud, which are relevant to the plaintiff's allegations
of fraudulent court filings and misrepresentations. This supports the
proposition by aligning with the elements needed to establish a RICO claim,
as alleged by the plaintiff.

Extract
To prosecute a defendant under RICO, the government must prove that the
defendant: (i) through the commission of two or more acts constituting a
pattern of racketeering activity; (ii) directly or indirectly invested in,
maintained an interest in, or participated in, an enterprise; (iii) the activities
of which affected interstate or foreign commerce... For RICO to apply, the
alleged racketeering activity must affect interstate commerce... To sue for a
violation of [section] 1962(c), a plaintiff must have suffered an injury to
business or property caused... the Court established that plaintiff has a
claim under [section] 1964(c) if defendant engaged in pattern of
racketeering activity in a manner forbidden by [section] 1962 and such
activity injured plaintiff in his business or property.
Summary
Necessary elements to establish a RICO claim, including the requirement of
two or more predicate acts of racketeering, participation in an enterprise,
and an effect on interstate commerce. It also emphasizes the need for the
plaintiff to demonstrate injury to business or property caused by the
racketeering activity. These elements align with the proposition that the
plaintiff's allegations, if proven, could constitute a civil RICO claim under 18
U.S.C. § 1962(c).

Extract
In contrast, courts have recognized that, under [section] 1962(c), the RICO
person must be distinct from the alleged 'enterprise.' ... This suggests that
the 'person' and 'enterprise' alleged under [section] 1962(c) need only be
legally, not factually, distinct. ... For RICO to apply, the alleged racketeering
activity must affect interstate commerce. ... Many courts, however, now
exercise RICO jurisdiction if the predicate acts have even a de minimis
impact on interstate commerce, demonstrated by 'proof of a probable or
potential impact.' ... The effect on interstate commerce element may also be
satisfied by proof that the enterprise's activities have an impact on
interstate commerce, including activities that 'affect interstate commerce by
impacting the victim.' ... Moreover, a plaintiff must prove that the
defendant's violation of [section] 1962 was the proximate cause of the
plaintiff's injury to have standing for a civil RICO action. ... Recently,
however, the Court has relaxed this requirement for plaintiffs bringing RICO
claims predicated on mail and wire fraud. In Bridge v. Phoenix Bond &
Indemnity Co., the Supreme Court held that there is no requirement that

plaintiffs in such actions show, either as an element of their claim or as a
prerequisite to establishing proximate cause, that they relied on the
defendant's alleged misrepresentations.
Summary
Under RICO, the "person" and "enterprise" need only be legally distinct,
which supports the proposition that multiple defendants can form an
enterprise. It also highlights that even a minimal impact on interstate
commerce is sufficient for RICO jurisdiction, aligning with the plaintiff's
claim of interstate business activities. Furthermore, the passage discusses
the proximate cause requirement and the relaxed standard for mail and wire
fraud claims, which is relevant to the plaintiff's allegations of fraudulent
court filings and misrepresentations.

The first element of RICO requires two or more predicate acts of
'racketeering activity.'(28) RICO defendants need not be convicted of each
underlying offense before a civil or criminal RICO offense is charged.(29)
Under [sections] 1961(1), the term 'racketeering activity' includes a broad
assortment of state and federal crimes... The alleged racketeering activity
must affect interstate commerce.(163) Courts initially held that the
enterprise itself, and not the predicate acts, must affect interstate
commerce. (164) In contrast, many courts now exercise RICO jurisdiction if
the predicate acts have a de minimis impact on interstate commerce,(165)
demonstrated by 'proof of a probable or potential impact.'(166) Moreover,
the enterprise's activities may be held to impact interstate commerce
indirectly; that is, its activities 'may affect interstate commerce by impacting
the victim.'(167)
Summary
Requirements for establishing a RICO claim, including the need for two or
more predicate acts of racketeering activity and the effect on interstate
commerce. It highlights that the predicate acts themselves can have a de
minimis impact on interstate commerce, which aligns with the plaintiff's
allegations of wire fraud and mail fraud affecting interstate commerce. This
supports the proposition by confirming that the alleged activities, if proven,
could meet the RICO requirements.

Extract
In Bridge, the Supreme Court rejected the argument that a RICO plaintiff
alleging mail fraud must plead and prove that the plaintiff personally relied
on the defendant’s fraudulent statement or omission. The Court deemed it
irrelevant that reliance is an element of common-law fraud because
'Congress chose to make mail fraud, not common-law fraud, the predicate
act for a RICO violation.' Bridge, 553 U.S. at 653. The Bridge Court stressed
that 'a person can be injured ‘by reason of’ a pattern of mail fraud even if he
has not relied on any misrepresentations.' Id. at 649.

Summary
The Supreme Court in Bridge v. Phoenix Bond & Indemnity Co. clarified that
a RICO plaintiff does not need to prove personal reliance on fraudulent
statements to establish a RICO claim based on mail fraud. This supports the
proposition by indicating that the plaintiff's allegations of fraudulent court
filings and misrepresentations can form the basis of a RICO claim without
needing to show personal reliance, as long as the fraudulent acts caused
injury to the plaintiff's business or property.

Summary
The passage provides relevant information on the requirements for a RICO
claim, specifically the need for the alleged racketeering activity to affect
interstate commerce, which can be satisfied by even a minimal impact. It
also discusses the standing requirements, emphasizing that a plaintiff must
show a violation of RICO provisions, injury to business or property, and
causation. Additionally, the passage references the Bridge v. Phoenix Bond &
Indemnity Co. case, which supports the proposition by clarifying that
reliance on misrepresentations is not required for establishing proximate
cause in RICO claims predicated on mail and wire fraud.

Extract
RICO applies only to those injuries resulting from commission of predicate
acts constituting a “pattern of racketeering activity.”58 The statutory
definition of “pattern of racketeering activity” requires at least two
predicate acts occurring within ten years of each other.59 A “pattern of
racketeering activity” also requires evi-dence that the predicate acts are
continuous and interrelated, rather than isolated and sporadic.60 A plaintiff
can satisfy RICO’s pattern requirement two ways: by alleging a long-running
series of interrelated predicate acts constituting a closed-ended conspiracy;
or by alleging at least two interrelated predicate acts and the distinct threat
of continued racketeering activities, demonstrating an open-ended
conspiracy.61
Summary
To establish a RICO claim, a plaintiff must demonstrate a pattern of
racketeering activity, which involves at least two predicate acts that are
continuous and interrelated. This aligns with the proposition that the
plaintiff alleges a coordinated scheme involving multiple defendants, as the
timeline provided in the proposition outlines multiple predicate acts such as
wire fraud, mail fraud, and extortion, which are interrelated and continuous.

Extract
A violation of § 1962(c), the section on which Sedima relies, requires (1)
conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity. The plaintiff must allege each of the elements to state a claim. They
are all equally essential components, and the complaint will fail if any one of
them is not adequately pleaded. In particular, RICO claims based on mail or
wire fraud must comport with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b)’s
requirement that allegations involving fraud be pleaded with particularity.
Summary
The passage outlines the essential elements required to establish a civil
RICO claim under § 1962(c), which aligns with the proposition's assertion of
a coordinated scheme involving multiple defendants. The passage
emphasizes the need for particularity in pleading fraud, which is relevant to
the proposition's allegations of fraudulent court filings and
misrepresentations.
RICO: A Primer
Extract
Among other things, 'racketeering activities' include 'any act which is
indictable under' a list of federal criminal statutes. The list covers an
expansive range of violations, for example, violations of the Hobbs Act, 18
U.S.C. ' 1951 (extortion); 18 U.S.C. ' 1341 (mail fraud) and 1343 (wire fraud);
18 U.S.C. ' 1831 (economic espionage); 18 U.S.C. ' 1832 (theft of trade
secrets); 18 U.S.C. ' 1952 (Travel Act); 18 U.S.C. ' 1956, 1957 (money
laundering); and 18 U.S.C. ' 2318-2320 (copyright infringement). Mail and
wire fraud are the most common predicate acts. Notably, there must be
some nexus to interstate or foreign commerce-it is a jurisdictional element
of a civil RICO claim. Thus, predicate acts will often occur in several States.
Summary
Types of activities that qualify as racketeering under RICO, including mail
fraud, wire fraud, extortion, and violations of the Travel Act. These are
directly relevant to the plaintiff's allegations of fraudulent court filings,
misrepresentations, and manipulation of judicial processes. The passage
also emphasizes the necessity of a nexus to interstate or foreign commerce,
which aligns with the plaintiff's claim that the enterprise's activities affected
interstate commerce. This supports the proposition by confirming that the
alleged activities fall within the scope of RICO's definition of racketeering.

18 U.S.C. ' 1952 (Travel Act)... Mail and wire fraud are the most common
predicate acts. Notably, there must be some nexus to interstate or foreign
commerce-it is a jurisdictional element of a civil RICO claim. Thus, predicate
acts will often occur in several States... A plaintiff is required to demonstrate
that the defendant conducted the affairs of an enterprise though a pattern of
racketeering activity. The person and the enterprise generally must be
distinct; but, of course, a Rico person can be a part of an enterprise... The
racketeering acts need not be similar or directly related to each other;
rather, it is sufficient that the racketeering acts are related in some way to
the affairs of the charged enterprise, including, for example, that: the
racketeering acts furthered the goals of or benefitted the enterprise... A
plaintiff may demonstrate a pattern by establishment that the predicate acts
pose a threat of continued criminal activity, which is generally demonstrated
by showing either: Closed-ended continuity. Proving 'a series of related
predicate acts extending over a substantial period of time.' Open-ended
continuity. A threat of 'continuing criminal activity extending indefinitely
into the future,' in light of the nature of the enterprise and predicate acts
alleged.
Summary
Elements required to establish a RICO claim, including the need for
predicate acts such as mail and wire fraud, extortion, and violations of the
Travel Act, all of which are alleged in the plaintiff's case. It also emphasizes
the necessity of a nexus to interstate commerce, which is satisfied by the
plaintiff's business activities across multiple countries. The passage further
explains the concept of an enterprise and the requirement for a pattern of
racketeering activity, which can be demonstrated through closed-ended or
open-ended continuity. These elements align with the plaintiff's allegations
of a coordinated scheme involving multiple defendants to deprive him of
property and business interests.
