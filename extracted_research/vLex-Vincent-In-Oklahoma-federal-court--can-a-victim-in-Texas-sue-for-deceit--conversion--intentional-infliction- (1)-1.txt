Question
In Oklahoma federal court, can a victim in Texas sue for deceit, conversion,
intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED), and preparation of false
evidence under a personal injury (other) claim if the defendant allegedly
deceived the victim by inviting their spouse to his residence, assisted in
converting marital funds, and helped file fraudulent divorce paperwork?
Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
Based on the limited information provided, a victim in Texas could
potentially sue a defendant in Oklahoma federal court for the personal tort
claims described, provided diversity jurisdiction requirements ($75,000+ in
controversy between citizens of different states) are met and proper venue
is established.
Summary
A victim in Texas seeking to sue a defendant for deceit, conversion,
intentional infliction of emotional distress, and preparation of false evidence
in Oklahoma federal court must first establish that the court has subject
matter jurisdiction. The most likely basis would be diversity jurisdiction
under 28 U.S.C. § 1332, which requires complete diversity between the
parties (plaintiff from Texas, defendant presumably from Oklahoma) and an
amount in controversy exceeding $75,000.
Additionally, venue must be proper in the Oklahoma federal court under 28
U.S.C. § 1391, which would be satisfied if the defendant resides in Oklahoma
or if a substantial part of the events giving rise to the claims occurred there.
Assuming these jurisdictional and venue requirements are met, the federal
court would likely have authority to hear the various tort claims, although
the substance of those claims would be governed by the applicable state law,
which would need to be determined through a choice-of-law analysis not
covered in the provided materials.
Background and Relevant Law
Federal Court Jurisdiction
For a case to be heard in federal court, the court must have subject matter
jurisdiction. For the scenario described, where a Texas victim seeks to sue a
defendant (presumably from Oklahoma) for various personal injury torts, the
most relevant jurisdictional basis is diversity of citizenship under 28 U.S.C. §
1332.

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
According to 28 U.S.C. § 1332, "The district courts shall have original
jurisdiction of all civil actions where the matter in controversy exceeds the
sum or value of $75,000, exclusive of interest and costs, and is between-
citizens of different States." This provision establishes two key requirements
for diversity jurisdiction:
The amount in controversy must exceed $75,000, exclusive of interest
and costs.
The parties must be citizens of different states (complete diversity).
In this case, the plaintiff (victim) is from Texas, and the defendant appears to
be from Oklahoma (given the question's focus on Oklahoma federal court).
This suggests that the citizenship requirement for diversity jurisdiction
would likely be satisfied. However, the amount in controversy requirement
would need to be met as well. The victim would need to plausibly claim
damages exceeding $75,000 for their claims of deceit, conversion, IIED, and
preparation of false evidence.
Supplemental Jurisdiction
If the federal court has original jurisdiction over at least one claim (e.g., a
claim that independently satisfies the diversity jurisdiction requirements), it
may exercise supplemental jurisdiction over related claims that do not
independently meet jurisdictional requirements.
28 U.S.C. § 1367 provides that "in any civil action of which the district courts
have original jurisdiction, the district courts shall have supplemental
jurisdiction over all other claims that are so related to claims in the action
within such original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or
controversy under Article III of the United States Constitution."
This means that if at least one of the victim's claims (deceit, conversion,
IIED, or preparation of false evidence) establishes federal jurisdiction, the
court may hear the other related claims as well, even if they would not
independently satisfy jurisdictional requirements.
Venue
Even if a federal court has subject matter jurisdiction, the case must be filed
in a court with proper venue. Venue rules determine which federal district
court is the appropriate location for the lawsuit.
28 U.S.C. § 1391 establishes that a civil action may be brought in:
"a judicial district in which any defendant resides, if all defendants are
residents of the State in which the district is located;"
"a judicial district in which a substantial part of the events or omissions
giving rise to the claim occurred, or a substantial part of property that
is the subject of the action is situated;" or
"if there is no district in which an action may otherwise be brought as
provided in this section, any judicial district in which any defendant is
subject to the court's personal jurisdiction with respect to such action."

In this scenario, an Oklahoma federal court would be a proper venue if:
The defendant resides in Oklahoma, or
A substantial part of the events giving rise to the claims occurred in
Oklahoma.
Based on the facts provided, the defendant allegedly invited the victim's
spouse to his residence (presumably in Oklahoma), assisted in converting
marital funds, and helped file fraudulent divorce paperwork. If these
activities occurred in Oklahoma, they could constitute "a substantial part of
the events or omissions giving rise to the claim," making Oklahoma federal
court a proper venue under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2).
Analysis
Establishing Jurisdiction in Oklahoma Federal Court
For the Texas victim to sue in Oklahoma federal court, they must first
establish that the court has subject matter jurisdiction. Based on the limited
materials provided, diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1332 is the most
likely basis for jurisdiction.
To establish diversity jurisdiction, the victim would need to show:
Complete diversity exists between the parties. This appears to be
satisfied since the victim is from Texas and the defendant is presumably
from Oklahoma.
The amount in controversy exceeds $75,000. This would depend on the
specific damages the victim is claiming. In cases involving deceit,
conversion of marital funds, IIED, and preparation of false evidence in
the context of a divorce, the claimed damages could potentially exceed
this threshold, particularly if the converted marital funds were
substantial or if the victim suffered significant emotional distress
warranting damages.
If these requirements are met, the Oklahoma federal court would have
subject matter jurisdiction over the case based on diversity of citizenship.
Venue Analysis for Oklahoma Federal Court
Assuming jurisdiction exists, the next question is whether venue is proper in
the Oklahoma federal court. Under 28 U.S.C. § 1391, venue would be proper
in Oklahoma if:
The defendant resides in Oklahoma, which is likely given the scenario's
focus on Oklahoma federal court.

A substantial part of the events giving rise to the claims occurred in
Oklahoma. Based on the facts provided, several key events appear to
have occurred in Oklahoma:
The defendant invited the victim's spouse to his residence
(presumably in Oklahoma)
The defendant assisted in converting marital funds (possibly in
Oklahoma)
The defendant helped file fraudulent divorce paperwork (possibly
in Oklahoma)
If these activities occurred in Oklahoma, they would likely constitute "a
substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim," making
Oklahoma federal court a proper venue under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2).
Analysis of Specific Claims
The victim is seeking to bring claims for deceit, conversion, IIED, and
preparation of false evidence under a personal injury theory. While federal
courts have jurisdiction based on diversity of citizenship, they apply state
substantive law to the claims themselves. The available materials do not
provide information on which state's law would apply to these tort claims,
but courts typically conduct a choice-of-law analysis to determine this.
1. Deceit (Fraud)
Deceit or fraud generally involves a knowingly false representation made
with the intent to induce reliance, resulting in damages. The victim alleges
the defendant deceived them by inviting their spouse to his residence,
potentially as part of a scheme to interfere with the marriage. This could
potentially constitute deceit if all elements are established under the
applicable state law.
2. Conversion
Conversion involves the wrongful exercise of dominion and control over
another's property. The victim alleges the defendant assisted in converting
marital funds. If the defendant knowingly helped the spouse wrongfully take
or use marital funds that rightfully belonged (at least in part) to the victim,
this could potentially constitute conversion under the applicable state law.
3. Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (IIED)
IIED typically requires extreme and outrageous conduct that intentionally or
recklessly causes severe emotional distress. The victim would need to show
that the defendant's alleged conduct of deceiving the victim, assisting in
converting marital funds, and helping file fraudulent divorce paperwork was
extreme and outrageous and caused severe emotional distress. Whether this
meets the threshold for IIED would depend on the specific facts and the
applicable state law.

4. Preparation of False Evidence
The claim for "preparation of false evidence" is less common as a standalone
tort claim but could potentially be related to fraud or another tort depending
on the specific facts and applicable state law. The victim alleges the
defendant helped file fraudulent divorce paperwork, which could involve the
preparation of false evidence.
Supplemental Jurisdiction Considerations
If the federal court has original jurisdiction over one or more of the victim's
claims based on diversity, it may exercise supplemental jurisdiction over
related claims under 28 U.S.C. § 1367. This would allow the court to hear all
of the victim's claims in a single lawsuit, even if some claims would not
independently satisfy jurisdictional requirements.
In this case, the claims for deceit, conversion, IIED, and preparation of false
evidence all appear to arise from the same core set of facts involving the
defendant's alleged actions related to the victim's marriage and divorce. As
such, they would likely form part of the "same case or controversy" for
purposes of supplemental jurisdiction.
Potential Challenges and Limitations
Amount in Controversy Requirement
One potential challenge is establishing that the amount in controversy
exceeds $75,000. The victim would need to make a good faith claim for
damages exceeding this threshold. If the converted marital funds were
substantial or if the victim suffered significant emotional distress, this
threshold might be met, but it depends on the specific facts of the case.
Personal Jurisdiction
Although the provided materials do not directly address personal
jurisdiction, it's worth noting that the Oklahoma federal court would need to
have personal jurisdiction over the defendant. This is likely satisfied if the
defendant resides in Oklahoma, but could be more complicated if the
defendant is not an Oklahoma resident.
Choice of Law Issues
Federal courts sitting in diversity apply the choice-of-law rules of the state in
which they sit to determine which state's substantive law governs the
claims. The provided materials do not address which state's law would apply
to the victim's tort claims. This would be an important consideration, as the
elements and requirements for each tort claim could vary depending on
whether Oklahoma law, Texas law, or another state's law applies.

Domestic Relations Exception
Another potential limitation not addressed in the provided materials is the
"domestic relations exception" to federal jurisdiction, which generally
prevents federal courts from hearing cases involving divorce, alimony, and
child custody. While the victim's claims are tort claims rather than direct
domestic relations matters, the fact that they relate to a divorce could
potentially raise complications depending on the specific facts and the
extent to which the claims involve determinations typically reserved for
state family courts.
Exceptions and Caveats
Jurisdictional Exceptions
While the provided materials suggest that the Oklahoma federal court could
have jurisdiction based on diversity of citizenship, there are several
potential exceptions and caveats:
If the amount in controversy does not exceed $75,000, the court would
lack diversity jurisdiction unless another basis for federal jurisdiction
exists (not covered in the provided materials).
If the victim and defendant are not completely diverse (i.e., if both are
citizens of the same state), the court would lack diversity jurisdiction.
The scenario assumes the victim is from Texas and the defendant is
from Oklahoma, but this would need to be confirmed.
Venue Exceptions
Even if jurisdiction exists, venue might not be proper in Oklahoma federal
court if:
The defendant does not reside in Oklahoma, and
A substantial part of the events giving rise to the claims did not occur
in Oklahoma.
In such a case, the victim might need to file the lawsuit in a different federal
district where venue is proper.
Claim-Specific Limitations
The viability of each specific claim would depend on the applicable state law
and the specific facts of the case:
For deceit/fraud claims, many states require pleading with particularity,
meaning the victim would need to specify the who, what, when, where,
and how of the alleged fraud.
For conversion claims, the victim would need to establish a property
interest in the converted funds. If the funds were clearly separate

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
property of the spouse rather than marital property, this claim might be
more difficult to establish.
For IIED claims, courts typically set a high bar for what constitutes
"extreme and outrageous" conduct. Depending on the specific facts and
applicable law, the defendant's actions might not meet this threshold.
For the "preparation of false evidence" claim, the specific elements and
viability would depend heavily on the applicable state law and whether
it recognizes such a cause of action.
Conclusion
Based on the limited materials provided, a victim in Texas could potentially
sue a defendant in Oklahoma federal court for deceit, conversion, IIED, and
preparation of false evidence claims related to the defendant's alleged
involvement in deceiving the victim, inviting their spouse to his residence,
assisting in converting marital funds, and helping file fraudulent divorce
paperwork, provided that:
The requirements for diversity jurisdiction are met:
The victim (plaintiff) and defendant are citizens of different states.
The amount in controversy exceeds $75,000.
Venue is proper in Oklahoma federal court:
The defendant resides in Oklahoma, or
A substantial part of the events giving rise to the claims occurred
in Oklahoma.
The specific elements of each tort claim can be established under the
applicable state law, which would be determined through a choice-of-
law analysis.
While the provided materials suggest that jurisdiction and venue could
potentially be established in Oklahoma federal court, they do not address
the substantive requirements for each of the tort claims under the relevant
state law. The victim would need to ensure that their claims meet the
specific elements required by the applicable state law.
Furthermore, there may be practical considerations not addressed in the
provided materials, such as the domestic relations exception to federal
jurisdiction, that could affect the viability of these claims in federal court.
The victim may wish to consider whether state court might be a more
appropriate forum for claims that are closely related to domestic relations
matters.
In conclusion, while it appears theoretically possible for the victim to bring
these claims in Oklahoma federal court based on the jurisdictional and
venue provisions discussed, the ultimate success of the claims would depend
on factors not fully addressed in the provided materials, including the

specific elements of each tort under the applicable state law and potential
limitations on federal court jurisdiction over matters related to divorce and
family law.
Legal Authorities
28 U.S.C. § 1332 28 U.S.C. § 1332 Diversity of Citizenship; Amount In
Controversy; Costs
Extract
The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions where
the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of $75,000, exclusive of
interest and costs, and is between- citizens of different States;
Summary
For a federal court to have jurisdiction over a civil action based on diversity
of citizenship, the matter in controversy must exceed $75,000, and the
parties must be citizens of different states. This is relevant to the question
because it addresses the jurisdictional requirements for a federal court to
hear a case involving parties from different states, such as a victim in Texas
suing a defendant in Oklahoma.
28 U.S.C. § 1367 28 U.S.C. § 1367 Supplemental Jurisdiction
Extract
Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c) or as expressly provided
otherwise by Federal statute, in any civil action of which the district courts
have original jurisdiction, the district courts shall have supplemental
jurisdiction over all other claims that are so related to claims in the action
within such original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or
controversy under Article III of the United States Constitution. Such
supplemental jurisdiction shall include claims that involve the joinder or
intervention of additional parties.
Summary
Federal district courts can exercise supplemental jurisdiction over claims
that are related to the original jurisdiction claims, forming part of the same
case or controversy. This means that if the federal court has original
jurisdiction over a claim, it can also hear related claims, such as those for
deceit, conversion, IIED, and preparation of false evidence, if they are part
of the same case or controversy.

Extract
A civil action may be brought in- a judicial district in which any defendant
resides, if all defendants are residents of the State in which the district is
located; a judicial district in which a substantial part of the events or
omissions giving rise to the claim occurred, or a substantial part of property
that is the subject of the action is situated; or if there is no district in which
an action may otherwise be brought as provided in this section, any judicial
district in which any defendant is subject to the court's personal jurisdiction
with respect to such action.
Summary
The venue for a civil action in federal court can be determined by the
residence of the defendant, the location where a substantial part of the
events or omissions occurred, or where the property in question is situated.
This means that if the defendant resides in Oklahoma or if a substantial part
of the events related to the claim occurred in Oklahoma, the federal court in
Oklahoma could be a proper venue for the lawsuit.
