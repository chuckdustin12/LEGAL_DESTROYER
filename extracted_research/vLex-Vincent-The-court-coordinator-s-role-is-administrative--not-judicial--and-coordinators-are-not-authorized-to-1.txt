Question
The court coordinator’s role is administrative, not judicial, and coordinators
are not authorized to make legal determinations or exercise judicial
discretion. Texas law distinguishes between judicial acts (reserved for
judges) and ministerial/administrative acts (which may be performed by
staff), and prohibits delegation of judicial authority to non-judicial personnel
(see Tex. Gov’t Code § 21.002; see also In re Goodman, 210 S.W.3d 805, 808
(Tex. App.—Texarkana 2006, no pet.)). Requiring all briefs and proposed
orders to be presented exclusively to the court coordinator, especially in
light of alleged misconduct, blurs the line between administrative and
judicial functions and may constitute an improper delegation of judicial
authority.
Answer (Texas)
Short response
Texas law clearly distinguishes between judicial and administrative
functions, reserving judicial acts for judges and prohibiting their delegation
to non-judicial personnel such as court coordinators. Requiring all briefs and
proposed orders to be presented exclusively to a court coordinator risks
improper delegation of judicial authority and may violate the constitutional
separation of powers.
Summary
The Texas Constitution and case law firmly establish that judicial power—
including making legal determinations and exercising discretion—resides
solely with the courts and cannot be delegated to administrative staff. Court
coordinators are limited to ministerial and administrative tasks, and any
policy or practice that requires all substantive legal submissions to be
routed exclusively through them, especially where there are concerns about
misconduct, blurs the line between administrative and judicial functions and
may constitute an impermissible delegation of judicial authority.
This principle is reinforced by multiple appellate decisions interpreting the
Texas Constitution’s separation of powers provision, which prohibits non-
judicial personnel from exercising powers properly attached to the judiciary.
While court coordinators play a vital administrative role, the law does not
permit them to make or influence judicial decisions, and any process that
effectively places them in such a position is likely to be found unlawful.

Background and Relevant Law
Constitutional and Statutory Framework
The Texas Constitution, in Article V, Section 1, vests the judicial power of the
state exclusively in the courts. This provision is foundational and has been
consistently interpreted to mean that only judges may exercise core judicial
functions, such as hearing evidence, deciding questions of law and fact, and
entering and enforcing judgments. The separation of powers doctrine,
articulated in Article II, Section 1, further prohibits any branch of
government from exercising powers properly attached to another branch
unless expressly permitted by the Constitution.
Although the prompt references Texas Government Code § 21.002, the
provided sources do not include the text of this statute. However, the cited
case law and constitutional provisions are sufficient to analyze the issue.
Case Law
Several Texas appellate decisions directly address the non-delegability of
judicial power and the distinction between judicial and administrative acts:
In State v. Stephens, 608 S.W.3d 245 (Tex. App. 2020), the court
emphasized that the Texas Constitution creates three distinct branches
of government and prohibits the delegation of powers from one branch
to another unless expressly authorized. The court specifically held that
delegating prosecutorial authority to the Attorney General, a member
of the executive branch, to perform functions properly assigned to the
judiciary, violated the separation of powers. This case was later
superseded by a higher court decision (State v. Stephens, PD-1032-20,
PD-1033-20 (Tex. Crim. App. Dec 15, 2021)), which may affect its
precedential value, but its articulation of the separation of powers
principle remains instructive for the present analysis.
Glazer's Wholesale Distributors v. Heineken, 95 S.W.3d 286 (Tex. App.
2001) reaffirmed that the judicial power of the state is vested in the
courts and is non-delegable. The court described judicial power as the
authority to hear facts, decide issues of fact and law, enter judgments,
and enforce those judgments. The case involved a challenge to an
arbitration provision, but its reasoning applies broadly to any attempt
to delegate judicial functions to non-judicial actors.
Armadillo Bail Bonds v. State, 802 S.W.2d 237 (Tex. Crim. App. 1990)
similarly held that the core functions of the judiciary—hearing
evidence, deciding facts and law, and entering and executing judgments
—are reserved for judges and cannot be performed by non-judicial
personnel.
Parker v. State, 51 S.W.3d 719 (Tex. App. 2001) (supplementary) further
explained that the separation of powers is violated when one branch
assumes or is delegated a power properly attached to another, or when

one branch unduly interferes with another’s ability to exercise its
constitutionally assigned powers.
Analysis
Judicial vs. Administrative Functions
The distinction between judicial and administrative (or ministerial) acts is
central to the question. Judicial acts involve the exercise of discretion,
interpretation of law, and the making of binding decisions affecting the
rights of parties. Administrative acts, by contrast, are those that implement
or facilitate the judicial process without the exercise of discretion or legal
judgment.
The Texas courts have consistently held that only judges may perform
judicial acts. For example, in Glazer's Wholesale Distributors v. Heineken, 95
S.W.3d 286 (Tex. App. 2001), the court explained that the authority to decide
facts and law and to enter and enforce judgments is non-delegable and
reserved for the judiciary. Similarly, Armadillo Bail Bonds v. State, 802 S.W.
2d 237 (Tex. Crim. App. 1990) identified the core judicial functions as those
that cannot be performed by non-judicial personnel.
Court coordinators, as administrative staff, are authorized to perform
ministerial tasks such as scheduling hearings, managing dockets, and
facilitating communication between the court and parties. They are not
authorized to make legal determinations, exercise judicial discretion, or
decide substantive matters. Any policy or practice that requires all briefs
and proposed orders to be presented exclusively to a court coordinator,
especially if it results in the coordinator screening, prioritizing, or otherwise
influencing the court’s consideration of those materials, risks crossing the
line from administrative to judicial function.
Prohibition on Delegation of Judicial Authority
The prohibition on delegating judicial authority to non-judicial personnel is
rooted in the Texas Constitution’s separation of powers doctrine. As
articulated in State v. Stephens, 608 S.W.3d 245 (Tex. App. 2020), the
Constitution prohibits members of one branch from exercising powers
properly attached to another branch unless expressly authorized. Although
this case was later superseded by a higher court decision, its discussion of
the separation of powers remains relevant, as it reflects longstanding
constitutional principles.
The courts have applied this principle to a variety of contexts, including the
delegation of judicial functions to arbitrators (Glazer's Wholesale
Distributors v. Heineken, 95 S.W.3d 286 (Tex. App. 2001)) and the
performance of judicial acts by administrative staff (Armadillo Bail Bonds v.
State, 802 S.W.2d 237 (Tex. Crim. App. 1990)). In each case, the courts have
held that the core functions of the judiciary cannot be delegated to non-
judicial personnel.

Applying these principles to the scenario described, requiring all briefs and
proposed orders to be presented exclusively to a court coordinator—
particularly in the context of alleged misconduct—raises significant
concerns. If the coordinator is merely acting as a conduit, transmitting
materials to the judge without exercising any discretion or judgment, the
practice may be permissible. However, if the coordinator is screening,
prioritizing, or otherwise influencing the court’s consideration of those
materials, the practice likely constitutes an improper delegation of judicial
authority.
Risks of Blurring Administrative and Judicial Functions
The risk of blurring the line between administrative and judicial functions is
heightened where there are allegations of misconduct involving the court
coordinator. In such circumstances, requiring all substantive legal
submissions to be routed through the coordinator not only raises concerns
about the improper delegation of judicial authority but also about the
integrity and impartiality of the judicial process.
The courts have recognized that the separation of powers is violated not
only when one branch assumes powers properly attached to another but also
when one branch unduly interferes with another’s ability to exercise its
constitutionally assigned powers (Parker v. State, 51 S.W.3d 719 (Tex. App.
2001)). If the court coordinator’s involvement in the submission of briefs and
proposed orders interferes with the judge’s ability to exercise independent
judicial judgment, the practice is likely to be found unlawful.
Exceptions and Caveats
While the law is clear that judicial functions cannot be delegated to non-
judicial personnel, there may be limited circumstances in which
administrative staff are authorized to perform certain tasks that facilitate
the judicial process. For example, court coordinators may be authorized to
accept filings, schedule hearings, and communicate procedural information
to parties. However, these tasks must be strictly ministerial and must not
involve the exercise of discretion or legal judgment.
It is also important to note that the mere act of transmitting materials to the
judge does not, in itself, constitute the exercise of judicial authority. The key
question is whether the coordinator is making or influencing substantive
decisions that are reserved for the judge.
Finally, the subsequent treatment of State v. Stephens, 608 S.W.3d 245 (Tex.
App. 2020)—which was superseded by a higher court decision—means that
its specific holding may no longer be binding. However, its articulation of
the separation of powers principle is consistent with other authorities and
remains persuasive for the purposes of this analysis.

Conclusion
Texas law draws a clear distinction between judicial and administrative
functions, reserving the former exclusively for judges and prohibiting their
delegation to non-judicial personnel such as court coordinators. The courts
have consistently held that the core functions of the judiciary—making legal
determinations, exercising discretion, and entering and enforcing judgments
—are non-delegable and must be performed by judges. Any policy or
practice that requires all briefs and proposed orders to be presented
exclusively to a court coordinator, particularly in the context of alleged
misconduct, risks improper delegation of judicial authority and may violate
the constitutional separation of powers. The law permits court coordinators
to perform ministerial and administrative tasks, but not to make or influence
judicial decisions. The integrity of the judicial process requires that judges
retain exclusive authority over judicial acts, and any practice that
undermines this principle is likely to be found unlawful.
Legal Authorities
Westland Film Industries v. State Bd. of Ins., 697 S.W.2d 621 (Tex. App.
1985)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The Association's argument that the Board has been vested with this judicial
authority by implication is not valid. We may not imply that the use of the
word 'aggrieved' in Section 9 of the Act vests the Board with such judicial
authority. An administrative agency may not be vested with authority by
implication nor does it possess any inherent powers. Board of Insurance
Commissioners v. Guardian Life Insurance Co., 142 Tex. 630, 180 S.W.2d
906, 908 (1944). Even were this implication to be entertained, it would
constitute an illegal delegation of judicial power, because of the Act's lack of
any standards or criteria through which the power may be exercised.
Summary
The passage emphasizes that an administrative agency cannot be vested
with judicial authority by implication and that such delegation would be
illegal without clear standards or criteria. This aligns with the proposition
that court coordinators, as administrative personnel, should not exercise
judicial discretion or make legal determinations, as these are reserved for
judges. The passage supports the idea that judicial authority cannot be
delegated to non-judicial personnel without explicit legislative standards,
reinforcing the distinction between judicial and administrative roles.

Texas Civil Court of Appeals
Extract
The distinction between judicial and ministerial acts depends on whether a
discretion has been conferred... Where the law prescribes and defines the
duties to be performed with such precision and certainty as to leave nothing
to the exercise of discretion or judgment, the act is ministerial; but where
the act to be done involves the exercise of discretion or judgment, it is not to
be deemed merely ministerial.
Summary
The passage clearly delineates the difference between judicial and
ministerial acts, emphasizing that ministerial acts are those where duties
are prescribed with precision, leaving no room for discretion or judgment.
This supports the proposition that court coordinators, who perform
administrative tasks, should not engage in activities that require judicial
discretion, as these are reserved for judges.

Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Glazer&#39;s argues that section 102.77(b)&#39;s arbitration provision
impermissibly delegates the judicial power of the state in violation of article
five, section one of the Texas Constitution. See TEX. CONST. art. V, § 1. The
Texas Constitution vests the judicial power in the Texas Supreme Court, the
court of criminal appeals, courts of appeals, commissioners courts, justice
courts, and in &#34;such other courts as may be provided by law.&#34; Id.
The &#34;judicial power&#34; of the trial courts consists of the authority to
hear facts, decide issues of fact, decide questions of law, enter judgment in
accordance with the facts and the law, and enforce those judgments once
entered. ... This power is non-delegable. See Tabor, 955 S.W.2d at 896. The
issue we must decide is whether the arbitration provision of section
102.77(b) constitutes an unconstitutional delegation of judicial authority.
Summary
Impermissibility of delegating judicial authority to non-judicial entities,
which aligns with the proposition that court coordinators, as non-judicial
personnel, should not exercise judicial discretion or make legal
determinations.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Texas Court of Criminal Appeals
Extract
The Texas Constitution explicitly vests the judicial power of the state in the
courts. Tex. Const. art. 5, § 1. The core of this judicial power embraces the
power (1) to hear evidence; (2) to decide the issues of fact raised by the
pleadings; (3) to decide the relevant questions of law; (4) to enter a final
judgment on the facts and the law; and (5) to execute the final judgment or
sentence.
Summary
The judicial power of the state is vested in the courts, as per the Texas
Constitution. It outlines the core functions of this judicial power, which
include hearing evidence, deciding issues of fact and law, entering final
judgments, and executing those judgments. These functions are inherently
judicial and are reserved for judges. This supports the proposition that court
coordinators, who are not judges, should not perform these judicial
functions, as they are administrative personnel. The passage underscores
the separation of powers and the assignment of judicial functions exclusively
to the judiciary, thereby prohibiting the delegation of such authority to non-
judicial staff.
Parker v. State, 51 S.W.3d 719 (Tex. App. 2001)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The separation of powers provision of the Texas Constitution may be violated
in two ways: (1) when one branch of government assumes, or is delegated,
to whatever degree, a power that is more 'properly attached' to another
branch, and (2) when one branch unduly interferes with another branch
such that the other branch cannot effectively exercise its constitutionally
assigned powers. ... The Texas Constitution explicitly vests the judicial
power of the state in the courts.
Summary
The passage highlights the constitutional principle that judicial power is
explicitly vested in the courts, and any delegation of this power to another
branch or entity could violate the separation of powers. This supports the
proposition that court coordinators, as non-judicial personnel, should not
exercise judicial discretion or make legal determinations, as these are
powers reserved for judges.

Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Our Constitution creates three distinct departments of government—
legislative, executive, and judicial—and mandates that members of one shall
not exercise any power properly attached to the others, unless the
Constitution expressly provides for its exercise. TEX. CONST. art. II, § 1. ...
Interpreting this phrase to allow the Legislature to assign the Attorney
General the authority to prosecute criminal violations of the election laws
violates the constitutionally mandated separation of powers because it
delegates to him a power more properly assigned to the judicial department.
See TEX. CONST. art. V, § 21 ; Meshell, 739 S.W.2d at 254.
Summary
The passage emphasizes the constitutional separation of powers in Texas,
which prohibits members of one governmental department from exercising
powers properly attached to another department unless expressly permitted
by the Constitution. This principle is directly relevant to the proposition, as
it underscores that judicial powers, such as making legal determinations or
exercising judicial discretion, cannot be delegated to non-judicial personnel
like court coordinators. The passage supports the idea that such delegation
would violate the separation of powers, reinforcing the distinction between
judicial and administrative roles.
