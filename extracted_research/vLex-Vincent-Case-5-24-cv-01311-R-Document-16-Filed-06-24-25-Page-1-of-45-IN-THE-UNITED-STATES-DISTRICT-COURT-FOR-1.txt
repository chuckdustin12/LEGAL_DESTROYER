this litigation lies a deliberate and orchestrated scheme by Defendants

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Morgan Michelle Myers and Daniel Kenneth Branthoover, who strategically
chose to displace Plaintiff from his home and destabilize his financial and
familial security. Branthoover administered and Myers meticulously
executed a calculated plan involving interstate travel, fraudulent affidavits,
deliberate petjury, asset diversion, and systematic manipulation of multiple
Texas state courts to escape accountability for her actions. 12. To carry out
this scheme, Myers enlisted the assistance of Daniel Kenneth Branthoover, a
resident of Yukon Oklahoma, who has a prior history regarding violations of
protective orders and tampering with government documents. For no other
reason than to escape accountability for her affair, Myers spun an elaborate
web of lies and weaponized her family and court procedures designed to
help victims of abuse. 13. What emerges from the evidence is not a domestic
dispute gone awry, but a textbook criminal enterprise created within this
Court's Jurisdiction. This is the story of how a person corruptly influenced
the very courts designed to protect familiestransforming them into
instruments of fraud, extortion, and systematic theft. It is a tale of how two
individuals, connected by a common goal, orchestrated a seventeen-month
reign of terror that began in Oklahoma and was carried out in the Texas
courts. 14. The Defendants did not merely lie to courts-they constructed an
elaborate criminal enterprise with defined roles, coordinated operations,
and a singular mission: to strip Plaintiff of eve1ything he held dear through
the systematic corruption of judicial 4 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R Document 16
Filed 06/24/25 Page 5 of 45 proceedings. They engaged in laundering funds
across state lines while concurrently submitting fraudulent indigency claims.
They did not just fabricate allegations-they manufactured an entire false
narrative of domestic violence, complete with non-existent protective orders
and imaginary threats, all while the supposed "victim" continued to share a
bed with her alleged "abuser." 15. This case shows how the family court
system can be perverted by those willing to commit federal crimes to
achieve their goals. It reveals how easily the sacred trust placed in sworn
affidavits can be shattered by defendants who view perjury not as a crime,
but as a tool. Most importantly, it demonstrates that when domestic
relations become the vehicle for interstate racketeering, federal intervention
is not just appropriate-it is essential. 16. This is not a story about a marriage
that failed. This is simply the product of a litigant who values her
extramarital relationships over morality, and who chose to weaponize her
family against Plaintiff for the sole purpose of escaping accountability. 17.
After extensive research and vigorous advocacy, Plaintiff asserts that
Defendants engaged in racketeering activity through an organized
enterprise, seeking relief to prevent its finalization. Against all odds, and in
support of this preliminruy statement, Plaintiff alleges the following: 5 Case
5:24-cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 6 of 45 IV.
FACTUALALLEGATIONS A. Enterprise Formation and Initial Criminal
Coordination (December 14-15, 2023) 18. Defendant Branthoover possesses
extensive knowledge of protective order procedmes and requirements due to
his prior criminal convictions involving violations of such orders. This
knowledge would prove instrumental in the enterprise's systematic
manipulation of protective order proceedings. 19. On December 14, 2023,
immediately following Plaintiffs discovery of Defendant Myers' extramarital
affair, she initiated the criminal enterprise by taking two coordinated
actions: first, she opened a private bank account in her sole name to
facilitate asset concealment; and second, she commenced intensive

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
interstate communications with Defendant Branthoover via text messaging.
The scope and intensity of these communications-totaling 92 text messages
exchanged between Branthoover's registered number 940-312-3434 and
Myers' registered number 817-235-5189 on this single daydemonstrates the
deliberate and coordinated nature of their criminal planning. 20. While
coordinating with Branthoover, Defendant Myers tried to secure an exparte
protective order against Plaintiff, without legitimate cause. This action
marks the enterprise's first attempt to manipulate judicial proceedings
through false allegations. 21. Despite having just sought emergency
protection from Plaintiff hours earlier, Myers casually reminded him of their
child's school field trip scheduled for the following day, thereby creating a
facade of normalcy designed to conceal her fraudulent intentions and
prevent suspicion of the enterprise's activities. 6 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R
Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 7 of 45 B. Interstate Criminal
Coordination and Financial Crimes (December 15-16, 2023) 22. On
December 15, 2023, at precisely 9:51 A.M. CST, Defendant Branthoover
contacted Plaintiff directly, employing calculated deception by stating, "I've
been where you are before. I want to help both of you." This communication,
referencing Myers' December 1, 2023 divorce announcement, was designed
to establish false pretenses for Myers' planned interstate travel to Oklahoma
for criminal coordination purposes. 23. During this deceptive phone
conversation, Branthoover established the operational framework for the
next phase of the criminal scheme by atl'anging for Myers to visit his
Oklahoma residence over the weekend of December 15, 2023. The stated
purpose-"providing space" to Myers-was a deliberate misrepresentation
designed to conceal the true criminal purpose of coordinating fraudulent
document preparation and enterprise operations. 24. Having no reason to
suspect Branthoover's dishonest intentions, Plaintiff unwittingly facilitated
the enterprise's criminal coordination by agreeing to Myers' travel to
Oklahoma. 25. Immediately following Branthoover's deceptive phone call,
the enterprise executed its first major financial crime. Plaintiff received
notification that Myers had transfetl'ed $1,576 from the parties' joint marital
PNC account to Branthoover's Pay Pal account (usemame "dmb575"),
completely depleting the account balance. This interstate wire transfer
represents a critical predicate act, utilizing interstate commerce to further
the criminal scheme while simultaneously depriving Plaintiff of operating
funds necessary for his legitimate business operations, household bills, and
Christmas gifts. 7 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 8
of 45 26. The immediate and devastating impact of this financial crime
became apparent on December 16, 2023, when Plaintiff received notification
that the joint marital PNC account was overdrawn by $800.00. Concurrently,
Plaintiff discovered that advertisements for his legitimate home-based
business had ceased running due to payment failure directly caused by the
enterprise's theft of operating funds. This demonstrates the enterprise's
deliberate intent to cause maximum financial harm to Plaintiff. 27. The
criminal nature of this financial transaction is conclusively established by
documentary evidence. The PNC bank statement for December 2023
provides irrefutable proof of the unauthorized withdrawal, documenting the
precise date, amount, and destination of the :fraudulent transfer. 28. The
direct connection between Defendant Branthoover and this financial crime is
established through multiple forms of evidence. The PayPal identifier
"dmb575" appearing on Plaintiffs bank statement directly corresponds to

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Branthoover's Pay Pal account, creating an unbreakable evidentiary chain
linking him to the illicit financial transaction, c01Toborated by his own
admissions in subsequent text communications. 29. On December 16, 2023,
at precisely 3:54 P.M. CST, Plaintiff made a goodfaith attempt to resolve the
situation amicably by sending a detailed text message to Defendant
Branthoover. This communication explicitly requested the return of the
fraudulently transferred $1,576, detailed the intended legitimate use of
these funds, described the financial hardship caused by the theft (including
late bills and business disruption), explained Plaintiff's inability to work due
to the severe emotional distress 8 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed
06/24/25 Page 9 of 45 caused by Defendants' criminal actions, and
expressed his sincere desire for an amicable resolution during the holiday
season. 30. Defendant Branthoover's response to this reasonable request
revealed the true criminal nature of the enterprise. In a callous and
dismissive reply, Branthoover stated, "You Are Getting Divorced ... " followed
by, "I hope I can help with the paperwork and make things go as smoothly as
possible." Far from the helpful assistance initially promised, this
communication constituted a direct threat and overt act in furtherance of
the criminal conspiracy, demonstrating Branthoover's intent to exploit
Plaintiffs financial distress for the enterprise's benefit while utilizing
interstate communications to further the scheme. 31. This communication
also establishes Branthoover's unauthorized practice of law across state
lines. At no time relevant to this litigation has Defendant Branthoover
possessed a license to practice law in any jurisdiction within the United
States. His statements regarding "paperwork" and making legal proceedings
"go as smoothly as possible" constitute clear evidence of unauthorized legal
practice and demonstrate his administrative role in directing the
enterprise's criminal activities. C. Coordinated Eviction Attempt Fraud and
Interstate Document Transportation (December 17, 2023) 32. On December
17, 2023, at approximately 11 :00 A.M., Plaintiff was served with an eviction
notice by the grandmother of Myers, who is also the landlord of the
matrimonial residence, which contained the following false information: 1. A
purported "lease violation," which was entirely fabricated as no 9 Case 5:24-
cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 10 of 45 valid lease
agreement existed between Plaintiff and Wilson; 11. The assertion that
"Granddaughter getting divorced," referring to Defendant Myers, as a basis
for eviction; iii. The false claim that a "Protective order has been filed." 1v.
The directive that "He must leave. She and the girls may stay,"
demonstrating the clear intent to dispossess Plaintiff for the benefit ofMyers.
33. The coordinated and premeditated nature of this eviction fraud is
established by the timing of its execution. At the precise moment this
fraudulent notice was being served in Texas, Defendant Myers was
physically present in Oklahoma with Defendant Branthoover, actively
collaborating in the preparation of the very fraudulent court documents
referenced in the eviction notice. 34. Myers' knowledge of the fraudulent
nature of the eviction attempt is conclusively established. She possessed
actual knowledge that no valid lease agreement existed, and she had actual
knowledge that neither divorce proceedings nor protective orders had been
filed at the time of service, making her participation in the eviction fraud a
knowing and willful criminal act. 35. On December 17, 2023, Defendant
Myers completed the interstate transportation phase of the criminal scheme
by transporting the fraudulent court documents prepared in Oklahoma back

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
across state lines to Texas. These documents, including the Original Petition
for Divorce and Affidavit oflndigency, were specifically 10 Case 5:24-
cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 11 of 45 prepared with the
intent of submitting them to Texas state courts to further the enterprise's
fraudulent manipulation of judicial proceedings. 36. Upon her return to
Texas, Myers demonstrated her control over the eviction fraud by personally
destroying the fraudulent eviction notice. She physically tore the notice in
half and wrote "VOID" on it in black marker, providing clear evidence of her
influence over and coordination of the fraudulent eviction attempt
orchestrated during her absence in Oklahoma. D. Operational Security and
Document Preparation (December 17-18, 2023) 37. As part of the
enterprise's operational security measures, Defendant Myers returned from
Oklahoma equipped with a canister of pepper spray, designed to support the
false narrative of domestic violence that would be central to the fraudulent
comt documents prepared during her Oklahoma visit. 38. During her
Oklahoma visit, Defendant Myers acquired a secondary phone number
(817-940-0852) as a deliberate operational security measure. This
acquisition, which she explicitly disclosed to Plaintiff, constituted an overt
act in furtherance of the criminal enterprise, designed to facilitate
clandestine communications related to the fraudulent scheme while
concealing the enterprise's ongoing criminal coordination from detection.
39. This newly acquired secondary phone number became an integral
component of the fraudulent court documents prepared under Defendant
Branthoover's direct administrative oversight. The systematic use of this
number across multiple fraudulent legal documents demonstrates the
coordinated nature of the enterprise's document 11 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R
Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 12 of 45 preparation activities. These
documents, prepared in Oklahoma with the specific intent of unlawfully
influencing Texas legal proceedings, included: 1. An "Original Petition for
Divorce" dated December 18, 2023, containing numerous material false
statements designed to deceive the Texas courts; 11. An "Affidavit
oflndigency" dated December 18, 2023, containing deliberate
misrepresentations regarding Myers' financial status to defraud the court of
legitimate filing fees; iii. A "Request for Uncontested Cases" dated
December 18, 2023, fraudulently filed despite the complete absence of any
communication between the parties regarding divorce proceedings; 1v. An
"Application for Protective Order" dated December 22, 2023, containing
entirely fabricated allegations of family violence. E. Unauthorized Practice
of Law and Intimidation (December 18, 2023) 42. 40. Following the filing of
the initial fraudulent divorce documents on December 18, 2023, Defendant
Branthoover escalated his unauthorized practice of law by sending Plaintiff a
text message asserting legal representation and attempting to control all
future communications. The message stated: "Charlie, its come to my
understanding you have retained an attorney. I'm sure he has told you that
all further communication should take place between attorneys. I must
formally ask you refrain from discussing details of this case with my client
moving forward and only communicate with me or your attorney." 12 Case
5:24-cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 13 of 45 This
communication was a deliberate attempt to isolate Plaintiff from direct
communication with Myers and to control the flow of information, thereby
hindering Plaintiff's ability to uncover the full extent of the fraudulent
scheme. This communication also evidences that Branthoover's role went

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
beyond helping Myers prepare the documents by seeing them through to
their submission and asserting an administrative role over the proceedings
to intimidate Plaintiff. F. Service Through Official Channels and Continued
Deception (December 22-28, 2023) 41. In furtherance of the criminal
scheme, and despite continuing to cohabitate with Plaintiff in the marital
residence, Defendant Myers deliberately utilized official constable service to
effectuate service of the fraudulent divorce petition and protective order
application, which occurred on December 27, 2023. This calculated use of
official legal processes to serve fraudulent documents while maintaining the
deceptive facade of normalcy at home demonstrates the sophisticated and
deliberate nature of the enterprise's operations. 42. The enterprise's
manipulation of official legal processes continued when Myers, despite
residing next door to Plaintiff, deliberately influenced and coordinated the
constable service of the fraudulent eviction documents, which occurred on
December 28, 2023. This systematic abuse of official legal processes while
maintaining physical proximity and continued cohabitation reveals the
calculated and deceptive nature of the enterprise's operations. 13 Case 5:24-
cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 14 of 45 G. Systematic False
Statements in Sworn Court Documents (December 18, 2023) 43. When
reviewing the documents prepared in part by Branthoover and filed with the
court by Myers, there existed several false statements and were intended to
deceive the court and prejudice Plaintiff in furtherance of the scheme to
dispose him of his property interests. Specifically, these false statements
included, but were not limited to: 1. The assertion that the spouses had
ceased living together on December 1, 2023, when in fact they were still
residing together at the marital home on that date and for several weeks
thereafter. 11. The claim that Defendant Myers owned both family vehicles
as her separate property prior to the marriage, which was demonstrably
false as these vehicles were acquired during the marriage and constituted
community property, paid for by Plaintiff. m. The representation that
Defendant Myers had an active order of protection against Plaintiff with a
judicial finding that family violence had occurred during the marriage, which
was fabricated and without any basis in fact or law. 1v. The assertion that
the children or Defendant Myers would be subjected to harassment or abuse
if Plaintiff were provided with her second phone number (817-940-0852)
acquired in Oklahoma, which was a baseless and manipulative claim
designed to conceal her communications related to the fraudulent scheme.
14 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 15 of 45 44.
Concurrently with the fraudulent divorce petition, Defendant Myers, again
with the administrative oversight and full knowledge of Defendant
Branthoover, filed a fraudulent "Affidavit of Indigency" with the court. This
affidavit contained material misrepresentations regarding Defendant Myers'
fmancial status, all of which were known to be false at the time of filing and
were intended to defraud the court and avoid legitimate court costs.
Specifically, these false statements included: 1. The claim that Defendant
Myers was financially indigent and unable to pay comi costs, despite her
access to and control over substantial marital assets. 11. The representation
that Defendant Myers was solely responsible for all family living expenses,
including rent, utilities, food, and other living expenses, when in fact,
Plaintiff was the primary breadwinner of the household at that time. 111.
The asse1tion that Defendant Myers was solely responsible for both car
payments, which she has no payment history to suppmi such a claim. H.

Escalation Through Fabricated Violence Allegations (December 22, 2023)
45. On December 22, 2023, despite having claimed in her divorce petition to
already possess an active protective order, Myers filed an "Application for
Protective Order," revealing the contradictory and fabricated nature of her
previous representations while escalating the enterprise's fraudulent
manipulation of judicial proceedings. 15 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R Document 16
Filed 06/24/25 Page 16 of 45 46. Upon review, defendant Myers made
additional false statements within the sworn document, all intended to
further deceive the court and secure an unwarranted protective order
against Plaintiff to effectuate the enterprises' goal of divesting him of his
property interests. These false statements included, but were not limited to:
i. The claim that family violence occurred on December 18, 2023, in the
presence of the children, which was entirely false and fabricated. 11. The
assertion that family violence occurred prior to December 18, 2023, which
was also false and without any factual basis. 111. The request that Plaintiff
take a battering intervention program. I. Achievement of Primary Criminal
Objective (January 16, 2024) 47. On January 16, 2024, the enterprise's
criminal scheme achieved its primary objective when Plaintiff appeared
before the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County and was ordered to vacate
the family residence. Significantly, this order was entered without any
evidentiary hearing and without judicial findings regarding the allegations
contained in the fraudulent documents, demonstrating that the court's
decision was based entirely on the false information systematically
presented by the Defendants. 48. The causal relationship between the
Defendant's fraudulent representations and this judicial outcome is
conclusively established. The misinformation presented to the court through
the coordinated fraudulent documents was the sole basis for the comt's
decision, providing Myers with the exact advantage that she and
Branthoover had anticipated and planned through significant and intentional
misrepresentations. 16 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed 06/24/25
Page 17 of 45 J. Ongoing Pattern of Racketeering Activity and Continuity
( January 2024 - Present) 49. Between January 16, 2024, and the present
day, Defendants Myers and Branthoover have continued to further their
racketeering activity through a series of ongoing illicit acts, demonstrating a
clear pattern of continuity and relatedness. These acts include, but are not
limited to: 1. Myers and Branthoover continuing to engage in interstate
communications regarding case details between one another across state
lines, specifically between Texas and Oklahoma, in direct fwtherance of
their :fraudulent scheme to see the divorce through to its finalization. 11.
Branthoover delivering ongoing threats and intimidation to Plaintiff
regarding his legitimate attempts to seek legal relief from the orders that
were a product of the Defendants' actions, which occurred in December of
2023, June of 2024, December of 2024, and May of 2025. 111. Making direct
statements such as "I've been enjoying watching every filing get denied" by
Branthoover, showing the malicious intent behind his involvement as
Plaintiff sought relief for their coordinated actions. 50. On June 23, 2024,
Defendant Branthoover continued his pattern of harassment and
intimidation by sending Plaintiff a text message stating, "Loi. And here
comes 17 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 18 of 45
another denial," in direct reference to Plaintiffs court filing seeking to enjoin
Branthoover as a party to the divorce proceedings. This communication
provides conclusive evidence of Branthoover's continued awareness of and

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
active involvement in the Texas legal proceedings, his ongoing monitoring of
court filings, and his malicious intent to mock and intimidate Plaintiff's
efforts to seek justice through legitimate legal channels. 51. On December
12, 2024, Branthoover escalated his threatening communications by sending
Plaintiff a message stating, "When things all over you get to deal with me.
Just a heads up," demonstrating the enterprise's ongoing criminal intent and
explicit threats of future retaliation against Plaintiff for his efforts to expose
and seek relief from their criminal activities. 52. Most recently, on May 24,
2025, Branthoover sent Plaintiff a message stating, "Where's my lawsuit?
Heard your vm about me. File it. Let's do this:)" This communication
demonstrates the enterprise's continued operation, Branthoover's ongoing
monitoring of Plaintiffs activities, and his explicit challenge and threat
regarding potential legal action, providing clear evidence of the enterprise's
ongoing criminal intent and the continuing threat posed to Plaintiff. 53. As a
direct result of the actions outlined above, Plaintiff has sustained substantial
injury to his business and property. 54. Plaintiff now turns to discuss the
elements of RICO and the alleged predicate acts committed by the
Defendants in this matter. 18 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed
06/24/25 Page 19 of 45 V. INTRODUCTION TO RICO 55. Plaintiff realleges
and incorporates by reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1
through 54 above, as if fully set forth herein. 56. The Racketeer Influenced
and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) requires proof of a "pattern of
racketeering activity," which the Supreme Court has consistently held
consists of two essential elements: relatedness and continuity of predicate
acts. Based on the provided facts and the applicable law, the Defendants'
series of related acts spanning from December 2023 through May 2025
(approximately 18 months) satisfies both the relatedness requirement ( as
the acts share similar purposes, participants, and methods) and the
continuity requirement (as they extend over a substantial period of time)
necessary to establish a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO as
explained in more detail below. 57. For there to be a pattern of racketeering
activity, there must be conduct committed by an enterprise that is prohibited
under 18 U.S.C. § 1961. In the instant matter, Defendants are alleged to
have committed several predicate acts, including wire fraud, violations of
the Travel Act, and perjury/subordination of perjury to support a pattern of
racketeering activity, as explained in more detail below. VI. PREDICATE ACT
- WIRE FRAUD (18 U.S.C. § 1343) 58. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by
reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 57 above, as if
fully set forth herein. 59. The relevant federal statutes in this analysis are 18
U.S.C. § 1343 (Wire Fraud) and 18 U.S.C. § 1961 (RICO Definitions). 19 Case
5:24-cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 20 of 45 60. Title 18
U.S.C. § 1343 states: "Whoever, having devised or intending to devise any
scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means
of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, transmits or
causes to be transmitted by means of wire, radio, or television
communication in interstate or foreign commerce, any writings, signs,
signals, pictures, or sounds for the purpose of executing such scheme or
artifice, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years,
or both." 61. The facts above establish all three elements of wire fraud
under 18 U.S.C. § 1343-a scheme to defraud, use of interstate wire
communications, and intent to deprive another of money or property-
qualifying it as a RICO predicate act under 18 U.S.C. § 1961. A. Scheme to

=== PAGE 9 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Defraud 62. The first element of wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343 is the
existence of "a scheme to defraud." As noted in United States v. Greenberg,
835 F.3d 295 (2nd Cir. 2016), this constitutes an "essential element" of the
crime. In the present case, Myers transferred $1,576 from a joint marital
PNC account to Branthoover's PayPal account, depleting the account
entirely. This transfer was not an isolated action but was accompanied by "a
series of coordinated text messages and phone calls" between Myers and
Branthoover regarding the scheme, and followed after a deceptive message
was sent from Branthoover to Plaintiff. 63. The coordination between the
parties through multiple communications channels demonstrates a
deliberate plan rather than a spontaneous or inadvertent action. As
a1ticulated in Mail and Wire Fraud, a "scheme to defraud requires a
material falsehood, material misrepresentation, or the concealment of a
material fact." By 20 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed 06/24/25
Page 21 of 45 transferring funds from a joint marital account without
apparent authorization from the joint account holder, Myers engaged in
conduct that reflects the concealment of material facts regarding the
disposition of marital assets. 64. The scheme in this case specifically
targeted marital funds, and community property, which are legally
considered shared property between spouses. By depleting the account,
Myers intentionally deprived the Plaintiff of access to funds to which he was
legally entitled. This satisfies the requirement that the scheme have "money
or property as the object of the scheme" as stated in Smulley v. Fed Haus.
Fin. Agency, 17-2666 (2nd Cir. Oct 05, 2018). B. Use of Interstate Wire
Communications 65. The second element of wire fraud requires the "use of
the mails or wires to further the scheme." United States v. Greenberg, 835 F.
3d 295 (2nd Cir. 2016). The facts demonstrate that Myers used interstate
wire communications in two distinct ways: 1. The transfer of $1,576 was
"executed via interstate wire (bank to Pay Pal)," which constitutes an
electronic transmission across state lines. 11. The transfer "was
accompanied by a series of coordinated text messages and phone calls
between Myers (in Texas) and Branthoover (in Oklahoma) regarding the
scheme." 66. Wire transmissions include interstate telephone calls or
electronic transmissions. Furthermore, internet communications satisfy the
interstate nexus 21 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page
22 of 45 requirement, even in the absence of proof that a fraudulent
communication traveled through out-of-state servers. 67. The interstate
nature of these communications is established by the fact that Myers was in
Texas while Branthoover was in Oklahoma during their communications
about the scheme. This satisfies the jurisdictional requirement that the wire
communication cross state lines. C. Intend to Defraud 68. The third element
requires that the defendant acted "with the intent to defraud." As stated in
US. v. Blackmon, 839 F.2d 900 (2nd Cir. 1988), the wire fraud statute
requires that the defendant "be a party to some kind of scheme to defraud, a
requirement that includes a high degree of scienter and moral culpability."
69. Here, Branthoover specifically stated that he wanted to help Plaintiff,
which he knew was not a true statement at the time. The fact that text and
phone communications were used to deceive Plaintiff into believing that
Myers' interstate travel would be beneficial for him further supports a
scheme to defraud, because the transfer of funds occmTed after this false
extension of help from Branthoover. 70. In summary, the facts presented
establish all required elements of wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343,

=== PAGE 10 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
qualifying it as a predicate act for RICO purposes under 18 U.S.C. § 1961,
committed by both Defendants. D. Potential Defenses 71. One potential
defense might be that Myers, as a joint account holder, had legal authority
to transfer funds from the account. However, this authority does not extend
to 22 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 23 of 45
depleting the account for personal gain in coordination with a third party
with the intent to deprive the other account holder of their rightful access to
the funds. The joint nature of the account creates a fiduciary duty to act in
good faith regarding the shared asset. That fiduciary duty was willingly
violated when Myers chose to transfer the funds to Branthoover's Pay Pal,
and then later to herself. The appropriate method would have been for
Myers to transfer the funds directly to herself, but she avoided this to
conceal her bank account information in furtherance of a broader scheme.
72. This argument fails because the proceeds from the transfer were used to
acquire a second phone in furtherance of the broader scheme. VII.
PREDICATE ACT-VIOLATION OF THE TRAVEL ACT (18 U.S.C. § 1952) 73.
Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations contained in
paragraphs 1 through 72 above, as if fully set forth herein. 74. The Travel
Act, codified at 18 U.S.C. § 1952, criminalizes interstate travel or the use of
interstate facilities with the intent to promote, manage, establish, carry on,
or facilitate unlawful activity, followed by the performance or attempted
performance of such acts. According to 18 U.S.C. § 1952: "Whoever travels
in interstate or foreign commerce or uses the mail or any facility in
interstate or foreign commerce, with intent to- ... otherwise promote,
manage, establish, carry on, or facilitate the promotion, management,
establishment, or can-ying on, of any unlawful activity, and thereafter
performs or attempts to perform- ... an act described in paragraph or shall
be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both ... " 75.
The statute has three essential elements: 1. Interstate travel or use of
interstate facilities 23 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed 06/24/25
Page 24 of 45 ii. Intent to promote, manage, establish, carry on, or facilitate
unlawful activity iii. Subsequent performance or attempted performance of
acts in fmtherance of the unlawful activity 76. For a Travel Act violation to
serve as a RICO predicate act, it must be "indictable" under 18 U.S.C. §
1952. Myers' conduct, as analyzed above, satisfies all elements of a Travel
Act violation: 1. Myers engaged in interstate travel between Texas and
Oklahoma. 11. Myers traveled with the specific intent to coordinate the
preparation of fraudulent court documents and execute a criminal scheme.
Under United States v. Compton, 355 F.2d 872 (6th Cir. 1966), this intent
can be inferred from "evidence of a substantial course of illegal conduct,
occurring a reasonable time before and after an act of interstate travel." The
preparation of fraudulent court documents falls within the definition of
"unlawful activity" under the Travel Act, as it involves fraud, which is
indictable under state law. iii. After the interstate travel, Myers engaged in
overt acts to fu1ther the unlawful activity by preparing fraudulent legal
documents and coordinating the fraudulent scheme. As U.S. v. Admon, 940 F.
2d 1121 (8th Cir. 1991) clarified, the conduct after travel need not itself be
unlawful but must further the unlawful activity. The preparation and use of
fraudulent documents clearly meet this requirement. 24 Case 5:24-cv-01311-
R Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 25 of 45 77. Given that Myers' conduct
satisfies all elements of a Travel Act violation, this violation qualifies as an
"indictable" offense under 18 U.S.C. § 1952. As such, it constitutes a valid

=== PAGE 11 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
predicate act for RICO purposes under 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1). 78. The Supreme
Court's explanation in Perrin v. United States, 444 U.S. 37 ( 1979) that the
Travel Act was intended to provide "a second layer of enforcement" for
interstate criminal activity underscores the significance of federalizing
crimes that cross state lines. Myers' conduct, involving interstate travel for
the purpose of engaging in fraudulent activities, is precisely the type of
behavior that the Travel Act was designed to address. VIII. PATTERN OF
RACKETEERING ACTIVITY 79. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by
reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 78 above, as if
fully set forth herein. 80. A "pattern of racketeering activity" requires at
least two acts of "racketeering activity" occun'ing within a ten-year period.
18 U.S.C. § 1961 (2025) ('"pattern of racketeering activity' requires at least
two acts of racketeering activity, one of which occwTed after the effective
date of this chapter and the last of which occurred within ten years
( excluding any period of imprisonment) after the commission of a prior act
of racketeering activity"). 81. However, the mere existence of two predicate
acts is not automatically sufficient to establish a pattern. As explained in
Bonton v. Archer Chrysler Plymouth, Inc., 889 F.Supp. 995 (S.D. Tex. 1995):
25 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 26 of 45
"Although at least two acts of racketeering are necessary to constitute a
pattern, two acts may not be sufficient. Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., 473
U.S. 479,496 n. 14, 105 S.Ct. 3275, 3285 n. 14, 87 L.Ed.2d 346 (1985).
RICO's legislative history leaves no doubt that 'there is something to a RICO
pattern beyond simply the number of predicate acts involved."' 82. Instead,
courts have established that to prove a pattern, the predicate acts must be
both related and continuous. Bustos v. Invierte En Tex. , 4:22-CV-02690 (S.D.
Tex. Jun 03, 2024) ("To rise to the level of 'racketeering activity' there must
be two or more predicate acts that are: (1) related; and (2) amount to or
pose a threat of continued criminal activity."). A. Establishing a Pattern of
Racketeering Activity 83. The factual allegations identify several instances
that constitute wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343 and violations of the Travel
Act under 18 U.S.C. § 1952: 1. The extensive text message communications
(92 exchanges) on December 14, 2023, between Myers and Branthoover
using interstate wire facilities to coordinate their scheme. 11. Branthoover's
deceptive phone call to Plaintiff on December 15, 2023, where he falsely
stated, "I've been where you are before. I want to help both of you," to
facilitate Myers' interstate travel to Oklahoma. 111. The interstate wire
transfer of $1,576 from the joint marital account to Branthoover's PayPal
account, which was executed to deprive Plaintiff of funds. 26 Case 5:24-
cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 27 of 45 iv. Branthoover's text
messages to Plaintiff on December 16, 2023, refusing to return the
transferred funds and offering to "help with the paperwork." v.
Branthoover's text message on December 18, 2023, falsely claiming to be a
legal representative. v1. The ongoing interstate communications between
Myers and Branthoover to further their fraudulent scheme, continuing
through May 2025. 84. The factual allegations also demonstrate potential
Travel Act violations: 1. Myers' interstate travel from Texas to Oklahoma on
December 15, 2023, with the intent to prepare fraudulent court documents.
11. The interstate transportation of fraudulent documents from Oklahoma
back to Texas on December 17, 2023, intended for filing in Texas courts. iii.
The use of interstate facilities (phone calls, text messages) to coordinate and
further the fraudulent scheme. B. Relatedness of Predicate Acts 85. The

=== PAGE 12 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
predicate acts of wire fraud and Travel Act violations are clearly related,
meeting the standard outlined in Bonton v. Archer Chrysler Plymouth, Inc.,
889 F.Supp. 995 (S.D. Tex. 1995). They share: 27 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R
Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 28 of 45 i. Common Purpose: All acts were
directed toward depriving Plaintiff of his property rights and manipulating
judicial proceedings to benefit Myers in divorce proceedings. 11. Same
Participants: Myers and Branthoover were the consistent actors in all
predicate acts. 111. Same Victim: All acts targeted Plaintiff, causing him
financial harm and depriving him of legal rights. 1v. Similar Methods: The
acts consistently involved deception, misrepresentation, and the
manipulation of legal processes. v. Temporal Connection: The acts occurred
in a logical sequence, beginning on December 14, 2023, and continuing
through May 2025. C. Continuity of Racketeering Activity 86. The pattern of
racketeering activity demonstrates both closed-ended and openended
continuity: 1. Closed-ended Continuity: The scheme extends over a
substantial period- from December 2023 through May 2025, over eighteen
months. This satisfies the requirement for "a series of related predicate acts
extending over a substantial period of time" as described in RICO: A Primer
(2022). 2 2 https://freemanlaw.com/rico-a-primer/ 28 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R
Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 29 of 45 11. Open-ended Continuity: The
scheme also poses a threat of continued criminal activity. Branthoover's
message on May 24, 2025, demonstrating continued monitoring of Plaintiffs
activities and threatening future retaliation, indicates that the racketeering
activity could continue indefinitely given that they are unable to finalize the
divorce. This satisfies the alternative requirement for "a threat of continuing
criminal activity extending indefinitely into the future" noted in RICO: A
Primer (2022). D. Role of Perjury and Subornation of Perjury 87. While
perjury and subornation of perjury in state court proceedings are not
themselves listed as predicate acts under RICO, they form an integral part of
the overall criminal scheme and help establish the pattern of racketeering
activity when considered alongside the actual predicate acts of wire fraud
and Travel Act violations. 88. As explained in RICO: A Primer (2022),
racketeering acts need not be similar or directly related to each other; they
must simply be "related in some way to the affairs of the charged
enterprise." The perjury and subornation of perjury evident in the fraudulent
court filings- including the false statements in the divorce petition, the
Affidavit oflndigency, and the Application for Protective Order-are directly
related to the predicate acts of wire fraud and Travel Act violations. They
share the same purpose, involve the same participants, target the same
victim, and form part of the same overall scheme. For example: 29 Case
5:24-cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 30 of 45 1. The
fraudulent court documents were prepared during Myers' interstate travel
to Oklahoma, connecting the perjury to the Travel Act violation. 11. The
false statements in these documents were discussed and planned via
interstate wire communications, connecting the perjury to the wire fraud.
111. The deceptive interstate wire transfer of funds was executed to support
Myers during the divorce proceedings initiated through fraudulent filings. iv.
The perjerous statements were influenced by Branthoover, connecting
subordination of perjury to the predicate acts. 89. These connections
demonstrate how the non-predicate acts of perjury committed by Myers and
subornation of perjury alleged against Branthoover, while not sufficient
alone to establish a RICO violation, contribute to the overall pattern of

=== PAGE 13 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
racketeering activity when combined with the predicate acts of wire fraud
and Travel Act violations alleged by the Defendants. IX. ESTABLISHING AN
ASSOCIATE-IN-FACT ENTERPRISE 90. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates
by reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 89 above, as
if fully set forth herein. 30 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed
06/24/25 Page 31 of 45 A. Formation of the Enterprise 91. The factual
allegations demonstrate the formation of an associate-in-fact enterprise
between Myers and Branthoover that satisfies the definition in 18 U.S.C. §
1961 (2025). i. Myers and Branthoover associated for the common purpose
of depriving Plaintiff of his property rights through the manipulation of legal
proceedings. This shared objective is evident from their coordinated actions
beginning on December 14, 2023, immediately following Plaintiffs discovery
of Myers' affair. ii. Though informal, the enterprise had a clear
organizational structure as 1) Myers acted as the "inside" operative, with
direct access to marital assets and the ability to file fraudulent court
documents in Texas. 2) Branthoover served as the "outside" operative,
providing administrative oversight, expertise on protective orders due to his
prior criminal history (Paragraph 18), and a base of operations in Oklahoma.
3) Their respective roles complemented each other and demonstrated an
organized approach to their criminal scheme. iii. The enterprise functioned
as a continuing unit from December 2023 through May 2025, with
consistent roles and coordinated actions throughout this period. 31 Case
5:24-cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 32 of 45 B. Maintenance
of the Enterprise 92. The enterprise was maintained through several key
mechanisms: 1. Continuous Communication: Myers and Branthoover
maintained regular interstate communications throughout the scheme,
beginning with the 92 text messages on December 14, 2023, and continuing
through May 2025. 11. Financial Support: The interstate wire transfer of
$1,576 from the joint marital account to Branthoover's Pay Pal account
provided financial resources to support the enterprise's activities. 111.
Operational Security Measures: The enterprise implemented specific
measures to protect its operations: 1) Myers acquired a secondary phone
number during her Oklahoma visit (Paragraph 38). 1v. Myers returned with
pepper spray to support the false domestic violence narrative (Paragraph
37). v. Branthoover attempted to control communications by falsely claiming
legal representation (Paragraph 40). v1. Geographic Distribution: The
enterprise maintained operations across state lines, with activities in both
Texas and Oklahoma, enhancing its ability to avoid detection and complicate
legal responses. 32 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page
33 of 45 C. Enterprise Distinct from Racketeering Activity 93. As Allstate
Ins. Co. v. Donovan, CIVIL ACTION NO. H-12-0432 (S.D. Tex. Jul 03, 2012)
reiterates, a RICO enterprise must be an entity 'separate and apart from the
alleged pattern of racketeering'-not merely a conduit for the predicate acts
themselves. The nature and duration of the Myers-Branthoover operation
exhibits all three required elements: a separate organizational purpose,
defined roles within an enduring structure, and coordinated decision-making
extending beyond the January 16, 2024 initial outcome, with the finalization
of the scheme still pending. X. CLAIMS FOR RELIEF COUNT 1: VIOLATION
OF 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) Against All Defendants 94. Plaintiff realleges and
incorporates by reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through
93 above, as if fully set forth herein. 95. At all relevant times, Plaintiff was a
person within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961(3) and 1964(c). 96. At all

=== PAGE 14 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
relevant times, each Defendant was a person within the meaning of 18
U.S.C. §§ 1961(3) and 1962(c). 97. As set forth above, Defendants Myers and
Branthoover formed an associationin- fact enterprise within the meaning of
18 U.S.C. § 1961(4) (the "Enterprise"). The Enterprise was engaged in, and
its activities affected, interstate commerce. 98. The Enterprise had an
ascertainable structure separate and apart from the pattern of racketeering
activity in which the Defendants engaged. The Enterprise 33 Case 5:24-
cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 34 of 45 maintained an
existence beyond that which was necessary to commit the predicate acts
constituting the pattern of racketeering activity. 99. In furtherance of the
fraudulent scheme, each Defendant conducted or participated, directly or
indirectly, in the conduct of the Enterprise's affairs through a pattern of
racketeering activity within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961(1), 1961(5),
and 1962(c). 100. As detailed above, the Defendants committed multiple
related acts of wire fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1343 and Travel Act
violations under 18 U.S.C. § 1952, and further committed acts of perjury and
subordinated perjury in furtherance of the scheme, constituting a pattern of
racketeering activity as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5). 101. The predicate
acts committed by the Defendants were related to each other in that they
had the same or similar purposes (to defraud Plaintiff of his property
interests and manipulate judicial proceedings), involved the same
participants (Defendants Myers and Branthoover), targeted the same victim
(Plaintiff), employed similar methods ( deception, misrepresentation, and
manipulation of legal processes), and were not isolated events. 102. The
predicate acts committed by the Defendants demonstrate both closedended
continuity, spanning over eighteen months from December 2023 through
May 2025, and open-ended continuity, as evidenced by the ongoing threats
and monitoring activities continuing through May 2025, with the potential
for continued criminal activity in the future. 34 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R
Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 35 of 45 103. The Defendants participated
in the operation and management of the Enterprise by making decisions on
behalf of the Enterprise and by directing its affairs. Specifically: 1.
Defendant Myers directed the Enterprise by initiating the criminal scheme,
communicating the scheme's objectives to Branthoover, opening a private
bank account, transferring marital funds, traveling interstate to coordinate
fraudulent document preparation, and filing fraudulent legal documents in
Texas courts. 11. Defendant Branthoover directed the Enterprise by
providing administrative oversight of the scheme, offering his expertise on
protective order procedures, coordinating Myers' interstate travel, receiving
and retaining fraudulently transferred funds, preparing fraudulent legal
documents, and attempting to exert control over communications related to
the legal proceedings. l04. As a direct and proximate result of the
Defendants' violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), Plaintiff has been injured in his
business and property in an amount to be dete1mined at trial. Specifically,
Plaintiff has suffered: 1. Loss of $1,576 fraudulently transferred from the
joint marital account; 11. Business losses resulting from the disrnption of his
home-based business operations; 111. Additional financial damages
resulting from the overdrawn account 35 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R Document
16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 36 of 45 and associated fees; 1v. Loss of real and
personal property rights through the fraudulent manipulation of judicial
proceedings; v1. Ongoing damages resulting from the continued operation
of the Enterprise. 105. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c), Plaintiff is entitled to

=== PAGE 15 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
recover from the Defendants threefold the damages sustained, explained in
more detail below. COUNT 2: VIOLATION OF 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d) Against All
Defendants 106. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the
allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 105 above, as if fully set forth
herein. 107. Beginning on December 14, 2023, and continuing through at
least May 24, 2025, the Defendants knowingly, willfully, and unlawfully
conspired to violate 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), that is, to conduct and participate,
directly and indirectly, in the conduct of the affairs of the Enterprise,
through a pattern of racketeering activity, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d),
as explained above. 108. The conspiracy between Myers and Branthoover
was formed on or about December 14, 2023, evidenced by the intensive
communications (92 text messages) exchanged between them immediately
following Plaintiffs discovery of Myers' extramarital affair. These
communications---documented in Plaintiff's possession and available for
production at the appropriate stage---demonstrate the deliberate and
coordinated formation of the conspiracy. 36 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R Document
16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 37 of 45 109. Each Defendant agreed that they
would commit at least two acts of racketeering activity in the conduct of the
affairs of the Enterprise. The agreement can be infened from the
Defendants' coordinated actions, including: 1. The systematic coordination
of their activities through interstate communications; 11. The division of
responsibilities within the Enterprise; iii. The implementation of operational
security measures; IV. The consistent pattern of actions furthering the
fraudulent scheme; v. The ongoing coordination over an eighteen-month
period. 110. In furtherance of the conspiracy, the Defendants committed
numerous overt acts, including but not limited to: I. Myers opening a private
bank account to facilitate asset concealment on December 14, 2023 and
sharing these details with Branthoover; ii. Myers and Branthoover
exchanging 92 text messages on December 14, 2023, to coordinate their
criminal plans; m. Branthoover placing a deceptive phone call to Plaintiff on
December 15, 2023; IV. Myers executing an interstate wire transfer of
$1,576 to Branthoover's PayPal account on December 15, 2023; v. Myers
traveling interstate to Oklahoma on December 15, 2023, to coordinate with
Branthoover; vi. Myers and Branthoover preparing fraudulent cowt
documents in 37 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 38
of 45 Oklahoma on December 16-17, 2023 to be later submitted in Texas
courts on December 18,22; vu. Myers transporting the fraudulent
documents back to Texas on December 17, 2023; vm. Branthoover sending
threatening text messages to Plaintiff on December 18, 2023; 1x. Myers
filing fraudulent documents with Texas courts on December 18, 2023; x.
Myers filing a fraudulent Application for Protective Order on December 22,
2023; x1. Branthoover continuing to send threatening communications to
Plaintiff through May 24, 2025. 111. As a direct and proximate result of the
Defendants' conspiracy in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d), Plaintiff has been
injured in his business and property. The injuries suffered by Plaintiff include
but are not limited to: 1. Loss of $1,576 fraudulently transferred from the
joint marital account; ii. Business losses resulting from the dismption of his
home-based business operations; iii. Additional financial damages resulting
from the overdrawn account and associated fees; 1v. Loss of real and
personal property rights through the fraudulent 38 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R
Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 39 of 45 manipulation of judicial
proceedings; v. Ongoing economic harm resulting from the continued

=== PAGE 16 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
operation of the Enterprise. 112. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c), Plaintiff is
entitled to recover from the Defendants threefold the damages sustained,
explained in more detail below. XI. Damages 113. Plaintiff realleges and
incorporates by reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through
112 above, as if fully set forth herein. 114. As a direct result of the
racketeering activity alleged herein, the Plaintiff has sustained substantial
injury to his business operations, suffered significant credit decrease, has
lost business opportunities, had his personal belongings destroyed, has had
one vehicle repossessed, and has been subject to transient and unstable
housing. A. Damage to Business Operations 11 5. In January of 2021,
Plaintiff founded a digital financial analytics business from his home,
focused on delivering real-time stock market data, automated technical
indicators, and live market commentary to retail traders and boutique
investment groups across the United States and Canada. His monetization
model included tiered subscription plans, custom data feed licensing, and
API endpoints that offered real-time market data. 116. By 2022, client
demand and revenue growth began outpacing Plaintiff's initial architecture.
In response, Plaintiff made the strategic decision to pause direct
monetization in early 2023 to reinvest in infrastructure and ensure the
platform could handle commercial-scale traffic. This included: 39 Case 5:24-
cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 40 of 45 1. Designing and
deploying asynchronous financial signal algorithms, 11. Mastering
asynchronous programming, PostgreSQL and NoSQL systems for storage
and efficiency purposes, iii. Building websocket-based dashboards for live
data streaming, iv. Drafting licensing terms for premium indicator access
and reseller API use. v. Building pa1tnerships and affiliations with similar
businesses in the market-data space. This period of reinvestment came at
significant cost: Plaintiff temporarily sacrificed a revenue stream that had
reached $12,000 per month at its peak in exchange for longterm scalability.
Plaintiff anticipated a short-term revenue dip, which he strategically
absorbed in reliance on his imminent reentry to market. 117. By September
of 2023, Plaintiff had completed core backend optimization and UI
integrations and obtained an affiliate marketing partnership with polygon.io
and was prepared to scale user acquisition and marketing. This readiness
marked a significant inflection point in Plaintiff's commercial trajectory. 118.
Plaintiff reasonably projected a return to $9,000-$10,000/month by mid-
2024, with a 24-month growth model targeting $170,124.59 in revenue
through subscriptions and data services alone. This forecast was based not
on speculation, but on verified revenue history, platform readiness, and
documented user engagement trends. 119. As part of Defendants'
coordinated scheme to deprive Plaintiff of his home and operational
capacity, Plaintiff was wrongfully and suddenly removed from the family 40
Case 5:24-cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 41 of 45 residence
in January 2024, despite Defendants' full knowledge that he operated an
active and income-generating business from that location. This action
caused a direct and immediate injury to Plaintiff's business, cutting off his
ability to scale as planned. Instead of growing, Plaintiff's revenue collapsed.
120. The removal was executed without warning or legal justification and
had an immediate effect on Plaintiff's operations. Although the core data
systems were technically portable, the business depended on commercial-
grade internet, low-latency upload speeds, and a consistent, uninterrupted
digital environment to support real-time financial analytics, streaming, and

=== PAGE 17 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
API-based services. Following the removal, Plaintiff was unable to find
alternate housing with sufficient bandwidth. Attempts to work from
temporary family residences failed, as Plaintiff's usage either exceeded
available internet capacity or interfered with household connectivity, making
it impossible to maintain stable service. Without the ability to stream,
deliver data products, or support his clients, Plaintiffs revenue quickly
declined and client engagement deteriorated. 121. Between September and
December 2023, Plaintiff earned $10,529.72, averaging $2,632.43 per
month - his baseline earnings during the period of restructuring. Based on
past performance, technical stability, and confirmed subscriber growth
through marketing strategies, Plaintiff reasonably projected returning to
$5,000/month by mid- 2024, with stable, scalable performance continuing
through 2025. 122. Under a conservative model, had the business not been
disrupted by Defendants' interference, Plaintiff would have earned: 41 Case
5:24-cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 42 of 45 1.
Approximately $15,794.58 during the first half of 2024 (maintaining his pre-
removal baseline), ii. Approximately $24,000.00 during the second half of
2024 (with moderate growth to $4,000/month), 111. And approximately
$60,000.00 across 2025 (at $5,000/month). This yields a total projected
income of$99,794.58 for the 18-month period following the wrongful
removal. 123. Accordingly, Plaintiff seeks recovery of $99,794.58 in lost
business income directly caused by Defendants' pattern of racketeering
activity described above. B. Damages - Fraudulent Transfer and Cessation of
Business Advertisements 124. As noted above, Defendants coordinated in
emptying the joint marital PNC bank account, transferring $1,576.00 from
Plaintiff to a Pay Pal account controlled by Daniel Kenneth Branthoover,
which was subsequently routed to Morgan Michelle Myers. These funds
were used to purchase a second phone for Myers, enabling concealed
communication and coordination between Defendants in furtherance of their
scheme to defraud Plaintiff and obstruct his business operations.
Accordingly, Plaintiff therefore seeks recovery of the full amount of
$1,576.00. D. Damages - Total 126. As a direct result of the Defendants'
coordinated and fraudulent conduct detailed above, Plaintiff has sustained
total economic losses in the amount of one hundred and one thousand three
hundred seventy dollars and fifty-eight cents. ($101,370.58). This 42 Case
5:24-cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 43 of 45 includes: i. $99,
794.58 in lost business income caused by Defendant's actions leading to
Plaintiff's wrongful removal from his residence and the destruction of his
operational infrastructure over the last 18 months; 11. $1,576.00 in marital
funds fraudulently transferred from Plaintiff's joint bank account in
furtherance of a scheme to defraud. 127. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c),
Plaintiff is entitled to treble damages for injuries sustained to his business
and property because of Defendants' racketeering activity. Accordingly,
Plaintiff seeks an award of treble damages in the total estimated amount of
three hundred and four thousand, one hundred and eleven dollars and
seventyfour cents ($304,111.74) to be further clarified at trial. 128. All
damages referenced herein are based on verifiable records and financial
documentation. Plaintiff will produce supporting evidence and exhibits at
the appropriate stage of these proceedings or at trial. Xll. PRAYER FOR
RELIEF 129. WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Charles Dustin Myers respectfully

Branthoover and Morgan Michelle Myers as follows: 1. For a specific finding

CHARLES DUST RS CHUCKDUSTINl 2@GMAIL.COM 817-546-3693 PRO-
SE PLAINTIFF TARRANTCOUNT~TEXAS 45 Does the Plaintiffs complaint
plausibly plead a claim for relief and should survive the motion to dismiss
stage? Answer Short response The Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint
plausibly pleads a civil RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. §§ 1962(c) and (d) and
should survive a motion to dismiss. The complaint alleges with sufficient
particularity the existence of an enterprise, a pattern of racketeering
activity (including wire fraud and Travel Act violations), and resulting injury
to business or property. Summary The Plaintiff’s complaint sets out detailed
factual allegations that, if taken as true, satisfy the four essential elements
of a civil RICO claim: (1) conduct, (2) of an enterprise, (3) through a pattern,
(4) of racketeering activity. The complaint also alleges a RICO conspiracy
under § 1962(d), and pleads injury to business and property proximately
caused by the alleged racketeering, as required for standing under §
1964(c). The allegations are sufficiently particular to meet the heightened
pleading standard for fraud-based RICO claims, and the pattern of
racketeering activity is supported by multiple predicate acts (wire fraud and
Travel Act violations) that are related and continuous. The complaint also
describes an association-in-fact enterprise distinct from the racketeering
acts themselves, and the injuries alleged are of the type cognizable under
RICO. Accordingly, the complaint should not be dismissed at the pleading
stage. Background and Relevant Law Statutory Framework Civil RICO
claims are governed by 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961–1964. To state a claim under §
1962(c), a plaintiff must allege: (1) conduct, (2) of an enterprise, (3) through
a pattern, (4) of racketeering activity. Predicate acts of racketeering activity
are defined in § 1961(1) and include wire fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343) and
violations of the Travel Act (18 U.S.C. § 1952). Section 1962(d) prohibits
conspiracies to violate § 1962(c). Section 1964(c) provides a private right of
action for any person injured in business or property by reason of a RICO
violation, with treble damages available. Pleading Standards A civil RICO

=== PAGE 19 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
complaint must meet the plausibility standard of Rule 8(a), and, for fraud-
based predicate acts, the heightened particularity requirements of Rule 9(b).
This means the plaintiff must allege the circumstances of the fraud (or other
predicate acts) with sufficient detail to give notice to the defendants of the
claims against them, including the who, what, when, where, and how of the
alleged misconduct, as well as the injury suffered and its causal connection
to the racketeering activity, see Cracraft v. Utah Valley Univ., Case No. 2:19-
cv-397-TC (D. Utah Oct 19, 2020); Chapter 7. Pleading and Practice Issues.
Case Law The Tenth Circuit and district courts within its jurisdiction have
consistently held that to survive a motion to dismiss, a civil RICO complaint
must plausibly allege: (1) conduct, (2) of an enterprise, (3) through a
pattern, (4) of racketeering activity, and (5) injury to business or property
proximately caused by the RICO violation, see George v. Urban Settlement
Servs., 833 F.3d 1242 (10th Cir. 2016); Robert L. Kroenlein Trust v.
Kirchhefer, 764 F.3d 1268 (10th Cir. 2014); Clann Enters. v. Wilson, 25-
CV-00108-GKF-MTS (N.D. Okla. Sep 30, 2025); Jeter v. Wild W. Gas, LLC, 12-
cv-411-JDR-CDL, 15-cv-455-JDR-JFJ (N.D. Okla. Jul 01, 2025); UMB Bank v.
Monson, 21-CV-2504-EFM (D. Kan. Jun 04, 2025); Lopez v. Marriott Int'l,
Civil Action 23-cv-03308-RMR-KAS (D. Colo. Feb 27, 2025); Taylor v.
Chesapeake Operating, Inc., Case No. CIV-18-565-D (W.D. Okla. Nov 20,
2019); Tal v. Hogan, 453 F.3d 1244 (10th Cir. 2006). A pattern of
racketeering activity requires at least two predicate acts that are related
and amount to, or pose a threat of, continued criminal activity, see Bixler v.
Foster, 596 F.3d 751 (10th Cir. 2010); Sil-Flo, Inc. v. SFHC, Inc., 917 F.2d
1507 (10th Cir. 1990). The enterprise must be an ongoing organization,
formal or informal, with associates functioning as a continuing unit, and
must be distinct from the pattern of racketeering activity, see Jeter v. Wild
W. Gas, LLC, 12-cv-411-JDR-CDL, 15-cv-455-JDR-JFJ (N.D. Okla. Jul 01,
2025); George v. Urban Settlement Servs., 833 F.3d 1242 (10th Cir. 2016).
For RICO conspiracy under § 1962(d), the plaintiff must allege that the
defendants agreed to commit two or more predicate acts constituting a
pattern of racketeering activity, see United States v. Martinez, 543 F.Supp.
3d 1209 (D. N.M. 2021) (noting that the Tenth Circuit requires knowledge
and agreement to facilitate a § 1962(c) violation). Analysis 1. Conduct of an
Enterprise The complaint alleges that Myers and Branthoover formed an
association-in-fact enterprise with the common purpose of depriving Plaintiff
of his property and manipulating judicial proceedings. The enterprise is
described as having a structure, continuity, and roles: Myers as the "inside"
operative with access to assets and the courts, and Branthoover as the
"outside" operative providing administrative oversight and expertise. The
complaint details ongoing coordination, communication, and division of
labor over an 18-month period. This satisfies the requirement for an
enterprise under RICO, which can be informal and need not be a legal entity,
as long as it is an ongoing organization with associates functioning as a
continuing unit, see Tal v. Hogan, 453 F.3d 1244 (10th Cir. 2006); Jeter v.
Wild W. Gas, LLC, 12-cv-411-JDR-CDL, 15-cv-455-JDR-JFJ (N.D. Okla. Jul 01,
2025). The enterprise is also distinct from the pattern of racketeering
activity, as required, because it is alleged to have an existence and structure
beyond the commission of the predicate acts. 2. Pattern of Racketeering
Activity The complaint alleges multiple predicate acts, including wire fraud
(18 U.S.C. § 1343) and Travel Act violations (18 U.S.C. § 1952), both of which
are recognized as racketeering activity under § 1961(1). The wire fraud

=== PAGE 20 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
allegations are detailed: the complaint describes a scheme to defraud
involving the unauthorized transfer of $1,576 from a joint marital account to
Branthoover’s PayPal account, accompanied by interstate communications
and intent to deprive Plaintiff of property. The elements of wire fraud—
scheme to defraud, intent, and use of interstate wires—are all specifically
alleged, see Sundance Servs., Inc. v. Roach, Civ. No. 10-110 JP/CEG (D. N.M.
Sep 16, 2011); Fisher Sand & Gravel Co. v. FNF Constr., Inc., No. 10-cv-0635
RB/SMV (D. N.M. Mar 27, 2013). The Travel Act allegations are also
particularized: Myers is alleged to have traveled interstate with the intent to
facilitate unlawful activity (preparation of fraudulent court documents), and
to have performed overt acts in furtherance of that activity. These facts, if
true, are sufficient to allege a Travel Act violation as a RICO predicate, see
RICO: A Primer. The complaint alleges at least two predicate acts, and in
fact describes a series of related acts over an 18-month period, satisfying
the requirement for a pattern of racketeering activity, see Bixler v. Foster,
596 F.3d 751 (10th Cir. 2010); Sil-Flo, Inc. v. SFHC, Inc., 917 F.2d 1507
(10th Cir. 1990). The acts are related (same purpose, participants, victim,
and methods) and continuous (spanning more than a year and ongoing),
which meets the "continuity plus relationship" test. While perjury and
subornation of perjury are not themselves RICO predicates, the complaint
uses these acts to show the broader scheme and pattern, which is
permissible, see RICO: A Primer. 3. Injury to Business or Property The
Plaintiff alleges specific injuries to his business and property, including loss
of business income, loss of funds from the joint account, and loss of property
rights through fraudulent judicial proceedings. These are the types of
injuries cognizable under RICO, and the complaint alleges proximate
causation between the racketeering acts and the injuries, see Taylor v.
Chesapeake Operating, Inc., Case No. CIV-18-565-D (W.D. Okla. Nov 20,
2019); Joseph v. U.S. Pub. Defenders Office. 4. RICO Conspiracy The
complaint also alleges a RICO conspiracy under § 1962(d), asserting that
Myers and Branthoover agreed to commit the predicate acts and
coordinated their activities over an extended period. The Tenth Circuit
requires only that the defendants knowingly agreed to facilitate a § 1962(c)
violation, which is sufficiently alleged here, see United States v. Martinez,
543 F.Supp.3d 1209 (D. N.M. 2021). 5. Pleading Particularity The complaint
provides detailed factual allegations, including dates, participants,
communications, and the nature of the fraudulent acts. This level of detail is
sufficient to meet the heightened pleading standard for fraud-based RICO
claims under Rule 9(b), see Chapter 7. Pleading and Practice Issues. 6.
Standing The Plaintiff alleges injury to business and property caused by the
alleged racketeering activity, which is sufficient for RICO standing, see
Chapter 3. Standing. Exceptions and Caveats While the complaint is
sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss, the Plaintiff will ultimately bear the
burden of proving the elements of the predicate acts (including intent to
defraud), the existence and structure of the enterprise, and the causal
connection between the racketeering activity and the alleged injuries.
Defendants may raise defenses at later stages, such as challenging the
sufficiency of the evidence or the existence of a cognizable RICO injury.
Some older authorities cited in the tables have been overruled or
superseded in part (e.g., Condict v. Condict, 815 F.2d 579 (10th Cir. 1987)),
but the core elements of a RICO claim as articulated in more recent and
controlling Tenth Circuit and district court cases remain unchanged and are

=== PAGE 21 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
the basis for this analysis. Conclusion The Plaintiff’s First Amended
Complaint plausibly alleges all elements of a civil RICO claim under 18
U.S.C. §§ 1962(c) and (d), including the existence of an enterprise, a pattern
of racketeering activity (wire fraud and Travel Act violations), and injury to
business or property. The allegations are sufficiently particular to meet the
applicable pleading standards, and the complaint should survive a motion to
dismiss. The ultimate merits of the claim will depend on the Plaintiff’s ability
to prove these allegations with evidence at later stages of the litigation. 1

CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, ) ) Plaintiff, ) ) v. ) No. CIV-24-1311-R ) DANIEL
KENNETH BRANTHOOVER; ) and MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS, ) )
Defendants. ) ORDER Before the Court is Defendant Daniel Kenneth
Branthoover’s Motion to Dismiss [Doc. No. 18], as well as Defendant Morgan
Michelle Myers’ Motion to Dismiss [Doc. No. 24]. Plaintiff Charles Dustin
Myers responded [Doc. Nos. 21 & 28], and Defendant Branthoover filed a
reply brief [Doc. No. 25]. The matter is now at issue.1 For the reasons that
follow, the Motions are GRANTED. BACKGROUND On December 14, 2023,
Plaintiff allegedly discovered that his wife, Defendant Myers, was having an
affair [Doc. No. 16, ¶ 19]. That same day, Defendant Myers opened a private
bank account and exchanged several text messages with Defendant
Branthoover. Id. The next day, Defendant Myers transferred $1,576.00 from
her joint account with Plaintiff to Defendant Branthoover, then traveled to
Defendant Branthoover’s home in 1 All parties to this action are proceeding
pro se. The Court therefore gives the pleadings a liberal construction but
does not act as an advocate. See Hall v. Bellmon, 935 F.2d 1106, 1110 (10th
Cir. 1991). Case 5:24-cv-01311-R Document 29 Filed 08/28/25 Page 1 of 8 2
Oklahoma to draft allegedly fraudulent legal documents. Id. ¶¶ 23, 25. This
transfer caused the account to be overdrawn, which harmed Plaintiff’s
business. Id. ¶ 26. Plaintiff contends that this transfer constitutes wire fraud
in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1343, and that Defendant Myers’ trip to Oklahoma
violated the Travel Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1952. Id. ¶¶ 25, 59, 74. On December 17,
2023, Defendant Myers allegedly “completed the interstate transportation
phase of the criminal scheme by transporting the fraudulent court
documents prepared in Oklahoma back across state lines to Texas. Id. ¶ 35.
These documents were filed in a Texas court the next day. Id. ¶ 39. On
January 16, 2024, Plaintiff was ordered to vacate the home he shared with
Defendant Myers. Id. ¶ 47. According to Plaintiff, this marked the
achievement of Defendants’ primary criminal objective. Id. ¶¶ 47-48.
Plaintiff filed this civil RICO suit under 18 U.S.C. §§ 1962(c) and (d).
Defendants have moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim and improper
venue.2 LEGAL STANDARD Dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) is proper when a
complaint fails “to state a claim upon which relief can be granted[.]” Fed. R.
Civ. P. 12(b)(6). “To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the complaint ‘must
contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief
that is plausible on its face.’” Brown v. City of Tulsa, 124 F.4th 1251, 1263
(10th Cir. 2025) (quoting Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009)). And
while the Court “must accept the truth of all properly alleged facts and draw
all reasonable inferences in 2 The Court notes that based on Plaintiff’s
allegations, a substantial part of the events giving rise to the litigation
occurred in this District, and therefore venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. §
1391(b)(2). Case 5:24-cv-01311-R Document 29 Filed 08/28/25 Page 2 of 8 3
the plaintiff’s favor, the plaintiff still ‘must nudge the claim across the line

=== PAGE 22 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
from conceivable or speculative to plausible.’” Id. (quoting Brooks v. Mentor
Worldwide LLC, 985 F.3d 1272, 1281 (10th Cir. 2021)). “Mere ‘labels and
conclusions’ or ‘formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action’ will
not suffice.” Id. (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570
(2007)). DISCUSSION “To plead a valid RICO claim, a plaintiff must
plausibly allege that a defendant ‘(1) conducted the affairs (2) of an
enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity.’” Johnson v.
Heath, 56 F.4th 851, 858 (10th Cir. 2022) (quoting George v. Urb. Settlement
Servs., 833 F.3d 1242, 1248 (10th Cir. 2016)). Because the Court finds that
Plaintiff did not adequately allege a pattern of racketeering activity, it tailors
its analysis to that element. “[A] RICO pattern requires that the racketeering
predicates relate to each other and amount to a threat of continued
racketeering activity.” Id. (citing H.J. Inc. v. Nw. Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229,
239 (1989)). “[R]acketeering predicates relate to each other if they ‘have the
same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of
commission, or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics
and are not isolated events.’” Id. at 859 (quoting H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 240).
“Predicate acts satisfy the relationship requirement when they make up one
common scheme.” Id. (citing Sil-Flo, Inc. v. SFHC, Inc., 917 F.2d 1507, 1516
(10th Cir. 1990)). The standard is “‘not a cumbersome one.’” Id. (quoting
Bixler v. Foster, 596 F.3d 751, 761 (10th Cir. 2010)). Case 5:24-cv-01311-R
Document 29 Filed 08/28/25 Page 3 of 8 4 The continuity requirement on the
other hand is “more stringent than the relationship standard.” Id. (citing
Bixler, 596 F.3d at 761). Continuity “‘depends on the facts of each case[],’”
id. (quoting H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 241-42), and “can be either closed or open
ended[,]” id. (citing H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 241). “Closed-ended continuity is a
closed period of repeated racketeering conduct, while open-ended continuity
consists of racketeering conduct that threatens future repetition.” Id. (citing
H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 241). “Plaintiffs can establish open-ended continuity by
showing that the racketeering acts involved implicit or explicit threats of
repetition, that they formed the operations of an association that exists for
criminal purposes, or that they were the defendants’ regular way of
conducting a legitimate enterprise.” Id. at 859-60 (citing H.J. Inc., 492 U.S.
at 242-43). “[C]losed-ended continuity consists of a closed period of
repeated, related racketeering acts that do not necessarily threaten future
repetition.” Id. at 860 (citing H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 241-42). And “[b]ecause
RICO targets long-term racketeering conduct, closed-ended continuity
requires a series of related racketeering acts over a ‘substantial period of
time.’” Id. (quoting H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 242). Two factors are relevant to
determine whether there is closed-ended continuity: “the duration of the
related predicate acts and the extensiveness of the racketeering scheme. Id.
(citation omitted). Regarding the first factor, “predicate acts extending over
a few weeks or months do not show closed-ended continuity.” Poindexter v.
Stuteville, No. CIV-12-0031-F, 2012 WL 13035041, at *7 (W.D. Okla. May 10,
2012) (citing Resol. Tr. Corp. v. Stone, 998 F.2d 1534, 1543 (10th Cir. 1993)),
abrogated on other grounds by Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938 (2009)).
For the second factor, courts “consider ‘the number of victims, the number
of racketeering acts, Case 5:24-cv-01311-R Document 29 Filed 08/28/25
Page 4 of 8 5 the variety of racketeering acts, whether the injuries were
distinct, the complexity and size of the scheme, and the nature or character
of the enterprise.’” Johnson, 56 F.4th at 860 (quoting Resol. Tr. Corp., 998 F.
2d at 1543). Plaintiff alleges that Defendants’ “scheme extends over a

=== PAGE 23 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
substantial period of time—from December 2023 through May 2025, over
eighteen months[,]” Doc. No. 16, ¶ 86(i). The predicate acts—wire fraud and
violation of the Travel Act—took place within days of each other in
December of 2023. Id. ¶¶ 83-84. Plaintiff claims that Defendants’ alleged
scheme “achieved its primary criminal objective” on January 16, 2024, when
he was ordered to vacate the family home. Id. ¶ 47. So it took just over one
month from the formation of the alleged enterprise to complete its primary
goal. Nevertheless, Plaintiff points to the following to demonstrate the
duration of the scheme: • Defendants’ continued interstate communication
regarding the case “in direct furtherance of their fraudulent scheme to see
the divorce through to its finalization[;]” • Defendant Branthoover’s June 23,
2024, text message to Plaintiff stating “Lol. And here comes another
denial[;]” • Defendant Branthoover’s December 12, 2024, text message to
Plaintiff stating "When things all over you get to deal with me. Just a heads
up[;]” • Defendant Branthoover’s statement “I’ve been enjoying watching
every filing get denied[;]” and • Defendant Branthoover’s May 24, 2025, text
message to Plaintiff stating “Where’s my lawsuit? Heard your vm about me.
File it. Let’s do this :)[.]” Id. ¶¶ 49-52. But the communications between
Defendants and the text messages from Defendant Branthoover are not
related to the initial scheme, nor do they show continuity sufficient to
demonstrate a pattern of racketeering activities. Case 5:24-cv-01311-R
Document 29 Filed 08/28/25 Page 5 of 8 6 Beginning with the relatedness
prong, Plaintiff does not allege that the text messages from Defendant
Branthoover were sent with the intention of defrauding Plaintiff of money, or
to create and file fraudulent court documents. See Doc. No. 16, ¶ 101
(claiming that the purpose of the predicate acts was “to defraud Plaintiff of
his property interests and manipulate judicial proceedings”). Instead, he
alleges that these texts evidence retaliation, malice, and involvement in the
Texas litigation. Id. ¶¶ 49-52. Aside from being temporally distinct, the
messages are distinct in character from the initial alleged scheme and do
not evidence criminal conduct. And as for the alleged interstate
communications between Defendants regarding the case, this allegation is
conclusory and does not demonstrate that the communications relate to the
initial common scheme to defraud Plaintiff and to file false documents
created across state lines. Id. ¶ 101. Accordingly, Plaintiff has failed to meet
the bar of relatedness sufficient to show a pattern of racketeering activity.3
The same is true for the continuity prong of the pattern requirement.
Plaintiff points to the text messages from Defendant Branthoover and the
continuing communication between Defendants as evidence of an implicit or
explicit threat of repetition. But these messages—while taunting—do not
plausibly support a continuing threat of criminal conduct. Neither do the
vaguely pled claims of continued communications between Defendants. So
Plaintiff fails to demonstrate open-ended continuity. 3 Plaintiff alleges that
perjury and subornation of perjury sufficiently connect the predicate acts of
wire fraud and violation of the Travel Act. Doc. No. 16, ¶¶ 87-88. Assuming
without deciding that is true, he still does not relate the text messages and
on-going communication to the predicate acts that were performed in
December of 2023 and successfully completed in January of 2024. Case
5:24-cv-01311-R Document 29 Filed 08/28/25 Page 6 of 8 7 Regarding
closed-ended continuity, “it is well established that a single scheme to
accomplish one discrete goal, directed at a finite group of individuals, with
no potential to extend to other persons or entities, rarely will suffice to

Bank, Inc., 153 F. App’x 498, 502 (10th Cir. 2005) (collecting cases). Plaintiff
alleges a scheme that achieved its primary objective within one month of its
formation, harmed only one victim, had no potential to harm others, involved
two predicate acts of an isolated nature, and consisted of two individuals.
And even if the scheme lasted over 18 months, when considering the factors
set out in Resolution Trust, Plaintiff alleges “at best…a closed-ended series
of predicate acts constituting a single scheme to accomplish a discrete goal
directed at only one individual with no potential to extend to other persons
or entities.” Poindexter, 2012 WL 13035041, at *7 (citing Hall v. Witteman,
584 F.3d 859, 867-68 (10th Cir. 2009)). This is insufficient to establish
closed-ended continuity. “Courts have uniformly and consistently held that
schemes involving a single, narrow purpose and one or few participants
directed towards a single victim do not satisfy the RICO requirement of a
closed or open pattern of continuity.” Skurkey v. Daniel, No. CIV-22-496-R,

here, and what should Plaintiff say on appeal?
Answer (Tenth Circuit)
Short response
The judge erred by misapplying the RICO continuity and relatedness
requirements, improperly characterizing the alleged scheme as a single,
short-lived event with a discrete goal, and failing to credit the well-pleaded
allegations of an ongoing, multi-act racketeering pattern spanning 18
months. On appeal, Plaintiff should argue that the complaint plausibly
alleges both closed-ended and open-ended continuity, with related predicate
acts and ongoing threats, thus satisfying the "pattern" requirement under
controlling Tenth Circuit and Supreme Court precedent.
Summary
The district court dismissed Plaintiff’s RICO claim on the grounds that the
alleged racketeering activity was a single, narrow scheme directed at one
victim, with its primary objective achieved within a month, and that
subsequent communications and threats were unrelated or insufficient to
show continuity. However, the complaint alleges a series of related predicate
acts (wire fraud and Travel Act violations) over an 18-month period, ongoing

=== PAGE 25 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
coordination and threats, and a continuing enterprise with an unfulfilled
objective (the finalization of the divorce and disposition of property), all of
which, if taken as true, are sufficient to plead both the relationship and
continuity prongs of the RICO "pattern" requirement.
On appeal, Plaintiff should emphasize that the Tenth Circuit and Supreme
Court require only that predicate acts be related (a low bar) and that
continuity can be shown either by a substantial period of repeated acts
(closed-ended) or by a threat of ongoing criminal activity (open-ended). The
complaint’s detailed allegations of ongoing racketeering conduct, threats,
and enterprise activity over 18 months, with the scheme’s objective still
unfulfilled, are more than sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss under the
applicable standards.
Background and Relevant Law
Statutory Framework
Civil RICO claims under 18 U.S.C. §§ 1962(c) and (d) require a plaintiff to
allege: (1) conduct, (2) of an enterprise, (3) through a pattern, (4) of
racketeering activity. The "pattern" element requires at least two predicate
acts (such as wire fraud or Travel Act violations) that are both related and
continuous, as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5) and interpreted by the
Supreme Court and Tenth Circuit. Continuity can be closed-ended (a series
of related acts over a substantial period) or open-ended (a threat of ongoing
criminal activity). The relationship requirement is satisfied if the acts share
similar purposes, participants, victims, or methods, or are otherwise
interrelated and not isolated events.
Case Law
The Tenth Circuit and district courts have repeatedly held that the
relationship test is not demanding and is satisfied where predicate acts
share a common purpose, participants, victim, and methods, as in Clann
Enters. v. Wilson, 25-CV-00108-GKF-MTS (N.D. Okla. Sep 30, 2025). The
continuity requirement is more stringent, but can be met by either a closed
period of repeated conduct (closed-ended) or a threat of future repetition
(open-ended), as explained in Johnson v. Heath, 56 F.4th 851 (10th Cir. 2022)
and Nation v. Shah, 4:19-cv-00588-JDR-JFJ (N.D. Okla. Oct 30, 2024). The
Supreme Court in H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co. (cited throughout
the authorities) established that continuity and relationship are independent
but overlapping requirements, and that a pattern may be shown by a series
of related predicates over a substantial period or by a threat of ongoing
criminal conduct.
Courts have cautioned that a single, short-lived scheme with a discrete
objective, targeting only one victim, rarely suffices for continuity, as in 
Skurkey v. Daniel and Edwards v. First Nat. Bank, Bartlesville, Oklahoma,
872 F.2d 347 (10th Cir. 1989). However, where the scheme is ongoing,
involves multiple acts over a substantial period, and the enterprise’s
objective remains unfulfilled, continuity may be established, especially if

=== PAGE 26 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
there are ongoing threats or acts that further the enterprise’s goals, as
recognized in Resolution Trust Corp. v. Stone, 998 F.2d 1534 (10th Cir.
1993) and Schrag v. Dinges, 788 F.Supp. 1543 (D. Kan. 1992).
Secondary materials confirm that the "continuity plus relationship" test is
the governing standard, and that the relatedness prong is satisfied where
acts further the goals of the enterprise or are committed on its behalf, as in 
RICO: A Primer.
Analysis
1. The Judge’s Error: Misapplication of Continuity and
Relatedness
The district court’s primary error was its overly narrow reading of both the
continuity and relatedness requirements for a RICO "pattern." The court
concluded that the scheme was completed within a month (with Plaintiff’s
removal from the home) and that subsequent acts—such as ongoing threats,
communications, and efforts to finalize the divorce—were unrelated or
insufficient to show continuity. This analysis is inconsistent with both the
facts alleged and controlling law.
a. Relatedness
The relationship test is not demanding. Predicate acts are related if they
share a common purpose, participants, victim, and methods, or are
otherwise interrelated, as established in Clann Enters. v. Wilson, 25-
CV-00108-GKF-MTS (N.D. Okla. Sep 30, 2025) and Schrag v. Dinges, 788
F.Supp. 1543 (D. Kan. 1992). Here, the complaint alleges a series of acts—
wire fraud, Travel Act violations, and ongoing threats and communications—
all directed at depriving Plaintiff of property and manipulating judicial
proceedings, with the same participants (Myers and Branthoover), the same
victim (Plaintiff), and similar methods (fraud, deception, and manipulation of
legal processes). The ongoing communications and threats are not isolated
or unrelated, but are alleged to be part of the continuing effort to achieve
the enterprise’s broader objective: the fraudulent disposition of property
through the divorce, which remains unfulfilled (Myers v. Branthoover,
CIV-24-1311-R (W.D. Okla. Oct 14, 2025)).
The district court’s view that the later communications were merely
"taunting" or "retaliatory" ignores the well-pleaded allegations that these
acts were part of the ongoing scheme to intimidate Plaintiff, prevent him
from seeking relief, and ensure the success of the fraudulent enterprise.
Under RICO: A Primer, acts need not be identical or directly similar; it is
enough that they further the enterprise’s goals or are committed on its
behalf.

=== PAGE 27 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
b. Continuity
The continuity requirement can be satisfied in two ways: closed-ended (a
series of related acts over a substantial period) or open-ended (a threat of
ongoing criminal activity). The Supreme Court and Tenth Circuit have made
clear that continuity is a fact-specific inquiry, and that a substantial period of
repeated acts, or a threat of future repetition, suffices (Johnson v. Heath, 56
F.4th 851 (10th Cir. 2022); Resolution Trust Corp. v. Stone, 998 F.2d 1534
(10th Cir. 1993)).
Here, the complaint alleges predicate acts beginning in December 2023 and
continuing through at least May 2025—a period of 18 months. This is far
longer than the "few weeks or months" that courts have found insufficient
(MONARCH NORMANDY v. NORMANDY SQUARE, 817 F.Supp. 908 (D. Kan.
1993)). The scheme is not alleged to have ended with Plaintiff’s removal
from the home; rather, the complaint details ongoing efforts to finalize the
divorce, continued threats and intimidation, and a continuing enterprise
with an unfulfilled objective. The ongoing communications and threats are
alleged to be in furtherance of the same scheme, not isolated or unrelated
events.
The district court’s reliance on cases like Skurkey v. Daniel and Edwards v.
First Nat. Bank, Bartlesville, Oklahoma, 872 F.2d 347 (10th Cir. 1989) is
misplaced. Those cases involved truly discrete, short-lived schemes with no
ongoing activity or threat. Here, the complaint alleges a continuing
enterprise, ongoing acts, and a scheme that remains unfulfilled. The Tenth
Circuit in Johnson v. Heath, 56 F.4th 851 (10th Cir. 2022) and Clann Enters.
v. Wilson, 25-CV-00108-GKF-MTS (N.D. Okla. Sep 30, 2025) has recognized
that continuity can be shown by a substantial period of related acts or by a
threat of ongoing activity, especially where the enterprise’s objective is not
yet achieved.
2. The Complaint Satisfies the Pattern Requirement
The complaint alleges multiple predicate acts (wire fraud and Travel Act
violations), all related and continuous, over an 18-month period. The acts
are not isolated, but part of a continuing scheme with an unfulfilled
objective. The ongoing threats and communications are alleged to be in
furtherance of the enterprise’s goals, not mere afterthoughts. This is
sufficient to plead both closed-ended and open-ended continuity under the
"continuity plus relationship" test (Fisher Sand & Gravel Co. v. FNF Constr.,
Inc., No. 10-cv-0635 RB/SMV (D. N.M. Mar 27, 2013); RICO: A Primer).
The district court’s focus on the number of victims and the "discrete" nature
of the scheme is contrary to the fact-specific, flexible approach required by
the Supreme Court and Tenth Circuit. While a single victim and a narrow
purpose may weigh against continuity, they are not dispositive, especially
where the scheme is ongoing, involves repeated acts over a substantial
period, and the enterprise’s objective remains unfulfilled (Clann Enters. v.
Wilson, 25-CV-00108-GKF-MTS (N.D. Okla. Sep 30, 2025); Resolution Trust
Corp. v. Stone, 998 F.2d 1534 (10th Cir. 1993)).

=== PAGE 28 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
3. The Complaint Satisfies Other RICO Elements
The complaint also adequately pleads the existence of an enterprise (an
association-in-fact with structure, continuity, and roles), conduct of the
enterprise’s affairs, and injury to business or property proximately caused
by the racketeering activity. These elements are not in serious dispute, and
the district court did not find otherwise.
4. What Plaintiff Should Argue on Appeal
On appeal, Plaintiff should argue:
The district court misapplied the continuity and relatedness
requirements, ignoring the well-pleaded allegations of ongoing
racketeering acts, threats, and enterprise activity over 18 months.
The complaint alleges both closed-ended continuity (a substantial
period of repeated acts) and open-ended continuity (an ongoing threat,
with the enterprise’s objective unfulfilled and ongoing threats and
acts).
The relationship test is easily satisfied, as all acts share a common
purpose, participants, victim, and methods, and further the enterprise’s
goals.
The ongoing communications and threats are not isolated or unrelated,
but are alleged to be in furtherance of the same scheme.
The complaint meets the pleading standards under Rule 8(a) and Rule
9(b), with detailed factual allegations of the who, what, when, where,
and how of the racketeering acts.
The district court’s reliance on cases involving truly discrete, short-
lived schemes is misplaced, as the facts here show an ongoing, multi-
act scheme with an unfulfilled objective.
Plaintiff should cite Johnson v. Heath, 56 F.4th 851 (10th Cir. 2022), Clann
Enters. v. Wilson, 25-CV-00108-GKF-MTS (N.D. Okla. Sep 30, 2025), 
Resolution Trust Corp. v. Stone, 998 F.2d 1534 (10th Cir. 1993), and RICO: A
Primer to support these arguments.
Exceptions and Caveats
While the complaint is sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss, Plaintiff will
ultimately bear the burden of proving the elements of the predicate acts, the
existence and structure of the enterprise, and the causal connection
between the racketeering activity and the alleged injuries. Defendants may
raise defenses at later stages, such as challenging the sufficiency of the
evidence or the existence of a cognizable RICO injury. Some older
authorities, such as Condict v. Condict, 815 F.2d 579 (10th Cir. 1987), have
been superseded in part, but the core elements of a RICO claim as
articulated in more recent and controlling Tenth Circuit and district court
cases remain unchanged.

Conclusion
The district court erred by misapplying the RICO continuity and relatedness
requirements, failing to credit the well-pleaded allegations of an ongoing,
multi-act racketeering pattern spanning 18 months, and improperly
characterizing the scheme as a single, short-lived event. On appeal, Plaintiff
should argue that the complaint plausibly alleges both closed-ended and
open-ended continuity, with related predicate acts and ongoing threats, thus
satisfying the "pattern" requirement under controlling Tenth Circuit and
Supreme Court precedent. The complaint should therefore survive a motion
to dismiss, and the case should proceed to discovery and further
proceedings.
Legal Authorities
Torwest DBC, Inc. v. Dick, 810 F.2d 925 (10th Cir. 1987)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
In this case, the court and the parties assumed for purposes of the court's
ruling that defendants engaged in numerous racketeering acts. It is clear
that when, as here, the acts are part of a common fraudulent scheme, they
satisfy the relationship requirement of Sedima. See, e.g., Superior Oil Co. v.
Fulmer, 785 F.2d 252 (8th Cir.1986). However, to establish a RICO pattern, a
plaintiff must also demonstrate continuity, that is, 'the threat of continuing
activity.' Sedima, 105 S.Ct. at 3285 n. 14. This element is derived from
RICO's legislative history, which indicates that RICO does not apply to
'sporadic activity' or to the 'isolated offender'. Id. The continuity
requirement has been the source of considerable difficulty. Courts generally
agree that to make an adequate showing of continuity under Sedima, a
plaintiff must demonstrate some facts from which at least a threat of
ongoing illegal conduct may be inferred. A scheme to achieve a single
discrete objective does not in and of itself create a threat of ongoing activity,
even when that goal is pursued by multiple illegal acts, because the scheme
ends when the purpose is accomplished.
Summary
To establish a RICO pattern, a plaintiff must demonstrate both relatedness
and continuity of racketeering activity. The continuity requirement is
particularly challenging and requires showing a threat of ongoing illegal
conduct. A single scheme with a discrete objective, even if pursued through
multiple illegal acts, does not satisfy the continuity requirement if the
scheme ends once the objective is achieved. This is relevant to the judge's
decision because the judge found that the Plaintiff's allegations did not
demonstrate continuity, as the scheme had a single objective that was
achieved within a short period.

U.S. District Court — District of Kansas
Extract
A 'pattern' of racketeering is defined as 'at least two acts of racketeering
activity... which occurred within ten years' of each other. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5).
'However, because RICO is not aimed at the isolated offender, proof of two
or more predicate acts [is] not sufficient to prove a pattern unless there is a
relationship between the predicate acts and a threat of continuing activity.'
Hogan, 453 F.3d at 1267-68 (citations omitted). Continuity of threat requires
proof of 'a series of related predicates extending over a substantial period of
time,' or a 'showing that the predicates themselves involve a distinct threat
of long-term racketeering activity... or that the predicates are a regular way
of conducting the defendant's ongoing legitimate business or the RICO
enterprise.'
Summary
To establish a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO, there must be a
relationship between the predicate acts and a threat of continuing activity.
This can be shown through a series of related predicates extending over a
substantial period or a distinct threat of long-term racketeering activity. The
judge in the Plaintiff's case dismissed the RICO claim for failing to establish
a pattern of racketeering activity, likely due to a lack of continuity or
relatedness in the alleged acts. The Plaintiff should argue on appeal that the
alleged acts are related and continuous, emphasizing any ongoing threat or
long-term nature of the racketeering activity.
Thompson v. Wyoming Alaska, Inc., 652 F.Supp. 1222 (D. Utah 1987)
U.S. District Court — District of Utah
Extract
In Papai, Judge Moran required that plaintiff's pleadings demonstrate
multiple 'episodes' of racketeering activity plus some other evidence which
raises an inference that the episodes 'were not an aberration in the way a
defendant conducted his business. Rather, the pattern made up of multiple
episodes must be a regular part of the way a defendant does business and in
that sense, ongoing.' ... A more flexible and accurate approach to identifying
pattern may be to require either 1) more than one scheme or 2) an open-
ended continuous scheme which contains a multiplicity of predicate acts. ...
Assuming the other requirements of pattern to be present this court
recognizes that a civil RICO cause properly could be brought based upon
predicate acts perpetrated pursuant to a single scheme involving separate

=== PAGE 31 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
independent harms, such as where multiple victims suffer discrete
injuries. ... The exact meaning of the term 'multiple criminal episodes' is not
clear, but at a minimum it means that the defendant must harm the plaintiff
more than once — it must have committed acts which are ongoing and
which have an independent and repeated harmful significance for the
plaintiff.
Summary
A pattern of racketeering activity under RICO requires either multiple
schemes or a continuous scheme with multiple predicate acts. The acts must
be ongoing and have independent harmful significance. The court in
Thompson v. Wyoming Alaska, Inc. emphasized that a single scheme with
separate independent harms could suffice if it involves continuous behavior
and a threat of ongoing illegal conduct.

To plead a valid RICO claim, a plaintiff must plausibly allege that a
defendant '(1) conducted the affairs (2) of an enterprise (3) through a
pattern (4) of racketeering activity.' George v. Urb. Settlement Servs., 833 F.
3d 1242, 1248 (10th Cir. 2016). 'Racketeering activity' consists of the
criminal offenses listed in 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1), and a 'pattern' requires at
least two racketeering acts committed within ten years of each other. 18
U.S.C. § 1961(5).
Summary
Requirements for a valid RICO claim, emphasizing the need for a pattern of
racketeering activity, which consists of at least two acts within ten years.
The judge in the district court dismissed the case for lack of a pattern,
focusing on the continuity and relatedness of the acts. However, the passage
suggests that the judge may have erred in not fully considering the duration
and extensiveness of the alleged scheme, as well as the potential for closed-
ended continuity. The appellate court in Johnson v. Heath acknowledges that
duration alone may not establish continuity, but it is a significant factor. The
Plaintiff should argue on appeal that the district court failed to adequately
consider the duration and extensiveness of the scheme, which spanned over
18 months and involved multiple predicate acts, thus meeting the closed-
ended continuity requirement.

To establish a substantive RICO violation, a plaintiff must show that there
was 'a pattern of racketeering activity.' 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). At least two
predicate acts of racketeering activity are required but not necessarily
sufficient to demonstrate a pattern. Heinrich v. Waiting Angels Adoption
Servs., Inc., 668 F.3d 393, 409 (6th Cir. 2012). 'RICO is not aimed at the
isolated offender,' so, in addition to the predicate acts, a plaintiff must show
that the racketeering predicates are related and amount to 'a threat of
continuing activity.' Tal, 453 F.3d at 1267-68 (quoting Resolution Trust Corp.
v. Stone, 998 F.2d 1534, 1544 (10th Cir. 1993)). This test has come to be
called the 'continuity plus relationship' test.
Summary
The passage explains that to establish a RICO violation, a plaintiff must
demonstrate a pattern of racketeering activity, which requires at least two
predicate acts that are related and amount to a threat of continuing activity.
This is known as the "continuity plus relationship" test. The judge in the
current case dismissed the RICO claim, finding that the alleged scheme did
not demonstrate a pattern of racketeering activity. However, the passage
suggests that the plaintiff could argue that the predicate acts were related
and posed a threat of continuing activity, which could establish the
necessary pattern under RICO.

The Court believed Congress intended the same notion of the relationships
between predicates for RICO's pattern requirement. Id. at 240, 109 S.Ct. at

scheme requirement and stated, 'What a plaintiff or prosecutor must prove
is continuity of racketeering activity, or its threat, simpliciter.' Id. at 241,
109 S.Ct. at 2901. To establish continuity, a plaintiff must demonstrate either
'a closed period of repeated conduct' or 'past conduct that by its nature
projects into the future with a threat of repetition.' Id. Close-ended
continuity requires 'a series of related predicates extending over a
substantial period of time. Predicate acts extending over a few weeks or
months and threatening no future criminal conduct do not satisfy this
requirement.' Id. Open-ended continuity requires a clear threat of future
criminal conduct related to past criminal conduct. Id.

Summary
Closed-ended continuity requires a series of related predicates extending
over a substantial period of time, and that predicate acts extending over a
few weeks or months without a threat of future criminal conduct do not
satisfy this requirement. This is relevant to the judge's decision, as the judge
found that the Plaintiff's allegations did not demonstrate a pattern of
racketeering activity due to a lack of continuity.

Summary
While two acts of racketeering activity are necessary to establish a pattern
under RICO, they may not be sufficient. A pattern requires more than just
multiple predicates; it requires continuity and relationship among the acts.

The Supreme Court has concluded that Congress intended that the pattern

Open-ended continuity depends upon the facts of each case, and may be

the predicates are a regular way of conducting the defendant's ongoing
legitimate business or the RICO enterprise.

Summary
The passage from Resolution Trust Corp. v. Stone provides insight into the
requirements for establishing a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO,
specifically the need for "continuity plus relationship." The court in this case
emphasized that continuity can be either closed-ended or open-ended, and
that open-ended continuity may be established by showing a distinct threat
of long-term racketeering activity. This is relevant to the Plaintiff's case
because the judge dismissed the RICO claim for lack of continuity, but the
Plaintiff could argue on appeal that the alleged scheme involved a threat of
continued criminal activity, as evidenced by ongoing communications and
threats from Defendant Branthoover.

Extract
Plaintiff next contends that the Court's order 'overlooked material
allegations and controlling law regarding the ongoing nature of the
enterprise and the real threat of continued racketeering activity.' Doc. No.
31 at p. 20. Specifically, Plaintiff argues the Court failed to consider 'that the
enterprise's broader objective-fraudulent disposition of property and rights
through the divorce-remains unfulfilled, and that the divorce litigation is
ongoing' when determining that the Defendants' communications were
unrelated to the initial scheme and that the communications did not support
an open-ended threat of continuing criminal conduct. Id. at pp. 4-7. Plaintiff
further argues that reconsideration is warranted 'to prevent manifest
injustice.' Id. at p. 10.
Summary
The Plaintiff believes the court overlooked the ongoing nature of the
enterprise and the threat of continued racketeering activity. The Plaintiff
argues that the enterprise's broader objective, which includes the fraudulent
disposition of property through ongoing divorce litigation, was not
adequately considered by the court. This suggests that the Plaintiff believes
the court failed to recognize the continuity of the alleged racketeering
activity.

In H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106
L.Ed.2d 195 (1989), the Supreme Court reiterated the well-established
concept that racketeering acts form a 'pattern' in RICO where they exhibit
'continuity plus relationship.' Id. at 239, 109 S.Ct. at 2900. The 'relationship'
requirement is satisfied when the racketeering acts have 'the same or
similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of commission, or
otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not
isolated events.' Id. at 240, 109 S.Ct. at 2901 (citing Sedima, 473 U.S. at 496
n. 14, 105 S.Ct. at 3285 n. 14). With respect to the 'continuity' requirement,
the Supreme Court stated that the predicate acts must amount to, or pose a
threat of, continuing racketeering activity. Id. According to the Supreme
Court, continuity 'is both a closed- and open-ended concept, referring to a
closed period of repeated conduct, or to past conduct that by its nature
projects into the future with a threat of repetition.' Id. A RICO plaintiff 'may
demonstrate continuity over a closed period by proving a series of related
predicates extending over a substantial period of time.' Id. Predicates
extending over merely a few weeks or months, on the other hand, may
satisfy the continuity element if there is a threat of repetition in the future.
This latter concept of continuity, which occurs over an 'open period,' is
established by showing that the predicate acts are a 'regular way of
conducting the enterprise's ongoing business.'
Summary
The passage explains the "continuity plus relationship" test for establishing
a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO. It clarifies that continuity can
be either closed-ended (a series of related predicates over a substantial
period) or open-ended (a threat of future repetition). The passage suggests
that even predicates over a short period can satisfy continuity if they pose a
threat of future repetition. This interpretation is generally applicable to
RICO cases and provides guidance on how to establish a pattern of
racketeering activity.
Skurkey v. Daniel
U.S. District Court — Western District of Oklahoma
Extract
Courts have uniformly and consistently held that schemes involving a single,
narrow purpose and one or few participants directed towards a single victim
do not satisfy the RICO requirement of a closed or open pattern of
continuity.

Summary
The court in Skurkey v. Daniel emphasized that RICO claims require more
than a single, narrow scheme directed at one victim. The court noted that
such schemes do not meet the continuity requirement for a RICO pattern,
which requires either a closed period of repeated conduct or a threat of
continued criminal activity. This aligns with the Tenth Circuit's
interpretation that RICO targets long-term racketeering conduct, requiring
a series of related acts over a substantial period or a threat of future
criminal conduct.
Condict v. Condict, 815 F.2d 579 (10th Cir. 1987)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
A scheme to achieve a single discrete objective does not in and of itself
create a threat of ongoing activity, even when that goal is pursued by
multiple illegal acts, because the scheme ends when the purpose is
accomplished. Courts that have considered a RICO claim grounded on this
type of scheme have therefore required some additional evidence showing
that the scheme was not an isolated occurrence. See, e.g., Lipin Enters. Inc.
v. Lee, 803 F.2d 322, 324 (7th Cir.1986) (acts to defraud one victim one time
insufficient in absence of showing of other victims or other frauds).
Summary
For a RICO claim to be valid, there must be a pattern of racketeering
activity that shows continuity. A single scheme aimed at a discrete objective,
even if pursued through multiple illegal acts, does not meet this requirement
unless there is evidence of ongoing or repeated criminal activity. The judge
in the dismissal likely focused on the lack of continuity in the alleged
scheme, as it was directed at a single victim with a specific goal that was
achieved in a short period.
UMB Bank v. Monson, 21-CV-2504-EFM (D. Kan. Jun 04, 2025)
U.S. District Court — District of Kansas
Extract
To state a RICO claim, a plaintiff must set forth four elements: (1) conduct
(2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity...
Racketeering activity is frequently described as 'predicate acts' which
consist of the federal and state crimes identified in 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1)... To
state a 'pattern' of racketeering activity, the plaintiff must allege 'at least
two acts of racketeering activity... which occurred within ten years.'

=== PAGE 37 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Moreover, 'a RICO pattern requires that the racketeering predicates relate
to each other and amount to a threat of continued racketeering activity. No
pattern exists without this ‘continuity plus relationship.'... Without a threat
of continued illegal activity, a single scheme rarely supports finding
continuity. And a single scheme even less likely supports a continuity finding
when the scheme targets only one discrete goal.'
Summary
Necessity of demonstrating a pattern of racketeering activity, which requires
related predicate acts and continuity. The judge in the Myers case found that
the alleged scheme did not demonstrate continuity, as it was a single scheme
with a discrete goal and limited duration. The passage supports this
reasoning by emphasizing that a single scheme targeting one goal rarely
meets the continuity requirement.
Suddath v. Oklahome Homebuilders, LLC, CIV-24-745-SLP (W.D. Okla. Nov

U.S. District Court — Western District of Oklahoma
Extract
RICO provides a civil cause of action for treble damages to anyone injured
“by reason of” certain racketeering activity. 18 U.S.C. §§ 1964(c), 1962. “To
plead a valid RICO claim, a plaintiff must plausibly allege that a defendant
(1) conducted the affairs (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of
racketeering activity.” Johnson v. Heath, 56 F.4th 851, 858 (10th Cir. 2022)
(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Defendants challenge, inter
alia, the sufficiency of Plaintiffs' allegations with respect to the third element
- a “pattern” of racketeering activity. “A ‘pattern’ requires at least two
predicate acts.” Bixler v. Foster, 596 F.3d 751, 761 (10th Cir. 2010) (citing 18
U.S.C. § 1961(5)). And those predicate acts themselves must amount to or
otherwise constitute a threat of continuing racketeering activity. Id. This
continuity requirement expresses congressional intent that “RICO reach
activities that amount to or threaten long-term criminal activity.” Id. (citing
H.J., Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tele. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 243 n. 4 (1989)).
Summary
Requirements for establishing a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO,
which includes demonstrating at least two predicate acts that amount to or
constitute a threat of continuing racketeering activity. The passage
emphasizes the need for continuity, which can be either closed-ended or
open-ended, and highlights that RICO is intended to address long-term
criminal activity.

U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
A violation of section 1962(c) thus 'requires (1) conduct (2) of an enterprise
(3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity.' Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex
Co., 473 U.S. 479, 105 S.Ct. 3275, 3285, 87 L.Ed.2d 346 (1985). RICO
defines racketeering activity as, inter alia, any act that is indictable under
18 U.S.C. Sec. 1341 (mail fraud) or 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1343 (wire fraud). See 18
U.S.C. Sec. 1961(1)(B). RICO also states that a ' "pattern of racketeering
activity" requires at least two acts of racketeering activity.' 18 U.S.C. Sec.
1961(5). ... [T]o establish a RICO pattern, a plaintiff must also demonstrate
continuity, that is, 'the threat of continuing activity.' Sedima, 105 S.Ct. at
3285 n. 14. This element is derived from RICO's legislative history, which
indicates that RICO does not apply to 'sporadic activity' or to the 'isolated
offender'. Id. ... A scheme to achieve a single discrete objective does not in
and of itself create a threat of ongoing activity, even when that goal is
pursued by multiple illegal acts, because the scheme ends when the purpose
is accomplished.
Summary
To establish a RICO pattern, a plaintiff must demonstrate continuity, which
involves showing a threat of ongoing illegal activity. A single scheme with a
discrete objective, even if pursued through multiple illegal acts, does not
satisfy the continuity requirement if the scheme ends once the objective is
achieved. This is relevant to the judge's decision because the judge found
that the alleged scheme had a single discrete objective that was achieved
within a short period, thus lacking the necessary continuity for a RICO
pattern.
Edwards v. First Nat. Bank, Bartlesville, Oklahoma, 872 F.2d 347 (10th Cir.

objective, even if pursued through multiple illegal acts, does not satisfy the
continuity requirement unless there is additional evidence showing that the
scheme was not isolated. This aligns with the judge's reasoning in the
dismissal, where the court found that the alleged scheme was directed at a
single victim with a single goal, and thus did not demonstrate the necessary
continuity for a RICO claim.

Extract
More difficult to establish-and more problematic for Plaintiffs-is the
requirement that the predicate acts have sufficient 'continuity' to constitute
a RICO 'pattern.' See Bixler v. Foster, 596 F.3d 751, 761 (10th Cir. 2010)
(indicating that the continuity requirement 'is more difficult to
meet' (citation and quotation marks omitted)). For RICO purposes,
continuity comes in one of two forms: Closed-ended continuity can be
established by alleging a 'closed period of repeated racketeering conduct.'
Johnson, 56 F.4th at 859-60 (citing H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 241-43). Open-ended
continuity can be established by racketeering acts that 'involved implicit or
explicit threats of repetition,' 'formed the operations of an association that
exists for criminal purposes,' or were part of the defendants' 'regular way of
conducting a legitimate enterprise.'
Summary
The passage provides insight into the continuity requirement for a RICO
pattern, which is a critical element in establishing a RICO claim. It explains
the two forms of continuity: closed-ended and open-ended, and what is
required to establish each. This is relevant to the Plaintiff's case, as the
judge dismissed the claim for failing to establish a pattern of racketeering
activity, particularly the continuity aspect.

Extract
In Sedima, at p. 3285, note 14, the Supreme Court commented as follows: ...
In this case, the court and the parties assumed for purposes of the court's
ruling that defendants engaged in numerous racketeering acts. It is clear
that when, as here, the acts are part of a common fraudulent scheme, they
satisfy the relationship requirement of Sedima. See, e.g., Superior Oil Co. v.
Fulmer, 785 F.2d 252 (8th Cir.1986). However, to establish a RICO pattern, a
plaintiff must also demonstrate continuity, that is, 'the threat of continuing

activity.' Sedima, 105 S.Ct. at 3285 n. 14. This element is derived from
RICO's legislative history, which indicates that RICO does not apply to
'sporadic activity' or to the 'isolated offender'. Id.
Summary
To establish a RICO pattern, a plaintiff must demonstrate both the
relationship and continuity of the predicate acts. The continuity requirement
involves showing a threat of ongoing criminal activity, which is not satisfied
by isolated or sporadic acts. This interpretation is generally applicable to
RICO cases.

Extract
The Tenth Circuit has explained '[t]he relationship test is not a cumbersome
one for a RICO plaintiff.' Boone v. Carlsbad Bancorporation, Inc., 972 F.2d
1545, 1555 (10th Cir. 1992) (internal quotations omitted). Plaintiffs have
alleged the predicate acts have the same purpose, results, participants,
victims, and methods of commission; therefore, the relationship test is
satisfied. Id. The continuity requirement is more difficult to meet. Id.
Continuity may be either open-ended or close-ended. H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at
241. The court focuses its inquiry on close-ended continuity. Close-ended
continuity may be asserted by plausibly alleging 'a series of related
predicates extending over a substantial period of time.' H. J. Inc., 492 U.S. at
242. It is not necessary to show a threat of future repetition for close-ended
continuity. Johnson v. Heath, 56 F.4th 851, 860 (10th Cir. 2022). There are
two elements the court considers: (1) the duration of the related acts, and
(2) the extensiveness of the RICO enterprise scheme. Id.
Summary
The relationship test for RICO is not cumbersome and can be satisfied if the
predicate acts share the same purpose, results, participants, victims, and
methods. The continuity requirement, however, is more stringent and can be
either open-ended or close-ended. For close-ended continuity, it is sufficient
to allege a series of related predicates over a substantial period, without
needing to show a threat of future repetition. The court considers the
duration and extensiveness of the scheme.

Extract
To have standing for a civil cause of action under RICO, a plaintiff must
show: (i) a violation of [section][section] 1962(a), (b), (c), or (d); (ii) injury to
her business or property; and (iii) that the violation caused the injury. ...
Moreover, a plaintiff must prove that the defendant's violation of [section]
1962 was the proximate cause of the plaintiff's injury to have standing for a
civil RICO action.
Summary
For a civil RICO claim, the plaintiff must demonstrate a violation of RICO
provisions, an injury to business or property, and a causal link between the
violation and the injury. The judge's dismissal may have overlooked whether
the Plaintiff adequately alleged these elements, particularly the causal
connection between the alleged racketeering activity and the injury.

Extract
In H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co., (45) the Court held that the
government must establish both a relationship between the predicate acts
and continuity of those acts to prove a 'pattern of racketeering activity' for
RICO purposes. (46) These requirements, referred to as the 'continuity plus
relationship' test, (47) must be proven independently, but the Court has
recognized that evidence establishing the two elements will often overlap.

Summary
To establish a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO, a plaintiff must
demonstrate both a relationship between the predicate acts and continuity
of those acts. The "continuity plus relationship" test is essential for proving a
RICO violation, and evidence for these elements can often overlap. This is a
critical aspect of RICO claims and is applicable to any case involving
allegations of racketeering activity.

To prosecute a defendant under RICO, the government must prove that the
defendant: (i) through the commission of two or more acts constituting a
pattern of racketeering activity; (ii) directly or indirectly invested in,
maintained an interest in, or participated in, an enterprise; (iii) the activities
of which affected interstate or foreign commerce. ... The Supreme Court has
stated that a 'pattern of racketeering' can only be established if the
predicate acts are continuous and interrelated. ... In H.J. Inc. v.
Northwestern Bell Telephone Co., the Court held that the government must
establish both a relationship between the predicate acts and continuity of
those acts to prove a 'pattern of racketeering activity' for RICO purposes.
Summary
Requirements for establishing a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO,
emphasizing the need for continuity and interrelatedness of predicate acts.
The judge dismissed the case due to a lack of continuity and relatedness in
the alleged racketeering activities. However, the Plaintiff could argue on
appeal that the judge misapplied the continuity and relatedness standards,
as the alleged acts were part of a single scheme with a common purpose,
participants, and methods, and that the scheme's duration and impact on the
Plaintiff's business demonstrate continuity.

Extract
RICO applies only where the commission of two predicate acts constitutes a
'pattern of racketeering activity.' (43) While the statutory definition of
'pattern of racketeering activity' requires at least two acts of racketeering
occurring within ten years of each other, (44) simply proving two acts may
not be sufficient to establish a RICO violation. (45) The Supreme Court has
stated that a 'pattern of racketeering' can only be established if the
predicate acts are continuous and interrelated. (46) Thus, 'two isolated acts
of racketeering do not constitute a pattern.' (47)
Summary
To establish a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO, the predicate
acts must be continuous and interrelated. Simply proving two acts is not
sufficient; they must form a pattern that poses a continuous threat of
engaging in racketeering activities. The judge dismissed the Plaintiff's claim
because the alleged acts did not demonstrate continuity or a threat of
ongoing criminal activity, which is consistent with the requirement that the
acts must be part of a continuous and interrelated pattern.

Chapter 4. Elements of Cause of Action
Civil RICO: A Definitive Guide. Fifth Edition - American Bar
Association - Gregory P. Joseph
Extract
The continuity requirement, according to Sedima, consists of a 'threat of
continuing activity.' The Court defined the relationship requirement in terms
of a now repealed statute, 18 U.S.C. § 3575(e) (of the Dangerous Special
Offender Sentencing Act), which provided that 'criminal conduct forms a
pattern if it embraces criminal acts that have the same or similar purposes,
results, participants, victims, or methods of commission, or otherwise are
interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not isolated events.'
Summary
The continuity requirement for a RICO claim involves a "threat of continuing
activity," and the relationship requirement involves criminal acts that are
interrelated by similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods.
The passage suggests that the judge may have erred in dismissing the claim
if the Plaintiff adequately alleged a pattern of racketeering activity that
meets these requirements.

The Brief - American Bar Association - 2024-01-01
Extract
A violation of § 1962(c), the section on which Sedima relies, requires (1)
conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity. The plaintiff must allege each of the elements to state a claim. They
are all equally essential components, and the complaint will fail if any one of
them is not adequately pleaded. In particular, RICO claims based on mail or
wire fraud must comport with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b)’s
requirement that allegations involving fraud be pleaded with particularity.
Summary
The passage highlights the necessity of pleading each element of a RICO
claim with particularity, especially when fraud is involved. This is relevant to
the judge's dismissal of the Plaintiff's claim for failing to establish a pattern
of racketeering activity. The passage suggests that the Plaintiff must clearly
demonstrate the relatedness and continuity of the predicate acts to establish
a pattern.

RICO: A Primer
Extract
The racketeering acts need not be similar or directly related to each other;
rather, it is sufficient that the racketeering acts are related in some way to
the affairs of the charged enterprise, including, for example, that: the
racketeering acts furthered the goals of or benefitted the enterprise, the
enterprise or the defendant's role in the enterprise enabled the defendant to
commit, or facilitated the commission of, the racketeering acts, the
racketeering acts were committed at the behest of, or on behalf of, the
enterprise, or the racketeering acts had the same or similar purposes,
results, participants, victims or methods of commission.
Summary
For racketeering acts to be considered related under RICO, they do not need
to be similar or directly related to each other. Instead, it is sufficient if they
are related in some way to the affairs of the charged enterprise, such as
furthering the goals of the enterprise or being committed on behalf of the
enterprise. This suggests that the judge may have erred in dismissing the
Plaintiff's RICO claim by requiring a more direct relationship between the
predicate acts than what is necessary under RICO.

Summary
The racketeering acts in a RICO claim do not need to be identical or directly
related to each other. Instead, they must be related to the affairs of the
enterprise, such as furthering its goals or being committed on its behalf.
This suggests that the judge may have erred in dismissing the Plaintiff's
claim by requiring a more direct relationship between the acts than RICO
necessitates. The Plaintiff should argue on appeal that the alleged acts,
while distinct in time and nature, were all part of a broader scheme to
defraud him and further the enterprise's goals, thus satisfying the
relatedness requirement.
