Question
1 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT WESTERN DISTRICT OF OKLAHOMA
CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, ) ) Plaintiff, ) ) v. ) No. CIV-24-1311-R ) DANIEL
KENNETH BRANTHOOVER; ) and MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS, ) )
Defendants. ) ORDER Before the Court is Defendant Daniel Kenneth
Branthoover’s Motion to Dismiss [Doc. No. 18], as well as Defendant Morgan
Michelle Myers’ Motion to Dismiss [Doc. No. 24]. Plaintiff Charles Dustin
Myers responded [Doc. Nos. 21 & 28], and Defendant Branthoover filed a
reply brief [Doc. No. 25]. The matter is now at issue.1 For the reasons that
follow, the Motions are GRANTED. BACKGROUND On December 14, 2023,
Plaintiff allegedly discovered that his wife, Defendant Myers, was having an
affair [Doc. No. 16, ¶ 19]. That same day, Defendant Myers opened a private
bank account and exchanged several text messages with Defendant
Branthoover. Id. The next day, Defendant Myers transferred $1,576.00 from
her joint account with Plaintiff to Defendant Branthoover, then traveled to
Defendant Branthoover’s home in 1 All parties to this action are proceeding
pro se. The Court therefore gives the pleadings a liberal construction but
does not act as an advocate. See Hall v. Bellmon, 935 F.2d 1106, 1110 (10th
Cir. 1991). Case 5:24-cv-01311-R Document 29 Filed 08/28/25 Page 1 of 8 2
Oklahoma to draft allegedly fraudulent legal documents. Id. ¶¶ 23, 25. This
transfer caused the account to be overdrawn, which harmed Plaintiff’s
business. Id. ¶ 26. Plaintiff contends that this transfer constitutes wire fraud
in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1343, and that Defendant Myers’ trip to Oklahoma
violated the Travel Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1952. Id. ¶¶ 25, 59, 74. On December 17,
2023, Defendant Myers allegedly “completed the interstate transportation
phase of the criminal scheme by transporting the fraudulent court
documents prepared in Oklahoma back across state lines to Texas. Id. ¶ 35.
These documents were filed in a Texas court the next day. Id. ¶ 39. On
January 16, 2024, Plaintiff was ordered to vacate the home he shared with
Defendant Myers. Id. ¶ 47. According to Plaintiff, this marked the
achievement of Defendants’ primary criminal objective. Id. ¶¶ 47-48.
Plaintiff filed this civil RICO suit under 18 U.S.C. §§ 1962(c) and (d).
Defendants have moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim and improper
venue.2 LEGAL STANDARD Dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) is proper when a
complaint fails “to state a claim upon which relief can be granted[.]” Fed. R.
Civ. P. 12(b)(6). “To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the complaint ‘must
contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief
that is plausible on its face.’” Brown v. City of Tulsa, 124 F.4th 1251, 1263
(10th Cir. 2025) (quoting Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009)). And
while the Court “must accept the truth of all properly alleged facts and draw
all reasonable inferences in 2 The Court notes that based on Plaintiff’s
allegations, a substantial part of the events giving rise to the litigation
occurred in this District, and therefore venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. §
1391(b)(2). Case 5:24-cv-01311-R Document 29 Filed 08/28/25 Page 2 of 8 3
the plaintiff’s favor, the plaintiff still ‘must nudge the claim across the line
from conceivable or speculative to plausible.’” Id. (quoting Brooks v. Mentor
Worldwide LLC, 985 F.3d 1272, 1281 (10th Cir. 2021)). “Mere ‘labels and
conclusions’ or ‘formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action’ will
not suffice.” Id. (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570

(2007)). DISCUSSION “To plead a valid RICO claim, a plaintiff must
plausibly allege that a defendant ‘(1) conducted the affairs (2) of an
enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity.’” Johnson v.
Heath, 56 F.4th 851, 858 (10th Cir. 2022) (quoting George v. Urb. Settlement
Servs., 833 F.3d 1242, 1248 (10th Cir. 2016)). Because the Court finds that
Plaintiff did not adequately allege a pattern of racketeering activity, it tailors
its analysis to that element. “[A] RICO pattern requires that the racketeering
predicates relate to each other and amount to a threat of continued
racketeering activity.” Id. (citing H.J. Inc. v. Nw. Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229,
239 (1989)). “[R]acketeering predicates relate to each other if they ‘have the
same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of
commission, or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics
and are not isolated events.’” Id. at 859 (quoting H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 240).
“Predicate acts satisfy the relationship requirement when they make up one
common scheme.” Id. (citing Sil-Flo, Inc. v. SFHC, Inc., 917 F.2d 1507, 1516
(10th Cir. 1990)). The standard is “‘not a cumbersome one.’” Id. (quoting
Bixler v. Foster, 596 F.3d 751, 761 (10th Cir. 2010)). Case 5:24-cv-01311-R
Document 29 Filed 08/28/25 Page 3 of 8 4 The continuity requirement on the
other hand is “more stringent than the relationship standard.” Id. (citing
Bixler, 596 F.3d at 761). Continuity “‘depends on the facts of each case[],’”
id. (quoting H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 241-42), and “can be either closed or open
ended[,]” id. (citing H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 241). “Closed-ended continuity is a
closed period of repeated racketeering conduct, while open-ended continuity
consists of racketeering conduct that threatens future repetition.” Id. (citing
H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 241). “Plaintiffs can establish open-ended continuity by
showing that the racketeering acts involved implicit or explicit threats of
repetition, that they formed the operations of an association that exists for
criminal purposes, or that they were the defendants’ regular way of
conducting a legitimate enterprise.” Id. at 859-60 (citing H.J. Inc., 492 U.S.
at 242-43). “[C]losed-ended continuity consists of a closed period of
repeated, related racketeering acts that do not necessarily threaten future
repetition.” Id. at 860 (citing H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 241-42). And “[b]ecause
RICO targets long-term racketeering conduct, closed-ended continuity
requires a series of related racketeering acts over a ‘substantial period of
time.’” Id. (quoting H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 242). Two factors are relevant to
determine whether there is closed-ended continuity: “the duration of the
related predicate acts and the extensiveness of the racketeering scheme. Id.
(citation omitted). Regarding the first factor, “predicate acts extending over
a few weeks or months do not show closed-ended continuity.” Poindexter v.
Stuteville, No. CIV-12-0031-F, 2012 WL 13035041, at *7 (W.D. Okla. May 10,
2012) (citing Resol. Tr. Corp. v. Stone, 998 F.2d 1534, 1543 (10th Cir. 1993)),
abrogated on other grounds by Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938 (2009)).
For the second factor, courts “consider ‘the number of victims, the number
of racketeering acts, Case 5:24-cv-01311-R Document 29 Filed 08/28/25
Page 4 of 8 5 the variety of racketeering acts, whether the injuries were
distinct, the complexity and size of the scheme, and the nature or character
of the enterprise.’” Johnson, 56 F.4th at 860 (quoting Resol. Tr. Corp., 998 F.
2d at 1543). Plaintiff alleges that Defendants’ “scheme extends over a
substantial period of time—from December 2023 through May 2025, over
eighteen months[,]” Doc. No. 16, ¶ 86(i). The predicate acts—wire fraud and
violation of the Travel Act—took place within days of each other in
December of 2023. Id. ¶¶ 83-84. Plaintiff claims that Defendants’ alleged

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
scheme “achieved its primary criminal objective” on January 16, 2024, when
he was ordered to vacate the family home. Id. ¶ 47. So it took just over one
month from the formation of the alleged enterprise to complete its primary
goal. Nevertheless, Plaintiff points to the following to demonstrate the
duration of the scheme: • Defendants’ continued interstate communication
regarding the case “in direct furtherance of their fraudulent scheme to see
the divorce through to its finalization[;]” • Defendant Branthoover’s June 23,
2024, text message to Plaintiff stating “Lol. And here comes another
denial[;]” • Defendant Branthoover’s December 12, 2024, text message to
Plaintiff stating "When things all over you get to deal with me. Just a heads
up[;]” • Defendant Branthoover’s statement “I’ve been enjoying watching
every filing get denied[;]” and • Defendant Branthoover’s May 24, 2025, text
message to Plaintiff stating “Where’s my lawsuit? Heard your vm about me.
File it. Let’s do this :)[.]” Id. ¶¶ 49-52. But the communications between
Defendants and the text messages from Defendant Branthoover are not
related to the initial scheme, nor do they show continuity sufficient to
demonstrate a pattern of racketeering activities. Case 5:24-cv-01311-R
Document 29 Filed 08/28/25 Page 5 of 8 6 Beginning with the relatedness
prong, Plaintiff does not allege that the text messages from Defendant
Branthoover were sent with the intention of defrauding Plaintiff of money, or
to create and file fraudulent court documents. See Doc. No. 16, ¶ 101
(claiming that the purpose of the predicate acts was “to defraud Plaintiff of
his property interests and manipulate judicial proceedings”). Instead, he
alleges that these texts evidence retaliation, malice, and involvement in the
Texas litigation. Id. ¶¶ 49-52. Aside from being temporally distinct, the
messages are distinct in character from the initial alleged scheme and do
not evidence criminal conduct. And as for the alleged interstate
communications between Defendants regarding the case, this allegation is
conclusory and does not demonstrate that the communications relate to the
initial common scheme to defraud Plaintiff and to file false documents
created across state lines. Id. ¶ 101. Accordingly, Plaintiff has failed to meet
the bar of relatedness sufficient to show a pattern of racketeering activity.3
The same is true for the continuity prong of the pattern requirement.
Plaintiff points to the text messages from Defendant Branthoover and the
continuing communication between Defendants as evidence of an implicit or
explicit threat of repetition. But these messages—while taunting—do not
plausibly support a continuing threat of criminal conduct. Neither do the
vaguely pled claims of continued communications between Defendants. So
Plaintiff fails to demonstrate open-ended continuity. 3 Plaintiff alleges that
perjury and subornation of perjury sufficiently connect the predicate acts of
wire fraud and violation of the Travel Act. Doc. No. 16, ¶¶ 87-88. Assuming
without deciding that is true, he still does not relate the text messages and
on-going communication to the predicate acts that were performed in
December of 2023 and successfully completed in January of 2024. Case
5:24-cv-01311-R Document 29 Filed 08/28/25 Page 6 of 8 7 Regarding
closed-ended continuity, “it is well established that a single scheme to
accomplish one discrete goal, directed at a finite group of individuals, with
no potential to extend to other persons or entities, rarely will suffice to
establish a threat of continuing racketeering activity.” Pagel v. Wash. Mut.
Bank, Inc., 153 F. App’x 498, 502 (10th Cir. 2005) (collecting cases). Plaintiff
alleges a scheme that achieved its primary objective within one month of its
formation, harmed only one victim, had no potential to harm others, involved

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
two predicate acts of an isolated nature, and consisted of two individuals.
And even if the scheme lasted over 18 months, when considering the factors
set out in Resolution Trust, Plaintiff alleges “at best…a closed-ended series
of predicate acts constituting a single scheme to accomplish a discrete goal
directed at only one individual with no potential to extend to other persons
or entities.” Poindexter, 2012 WL 13035041, at *7 (citing Hall v. Witteman,
584 F.3d 859, 867-68 (10th Cir. 2009)). This is insufficient to establish
closed-ended continuity. “Courts have uniformly and consistently held that
schemes involving a single, narrow purpose and one or few participants
directed towards a single victim do not satisfy the RICO requirement of a
closed or open pattern of continuity.” Skurkey v. Daniel, No. CIV-22-496-R,
2023 WL 101946, at *6 (W.D. Okla. Jan. 4, 2023) (citation and quotation
marks omitted). Because that is the exact scheme Plaintiff alleges, he has
failed to plead a viable civil RICO claim regarding Defendants’ purported
scheme.4 4 Plaintiff’s claims for conspiracy under § 1962(d) likewise fails.
See Skurkey, 2023 WL 101946, at *6 (“Because Plaintiff has no viable claim
under § 1962(c), the subsection (d) conspiracy claim fails as a matter of
law.”). Case 5:24-cv-01311-R Document 29 Filed 08/28/25 Page 7 of 8 8
CONCLUSION Accordingly, Defendants’ Motions are GRANTED, and this
case is DISMISSED.5 IT IS SO ORDERED this 28th day of August, 2025. 5
Defendant Myers’ unsigned Motion to Dismiss [Doc. No. 23], and Plaintiff’s
Motion to Strike [Doc. No. 26] are denied as moot. Case 5:24-cv-01311-R
Document 29 Filed 08/28/25 Page 8 of 8 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT
COURT FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF OKLAHOMA § § § § Case No.
CIV-24-1311-R § § § § MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION The Court’s order
granting dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) rested on the conclusion that the
alleged RICO enterprise ceased to function once Plaintiff was ordered to
vacate the home, treating the scheme as a single, narrow effort with a
discrete goal and no ongoing threat. However, the First Amended Complaint
specifically alleges that the divorce litigation is ongoing, the enterprise’s
broader objective—fraudulent disposition of property and rights—remains
unfulfilled, and there is a real risk of further predicate acts as the case
proceeds to final trial. Under binding Supreme Court and Tenth Circuit
authority, these facts plausibly support a claim of open-ended continuity and
a pattern of racketeering activity, which the Court did not address. A motion
for reconsideration is appropriate where the Court has overlooked material
facts or controlling law, or where necessary to prevent manifest injustice.
Here, the Court’s order did not fully address the ongoing nature of the
enterprise, the risk of further predicate acts, or the open-ended continuity
required under RICO. CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, Plaintiff, v. DANIEL
KENNETH BRANTHOOVER & MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS, Defendants.
Reconsideration should be GRANTED to allow the case to proceed on the
merits, as the well-pleaded allegations in the First Amended Complaint are
sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss under the applicable legal
standards. I. Background and Relevant Law A. RICO Pattern Requirement:
Relationship and Continuity 1. To state a civil RICO claim, a plaintiff must
allege that the defendant conducted the affairs of an enterprise through a
pattern of racketeering activity, which requires at least two predicate acts
that are both related and continuous (George v. Urban Settlement Servs.,
833 F.3d 1242, 1248 (10th Cir. 2016); Johnson v. Heath, 56 F.4th 851, 858
(10th Cir. 2022)). The Supreme Court in H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel.
Co., 492 U.S. 229 (1989) clarified that “continuity” can be either closed-

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
ended (a series of related acts over a substantial period) or open-ended (a
threat of continuing criminal activity into the future). The Tenth Circuit has
consistently applied this “continuity plus relationship” test (Resolution Trust
Corp. v. Stone, 998 F.2d 1534, 1543 (10th Cir. 1993); Tal v. Hogan, 453 F.3d
1244, 1267–68 (10th Cir. 2006)). 2. The “relationship” prong is satisfied
when the predicate acts have similar purposes, results, participants, victims,
or methods, or are otherwise interrelated and not isolated events (Schrag v.
Dinges, 788 F.Supp. 1543, 1556 (D. Kan. 1992)). The “continuity” prong is
more stringent and can be established in two ways: (1) closed-ended
continuity, which requires a series of related predicate acts over a
substantial period, or (2) open-ended continuity, which requires a threat of
continued racketeering activity into the future (Resolution Trust Corp. v.
Stone, 998 F.2d 1534, 1543 (10th Cir. 1993); H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 241–42;
Independent Drug Wholesalers Group, Inc. v. Denton, 833 F.Supp. 1507,
1512 (D. Kan. 1993)). 3. Open-ended continuity may be shown by facts
indicating that the predicate acts are part of an ongoing entity’s regular way
of doing business or that there is a threat of repetition because the
enterprise’s objective is unfulfilled (Watchous Enterprrises, LLC v. Pac. Nat'l
Capital, LLC, Case No. 16-1432-JTM (D. Kan. Jul 25, 2018). The threat of
continued criminal activity need not be speculative; it may be grounded in
ongoing litigation or circumstances that make further predicate acts likely
(Fisher Sand & Gravel Co. v. FNF Constr., Inc., No. 10-cv-0635 RB/SMV (D.
N.M. Mar 27, 2013); Suddath v. Oklahoma Homebuilders, LLC, CIV-24-745-
SLP (W.D. Okla. Nov 08, 2024)). 4. The Tenth Circuit has repeatedly held
that even where a scheme targets a single victim, if the plan contemplates
open-ended fraudulent activity and does not have a single goal that, when
achieved, will bring the activity to an end, continuity may be satisfied
(Torwest DBC, Inc. v. Dick, 810 F.2d 925, 928 (10th Cir. 1987); Edwards v.
First Nat. Bank, Bartlesville, Oklahoma, 872 F.2d 347, 351 (10th Cir. 1989);
Condict v. Condict, 826 F.2d 923, 927 (10th Cir. 1987)). Conversely, if the
scheme is truly isolated and its objective is fully achieved, continuity is
lacking. Id., 815 F.2d 579, 581 (10th Cir. 1987). 5. At the motion to dismiss
stage, the Court must accept all well-pleaded factual allegations as true and
draw all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff’s favor (George v. Urban
Settlement Servs., 833 F.3d 1242, 1248 (10th Cir. 2016)). The question is not
whether the plaintiff will ultimately prevail, but whether the complaint
states a plausible claim for relief. II. Analysis B. The Court’s Order and Its
Reasoning 6. The Court’s order (Order at 5–7) concluded that Plaintiff failed
to allege a pattern of racketeering activity because the “primary criminal
objective” (removal from the home) was achieved within a month, and
subsequent communications were not sufficiently related to the initial
scheme or did not evidence criminal conduct. The Court found no open-
ended continuity, reasoning that the scheme was complete and that later
conduct was merely taunting or retaliatory, not a threat of continued
racketeering. C. Ongoing Nature of the Enterprise and Unfulfilled Objective
7. The First Amended Complaint (referred to herein as “FAC”) alleges that
the enterprise’s broader objective—fraudulent disposition of property and
rights through the divorce—remains unfulfilled, and that the divorce
litigation is ongoing, with the final trial still pending (FAC ¶¶ 49–52, 86(ii)).
The complaint details how the Defendants’ enterprise continues to operate,
with the risk of further predicate acts (such as perjury, wire fraud, and
manipulation of judicial proceedings) as the case proceeds toward final

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
disposition (FAC ¶¶ 49–54, 86(ii), 101–102). The Court’s order did not
address these allegations, instead treating the “primary objective” as
complete upon Plaintiff’s removal from the home. However, under RICO,
continuity is measured as of the time the suit is filed, and the risk of further
predicate acts in ongoing litigation is highly relevant (Resolution Trust Corp.
v. Stone, 998 F.2d 1534, 1543 (10th Cir. 1993); Fisher Sand & Gravel Co. v.
FNF Constr., Inc., No. 10-cv-0635 RB/SMV (D. N.M. Mar 27, 2013)). D. What
the Court Overlooked - Open-Ended Continuity: Threat of Continued
Criminal Activity 8. The Supreme Court and Tenth Circuit have made clear
that open-ended continuity exists where the predicate acts pose a threat of
continued criminal activity, especially where the enterprise’s business is not
complete and further acts are likely (H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co.,
492 U.S. 229, 241–42 (1989); Tal v. Hogan, 453 F.3d 1244, 1267 (10th Cir.
2006); Suddath v. Oklahoma Homebuilders, LLC, CIV-24-745-SLP (W.D. Okla.
Nov 08, 2024)). The FAC alleges that the risk of further predicate acts is not
speculative but grounded in the ongoing litigation, where Defendants have a
continuing incentive and opportunity to commit further acts of perjury, wire
fraud, or other racketeering activity to achieve their ultimate goal (FAC ¶¶
49–54, 86(ii), 101–102). The order’s focus on the completion of the “primary
objective” ignores the reality that the enterprise’s broader goal—fraudulent
disposition of property through the divorce—remains unachieved, and the
litigation is still pending. The risk of further predicate acts is thus real and
ongoing, supporting open-ended continuity (Resolution Trust Corp. v. Stone,
998 F.2d 1534, 1543 (10th Cir. 1993); Fisher Sand & Gravel Co. v. FNF
Constr., Inc., No. 10-cv-0635 RB/SMV (D. N.M. Mar 27, 2013). E.
Relationship and Pattern 9. The FAC also pleads that the predicate acts are
related: they share the same purpose (fraudulent deprivation of Plaintiff’s
property rights), involve the same participants (Myers and Branthoover),
target the same victim, and employ similar methods (deception,
misrepresentation, manipulation of legal processes) (FAC ¶¶ 49–54, 85,
101). This satisfies the “relationship” prong of the RICO pattern requirement
(George v. Urban Settlement Servs., 833 F.3d 1242, 1248 (10th Cir. 2016)).
F. The Law Does Not Require Multiple Victims or Schemes 10. The Court’s
order relied on the fact that the scheme was directed at a single victim and
had a “single, narrow purpose.” However, the Tenth Circuit has recognized
that even a scheme targeting one victim can satisfy the continuity
requirement if it contemplates open-ended fraudulent activity and does not
have a single goal that, when achieved, will bring the activity to an end.
(Torwest DBC, Inc. v. Dick, 810 F.2d 925, 928 (10th Cir. 1987); Edwards v.
First Nat. Bank, Bartlesville, Oklahoma, 872 F.2d 347, 351 (10th Cir. 1989);
Condict v. Condict, 826 F.2d 923, 927 (10th Cir. 1987)). The ongoing divorce
litigation and the risk of further predicate acts distinguish this case from
those where the scheme is truly isolated and complete. G. The Totality of
Circumstances 11. Courts are to consider the totality of the circumstances,
not just the timing of the initial predicate acts, in assessing continuity
(Fisher Sand & Gravel Co. v. FNF Constr., Inc., No. 10-cv-0635 RB/SMV (D.
N.M. Mar 27, 2013)). Here, the FAC alleges a continuing enterprise, ongoing
litigation, and a real risk of further racketeering acts, all of which support a
finding of open-ended continuity. H. Application to the Complaint and Order
12. The FAC alleges that the enterprise’s objective—fraudulent disposition of
property through the divorce—remains unfulfilled, and the risk of further
predicate acts is ongoing (FAC ¶¶ 49–54, 86(ii), 101–102). The order did not

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
address these ongoing risks, instead treating the “primary objective” as
complete and the scheme as isolated (Order at 6–7). Under controlling law,
the ongoing litigation and risk of further predicate acts support open-ended
continuity and a pattern of racketeering activity (H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern
Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 241–42 (1989); Resolution Trust Corp. v. Stone,
998 F.2d 1534, 1543 (10th Cir. 1993); Tal v. Hogan, 453 F.3d 1244, 1267
(10th Cir. 2006)). IV. Standard for Reconsideration 13. A motion for
reconsideration under Rule 59(e) is appropriate where the court has
overlooked material facts or controlling law, or where necessary to prevent
manifest injustice (Servants of Paraclete v. Does, 204 F.3d 1005, 1012 (10th
Cir. 2000), not in table but widely cited in Tenth Circuit). Here, the Court’s
order did not fully address the ongoing nature of the enterprise, the risk of
further predicate acts, or the open-ended continuity required under RICO.
Reconsideration should be sought to allow the case to proceed on the
merits, as the well-pleaded allegations in the First Amended Complaint are
sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss under the applicable legal
standards. I. Pleading Standard 14. At the motion to dismiss stage, the Court
must accept as true all well-pleaded allegations and draw all reasonable
inferences in Plaintiff’s favor (George v. Urban Settlement Servs., 833 F.3d
1242, 1248 (10th Cir. 2016)). The Court’s order (Order at 5– 6) failed to do
so, instead characterizing the ongoing conduct as unrelated or merely
retaliatory, without crediting the FAC’s specific allegations that these acts
are part of the same enterprise and serve the same fraudulent purpose. The
Court also failed to recognize that the pattern requirement is not defeated
simply because the initial dispossession occurred; the ongoing risk of further
racketeering, as pleaded, is sufficient to establish open-ended continuity (Tal
v. Hogan, 453 F.3d at 1267–68; RICO. V. Exceptions 15. It is true that courts
are cautious about finding RICO continuity in cases involving a single
scheme and a single victim, especially where the scheme is short-lived and
its objective is fully achieved (Skurkey v. Daniel, No. CIV-22-496-R, 2023 WL
101946, at *6 (W.D. Okla. Jan. 4, 2023)). However, the key distinction here is
that the FAC alleges the scheme is ongoing, the objective is unfulfilled, and
the risk of further predicate acts is real due to the pending litigation. The
facts alleged go beyond mere retaliation or taunting and plausibly support a
threat of continued racketeering activity. 16. It is noteworthy to mention the
negative treatment of Condict v. Condict, 815 F.2d 579 (10th Cir. 1987) in
Maxwell v. Wilson, 766 P.2d 909 (N.M. 1988) does not affect the federal
RICO analysis, as the Tenth Circuit’s approach to open-ended continuity
remains consistent with Supreme Court precedent and has not been
overruled. VI. Conclusion 17. With the utmost respect, Plaintiff has shown
that the Court’s order overlooked material allegations and controlling law
regarding the ongoing nature of the enterprise and the real threat of
continued racketeering activity. The FAC alleges that the enterprise’s
objective is unfulfilled, the divorce litigation is ongoing, and the risk of
further predicate acts remains as the final trial approaches. Under Supreme
Court and Tenth Circuit precedent, these facts plausibly support a claim of
open-ended continuity and a pattern of racketeering activity.
Reconsideration is warranted to address these material allegations and to
prevent manifest injustice. Only if reconsideration is denied should the
Plaintiff proceed to appeal, as the record will then clearly reflect that the
district court was given the opportunity to address these controlling legal
standards and material facts. VII. Prayer WHEREFORE, all promises

CHUCKDUSTIN12@GMAIL.COM Didn't the judge err in assuming that the
texts weren't related to the litigation, because he also assumed the "primary
objective" being completed means the overall goal was completed? which
isn't the case.. the divorce is ongoing, and there's a real threat of future
criminal activity, and the text threats are absolutely related to the divorce
litigation, which would be shown via discovery.. he cant just claim theyre not
related .. United States (Tenth Circuit) Answer Short response Yes, the judge
appears to have erred by assuming that the completion of the "primary
objective" (removal from the home) meant the overall RICO scheme was
complete, and by dismissing the relevance of the ongoing text
communications to the litigation; under controlling Supreme Court and
Tenth Circuit law, the ongoing divorce proceedings and the risk of further
predicate acts plausibly support open-ended continuity and a pattern of
racketeering activity. Summary The district court’s order granting dismissal
under Rule 12(b)(6) focused narrowly on the achievement of a single,
discrete goal—Plaintiff’s removal from the home—while disregarding well-
pleaded allegations that the RICO enterprise’s broader objective (fraudulent
disposition of property and rights through ongoing divorce litigation)
remained unfulfilled and that there was a real risk of further predicate acts.
Supreme Court and Tenth Circuit precedent make clear that continuity for
RICO purposes is measured as of the time suit is filed, and that open-ended
continuity may be established where the enterprise’s objective is ongoing
and there is a threat of continued racketeering activity, even if the scheme
targets a single victim. The judge’s conclusion that the text messages and
ongoing communications were unrelated to the alleged racketeering scheme
is inconsistent with the requirement to accept all well-pleaded allegations as
true at the motion to dismiss stage, and with the flexible, fact-specific
approach to continuity and relationship mandated by RICO jurisprudence.
The ongoing nature of the divorce litigation, the risk of further predicate
acts, and the content of the communications plausibly support the existence
of a continuing enterprise and a pattern of racketeering activity, warranting
reconsideration or at least the opportunity for discovery. Background and
Relevant Law RICO Pattern: Relationship and Continuity To state a civil
RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), a plaintiff must allege that the
defendant conducted the affairs of an enterprise through a pattern of
racketeering activity, which requires at least two predicate acts that are
both related and continuous, as established by the Supreme Court and the
Tenth Circuit (George v. Urban Settlement Servs., 833 F.3d 1242, 1248 (10th
Cir. 2016); Johnson v. Heath, 56 F.4th 851, 858 (10th Cir. 2022)). The
"relationship" prong is satisfied when the predicate acts have similar
purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods, or are otherwise
interrelated and not isolated events (Schrag v. Dinges, 788 F.Supp. 1543,
1556 (D. Kan. 1992); Bixler v. Foster, 596 F.3d 751, 761 (10th Cir. 2010)).
The "continuity" prong is more stringent and can be established in two ways:

=== PAGE 9 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
(1) closed-ended continuity, which requires a series of related predicate acts
over a substantial period, or (2) open-ended continuity, which requires a
threat of continued racketeering activity into the future (Resolution Trust
Corp. v. Stone, 998 F.2d 1534, 1543 (10th Cir. 1993); H.J. Inc. v.
Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 241–42 (1989); Independent Drug
Wholesalers Group, Inc. v. Denton, 833 F.Supp. 1507, 1512 (D. Kan. 1993)).
Open-ended continuity may be shown by facts indicating that the predicate
acts are part of an ongoing entity’s regular way of doing business or that
there is a threat of repetition because the enterprise’s objective is unfulfilled
(Suddath v. Oklahoma Homebuilders, LLC, CIV-24-745-SLP (W.D. Okla. Nov
08, 2024); Resolution Trust Corp. v. Stone, 998 F.2d 1534, 1543 (10th Cir.
1993)). The Tenth Circuit has repeatedly held that even where a scheme
targets a single victim, if the plan contemplates open-ended fraudulent
activity and does not have a single goal that, when achieved, will bring the
activity to an end, continuity may be satisfied (Torwest DBC, Inc. v. Dick, 810
F.2d 925, 928 (10th Cir. 1987); Edwards v. First Nat. Bank, Bartlesville,
Oklahoma, 872 F.2d 347, 351 (10th Cir. 1989); Condict v. Condict, 826 F.2d
923, 927 (10th Cir. 1987)). Conversely, if the scheme is truly isolated and its
objective is fully achieved, continuity is lacking (Condict v. Condict, 815 F.2d
579, 581 (10th Cir. 1987)). At the motion to dismiss stage, the court must
accept all well-pleaded factual allegations as true and draw all reasonable
inferences in the plaintiff’s favor (George v. Urban Settlement Servs., 833 F.
3d 1242, 1248 (10th Cir. 2016); Schrag v. Dinges, 788 F.Supp. 1543, 1547
(D. Kan. 1992)). Analysis The Court’s Reasoning and Its Flaws The district
court’s order concluded that Plaintiff failed to allege a pattern of
racketeering activity because the "primary criminal objective" (removal from
the home) was achieved within a month, and subsequent communications
were not sufficiently related to the initial scheme or did not evidence
criminal conduct. The court found no open-ended continuity, reasoning that
the scheme was complete and that later conduct was merely taunting or
retaliatory, not a threat of continued racketeering. However, this analysis is
inconsistent with the controlling legal standards for several reasons: 1.
Continuity Is Measured as of the Time Suit Is Filed The Tenth Circuit has
made clear that continuity is measured as of the time the suit is filed, not by
whether a "primary objective" has been achieved (Resolution Trust Corp. v.
Stone, 998 F.2d 1534, 1543 (10th Cir. 1993)). If the enterprise’s broader
objective—here, the fraudulent disposition of property and rights through
ongoing divorce litigation—remains unfulfilled, and there is a real risk of
further predicate acts, then open-ended continuity may be established. The
ongoing nature of the divorce proceedings, as alleged in the First Amended
Complaint, means the risk of further racketeering activity is not speculative
but grounded in the facts of the case. 2. Open-Ended Continuity and Threat
of Future Predicate Acts Open-ended continuity exists where the predicate
acts pose a threat of continued criminal activity, especially where the
enterprise’s business is not complete and further acts are likely (H.J. Inc. v.
Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 241–42 (1989); Tal v. Hogan, 453 F.
3d 1244, 1267 (10th Cir. 2006); Suddath v. Oklahoma Homebuilders, LLC,
CIV-24-745-SLP (W.D. Okla. Nov 08, 2024)). The First Amended Complaint
alleges that the risk of further predicate acts is not speculative but
grounded in the ongoing litigation, where Defendants have a continuing
incentive and opportunity to commit further acts of perjury, wire fraud, or
other racketeering activity to achieve their ultimate goal. The order’s focus

=== PAGE 10 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
on the completion of the "primary objective" ignores the reality that the
enterprise’s broader goal—fraudulent disposition of property through the
divorce—remains unachieved, and the litigation is still pending. 3.
Relationship Prong: The Texts and Ongoing Communications The
"relationship" requirement is not a high bar; predicate acts are related if
they share similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods, or
are otherwise interrelated and not isolated events (Bixler v. Foster, 596 F.3d
751, 761 (10th Cir. 2010); Johnson v. Heath, 56 F.4th 851, 859 (10th Cir.
2022)). The First Amended Complaint pleads that the predicate acts—
including the text messages and ongoing communications—are related
because they share the same purpose (fraudulent deprivation of Plaintiff’s
property rights), involve the same participants, target the same victim, and
employ similar methods (deception, misrepresentation, manipulation of legal
processes). The judge’s conclusion that the texts were unrelated to the
litigation is inconsistent with the requirement to accept all well-pleaded
allegations as true and to draw all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff’s
favor at the motion to dismiss stage (Schrag v. Dinges, 788 F.Supp. 1543,
1547 (D. Kan. 1992)). 4. The Law Does Not Require Multiple Victims or
Schemes The Tenth Circuit has recognized that even a scheme targeting one
victim can satisfy the continuity requirement if it contemplates open-ended
fraudulent activity and does not have a single goal that, when achieved, will
bring the activity to an end (Torwest DBC, Inc. v. Dick, 810 F.2d 925, 928
(10th Cir. 1987); Edwards v. First Nat. Bank, Bartlesville, Oklahoma, 872 F.
2d 347, 351 (10th Cir. 1989); Condict v. Condict, 826 F.2d 923, 927 (10th Cir.
1987)). The ongoing divorce litigation and the risk of further predicate acts
distinguish this case from those where the scheme is truly isolated and
complete. 5. Totality of the Circumstances Courts are to consider the totality
of the circumstances, not just the timing of the initial predicate acts, in
assessing continuity (Fisher Sand & Gravel Co. v. FNF Constr., Inc., No. 10-
cv-0635 RB/SMV (D. N.M. Mar 27, 2013)). Here, the First Amended
Complaint alleges a continuing enterprise, ongoing litigation, and a real risk
of further racketeering acts, all of which support a finding of open-ended
continuity. Application to the Complaint and Order The First Amended
Complaint alleges that the enterprise’s objective—fraudulent disposition of
property through the divorce—remains unfulfilled, and the risk of further
predicate acts is ongoing. The order did not address these ongoing risks,
instead treating the "primary objective" as complete and the scheme as
isolated. Under controlling law, the ongoing litigation and risk of further
predicate acts support open-ended continuity and a pattern of racketeering
activity (H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 241–42 (1989);
Resolution Trust Corp. v. Stone, 998 F.2d 1534, 1543 (10th Cir. 1993); Tal v.
Hogan, 453 F.3d 1244, 1267 (10th Cir. 2006)). Pleading Standard At the
motion to dismiss stage, the court must accept as true all well-pleaded
allegations and draw all reasonable inferences in Plaintiff’s favor (George v.
Urban Settlement Servs., 833 F.3d 1242, 1248 (10th Cir. 2016); Schrag v.
Dinges, 788 F.Supp. 1543, 1547 (D. Kan. 1992)). The court’s order failed to
do so, instead characterizing the ongoing conduct as unrelated or merely
retaliatory, without crediting the First Amended Complaint’s specific
allegations that these acts are part of the same enterprise and serve the
same fraudulent purpose. The pattern requirement is not defeated simply
because the initial dispossession occurred; the ongoing risk of further
racketeering, as pleaded, is sufficient to establish open-ended continuity (Tal

=== PAGE 11 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
v. Hogan, 453 F.3d at 1267–68 (10th Cir. 2006)). Exceptions and Caveats It is
true that courts are cautious about finding RICO continuity in cases
involving a single scheme and a single victim, especially where the scheme
is short-lived and its objective is fully achieved (Skurkey v. Daniel, No.
CIV-22-496-R, 2023 WL 101946, at *6 (W.D. Okla. Jan. 4, 2023)). However,
the key distinction here is that the First Amended Complaint alleges the
scheme is ongoing, the objective is unfulfilled, and the risk of further
predicate acts is real due to the pending litigation. The facts alleged go
beyond mere retaliation or taunting and plausibly support a threat of
continued racketeering activity. It should also be noted that Condict v.
Condict, 815 F.2d 579 (10th Cir. 1987) has been stated as superseded by
Maxwell v. Wilson, 766 P.2d 909 (N.M. 1988), but this negative treatment
does not affect the federal RICO analysis, as the Tenth Circuit’s approach to
open-ended continuity remains consistent with Supreme Court precedent
and has not been overruled. Conclusion In sum, the judge’s assumption that
the completion of the "primary objective" meant the overall RICO scheme
was complete, and the dismissal of the relevance of ongoing text
communications to the litigation, are inconsistent with controlling Supreme
Court and Tenth Circuit law. The ongoing nature of the divorce litigation, the
risk of further predicate acts, and the content of the communications
plausibly support the existence of a continuing enterprise and a pattern of
racketeering activity. The court should have accepted the well-pleaded
allegations as true and allowed the case to proceed to discovery, rather than
dismissing the complaint at the pleading stage. Reconsideration is
warranted to address these material allegations and to prevent manifest
injustice. IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE WESTERN
DISTRICT OF OKLAHOMA CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, Plaintiff, v. DANIEL
KENNETH BRANTHOOVER & MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS, Defendants. §
§ § § Case No. CIV-24-1311-R § § § § RULE 59(e) MOTION FOR
RECONSIDERATION The Court’s order granting dismissal under Rule 12(b)
(6) rested on the conclusion that the alleged RICO enterprise ceased to
function once Plaintiff was ordered to vacate the home, treating the scheme
as a single, narrow effort with a discrete goal and no ongoing threat.
However, the First Amended Complaint specifically alleges that the divorce
litigation is ongoing, the enterprise’s broader objective—fraudulent
disposition of property and rights—remains unfulfilled, and there is a real
risk of further predicate acts as the case proceeds to final trial. Under
binding Supreme Court and Tenth Circuit authority, these facts plausibly
support a claim of open-ended continuity and a pattern of racketeering
activity, which the Court did not address. A motion for reconsideration is
appropriate where the Court has overlooked material facts or controlling
law, or where necessary to prevent manifest injustice. Here, the Court’s
order did not fully address the ongoing nature of the enterprise, the risk of
further predicate acts, or the open-ended continuity required under RICO.
Reconsideration should be GRANTED to allow the case to proceed on the
merits, as the well-pleaded allegations in the First Amended Complaint are
sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss under the applicable legal
standards. I. Background and Relevant Law A. RICO Pattern Requirement:
Relationship and Continuity 1. To state a civil RICO claim, a plaintiff must
allege that the defendant conducted the affairs of an enterprise through a
pattern of racketeering activity, which requires at least two predicate acts
that are both related and continuous (George v. Urban Settlement Servs.,

=== PAGE 12 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
833 F.3d 1242, 1248 (10th Cir. 2016); Johnson v. Heath, 56 F.4th 851, 858
(10th Cir. 2022)). The Supreme Court in H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel.
Co., 492 U.S. 229 (1989) clarified that “continuity” can be either closed-
ended (a series of related acts over a substantial period) or open-ended (a
threat of continuing criminal activity into the future). The Tenth Circuit has
consistently applied this “continuity plus relationship” test (Resolution Trust
Corp. v. Stone, 998 F.2d 1534, 1543 (10th Cir. 1993); Tal v. Hogan, 453 F.3d
1244, 1267–68 (10th Cir. 2006)). 2. The “relationship” prong is satisfied
when the predicate acts have similar purposes, results, participants, victims,
or methods, or are otherwise interrelated and not isolated events (Schrag v.
Dinges, 788 F.Supp. 1543, 1556 (D. Kan. 1992)). The “continuity” prong is
more stringent and can be established in two ways: (1) closed-ended
continuity, which requires a series of related predicate acts over a
substantial period, or (2) open-ended continuity, which requires a threat of
continued racketeering activity into the future (Resolution Trust Corp. v.
Stone, 998 F.2d 1534, 1543 (10th Cir. 1993); H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 241–42;
Independent Drug Wholesalers Group, Inc. v. Denton, 833 F.Supp. 1507,
1512 (D. Kan. 1993)). 3. Open-ended continuity may be shown by facts
indicating that the predicate acts are part of an ongoing entity’s regular way
of doing business or that there is a threat of repetition because the
enterprise’s objective is unfulfilled (Watchous Enterprrises, LLC v. Pac. Nat'l
Capital, LLC, Case No. 16-1432-JTM (D. Kan. Jul 25, 2018). The threat of
continued criminal activity need not be speculative; it may be grounded in
ongoing litigation or circumstances that make further predicate acts likely
(Fisher Sand & Gravel Co. v. FNF Constr., Inc., No. 10-cv-0635 RB/SMV (D.
N.M. Mar 27, 2013); Suddath v. Oklahoma Homebuilders, LLC, CIV-24-745-
SLP (W.D. Okla. Nov 08, 2024)). 4. The Tenth Circuit has held numerous
times that even where a scheme targets a single victim, if the plan
contemplates open-ended fraudulent activity and does not have a single goal
that, when achieved, will bring the activity to an end, continuity may be
satisfied (Torwest DBC, Inc. v. Dick, 810 F.2d 925, 928 (10th Cir. 1987);
Edwards v. First Nat. Bank, Bartlesville, Oklahoma, 872 F.2d 347, 351 (10th
Cir. 1989); Condict v. Condict, 826 F.2d 923, 927 (10th Cir. 1987)).
Conversely, if the scheme is truly isolated and its objective is fully achieved,
continuity is lacking. Id., 815 F.2d 579, 581 (10th Cir. 1987). 5. At the motion
to dismiss stage, the Court must accept all well-pleaded factual allegations
as true and draw all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff’s favor (George v.
Urban Settlement Servs., 833 F.3d 1242, 1248 (10th Cir. 2016)). The
question is not whether the plaintiff will ultimately prevail, but whether the
complaint states a plausible claim for relief. II. Analysis B. The Court’s Order
and Its Reasoning 6. The Court’s order (Order at 5–7) concluded that
Plaintiff failed to allege a pattern of racketeering activity because the
“primary criminal objective” (removal from the home) was achieved within a
month, and subsequent communications were not sufficiently related to the
initial scheme or did not evidence criminal conduct. The Court found no
open-ended continuity, reasoning that the scheme was complete and that
later conduct was merely taunting or retaliatory, not a threat of continued
racketeering. C. Ongoing Nature of the Enterprise and Unfulfilled Objective
7. The First Amended Complaint (referred to herein as “FAC”) alleges that
the enterprise’s broader objective—fraudulent disposition of property and
rights through the divorce—remains unfulfilled, and that the divorce
litigation is ongoing, with the final trial still pending (FAC ¶¶ 49–52, 86(ii)).

=== PAGE 13 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
The complaint details how the Defendants’ enterprise continues to operate,
with the risk of further predicate acts (such as perjury, wire fraud, and
manipulation of judicial proceedings) as the case proceeds toward final
disposition (FAC ¶¶ 49–54, 86(ii), 101–102). The Court’s order did not
address these allegations, instead treating the “primary objective” as
complete upon Plaintiff’s removal from the home. However, under RICO,
continuity is measured as of the time the suit is filed, and the risk of further
predicate acts in ongoing litigation is highly relevant (Resolution Trust Corp.
v. Stone, 998 F.2d 1534, 1543 (10th Cir. 1993); Fisher Sand & Gravel Co. v.
FNF Constr., Inc., No. 10-cv-0635 RB/SMV (D. N.M. Mar 27, 2013)). D.
Open-Ended Continuity: Threat of Continued Criminal Activity 8. The
Supreme Court and Tenth Circuit have made clear that open-ended
continuity exists where the predicate acts pose a threat of continued
criminal activity, especially where the enterprise’s business is not complete
and further acts are likely (H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S.
229, 241–42 (1989); Tal v. Hogan, 453 F.3d 1244, 1267 (10th Cir. 2006);
Suddath v. Oklahoma Homebuilders, LLC, CIV-24-745-SLP (W.D. Okla. Nov
08, 2024)). The FAC alleges that the risk of further predicate acts is not
speculative but grounded in the ongoing litigation, where Defendants have a
continuing incentive and opportunity to commit further acts of perjury, wire
fraud, or other racketeering activity to achieve their ultimate goal (FAC ¶¶
49–54, 86(ii), 101–102). The order’s focus on the completion of the “primary
objective” ignores the reality that the enterprise’s broader goal—fraudulent
disposition of property through the divorce—remains unachieved, and the
litigation is still pending. The risk of further predicate acts is thus real and
ongoing, supporting open-ended continuity (Resolution Trust Corp. v. Stone,
998 F.2d 1534, 1543 (10th Cir. 1993); Fisher Sand & Gravel Co. v. FNF
Constr., Inc., No. 10-cv-0635 RB/SMV (D. N.M. Mar 27, 2013). E.
Relationship and Pattern 9. The FAC also pleads that the predicate acts are
related: they share the same purpose (fraudulent deprivation of Plaintiff’s
property rights), involve the same participants (Myers and Branthoover),
target the same victim, and employ similar methods (deception,
misrepresentation, manipulation of legal processes) (FAC ¶¶ 49–54, 85,
101). This satisfies the “relationship” prong of the RICO pattern requirement
(George v. Urban Settlement Servs., 833 F.3d 1242, 1248 (10th Cir. 2016)).
F. The Law Does Not Require Multiple Victims or Schemes 10. The Court’s
order relied on the fact that the scheme was directed at a single victim and
had a “single, narrow purpose.” However, the Tenth Circuit has recognized
that even a scheme targeting one victim can satisfy the continuity
requirement if it contemplates open-ended fraudulent activity and does not
have a single goal that, when achieved, will bring the activity to an end.
(Torwest DBC, Inc. v. Dick, 810 F.2d 925, 928 (10th Cir. 1987); Edwards v.
First Nat. Bank, Bartlesville, Oklahoma, 872 F.2d 347, 351 (10th Cir. 1989);
Condict v. Condict, 826 F.2d 923, 927 (10th Cir. 1987)). The ongoing divorce
litigation and the risk of further predicate acts distinguish this case from
those where the scheme is truly isolated and complete. G. The Totality of
Circumstances 11. Courts are to consider the totality of the circumstances,
not just the timing of the initial predicate acts, in assessing continuity
(Fisher Sand & Gravel Co. v. FNF Constr., Inc., No. 10-cv-0635 RB/SMV (D.
N.M. Mar 27, 2013)). Here, the FAC alleges a continuing enterprise, ongoing
litigation, and a real risk of further racketeering acts, all of which support a
finding of open-ended continuity. H. Application to the Complaint and Order

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
12. The FAC alleges that the enterprise’s objective—fraudulent disposition of
property through the divorce—remains unfulfilled, and the risk of further
predicate acts is ongoing (FAC ¶¶ 49–54, 86(ii), 101–102). The order did not
address these ongoing risks, instead treating the “primary objective” as
complete and the scheme as isolated (Order at 6–7). Under controlling law,
the ongoing litigation and risk of further predicate acts support open-ended
continuity and a pattern of racketeering activity (H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern
Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 241–42 (1989); Resolution Trust Corp. v. Stone,
998 F.2d 1534, 1543 (10th Cir. 1993); Tal v. Hogan, 453 F.3d 1244, 1267
(10th Cir. 2006)). IV. Standard for Reconsideration 13. A motion for
reconsideration under Rule 59(e) is appropriate where the court has
overlooked material facts or controlling law, or where necessary to prevent
manifest injustice (Servants of Paraclete v. Does, 204 F.3d 1005, 1012 (10th
Cir. 2000), not in table but widely cited in Tenth Circuit). Here, the Court’s
order did not fully address the ongoing nature of the enterprise, the risk of
further predicate acts, or the open-ended continuity required under RICO.
Reconsideration should be sought to allow the case to proceed on the
merits, as the well-pleaded allegations in the First Amended Complaint are
sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss under the applicable legal
standards. I. Pleading Standard 14. At the motion to dismiss stage, the Court
must accept as true all well-pleaded allegations and draw all reasonable
inferences in Plaintiff’s favor (George v. Urban Settlement Servs., 833 F.3d
1242, 1248 (10th Cir. 2016)). The Court’s order (Order at 5–6) failed to do
so, instead characterizing the ongoing conduct as unrelated or merely
retaliatory, without crediting the FAC’s specific allegations that these acts
are part of the same enterprise and serve the same fraudulent purpose. The
Court also failed to recognize that the pattern requirement is not defeated
simply because the initial dispossession occurred; the ongoing risk of further
racketeering, as pleaded, is sufficient to establish open-ended continuity (Tal
v. Hogan, 453 F.3d at 1267–68; RICO. V. Exceptions 15. It is true that courts
are cautious about finding RICO continuity in cases involving a single
scheme and a single victim, especially where the scheme is short-lived and
its objective is fully achieved (Skurkey v. Daniel, No. CIV-22-496-R, 2023 WL
101946, at *6 (W.D. Okla. Jan. 4, 2023)). However, the key distinction here is
that the FAC alleges the scheme is ongoing, the objective is unfulfilled, and
the risk of further predicate acts is real due to the pending litigation. The
facts alleged go beyond mere retaliation or taunting and plausibly support a
threat of continued racketeering activity. 16. It is noteworthy to mention the
negative treatment of Condict v. Condict, 815 F.2d 579 (10th Cir. 1987) in
Maxwell v. Wilson, 766 P.2d 909 (N.M. 1988) does not affect the federal
RICO analysis, as the Tenth Circuit’s approach to open-ended continuity
remains consistent with Supreme Court precedent and has not been
overruled. VI. Conclusion 17. With the utmost respect, Plaintiff has shown
that the Court’s order overlooked material allegations and controlling law
regarding the ongoing nature of the enterprise and the real threat of
continued racketeering activity. The FAC alleges that the enterprise’s
objective is unfulfilled, the divorce litigation is ongoing, and the risk of
further predicate acts remains as the final trial approaches. Under Supreme
Court and Tenth Circuit precedent, these facts plausibly support a claim of
open-ended continuity and a pattern of racketeering activity.

research, and directly apply enhancements to this motion, and send back
with order and FAC references, bolstering it where necessary to include all
valid arguments to get a successful reconsideration. Answer Short response
The Tenth Circuit standard for Rule 59(e) reconsideration allows relief
where the court has overlooked material facts or controlling law, or to
prevent manifest injustice, and in civil RICO cases, dismissal is improper if
the complaint plausibly alleges open-ended continuity and related predicate
acts. Here, the court erred by treating the scheme as complete upon
Plaintiff’s removal from the home and by disregarding well-pleaded
allegations of ongoing racketeering risk and related communications,
warranting reconsideration under binding Supreme Court and Tenth Circuit
authority. Summary A Rule 59(e) motion for reconsideration in the Tenth
Circuit is appropriate when the district court overlooks material facts or
controlling law, or when necessary to prevent manifest injustice. In the
context of civil RICO claims, the Supreme Court and Tenth Circuit require
courts to accept all well-pleaded allegations as true at the motion to dismiss
stage, and to assess whether the complaint plausibly alleges a pattern of
racketeering activity—including both the relationship and continuity prongs,
with continuity satisfied by either a closed period of repeated conduct or an
open-ended threat of future racketeering. The district court’s order failed to
address the ongoing nature of the alleged RICO enterprise, the risk of
further predicate acts as the divorce litigation continued, and the
relationship between the predicate acts and subsequent communications.
Under controlling law, these facts plausibly support open-ended continuity,
and the court’s failure to credit them or to allow discovery was error. The
motion for reconsideration should be granted to allow the case to proceed
on the merits. Background and Relevant Law Rule 59(e) Standard in the
Tenth Circuit A Rule 59(e) motion for reconsideration is appropriate where
the court has misapprehended the facts, a party’s position, or the controlling
law, or where necessary to prevent manifest injustice. This standard is well-
established in the Tenth Circuit and is particularly relevant where the
court’s order overlooks material allegations or misapplies binding precedent
(Servants of Paraclete v. Does, 204 F.3d 1005, 1012 (10th Cir. 2000), cited in
the user’s draft and widely followed). Civil RICO: Pattern, Relationship, and
Continuity To state a civil RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), a plaintiff
must allege that the defendant conducted the affairs of an enterprise
through a pattern of racketeering activity, which requires at least two
predicate acts that are both related and continuous (Johnson v. Heath, 56 F.
4th 851, 858 (10th Cir. 2022); George v. Urban Settlement Servs., 833 F.3d
1242, 1248 (10th Cir. 2016)). The “relationship” prong is satisfied when the
predicate acts have similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or

=== PAGE 16 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
methods, or are otherwise interrelated and not isolated events (Bixler v.
Foster, 596 F.3d 751, 761 (10th Cir. 2010); Schrag v. Dinges, 788 F.Supp.
1543, 1556 (D. Kan. 1992)). The “continuity” prong is more stringent and
can be established in two ways: Closed-ended continuity: A series of related
predicate acts over a substantial period of time. Open-ended continuity: A
threat of continued racketeering activity into the future, which may be
shown by facts indicating that the predicate acts are part of an ongoing
entity’s regular way of doing business or that there is a threat of repetition
because the enterprise’s objective is unfulfilled (Resolution Trust Corp. v.
Stone, 998 F.2d 1534, 1543 (10th Cir. 1993); H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell
Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 241–42 (1989); Suddath v. Oklahoma Homebuilders,
LLC, CIV-24-745-SLP (W.D. Okla. Nov 08, 2024)). The Tenth Circuit has
repeatedly held that even where a scheme targets a single victim, if the plan
contemplates open-ended fraudulent activity and does not have a single goal
that, when achieved, will bring the activity to an end, continuity may be
satisfied (Torwest DBC, Inc. v. Dick, 810 F.2d 925, 928 (10th Cir. 1987);
Edwards v. First Nat. Bank, Bartlesville, Oklahoma, 872 F.2d 347, 351 (10th
Cir. 1989); Condict v. Condict, 826 F.2d 923, 927 (10th Cir. 1987)).
Conversely, if the scheme is truly isolated and its objective is fully achieved,
continuity is lacking (Condict v. Condict, 815 F.2d 579, 581 (10th Cir. 1987)).
At the motion to dismiss stage, the court must accept all well-pleaded
factual allegations as true and draw all reasonable inferences in the
plaintiff’s favor (George v. Urban Settlement Servs., 833 F.3d 1242, 1248
(10th Cir. 2016); Schrag v. Dinges, 788 F.Supp. 1543, 1547 (D. Kan. 1992)).
Analysis 1. The Court’s Order Overlooked Material Allegations of Open-
Ended Continuity The district court’s order focused on the achievement of a
“primary objective” (removal from the home) and concluded that the scheme
was complete, disregarding the ongoing nature of the divorce litigation and
the risk of further predicate acts. However, the First Amended Complaint
(FAC) specifically alleges that the enterprise’s broader objective—fraudulent
disposition of property and rights through the divorce—remains unfulfilled,
and that the litigation is ongoing, with the final trial still pending (FAC ¶¶
49–52, 86(ii)). The FAC details how the Defendants’ enterprise continues to
operate, with the risk of further predicate acts (such as perjury, wire fraud,
and manipulation of judicial proceedings) as the case proceeds toward final
disposition (FAC ¶¶ 49–54, 86(ii), 101–102). Under controlling law,
continuity is measured as of the time the suit is filed, not by whether a
“primary objective” has been achieved (Resolution Trust Corp. v. Stone, 998
F.2d 1534, 1543 (10th Cir. 1993)). If the enterprise’s broader objective
remains unfulfilled and there is a real risk of further predicate acts, then
open-ended continuity may be established. The ongoing nature of the
divorce proceedings, as alleged in the FAC, means the risk of further
racketeering activity is not speculative but grounded in the facts of the case
(Fisher Sand & Gravel Co. v. FNF Constr., Inc., No. 10-cv-0635 RB/SMV (D.
N.M. Mar 27, 2013)). 2. Open-Ended Continuity and Threat of Future
Predicate Acts Open-ended continuity exists where the predicate acts pose a
threat of continued criminal activity, especially where the enterprise’s
business is not complete and further acts are likely (H.J. Inc. v.
Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 241–42 (1989); Tal v. Hogan, 453 F.
3d 1244, 1267 (10th Cir. 2006); Suddath v. Oklahoma Homebuilders, LLC,
CIV-24-745-SLP (W.D. Okla. Nov 08, 2024)). The FAC alleges that the risk of
further predicate acts is not speculative but grounded in the ongoing

=== PAGE 17 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
litigation, where Defendants have a continuing incentive and opportunity to
commit further acts of perjury, wire fraud, or other racketeering activity to
achieve their ultimate goal (FAC ¶¶ 49–54, 86(ii), 101–102). The order’s
focus on the completion of the “primary objective” ignores the reality that
the enterprise’s broader goal—fraudulent disposition of property through
the divorce—remains unachieved, and the litigation is still pending. The
Tenth Circuit has recognized that open-ended continuity may be established
by showing that the racketeering acts involved implicit or explicit threats of
repetition, that they formed the operations of an association that exists for
criminal purposes, or that they were the defendants’ regular way of
conducting a legitimate enterprise (Johnson v. Heath, 56 F.4th 851, 859–60
(10th Cir. 2022); UMB Bank v. Monson, 21-CV-2504-EFM (D. Kan. Jun 04,
2025)). The FAC’s allegations of ongoing litigation and the risk of further
predicate acts as the divorce case proceeds to final trial are precisely the
type of facts that support open-ended continuity. 3. Relationship Prong: The
Texts and Ongoing Communications The “relationship” requirement is not a
high bar; predicate acts are related if they share similar purposes, results,
participants, victims, or methods, or are otherwise interrelated and not
isolated events (Bixler v. Foster, 596 F.3d 751, 761 (10th Cir. 2010); Johnson
v. Heath, 56 F.4th 851, 859 (10th Cir. 2022)). The FAC pleads that the
predicate acts—including the text messages and ongoing communications—
are related because they share the same purpose (fraudulent deprivation of
Plaintiff’s property rights), involve the same participants, target the same
victim, and employ similar methods (deception, misrepresentation,
manipulation of legal processes) (FAC ¶¶ 49–54, 85, 101). The judge’s
conclusion that the texts were unrelated to the litigation is inconsistent with
the requirement to accept all well-pleaded allegations as true and to draw
all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff’s favor at the motion to dismiss
stage (Schrag v. Dinges, 788 F.Supp. 1543, 1547 (D. Kan. 1992)). The
content and context of the communications, as alleged, plausibly support the
inference that they are part of the same racketeering scheme and serve the
same fraudulent purpose. 4. The Law Does Not Require Multiple Victims or
Schemes The Tenth Circuit has recognized that even a scheme targeting one
victim can satisfy the continuity requirement if it contemplates open-ended
fraudulent activity and does not have a single goal that, when achieved, will
bring the activity to an end (Torwest DBC, Inc. v. Dick, 810 F.2d 925, 928
(10th Cir. 1987); Edwards v. First Nat. Bank, Bartlesville, Oklahoma, 872 F.
2d 347, 351 (10th Cir. 1989); Condict v. Condict, 826 F.2d 923, 927 (10th Cir.
1987)). The ongoing divorce litigation and the risk of further predicate acts
distinguish this case from those where the scheme is truly isolated and
complete. 5. Totality of the Circumstances Courts are to consider the totality
of the circumstances, not just the timing of the initial predicate acts, in
assessing continuity (Fisher Sand & Gravel Co. v. FNF Constr., Inc., No. 10-
cv-0635 RB/SMV (D. N.M. Mar 27, 2013)). Here, the FAC alleges a
continuing enterprise, ongoing litigation, and a real risk of further
racketeering acts, all of which support a finding of open-ended continuity. 6.
Pleading Standard and the Role of Discovery At the motion to dismiss stage,
the court must accept as true all well-pleaded allegations and draw all
reasonable inferences in Plaintiff’s favor (George v. Urban Settlement
Servs., 833 F.3d 1242, 1248 (10th Cir. 2016); Schrag v. Dinges, 788 F.Supp.
1543, 1547 (D. Kan. 1992)). The court’s order failed to do so, instead
characterizing the ongoing conduct as unrelated or merely retaliatory,

=== PAGE 18 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
without crediting the FAC’s specific allegations that these acts are part of
the same enterprise and serve the same fraudulent purpose. The pattern
requirement is not defeated simply because the initial dispossession
occurred; the ongoing risk of further racketeering, as pleaded, is sufficient
to establish open-ended continuity (Tal v. Hogan, 453 F.3d at 1267–68 (10th
Cir. 2006)). The Tenth Circuit has emphasized that deficiencies in the
plaintiff’s case should more appropriately be addressed through summary
judgment after the plaintiff has had an opportunity to substantiate their
allegations through discovery (Schrag v. Dinges, 788 F.Supp. 1543, 1547 (D.
Kan. 1992)). 7. Exceptions and Caveats It is true that courts are cautious
about finding RICO continuity in cases involving a single scheme and a
single victim, especially where the scheme is short-lived and its objective is
fully achieved (Skurkey v. Daniel, No. CIV-22-496-R, 2023 WL 101946, at *6
(W.D. Okla. Jan. 4, 2023)). However, the key distinction here is that the FAC
alleges the scheme is ongoing, the objective is unfulfilled, and the risk of
further predicate acts is real due to the pending litigation. The facts alleged
go beyond mere retaliation or taunting and plausibly support a threat of
continued racketeering activity. It should also be noted that Condict v.
Condict, 815 F.2d 579 (10th Cir. 1987) has been stated as superseded by
Maxwell v. Wilson, 766 P.2d 909 (N.M. 1988), but this negative treatment
does not affect the federal RICO analysis, as the Tenth Circuit’s approach to
open-ended continuity remains consistent with Supreme Court precedent
and has not been overruled. Conclusion In sum, the district court’s order
granting dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) overlooked material allegations and
controlling law regarding the ongoing nature of the enterprise and the real
threat of continued racketeering activity. The FAC alleges that the
enterprise’s objective is unfulfilled, the divorce litigation is ongoing, and the
risk of further predicate acts remains as the final trial approaches. Under
Supreme Court and Tenth Circuit precedent, these facts plausibly support a
claim of open-ended continuity and a pattern of racketeering activity.
Reconsideration is warranted to address these material allegations and to
prevent manifest injustice. The court should vacate the order of dismissal,
require the defendants to respond, and allow the matter to proceed to
discovery. Enhanced Draft for Rule 59(e) Motion for Reconsideration IN THE
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF
OKLAHOMA CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, Plaintiff, v. DANIEL KENNETH
BRANTHOOVER & MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS, Defendants. Case No.
CIV-24-1311-R RULE 59(e) MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION Plaintiff
respectfully moves for reconsideration of the Court’s order dismissing this
action under Rule 12(b)(6), on the grounds that the order overlooked
material facts and controlling law regarding the ongoing nature of the
alleged RICO enterprise, the risk of further predicate acts, and the open-
ended continuity required under RICO. Reconsideration is necessary to
prevent manifest injustice and to allow the case to proceed on the merits. I.
Legal Standard A Rule 59(e) motion is appropriate where the court has
misapprehended the facts, a party’s position, or the controlling law, or
where necessary to prevent manifest injustice (Servants of Paraclete v. Does,
204 F.3d 1005, 1012 (10th Cir. 2000)). II. RICO Pattern Requirement:
Relationship and Continuity To state a civil RICO claim, a plaintiff must
allege that the defendant conducted the affairs of an enterprise through a
pattern of racketeering activity, which requires at least two predicate acts
that are both related and continuous (Johnson v. Heath, 56 F.4th 851, 858

=== PAGE 19 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
(10th Cir. 2022)). The “relationship” prong is satisfied when the predicate
acts have similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods, or are
otherwise interrelated and not isolated events (Bixler v. Foster, 596 F.3d
751, 761 (10th Cir. 2010)). The “continuity” prong can be established by
either a closed period of repeated conduct or an open-ended threat of
continued racketeering activity (Resolution Trust Corp. v. Stone, 998 F.2d
1534, 1543 (10th Cir. 1993); H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S.
229, 241–42 (1989)). III. The Court’s Order Overlooked Material Allegations
of Open-Ended Continuity The order treated the scheme as complete upon
Plaintiff’s removal from the home, disregarding the ongoing nature of the
divorce litigation and the risk of further predicate acts. The First Amended
Complaint (FAC) specifically alleges that the enterprise’s broader objective
—fraudulent disposition of property and rights through the divorce—remains
unfulfilled, and that the litigation is ongoing, with the final trial still pending
(FAC ¶¶ 49–52, 86(ii)). The FAC details how the Defendants’ enterprise
continues to operate, with the risk of further predicate acts (such as perjury,
wire fraud, and manipulation of judicial proceedings) as the case proceeds
toward final disposition (FAC ¶¶ 49–54, 86(ii), 101–102). Under controlling
law, continuity is measured as of the time the suit is filed, not by whether a
“primary objective” has been achieved (Resolution Trust Corp. v. Stone, 998
F.2d 1534, 1543 (10th Cir. 1993)). The ongoing nature of the divorce
proceedings, as alleged in the FAC, means the risk of further racketeering
activity is not speculative but grounded in the facts of the case (Fisher Sand
& Gravel Co. v. FNF Constr., Inc., No. 10-cv-0635 RB/SMV (D. N.M. Mar 27,
2013)). IV. Open-Ended Continuity and Threat of Future Predicate Acts
Open-ended continuity exists where the predicate acts pose a threat of
continued criminal activity, especially where the enterprise’s business is not
complete and further acts are likely (H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co.,
492 U.S. 229, 241–42 (1989); Tal v. Hogan, 453 F.3d 1244, 1267 (10th Cir.
2006); Suddath v. Oklahoma Homebuilders, LLC, CIV-24-745-SLP (W.D. Okla.
Nov 08, 2024)). The FAC’s allegations of ongoing litigation and the risk of
further predicate acts as the divorce case proceeds to final trial are
precisely the type of facts that support open-ended continuity. V.
Relationship Prong: The Texts and Ongoing Communications The FAC pleads
that the predicate acts—including the text messages and ongoing
communications—are related because they share the same purpose
(fraudulent deprivation of Plaintiff’s property rights), involve the same
participants, target the same victim, and employ similar methods (deception,
misrepresentation, manipulation of legal processes) (FAC ¶¶ 49–54, 85,
101). The judge’s conclusion that the texts were unrelated to the litigation is
inconsistent with the requirement to accept all well-pleaded allegations as
true and to draw all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff’s favor at the
motion to dismiss stage (Schrag v. Dinges, 788 F.Supp. 1543, 1547 (D. Kan.

continuity (Fisher Sand & Gravel Co. v. FNF Constr., Inc., No. 10-cv-0635
RB/SMV (D. N.M. Mar 27, 2013)). Here, the FAC alleges a continuing
enterprise, ongoing litigation, and a real risk of further racketeering acts, all
of which support a finding of open-ended continuity. VIII. Pleading Standard
and the Role of Discovery At the motion to dismiss stage, the court must
accept as true all well-pleaded allegations and draw all reasonable
inferences in Plaintiff’s favor (George v. Urban Settlement Servs., 833 F.3d
1242, 1248 (10th Cir. 2016); Schrag v. Dinges, 788 F.Supp. 1543, 1547 (D.
Kan. 1992)). The court’s order failed to do so, instead characterizing the
ongoing conduct as unrelated or merely retaliatory, without crediting the
FAC’s specific allegations that these acts are part of the same enterprise and
serve the same fraudulent purpose. The pattern requirement is not defeated
simply because the initial dispossession occurred; the ongoing risk of further
racketeering, as pleaded, is sufficient to establish open-ended continuity (Tal
v. Hogan, 453 F.3d at 1267–68 (10th Cir. 2006)). IX. Exceptions and Caveats
While courts are cautious about finding RICO continuity in cases involving a

and the order. United States (Tenth Circuit) Certainly. Below is a fully
enhanced, detailed Rule 59(e) Motion for Reconsideration, directly applying
the relevant law to the facts, referencing both the First Amended Complaint
(FAC) and the Court’s Order, and bolstering the arguments for
reconsideration. This draft is tailored to the Tenth Circuit and Supreme
Court standards, and is designed to maximize the likelihood of a successful
reconsideration. IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
WESTERN DISTRICT OF OKLAHOMA CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, Plaintiff,
v. DANIEL KENNETH BRANTHOOVER & MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS,
Defendants. Case No. CIV-24-1311-R PLAINTIFF’S RULE 59(e) MOTION
FOR RECONSIDERATION Plaintiff Charles Dustin Myers respectfully moves
for reconsideration of the Court’s August 28, 2025 Order (Doc. 29)
dismissing this action under Rule 12(b)(6). Reconsideration is warranted
because the Order overlooked material facts and controlling law regarding
the ongoing nature of the alleged RICO enterprise, the risk of further
predicate acts, and the open-ended continuity required under RICO. The
Court’s ruling, if left uncorrected, would result in manifest injustice by
precluding Plaintiff from proceeding on well-pleaded claims that satisfy the
applicable legal standards. I. LEGAL STANDARD A motion to alter or amend
judgment under Rule 59(e) is appropriate where the court has
misapprehended the facts, a party’s position, or the controlling law, or
where necessary to prevent manifest injustice. See Servants of Paraclete v.
Does, 204 F.3d 1005, 1012 (10th Cir. 2000) . Reconsideration is especially

=== PAGE 21 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
appropriate where, as here, the Court’s order overlooks material allegations
or misapplies binding precedent. II. RICO PATTERN REQUIREMENT:
RELATIONSHIP AND CONTINUITY To state a civil RICO claim under 18
U.S.C. § 1962(c), a plaintiff must allege that the defendant conducted the
affairs of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity, which
requires at least two predicate acts that are both related and continuous.
See Johnson v. Heath, 56 F.4th 851, 858 (10th Cir. 2022) ; George v. Urban
Settlement Servs., 833 F.3d 1242, 1248 (10th Cir. 2016) . The “relationship”
prong is satisfied when the predicate acts have similar purposes, results,
participants, victims, or methods, or are otherwise interrelated and not
isolated events. Bixler v. Foster, 596 F.3d 751, 761 (10th Cir. 2010) . The
“continuity” prong can be established by either a closed period of repeated
conduct or an open-ended threat of continued racketeering activity.
Resolution Trust Corp. v. Stone, 998 F.2d 1534, 1543 (10th Cir. 1993) ; H.J.
Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 241–42 (1989) . III. THE
COURT’S ORDER OVERLOOKED MATERIAL ALLEGATIONS OF OPEN-
ENDED CONTINUITY The Order (Doc. 29 at 5–7) concluded that Plaintiff
failed to allege a pattern of racketeering activity because the “primary
criminal objective” (removal from the home) was achieved within a month,
and subsequent communications were not sufficiently related to the initial
scheme or did not evidence criminal conduct. The Court found no open-
ended continuity, reasoning that the scheme was complete and that later
conduct was merely taunting or retaliatory, not a threat of continued
racketeering. However, this analysis is inconsistent with the controlling law
and the well-pleaded allegations in the FAC: A. Ongoing Nature of the
Enterprise and Unfulfilled Objective The FAC specifically alleges that the
enterprise’s broader objective—fraudulent disposition of property and rights
through the divorce—remains unfulfilled, and that the divorce litigation is
ongoing, with the final trial still pending. (FAC ¶¶ 49–52, 86(ii)). The FAC
details how Defendants’ enterprise continues to operate, with the risk of
further predicate acts (such as perjury, wire fraud, and manipulation of
judicial proceedings) as the case proceeds toward final disposition. (FAC ¶¶
49–54, 86(ii), 101–102). The Court’s Order did not address these allegations,
instead treating the “primary objective” as complete upon Plaintiff’s removal
from the home. (Order at 6–7). Controlling law is clear that continuity is
measured as of the time the suit is filed, not by whether a “primary
objective” has been achieved. Resolution Trust Corp. v. Stone, 998 F.2d
1534, 1543 (10th Cir. 1993) . The ongoing nature of the divorce proceedings,
as alleged in the FAC, means the risk of further racketeering activity is not
speculative but grounded in the facts of the case. See also Fisher Sand &
Gravel Co. v. FNF Constr., Inc., No. 10-cv-0635 RB/SMV (D. N.M. Mar 27,
2013) . B. Open-Ended Continuity and Threat of Future Predicate Acts Open-
ended continuity exists where the predicate acts pose a threat of continued
criminal activity, especially where the enterprise’s business is not complete
and further acts are likely. H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S.
229, 241–42 (1989) ; Tal v. Hogan, 453 F.3d 1244, 1267 (10th Cir. 2006) .
The FAC alleges that the risk of further predicate acts is not speculative but
grounded in the ongoing litigation, where Defendants have a continuing
incentive and opportunity to commit further acts of perjury, wire fraud, or
other racketeering activity to achieve their ultimate goal. (FAC ¶¶ 49–54,
86(ii), 101–102). The Order’s focus on the completion of the “primary
objective” ignores the reality that the enterprise’s broader goal—fraudulent

=== PAGE 22 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
disposition of property through the divorce—remains unachieved, and the
litigation is still pending. C. Relationship Prong: The Texts and Ongoing
Communications The “relationship” requirement is not a high bar; predicate
acts are related if they share similar purposes, results, participants, victims,
or methods, or are otherwise interrelated and not isolated events. Bixler v.

859 (10th Cir. 2022) . The FAC pleads that the predicate acts—including the
text messages and ongoing communications—are related because they share
the same purpose (fraudulent deprivation of Plaintiff’s property rights),
involve the same participants, target the same victim, and employ similar
methods (deception, misrepresentation, manipulation of legal processes).
(FAC ¶¶ 49–54, 85, 101). The Order’s conclusion that the texts were
unrelated to the litigation is inconsistent with the requirement to accept all
well-pleaded allegations as true and to draw all reasonable inferences in the
plaintiff’s favor at the motion to dismiss stage. Schrag v. Dinges, 788 F.Supp.
1543, 1547 (D. Kan. 1992) . D. The Law Does Not Require Multiple Victims
or Schemes The Tenth Circuit has recognized that even a scheme targeting
one victim can satisfy the continuity requirement if it contemplates open-
ended fraudulent activity and does not have a single goal that, when
achieved, will bring the activity to an end. Torwest DBC, Inc. v. Dick, 810 F.
2d 925, 928 (10th Cir. 1987) ; Edwards v. First Nat. Bank, Bartlesville,
Oklahoma, 872 F.2d 347, 351 (10th Cir. 1989) ; Condict v. Condict, 826 F.2d
923, 927 (10th Cir. 1987) . The ongoing divorce litigation and the risk of
further predicate acts distinguish this case from those where the scheme is
truly isolated and complete. E. Totality of the Circumstances Courts are to
consider the totality of the circumstances, not just the timing of the initial
predicate acts, in assessing continuity. Fisher Sand & Gravel Co. v. FNF
Constr., Inc., No. 10-cv-0635 RB/SMV (D. N.M. Mar 27, 2013) . Here, the
FAC alleges a continuing enterprise, ongoing litigation, and a real risk of
further racketeering acts, all of which support a finding of open-ended
continuity. F. Pleading Standard and the Role of Discovery At the motion to
dismiss stage, the Court must accept as true all well-pleaded allegations and
draw all reasonable inferences in Plaintiff’s favor. George v. Urban
Settlement Servs., 833 F.3d 1242, 1248 (10th Cir. 2016) ; Schrag v. Dinges,
788 F.Supp. 1543, 1547 (D. Kan. 1992) . The Order failed to do so, instead
characterizing the ongoing conduct as unrelated or merely retaliatory,
without crediting the FAC’s specific allegations that these acts are part of
the same enterprise and serve the same fraudulent purpose. The pattern
requirement is not defeated simply because the initial dispossession
occurred; the ongoing risk of further racketeering, as pleaded, is sufficient
to establish open-ended continuity. Tal v. Hogan, 453 F.3d at 1267–68 (10th
Cir. 2006) . The Tenth Circuit has emphasized that deficiencies in the
plaintiff’s case should more appropriately be addressed through summary
judgment after the plaintiff has had an opportunity to substantiate their
allegations through discovery. Schrag v. Dinges, 788 F.Supp. 1543, 1547 (D.
Kan. 1992) . G. Exceptions and Caveats While courts are cautious about
finding RICO continuity in cases involving a single scheme and a single
victim, especially where the scheme is short-lived and its objective is fully
achieved ( Skurkey v. Daniel, No. CIV-22-496-R, 2023 WL 101946, at *6 (W.D.
Okla. Jan. 4, 2023) ), the key distinction here is that the FAC alleges the
scheme is ongoing, the objective is unfulfilled, and the risk of further
predicate acts is real due to the pending litigation. IV. CONCLUSION AND

Answer (Tenth Circuit)
Short response
Yes, the district court erred by treating the RICO scheme as complete upon
Plaintiff’s removal from the home and by disregarding well-pleaded
allegations of ongoing racketeering risk and related communications; under
controlling Supreme Court and Tenth Circuit law, the ongoing divorce
litigation and risk of further predicate acts plausibly support open-ended
continuity and a pattern of racketeering activity, warranting reconsideration
and the opportunity for discovery.
Summary
A Rule 59(e) motion for reconsideration is appropriate in the Tenth Circuit
when the court overlooks material facts or controlling law, or when
necessary to prevent manifest injustice. In the context of civil RICO claims,
the Supreme Court and Tenth Circuit require courts to accept all well-
pleaded allegations as true at the motion to dismiss stage and to assess
whether the complaint plausibly alleges a pattern of racketeering activity—
including both the relationship and continuity prongs, with continuity

=== PAGE 24 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
satisfied by either a closed period of repeated conduct or an open-ended
threat of future racketeering.
Here, the district court’s order failed to address the ongoing nature of the
alleged RICO enterprise, the risk of further predicate acts as the divorce
litigation continued, and the relationship between the predicate acts and
subsequent communications. Under controlling law, these facts plausibly
support open-ended continuity, and the court’s failure to credit them or to
allow discovery was error. The motion for reconsideration should be granted
to allow the case to proceed on the merits.
IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF OKLAHOMA
CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS,
Plaintiff,
v.
DANIEL KENNETH BRANTHOOVER &
MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS,
Defendants.
Case No. CIV-24-1311-R
PLAINTIFF’S RULE 59(e) MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION
Plaintiff Charles Dustin Myers respectfully moves for reconsideration of the
Court’s August 28, 2025 Order (Doc. 29) dismissing this action under Rule
12(b)(6). Reconsideration is warranted because the Order overlooked
material facts and controlling law regarding the ongoing nature of the
alleged RICO enterprise, the risk of further predicate acts, and the open-
ended continuity required under RICO. The Court’s ruling, if left
uncorrected, would result in manifest injustice by precluding Plaintiff from
proceeding on well-pleaded claims that satisfy the applicable legal
standards.
I. LEGAL STANDARD
A motion to alter or amend judgment under Rule 59(e) is appropriate where
the court has misapprehended the facts, a party’s position, or the controlling
law, or where necessary to prevent manifest injustice. See Servants of
Paraclete v. Does, 204 F.3d 1005, 1012 (10th Cir. 2000). Reconsideration is
especially appropriate where, as here, the Court’s order overlooks material
allegations or misapplies binding precedent.
II. RICO PATTERN REQUIREMENT: RELATIONSHIP AND
CONTINUITY
To state a civil RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), a plaintiff must allege
that the defendant conducted the affairs of an enterprise through a pattern
of racketeering activity, which requires at least two predicate acts that are
both related and continuous. See Johnson v. Heath, 56 F.4th 851, 858 (10th

=== PAGE 25 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Cir. 2022); George v. Urban Settlement Servs., 833 F.3d 1242, 1248 (10th
Cir. 2016).
The “relationship” prong is satisfied when the predicate acts have similar
purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods, or are otherwise
interrelated and not isolated events. Bixler v. Foster, 596 F.3d 751, 761 (10th
Cir. 2010); Johnson v. Heath, 56 F.4th 851, 859 (10th Cir. 2022). The
“continuity” prong can be established by either a closed period of repeated
conduct or an open-ended threat of continued racketeering activity. 
Resolution Trust Corp. v. Stone, 998 F.2d 1534, 1543 (10th Cir. 1993); H.J.
Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 241–42 (1989).
III. THE COURT’S ORDER OVERLOOKED MATERIAL
ALLEGATIONS OF OPEN-ENDED CONTINUITY
The Order (Doc. 29 at 5–7) concluded that Plaintiff failed to allege a pattern
of racketeering activity because the “primary criminal objective” (removal
from the home) was achieved within a month, and subsequent
communications were not sufficiently related to the initial scheme or did not
evidence criminal conduct. The Court found no open-ended continuity,
reasoning that the scheme was complete and that later conduct was merely
taunting or retaliatory, not a threat of continued racketeering.
However, this analysis is inconsistent with the controlling law and the well-
pleaded allegations in the FAC:
A. Ongoing Nature of the Enterprise and Unfulfilled Objective
The FAC specifically alleges that the enterprise’s broader objective—
fraudulent disposition of property and rights through the divorce—remains
unfulfilled, and that the divorce litigation is ongoing, with the final trial still
pending. (FAC ¶¶ 49–52, 86(ii)). The FAC details how Defendants’ enterprise
continues to operate, with the risk of further predicate acts (such as perjury,
wire fraud, and manipulation of judicial proceedings) as the case proceeds
toward final disposition. (FAC ¶¶ 49–54, 86(ii), 101–102). The Court’s Order
did not address these allegations, instead treating the “primary objective” as
complete upon Plaintiff’s removal from the home. (Order at 6–7).
Controlling law is clear that continuity is measured as of the time the suit is
filed, not by whether a “primary objective” has been achieved. Resolution
Trust Corp. v. Stone, 998 F.2d 1534, 1543 (10th Cir. 1993). The ongoing
nature of the divorce proceedings, as alleged in the FAC, means the risk of
further racketeering activity is not speculative but grounded in the facts of
the case. See also Fisher Sand & Gravel Co. v. FNF Constr., Inc., No. 10-
cv-0635 RB/SMV (D. N.M. Mar 27, 2013).
B. Open-Ended Continuity and Threat of Future Predicate Acts
Open-ended continuity exists where the predicate acts pose a threat of
continued criminal activity, especially where the enterprise’s business is not
complete and further acts are likely. H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co.,

=== PAGE 26 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
492 U.S. 229, 241–42 (1989); Tal v. Hogan, 453 F.3d 1244, 1267 (10th Cir.
2006); Suddath v. Oklahoma Homebuilders, LLC, CIV-24-745-SLP (W.D. Okla.
Nov 08, 2024). The FAC alleges that the risk of further predicate acts is not
speculative but grounded in the ongoing litigation, where Defendants have a
continuing incentive and opportunity to commit further acts of perjury, wire
fraud, or other racketeering activity to achieve their ultimate goal. (FAC ¶¶
49–54, 86(ii), 101–102). The Order’s focus on the completion of the “primary
objective” ignores the reality that the enterprise’s broader goal—fraudulent
disposition of property through the divorce—remains unachieved, and the
litigation is still pending.
The Tenth Circuit has recognized that open-ended continuity may be
established by showing that the racketeering acts involved implicit or
explicit threats of repetition, that they formed the operations of an
association that exists for criminal purposes, or that they were the
defendants’ regular way of conducting a legitimate enterprise. Johnson v.
Heath, 56 F.4th 851, 859–60 (10th Cir. 2022); UMB Bank v. Monson, 21-
CV-2504-EFM (D. Kan. Jun 04, 2025). The FAC’s allegations of ongoing
litigation and the risk of further predicate acts as the divorce case proceeds
to final trial are precisely the type of facts that support open-ended
continuity.
C. Relationship Prong: The Texts and Ongoing Communications
The “relationship” requirement is not a high bar; predicate acts are related
if they share similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods, or
are otherwise interrelated and not isolated events. Bixler v. Foster, 596 F.3d
751, 761 (10th Cir. 2010); Johnson v. Heath, 56 F.4th 851, 859 (10th Cir.
2022). The FAC pleads that the predicate acts—including the text messages
and ongoing communications—are related because they share the same
purpose (fraudulent deprivation of Plaintiff’s property rights), involve the
same participants, target the same victim, and employ similar methods
(deception, misrepresentation, manipulation of legal processes) (FAC ¶¶ 49–
54, 85, 101). The judge’s conclusion that the texts were unrelated to the
litigation is inconsistent with the requirement to accept all well-pleaded
allegations as true and to draw all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff’s
favor at the motion to dismiss stage. Schrag v. Dinges, 788 F.Supp. 1543,
1547 (D. Kan. 1992). The content and context of the communications, as
alleged, plausibly support the inference that they are part of the same
racketeering scheme and serve the same fraudulent purpose.
D. The Law Does Not Require Multiple Victims or Schemes
The Tenth Circuit has recognized that even a scheme targeting one victim
can satisfy the continuity requirement if it contemplates open-ended
fraudulent activity and does not have a single goal that, when achieved, will
bring the activity to an end. Torwest DBC, Inc. v. Dick, 810 F.2d 925, 928
(10th Cir. 1987); Edwards v. First Nat. Bank, Bartlesville, Oklahoma, 872 F.
2d 347, 351 (10th Cir. 1989); Condict v. Condict, 826 F.2d 923, 927 (10th Cir.
1987). The ongoing divorce litigation and the risk of further predicate acts

=== PAGE 27 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
distinguish this case from those where the scheme is truly isolated and
complete.
E. Totality of the Circumstances
Courts are to consider the totality of the circumstances, not just the timing
of the initial predicate acts, in assessing continuity. Fisher Sand & Gravel
Co. v. FNF Constr., Inc., No. 10-cv-0635 RB/SMV (D. N.M. Mar 27, 2013).
Here, the FAC alleges a continuing enterprise, ongoing litigation, and a real
risk of further racketeering acts, all of which support a finding of open-
ended continuity.
F. Pleading Standard and the Role of Discovery
At the motion to dismiss stage, the Court must accept as true all well-
pleaded allegations and draw all reasonable inferences in Plaintiff’s favor. 
George v. Urban Settlement Servs., 833 F.3d 1242, 1248 (10th Cir. 2016); 
Schrag v. Dinges, 788 F.Supp. 1543, 1547 (D. Kan. 1992). The Order failed to
do so, instead characterizing the ongoing conduct as unrelated or merely
retaliatory, without crediting the FAC’s specific allegations that these acts
are part of the same enterprise and serve the same fraudulent purpose. The
pattern requirement is not defeated simply because the initial dispossession
occurred; the ongoing risk of further racketeering, as pleaded, is sufficient
to establish open-ended continuity. Tal v. Hogan, 453 F.3d at 1267–68 (10th
Cir. 2006). The Tenth Circuit has emphasized that deficiencies in the
plaintiff’s case should more appropriately be addressed through summary
judgment after the plaintiff has had an opportunity to substantiate their
allegations through discovery. Schrag v. Dinges, 788 F.Supp. 1543, 1547 (D.
Kan. 1992).
G. Exceptions and Caveats
While courts are cautious about finding RICO continuity in cases involving a
single scheme and a single victim, especially where the scheme is short-lived
and its objective is fully achieved (Skurkey v. Daniel, No. CIV-22-496-R, 2023
WL 101946, at *6 (W.D. Okla. Jan. 4, 2023)), the key distinction here is that
the FAC alleges the scheme is ongoing, the objective is unfulfilled, and the
risk of further predicate acts is real due to the pending litigation.
It should also be noted that Condict v. Condict, 815 F.2d 579 (10th Cir. 1987)
has been stated as superseded by Maxwell v. Wilson, 766 P.2d 909 (N.M.
1988), but this negative treatment does not affect the federal RICO analysis,
as the Tenth Circuit’s approach to open-ended continuity remains consistent
with Supreme Court precedent and has not been overruled.
IV. APPLICATION TO THE COMPLAINT AND ORDER
The FAC alleges that the enterprise’s objective—fraudulent disposition of
property through the divorce—remains unfulfilled, and the risk of further
predicate acts is ongoing (FAC ¶¶ 49–54, 86(ii), 101–102). The Order did not
address these ongoing risks, instead treating the “primary objective” as

=== PAGE 28 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
complete and the scheme as isolated (Order at 6–7). Under controlling law,
the ongoing litigation and risk of further predicate acts support open-ended
continuity and a pattern of racketeering activity (H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern
Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 241–42 (1989); Resolution Trust Corp. v. Stone,
998 F.2d 1534, 1543 (10th Cir. 1993); Tal v. Hogan, 453 F.3d 1244, 1267
(10th Cir. 2006)).
The FAC also pleads that the predicate acts are related: they share the same
purpose (fraudulent deprivation of Plaintiff’s property rights), involve the
same participants (Myers and Branthoover), target the same victim, and
employ similar methods (deception, misrepresentation, manipulation of legal
processes) (FAC ¶¶ 49–54, 85, 101). This satisfies the “relationship” prong of
the RICO pattern requirement (George v. Urban Settlement Servs., 833 F.3d
1242, 1248 (10th Cir. 2016)).
The judge’s conclusion that the texts were unrelated to the litigation is
inconsistent with the requirement to accept all well-pleaded allegations as
true and to draw all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff’s favor at the
motion to dismiss stage (Schrag v. Dinges, 788 F.Supp. 1543, 1547 (D. Kan.
1992)). The content and context of the communications, as alleged, plausibly
support the inference that they are part of the same racketeering scheme
and serve the same fraudulent purpose.
V. CONCLUSION AND PRAYER
For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court
grant this motion for reconsideration, vacate the order of dismissal, require
Defendants to respond to the complaint, and allow the matter to proceed to
discovery.
Respectfully submitted,

Deck v. Engineered Laminates, 349 F.3d 1253 (10th Cir. 2003)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
RICO provides certain advantages to plaintiffs, but it also presents
substantial hurdles for plaintiffs to overcome to establish a proper claim. Of
specific concern on this appeal, RICO requires the plaintiff to prove that the
defendants committed at least two predicate acts (violations of criminal
statutes listed in RICO, § 1961(1)) and that the plaintiff has suffered injury to
his business or property as a result of those predicate acts. ... To state a
RICO claim, a plaintiff must allege that the defendant violated the
substantive RICO statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1962, by setting forth 'four elements:
`(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity.' ... A pattern of racketeering activity must include commission of at
least two predicate acts. ... Also, a plaintiff has standing to bring a RICO
claim only if he was injured in his business or property by reason of the
defendant's violation of § 1962.
Summary
Essential elements required to establish a RICO claim, emphasizing the need
for at least two predicate acts and a direct injury to business or property
resulting from those acts. This aligns with the broader legal standards for
RICO claims, which require a pattern of racketeering activity and a causal
link between the predicate acts and the plaintiff's injury.

Bumgarner v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Kansas, 716 F. Supp. 493 (D.
Kan. 1988)
U.S. District Court — District of Kansas
Extract
In Torwest DBC, Inc. v. Dick, the Tenth Circuit held that a pattern requires
continuous and related acts. 810 F.2d 925, 928 (10th Cir.1987). 'A scheme to
achieve a single discrete objective does not in and of itself create a threat of
ongoing activity, even when that goal is pursued by multiple illegal acts,
because the scheme ends when the purpose is accomplished.' Id. at 929.
Rather than formulate a brightline test, the Torwest court endorsed a case-
by-case approach to determine whether a pattern exists. Id. Given the facts
that the case involved a single scheme with a single victim and a specific,
rather than open-ended goal, the court found no pattern. Id. The Tenth
Circuit reached the same result in the two 'pattern' cases it decided
following Torwest, both times finding that the alleged scheme had a single,
discrete objective.
Summary
The Tenth Circuit requires continuous and related acts to establish a RICO
pattern. A single scheme with a single discrete objective does not create a
threat of ongoing activity, even if pursued by multiple illegal acts, because
the scheme ends when the purpose is accomplished. The Tenth Circuit uses
a case-by-case approach to determine whether a pattern exists, and in cases
with a single scheme and victim, the court has found no pattern if the
scheme has a specific, rather than open-ended, goal.
Wade v. Gaither, 623 F.Supp.2d 1277 (D. Utah 2009)
U.S. District Court — District of Utah
Extract
Plaintiff bases his RICO pattern of racketeering cause of action on
underlying allegations that Defendant committed multiple instances each of
extortion under § 18 U.S.C. § 1951; mail fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1341; and
wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343. In order to state a pattern of
racketeering activity claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5) and survive a motion
to dismiss under FED.R.CIV.P. 12(b)(6), Plaintiff must initially allege facts
sufficient to support at least two predicate acts. Extortion, mail fraud, and
wire fraud all constitute § 1961 RICO predicates. Merely pleading two
predicate acts, however, will not support a finding that a pattern of
racketeering activity exists. Rather, Plaintiff must also demonstrate 'that the
racketeering predicates are related, and that they amount to or pose a
threat of continued criminal activity,' H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co.,
492 U.S. 229, 240, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989) (emphasis in
original), or 'continuity over a closed period by proving a series of related

=== PAGE 31 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
predicates extending over a substantial period of time,' id at 242, 109 S.Ct.
2893. A series of predicate acts which extend over a few weeks or months
do not establish 'closed-ended' continuity. Id. at 242, 109 S.Ct. 2893.
Summary
To plead a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO, a plaintiff must
allege at least two predicate acts that are related and demonstrate either a
threat of continued criminal activity (open-ended continuity) or continuity
over a closed period (closed-ended continuity). The passage emphasizes that
merely alleging two predicate acts is insufficient; the acts must be related
and pose a threat of continued criminal activity or extend over a substantial
period of time. This aligns with the Supreme Court's decision in H.J. Inc. v.
Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., which is binding precedent.

'pattern' requires at least two predicate acts. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5). In
addition, '[t]o satisfy RICO's pattern requirement, [a plaintiff must] allege

Summary
For a RICO claim to be viable, the plaintiff must demonstrate both
"continuity" and "relationship" among the predicate acts. The "relationship"
test is relatively straightforward, requiring that the acts be interrelated.
However, the "continuity" requirement is more challenging and can be
satisfied by showing either a closed period of repeated conduct or an open-
ended threat of future criminal activity. This understanding is crucial for the
Myers case, as the court's dismissal may have overlooked the ongoing
nature of the alleged racketeering activity and the potential for future
predicate acts, which could satisfy the open-ended continuity requirement.

(quoting Boone v. Carlsbad Bancorporation, Inc., 972 F.2d 1545, 1555 (10th

make up one common scheme. See Sil-Flo, Inc. v. SFHC, Inc., 917 F.2d 1507,
1516 (10th Cir. 1990).
Summary
The relationship requirement for RICO predicates is not difficult to meet;
acts are related if they share similar purposes, results, participants, victims,
or methods, or are otherwise interrelated. This suggests that the judge may
have erred by not considering the broader context and ongoing nature of the
alleged scheme, which could include the texts as part of a common scheme
related to the litigation.

conduct, while open-ended continuity consists of racketeering conduct that
threatens future repetition. Id. Plaintiffs can establish open-ended continuity
by showing that the racketeering acts involved implicit or explicit threats of
repetition, that they formed the operations of an association that exists for
criminal purposes, or that they were the defendants' regular way of
conducting a legitimate enterprise. Id. at 242-43.
Summary
The Tenth Circuit defines the relationship requirement for RICO claims as
not cumbersome, satisfied when predicate acts have similar purposes,
results, participants, victims, or methods, or are otherwise interrelated.
Continuity can be closed-ended or open-ended, with open-ended continuity
established by showing threats of future repetition or that the acts are part
of a regular way of conducting business. This is relevant to the Myers case
because the ongoing nature of the divorce litigation and the risk of further
predicate acts could support a finding of open-ended continuity, as the
enterprise's broader objective remains unfulfilled.

The Defendants first challenge the sufficiency of L3's allegations of
predicate acts of 'racketeering activity.' Under RICO, acts which would
constitute criminal mail or wire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1341 or §
1343, can constitute 'racketeering activity.' 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1) (defining
'racketeering activity'). To plead these predicate acts, L3 must plead facts
showing: (i) Defendants engaged in a scheme to defraud by means of false
pretenses; (ii) the Defendants acted with the requisite intent to defraud; and
(iii) the scheme contemplated the use of mail or wire transactions. Burnett v.
Amrein, 243 Fed.Appx. 393, 395 (10th Cir. 2007)(unpublished). Under Fed.
R. Civ. P. 9(b), allegations of fraud must be pled with particularity, and thus,

N.M. Mar 27, 2013)
U.S. District Court — District of New Mexico
Extract
To establish a substantive RICO violation, a plaintiff must show that there
was 'a pattern of racketeering activity.' 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). At least two
predicate acts of racketeering activity are required but not necessarily
sufficient to demonstrate a pattern. Heinrich v. Waiting Angels Adoption
Servs., Inc., 668 F.3d 393, 409 (6th Cir. 2012). 'RICO is not aimed at the
isolated offender,' so, in addition to the predicate acts, a plaintiff must show
that the racketeering predicates are related and amount to 'a threat of
continuing activity.' Tal, 453 F.3d at 1267-68 (quoting Resolution Trust Corp.
v. Stone, 998 F.2d 1534, 1544 (10th Cir. 1993)). This test has come to be
called the 'continuity plus relationship' test. Bixler, 596 F.3d at 761 (quoting
Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., Inc., 473 U.S. 479, 496 n.14 (1985)). The
relationship prong is fairly easy to satisfy: showing that the 'predicate acts
have the same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods
of commission, or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing
characteristics and are not isolated events is essentially all that is needed.'
Id. (quoting Boone v. Carlsbad Bancorp., Inc., 972 F.2d 1545, 1555 (10th Cir.
1992)). The continuity showing, however, is more difficult. It 'is both a
closed- and open-ended concept, referring either to a closed period of
repeated conduct, or to past conduct that by its nature projects into the
future with a threat of repetition.'
Summary
The passage explains the "continuity plus relationship" test required to
establish a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO. It highlights that
while the relationship prong is relatively easy to satisfy, the continuity prong
is more challenging and can be demonstrated through either closed-ended
or open-ended continuity. Open-ended continuity involves showing a threat
of continued criminal activity, which can be established by demonstrating
that the predicate acts are part of an ongoing scheme with no built-in ending
point.

Resolution Trust Corp. v. Stone, 998 F.2d 1534 (10th Cir. 1993)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
The Supreme Court has concluded that Congress intended that the pattern
element 'requires the showing of a relationship between the predicates, ...
and the threat of continuing activity'--that is, 'continuity plus relationship.' ...
'Continuity' is both a closed- and open-ended concept: closed-ended
referring to a closed period of repeated conduct and open-ended referring to
conduct that by its nature projects into the future with a threat of
repetition. ... Open-ended continuity depends upon the facts of each case,
and may be established by showing that the predicates themselves involve a
distinct threat of long-term racketeering activity, either implicit or explicit,
or that the predicates are a regular way of conducting the defendant's
ongoing legitimate business or the RICO enterprise.
Summary
"continuity" in RICO cases can be either closed-ended or open-ended.
Closed-ended continuity involves a series of related predicate acts over a
substantial period, while open-ended continuity involves a threat of future
racketeering activity. The Tenth Circuit emphasizes that open-ended
continuity can be shown by demonstrating that the predicate acts pose a
distinct threat of long-term activity or are part of the regular way of
conducting the defendant's business.

Extract
In this case, the court and the parties assumed for purposes of the court's
ruling that defendants engaged in numerous racketeering acts. It is clear
that when, as here, the acts are part of a common fraudulent scheme, they
satisfy the relationship requirement of Sedima. See, e.g., Superior Oil Co. v.
Fulmer, 785 F.2d 252 (8th Cir.1986). However, to establish a RICO pattern, a
plaintiff must also demonstrate continuity, that is, 'the threat of continuing
activity.' Sedima, 105 S.Ct. at 3285 n. 14. This element is derived from
RICO's legislative history, which indicates that RICO does not apply to
'sporadic activity' or to the 'isolated offender'.
Summary
For a RICO claim to succeed, it is not enough to show that multiple
racketeering acts occurred; there must also be a demonstration of
continuity, meaning a threat of ongoing criminal activity. This requirement is

=== PAGE 36 ===

intended to prevent RICO from being applied to isolated or sporadic criminal
acts. The Tenth Circuit emphasizes that continuity is a crucial element
derived from RICO's legislative history, which aims to target long-term
criminal conduct rather than isolated incidents.
Condict v. Condict, 826 F.2d 923 (10th Cir. 1987)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
The district court in dismissing the action and entering judgment for the
defendants held that the complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief
could be granted. Specifically, the district court held that the complaint
failed to allege the following: ... (2) that the defendants, or any of them, have
been convicted of the predicate acts of mail or wire fraud upon which the
RICO claim is founded; ... defendants, or any of them, with the conduct, or
participation in the conduct, of an enterprise, i.e., Condict Ranches, through
a 'pattern of racketeering activities.' In this connection, our focus is
specifically directed to the phrase 'pattern of racketeering activities,' and,
even more particularly, to the one word 'pattern.' We believe the present
complaint is deficient in these particulars, and that any evidentiary matter
before the district court strengthens that conclusion. The gravamen of the
present complaint is that the defendants engaged in common law fraud, and
deceit and in the course of their conduct used the mails and wires more than
twice. Such in our view does not make out a RICO claim under Sec. 1962(c).
Summary
The Condict v. Condict case emphasizes the necessity of demonstrating a
"pattern of racketeering activity" under RICO, which requires more than
isolated acts of fraud. The court highlighted that merely using the mails and
wires more than twice in the course of common law fraud does not satisfy
the RICO pattern requirement. This case underscores the importance of
showing continuity and relatedness in the alleged racketeering acts, which
is directly relevant to the current motion for reconsideration. The current
motion must address whether the ongoing nature of the alleged enterprise
and the risk of further predicate acts satisfy the continuity and relatedness
requirements under RICO.

predicate acts perpetrated pursuant to a single scheme involving separate
independent harms, such as where multiple victims suffer discrete injuries.
In Torwest DBC, Inc. v. Dick, 810 F.2d 925 (10th Cir.1986), the Tenth Circuit
stressed in a single scheme case that the 'continuity' requirement of pattern
requires demonstration of 'facts from which at least a threat of ongoing
illegal conduct may be inferred,' and that the single scheme would have to
involve 'continuous behavior.' In this case pattern fails because the acts
complained of were not ongoing and could not be said to constitute the
regular way in which defendants conduct business. Here the acts of alleged
securities fraud occurred within an isolated period of four months.
Summary
For a RICO claim involving a single scheme and a single victim, the
continuity requirement can be satisfied if there is a threat of ongoing illegal
conduct, indicating that the scheme involves continuous behavior. The court
in Torwest emphasized that continuity requires more than isolated incidents
and must show a pattern of ongoing conduct.
Skurkey v. Daniel
U.S. District Court — Western District of Oklahoma
Extract
To plead a valid RICO claim, a plaintiff must plausibly allege that a
defendant '(1) conducted the affairs (2) of an enterprise (3) through a
pattern (4) of racketeering activity.' ... An 'enterprise' is 'any individual,
partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or
group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.' ...
'Racketeering activity' consists of the criminal offenses listed in 18 U.S.C. §
1961(1), and a 'pattern' requires at least two racketeering acts committed
within ten years of each other. ... A 'pattern' requires at least two predicate
acts. ... Additionally, a Plaintiff must allege facts from which the Court can
conclude the existence of a pattern, that is that the 'predicates themselves
amount to, or that they otherwise constitute a threat of, continuing
racketeering activity.' H.J., Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co., 492 U.S.
229, 240 (1989) (emphasis original). The Supreme Court has explained that
there are two elements to finding a pattern for RICO purposes: 'continuity
plus relationship.' ... [C]losed-ended continuity consists of a closed period of
repeated, related racketeering acts that do not necessarily threaten future
repetition. ... Because RICO targets long-term racketeering conduct, closed-
ended continuity requires a series of related racketeering acts over a
'substantial period of time.' ... The same holds true if the Court considers
whether Plaintiff has alleged continuity under an open-ended theory because
Plaintiff has not alleged facts that show a clear threat of future criminal
conduct related to past criminal conduct. ... Courts have uniformly and
consistently held that schemes involving a single, narrow purpose and one
or few participants directed towards a single victim do not satisfy the RICO
requirement of a closed or open pattern of continuity.

Summary
Detailed explanation of the requirements for establishing a pattern of
racketeering activity under RICO. It emphasizes the need for at least two
predicate acts that are related and continuous. The passage distinguishes
between closed-ended continuity, which requires a series of related acts
over a substantial period, and open-ended continuity, which requires a
threat of continued criminal activity. It also notes that schemes with a single,
narrow purpose directed at a single victim typically do not satisfy the
continuity requirement.

"‘Continuity’ is both a closed-and open-ended concept: closed-ended
referring to a closed period of repeated conduct and open-ended referring to
conduct that by its nature projects into the future with a threat of
repetition.” Resol. Tr. Corp. v. Stone, 998 F.2d 1534, 1543 (10th Cir. 1993).
“A party alleging a RICO violation may demonstrate continuity over a closed
period by proving a series of related predicates extending over a substantial
period of time.” Id. A closed-ended series of predicate acts is not sufficient
to support a finding of a pattern of racketeering activity, however, where
those acts “constitute[ ] a single scheme to accomplish ‘one discrete goal,’
directed at one individual with no potential to extend to other persons or
entities.” ... Open-ended continuity “may be established by showing that the
predicates themselves involve a distinct threat of long-term racketeering
activity, either implicit or explicit, or that the predicates are a regular way of
conducting the defendant’s ongoing legitimate business or the RICO
enterprise.” Resol. Tr., 998 F.2d at 1543. “Open-ended continuity requires a
clear threat of future criminal conduct related to past criminal conduct.”
Phelps v. Wichita Eagle-Beacon, 886 F.2d 1262, 1273 (10th Cir. 1989).
Summary
The Tenth Circuit defines "continuity" in RICO cases as encompassing both
closed-ended and open-ended concepts. Closed-ended continuity involves a
series of related predicate acts over a substantial period, but it is insufficient
if the acts are part of a single scheme with a discrete goal directed at one
individual. Open-ended continuity, on the other hand, can be established by
showing a distinct threat of long-term racketeering activity, either implicit or
explicit, or that the predicates are a regular way of conducting the
defendant's business. This requires a clear threat of future criminal conduct
related to past conduct.

UMB Bank v. Monson, 21-CV-2504-EFM (D. Kan. Jun 04, 2025)
U.S. District Court — District of Kansas
Extract
To state a 'pattern' of racketeering activity, the plaintiff must allege 'at least
two acts of racketeering activity... which occurred within ten years.'
Moreover, 'a RICO pattern requires that the racketeering predicates relate
to each other and amount to a threat of continued racketeering activity. No
pattern exists without this ‘continuity plus relationship.’' As to the
relationship requirement, predicate acts satisfy this element when they
make up one common scheme. Racketeering predicates relate to each other
if they 'have the same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or
methods of commission, or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing
characteristics and are not isolated events.' 'The relationship test is not a
cumbersome one for a RICO plaintiff.' ... Next, the Court turns to the
continuity requirement. Under this prong, a plaintiff must allege that the
acts amounted to or threaten continued racketeering activity. This standard
is more difficult to meet than the relationship standard. Either 'open-ended'
or 'closed-ended' continuity can satisfy the continuity prong.
Summary
To establish a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO, a plaintiff must
demonstrate both a relationship and continuity among the predicate acts.
The relationship prong is satisfied when the acts are part of a common
scheme and share similar purposes, participants, or methods. The continuity
prong, which is more stringent, requires showing that the acts either
amount to or threaten continued racketeering activity, which can be
demonstrated through either open-ended or closed-ended continuity.

In H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106
L.Ed.2d 195 (1989), the Supreme Court reiterated the well-established
concept that racketeering acts form a 'pattern' in RICO where they exhibit
'continuity plus relationship.' Id. at 239, 109 S.Ct. at 2900. The 'relationship'
requirement is satisfied when the racketeering acts have 'the same or
similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of commission, or
otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not
isolated events.' Id. at 240, 109 S.Ct. at 2901 (citing Sedima, 473 U.S. at 496
n. 14, 105 S.Ct. at 3285 n. 14). With respect to the 'continuity' requirement,
the Supreme Court stated that the predicate acts must amount to, or pose a
threat of, continuing racketeering activity. Id. According to the Supreme
Court, continuity 'is both a closed- and open-ended concept, referring to a

closed period of repeated conduct, or to past conduct that by its nature
projects into the future with a threat of repetition.' Id. A RICO plaintiff 'may
demonstrate continuity over a closed period by proving a series of related
predicates extending over a substantial period of time.' Id. Predicates
extending over merely a few weeks or months, on the other hand, may
satisfy the continuity element if there is a threat of repetition in the future.
This latter concept of continuity, which occurs over an 'open period,' is
established by showing that the predicate acts are a 'regular way of
conducting the enterprise's ongoing business.'
Summary
For a RICO pattern to exist, there must be both continuity and relationship
among the predicate acts. The relationship is established when acts have
similar purposes or are interrelated, while continuity can be shown through
either a closed period of repeated conduct or an open-ended threat of future
racketeering. This understanding is crucial for assessing whether a RICO
claim is adequately pleaded.

Continuity is both a closed and open-ended concept, referring either to a
closed period of repeated conduct, or to past conduct that by its nature
projects into the future with a threat of repetition. It is, in either case,
centrally a temporal concept—and particularly so in the RICO context,
where what must be continuous, RICO's predicate acts or offenses, and the
relationship these predicates must bear one to another, are distinct
requirements. H.J., 492 U.S. at 241-42, 109 S.Ct. 2893. Here, Plaintiffs
vaguely contend that their complaint sufficiently alleges both a closed and
open-ended scheme. (Pls.' Resp. to Def. M. Larsen's Br. at 8-9.) Thus, I
evaluate both concepts. 'A party alleging a RICO violation may demonstrate
continuity over a closed period by proving a series of related predicates
extending over a substantial period of time. Predicate acts extending over a
few weeks or months and threatening no future criminal conduct do not
satisfy this requirement.' H.J., 492 U.S. at 241-42, 109 S.Ct. 2893. The facts,
as alleged by Plaintiffs, do not satisfy the continuity requirement. Plaintiffs
have not sufficiently pled a threat of 'future criminal conduct.' See id.
Plaintiffs essentially allege a closed-ended series of predicate acts.
Summary
Continuity in a RICO claim can be established through either a closed period
of repeated conduct or an open-ended threat of future criminal activity. The
court emphasizes that continuity is a temporal concept, and a series of
predicate acts over a short period without a threat of future conduct does

In order to bring a RICO claim, a plaintiff must allege a violation of 18 U.S.C.
§ 1962, which consists of four elements: '(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3)
through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity.' ... 'Racketeering activity' is
defined in 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1)(B) as any 'act which is indictable' under
federal law and specifically includes mail fraud and wire fraud. ...
Additionally, a plaintiff must plead the predicate acts of fraud in a RICO
claim with particularity. ... To satisfy the particularity requirements of Rule
9(b), where, as here, mail and wire fraud are alleged as predicate acts of a
RICO claim, the plaintiff must specify the time, place, and content of the
alleged false representation, the identity of the party making the false
statements and the consequences thereof, and how the particular mailing or
transaction furthered the fraudulent scheme. ... RICO defines 'pattern of
racketeering activity' as requiring 'at least two acts of racketeering activity'
within a ten-year period. ... Even if defendants' acts ... were related as part
of a common scheme, plaintiff has failed to allege that they pose a threat of
continuing criminal activity. In a RICO case, the complaint must allege
continuity.
Summary
To successfully plead a RICO claim, a plaintiff must allege a violation of 18
U.S.C. § 1962, which includes demonstrating a pattern of racketeering
activity. This pattern requires at least two predicate acts of racketeering
activity, such as mail or wire fraud, within a ten-year period. The plaintiff
must plead these predicate acts with particularity, specifying details such as
time, place, and content. Additionally, the complaint must allege continuity,
meaning the acts pose a threat of ongoing criminal activity, to satisfy the
RICO pattern requirement.

states that a pattern 'requires at least two acts of racketeering activity,' Sec.

1961(5) (emphasis added), not that it 'means' two such acts. The implication
is that while two acts are necessary, they may not be sufficient. Indeed, in
common parlance two of anything do not generally form a 'pattern.' The
legislative history supports the view that two isolated acts of racketeering
activity do not constitute a pattern. As the Senate Report explained: 'The
target of [RICO] is thus not sporadic activity. The infiltration of legitimate
business normally requires more than one 'racketeering activity' and the
threat of continuing activity to be effective. It is this factor of continuity plus
relationship which combines to produce a pattern.' ... A more difficult
question is presented when the RICO claim is based on one scheme
involving one victim, but the plan contemplates open-ended fraudulent
activity and does not have a single goal that, when achieved, will bring the
activity to an end. Some courts have found that such an ongoing scheme is
itself sufficient to satisfy the continuity element of a RICO pattern.
Summary
Under the Tenth Circuit's interpretation, a "pattern of racketeering activity"
requires more than just two isolated acts; it requires continuity and
relationship. The court acknowledges that a single scheme targeting one
victim can still meet the continuity requirement if it involves open-ended
fraudulent activity without a single, finite goal. This interpretation aligns
with the legislative intent to target ongoing criminal conduct rather than
isolated incidents.

Summary
The Tenth Circuit requires a plaintiff to allege both a relationship between
predicate acts and a threat of continuing racketeering activity to satisfy the
RICO pattern requirement. This involves demonstrating that the predicate
acts are related and that there is either a closed period of repeated conduct
or an open-ended threat of future racketeering. The passage emphasizes the
need for "continuity plus relationship" to establish a pattern, which is crucial
for a RICO claim.

ICO's pattern requirement: '[c]riminal conduct forms a pattern if it
embraces criminal acts that have the same or similar purposes, results,
participants, victims, or methods of commission, or otherwise are
interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not isolated
events.' (58) The 'continuity' prong is satisfied by proof of either closed-
ended continuity or open-ended continuity. Closed-ended continuity in the
RICO context may be demonstrated 'by proving a series of related
predicates extending over a substantial period of time.' (59) Open-ended
continuity in the RICO context is conduct that may last only a short period of
time but nonetheless, poses a threat of extending into the future. (60) The
Court suggested a case-by-case examination of this issue, noting that the
existence of a 'threat of continued racketeering activity' is a function of
particular facts. (61) The Court offered a non-exhaustive list of situations
that may constitute a pattern (62) and stated 'development of these concepts
must await future cases.' (63) ... The Tenth Circuit has posited a multi-factor
approach in its relationship analysis but looks mainly at two factors:
duration and extensiveness. See Resolution Trust Corp. v. Stone, 998 F.2d
1534, 1543 (10th Cir. 1993) (holding duration and extensiveness 'are
particularly relevant to the determination of continuity'); see also Tal v.
Hogan, 453 F.3d 1244, 1268 (10th Cir. 2006) ('To determine continuity we
examine both the duration of the related predicate acts and the
extensiveness of the RICO enterprise's scheme.'). Extensiveness is
determined by considering the number of victims, the number of acts, the
variety of acts, the distinctiveness of the injuries, and the complexity of the
scheme. See Resolution Trust, 998 F.2d at 1543.
Summary
The RICO pattern requirement involves two prongs: relationship and
continuity. The relationship prong is satisfied when criminal acts have
similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods, or are otherwise
interrelated. The continuity prong can be satisfied by either closed-ended
continuity (a series of related predicates over a substantial period) or open-

In H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co., the Court held that the
government must establish both a relationship between the predicate acts
and continuity of those acts to prove a 'pattern of racketeering activity' for
RICO purposes. Although these two requirements, referred to as the
'continuity plus relationship' test, must be separately established, the Court
has recognized that evidence on these two prongs often will overlap. The
'continuity' prong is satisfied by proof of either closed-ended continuity or
open-ended continuity. Closed-ended continuity is defined as 'a series of
related predicates extending over a substantial period of time.' Open-ended
continuity is defined as conduct that may last only a short period of time but
nonetheless, poses a threat of extending into the future.
Summary
To establish a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO, both the
relationship and continuity of predicate acts must be demonstrated. The
relationship prong requires that the acts have similar purposes, results,

either closed-ended continuity (a series of related acts over a substantial

Summary
The "continuity plus relationship" test requires both elements to be proven,
though they may overlap. Continuity can be established through either
closed-ended or open-ended means. Open-ended continuity involves a threat
of future racketeering activity, which is assessed on a case-by-case basis.
This is particularly relevant in ongoing litigation, where the threat of
continued criminal conduct may be more apparent.

The "continuity plus relationship" test requires both a connection between
predicate acts and a demonstration of continuity, which can be either closed-
ended (a series of related acts over time) or open-ended (a threat of future

may be established by showing that the predicate acts pose a threat of
continued criminal activity, especially if the enterprise's objectives remain
unfulfilled.

In the intellectual property arena, courts have reached different conclusions
on the definition of a 'pattern of racketeering activity' within the meaning of
RICO. For example, at least one court has held that the definition is met by a
single scheme to misappropriate trade secrets if there are sufficient
allegations of concerted activity directed toward a goal of injuring the
plaintiff. The plaintiff therein alleged that the defendant's scheme to
misappropriate the plaintiff's trade secrets included multiple mailings and
telephone conversations in violation of the mail and wire fraud statutes
which according to the court established a pattern of racketeering activity.
In contrast, another court held that an isolated criminal episode, though
accomplished through several fraudulent acts, does not establish a 'threat of
continuing criminal activity' so as to give rise to a 'pattern of racketeering
activity' within the meaning of RICO.
Summary
The definition of a "pattern of racketeering activity" under RICO can vary
depending on the court's interpretation. Some courts may find a pattern in a
single scheme if there are multiple acts of fraud, such as mail and wire
fraud, directed toward a specific goal. However, other courts may require
evidence of a threat of ongoing criminal activity to establish a pattern. This
suggests that the determination of a pattern can depend on the specific facts
and allegations of the case, including whether the scheme is ongoing and
poses a threat of future criminal acts.

RICO is not just a tool for government control over organized crime. It is
also a remedial statute for civil matters. (31) It 'authorize[s]... criminal or
civil remedies on conduct already criminal, when performed in a specified
fashion' as delineated by the statute. (32) Section 1962 provides civil
remedies for four types of conduct: (1) using income derived from a pattern
of racketeering activity (33) to acquire an interest in an enterprise; (2)
acquiring or maintaining an interest in an enterprise through a pattern of
racketeering activity; (3) conducting the affairs of an enterprise through a
pattern of racketeering activity; and (4) conspiring to commit any of these
offenses. (34) Today, Congress urges courts to construe RICO liberally from
the 'perspective of the victim, not the perpetrator.' (35) A private civil right
of action in [section] 1964 provides that '[a]ny person injured in his business
or property by reason of a violation of section 1962... may sue.' (36) Notably,
a successful plaintiff under [section] 1964 is entitled to treble damages and
the cost of the suit, including attorney fees. (37) The threat of treble

damages encourages plaintiffs to bring claims and discourages entities from
engaging in illegal activities.
Summary
The passage explains that RICO is designed to provide civil remedies for
conduct that is already criminal when performed in a specified manner. It
emphasizes that RICO should be construed liberally from the victim's
perspective, and that a private right of action is available for any person
injured in their business or property by a RICO violation. This aligns with
the broader understanding that a specific "racketeering injury" is not
required, as long as the plaintiff was injured by the defendant's racketeering
activity.

Finding that Congress in part passed RICO to protect 'American victims at
least against injury caused by the conduct of the affairs of enterprises
through patterns of racketeering activity that occur in this country,' the
court found that 'the focus properly is on the pattern of racketeering activity
and its consequences.' This focus was found to be consistent with the
Supreme Court's 'repeated recognition that the heart of any RICO complaint
is the allegation of a pattern of racketeering,' and therefore, 'if there is a
domestic pattern of racketeering activity, the focus should be on that.'
Summary
The passage emphasizes that the focus of a RICO complaint should be on the
pattern of racketeering activity and its consequences, aligning with the
Supreme Court's view that the core of a RICO complaint is the allegation of
a pattern of racketeering. This focus is intended to protect American victims
from injuries caused by domestic racketeering activities.

SCOTUS Resolves Circuit Split On How To Assess Domestic Injury Under
RICO
Extract
The Supreme Court, building on its holding in RJR Nabisco, Inc. v. European
Community, held in Yegiazaryan v. Smagin that courts must apply a context-
specific test when analyzing whether a RICO plaintiff has sufficiently pled a
domestic injury. ... The Court held that 'determining whether a plaintiff has
alleged a domestic injury [for purposes of RICO] is a context-specific inquiry
that turns largely on the particular facts alleged in a complaint.' ... 'If those
circumstances sufficiently ground the injury in the United States, such that
it is clear the injury arose domestically, then the plaintiff has alleged a
domestic injury.'
Summary
The Supreme Court's decision in Yegiazaryan v. Smagin requires courts to
use a context-specific test to determine if a RICO plaintiff has alleged a
domestic injury. This means that courts must consider the specific
circumstances surrounding the alleged injury to assess whether it arose in
the United States. The decision emphasizes that the analysis is contextual
and that no set of factors can capture the relevant considerations for all
cases, given the expansive range of predicate acts under RICO.

The Defend Trade Secrets Act (DTSA) allows trade secret misappropriation
to be used as a basis for civil RICO claims if the misappropriation qualifies
as a predicate act. This means that violations of the DTSA can potentially
establish a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO, provided that the
other elements of a RICO claim are met. The passage highlights the
importance of demonstrating a pattern of racketeering activity, which
includes at least two related predicate acts that pose a threat of continued
criminal activity.
RICO: A Primer
Extract
A 'pattern' may exist where any combination of two or more offenses
occurred within a period of time. In Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S.
479, the Supreme Court held that the RICO pattern element requires more
than merely proving two predicate acts of racketeering. Rather, proof of
'continuity plus relationship' is necessary. Nonetheless, the Supreme Court
has repeatedly recognized that Congress had a fairly flexible concept of a
pattern in mind. The Supreme Court has stated that: A 'pattern' is an
'arrangement or order of things or activity,'. .. . It is not the number of
predicates but the relationship that they bear to each other or to some
external organizing principle that renders them 'ordered' or arranged. The
Court has further explained that '[C]riminal conduct forms a pattern if it
embraces criminal acts that have the same or similar purposes, results,
participants, victims or methods of commission, or otherwise are
interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not isolated events.'
The racketeering acts need not be similar or directly related to each other;
rather, it is sufficient that the racketeering acts are related in some way to
the affairs of the charged enterprise, including, for example, that: the
racketeering acts furthered the goals of or benefitted the enterprise, the
enterprise or the defendant's role in the enterprise enabled the defendant to
commit, or facilitated the commission of, the racketeering acts, the
racketeering acts were committed at the behest of, or on behalf of, the
enterprise, or the racketeering acts had the same or similar purposes,
results, participants, victims or methods of commission. The continuity
requirement is likewise satisfied where the predicates are a regular way of
conducting the defendant's ongoing legitimate business (in the sense that it
is not a business that exists for criminal purposes), or of conducting or
participating in an ongoing and legitimate RICO 'enterprise.' A plaintiff may
demonstrate a pattern by establishment that the predicate acts pose a threat
of continued criminal activity, which is generally demonstrated by showing
either: * Closed-ended continuity. Proving 'a series of related predicate acts
extending over a substantial period of time.' * Open-ended continuity. A
threat of 'continuing criminal activity extending indefinitely into the future,'
in light of the nature of the enterprise and predicate acts alleged.

Summary
The concept of a "pattern" in RICO cases requires more than just two
predicate acts; it necessitates "continuity plus relationship." The
relationship is established when the acts have similar purposes, results,
participants, victims, or methods, or are otherwise interrelated. Continuity
can be shown through either closed-ended continuity (a series of acts over a
substantial period) or open-ended continuity (a threat of ongoing criminal
activity). This flexible interpretation allows for a broad application in RICO
cases, emphasizing the interconnectedness and ongoing nature of the
criminal conduct.
Defending Civil RICO Claims: A Defense Plan Should Be In Every Business's
Arsenal
Extract
Third, the plaintiff must plead a pattern of racketeering activity for most
RICO claims. If the alleged conduct occurred once or twice, or was not
continuous, it cannot form a pattern of conduct sufficient to support a RICO
claim. And oftentimes, because there is a fraud component, those instances
must be particularly identified in the plaintiff's pleading—a barrier that can
prove difficult to accomplish.
Summary
The passage highlights the necessity for a plaintiff to plead a continuous
pattern of racketeering activity, which involves more than isolated incidents.
This requirement is crucial for establishing a RICO claim, as it demonstrates
the ongoing nature of the alleged criminal conduct. The passage
underscores the importance of identifying specific instances of fraud or
other predicate acts to support the claim.

Summary
The passage highlights the necessity for a plaintiff to establish a pattern of
racketeering activity, which requires more than isolated or infrequent acts.
This requirement can be a significant hurdle for plaintiffs, as they must
demonstrate continuity and relatedness of the alleged acts. The passage also
notes that the fraud component of many RICO claims requires specific
identification in the pleadings, adding another layer of complexity. This
information is crucial for understanding the challenges in proving a RICO
claim and the potential defenses available to challenge the sufficiency of the
allegations.
SCOTUS Clarified RICO's Domestic Injury Requirement, Did Not Create
New Civil Right Of Action For Enforcing Arbitration Awards
Extract
Smagin did not, however, create any new claims or paths to recovery. It
provided an important resolution to a dispute among circuits over whether
RICO's domestic injury requirement (announced in the court's 2016 decision
in RJR Nabisco v. European Community, 579 U.S. 325) prohibits foreign
plaintiffs from bringing civil RICO claims (it does not), but otherwise left the
onerous substantive requirements of a civil RICO claim fully intact. ... The
Supreme Court affirmed the Ninth Circuit's context-specific inquiry, holding
'courts should look to the circumstances surrounding the alleged injury to
assess whether it arose in the United States.' ... However, the Supreme
Court's decision and analysis was limited to the domestic injury
requirement, and the court did not address or in any way modify the myriad
additional hurdles in the path of any civil RICO plaintiff.
Summary
The Supreme Court's decision in Smagin addressed the domestic injury
requirement for civil RICO claims, confirming that foreign plaintiffs can
meet this requirement. However, it did not alter the substantive
requirements for civil RICO claims, which remain burdensome. The decision
emphasized a context-specific inquiry into whether the injury arose in the
United States but did not change the overall difficulty of prevailing on civil
RICO claims.
United States Supreme Court Confirms Foreign Plaintiffs May Use RICO To
Enforce Foreign Arbitral Awards
Extract
In June 2023, the United States Supreme Court (the 'Supreme Court'), in a
6-3 decision in Yegiazaryan v. Smagin et al., provided guidance on the
private cause of action under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt

Organizations Act ('RICO'), and clarified that the domestic injury
requirement is based on a contextual approach considering the
circumstances surrounding the alleged injury. This is an important decision
which: (i) means that foreign plaintiffs can rely on RICO to enforce
international arbitral awards in US courts; and (ii) resolved a Circuit split,
by expressly rejecting the Seventh Circuit's rigid residence-based approach,
and affirmed the contextual approach adopted by the Third and Ninth
Circuits.
Summary
The Supreme Court's decision clarifies that the domestic injury requirement
under RICO should be assessed using a contextual approach, rather than a
rigid residence-based approach. This allows foreign plaintiffs to use RICO to
enforce international arbitral awards in US courts, broadening the
applicability of RICO in such contexts and resolving a previous Circuit split.
