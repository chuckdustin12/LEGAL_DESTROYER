IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRJCT COURT FOR THE WESTERN DISTRJCT
OF OKLAHOMA CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, Plaintiff, vs. DANIEL
KENNETH BRANTHOOVER & MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS
Defendant. ) ) ) ) Case No. CIV-24-1311-R ) ) ) ) DEFENDANT'S MOTION TO
DISMISS FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT COMES NOW Defendant, Daniel
Kenneth Branthoover and Morgan Michelle Myers, pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6)
and Rule 12(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and respectfully
moves this Court to dismiss Plaintiffs First Amended Complaint for failure to
state a claim upon which relief can be granted and for improper venue. In
support thereof, Defendant submits the following Memorandum of Law.
MEMORANDUM OF LAW 1. Plaintiffs First Amended Complaint fails to
allege facts sufficient to support a claim under the Racketeer Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations Act (RJCO), 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961-1968. 1 2. The
Complaint lacks the necessary elements of a RICO claim, including a valid
enterprise, a pattern of racketeering activity, and specific predicate acts. 3.
Plaintiff's allegations are conclusory and speculative, and do not meet the
pleading standards required under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a) and
the Supreme Court's decisions in Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S.
544 (2007), and Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662 (2009). 4. Venue is improper
in the Western District of Oklahoma under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b), as the events
giving rise to the claims occurred primarily outside this district. 5. Failure to
Plead Fraud with Particularity (Rule 9(b)) Plaintiffs allegations of wire fraud,
which form the basis of the alleged RICO predicate acts, fail to meet the
heightened pleading standard of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b ). The
Complaint does not specify the time, place, or content of the alleged
fraudulent communications, nor does it identify the specific roles of each
Defendant in the purported scheme. See Tal v. Hogan, 453 F.3d 1244, 1263
(10th Cir. 2006). 6. Improper Use of Domestic Dispute as Basis for RICO
Plaintiff's allegations arise primarily from a domestic dispute and related
family court proceedings. Courts have consistently held that such disputes
do not constitute the type of organized criminal activity contemplated by
RICO. See Annulli v. Panikkar, 200 F.3d 189, 200 (3d Cir. 1999) (holding that
'garden-variety state law fraud' and domestic disputes are not actionable
under RICO). 2 7. No Standing Under RICO Plaintiff lacks standing to bring
a RICO claim because he has not alleged a concrete injury to business or
property as required under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c). Allegations of emotional
distress, reputational harm, or speculative business losses are insufficient.
See Holmes v. Sec. Investor Prot. Corp., 503 U.S. 258, 268 (1992). 8. Plaintiff
fails to allege continuity ofracketeering activity as required under 18 U.S.C.
§ 1961(5). The alleged conduct spans a short period and does not
demonstrate a threat of ongoing criminal activity. See H.J. Inc. v.
Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 241-42 (1989). 9. Accordingly, the
Complaint should be dismissed in its entirety. WHEREFORE, Defendant
respectfully requests that the Court grant this Motion and dismiss Plaintiffs
First Amended Complaint with prejudice, and for such other relief as the
Court deems just and proper. 1 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 11. At the heart of this litigation lies a
deliberate and orchestrated scheme by Defendants Morgan Michelle Myers
and Daniel Kenneth Branthoover, who strategically chose to displace
Plaintiff from his home and destabilize his financial and familial security.
Branthoover administered and Myers meticulously executed a calculated
plan involving interstate travel, fraudulent affidavits, deliberate perjury,
asset diversion, and systematic manipulation of multiple Texas state courts
to escape accountability for her actions. 12. To carry out this scheme, Myers
enlisted the assistance of Daniel Kenneth Branthoover, a resident of Yukon
Oklahoma, who has a prior history regarding violations of protective orders
and tampering with government documents. For no other reason than to
escape accountability for her affair, Myers spun an elaborate web of lies and
weaponized her family and court procedures designed to help victims of

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
abuse. 13. What emerges from the evidence is not a domestic dispute gone
awry, but a textbook criminal enterprise created within this Court’s
Jurisdiction. This is the story of how a person corruptly influenced the very
courts designed to protect families—transforming them into instruments of
fraud, extortion, and systematic theft. It is a tale of how two individuals,
connected by a common goal, orchestrated a seventeen-month reign of
terror that began in Oklahoma and was carried out in the Texas courts. 14.
The Defendants did not merely lie to courts—they constructed an elaborate
criminal enterprise with defined roles, coordinated operations, and a
singular mission: to strip Plaintiff of everything he held dear through the
systematic corruption of judicial 5 proceedings. They engaged in laundering
funds across state lines while concurrently submitting fraudulent indigency
claims. They did not just fabricate allegations—they manufactured an entire
false narrative of domestic violence, complete with non-existent protective
orders and imaginary threats, all while the supposed "victim" continued to
share a bed with her alleged "abuser." 15. This case shows how the family
court system can be perverted by those willing to commit federal crimes to
achieve their goals. It reveals how easily the sacred trust placed in sworn
affidavits can be shattered by defendants who view perjury not as a crime,
but as a tool. Most importantly, it demonstrates that when domestic
relations become the vehicle for interstate racketeering, federal intervention
is not just appropriate—it is essential. 16. This is not a story about a
marriage that failed. This is simply the product of a litigant who values her
extramarital relationships over morality, and who chose to weaponize her
family against Plaintiff for the sole purpose of escaping accountability. 17.
After extensive research and vigorous advocacy, Plaintiff asserts that
Defendants engaged in racketeering activity through an organized
enterprise, seeking relief to prevent its finalization. Against all odds, and in
support of this preliminary statement, Plaintiff alleges the following: 6 IV.
FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS A. Enterprise Formation and Initial Criminal
Coordination (December 14-15, 2023) 18. Defendant Branthoover possesses
extensive knowledge of protective order procedures and requirements due
to his prior criminal convictions involving violations of such orders. This
knowledge would prove instrumental in the enterprise's systematic
manipulation of protective order proceedings. 19. On December 14, 2023,
immediately following Plaintiff's discovery of Defendant Myers' extramarital
affair, she initiated the criminal enterprise by taking two coordinated
actions: first, she opened a private bank account in her sole name to
facilitate asset concealment; and second, she commenced intensive
interstate communications with Defendant Branthoover via text messaging.
The scope and intensity of these communications—totaling 92 text messages
exchanged between Branthoover's registered number 940-312-3434 and
Myers' registered number 817-235-5189 on this single day—demonstrates
the deliberate and coordinated nature of their criminal planning. 20. While
coordinating with Branthoover, Defendant Myers tried to secure an ex-parte
protective order against Plaintiff, without legitimate cause. This action
marks the enterprise's first attempt to manipulate judicial proceedings
through false allegations. 21. Despite having just sought emergency
protection from Plaintiff hours earlier, Myers casually reminded him of their
child's school field trip scheduled for the following day, thereby creating a
facade of normalcy designed to conceal her fraudulent intentions and
prevent suspicion of the enterprise's activities. 7 B. Interstate Criminal

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Coordination and Financial Crimes (December 15-16, 2023) 22. On
December 15, 2023, at precisely 9:51 A.M. CST, Defendant Branthoover
contacted Plaintiff directly, employing calculated deception by stating, "I've
been where you are before. I want to help both of you." This communication,
referencing Myers' December 1, 2023 divorce announcement, was designed
to establish false pretenses for Myers' planned interstate travel to Oklahoma
for criminal coordination purposes. 23. During this deceptive phone
conversation, Branthoover established the operational framework for the
next phase of the criminal scheme by arranging for Myers to visit his
Oklahoma residence over the weekend of December 15, 2023. The stated
purpose—"providing space" to Myers—was a deliberate misrepresentation
designed to conceal the true criminal purpose of coordinating fraudulent
document preparation and enterprise operations. 24. Having no reason to
suspect Branthoover's dishonest intentions, Plaintiff unwittingly facilitated
the enterprise's criminal coordination by agreeing to Myers' travel to
Oklahoma. 25. Immediately following Branthoover's deceptive phone call,
the enterprise executed its first major financial crime. Plaintiff received
notification that Myers had transferred $1,576 from the parties' joint marital
PNC account to Branthoover's PayPal account (username "dmb575"),
completely depleting the account balance. This interstate wire transfer
represents a critical predicate act, utilizing interstate commerce to further
the criminal scheme while simultaneously depriving Plaintiff of operating
funds necessary for his legitimate business operations, household bills, and
Christmas gifts. 8 26. The immediate and devastating impact of this financial
crime became apparent on December 16, 2023, when Plaintiff received
notification that the joint marital PNC account was overdrawn by $800.00.
Concurrently, Plaintiff discovered that advertisements for his legitimate
home-based business had ceased running due to payment failure directly
caused by the enterprise's theft of operating funds. This demonstrates the
enterprise's deliberate intent to cause maximum financial harm to Plaintiff.
27. The criminal nature of this financial transaction is conclusively
established by documentary evidence. The PNC bank statement for
December 2023 provides irrefutable proof of the unauthorized withdrawal,
documenting the precise date, amount, and destination of the fraudulent
transfer. 28. The direct connection between Defendant Branthoover and this
financial crime is established through multiple forms of evidence. The PayPal
identifier "dmb575" appearing on Plaintiff's bank statement directly
corresponds to Branthoover's PayPal account, creating an unbreakable
evidentiary chain linking him to the illicit financial transaction, corroborated
by his own admissions in subsequent text communications. 29. On December
16, 2023, at precisely 3:54 P.M. CST, Plaintiff made a good-faith attempt to
resolve the situation amicably by sending a detailed text message to
Defendant Branthoover. This communication explicitly requested the return
of the fraudulently transferred $1,576, detailed the intended legitimate use
of these funds, described the financial hardship caused by the theft
(including late bills and business disruption), explained Plaintiff's inability to
work due to the severe emotional distress 9 caused by Defendants' criminal
actions, and expressed his sincere desire for an amicable resolution during
the holiday season. 30. Defendant Branthoover's response to this reasonable
request revealed the true criminal nature of the enterprise. In a callous and
dismissive reply, Branthoover stated, "You Are Getting Divorced..." followed
by, "I hope I can help with the paperwork and make things go as smoothly as

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
possible." Far from the helpful assistance initially promised, this
communication constituted a direct threat and overt act in furtherance of
the criminal conspiracy, demonstrating Branthoover's intent to exploit
Plaintiff's financial distress for the enterprise's benefit while utilizing
interstate communications to further the scheme. 31. This communication
also establishes Branthoover's unauthorized practice of law across state
lines. At no time relevant to this litigation has Defendant Branthoover
possessed a license to practice law in any jurisdiction within the United
States. His statements regarding "paperwork" and making legal proceedings
"go as smoothly as possible" constitute clear evidence of unauthorized legal
practice and demonstrate his administrative role in directing the
enterprise's criminal activities. C. Coordinated Eviction Attempt Fraud and
Interstate Document Transportation (December 17, 2023) 32. On December
17, 2023, at approximately 11:00 A.M., Plaintiff was served with an eviction
notice by the grandmother of Myers, who is also the landlord of the
matrimonial residence, which contained the following false information: i. A
purported “lease violation,” which was entirely fabricated as no 10 valid
lease agreement existed between Plaintiff and Wilson; ii. The assertion that
“Granddaughter getting divorced,” referring to Defendant Myers, as a basis
for eviction; iii. The false claim that a “Protective order has been filed.” iv.
The directive that “He must leave. She and the girls may stay,”
demonstrating the clear intent to dispossess Plaintiff for the benefit of
Myers. 33. The coordinated and premeditated nature of this eviction fraud is
established by the timing of its execution. At the precise moment this
fraudulent notice was being served in Texas, Defendant Myers was
physically present in Oklahoma with Defendant Branthoover, actively
collaborating in the preparation of the very fraudulent court documents
referenced in the eviction notice. 34. Myers' knowledge of the fraudulent
nature of the eviction attempt is conclusively established. She possessed
actual knowledge that no valid lease agreement existed, and she had actual
knowledge that neither divorce proceedings nor protective orders had been
filed at the time of service, making her participation in the eviction fraud a
knowing and willful criminal act. 35. On December 17, 2023, Defendant
Myers completed the interstate transportation phase of the criminal scheme
by transporting the fraudulent court documents prepared in Oklahoma back
across state lines to Texas. These documents, including the Original Petition
for Divorce and Affidavit of Indigency, were specifically 11 prepared with the
intent of submitting them to Texas state courts to further the enterprise's
fraudulent manipulation of judicial proceedings. 36. Upon her return to
Texas, Myers demonstrated her control over the eviction fraud by personally
destroying the fraudulent eviction notice. She physically tore the notice in
half and wrote "VOID" on it in black marker, providing clear evidence of her
influence over and coordination of the fraudulent eviction attempt
orchestrated during her absence in Oklahoma. D. Operational Security and
Document Preparation (December 17-18, 2023) 37. As part of the
enterprise's operational security measures, Defendant Myers returned from
Oklahoma equipped with a canister of pepper spray, designed to support the
false narrative of domestic violence that would be central to the fraudulent
court documents prepared during her Oklahoma visit. 38. During her
Oklahoma visit, Defendant Myers acquired a secondary phone number
(817-940-0852) as a deliberate operational security measure. This
acquisition, which she explicitly disclosed to Plaintiff, constituted an overt

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
act in furtherance of the criminal enterprise, designed to facilitate
clandestine communications related to the fraudulent scheme while
concealing the enterprise's ongoing criminal coordination from detection.
39. This newly acquired secondary phone number became an integral
component of the fraudulent court documents prepared under Defendant
Branthoover's direct administrative oversight. The systematic use of this
number across multiple fraudulent legal documents demonstrates the
coordinated nature of the enterprise's document 12 preparation activities.
These documents, prepared in Oklahoma with the specific intent of
unlawfully influencing Texas legal proceedings, included: i. An "Original
Petition for Divorce" dated December 18, 2023, containing numerous
material false statements designed to deceive the Texas courts; ii. An
"Affidavit of Indigency" dated December 18, 2023, containing deliberate
misrepresentations regarding Myers' financial status to defraud the court of
legitimate filing fees; iii. A "Request for Uncontested Cases" dated
December 18, 2023, fraudulently filed despite the complete absence of any
communication between the parties regarding divorce proceedings; iv. An
"Application for Protective Order" dated December 22, 2023, containing
entirely fabricated allegations of family violence. E. Unauthorized Practice
of Law and Intimidation (December 18, 2023) 42. 40. Following the filing of
the initial fraudulent divorce documents on December 18, 2023, Defendant
Branthoover escalated his unauthorized practice of law by sending Plaintiff a
text message asserting legal representation and attempting to control all
future communications. The message stated: “Charlie, it’s come to my
understanding you have retained an attorney. I’m sure he has told you that
all further communication should take place between attorneys. I must
formally ask you refrain from discussing details of this case with my client
moving forward and only communicate with me or your attorney.” 13 This
communication was a deliberate attempt to isolate Plaintiff from direct
communication with Myers and to control the flow of information, thereby
hindering Plaintiff’s ability to uncover the full extent of the fraudulent
scheme. This communication also evidences that Branthoover’s role went
beyond helping Myers prepare the documents by seeing them through to
their submission and asserting an administrative role over the proceedings
to intimidate Plaintiff. F. Service Through Official Channels and Continued
Deception (December 22-28, 2023) 41. In furtherance of the criminal
scheme, and despite continuing to cohabitate with Plaintiff in the marital
residence, Defendant Myers deliberately utilized official constable service to
effectuate service of the fraudulent divorce petition and protective order
application, which occurred on December 27, 2023. This calculated use of
official legal processes to serve fraudulent documents while maintaining the
deceptive facade of normalcy at home demonstrates the sophisticated and
deliberate nature of the enterprise's operations. 42. The enterprise's
manipulation of official legal processes continued when Myers, despite
residing next door to Plaintiff, deliberately influenced and coordinated the
constable service of the fraudulent eviction documents, which occurred on
December 28, 2023. This systematic abuse of official legal processes while
maintaining physical proximity and continued cohabitation reveals the
calculated and deceptive nature of the enterprise's operations. 14 G.
Systematic False Statements in Sworn Court Documents (December 18,
2023) 43. When reviewing the documents prepared in part by Branthoover
and filed with the court by Myers, there existed several false statements and

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
were intended to deceive the court and prejudice Plaintiff in furtherance of
the scheme to dispose him of his property interests. Specifically, these false
statements included, but were not limited to: i. The assertion that the
spouses had ceased living together on December 1, 2023, when in fact they
were still residing together at the marital home on that date and for several
weeks thereafter. ii. The claim that Defendant Myers owned both family
vehicles as her separate property prior to the marriage, which was
demonstrably false as these vehicles were acquired during the marriage and
constituted community property, paid for by Plaintiff. iii. The representation
that Defendant Myers had an active order of protection against Plaintiff with
a judicial finding that family violence had occurred during the marriage,
which was fabricated and without any basis in fact or law. iv. The assertion
that the children or Defendant Myers would be subjected to harassment or
abuse if Plaintiff were provided with her second phone number
(817-940-0852) acquired in Oklahoma, which was a baseless and
manipulative claim designed to conceal her communications related to the
fraudulent scheme. 15 44. Concurrently with the fraudulent divorce petition,
Defendant Myers, again with the administrative oversight and full
knowledge of Defendant Branthoover, filed a fraudulent “Affidavit of
Indigency” with the court. This affidavit contained material
misrepresentations regarding Defendant Myers’ financial status, all of which
were known to be false at the time of filing and were intended to defraud the
court and avoid legitimate court costs. Specifically, these false statements
included: i. The claim that Defendant Myers was financially indigent and
unable to pay court costs, despite her access to and control over substantial
marital assets. ii. The representation that Defendant Myers was solely
responsible for all family living expenses, including rent, utilities, food, and
other living expenses, when in fact, Plaintiff was the primary breadwinner of
the household at that time. iii. The assertion that Defendant Myers was
solely responsible for both car payments, which she has no payment history
to support such a claim. H. Escalation Through Fabricated Violence
Allegations (December 22, 2023) 45. On December 22, 2023, despite having
claimed in her divorce petition to already possess an active protective order,
Myers filed an "Application for Protective Order," revealing the
contradictory and fabricated nature of her previous representations while
escalating the enterprise's fraudulent manipulation of judicial proceedings.
16 46. Upon review, defendant Myers made additional false statements
within the sworn document, all intended to further deceive the court and
secure an unwarranted protective order against Plaintiff to effectuate the
enterprises’ goal of divesting him of his property interests. These false
statements included, but were not limited to: i. The claim that family
violence occurred on December 18, 2023, in the presence of the children,
which was entirely false and fabricated. ii. The assertion that family violence
occurred prior to December 18, 2023, which was also false and without any
factual basis. iii. The request that Plaintiff take a battering intervention
program. I. Achievement of Primary Criminal Objective (January 16, 2024)
47. On January 16, 2024, the enterprise's criminal scheme achieved its
primary objective when Plaintiff appeared before the 322nd District Court of
Tarrant County and was ordered to vacate the family residence.
Significantly, this order was entered without any evidentiary hearing and
without judicial findings regarding the allegations contained in the
fraudulent documents, demonstrating that the court's decision was based

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
entirely on the false information systematically presented by the
Defendants. 48. The causal relationship between the Defendant’s fraudulent
representations and this judicial outcome is conclusively established. The
misinformation presented to the court through the coordinated fraudulent
documents was the sole basis for the court's decision, providing Myers with
the exact advantage that she and Branthoover had anticipated and planned
through significant and intentional misrepresentations. 17 J. Ongoing
Pattern of Racketeering Activity and Continuity (January 2024 - Present) 49.
Between January 16, 2024, and the present day, Defendants Myers and
Branthoover have continued to further their racketeering activity through a
series of ongoing illicit acts, demonstrating a clear pattern of continuity and
relatedness. These acts include, but are not limited to: i. Myers and
Branthoover continuing to engage in interstate communications regarding
case details between one another across state lines, specifically between
Texas and Oklahoma, in direct furtherance of their fraudulent scheme to see
the divorce through to its finalization. ii. Branthoover delivering ongoing
threats and intimidation to Plaintiff regarding his legitimate attempts to
seek legal relief from the orders that were a product of the Defendants’
actions, which occurred in December of 2023, June of 2024, December of
2024, and May of 2025. iii. Making direct statements such as “I’ve been
enjoying watching every filing get denied” by Branthoover, showing the
malicious intent behind his involvement as Plaintiff sought relief for their
coordinated actions. 50. On June 23, 2024, Defendant Branthoover
continued his pattern of harassment and intimidation by sending Plaintiff a
text message stating, "Lol. And here comes 18 another denial," in direct
reference to Plaintiff's court filing seeking to enjoin Branthoover as a party
to the divorce proceedings. This communication provides conclusive
evidence of Branthoover's continued awareness of and active involvement in
the Texas legal proceedings, his ongoing monitoring of court filings, and his
malicious intent to mock and intimidate Plaintiff's efforts to seek justice
through legitimate legal channels. 51. On December 12, 2024, Branthoover
escalated his threatening communications by sending Plaintiff a message
stating, "When things all over you get to deal with me. Just a heads up,"
demonstrating the enterprise's ongoing criminal intent and explicit threats
of future retaliation against Plaintiff for his efforts to expose and seek relief
from their criminal activities. 52. Most recently, on May 24, 2025,
Branthoover sent Plaintiff a message stating, "Where's my lawsuit? Heard
your vm about me. File it. Let's do this :)" This communication demonstrates
the enterprise's continued operation, Branthoover's ongoing monitoring of
Plaintiff's activities, and his explicit challenge and threat regarding potential
legal action, providing clear evidence of the enterprise's ongoing criminal
intent and the continuing threat posed to Plaintiff. 53. As a direct result of
the actions outlined above, Plaintiff has sustained substantial injury to his
business and property. 54. Plaintiff now turns to discuss the elements of
RICO and the alleged predicate acts committed by the Defendants in this
matter. 19 V. INTRODUCTION TO RICO 55. Plaintiff realleges and
incorporates by reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through
54 above, as if fully set forth herein. 56. The Racketeer Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) requires proof of a "pattern of
racketeering activity," which the Supreme Court has consistently held
consists of two essential elements: relatedness and continuity of predicate
acts. Based on the provided facts and the applicable law, the Defendants'

=== PAGE 9 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
series of related acts spanning from December 2023 through May 2025
(approximately 18 months) satisfies both the relatedness requirement (as
the acts share similar purposes, participants, and methods) and the
continuity requirement (as they extend over a substantial period of time)
necessary to establish a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO as
explained in more detail below. 57. For there to be a pattern of racketeering
activity, there must be conduct committed by an enterprise that is prohibited
under 18 U.S.C. § 1961. In the instant matter, Defendants are alleged to
have committed several predicate acts, including wire fraud, violations of
the Travel Act, and perjury/subordination of perjury to support a pattern of
racketeering activity, as explained in more detail below. VI. PREDICATE ACT
– WIRE FRAUD (18 U.S.C. § 1343) 58. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by
reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 57 above, as if
fully set forth herein. 59. The relevant federal statutes in this analysis are 18
U.S.C. § 1343 (Wire Fraud) and 18 U.S.C. § 1961 (RICO Definitions). 20 60.
Title 18 U.S.C. § 1343 states: "Whoever, having devised or intending to
devise any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or property
by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises,
transmits or causes to be transmitted by means of wire, radio, or television
communication in interstate or foreign commerce, any writings, signs,
signals, pictures, or sounds for the purpose of executing such scheme or
artifice, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years,
or both." 61. The facts above establish all three elements of wire fraud
under 18 U.S.C. § 1343—a scheme to defraud, use of interstate wire
communications, and intent to deprive another of money or property—
qualifying it as a RICO predicate act under 18 U.S.C. § 1961. A. Scheme to
Defraud 62. The first element of wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343 is the
existence of "a scheme to defraud." As noted in United States v. Greenberg,
835 F.3d 295 (2nd Cir. 2016), this constitutes an "essential element" of the
crime. In the present case, Myers transferred $1,576 from a joint marital
PNC account to Branthoover's PayPal account, depleting the account
entirely. This transfer was not an isolated action but was accompanied by "a
series of coordinated text messages and phone calls" between Myers and
Branthoover regarding the scheme, and followed after a deceptive message
was sent from Branthoover to Plaintiff. 63. The coordination between the
parties through multiple communications channels demonstrates a
deliberate plan rather than a spontaneous or inadvertent action. As
articulated in Mail and Wire Fraud, a "scheme to defraud requires a material
falsehood, material misrepresentation, or the concealment of a material
fact." By 21 transferring funds from a joint marital account without apparent
authorization from the joint account holder, Myers engaged in conduct that
reflects the concealment of material facts regarding the disposition of
marital assets. 64. The scheme in this case specifically targeted marital
funds, and community property, which are legally considered shared
property between spouses. By depleting the account, Myers intentionally
deprived the Plaintiff of access to funds to which he was legally entitled.
This satisfies the requirement that the scheme have "money or property as
the object of the scheme" as stated in Smulley v. Fed. Hous. Fin. Agency,
17-2666 (2nd Cir. Oct 05, 2018). B. Use of Interstate Wire Communications
65. The second element of wire fraud requires the "use of the mails or wires
to further the scheme." United States v. Greenberg, 835 F.3d 295 (2nd Cir.
2016). The facts demonstrate that Myers used interstate wire

=== PAGE 10 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
communications in two distinct ways: i. The transfer of $1,576 was
"executed via interstate wire (bank to PayPal)," which constitutes an
electronic transmission across state lines. ii. The transfer "was accompanied
by a series of coordinated text messages and phone calls between Myers (in
Texas) and Branthoover (in Oklahoma) regarding the scheme." 66. Wire
transmissions include interstate telephone calls or electronic transmissions.
Furthermore, internet communications satisfy the interstate nexus 22
requirement, even in the absence of proof that a fraudulent communication
traveled through out-of-state servers. 67. The interstate nature of these
communications is established by the fact that Myers was in Texas while
Branthoover was in Oklahoma during their communications about the
scheme. This satisfies the jurisdictional requirement that the wire
communication cross state lines. C. Intend to Defraud 68. The third element
requires that the defendant acted "with the intent to defraud." As stated in
U.S. v. Blackmon, 839 F.2d 900 (2nd Cir. 1988), the wire fraud statute
requires that the defendant "be a party to some kind of scheme to defraud, a
requirement that includes a high degree of scienter and moral culpability."
69. Here, Branthoover specifically stated that he wanted to help Plaintiff,
which he knew was not a true statement at the time. The fact that text and
phone communications were used to deceive Plaintiff into believing that
Myers’ interstate travel would be beneficial for him further supports a
scheme to defraud, because the transfer of funds occurred after this false
extension of help from Branthoover. 70. In summary, the facts presented
establish all required elements of wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343,
qualifying it as a predicate act for RICO purposes under 18 U.S.C. § 1961,
committed by both Defendants. D. Potential Defenses 71. One potential
defense might be that Myers, as a joint account holder, had legal authority
to transfer funds from the account. However, this authority does not extend
to 23 depleting the account for personal gain in coordination with a third
party with the intent to deprive the other account holder of their rightful
access to the funds. The joint nature of the account creates a fiduciary duty
to act in good faith regarding the shared asset. That fiduciary duty was
willingly violated when Myers chose to transfer the funds to Branthoover’s
PayPal, and then later to herself. The appropriate method would have been
for Myers to transfer the funds directly to herself, but she avoided this to
conceal her bank account information in furtherance of a broader scheme.
72. This argument fails because the proceeds from the transfer were used to
acquire a second phone in furtherance of the broader scheme. VII.
PREDICATE ACT – VIOLATION OF THE TRAVEL ACT (18 U.S.C. § 1952) 73.
Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations contained in
paragraphs 1 through 72 above, as if fully set forth herein. 74. The Travel
Act, codified at 18 U.S.C. § 1952, criminalizes interstate travel or the use of
interstate facilities with the intent to promote, manage, establish, carry on,
or facilitate unlawful activity, followed by the performance or attempted
performance of such acts. According to 18 U.S.C. § 1952: "Whoever travels
in interstate or foreign commerce or uses the mail or any facility in
interstate or foreign commerce, with intent to- ... otherwise promote,
manage, establish, carry on, or facilitate the promotion, management,
establishment, or carrying on, of any unlawful activity, and thereafter
performs or attempts to perform- ... an act described in paragraph or shall
be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both..." 75.
The statute has three essential elements: i. Interstate travel or use of

=== PAGE 11 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
interstate facilities 24 ii. Intent to promote, manage, establish, carry on, or
facilitate unlawful activity iii. Subsequent performance or attempted
performance of acts in furtherance of the unlawful activity 76. For a Travel
Act violation to serve as a RICO predicate act, it must be "indictable" under
18 U.S.C. § 1952. Myers' conduct, as analyzed above, satisfies all elements of
a Travel Act violation: i. Myers engaged in interstate travel between Texas
and Oklahoma. ii. Myers traveled with the specific intent to coordinate the
preparation of fraudulent court documents and execute a criminal scheme.
Under United States v. Compton, 355 F.2d 872 (6th Cir. 1966), this intent
can be inferred from "evidence of a substantial course of illegal conduct,
occurring a reasonable time before and after an act of interstate travel." The
preparation of fraudulent court documents falls within the definition of
"unlawful activity" under the Travel Act, as it involves fraud, which is
indictable under state law. iii. After the interstate travel, Myers engaged in
overt acts to further the unlawful activity by preparing fraudulent legal
documents and coordinating the fraudulent scheme. As U.S. v. Admon, 940 F.
2d 1121 (8th Cir. 1991) clarified, the conduct after travel need not itself be
unlawful but must further the unlawful activity. The preparation and use of
fraudulent documents clearly meet this requirement. 25 77. Given that
Myers' conduct satisfies all elements of a Travel Act violation, this violation
qualifies as an "indictable" offense under 18 U.S.C. § 1952. As such, it
constitutes a valid predicate act for RICO purposes under 18 U.S.C. §
1961(1). 78. The Supreme Court's explanation in Perrin v. United States, 444
U.S. 37 (1979) that the Travel Act was intended to provide "a second layer of
enforcement" for interstate criminal activity underscores the significance of
federalizing crimes that cross state lines. Myers' conduct, involving
interstate travel for the purpose of engaging in fraudulent activities, is
precisely the type of behavior that the Travel Act was designed to address.
VIII. PATTERN OF RACKETEERING ACTIVITY 79. Plaintiff realleges and
incorporates by reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through
78 above, as if fully set forth herein. 80. A "pattern of racketeering activity"
requires at least two acts of "racketeering activity" occurring within a ten-
year period. 18 U.S.C. § 1961 (2025) ("'pattern of racketeering activity'
requires at least two acts of racketeering activity, one of which occurred
after the effective date of this chapter and the last of which occurred within
ten years (excluding any period of imprisonment) after the commission of a
prior act of racketeering activity"). 81. However, the mere existence of two
predicate acts is not automatically sufficient to establish a pattern. As
explained in Bonton v. Archer Chrysler Plymouth, Inc., 889 F.Supp. 995 (S.D.
Tex. 1995): 26 "Although at least two acts of racketeering are necessary to
constitute a pattern, two acts may not be sufficient. Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex
Co., 473 U.S. 479, 496 n. 14, 105 S.Ct. 3275, 3285 n. 14, 87 L.Ed.2d 346
(1985). RICO's legislative history leaves no doubt that 'there is something to
a RICO pattern beyond simply the number of predicate acts involved.'" 82.
Instead, courts have established that to prove a pattern, the predicate acts
must be both related and continuous. Bustos v. Invierte En Tex., 4:22-
CV-02690 (S.D. Tex. Jun 03, 2024) ("To rise to the level of 'racketeering
activity' there must be two or more predicate acts that are: (1) related; and
(2) amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity."). A.
Establishing a Pattern of Racketeering Activity 83. The factual allegations
identify several instances that constitute wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343
and violations of the Travel Act under 18 U.S.C. § 1952: i. The extensive text

=== PAGE 12 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
message communications (92 exchanges) on December 14, 2023, between
Myers and Branthoover using interstate wire facilities to coordinate their
scheme. ii. Branthoover's deceptive phone call to Plaintiff on December 15,
2023, where he falsely stated, "I've been where you are before. I want to
help both of you," to facilitate Myers' interstate travel to Oklahoma. iii. The
interstate wire transfer of $1,576 from the joint marital account to
Branthoover's PayPal account, which was executed to deprive Plaintiff of
funds. 27 iv. Branthoover's text messages to Plaintiff on December 16, 2023,
refusing to return the transferred funds and offering to "help with the
paperwork." v. Branthoover's text message on December 18, 2023, falsely
claiming to be a legal representative. vi. The ongoing interstate
communications between Myers and Branthoover to further their fraudulent
scheme, continuing through May 2025. 84. The factual allegations also
demonstrate potential Travel Act violations: i. Myers' interstate travel from
Texas to Oklahoma on December 15, 2023, with the intent to prepare
fraudulent court documents. ii. The interstate transportation of fraudulent
documents from Oklahoma back to Texas on December 17, 2023, intended
for filing in Texas courts. iii. The use of interstate facilities (phone calls, text
messages) to coordinate and further the fraudulent scheme. B. Relatedness
of Predicate Acts 85. The predicate acts of wire fraud and Travel Act
violations are clearly related, meeting the standard outlined in Bonton v.
Archer Chrysler Plymouth, Inc., 889 F.Supp. 995 (S.D. Tex. 1995). They
share: 28 i. Common Purpose: All acts were directed toward depriving
Plaintiff of his property rights and manipulating judicial proceedings to
benefit Myers in divorce proceedings. ii. Same Participants: Myers and
Branthoover were the consistent actors in all predicate acts. iii. Same
Victim: All acts targeted Plaintiff, causing him financial harm and depriving
him of legal rights. iv. Similar Methods: The acts consistently involved
deception, misrepresentation, and the manipulation of legal processes. v.
Temporal Connection: The acts occurred in a logical sequence, beginning on
December 14, 2023, and continuing through May 2025. C. Continuity of
Racketeering Activity 86. The pattern of racketeering activity demonstrates
both closed-ended and open-ended continuity: i. Closed-ended Continuity:
The scheme extends over a substantial period—from December 2023
through May 2025, over eighteen months. This satisfies the requirement for
"a series of related predicate acts extending over a substantial period of
time" as described in RICO: A Primer (2022).2 2 https://freemanlaw.com/
rico-a-primer/ 29 ii. Open-ended Continuity: The scheme also poses a threat
of continued criminal activity. Branthoover's message on May 24, 2025,
demonstrating continued monitoring of Plaintiff's activities and threatening
future retaliation, indicates that the racketeering activity could continue
indefinitely given that they are unable to finalize the divorce. This satisfies
the alternative requirement for "a threat of continuing criminal activity
extending indefinitely into the future" noted in RICO: A Primer (2022). D.
Role of Perjury and Subornation of Perjury 87. While perjury and
subornation of perjury in state court proceedings are not themselves listed
as predicate acts under RICO, they form an integral part of the overall
criminal scheme and help establish the pattern of racketeering activity when
considered alongside the actual predicate acts of wire fraud and Travel Act
violations. 88. As explained in RICO: A Primer (2022), racketeering acts
need not be similar or directly related to each other; they must simply be
"related in some way to the affairs of the charged enterprise." The perjury

=== PAGE 13 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
and subornation of perjury evident in the fraudulent court filings—including
the false statements in the divorce petition, the Affidavit of Indigency, and
the Application for Protective Order—are directly related to the predicate
acts of wire fraud and Travel Act violations. They share the same purpose,
involve the same participants, target the same victim, and form part of the
same overall scheme. For example: 30 i. The fraudulent court documents
were prepared during Myers' interstate travel to Oklahoma, connecting the
perjury to the Travel Act violation. ii. The false statements in these
documents were discussed and planned via interstate wire communications,
connecting the perjury to the wire fraud. iii. The deceptive interstate wire
transfer of funds was executed to support Myers during the divorce
proceedings initiated through fraudulent filings. iv. The perjerous
statements were influenced by Branthoover, connecting subordination of
perjury to the predicate acts. 89. These connections demonstrate how the
non-predicate acts of perjury committed by Myers and subornation of
perjury alleged against Branthoover, while not sufficient alone to establish a
RICO violation, contribute to the overall pattern of racketeering activity
when combined with the predicate acts of wire fraud and Travel Act
violations alleged by the Defendants. IX. ESTABLISHING AN ASSOCIATE-
IN-FACT ENTERPRISE 90. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference
the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 89 above, as if fully set
forth herein. 31 A. Formation of the Enterprise 91. The factual allegations
demonstrate the formation of an associate-in-fact enterprise between Myers
and Branthoover that satisfies the definition in 18 U.S.C. § 1961 (2025). i.
Myers and Branthoover associated for the common purpose of depriving
Plaintiff of his property rights through the manipulation of legal
proceedings. This shared objective is evident from their coordinated actions
beginning on December 14, 2023, immediately following Plaintiff's discovery
of Myers' affair. ii. Though informal, the enterprise had a clear
organizational structure as 1) Myers acted as the "inside" operative, with
direct access to marital assets and the ability to file fraudulent court
documents in Texas. 2) Branthoover served as the "outside" operative,
providing administrative oversight, expertise on protective orders due to his
prior criminal history (Paragraph 18), and a base of operations in Oklahoma.
3) Their respective roles complemented each other and demonstrated an
organized approach to their criminal scheme. iii. The enterprise functioned
as a continuing unit from December 2023 through May 2025, with
consistent roles and coordinated actions throughout this period. 32 B.
Maintenance of the Enterprise 92. The enterprise was maintained through
several key mechanisms: i. Continuous Communication: Myers and
Branthoover maintained regular interstate communications throughout the
scheme, beginning with the 92 text messages on December 14, 2023, and
continuing through May 2025. ii. Financial Support: The interstate wire
transfer of $1,576 from the joint marital account to Branthoover's PayPal
account provided financial resources to support the enterprise's activities.
iii. Operational Security Measures: The enterprise implemented specific
measures to protect its operations: 1) Myers acquired a secondary phone
number during her Oklahoma visit (Paragraph 38). iv. Myers returned with
pepper spray to support the false domestic violence narrative (Paragraph
37). v. Branthoover attempted to control communications by falsely claiming
legal representation (Paragraph 40). vi. Geographic Distribution: The
enterprise maintained operations across state lines, with activities in both

=== PAGE 14 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Texas and Oklahoma, enhancing its ability to avoid detection and complicate
legal responses. 33 C. Enterprise Distinct from Racketeering Activity 93. As
Allstate Ins. Co. v. Donovan, CIVIL ACTION NO. H-12-0432 (S.D. Tex. Jul 03,
2012) reiterates, a RICO enterprise must be an entity ‘separate and apart
from the alleged pattern of racketeering’—not merely a conduit for the
predicate acts themselves. The nature and duration of the Myers–
Branthoover operation exhibits all three required elements: a separate
organizational purpose, defined roles within an enduring structure, and
coordinated decision-making extending beyond the January 16, 2024 initial
outcome, with the finalization of the scheme still pending. X. CLAIMS FOR
RELIEF COUNT 1: VIOLATION OF 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) Against All
Defendants 94. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the
allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 93 above, as if fully set forth
herein. 95. At all relevant times, Plaintiff was a person within the meaning of
18 U.S.C. §§ 1961(3) and 1964(c). 96. At all relevant times, each Defendant
was a person within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961(3) and 1962(c). 97. As
set forth above, Defendants Myers and Branthoover formed an association-
in-fact enterprise within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4) (the
"Enterprise"). The Enterprise was engaged in, and its activities affected,
interstate commerce. 98. The Enterprise had an ascertainable structure
separate and apart from the pattern of racketeering activity in which the
Defendants engaged. The Enterprise 34 maintained an existence beyond
that which was necessary to commit the predicate acts constituting the
pattern of racketeering activity. 99. In furtherance of the fraudulent scheme,
each Defendant conducted or participated, directly or indirectly, in the
conduct of the Enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity
within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961(1), 1961(5), and 1962(c). 100. As
detailed above, the Defendants committed multiple related acts of wire
fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1343 and Travel Act violations under 18
U.S.C. § 1952, and further committed acts of perjury and subordinated
perjury in furtherance of the scheme, constituting a pattern of racketeering
activity as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5). 101. The predicate acts committed
by the Defendants were related to each other in that they had the same or
similar purposes (to defraud Plaintiff of his property interests and
manipulate judicial proceedings), involved the same participants
(Defendants Myers and Branthoover), targeted the same victim (Plaintiff),
employed similar methods (deception, misrepresentation, and manipulation
of legal processes), and were not isolated events. 102. The predicate acts
committed by the Defendants demonstrate both closed-ended continuity,
spanning over eighteen months from December 2023 through May 2025,
and open-ended continuity, as evidenced by the ongoing threats and
monitoring activities continuing through May 2025, with the potential for
continued criminal activity in the future. 35 103. The Defendants
participated in the operation and management of the Enterprise by making
decisions on behalf of the Enterprise and by directing its affairs. Specifically:
i. Defendant Myers directed the Enterprise by initiating the criminal
scheme, communicating the scheme's objectives to Branthoover, opening a
private bank account, transferring marital funds, traveling interstate to
coordinate fraudulent document preparation, and filing fraudulent legal
documents in Texas courts. ii. Defendant Branthoover directed the
Enterprise by providing administrative oversight of the scheme, offering his
expertise on protective order procedures, coordinating Myers' interstate

=== PAGE 15 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
travel, receiving and retaining fraudulently transferred funds, preparing
fraudulent legal documents, and attempting to exert control over
communications related to the legal proceedings. 104. As a direct and
proximate result of the Defendants' violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), Plaintiff
has been injured in his business and property in an amount to be determined
at trial. Specifically, Plaintiff has suffered: i. Loss of $1,576 fraudulently
transferred from the joint marital account; ii. Business losses resulting from
the disruption of his home-based business operations; iii. Additional financial
damages resulting from the overdrawn account 36 and associated fees; iv.
Loss of real and personal property rights through the fraudulent
manipulation of judicial proceedings; vi. Ongoing damages resulting from
the continued operation of the Enterprise. 105. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §
1964(c), Plaintiff is entitled to recover from the Defendants threefold the
damages sustained, explained in more detail below. COUNT 2: VIOLATION
OF 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d) Against All Defendants 106. Plaintiff realleges and
incorporates by reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through
105 above, as if fully set forth herein. 107. Beginning on December 14,
2023, and continuing through at least May 24, 2025, the Defendants
knowingly, willfully, and unlawfully conspired to violate 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c),
that is, to conduct and participate, directly and indirectly, in the conduct of
the affairs of the Enterprise, through a pattern of racketeering activity, in
violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d), as explained above. 108. The conspiracy
between Myers and Branthoover was formed on or about December 14,
2023, evidenced by the intensive communications (92 text messages)
exchanged between them immediately following Plaintiff's discovery of
Myers' extramarital affair. These communications—documented in Plaintiff’s
possession and available for production at the appropriate stage—
demonstrate the deliberate and coordinated formation of the conspiracy. 37
109. Each Defendant agreed that they would commit at least two acts of
racketeering activity in the conduct of the affairs of the Enterprise. The
agreement can be inferred from the Defendants' coordinated actions,
including: i. The systematic coordination of their activities through
interstate communications; ii. The division of responsibilities within the
Enterprise; iii. The implementation of operational security measures; iv. The
consistent pattern of actions furthering the fraudulent scheme; v. The
ongoing coordination over an eighteen-month period. 110. In furtherance of
the conspiracy, the Defendants committed numerous overt acts, including
but not limited to: i. Myers opening a private bank account to facilitate asset
concealment on December 14, 2023 and sharing these details with
Branthoover; ii. Myers and Branthoover exchanging 92 text messages on
December 14, 2023, to coordinate their criminal plans; iii. Branthoover
placing a deceptive phone call to Plaintiff on December 15, 2023; iv. Myers
executing an interstate wire transfer of $1,576 to Branthoover's PayPal
account on December 15, 2023; v. Myers traveling interstate to Oklahoma
on December 15, 2023, to coordinate with Branthoover; vi. Myers and
Branthoover preparing fraudulent court documents in 38 Oklahoma on
December 16-17, 2023 to be later submitted in Texas courts on December
18,22; vii. Myers transporting the fraudulent documents back to Texas on
December 17, 2023; viii. Branthoover sending threatening text messages to
Plaintiff on December 18, 2023; ix. Myers filing fraudulent documents with
Texas courts on December 18, 2023; x. Myers filing a fraudulent Application
for Protective Order on December 22, 2023; xi. Branthoover continuing to

=== PAGE 16 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
send threatening communications to Plaintiff through May 24, 2025. 111. As
a direct and proximate result of the Defendants' conspiracy in violation of 18
U.S.C. § 1962(d), Plaintiff has been injured in his business and property. The
injuries suffered by Plaintiff include but are not limited to: i. Loss of $1,576
fraudulently transferred from the joint marital account; ii. Business losses
resulting from the disruption of his home-based business operations; iii.
Additional financial damages resulting from the overdrawn account and
associated fees; iv. Loss of real and personal property rights through the
fraudulent 39 manipulation of judicial proceedings; v. Ongoing economic
harm resulting from the continued operation of the Enterprise. 112.
Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c), Plaintiff is entitled to recover from the
Defendants threefold the damages sustained, explained in more detail below.
XI. Damages 113. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the
allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 112 above, as if fully set forth
herein. 114. As a direct result of the racketeering activity alleged herein, the
Plaintiff has sustained substantial injury to his business operations, suffered
significant credit decrease, has lost business opportunities, had his personal
belongings destroyed, has had one vehicle repossessed, and has been
subject to transient and unstable housing. A. Damage to Business
Operations 115. In January of 2021, Plaintiff founded a digital financial
analytics business from his home, focused on delivering real-time stock
market data, automated technical indicators, and live market commentary to
retail traders and boutique investment groups across the United States and
Canada. His monetization model included tiered subscription plans, custom
data feed licensing, and API endpoints that offered real-time market data.
116. By 2022, client demand and revenue growth began outpacing Plaintiff’s
initial architecture. In response, Plaintiff made the strategic decision to
pause direct monetization in early 2023 to reinvest in infrastructure and
ensure the platform could handle commercial-scale traffic. This included: 40
i. Designing and deploying asynchronous financial signal algorithms, ii.
Mastering asynchronous programming, PostgreSQL and NoSQL systems for
storage and efficiency purposes, iii. Building websocket-based dashboards
for live data streaming, iv. Drafting licensing terms for premium indicator
access and reseller API use. v. Building partnerships and affiliations with
similar businesses in the market-data space. This period of reinvestment
came at significant cost: Plaintiff temporarily sacrificed a revenue stream
that had reached $12,000 per month at its peak in exchange for long-term
scalability. Plaintiff anticipated a short-term revenue dip, which he
strategically absorbed in reliance on his imminent reentry to market. 117.
By September of 2023, Plaintiff had completed core backend optimization
and UI integrations and obtained an affiliate marketing partnership with
polygon.io and was prepared to scale user acquisition and marketing. This
readiness marked a significant inflection point in Plaintiff’s commercial
trajectory. 118. Plaintiff reasonably projected a return to $9,000–$10,000/
month by mid-2024, with a 24-month growth model targeting $170,124.59 in
revenue through subscriptions and data services alone. This forecast was
based not on speculation, but on verified revenue history, platform
readiness, and documented user engagement trends. 119. As part of
Defendants’ coordinated scheme to deprive Plaintiff of his home and
operational capacity, Plaintiff was wrongfully and suddenly removed from
the family 41 residence in January 2024, despite Defendants’ full knowledge
that he operated an active and income-generating business from that

=== PAGE 17 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
location. This action caused a direct and immediate injury to Plaintiff’s
business, cutting off his ability to scale as planned. Instead of growing,
Plaintiff’s revenue collapsed. 120. The removal was executed without
warning or legal justification and had an immediate effect on Plaintiff’s
operations. Although the core data systems were technically portable, the
business depended on commercial-grade internet, low-latency upload
speeds, and a consistent, uninterrupted digital environment to support real-
time financial analytics, streaming, and API-based services. Following the
removal, Plaintiff was unable to find alternate housing with sufficient
bandwidth. Attempts to work from temporary family residences failed, as
Plaintiff’s usage either exceeded available internet capacity or interfered
with household connectivity, making it impossible to maintain stable service.
Without the ability to stream, deliver data products, or support his clients,
Plaintiff's revenue quickly declined and client engagement deteriorated.
121. Between September and December 2023, Plaintiff earned $10,529.72,
averaging $2,632.43 per month – his baseline earnings during the period of
restructuring. Based on past performance, technical stability, and confirmed
subscriber growth through marketing strategies, Plaintiff reasonably
projected returning to $5,000/month by mid-2024, with stable, scalable
performance continuing through 2025. 122. Under a conservative model,
had the business not been disrupted by Defendants’ interference, Plaintiff
would have earned: 42 i. Approximately $15,794.58 during the first half of
2024 (maintaining his pre-removal baseline), ii. Approximately $24,000.00
during the second half of 2024 (with moderate growth to $4,000/month), iii.
And approximately $60,000.00 across 2025 (at $5,000/month). This yields a
total projected income of $99,794.58 for the 18-month period following the
wrongful removal. 123. Accordingly, Plaintiff seeks recovery of $99,794.58 in
lost business income directly caused by Defendants’ pattern of racketeering
activity described above. B. Damages – Fraudulent Transfer and Cessation of
Business Advertisements 124. As noted above, Defendants coordinated in
emptying the joint marital PNC bank account, transferring $1,576.00 from
Plaintiff to a PayPal account controlled by Daniel Kenneth Branthoover,
which was subsequently routed to Morgan Michelle Myers. These funds
were used to purchase a second phone for Myers, enabling concealed
communication and coordination between Defendants in furtherance of their
scheme to defraud Plaintiff and obstruct his business operations.
Accordingly, Plaintiff therefore seeks recovery of the full amount of
$1,576.00. D. Damages – Total 126. As a direct result of the Defendants’
coordinated and fraudulent conduct detailed above, Plaintiff has sustained
total economic losses in the amount of one hundred and one thousand three
hundred seventy dollars and fifty-eight cents. ($101,370.58). This 43
includes: i. $99, 794.58 in lost business income caused by Defendant’s
actions leading to Plaintiff’s wrongful removal from his residence and the
destruction of his operational infrastructure over the last 18 months; ii.
$1,576.00 in marital funds fraudulently transferred from Plaintiff’s joint
bank account in furtherance of a scheme to defraud. 127. Pursuant to 18
U.S.C. § 1964(c), Plaintiff is entitled to treble damages for injuries sustained
to his business and property because of Defendants’ racketeering activity.
Accordingly, Plaintiff seeks an award of treble damages in the total
estimated amount of three hundred and four thousand, one hundred and
eleven dollars and seventy-four cents ($304,111.74) to be further clarified at
trial. 128. All damages referenced herein are based on verifiable records

=== PAGE 18 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
and financial documentation. Plaintiff will produce supporting evidence and
exhibits at the appropriate stage of these proceedings or at trial. XII.
PRAYER FOR RELIEF 129. WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Charles Dustin Myers
respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment against Defendants

TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS RESEARCH, GRANT OR DENY THE MOTION
TO DISMISS AND STATE WHY
Answer (United States)
Short response
The Defendants' Motion to Dismiss should be denied because Plaintiff has
adequately pled the essential elements of a RICO claim, including an
enterprise engaged in interstate commerce, a pattern of racketeering
activity with sufficient continuity and relatedness, and concrete injury to
business and property, while the Western District of Oklahoma is a proper
venue under 18 U.S.C. § 1965(a) as a substantial part of the alleged criminal
enterprise's activities occurred there.
Summary
Plaintiff Charles Dustin Myers has filed a civil RICO action against
defendants Daniel Kenneth Branthoover and Morgan Michelle Myers,
alleging they formed a criminal enterprise to defraud him through various
interstate activities, including wire fraud and violations of the Travel Act.
The complaint details how the defendants allegedly coordinated across state
lines to transfer funds from a joint marital account, prepared fraudulent

=== PAGE 19 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
court documents, and filed false statements in Texas courts, which
ultimately resulted in the plaintiff being removed from his home and
suffering substantial business losses.
The defendants' motion to dismiss under Rules 12(b)(6) and 12(b)(3) argues
that the complaint fails to state a RICO claim and that venue is improper in
the Western District of Oklahoma. However, after analyzing the relevant
statutes and legal standards, I find that the plaintiff has sufficiently alleged
facts that, if proven true, would establish all elements required for a civil
RICO claim, including specific predicate acts, a pattern of racketeering
activity with both relatedness and continuity, an enterprise separate from
the pattern of racketeering activity, and concrete injuries to business and
property. Additionally, venue is proper in the Western District of Oklahoma
under 18 U.S.C. § 1965(a) because defendant Branthoover resides there and
substantial activities forming the alleged enterprise occurred within that
district.
Background and Relevant Law
Federal Jurisdiction and Venue for RICO Claims
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) provides
federal courts with jurisdiction over civil claims brought by persons injured
in their business or property by violations of the statute. Under 28 U.S.C. §
1331, "The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions
arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States." This
establishes federal question jurisdiction over RICO claims, which arise
under federal law.
Venue for RICO actions is specifically addressed in 18 U.S.C. § 1965(a),
which states: "Any civil action or proceeding under this chapter against any
person may be instituted in the district court of the United States for any
district in which such person resides, is found, has an agent, or transacts his
affairs." This venue provision is broader than the general venue statute and
provides specific authorization for RICO claims to be brought in districts
where any defendant resides or conducts activities.
The general venue statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b), provides that a civil action
may be brought in "a judicial district in which any defendant resides, if all
defendants are residents of the State in which the district is located;" or "a
judicial district in which a substantial part of the events or omissions giving
rise to the claim occurred."
Elements of a Civil RICO Claim
To establish a RICO violation under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), a plaintiff must
prove several elements. According to RICO: A Primer (2022), these elements
include:
"Existence of an enterprise;"
1. 

=== PAGE 20 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
"The enterprise engaged in, or its activities affected, interstate or
foreign commerce;"
"The defendant was employed by or was associated with the
enterprise;"
"The defendant conducted or participated, either directly or indirectly,
in the conduct of the affairs of the enterprise;" and
"The defendant participated in the affairs of the enterprise through a
pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt."
Additionally, for a plaintiff to have standing to bring a civil RICO claim, 18
U.S.C. § 1964(c) requires that a person be "injured in his business or
property by reason of a violation of section 1962." The statute provides that
such a person "may sue therefor in any appropriate United States district
court and shall recover threefold the damages he sustains and the cost of
the suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee."
Pattern of Racketeering Activity
A "pattern of racketeering activity" is a central element of a RICO claim.
According to 18 U.S.C. § 1961, this requires "at least two acts of
racketeering activity, one of which occurred after the effective date of this
chapter and the last of which occurred within ten years (excluding any
period of imprisonment) after the commission of a prior act of racketeering
activity."
However, as noted in RICO: A Primer (2022), establishing a pattern requires
more than just two predicate acts. The predicate acts must demonstrate
both relatedness and continuity:
"A plaintiff may demonstrate a pattern by establishment that the predicate
acts pose a threat of continued criminal activity, which is generally
demonstrated by showing either:
Closed-ended continuity. Proving 'a series of related predicate acts
extending over a substantial period of time.'
Open-ended continuity. A threat of 'continuing criminal activity
extending indefinitely into the future,' in light of the nature of the
enterprise and predicate acts alleged."
Predicate Acts Under RICO
18 U.S.C. § 1961 defines "racketeering activity" to include numerous federal
and state offenses. Relevant to this case are wire fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343)
and violations of the Travel Act (18 U.S.C. § 1952).
Wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343 occurs when someone "having devised or
intending to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money
or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or
promises, transmits or causes to be transmitted by means of wire, radio, or
television communication in interstate or foreign commerce, any writings,
signs, signals, pictures, or sounds for the purpose of executing such scheme
or artifice."

The Travel Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1952, prohibits anyone who "travels in interstate
or foreign commerce or uses the mail or any facility in interstate or foreign
commerce, with intent to... otherwise promote, manage, establish, carry on,
or facilitate the promotion, management, establishment, or carrying on, of
any unlawful activity, and thereafter performs or attempts to perform" acts
in furtherance of that unlawful activity.
Pleading Standards for RICO Claims
Civil RICO claims must satisfy the pleading requirements set forth in Bell
Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly and Ashcroft v. Iqbal. As explained in Sylvester v.
Parexel Int'l LLC, these cases "have heightened the pleading requirements
established in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure" such that "[f]actual
allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative
level" and must be sufficient "to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its
face." The court further clarified that "A claim has facial plausibility when
the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the
reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct
alleged."
Analysis
Subject Matter Jurisdiction
The court has subject matter jurisdiction over this case pursuant to 28
U.S.C. § 1331, as the plaintiff's claims arise under federal law, specifically
the RICO Act. Additionally, 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c) explicitly grants federal
district courts jurisdiction over civil RICO actions, stating that any person
injured in business or property by reason of a RICO violation "may sue
therefor in any appropriate United States district court."
Venue Analysis
The defendants argue that venue is improper in the Western District of
Oklahoma under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b), claiming that the events giving rise to
the claims occurred primarily outside this district. However, RICO has its
own venue provision that takes precedence in this case.
Under 18 U.S.C. § 1965(a), venue is proper in "any district in which such
person [i.e., the defendant] resides, is found, has an agent, or transacts his
affairs." Here, defendant Branthoover is alleged to be "a resident of the
state of Oklahoma and is domiciled in Canadian County," which falls within
the Western District of Oklahoma. This alone would make venue proper
under the RICO venue provision.
Moreover, the complaint alleges that substantial activities related to the
enterprise occurred in Oklahoma, including:
Myers' travel to Oklahoma to meet with Branthoover on December 15,
2023
The preparation of allegedly fraudulent court documents in Oklahoma
1. 
2. 

=== PAGE 22 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Branthoover's receipt of funds transferred from the joint marital
account while in Oklahoma
The planning and coordination of the alleged scheme from
Branthoover's residence in Oklahoma
These activities constitute a substantial part of the events giving rise to the
claims. Therefore, venue is proper in the Western District of Oklahoma
under both 18 U.S.C. § 1965(a) and 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2).
Sufficiency of RICO Allegations
The defendants argue that the plaintiff's complaint fails to allege facts
sufficient to support a RICO claim, specifically challenging the existence of a
valid enterprise, a pattern of racketeering activity, and specific predicate
acts. I will address each element in turn.
1. Existence of an Enterprise
To establish a RICO violation, the plaintiff must first demonstrate the
existence of an "enterprise." According to CIVIL RICO SUITS AGAINST
HARM-CAUSING MARIJUANA OPERATIONS: MOMTAZ1 FAMILY, LLC V.
WAGNER AS A CASE STUDY, an "enterprise" can be "an individual, a legal
entity, like a corporation, or 'any union or group of individuals associated in
fact although not a legal entity.'"
The plaintiff alleges that Myers and Branthoover formed an association-in-
fact enterprise with a common purpose of depriving the plaintiff of his
property rights through the manipulation of legal proceedings. The
complaint details their coordinated activities, including:
Extensive communications (92 text messages exchanged on December
14, 2023)
Interstate travel for coordination purposes
Transfer of funds between them
Preparation and filing of allegedly fraudulent documents
Continued coordination over an 18-month period
These allegations, if proven true, would establish an association-in-fact
enterprise with a structure distinct from the pattern of racketeering activity
itself. The complaint identifies different roles for each defendant (Myers as
the "inside" operative with access to marital assets and Texas courts, and
Branthoover as the "outside" operative providing administrative oversight
and expertise on protective orders), which demonstrates an organizational
structure sufficient to constitute an enterprise.
2. Interstate Commerce
The enterprise must engage in or affect interstate commerce. The complaint
alleges numerous interstate activities, including:
Interstate wire transfers of funds
Interstate phone calls and text messages
3. 
4. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 

=== PAGE 23 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Physical travel between Texas and Oklahoma
Preparation of documents in Oklahoma for filing in Texas courts
These allegations sufficiently establish the interstate commerce element
required for a RICO claim.
3. Predicate Acts
The plaintiff must allege specific predicate acts that qualify as "racketeering
activity" under 18 U.S.C. § 1961. The complaint identifies two primary
categories of predicate acts: wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343 and
violations of the Travel Act under 18 U.S.C. § 1952.
Wire Fraud
The complaint alleges several instances of wire fraud, including:
The interstate wire transfer of $1,576 from the joint marital PNC
account to Branthoover's PayPal account
Deceptive interstate phone calls from Branthoover to the plaintiff
Text messages containing allegedly false statements intended to further
the fraudulent scheme
To constitute wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343, these communications must
be part of a "scheme or artifice to defraud" and must use interstate wire
communications "for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice." The
complaint provides specific details about these communications, including
dates, content, and their role in the alleged scheme to defraud the plaintiff
of his property rights.
The defendants argue that these allegations fail to meet the heightened
pleading standard required for fraud claims under Rule 9(b). However, the
complaint provides specific details about the wire transfer, including the
exact amount ($1,576), the date (December 15, 2023), the source and
destination accounts (joint marital PNC account to Branthoover's PayPal
account), and the alleged fraudulent purpose (to deprive the plaintiff of
funds needed for his business operations). Similarly, the complaint details
specific text messages and phone calls, including dates and content.
These allegations are sufficiently particular to satisfy Rule 9(b)'s
requirement that fraud be pled with specificity.
Travel Act Violations
The complaint also alleges violations of the Travel Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1952,
which prohibits interstate travel or the use of interstate facilities with the
intent to promote unlawful activities.
Specifically, the complaint alleges that Myers traveled from Texas to
Oklahoma on December 15, 2023, with the purpose of coordinating the
preparation of fraudulent court documents and furthering the scheme to
defraud the plaintiff. After this travel, she allegedly engaged in overt acts to
• 
• 
1. 
2. 
3. 

=== PAGE 24 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
further the unlawful activity, including preparing fraudulent court
documents and returning to Texas with those documents, which were
subsequently filed in Texas courts.
These allegations, if proven true, would establish violations of the Travel
Act, which qualifies as a predicate act under RICO.
4. Pattern of Racketeering Activity
To establish a "pattern of racketeering activity," the plaintiff must
demonstrate both relatedness and continuity among the predicate acts.
Relatedness
According to RICO: A Primer (2022), the predicate acts need not be similar
in nature but must be "related in some way to the affairs of the charged
enterprise." The complaint alleges that all the predicate acts were related to
the common purpose of depriving the plaintiff of his property rights through
the manipulation of legal proceedings. Each act allegedly involved the same
participants (Myers and Branthoover), targeted the same victim (the
plaintiff), and employed similar methods (deception, misrepresentation, and
manipulation of legal processes).
These allegations sufficiently establish the relatedness requirement for a
pattern of racketeering activity.
Continuity
RICO: A Primer (2022) explains that continuity can be demonstrated
through either closed-ended continuity ("a series of related predicate acts
extending over a substantial period of time") or open-ended continuity ("a
threat of continuing criminal activity extending indefinitely into the future").
The complaint alleges that the defendants' activities spanned from
December 2023 through May 2025, a period of approximately 18 months.
This timeframe is substantial enough to satisfy the closed-ended continuity
requirement. Additionally, the complaint alleges ongoing threats and
monitoring activities by Branthoover as recently as May 24, 2025,
suggesting a threat of continued criminal activity that could satisfy the
open-ended continuity requirement.
The defendants argue that the alleged conduct spans only a short period and
does not demonstrate a threat of ongoing criminal activity. However, the 18-
month timeframe alleged in the complaint is substantially longer than what
courts typically consider a "short period" for RICO purposes, and the alleged
ongoing threats suggest potential future criminal activity.
5. Standing - Injury to Business or Property
For civil RICO claims, 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c) requires that the plaintiff be
"injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962."

=== PAGE 25 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
According to Defending RICO Claims In The Business Context Part II: RICO
Claims Must Allege Injury To Business Or Property, "the plaintiff must
plausibly allege that his injury animating the RICO claim is associated with
his business or property by reason of the defendant's violation of the RICO
laws."
The complaint alleges specific injuries to the plaintiff's business and
property, including:
Loss of $1,576 from the joint marital account
Disruption to his home-based business operations after being removed
from his residence
Lost business income of approximately $99,794.58 due to inability to
operate his digital financial analytics business
Loss of personal property rights through the fraudulent manipulation of
judicial proceedings
These alleged injuries are concrete and economic in nature, rather than
emotional or speculative, and are directly tied to the defendants' alleged
RICO violations. The plaintiff has provided specific details about his business
operations, including past revenue figures and projections based on
historical performance.
The defendants argue that the plaintiff has not alleged a concrete injury to
business or property as required under RICO. However, the detailed
allegations regarding the impact on the plaintiff's digital financial analytics
business and the specific financial losses claimed are sufficient to establish
standing at the pleading stage.
Domestic Dispute Defense
The defendants argue that the plaintiff's allegations arise primarily from a
domestic dispute and related family court proceedings, which they claim do
not constitute the type of organized criminal activity contemplated by RICO.
However, the RICO statute itself does not contain any exemption for
activities arising from domestic disputes.
According to PAYORS, PLAYERS, AND PROXIMATE CAUSE, "Congress
urges courts to construe RICO liberally from the 'perspective of the victim,
not the perpetrator.'" This suggests that the focus should be on the nature of
the alleged activities and their impact on the victim, rather than the
relationship between the parties.
While it is true that courts have been cautious about applying RICO to what
might be characterized as "garden-variety" disputes, the allegations in this
case go beyond a simple domestic disagreement. The complaint alleges an
organized scheme involving interstate travel, wire transfers, coordination
between multiple parties, and systematic fraud spanning 18 months. These
allegations, if proven true, would constitute the type of organized, ongoing
criminal activity that RICO was designed to address.
As noted in RICO - the rejection of an economic motive requirement, "the
fact that RICO has been applied in situations not expressly anticipated by
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 

=== PAGE 26 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Congress does not demonstrate ambiguity. It demonstrates breadth." The
breadth of RICO allows it to be applied to various situations involving
patterns of racketeering activity, regardless of whether they arise from
domestic disputes or other contexts.
Pleading Standards
The defendants argue that the plaintiff's allegations are conclusory and
speculative, failing to meet the pleading standards established in Twombly
and Iqbal. However, the complaint contains detailed factual allegations
regarding specific events, communications, and actions taken by the
defendants.
According to Sylvester v. Parexel Int'l LLC, "A claim has facial plausibility
when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the
reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct
alleged." The plaintiff's complaint includes specific dates, amounts, names,
and descriptions of activities that, if proven true, would establish each
element of a RICO violation.
For example, the complaint alleges:
Specific text messages and phone calls with dates and content
A precise amount ($1,576) transferred from a specific account to
another on a specific date
Detailed descriptions of Myers' travel to Oklahoma and the activities
conducted there
Specific court filings containing allegedly fraudulent statements
These allegations provide sufficient factual detail to "raise a right to relief
above the speculative level" and to state a claim that is "plausible on its
face."
Conclusion
Based on the analysis of the relevant law and the allegations in the
complaint, the defendants' motion to dismiss under Rules 12(b)(6) and 12(b)
(3) should be denied.
The Western District of Oklahoma is a proper venue for this action under 18
U.S.C. § 1965(a) because defendant Branthoover resides in that district, and
substantial activities related to the alleged enterprise occurred there.
The complaint sufficiently alleges facts that, if proven true, would establish
all elements required for a civil RICO claim:
The existence of an enterprise with a structure distinct from the
pattern of racketeering activity
The enterprise's engagement in or effect on interstate commerce
Specific predicate acts of wire fraud and Travel Act violations, pled
with sufficient particularity

=== PAGE 27 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
A pattern of racketeering activity demonstrating both relatedness and
continuity
Concrete injuries to the plaintiff's business and property caused by the
alleged RICO violations
While the underlying facts may involve a domestic dispute, the allegations
suggest an organized scheme involving interstate activities and systematic
fraud that goes beyond a typical family law matter. The breadth of RICO
allows it to be applied to such situations when the statutory elements are
satisfied.
The plaintiff's detailed factual allegations are sufficient to meet the pleading
standards established in Twombly and Iqbal, providing enough specificity to
make his claims plausible on their face.
Therefore, the defendants' motion to dismiss should be denied, and the case
should proceed to discovery to allow the plaintiff an opportunity to prove his
allegations.
Legal Authorities
18 U.S.C. § 1962 18 U.S.C. § 1962 Prohibited Activities
Extract
It shall be unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any
enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign
commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of
such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity or
collection of unlawful debt.
Summary
The passage from 18 U.S.C. § 1962 outlines the unlawful conduct related to
racketeering activities, which is central to the Plaintiff's allegations in the
First Amended Complaint. The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendants engaged
in a pattern of racketeering activity, which includes wire fraud and violations
of the Travel Act, in furtherance of a scheme to defraud him. The passage
provides the legal basis for the Plaintiff's claims under RICO, as it prohibits
conducting or participating in an enterprise's affairs through a pattern of
racketeering activity. The Defendants' motion to dismiss argues that the
Plaintiff's complaint fails to state a claim under RICO, lacks necessary
elements, and is based on a domestic dispute. However, the Plaintiff's
detailed allegations, if proven, could potentially satisfy the elements of a
RICO claim, including the existence of an enterprise, a pattern of
racketeering activity, and specific predicate acts.

Summary
18 U.S.C. § 1343 defines wire fraud as a federal crime involving the use of
wire communications to execute a scheme to defraud. This is directly
relevant to the allegations made by the plaintiff, Charles Dustin Myers, who
claims that the defendants engaged in wire fraud as part of a RICO violation.
The passage provides the legal basis for considering wire fraud as a
predicate act under RICO, which is central to the plaintiff's claims.
18 U.S.C. § 1965 18 U.S.C. § 1965 Venue and Process
Extract
18 U.S.C. § 1965 Venue and Process: (a) Any civil action or proceeding under
this chapter against any person may be instituted in the district court of the
United States for any district in which such person resides, is found, has an
agent, or transacts his affairs. (b) In any action under section 1964 of this
chapter in any district court of the United States in which it is shown that
the ends of justice require that other parties residing in any other district be
brought before the court, the court may cause such parties to be summoned,
and process for that purpose may be served in any judicial district of the
United States by the marshal thereof.
Summary
The passage provides guidance on the venue for civil actions under the
RICO Act, stating that such actions can be instituted in any district where
the defendant resides, is found, has an agent, or transacts affairs.
Additionally, it allows for parties residing in other districts to be summoned
if the ends of justice require it. This is relevant to the question of whether
the venue is proper in the Western District of Oklahoma for the RICO claim
brought by the plaintiff.

Summary
The U.S. Code provides a civil remedy for individuals injured in their
business or property due to a violation of section 1962, which pertains to
RICO violations. This allows individuals to sue in federal court and recover
treble damages and costs. This is relevant to the plaintiff's claims under
RICO, as it establishes the legal basis for seeking damages in federal court.

Summary
28 U.S.C. § 1331 grants federal district courts original jurisdiction over civil
actions that arise under the laws of the United States. Since the RICO Act is
a federal statute, any civil action brought under it would fall under the
jurisdiction of the federal district courts. Therefore, the United States
District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma would have jurisdiction
over the civil RICO action filed by Charles Dustin Myers, as it arises under
federal law.

Summary
The Travel Act criminalizes interstate travel or the use of interstate facilities
with the intent to promote or facilitate unlawful activities. In the case of
Charles Dustin Myers, the allegations include interstate travel and
communications between Texas and Oklahoma to further a fraudulent
scheme. The Travel Act could apply if the activities fall under the definition
of "unlawful activity," which includes acts indictable under certain federal
statutes. The case involves allegations of wire fraud and potentially other
unlawful activities that could be considered under the Travel Act.
28 U.S.C. § 1391 28 U.S.C. § 1391 Venue Generally
Extract
A civil action may be brought in- a judicial district in which any defendant
resides, if all defendants are residents of the State in which the district is
located; a judicial district in which a substantial part of the events or
omissions giving rise to the claim occurred, or a substantial part of property
that is the subject of the action is situated; or if there is no district in which
an action may otherwise be brought as provided in this section, any judicial
district in which any defendant is subject to the court's personal jurisdiction
with respect to such action.
Summary
Criteria for determining proper venue in civil actions. It states that a civil
action may be brought in a judicial district where any defendant resides if all
defendants are residents of the state where the district is located, or where
a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim
occurred. In this case, the defendants are residents of different states
(Oklahoma and Texas), and the events giving rise to the claim occurred
primarily in Texas. Therefore, the Western District of Oklahoma may not be
the proper venue under 28 U.S.C. § 1391 unless it can be shown that a
substantial part of the events occurred there or that the defendants are
subject to the court's personal jurisdiction.

Summary
Comprehensive list of activities that qualify as "racketeering activity" under
the RICO Act. This includes a wide range of criminal acts such as murder,
kidnapping, bribery, extortion, fraud, and others, which are chargeable
under state or federal law and punishable by imprisonment for more than
one year. The passage is essential for understanding what constitutes
racketeering activity under the RICO Act.

otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not
isolated incidents, provided at least one of such acts occurred after July 1,
1980, and that the last of such acts occurred within four years, excluding
any periods of imprisonment, after the commission of a prior act of
racketeering activity; ... 'Racketeering activity' means to commit, to attempt
to commit, or to solicit, coerce, or intimidate another person to commit any
crime which is chargeable by indictment under the laws of this state
involving: ... (xxv) Perjury and other related offenses in violation of Article 4

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
of Chapter 10 of this title; ... (C) 'Racketeering activity' shall also mean any
conduct defined as 'racketeering activity' under 18 U.S.C. Section18 1961 ,
any violation of 18 U.S.C. Section18 1028, or any violation of 31 U.S.C.
Sections31 5311 through 31 5330.
Summary
The passage provides definitions relevant to racketeering activity, including
the requirement of engaging in at least two acts of racketeering activity that
are related and not isolated. It also specifies that perjury and related
offenses can be considered racketeering activity. This is relevant to the case
at hand, as the plaintiff alleges a pattern of racketeering activity involving
wire fraud and other offenses. The passage helps clarify what constitutes a
pattern of racketeering activity and what acts can be considered as such
under both state and federal law.
18 U.S.C. § 1963 18 U.S.C. § 1963 Criminal Penalties
Extract
Whoever violates any provision of section 1962 of this chapter shall be fined

convenience of the defendant, any victim, and the witnesses, and the prompt
administration of justice.
Summary
The venue for prosecution should be in the district where the offense was
committed unless otherwise permitted by statute or rules. The court must
consider the convenience of the parties involved and the administration of
justice when setting the trial location. This is relevant to the motion to
dismiss for improper venue, as it provides the legal basis for determining
the appropriate venue for the case.
RICO - the rejection of an economic motive requirement.
Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology - Northwestern University,
School of Law - Randolph, Jennifer G. - 1995-03-22
Extract
The court further explained that, 'the fact that RICO has been applied in
situations not expressly anticipated by Congress does not demonstrate
ambiguity. It demonstrates breadth.' ... The Court rejected a narrow reading
of the phrase 'pattern of racketeering activity,' holding that it does not
require proof of 'multiple illegal schemes' or that the predicate acts be
'indicative of an organized crime perpetrator.' Instead, the Court settled on a
broad meaning for 'pattern of racketeering' that requires a 'plaintiff or
prosecutor [merely to] prove [a] continuity of racketeering activity, or its
threat, simpliciter.'
Summary
RICO's application is broad and does not require the predicate acts to be
indicative of organized crime or multiple illegal schemes. The focus is on
proving continuity of racketeering activity or its threat. This interpretation
supports the idea that RICO can be applied to a wide range of situations,
including those not traditionally associated with organized crime.
Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy
The Brief - American Bar Association - 2024-01-01
Extract
RICO’s broad definition of racketeering activity and the act’s reference to
mail and wire fraud as predicate offenses begs the question: Why not RICO?
That is, should the plaintiff consider adding a RICO count to an existing
state cause of action? Moreover, since an action under RICO arises under
federal law, a plaintiff can elect to have access to federal court. Civil RICO is

=== PAGE 35 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
so broad and offers such a potentially broad pathway to pleading of such a
claim in light of the inclusion of mail and wire fraud as predicate acts that a
plaintiff can take almost any given set of facts and fashion their pleadings
and be... RICO’s prohibitions may be enforced in both criminal and civil
contexts. In the context of a civil action, a plaintiff must be directly injured
by reason of the defendant’s racketeering activities. Proximate cause, as an
aspect of RICO’s “by reason of ” standard, requires a RICO plaintiff to show
that the defendant’s racketeering offenses led directly to the plaintiff ’s
injuries.
Summary
The passage explains that RICO's broad definition allows for the inclusion of
mail and wire fraud as predicate acts, which can be used to establish a RICO
claim. It emphasizes that a plaintiff must show direct injury caused by the
defendant's racketeering activities to succeed in a civil RICO action. This is
relevant to the case at hand, as the plaintiff alleges wire fraud and other
predicate acts as part of a RICO claim. The passage suggests that if the
plaintiff can demonstrate the necessary elements, including direct injury and
a pattern of racketeering activity, the RICO claim may be viable.

MOMTAZ1 FAMILY, LLC V. WAGNER AS A CASE STUDY.
South Dakota Law Review - South Dakota Law Review - Dunham,
Kassadie F. - 2022-09-22
Extract
As relevant to this article, RICO makes it 'unlawful for any person employed
by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which
affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or
indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of
racketeering activity....' An 'enterprise' can be an individual, a legal entity,
like a corporation, or 'any union or group of individuals associated in fact
although not a legal entity.' A 'pattern of racketeering activity' means 'at
least two acts of racketeering activity....' 'Racketeering activity,' in turn,
encompasses a wide range of crimes, including 'the felonious manufacture,
importation, receiving, concealment, buying, selling, or otherwise dealing in
a controlled substance or listed chemical (as defined in section 102 of the
Controlled Substances Act), punishable under any law of the United States.'
In sum, to establish a RICO violation, the plaintiff must adequately plead and
prove 'that the defendant engaged in (1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3)
through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity....'

PAYORS, PLAYERS, AND PROXIMATE CAUSE.
Notre Dame Law Review - University of Notre Dame Law School -
Crusey, Elisabeth F. - 2022-05-01
Extract
RICO is not just a tool for government control over organized crime. It is
also a remedial statute for civil matters. (31) It 'authorize[s]... criminal or
civil remedies on conduct already criminal, when performed in a specified
fashion' as delineated by the statute. (32) Section 1962 provides civil
remedies for four types of conduct: (1) using income derived from a pattern
of racketeering activity (33) to acquire an interest in an enterprise; (2)
acquiring or maintaining an interest in an enterprise through a pattern of
racketeering activity; (3) conducting the affairs of an enterprise through a
pattern of racketeering activity; and (4) conspiring to commit any of these
offenses. (34) Today, Congress urges courts to construe RICO liberally from
the 'perspective of the victim, not the perpetrator.' (35) A private civil right
of action in [section] 1964 provides that '[a]ny person injured in his business
or property by reason of a violation of section 1962... may sue.' (36) Notably,
a successful plaintiff under [section] 1964 is entitled to treble damages and
the cost of the suit, including attorney fees. (37) The threat of treble
damages encourages plaintiffs to bring claims and discourages entities from
engaging in illegal activities.
Summary
RICO is intended to be a remedial statute for civil matters, allowing for civil
remedies in cases of conduct that is already criminal when performed in a
specified manner. Section 1962 outlines the types of conduct that can give
rise to civil remedies, and Section 1964 provides a private right of action for
individuals injured in their business or property due to a violation of Section
1962. The passage emphasizes that Congress urges courts to construe RICO
liberally from the perspective of the victim, not the perpetrator, and that
successful plaintiffs are entitled to treble damages and attorney fees. This
suggests that courts should be open to allowing RICO claims to proceed if
the plaintiff can demonstrate injury due to the defendant's racketeering
activity.
Sylvester v. Parexel Int'l LLC
USDOL Administrative Review Board Decisions
Extract
Two United States Supreme Court cases, Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S.
544 and Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. ----, 129 S .Ct. 1937 have heightened the
pleading requirements established in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

=== PAGE 37 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
In those cases, the Supreme Court interpreted Rule 8 to mean that the
'[f]actual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the
speculative level' and must be sufficient 'to state a claim to relief that is
plausible on its face.' Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570. 'A claim has facial
plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to
draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the
misconduct alleged.' Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1949.
Summary
For a complaint to survive a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), it must
contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief
that is plausible on its face. This means that the allegations must be more
than speculative and must allow the court to reasonably infer that the
defendant is liable for the alleged misconduct.
RICO: A Primer
Extract
Mail and wire fraud are the most common predicate acts... The racketeering
acts need not be similar or directly related to each other; rather, it is
sufficient that the racketeering acts are related in some way to the affairs of
the charged enterprise... A plaintiff may demonstrate a pattern by
establishment that the predicate acts pose a threat of continued criminal
activity, which is generally demonstrated by showing either: * Closed-ended
continuity. Proving 'a series of related predicate acts extending over a
substantial period of time.' * Open-ended continuity. A threat of 'continuing
criminal activity extending indefinitely into the future,' in light of the nature
of the enterprise and predicate acts alleged.
Summary
To establish a RICO claim, the plaintiff must demonstrate a pattern of
racketeering activity, which can be shown through either closed-ended or
open-ended continuity. The passage explains that predicate acts, such as
mail and wire fraud, do not need to be similar but must be related to the
enterprise's affairs. The plaintiff can establish a pattern by showing a series
of related acts over a substantial period (closed-ended continuity) or a threat
of ongoing criminal activity (open-ended continuity).
Defending RICO Claims In The Business Context Part II: RICO Claims Must
Allege Injury To Business Or Property
Extract
Fortunately for defendants, the RICO standing requirement greatly restricts
the types of claims that can survive a motion to dismiss. If a plaintiff brings a

=== PAGE 38 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
civil suit alleging a RICO violation, the plaintiff must plausibly allege that his
injury animating the RICO claim is associated with his business or property
by reason of the defendant's violation of the RICO laws. Absent these
allegations, the lawsuit must be dismissed. RICO standing is distinct from
the more well-known concept of constitutional standing. For RICO claims, in
addition to pleading a sufficiently specific injury, including allegations that
the plaintiff has suffered known damages (as opposed to mere speculative or
unprovable damages), the plaintiff must allege that he suffered an injury to
his business or property that bears some causal relationship to the alleged
act or acts that violated RICO. This fundamental RICO requirement helps
ensure that RICO is not expanded beyond its original intent.
Summary
For a RICO claim to survive a motion to dismiss, the plaintiff must allege a
specific injury to business or property that is causally related to the
defendant's alleged RICO violation. This requirement is fundamental to
prevent the expansion of RICO beyond its intended scope. The injury must
be concrete and not speculative, and it must be directly caused by the
alleged RICO violation.
RICO: A Primer
Extract
To prove a violation of Section 1962(c), a plaintiff must prove the following
elements: * Existence of an enterprise; * The enterprise engaged in, or its
activities affected, interstate or foreign commerce; * The defendant was
employed by or was associated with the enterprise; * The defendant
conducted or participated, either directly or indirectly, in the conduct of the
affairs of the enterprise; and * The defendant participated in the affairs of
the enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of
unlawful debt.
Summary
Specific elements that must be proven to establish a violation of Section
1962(c) of the RICO Act. These elements include the existence of an
enterprise, the enterprise's engagement in or effect on interstate or foreign
commerce, the defendant's association with the enterprise, the defendant's
participation in the enterprise's affairs, and the defendant's involvement in a
pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt. This
information is crucial for understanding the legal requirements for proving a
RICO violation under this section.
Defending Civil RICO Claims: A Defense Plan Should Be In Every Business's
Arsenal

=== PAGE 39 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
First, to bring a civil RICO claim, a plaintiff must demonstrate that their
business or property was injured as a result of a RICO violation. In other
words, there must be some sort of concrete financial loss directly flowing
from the purported violation to support a RICO claim. Thus, if a plaintiff
does not have a concrete financial loss, then the RICO claim must be
dismissed. Asserting personal injuries, such as emotional distress, is
insufficient. Second, to prove most types of RICO claims, the plaintiff must
plead that the defendant committed some qualifying criminal action, the
most common of which is mail, wire or securities fraud. Business deals gone
sour do not count. Rather, the plaintiff must be able to prove the elements of
the asserted crime, and often an intent to defraud. If there is nothing
criminal in nature about the complained-of conduct, RICO should not apply.
It is an abuse of the RICO statute to attempt to shoehorn ordinary business
or contractual disputes into a civil RICO claim. Third, the plaintiff must
plead a pattern of racketeering activity for most RICO claims. If the alleged
conduct occurred once or twice, or was not continuous, it cannot form a
pattern of conduct sufficient to support a RICO claim. And oftentimes,
because there is a fraud component, those instances must be particularly
identified in the plaintiff's pleading—a barrier that can prove difficult to
accomplish.
Summary
Essential elements required to establish a civil RICO claim, including
demonstrating a concrete financial loss, proving a qualifying criminal action,
and establishing a pattern of racketeering activity. These elements are
critical in determining whether a RICO claim can proceed. The passage
emphasizes that personal injuries or emotional distress are insufficient, and
the plaintiff must show a direct financial loss. Additionally, the plaintiff must
prove that the defendant committed a criminal action, such as wire fraud,
and that there is a pattern of racketeering activity, not just isolated
incidents.
Defending Civil RICO Claims: A Defense Plan Should Be In Every Business's
Arsenal
Extract
Civil RICO claims are not limited to conduct traditionally associated with
organized crime, but they certainly are not meant to apply to ordinary
business disputes. While there are a number of defenses available as to each
of the four types of civil RICO claims, there are several RICO defenses that
should be in every business's playbook. First, to bring a civil RICO claim, a
plaintiff must demonstrate that their business or property was injured as a
result of a RICO violation. In other words, there must be some sort of
concrete financial loss directly flowing from the purported violation to
support a RICO claim. Thus, if a plaintiff does not have a concrete financial

such as emotion distress, is insufficient. Second, to prove most types of
RICO claims, the plaintiff must plead that the defendant committed some
qualifying criminal action, the most common of which is mail, wire or
securities fraud. Business deals gone sour do not count. Rather, the plaintiff
must be able to prove the elements of the asserted crime, and often an
intent to defraud. If there is nothing criminal in nature about the

statute to attempt to shoehorn ordinary business or contractual disputes

racketeering activity for most RICO claims. If the alleged conduct occurred
once or twice, or was not continuous, it cannot form a pattern of conduct
sufficient to support a RICO claim. And oftentimes, because there is a fraud
component, those instances must be particularly identified in the plaintiff's
pleading—a barrier that can prove difficult to accomplish. Fourth, for most
RICO claims, the plaintiff also must plead that the alleged 'person' and
'enterprise,' as defined in RICO, are distinct. While often technical, this
'distinctiveness' requirement provides that a corporation generally will not
be liable for operating an 'enterprise' consisting of itself and its officers or
employees. If a business is alleged to have violated RICO based on
intracompany actions, then the RICO claim has a good chance of dismissal.
Summary
The passage outlines several defenses available for civil RICO claims: (1)
The plaintiff must demonstrate a concrete financial loss directly resulting
from a RICO violation. Emotional distress or personal injuries are
insufficient. (2) The plaintiff must plead that the defendant committed a
qualifying criminal action, such as mail, wire, or securities fraud, with intent
to defraud. (3) The plaintiff must plead a pattern of racketeering activity,
which requires more than isolated or non-continuous conduct. (4) The
plaintiff must demonstrate that the "person" and "enterprise" are distinct
entities. These defenses are crucial in determining whether a RICO claim
can be dismissed.
