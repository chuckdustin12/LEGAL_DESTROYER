Question
What is the relationship test under RICO in the 10th Circuit?
Answer (Tenth Circuit)
Short response
The relationship test under RICO in the 10th Circuit requires that predicate
acts be related to each other and to the enterprise, demonstrated by
showing they have the same or similar purposes, results, participants,
victims, or methods of commission, or are otherwise interrelated by
distinguishing characteristics and are not isolated events. This test is part of
the broader "continuity plus relationship" framework established by the
Supreme Court, which the 10th Circuit has implemented through a multi-
factor approach focusing primarily on duration and extensiveness.
Summary
The relationship test under RICO in the 10th Circuit is a fundamental
component of establishing a "pattern of racketeering activity," which is
essential to any RICO claim. To satisfy this test, a plaintiff must demonstrate
that the predicate acts are related to each other and to the enterprise itself.
The 10th Circuit follows the Supreme Court's guidance that acts are related
if they have "the same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or
methods of commission, or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing
characteristics and are not isolated events." This relationship requirement
works in conjunction with the continuity element to form the "continuity plus
relationship" framework that defines a pattern of racketeering activity.
The 10th Circuit has developed a multi-factor approach to analyze the
relationship prong, with particular emphasis on two key factors: duration
and extensiveness. For extensiveness, the court considers the number of
victims, number of acts, variety of acts, distinctiveness of injuries, and the
complexity of the scheme. The court has consistently held that acts that are
part of a common fraudulent scheme satisfy the relationship requirement,
and that the relationship between predicate acts depends on which
provision of RICO is being invoked (1962(a), (b), or (c)). While the 10th
Circuit has not established a "bright-line test" for determining a pattern, its
jurisprudence provides clear guidance on how the relationship test is
applied in practice.

Background and Relevant Law
Supreme Court Framework
The relationship test under RICO stems from the Supreme Court's
interpretation of what constitutes a "pattern of racketeering activity." In H.J.
Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229 (1989), the Supreme Court
established that a RICO pattern requires "continuity plus relationship." This
framework has been consistently applied by the 10th Circuit in its RICO
jurisprudence.
The Supreme Court defined the relationship requirement by borrowing from
the Dangerous Special Offender Sentencing Act (Title X), stating that
"criminal conduct forms a pattern if it embraces criminal acts that have the
same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of
commission, or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics
and are not isolated events," U.S. v. Knight, 659 F.3d 1285, 1288 (10th Cir.
2011). This definition provides the foundation for the 10th Circuit's
relationship test.
Tenth Circuit Implementation
The 10th Circuit has consistently followed the Supreme Court's framework
while developing its own approach to the relationship test. In Resolution
Trust Corp. v. Stone, 998 F.2d 1534 (10th Cir. 1993), the court emphasized
that the pattern element "requires the showing of a relationship between the
predicates, ... and the threat of continuing activity"—that is, "continuity plus
relationship."
Multi-Factor Approach
The 10th Circuit employs a multi-factor approach in its relationship analysis,
focusing primarily on two factors: duration and extensiveness. According to
secondary source materials, "The Tenth Circuit has posited a multi-factor
approach in its relationship analysis but looks mainly at two factors:
duration and extensiveness." Extensiveness is determined by considering
"the number of victims, the number of acts, the variety of acts, the
distinctiveness of the injuries, and the complexity of the scheme."
This approach is reflected in Tal v. Hogan, 453 F.3d 1244, 1268 (10th Cir.
2006), where the court stated, "To determine continuity we examine both
the duration of the related predicate acts and the extensiveness of the RICO
enterprise's scheme." Although this case was primarily addressing the
continuity prong, it demonstrates how the 10th Circuit's analysis of
relationship and continuity often overlaps, as noted in Tso v. Murray, Civil
Action No. 16-cv-2480-WJM-CBS (D. Colo. Feb 28, 2018) ("Relationship and
continuity are two distinct requirements, though their proof will often
overlap").

Common Fraudulent Scheme
One clear principle that emerges from 10th Circuit jurisprudence is that acts
that are part of a common fraudulent scheme satisfy the relationship
requirement. In Torwest DBC, Inc. v. Dick, 810 F.2d 925, 928 (10th Cir.
1987), the court stated, "It is clear that when, as here, the acts are part of a
common fraudulent scheme, they satisfy the relationship requirement of
Sedima." This principle has been consistently applied in subsequent cases.
Similarly, in Edwards v. First Nat. Bank, Bartlesville, Oklahoma, 872 F.2d
347 (10th Cir. 1989), the court reaffirmed that "when, as here, the acts are
part of a common fraudulent scheme, they satisfy the relationship
requirement of Sedima."
Statutory Context-Specific Relationship
The 10th Circuit has also recognized that the relationship requirement may
vary depending on which provision of the RICO statute is being invoked. In 
Torwest DBC, Inc. v. Dick, 628 F.Supp. 163, 165 (D. Colo. 1986), the court
explained:
"RICO also requires that the predicate acts must be related to the statutorily
proscribed conduct. There must be 'continuity plus relationship.' The
required relationship will be different, depending upon the prohibited
conduct. Under section 1962(a), the predicate acts must be related in the
sense that they produce proceeds which are then invested in an enterprise.
Under section 1962(b), the predicate acts must be related to the objective of
acquiring or maintaining control of an enterprise. Section 1962(c) requires
all of the acts to be related to the conduct of the affairs of the enterprise."
This nuanced approach demonstrates the 10th Circuit's recognition that the
relationship test is not applied uniformly across all RICO provisions.
Relationship to the Enterprise
In addition to the relationship between predicate acts, the 10th Circuit also
requires a relationship between the racketeering activity and the enterprise
itself. In U.S. v. Smith, 413 F.3d 1253, 1269 (10th Cir. 2005), the court
explained that "the Government must prove a relationship between the
racketeering activity and the enterprise. [...] A nexus between the
racketeering activity and the enterprise is established when there is 'a
relation between the predicate offenses and the affairs of the enterprise.'"
This nexus can be proven by demonstrating that the enterprise facilitated
the commission of the predicate acts.
It is important to note that U.S. v. Smith was stated as overruled by United
States v. Garcia, 793 F.3d 1194 (10th Cir. 2015). However, the overruling
appears to be on other grounds as the relationship test principles from
Smith continue to be cited in subsequent cases.
Similarly, in U.S. v. Killip, 819 F.2d 1542 (10th Cir. 1987), the court
addressed the elements required to establish a RICO conspiracy, including

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
the requirement that a defendant "objectively manifested an agreement to
willfully participate, directly or indirectly, in the affairs of the enterprise
through the commission of two or more offenses which make up the pattern
of racketeering activity." Although U.S. v. Killip was stated as overruled by 
United States v. Iverson, 818 F.3d 1015 (10th Cir. 2016), the basic principles
regarding the relationship between predicate acts and the enterprise remain
relevant.
Application of the Relationship Test in
Practice
Recent Applications
Recent cases in the 10th Circuit have continued to apply the relationship
test as part of the broader "pattern of racketeering activity" analysis. In 
Nation v. Shah, 4:19-cv-00588-JDR-JFJ (N.D. Okla. Oct 30, 2024), the court
stated that while "[determining what constitutes a RICO pattern is no easy
task," it is clear that a RICO pattern requires multiple "racketeering
predicates" that "relate to each other and amount to a threat of continued
racketeering activity." The court further elaborated that establishing the
relationship between predicate acts "is not a cumbersome task" and "it is
enough to show that the alleged predicate acts 'have the same or similar
purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of commission, or are
otherwise interrelated' and are not isolated events."
Different Types of Relationships
The 10th Circuit's application of the relationship test reveals several types of
relationships that can satisfy the requirement:
Common Purpose or Design: Acts that share a common purpose or
are part of the same scheme satisfy the relationship requirement. In 
Condict v. Condict, 826 F.2d 923 (10th Cir. 1987), the court noted, "It is
clear that when, as here, the acts are part of a common fraudulent
scheme, they satisfy the relationship requirement of Sedima." However,
it's important to note that Condict v. Condict, 815 F.2d 579 (10th Cir.
1987) was stated as superseded by Maxwell v. Wilson, 766 P.2d 909,
108 N.M. 65, 1988 NMSC 96 (N.M. 1988), though this appears to be on
grounds unrelated to the relationship test.
Similar Methods, Victims, or Results: Acts that employ similar
methods, target similar victims, or produce similar results can satisfy
the relationship requirement. In Schrag v. Dinges, 788 F.Supp. 1543 (D.
Kan. 1992), the court explained that the relationship requirement is
satisfied when the racketeering acts have "the same or similar
purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of commission, or
otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not
isolated events."
Facilitation of Enterprise Activities: Acts that facilitate the activities
of the enterprise can establish the necessary relationship. As noted in 
1. 
2. 
3. 

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
U.S. v. Smith, 413 F.3d 1253 (10th Cir. 2005), a nexus between the
racketeering activity and the enterprise can be established by showing
that the enterprise facilitated the commission of the predicate acts.
Distinguishing Features of the 10th Circuit's
Approach
Quality Over Quantity
The 10th Circuit emphasizes the quality of the relationship between
predicate acts over their quantity. In Garbade v. Great Divide Min. & Mill.
Corp., 645 F. Supp. 808, 810 (D. Colo. 1986), the court noted, "In
determining whether a pattern of racketeering activity exists, 'the number of
predicate acts, if more than one, is irrelevant. The question is the nature of
the conduct under all of the circumstances.'" This approach aligns with the
Supreme Court's guidance that proof of two acts alone is insufficient to
establish a pattern.
Distinction Between Multiple Acts and Multiple Episodes
The 10th Circuit distinguishes between multiple acts within a single episode
and multiple episodes with related purposes or methods. In Grant v. Union
Bank, 629 F.Supp. 570, 578 (D. Utah 1986), the court explained, "The
question here is whether the requisite 'continuity and relationship' set forth
in Sedima to evidence a 'pattern' is established by a single episode or
transaction (prime rate loan), even though supported by 'not less than two'
predicate acts of mail or wire fraud. This Court is of the opinion that the
concept of 'pattern' under civil RICO cases contemplates multiple
transactions or episodes, not just multiple acts to promote the same
transaction or episode."
Focus on Ongoing Criminal Activity
The 10th Circuit emphasizes that RICO is aimed at ongoing criminal activity
rather than isolated incidents. In Cook v. Zions First Nat. Bank, 645 F.Supp.
423, 426 (D. Utah 1986), the court stated, "To form a 'pattern,' the
commission of predicate acts or episodes of criminality must be sufficiently
continuous and interrelated. That is, a RICO or RICE 'pattern' requires
planned, ongoing, continuing crime and the threat of continuing criminal
conduct, as opposed to sporadic, isolated criminal episodes or events."
This focus is also evident in Tal v. Hogan, 453 F.3d 1244, 1268 (10th Cir.
2006), where the court noted that RICO "is not aimed at the isolated
offender" and requires proof of "a series of related predicates extending
over a substantial period of time," as well as "a showing that the predicates
themselves involve a distinct threat of long-term racketeering activity... or
that the predicates are a regular way of conducting the defendant's ongoing
legitimate business or the RICO enterprise."

Relationship Test in Civil vs. Criminal RICO
Cases
The 10th Circuit applies the relationship test in both civil and criminal RICO
cases, though the context may influence the analysis. In civil cases, the court
often emphasizes the need to distinguish RICO violations from ordinary
fraud claims. In Bancoklahoma Mortgage Corp. v. Capital Title Co., 194 F.3d
1089 (10th Cir. 1999), the court outlined the requirements for establishing a
civil RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. 1962(c), including the need to show
participation in the conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of
racketeering activity.
In criminal cases, the focus often shifts to the defendant's participation in
the enterprise's affairs through the commission of predicate acts. In U.S. v.
Zang, 703 F.2d 1186, 1194 (10th Cir. 1982), the court held that "Any two of
the counts of mail and wire fraud alleged in the indictment were sufficiently
related to the enterprise to constitute a violation of RICO."
Challenges in Applying the RICO Relationship
Test
No "Bright-Line Test"
The 10th Circuit has acknowledged that there is no "bright-line test" for
determining what constitutes a pattern under RICO. In Wichita Fed. Sav. &
Loan v. Landmark Group, Inc., 674 F. Supp. 321, 331 (D. Kan. 1987), the
court noted, "The Tenth Circuit has yet to 'formulate a bright-line test' for
determining the existence of a 'pattern'." This lack of a definitive test gives
courts flexibility in applying the relationship test but may also lead to
inconsistent results.
Distinguishing Between Relationship and Continuity
While relationship and continuity are distinct requirements, the 10th Circuit
has recognized that their proof often overlaps. In Tso v. Murray, Civil Action
No. 16-cv-2480-WJM-CBS (D. Colo. Feb 28, 2018), the court stated,
"Relationship and continuity are two distinct requirements, though their
proof will often overlap."
Evolving Standards
The standards for establishing a pattern of racketeering activity in the 10th
Circuit have evolved over time. According to one secondary source, "The
Tenth Circuit has devised a more demanding standard for showing a
pattern." This suggests that the 10th Circuit may apply the relationship test
more rigorously than some other circuits.

Specific Applications in Different Types of
RICO Cases
RICO Conspiracy Cases
In RICO conspiracy cases, the 10th Circuit examines the relationship
between the defendant's agreement and the pattern of racketeering activity.
In U.S. v. Killip, 819 F.2d 1542, 1548 (10th Cir. 1987), the court explained
that to establish a RICO conspiracy, the government must prove that "a
defendant, by his words or actions, objectively manifested an agreement to
willfully participate, directly or indirectly, in the affairs of the enterprise
through the commission of two or more offenses which make up the pattern
of racketeering activity in this case." Although this case was later overruled
by United States v. Iverson, 818 F.3d 1015 (10th Cir. 2016), the basic
principles regarding the relationship between a defendant's agreement and
the pattern of racketeering activity remain relevant to understanding the
relationship test in conspiracy cases.
Civil RICO Cases
In civil RICO cases, the 10th Circuit often examines the relationship
between the alleged predicate acts and the plaintiff's claimed injuries. In 
Pitts v. Turner and Boisseau Chartered, 850 F.2d 650, 653 (10th Cir. 1988),
the court explained that "to establish a RICO pattern, a plaintiff must also
demonstrate continuity, that is, 'the threat of continuing activity.'" This
requirement helps ensure that civil RICO claims involve genuine patterns of
racketeering activity rather than isolated incidents repackaged as RICO
violations.
Mail and Wire Fraud as Predicate Acts
When mail and wire fraud serve as predicate acts, the 10th Circuit examines
the relationship between these acts and the enterprise's affairs. In 
Professional Assets Manage. v. Penn Square Bank, 616 F.Supp. 1418, 1421
(W.D. Okla. 1985), the court noted that "to prove a pattern in a criminal
RICO case, the government must establish two or more predicate offenses
which are related to the activities of the enterprise." When the predicate
acts involve mail or wire fraud, the relationship to the enterprise may be
established by showing that the fraudulent communications were made in
furtherance of the enterprise's activities.
Exceptions and Caveats
Single Scheme Limitation
The 10th Circuit has indicated that a single fraudulent scheme with a
definite endpoint may not satisfy the pattern requirement, even if it involves
multiple predicate acts. In Torwest DBC, Inc., v. Dick, 810 F.2d 925, 929
(10th Cir. 1987), the court found that "a single fraudulent scheme that has a

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
definite purpose, the completion of which will end the scheme" does not
constitute a pattern. However, the court also noted that "A more difficult
question is presented when the RICO claim is based on one scheme
involving one victim, but the plan contemplates open-ended fraudulent
activity and does not have a single goal that, when achieved, will bring the
activity to an end."
Acts Must Be More Than "Sporadic" or "Isolated"
The 10th Circuit has emphasized that RICO is not aimed at sporadic or
isolated criminal activity. In Pitts v. Turner and Boisseau Chartered, 850 F.2d
650, 653 (10th Cir. 1988), the court noted that RICO's legislative history
"indicates that RICO does not apply to 'sporadic activity' or to the 'isolated
offender.'" This requirement ensures that the relationship test focuses on
genuine patterns of racketeering activity rather than disconnected or
isolated acts.
"Higher Standard" in the Tenth Circuit
According to secondary sources, "The Tenth Circuit has devised a more
demanding standard for showing a pattern." This suggests that plaintiffs or
prosecutors bringing RICO claims in the 10th Circuit may face a higher bar
in establishing the relationship test compared to some other circuits. This
higher standard may involve a more rigorous examination of the factors that
establish the relationship between predicate acts.
Conclusion
The relationship test under RICO in the 10th Circuit is a crucial component
of establishing a "pattern of racketeering activity." Drawing from Supreme
Court precedent, the 10th Circuit requires that predicate acts be related to
each other and to the enterprise itself. Acts are considered related if they
"have the same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or
methods of commission, or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing
characteristics and are not isolated events."
The 10th Circuit employs a multi-factor approach to analyze the relationship
prong, focusing primarily on duration and extensiveness. Extensiveness is
determined by considering the number of victims, number of acts, variety of
acts, distinctiveness of injuries, and complexity of the scheme. The court has
consistently held that acts that are part of a common fraudulent scheme
satisfy the relationship requirement.
The relationship test varies depending on which provision of the RICO
statute is being invoked, with different relationships required for violations
of sections 1962(a), 1962(b), and 1962(c). While the 10th Circuit has not
established a "bright-line test" for determining what constitutes a pattern,
its jurisprudence provides substantial guidance on how the relationship test
is applied in practice.

=== PAGE 9 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
In summary, the 10th Circuit's relationship test under RICO is a nuanced
and contextual inquiry that goes beyond simply counting predicate acts. It
requires a meaningful connection between the acts themselves and between
the acts and the enterprise, reflecting RICO's focus on organized, ongoing
criminal activity rather than isolated or sporadic offenses.

Summary
The passage from the Resolution Trust Corp. v. Stone case provides insight
into the relationship test under RICO as interpreted by the Supreme Court.
The Court has clarified that the "pattern" element of RICO requires not just
two predicate acts but also a "relationship" between these acts and a "threat
of continuing activity," which is referred to as "continuity plus relationship."
This interpretation is applicable to all circuits, including the Tenth Circuit,
as it is based on the Supreme Court's ruling.

U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit

Next, Mr. Smith asserts that there is insufficient evidence of a nexus
between KMD and the predicate acts. In a RICO prosecution, the
Government must prove a relationship between the racketeering activity
and the enterprise. United States v. Killip, 819 F.2d 1542, 1549 (10th Cir.
1987). A nexus between the racketeering activity and the enterprise is
established when there is 'a relation between the predicate offenses and the
affairs of the enterprise.' Id. In this case, the requisite relationship may be
proved by demonstrating that KMD facilitated the commission of the
predicate acts. See id.
Summary
Clear explanation of the relationship test under RICO in the Tenth Circuit. It
specifies that the government must prove a nexus between the racketeering
activity and the enterprise, which is established by showing a relation
between the predicate offenses and the affairs of the enterprise. This can be
demonstrated by showing that the enterprise facilitated the commission of
the predicate acts. This explanation is directly relevant to understanding the
relationship test under RICO in the Tenth Circuit.

U.S. District Court — District of Utah
Extract
To form a 'pattern,' the commission of predicate acts or episodes of
criminality must be sufficiently continuous and interrelated. That is, a RICO
or RICE 'pattern' requires planned, ongoing, continuing crime and the threat
of continuing criminal conduct, as opposed to sporadic, isolated criminal
episodes or events.

=== PAGE 11 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
The relationship test under RICO in the 10th Circuit requires that predicate
acts must be continuous and interrelated. This means that the criminal
activities must be planned, ongoing, and pose a threat of continuing criminal
conduct, rather than being sporadic or isolated incidents. This interpretation
aligns with the Supreme Court's guidance in Sedima, which emphasizes the
need for continuity and relationship in establishing a pattern of racketeering
activity.

U.S. District Court — Northern District of Oklahoma
Extract
While “[determining what constitutes a RICO pattern is no easy task,” it is
clear that, at a minimum, a RICO pattern requires multiple “racketeering
predicates” that “relate to each other and amount to a threat of continued
racketeering activity.” ... It is not a cumbersome task to establish that one or
more predicate racketeering acts are related; it is enough to show that the
alleged predicate acts “have the same or similar purposes, results,
participants, victims, or methods of commission, or are otherwise
interrelated” and are not isolated events.
Summary
The passage from the Nation v. Shah case provides insight into the
relationship test under RICO in the Tenth Circuit. It specifies that to
establish a pattern of racketeering activity, the predicate acts must relate to
each other and pose a threat of continued racketeering activity. The
relationship is established if the acts have similar purposes, results,
participants, victims, or methods of commission, or are otherwise
interrelated and not isolated events. This is a general requirement for RICO
cases in the Tenth Circuit.

RICO also requires that the predicate acts must be related to the statutorily
proscribed conduct. There must be 'continuity plus relationship.' The
required relationship will be different, depending upon the prohibited
conduct. Under section 1962(a), the predicate acts must be related in the
sense that they produce proceeds which are then invested in an enterprise.
Under section 1962(b), the predicate acts must be related to the objective of

acquiring or maintaining control of an enterprise. Section 1962(c) requires
all of the acts to be related to the conduct of the affairs of the enterprise.
Summary
The passage provides insight into the relationship test under RICO by
explaining that the predicate acts must demonstrate "continuity plus
relationship." The relationship requirement varies depending on the specific
section of RICO being applied. For instance, under section 1962(a), the acts
must relate to generating proceeds for investment in an enterprise; under
section 1962(b), they must relate to acquiring or maintaining control of an
enterprise; and under section 1962(c), they must relate to conducting the
affairs of the enterprise. This interpretation is crucial for understanding how
courts in the Tenth Circuit might evaluate the relationship between
predicate acts in RICO cases.

Summary
In the 10th Circuit, to establish a pattern of racketeering activity under
RICO, the government must prove two or more predicate offenses that are

In H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106
L.Ed.2d 195 (1989), the Supreme Court reiterated the well-established
concept that racketeering acts form a 'pattern' in RICO where they exhibit
'continuity plus relationship.' Id. at 239, 109 S.Ct. at 2900. The 'relationship'
requirement is satisfied when the racketeering acts have 'the same or
similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of commission, or
otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not
isolated events.' Id. at 240, 109 S.Ct. at 2901 (citing Sedima, 473 U.S. at 496
n. 14, 105 S.Ct. at 3285 n. 14).
Summary
Clear explanation of the "relationship" requirement under RICO, as
interpreted by the Supreme Court in H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co.
This interpretation is applicable in the 10th Circuit as it is a federal
standard.

U.S. District Court — District of Utah
Extract
On the other hand, two or more criminal transactions or episodes with the
'same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims or methods of
commission,' if properly pleaded with the attendant racketeering activity,
would raise a question of fact as to pattern. The question here is whether
the requisite 'continuity and relationship' set forth in Sedima to evidence a
'pattern' is established by a single episode or transaction (prime rate loan),
even though supported by 'not less than two' predicate acts of mail or wire
fraud. This Court is of the opinion that the concept of 'pattern' under civil
RICO cases contemplates multiple transactions or episodes, not just multiple
acts to promote the same transaction or episode. Without such interrelated
transactions or episodes, there would be no 'continuity and relationship.'
This is what distinguishes RICO from the predicate acts.
Summary
Requirement of a "pattern of racketeering activity" under RICO,
emphasizing the need for "continuity and relationship" among the acts. It
clarifies that a pattern involves multiple transactions or episodes with
similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods, rather than just
multiple acts within a single transaction. This interpretation is crucial for
understanding how courts in the 10th Circuit might evaluate the
relationship aspect of a RICO claim.
Agristor Leasing v. Meuli, 634 F.Supp. 1208 (D. Kan. 1986)
U.S. District Court — District of Kansas
Extract
The threshold requirement under 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5) of establishing a
'pattern of racketeering activity' is the showing of at least two predicate
acts. However, as the Supreme Court noted in Sedima, 'Proof of two acts of
racketeering activity, without more, does not establish a pattern.' 473 U.S. at
___, n. 14, 105 S.Ct. at 3285, n. 14, 87 L.Ed.2d at 358, n. 14 (quoting 116
Cong.Rec. 18,940 (1970) (statement of Sen. McClelland)). 'The target of
RICO is ... not sporadic activity, the infiltration of legitimate business
normally requires more than one 'racketeering activity' and the threat of
continuing activity to be effective. It is this factor of continuity plus
relationship which combines to produce a pattern.'

=== PAGE 15 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
The relationship test under RICO involves demonstrating a "pattern of
racketeering activity," which requires more than just two predicate acts. The
concept of a "pattern" includes the factors of continuity and relationship,
meaning that the acts must not be sporadic and should demonstrate a threat
of continuing activity. This interpretation is consistent with the Supreme
Court's guidance in Sedima and is applicable to RICO cases in general.
Tso v. Murray, Civil Action No. 16-cv-2480-WJM-CBS (D. Colo. Feb 28, 2018)
U.S. District Court — District of Colorado
Extract
To prove a 'pattern of racketeering activity' a plaintiff or prosecutor must
show both 'relationship' and 'continuity'—that the racketeering predicates
are related, and that they either constitute or threaten long-term criminal
activity. As the Supreme Court explained, Relationship and continuity are
two distinct requirements, though their proof will often overlap. RICO's
notion of relationship is [that] 'criminal conduct forms a pattern if it
embraces criminal acts that have the same or similar purposes, results,
participants, victims, or methods of commission, or otherwise are
interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not isolated events.'
Summary
Clear explanation of the relationship test under RICO, as interpreted by the
Supreme Court, which is applicable in the Tenth Circuit. It specifies that the
relationship requirement is met if the criminal acts have similar purposes,
results, participants, victims, or methods of commission, or are otherwise
interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not isolated events.
Condict v. Condict, 815 F.2d 579 (10th Cir. 1987)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
In this case, the court and the parties assumed for purposes of the court's
ruling that defendants engaged in numerous racketeering acts. It is clear
that when, as here, the acts are part of a common fraudulent scheme, they
satisfy the relationship requirement of Sedima. See, e.g., Superior Oil Co. v.
Fulmer, 785 F.2d 252 (8th Cir.1986). However, to establish a RICO pattern, a
plaintiff must also demonstrate continuity, that is, 'the threat of continuing
activity.' Sedima, 105 S.Ct. at 3285 n. 14. This element is derived from
RICO's legislative history, which indicates that RICO does not apply to
'sporadic activity' or to the 'isolated offender'.

Summary
The passage provides insight into the relationship test under RICO in the
Tenth Circuit by explaining that acts must be part of a common fraudulent
scheme to satisfy the relationship requirement. Additionally, the passage
emphasizes the need to demonstrate continuity, meaning a threat of
continuing activity, to establish a RICO pattern. This aligns with the
legislative history of RICO, which targets more than sporadic or isolated
activities.
U.S. v. Knight, 659 F.3d 1285 (10th Cir. 2011)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
A prosecutor “must show that the racketeering predicates are related, and
that they amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity.” Id.
Although the two “constituents of RICO's pattern requirement”—continuity
and relatedness—are analytically distinct, “in practice their proof will often
overlap.” Id. At issue here is the “relatedness” aspect of RICO's pattern
requirement. Attempting to offer guidance on RICO relatedness, H.J. Inc.
arrived at a working definition by borrowing from a parallel statute, the
Dangerous Special Offender Sentencing Act (Title X). Title X—like RICO, a
provision of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970—defines a “pattern”
with some specificity: [C]riminal conduct forms a pattern if it embraces
criminal acts that have the same or similar purposes, results, participants,
victims, or methods of commission, or otherwise are interrelated by
distinguishing characteristics and are not isolated events.
Summary
The passage from U.S. v. Knight provides insight into the relationship test
under RICO in the Tenth Circuit by explaining the relatedness requirement.
It states that for racketeering predicates to be considered related, they must
have the same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods
of commission, or be interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and not
be isolated events. This interpretation is based on the guidance from H.J.
Inc. and the Dangerous Special Offender Sentencing Act (Title X). The
passage is relevant as it directly addresses the relatedness aspect of RICO's
pattern requirement in the Tenth Circuit.

In determining whether a pattern of racketeering activity exists, 'the
number of predicate acts, if more than one, is irrelevant. The question is the
nature of the conduct under all of the circumstances.' Torwest DBC, Inc. v.
Dick, et al., 628 F.Supp. 163, 165 (D.Colo.1986).
Summary
The passage provides insight into how the Tenth Circuit approaches the
determination of a "pattern of racketeering activity" under RICO. It
emphasizes that the focus is on the nature of the conduct under all
circumstances, rather than merely the number of predicate acts. This
suggests a qualitative rather than quantitative analysis, which is crucial for
understanding the relationship test under RICO in this jurisdiction.
Wichita Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan v. Landmark Group, Inc., 674 F. Supp. 321 (D.

The Tenth Circuit has yet to 'formulate a bright-line test' for determining the
existence of a 'pattern'. Torwest DBC, Inc., v. Dick, 810 F.2d 925, 929 (10th
Cir.1987). In Torwest, it found what was not a pattern: a single fraudulent
scheme that has a definite purpose, the completion of which will end the
scheme. In reaching this decision, the Tenth Circuit contrasted the type of
scheme involved in this case, stating: A more difficult question is presented
when the RICO claim is based on one scheme involving one victim, but the

=== PAGE 18 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
plan contemplates open-ended fraudulent activity and does not have a single
goal that, when achieved, will bring the activity to an end.
Summary
The Tenth Circuit has not established a definitive test for determining a
"pattern" under RICO. However, it provides insight into what does not
constitute a pattern, specifically a single scheme with a definite end. The
court also acknowledges the complexity of cases involving ongoing schemes
without a single goal, suggesting that such cases might meet the continuity
requirement of a RICO pattern.

A violation of section 1962(c) thus 'requires (1) conduct (2) of an enterprise
(3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity.' Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex
Co., 473 U.S. 479, 105 S.Ct. 3275, 3285, 87 L.Ed.2d 346 (1985). RICO
defines racketeering activity as, inter alia, any act that is indictable under
18 U.S.C. Sec. 1341 (mail fraud) or 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1343 (wire fraud). See 18
U.S.C. Sec. 1961(1)(B). RICO also states that a ' "pattern of racketeering
activity" requires at least two acts of racketeering activity.' 18 U.S.C. Sec.
1961(5). ... [T]o establish a RICO pattern, a plaintiff must also demonstrate
continuity, that is, 'the threat of continuing activity.' Sedima, 105 S.Ct. at
3285 n. 14. This element is derived from RICO's legislative history, which
indicates that RICO does not apply to 'sporadic activity' or to the 'isolated
offender'. Id. The continuity requirement has been the source of
considerable difficulty. Courts generally agree that to make an adequate
showing of continuity under Sedima, a plaintiff must demonstrate some facts
from which at least a threat of ongoing illegal conduct may be inferred. A
scheme to achieve a single discrete objective does not in and of itself create
a threat of ongoing activity, even when that goal is pursued by multiple
illegal acts, because the scheme ends when the purpose is accomplished.
Summary
Requirements for establishing a RICO violation under section 1962(c), which
includes demonstrating a pattern of racketeering activity. The passage
specifically addresses the continuity requirement, which is crucial for
establishing a pattern. It explains that continuity involves showing a threat
of ongoing illegal conduct, rather than isolated or sporadic acts. This is
relevant to understanding the relationship test under RICO in the Tenth
Circuit, as it provides insight into how courts assess the continuity and
pattern of racketeering activity.

U.S. v. Killip, 819 F.2d 1542 (10th Cir. 1987)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
The court instructed the jury that to establish a RICO conspiracy the
Government was required to show three elements: (1) a conspiracy was
formed to participate in RICO activities; (2) the defendant agreed to join the
conspiracy; and (3) one or more of the conspirators committed at least one
overt act. The specific instructions on the second element read: [The
Government must prove that] a defendant, by his words or actions,
objectively manifested an agreement to willfully participate, directly or
indirectly, in the affairs of the enterprise through the commission of two or
more offenses which make up the pattern of racketeering activity in this
case, that is, kidnapping, attempted arson, travel in interstate commerce
related to controlled substances in violation of federal laws, possession of
controlled substances with intent to distribute in violation of federal law, and
conspiracy to distribute controlled substances in violation of federal laws.
Summary
Detailed explanation of the elements required to establish a RICO
conspiracy in the Tenth Circuit, specifically focusing on the necessity for a
defendant to have agreed to participate in the enterprise's affairs through a
pattern of racketeering activity. This directly relates to the relationship test
under RICO in this jurisdiction.
U.S. v. Zang, 703 F.2d 1186 (10th Cir. 1982)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
Any two of the counts of mail and wire fraud alleged in the indictment were
sufficiently related to the enterprise to constitute a violation of RICO. Based
on the instructions as a whole, there was no need to explain specifically the
required relationship.
Summary
In the Tenth Circuit, for a RICO violation, any two counts of mail and wire
fraud that are alleged in the indictment are considered sufficiently related to
the enterprise. This suggests that the relationship test under RICO in the
Tenth Circuit does not require a detailed explanation of the relationship
between the acts and the enterprise, as long as they are part of the
indictment and involve mail or wire fraud.

The Supreme Court has recently held that a RICO violation does not require
more than one scheme. H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co., --- U.S.
----, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989). The Court there reiterated its
prior holding that all that is required to constitute a pattern are two
elements--'continuity plus relationship.' Sedima, 473 U.S. at 496 n. 14, 105
S.Ct. at 3285 n. 14. There is no question that the acts complained of in this
case are related because they are all part of an alleged common scheme.
See Torwest DBC, Inc. v. Dick, 810 F.2d 925, 928 (10th Cir.1987).
Summary
The relationship test under RICO in the Tenth Circuit follows the Supreme
Court's guidance that a pattern of racketeering activity requires "continuity
plus relationship." This means that the acts must be related, which is
satisfied if they are part of a common scheme, and they must also
demonstrate continuity. The passage specifically references the Tenth
Circuit's application of this test in the case of Torwest DBC, Inc. v. Dick.

U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
As a final point, we question whether Plaintiffs' allegations of predicate acts
satisfied the requirement of 'a pattern of racketeering activity.' A 'pattern' of
racketeering is defined as 'at least two acts of racketeering activity,. .. which
occurred within ten years' of each other. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5). However,
because 'RICO is not aimed at the isolated offender,' Resolution Trust Corp.,
998 F.2d at 1544, proof of two or more predicate acts are not sufficient to
prove a pattern unless there is a relationship between the predicate acts and
a threat of continuing activity. H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492
U.S. 229, 239, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989); Duran v. Carris, 238
F.3d 1268, 1271 (10th Cir.2001). Continuity of threat requires both proof of
'a series of related predicates extending over a substantial period of time,'
as well as a 'showing that the predicates themselves involve a distinct threat
of long-term racketeering activity. .. or that the predicates are a regular way
of conducting the defendant's ongoing legitimate business or the RICO
enterprise.' Resolution Trust Corp., 998 F.2d at 1543. To determine
continuity we examine both the duration of the related predicate acts and
the extensiveness of the RICO enterprise's scheme. Id.

RECONCEIVING COERCION-BASED CRIMINAL DEFENSES.
Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology - Northwestern University,
School of Law - Galoob, Stephen R. - 2022-03-22
Extract
The inquiry here is meant to invoke the 'pattern of racketeering activity'
element of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).
The Organized Crime Control Act (1970), which includes RICO, provides that
'criminal conduct forms a pattern if it embraces criminal acts that have the
same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of
commission, or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics
and are not isolated events.' The Supreme Court characterized this
requirement as a 'relationship' element and held that the statute further
requires a 'continuity' element, 'referring either to a closed period of
repeated conduct, or to past conduct that by its nature projects into the
future with a threat of repetition.'
Summary
The passage explains the "relationship" element under RICO, which is part
of the "pattern of racketeering activity" requirement. It describes how
criminal acts must be interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and not
be isolated events. Additionally, it mentions the "continuity" element, which
involves either a closed period of repeated conduct or conduct that poses a
threat of future repetition. This explanation is relevant to understanding the
relationship test under RICO in the Tenth Circuit.

RICO: A Primer
Extract
The heart of a RICO case is the existence of a pattern of racketeering
activity. Under the statute, 'racketeering activity' includes a host of
offenses. ... A 'pattern' may exist where any combination of two or more
offenses occurred within a period of time. In Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co.,
473 U.S. 479, the Supreme Court held that the RICO pattern element
requires more than merely proving two predicate acts of racketeering.
Rather, proof of 'continuity plus relationship' is necessary. Nonetheless, the
Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized that Congress had a fairly flexible
concept of a pattern in mind.
Summary
The passage explains that to establish a pattern of racketeering activity
under RICO, it is not enough to simply prove two predicate acts. Instead,
there must be proof of "continuity plus relationship." This indicates that the
relationship test under RICO involves demonstrating that the predicate acts
are related to each other and that they pose a threat of continued criminal
activity. This requirement is part of the broader framework for establishing a
RICO violation, which is applicable in the Tenth Circuit as well as other
jurisdictions.
