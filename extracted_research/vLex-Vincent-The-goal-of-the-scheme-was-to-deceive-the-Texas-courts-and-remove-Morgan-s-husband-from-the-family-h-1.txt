Question
The goal of the scheme was to deceive the Texas courts and remove
Morgan's husband from the family home under false pretenses. RICO
liability requires that the predicate acts (e.g., mail or wire fraud) be
committed with the intent to deceive or harm another party. The intent to
deceive the courts and harm Morgan's husband by removing him from the
family home under false pretenses satisfies the intent requirement for the
predicate acts under RICO.
Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
The intent to deceive the courts and harm Morgan's husband by removing
him from the family home under false pretenses would satisfy the intent
requirement for predicate acts of mail or wire fraud under RICO. The
scheme's purpose to intentionally deceive the courts and cause harm aligns
with the specific intent element required for these predicate acts.
Summary
RICO liability requires predicate acts such as mail or wire fraud to be
committed with the specific intent to deceive or defraud. Based on the
provided legal authorities, the intent requirement for mail and wire fraud
focuses on "a willful act by the defendant with the specific intent to deceive
or cheat, usually for the purpose of getting financial gain for one's self or
causing financial loss to another." The scheme described—deceiving Texas
courts to remove Morgan's husband from the family home under false
pretenses—demonstrates a clear intent to deceive the judicial system and
cause harm to another party, which satisfies this requirement.
The intent to deceive can be inferred from actions that attempt to conceal
activities or from misrepresentations, and courts have consistently held that
the essence of a scheme to defraud is the intent to harm the victim, even if
actual harm does not result. The described scheme involves intentional
deception of the courts through false pretenses specifically to cause harm to
Morgan's husband by removing him from his home, which establishes the
requisite specific intent for predicate acts under RICO. This analysis is
supported by numerous administrative decisions and case law establishing
that the specific intent to deceive or defraud is a critical element for
predicate acts that can establish RICO liability.

Background and Relevant Law
Statutory Framework
RICO (Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act) liability
requires predicate acts, which include mail fraud and wire fraud. These
predicate acts have specific intent requirements that must be met to
establish liability under RICO.
The Wire Fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1343, which was last amended in 2025,
states: "Whoever, having devised or intending to devise any scheme or
artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or
fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, transmits or causes to
be transmitted by means of wire, radio, or television communication in
interstate or foreign commerce, any writings, signs, signals, pictures, or
sounds for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice, shall be fined
under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both."
This statute establishes that wire fraud requires both a scheme to defraud
and the specific intent to carry out that scheme through deceptive means.
Case Law on Intent Requirements for RICO Predicate Acts
The case law provides important clarification on the intent requirement for
mail and wire fraud as predicate acts under RICO. In Heden v. Hill, 937
F.Supp. 1230 (S.D. Tex. 1996), the court outlined the elements of mail fraud:
"(1) the defendants formed a scheme or artifice to defraud; (2) the
defendants used the United States mails or caused a use of the United
States mails in furtherance of the scheme; and (3) the defendants did so
with the specific intent to deceive or defraud." Similarly for wire fraud, the
court identified the elements as: "(1) the formation of a scheme or artifice to
defraud; (2) use of the United States wires or causing a use of the United
States wires in furtherance of the scheme; and (3) specific intent to deceive
or defraud."
In State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Punjwani, CIVIL ACTION NO. H-19-1491
(S.D. Tex. Dec 31, 2019), the court further explained that mail fraud requires
"(1) a scheme to defraud; (2) the use of the mails to execute the scheme; and
(3) the specific intent to defraud." The court also noted that "fraudulent
intent similarly can be plausibly inferred from... the pattern of numerous
cases in which [defendants] allegedly provided fraudulent diagnoses and
medically unnecessary treatment." This illustrates that intent to defraud can
be inferred from a pattern of fraudulent activities.
The case of B Choice Ltd. v. Epicentre Dev. Assocs., LLC, CIVIL ACTION NO.
H-14-2096 (S.D. Tex. Mar 03, 2017) helps establish the relationship between
predicate acts and RICO: "In the context of a RICO claim, the term
'predicate acts' refers to either state or federal crimes.... In this case,
Plaintiff's remaining alleged predicate acts consist of mail fraud under 18
U.S.C. § 1341, wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343, the Travel Act under 18
U.S.C. § 1952, and money laundering under 18 U.S.C. §§ 1956(a)(1)(A)(I) and

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
(a)(2). See 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1)(listing mail fraud and wire fraud as predicate
acts under RICO)."
Administrative Decisions and Secondary Sources on Intent
Requirements
The intent requirement for mail and wire fraud is further clarified in
administrative decisions. In In re Sgarro (2024), the decision cited circuit
court cases stating that elements of mail fraud include "knowing and willful
participation in [a] scheme [to defraud] with the specific intent to defraud"
and that wire fraud "requires specific intent to deceive and cheat."
A 2023 administrative decision on Mail and Wire Fraud explains that "The
second element of mail or wire fraud is a defendant's specific intent to
defraud. The intent requirement for money or property cases involves 'a
willful act . . . with the specific intent to deceive or cheat, usually for the
purpose of getting financial gain for one's self or causing financial loss to
another.'" This emphasizes that the specific intent to deceive or cause harm
is a central element.
Another administrative decision from 2020 on Theft offenses reinforces that
mail fraud "requires that the defendant devise or intend to devise a scheme
to defraud (or to perform specified fraudulent acts), and that the defendant
use the mail for the purpose of executing, or attempting to execute, the
scheme to defraud."
Several administrative decisions between 2006 and 2012 consistently define
the intent requirement for mail and wire fraud. For example, the 2012
decision on Mail and wire fraud states: "The second element the government
must prove for a mail or wire fraud conviction is a defendant's intent to
defraud. The intent requirement focuses on 'a willful act by the defendant
with the specific intent to deceive or cheat, usually for the purpose of
getting financial gain for one's self or causing financial loss to another.'"
Importantly, this decision also notes that "the government need not prove
actual harm. The essence of a scheme to defraud is an intent to harm the
victim."
The administrative decision from 2008 on Mail and wired fraud adds that
intent may be inferred from circumstantial evidence: "Intent may be inferred
from evidence indicating that the defendant attempted to conceal activity, or
from the defendant's misrepresentations. In some cases, the defendant's
knowledge of a false statement will constitute intent to defraud."
A secondary source titled Chapter 4. Elements of Cause of Action explains
that "'scheme to defraud' connotes some degree of planning by the
defendant. It is essential that the evidence show that the defendant
entertained an intent to defraud.... The specific intent to deceive is an
element of the predicate act." This further establishes that planning and
specific intent to deceive are required elements for RICO predicate acts.
Another secondary source, § 5.06 Mail and Wire Fraud, states that "The
government must also prove that the defendant engaged in the scheme to

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
defraud with the specific intent to defraud. 'In other words, the
misrepresentation or omission must have the purpose of inducing the victim
of the fraud to part with property or undertake some action that he would
not otherwise do absent the misrepresentation or omission.'" This clarifies
that the deception must be purposeful and designed to induce action that
would not otherwise occur.
Analysis
Applying Intent Requirements to the Described Scheme
The scheme described involves an intent to deceive Texas courts and remove
Morgan's husband from the family home under false pretenses. To
determine if this satisfies the intent requirement for RICO predicate acts, we
must analyze whether this demonstrates the specific intent to deceive or
defraud required for mail or wire fraud.
First, the scheme explicitly involves deception of the courts through false
pretenses. This aligns with the definition of wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. §
1343, which prohibits "devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice
to defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or
fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises." The use of false
pretenses to deceive the courts shows a clear intent to defraud the judicial
system.
Second, the scheme was designed specifically to harm Morgan's husband by
removing him from the family home. This targeted harm aligns with the
intent requirement described in the 2023 administrative decision on Mail
and Wire Fraud, which defines the intent requirement as involving "a willful
act . . . with the specific intent to deceive or cheat, usually for the purpose of
getting financial gain for one's self or causing financial loss to another."
While the scheme may not have been primarily financially motivated, it was
intended to cause loss to another party (Morgan's husband losing access to
his home).
Intent to Deceive the Courts
The scheme's goal to "deceive the Texas courts" demonstrates a clear intent
to defraud a governmental institution. As established in Heden v. Hill, 937
F.Supp. 1230 (S.D. Tex. 1996), mail and wire fraud require "specific intent to
deceive or defraud." The deliberate plan to present false information to the
courts demonstrates this specific intent.
The administrative decision from 2008 on Mail and wired fraud explains that
intent may be inferred from "evidence indicating that the defendant
attempted to conceal activity, or from the defendant's misrepresentations."
Using false pretenses to deceive the courts constitutes misrepresentation,
from which the intent to defraud can be inferred.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Intent to Harm Morgan's Husband
The scheme's intention to "remove Morgan's husband from the family home
under false pretenses" demonstrates an intent to cause harm to another
party. As noted in the 2012 administrative decision on Mail and wire fraud,
"the government need not prove actual harm. The essence of a scheme to
defraud is an intent to harm the victim." The scheme clearly intended to
harm Morgan's husband by depriving him of access to his home.
The 2007 administrative decision on Mail and wire fraud cites United States
v. Walker, 191 F.3d 326, 334 (2d Cir. 1999), which held that "defendant must
have had specific intent to harm or defraud victims." Similarly, it cites 
United States v. Powers, 168 F.3d 741, 746 (5th Cir. 1999), which held that
"defendant must intend some harm to result." The scheme's intention to
remove Morgan's husband from his home constitutes an intended harm,
satisfying this requirement.
False Pretenses as Evidence of Fraudulent Intent
The use of "false pretenses" in the scheme is particularly significant.
According to § 5.06 Mail and Wire Fraud, "The federal wire and mail fraud
statutes proscribe devising any scheme involving the use of the mails or
interstate wire transmission for obtaining 'property' by false pretenses or
representations." The explicit mention of false pretenses in the description
of the scheme directly aligns with the language used in defining mail and
wire fraud.
Furthermore, as stated in State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Punjwani, CIVIL
ACTION NO. H-19-1491 (S.D. Tex. Dec 31, 2019), fraudulent intent can be
"plausibly inferred" from a pattern of fraudulent activities. The use of false
pretenses to deceive the courts establishes such fraudulent activity.
Property Interests in Housing
Although the scheme does not explicitly target financial gain, it does involve
depriving Morgan's husband of his property interest in the family home.
According to § 5.06 Mail and Wire Fraud, mail and wire fraud involve
obtaining 'property' by false pretenses or inducing a victim "to part with
property or undertake some action that he would not otherwise do absent
the misrepresentation or omission."
In this case, the false pretenses were designed to cause Morgan's husband
to be removed from the family home, effectively depriving him of his
property interest in the home. This satisfies the property element often
associated with mail and wire fraud cases.
Planning Element
The Chapter 4. Elements of Cause of Action secondary source notes that a
"'scheme to defraud' connotes some degree of planning by the defendant."
The described scenario explicitly mentions a "goal" and a "scheme,"

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
indicating planning and intent rather than spontaneous action. This planning
element further supports the conclusion that the specific intent requirement
for RICO predicate acts is satisfied.
Exceptions and Caveats
Distinction between Intent to Defraud and "Puffing"
Several administrative decisions, including the ones from 2008 and 2006 on 
Mail and wire fraud, distinguish between intent to defraud and "puffing,"
which is "mere exaggeration of the qualities, opportunities, or value of an
article." However, this distinction is not relevant to the current scenario, as
deliberately deceiving the courts with false pretenses goes well beyond
mere exaggeration and constitutes actual fraudulent misrepresentation.
Need for Actual Use of Mail or Wire Communications
While the intent element may be satisfied, it's important to note that RICO
liability for mail or wire fraud would also require proof that the scheme
actually involved the use of mail or wire communications. As stated in 
Heden v. Hill, 937 F.Supp. 1230 (S.D. Tex. 1996), mail fraud requires that
"the defendants used the United States mails or caused a use of the United
States mails in furtherance of the scheme," and wire fraud requires "use of
the United States wires or causing a use of the United States wires in
furtherance of the scheme."
The scenario does not specify whether mail or wire communications were
used in furtherance of the scheme. If no such communications were used,
the scheme would not qualify as mail or wire fraud regardless of the intent.
Specificity of the Scheme
The 2020 administrative decision on Theft offenses notes that mail fraud
"requires that the defendant devise or intend to devise a scheme to
defraud." While the scenario describes a general scheme to deceive the
courts and remove Morgan's husband from the family home, it does not
provide specific details about the nature of the false pretenses or how the
scheme was executed. Additional details about the specific false
representations made would strengthen the case for fraudulent intent.
Conclusion
Based on the legal authorities provided, the intent to deceive the Texas
courts and remove Morgan's husband from the family home under false
pretenses would satisfy the intent requirement for predicate acts under
RICO, particularly mail or wire fraud.
The specific intent to deceive or defraud is a critical element of mail and
wire fraud, as established in 18 U.S.C. § 1343 and numerous administrative
decisions. This intent is defined as "a willful act by the defendant with the

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
specific intent to deceive or cheat, usually for the purpose of getting
financial gain for one's self or causing financial loss to another." The scheme
described clearly demonstrates an intent to deceive the courts through false
pretenses and an intent to harm Morgan's husband by removing him from
his home.
Multiple administrative decisions confirm that the essence of a scheme to
defraud is the intent to harm the victim, even if actual harm does not result.
The intent to remove Morgan's husband from his home constitutes an
intended harm, satisfying this requirement.
Furthermore, the use of false pretenses to deceive the courts aligns directly
with the definition of wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343, which prohibits
schemes involving "false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or
promises." The deliberate plan to present false information to the courts
demonstrates the specific intent to deceive required for RICO predicate
acts.
The planning element inherent in the description of a "scheme" with a "goal"
further supports the conclusion that the specific intent requirement is
satisfied. As noted in Chapter 4. Elements of Cause of Action, a "scheme to
defraud" connotes planning by the defendant.
While the intent element appears to be satisfied, it's important to note that
RICO liability would also require proof that the scheme actually involved the
use of mail or wire communications, which is not specified in the scenario.
Additionally, more specific details about the nature of the false pretenses
would strengthen the case for fraudulent intent.
In conclusion, the intent to deceive the Texas courts and remove Morgan's
husband from the family home under false pretenses does satisfy the intent
requirement for predicate acts under RICO, assuming that the scheme
involved the use of mail or wire communications as required by the statutes.

Summary
Predicate acts under RICO include mail and wire fraud, which require an
intent to deceive or harm another party. The passage supports the
proposition by establishing that mail and wire fraud are recognized
predicate acts under RICO, and these acts inherently involve an intent to
deceive. Therefore, if the scheme involved mail or wire fraud with the intent
to deceive the courts and harm Morgan's husband, it would satisfy the intent
requirement for RICO predicate acts.

U.S. District Court — Southern District of Texas
Extract
The elements of RICO mail fraud are: (1) a scheme to defraud by means of
false or fraudulent representation; (2) interstate or intrastate use of the
mails to execute the scheme; (3) the use of the mails by the defendant
connected with or incident to the scheme; and (4) actual injury to the
plaintiff. ... the Fifth Circuit recognizes 'a specific-intent requirement that
the defendant knew the scheme involved false representations, or put
otherwise, that a culpable defendant acts knowingly with the specific intent
to deceive for the purpose of causing pecuniary loss to another or bringing
about some financial gain to himself.'
Summary
For RICO liability involving mail fraud, there must be a scheme to defraud
with false representations, and the defendant must have specific intent to
deceive. The passage highlights the necessity of demonstrating that the
defendant acted knowingly with the intent to deceive, which aligns with the
proposition that the scheme aimed to deceive the courts and harm Morgan's
husband. The requirement of specific intent to deceive supports the
argument that the actions taken to remove Morgan's husband from the
family home under false pretenses could satisfy the intent requirement for
RICO predicate acts.

misrepresentations. In some cases, the defendant's knowledge of a false
statement will constitute intent to defraud.

The second element the government must prove for a mail or wire fraud
conviction is a defendant's intent to defraud. (44) The intent requirement
focuses on 'a willful act by the defendant with the specific intent to deceive
or cheat, usually for the purpose of getting financial gain for one's self or
causing financial loss to another.' (45) ... (54.) See United States v. Smith,
133 F.3d 737, 743 (10th Cir. 1997) (holding intent may be inferred from
variety of circumstantial evidence, including defendant's misrepresentations
and knowledge of false statements). (55.) See United States v. Lamoreaux,
42 F.3d 750, 754 (8th Cir. 2005) ('[T]he government need not prove actual
harm. The essence of a scheme to defraud is an intent to harm the
victim.' (internal quotations omitted)); United States v. Naiman, 211 F.3d 40,

was contemplated by scheme and need not prove actual injury).
Summary
Intent requirement for mail and wire fraud, which is a key component of
RICO predicate acts. It specifies that the intent to defraud involves a willful
act with the specific intent to deceive or harm another party. The passage
also notes that intent can be inferred from circumstantial evidence, such as
misrepresentations and knowledge of false statements. Additionally, it
clarifies that actual harm need not be proven, only that harm was
contemplated. This supports the proposition that the intent to deceive the
courts and harm Morgan's husband by removing him from the family home
under false pretenses satisfies the intent requirement for RICO predicate
acts.

Extract
The second element of mail or wire fraud is a defendant’s specific intent to
defraud. The intent requirement for money or property cases involves 'a
willful act . . . with the specific intent to deceive or cheat, usually for the
purpose of getting financial gain for one’s self or causing financial loss to
another.'
Summary
The specific intent to defraud is a crucial element of mail or wire fraud. This
intent involves a willful act with the specific purpose of deceiving or
cheating, typically for financial gain or to cause financial loss to another. In
the context of the proposition, the intent to deceive the courts and harm
Morgan's husband by removing him from the family home under false
pretenses aligns with the requirement of specific intent to defraud, as it
involves a willful act to deceive for the purpose of causing harm.
§ 5.06 Mail and Wire Fraud
Intellectual Property and Computer Crimes - Full Court Press
Extract
The federal wire and mail fraud statutes proscribe devising any scheme
involving the use of the mails or interstate wire transmission for obtaining
'property' by false pretenses or representations. The elements of wire fraud
and mail fraud are formation of a 'scheme to defraud' and use of mailing or
interstate wire communication to further the scheme. ... The government
must also prove that the defendant engaged in the scheme to defraud with
the specific intent to defraud. 'In other words, the misrepresentation or

=== PAGE 16 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
omission must have the purpose of inducing the victim of the fraud to part
with property or undertake some action that he would not otherwise do
absent the misrepresentation or omission.'
Summary
The federal wire and mail fraud statutes require a scheme to defraud and
the use of mail or wire communications to further that scheme. Importantly,
the intent to defraud must be specific, meaning the misrepresentation or
omission must aim to induce the victim to part with property or take an
action they otherwise would not. This aligns with the proposition that the
intent to deceive the courts and harm Morgan's husband by removing him
from the family home under false pretenses satisfies the intent requirement
for the predicate acts under RICO.

Extract
Mail fraud, 18 U.S.C. §1341 requires that the defendant devise or intend to
devise a scheme to defraud (or to perform specified fraudulent acts), and
that the defendant use the mail for the purpose of executing, or attempting
to execute, the scheme to defraud. See Schmuck v. United States, 489 U.S.
705, 721 n. 10 (1989); see also Pereira v. United States, 347 U.S. 1, 8 (1954)
(“The elements of the offense of mail fraud under … §1341 are (1) a scheme
to defraud, and (2) the mailing of a letter, etc., for the purpose of executing
the scheme.”).
Summary
Mail fraud requires a scheme to defraud and the use of mail to execute that
scheme. This aligns with the proposition that the intent to deceive the courts
and harm Morgan's husband by removing him from the family home under
false pretenses could satisfy the intent requirement for predicate acts under
RICO, as mail fraud is a recognized predicate act under RICO.

Summary
The passage provides legal definitions and interpretations of mail and wire
fraud, emphasizing the requirement of specific intent to deceive or defraud.
This is directly relevant to the proposition, as it establishes that for RICO
liability, the predicate acts (such as mail or wire fraud) must be committed
with the intent to deceive or harm another party. The intent to deceive the
courts and harm Morgan's husband by removing him from the family home
under false pretenses aligns with the intent requirement for these predicate
acts under RICO.
