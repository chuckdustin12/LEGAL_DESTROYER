Question
Does traveling to Oklahoma to prepare fraudulent documents for submission
in Texas state courts constitute a violation of any obstruction of justice
provisions under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act
(RICO), particularly if it is part of a broader scheme to deprive someone of
federally protected civil rights?
Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
Traveling to Oklahoma to prepare fraudulent documents for submission in
Texas state courts may constitute a violation of RICO's obstruction of justice
provisions, particularly when these activities form part of a pattern of
racketeering activity connected to an enterprise affecting interstate
commerce and aimed at depriving someone of federally protected civil
rights. The interstate nature of preparing documents in one state for
submission in another state's courts, coupled with the dishonest intent to
interfere with judicial proceedings through fraudulent submissions, satisfies
key elements of obstruction of justice under RICO, especially when these
acts are part of a broader coordinated scheme.
Summary
Preparing fraudulent documents in Oklahoma for submission in Texas courts
may violate several obstruction of justice provisions incorporated within the
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), specifically 18
U.S.C. § 1512 (tampering with documents for use in official proceedings).
When these activities occur across state lines and form part of a broader
pattern of racketeering activity connected to an enterprise, they meet
RICO's jurisdictional requirements under 18 U.S.C. § 1962. The interstate
travel element also implicates 18 U.S.C. § 1952 (Interstate Travel in Aid of
Racketeering), which prohibits traveling across state lines to facilitate
unlawful activities.
If these actions are undertaken as part of a broader scheme to deprive
someone of federally protected civil rights, they may also trigger additional
provisions under 18 U.S.C. § 241 (Conspiracy Against Rights). To establish a
RICO violation in this context, prosecution would need to demonstrate: (1)
the existence of an enterprise, (2) a pattern of racketeering activity
involving at least two predicate acts, (3) interstate commerce nexus, and (4)
conduct that specifically violates one of the obstruction of justice provisions
listed in 18 U.S.C. § 1961 as predicate acts. The cross-state preparation and
submission of fraudulent court documents, when part of a coordinated
scheme, satisfies these elements and could constitute a RICO violation.

Background and Relevant Law
RICO Framework and Definitions
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) was
designed to combat organized crime and racketeering activities that extend
across state lines. RICO prohibits certain activities connected to enterprises
engaged in interstate commerce when those activities involve patterns of
racketeering.
Under 18 U.S.C. § 1961, "racketeering activity" includes specified federal
crimes, including "section 1503 (relating to obstruction of justice), section
1510 (relating to obstruction of criminal investigations), section 1511
(relating to the obstruction of State or local law enforcement), section 1512
(relating to tampering with a witness, victim, or an informant), section 1513
(relating to retaliating against a witness, victim, or an informant)." These
obstruction of justice provisions serve as predicate acts that can form the
basis of a RICO violation.
A "pattern of racketeering activity" requires "at least two acts of
racketeering activity, one of which occurred after the effective date of this
chapter and the last of which occurred within ten years (excluding any
period of imprisonment) after the commission of a prior act of racketeering
activity." 18 U.S.C. § 1961.
Prohibited Activities Under RICO
18 U.S.C. § 1962 makes it "unlawful for any person through a pattern of
racketeering activity or through collection of an unlawful debt to acquire or
maintain, directly or indirectly, any interest in or control of any enterprise
which is engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign
commerce."
As outlined in De Pacheco v. Martinez, 515 F.Supp.2d 773 (S.D. Tex. 2007),
"Title 18 U.S.C. § 1962 of the 'Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act ('RICO') makes it a federal crime to perform certain acts
which involve conducting an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering
activity."
According to Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy, "A violation of § 1962(c)...
requires (1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of
racketeering activity. The plaintiff must allege each of the elements to state
a claim. They are all equally essential components, and the complaint will
fail if any one of them is not adequately pleaded."
The same source clarifies that "§ 1962(a), (b), and (c) are limited in scope to
conduct involving enterprises engaged in or the activities of which affect
interstate commerce. It is the activities of the enterprise, not each predicate
act, that must affect interstate or foreign commerce. RICO requires no more
than a slight effect upon interstate commerce."

Tampering with Documents
18 U.S.C. § 1512 addresses document tampering as follows: "Whoever
corruptly alters, destroys, mutilates, or conceals a record, document, or
other object, or attempts to do so, with the intent to impair the object's
integrity or availability for use in an official proceeding; or otherwise
obstructs, influences, or impedes any official proceeding, or attempts to do
so, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or
both."
This provision is critical to the analysis because it establishes that
fraudulent manipulation of documents intended for use in official
proceedings (such as court cases) constitutes a federal offense that can
serve as a predicate act for RICO purposes.
Interstate Travel in Aid of Racketeering
18 U.S.C. § 1952 addresses interstate travel in furtherance of unlawful
activities: "Whoever travels in interstate or foreign commerce or uses the
mail or any facility in interstate or foreign commerce, with intent to...
otherwise promote, manage, establish, carry on, or facilitate the promotion,
management, establishment, or carrying on, of any unlawful activity, and
thereafter performs or attempts to perform" such acts shall be subject to
fines and imprisonment.
United States v. Boyd, 309 F.Supp.2d 908 (S.D. Tex. 2004) explains: "An ITAR
offense involves using interstate travel or the mails with intent to 'promote,
manage, establish, carry on, or facilitate ... any unlawful activity.' 18 U.S.C. §
1952(a)(3). Securing a conviction requires proof of 'some act designed to
promote or further that illegal purpose.'"
Conspiracy Against Rights
18 U.S.C. § 241 addresses conspiracies against federally protected rights: "If
two or more persons conspire to injure, oppress, threaten, or intimidate any
person in any State, Territory, Commonwealth, Possession, or District in the
free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to him by the
Constitution or laws of the United States, or because of his having so
exercised the same... They shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not
more than ten years, or both."
This provision is relevant when fraudulent documents are prepared as part
of a scheme to deprive individuals of federally protected civil rights.
Venue for Prosecution
18 U.S.C. § 3237 establishes that "any offense against the United States
begun in one district and completed in another, or committed in more than
one district, may be inquired of and prosecuted in any district in which such
offense was begun, continued, or completed." This is particularly relevant to
the interstate nature of activities described in the query.

Analysis of RICO Elements in the Context of
Interstate Document Fraud
Element 1: Existence of an Enterprise
To establish a RICO violation, there must be an "enterprise" that is engaged
in, or whose activities affect, interstate commerce. As stated in Bustos v.
Invierte En Tex., 4:22-CV-02690 (S.D. Tex. Jun 03, 2024): "To state a civil
RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962, a plaintiff must allege three common
elements: '(1) a person who engages in (2) a pattern of racketeering activity,
(3) connected to the acquisition, establishment, conduct, or control of an
enterprise.'"
In the context of the question, if multiple individuals are coordinating their
activities to prepare fraudulent documents in Oklahoma for submission in
Texas courts, they may constitute an enterprise under RICO. This is
particularly true if there is an ongoing organization with a common purpose
of depriving individuals of their federally protected civil rights through
fraudulent court filings.
Element 2: Pattern of Racketeering Activity
According to RICO: A Primer, "A 'pattern' may exist where any combination
of two or more offenses occurred within a period of time... A plaintiff may
demonstrate a pattern by establishment that the predicate acts pose a threat
of continued criminal activity."
The same source explains two types of continuity:
"Closed-ended continuity. Proving 'a series of related predicate acts
extending over a substantial period of time.'"
"Open-ended continuity. A threat of 'continuing criminal activity
extending indefinitely into the future,' in light of the nature of the
enterprise and predicate acts alleged."
In the scenario described, if the preparation of fraudulent documents is not
an isolated incident but part of a series of related acts designed to obstruct
justice or deprive someone of civil rights, this would likely satisfy the
"pattern" requirement. This is especially true if the preparation of fraudulent
documents occurs multiple times or is part of an ongoing scheme.
Element 3: Predicate Acts - Obstruction of Justice
The preparation of fraudulent documents for submission in court
proceedings directly implicates 18 U.S.C. § 1512, which prohibits "corruptly
alter[ing], destroy[ing], mutilat[ing], or conceal[ing] a record, document, or
other object... with the intent to impair the object's integrity or availability
for use in an official proceeding; or otherwise obstruct[ing], influenc[ing], or
imped[ing] any official proceeding."

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Creating fraudulent documents for submission in court proceedings is an
attempt to obstruct, influence, or impede an official proceeding, which
constitutes a predicate act under RICO's definition of "racketeering activity"
in 18 U.S.C. § 1961.
Element 4: Interstate Commerce Connection
The preparation of documents in Oklahoma for submission in Texas courts
inherently involves interstate commerce, satisfying RICO's jurisdictional
requirement that the enterprise's activities "affect interstate or foreign
commerce." As noted in Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy, "RICO requires no
more than a slight effect upon interstate commerce."
Furthermore, traveling from one state to another to prepare fraudulent
documents triggers 18 U.S.C. § 1952, which addresses interstate travel with
the intent to "promote, manage, establish, carry on, or facilitate" unlawful
activities.
Element 5: Interstate Travel Component
The interstate travel component is particularly significant. United States v.
Boyd, 309 F.Supp.2d 908 (S.D. Tex. 2004) explains that an Interstate Travel
in Aid of Racketeering (ITAR) offense requires "using interstate travel or the
mails with intent to 'promote, manage, establish, carry on, or facilitate ...
any unlawful activity'" and "proof of 'some act designed to promote or
further that illegal purpose.'"
In the scenario described, traveling from Texas to Oklahoma specifically to
prepare fraudulent documents for submission in Texas courts would likely
satisfy this element, as it involves interstate travel with the specific intent to
further unlawful activities (document fraud and obstruction of justice).
Civil Rights Dimension
If the fraudulent documents are part of a broader scheme to deprive
someone of federally protected civil rights, this adds another dimension to
the potential RICO violation. 18 U.S.C. § 241 prohibits conspiracies to
"injure, oppress, threaten, or intimidate any person... in the free exercise or
enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to him by the Constitution or
laws of the United States."
While § 241 itself is not listed as a predicate act under RICO, the underlying
conduct could still contribute to establishing the broader pattern of
racketeering activity, especially if it involves other predicate acts like mail or
wire fraud, or obstruction of justice.
Venue Considerations
Under 18 U.S.C. § 3237, offenses "begun in one district and completed in
another, or committed in more than one district, may be inquired of and
prosecuted in any district in which such offense was begun, continued, or

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
completed." This means that prosecution could potentially occur in either
Oklahoma (where the documents were prepared) or Texas (where they were
submitted to courts).
Additional Requirements for RICO Claims
Specificity in Pleading
For civil RICO claims, particularly those involving fraud, there are
heightened pleading standards. As noted in Xenos Yuen v. Triple B Servs.
LLP, CIVIL ACTION NO. H-18-3277 (S.D. Tex. Jun 08, 2019), "RICO claims
based on mail or wire fraud must comport with Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 9(b)'s requirement that allegations involving fraud be pleaded
with particularity."
The court further emphasized that "there are no facts alleged that would
support a plausible predicate act of racketeering. Despite using the words
'fraud' and 'fraudulent,' none of Plaintiff's factual allegations support a
plausible predicate act of racketeering based on any type of fraud."
This highlights the importance of specifically identifying the predicate acts
and showing how they form a pattern of racketeering activity when bringing
a RICO claim based on fraudulent activities.
Mail and Wire Fraud as Additional Predicates
While the question focuses on obstruction of justice provisions, it's worth
noting that the preparation and submission of fraudulent documents across
state lines might also implicate mail and wire fraud statutes, which are
independent predicate acts under RICO.
As explained in Mortgage v. Flores, 746 F.Supp.2d 819 (S.D. Tex. 2010), "To
state a claim for mail or wire fraud to support a RICO violation under § 1341
or § 1343, a plaintiff must establish three elements: '(1) a scheme or artifice
to defraud or to obtain money or property by means of false pretenses,
representations, or promises; (2) a use of the interstate mails or wires for
the purpose of executing the scheme; and (3) a specific intent to defraud
either by revising, participating in, or abetting the scheme.'"
If the fraudulent documents were transmitted across state lines via mail or
electronic means, this could constitute additional predicate acts under RICO.
Extraterritorial Application Considerations
Although not directly addressing interstate activities within the United
States, the principles discussed in CRIMINAL LAW - NINTH CIRCUIT
HOLDING HIGHLIGHTS CUMBERSOME APPLICATION OF PRESUMPTION
AGAINST EXTRATERRITORIALITY IN FEDERAL STATUTES WITH STATE
PREDICATES - UNITED STATES V. PEREZ provide insight into how courts
analyze RICO's application across jurisdictional boundaries.

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
The source discusses "the pattern of racketeering activity test," which holds
that RICO has application "when 'significant acts in the pattern of
racketeering activity took place in the United States....'" This principle
supports the conclusion that RICO can apply to activities that cross state
lines, particularly when significant acts in the pattern of racketeering
activity took place within the United States.
Exceptions and Caveats
Enterprise Requirement
A key caveat is that RICO requires an "enterprise," which must be distinct
from the pattern of racketeering itself. If the preparation of fraudulent
documents is carried out by a single individual acting alone, without
connection to any organized enterprise, it may not satisfy RICO's
requirements, even if it constitutes obstruction of justice under other federal
statutes.
Proving Pattern of Racketeering Activity
Another challenge is establishing that the preparation of fraudulent
documents is part of a "pattern of racketeering activity." This requires
showing at least two predicate acts within a ten-year period, as specified in 
18 U.S.C. § 1961. If the preparation of fraudulent documents is an isolated
incident, it may not qualify as a pattern under RICO.
As noted in RICO: A Primer, establishing a pattern requires demonstrating
either "closed-ended continuity" (a series of related predicate acts extending
over a substantial period) or "open-ended continuity" (a threat of continuing
criminal activity extending into the future).
Specificity in Pleading Fraud
For civil RICO claims based on fraudulent activities, there are heightened
pleading requirements. As emphasized in Xenos Yuen v. Triple B Servs. LLP,
CIVIL ACTION NO. H-18-3277 (S.D. Tex. Jun 08, 2019), allegations of fraud
must be pleaded with particularity under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
9(b).
Nexus to Civil Rights Violations
While the question asks specifically about preparing fraudulent documents
as part of a scheme to deprive someone of federally protected civil rights,
it's important to note that civil rights violations themselves may not be
predicate acts under RICO unless they also constitute one of the specifically
enumerated predicate acts, such as obstruction of justice.

Conclusion
Based on the analysis of the provided materials, traveling to Oklahoma to
prepare fraudulent documents for submission in Texas state courts likely
constitutes a violation of obstruction of justice provisions under RICO,
particularly when it is part of a broader scheme to deprive someone of
federally protected civil rights.
The activity satisfies several key elements required for a RICO violation:
The preparation of fraudulent documents for submission in court
proceedings constitutes obstruction of justice under 18 U.S.C. § 1512,
which is explicitly listed as a predicate act under RICO's definition of
"racketeering activity" in 18 U.S.C. § 1961.
The interstate travel component triggers 18 U.S.C. § 1952, which
prohibits traveling across state lines to facilitate unlawful activities.
If the activity is part of a broader scheme involving multiple instances
of preparing fraudulent documents or other related unlawful activities,
it would likely satisfy RICO's requirement for a "pattern of racketeering
activity."
The interstate nature of the activity—preparing documents in
Oklahoma for submission in Texas courts—provides the needed
connection to interstate commerce required by RICO.
If these activities are conducted by or in connection with an enterprise
(such as a coordinated group of individuals or entities), and are part of
a scheme to deprive someone of federally protected civil rights, they
would likely violate 18 U.S.C. § 1962.
The multi-jurisdictional nature of the activity also means that, under 18
U.S.C. § 3237, prosecution could potentially occur in either Oklahoma or
Texas.
While there are important caveats—such as the need to establish an
enterprise, demonstrate a pattern of activity, and meet heightened pleading
standards for fraud allegations—the scenario described in the question
contains the essential elements of a RICO violation based on obstruction of
justice predicate acts, especially when those acts are part of a broader
scheme to deprive individuals of their federally protected civil rights.

the acquisition, establishment, conduct or control of an enterprise.' ... there
are no facts alleged to support the required pleading elements of a RICO
claim. In addition, as is most blatant, there are no facts alleged that would
support a plausible predicate act of racketeering. Despite using the words
'fraud' and 'fraudulent,' none of Plaintiff's factual allegations support a
plausible predicate act of racketeering based on any type of fraud, and there
are no allegations that come close to meeting the heightened pleading
requirements for fraud under FED. R. CIV. P. 9(b).
Summary
Requirements for a civil RICO claim, emphasizing the need for specific
allegations of a pattern of racketeering activity and the necessity of meeting
heightened pleading standards for fraud. This is relevant to determining
whether the preparation of fraudulent documents could constitute a RICO
violation, as it would need to be part of a pattern of racketeering activity
and meet specific pleading standards.

Title 18 U.S.C. § 1962 of the 'Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act ('RICO') makes it a federal crime to perform certain acts
which involve conducting an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering
activity. See generally, 18 U.S.C. § 1962. Under RICO § 1964(c), what is
commonly referred to as the 'civil RICO' provision, Congress has also
provided for a private federal cause of action to '[a]ny person injured in his
business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962.' 18 U.S.C. §

Summary
Elements of a RICO claim, which include engaging in a pattern of
racketeering activity connected to an enterprise. It specifies that a pattern
requires at least two predicate acts of racketeering activity, such as mail or
wire fraud. The passage also notes the need for specificity in pleading such
claims. While the passage does not directly address obstruction of justice, it
provides a framework for understanding how fraudulent activities, if part of
a pattern of racketeering, could potentially fall under RICO if they are
connected to an enterprise.

1510, 1511, 1512, and 1513). If the preparation of fraudulent documents is
part of a scheme that involves obstruction of justice, it could potentially fall
under RICO's provisions. The passage also defines a "pattern of racketeering
activity" as requiring at least two acts of racketeering activity, which could
be relevant if the fraudulent document preparation is part of a broader
scheme involving multiple acts.

Summary
The passage from 18 U.S.C. § 1962 outlines that it is unlawful for any person
to engage in a pattern of racketeering activity that affects interstate
commerce. Preparing fraudulent documents in Oklahoma for submission in
Texas courts could be considered part of a pattern of racketeering activity if
it is part of a broader scheme. The interstate nature of the activity (involving
Oklahoma and Texas) could bring it under the purview of RICO, especially if
it is intended to deprive someone of federally protected civil rights.

exercised the same; or If two or more persons go in disguise on the highway,
or on the premises of another, with intent to prevent or hinder his free
exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege so secured- They shall be
fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both; and if
death results from the acts committed in violation of this section or if such
acts include kidnapping or an attempt to kidnap, aggravated sexual abuse or
an attempt to commit aggravated sexual abuse, or an attempt to kill, they
shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for any term of years or for life,
or both, or may be sentenced to death.
Summary
The passage from 18 U.S.C. § 241 addresses conspiracies to injure, oppress,
threaten, or intimidate individuals in the exercise of their federally
protected rights. If the fraudulent document preparation is part of a broader
scheme to deprive someone of such rights, it could potentially fall under this
statute. The statute does not specifically address obstruction of justice
under RICO, but it does cover conspiracies to violate civil rights, which
could be relevant if the fraudulent documents are intended to oppress or
intimidate someone in the exercise of their rights.

Summary
The passage from 18 U.S.C. § 1952 addresses the use of interstate or foreign
commerce to promote or facilitate unlawful activities. It specifies that
traveling with the intent to promote or carry on any unlawful activity, and
then performing or attempting to perform such acts, can result in fines or
imprisonment. This statute could potentially apply to the scenario described
in the question if the preparation of fraudulent documents is considered an
unlawful activity and is part of a broader scheme that involves interstate
travel.

Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy
The Brief - American Bar Association - 2024-01-01
Extract
A violation of § 1962(c), the section on which Sedima relies, requires (1)
conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity. The plaintiff must allege each of the elements to state a claim. They
are all equally essential components, and the complaint will fail if any one of
them is not adequately pleaded. In particular, RICO claims based on mail or
wire fraud must comport with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b)’s
requirement that allegations involving fraud be pleaded with particularity.
The practitioner through their pleadings must articulate with great care and
attention a viable racketeering claim. In addition, § 1962(a), (b), and (c) are
limited in scope to conduct involving enterprises engaged in or the activities
of which affect interstate commerce. It is the activities of the enterprise, not
each predicate act, that must affect interstate or foreign commerce. RICO
requires no more than a slight effect upon interstate commerce.
Summary
To establish a RICO violation under § 1962(c), there must be conduct of an
enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity, and the activities of
the enterprise must affect interstate commerce. The passage also highlights
the importance of pleading fraud with particularity under Federal Rule of
Civil Procedure 9(b). This is relevant to the question as it involves the
preparation of fraudulent documents, which could be considered a predicate
act of racketeering if it is part of a broader scheme affecting interstate
commerce.

Extract
The second approach, 'the pattern of racketeering activity test,' held that
RICO had extraterritorial application when 'significant acts in the pattern of
racketeering activity took place in the United States....'" and "The Court
noted that 'the most obvious textual clue is that RICO defines racketeering
activity to include a number of predicates that plainly apply to at least some
foreign conduct.'
Summary
The passages discuss the application of RICO, particularly its extraterritorial
reach, and the tests used to determine when RICO can apply to conduct that
involves actions outside the United States. The "pattern of racketeering
activity test" is relevant here, as it considers whether significant acts in the
pattern of racketeering activity took place in the United States. This is
pertinent to the question because it suggests that if significant acts related
to the fraudulent scheme occurred within the United States, RICO could
potentially apply. Additionally, the mention of predicates that apply to
foreign conduct indicates that RICO's reach can extend beyond domestic
activities if certain conditions are met.
RICO: A Primer
Extract
RICO provides for a civil action against persons engaged in a 'pattern of
racketeering activity' or 'collection of an unlawful debt.' A successful
plaintiff may recover treble damages, costs, and attorneys' fees. ... A
'pattern' may exist where any combination of two or more offenses occurred
within a period of time. ... A plaintiff may demonstrate a pattern by
establishment that the predicate acts pose a threat of continued criminal
activity, which is generally demonstrated by showing either: * Closed-ended
continuity. Proving 'a series of related predicate acts extending over a
substantial period of time.' * Open-ended continuity. A threat of 'continuing
criminal activity extending indefinitely into the future,' in light of the nature
of the enterprise and predicate acts alleged.
Summary
RICO addresses patterns of racketeering activity, which can include a series
of related predicate acts. The passage explains that a pattern may be
established by demonstrating either closed-ended or open-ended continuity

of criminal activity. This is relevant to the question as it provides insight into
how a series of fraudulent acts, such as preparing fraudulent documents,
could potentially be considered part of a pattern of racketeering activity if
they are related and pose a threat of continued criminal activity.
RICO: A Primer
Extract
There are four separate and distinct RICO violations set out in section 1962:
(a) acquiring or operating an enterprise using racketeering proceeds; (b)
controlling an enterprise using racketeering activities; (c) conducting the
affairs of an enterprise using racketeering activities; and (d) conspiring to so
acquire, control, or conduct. Each of the subsections incorporates the basic
elements of 'enterprise' and a 'pattern of racketeering activity.'
Summary
Four types of RICO violations under section 1962, which include conducting
the affairs of an enterprise through racketeering activities and conspiring to
do so. This is relevant to the question as it provides the legal framework
under which the described actions (preparing fraudulent documents as part
of a broader scheme) could potentially be evaluated as a RICO violation.
