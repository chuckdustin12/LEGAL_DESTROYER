Question
A wife admitted on the stand in a final trial for divorce that she traveled
across state lines to get help from someone who isn't an attorney to help her
draft pleadings she knew were false to remove the husband from his home,
children, and livelihood. She did this to get custody and the house. How can
this be used against her in future proceedings?:
Answer (Texas)
Short response
The wife’s admission to knowingly submitting false pleadings in her divorce
case can be used against her in future proceedings to challenge her
credibility, support sanctions, justify modification of custody or property
orders, and potentially expose her to criminal liability for perjury or related
offenses. Texas law and case authority provide multiple avenues for the
husband or the court to leverage this misconduct in subsequent legal
actions, including bills of review, sanctions, and custody modifications.
Summary
A spouse’s admission under oath to intentionally filing false pleadings in a
divorce proceeding is highly significant under Texas law. Such conduct can
be used in future proceedings to impeach her credibility, support requests
for sanctions or attorney’s fees, and, if the falsehoods relate to child custody
or abuse allegations, serve as grounds to modify custody or restrict her
access to the children.
Texas statutes criminalize perjury and aggravated perjury, and knowingly
making false statements in official proceedings—including family law cases
—can result in felony charges. Even absent criminal prosecution, Texas
courts have broad authority to impose civil sanctions, strike pleadings, or
revisit prior judgments obtained by fraud. If the false pleadings involved
allegations of child abuse or neglect, specific statutory provisions allow for
modification of custody orders and imposition of penalties. The wife’s
admission thus creates substantial legal risk and can be used in a variety of
ways to challenge her position in future family law or related proceedings.
Background and Relevant Law
Legislative Framework
Perjury and Aggravated Perjury
Under Texas Penal Code § 37.02, a person commits perjury if, with intent to
deceive and with knowledge of the statement’s meaning, they make a false
statement under oath or swear to the truth of a false statement previously

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
made, where the statement is required or authorized by law to be made
under oath. Aggravated perjury, under Texas Penal Code § 37.03, occurs
when such a false statement is made during or in connection with an official
proceeding and is material to that proceeding. Aggravated perjury is
classified as a third-degree felony, and the statute applies to any person
making material false statements in official proceedings, including sworn
pleadings and testimony in family law cases. This statutory framework
establishes both the criminal liability for such conduct and its relevance in
civil proceedings, where the existence of perjury can be used for
impeachment, sanctions, and as a basis for revisiting prior orders (Tex. Pen.
Code § 37.03).
False Reports in Child Custody Context
Texas Family Code § 261.107 addresses knowingly making false reports of
child abuse or neglect. If a court finds that a party knowingly made a false
report under Chapter 261, this can be grounds for modifying orders
regarding possession of or access to the child, including restricting the
offending party’s access. The statute also provides for criminal penalties,
mandatory reimbursement of attorney’s fees and costs to the falsely accused
party upon conviction, and a civil penalty recoverable by the state. However,
this provision applies specifically to false reports made under Chapter 261,
which concerns child abuse and neglect reporting, and not to all false
statements in family law pleadings (Tex. Fam. Code § 261.107).
Case Law
Sanctions and Civil Remedies for False Statements
Texas courts have broad authority to sanction parties who make false
statements in discovery or under oath, even if the conduct does not result in
a criminal conviction. In Vaughn v. Texas Employment Com'n, 792 S.W.2d
139 (Tex. App. 1990), the court confirmed that sanctions—including striking
pleadings, dismissal, and monetary penalties—may be imposed for
presenting false evidence, and that such sanctions do not require a prior
criminal conviction for perjury. The court also clarified that perjury under
Texas law does not require materiality for the misdemeanor offense, but
aggravated perjury does require the false statement to be material and
made in connection with an official proceeding.
Setting Aside Judgments Obtained by Fraud
A final judgment in Texas may be set aside by a bill of review if the moving
party can show a meritorious defense, that they were prevented from
asserting it by the fraud, accident, or wrongful act of the opposing party, and
that this was not due to their own negligence. In Hill v. Steinberger, 827 S.W.
2d 58 (Tex. App. 1992), the court outlined these requirements, making clear
that an admission of fraud in obtaining a judgment (such as knowingly
submitting false pleadings) can satisfy the “fraud” element necessary for a
bill of review, provided the other elements are met.
Modification of Custody Orders Based on False Reports

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
In In re M.M., 05-21-00992-CV (Tex. App. Jan 13, 2023), the court held that
a finding under Texas Family Code § 261.107(b)—that a party knowingly
made a false report of child abuse or neglect—constitutes a proper ground
for modifying a divorce decree or custody order. The court also clarified that
while the statute allows for modification of orders based on such findings, it
does not create a private cause of action for attorney’s fees or civil
penalties, which must be pursued by the state.
Criminal Law Principles and Use of Evidence
Manning v. State, 870 S.W.2d 200 (Tex. App. 1994) provides that evidence
used in one proceeding (such as a probation revocation) can be used in a
subsequent criminal prosecution without violating double jeopardy. This
supports the principle that the wife’s admission and related evidence can be
used in future criminal or civil proceedings.
Secondary Materials
Secondary materials clarify that Texas law also criminalizes securing the
execution of a document by deception, which includes causing another to
sign or execute a document affecting property or pecuniary interest by
means of deception. Making materially false or misleading written
statements to obtain property or credit is also an offense. These definitions
are relevant to the extent the wife’s false pleadings were intended to obtain
property (such as the marital home) through deception.
Analysis
Use of the Admission in Future Proceedings
Impeachment of Credibility
The wife’s admission to knowingly submitting false pleadings is highly
damaging to her credibility. In any future proceeding—whether related to
custody, property division, enforcement, or modification—her prior
admission can be used to impeach her testimony. Texas courts routinely
consider a party’s honesty and candor when assessing credibility, and a
demonstrated willingness to lie under oath or in pleadings can severely
undermine her position in any subsequent litigation (Vaughn v. Texas
Employment Com'n, 792 S.W.2d 139 (Tex. App. 1990)).
Sanctions and Civil Penalties
Texas courts have broad authority to impose sanctions for litigation
misconduct, including knowingly submitting false pleadings. Sanctions may
include monetary penalties, striking of pleadings, dismissal of claims, or
even referral for criminal prosecution. The court in Vaughn v. Texas
Employment Com'n confirmed that such sanctions do not require a criminal
conviction and may be imposed based on the court’s findings in the civil
proceeding. The wife’s admission provides a clear factual basis for the
imposition of such sanctions in future proceedings.

Modification or Setting Aside of Prior Orders
If the husband can show that the wife’s false pleadings resulted in a
judgment or order that would not have been entered but for her fraud, he
may seek to set aside that judgment through a bill of review. To succeed, he
must demonstrate a meritorious defense, that he was prevented from
asserting it by the wife’s fraud, and that he was not negligent in failing to
assert it earlier (Hill v. Steinberger, 827 S.W.2d 58 (Tex. App. 1992)). The
wife’s admission of fraud in obtaining the order is strong evidence
supporting such a claim.
Custody and Access Modifications
If the false pleadings involved allegations of child abuse or neglect, Texas
Family Code § 261.107(b) allows a court to modify custody or access orders
to restrict the offending party’s access to the child. The court in In re M.M.
confirmed that a finding under this provision is a proper ground for
modification. Even if the false statements did not involve Chapter 261
reports, the court may still consider the wife’s lack of candor and
willingness to use falsehoods to gain custody as relevant to the best interest
of the child, which is the paramount consideration in Texas custody
determinations.
Criminal Liability
The wife’s conduct may expose her to criminal prosecution for perjury or
aggravated perjury under Texas Penal Code §§ 37.02 and 37.03. Aggravated
perjury, a third-degree felony, applies if the false statement was material and
made in connection with an official proceeding, such as a divorce trial. The
husband or the court may refer the matter to the appropriate prosecuting
authority for investigation and possible charges (Tex. Pen. Code § 37.03).
Even if criminal charges are not pursued, the existence of potential criminal
liability can be used to support requests for sanctions or to challenge the
wife’s credibility.
Property-Related Offenses
If the wife’s false pleadings were intended to obtain property (such as the
marital home) through deception, she may also be exposed to criminal
liability for securing the execution of a document by deception or making a
materially false statement to obtain property. These offenses, as described in
the secondary materials, further support the use of her admission in future
proceedings to challenge her entitlement to property or to seek restitution.
Scope and Limitations
Applicability of Family Code § 261.107
Texas Family Code § 261.107 applies specifically to knowingly false reports
made under Chapter 261, which concerns child abuse and neglect. If the
wife’s false pleadings did not involve such reports, this provision may not
apply directly. However, the general principles of fraud, perjury, and
sanctions for litigation misconduct remain applicable.

Private Causes of Action for Fees and Penalties
While § 261.107(d) and (e) provide for attorney’s fees and civil penalties, the
court in In re M.M. clarified that these provisions do not create a private
cause of action. Only the state, through the attorney general, may pursue
the civil penalty, and attorney’s fees may be awarded only upon conviction.
Requirements for Bill of Review
A bill of review is an extraordinary remedy and requires the moving party to
meet strict requirements, including showing a meritorious defense and lack
of negligence. The wife’s admission of fraud is strong evidence, but the
husband must still satisfy the other elements to succeed (Hill v. Steinberger,
827 S.W.2d 58 (Tex. App. 1992)).
Materiality and Criminal Prosecution
For aggravated perjury, the false statement must be material to the
proceeding. If the wife’s false pleadings were not material, she may not be
subject to prosecution for aggravated perjury, though she may still be liable
for misdemeanor perjury (Vaughn v. Texas Employment Com'n, 792 S.W.2d
139 (Tex. App. 1990)).
Use of Evidence in Subsequent Proceedings
Evidence of the wife’s admission can be used in subsequent civil or criminal
proceedings without violating double jeopardy principles (Manning v. State,
870 S.W.2d 200 (Tex. App. 1994)).
Exceptions and Caveats
If the wife’s false pleadings did not involve allegations of child abuse or
neglect, the specific remedies under Texas Family Code § 261.107 may
not be available, though general remedies for fraud and perjury remain.
The success of a bill of review depends on the husband’s ability to meet
all required elements, not just the existence of fraud.
Criminal prosecution for perjury or related offenses is discretionary and
may depend on the willingness of law enforcement or prosecutors to
pursue charges.
Sanctions and modifications of orders are subject to the court’s
discretion and the specific facts of the case.
Conclusion
The wife’s admission to knowingly submitting false pleadings in her divorce
case is a serious matter under Texas law. It can be used in future
proceedings to impeach her credibility, support requests for sanctions,
justify modification or setting aside of prior orders, and potentially expose
her to criminal liability for perjury or related offenses. If the false pleadings
involved allegations of child abuse or neglect, specific statutory provisions
allow for modification of custody orders and imposition of penalties. Even if

they did not, Texas courts have broad authority to address such misconduct
through sanctions, bills of review, and consideration of the best interests of
the child. The admission thus creates significant legal risk for the wife and
provides multiple avenues for the husband or the court to address the
misconduct in future proceedings.
Legal Authorities
Hill v. Steinberger, 827 S.W.2d 58 (Tex. App. 1992)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Rule 329b(f) of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure provides: 'On the
expiration of the time within which the trial court has plenary power, a
judgment cannot be set aside by the trial court except by bill of review for
sufficient cause, filed within the time allowed by law.' ... The petitioner must
allege and prove: 1) a meritorious defense to the cause of action alleged to
support the judgment, 2) which she was prevented from making by the
fraud, accident, or wrongful act of the opposing party, 3) unmixed with any
fault or negligence of her own.
Summary
Standard for a bill of review in Texas to set aside a final judgment after
plenary power ends. A spouse’s admission of fraud in obtaining orders could
be the “fraud, accident, or wrongful act” component that allows the
opposing party to seek a bill of review, provided they also show a
meritorious defense and lack of their own negligence.

Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
[W]e hold that the double jeopardy provisions of the Texas and the United
States constitutions are not offended when evidence used in a successful or
unsuccessful attempt to revoke 'regular' probation or deferred adjudication
probation is later used to prosecute the defendant in a different case. ...
'Perjury' is defined in TEX.PENAL CODE ANN. § 37.02 (Vernon 1989): (a) A
person commits an offense if, with intent to deceive and with knowledge of
the statement's meaning: (1) he makes a false statement under oath or
swears to the truth of a false statement previously made; and (2) the
statement is required or authorized by law to be made under oath.
'Aggravated Perjury' is defined in TEX.PENAL CODE ANN. § 37.03 (Vernon
1989): (a) A person commits an offense if he commits perjury as defined in

Section 37.02 of this code, and the false statement: (1) is made during or in
connection with an official proceeding; and (2) is material.
Summary
The case provides (1) Texas Penal Code definitions for perjury and
aggravated perjury that could apply to knowingly false sworn statements in
court or pleadings; and (2) a holding that evidence used in one proceeding
can be reused in later proceedings without violating double jeopardy,
supporting the idea that her admissions and related evidence can be used in
future criminal or civil actions.
Vaughn v. Texas Employment Com'n, 792 S.W.2d 139 (Tex. App. 1990)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The trial court specifically found that Vaughn lied both in her discovery and
deposition responses, in violation of Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 215...
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 215(2)(b) provides: ... the court ... may, after
notice and hearing, make such orders in regard to the failure as are just,
and among others the following: ... (5) An order ... dismissing with or
without prejudice the action or proceedings or any part thereof.... ... While a
showing of materiality is a necessary element of the third degree felony
offense of aggravated perjury ... materiality is not an element of the Class A
misdemeanor offense of perjury ... Section 37.02 requires, for the
commission of the offense, only (1) that a person make 'a false statement
under oath...' and (2) that 'the statement is required or authorized by law to
be made under oath.' ... there is no requirement that a person be guilty of a
crime under the Texas Penal Code in order for a trial court to assess
sanctions for presenting false evidence under rule 215.
Summary
The case confirms Texas courts can impose severe sanctions—including
striking pleadings, dismissal, monetary sanctions, and referral for criminal
prosecution—when a party lies in discovery or under oath, without needing a
criminal conviction. It clarifies perjury in Texas does not require materiality
for the misdemeanor offense, and courts may sanction false evidence under
Rule 215 regardless of Penal Code prosecution.

Extract
The family code's Title 5 ... provides that courts generally acquire
'continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over the matters provided for by this title
in connection with a child on the rendition of a final order.' Tex. Fam. Code §
155.001(a). ... Chapter 261 ... requires persons 'having cause to believe that
a child's physical or mental health or welfare has been adversely affected by
abuse or neglect by any person' to make a report ... Id. § 261.101. Section
261.107 of that chapter states: ... Based on subsection 261.107(b)'s plain
language, we conclude the trial court did not err by determining that a
finding pursuant to that provision constituted a proper ground for its
modification of the divorce decree. [] See Tex. Fam. Code § 261.107(b); ...
The two cases Father relies on did not involve subsection (b) and thus are
inapposite. ... (concluding section 261.107's subsections (d) and (e)
pertaining to attorney's fees and $1,000 civil penalty did not create private
causes of action and thus appellant lacked standing to claim that relief).
Summary
The case holds that a court may use a finding under § 261.107(b) (knowingly
making a false report of child abuse/neglect) as a proper ground to modify a
divorce decree/SAPCR orders, and confirms the court’s continuing, exclusive
jurisdiction to do so. It also clarifies that other subsections of § 261.107 do
not create private causes of action for fees/penalties. Thus, if the wife’s false
pleadings involved false CPS-type allegations, a § 261.107(b) finding could
be leveraged to modify custody/possession orders. If her conduct was false
pleadings unrelated to Chapter 261 reports, this passage is less directly
applicable.
Tex. Pen. Code § 37.03 Tex. Pen. Code § 37.03 Aggravated Perjury
Extract
A person commits an offense if he commits perjury as defined in Section
PENAL CODE 37.02, and the false statement: is made during or in
connection with an official proceeding; and is material. (b) An offense under
this section is a felony of the third degree.
Summary
The statute establishes aggravated perjury where a person makes a material
false statement during or in connection with an official proceeding. In Texas
family cases, sworn pleadings, affidavits, and testimony in court are part of
“official proceedings.” If the wife admitted she knowingly used false
pleadings, that implicates perjury under §37.02 and, if material and
connected to the proceeding, aggravated perjury under §37.03, a third-
degree felony. This can bear on future proceedings via impeachment of
credibility, potential criminal referral, sanctions, and impact on custody
determinations premised on honesty and best interest of the child. The

statute’s reach is criminal liability; its existence supports collateral uses in
civil court (e.g., judicial notice of felony implications, sanctions).
Tex. Fam. Code § 261.107 Tex. Fam. Code § 261.107 False Report; Criminal
Penalty; Civil Penalty
Extract
(a) A person commits an offense if, with the intent to deceive, the person
knowingly makes a report as provided in this chapter that is false. ... (b) A
finding by a court in a suit affecting the parent-child relationship that a
report made under this chapter before or during the suit was false or
lacking factual foundation may be grounds for the court to modify an order
providing for possession of or access to the child who was the subject of the
report by restricting further access to the child by the person who made the
report. ... (d) The court shall order a person who is convicted of an offense
under Subsection (a) to pay any reasonable and necessary attorney's fees,
court costs, and expenses incurred by the person who was falsely accused of
abuse or neglect in any proceeding relating to the false report. (e) A person
who engages in conduct described by Subsection (a) is liable to the state for
a civil penalty of $1,000. The attorney general shall bring an action to
recover a civil penalty authorized by this subsection.
Summary
The statute addresses knowingly false reports under Chapter 261 (CPS/
abuse-neglect reporting). If her false pleadings involved or constituted a
Chapter 261 report, a court’s finding of falsity can be grounds to restrict her
access/possession in future SAPCR modifications. She also faces potential
state jail felony prosecution, mandatory fee/cost reimbursement upon
conviction, and a civil penalty. If her false statements were not Chapter 261
reports, this specific statute may not apply; other Texas remedies (sanctions,
contempt, fraud on the court, perjury, vexatious litigant, fee-shifting) would
need to be invoked under different authorities.

Summary
The passages define Texas offenses that may map onto conduct involving
knowingly false written statements to obtain property (e.g., house) or
causing execution of documents by deception. In family-law litigation, such
criminal conduct can be used for impeachment, sanctions, and referrals; the
criminal elements and definitions also inform whether admissions could
support a criminal complaint or influence future credibility and relief (e.g.,
custody determinations). The material is criminal-focused and does not set
civil family-law standards but provides directly relevant definitions of
deceitful conduct relating to property.
