Plaintiff incorporates by reference public records from the Texas Supreme
Court, and requests the court to take judicial notice of these documents. The
Fifth Circuit has repeatedly held that it is proper for federal courts to take
judicial notice of matters of public record, including documents filed in state
court proceedings (Miller v. Dunn, 35 F.4th 1007 (5th Cir. 2022); LUV N'
Care, Ltd. v. Jackel Int'l Ltd., 502 F.Supp.3d 1106 (W.D. La. 2020); Wright v.
Arlington Indep. Sch. Dist., Civil Action No. 4:19-cv-00278-P (N.D. Tex. Nov
25, 2019)). Plaintiff therefore requests that this Court take judicial
knowledge of the consolidated mandamus record, as its’ authenticity is not
reasonably disputed. Here, all record references point to the public
consolidated mandamus record, as submitted to the Texas Supreme Court, a
copy of which has been served upon each defendant named in this complaint
either individually or through their agent. Link to the record: https://

bc41-bbc08c814365 All references to the record are marked herein with
“REC. [page]” and are hyperlinked to take the reader directly to the
reference. The record is filed under affidavit, and remains unopposed at the
time of filing this complaint. Therefore, Plaintiff respectfully asks that the
Court take judicial notice of the record under Federal Rule of Evidence 201,
filed on June 6, 2025, in the Texas Supreme Court under case numbers
25-0361, 25-0367, 25-0378, 25-0426, and 25-0458. II. TIMELINE OF
EVENTS BACKGROUND Morgan Michelle Myers, (“Myers”) and Charles
Dustin Myers, (“Plaintiff”) were married on June 20, 2015, and have two
daughters, C.R.M. and M.E.M, aged seven and nine. The evidence in this
case will show that in early December of 2023, the entire family was
blindsided by Myers’ sudden announcement that she wanted a divorce from
Plaintiff. REC. 717 The evidence will further show that Myers’ reasoning for
this divorce changes over time – beginning with how Plaintiff spoke to her,
and then switches to abuse and sexual harassment, and allegations of drug
abuse, claims that were only brought up in her initial pleadings. On
December 12, 2023, Plaintiff discovered a large volume of text messages
between Myers and two individuals identified as Debbie Price and Damen
Kazlauskas of Fort Worth, Texas spanning between October 2022 and
December 2023. REC. 254-714 In response to this discovery, Myers began to
communicate with Defendant Daniel Kenneth Branthoover, a resident of
Yukon, Oklahoma, who assisted her in the planning, drafting, traveling, and
submitting of fraudulent documents to the 322nd District Court of Tarrant
County designed to divest Plaintiff of his home and business operations.
When these allegations were raised to the State, they failed to adjudicate
them and violated the Plaintiff’s constitutional rights when he was deprived
of the guarantees of equal protection under the law and when he was not
afforded due process before being deprived of his property. REC. 183. The
central question is whether Defendants Munford, Kaitcer, Carter, and Baker
are victims of the initial scheme – or willing participants in an expanded
associate-in-fact enterprise that began in December of 2023 as the Myers-
Branthoover enterprise. A. The Myers-Branthoover Enterprise 1. On
December 14, 2023, Defendants Morgan Michelle Myers (“Myers)” and
Daniel Kenneth Branthoover (“Branthoover”), acting in concert and under
deceptive pretenses, (REC. 1704), initiated text-message communications
through which they formed and advanced a common plan and agreement.
Over the weekend of December 15, 2023, they met in Yukon, Oklahoma, to
further that plan ( REC. 274-278). The deceptive text message from
Defendant Branthoover claiming that he wanted to assist Plaintiff was
following an attempt by Myers to receive an ex-parte order of protection
from the 322nd District Court of Tarrant county, attempted on December 14,
2023 (REC. 78). B. Interstate Travel and Transfer 2. As part of their
agreement, both Defendants planned to draft and submit an original petition
for divorce and an affidavit of indigency to the 322nd District Court of
Tarrant County, with the intended and foreseeable result of removing
Plaintiff from his matrimonial residence at 6641 Anne Court, Watauga, Texas
76148—which also serves as his place of business for clients in the United
States, Canada, and the United Kingdom that rely on his market data
services (REC. 812 ¶ 16). 3. During Defendant Myers’s interstate travel, she
transferred the parties’ marital funds into Defendant Branthoover’s PayPal
account in the amount of $1,576 (REC. 723). Those proceeds funded a
second mobile phone (817-940-0852), listed on the fraudulent pleadings that

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Myers and Branthoover jointly prepared in Oklahoma, which Myers then
carried from Yukon to Texas on December 17, 2023 (REC. 86; 99; 102; 107).
C. Admissions 4. On December 16, 2023, Plaintiff reached out to
Branthoover and requested that the $1,576 be returned as they were needed
for Christmas gifts for the children, and for business advertising expenses
for his business. REC. 728-729. In response, defendant Branthoover
admitted that the purpose of defendant Myers’ visit was to help her prepare
paperwork for divorce litigation and confirmed that the transfer of $1,576
did in fact occur. REC. 730. Plaintiff’s bank statement from December 2023
further confirms this transaction. REC. 723. D. Post-submission
Collaboration 5. On December 18, 2023, defendant Myers submitted the
fraudulently prepared original petition for divorce, and an affidavit of
indigency to the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County. After these
documents were submitted, defendant Branthoover sent a text message to
Plaintiff on December 19, 2023, at 5:50 P.M. CST, holding himself out to be
defendant Myers’ attorney, showing his involvement extends past the initial
help in preparing the fraudulent documents. REC. 1712-1713 6. Four days
later, on December 22, 2023, defendant Myers submitted another knowingly
fraudulent application for protective to the 322nd District Court of Tarrant
County claiming that family violence had occurred on December 18, 2023,
supported by both an affidavit and unsworn declaration. REC. 108-109. E.
Significant and Intentional Misrepresentations 7. On December 27 and
December 28, 2023, respectively, the documents prepared by Myers with
the assistance of Branthoover were served on Plaintiff via the U.S.
Constable, and contained the following misrepresentations: i. That
defendant Myers could not afford court costs; REC. 72, REC. 85-96 ii. That
defendant Myers had an active order of protection against the Plaintiff with
a finding of family violence that had occurred during the marriage; REC. 78
at 10 iii. That defendant Myers was financially responsible for the family
vehicles, rent payments, utilities, and other household expenses, making
herself appear as the primary breadwinner; REC. 92 iv. That defendant
Myers would be harassed or abused if Plaintiff were given her newly
acquired phone number that was obtained while in Oklahoma; REC. 81 at
15. v. That defendant Myers and Plaintiff ceased living together on
December 1, 2023; REC. 74 at 4 vi. That family violence occurred on
December 18, 2023, in the presence of the two Children. REC. 108-109. vii.
That both family vehicles were defendant Myers’ separate property acquired
before marriage. REC. 79 at 11B F. Evidence to the Contrary 8. On the same
day Defendant Myers claimed to be in an emergency requiring the Plaintiff’s
prompt removal from the home, she can be seen at the home with Plaintiff
and the children in no state of emergency and also still cohabitating in the
marital home. REC 1715. 9. Again, on December 29, 2023, Defendant Myers
can be seen with Plaintiff at the family home, smiling and laughing with the
children in no state of emergency and still collaborating with Plaintiff in the
marital home. REC. 1735. 10. The citation for the application for protective
order ordered Respondent to show cause as to why it should not issue with a
hearing scheduled for January 16, 2024. REC. 118. 11. In response to
extensive misrepresentation above, Plaintiff prepared an original answer,
filed a motion to consolidate, and provided background information which
alleged that defendant Myers was intentionally abusing the legal process.
REC. 130-132. Plaintiff was ordered to show cause on January 16, 2024,
regarding the protective order application. REC. 118 G. Inclement Weather

and First Appearance 12. On January 15, 2024, the Tarrant County District
Courts Facebook page sent out a notice informing the members of the public
that the court would be closed on January 16, 2024, due to inclement
weather. REC. 1202. 13. Unaware of the closure at the time, the parties
appeared at the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County on January 16, 2024,
and were met with a dark courtroom, with only one judge in the building at
the time of their arrival – Defendant James Munford (“Munford”). 14.
Defendant Munford summarily ordered the Plaintiff out of his home,
inadvertently assisting the Myers-Branthoover associate-in-fact enterprise of
achieving their primary goal in having the Plaintiff removed from his
residence, despite the broader goal being to obtain a decree of divorce to
permanently divest Plaintiff of his interests. REC. 183. 15. Defendant
Munford’s initial order was baseless, made in the absence of any emergency,
without a hearing, and disregarded the Plaintiff’s pleadings, telling Myers
“you’re going to have to find evidence of family violence!” clearly aware that
this order was made without any regard to the Plaintiff’s constitutional
rights. 16. Defendant Jeffrey Kaitcer, (“Kaitcer”) walked into the courtroom
late due to the inclement weather and turned the courtroom into a laughing
matter as he began to joke with Defendant Munford, and instructed the
parties to download the AppClose app for communication, and the matter
was reset for January 22, 2024. There exists no record of this proceeding,
only marked appearances on the docket. H. Reset #1 – January 22, 2024,
Setting 17. At the January 22 reset hearing, the parties appeared only to
have the case reset once more because defendant Myers allegedly retained
the services of Defendant Cooper Carter, (“Carter”) in the lobby of the
courthouse just moments before the hearing was scheduled to begin. No
appearance can be traced to this setting by either party on the docket (REC.
1551), and once again, no hearing was held, and the case reset for a second
time to February 1, 2024. REC. 186. 18. Kaitcer permitted attorney Dan
Bacalis, Plaintiff’s prior attorney, to fill out the Associate Judge’s Report, and
the parties never went before him as indicated by the case docket’s lack of
appearance on this date by either party. I. Reset #2 – February 1, 2024,
Setting 19. One day prior to the February 1 setting, both attorneys,
Defendant Carter and Dan Bacalis, both amended the petition for divorce
and counterpetition for divorce without the parties’ knowledge. (REC. 189,
REC. 209) These amended documents were similar, submitted on the same
day, and raised concerns for Plaintiff regarding his quality of representation.
20. At the February 1 setting, both parties were in the conference rooms
outside of Defendant Kaitcer’s courtroom, when attorney Bacalis walks in
holding a settlement agreement. When Plaintiff refused this option and
requested that they go have a hearing before the judge. 21. This is when
Bacalis stated, as witness affidavits corroborate, that he “knows this Judge
and this is the best we can get.” and further stated “[w]e’ll be here all day.
We can come back and change it later.” 22. Outraged by this response,
Plaintiff paid very close attention to the settlement offer Bacalis was
pressuring him to sign, and noticed the following provisions: A typed written
Order conforming to this Report will follow within 20 days from the date this
Report is signed. The Temporary Order shall be prepared by DAN BACALIS.
Each attorney should approve the Order. The parties do not need to approve
the Order. The attorney reviewing the proposed Order shall have five (5)
days to do so. There arc no ten (JO) day letters. If an agreement is not
reached, a Motion to Sign shall be filed and set within thirty (30) days from

=== PAGE 5 ===

the signing of this Report. IT IS SO ORDERED (REC. 233) J. Termination of
Counsel and the Emergency Motion 23. With the above provisions in mind,
Plaintiff signed the document and immediately fired his attorney and
provided notice to the court. REC. 221. By doing so, Plaintiff gained access
back to the residency, invalidated the agreement, and was able to use the
time back in the house to run damage control on his business operations
while preparing to expose the Myers-Branthoover enterprise to the court via
a MOTION TO RECONSIDER EVIDENCE AND VACATE TEMPORARY
ORDERS, which was filed on February 9, 2024, within three business days of
the February 1 agreed associate judge’s report being served by the clerk.
REC. 240 24. In this motion, it was specifically stated that: i. “I am seeking
immediate court intervention to correct procedural e rrors and address the
misuse of the legal system by the Petitioner.” REC. 244 ii. “Particularly, Dan
Branthoover became involved. He is the boyfriend of the Petitioner’s Mother.
Shortly thereafter, I received a notice from our joint bank account stating
that $1,576 had just been withdrawn. As our bank statement for December
2023 will demonstrate – the transaction record shows the funds being
transferred directly to Mr. Branthoover’s PayPal account” REC. 245 iii. “The
Petitioner's action of filing for divorce under an Affidavit of Inability to pay
three days after transferring $1,576 to herself starkly contravenes the
mandates set forth in Chapter 10, Section 10.001 of the Civil Practice and
Remedies Code”. REC 247 at B2 iv. “The Petitioner violated Chapter 10,
Section 10.001 a second time within the same document when she
intentionally elected to waive the 60-day waiting period claiming to have an
active protective order against me that found family violence had occurred
during our marriage.” REC 247 at B3. v. “This suit was the second attempt
by the Petitioner to have me removed from the home, which ultimately
succeeded.” REC 248 at D1 25. The motion went on to explain the factual
pattern described up to this point, putting the court on notice of the key
issues with provided exhibits which were duly served on Carter. In response
to Plaintiff’s motion, he received the first of just two email communications
from Carter throughout the case’s history, where she claimed she would be
filing a counter motion when disclosing her availability for the hearing on
Plaintiff’s emergency motion. REC. 2794 No such countermotion was filed
by Carter. K. Summary Judgment and Notice of Hearing 26. By February 22,
no response had been filed by Carter, so Plaintiff filed a Partial Motion for
Summary Judgment. REC. 758. Plaintiff also submitted a proposed parenting
plan as Exhibit D. REC. 769. No response was ever received from Carter. 27.
On February 27, 2024, Defendant Munford signed and issued a notice of
hearing to the parties with the hearing set for March 14, 2024. REC. 776. L.
Plaintiff’s Notice to the Court and Defendant Myers’ Self-Help Remedies 28.
On March 3, 2024, Plaintiff notified the Court that he would not be leaving
the home as it was not in the best interests of his children. REC. 782. 29.
The following day, on March 6, 2024, while walking his daughters to school,
Myers ran inside the family home, and locked him out of the marital
residence, leaving a sign on the door that said “[y]ou should have been out
by Saturday you are now locked out!” REC. 1748. 30. Plaintiff called local
law enforcement to help him regain entry into the home, where mother
produced the agreed associate judge’s report signed on February 1, 2024,
and used it as a means to block Plaintiff’s entrance to the home. 31. To avoid
further conflict, Plaintiff was escorted into the home where he was able to
grab only his computer and a few clothes and went to Flower Mound to

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
temporarily stay with his father until the time of the hearing on his
emergency motion, scheduled for March 14, 2024, at 9:00 A.M. L. The
Hearing On Plaintiff’s Emergency Motion 32. On March 14, 2024, the
parties arrived at the 322nd District Court, and on the way into the
courtroom, defendants Myers and Carter could be seen in the conference
room, quickly shuffling papers back and forth. 33. After checking in with the
bailiff, Plaintiff turned around to see defendant Carter extending to him a
document titled “Temporary Orders” that were the reduced version of the
February 1 associate judge’s report. REC. 888. 34. These orders, which were
not prepared by Dan Bacalis, which were not agreed to by the parties, were
reduced well outside of the 20-day requirement as ordered by the judge, and
which were never filed with the clerk, stated the following
misrepresentations: i. On February 1, 2024, the Court heard Petitioner's
motion for temporary orders. ii. The parties have agreed to the terms of this
order as evidenced by the signatures below. REC. 888. iii. The Court, after
examining the record and the agreement of the parties and hearing the
evidence and argument of counsel, finds that all necessary prerequisites of
the law have been legally satisfied and that the Court has jurisdiction of this
case and of all the parties. REC. 888. iv. The dates that the parties would
have access to the family residence was altered, changing the date Plaintiff
was supposed to leave from March 1, 2024, to March 20, 2024, and
changing Myers’ date of re-entry from March 1, 2024, to March 30, 2024,
leaving a 10-day window where no one would occupy the residence. v. This
modification was made to prevent Myers from being liable for illegally
locking Plaintiff out of the home on March 6, 2024. 35. On the last page of
the orders, Plaintiff’s attorney who was terminated weeks earlier did not
sign the document, and Plaintiff refused to sign the document for the
forthcoming reasons: i. It claimed a hearing occurred on a motion which was
never set for a hearing or served on the Plaintiff and doesn’t exist on the
docket. ii. It was prepared by defendant Carter, not Dan Bacalis. iii. The
associate judge was presiding over a de novo request of his own prior
report. iv. The matrimonial address was incorrect, as it stated “6641 Anns
Court”, rather than 6641 Anne Court. REC. 915, REC. 922 v. The orders
were not in the best interests of the children. vi. Notwithstanding the
Plaintiff’s revocation of consent by filing the emergency motion, the terms
were altered right before they were rendered into effect by defendant
Kaitcer. vii. Plaintiff did not agree to the terms as he was in court that very
day to expose Myers. M. Predicate Acts: Extortion 36. Kaitcer, knowing that
no response was filed, knowing that he was presiding over a hearing to
which he had no subject matter jurisdiction, and knowing that the temporary
orders produced by defendant Carter was served just moments earlier,
signed another associate judge’s report pre-drafted by defendant Carter,
which summarily denied the Plaintiff’s emergency motion, ignored the fact
that Carter had not provided a response, and within the report itself,
Plaintiff was ordered to sign the document that Carter had just presented to
him despite raising objections to its’ contents, and despite his consent not
being present. REC. 795. 37. Finally, defendant Kaitcer refused to consider
Plaintiff’s exhibits, including six affidavits prepared by his business clients
who have been directly affected by his inability to provide the real-time
market data services his clients relied on, who were located throughout the
United States. REC. 851; REC. 854; REC. 857; REC. 860; REC. 863; REC.
867; REC. 870. 38. Following the setting, the orders were rendered into

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
effect without Plaintiff’s signature (REC. 925) , and Plaintiff filed a request
for findings of fact and conclusions of law (REC. 883), and filed and
amended a “Preparatory Notice for Judicial Review” which recounted the
factual timeline up to that point, and included the affidavits that Kaitcer
refused to accept on March 14, 2024. REC. 798, REC. 851, REC. 854, REC.
857, REC. 860, REC. 863, REC. 867, REC. 870. 39. The orders stated they
were to remain in effect until the final decree of divorce, and Plaintiff’s
journey of one-sided appeals began. N. One Sided Appellate Efforts, and
Defective IWO 40. Following the rendition of the temporary orders on March
26, 2024, Plaintiff spent between April 8, 2024 and September 15, 2024,
appealing via mandamus to the Second Court of Appeals and the Texas
Supreme Court. REC. 1010. 41. During the appellate efforts, Carter filed one
of two motions in the case, which was a motion for pre-trial conference filed
on April 24, 2024, on her behalf by Roderick D. Marx, a party not named in
the suit. REC. 1014, REC. 1016. 42. Plaintiff immediately objected to the
pre-trial conference, and no response was ever issued by Carter or the
court. REC. 1018. 43. On April 30th, Plaintiff filed his notice of completion
regarding the parenting course as ordered, despite actively trying to vacate
them. REC. 1047. No parenting course was ever completed by Myers. 44. On
May 2, 2024, Plaintiff’s en banc reconsideration was denied in the Second
Court of Appeals, and he began preparing an appeal to the Supreme Court
of Texas. REC. 1067. 45. On May 19, 2024, Carter sent the second and last
email correspondence that would be received in the case, which falsely
claimed he agreed to the orders signed on March 14, 2024, and requested
that he fill out an IWO, which Plaintiff found to be defective. REC. 1722,
REC. 1728. No further correspondence was received by Carter. O.
Fraudulent Intervention and Branthoover’s Continued Involvement 46. On
June 23rd Plaintiff filed a motion in state court entitled MOTION FOR
JOINDER OF PERSONS NEEDED FOR JUST ADJUDICATION at 12:14 P.M.
REC. 1075. This motion received no response from Carter. 47. On June 23rd
at 1:54 P.M., directly following the submission of the motion, Branthoover
texted Plaintiff stating “Lol. And here comes another denial. Please sue me
individually. Please.”, referring to the earlier filed motion and showing his
continued oversight of the case’s progression since his initial predicate acts.
48. Four days later, on June 28, 2024, the Texas Office of the Attorney
General allegedly filed an intervention pleading, claiming that Plaintiff was
past due on child support, and requested information from Plaintiff. REC.
1099. 49. Most notably, the certificate of service to this intervention
pleading was allegedly signed by Holly Hayes, the designated attorney for
the OAG, yet the name underneath the signature line reads CHOYA
BURKLEY. REC. 1102. 50. Plaintiff promptly objected to the intervention,
and never received any response from the OAG, Carter, or the court. REC.
1106. P. Supreme Court, Rule 12, and Emergency Temporary Orders 51. As
Plaintiff continued to appeal to the Supreme Court of Texas, all prosecution
came to an end in the trial court. It wasn’t until September 15, 2024, that
Plaintiff filed a first amended rehearing motion in the Texas Supreme Court,
(REC. 1136) and after noticing Carter’s lack of participation, he began to
question her authority given several ambiguities surrounding her
representation, and filed a rule 12 motion to show authority. REC. 1170. No
response was ever received to this motion from Carter. 52. At this point,
Plaintiff had been staying in Airbnb homes while he sought relief to ensure
he could remain close to his daughters during this time. On September 26,

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
2024, he filed and later amended an EMERGENCY MOTION FOR
TEMPORARY ORDERS and requested expedited relief by October 1, 2024,
as that was when Plaintiff was forced to move away from the area due to
cost of living being unsustainable. REC. 1184. No response was ever
received from Carter regarding this motion. 53. By October 1, Plaintiff had
no choice but to start pursuing administrative remedies, and thought the
court was biased against him given the case’s history up to that point. He
began to prepare a Joint Motion to Recuse defendants Munford and Kaitcer
and filed it with the clerk of the court on October 7, 2024. REC. 1197. Q.
Predicate Act: Wire Fraud 54. On October 8, 2024, Defendant Munford
signed and forwarded a “Joint Motion to Recuse” attached to his order of
referral to regional presiding judge David L. Evans but was notably missing
the exhibits and affidavit critical to the motion. REC. 1222 55. A copy of this
exchange was sent via defendant Baker on 4:43 P.M. on October 8. REC.
1254 56. Plaintiff immediately pointed out the discrepancies between the
motion filed and the motion forwarded to David L. Evans, where she replied
and admitted that the full document had been e-filed and remains with the
court. REC. 1255 57. Unsatisfied with this response, Plaintiff further pointed
out that the filing size of the document filed and the one referring to David
L. Evans was significantly different. No further correspondence was
received by Baker until the following day. REC. 1256 58. The following day
on October 8, 2024, defendant Munford signed and filed an “Amended Order
of Referral” which had the full motion attached this time, albeit still
modified as the hyperlinks and bookmarks had been removed. REC. 1282 59.
This amended referral was sent via email correspondence by Baker at 11:17
A.M. on October 8, 2024, who stated that due to the size of the motion, it
was split into three parts. REC. 1258. This excuse directly contradicts the
standard filing procedure in Tarrant County, which was raised and
subsequently ignored in an objection. REC. 1269. No response was filed in
regard to the motion to recuse or objection by Carter. R. Recusal Denial and
More Delays, and Federal Removal 60. Justice E. Lee Gabriel was assigned
to hear the motion, which had to be rescheduled due to technical difficulties
for November 7, 2024. REC. 1306. 61. The morning of the hearing, Plaintiff
woke up with a dental emergency, and promptly notified all parties, and
requested a reset for the hearing, which everyone agreed to. REC.
1393-1396. 62. Despite this agreement, the recusal was denied for failure to
appear, and made no mention of the agreement or the emergency. REC.
1398. 63. With no other remedies left, Plaintiff removed the case to Federal
Court on December 2, 2024, which was quickly remanded back on
December 4, 2024. REC. 1426. 64. On December 14, 2024, defendant
Branthoover texted Plaintiff, sending a threat which stated “[w]hen things
all over, you get to deal with me.” at 2:15 P.M. REC. 1720 65. On December
16, 2024, Plaintiff initiated suit against Daniel Kenneth Branthoover in the
Western District of Oklahoma seeking relief in the form of damages from the
ongoing deprivation from his home. REC. 1451. 66. Plaintiff notified the
Texas court of this lawsuit on December 31, 2024. REC. 1446. S. Further
Delays, Motion to Dismiss for Want of Prosecution, and the Original SAPCR
67. On January 24, 2025, Plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss for want of
prosecution due to the total lack of participation in the case by the opposing
party. REC. 1527. No response was ever received from Carter on this
motion. 68. On January 29, 2025, defendant Myers began disposing of
Plaintiff’s personal belongings that remained on the family property. REC.

=== PAGE 9 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
1629-1631. 69. On February 12, 2025, Plaintiff learned that his youngest
daughter was suffering from dental pain due to Myers’ failure to obtain
dental insurance for the children. REC. 3281. 70. By March 14, (REC.
1833-1837) the judges had still not been reinstated from the first recusal,
which lad Plaintiff to reach out to Baker to request a hearing on his
unopposed summary judgment that had been on the docket since February
22, 2024, where he had to remind her to reinstate the judges back into the
case. REC. 1833-1837. 71. Given the delays, and since the case had been
brought in bad faith initially, the Plaintiff opened an original SAPCR suit in
the 233rd District Court of Tarrant County on March 18, 2025, where he
argued for dominant jurisdiction in a cover letter sent to the clerk. REC.
2260. T. Counsel Suddenly Becomes Active 72. The very next day, defendant
Carter filed an original answer filed on her behalf by Roderick Marx. REC.
2279. The motion was a boilerplate motion, and was followed by a motion to
consolidate, which was filed in the wrong court, and was also filed on
Carter’s behalf by RODERICK D. MARX. REC. 2284. 73. The Plaintiff
immediately responded by filing a motion to strike (REC. 1957) a Rule 12
motion to show authority challenging both Carter and RODERICK D MARX’s
authority (REC. 2288) and on March 24, 2025, an emergency ex-parte TRO
to prevent Myers from barring Plaintiff’s access to the home. (REC. 2302)
No responses were ever received from Carter on these motions. 74. On
March 26, 2025, an objection was filed to Carter’s consolidation motion in
the 233rd court. REC. 1881. 75. Plaintiff reached out to the coordinator from
the 233rd and went through the process to present the motion to the judge.
REC. 2338-2341. 76. On March 29, 2025, Plaintiff appeared before Associate
Judge Kate Stone, who refused to hear Plaintiff’s emergency motion despite
no response being filed, and told him to leave the courtroom. The hearing
date scheduled for April 10, 2025, as agreed by Carter and Plaintiff (REC.
2358), was actually un-set by Stone. REC. 2361. 77. The grounds for this
outright refusal was due to Carter calling in a favor from the judge without
even being present in the courtroom, to where Stone left the room, came
back, and told the Plaintiff to leave informing him that a motion to
consolidate would be filed by Carter the following week. U. Five Concurrent
Mandamus Petitions 78. Subsequently, after he was turned away from the
courtroom, Carter’s consolidation motion wasn’t filed until April 4, 2025
(REC. 2367), resulting in two mandamus petitions to try again to have the
March 14, 2024, order signed by Kaitcer vacated, and to compel Kate Stone
to hear the emergency TRO. See 25-0361, 25-0367. 79. On the same day the
mandamus was filed against Stone, District Judge Kenneth Newell sua
sponte granted Carter’s consolidation motion in both courts without a
hearing, and without addressing the emergency situation for the children or
the Plaintiff’s objections, leading to a third mandamus proceeding. REC.
2393, See also 25-0378. 80. On April 23, 2025, a notice of trial setting was
served on the parties by defendant Munford in the midst of all of these
issues. REC. 1773. 81. The same day, Plaintiff filed an objection and
requested an emergency stay. REC. 2219. No response was received to this
objection by either Munford or Carter. 82. Two days later on April 25, 2025,
Plaintiff filed his second recusal motion, and amended it on April 28, 2025,
this time only against Munford, and requested that the rules of procedure be
followed, and objected to the involvement of the court coordinator given the
prior recusal’s ambiguity and significant delays caused by her involvement.
REC. 2488 No response to this motion was ever filed from Carter. 83. Baker

=== PAGE 10 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
continued to be involved in the recusal process, this time erroneously
forwarding an order of referral from defendant Kaitcer, who was not named
in the recusal motion. REC. 2615. 84. Plaintiff immediately objected on April
29, 2025, naming two issues: 1) the coordinator was still involved, and 2) the
order of referral sent by Kaitcer was erroneous. REC. 2620. 84. Plaintiff
objected to the order of assignment of John H. Cayce (REC. 3149) which was
issued on May 7, 2025, due to the unresolves issues. REC. 2620. 85. David L.
Evans overruled this objection on May 15, 2025, leading to mandamus
petition 25-0426, a direct appeal to the Texas Supreme Court. REC. 3507.
86. On May 20, 2025, John H. Cayce summarily denied the recusal, including
the denial of a motion to recuse Kaitcer which was never filed, leading to
mandamus petition 25-0458, a second direct appeal to the Texas Supreme
Court. 87. All five petitions were denied both initially and on rehearing, and
all emergency motions to stay proceedings were dismissed. The only insights
given from the appellate courts was: “Denied, per curiam.” No response was
filed by any implicated judge or opposing counsel. V. Federal RICO Case and
the Push Towards Final Trial 88. In June of 2025, Plaintiff amended his
complaint against Daniel Kenneth Branthoover and enjoined Myers as a
defendant, which they defended pro-se. 89. Plaintiff communicated this
action with the trial court, and no further action was taken in the case until
August of 2025, when defendant Munford sua sponte set the case for final
trial on December 10, 2025. 90. Plaintiff immediately objected to this trial
setting, and moved to recuse Munford for a third time. 91. The court
coordinator continued to be involved in the process, leading to a subsequent
motion to recuse the regional presiding judge, David L. Evans. 92. Plaintiff
now prepares this suit to hold defendants accountable for their collective
actions, and to prevent their common goal from being achieved, which is to
obtain defendant Myers a final decree of divorce. 93. For the forthcoming
reasons, the conduct outlined herein constitutes conduct of an enterprise
through a pattern of racketeering activity, as several predicate acts were
committed, the enterprise shares a common purpose, and Plaintiff has
suffered direct and ongoing injury to business and property as a direct result
of the defendant’s collective predicate acts. RICO The timeline and evidence
provided demonstrate that the Myers-Branthoover group constitutes an
association-in-fact enterprise under RICO, with a common goal to deprive
the Plaintiff of his home and business through a pattern of racketeering
activity—specifically, wire fraud, Travel Act violations, and fraudulent court
filings—causing direct injury to the Plaintiff’s business and property. The
conduct, structure, and continuity among the participants, as well as the use
of interstate communications and travel, satisfy the elements of a RICO
claim in the Tenth Circuit, with the liability of other defendants depending
on their knowledge and intent. A. Summary The Myers-Branthoover
enterprise, as detailed in the factual timeline, meets the Tenth Circuit’s
requirements for a RICO claim by establishing an association-in-fact
enterprise with a defined structure, purpose, and continuity. The group’s
coordinated actions—including interstate transfer of funds, preparation and
submission of fraudulent legal documents, and ongoing manipulation of
court proceedings—constitute a pattern of racketeering activity, with
predicate acts of wire fraud and Travel Act violations that are related and
continuous. Plaintiff’s direct and ongoing injury to his business and property,
including loss of home, business operations, and client relationships, is
proximately caused by the enterprise’s acts. While Myers and Branthoover’s

=== PAGE 11 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
liability is clear, the involvement of other defendants (Munford, Kaitcer,
Carter, and Baker) may be characterized as inadvertent or willing
participation, depending on their knowledge and intent, but the core
elements of a RICO violation are satisfied by the conduct of Myers and
Branthoover as outlined in the enumerated timeline. The additional acts
committed by each defendant, as alleged, furthered the scheme of the
enterprise despite each additional defendant having actual knowledge of the
fraudulent scheme. RICO Statutory Framework The Racketeer Influenced
and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), codified at 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961–1968,
provides a civil cause of action for individuals injured in their business or
property by reason of a pattern of racketeering activity conducted through
an enterprise affecting interstate or foreign commerce. The most commonly
invoked provision, § 1962(c), prohibits any person employed by or associated
with an enterprise from conducting or participating in the conduct of such
enterprise’s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity. Section
1962(d) further prohibits conspiracies to violate any of the substantive RICO
provisions. To establish a civil RICO claim under § 1962(c), a plaintiff must
prove: i. The existence of an enterprise; ii. The enterprise’s engagement in,
or effect on, interstate or foreign commerce; iii. The defendant’s
employment by or association with the enterprise; iv. The defendant’s
participation, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of the enterprise’s affairs;
v. The defendant’s participation through a pattern of racketeering activity or
collection of unlawful debt. See 100 Mount Holly Bypass v. Axos Bank, Case
No. 2:20-CV-856-TS-CMR (D. Utah Jul 27, 2021). B. Predicate Acts and
Pattern Requirement RICO defines “racketeering activity” to include a wide
range of criminal offenses, including wire fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343) and
violations of the Travel Act (18 U.S.C. § 1952). A “pattern of racketeering
activity” requires at least two predicate acts within a ten-year period, but
the acts must be related and amount to or pose a threat of continued
criminal activity. The Supreme Court has clarified that a RICO violation
requires both an “enterprise” and a “pattern of racketeering activity,” with
the enterprise being a group of persons associated for a common purpose,
and the pattern involving a series of criminal acts (United States v. Harris,
695 F.3d 1125 (10th Cir. 2012)). The Tenth Circuit has further explained
that, to establish a pattern, it is not enough to simply show that two
predicate acts occurred within ten years; the acts must also be related and
pose a threat of continued criminal activity (U.S. v. Smith, 413 F.3d 1253
(10th Cir. 2005)). Note, however, that U.S. v. Smith has been stated as
overruled by United States v. Nissen, 555 F.Supp.3d 1174 (D. N.M. 2021) on
unrelated grounds, but its articulation of the pattern requirement remains
consistent with current law. C. Enterprise and Association-in-Fact An
“enterprise” under RICO includes any individual, partnership, corporation,
association, or group of individuals associated in fact, even if not a legal
entity. For an association-in-fact enterprise, the Tenth Circuit requires: i. A
purpose; ii. Relationships among those associated with the enterprise; iii.
Longevity sufficient to permit the associates to pursue the enterprise’s
purpose; iv. A decision-making framework or mechanism for controlling the
group; v. Functioning as a continuing unit; vi. Existence separate and apart
from the pattern of racketeering activity. See 100 Mount Holly Bypass. D.
Conspiracy Section 1962(d) makes it unlawful to conspire to violate any of
the substantive RICO provisions. A RICO conspiracy does not require the
establishment of an enterprise but requires that a defendant adopts the goal

=== PAGE 12 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
of furthering or facilitating a criminal endeavor that would satisfy the
elements of a substantive RICO offense (United States v. Martinez, 543
F.Supp.3d 1209 (D. N.M. 2021); United States v. Randall, 661 F.3d 1291
(10th Cir. 2011)). E. Injury Requirement RICO provides a private right of
action for individuals injured in their business or property through
fraudulent conduct, and there is no requirement that the conduct be
connected to organized crime in a civil setting (Plains Resources, Inc. v.
Gable, 782 F.2d 883 (10th Cir. 1986)). ANALYSIS F. Existence of an
Association-in-Fact Enterprise The timeline establishes that Myers and
Branthoover formed an association-in-fact enterprise beginning in December
2023 (¶¶ 1–7, 93). Their collaboration was structured, with Myers as the
petitioner in the divorce and Branthoover as the planner, drafter, and
facilitator of fraudulent documents and financial transactions. The group
had a clear purpose: to divest the Plaintiff of his home and business through
fraudulent legal filings and manipulation of court processes (¶¶ 1–7, 93).
The enterprise’s structure is evidenced by: i. The initial planning and
agreement to meet in Yukon, Oklahoma, to draft fraudulent documents (¶¶
1–3); ii. The use of interstate communications and travel to further the
scheme (¶¶ 2–3); iii. Ongoing coordination and adaptation to changing
circumstances, including the preparation and submission of false affidavits
and pleadings, and manipulation of court proceedings (¶¶ 5–7, 34, 93). This
satisfies the Tenth Circuit’s requirements for an association-in-fact
enterprise, which does not require a formal legal entity but does require a
common purpose, relationships, and sufficient longevity to pursue the
enterprise’s goals. G. Structure, Purpose, Relationships, and Continuity The
Myers-Branthoover group meets the requirements for an association-in-fact
enterprise: i. Purpose: The shared goal was to deprive the Plaintiff of his
home, business, and property interests through fraudulent means (¶¶ 1–7,
93). ii. Relationships: Myers and Branthoover maintained ongoing
communications, coordinated actions, and divided roles in the scheme (¶¶ 1–
7, 93). iii. Longevity and Continuity: The enterprise operated over a
substantial period, from at least December 2023 through present day 2025,
with multiple related acts and ongoing adaptation to changing
circumstances (¶¶ 1–93). iv. Decision-Making Framework: The group
planned, agreed on steps, and executed those steps in a coordinated manner
(¶¶ 1–7, 93). v. Existence Separate from Predicate Acts: The enterprise was
formed for the purpose of achieving a specific goal and engaged in multiple
acts over time to accomplish that goal. H. Predicate Acts: Wire Fraud, Travel
Act Violations, and Fraudulent Filings The timeline identifies multiple
predicate acts that qualify as racketeering activity under RICO: i. Wire
Fraud: Myers transferred $1,576 in marital funds to Branthoover’s PayPal
account during interstate travel, and these funds were used to purchase a
phone for use in the fraudulent scheme (¶¶ 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 34). The use of
electronic communications (text messages, emails) to plan and execute the
scheme further supports the wire fraud allegation (¶¶ 1–7, 34). ii. Travel Act
Violations: Myers traveled from Texas to Oklahoma to meet with
Branthoover, where they planned and prepared fraudulent legal documents,
which were then transported back to Texas and submitted to the court (¶¶ 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, 7). iii. Fraudulent Filings: The preparation and submission of false
affidavits and pleadings to the court, containing material misrepresentations
about financial status, family violence, and property ownership, constitute
further predicate acts (¶¶ 5, 6, 7, 34). At least two related predicate acts

=== PAGE 13 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
within ten years are required (U.S. v. Smith, 413 F.3d 1253 (10th Cir. 2005)),
and the timeline shows multiple, related predicate acts over a substantial
period (¶¶ 1–93). I. Pattern of Racketeering Activity: Relatedness and
Continuity The predicate acts were not isolated incidents but part of an
ongoing scheme. The acts were related in that they all aimed to deprive the
Plaintiff of his property and business, and they posed a threat of continued
criminal activity, as the enterprise continued to operate and adapt its tactics
over time (¶¶ 1–93). The timeline shows that the enterprise’s activities
extended over a substantial period, with multiple acts occurring over
months and involving ongoing coordination and adaptation to changing
circumstances. J. Injury to Business or Property Plaintiff suffered direct and
ongoing injury to his business and property as a result of the enterprise’s
actions. He was deprived of his home and business operations, lost access to
marital funds, and was unable to provide services to clients, resulting in
financial harm (¶¶ 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 37). These injuries are precisely the type
of harm RICO is designed to redress. Plains Resources, Inc. v. Gable, 782 F.
2d 883 (10th Cir. 1986)). K. Participation of Other Defendants: Inadvertent
or Willing The timeline raises the question of whether Munford, Kaitcer,
Carter, and Baker were victims of the initial scheme or willing participants
in the expanded enterprise. The evidence suggests that, at a minimum,
Myers and Branthoover were the core members of the enterprise, with
others potentially becoming involved through their actions in the legal
proceedings (¶¶ 14–93). i. Inadvertent Participation: Some defendants may
have participated inadvertently, such as by issuing orders or facilitating
court processes without knowledge of the underlying scheme (¶¶ 14–93). ii.
Willing Participation: Others may have become willing participants if they
knowingly furthered the enterprise’s objectives or ignored clear evidence of
fraud and misrepresentation (¶¶ 14–93). RICO does not impose liability for
inadvertent or unwitting participation; there must be knowing and willful
involvement in the conduct of the enterprise’s affairs. For the forthcoming
reasons, Plaintiff alleges that the Defendants are willing participants in the
scheme. VICTIM OR PARTICIPANT RICO liability extends to those who
knowingly participate in the conduct of the enterprise’s affairs, even if they
were not original members (RICO: A Primer (2022-01-31)). The timeline
raises the question of whether Munford, Kaitcer, Carter, and Baker were
victims of the initial scheme or willing participants in the expanded
enterprise. The evidence suggests that, at a minimum, Myers and
Branthoover were the core members of the enterprise, with others becoming
involved through their actions in the legal proceedings (¶¶ 14–93). The
timeline demonstrates that Carter, Kaitcer, and Myers engaged in extortion
by leveraging the threat of adverse legal action, fraudulent court orders, and
the manipulation of judicial process to coerce Plaintiff into relinquishing
property and business interests, satisfying the elements of extortion as a
predicate act under RICO and the Travel Act. Munford and Baker, for their
part, committed wire fraud by intentionally sending altered or incomplete
court documents via interstate email, with the intent to mislead, obstruct
relief, and further the enterprise’s objective of finalizing the divorce and
depriving Plaintiff of his property, thus meeting the requirements for wire
fraud as a RICO predicate act. These acts, as detailed in the timeline, are
not isolated but part of a coordinated pattern of racketeering activity within
an association-in-fact enterprise, as required by RICO in the Tenth Circuit.
The conduct of each defendant is tied to specific predicate acts—extortion

=== PAGE 14 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
for Carter, Kaitcer, and Myers (notably at timeline events 33–37), and wire
fraud for Munford and Baker (notably at events 54–59, 83)—demonstrating
knowing and willful participation in the enterprise’s broader scheme to
deprive Plaintiff of his home and business through fraudulent and coercive
means. A. Extortion and Wire Fraud The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961–1968, provides a civil cause of
action for injury to business or property caused by a pattern of racketeering
activity conducted through an enterprise affecting interstate commerce.
Predicate acts under RICO include extortion (as defined by the Hobbs Act
and the Travel Act) and wire fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343), among others.
Extortion is defined as obtaining property from another, with his consent,
induced by wrongful use of actual or threatened force, violence, or fear, or
under color of official right. The Travel Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1952, includes
extortion as an “unlawful activity” and does not require it to be part of a
business enterprise (U.S. v. Welch, 327 F.3d 1081 (10th Cir. 2003)). The
Tenth Circuit recognizes that extortion under the Travel Act can be
established by showing threats or coercion to obtain something of value,
including property or legal rights, in violation of state or federal law. Wire
fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343 requires (1) a scheme to defraud or obtain
property by false or fraudulent pretenses, (2) intent to defraud, and (3) use
of interstate wire communications to execute the scheme (Clinton v. Sec.
Benefit Life Ins. Co., 63 F.4th 1264 (10th Cir. 2023); United States v.
Holloway, 826 F.3d 1237 (10th Cir. 2016)). The Tenth Circuit requires that
the deprivation of property be a central object of the scheme, and that the
use of wires (including email) be knowing and in furtherance of the
fraudulent scheme (United States v. Tao, 629 F.Supp.3d 1083). B. Extortion
by Carter, Kaitcer, and Myers Extortion, as a RICO predicate act, is defined
broadly under federal law and the Travel Act. It includes obtaining property
or rights through threats, coercion, or misuse of official process (U.S. v.
Welch, 327 F.3d 1081 (10th Cir. 2003)). The Tenth Circuit does not require
extortion to be part of a business enterprise for Travel Act purposes; a single
act suffices if it has the requisite interstate nexus. The timeline shows the
following: i. Event 33–34: Carter, with Myers, prepared and presented
“Temporary Orders” that misrepresented facts (e.g., that Plaintiff agreed to
terms he did not, that a hearing occurred when it did not, and that the
orders were in the best interests of the children). These orders altered the
dates of access to the home to shield Myers from liability for locking Plaintiff
out, and were presented to Plaintiff in a context where he was under threat
of losing his home and business. iii. Event 36: Kaitcer, knowing the orders
were disputed and that no response had been filed, signed an associate
judge’s report pre-drafted by Carter, summarily denying Plaintiff’s
emergency motion and ordering Plaintiff to sign the disputed document,
despite his objections and lack of consent. iv. Event 35: Plaintiff refused to
sign the orders for multiple reasons, including their fraudulent content and
the lack of due process, but the orders were rendered into effect without his
signature. These acts collectively demonstrate the use of legal process and
the threat of adverse judicial action to coerce Plaintiff into surrendering his
property and business interests. The manipulation of court orders, the
misrepresentation of facts, and the pressure to sign under threat of losing
his home constitute extortion under the Travel Act and RICO (U.S. v. Welch,
327 F.3d 1081 (10th Cir. 2003). Myers’s role is clear: she was the beneficiary
and instigator of the fraudulent filings and the manipulation of court

=== PAGE 15 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
process, using the threat of legal action and the actual deprivation of
Plaintiff’s property to achieve her goal. Carter and Kaitcer acted in concert
with Myers, knowingly facilitating the extortion by preparing, presenting,
and enforcing fraudulent orders, and by using the authority of the court to
coerce Plaintiff. The fact that Plaintiff was ordered to sign a document he
objected to, under threat of continued deprivation of his home and business,
is classic extortion by color of official right. All three defendants knew that
Plaintiff did not agree to the order, as he had just fired his attorney to
challenge any basis for an agreement. This implies that despite the motion
being served on all defendants, they chose to ignore the allegations of a
fraudulent scheme and further the affairs of the enterprise. These actions
meet the requirements for extortion as a RICO predicate act: they involved
the wrongful use of threats and official process to obtain property (the home
and business) from Plaintiff, with his consent induced by fear of further loss
or legal harm. The acts were not isolated but part of a coordinated scheme
to achieve the enterprise’s goal of finalizing the divorce and divesting
Plaintiff of his property B. Wire Fraud by Munford and Baker Wire fraud
under 18 U.S.C. § 1343 requires a scheme to defraud, intent to defraud, and
use of interstate wire communications to execute the scheme (Clinton v. Sec.
Benefit Life Ins. Co., 63 F.4th 1264 (10th Cir. 2023); United States v.
Holloway, 826 F.3d 1237 (10th Cir. 2016)). The Tenth Circuit recognizes that
sending altered or incomplete court documents via email, with the intent to
mislead or deprive someone of property or rights, can constitute wire fraud
if the deprivation of property is a central object of the scheme (United
States v. Tao, 629 F.Supp.3d 1083). The timeline shows the following: i.
Event 54: Munford signed and forwarded a “Joint Motion to Recuse”
attached to his order of referral, but the document was missing critical
exhibits and affidavits necessary for Plaintiff’s relief. ii. Event 55: Baker sent
a copy of this incomplete filing via email, representing it as the full
document. iii. Event 56–57: When Plaintiff pointed out the discrepancies,
Baker provided inconsistent explanations, first claiming the full document
was e-filed, then later stating it was split into three parts due to size. iv.
Event 58: Munford signed and filed an “Amended Order of Referral” with the
full motion attached, but with hyperlinks and bookmarks removed, further
impairing the document’s integrity. v. Event 59, 83: Baker continued to
forward altered or incomplete orders and referrals, even when procedural
irregularities were raised. These acts involved the knowing use of interstate
email to transmit altered or incomplete court documents, with the intent to
prevent Plaintiff from obtaining relief and to further the enterprise’s goal of
finalizing the divorce and depriving Plaintiff of his property. The use of email
to transmit these documents satisfies the interstate wire requirement, and
the intent to defraud is evidenced by the deliberate alteration and
misrepresentation of the filings. The conduct of Munford and Baker meets
the elements of wire fraud: (1) a scheme to defraud Plaintiff of property and
rights, (2) intent to defraud by preventing relief and misleading the court
and Plaintiff, and (3) use of interstate wire communications (email) to
execute the scheme (Clinton v. Sec. Benefit Life Ins. Co., 63 F.4th 1264 (10th
Cir. 2023)). The deprivation of property (Plaintiff’s home and business) was
a central object of the scheme, not a minor part. RELATIONSHIP AND
CONTINUITY All these acts—extortion by Carter, Kaitcer, and Myers, and
wire fraud by Munford and Baker—were committed in furtherance of the
Myers-Branthoover enterprise’s overarching objective: to finalize the

=== PAGE 16 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
divorce and divest Plaintiff of his home and business. The acts were
coordinated, continuous, and related, satisfying the RICO pattern
requirement. The timeline shows that each defendant’s conduct was not an
isolated error or routine administrative act, but part of a deliberate scheme
to use the legal process, threats, and fraudulent communications to achieve
the enterprise’s unlawful goals. DAMAGES The harm inflicted upon Plaintiff
is staggering. He has lost the home in which he lived for nearly a third of his
life, the companionship of his spouse, and the society of his children. His
income has collapsed. For two years he has been consigned to a futile
appellate gauntlet, even as Defendants Munford, Kaitcer, Baker, and Carter
have repeatedly exceeded the bounds of their lawful authority in furtherance
of a broader scheme. What began as a concerted effort by Myers and
Branthoover to dispossess Plaintiff of his residence and property
metastasized into a calculated plan to procure a final decree of divorce once
the initial objective had been achieved. The objective was plain: by
engineering a final decree, Defendants would not only hobble Plaintiff’s
ability to bring this suit but also invite invocation of the Rooker–Feldman
doctrine and related abstention principles to preclude federal jurisdiction.
Now, after two years of unremitting effort, Plaintiff seeks the only
meaningful remedy remaining: federal redress to halt the ongoing abuses of
authority, to unwind tainted actions, and to compensate him fully for the
catastrophic losses Defendants have wrought. Take each piece in the TABLE
OF CONTENTS, research the topic, and tie it to the factual timeline, filling
out each element of the RICO complaint and tie each element to the factual
allegations by enumerated paragraph number. What are the legal
requirements for the introduction section of a civil RICO complaint in the
Fifth Circuit, and what elements should be included to properly frame the
case?
Answer (Fifth Circuit)
Short response
In the Fifth Circuit, the introduction section of a civil RICO complaint must
clearly allege the existence of an enterprise, a pattern of racketeering
activity, the defendant’s connection to the enterprise, and the resulting
injury to the plaintiff’s business or property, all supported by specific factual
allegations. The introduction should also establish subject matter
jurisdiction, identify the statutory basis for the claim, and frame the case by
outlining the core elements and the factual context that will be detailed in
the body of the complaint.
Summary
To properly frame a civil RICO case in the Fifth Circuit, the introduction
must do more than recite statutory language; it must succinctly set out the
essential elements of a RICO claim—namely, the existence of an enterprise,
a pattern of racketeering activity, the defendant’s participation in the
enterprise’s affairs through that pattern, and a causal link to injury in the
plaintiff’s business or property. The introduction should also reference the

=== PAGE 17 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
relevant statutory provisions (typically 18 U.S.C. § 1962), assert federal
jurisdiction, and provide a concise overview of the factual circumstances
that support each element, including the nature of the enterprise, the types
of predicate acts alleged, and the harm suffered.
The Fifth Circuit requires that the introduction section of a RICO complaint
provide a clear roadmap for the court and defendants, demonstrating that
the plaintiff’s claims are grounded in specific facts rather than conclusory
statements. This includes identifying the parties, the enterprise (whether a
legal entity or association-in-fact), the pattern and continuity of racketeering
acts, and the direct injury to business or property, all while complying with
the heightened pleading standards for fraud-based predicate acts under
Rule 9(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
Background and Relevant Law
Statutory and Pleading Requirements
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), codified at
18 U.S.C. §§ 1961–1968, provides a civil cause of action for any person
injured in their business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962.
The Fifth Circuit has consistently held that to state a civil RICO claim, a
plaintiff must allege: (1) a person who engages in (2) a pattern of
racketeering activity (3) connected to the acquisition, establishment,
conduct, or control of an enterprise (Bustos v. Invierte En Tex. (2024-06-03); 
D&T Partners LLC v. Baymark Partners LP (2022-05-09); Aubrey v. D
Magazine Partners, L.P. (2020-02-10); Gabriel v. Outlaw, CASE NO. 3:20-
CV-60-E-BK (N.D. Tex. Mar 01, 2021)).
The introduction must also establish that the alleged enterprise affects
interstate or foreign commerce, that the defendant participated in the
conduct of the enterprise’s affairs, and that the plaintiff suffered injury to
business or property as a result (U.S. v. Welch, 656 F.2d 1039 (5th Cir.
1981); RICO: A Primer (2022-01-31)). For claims based on fraud (such as
wire or mail fraud), the complaint must meet the heightened pleading
standard of Rule 9(b), requiring particularity as to the circumstances of the
fraud—specifically, the time, place, content of the misrepresentations, and
the identity of the persons making them (Arruda v. Curves Int'l, Inc., No.
20-50734 (5th Cir. Jun 28, 2021); Holliday v. Goodell, Civil Action 25-264
(E.D. La. Mar 06, 2025)).
Case Law Guidance
Federal courts in the Fifth Circuit require that the introduction section of a
RICO complaint do more than recite the elements; it must provide a
plausible claim for relief, supported by factual allegations that allow the
court to infer the existence of each element (McCoy v. McCormick, Civil
Action 22-443-BAJ-RLB (M.D. La. Feb 15, 2023); Bradley v. Phillips
Petroleum Co., 527 F.Supp.2d 625 (S.D. Tex. 2007)). The introduction should
not be a mere formulaic recitation or a series of conclusory statements

=== PAGE 18 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
(Arruda v. Curves Int'l, Inc., No. 20-50734 (5th Cir. Jun 28, 2021); Provost v.
First Guar. Bank (2019-07-26)).
The complaint must also allege the existence of an enterprise, which can be
a legal entity or an association-in-fact, and must describe the structure,
purpose, and continuity of the enterprise (Crowe v. Henry, 43 F.3d 198 (5th
Cir. 1995); Bordelon v. Wells Fargo Fin. La., LLC, CIVIL ACTION No.
18-2563 SECTION I (E.D. La. Jul 25, 2018)). The introduction should briefly
outline the nature of the enterprise and the relationship of the defendants to
it.
Analysis
1. Jurisdiction and Venue
The introduction must state the basis for federal subject matter jurisdiction,
typically under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (federal question) and 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c)
(civil RICO). It should also assert that venue is proper in the district where
the enterprise operated or where the alleged racketeering acts occurred
(Clark v. Sheriff's Office Calcasieu Par., DOCKET NO. 2:19-cv-0467 (W.D. La.
Nov 21, 2019)).
2. Parties
The introduction should identify the plaintiff(s) and defendant(s), specifying
their roles in the alleged enterprise. The plaintiff must be a person or entity
capable of holding a legal or beneficial interest in property, and the
defendants must be alleged to have participated in the conduct of the
enterprise’s affairs (D&T Partners LLC v. Baymark Partners LP
(2022-05-09)).
3. Statutory Basis and Core Elements
The introduction must cite the relevant RICO provisions (usually 18 U.S.C. §
1962(c) and/or (d)), and assert that the complaint is brought under 18 U.S.C.
§ 1964(c), which provides a private right of action for treble damages and
attorney’s fees to any person injured in their business or property by reason
of a RICO violation (Oblio Telecom, Inc. v. Patel, 711 F.Supp.2d 668 (N.D.
Tex. 2008); Heden v. Hill, 937 F.Supp. 1230 (S.D. Tex. 1996)).
The introduction should then succinctly allege:
The existence of an enterprise (legal entity or association-in-fact)
engaged in or affecting interstate commerce.
The defendant’s employment by or association with the enterprise.
The defendant’s participation, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of
the enterprise’s affairs.
The defendant’s participation through a pattern of racketeering activity
(at least two related predicate acts within ten years).

The injury to the plaintiff’s business or property, proximately caused by
the RICO violation (RICO: A Primer (2022-01-31); Moore v. Town N.
Auto., Inc., Civil Action No. 3:14-CV-1215-D (N.D. Tex. Jul 11, 2014)).
4. Factual Framing
The introduction should provide a concise overview of the factual context,
including:
The nature of the enterprise (e.g., the Myers-Branthoover group as an
association-in-fact).
The time frame and continuity of the alleged racketeering activity (e.g.,
December 2023 through 2025).
The types of predicate acts alleged (e.g., wire fraud, extortion,
fraudulent court filings).
The relationship among the defendants and their roles in the
enterprise.
The specific harm suffered by the plaintiff (e.g., loss of home, business,
and income).
This factual framing is essential to demonstrate that the complaint is not
based on mere speculation or conclusory allegations, but on specific,
plausible facts that, if proven, would entitle the plaintiff to relief (Williams v.
Am. Commercial Lines, Civil Action 20-139-SDD-EWD (M.D. La. Jul 29,
2021); Samsung Elecs. Am., Inc. v. Yang Kun Chung, Civil Action No. 3:15-
CV-4108-D (N.D. Tex. Feb 16, 2017)).
5. Pleading Standards
The introduction must comply with Rule 8(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure, requiring a short and plain statement of the claim showing
entitlement to relief, and with Rule 9(b) for fraud-based predicate acts,
requiring particularity as to the circumstances of the fraud (Holliday v.
Goodell, Civil Action 25-264 (E.D. La. Mar 06, 2025); Mitchell Energy Corp.
v. Martin, 616 F.Supp. 924 (S.D. Tex. 1985)). This means the introduction
should preview, but not fully detail, the specific facts that will be set out in
the body of the complaint.
6. Pattern and Continuity
The introduction should allege that the predicate acts are related and
amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity, satisfying the
“pattern” requirement (Burrell v. Concept AG, LLC, CIVIL ACTION NO. 4:19-
cv-00124-NBB-JMV (N.D. Miss. Sep 30, 2020); Express Working Capital, LLC
v. One World Cuisine Grp., LLC, Civil Action No.: 3:15-CV-3792-S (N.D. Tex.
Aug 16, 2018)). The introduction should make clear that the alleged conduct
is not an isolated incident, but part of an ongoing scheme.

=== PAGE 20 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
7. Causation and Injury
The introduction must allege that the plaintiff suffered injury to business or
property, and that this injury was proximately caused by the defendant’s
RICO violation (Racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations.
(2009-03-22); Clark v. Sheriff's Office Calcasieu Par., DOCKET NO. 2:19-
cv-0467 (W.D. La. Nov 21, 2019)). The introduction should briefly describe
the nature of the injury and its connection to the alleged racketeering
activity.
8. Conspiracy (if applicable)
If the complaint alleges a RICO conspiracy under § 1962(d), the introduction
should state that the defendants agreed to participate in the conduct of the
enterprise’s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity, and briefly
describe the nature of the agreement and the overt acts in furtherance
(Gabriel v. Outlaw, CASE NO. 3:20-CV-60-E-BK (N.D. Tex. Mar 01, 2021); 
U.S. v. Martino, 648 F.2d 367 (5th Cir. 1981)—noting that Martino was later
vacated, but its articulation of conspiracy elements remains instructive).
Exceptions and Caveats
The introduction must avoid conclusory statements and must be
supported by specific factual allegations; threadbare recitals of the
elements are insufficient (Arruda v. Curves Int'l, Inc., No. 20-50734 (5th
Cir. Jun 28, 2021)).
For fraud-based predicate acts, failure to plead with particularity under
Rule 9(b) is grounds for dismissal (Peel v. cPaperless LLC, 4:23-
CV-02417 (S.D. Tex. Nov 08, 2024)).
The introduction should not attempt to prove the case, but must
provide enough detail to make the claim plausible and to put
defendants on notice of the nature of the claims against them (McCoy v.
McCormick, Civil Action 22-443-BAJ-RLB (M.D. La. Feb 15, 2023)).
Conclusion
In summary, the introduction section of a civil RICO complaint in the Fifth
Circuit must clearly and concisely allege the existence of an enterprise, a
pattern of racketeering activity, the defendant’s participation in the
enterprise’s affairs through that pattern, and a causal link to injury in the
plaintiff’s business or property. It must establish federal jurisdiction, cite the
statutory basis for the claim, and provide a factual overview that supports
each element, all while complying with the heightened pleading standards
for fraud-based claims. Properly framing the case in this manner is essential
to survive a motion to dismiss and to ensure that the complaint is taken
seriously by the court and the defendants.

U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
A plaintiff asserting a RICO claim must allege the existence of an enterprise.
Montesano v. Seafirst Commercial Corp., 818 F.2d 423, 427 (5th Cir.1987). A
RICO enterprise can be either a legal entity or an association-in-fact. Manax
v. McNamara, 842 F.2d 808, 811 (5th Cir.1988).
Summary
In the Fifth Circuit, a civil RICO complaint must include allegations of the
existence of an enterprise. This enterprise can be a legal entity or an
association-in-fact. The introduction section of a RICO complaint should
therefore clearly articulate the nature of the enterprise involved, whether it
is a formal legal entity or an informal association-in-fact, to properly frame
the case.

U.S. District Court — Northern District of Texas
Extract
RICO makes it unlawful 'for any person employed by or associated with any
enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign
commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of
such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.' 18 U.S.C.
§ 1962(c). 'Reduced to their simplest terms, the essential elements of a RICO
claim are: (1) a person who engages in (2) a pattern of racketeering activity
(3) connected to the acquisition, establishment, conduct, or control of an
enterprise.'
Summary
The introduction section of a civil RICO complaint in the Fifth Circuit should
clearly outline the essential elements of a RICO claim. These elements
include: (1) identifying a person or entity who engages in the conduct, (2)
establishing a pattern of racketeering activity, and (3) demonstrating a
connection to the acquisition, establishment, conduct, or control of an
enterprise. This framework is crucial for properly framing the case and
ensuring that the complaint meets the legal requirements for a RICO claim.

I (E.D. La. Jul 25, 2018)

=== PAGE 22 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
U.S. District Court — Eastern District of Louisiana
Extract
RICO does not require tha[t] an enterprise be a separate business-like entity.
Instead, an association-in-fact enterprise includes 'a group of persons
associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a course of
conduct,' and that enterprise can be proved with 'evidence of an ongoing
organization, formal or informal, and by evidence that the various associates
function as a continuing unit.' As the Fifth Circuit has explained, 'The
linchpin of enterprise status is the continuity or ongoing nature of the
association.' The enterprise must have continuity of its structure and
personnel, which links the defendants, and a common or shared purpose.
Summary
The passage provides insight into the requirements for establishing an
enterprise under RICO in the Fifth Circuit. It emphasizes that an enterprise
does not need to be a formal business entity but can be an association-in-
fact, which requires evidence of a common purpose, ongoing organization,
and continuity. This is crucial for framing a RICO case, as the introduction
should establish the existence of such an enterprise and its continuity to
meet the legal standards.

U.S. District Court — Northern District of Texas
Extract
To recover for a violation of § 1962(a), a plaintiff must also plead injuries to
its business or property. See 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c). The plaintiff's injuries must
have... It is not enough, however, that the alleged predicate acts occurred.
For a series of related predicate acts to constitute a RICO 'pattern of
activity,' a plaintiff must also allege that the acts 'amount to or threaten
continuing racketeering activity.' Burzynski, 989 F.2d at 742 (emphasis in
original). 'It is 'continuity' that assures a federal cause of action.' Id.
Continuity may be alleged as 'either a closed period of repeated conduct, or
an open-ended period of conduct that 'by its nature projects into the future
with a threat of repetition.'' Word of Faith World Outreach Ctr. Church, Inc.
v. Sawyer, 90 F.3d 118, 122 (5th Cir. 1996) (quoting H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at
241).
Summary
In the Fifth Circuit, a civil RICO complaint must include allegations of
injuries to business or property as a result of the defendant's actions.
Additionally, the complaint must establish a pattern of racketeering activity,

=== PAGE 23 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
which requires more than just the occurrence of predicate acts. The plaintiff
must demonstrate continuity, which can be shown through either a closed
period of repeated conduct or an open-ended period that suggests a threat
of future repetition. This ensures that the RICO claim is grounded in
ongoing or future criminal activity, rather than isolated incidents.
U.S. v. Welch, 656 F.2d 1039 (5th Cir. 1981)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
Finally, Welch contends that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient
to sustain a conviction on Count V the substantive RICO offense. This Court
has recently stated that five elements comprise a substantive RICO charge:
The government must prove (1) the existence of the enterprise; (2) that the
enterprise affected interstate commerce; (3) that the defendant was
employed by or associated with the enterprise; (4) that he participated in
the conduct of the affairs of the enterprise; and (5) that he participated
through a pattern of racketeering activity.
Summary
Essential elements that must be proven in a substantive RICO charge, which
are critical to framing a civil RICO complaint. These elements include the
existence of an enterprise, its effect on interstate commerce, the defendant's
association with the enterprise, participation in its affairs, and participation
through a pattern of racketeering activity. These elements are foundational
to any RICO claim and should be included in the introduction section to
properly frame the case.
U.S. v. Martino, 648 F.2d 367 (5th Cir. 1981)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
A RICO substantive charge requires proof of the existence of an enterprise
which affects interstate commerce and that the defendant participated in
the conduct of the enterprise's affairs by committing at least two of the
designated acts of racketeering activity. A RICO conspiracy charge requires
the additional element of agreement; the defendant must have 'objectively
manifested an agreement to participate, directly or indirectly, in the affairs
of an enterprise through the commission of two or more predicate crimes.'
Elliott, 571 F.2d at 903 (emphasis in original). The Elliott court also stated
that the agreement involved in a RICO conspiracy must include the vital
element of agreeing to commit the predicate acts. Upon proof of the

=== PAGE 24 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
commission of racketeering activity, 'the inference of an agreement to do so
is unmistakable.' Id.
Summary
Essential elements required for a RICO charge in the Fifth Circuit. For a
substantive RICO charge, it is necessary to prove the existence of an
enterprise affecting interstate commerce, and that the defendant
participated in the enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering
activity. For a RICO conspiracy charge, there must be an agreement to
participate in the enterprise's affairs through the commission of predicate
acts. These elements are crucial for framing a RICO case in the introduction
section of a complaint.
U.S. v. Cauble, 706 F.2d 1322 (5th Cir. 1983)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
RICO criminalizes the conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of
racketeering activity and not merely the defendant's engaging in
racketeering activity. Therefore, there must be a nexus between the
enterprise, the defendant, and the pattern of racketeering activity. The mere
fact that a defendant works for a legitimate enterprise and commits
racketeering acts while on the business premises does not establish that the
affairs of the enterprise have been conducted 'through' a pattern of
racketeering activity. Similarly, a defendant's mere association with a lawful
enterprise whose affairs are conducted through a pattern of racketeering
activity in which he is not personally engaged does not establish his guilt
under RICO.
Summary
The passage emphasizes the importance of establishing a nexus between the
enterprise, the defendant, and the pattern of racketeering activity in a RICO
case. It clarifies that merely working for or associating with a legitimate
enterprise is insufficient to establish RICO liability unless the defendant's
actions are connected to the enterprise's conduct through a pattern of
racketeering activity. This highlights the need for a clear connection
between the defendant's actions and the enterprise's affairs in the
introduction of a RICO complaint.

Rule 8 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires a pleading to contain
'a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled
to relief.' FED. R. CIV. P. 8(a)(2). Under Rule 8, the complaint must allege
'sufficient facts from which the court can determine the existence of subject
matter jurisdiction and from which the defendants can fairly appreciate the
claim made against them.' Bynum v. Terrebonne Parish Consol. Gov't, 2011
WL 6654985, at *3 (E.D. La. Nov. 8, 2011) (citations omitted). Plaintiff
alleges a claim pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 1962, under the Racketeer Influenced
and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). '[A]ny person injured in his business
or property by reason of a violation of section 1962' can sue for treble
damages and fees.' Welborn v. Bank of New York Mellon Corp, 557 Fed.
Appx. 383, 2014 U.S. App. LEXIS 4152, 2014 WL 843262, at *1 (5th Cir. Mar.
5, 2014) (citing 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c)'. '[A] claim requires three elements: (1) a
RICO violation under 18 U.S.C. § 1962; (2) an injury to any person's business
or property; and (3) the injury must be 'by reason of' the alleged RICO
violation.' Id. Under 18 U.S.C. § 1961 et seq., in order to state a valid claim
under RICO, the plaintiff must allege four things: (1) conduct, (2) by an
enterprise, (3) through a pattern, (4) of racketeering activity. See 18 U.S.C.
1961 et seq. First, in order to constitute sufficient 'conduct,' the Act has set
out various 'predicate offenses,' at least one of which must be alleged in
order to invoke jurisdiction under RICO. Interstate Flagging, Inc. v. Town of
Darien, 283 F.Supp.2d 641, 645 (D.Conn. 2003). A RICO claim must also
allege a 'pattern' of racketeering activity, consisting of at least two
racketeering acts. Heller Fin. Inc. v. Gramco Computer Sales, 71 F.3d 518,
523 (5th Cir. 1996). Finally, a plaintiff must specifically allege some sort of
agreement to commit predicate racketeering acts. Crowe, 43 F.3d at 206.
Summary
Requirements for a civil RICO complaint under Rule 8 of the Federal Rules
of Civil Procedure, which mandates a short and plain statement of the claim.
It specifies that the complaint must allege sufficient facts to establish
subject matter jurisdiction and allow defendants to understand the claims
against them. For a RICO claim, the complaint must include a RICO
violation, an injury to business or property, and a causal link between the
injury and the RICO violation. Additionally, it must allege conduct by an
enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity, including at least two
predicate acts and an agreement to commit these acts.

A RICO claim has three elements: '1) a person engages in, 2) a pattern of
racketeering activity, 3) connected to the acquisition, establishment,
conduct, or control of an enterprise.' St. Germain v. Howard, 556 F.3d 261,

263 (5th Cir. 2009) (citation omitted). A pattern of racketeering activity
consists of two or more predicate criminal acts, federal or state, 'that are 1)
related and 2) amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity.' Id.
A RICO conspiracy claim requires one additional element — there must be
an agreement between the conspirators to specifically commit the alleged
predicate acts. Snow Ingredients, Inc. v. SnoWizard, Inc., 833 F.3d 512, 526
(5th Cir. 2016). Civil RICO liability does not exist unless the pleadings allege
actual criminal activity. Id.
Summary
Essential elements required for a RICO claim in the Fifth Circuit, which
include engaging in a pattern of racketeering activity connected to an
enterprise. It also specifies that a RICO conspiracy claim requires an
agreement to commit the predicate acts. This information is crucial for
framing the introduction of a civil RICO complaint, as it sets the foundation
for the allegations and legal arguments.

The complaint must provide the grounds entitling the Plaintiffs to relief,
'requir[ing] more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of
the elements of a cause of action will not do.' Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550
U.S. 544, 555 (2007). It must state a plausible claim for relief — one that
may be inferred from the complaint's factual allegations. Ashcroft v. Iqbal,
556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). Because Plaintiffs here rely on fraud as the
predicate act for RICO, their complaint is subject to the heightened pleading
standard of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b), requiring a plaintiff to
'state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud.'
Summary
A civil RICO complaint in the Fifth Circuit must provide more than mere
labels and conclusions. It must state a plausible claim for relief that can be
inferred from the factual allegations. When fraud is the predicate act, the
complaint is subject to the heightened pleading standard of Federal Rule of
Civil Procedure 9(b), which requires stating with particularity the
circumstances constituting fraud.

Extract
Generally, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure require in a Complaint only a
'short and plain statement' of the cause of action relied upon by Plaintiff
Fed.R. Civ.P. 8(a). However, under Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b), 'in all averments of
fraud or mistake, the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake shall be
stated with particularity.' The relationship between the two rules is
'complimentary.... The rules must be read in that fashion, avoiding an
exclusive focusing on the requirements of one or the other.'
Summary
The passage highlights the need for a civil RICO complaint to include a
"short and plain statement" of the cause of action as per Rule 8(a), while
also requiring that any allegations of fraud be stated with particularity
under Rule 9(b). This means that the introduction section of a RICO
complaint should clearly outline the basis of the claim and provide specific
details about the fraudulent acts alleged.

Summary
Clear outline of the essential elements required for a RICO claim, which are
crucial for framing the introduction section of a civil RICO complaint. These
elements include the involvement of a person in a pattern of racketeering

To state a viable RICO claim under any theory, plaintiffs must allege the
following elements: '(1) a person who engages in (2) a pattern of
racketeering activity, (3) connected to the acquisition, establishment,
conduct, or control of an enterprise.' St. Germain v. Howard, 556 F.3d 261,

must identify predicate acts with 'continuity plus relationship.' H.J., Inc. v.
Northwest Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 239 (1989).
Summary
To properly frame a civil RICO complaint in the Fifth Circuit, the
introduction section should include allegations that a person engaged in a
pattern of racketeering activity connected to the acquisition, establishment,
conduct, or control of an enterprise. The complaint must focus on the
pattern of racketeering, which requires identifying predicate acts with
continuity and relationship.
Oblio Telecom, Inc. v. Patel, 711 F.Supp.2d 668 (N.D. Tex. 2008)
U.S. District Court — Northern District of Texas
Extract
RICO provides a civil cause of action to recover treble damages for '[a]ny
person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section
1962.' 18 U.S.C. § 1964. Oblio contends that Defendants violated subsections
(a) through (d) of section 1962. Reduced to their simplest terms, these
subsections mean: Crowe v. Henry, 43 F.3d 198, 203 (5th Cir.1995).
'Common elements are present in all four of these subsections. These
common elements teach that any RICO claim necessitates 1) a person who
engages in 2) a pattern of racketeering activity, 3) connected to the
acquisition, establishment, conduct, or control of an enterprise.' Id. at 204
(original emphasis) (internal citations and quotations omitted).
Summary
Essential elements required for a RICO claim, which are crucial for framing
the introduction of a civil RICO complaint. These elements include the
existence of a person engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity
connected to an enterprise. This foundational understanding is necessary to
properly frame the case in the introduction section of a RICO complaint.

U.S. District Court — Eastern District of Louisiana
Extract
Rule 8(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires a Complaint set
forth 'sufficient facts from which the court can determine the existence of
subject matter jurisdiction and from which the defendants can fairly
appreciate the claim made against them.' While Rule 8's pleading standard
does not require 'detailed factual allegations,' it does demand more than an
'unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation.' Moreover,
when a plaintiff alleges fraud, Rule 9 requires that the fraud claim be
pleaded with particularity. 'At a minimum, Rule 9(b) requires allegations of
the particulars of ‘time, place, and contents of the false representations, as
well as the identity of the person making the misrepresentation and what he
obtained thereby.'
Summary
Requirements under Rule 8(a) and Rule 9(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure, which are essential for framing a civil RICO complaint. Rule 8(a)
requires sufficient facts to establish subject matter jurisdiction and to inform
defendants of the claims against them. Rule 9(b) requires that fraud claims
be pleaded with particularity, specifying the time, place, and contents of
false representations, the identity of the person making them, and what was
obtained as a result. These requirements are crucial for the introduction
section of a civil RICO complaint to ensure that the complaint is not
dismissed for lack of specificity or failure to state a claim.

Extract
Further, Plaintiff was advised that he must state specific facts to support the
elements of a RICO violation and to explain how Defendants' conduct caused
his injuries. [] Nonetheless, because it was 'not possible to tell…if Plaintiff
could adequately allege a RICO claim,' it was recommended that Plaintiff be
given an 'opportunity to amend his Complaint to state that claim, if
possible.' ... In his Amended Complaint, Plaintiff still vaguely references that
Defendants engaged in conduct that rises to the level of a substantive RICO
violation, and that this conduct caused him injuries. [] It was explained to
Plaintiff that it is not sufficient to simply state the elements of a cause of
action. [] Despite this, Plaintiff's Amended Complaint contain those same
vague-and repetitious-references that Defendants engaged in conduct that
rises to the level of a substantive RICO violation, and that this unspecified
conduct injured Plaintiff's 'business or property.'

=== PAGE 30 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
A civil RICO complaint must include specific facts supporting the elements
of a RICO violation and explain how the defendants' conduct caused the
plaintiff's injuries. It is not enough to merely state the elements of a cause of
action; the complaint must articulate specific facts that support the claim.
This guidance is applicable to civil RICO complaints in the Fifth Circuit, as it
addresses the requirements for adequately stating a RICO claim.
Heden v. Hill, 937 F.Supp. 1230 (S.D. Tex. 1996)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of Texas
Extract
In 1970, Congress enacted RICO as Title IX of the Organized Crime Control
Act to combat organized crime through both criminal prosecutions and
private actions. See 18 U.S.C. § 1961 et seq. The 'legislative history
forcefully supports the view that the major purpose of Title IX is to address
the infiltration of legitimate business by organized crime.' United States v.
Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 591, 101 S.Ct. 2524, 2532, 69 L.Ed.2d 246 (1981). A
private right of action is provided under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c), which states in
pertinent part: 'Any person injured in his business or property by reason of a
violation of section 1962 of this chapter may sue therefor in any appropriate
United States district court and shall recover threefold the damages he
sustains and the cost of the suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee.'
Summary
The introduction section of a civil RICO complaint in the Fifth Circuit should
frame the case by referencing the legislative intent of RICO, which is to
combat organized crime and its infiltration into legitimate businesses. It
should also cite the statutory basis for a private right of action under 18
U.S.C. § 1964(c), which allows individuals injured in their business or
property by a RICO violation to seek treble damages and attorney's fees.
This foundational understanding helps set the stage for the specific
allegations and claims that follow in the complaint.

In order to plead a pattern of racketeering activity, a RICO claimant must
show two components: (1) predicate acts, the requisite predicate activity,
and (2) a pattern of such acts. In re Burzynski, 989 F.2d 733, 742 (5th Cir.
1993). The RICO statute proscribes various categories of predicate acts that

=== PAGE 31 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
may constitute racketeering activity. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1). The first category
lists certain generically enumerated offenses that are 'chargeable under
State law and punishable by imprisonment for more than one year' and
which involve 'murder, kidnapping, gambling, arson, robbery, bribery,
extortion, dealing in matter, or dealing in a controlled substance or listed
chemical,' 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1)(A). A violation of the Hobbs Act is a predicate
act as well.
Summary
Requirement for a RICO claimant to demonstrate predicate acts and a
pattern of such acts, which are essential elements in framing a RICO case.
This is relevant to the introduction section of a civil RICO complaint as it
sets the stage for the allegations and legal basis of the claim.

The Fifth Circuit has stated that '[t]he RICO person must be one that either
poses or has posed a continuous threat of engaging in acts of racketeering,'
and this 'requirement may not be satisfied if no more is pled than that the
person has engaged in a limited number of predicate racketeering acts.'
Crowe, 43 F.3d at 204 (quoting Delta Truck & Tractor, Inc. v. J.I. Case Co.,
855 F.2d 241, 243 (5th Cir. 1988), cert. denied, 489 U.S. 1079 (1989)).
Summary
The passage highlights a critical requirement for a RICO claim in the Fifth
Circuit: the defendant must pose a continuous threat of engaging in
racketeering activities. This requirement is not met if the complaint only
alleges a limited number of predicate acts. This indicates that the
introduction of a RICO complaint should establish the defendant as a
continuous threat, which is a foundational element of the claim.
Peel v. cPaperless LLC, 4:23-CV-02417 (S.D. Tex. Nov 08, 2024)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of Texas
Extract
Defendants ask the Court to dismiss Plaintiffs' RICO claim, after which the
Court would lack subject matter jurisdiction over any remaining state law
claims. Defendants argue that Plaintiffs fail to adequately plead any RICO
predicate acts or the requisite pattern of racketeering activity. Plaintiffs
oppose dismissal of the RICO claim but fail to directly respond to many of
Defendants' arguments. Plaintiffs otherwise agree that without their RICO
claim the Court lacks jurisdiction over the remaining claims. Although
Defendants would prefer to allow Plaintiffs a chance to replead diversity
jurisdiction and keep this litigation in federal court, Plaintiffs are less
enthusiastic about that prospect. The Court addresses each of these issues
below. ... Accordingly, despite multiple opportunities to amend and a clear
checklist of what must be included to state a RICO claim, Order, ECF No. 44
at 13-14, Plaintiffs still fail to plead a single predicate act with the requisite
particularity per Rule 9(b). Because a civil RICO claim requires at least two
predicate acts to establish a 'pattern of racketeering activity,' 18 U.S.C. §
1961(5), Plaintiffs fail to state a RICO claim. The Court may dismiss
Plaintiffs' civil RICO claim on this basis alone. However, because the Court
specifically requested briefing on RICO's 'continuity' element, see Order,
ECF No. 54 at 1-2, the Court also discusses those arguments below.
Summary
A civil RICO complaint in the Fifth Circuit must include at least two
predicate acts with particularity as per Rule 9(b) to establish a "pattern of
racketeering activity." The introduction should frame the case by clearly

outlining these predicate acts and demonstrating the continuity of the
alleged racketeering activity. The passage also highlights the importance of

Summary
The passage highlights the central aim of RICO, which is to prohibit patterns
of crimes conducted through an enterprise. This is relevant to framing a civil
RICO complaint, as it underscores the need to establish a pattern of
racketeering activity and the existence of an enterprise. The introduction
section of a RICO complaint should therefore clearly articulate these
elements, setting the stage for the detailed allegations that follow.
D&T Partners LLC v. Baymark Partners LP
Extract
D&T brings three RICO claims for violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(a), (c), and
(d). Doc. 36, Am. Compl., ¶¶ 310-67. The claims under subsections (c) and
(d) are against all Defendants, while the claim under subsection (a) is
against Baymark, Ludlow, Hook, Denegre, Super G, SG Credit, BP
Management, Smith, and Hallett & Perrin. See id. Because there are
common elements in each subsection, Crowe v. Henry, 43 F.3d 198, 204 (5th
Cir. 1995), the Court will analyze the RICO claims together. All four
subsections of § 1962 have three common elements: “1) a person who
engages in 2) a pattern of racketeering activity, 3) connected to the
acquisition, establishment, conduct, or control of an enterprise.” Crowe, 43
F.3d at 204 (emphasis omitted). The statute broadly defines “person” to
include “any individual or entity capable of holding a legal or beneficial
interest in property.” 18 U.S.C. § 1961(3); Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S.
938, 944 (2009) (“The term ‘any’ ensures that the definition has a wide
reach ....”). “To establish th[e] pattern [element], a plaintiff must show both
a relationship between the predicate offenses. .. and the threat of continuing
activity.” Malvino v. Delluniversita, 840 F.3d 223, 231 (5th Cir. 2016). “[A]n
enterprise. .. ‘is proved by evidence of an ongoing organization, formal or
informal, and by evidence that the various associates function as a
continuing unit.’” Boyle, 556 U.S. at 945 (quoting United States v. Turkette,
452 U.S. 576, 583 (1981)).
Summary
Legal requirements for a civil RICO complaint in the Fifth Circuit,
specifically under 18 U.S.C. § 1962. It identifies the three common elements
necessary for a RICO claim: a person engaging in a pattern of racketeering
activity connected to an enterprise. It also explains that the pattern element
requires a relationship between predicate offenses and a threat of
continuing activity. The enterprise element is proved by evidence of an
ongoing organization where associates function as a continuing unit.

To state a civil RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962, a plaintiff must allege
three common elements: “(1) a person who engages in (2) a pattern of
racketeering activity, (3) connected to the acquisition, establishment,
conduct, or control of an enterprise.” N. Cypress Med. Ctr. Operating Co.,
Ltd. v. Cigna Healthcare, 781 F.3d 182, 201 (5th Cir. 2015) (quotation

“predicate act,” is defined to include certain criminal acts, including mail
and wire fraud, and any act indictable under the Immigration and
Nationality Act. See 18 U.S.C § 1961 (defining “racketeering activity”);
Waste Mgmt. of La., L.L.C. v. River Birch, Inc., 920 F.3d 958, 964 (5th Cir.

Summary
Essential elements required to state a civil RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. §
1962, which are applicable in the Fifth Circuit. These elements include the
engagement in a pattern of racketeering activity connected to an enterprise.
The passage also defines what constitutes "racketeering activity" or
"predicate acts," which are crucial for framing a RICO case.

Ltd., 378 F.3d 433, 437 (5th Cir. 2004)). However, the foregoing tenet is
inapplicable to legal conclusions. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 1949

by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice. Id. (citing Bell Atlantic Corp.

Summary
The passage provides insight into the legal requirements for a civil
complaint in the Fifth Circuit, emphasizing that factual allegations must be
accepted as true and that the complaint must state a plausible claim for
relief. This is relevant to the introduction section of a RICO complaint, as it
must set the stage for the factual allegations that will support the RICO
claims.

Extract
RICO's standing provision provides that '[a]ny person injured in his business
or property by reason of a violation of [sections] 1962 of this chapter' may
bring a civil action under RICO. The circuits are split on the specific
standing requirements for a civil action under [sections] 1962(a). To allege a
violation of [sections] 1962(a), a plaintiff must show that someone had (1)
received income from a pattern of racketeering activity; and (2) used or
invested this income in a RICO enterprise. In addition, the Supreme Court
held that a plaintiff must prove the defendant's violation was the proximate
cause of the plaintiff's injury in order to have standing under civil RICO.
Summary
For a civil RICO complaint, particularly in the Fifth Circuit, the introduction
should establish standing by demonstrating that the plaintiff was injured in
their business or property due to a violation of section 1962. The plaintiff
must show that the injury was proximately caused by the defendant's
violation, which involved receiving income from a pattern of racketeering
activity and using or investing this income in a RICO enterprise. This
foundational information is crucial for framing the case and establishing the
court's jurisdiction.

Moreover, a plaintiff must prove that the defendant's violation of [section]
1962 was the proximate cause of the plaintiff's injury to have standing for a
civil RICO action. In creating this proximate cause requirement, the Court
reasoned that Congress modeled [section] 1964(c) on the civil action
provisions in the Clayton Act, which federal courts have long held to require
a showing of proximate causation. In addition, civil RICO is not available to
compensate the economic consequences of personal injuries sustained as a
result of a RICO predicate act.

The passage highlights the necessity for a plaintiff to demonstrate that the
defendant's violation of section 1962 was the proximate cause of the
plaintiff's injury. This requirement is crucial for establishing standing in a

To properly frame a civil RICO complaint, particularly under section 1962(c),
the introduction should establish that the plaintiff has suffered an injury to
business or property due to a predicate act of racketeering. Additionally, it
must be shown that the defendant's actions were the proximate cause of this
injury. This aligns with the requirements modeled after the Clayton Act,
emphasizing the need for proximate causation. The introduction should also
clarify that the claim is not for personal injuries but for economic harm to
business or property.

Extract
Moreover, a plaintiff must prove that the defendant's violation of [section]
1962 was the proximate cause of the plaintiff's injury to have standing for a
civil RICO action. (315) In creating this proximate cause requirement, the
Court reasoned that... At least one commentator believes it is possible for a
RICO action to be successfully litigated in the area of divorce if it meets the
following criteria: (i) the plaintiff must show an injury to business or
property because of the divorce proceedings; (ii) the plaintiff must show that
the defendant acted as part of an enterprise to further the act of hiding
assets to minimize divorce settlements; and (iii) there must be either
multiple violations of the same predicate act, or the commission of more
than one predicate act. (360)
Summary
The passage provides insight into the requirements for a civil RICO action,
emphasizing the need to demonstrate proximate cause between the
defendant's violation and the plaintiff's injury. It also outlines specific
criteria for applying RICO in divorce cases, which can be relevant to framing
a RICO complaint in such contexts.

Extract
A RICO-based complaint must be drafted with the following instructions
from Sedima as a guide. A violation of § 1962(c), the section on which
Sedima relies, requires (1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern
(4) of racketeering activity. The plaintiff must allege each of the elements to
state a claim. They are all equally essential components, and the complaint
will fail if any one of them is not adequately pleaded. In particular, RICO
claims based on mail or wire fraud must comport with Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 9(b)’s requirement that allegations involving fraud be pleaded
with particularity. The practitioner through their pleadings must articulate
with great care and attention a viable racketeering conspiracy. The court
must read the facts alleged in the complaint in the light most favorable to
the plaintiff.
Summary
A civil RICO complaint must include specific elements to be valid. These
elements are conduct, an enterprise, a pattern, and racketeering activity.
Each element must be adequately pleaded, and for claims involving fraud,
the allegations must meet the particularity requirements of Federal Rule of
Civil Procedure 9(b). The introduction section of a RICO complaint should
frame the case by clearly outlining these elements and ensuring that the
facts are presented in a manner that supports the plaintiff's claims.
RICO: A Primer
Extract
To prove a violation of Section 1962(c), a plaintiff must prove the following
elements: * Existence of an enterprise; * The enterprise engaged in, or its
activities affected, interstate or foreign commerce; * The defendant was
employed by or was associated with the enterprise; * The defendant
conducted or participated, either directly or indirectly, in the conduct of the
affairs of the enterprise; and * The defendant participated in the affairs of
the enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of
unlawful debt.
Summary
To properly frame a civil RICO complaint, particularly under Section
1962(c), the introduction should include allegations that establish the
existence of an enterprise, its engagement in or effect on interstate
commerce, the defendant's association with the enterprise, and the
defendant's participation in the enterprise's affairs through a pattern of
racketeering activity. These elements are essential to set the stage for a
RICO claim and provide the necessary legal framework for the complaint.
