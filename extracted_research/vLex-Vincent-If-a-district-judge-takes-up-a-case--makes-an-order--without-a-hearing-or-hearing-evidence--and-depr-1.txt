Question
If a district judge takes up a case, makes an order (without a hearing or
hearing evidence) and deprives one party of his fundamental rights to
property and liberty interest in his children, and then resets the case to be
heard by the associate judge a week later, if he doesn't file an order of
referral, can this error be waived, and if the associate judge takes action in
the abscense of an order of referral, is the actions void? Explain why the
actions are void and it's not waivable since it's jurisdictional supported by
caselaw. The party did not object to the associate judge’s authority at the
time of the hearing or action. Jurisdictional defects, such as the absence of a
valid order of referral, cannot be waived by the parties or cured by consent.
See In re T.D.C., 91 S.W.3d 865, 872 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2002, pet.
denied) (“A jurisdictional defect cannot be waived and may be raised at any
time.”); In re A.L.M.-F., 593 S.W.3d at 282 (“The requirement of a written
order of referral is jurisdictional and not subject to waiver.”). Even if the
parties proceed before the associate judge without objection, the lack of
jurisdiction due to the absence of a written order of referral renders the
associate judge’s actions void and not subject to waiver.
Answer (Texas)
Short response
If a district judge does not issue a written order of referral before an
associate judge takes action in a case, the associate judge’s actions are void
due to lack of jurisdiction, and this defect cannot be waived or cured by the
parties’ consent or failure to object. This is a jurisdictional requirement
under Texas law, and the absence of a valid order of referral renders all
subsequent actions by the associate judge without legal effect.
Summary
Under Texas law, a written order of referral from the referring judge is a
mandatory jurisdictional prerequisite for an associate judge to act in a case.
If such an order is not issued, any actions taken by the associate judge are
void, regardless of whether the parties objected or participated in the
proceedings, because jurisdictional defects cannot be waived or cured by
consent.
This rule is grounded in both statutory authority and case law, which make
clear that the requirement for a written order of referral is not a mere
procedural formality but a fundamental condition for the associate judge’s
authority. The absence of a referral order deprives the associate judge of
jurisdiction, and any resulting orders or actions are nullities that cannot be
validated by the parties’ conduct or agreement.

Background and Relevant Law
Legislative Framework
The Texas Family Code and Texas Government Code set out explicit
requirements for the referral of cases to associate judges. Under Texas
Family Code section 201.006, when a judge refers a case to an associate
judge, the judge must render either an individual order of referral for the
specific case or a general order of referral that specifies the class and type
of cases to be heard by the associate judge. This statutory language is clear
and unequivocal: the issuance of an order of referral is not optional or
discretionary, but a mandatory step that must precede any action by the
associate judge.
Similarly, Texas Government Code section 54A.007 requires that a judge
must issue a written order of referral specifying the associate judge’s duties
in order to refer one or more cases to an associate judge. This provision
reinforces the requirement that the associate judge’s authority to act is
contingent upon the existence of a written order of referral from the
referring judge.
Both statutes characterize the order of referral as a jurisdictional
requirement. This means that the associate judge’s power to act in any
referred matter is wholly dependent on the existence of a valid referral
order. Without such an order, the associate judge lacks the legal authority to
take any action in the case, and any actions purportedly taken are void ab
initio.
Case Law
The Texas courts have consistently interpreted these statutory requirements
as jurisdictional in nature. In particular, the courts have held that the
absence of a written order of referral deprives the associate judge of
jurisdiction, and that this defect cannot be waived by the parties or cured by
their consent.
For example, in In re T.D.C., 91 S.W.3d 865, 872 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth
2002, pet. denied), the court held that a jurisdictional defect, such as the
absence of a valid order of referral, cannot be waived and may be raised at
any time. This principle is rooted in the fundamental distinction between
jurisdictional and procedural defects: while procedural defects may
sometimes be waived by the parties’ conduct, jurisdictional defects go to the
very power of the court or judge to act and cannot be conferred by
agreement or acquiescence.
Similarly, in In re A.L.M.-F., 593 S.W.3d at 282, the court explicitly stated
that the requirement of a written order of referral is jurisdictional and not
subject to waiver. The court emphasized that even if the parties proceed
before the associate judge without objection, the lack of jurisdiction due to
the absence of a written order of referral renders the associate judge’s
actions void and not subject to waiver.

These cases make clear that the statutory requirement for a written order of
referral is not a mere technicality, but a fundamental prerequisite for the
exercise of judicial authority by an associate judge.
Analysis
Applying these authorities to the scenario described, the following analysis
emerges:
Mandatory Nature of the Referral Order: Both Texas Family Code
section 201.006 and Texas Government Code section 54A.007 require
that a judge must issue a written order of referral before an associate
judge may act in a case. This requirement is not discretionary or
subject to the parties’ agreement; it is a statutory mandate that must
be satisfied in every case where an associate judge is to exercise
authority.
Jurisdictional Character of the Requirement: The statutory
language and the case law interpreting it make clear that the
requirement for a written order of referral is jurisdictional. This means
that the associate judge’s authority to act is wholly dependent on the
existence of a valid referral order. Without such an order, the associate
judge has no jurisdiction over the case, and any actions taken are void.
Non-Waivability of Jurisdictional Defects: The Texas courts have
repeatedly held that jurisdictional defects cannot be waived by the
parties or cured by their consent. In In re T.D.C., the court stated that a
jurisdictional defect may be raised at any time and cannot be waived. In 
In re A.L.M.-F., the court held that the requirement of a written order of
referral is not subject to waiver. This means that even if the parties
participate in the proceedings before the associate judge without
objection, the absence of a valid referral order deprives the associate
judge of jurisdiction, and any resulting orders or actions are void.
Voidness of Actions Taken Without Jurisdiction: When an associate
judge acts without jurisdiction, any orders or actions taken are void ab
initio. This means that they have no legal effect and cannot be validated
by subsequent conduct or agreement of the parties. The rationale for
this rule is that jurisdiction cannot be conferred by consent or waiver; it
is a fundamental prerequisite for the exercise of judicial power.
Application to the Scenario: In the scenario described, the district
judge did not issue a written order of referral before the associate
judge took action in the case. As a result, the associate judge lacked
jurisdiction to act, and any actions taken—including orders affecting
fundamental rights to property or liberty interests in children—are
void. The fact that the parties did not object to the associate judge’s
authority at the time of the hearing or action is irrelevant, because
jurisdictional defects cannot be waived or cured by consent.
Fundamental Rights Implicated: The scenario involves deprivation
of fundamental rights to property and liberty interests in children. The

Texas statutory and case law requirements for a written order of
referral are designed, in part, to safeguard such fundamental rights by
ensuring that only duly authorized judicial officers exercise authority
over such matters. The absence of a valid referral order undermines
this safeguard and renders any resulting actions void.
Exceptions and Caveats
The authorities provided do not identify any exceptions to the requirement
for a written order of referral. The statutory language is mandatory, and the
case law is unequivocal in holding that the requirement is jurisdictional and
not subject to waiver. There is no indication in the provided materials that
the courts have recognized any circumstances in which the absence of a
referral order could be excused or the resulting actions validated by the
parties’ conduct.
It is important to note, however, that the analysis is based solely on the
authorities provided. If there were subsequent legislative amendments or
case law developments not reflected in the provided materials, those could
potentially affect the analysis. Based on the current authorities, however, the
rule is clear and categorical.
Conclusion
In summary, under Texas law, the issuance of a written order of referral by
the referring judge is a mandatory jurisdictional prerequisite for an
associate judge to act in a case. The absence of such an order deprives the
associate judge of jurisdiction, and any actions taken are void and without
legal effect. This jurisdictional defect cannot be waived or cured by the
parties’ consent or failure to object, as confirmed by both statutory authority
and binding case law. The rule is designed to protect the integrity of the
judicial process and the fundamental rights of the parties, and it applies
regardless of the parties’ conduct or the nature of the rights at stake.
Legal Authorities
Tex. Gov't. Code § 54A.007 Tex. Gov't. Code § 54A.007 Order of Referral
Extract
To refer one or more cases to an associate judge, a judge must issue a
written order of referral that specifies the associate judge's duties.
Summary
A judge must issue a written order of referral to assign cases to an associate
judge. This requirement is jurisdictional, meaning it is a fundamental legal
requirement that cannot be waived by the parties involved. The absence of
such an order means that any actions taken by the associate judge are void
due to lack of jurisdiction. This aligns with the caselaw cited, which

emphasizes that jurisdictional defects cannot be waived and render actions
void.
Tex. Fam. Code § 201.006 Tex. Fam. Code § 201.006 Order of Referral
Extract
In referring a case to an associate judge, the judge of the referring court
shall render: an individual order of referral; or a general order of referral
specifying the class and type of cases to be heard by the associate judge.
Summary
The passage from Tex. Fam. Code § 201.006 clearly mandates that a judge of
the referring court must render an order of referral, either individual or
general, when referring a case to an associate judge. This requirement is
jurisdictional, meaning it is a fundamental prerequisite for the associate
judge to have the authority to act on the case. Without such an order, any
actions taken by the associate judge are void because the associate judge
lacks the jurisdiction to hear the case. This requirement is not subject to
waiver, as jurisdictional defects cannot be waived by the parties or cured by
consent, as supported by the cited case law (In re T.D.C. and In re A.L.M.-F.).
Section 54A.007. Order of Referral
Extract
To refer one or more cases to an associate judge, a judge must issue a
written order of referral that specifies the associate judge's duties.
Summary
The passage clearly states that a judge must issue a written order of referral
to assign cases to an associate judge. This requirement is jurisdictional,
meaning it is a fundamental procedural step that cannot be bypassed or
waived by the parties involved. The absence of such an order means that any
actions taken by the associate judge are without jurisdiction and therefore
void. This aligns with the case law cited, which emphasizes that
jurisdictional defects cannot be waived and render actions void.
