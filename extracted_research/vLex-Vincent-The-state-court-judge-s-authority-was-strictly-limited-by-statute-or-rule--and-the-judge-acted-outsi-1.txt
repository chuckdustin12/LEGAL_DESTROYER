Question
The state court judge’s authority was strictly limited by statute or rule, and
the judge acted outside those limits (e.g., presiding over a matter without
subject matter jurisdiction or without required party consent). Judicial
immunity is not lost when a judge acts in excess of jurisdiction, but is lost
when a judge acts in the complete absence of all jurisdiction. (Mireles v.
Waco, 502 U.S. 9 (1991); Ballard v. Wall, 413 F.3d 510 (5th Cir. 2005)). If the
judge’s actions were not merely erroneous or in excess of authority, but
were taken when the judge had no jurisdiction whatsoever (e.g., no subject
matter jurisdiction, or acting after recusal or disqualification), then
immunity does not apply. Compelling a fraudulent settlement in a matter
over which the judge had no jurisdiction is an act in the complete absence of
jurisdiction, not merely in excess of authority, and thus is not protected by
judicial immunity.
Answer (Fifth Circuit)
Short response
Judicial immunity is not lost when a judge merely acts in excess of statutory
or procedural authority, but it is lost when a judge acts in the complete
absence of all jurisdiction, such as presiding over a matter without subject
matter jurisdiction or after disqualification. Compelling a fraudulent
settlement in a case over which the judge has no jurisdiction constitutes an
act in the complete absence of jurisdiction and is therefore not protected by
judicial immunity.
Summary
The doctrine of judicial immunity generally shields judges from liability for
actions taken in their judicial capacity, even if those actions are erroneous,
malicious, or exceed their authority. However, this immunity does not apply
when a judge acts in the complete absence of all jurisdiction, such as when a
judge presides over a matter without subject matter jurisdiction or after
being statutorily disqualified or recused.
The distinction between acting in excess of jurisdiction and acting in the
complete absence of jurisdiction is critical. If a judge has some subject
matter jurisdiction, even if the judge exceeds statutory limits or commits
grave procedural errors, immunity remains. But if the judge has no
jurisdiction whatsoever—such as when the court lacks subject matter
jurisdiction or the judge is disqualified by statute—then judicial immunity
does not apply, and the judge may be subject to liability for actions taken,
including compelling a fraudulent settlement.

Background and Relevant Law
Legislative and Regulatory Framework
The concept of subject matter jurisdiction is foundational in Texas law and
more broadly in American jurisprudence. Subject matter jurisdiction refers
to a court’s power to hear a particular type of case. Without it, a court
cannot lawfully decide a case, and its orders are void. Subject matter
jurisdiction cannot be conferred by agreement, cannot be waived, and its
absence can be raised at any time, even by the court itself (Texas Courts
And Subject Matter Jurisdiction (2022-04-22)).
Statutory rules also govern judicial disqualification and recusal. For
example, Texas law requires a judge to disqualify from any proceeding in
which the judge has served as a lawyer in the matter, or where a party is
related to the judge within a certain degree of affinity or consanguinity
(Pretrial motions). If a judge presides over a case despite being statutorily
disqualified, the judge acts without authority.
Case Law
The U.S. Supreme Court and the Fifth Circuit have repeatedly addressed the
scope and limits of judicial immunity. The leading case, Mireles v. Waco, 502
U.S. 9 (1991), establishes that judicial immunity is overcome only in two
circumstances: (1) when a judge acts outside their judicial capacity, and (2)
when a judge acts in the complete absence of all jurisdiction. This standard
is consistently applied in the Fifth Circuit (Ballard v. Wall, 413 F.3d 510 (5th
Cir. 2005); Davis v. Tarrant County, Tex., 565 F.3d 214 (5th Cir. 2009); 
Walker v. McFarland (E.D. Tex. 2023-12-15)).
The Fifth Circuit and district courts within its jurisdiction have further
clarified that judicial immunity is not lost for actions that are merely in
excess of authority or even for actions taken with malice or error (Stump v.
Sparkman, 435 U.S. 349 (1978), as cited in Whiticar v. Ervin-Knott (E.D. La.
2021-10-26); Kemp v. Perkins, No. 08-60883 (5th Cir. 2009-05-07)). The
critical distinction is whether the judge had any subject matter jurisdiction
at all. If the judge had some jurisdiction, immunity applies; if not, immunity
is lost (Ballard v. Wall, 413 F.3d 510 (5th Cir. 2005); Malina v. Gonzales, 994
F.2d 1121 (5th Cir. 1993)).
The Fifth Circuit has also recognized that jurisdiction is to be construed
broadly for purposes of judicial immunity, to protect the independence of the
judiciary (Holloway v. Walker, 765 F.2d 517 (5th Cir. 1985)). However, where
a judge clearly lacks all subject matter jurisdiction—such as a probate judge
trying a criminal case—immunity does not apply (Harper v. Merckle, 638 F.
2d 848 (5th Cir. 1981)).

Analysis
The Distinction Between Excess of Jurisdiction and
Complete Absence of Jurisdiction
The central issue is the difference between a judge acting in excess of
jurisdiction and acting in the complete absence of all jurisdiction. The
authorities make clear that judicial immunity is not lost simply because a
judge exceeds statutory authority, commits procedural errors, or even acts
with malice. For example, if a judge has subject matter jurisdiction over a
type of case but issues an order that is not authorized by statute, the judge
is still protected by immunity (Kemp v. Perkins, No. 08-60883 (5th Cir.
2009-05-07); Walker v. McFarland (E.D. Tex. 2023-12-15)).
However, if a judge presides over a matter for which the court has no
subject matter jurisdiction—such as a criminal court judge hearing a
probate matter, or a judge acting after being statutorily disqualified or
recused—then the judge acts in the complete absence of jurisdiction. In such
cases, judicial immunity does not apply (Ballard v. Wall, 413 F.3d 510 (5th
Cir. 2005); Malina v. Gonzales, 994 F.2d 1121 (5th Cir. 1993); Harper v.
Merckle, 638 F.2d 848 (5th Cir. 1981)).
The Fifth Circuit has repeatedly emphasized that the existence of some
subject matter jurisdiction is sufficient for immunity, even if the judge’s
actions are in excess of authority (Adams v. McIlhany, 764 F.2d 294 (5th Cir.
1985)). But where there is no jurisdiction at all, immunity is lost.
Application to Compelling a Fraudulent Settlement
Without Jurisdiction
If a judge compels a fraudulent settlement in a matter over which the court
has no subject matter jurisdiction, or after the judge has been disqualified or
recused, this is not merely an act in excess of authority. It is an act in the
complete absence of jurisdiction. The authorities are clear that in such
circumstances, judicial immunity does not apply (Ballard v. Wall, 413 F.3d
510 (5th Cir. 2005); Leone v. Magistrate Judges of Travis Cnty. Circuit Court
(W.D. Tex. 2018-08-08)).
For example, Texas law provides that subject matter jurisdiction cannot be
conferred by agreement and cannot be waived (Texas Courts And Subject
Matter Jurisdiction (2022-04-22)). If a judge presides over a case without
subject matter jurisdiction, any orders or actions taken—including
compelling a settlement—are void and outside the protection of judicial
immunity.
Similarly, if a judge is statutorily disqualified (for example, due to a familial
relationship with a party or prior involvement as counsel) and nevertheless
presides over the case, the judge acts without jurisdiction (Pretrial motions).
Actions taken in such circumstances, including compelling a settlement, are
not protected by judicial immunity.

Judicial Immunity and Malicious or Fraudulent Acts
The authorities also make clear that allegations of bad faith, malice, or even
fraud do not by themselves defeat judicial immunity if the judge had
jurisdiction (Walker v. McFarland (E.D. Tex. 2023-12-15); Whiticar v. Ervin-
Knott (E.D. La. 2021-10-26)). The critical question is whether the judge had
any jurisdiction at all. If the judge lacked jurisdiction, then even judicial acts
—such as compelling a settlement—are not immune.
The Breadth of Jurisdiction for Immunity Purposes
The Fifth Circuit has cautioned that jurisdiction is to be construed broadly in
the context of judicial immunity, to protect judicial independence (Holloway
v. Walker, 765 F.2d 517 (5th Cir. 1985)). Thus, even serious procedural
errors or actions that exceed statutory authority do not strip a judge of
immunity if the judge had some subject matter jurisdiction. Only when the
judge clearly lacks all jurisdiction does immunity fail.
For example, in Kemp v. Perkins, No. 08-60883 (5th Cir. 2009-05-07), the
court found that a judge who acted in excess of statutory authority still
retained immunity because the court had some subject matter jurisdiction.
By contrast, in Malina v. Gonzales, 994 F.2d 1121 (5th Cir. 1993), the court
found that a judge who cited a party for contempt in a matter over which the
court had no jurisdiction acted in the complete absence of jurisdiction and
was not immune.
It is important to note that Malina v. Gonzales, 994 F.2d 1121 (5th Cir. 1993)
was subject to rehearing (Malina v. Gonzales, 1 F.3d 304 (5th Cir. 1993)).
However, the core principle—that judicial immunity is lost when a judge acts
in the complete absence of jurisdiction—remains consistent with the broader
body of Fifth Circuit and Supreme Court precedent.
Disqualification and Recusal
Statutory disqualification or recusal is another context in which a judge may
lack jurisdiction. If a judge is required by statute to disqualify from a case
and fails to do so, any actions taken thereafter are in the complete absence
of jurisdiction (Pretrial motions). This is distinct from mere procedural error
or exceeding authority; it is a jurisdictional defect that strips the judge of
immunity.
Exceptions and Caveats
While the authorities are clear that judicial immunity is lost in the complete
absence of jurisdiction, courts construe jurisdiction broadly to avoid
undermining judicial independence. Thus, the threshold for finding a
complete absence of jurisdiction is high. If there is any arguable basis for
subject matter jurisdiction, immunity will likely apply, even if the judge’s
actions are erroneous or in excess of authority (Holloway v. Walker, 765 F.2d
517 (5th Cir. 1985); Adams v. McIlhany, 764 F.2d 294 (5th Cir. 1985)).

Additionally, the act in question must be judicial in nature. Nonjudicial acts
are not protected by immunity regardless of jurisdiction (Mireles v. Waco,
502 U.S. 9 (1991); Andrews v. Murphy (W.D. Tex. 2023-11-15)). However,
compelling a settlement in a pending case is typically a judicial act.
Conclusion
In summary, judicial immunity protects judges from liability for actions
taken in their judicial capacity, even if those actions are in excess of
authority, erroneous, or malicious. However, this immunity does not extend
to actions taken in the complete absence of all jurisdiction, such as presiding
over a matter without subject matter jurisdiction or after statutory
disqualification or recusal. Compelling a fraudulent settlement in a case
over which the judge has no jurisdiction is an act in the complete absence of
jurisdiction and is not protected by judicial immunity. The distinction
between excess of authority and absence of jurisdiction is critical, and
courts will construe jurisdiction broadly to preserve judicial independence,
but where jurisdiction is wholly lacking, immunity does not apply.

Extract
Absolute judicial immunity extends to all judicial acts which are not
performed in the clear absence of all jurisdiction." ... "Judicial immunity does
not extend to acts committed 'in the clear absence of all jurisdiction[.]'" ...
"We agree with the district court that Osborne's appointment of Littleton
occurred in excess of his statutory authority, but that Osborne did not lack
jurisdiction altogether." ... "The Supreme Court has explained, '[a] judge will
not be deprived of immunity because the action he took was in error, was
done maliciously, or was in excess of his authority; rather, he will be subject
to liability only when he has acted in the `clear absence of all jurisdiction.'
Summary
Judicial immunity is maintained unless a judge acts in the "clear absence of
all jurisdiction." The case discusses a situation where a judge acted in
excess of statutory authority but still retained some jurisdiction, thus
maintaining immunity. This supports the proposition that judicial immunity
is lost only when a judge acts without any jurisdiction whatsoever.

The question now becomes whether Judge Lambert's conduct was in
complete absence of all jurisdiction. Mireles, 502 U.S. at 12, 112 S.Ct. 286.
Although Judge Lambert's actions may have been 'judicial in nature,' she is
not entitled to immunity for those actions if her actions were 'taken in the
complete absence of all jurisdiction.' See id. 'Where a court has some
subject matter jurisdiction, there is sufficient jurisdiction for immunity
purposes.' Malina, 994 F.2d at 1125 (citation omitted). If Judge Lambert
'merely acted in excess of [her] authority,' she is still protected by judicial
immunity. Id. (citation omitted).
Summary
Conditions under which judicial immunity can be lost, specifically when a
judge acts in the complete absence of all jurisdiction. It distinguishes
between actions taken in excess of authority, which are still protected by
judicial immunity, and actions taken without any jurisdiction, which are not
protected. This directly supports the proposition that judicial immunity is
lost when a judge acts without any jurisdiction.
Malina v. Gonzales, 994 F.2d 1121 (5th Cir. 1993)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
Absolute judicial immunity extends to all judicial acts that are not performed
in the clear absence of all jurisdiction. ... Thus, a judge has no immunity (1)
for actions taken outside of his judicial capacity, or (2) for actions that are
judicial in nature, but occur in the complete absence of all jurisdiction. ...
The second prong of the Mireles test states that a judge will lose his
immunity if his judicial act occurred in the complete absence of all
jurisdiction. ... Even 'grave procedural errors do not deprive a judge of all
jurisdiction.' ... Therefore, at the time Judge Gonzales cited Malina for
contempt, he was acting in 'clear absence of all jurisdiction.'
Summary
The passage from "Malina v. Gonzales" discusses the conditions under which
judicial immunity is lost, specifically when a judge acts in the complete
absence of all jurisdiction. It distinguishes between actions taken in excess
of authority, which do not strip a judge of immunity, and actions taken
without any jurisdiction, which do. The case illustrates that even if a judge
commits procedural errors, these do not necessarily remove jurisdiction
unless the judge acts without any jurisdiction at all. This directly supports
the proposition that judicial immunity is lost when a judge acts without
jurisdiction.

Boswell v. Tex. Christian Univ., Civil Action No. 4:14-cv-0330-O (N.D. Tex.
Sep 16, 2014)
U.S. District Court — Northern District of Texas
Extract
A plaintiff may overcome the bar of absolute judicial immunity in two limited
circumstances. First, a judge is not immune for actions that are not 'judicial'
in nature. Id. Second, a judge is not immune from suit for actions that
although judicial in nature, are taken in the complete absence of all
jurisdiction. Id. at 12; see also Malina v. Gonzalez, 994 F.2d 1121, 1124 (5th
Cir. 1993). Acts by a judge are judicial in nature when they are 'normally
performed by a judge' and the affected party 'dealt with the judge in his
judicial capacity.' Mireles, 502 U.S. at 12 (quoting Sparkman, 453 U.S. at
362). Where a judge has 'some subject matter jurisdiction,' sufficient
jurisdiction exists for immunity purposes.
Summary
Circumstances under which judicial immunity can be overcome, specifically
when a judge acts in the complete absence of all jurisdiction. This directly
supports the proposition that judicial immunity is lost when a judge acts
without any jurisdiction, as opposed to merely acting in excess of
jurisdiction. The passage references relevant case law, including Mireles v.
Waco, which is central to the proposition.

Extract
The Mireles holding states that '[t]here are only two circumstances under

liability for nonjudicial action, i.e., actions not taken in the judge's judicial
capacity. Second, a judge is not immune for actions, although judicial in
nature, taken in the complete absence of all jurisdiction'. Id. at 11.
Summary
The passage directly addresses the conditions under which judicial immunity
can be overcome. It specifies that judicial immunity does not apply when a
judge acts in the complete absence of all jurisdiction, which aligns with the
proposition that a judge's actions taken without jurisdiction are not
protected by judicial immunity.

Harper v. Merckle, 638 F.2d 848 (5th Cir. 1981)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
The Court extended the protection of judicial immunity to all 'judicial acts'
unless those acts fall clearly outside the judge's subject matter jurisdiction.
Stump, supra, 435 U.S. at 359-64, 98 S.Ct. at 1106-08... We find, accordingly,
that Judge Merckle should not be accorded absolute judicial immunity
because his acts were not 'judicial acts.' As such, we need not reach the
question of whether he acted in complete absence of jurisdiction... In fact,
the Court in Stump drew on Bradley's distinction between acts 'in excess of
jurisdiction' (criminal court judge convicts plaintiff for a nonexistent crime,
cf. Turner v. Raynes, 611 F.2d 92, 93-97 (5th Cir. 1980)) and acts 'in clear
absence of all jurisdiction' (probate judge tries a criminal case), see Bradley
v. Fisher, supra, 80 U.S. (13 Wall.) at 352. Immunity is lost to the judge only
in the latter class of jurisdictionally defective cases.
Summary
Conditions under which judicial immunity applies and when it is lost. It
highlights that judicial immunity is maintained for acts in excess of
jurisdiction but is lost when a judge acts in the complete absence of
jurisdiction. The distinction between acts "in excess of jurisdiction" and acts
"in clear absence of all jurisdiction" is crucial, as the latter results in the loss
of immunity. This directly supports the proposition that a judge's actions
taken without any jurisdiction are not protected by judicial immunity.

Extract
The summary judgment in his favor entered below does not rest on the basis
of his undoubted defense of qualified immunity for good-faith actions but on
the higher peg of the absolute immunity from damages enjoyed by judges for
judicial acts, except those taken in the 'clear absence of all jurisdiction.' See

Summary
Concept of judicial immunity, specifically noting that judges enjoy absolute
immunity from damages for judicial acts unless those acts are taken in the
"clear absence of all jurisdiction." This aligns with the proposition that
judicial immunity is lost when a judge acts without any jurisdiction
whatsoever. The reference to Stump v. Sparkman and Crowe v. Lucas further
supports this understanding, as these cases are foundational in defining the
limits of judicial immunity.

Extract
Absolute judicial immunity extends to all judicial acts which are not
performed in the clear absence of all jurisdiction. ... McIlhany also had
sufficient 'jurisdiction,' as that term is used in judicial immunity analyses, for
his immunity to attach. Where a court has some subject-matter jurisdiction,
there is sufficient jurisdiction for immunity purposes. ... For the purposes of
defining 'jurisdiction' in this section 1983 immunity case, it is sufficient that
McIlhany's court was a court of general jurisdiction empowered to cite for
contempt, and that to deny immunity in the present case might create an
ambiguity in the law which would pose more than a frivolous threat to
disinterested judicial decision-making.

Summary
Judicial immunity applies to acts performed with some subject-matter
jurisdiction, even if the judge's actions are in excess of authority. However, it
also implies that if a judge acts in the complete absence of jurisdiction,
immunity would not apply. This aligns with the proposition that judicial
immunity is lost when a judge acts without any jurisdiction whatsoever.
Holloway v. Walker, 765 F.2d 517 (5th Cir. 1985)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
Judicial immunity does not extend to acts committed with a clear absence of
all jurisdiction. However, the term 'jurisdiction' is to be broadly construed to
effectuate the policies of guaranteeing a disinterested and independent
judicial decision-making process. Stump v. Sparkman, 98 S.Ct. at 1005.
Where a judge does not clearly lack all subject-matter jurisdiction, he does
not clearly lack all jurisdiction, and 'the same principle of exemption from
liability which obtains for errors committed in the ordinary prosecution of a
suit where there is jurisdiction of both subject and person, applies in cases
of this kind, and for the same reasons.' Bradley, 13 Wall. at 352.
Summary
While jurisdiction is broadly construed, immunity does not protect acts
where there is a clear absence of jurisdiction. This aligns with the
proposition that judicial immunity is lost when a judge acts without any
jurisdiction.

specifically mentions that a judge is not immune for actions taken in the
complete absence of all jurisdiction, which directly supports the proposition
that if a judge acts without jurisdiction, judicial immunity does not apply.

rather, he will be subject to liability only when he has acted in the ‘clear
absence of all jurisdiction.' May v. Sudderth, 97 F.3d 107, 110-111 (5th Cir.

clear absence of all jurisdiction, however erroneous the act and however evil
the motive').
Summary
The passage clearly outlines the conditions under which judicial immunity
does not apply, specifically when a judge acts in the complete absence of all
jurisdiction. This directly supports the proposition that judicial immunity is
lost when a judge acts without any jurisdiction, as opposed to merely acting

The passage clearly distinguishes between actions taken in excess of
authority and actions taken in the complete absence of jurisdiction. It
supports the proposition by affirming that judicial immunity is not lost for
actions merely in excess of authority but is lost when a judge acts without

Judicial immunity is not absolute and can be challenged if a judge's actions
are nonjudicial or taken in the complete absence of jurisdiction. This aligns
with the proposition that judicial immunity is lost when a judge acts without
any jurisdiction, supporting the idea that compelling a fraudulent settlement
without jurisdiction is not protected by immunity.
Andrews v. Murphy, 1-23-CV-0950-RP (W.D. Tex. Nov 15, 2023)
U.S. District Court — Western District of Texas
Extract
Judicial immunity can be overcome in two sets of circumstances: (1) “a judge
is not immune from liability for nonjudicial actions, i.e., actions not taken in
the judge's judicial capacity”; and (2) “a judge is not immune for actions,
though judicial in nature, taken in the complete absence of all jurisdiction.”
Mireles, 502 U.S. at 11-12 (citations omitted).
Summary
The passage clearly outlines the circumstances under which judicial
immunity can be overcome, specifically when a judge acts in the complete
absence of all jurisdiction. This directly supports the proposition that judicial
immunity is lost when a judge acts without any jurisdiction, as opposed to

merely acting in excess of jurisdiction. The reference to Mireles v. Waco
further solidifies this understanding, as it is a key case in defining the limits
of judicial immunity.
Hutchings v. Cnty. of Llano, Case No. 1:20-CV-308-LY-SH (W.D. Tex. Jul 27,
2020)
U.S. District Court — Western District of Texas
Extract
Absolute judicial immunity is overcome only in two rather narrow sets of
circumstances: First, a judge is not immune from liability for nonjudicial
actions, i.e., actions not taken in the judge's judicial capacity; and second, a
judge is not immune for actions, although judicial in nature, taken in
complete absence of all jurisdiction. Mireles, 502 U.S. at 11-12. 'For
purposes of immunity, the judge's jurisdiction is construed broadly and a
judge is not deprived of immunity 'because the action he took was in error,
was done maliciously, or was in excess of his authority; rather, he will be
subject to liability only when he has acted in the 'clear absence of all
jurisdiction.'' Davis v. Bayless, 70 F.3d 367, 373 (5th Cir. 1995) (quoting
Stump v. Sparkman, 435 U.S. 349, 357-60 (1978)).
Summary
The passage from Hutchings v. Cnty. of Llano outlines the conditions under
which judicial immunity can be overcome. It specifies that a judge is not
immune from liability when actions are taken in the complete absence of all
jurisdiction, aligning with the proposition that judicial immunity is lost when
a judge acts without any jurisdiction. This supports the idea that if a judge
acts without subject matter jurisdiction or after disqualification, immunity
does not apply.

U.S. District Court — Eastern District of Texas
Extract
Moreover, as the Court has stated previously, 'judges have absolute
immunity from lawsuits when they perform a normal judicial function, unless
they are acting in the clear absence of all jurisdiction.' Paselk v. Texas, No.
4:13-CV-97, 2013 WL 6187005, at *8 (E.D. Tex. Nov. 26, 2013) (Mazzant, J.)
(citing Stump v. Sparkman, 435 U.S. 349, 357-60 (1978)). 'A judge is not
deprived of immunity because the action he took was erroneous, malicious,
or exceeded his authority. A judicial act is one that is a function normally
performed by a judge, that occurred in the courtroom or appropriate adjunct
spaces such as a judge's chambers, involved a controversy centered around

a case pending before the court, and arose directly out of a visit to the judge
in her official capacity.' Id. (citing Stump, 435 U.S. at 360-62); see also
Mitchell v. McBryde, 944 F.2d 229, 230 (5th Cir. 1991) ('Judges are immune
from damage claims arising out of acts performed in the exercise of their
judicial functions, even when the judge is accused of acting maliciously. ...
The fact that it is alleged that the judge acted pursuant to a conspiracy and
committed grave procedural errors is not sufficient to avoid absolute judicial
immunity.' 'A judge is subject to liability only if he/she acts in the clear
absence of all jurisdiction.' Id.
Summary
The passage clearly distinguishes between actions taken in excess of
jurisdiction and those taken in the complete absence of jurisdiction. It
emphasizes that judicial immunity is maintained unless a judge acts in the
clear absence of all jurisdiction. This aligns with the proposition that judicial
immunity is lost when a judge acts without any jurisdiction, such as
presiding over a matter without subject matter jurisdiction or after
disqualification.
Friston v. MDOC, CAUSE NO. 1:17-cv-329-HSO-JCG (S.D. Miss. Apr 02,
2019)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of Mississippi
Extract
Judicial immunity can 'be overcome in two circumstances: (1) a judge is not
immune from liability for nonjudicial actions, i.e., actions not taken in the
judge's judicial capacity; and (2) a judge is not immune for actions, though
judicial in nature, taken in the complete absence of all jurisdiction.'
Summary
The passage from "Friston v. MDOC" outlines the circumstances under
which judicial immunity can be overcome, specifically when a judge acts in
the complete absence of all jurisdiction. This directly supports the
proposition that judicial immunity is lost when a judge acts without any
jurisdiction, as opposed to merely acting in excess of jurisdiction. The
passage aligns with the legal principles established in cases like Mireles v.
Waco and Ballard v. Wall, which are also cited in the proposition.

Extract
Absolute judicial immunity does not apply in certain limited circumstances.
Mireles, 502 U.S. at 11-12; Davis, 565 F.3d at 221. First, judges are not
immune from liability for non-judicial actions, i.e., actions not taken in the
judge's judicial capacity. Mireles, 502 U.S. at 11-12; Davis, 565 F.3d at 221.
Second, judges are not immune for actions, though judicial in nature, taken
in complete absence of all jurisdiction. Mireles, 502 U.S. at 11-12; Davis, 565
F.3d at 221.
Summary
The passage from "Gokey v. Economidy" outlines the circumstances under
which judicial immunity does not apply, specifically when a judge acts in the
complete absence of all jurisdiction. This directly supports the proposition
that judicial immunity is lost when a judge acts without jurisdiction, as
opposed to merely acting in excess of authority. The reference to Mireles v.
Waco and Davis v. Tarrant County further reinforces this legal principle.

2023)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of Mississippi
Extract
"A judge will not be deprived of immunity because the action he took was in
error, was done maliciously, or was in excess of his authority; rather, he will
be subject to liability only when he has acted in the clear absence of all
jurisdiction." Stump v. Sparkman, 435 U.S. 349, 356-57 (1978) (quotation
omitted). “The doctrine of judicial immunity can be overcome under two sets
of circumstances: (i) nonjudicial actions, which are actions not taken in the
judge's judicial capacity and (ii) actions taken in the complete absence of all
jurisdiction, even though they are judicial in nature.” Lang, 2013 WL
3095058, at *2 (citing Ballard, 413 F.3d at 515).
Summary
The passage clearly outlines the conditions under which judicial immunity
can be overcome, specifically when a judge acts in the complete absence of
all jurisdiction. This directly supports the proposition that judicial immunity
is lost when a judge acts without any jurisdiction, as opposed to merely
acting in excess of authority. The passage references established case law,
including Stump v. Sparkman and Ballard v. Wall, which are relevant to the
Fifth Circuit.
Crowe v. Lucas, 595 F.2d 985 (5th Cir. 1979)

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
The Supreme Court has recently held that a judge cannot be held liable
under the civil rights statutes for his judicial acts unless those acts are
committed in the 'clear absence of all jurisdiction.' Stump v. Sparkman, 435
U.S. 349, 356, 357, 98 S.Ct. 1099, 1105, 55 L.Ed.2d 331, 339 (1978); See
Pierson v. Ray, 386 U.S. 547, 87 S.Ct. 1213, 18 L.Ed.2d 288 (1967). Thus, if
any of the acts of Municipal Judge Harold Ward at issue here can properly
be characterized as judicial acts, and if those acts were not committed in the
'clear absence of all jurisdiction,' then the acts cannot be the basis of a §
1983 suit.
Summary
Judicial immunity protects judges from liability for their judicial acts unless
those acts are performed in the "clear absence of all jurisdiction." This
aligns with the proposition that judicial immunity is lost when a judge acts
without any jurisdiction, as opposed to merely acting in excess of
jurisdiction. The passage supports the idea that if a judge's actions are taken
without any jurisdiction, then immunity does not apply.
Davis v. Bayless, 70 F.3d 367, 1995 WL 692991 (5th Cir. 1995)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
Judges are afforded absolute immunity when they (1) perform a normal
judicial function; unless they are (2) acting in the clear absence of all
jurisdiction. Stump v. Sparkman, 435 U.S. 349, 357-60, 98 S.Ct. 1099,
1105-06, 55 L.Ed.2d 331 (1978). For purposes of immunity, the judge's
jurisdiction is construed broadly and a judge is not deprived of immunity
'because the action he took was in error, was done maliciously, or was in
excess of his authority; rather, he will be subject to liability only when he has
acted in the 'clear absence of all jurisdiction.'
Summary
The passage from "Davis v. Bayless" clarifies the conditions under which
judicial immunity applies. It states that judges have absolute immunity when
performing normal judicial functions unless they act in the clear absence of
all jurisdiction. This aligns with the proposition that judicial immunity is lost
when a judge acts without any jurisdiction, not merely when acting in excess
of authority. The passage supports the idea that if a judge acts without
subject matter jurisdiction or after disqualification, immunity does not apply.

Boyd v. Biggers, 31 F.3d 279 (5th Cir. 1994)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
Judicial officers are entitled to absolute immunity from claims for damages
arising out of acts performed in the exercise of their judicial functions. ...
Judicial immunity can be overcome only by showing that the actions
complained of were nonjudicial in nature or by showing that the actions
were taken in the complete absence of all jurisdiction. Mireles v. Waco, 502
U.S. 9, ----, 112 S.Ct. 286, 288, 116 L.Ed.2d 9 (1991); see Forrester v. White,
484 U.S. 219, 220-21, 108 S.Ct. 538, 540-41, 98 L.Ed.2d 555 (1988) (holding
that a state judge's dismissal of a subordinate court employee is not a
judicial act entitled to absolute immunity).
Summary
The passage from "Boyd v. Biggers" discusses the conditions under which
judicial immunity can be overcome. It specifically states that judicial
immunity is only lost when actions are taken in the complete absence of all
jurisdiction, aligning with the proposition that a judge's actions are not
protected by immunity if they are taken without any jurisdiction whatsoever.
This supports the proposition by clarifying the limits of judicial immunity
and the circumstances under which it can be challenged.
Pretrial motions
Texas Criminal Lawyer's Handbook. Volume 1-2 (2024) - James
Publishing - Mark G. Daniel, Robert K. Gill
Extract
A judge or a justice of the peace may not sit in a case if either of the parties
is related to him by affinity or consanguinity within the third degree... A
judge must disqualify in any proceeding in which: (1) the judge has served
as a lawyer in the matter in controversy... (3) either of the parties may be
related to the judge by affinity or consanguinity within the third degree.
Summary
The passage outlines specific statutory grounds for disqualification of judges
in Texas, such as familial relationships with parties involved or prior
involvement as a lawyer in the matter. These grounds are statutory
limitations on a judge's authority to preside over a case. If a judge were to
preside over a case despite being disqualified under these grounds, it would
constitute acting in the complete absence of jurisdiction, as the judge would
be violating explicit statutory prohibitions. This aligns with the proposition
that judicial immunity is lost when a judge acts without jurisdiction.

Texas Courts And Subject Matter Jurisdiction
Extract
Subject-matter jurisdiction concerns a court's power to hear a case. Without
it, a court does not have authority to decide a case. ... Whether a trial court
has subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law. Subject matter
jurisdiction is never presumed and cannot be waived or conferred by
agreement. And the absence of subject matter jurisdiction can generally be
raised at any time and can be raised by a court sua sponte.
Summary
Subject matter jurisdiction is a fundamental requirement for a court's
authority to decide a case. It cannot be waived or conferred by agreement,
and its absence can be raised at any time. This aligns with the proposition
that a judge's actions taken without subject matter jurisdiction are in the
complete absence of jurisdiction, thus negating judicial immunity.
