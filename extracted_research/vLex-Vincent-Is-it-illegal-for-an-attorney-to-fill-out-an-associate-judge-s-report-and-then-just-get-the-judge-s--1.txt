Question
Is it illegal for an attorney to fill out an associate judge's report and then just
get the judge's rubber stamp on it? if so, what's the consequences of
allowing this?
Answer (Texas)
Short response
Yes, it is improper and potentially illegal for an attorney to fill out an
associate judge’s report and merely obtain the judge’s signature without the
judge’s independent review and findings, as Texas law requires the associate
judge to personally prepare, sign, and submit their report. Allowing this
practice undermines judicial integrity, may invalidate the resulting orders,
and can expose both the attorney and judge to disciplinary action or
sanctions.
Summary
Texas statutes governing associate judges in family law and probate matters
explicitly require that the associate judge, not an attorney or party, prepare,
sign, and submit the report containing findings, conclusions, or
recommendations. The statutory process is designed to ensure that judicial
officers exercise independent judgment and that parties receive due
process, including notice and the opportunity to request a de novo hearing
before the referring court.
If an attorney fills out the report and the judge simply “rubber stamps” it,
this violates statutory requirements and the judicial process, potentially
rendering the order invalid and subject to challenge or appeal. Such conduct
may also constitute an ethical violation, exposing the attorney to disciplinary
proceedings and the judge to sanctions or mandatory reporting obligations
under the Texas Code of Judicial Conduct.
Background and Relevant Law
Legislative Framework
The Texas Family Code and Texas Government Code set out the duties and
procedures for associate judges in family law and probate matters. Under
Texas Family Code § 201.011, the associate judge’s report must be in
writing, in the form directed by the referring court, and may include
findings, conclusions, or recommendations, potentially in the form of a
proposed order. Critically, the statute requires that the associate judge
provide notice of the substance of the report to the parties after a hearing,

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
underscoring the judge’s personal responsibility for the report’s content and
communication (Tex. Fam. Code § 201.011).
Similarly, Texas Government Code § 54A.212 requires the associate judge to
prepare a report in the form directed by the referring court, which must be
signed and dated by the associate judge. The statute makes clear that the
preparation, signing, and submission of the report are duties of the
associate judge, not of attorneys or parties (Tex. Gov’t. Code § 54A.212).
The powers of associate judges, as set out in Texas Family Code § 201.007
and Texas Government Code § 54A.008, include making findings of fact,
formulating conclusions of law, and recommending orders. These provisions
reinforce that the associate judge is expected to independently evaluate the
evidence and make judicial determinations, not to delegate these core
judicial functions to attorneys (Tex. Fam. Code § 201.007; Tex. Gov’t. Code §
54A.008).
Case Law
Texas appellate courts have consistently interpreted these statutes to
require that associate judges personally prepare and submit their reports,
which are not final until adopted by the referring court. In K.E.B. v. Off. of
Att’y Gen. of Tex., 698 S.W.3d 76 (Tex. App. 2024), the court explained that
the associate judge’s report is a recommendation that must be sent to the
referring court, and only becomes a final order upon the referring court’s
signature. The process is designed to ensure judicial oversight and the
opportunity for parties to request a de novo hearing.
Similarly, In re K.M.H., 14-22-00784-CV (Tex. App. Mar 16, 2023) held that
the associate judge’s report is not final until adopted by the referring court,
and the statutory process must be followed to ensure validity. Stein v. Stein,
868 S.W.2d 902 (Tex. App. 1994) further clarified that associate judges do
not have the power to render judgment, but only to make findings and
recommendations, which become effective only when adopted by the
referring court.
Other cases, such as In re T.D.S.T., 287 S.W.3d 268 (Tex. App. 2009) and 
Garza v. Family and Protective Serv., 212 S.W.3d 373 (Tex. App. 2006),
reinforce that the associate judge is responsible for preparing, signing, and
submitting the report, and that this responsibility cannot be delegated to
attorneys.
Ethical and Disciplinary Framework
The Texas Supreme Court has recognized the ethical obligations of both
judges and attorneys to maintain the integrity of the judicial process. In 
Brewer v. Lennox Hearth Prods., LLC, 601 S.W.3d 704 (Tex. 2020), the court
noted that judges must report unethical conduct by attorneys to the
Commission for Lawyer Discipline, and that attorneys are subject to
discipline for ethical lapses. Comm’n for Lawyer Discipline v. Cantu, 587
S.W.3d 779 (Tex. 2019) further emphasized that judges are required to take

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
appropriate action if they become aware of attorney misconduct that raises
substantial questions about honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness.
Texas courts also have inherent authority to sanction abuses of the judicial
process, even if not specifically covered by statute or rule (Nelson v. Nelson,
NO. 01-13-00816-CV (Tex. App. Mar 12, 2015)).
Analysis
Statutory Requirements and Judicial Duties
The legislative framework is clear: the associate judge must personally
prepare, sign, and submit the report containing findings, conclusions, or
recommendations. The statutes do not authorize attorneys or parties to
prepare these reports on behalf of the judge. The requirement that the
report be in writing, in the form directed by the referring court, and signed
and dated by the associate judge, is designed to ensure that the judge has
independently reviewed the evidence, made findings, and exercised judicial
discretion (Tex. Fam. Code § 201.011; Tex. Gov’t. Code § 54A.212).
The powers granted to associate judges under Texas Family Code § 201.007
and Texas Government Code § 54A.008—making findings of fact, formulating
conclusions of law, and recommending orders—are inherently judicial
functions. These cannot be delegated to attorneys, as doing so would
undermine the integrity of the judicial process and violate the statutory
scheme (Tex. Fam. Code § 201.007; Tex. Gov’t. Code § 54A.008).
Case Law Interpretation
Texas appellate courts have consistently interpreted these statutes to
require that associate judges personally prepare and submit their reports. In 
K.E.B. v. Off. of Att’y Gen. of Tex., 698 S.W.3d 76 (Tex. App. 2024) and In re
K.M.H., 14-22-00784-CV (Tex. App. Mar 16, 2023), the courts emphasized
that the associate judge’s report is a recommendation that must be sent to
the referring court, and only becomes a final order upon the referring
court’s signature. The process is designed to ensure judicial oversight and
the opportunity for parties to request a de novo hearing.
Stein v. Stein, 868 S.W.2d 902 (Tex. App. 1994) further clarified that
associate judges do not have the power to render judgment, but only to
make findings and recommendations, which become effective only when
adopted by the referring court. This reinforces the requirement that the
associate judge, not an attorney, must prepare the report.
Other cases, such as In re T.D.S.T., 287 S.W.3d 268 (Tex. App. 2009) and 
Garza v. Family and Protective Serv., 212 S.W.3d 373 (Tex. App. 2006),
reinforce that the associate judge is responsible for preparing, signing, and
submitting the report, and that this responsibility cannot be delegated to
attorneys.

Consequences of Noncompliance
If an attorney fills out the associate judge’s report and the judge merely
“rubber stamps” it, several legal and ethical consequences may follow:
Invalidity of Orders: Orders resulting from such a process may be
invalid, as they do not comply with statutory requirements. Parties may
challenge these orders on appeal or through collateral attack, arguing
that the judge did not exercise independent judgment or follow the
required procedures (K.E.B. v. Off. of Att’y Gen. of Tex., 698 S.W.3d 76
(Tex. App. 2024); In re K.M.H., 14-22-00784-CV (Tex. App. Mar 16,
2023)).
Due Process Violations: The statutory process is designed to protect
parties’ due process rights, including notice of the judge’s findings and
the opportunity to request a de novo hearing. If the report does not
reflect the judge’s independent findings, parties may be deprived of
these rights, further undermining the validity of the order.
Ethical Violations and Disciplinary Action: Attorneys who engage in
this conduct may be subject to disciplinary proceedings for violating
the Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct. Judges who
permit or participate in this practice may be required to report the
conduct and may themselves be subject to discipline under the Texas
Code of Judicial Conduct (Brewer v. Lennox Hearth Prods., LLC, 601
S.W.3d 704 (Tex. 2020); Comm’n for Lawyer Discipline v. Cantu, 587
S.W.3d 779 (Tex. 2019)).
Sanctions for Abuse of Process: Texas courts have inherent authority
to sanction abuses of the judicial process, including conduct that
undermines the integrity of judicial proceedings (Nelson v. Nelson, NO.
01-13-00816-CV (Tex. App. Mar 12, 2015)).
Ethical and Judicial Reporting Obligations
The Texas Supreme Court has made clear that judges have a duty to report
attorney misconduct that raises substantial questions about honesty,
trustworthiness, or fitness. If a judge becomes aware that an attorney has
improperly filled out a report and sought the judge’s signature without
independent review, the judge must take appropriate action, which may
include reporting the conduct to the Office of the General Counsel of the
State Bar of Texas (Comm’n for Lawyer Discipline v. Cantu, 587 S.W.3d 779
(Tex. 2019)).
Attorneys who engage in this conduct may be found to have violated
professional conduct rules, including those relating to candor toward the
tribunal and the prohibition against conduct involving dishonesty, fraud,
deceit, or misrepresentation. Disciplinary action may include suspension or
disbarment, depending on the severity of the violation.

Judicial Integrity and Public Confidence
Allowing attorneys to fill out associate judge’s reports and obtain a “rubber
stamp” signature from the judge undermines the integrity of the judicial
process and erodes public confidence in the courts. The statutory scheme is
designed to ensure that judicial officers exercise independent judgment and
that parties receive fair and impartial consideration of their cases.
Bypassing these safeguards not only violates the law but also threatens the
legitimacy of the judicial system.
Exceptions and Caveats
There are no statutory or case law exceptions permitting attorneys to
prepare associate judge’s reports for the judge’s signature. The statutes and
case law are unequivocal in assigning this responsibility to the associate
judge. While attorneys may prepare proposed orders for the court’s
consideration, the final report and findings must be the product of the
judge’s independent review and must be signed and submitted by the judge.
It is possible that minor clerical assistance or the use of standardized forms
directed by the court may be permissible, provided that the judge
independently reviews, approves, and signs the report. However, any
practice that results in the judge abdicating their responsibility to make
findings and recommendations is not permitted.
Conclusion
In summary, Texas law requires that associate judges personally prepare,
sign, and submit their reports containing findings, conclusions, or
recommendations. It is improper and potentially illegal for an attorney to fill
out the report and merely obtain the judge’s signature without the judge’s
independent review and findings. Orders resulting from such a process may
be invalid, subject to challenge or appeal, and may expose both the attorney
and judge to disciplinary action or sanctions. The integrity of the judicial
process demands that judges exercise independent judgment and that
parties receive due process, as mandated by statute and reinforced by Texas
appellate courts and ethical rules.

Texas Supreme Court
Extract
The trial court's referral of the matter to the Commission for Lawyer
Discipline is one method available to courts to help ensure ethical lapses are
disciplined, when warranted, according to the processes, procedures, and
standards of review applicable to all attorneys. If a judge has knowledge of

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
unethical conduct, the judge can, and indeed must, refer the matter for
disciplinary proceedings. See Tex. Code Jud. Conduct, Canon 3(d)(2) ; Tex.
Disciplinary Rules of Prof'l Conduct R. 8.03(a); cf. Code of Conduct for U.S.
Judges cmt. 3(B)(6); Comm'n for Lawyer Discipline v. Cantu, 587 S.W.3d 779,
784 (Tex. 2019) ('The obligation to report attorney misconduct [to the State
Bar] applied doubly to Judge Isgur, who is not only a judge but a licensed
Texas attorney.')
Summary
Ethical obligations of judges and attorneys in Texas to report unethical
conduct. If an attorney engages in unethical behavior, such as improperly
filling out a judge's report and obtaining a rubber stamp approval, it is the
responsibility of the judge to report this conduct to the Commission for
Lawyer Discipline. This ensures that ethical lapses are addressed through
the appropriate disciplinary processes. The passage highlights the
importance of maintaining ethical standards and the mechanisms in place to
address violations.

Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Next, we address appellee's argument that the associate judge had the
power to render judgment, and did render judgment orally from the bench
at the time the settlement agreement was read into the record in open court.
The parties have not cited, nor have we been able to locate any case law in
Texas that addresses the issue of whether an associate judge has the power
to render judgment. However, Section 54.007 of the Government Code sets
out the powers and duties of family law associate judges. Such powers
include making findings of fact, formulating conclusions of law, and
recommending the judgment to be made in a case. TEX.GOV'T CODE ANN. §
54.007 (Vernon 1988) (emphasis added). The listed powers do not include
rendering judgment. In fact, the referring court is free to adopt or reject the
recommendation of the master, TEX.GOV'T CODE ANN. § 54.011 (Vernon
1988), and the findings and recommendations of the master become the
decree or order of the referring court only on the referring court's signing
an order or decree conforming to the master's report. TEX.GOV'T CODE
ANN. § 54.103 (Vernon 1988) (emphasis added).
Summary
An associate judge in Texas does not have the power to render judgment.
Their role is limited to making findings of fact, formulating conclusions of
law, and recommending judgments. The referring court has the authority to
adopt or reject these recommendations, and the findings only become
official when the referring court signs an order or decree conforming to the
associate judge's report. This implies that an attorney filling out an associate

judge's report and obtaining a rubber stamp from the judge would bypass
the necessary judicial review and approval process, which could be
considered improper or illegal.

Texas courts have the inherent power to sanction for an abuse of the judicial
process that may not be covered by any specific rule or statute.
Summary
Texas courts possess inherent authority to impose sanctions for abuses of
the judicial process. This authority is not limited to specific rules or statutes,
implying that actions undermining the integrity of the judicial process, such
as an attorney improperly filling out a judge's report, could be subject to
sanctions. The passage does not specify the exact consequences but
indicates that the courts have the power to address such issues.

Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
An associate judge's report can be final in some situations, as we soon
discuss, but our statutory law contemplates a scheme in which the report is
not final until adopted by the referring court. For example, our law provides
that the report may contain 'recommendations' and be 'in the form of a
proposed order.' See Tex. Fam. Code § 201.011(a). Once completed, the
report must be sent to the referring court. See Tex. Fam. Code § 201.011(e).
A party may then request the referring court for a de novo hearing, where
issues can be reconsidered and witnesses may be presented. See Tex. Fam.
Code § 201.015(a), (c). If a party does not request a de novo hearing, the
referring court may adopt, modify, or reject the associate judge's report;
hear further evidence; or recommit the matter to the associate judge for
further proceedings. See Tex. Fam. Code § 201.014(a). In those situations
where a de novo hearing has not been requested, the associate judge's
report generally becomes the final order of the referring court only upon the
referring court's signature. See Tex. Fam. Code § 201.013(b).
Summary
An associate judge's report is not final until it is adopted by the referring
court. The report is initially a recommendation and must be sent to the

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
referring court, which can adopt, modify, or reject it. The referring court's
signature is necessary for the report to become a final order. This indicates
that an attorney filling out an associate judge's report and obtaining a
rubber stamp from the judge without the proper adoption process by the
referring court would not comply with the statutory requirements. The
consequences of bypassing this process could include the report not being
considered a final order, and potentially being subject to further legal
challenges or appeals.

An associate judge’s recommendation can become a final order in some
situations, but statutory law contemplates a scheme in which the report or
recommendations are not final until adopted by the referring court. For
example, the law provides that the report may contain 'recommendations'
and be 'in the form of a proposed order.' See Tex. Fam. Code Ann. §
201.011(a). Once completed, the report must be sent to the referring court.

recommit the matter to the associate judge for further proceedings. See Tex.
Fam. Code Ann. § 201.014(a). In those situations when a de novo hearing
has not been requested, the associate judge’s report generally becomes the
final order of the referring court only upon the referring court’s signature.
See Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 201.013(b).
Summary
Statutory process for an associate judge's report to become a final order. It
emphasizes that the report is not final until the referring court adopts it,
which involves the court's signature. This suggests that an attorney filling
out a report and merely obtaining a judge's rubber stamp without the court's
proper review and adoption process would not comply with the statutory
requirements. The consequences of bypassing this process could include the
report not being considered a valid final order, and potentially, legal
challenges or appeals could arise due to the improper procedure.

Extract
Chapter 201 of the family code authorizes district courts to appoint
associate judges to consider suits affecting the parent-child relationship. Id.
§ 201.001. Upon referral of a case, an associate judge may conduct a
hearing on the issues, including the taking of evidence and examination of
witnesses. Id. § 201.007. The associate judge may then make findings of fact
and conclusions of law, and may 'recommend an order to be rendered in a
case.' Id. § 201.007(a)(8)-(10). After a hearing, an associate judge 'shall send
the associate judge's signed and dated report, including any proposed order,
and all other papers relating to the case to the referring court.' Id. §
201.011(e). The report must be in writing in a form directed by the referring
court; however, '[t]he form may be a notation on the referring court's docket

Summary
The Texas Family Code outlines specific procedures for associate judges in
family law cases. The associate judge is responsible for conducting hearings,
making findings of fact, and recommending orders. The associate judge
must sign and date their report, which is then sent to the referring court.
This implies that the associate judge is expected to personally prepare and
authenticate their report. The passage does not explicitly address the
legality of an attorney preparing the report for the judge, but it emphasizes
the associate judge's role in preparing and signing the report. This suggests
that it would be inappropriate and potentially illegal for an attorney to fill
out the report and merely obtain a rubber stamp from the judge, as it would
undermine the judge's duty to independently evaluate and report on the
case.

associate judge.
Comm'n for Lawyer Discipline v. Cantu, 587 S.W.3d 779 (Tex. 2019)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
The Texas rules of judicial conduct are consistent with these federal
standards. Texas Code of Judicial Conduct Canon 3(D)(2) states: A judge who
receives information clearly establishing that a lawyer has committed a
violation of the Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct should take
appropriate action. A judge having knowledge that a lawyer had committed
a violation of the Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct that
raises a substantial question as to the lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness or
fitness as a lawyer in other respects shall inform the Office of the General
Counsel of the State Bar of Texas or take other appropriate action.
Summary
The Texas Code of Judicial Conduct requires judges to take appropriate
action if they receive information indicating a lawyer has violated
professional conduct rules. This includes reporting the conduct to the
appropriate authorities if it raises substantial questions about the lawyer's
honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness. This implies that if an attorney
improperly fills out a judge's report and it is deemed a violation of
professional conduct, the judge is obligated to report it.

Section FAMILY CODE 201.015 in writing before the start of a hearing
conducted by the associate judge.
Summary
An associate judge in Texas has the authority to make findings of fact,
formulate conclusions of law, and recommend or render orders in cases. This
implies that the associate judge is expected to independently evaluate the
evidence and make judicial determinations. The passage does not explicitly
address the legality of an attorney filling out a judge's report for a rubber
stamp, but it suggests that the judge should be actively involved in the
decision-making process. Therefore, if an attorney were to fill out a report
and merely obtain a rubber stamp from the judge without the judge's
independent evaluation, it could potentially undermine the judicial process
and the judge's responsibilities.

Extract
The associate judge's report may contain the associate judge's findings,
conclusions, or recommendations and may be in the form of a proposed
order. The associate judge's report must be in writing in the form directed
by the referring court. After a hearing, the associate judge shall provide the
parties participating in the hearing notice of the substance of the associate
judge's report, including any proposed order.
Summary
The associate judge's report must be in writing and in the form directed by
the referring court. The report may contain the associate judge's findings,
conclusions, or recommendations and may be in the form of a proposed
order. The associate judge is responsible for providing notice of the report to
the parties involved. This implies that the associate judge is the one who
must prepare the report, and it should reflect their findings and conclusions.
Therefore, it would be inappropriate and potentially illegal for an attorney to
fill out the report and merely obtain a rubber stamp from the judge, as this
would not comply with the requirement that the report reflects the associate
judge's findings and conclusions.

proposed order. After a hearing conducted by an associate judge, the
associate judge shall send the associate judge's signed and dated report,
including any proposed order, and all other papers relating to the case to the
referring court.
Summary
The associate judge is responsible for preparing their report, which may
include findings, conclusions, or recommendations. The report must be
prepared in the form directed by the referring court and must be signed and
dated by the associate judge. This indicates that the preparation of the
report is a duty of the associate judge, not an attorney. Therefore, if an
attorney were to fill out the report and simply obtain a rubber stamp from
the judge, it would not comply with the statutory requirements outlined in
this section.
Tex. Gov't. Code § 54A.008 Tex. Gov't. Code § 54A.008 Powers
Extract
Except as limited by an order of referral, an associate judge to whom a case
is referred may: ... make findings of fact on evidence; formulate conclusions
of law; ... recommend the rulings, orders, or judgment to be made in a
case; ... take action as necessary and proper for the efficient performance of
the duties required by the order of referral.
Summary
Associate judges in Texas have the authority to make findings of fact,
formulate conclusions of law, and recommend rulings, orders, or judgments.
This implies that the associate judge is expected to perform these duties
themselves, rather than delegating them to an attorney. The passage does
not explicitly address the legality of an attorney filling out a report for an
associate judge, but it suggests that the associate judge should be the one
making the findings and recommendations. Therefore, if an attorney were to
fill out the report and the judge merely rubber-stamped it, it could be seen
as a failure of the judge to perform their duties as required by the order of
referral.
