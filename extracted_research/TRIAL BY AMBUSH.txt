Question
When an attorney fails to respond to an emergency motion that makes
allegations against her client, says she'll respond in writing, but never does,
and then shows up to the hearing and blindsides the father with temporary
orders and hands the judge a propsoed order asking him to deny the motion
she never responded to, and the judge does it, how is this a major violation
of due process and potentially criminal, especially when the associate judge
was not vested with an order of referral, and the attorney is likely
unauthorized to represent her client in the first place.
Answer (Texas)
Short response
The scenario described constitutes a significant violation of due process
under Texas law, as it involves the issuance of temporary orders without
proper notice, hearing, or jurisdiction—especially where the associate judge
lacked a valid order of referral and the attorney may have been
unauthorized to represent her client. While these actions undermine the
integrity of the judicial process and may render the orders void, criminal
liability would generally arise only if there is clear evidence of unauthorized
practice of law or intentional fraud on the court.
Summary
Texas law requires strict adherence to procedural safeguards in family law
proceedings, including proper notice, opportunity to be heard, and
jurisdictional authority for both judges and attorneys. When an attorney fails
to respond to an emergency motion, appears at a hearing without prior
written response, and secures orders from an associate judge who lacks a
valid referral, these actions collectively violate statutory and constitutional
due process rights, potentially rendering any resulting orders void.
Furthermore, if the attorney was not authorized to represent her client, this
could constitute unauthorized practice of law, which is subject to civil
enforcement and, in some cases, criminal penalties. However, not every due
process violation is criminal; criminality would depend on the presence of
willful misconduct, such as knowingly practicing law without a license or
engaging in fraud. The most immediate legal consequences are the voiding
of improperly issued orders and potential disciplinary or civil action against
the attorney and the associate judge.

Background and Relevant Law
Legislative Framework
1. Authority of Associate Judges: Tex. Fam. Code § 201.006
Under Texas Family Code § 201.006, an associate judge may only act in a
case if the referring court has issued either an individual or general order of
referral. This order is a jurisdictional prerequisite; without it, the associate
judge lacks authority to hear the case or issue orders. Any action taken by
an associate judge in the absence of a valid referral order is void or voidable
for lack of jurisdiction, and the statute allows the referring court to limit the
associate judge’s powers through the referral order. This requirement is
fundamental to the lawful exercise of judicial power in family law matters,
ensuring that only properly authorized judicial officers preside over cases
(Tex. Fam. Code § 201.006).
2. Temporary Orders and Due Process: Tex. Fam. Code § 105.001
Section 105.001 of the Texas Family Code governs the issuance of temporary
orders in family law cases. It generally requires that such orders be made
only after notice and a hearing, except in limited emergency circumstances
(typically involving governmental entities under Chapter 262). The statute
further restricts the court’s ability to issue certain severe remedies—such as
excluding a parent from possession or access to a child—unless supported
by a verified pleading or affidavit. Orders issued without proper notice,
hearing, or verification, except in narrowly defined emergencies, violate the
procedural protections enshrined in this statute (Tex. Fam. Code § 105.001).
Case Law
1. Jurisdiction and Due Process: In re Sproul
The Texas Court of Appeals in In re Sproul emphasized that relief cannot be
awarded in family law proceedings without proper pleadings and personal
service or notice. Under Chapter 157, enforcement actions require specific
allegations and at least 10 days’ personal service before the hearing.
Similarly, modification proceedings under Chapter 156 require citation and
service in accordance with the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. Failure to
provide proper notice and service deprives the court of jurisdiction over the
respondent, making any relief granted improper and a violation of due
process. The court underscored that due process requires notice and an
opportunity to be heard before any adverse action is taken (In re Sproul,
04-24-00202-CV (Tex. App. Jun 20, 2024)).
2. Associate Judge Authority and Notice: Target Logistics, Inc. v.
Office of the Attorney Gen. of Tex.
In Target Logistics, the appellate court held that an associate judge lacks
jurisdiction to render orders in the absence of a valid referral order under §
201.006. Orders entered without such authority are void. The court also
reaffirmed that entering orders without adequate notice violates the most

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
basic requirements of due process, rendering such judgments
constitutionally infirm. The right to notice and an opportunity to be heard is
fundamental, and any deviation from these requirements deprives a party of
their constitutional rights (Target Logistics, Inc. v. Office of the Attorney
Gen. of Tex., 465 S.W.3d 768 (Tex. App. 2015)).
3. Unauthorized Practice of Law: Torres v. Unauthorized Practice of
Law Comm.
The Torres case confirms that only licensed attorneys may represent others
in Texas courts. Non-lawyers who attempt to represent parties in litigation
are engaging in the unauthorized practice of law (UPL), which is subject to
civil enforcement and, in some cases, criminal penalties. The Unauthorized
Practice of Law Committee (UPLC) is empowered to seek injunctions against
UPL without meeting traditional requirements for injunctive relief. The case
also notes that due process complaints regarding notice must be preserved
by timely objection, but a complete lack of notice or deprivation of the right
to respond can preserve error for appeal (Torres v. Unauthorized Practice of
Law Comm. For Supreme Court of Tex., 05-21-00651-CV (Tex. App. Sep 09,
2022)).
Analysis
1. Due Process Violations
A. Lack of Notice and Opportunity to Be Heard
The scenario describes a situation where an attorney fails to respond in
writing to an emergency motion containing allegations against her client,
then appears at a hearing and presents new temporary orders, effectively
ambushing the opposing party. Texas law, both statutory and case law, is
clear that due process requires notice and an opportunity to be heard before
any adverse action is taken in family law proceedings. Section 105.001 of
the Family Code mandates notice and a hearing for temporary orders, with
only narrow exceptions for emergency ex parte relief sought by
governmental entities. The appellate courts have repeatedly held that orders
issued without proper notice and service are constitutionally infirm and
violate due process (Target Logistics, Inc. v. Office of the Attorney Gen. of
Tex., 465 S.W.3d 768 (Tex. App. 2015); In re Sproul, 04-24-00202-CV (Tex.
App. Jun 20, 2024)).
In In re Sproul, the court found that failure to serve the respondent with
notice and citation deprived the court of jurisdiction and made any relief
improper. Similarly, in Target Logistics, the lack of timely notice and
opportunity to be heard was deemed a violation of fundamental due process.
The described conduct—failing to respond in writing, then seeking relief at a
hearing without proper notice—directly contravenes these requirements.
B. Jurisdictional Defects: Associate Judge Without Referral
The authority of an associate judge to hear and decide cases is strictly
limited by statute. Section 201.006 of the Family Code requires a valid order

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
of referral from the referring court. Without such an order, the associate
judge has no jurisdiction to act, and any orders issued are void. The Target
Logistics case is directly on point, holding that orders rendered by an
associate judge without a referral order are void for lack of jurisdiction. This
is not a mere technicality; it is a fundamental safeguard to ensure that only
properly authorized judicial officers exercise the power of the court (Tex.
Fam. Code § 201.006; Target Logistics, Inc. v. Office of the Attorney Gen. of
Tex., 465 S.W.3d 768 (Tex. App. 2015)).
C. Unauthorized Practice of Law
If the attorney in question was not authorized to represent her client—either
because she was not licensed or otherwise lacked authority—her actions
may constitute the unauthorized practice of law (UPL). The Torres case
confirms that only licensed attorneys may represent others in Texas courts,
and that UPL is subject to civil enforcement and, in some cases, criminal
penalties. The UPLC is empowered to seek injunctions against UPL, and the
Texas Government Code prohibits non-lawyers from representing others in
litigation. If the attorney was not licensed or otherwise unauthorized, her
actions could be subject to disciplinary action, civil injunction, and
potentially criminal prosecution if the conduct was willful (Torres v.
Unauthorized Practice of Law Comm. For Supreme Court of Tex.,
05-21-00651-CV (Tex. App. Sep 09, 2022)).
2. Potential Criminality
While the described conduct is a serious violation of due process and may
render the resulting orders void, not every due process violation is criminal.
Criminal liability would generally require proof of willful misconduct, such
as knowingly practicing law without a license or engaging in fraud on the
court. The Torres case indicates that UPL can be subject to criminal
penalties, but the primary remedy is civil enforcement by the UPLC. If the
attorney knowingly misrepresented her status or engaged in fraudulent
conduct, criminal charges could be pursued, but this would require
additional evidence beyond the procedural violations described.
3. Consequences of Due Process and Jurisdictional
Violations
The most immediate legal consequence of the described conduct is that any
orders issued by the associate judge without a valid referral order, or
without proper notice and hearing, are void or voidable. Parties affected by
such orders may seek to have them set aside on appeal or by collateral
attack. The courts have consistently held that judgments entered without
jurisdiction or in violation of due process are constitutionally infirm and
cannot stand (Target Logistics, Inc. v. Office of the Attorney Gen. of Tex., 465
S.W.3d 768 (Tex. App. 2015); In re Sproul, 04-24-00202-CV (Tex. App. Jun
20, 2024)).
In addition, attorneys who engage in such conduct may be subject to
disciplinary action by the State Bar of Texas for violating ethical rules,
including the duty of candor to the tribunal and the obligation to respect the

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
rights of opposing parties. If the attorney was not authorized to practice law,
she may also face civil injunctions and, in egregious cases, criminal
prosecution for UPL.
4. Preservation of Error and Waiver
The Torres case also addresses the importance of preserving due process
complaints regarding notice. If a party is aware of a hearing and fails to
object to insufficient notice, the issue may be waived. However, if there was
a complete lack of notice or the party was deprived of the right to respond,
error may be preserved for appeal. In the scenario described, if the father
was truly blindsided and had no meaningful opportunity to respond, the due
process violation would likely be preserved for appellate review (Torres v.
Unauthorized Practice of Law Comm. For Supreme Court of Tex.,
05-21-00651-CV (Tex. App. Sep 09, 2022)).
Exceptions and Caveats
There are limited exceptions to the notice and hearing requirements for
temporary orders, primarily in cases involving emergency relief sought by
governmental entities under Chapter 262 of the Family Code. However,
these exceptions do not apply to private parties in standard family law
disputes. Additionally, if the party affected by the orders had actual notice
and an opportunity to be heard but failed to object, some due process
arguments may be waived. The facts as described suggest a lack of
meaningful notice and opportunity to respond, making waiver unlikely.
Criminal liability for unauthorized practice of law or fraud on the court
requires proof of intent and knowledge. Mere procedural errors or
negligence, without more, are unlikely to result in criminal prosecution. The
primary remedies are civil—voiding the orders, disciplinary action, and
injunctions against UPL.
Conclusion
The actions described—failure to respond to an emergency motion,
ambushing the opposing party at a hearing, securing orders from an
associate judge without a valid referral, and possible unauthorized
representation—constitute serious violations of due process and
jurisdictional requirements under Texas law. Orders issued under these
circumstances are void or voidable, and the affected party has strong
grounds to challenge them. While such conduct may also expose the
attorney to disciplinary action and, in cases of willful unauthorized practice,
criminal penalties, not every due process violation is criminal. The most
immediate and significant consequence is the invalidity of the orders and the
undermining of the integrity of the judicial process. The authorities make
clear that strict adherence to procedural safeguards is essential to protect
the rights of all parties in family law proceedings.

In re Sproul, 04-24-00202-CV (Tex. App. Jun 20, 2024)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Because Mother's motion to compel references the 2023 Order as a prelude
to requesting relief, it could be seen as a motion to enforce under Chapter
157 of the Texas Family Code or a motion to modify under Chapter 156 of
the Family Code. However, there are problems with both approaches that
preclude the relief awarded by the trial court... A motion for enforcement
must, in ordinary and concise language identify the provision of the order
sought to be enforced and state the manner of the alleged noncompliance...
It is undisputed that Mother's motion does not contain the required
allegations to constitute a motion for enforcement... Additionally, Mother
failed to comply with the notice and service provision of Chapter 157, which
requires 'personal service of a copy of the motion and notice not later than
the 10th day before the date of the hearing.'... Because Mother failed to
have Father served personally, and because Mother's motion contained no
allegations that Father failed to comply with the 2023 Order, it would be an
abuse of discretion to award relief under Chapter 157... For the same
reason, it would have been error for the trial court to have awarded relief to
Mother if her motion were viewed as a motion to modify under Chapter
156... It is undisputed that Mother did not serve Father with notice and
citation as required under the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. Accordingly, it
would have been error for the trial court to grant relief to Mother when it
did not have jurisdiction over Father... 'Put simply, a case is moot when the
court's action on the merits cannot affect the parties' rights or interests.' ...
Given Mother's pending claim for fees, Father's challenge to the trial court's
jurisdiction can still affect the parties' rights and interests. Accordingly, a
justiciable controversy exists.
Summary
The appellate court held that awarding relief without proper pleadings and
without personal service/notice is error and an abuse of discretion. Under
Chapter 157, enforcement requires specific allegations and 10-day personal
service; under Chapter 156, modification requires citation and service per
TRCP. Failure to serve deprives the court of jurisdiction over the respondent,
making relief improper. This directly implicates due process (notice and
opportunity to be heard). The case also notes that pending fee claims can
keep controversies live. While the passages do not address criminality,
unauthorized representation or lack of an order of referral to an associate
judge would further undermine jurisdiction/authority, consistent with due-
process violations.

Extract
In addition to the arguments made by the UPLC, the trial court had before it
evidence that Torres was not a licensed attorney in the state of Texas, and
that she filed motions and other requests for relief on behalf of the HR
Entities in the Underlying Suit. The summary judgment evidence further
showed that Torres stated her intention to continue to represent the HR
Entities in the Underlying Suit despite being informed she could not legally
do so. See Rodriguez v. Marcus, 484 S.W.3d 656, 657 (Tex. App.-El Paso
2016, no pet.) (a non-lawyer may not represent another party in litigation
and corporation may not appear through officers that are not attorneys).
Except in limited circumstances not applicable here, a person may not
practice law in the state of Texas unless the person is a member of the state
bar." ... "Section 81.104 of the Texas Government Code authorizes the UPLC
to 'seek the elimination of the unauthorized practice of law by appropriate
actions and methods, including the filing of suits in the name of the
committee.' ... The statute's express authorization of the committee to
eliminate the unauthorized practice law through legal action supersedes the
common law requirements for injunctive relief such as imminent harm and
irreparable injury." ... "A party who complains of less than twenty-one days'
notice of a summary judgment hearing, but admits to knowing of the hearing
date before it occurs, waives the defense of insufficient notice if the issue is
not brought to the trial court's attention at or before the scheduled hearing
or submission date. ... The party may preserve error in a post-trial motion
only when they are not given notice of the summary judgment hearing or
they are deprived of their right to seek leave to file additional affidavits or
other written response.
Summary
The case confirms that non-lawyers cannot represent others in Texas courts;
doing so is unauthorized practice of law. The UPLC can bring suits to stop
UPL without meeting traditional injunction standards. The notice/waiver
passage addresses preservation of due-process complaints in summary
judgment—if a party knew of a hearing and didn’t timely object, notice
defects can be waived; lack of any notice or deprivation of ability to respond
can preserve error. While the facts here involve family-law emergency
motions and an associate judge referral issue, the passages provide relevant
principles on UPL and on how due-process/notice objections must be
preserved.
Target Logistics, Inc. v. Office of the Attorney Gen. of Tex., 465 S.W.3d 768
(Tex. App. 2015)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Target presents two issues on appeal. In Issue One, Target asserts the
associate judge lacked jurisdiction to render the default order due to the

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
lack of a referral order from the district court to the associate judge in this
cause pursuant to Texas Family Code section 201.006. In Issue Two, Target
contends its due process rights have been violated because the associate
judge and trial court entered a default order in contravention of Texas
Family Code section 157.062(c). Section 157.062(c) mandates that a hearing
'for enforcement of an existing order providing for child support ... shall be
given to the respondent ... not later than the 10th day before the date of the
hearing.' ... The lack of notice violates 'the most rudimentary demands of
due process of law.' ... 'a judgment entered without notice or service is
constitutionally infirm,' and violates due process. ... '[A]n elementary and
fundamental requirement of due process in any proceeding which is to be
accorded finality is notice reasonably calculated, under all the
circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the
action ...' ... 'trial court's failure to comply with the rules of notice in a
contested case deprives a party of the constitutional right to be present at
the hearing, to voice [her] objections in an appropriate manner, and results
in a violation of fundamental due process.'
Summary
The case supports two key points relevant to the question: (a) an associate
judge lacks authority to render orders without a proper referral under Tex.
Fam. Code §201.006; orders entered without such referral are void for lack
of jurisdiction. (b) Entering orders without statutorily adequate notice
violates due process; lack of timely notice and opportunity to be heard
renders the judgment constitutionally infirm. The passages do not address
criminality or attorney authorization directly, but they squarely support due
process and jurisdictional defects.
Tex. Fam. Code § 201.006 Tex. Fam. Code § 201.006 Order of Referral
Extract
In referring a case to an associate judge, the judge of the referring court
shall render: an individual order of referral; or a general order of referral
specifying the class and type of cases to be heard by the associate judge.
The order of referral may limit the power or duties of an associate judge.
Summary
Section 201.006 mandates that a referring court must issue either an
individual or general order of referral to empower an associate judge to hear
a case. Without such an order, an associate judge’s authority is not properly
vested, and any actions taken may be void or voidable for lack of
jurisdiction/authority. The statute applies broadly to all associate judge
proceedings in family cases and allows limitations on an associate judge’s
powers via the referral order.

Tex. Fam. Code § 105.001 Tex. Fam. Code § 105.001 Temporary Orders
Before Final Order
Extract
In a suit, the court may make a temporary order... Except as provided by
Subsection (c), temporary restraining orders and temporary injunctions
under this section shall be granted without the necessity of an affidavit or
verified pleading... Except as provided by Subsection (h), an order may not
be rendered under Subsection (a)... except after notice and a hearing." ...
"Except on a verified pleading or an affidavit... an order may not be
rendered: attaching the body of the child; taking the child into the
possession of the court...; or excluding a parent from possession of or access
to a child." ... "An order under Subsection (a) may be rendered without
notice and an adversary hearing if the order is an emergency order sought
by a governmental entity under Chapter 262.
Summary
Section 105.001 authorizes temporary orders but conditions most such relief
on notice and a hearing. It also restricts certain severe remedies (e.g.,
excluding a parent from possession/access) unless supported by a verified
pleading or affidavit. Ex parte orders without notice are permitted only in
limited contexts and, for emergency orders without notice, only when sought
by a governmental entity under Chapter 262. Thus, a court denying an
emergency motion and issuing temporary relief without proper notice,
hearing, or verification for relief that affects possession/access would
contravene §105.001’s procedural protections. However, §105.001 does not
address associate judge referral requirements or attorney authorization/
appearance issues, nor criminality.
