Question
Answer Short response The factual allegations, if proven, describe a
coordinated and ongoing scheme involving multiple individuals who engaged
in repeated acts of wire fraud, mail fraud, document tampering, and judicial
manipulation, all directed at depriving the plaintiff of business and property
interests and affecting interstate commerce—thus meeting the elements
required to establish a civil RICO claim. The continuity, relatedness, and
enterprise structure alleged are sufficient to plead a pattern of racketeering
activity under federal law. Summary To establish a RICO claim, a plaintiff
must show (1) a person engaged in (2) a pattern of racketeering activity (3)
connected to the conduct of an enterprise, and (4) injury to business or
property as a result. The allegations here detail a series of predicate acts—
including interstate wire transfers, fraudulent court filings, perjury,
extortion, and ongoing threats—committed by a group acting in concert over
an extended period, with the purpose and effect of depriving the plaintiff of
his home, business, and property interests. The facts allege that the
defendants, including attorneys, court staff, and private individuals, formed
an association-in-fact enterprise that repeatedly used the courts and
interstate communications to further their scheme. The acts described—
such as fraudulent wire transfers, preparation and filing of false legal
documents, tampering with court records, and coordinated judicial actions—
are classic RICO predicate acts, and their continuity and relatedness
support the existence of a RICO pattern. The resulting harm to the plaintiff’s
business and property, as well as the impact on interstate commerce, satisfy
the injury and nexus requirements for a civil RICO claim. Background and
Relevant Law Legislative and Regulatory Framework The Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), codified at 18 U.S.C. §§
1961–1964, provides a civil cause of action for any person injured in their
business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962. Section 1962
prohibits any person from conducting or participating in the conduct of an
enterprise’s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity, where the
enterprise’s activities affect interstate or foreign commerce. The statute
defines “racketeering activity” to include a wide range of criminal acts,
notably mail fraud, wire fraud, extortion, and obstruction of justice, among
others. A “pattern” requires at least two predicate acts within ten years, but
the Supreme Court has clarified that a pattern also requires “continuity plus
relationship”—that is, the acts must be related and pose a threat of
continued criminal activity (18 U.S.C. §§ 1961–1962; H.J. Inc. v. Northwest
Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229 (1989)). Case Law The Fifth Circuit and district
courts within Texas have consistently held that a civil RICO claim requires:
(1) a person, (2) who engages in a pattern of racketeering activity, (3)
connected to the conduct of an enterprise, and (4) injury to business or
property as a result (Moore v. Town N. Auto., Inc., Civil Action No. 3:14-
CV-1215-D (N.D. Tex. Jul 11, 2014); Cedra Pharmacy Houston, LLC v.
UnitedHealth Grp., Inc., CIVIL ACTION NO. H-17-3800 (S.D. Tex. Mar 07,
2019); Delta Truck & Tractor, Inc. v. J.I. Case Co., 855 F.2d 241 (5th Cir.
1988)). The “enterprise” can be any group of individuals associated in fact,
even if not a legal entity (RICO: A Primer (2022-01-31)). Predicate acts must
be related and demonstrate continuity, either as a closed period of repeated

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
conduct or as ongoing conduct that threatens future repetition (Megatel
Homes, LLC v. Moayedi, Civil Action 3:20-CV-00688-L (N.D. Tex. Nov 16,
2021)). For a RICO conspiracy claim under § 1962(d), it must be shown that
two or more people agreed to commit a substantive RICO offense and that
the defendant knew of and agreed to the overall objective (Chaney v.
Dreyfus Service Corp., 595 F.3d 219 (5th Cir. 2010)). Analysis 1. The
“Enterprise” Element The allegations describe a group consisting of private
individuals (Myers, Branthoover), attorneys (Carter, Marx), court staff
(Baker), and judges (Munford, Kaitcer) who, while perhaps not all acting
with criminal intent, are alleged to have collectively furthered a scheme to
secure a divorce decree and deprive the plaintiff of his business and
property. This group, acting in concert over months and years, constitutes
an “association-in-fact” enterprise under RICO, as courts interpret the term
broadly to include any union or group of individuals associated for a
common purpose (RICO: A Primer (2022-01-31); Moore v. Town N. Auto.,
Inc., Civil Action No. 3:14-CV-1215-D (N.D. Tex. Jul 11, 2014)). 2. Pattern of
Racketeering Activity A “pattern” requires at least two predicate acts, but
more importantly, the acts must be related and demonstrate continuity. The
facts here allege a series of acts over at least 20 months, including: Wire
Fraud: The transfer of $1,576 from the marital account to a co-conspirator’s
PayPal account across state lines, with the intent to deprive the plaintiff of
business and household funds, is a classic predicate act of wire fraud. The
use of interstate wires and the intent to defraud are both present (18 U.S.C.
§ 1343; Tujague v. Eckerd, Civil Action No. 4:18-CV-00408 (E.D. Tex. Jul 11,
2018)). Mail Fraud: The preparation and filing of fraudulent court
documents, including divorce petitions, affidavits of indigency, and
protective order applications containing false statements, and their service
via official channels, constitute mail fraud if the mails were used in
furtherance of the scheme (18 U.S.C. § 1341). Obstruction of Justice/
Document Tampering: The allegations of court staff and judges altering,
withholding, or tampering with court filings, and the failure to follow recusal
procedures, may constitute obstruction of justice or other predicate acts
under RICO (18 U.S.C. § 1503). Extortion and Intimidation: Ongoing threats
and intimidation by Branthoover, including explicit threats of retaliation for
seeking legal relief, are alleged as predicate acts of extortion and
obstruction. Unauthorized Practice of Law: The repeated filing of pleadings
by a non-party (Marx) on behalf of Carter, and the assertion of legal
representation by non-attorneys, further the pattern of racketeering activity.
Perjury and Subornation of Perjury: The filing of affidavits and court
documents containing knowingly false statements, such as misrepresenting
cohabitation status and financial condition, are predicate acts. These acts
are not isolated; they are related by their common purpose (to deprive the
plaintiff of property and business interests and secure a favorable divorce
decree for Myers) and method (use of the courts, fraudulent filings, and
interstate communications). The acts occurred over an extended period,
with ongoing threats and judicial manipulation continuing into 2025,
satisfying both the “relationship” and “continuity” requirements for a RICO
pattern (H.J. Inc. v. Northwest Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229 (1989); Megatel
Homes, LLC v. Moayedi, Civil Action 3:20-CV-00688-L (N.D. Tex. Nov 16,
2021)). 3. Connection to the Conduct of the Enterprise The facts allege that
the enterprise’s affairs were conducted through these predicate acts. The
group coordinated to prepare and file fraudulent documents, manipulate

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
court procedures, and use official processes (such as constable service and
court orders) to further their scheme. The involvement of court staff and
judges in facilitating or failing to prevent these acts, and the repeated use of
the legal system to effectuate the deprivation of property, demonstrate the
necessary connection to the conduct of the enterprise’s affairs (Moore v.
Town N. Auto., Inc., Civil Action No. 3:14-CV-1215-D (N.D. Tex. Jul 11,
2014)). 4. Injury to Business or Property The plaintiff alleges concrete
injury: loss of access to his home and business, depletion of business funds,
inability to serve interstate clients, and loss of property interests. These are
precisely the types of injuries compensable under RICO (Cedra Pharmacy
Houston, LLC v. UnitedHealth Grp., Inc., CIVIL ACTION NO. H-17-3800
(S.D. Tex. Mar 07, 2019)). The acts described were the proximate cause of
these injuries, as the fraudulent filings and court orders directly resulted in
the plaintiff’s dispossession and business harm (Megatel Homes, LLC v.
Moayedi, Civil Action 3:20-CV-00688-L (N.D. Tex. Nov 16, 2021)). 5. Nexus
with Interstate Commerce RICO requires that the enterprise’s activities
affect interstate or foreign commerce. The facts allege interstate wire
transfers, communications between Texas and Oklahoma, and interference
with the plaintiff’s ability to serve clients in multiple states and Canada. This
satisfies the minimal nexus required (Trevino v. Pechero, 592 F.Supp.2d 939
(S.D. Tex. 2008)). 6. RICO Conspiracy The facts also support a RICO
conspiracy claim under § 1962(d), as they allege an agreement among two
or more individuals to commit the substantive RICO offenses, with
knowledge and intent to further the scheme. The repeated coordination,
mutual benefit, and ongoing communications among the participants are
sufficient to plead an agreement (Chaney v. Dreyfus Service Corp., 595 F.3d
219 (5th Cir. 2010)). Exceptions and Caveats Pleading Particularity: RICO
claims based on fraud (mail or wire) must be pleaded with particularity
under Rule 9(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (Civil Rico: A Tool of
Advocacy (2024-01-01)). The facts here are detailed and specify dates,
participants, and acts, which should satisfy this requirement if properly
pleaded. Judicial Immunity: Judges and court staff may assert immunity for
acts taken in their judicial capacity. However, if the allegations are that they
participated in or facilitated criminal acts outside their judicial function,
immunity may not apply. This is a complex area and may limit the scope of
relief against certain defendants. Causation and Standing: The plaintiff must
show that the RICO violation was the proximate cause of the injury. The
facts allege a direct link between the predicate acts and the harm suffered,
but this is a fact-intensive inquiry. Scope of Predicate Acts: Not all alleged
misconduct may qualify as a RICO predicate act. For example, mere delay or
incompetence in legal representation, absent fraud or criminal intent, may
not suffice. Conclusion The factual allegations, if proven, are sufficient to
establish the elements of a civil RICO claim: a group of individuals and
officials formed an enterprise that engaged in a pattern of racketeering
activity—including wire fraud, mail fraud, document tampering, perjury, and
extortion—over an extended period, with the purpose and effect of depriving
the plaintiff of business and property interests and affecting interstate
commerce. The acts are related, continuous, and caused concrete injury,
satisfying the requirements set forth by federal law and the Fifth Circuit.
The allegations also support a RICO conspiracy claim, as they describe an
agreement among the participants to further the unlawful scheme. The case
thus presents a viable RICO claim, subject to the caveats regarding pleading

standards, judicial immunity, and proof of causation. TIMELINE OF EVENTS
“Myers” Defendant Morgan Michelle Myers “Branthoover” Defendant Daniel
Kenneth Branthover “Carter” Defendant Cooper L. Carter “Baker”
Defendant Lindsey K. Baker in her official capacity as Court Coordinator
“Munford” Defendant James B. Munford in his official capacity as District
Judge “Kaitcer” Defendant Jeffrey N. Kaitcer in his individual capacity as
Associate Judge A. The Myers-Branthoover Enterprise 1. On December 14,
2023, Defendants Morgan Michelle Myers and Daniel Kenneth Branthoover
began communicating by text message, exceeding 90 messages on
December 14, 2023. The following day, they reached a meeting of the minds
in Yukon, Oklahoma, during the weekend of December 15, 2023. REC.
274-278. Defendant Branthoover’s deceptive message, in which he falsely
represented that he wished to assist Plaintiff, was sent immediately after
Myers sought, unsuccessfully, to obtain an ex parte order of protection from
the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County on December 14, 2023. REC. 78
B. Predicate Acts: Wire Fraud and Travel Act Violation 2. Both defendants
planned and agreed to meet for the purpose of drafting an original petition
for divorce and affidavit of indigency to be later submitted to the 322nd
District Court of Tarrant County with the common purpose of having Plaintiff
removed from his matrimonial residence located at 6641 Anne Court,
Watauga, Texas 76148, which also serves as his place of business, serving
clients across the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. 3. During
defendant Myers’ interstate travel, she emptied the marital bank account
into defendant Branthoover’s PayPal account, amounting to $1,576. REC.
723. These proceeds were used to purchase a second phone, registered
under 817-940-0852. This phone number was used on the fraudulent
pleadings prepared during defendant Myers’ stay in Oklahoma, which she
transported from Yukon, Oklahoma back to Texas on December 17, 2023. C.
Admissions 4. On December 16, 2023, Plaintiff reached out to defendant
Branthoover and requested that the $1,576 be returned as they were needed
for Christmas gifts for the children, and for business advertising expenses
for his business. REC. 728-729. In response, defendant Branthoover
admitted that the purpose of defendant Myers’ visit was to help her prepare
paperwork for divorce litigation and confirmed that the transfer of $1,576
did in fact occur. REC. 730. D. Post-submission Collaboration 5. On
December 18, 2023, defendant Myers submitted the fraudulently prepared
original petition for divorce, and an affidavit of indigency to the 322nd
District Court of Tarrant County. After these documents were submitted,
defendant Branthoover sent a text message to Plaintiff on December 19,
2023, holding himself out to be defendant Myers’ attorney, showing his
involvement extends past the initial help in preparing the documents. REC.
1712-1713 6. Four days later, on December 22, 2023, defendant Myers
submitted another knowingly fraudulent application for protective to the
322nd District Court of Tarrant County. E. Significant and Intentional
Misrepresentations 7. On December 27 and December 28, 2023,
respectively, these documents were served on Plaintiff via the U.S.
Constable, and contained the following misrepresentations: i. That
defendant Myers could not afford court costs; REC. 72, REC. 85-96 ii. That
defendant Myers had an active order of protection against the Plaintiff with
a finding of family violence that had occurred during the marriage; REC. 78
at 10 iii. That defendant Myers was financially responsible for the family
vehicles, rent payments, utilities, and other household expenses, making

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
herself appear as the primary breadwinner; REC. 92 iv. That defendant
Myers would be harassed or abused if Plaintiff were given her newly
acquired phone number that was obtained while in Oklahoma; REC. 81 at
15. v. That defendant Myers and Plaintiff ceased living together on
December 1, 2023; REC. 74 at 4 vi. That family violence occurred on
December 18, 2023, in the presence of the two Children. REC. 108-109. vii.
That both family vehicles were defendant Myers’ separate property acquired
before marriage. REC. 79 at 11B F. Evidence to the Contrary 8. On the same
day Defendant Myers claimed to be in an emergency requiring the Plaintiff’s
prompt removal from the home, she can be seen at the home with Plaintiff
and the children in no state of emergency and also still cohabitating in the
marital home. REC 1715. 9. Again, on December 29, 2023, Defendant Myers
can be seen with Plaintiff at the family home, smiling and laughing with the
children in no state of emergency and still collaborating with Plaintiff in the
marital home. REC. 1735. 10. The citation for the application for protective
order ordered Respondent to show cause as to why it should not issue with a
hearing scheduled for January 16, 2024. REC. 118. 11. In response to
extensive misrepresentation above, Plaintiff prepared an original answer,
filed a motion to consolidate, and provided background information which
alleged that defendant Myers was intentionally abusing the legal process.
REC. 130-132. G. Inclement Weather and First Appearance 12. On January
15, 2024, the Tarrant County District Courts Facebook page sent out a
notice informing the members of the public that the court would be closed
on January 16, 2024, due to inclement weather. REC. 1202. 13. Unaware of
the closure at the time, the parties appeared at the 322nd District Court of
Tarrant County on January 16, 2024, and were met with a dark courtroom,
with only one judge in the building at the time of their arrival – defendant
James Munford. 14. Defendant Munford summarily ordered the Plaintiff out
of his home, inadvertently assisting the Myers-Branthoover associate-in-fact
enterprise of achieving their primary goal in having the Plaintiff removed
from his residence, despite the broader goal being to obtain a decree of
divorce to permanently divest Plaintiff of his interests. REC. 183. 15.
Defendant Munford’s initial order was baseless, made in the absence of any
emergency, without a hearing, and disregarded the Plaintiff’s pleadings,
telling the mother “you’re going to have to find evidence of family violence!”
clearly aware that this order was made without any regard to the Plaintiff’s
constitutional rights. 16. Defendant Kaitcer walked into the courtroom late
due to the inclement weather, and turned the courtroom into a laughing
matter as he began to joke with Defendant Munford, and instructed the
parties to download the AppClose app, and the matter was reset for January
22, 2024. H. Reset #1 – January 22, 2024 Setting 17. At the January 22 reset
hearing, the parties appeared only to have the case reset once more because
defendant Myers allegedly retained the services of Defendant Cooper Carter
in the lobby of the courthouse just moments before the hearing was
scheduled to begin. No appearance can be traced to this setting by either
party on the docket (REC. 1551), and once again, no hearing was held, and
the case reset for a second time to February 1, 2024. REC. 186. 18.
Defendant Kaitcer permitted attorney Dan Bacalis, Plaintiff’s prior attorney,
to fill out the Associate Judge’s Report, and the parties never went before
him as indicated by the case docket’s lack of appearance on this date by
either party. I. Reset #2 – February 1, 2024 Setting 19. One day prior to the
February 1 setting, both attorneys, Defendant Carter and Dan Bacalis, both

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
amended the petition for divorce and counterpetition for divorce without the
parties’ knowledge. (REC. 189, REC. 209) These amended documents were
similar, submitted on the same day, and raised concerns for Plaintiff
regarding his representation. 20. At the February 1 setting, both parties
were in the conference rooms outside of Defendant Kaitcer’s courtroom,
when attorney Bacalis walks in holding a settlement agreement. When
Plaintiff refused this option, and requested that they go have a hearing
before the judge. 21. This is when Bacalis stated, as witness affidavits
corroborate, that he “knows this Judge and this is the best we can get.” and
further stated “[w]e’ll be here all day. We can come back and change it
later.” 22. Outraged by this response, Plaintiff paid very close attention to
the settlement offer Bacalis was pressuring him to sign, and noticed the
following provisions: A typed written Order conforming to this Report will
follow within 20 days from the date this Report is signed. The Temporary
Order shall be prepared by DAN BACALIS. Each attorney should approve
the Order. The parties do not need to approve the Order. The attorney
reviewing the proposed Order shall have five (5) days to do so. There arc no
ten (JO) day letters. If an agreement is not reached, a Motion to Sign shall
be filed and set within thirty (30) days from the signing of this Report. IT IS
SO ORDERED (REC. 233) J. Termination of Counsel and the Emergency
Motion 23. With these provisions in mind, Plaintiff signed the document, and
immediately fired his attorney and provided notice to the court. By doing so,
he gained access back to the residency, invalidate the agreement, and was
able to use the time back in the house to run damage control on his business
operations while preparing to expose the Myers-Branthoover enterprise to
the court via a MOTION TO RECONSIDER EVIDENCE AND VACATE
TEMPORARY ORDERS, which was filed on February 9, 2024, within three
business days of the February 1 agreed associate judge’s report being
served by the clerk. REC. 240 24. In this motion, it was specifically stated
that: i. “I am seeking immediate court intervention to correct procedural e
rrors and address the misuse of the legal system by the Petitioner.” REC.
244 ii. “Particularly, Dan Branthoover became involved. He is the boyfriend
of the Petitioner’s Mother. Shortly thereafter, I received a notice from our
joint bank account stating that $1,576 had just been withdrawn. As our bank
statement for December 2023 will demonstrate – the transaction record
shows the funds being transferred directly to Mr. Branthoover’s PayPal
account” REC. 245 iii. “The Petitioner's action of filing for divorce under an
Affidavit of Inability to pay three days after transferring $1,576 to herself
starkly contravenes the mandates set forth in Chapter 10, Section 10.001 of
the Civil Practice and Remedies Code”. REC 247 at B2 iv. “The Petitioner
violated Chapter 10, Section 10.001 a second time within the same
document when she intentionally elected to waive the 60-day waiting period
claiming to have an active protective order against me that found family
violence had occurred during our marriage.” REC 247 at B3. v. “This suit
was the second attempt by the Petitioner to have me removed from the
home, which ultimately succeeded.” REC 248 at D1 25. The motion went on
to explain the factual pattern described herein, putting the court on notice
of the key issues with provided exhibits that were served to Defendant
Carter. In response to Plaintiff’s motion, he received the first of just two
email communications from Carter throughout the case’s history, where she
claimed she would be filing a counter motion when disclosing her availability
for the hearing. REC. 2794 No such countermotion was filed by Carter. J.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary Judgment and Notice of Hearing 26. By February 22, no response
had been filed by Carter, so Plaintiff filed a Partial Motion for Summary
Judgment. REC. 758. Plaintiff also submitted a proposed parenting plan as
Exhibit D. REC. 769. No response was ever received from Carter. 27. On
February 27, 2024, Defendant Munford signed and issued a notice of
hearing to the parties with the hearing set for March 14, 2024. REC. 776. K.
Plaintiff’s Notice to the Court and Defendant Myers’ Self-Help Remedies 28.
On March 3, 2024, Plaintiff notified the Court that he would not be leaving
the home as it was not in the best interests of his children. REC. 782. 29.
The following day, on March 6, 2024, while walking his daughters to school,
Myers ran inside the family home, and locked him out of the marital
residence, leaving a sign on the door that said “[y]ou should have been out
by Saturday you are now locked out!” REC. 1748. 30. Plaintiff called local
law enforcement to help him regain entry into the home, where mother
produced the agreed associate judge’s report signed on February 1, 2024,
and used it as a means to block Plaintiff’s entrance to the home. 31. To avoid
further conflict, Plaintiff was escorted into the home where he was able to
grab only his computer and a few clothes, and went to Flower Mound to
temporarily stay with his father until the hearing on his emergency motion.
L. The Hearing On Plaintiff’s Emergency Motion 32. On March 14, 2024, the
parties arrived at the 322nd District Court, and on the way into the
courtroom, defendants Myers and Carter could be seen in the conference
room, quickly shuffling papers back and forth. 33. After checking in with the
bailiff, Plaintiff turned around to see defendant Carter extending him a
document titled “Temporary Orders” that were the reduced version of the
February 1 associate judge’s report. REC. 888. 34. These orders, which were
not prepared by Dan Bacalis, which were not agreed to by the parties, which
were reduced well outside of the 20-day requirement as ordered by the
judge, and which were never filed with the clerk, stated the following
misrepresentations: i. On February 1, 2024, the Court heard Petitioner's
motion for temporary orders. ii. The parties have agreed to the terms of this
order as evidenced by the signatures below. REC. 888. iii. The Court, after
examining the record and the agreement of the parties and hearing the
evidence and argument of counsel, finds that all necessary prerequisites of
the law have been legally satisfied and that the Court has jurisdiction of this
case and of all the parties. REC. 888. iv. The dates that the parties would
have access to the family residence was altered, changing the date Plaintiff
was supposed to leave from March 1, 2024, to March 20, 2024, and
changing Myers’ date of re-entry from March 1, 2024, to March 30, 2024. v.
This modification was made to prevent Myers from being liable for illegally
locking Plaintiff out of the home on March 6, 2024. 35. On the last page of
the orders, Plaintiff’s attorney who was terminated weeks earlier did not
sign the document. Plaintiff refused to sign the document for the
forthcoming reasons: i. It claimed a hearing occurred on a motion which was
never set for a hearing or served on the Plaintiff and doesn’t exist on the
docket. ii. It was prepared by defendant Carter, not Dan Bacalis. iii. The
associate judge was presiding over a de novo request of his own prior
report. iv. The matrimonial address was incorrect, as it stated “6641 Anns
Court”, rather than 6641 Anne Court. REC. 915, REC. 922 v. The orders
were not in the best interests of the children. vi. Notwithstanding the
Plaintiff’s revocation of consent by filing the emergency motion, the terms
were altered right before they were rendered into effect by defendant

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Kaitcer. M. Predicate Acts: Extortion 36. Defendant Kaitcer, knowing that no
response was filed, knowing that he was presiding over a hearing to which
he had no subject matter jurisdiction, and knowing that the temporary order
produced by defendant Carter contained false misrepresentations, signed
another associate judge’s report pre-drafted by defendant Carter, which
summarily denied the Plaintiff’s emergency motion, ignored the fact that
Carter had not provided a response, and within the report itself, Plaintiff
was ordered to sign the document despite raising objections to its’ contents,
and despite his consent not being present. REC. 795. 37. Finally, defendant
Kaitcer refused to consider Plaintiff’s exhibits, including six affidavits
prepared by his business clients who have been directly affected by his
inability to provide the real-time market data services his clients relied on,
who were located throughout the United States. 38. Following the hearing,
the orders were rendered into effect without Plaintiff’s signature (REC.
925) , and Plaintiff filed a request for findings of fact and conclusions of law
(REC. 883), and filed and amended a “Preparatory Notice for Judicial
Review” which recounted the factual timeline up to that point, and included
the affidavits that Kaitcer refused to accept on March 14, 2024. REC. 798,
REC. 851, REC. 854, REC. 857, REC. 860, REC. 863, REC. 867, REC. 870.
39. The orders stated they were to remain in effect until the final decree of
divorce, and Plaintiff’s journey of one-sided appeals began. N. One Sided
Appellate Efforts, and Defective IWO 40. Following the rendition of the
temporary orders on March 26, 2024, Plaintiff spent between April 8, 2024
and September 15, 2024, appealing via mandamus to the Second Court of
Appeals and the Texas Supreme Court. REC. 1010. 41. During the appellate
efforts, Carter filed one of two motions in the case, which was a motion for
pre-trial conference filed on April 24, 2024, on her behalf by Roderick D.
Marx, a party not named in the suit. REC. 1014, REC. 1016. 42. Plaintiff
immediately objected to the pre-trial conference, and no response was ever
issued by Carter or the court. REC. 1018. 43. On April 30th, Plaintiff filed his
notice of completion regarding the parenting course as ordered, despite
actively trying to vacate them. REC. 1047. No parenting course was ever
completed by Myers. 44. On May 2, 2024, Plaintiff’s en banc reconsideration
was denied in the Second Court of Appeals, and he began preparing an
appeal to the Supreme Court of Texas. REC. 1067. 45. On May 19, 2024,
Carter sent the second and last email correspondence that would be
received in the case, which falsely claimed he agreed to the orders signed
on March 14, 2024, and requested that he fill out an IWO, which Plaintiff
found to be defective. REC. 1722, REC. 1728. No further correspondence
was received by Carter. O. Fraudulent Intervention and Branthoover’s
Continued Involvement 46. On June 23rd Plaintiff filed a motion in state
court entitled MOTION FOR JOINDER OF PERSONS NEEDED FOR JUST
ADJUDICATION at 12:14 P.M. REC. 1075. This motion received no response
from Carter. 47. On June 23rd at 1:54 P.M., directly following the submission
of the motion, Branthoover texted Plaintiff stating “Lol. And here comes
another denial. Please sue me individually. Please.”, referring to the earlier
filed motion and showing his continued oversight of the case’s progression
since his initial predicate acts. 48. Four days later, on June 28, 2024, the
Texas Office of the Attorney General allegedly filed an intervention pleading,
claiming that Plaintiff was past due on child support, and requested
information from Plaintiff. REC. 1099. 49. Most notably, the certificate of
service to this intervention pleading was allegedly signed by Holly Hayes,

the designated attorney for the OAG, yet the name underneath the signature
line reads CHOYA BURKLEY. REC. 1102. 50. Plaintiff promptly objected to
the intervention, and never received any response from the OAG, Carter, or
the court. REC. 1106. P. Supreme Court, Rule 12, and Emergency Temporary
Orders 51. As Plaintiff continued to appeal to the Supreme Court of Texas,
all prosecution came to an end in the trial court. It wasn’t until September
15, 2024, that Plaintiff filed a first amended rehearing motion in the Texas
Supreme Court, (REC. 1136) and after noticing Carter’s lack of
participation, he began to question her authority given several ambiguities
surrounding her representation, and filed a rule 12 motion to show
authority. REC. 1170. No response was ever received to this motion from
Carter. 52. At this point, Plaintiff had been staying in Airbnb homes while he
sought relief to ensure he could remain close to his daughters during this
time. On September 26, 2024, he filed and later amended an EMERGENCY
MOTION FOR TEMPORARY ORDERS and requested expedited relief by
October 1, 2024, as that was when Plaintiff was forced to move away from
the area due to cost of living being unsustainable. REC. 1184. No response
was ever received from Carter regarding this motion. 53. By October 1,
Plaintiff had no choice but to start pursuing administrative remedies, and
thought the court was biased against him given the case’s history up to that
point. He began to prepare a Joint Motion to Recuse defendants Munford
and Kaitcer, and filed it with the clerk of the court on October 7, 2024. Q.
Predicate Act: Wire Fraud 54. On October 8, 2024, Defendant Munford
signed and forwarded a “Joint Motion to Recuse” attached to his order of
referral to regional presiding judge David L. Evans but was notably missing
the exhibits and affidavit critical to the motion. REC. 1222 55. A copy of this
exchange was sent via defendant Baker on 4:43 P.M. on October 8. REC.
1254 56. Plaintiff immediately pointed out the discrepancies between the
motion filed and the motion forwarded to David L. Evans, where she replied
and admitted that the full document had been e-filed and remains with the
court. REC. 1255 57. Unsatisfied with this response, Plaintiff further pointed
out that the filing size of the document filed and the one referring to David
L. Evans was significantly different. No further correspondence was
received by Baker until the following day. REC. 1256 58. The following day
on October 8, 2024, defendant Munford signed and filed an “Amended Order
of Referral” which had the full motion attached this time, albeit still
modified as the hyperlinks and bookmarks had been removed. REC. 1282 59.
This amended referral was sent via email correspondence by Baker at 11:17
A.M. on October 8, 2024, who stated that due to the size of the motion, it
was split into three parts. REC. 1258. This excuse directly contradicts the
standard filing procedure in Tarrant County, which was raised and
subsequently ignored in an objection. REC. 1269. No response was filed in
regard to the motion to recuse or objection by Carter. R. Recusal Denial and
More Delays, and Federal Removal 60. Justice E. Lee Gabriel was assigned
to hear the motion, which had to be rescheduled due to technical difficulties
for November 7, 2024. REC. 1306. 61. The morning of the hearing, Plaintiff
woke up with a dental emergency, and promptly notified all parties, and
requested a reset for the hearing, which everyone agreed to. REC.
1393-1396. 62. Despite this agreement, the recusal was denied for failure to
appear, and made no mention of the agreement or the emergency. REC.
1398. 63. With no other remedies left, Plaintiff removed the case to Federal
Court on December 2, 2024, which was quickly remanded back on

December 4, 2024. REC. 1426. 64. On December 14, 2024, defendant
Branthoover texted Plaintiff, sending a threat which stated “[w]hen things
all over, you get to deal with me.” at 2:15 P.M. REC. 1720 65. On December
16, 2024, Plaintiff initiated suit against Daniel Kenneth Branthoover in the
Western District of Oklahoma seeking relief in the form of damages from the
ongoing deprivation from his home. REC. 1451. 66. Plaintiff notified the
Texas court of this lawsuit on December 31, 2024. REC. 1446. S. Further
Delays, Motion to Dismiss for Want of Prosecution, and the Original SAPCR
67. On January 24, 2025, Plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss for want of
prosecution due to the total lack of participation in the case by the opposing
party. REC. 1527. No response was ever received from Carter on this
motion. 68. On January 29, 2025, defendant Myers began disposing of
Plaintiff’s personal belongings that remained on the family property. REC.
1629-1631. 69. On February 12, 2025, Plaintiff learned that his youngest
daughter was suffering from dental pain due to Myers’ failure to obtain
dental insurance for the children. REC. 3281. 70. By March 14, (REC.
1833-1837) the judges had still not been reinstated from the first recusal,
which lad Plaintiff to reach out to Baker to request a hearing on his
unopposed summary judgment that had been on the docket since February
22, 2024, where he had to remind her to reinstate the judges back into the
case. REC. 1833-1837. 71. Given the delays, and since the case had been
brought in bad faith initially, the Plaintiff opened an original SAPCR suit in
the 233rd District Court of Tarrant County on March 18, 2025, where he
argued for dominant jurisdiction in a cover letter sent to the clerk. REC.
2260. T. Counsel Suddenly Becomes Active 72. The very next day, defendant
Carter filed an original answer filed on her behalf by Roderick Marx. REC.
2279. The motion was a boilerplate motion, and was followed by a motion to
consolidate, which was filed in the wrong court, and was also filed on
Carter’s behalf by RODERICK D. MARX. REC. 2284. 73. The Plaintiff
immediately responded by filing a motion to strike (REC. 1957) a Rule 12
motion to show authority challenging both Carter and RODERICK D MARX’s
authority (REC. 2288) and on March 24, 2025, an emergency ex-parte TRO
to prevent Myers from barring Plaintiff’s access to the home. (REC. 2302)
No responses were ever received from Carter on these motions. 74. On
March 26, 2025, an objection was filed to Carter’s consolidation motion in
the 233rd court. REC. 1881. 75. Plaintiff reached out to the coordinator from
the 233rd and went through the process to present the motion to the judge.
REC. 2338-2341. 76. On March 29, 2025, Plaintiff appeared before Associate
Judge Kate Stone, who refused to hear Plaintiff’s emergency motion despite
no response being filed, and told him to leave the courtroom. The hearing
date scheduled for April 10, 2025, as agreed by Carter and Plaintiff (REC.
2358), was actually un-set by Stone. REC. 2361. 77. The grounds for this
outright refusal was due to Carter calling in a favor from the judge without
even being present in the courtroom, to where Stone left the room, came
back, and told the Plaintiff to leave informing him that a motion to
consolidate would be filed by Carter the following week. U. Five Concurrent
Mandamus Petitions 78. Subsequently, after he was turned away from the
courtroom, Carter’s consolidation motion wasn’t filed until April 4, 2025
(REC. 2367), resulting in two mandamus petitions to try again to have the
March 14, 2024, order signed by Kaitcer vacated, and to compel Kate Stone
to hear the emergency TRO. See 25-0361, 25-0367. 79. On the same day the
mandamus was filed against Stone, District Judge Kenneth Newell sua

sponte granted Carter’s consolidation motion in both courts without a
hearing, and without addressing the emergency situation for the children or
the Plaintiff’s objections, leading to a third mandamus proceeding. REC.
2393, See also 25-0378. 80. On April 23, 2025, a notice of trial setting was
served on the parties by defendant Munford in the midst of all of these
issues. REC. 1773. 81. The same day, Plaintiff filed an objection and
requested an emergency stay. REC. 2219. No response was received to this
objection by either Munford or Carter. 82. Two days later on April 25, 2025,
Plaintiff filed his second recusal motion, and amended it on April 28, 2025,
this time only against Munford, and requested that the rules of procedure be
followed, and objected to the involvement of the court coordinator given the
prior recusal’s ambiguity and significant delays caused by her involvement.
REC. 2488 No response to this motion was ever filed from Carter. 83. Baker
continued to be involved in the recusal process, this time erroneously
forwarding an order of referral from defendant Kaitcer, who was not named
in the recusal motion. REC. 2615. 84. Plaintiff immediately objected on April
29, 2025, naming two issues: 1) the coordinator was still involved, and 2) the
order of referral sent by Kaitcer was erroneous. REC. 2620. 84. Plaintiff
objected to the order of assignment of John H. Cayce (REC. 3149) which was
issued on May 7, 2025, due to the unresolves issues. REC. 2620. 85. David L.
Evans overruled this objection on May 15, 2025, leading to mandamus
petition 25-0426, a direct appeal to the Texas Supreme Court. REC. 3507.
86. On May 20, 2025, John H. Cayce summarily denied the recusal, including
the denial of a motion to recuse Kaitcer which was never filed, leading to
mandamus petition 25-0458, a second direct appeal to the Texas Supreme
Court. 87. All five petitions were denied both initially and on rehearing, and
all emergency motions to stay proceedings were dismissed. The only insights
given from the appellate courts was: “Denied, per curiam.” No response was
filed by any implicated judge or opposing counsel. V. Federal RICO Case and
the Push Towards Final Trial 88. In June of 2025, Plaintiff amended his
complaint against Daniel Kenneth Branthoover and enjoined Myers as a
defendant, which they defended pro-se. 89. Plaintiff communicated this
action with the trial court, and no further action was taken in the case until
August of 2025, when defendant Munford sua sponte set the case for final
trial on December 10, 2025. 90. Plaintiff immediately objected to this trial
setting, and moved to recuse Munford for a third time. 91. The court
coordinator continued to be involved in the process, leading to a subsequent
motion to recuse the regional presiding judge, David L. Evans. 92. Plaintiff
now prepares this suit to hold defendants accountable for their collective
actions, and to prevent their common goal from being achieved, which is to
obtain defendant Myers a final decree of divorce. 93. For the forthcoming
reasons, the conduct outlined herein constitutes conduct of an enterprise
through a pattern of racketeering activity, as several predicate acts were
committed, the enterprise shares a common purpose, and Plaintiff has
suffered direct and ongoing injury to business and property as a direct result
of the defendant’s collective predicate acts. Assuming the facts are proven,
explain why, even though judges are involved, the plaintiff did everything he
could to try and remedy the situation, but each attempt proved to be
ineffective Research
Answer (Fifth Circuit)

=== PAGE 12 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Short response
Even though judges were involved, the plaintiff pursued every available
legal remedy—motions, objections, appeals, recusals, and administrative
actions—but these efforts were consistently thwarted or rendered ineffective
due to the coordinated and ongoing nature of the alleged racketeering
enterprise, which included judicial actors. The law recognizes that a RICO
claim can be established even when judges are implicated, provided the
plaintiff demonstrates a pattern of racketeering activity by an enterprise
that causes direct injury, and the plaintiff’s persistent but unsuccessful
attempts to obtain relief underscore the systemic entrenchment of the
alleged scheme.
Summary
The plaintiff’s actions—filing motions, seeking recusal, objecting to
irregularities, appealing to higher courts, and even initiating federal
proceedings—demonstrate exhaustive efforts to remedy the harm caused by
the alleged enterprise. Despite these efforts, the coordinated conduct of the
defendants, including judicial officers, attorneys, and private individuals,
allegedly ensured that each legal avenue was blocked, delayed, or
manipulated, leaving the plaintiff without effective relief.
Under federal RICO law, the involvement of judges does not immunize an
enterprise from liability if they participate in or facilitate a pattern of
racketeering activity. The plaintiff’s inability to obtain redress, despite
diligent pursuit of all procedural and substantive remedies, is consistent
with the type of entrenched, systemic misconduct that RICO was designed to
address, and the law provides that such circumstances may support a viable
civil RICO claim if the statutory elements are met.
Background and Relevant Law
Legislative and Regulatory Framework
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), codified at
18 U.S.C. §§ 1961–1964, provides a civil cause of action for any person
injured in their business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962.
Section 1962 prohibits any person from conducting or participating in the
conduct of an enterprise’s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity,
where the enterprise’s activities affect interstate or foreign commerce. The
statute defines “racketeering activity” to include a broad array of criminal
acts, such as mail fraud, wire fraud, extortion, obstruction of justice, and
others. To establish a civil RICO claim, a plaintiff must show: (1) conduct, (2)
of an enterprise, (3) through a pattern, (4) of racketeering activity, and (5)
injury to business or property as a result.
A “pattern” requires at least two predicate acts within ten years, but the
Supreme Court has clarified that a pattern also requires “continuity plus
relationship”—the acts must be related and pose a threat of continued

=== PAGE 13 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
criminal activity. The enterprise can be any group of individuals associated
in fact, even if not a legal entity, and the law is to be construed liberally from
the perspective of the victim (RICO: A Primer (2022-01-31); PAYORS,
PLAYERS, AND PROXIMATE CAUSE. (2022-05-01)).
Case Law
The Fifth Circuit and district courts within Texas have consistently held that
a civil RICO claim requires: (1) a person, (2) who engages in a pattern of
racketeering activity, (3) connected to the conduct of an enterprise, and (4)
injury to business or property as a result (Moore v. Town N. Auto., Inc., Civil
Action No. 3:14-CV-1215-D (N.D. Tex. Jul 11, 2014); George v. Blue Diamond
Petroleum, Inc., 718 F.Supp. 539 (W.D. La. 1989)). Predicate acts must be
related and demonstrate continuity, either as a closed period of repeated
conduct or as ongoing conduct that threatens future repetition (Poe v. Bock,
EP-17-CV-00232-DCG (W.D. Tex. Sep 07, 2018)). For a RICO conspiracy claim
under § 1962(d), it must be shown that two or more people agreed to
commit a substantive RICO offense and that the defendant knew of and
agreed to the overall objective (Chaney v. Dreyfus Service Corp., 595 F.3d
219 (5th Cir. 2010)).
Importantly, the involvement of judges in a RICO conspiracy does not
preclude the possibility of a valid RICO claim. The Fifth Circuit has
recognized that judicial actors can be part of a racketeering enterprise if
they participate in or facilitate the pattern of racketeering activity (U.S. v.
Stratton, 649 F.2d 1066 (5th Cir. 1981)). However, judicial immunity may
shield judges for acts taken in their judicial capacity, unless they act outside
that capacity or engage in non-judicial conduct (Holloway v. Walker, 765 F.2d
517 (5th Cir. 1985)).
To establish standing, the plaintiff must show that the RICO violation was
the proximate cause of the injury (Whalen v. Carter, 954 F.2d 1087 (5th Cir.
1992); In re Mastercard Intern. Inc., Internet Gamb., 132 F.Supp.2d 468
(E.D. La. 2001)). The Supreme Court has relaxed the proximate cause
requirement for RICO claims based on mail and wire fraud, so that reliance
on the misrepresentation is not required, but causation must still be shown
(Chapter 4. Elements of Cause of Action).
Analysis
Plaintiff’s Exhaustive Efforts to Remedy the Situation
The timeline demonstrates that the plaintiff took every reasonable and
available step to challenge the alleged misconduct. These included:
Filing motions to vacate, reconsider, and consolidate;
Objecting to irregularities in court filings and procedures;
Seeking recusal of judges and court staff;
Appealing to state appellate courts and the Texas Supreme Court;
Removing the case to federal court when state remedies failed;
Filing administrative complaints and seeking emergency relief;

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Initiating a separate federal RICO action.
Despite these efforts, each attempt was met with procedural obstacles, non-
responsiveness, or further acts that allegedly perpetuated the scheme. For
example, recusal motions were denied on technicalities or ignored, appellate
courts issued summary denials, and court staff allegedly tampered with
filings or failed to process motions properly. The plaintiff’s appeals and
objections were either not addressed or were dismissed without substantive
review.
RICO Elements and the Involvement of Judges
The law is clear that a RICO claim can be established even when judges are
involved, provided the statutory elements are met. The Fifth Circuit has
recognized that judicial actors can be part of a racketeering enterprise if
they participate in or facilitate the pattern of racketeering activity (U.S. v.
Stratton, 649 F.2d 1066 (5th Cir. 1981)). The statute’s definition of
“enterprise” is broad and includes any group of individuals associated in
fact, regardless of whether they are public officials, private individuals, or a
mix of both (RICO: A Primer (2022-01-31)).
The plaintiff’s allegations, if proven, describe a coordinated and ongoing
scheme involving multiple individuals—private parties, attorneys, court staff,
and judges—who engaged in repeated acts of wire fraud, mail fraud,
document tampering, and judicial manipulation. These acts were not
isolated but were related by a common purpose (to deprive the plaintiff of
business and property interests) and method (use of the courts, fraudulent
filings, and interstate communications), and occurred over an extended
period. This satisfies the “continuity plus relationship” requirement for a
RICO pattern (Poe v. Bock, EP-17-CV-00232-DCG (W.D. Tex. Sep 07, 2018); 
Montesano v. Seafirst Commercial Corp., 818 F.2d 423 (5th Cir. 1987)).
The involvement of judges does not immunize the enterprise from RICO
liability. While judicial immunity protects judges for acts taken in their
judicial capacity, it does not extend to acts outside that capacity or to
participation in criminal conduct (Holloway v. Walker, 765 F.2d 517 (5th Cir.
1985)). The allegations here suggest that the judges and court staff may
have acted beyond their judicial roles by facilitating or participating in the
scheme.
Why Plaintiff’s Efforts Were Ineffective
The plaintiff’s persistent but unsuccessful attempts to obtain relief are
consistent with the type of entrenched, systemic misconduct that RICO was
designed to address. The law recognizes that when an enterprise is
sufficiently coordinated and includes actors with control over the legal
process (such as judges and court staff), ordinary legal remedies may be
rendered ineffective. The Fifth Circuit has acknowledged that RICO is
intended to address long-term, organized schemes that undermine
legitimate processes (Stacker v. Tex. Dep't of Safety, No. 3:20-cv-2951-X-BN
(N.D. Tex. Sep 25, 2020); U.S. v. Elliott, 571 F.2d 880 (5th Cir. 1978)).
• 

=== PAGE 15 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
The plaintiff’s inability to obtain redress, despite diligent pursuit of all
procedural and substantive remedies, is not a bar to a RICO claim. Rather, it
is evidence of the effectiveness and reach of the alleged enterprise. The law
does not require a plaintiff to succeed in state court or exhaust all remedies
before bringing a RICO claim; it requires only that the plaintiff suffer direct
injury to business or property as a result of the enterprise’s racketeering
activity (George v. Blue Diamond Petroleum, Inc., 718 F.Supp. 539 (W.D. La.
1989); Whalen v. Carter, 954 F.2d 1087 (5th Cir. 1992)).
Causation and Standing
To have standing, the plaintiff must show that the RICO violation was the
proximate cause of the injury. The Supreme Court has relaxed the proximate
cause requirement for RICO claims based on mail and wire fraud, so that
reliance on the misrepresentation is not required, but causation must still be
shown (Chapter 4. Elements of Cause of Action). The plaintiff’s allegations
of direct harm—loss of business, property, and access to clients—are
precisely the types of injuries compensable under RICO (Cedra Pharmacy
Houston, LLC v. UnitedHealth Grp., Inc., CIVIL ACTION NO. H-17-3800
(S.D. Tex. Mar 07, 2019)).
Judicial Immunity and Its Limits
Judicial immunity is a significant doctrine that protects judges from liability
for acts taken in their judicial capacity (Holloway v. Walker, 765 F.2d 517
(5th Cir. 1985)). However, this immunity is not absolute. If judges act outside
their judicial capacity or participate in criminal conduct, immunity may not
apply. The facts alleged here suggest that the judges and court staff may
have acted beyond their judicial roles by facilitating or participating in the
scheme. This is a complex and fact-intensive inquiry, but the law does not
categorically bar RICO claims against judicial actors (U.S. v. Stratton, 649 F.
2d 1066 (5th Cir. 1981)).
Pattern, Predicate Acts, and Enterprise
The law requires that the predicate acts be related and continuous, not
isolated or part of a single episode (AJ Holdings of Metairie, LLC v.
Fischbein, Civil Action 21-318 (E.D. La. Jan 31, 2022)). The plaintiff’s
allegations describe a series of acts over at least 20 months, including wire
fraud, mail fraud, document tampering, perjury, extortion, and ongoing
threats. These acts are related by their common purpose and method, and
occurred over an extended period, satisfying both the “relationship” and
“continuity” requirements for a RICO pattern (Poe v. Bock, EP-17-CV-00232-
DCG (W.D. Tex. Sep 07, 2018)).
The enterprise alleged here—a group of private individuals, attorneys, court
staff, and judges acting in concert—fits within the broad definition of a RICO
enterprise (RICO: A Primer (2022-01-31)). The law does not require the
enterprise to be a formal legal entity; an association-in-fact is sufficient.

=== PAGE 16 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
RICO Conspiracy
For a RICO conspiracy claim under § 1962(d), it must be shown that two or
more people agreed to commit a substantive RICO offense and that the
defendant knew of and agreed to the overall objective (Chaney v. Dreyfus
Service Corp., 595 F.3d 219 (5th Cir. 2010)). The facts here allege repeated
coordination, mutual benefit, and ongoing communications among the
participants, which are sufficient to plead an agreement.
Exceptions and Caveats
Judicial Immunity: Judges and court staff may assert immunity for
acts taken in their judicial capacity. However, if the allegations are that
they participated in or facilitated criminal acts outside their judicial
function, immunity may not apply. This is a complex area and may limit
the scope of relief against certain defendants (Holloway v. Walker, 765
F.2d 517 (5th Cir. 1985)).
Pleading Particularity: RICO claims based on fraud (mail or wire)
must be pleaded with particularity under Rule 9(b) of the Federal Rules
of Civil Procedure. The facts here are detailed and specify dates,
participants, and acts, which should satisfy this requirement if properly
pleaded (Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy (2024-01-01)).
Causation and Standing: The plaintiff must show that the RICO
violation was the proximate cause of the injury. The facts allege a direct
link between the predicate acts and the harm suffered, but this is a
fact-intensive inquiry (Whalen v. Carter, 954 F.2d 1087 (5th Cir. 1992)).
Scope of Predicate Acts: Not all alleged misconduct may qualify as a
RICO predicate act. For example, mere delay or incompetence in legal
representation, absent fraud or criminal intent, may not suffice (Gabriel
v. Outlaw, CASE NO. 3:20-CV-60-E-BK (N.D. Tex. Mar 01, 2021); Snow
Ingredients, Inc. v. SnoWizard, Inc., 833 F.3d 512 (5th Cir. 2016)).
Conclusion
The plaintiff’s exhaustive efforts to remedy the situation—through motions,
objections, appeals, recusals, and administrative actions—demonstrate that
he did everything possible within the legal system to address the alleged
misconduct. The consistent ineffectiveness of these efforts, in the face of a
coordinated and ongoing scheme involving judicial actors, is precisely the
type of entrenched, systemic misconduct that RICO was designed to
address. The law recognizes that a RICO claim can be established even
when judges are implicated, provided the plaintiff demonstrates a pattern of
racketeering activity by an enterprise that causes direct injury. The
plaintiff’s persistent but unsuccessful attempts to obtain relief underscore
the systemic entrenchment of the alleged scheme and support the viability
of a civil RICO claim if the statutory elements are met.

U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
The district court granted the motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.
The parties present several arguments regarding the application of civil
RICO. We first treat the question whether plaintiffs have alleged a pattern of
racketeering activity, and then turn to whether plaintiffs' allegations
establish an 'association in fact' enterprise for RICO purposes. ... S.Rep. No.
91-617, p. 158 (1969) (emphasis added). Similarly, the sponsor of the Senate
bill, after quoting this portion of the Report, pointed out to his colleagues
that '[t]he term 'pattern' itself requires the showing of a relationship.... So,
therefore, proof of two acts of racketeering activity, without more, does not
establish a pattern....' 116 Cong.Rec. 18940 (1970) (statement of Sen.
McClellan). See also id., at 35193 (statement of Rep. Poff) (RICO 'not aimed
at the isolated offender'); House Hearings, at 665. ... In R.A.G.S., the
plaintiff-corporation sued its former president and stockholder asserting that
they had defrauded it. The corporation pointed to two mailings of false
invoices as two acts of mail fraud; the two acts required for a pattern. The
district court granted defendant's motion for summary judgment, concluding
that there was evidence of only one act of mail fraud; it was persuaded that
the asserted second mailing 'was not caused by the defendants and was,
therefore, not an execution of a scheme to defraud.' Defendants argued on
appeal that even if the two acts were caused by the defendants, they were
not a pattern, pointing to Sedima's language that 'while two acts are
necessary, they may not be sufficient.' 105 S.Ct. at 3285, n. 14. The panel in
R.A.G.S. replied: '[T]he Supreme Court in Sedima implied that two 'isolated'
acts would not constitute a pattern.'
Summary
The passage highlights the importance of demonstrating a "pattern" of
racketeering activity, which requires more than just two isolated acts. The
acts must be related and continuous to establish a pattern under RICO. This
is relevant to the plaintiff's situation because it underscores the need for a
comprehensive demonstration of a pattern of racketeering activity, which
the plaintiff has attempted to do by detailing multiple predicate acts over an
extended period. The passage also implies that isolated acts, even if they
meet the technical definition of racketeering, may not suffice to establish a
RICO claim.

determined whether or not the jury's verdict of guilty rested upon its
conclusion that the defendants had an objective which can not be supported

predicate acts which were related to the affairs of Harvey's arson ring.
Summary
In RICO cases, the focus is on whether the defendant committed at least two
predicate acts related to the enterprise's affairs. The passage highlights that
these acts do not need to be related to each other, only to the enterprise.
This is relevant to the question because it underscores the importance of
demonstrating a pattern of racketeering activity, which the plaintiff in the
question has attempted to do by detailing various predicate acts involving
multiple individuals, including judges.
Trevino v. Pechero, 592 F.Supp.2d 939 (S.D. Tex. 2008)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of Texas
Extract
Here, Plaintiffs ignore the Fifth Circuit's more specific requirements for a
RICO person and simply allege that Defendants are persons under the
broader RICO definition. (Doc. 36 at 3). They do not specifically allege that
Defendant Pechero poses a continuous threat of racketeering activity, but
the Court infers from Plaintiffs' broad allegations of wrongdoing that
Defendant Pechero could pose a continuous threat to them. He presumably
still owns the building in which their office is located, and thus could
continue to exert great influence over them. Accordingly, the Court finds
that Defendant Pechero is a person under RICO. Viewing the pleadings in
light most favorable to the Plaintiffs, Defendant Chrysler, who was allegedly
involved in multiple acts of wrongdoing at the direction of Pechero, could
also pose a continuous threat to the Plaintiffs. Either of these Defendants
could continue to engage in racketeering activity against Plaintiffs, if
Plaintiffs' pleading are true.
Summary
In the Fifth Circuit, a RICO claim requires demonstrating a continuous
threat of racketeering activity. The court in Trevino v. Pechero inferred a
continuous threat from broad allegations of wrongdoing, even when specific
allegations were not made. This suggests that the court is willing to consider
the broader context and potential for ongoing harm when evaluating RICO
claims.

Poe v. Bock, EP-17-CV-00232-DCG (W.D. Tex. Sep 07, 2018)
U.S. District Court — Western District of Texas
Extract
Under Rule 8(a), a pleading must contain 'a short and plain statement of the
claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.' Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2).
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) allows a party to seek dismissal of a
claim for 'failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.' Fed. R.
Civ. P. 12(b)(6). On a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a court accepts well-pleaded facts
as true and construes them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. Gines
v. D.R. Horton, Inc., 699 F.3d 812, 816 (5th Cir. 2012). But a court does not
accept as true 'conclusory allegations, unwarranted factual inferences, or
legal conclusions.' ... 'To establish a RICO pattern it must [ ] be shown that
the predicates themselves amount to, or that they otherwise constitute a
threat of, continuing racketeering activity.' H.J. Inc. v. Nw. Bell Tel. Co., 492
U.S. 229, 240-41 (1989). Continuity can be 'both a closed- and open-ended
concept, referring either to a closed period of repeated conduct, or to past
conduct that by its nature projects into the future with a threat of
repetition.' Id. at 241. Further, the Supreme Court explained: A party
alleging a RICO violation may demonstrate continuity over a closed period
by proving a series of related predicates extending over a substantial period
of time. Predicate acts extending over a few weeks or months and
threatening no future criminal conduct do not satisfy this requirement:
Congress was concerned in RICO with long-term criminal conduct. Often a
RICO action will be brought before continuity can be established in this way.
In... Id. at 242. Whether there is a threat of continued racketeering activity
is highly dependent on the specific facts of each case. Id. Furthermore, the
Court agrees with the First, Second, Third, Fourth, Seventh, and District of
Columbia Circuits that 'RICO claims premised on mail or wire fraud must be
particularly scrutinized because of the relative ease with which a plaintiff
may mold a RICO pattern from allegations that, upon closer scrutiny, do not
support it.' ... 'A pattern of racketeering activity requires two or more
predicate acts and a demonstration that the racketeering predicates are
related and amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity. The
predicate acts can be either state or federal crimes.' In re MasterCard Int'l
Inc., 313 F.3d 257, 261-62 (5th Cir. 2002). Where mail and wire fraud are
alleged as the predicate acts, a plaintiff must prove: (1) A scheme to defraud
or to obtain money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses,
representations, or promises; (2) interstate or intrastate use of the mails for
the purpose of furthering or executing the scheme to defraud; (3) the use of
the mails by the defendant connected with the scheme to defraud; and (4)
actual injury to the business or property of the plaintiff. Landry v. Air Line
Pilots Ass'n Int'l AFL-CIO, 901 F.2d 404, 428 (5th Cir. 1990). Further, the
Supreme Court explained that 'to state a claim under civil RICO, the plaintiff
is required to show that a RICO predicate offense not only was a 'but for'
cause of his injury, but was the proximate cause as well.' Hemi Grp., LLC v.
City of New York, N.Y., 559 U.S. 1, 8-9 (2010) (internal quotation marks

omitted). 'In assessing proximate cause, 'the central question [we] must ask
is whether the alleged violation led directly to the plaintiff's injuries.'
Summary
Legal standards for establishing a civil RICO claim, emphasizing the need
for continuity and a pattern of racketeering activity. It also highlights the
importance of demonstrating that the alleged RICO violation was the direct
cause of the plaintiff's injuries. This is relevant to the question as it provides
a framework for understanding why the plaintiff's attempts to remedy the
situation may have been ineffective if the legal standards were not met.
Chaney v. Dreyfus Service Corp., 595 F.3d 219 (5th Cir. 2010)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
A defendant need not know exactly what predicate acts the conspiracy
intends to perpetrate so long as the defendant knows and agrees to facilitate
the 'overall objective' of the conspiracy.
Summary
In a RICO conspiracy claim, a defendant does not need to have detailed
knowledge of every act within the conspiracy, but must be aware of and
agree to the overall objective of the conspiracy. This is relevant to the
plaintiff's situation because it suggests that even if the judges involved did
not know every detail of the alleged racketeering activities, their actions
could still be part of the conspiracy if they facilitated the overall objective.
The plaintiff's repeated attempts to remedy the situation, such as filing
motions, objections, and appeals, demonstrate his efforts to address the
alleged misconduct. However, the involvement of judges and court staff, who
may have facilitated the overall objective of the conspiracy, could have
rendered these attempts ineffective.

Summary
For a RICO claim to be successful, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the
defendants' predicate acts were both the factual and proximate cause of the
plaintiff's injury. This means that the plaintiff must show a direct link
between the defendants' actions and the harm suffered. The passage
highlights the importance of establishing proximate cause, which is a higher
standard than merely showing that the defendants' actions were a "but for"
cause of the injury.
U.S. v. Phillips, 664 F.2d 971 (5th Cir. 1981)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
In order to prove a substantive RICO violation, 18 U.S.C.A. § 1962(c), the
Government must prove the following elements: (1) the existence of an
enterprise which affects interstate or foreign commerce; (2) that the
defendant 'associated with' the enterprise; (3) that the defendant
participated in the conduct of the enterprise's affairs; and (4) that the
participation was through a pattern of racketeering activity, i.e., by
committing at least two acts of racketeering activity designated in 18
U.S.C.A. § 1961(1).
Summary
Clear framework for understanding what constitutes a RICO violation,
emphasizing the need for an enterprise, association with the enterprise,
participation in its affairs, and a pattern of racketeering activity. This
framework is essential for evaluating the plaintiff's allegations in the context
of a RICO claim.
Holloway v. Walker, 765 F.2d 517 (5th Cir. 1985)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
Among the first cases incorporating judicial immunity into federal
jurisprudence was Bradley v. Fisher, 13 Wall. 335, 20 L.Ed. 646 (1872),
which identified five reasons for immunity: first, and most important, a judge
must be free to act upon his own convictions, without apprehension of

=== PAGE 22 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
personal consequences to himself; second, the controversiality and
importance of the competing interests in contest before a court make it
likely that the inevitable losing party may be overly willing to ascribe
malevolent motives to the judge; third, judges faced with the prospect of
damages actions would be driven to wasteful and distractive self-protection
devices, such as excessive record-keeping; fourth, alternative remedies such
as appeal and impeachment reduce the need for private rights of action
against judges; and, fifth, the ease of alleging bad faith would make a
qualified 'good faith' immunity virtually worthless.
Summary
Judicial immunity is a well-established doctrine in federal jurisprudence,
designed to protect judges from personal consequences when acting in their
judicial capacity. This immunity is grounded in the need for judges to act
independently and without fear of personal liability, even if their decisions
are controversial or unfavorable to one party. The passage highlights that
alternative remedies, such as appeals, are available to address judicial
errors, reducing the necessity for private actions against judges.
Whalen v. Carter, 954 F.2d 1087 (5th Cir. 1992)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
The civil RICO statute itself does not impose much of a standing
requirement upon plaintiffs in RICO actions: it merely provides that RICO
plaintiffs must have been injured 'by reason of' a predicate act or acts which
constitute a violation of RICO section 1962. 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c). See Sedima,
S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479, 496, 105 S.Ct. 3275, 3285, 87 L.Ed.2d
346 (1985). This RICO standing provision seems to require, as a condition to
a civil RICO action, that there be some nexus between the predicate acts
and the subsequent injury. Interpreting this provision, the Fifth Circuit has
concluded that the requisite nexus between predicate acts and subsequent
injury is a causal relation. Under this interpretation of the RICO statute, a
plaintiff has statutory standing to bring a claim as long as the defendants'
predicate acts constitute both a factual and proximate cause of the plaintiff's
alleged injury.
Summary
The Fifth Circuit requires a causal relationship between the predicate acts
and the injury for a plaintiff to have standing in a RICO claim. This means
that the plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendants' actions were both
the factual and proximate cause of their injury. The passage highlights the
importance of establishing this causal link to proceed with a RICO claim.

U.S. v. Elliott, 571 F.2d 880 (5th Cir. 1978)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
The substantive proscriptions of the RICO statute apply to insiders and
outsiders those merely 'associated with' an enterprise who participate
directly and indirectly in the enterprise's affairs through a pattern of
racketeering activity. 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). ... Thus, the RICO net is woven
tightly to trap even the smallest fish, those peripherally involved with the
enterprise. This effect is enhanced by principles of conspiracy law also
developed to facilitate prosecution of conspirators at all levels. Direct
evidence of agreement is unnecessary: 'proof of such an agreement may rest
upon inferences drawn from relevant and competent circumstantial
evidence ordinarily the acts and conduct of the alleged conspirators
themselves'.
Summary
The RICO statute is designed to apply broadly to both insiders and outsiders
of an enterprise who participate in its affairs through a pattern of
racketeering activity. The statute is intended to capture even those
peripherally involved, and conspiracy law principles facilitate the
prosecution of conspirators at all levels. Direct evidence of an agreement is
not necessary; inferences can be drawn from circumstantial evidence, such
as the acts and conduct of the alleged conspirators. This broad application
of RICO and conspiracy law means that even if judges are involved, the
plaintiff's attempts to remedy the situation may be ineffective if the
enterprise's activities are deeply entrenched and involve multiple actors
working in concert.

U.S. District Court — Northern District of Texas
Extract
Civil RICO liability does not exist unless the pleadings allege actual criminal
activity. Id. Actions that violate lawyers' rules of professional conduct but
are not crimes themselves cannot be the requisite predicate acts to establish
a RICO pattern. St. Germain, 556 F.3d at 263. Construing counsel's litigation
acts, even bad-faith acts or acts that violate professional rules, as federal
crimes for RICO purposes 'would undermine the policies of access and
finality that animate our legal system.' Snow, 833 F.3d at 525 (citation
omitted). Simply put, poor lawyering does not expose counsel to civil RICO
liability. See id.

=== PAGE 24 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
For a RICO claim to be valid, there must be actual criminal activity alleged
in the pleadings. Actions that may violate professional conduct rules but are
not criminal cannot be used as predicate acts for a RICO claim. This is
relevant to the question because it highlights the difficulty in establishing a
RICO claim based on actions taken during litigation, even if those actions
are perceived as unfair or unethical. The passage suggests that the
plaintiff's attempts to remedy the situation may have been ineffective
because the actions of the judges and attorneys, while possibly unethical,
may not meet the threshold of criminal activity required for a RICO claim.

Plaintiffs have also alleged that Defendants conspired to violate § 1962(a),
(b), and (c). '[B]ecause the core of a RICO civil conspiracy is an agreement
to commit predicate acts, a RICO civil conspiracy complaint, at the very
least, must allege specifically such an agreement.' Crowe, 43 F.3d at 206
(quoting Tel-Phonic Servs., Inc. v. TBS Int'l, Inc., 975 F.2d 1134, 1140 (5th
Cir.1992)). Plaintiffs specifically alleged that the Defendants entered into an
agreement and that each agreed to commit at least two predicate acts of
racketeering. These allegations are specific enough to state a claim that the
Defendants conspired to violate § 1962(c).
Summary
For a RICO civil conspiracy claim, it is essential to allege specifically that
the defendants entered into an agreement to commit predicate acts. The
passage highlights the importance of demonstrating an agreement among
the defendants to commit at least two predicate acts of racketeering. This is
relevant to the question because it underscores the necessity of showing a
coordinated effort among the defendants, which the plaintiff in the current
case has attempted to do by detailing the alleged conspiracy and the
involvement of various individuals, including judges.

activity or collection of unlawful debt”. 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). Section 1962(d),
at issue here, prohibits conspiracy to violate any part of § 1962. “The
elements of a conspiracy under § 1962(d) are simply (1) that two or more
people agreed to commit a substantive RICO offense and (2) that the
defendant knew of and agreed to the overall objective of the RICO offense.”
United States v. Pratt, 728 F.3d 463, 477 (5th Cir.2013) (emphasis added)
(internal quotation marks omitted).
Summary
A RICO conspiracy under § 1962(d) requires an agreement between two or
more people to commit a substantive RICO offense and that the defendant
knew of and agreed to the overall objective of the RICO offense. This is
relevant to the plaintiff's situation because it highlights the legal framework
under which the plaintiff's allegations of a coordinated scheme involving
multiple individuals, including judges, could be evaluated. The passage
underscores that the involvement of judges does not preclude the existence
of a RICO conspiracy if they were part of an agreement to further the
scheme. The plaintiff's repeated attempts to remedy the situation, despite
judicial involvement, align with the legal understanding that a conspiracy
can exist even if the substantive crime is not completed, as the conspiracy
itself is punishable.

In other words, RICO patterns require long-term, repetitive conduct which
means “predicate acts that are part and parcel of a single, otherwise lawful
transaction” do not establish a pattern of racketeering activity. [] For
example, in Scottsdale Ins. Co. v. Dorman, the RICO claim centered around a
$45, 000 false insurance claim. [] Although the incident spanned seven
months, the court found that any acts committed in furtherance of the
insurance claim were part of a “single fraudulent episode, ” meaning that
several different unlawful acts can still constitute “a single attempt” at some
overarching illegal goal under RICO. [] Therefore, there was no pattern of
conduct because there was only one incident, an “attempt to avoid paying []
medical expenses, ” even if that episode was made up of multiple illegal
deeds.
Summary
N example where a single fraudulent episode, even if composed of multiple
illegal acts, does not meet the RICO pattern requirement. This is relevant to
the question because it highlights the importance of demonstrating a
continuous pattern of illegal activity, which the plaintiff in the question

Summary
RICO claims require demonstrating that individuals participated in an

The [RICO] statute imposes civil liability for certain types of prohibited
conduct. See 18 U.S.C. § 1962(a)-(d). Common elements are present under

To establish a RICO claim, a plaintiff must demonstrate conduct of an
enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity that results in injury.
This aligns with the plaintiff's allegations of a coordinated scheme involving
multiple individuals, including judges, which affected his business and
property interests. The passage supports the notion that the plaintiff's
efforts to remedy the situation through legal channels were consistent with
the requirements to establish a RICO claim, despite the involvement of

The criminal statutes require not merely delay but corrupt activity by the

Luther v. Am. Nat'l Bank of Minn., 2012 WL 5471123, at *6 (D. Minn. Oct.

be the substance of malicious prosecution torts but could not sustain RICO
liability.

Summary
Litigation activities alone, without corruption, cannot be the basis for a civil
RICO claim. This suggests that the plaintiff's attempts to remedy the
situation through legal channels may have been ineffective because the
actions of the judges and other parties, while potentially unethical or in bad
faith, did not rise to the level of criminal activity required for a RICO claim.
Toth Enters. II, P.A. v. Forage, 707 F.Supp.3d 697 (W.D. Tex. 2023)
U.S. District Court — Western District of Texas
Extract
The federal RICO statute makes it 'unlawful for any person employed by or
associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities which affect,
interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or
indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of
racketeering activity.' 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). 'Any person injured in his
business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962' may bring a

(2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity.'
Summary
Legal framework for understanding the requirements of a RICO claim,
which is relevant to the plaintiff's situation. The plaintiff's attempts to
remedy the situation through legal channels, despite the involvement of
judges, align with the efforts to establish a RICO claim. The passage
supports the notion that the plaintiff's actions were directed towards
meeting the legal standards for a RICO claim, even if those attempts were
ultimately ineffective due to the alleged misconduct of the defendants,
including judicial figures.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C. §
1962(d). A common scenario of the racketeering activity alleged as part of
this conspiracy was the payment of monetary bribes to Judge Smith both
directly and through court employees in return for the protection of illegal
activities and for favorable treatment in court.
Summary
The involvement of judges in a RICO conspiracy does not preclude the
possibility of a valid RICO claim. The passage describes a scenario where
judges were part of a conspiracy involving racketeering activity, which
included bribery and manipulation of judicial processes. This indicates that
even when judges are involved, a RICO claim can be established if there is
evidence of a pattern of racketeering activity and an enterprise affecting
interstate commerce. The passage also highlights that the presence of
judicial figures in a conspiracy does not invalidate the claim but rather
underscores the severity and reach of the alleged racketeering activity.
Tel-Phonic Services, Inc. v. TBS Intern., Inc., 975 F.2d 1134 (5th Cir. 1992)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
The district court dismissed the RICO claims, finding that Plaintiffs failed 'to
allege a continuous pattern of intentional acts designed to defraud the
plaintiffs' and failed 'to plead with particularity the requisite elements of
wire and mail fraud pursuant to Rule 9(b).' ... The allegations of the
complaint suggest no 'series' of racketeering acts with the level of continuity
that is required for a RICO violation. ... The complaint does not allege facts
implying any agreement involving each of the Defendants to commit at least
two predicate acts.
Summary
For a RICO claim to be successful, the plaintiff must allege a continuous
pattern of racketeering activity and an agreement to commit predicate acts
with particularity. The passage highlights the importance of demonstrating
continuity and a specific agreement among defendants to commit the acts.
In the context of the question, the plaintiff's attempts to remedy the
situation may have been ineffective because the allegations did not meet
these stringent requirements, particularly if the judges involved did not find
the necessary continuity or agreement in the alleged acts.

In addition, the Supreme Court held that a plaintiff must prove the
defendant's violation was the proximate cause of the plaintiff's injury in

which federal courts have long held to require a showing of proximate
causation.
Summary
For a civil RICO claim, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant's
actions were the proximate cause of the plaintiff's injury. This requirement is
crucial for establishing standing in a civil RICO case. The passage highlights
the importance of showing a direct link between the defendant's violation

In Bridge, the Supreme Court rejected the argument that a RICO plaintiff
alleging mail fraud must plead and prove that the plaintiff personally relied
on the defendant’s fraudulent statement or omission. The Court deemed it
irrelevant that reliance is an element of common-law fraud because
'Congress chose to make mail fraud, not common-law fraud, the predicate
act for a RICO violation.' Bridge, 553 U.S. at 653. The Bridge Court stressed
that 'a person can be injured ‘by reason of’ a pattern of mail fraud even if he
has not relied on any misrepresentations.' Id. at 649. The Court noted that
proof of reliance by the plaintiff 'may in some cases be sufficient to establish
proximate cause but there is no sound reason to conclude that such proof is
always necessary.' Id. at 659. It added, however, that causation must still be
shown: '[N]one of this is to say that a RICO plaintiff who alleges injury ‘by
reason of’ a pattern of mail fraud can prevail without showing that someone
relied on the defendant’s misrepresentations.' Id. at 658. It added that 'the
complete absence of reliance may prevent the plaintiff from establishing
proximate cause.' Id. at 658–59.
Summary
In RICO cases involving mail fraud, the plaintiff does not need to prove
personal reliance on the fraudulent statements to establish a claim.
However, causation must still be shown, meaning that the plaintiff must
demonstrate that someone relied on the misrepresentations, which led to
the injury. This is relevant to the plaintiff's situation because it highlights the

importance of establishing causation in RICO claims, even when judges are
involved. The plaintiff's attempts to remedy the situation may have been
ineffective due to challenges in proving causation or reliance, despite the
presence of fraudulent acts.

Moreover, a plaintiff must prove that the defendant's violation of [section]
1962 was the proximate cause of the plaintiff's injury to have standing for a
civil RICO action. In creating this proximate cause requirement, the
Supreme Court reasoned that Congress modeled [section] 1964(c) on the
civil action provisions in the Clayton Act, which federal courts have long
held to require a showing of proximate causation. Recently, however, the
Court has relaxed this requirement for plaintiffs bringing RICO claims
predicated on mail and wire fraud. In Bridge v. Phoenix Bond & Indemnity
Co., the Supreme Court held that there is no requirement that plaintiffs in
such actions show, either as an element of their claim or as a prerequisite to
establishing proximate cause, that they relied on the defendant's alleged
misrepresentations.
Summary
The Supreme Court has relaxed the proximate cause requirement for RICO
claims based on mail and wire fraud. This means that plaintiffs do not need
to show reliance on the defendant's misrepresentations to establish
proximate cause. This is relevant to the plaintiff's situation because it
suggests that the plaintiff's inability to remedy the situation may not be due
to a lack of proximate cause but rather the systemic issues and potential
judicial misconduct involved in the case.

The passage highlights the requirement for a plaintiff to prove that the
defendant's violation of section 1962 was the proximate cause of the
plaintiff's injury to have standing for a civil RICO action. However, the
Supreme Court has relaxed this requirement for RICO claims predicated on
mail and wire fraud, indicating that plaintiffs do not need to show reliance
on the defendant's misrepresentations to establish proximate cause. This is

which may not require the same level of causation proof as other predicate
acts.

Extract
Courts agree that to establish standing under [sections] 1962(c), a plaintiff
must have suffered a harm caused by one of the predicate acts covered by
[sections] 1962(c). This rule significantly limits standing. For example, a
person wrongfully discharged for refusing to participate in a pattern of
racketeering activity lacks standing to sue under [sections] 1962(c) because
the harm suffered is caused by the termination, not the predicate acts of
racketeering. In addition, the Supreme Court has held that a plaintiff must
prove the defendant's violation was the proximate cause of the plaintiff's
injury in order to have standing under civil RICO. The Court reasoned that
Congress modeled [sections] 1964(c) on the civil action provisions in the
Clayton Act, which federal courts have long held to require a showing of
proximate causation.
Summary
For a plaintiff to have standing in a civil RICO claim, they must demonstrate
that the harm they suffered was directly caused by the predicate acts of
racketeering. This means that the plaintiff must show a direct link between
the defendant's violation and their injury. The passage also highlights the
importance of proximate causation, which is a requirement modeled after
the Clayton Act's civil action provisions. This requirement can make it
challenging for plaintiffs to establish standing if the harm they suffered is
not directly linked to the predicate acts.

second prong of the three-part analysis will not be satisfied where a
defendant exhibits mere awareness of another participant’s criminal acts...
If a jury determines that a defendant has violated the RICO Act, the court

Summary
Requirements for a RICO claim, emphasizing the need for direct injury to
business or property and the necessity of proving that the defendant's
violation was the proximate cause of the injury. It also highlights the
importance of a defendant's active participation in the criminal acts rather
than mere awareness. This is relevant to the plaintiff's situation as it
underscores the challenges in proving a RICO claim, especially when judges
are involved, and the plaintiff must demonstrate that their actions directly
caused the injury.

Extract
RICO is not just a tool for government control over organized crime. It is
also a remedial statute for civil matters. (31) It 'authorize[s]... criminal or
civil remedies on conduct already criminal, when performed in a specified
fashion' as delineated by the statute. (32) Section 1962 provides civil
remedies for four types of conduct: (1) using income derived from a pattern
of racketeering activity (33) to acquire an interest in an enterprise; (2)
acquiring or maintaining an interest in an enterprise through a pattern of
racketeering activity; (3) conducting the affairs of an enterprise through a
pattern of racketeering activity; and (4) conspiring to commit any of these
offenses. (34) Today, Congress urges courts to construe RICO liberally from
the 'perspective of the victim, not the perpetrator.' (35) A private civil right
of action in [section] 1964 provides that '[a]ny person injured in his business
or property by reason of a violation of section 1962... may sue.' (36) Notably,
a successful plaintiff under [section] 1964 is entitled to treble damages and
the cost of the suit, including attorney fees. (37) The threat of treble
damages encourages plaintiffs to bring claims and discourages entities from
engaging in illegal activities.
Summary
The passage explains that RICO is designed to provide civil remedies for
conduct that is already criminal when performed in a specified manner. It
emphasizes that RICO should be construed liberally from the perspective of
the victim, allowing individuals who have been injured in their business or
property by a RICO violation to sue. This aligns with the plaintiff's situation,
where he attempted to use the legal system to address the alleged
racketeering activities that harmed his business and property interests.
Despite the involvement of judges, the plaintiff's efforts to seek remedy
through the courts were consistent with the intent of RICO to provide a civil
avenue for addressing such grievances.
Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy
The Brief - American Bar Association - 2024-01-01
Extract
RICO’s broad definition of racketeering activity and the act’s reference to
mail and wire fraud as predicate offenses begs the question: Why not RICO?
That is, should the plaintiff consider adding a RICO count to an existing
state cause of action? Moreover, since an action under RICO arises under
federal law, a plaintiff can elect to have access to federal court. Civil RICO is
so broad and offers such a potentially broad pathway to pleading of such a
claim in light of the inclusion of mail and wire fraud as predicate acts that a
plaintiff can take almost any given set of facts and fashion their pleadings
and be... RICO’s prohibitions may be enforced in both criminal and civil
contexts. In the context of a civil action, a plaintiff must be directly injured
by reason of the defendant’s racketeering activities. Proximate cause, as an

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
aspect of RICO’s “by reason of ” standard, requires a RICO plaintiff to show
that the defendant’s racketeering offenses led directly to the plaintiff ’s
injuries.
Summary
Civil RICO claims require the plaintiff to demonstrate direct injury caused by
the defendant's racketeering activities. The passage highlights the broad
applicability of RICO in civil contexts, emphasizing the inclusion of mail and
wire fraud as predicate acts. It also underscores the necessity for the
plaintiff to establish a direct link between the racketeering offenses and the
injuries suffered. This information is relevant to understanding the plaintiff's
efforts to remedy the situation through a RICO claim, as it provides a legal
framework for addressing the alleged misconduct.
§ 2.07 Other Potential Charges
Intellectual Property and Computer Crimes - Full Court Press -
2020-00-00
Extract
Congress originally passed RICO in 1970 as part of the effort to fight
organized crime. The purpose of the RICO statute was 'the elimination of the
infiltration of organized crime and racketeering into legitimate organizations
operating in interstate commerce.' However, the statute is sufficiently broad
to encompass illegal activities relating to any enterprise affecting interstate
or foreign commerce, including those involved in criminal copyright
violations or in trafficking in counterfeit goods. The central provision of
RICO states that 'it shall be unlawful for any person through a pattern of
racketeering activity which is engaged in, or the activities of which affect,
interstate or foreign commerce.' A person includes 'any individual or entity
capable of holding a legal or beneficial interest in property.' This term is
intentionally broad and includes a variety of entities, such as corporations,
non-profit organizations, and 'members of organized crime.' In order for the
government to establish a violation of RICO it must prove that the defendant
engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity that involved an enterprise
engaged in interstate commerce.
Summary
The passage highlights the broad scope of the RICO statute, which is
designed to combat organized crime and racketeering activities that
infiltrate legitimate organizations. It emphasizes that RICO can apply to any
enterprise affecting interstate commerce, not just traditional organized
crime. This broad applicability is relevant to the plaintiff's situation, as it
suggests that the alleged coordinated scheme involving judges and other
individuals could fall under RICO if it involves a pattern of racketeering
activity affecting interstate commerce. The plaintiff's attempts to remedy the
situation through legal channels, despite the involvement of judges, align

with the statute's purpose of addressing organized schemes that undermine
legitimate processes.
Insurance Fraud is a Violent Crime.
Insurance Advocate - CINN Group, Inc. - 2024-03-01
Extract
RICO CONSPIRACY The essence of a RICO conspiracy is the existence of an
agreement to violate RICO's substantive provisions. RICO conspiracy was
established by proof of: (a) of an agreement to join a racketeering scheme,
(b) of the defendant's knowing engagement in the scheme with the intent
that its overall goals be effectuated, and (c) that the scheme involved, or by
agreement between any members of the conspiracy was intended to involve,
two or more predicate acts of racketeering.
Summary
A RICO conspiracy requires an agreement to engage in a racketeering
scheme, knowing participation with intent to achieve the scheme's goals,
and involvement in or intent to involve two or more predicate acts of
racketeering. This information is relevant to understanding the plaintiff's
situation because it highlights the complexity and coordination required to
establish a RICO conspiracy, which may involve multiple parties, including
judges, who may be acting outside their judicial capacity.
RICO: A Primer
Extract
A plaintiff is required to demonstrate that the defendant conducted the
affairs of an enterprise though a pattern of racketeering activity. The person
and the enterprise generally must be distinct; but, of course, a Rico person
can be a part of an enterprise. A RICO enterprise includes 'any individual,
partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or
group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.' Courts
have interpreted 'enterprise' broadly, and the definition captures both
legitimate and illegitimate enterprises. The statutory list is not exhaustive
but merely illustrative.
Summary
The definition of a RICO enterprise is broad and can include both legitimate
and illegitimate groups of individuals associated for a common purpose. This
means that even if judges are involved, they can be considered part of an
enterprise if they are associated with others in furthering a scheme. The
plaintiff's attempts to remedy the situation, despite involving judges, can be

=== PAGE 38 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
seen as efforts to address the conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of
racketeering activity. The broad interpretation of "enterprise" under RICO
law supports the plaintiff's position that the group, including judges, acted
in concert to further the scheme.

Summary
The definition of a RICO enterprise is broad and can include any group of
individuals associated in fact, even if not a legal entity. This means that the
involvement of judges and court staff in the alleged scheme does not
preclude the existence of a RICO enterprise. The plaintiff's attempts to
remedy the situation, despite involving judges, can still be seen as efforts to
address a coordinated scheme that fits within the broad definition of a RICO
enterprise.
