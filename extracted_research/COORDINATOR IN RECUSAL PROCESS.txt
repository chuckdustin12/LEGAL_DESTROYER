Question
This the issues when the district judge facing recusal uses his own court
coordinator to transmit documents to the regional judge and is involved in
the process, when the texas rules of procedure clearly designate this task to
the clerk. Also, explain the implications of this coordinator modifying the
original recusal and splitting it into three files when transmitting it to the
regional judge, which removed all hyperlinks and bookmarks and affected its
readability.
Answer (Texas)
Short response
When a district judge facing recusal uses their own court coordinator to
transmit recusal documents to the regional presiding judge—rather than the
court clerk as required by Texas rules—this constitutes a procedural
irregularity that undermines the integrity and transparency of the recusal
process. If the coordinator also modifies the original recusal filing (such as
splitting it into multiple files and removing hyperlinks or bookmarks), this
further risks prejudicing the parties, impeding review, and may render the
process noncompliant with mandatory procedural safeguards.
Summary
Texas law and local rules clearly assign the responsibility for transmitting
recusal motions and related orders to the court clerk, not to the judge or the
judge’s staff, including court coordinators. Any involvement by the judge or
their coordinator in transmitting or altering these documents is inconsistent
with the procedural framework designed to ensure impartiality,
transparency, and the integrity of the recusal process.
When a coordinator modifies the original recusal filing—such as by splitting
it into multiple files and removing hyperlinks or bookmarks—this not only
violates the prescribed procedure but also risks impairing the readability
and completeness of the record before the regional presiding judge. Such
actions can prejudice the parties, hinder effective review, and may provide
grounds for challenging the validity of the recusal proceedings or any
subsequent orders.
Background and Relevant Law
Legislative and Regulatory Framework
The Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, specifically Rule 18a, govern the recusal
and disqualification of judges in Texas district and county courts. Rule 18a
sets out a detailed process for handling recusal motions, including strict

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
requirements regarding who must transmit documents and what actions the
respondent judge may take once a motion is filed.
Under Rule 18a, when a motion to recuse is filed, the court clerk—not the
judge or the judge’s staff—is required to immediately deliver a copy of the
motion to both the respondent judge and the presiding judge of the
administrative judicial region. Similarly, when the respondent judge signs an
order of recusal or referral, the clerk must immediately deliver a copy to the
regional presiding judge. The rule also prohibits the respondent judge from
filing a response to the motion and restricts the judge from taking any
further action in the case while the motion is pending, except for good cause
stated in writing or on the record. These requirements are designed to
ensure that the recusal process is handled impartially and that the judge
whose recusal is sought does not influence the process beyond the initial
procedural steps, authority citation: Rule 18a. Recusal and Disqualification
of Judges, Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a.
Local rules, such as Rule 9 of the First Administrative Judicial Region,
reinforce these requirements by explicitly stating that the clerk of the court
must deliver the recusal motion and any signed order to the presiding judge.
The respondent judge’s role is limited to timely signing either a recusal
order or a referral order and filing it with the clerk. The rules do not
authorize the judge or the judge’s coordinator to transmit filings to the
presiding judge or to alter the motion’s format, authority citation: Rule 9.
Recusal and Disqualification, Tex. 1st. Admin. Jud. Reg. L. R. 9.
Case Law
Texas appellate courts have consistently emphasized the importance of strict
compliance with the procedural requirements for recusal. In In re Alpert,
276 S.W.3d 592 (Tex. App. 2008), the court held that only the regional
presiding judge has the authority to assign a judge to hear a recusal motion
and to reassign a case after recusal is granted. The court further clarified
that local or intra-court practices that conflict with Rule 18a are void. While
the case does not directly address the mechanics of document transmission,
it underscores that the challenged judge and their staff should not exercise
functions allocated to the regional presiding judge or otherwise act
inconsistently with Rule 18a.
Similarly, in Ex parte Thuesen, 546 S.W.3d 145 (Tex. Crim. App. 2017), the
Texas Court of Criminal Appeals highlighted that once a judge recuses, they
must request assignment from the regional presiding judge and take no
further action in the case except for good cause stated in a written order.
The court stressed the necessity of formal, written processes controlled by
the regional presiding judge, not the recused judge or their staff. The
involvement of the judge’s coordinator in transmitting or altering recusal
documents, especially in ways that affect the content or structure of the
filings, raises concerns about improper participation and potential prejudice
to the parties.
In Rio Grande Valley Gas Co., In re, 987 S.W.2d 167 (Tex. App. 1999), the
court emphasized the mandatory, ministerial nature of a judge’s duties upon

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
the filing of a recusal motion. The judge must either recuse or request
assignment by the presiding judge and must refrain from any further
proceedings. Any involvement by the judge or their agents that goes beyond
ministerial referral could be characterized as improper further proceedings.
The decision also underscores the importance of maintaining a proper
record and hearing; degrading the filing (such as by splitting it or removing
hyperlinks/bookmarks) risks impairing the record and the ability to review,
which could be raised as due-process concerns.
Analysis
1. The Role of the Clerk Versus the Judge or Coordinator
The Texas Rules of Civil Procedure and local rules are explicit in assigning
the responsibility for transmitting recusal motions and related orders to the
court clerk. The rationale for this requirement is to ensure that the process
is handled by a neutral court officer, rather than by the judge whose
impartiality is being challenged or by that judge’s staff. This separation is
critical to maintaining the integrity and transparency of the recusal process.
When a district judge uses their own court coordinator to transmit
documents to the regional presiding judge, this bypasses the clerk and
violates the procedural framework established by Rule 18a and local rules.
Such conduct is not a mere technicality; it undermines the safeguards
designed to prevent the judge or their staff from influencing the recusal
process. The coordinator, as an agent of the judge, is not a neutral party and
should not be involved in the transmission of recusal documents, authority
citations: Rule 18a. Recusal and Disqualification of Judges, Tex. R. Civ. P.
18a; Rule 9. Recusal and Disqualification, Tex. 1st. Admin. Jud. Reg. L. R. 9.
Case law supports this strict separation of roles. In In re Alpert, the court
made clear that only the regional presiding judge has the authority to assign
a judge to hear a recusal motion and that any local practices conflicting with
Rule 18a are void. The implication is that the judge and their staff must not
take actions that encroach upon the functions reserved for the clerk or the
regional presiding judge.
2. Prohibition on Further Action by the Respondent Judge
Rule 18a and the relevant case law also prohibit the respondent judge from
taking any further action in the case while a recusal motion is pending,
except for good cause stated in writing or on the record. This prohibition
extends to the judge’s staff, including the court coordinator, who act as
agents of the judge. Any involvement by the judge or their coordinator in
transmitting or altering recusal documents could be construed as taking
further action in the case, in violation of the rule, authority citation: Rule
18a. Recusal and Disqualification of Judges, Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a; Ex parte
Thuesen, 546 S.W.3d 145 (Tex. Crim. App. 2017).
In Ex parte Thuesen, the court underscored that once a judge recuses, they
must request assignment from the regional presiding judge and take no

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
further action in the case except for good cause. The involvement of the
judge’s coordinator in transmitting or altering recusal documents, especially
in ways that affect the content or structure of the filings, raises concerns
about improper participation and potential prejudice to the parties.
3. Implications of Modifying the Original Recusal Filing
The modification of the original recusal filing by the coordinator—such as
splitting it into multiple files and removing hyperlinks or bookmarks—raises
additional concerns. First, this conduct violates the requirement that the
clerk transmit the document as filed, without alteration. The rules do not
authorize the judge or their staff to modify the format or content of the
recusal motion or related filings.
Second, altering the filing in ways that affect its readability or completeness
can prejudice the parties and hinder the regional presiding judge’s ability to
review the motion effectively. The removal of hyperlinks and bookmarks, and
the splitting of the document into multiple files, can make it more difficult to
navigate the filing, potentially obscuring important information or
arguments. This can impair the integrity of the record and may provide
grounds for challenging the validity of the recusal proceedings or any
subsequent orders, authority citation: Rio Grande Valley Gas Co., In re, 987
S.W.2d 167 (Tex. App. 1999).
The importance of maintaining a proper record and ensuring the effective
review of recusal motions is underscored by the case law. In Rio Grande
Valley Gas Co., In re, the court emphasized that any order other than an
order of recusal or referral entered by a court after a proper motion to
recuse is void. The decision also highlights the importance of a proper
record and hearing; degrading the filing risks impairing the record and the
ability to review, which could be raised as due-process concerns.
4. Potential Consequences and Remedies
Procedural irregularities in the recusal process—such as the improper
transmission or alteration of recusal filings—can have serious consequences.
Parties may challenge the validity of the recusal proceedings or any
subsequent orders on the grounds that the process did not comply with
mandatory procedural requirements. Courts have held that actions taken by
a judge after a proper motion to recuse is filed, other than an order of
recusal or referral, are void, authority citation: Rio Grande Valley Gas Co., In
re, 987 S.W.2d 167 (Tex. App. 1999).
If the improper involvement of the judge or their coordinator in the
transmission or alteration of recusal documents is discovered, parties may
seek relief through mandamus or appeal, arguing that the process was
tainted by procedural irregularity and that their right to a fair and impartial
recusal process was violated. The courts may set aside any orders entered in
violation of the procedural requirements and may require the recusal
process to be conducted anew in compliance with the rules.

Exceptions and Caveats
While the rules and case law are clear in assigning the responsibility for
transmitting recusal documents to the clerk and prohibiting further action
by the respondent judge, there may be rare circumstances in which the
involvement of the judge’s staff is justified by good cause stated in writing or
on the record. However, such exceptions are narrowly construed and must
be clearly documented. The mere convenience or administrative efficiency of
using the judge’s coordinator does not constitute good cause.
Additionally, while the rules do not expressly address the issue of document
formatting (such as hyperlinks and bookmarks), the requirement that the
clerk transmit the document as filed implies that any alteration of the filing’s
format or content is impermissible. The courts have not addressed every
possible scenario involving electronic filings or document formatting, but
the principles of transparency, impartiality, and the integrity of the record
apply with equal force to electronic documents.
Conclusion
Texas law and local rules strictly require that the court clerk—not the judge
or the judge’s staff—transmit recusal motions and related orders to the
regional presiding judge. Any involvement by the judge or their coordinator
in transmitting or altering these documents violates the procedural
safeguards designed to ensure impartiality and transparency in the recusal
process. Modifying the original recusal filing, such as by splitting it into
multiple files and removing hyperlinks or bookmarks, further risks
prejudicing the parties, impeding review, and undermining the integrity of
the record. Such procedural irregularities may provide grounds for
challenging the validity of the recusal proceedings or any subsequent
orders, and courts are likely to require strict compliance with the rules to
protect the rights of the parties and the integrity of the judicial process.

Ex parte Thuesen, 546 S.W.3d 145 (Tex. Crim. App. 2017)
Texas Court of Criminal Appeals
Extract
Judge Bryan's court coordinator then notified the parties on the same day
that the judge was going forward with the recusal. ... The next day, Judge
Bryan signed a written order stating: On March 17, 2014, I withdraw my
order of voluntary recusal. ... Further, twenty years after the Dallas court
decided Dunn, the Texas Legislature passed Section 24.002 of the Texas
Government Code providing the procedure that must be followed when a
district judge voluntarily recuses himself: If a district judge determines on
the judge's own motion that the judge should not sit in a case pending in the
judge's court because the judge is disqualified or otherwise should recuse

himself or herself, the judge shall enter a recusal order, request the
presiding judge of that administrative judicial region to assign another judge
to sit, and take no further action in the case except for good cause stated in
the order in which the action is taken. ... However, Rule 18a, entitled
'Recusal and Disqualification of Judges,' provides that a ruling of the
regional presiding judge must be made in writing: 'The ruling must be by
written order.' Rule 18a(g)(2). ... Viewed in context, the written order
requirement applies to all rulings by a regional presiding judge related to
the recusal or disqualification of a judge.
Summary
The case underscores that once a judge recuses, he must request
assignment from the regional presiding judge and “take no further action”
absent good cause stated in a written order. It also clarifies that rulings by
the regional presiding judge in the recusal context must be by written order.
While the passages do not expressly address who must transmit filings
(clerk vs. coordinator) or document-format alterations, they highlight
procedural integrity, the prohibition on the recused judge’s continued
involvement, and the necessity of formal, written processes controlled by the
regional presiding judge rather than the recused judge or his staff. The
coordinator’s involvement at the behest of the recused judge—especially
actions that affect the content, structure, or readability of recusal
submissions—implicates these principles by suggesting improper
participation and potential prejudice to the parties.

Summary
The case emphasizes the mandatory, ministerial nature of a judge’s duties
upon the filing of a Rule 18a motion: the judge must either recuse or request
assignment by the presiding judge and must refrain from any further
proceedings. While the passages do not expressly discuss who must transmit
papers to the regional presiding judge or the role of a court coordinator
versus the clerk, they stress that the challenged judge must not take actions

beyond recusal or referral. Any involvement by the judge (or agents under
the judge’s direction) that goes beyond ministerial referral could be
characterized as improper “further proceedings.” The decision also
underscores the importance of a proper record and hearing; degrading the
filing (splitting, removing hyperlinks/bookmarks) risks impairing the record
and the ability to review, which could be raised as prejudice or due-process
concerns.
In re Alpert, 276 S.W.3d 592 (Tex. App. 2008)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Rule 18a(f) expressly confers the authority to reassign a case following a
recusal to the regional presiding judge of the administrative judicial
district." ... "Both the Texas Government Code and Texas Rules of Civil
Procedure vest the 'presiding judge of the administrative judicial district'
with the authority to assign a judge to hear a motion for recusal. TEX. GOV'T
CODE ANN. § 25.00255; TEX.R. CIV. P. 18a." ... "Unlike the Texas
Government Code, which is silent on the issue of who may reassign a case
after recusal is granted, the applicable Rule of Civil Procedure designates
the presiding administrative judicial district judge...to undertake that
particular task. TEX.R. CIV. P. 18a(f)." ... "We hold that Texas Rule of Civil
Procedure 18a vests the appropriate regional presiding administrative
judge...with the duty to reassign probate cases once a motion to recuse has
been granted." ... "The Texas Legislature amended section 25.00255 in 2007
to vest the presiding judge of the administrative judicial district with the
sole power to assign a judge to hear a motion for recusal.
Summary
The passages clarify that (1) only the regional presiding judge may assign a
judge to hear a recusal motion and reassign a case after recusal is granted;
(2) local or intra-court practices conflicting with Rule 18a(f) are void. While
the passages do not expressly address transmission mechanics (clerk vs.
coordinator) or document alteration, they underscore that the challenged
judge and their staff should not exercise functions allocated to the regional
presiding judge or procedures inconsistent with Rule 18a. Any involvement
by the recused judge’s personnel in substantive handling that affects the
presentation or integrity of the recusal filing risks procedural irregularity
and potential voidness if it encroaches on Rule 18a(f) functions.
Rule 9. Recusal and Disqualification

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
9.2 When a party files a motion to recuse a judge under Texas Rule of Civil
Procedure 18a, the clerk of the court must immediately deliver a copy of the
motion to the respondent judge and the Presiding Judge. 9.3 Pursuant to
Rule 18a(f)(l), a respondent judge has a duty to act on the motion within 3
business days by signing and filing with the clerk, an order of recusal or an
order referring the motion to the Presiding Judge. The clerk of the court
shall deliver a copy of the signed order to the Presiding Judge. 9.4 The
respondent judge must refer the motion, even if the motion does not comply
with Rule 18a. If the motion is filed before evidence is offered at trial, the
judge may not take any further action in the case until the motion is
resolved, except for good cause stated in writing or on the record.
Summary
The passages specify that the court clerk—not the judge or the judge’s staff
—must deliver the recusal motion and any signed order to the Presiding
Judge. They also confine the respondent judge’s role to timely signing either
a recusal order or a referral order and filing it with the clerk. The rules do
not authorize a judge or the judge’s coordinator to transmit filings to the
Presiding Judge or to alter the motion’s format. The materials do not
address document formatting or hyperlink/bookmark integrity, but the clerk-
delivery requirement implies that bypassing the clerk and altering the filing
could be noncompliant with mandated procedures.
Rule 18a. Recusal and Disqualification of Judges
Extract
By the Respondent Judge. The judge whose recusal or disqualification is
sought should not file a response to the motion. ... Duty of the Clerk.
Delivery of a Motion or Response. When a motion or response is filed, the
clerk of the court must immediately deliver a copy to the respondent judge
and to the presiding judge of the administrative judicial region in which the
court is located ('the regional presiding judge'). Delivery of Order of Recusal
or Referral. When a respondent judge signs and files an order of recusal or
referral, the clerk of the court must immediately deliver a copy to the
regional presiding judge. Duties of the Respondent Judge; Failure to Comply.
Responding to the Motion. Regardless of whether the motion complies with
this rule, the respondent judge, within three business days after the motion
is filed, must either: (A) sign and file with the clerk an order of recusal or
disqualification; or (B) sign and file with the clerk an order referring the
motion to the regional presiding judge. Restrictions on Further Action. (A)
Motion Filed Before Evidence Offered at Trial. If a motion is filed before
evidence has been offered at trial, the respondent judge must take no
further action in the case until the motion has been decided, except for good
cause stated in writing or on the record.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
The rule assigns transmission duties to the clerk, not the judge or the
judge’s staff, and directs that the respondent judge should not file a
response and must refrain from further action while the motion is pending
(with limited exceptions). It does not expressly authorize a court coordinator
to handle transmissions or alter filings. It also does not address modification
of filings’ format (hyperlinks/bookmarks), but the allocation of duties implies
the clerk should transmit the filed document as filed.
