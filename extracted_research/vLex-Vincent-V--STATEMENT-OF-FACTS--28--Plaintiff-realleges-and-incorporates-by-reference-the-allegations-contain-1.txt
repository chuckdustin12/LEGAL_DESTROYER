Question
V. STATEMENT OF FACTS 28. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by
reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 27 above, as if
fully set forth herein. A. Party References 29. For clarity and ease of
reference throughout this Complaint, the parties shall be referred to as
follows: i. Plaintiff Charles Dustin Myers shall be referred to herein as
“Plaintiff ” and is the husband of Morgan Michelle Myers. ii. Defendant
Daniel Kenneth Branthoover shall be referred to herein as “Branthoover”
and is identified as the stepfather of Defendant Morgan Michelle Myers. iii.
Defendant Morgan Michelle Myers shall be referred to herein as “Myers”
and is identified as the spouse of Plaintiff Charles Dustin Myers and
stepdaughter of Branthoover. 30. At all relevant times, Defendant Myers has
not raised any defenses to these claims in State court and has ignored all
settlement offers made in an attempt to avoid this lawsuit. 31. At all relevant
times, Defendants have maintained communications regarding the affairs of
the enterprise’s purpose. B. Formation of the Enterprise (December 14 – 15,
2023) 32. Defendant Branthoover has extensive knowledge of protective
orders given his prior criminal convictions. 33. On December 14, 2023, in
response to the discovery of an extramarital affair by the Plaintiff, Defendant
Myers opened a private bank account in her own name and began interstate
communications with Branthoover via text message. In total, Myers and
Branthoover exchanged a total of 92 text messages between Branthoover’s
number registered as 940-312-3434, and Myers’ number registered as
817-235-5189 on this date. 34. Also on December 14, 2023, Defendant
Myers, without legitimate cause or factual basis, sought an ex-parte order of
protection against Plaintiff while in communications with Branthoover. 35.
Later on the evening of December 14, 2023, in a stark contrast to her earlier
emergency request for a protective order, Defendant Myers reminded
Plaintiff of a school field trip scheduled for the following day, thereby
attempting to maintain a facade of normalcy and prevent Plaintiff from
suspecting of her fraudulent intentions. C. Deception, Transfer, and Planned
Interstate Travel (December 15–17, 2023) 36. On December 15, 2023,
Plaintiff was contacted by Branthoover at 9:51 A.M. CST, where he stated
“I’ve been where you are before. I want to help both of you” regarding a
recent divorce announcement made by Myers on December 1, 2023. 37.
During this phone conversation, it was established that Myers would visit his
residence over the weekend of December 15, 2023, located within this
district, for the purpose of “providing space” to Myers. 38. At this time, it’s
important to note that Plaintiff had no knowledge of the ex-parte attempt
made the day prior, and he had no reason to believe that Branthoover was
being dishonest about his intentions for Myers’ visit to his residence. 39.
Immediately after the call, Plaintiff received notice that Myers had
transferred $1,576 from the parties’ joint–marital PNC account to
Branthoover’s PayPal account (username “dmb575”), depleting the
account’s balance. 40. On December 16, 2023, Plaintiff received notification
that the joint marital PNC bank account was overdrawn by -$800.00.
Concurrently, Plaintiff was informed that advertisements related to his
legitimate at-home business had ceased running due to a failure of payment.
41. The PNC bank statement for December 2023 clearly documents the

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
occurrence of this transaction, demonstrating the precise date and amount
of the unauthorized withdrawal. 42. The PayPal identifier “dmb575” directly
matches the information associated with the fraudulent transfer on
Plaintiff’s bank statement for December of 2023, linking Defendant
Branthoover to the illicit financial maneuver notwithstanding his admissions
via text message. 43. On December 16, 2023, at precisely 3:54 P.M. Central
Standard Time, Plaintiff, to mitigate the financial damage and resolve the
situation amicably, sent a text message to Defendant Branthoover. In this
message, Plaintiff explicitly requested the return of the $1,576.00 that had
been fraudulently transferred, detailing the intended use of the funds, the
late bills resulting from misappropriation, his inability to work due to the
severe mental anguish caused by the Defendants’ actions, and his sincere
desire for an amicable resolution given the time of year. 44. In a callous and
dismissive response to Plaintiff’s plea, Defendant Branthoover informed
Plaintiff via text message that “You Are Getting Divorced” and further
stated, “I hope I can help with the paperwork and make things go as
smoothly as possible.” This communication, far from helping as initially
stated by Branthoover, served as a direct threat and an overt act in
furtherance of the conspiracy, demonstrating Branthoover’s intent to exploit
Plaintiff’s distress for the benefit of the enterprise. 45. At no time relevant to
this Complaint has Defendant Branthoover possessed a license to practice
law in any state within the United States. In subsequent texts, his
statements regarding “paperwork” and making things “go as smoothly as
possible” constituted the unauthorized practice of law and that he held an
administrative role over the affairs of the enterprise. D. Eviction Attempt
Influenced by Myers in Furtherance of the Scheme (December 17–22, 2023)
46. On December 17, 2023, at approximately 11:00 A.M., Plaintiff was
served with an eviction notice by the grandmother of Myers, which
contained the following false information: i. A purported “lease violation,”
which was entirely fabricated as no valid lease agreement existed between
Plaintiff and Wilson; ii. The assertion that “Granddaughter getting divorced,”
referring to Defendant Myers, as a basis for eviction; iii. The false claim that
a “Protective order has been filed.” iv. The directive that “He must leave.
She and the girls may stay,” demonstrating the clear intent to dispossess
Plaintiff for the benefit of Myers. 47. Defendant Myers was physically
present in Oklahoma with Defendant Branthoover, actively collaborating in
the drafting of the very documents referenced in the frivolous eviction
notice, thereby demonstrating clear premeditation and coordination of the
scheme. 48. Defendant Myers possessed actual knowledge that no valid
lease agreement existed, and on December 17, 2023, Myers herself
physically tore the fraudulent eviction notice in half and wrote “VOID” on
the document in black sharpie, showing her influence over the attempt. E. A
Narrative of Protection, Secondary Phone, and Initiation of Suit 49.
Defendant Myers also returned from Oklahoma with a can of pepper spray
mace to further the narrative of protection first established on December 14,
2023, in her ex-parte attempt. 50. On the evening of December 17, 2023,
Defendant Morgan Michelle Myers explicitly disclosed to Plaintiff Charles
Dustin Myers that she had acquired a secondary phone number while in
Oklahoma, registered under the number 817-940-0852. This acquisition was
a deliberate act of concealment and an overt act in furtherance of the
enterprise, designed to facilitate clandestine communications related to the
fraudulent scheme. 51. This newly acquired phone number (817-940-0852)

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
was subsequently used on a series of fraudulent legal documents prepared
under the direct administrative oversight of Defendant Branthoover, with his
full knowledge and participation. These documents, which were prepared in
Oklahoma and designed to unlawfully influence legal proceedings in Texas,
included: i. An “Original Petition for Divorce,” dated December 18, 2023,
which contained numerous false statements. ii. An “Affidavit of Indigency,”
dated December 18, 2023, which contained material misrepresentations
regarding Defendant Myers’ financial status. iii. A “Request for Uncontested
Cases,” dated December 18, 2023, which was filed despite Plaintiff not
conversing with defendant Myers regarding any divorce litigation. iv. An
“Application for Protective Order,” dated December 22, 2023, which was
based on fabricated allegations of family violence. F. Continued Obstruction
and Unauthorized Practice of Law 52. After the initial divorce paperwork
was filed on December 18, 2023, Defendant Branthoover, continuing his
unauthorized practice of law and his role in the conspiracy, sent a text
message to Plaintiff stating: “Charlie, it’s come to my understanding you
have retained an attorney. I’m sure he has told you that all further
communication should take place between attorneys. I must formally ask
you refrain from discussing details of this case with my client moving
forward and only communicate with me or your attorney.” (emphasis added)
This communication was a deliberate attempt to isolate Plaintiff from direct
communication with Myers and to control the flow of information, thereby
hindering Plaintiff’s ability to uncover the full extent of the fraudulent
scheme. This communication also evidences that Branthoover’s role went
beyond helping Myers prepare the documents by seeing them through to
their submission and asserted an administrative role over the proceedings in
an attempt to intimidate Plaintiff. G. Service by US Marshall 53. In
furtherance of the scheme, and despite still cohabitating with Plaintiff,
defendant Myers knowingly and intentionally utilized the United States
Marshall Service to effectuate service of the misleading documents on
Plaintiff, thereby using an instrumentality of interstate commerce to further
the illicit enterprise, which occurred on December 27, 2023. 54. In
furtherance of the scheme, and despite living next-door to Plaintiff,
defendant Myers knowingly and intentionally influenced an eviction
proceeding and utilized the United States Marshall Service to effectuate
service of the misleading documents on Plaintiff, which occurred on
December 28, 2023. H. False Statements – Divorce Petition and Affidavit of
Indigency (Dec. 18, 2023) 55. When reviewing the documents prepared in
part by Branthoover and filed with the court by Myers, there existed several
false statements and were intended to deceive the court and prejudice
Plaintiff in furtherance of the scheme to dispose him of his property
interests. Specifically, these false statements included, but were not limited
to: i. The assertion that the spouses had ceased living together on December
1, 2023, when in fact they were still residing together at the marital home
on that date and for several weeks thereafter. ii. The claim that Defendant
Myers owned both family vehicles as her separate property prior to the
marriage, which was demonstrably false as these vehicles were acquired
during the marriage and constituted community property, paid for by
Plaintiff. iii. The representation that Defendant Myers had an active order of
protection against Plaintiff with a judicial finding that family violence had
occurred during the marriage, which was fabricated and without any basis
in fact or law. iv. The assertion that the children or Defendant Myers would

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
be subjected to harassment or abuse if Plaintiff were provided with her
second phone number (817-940-0852) acquired in Oklahoma, which was a
baseless and manipulative claim designed to conceal her communications
related to the fraudulent scheme. 56. Concurrently with the fraudulent
divorce petition, Defendant Myers, again with the administrative oversight
and full knowledge of Defendant Branthoover, filed a fraudulent “Affidavit of
Indigency” with the court. This affidavit contained material
misrepresentations regarding Defendant Myers’ financial status, all of which
were known to be false at the time of filing and were intended to defraud the
court and avoid legitimate court costs. Specifically, these false statements
included, but were not limited to: i. The claim that Defendant Myers was
financially indigent and unable to pay court costs, despite her access to and
control over substantial marital assets. ii. The representation that Defendant
Myers was solely responsible for all family living expenses, including rent,
utilities, food, and other living expenses, when in fact, Plaintiff was the
primary breadwinner of the household at that time. iii. The assertion that
Defendant Myers was solely responsible for both car payments, which she
has no payment history to support such a claim. I. False Statements –
Application for Protective Order (Dec. 22, 2023) 57. Defendant was served
with an Application for a Protective Order on December 22, 2023, filed by
Myers, despite her claim to already have an existing order in her Original
Petition for Divorce. 58. Upon review, defendant Myers made additional
false statements within the sworn document, all intended to further deceive
the court and secure an unwarranted protective order against Plaintiff to
effectuate the enterprises’ goal of divesting him of his property interests.
These false statements included, but were not limited to: i. The claim that
family violence occurred on December 18, 2023, in the presence of the
children, which was entirely false and fabricated. ii. The assertion that
family violence occurred prior to December 18, 2023, which was also false
and without any factual basis. iii. The request that Plaintiff take a battering
intervention program. J. A Clear Objective 59. The common and overarching
objectives shared among Defendant Myers when reviewing these documents
(through the administration and direction of Defendant Branthoover) and
with the active participation of Myers’ grandmother, were multifaceted:
primarily, to unlawfully remove Plaintiff from his residence, which was
essential for his livelihood and the family’s financial well-being; secondarily,
to gain an unfair and illicit advantage in the ongoing divorce proceedings
between Plaintiff and Defendant Myers; and ultimately, to finalize the
divorce on terms unilaterally favorable to Defendant Myers, thereby making
the unlawful deprivation of Plaintiff’s rights and property permanent and to
escape accountability for the conduct alleged herein. K. Primary Objective
Success 60. On January 16, 2024, the parties appeared before the 322nd
District Court of Tarrant County, and the initial objective of the Defendants’
scheme succeeded when Plaintiff was ordered to vacate the family home
without any findings or without a hearing taking place. 61. The significance
of the misinformation presented to the court could have been the only
reason for this decision, and it afforded Myers the advantage that she and
Branthoover had anticipated. K. Pattern of Racketeering Activity and
Continuity 62. Between January 16, 2024, and the present day, Defendants
Myers and Branthoover have continued to further their racketeering activity
through a series of ongoing illicit acts, demonstrating a clear pattern of
continuity and relatedness. These acts include, but are not limited to: i.

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Myers and Branthoover continuing to engage in illicit communications
regarding case details between one another across state lines, specifically
between Texas and Oklahoma, in direct furtherance of their fraudulent
scheme to see the divorce through to its’ finalization. ii. Branthoover
delivering ongoing threats and intimidation to Plaintiff regarding his
legitimate attempts to seek legal relief from the orders that were a product
of the Defendants’ actions, which occurred in December of 2023, June of
2024, December of 2024, and May of 2025. iii. Making direct statements
such as “I’ve been enjoying watching every filing get denied” by
Branthoover, showing the malicious intent behind his involvement. 63. On
June 23, 2024, Defendant Branthoover, continuing his pattern of harassment
and intimidation, sent a text message to Plaintiff stating, “Lol. And here
comes another denial,” in direct reference to a pleading filed in the Texas
State courts by Plaintiff seeking to enjoin Branthoover as a party to the
divorce proceedings. This communication demonstrates Branthoover’s
awareness of and continued involvement in the legal proceedings and his
malicious intent to mock Plaintiff’s efforts to seek justice. 64. On December
12, 2024, Defendant Branthoover sent a text message to Plaintiff explicitly
threatening future action by stating, “When things all over you get to deal
with me. Just a heads up.” This communication constitutes a direct threat of
future harm and further evidence of the Defendants’ future threat of
criminal activity. 65. On May 24, 2025, Defendant Branthoover sent a text
message to Plaintiff containing a direct and severe threat, stating, “Where’s
my lawsuit? Heard your vm about me. File it. Let’s do this :)” This malicious
communication is a clear act of intimidation and further evidence of the
Defendants’ collaboration throughout the proceedings with Defendant
Myers. What predicate acts have been violated based on this statement of
facts?
Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
Based on the statement of facts, multiple predicate acts under RICO have
been violated, including wire fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343), mail fraud (18 U.S.C.
§ 1341), obstruction of justice (18 U.S.C. § 1512), interference with
commerce by threats (18 U.S.C. § 1951), and conspiracy to commit these
offenses.
Summary
The statement of facts presents a coordinated scheme between Defendants
Myers and Branthoover that constitutes a pattern of racketeering activity
under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). This
pattern includes multiple predicate acts committed over a period from
December 2023 through May 2025, demonstrating both open-ended and
closed-ended continuity required for a RICO violation. The enterprise
formed by the defendants used interstate communications, fraudulent legal
filings, unauthorized financial transactions, and intimidation tactics to
deprive the Plaintiff of property and rights.

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
The predicate acts include wire fraud through interstate text messages and
financial transfers, mail fraud through fraudulent court documents,
obstruction of justice through false statements to courts, unauthorized
practice of law, and interference with commerce through threats and
extortion. These acts were part of a coordinated enterprise with specific
objectives—to remove the Plaintiff from his residence, gain unfair advantage
in divorce proceedings, and finalize the divorce on terms favorable to
Defendant Myers—all while using instrumentalities of interstate commerce
to further their scheme.
Background and Relevant Law
The RICO Framework
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) provides
both criminal penalties and civil remedies for specific patterns of illegal
activity. Under 18 U.S.C. § 1961, "racketeering activity" encompasses
various federal and state offenses, including "any act which is indictable
under any of the following provisions of title 18, United States Code: Section
201 (relating to bribery), section 224 (relating to sports bribery), sections
471, 472, and 473 (relating to counterfeiting), section 659 (relating to theft
from interstate shipment)... section 1341 (relating to mail fraud), section
1343 (relating to wire fraud), section 1344 (relating to financial institution
fraud)... section 1503 (relating to obstruction of justice), section 1510
(relating to obstruction of criminal investigations)... section 1512 (relating to
tampering with a witness, victim, or an informant), section 1513 (relating to
retaliating against a witness, victim, or an informant)... section 1951
(relating to interference with commerce, robbery, or extortion), section 1952
(relating to racketeering)..."
For a successful RICO claim, several elements must be established. As noted
in Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy (2024), "A violation of § 1962(c)... requires
(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity. The plaintiff must allege each of the elements to state a claim. They
are all equally essential components, and the complaint will fail if any one of
them is not adequately pleaded."
The concept of an "enterprise" under RICO is broadly interpreted. According
to RICO: A Primer (2022), "A RICO enterprise includes 'any individual,
partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or
group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.' Courts
have interpreted 'enterprise' broadly, and the definition captures both
legitimate and illegitimate enterprises."
A "pattern of racketeering activity" requires at least two predicate acts
occurring within ten years of each other. As explained in RICO: A Primer
(2022), "A 'pattern' may exist where any combination of two or more
offenses occurred within a period of time... A plaintiff may demonstrate a
pattern by establishment that the predicate acts pose a threat of continued
criminal activity, which is generally demonstrated by showing either: Closed-
ended continuity. Proving 'a series of related predicate acts extending over a

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
substantial period of time.' Open-ended continuity. A threat of 'continuing
criminal activity extending indefinitely into the future,' in light of the nature
of the enterprise and predicate acts alleged."
RICO prohibits four types of activities as outlined in Defending Civil RICO
Claims: A Defense Plan Should Be In Every Business's Arsenal (2022):
"* Section 1962(a) prohibits a person from investing in an enterprise any
income derived from a pattern of racketeering activity;
Section 1962(b) prohibits a person from using a pattern of racketeering
activity to acquire or maintain control over an enterprise;
Section 1962(c) prohibits a person from conducting the affairs of an
enterprise through a pattern of racketeering;
Section 1962(d) prohibits a person from conspiring to violate Sections
1962(a), (b), or (c)."
Key Predicate Acts Under RICO
Wire Fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343)
Under 18 U.S.C. § 1343, "Whoever, having devised or intending to devise any
scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means
of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, transmits or
causes to be transmitted by means of wire, radio, or television
communication in interstate or foreign commerce, any writings, signs,
signals, pictures, or sounds for the purpose of executing such scheme or
artifice, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years,
or both."
Mail Fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1341)
18 U.S.C. § 1341 states, "Whoever, having devised or intending to devise any
scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means
of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises... for the
purpose of executing such scheme or artifice or attempting so to do, places
in any post office or authorized depository for mail matter, any matter or
thing whatever to be sent or delivered by the Postal Service, or deposits or
causes to be deposited any matter or thing whatever to be sent or delivered
by any private or commercial interstate carrier... shall be fined under this
title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both."
Tampering with a Witness, Victim, or an Informant (18 U.S.C. § 1512)
18 U.S.C. § 1512 prohibits the use of "physical force or the threat of physical
force against any person, or attempts to do so, with intent to- (A) influence,
delay, or prevent the testimony of any person in an official proceeding; (B)
cause or induce any person to- (i) withhold testimony, or withhold a record,
document, or other object, from an official proceeding; (ii) alter, destroy,
mutilate, or conceal an object with intent to impair the integrity or
availability of the object for use in an official proceeding; (iii) evade legal
process summoning that person to appear as a witness, or to produce a
•

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
record, document, or other object, in an official proceeding; or (iv) be absent
from an official proceeding to which that person has been summoned by
legal process; or (C) hinder, delay, or prevent the communication to a law
enforcement officer or judge of the United States of information relating to
the commission or possible commission of a Federal offense..."
Interference with Commerce by Threats or Violence (18 U.S.C. §
1951)
18 U.S.C. § 1951 provides that "Whoever in any way or degree obstructs,
delays, or affects commerce or the movement of any article or commodity in
commerce, by robbery or extortion or attempts or conspires so to do, or
commits or threatens physical violence to any person or property in
furtherance of a plan or purpose to do anything in violation of this section
shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than twenty years, or
both."
Conspiracy (18 U.S.C. § 371)
18 U.S.C. § 371 states, "If two or more persons conspire either to commit
any offense against the United States, or to defraud the United States, or
any agency thereof in any manner or for any purpose, and one or more of
such persons do any act to effect the object of the conspiracy, each shall be
fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both."
RICO Conspiracy (18 U.S.C. § 1962(d))
18 U.S.C. § 1962 establishes that "It shall be unlawful for any person
through a pattern of racketeering activity or through collection of an
unlawful debt to acquire or maintain, directly or indirectly, any interest in or
control of any enterprise which is engaged in, or the activities of which
affect, interstate or foreign commerce."
According to Insurance Fraud is a Violent Crime (2024), "RICO conspiracy
was established by proof of: (a) of an agreement to join a racketeering
scheme, (b) of the defendant's knowing engagement in the scheme with the
intent that its overall goals be effectuated, and (c) that the scheme involved,
or by agreement between any members of the conspiracy was intended to
involve, two or more predicate acts of racketeering."
Analysis of Predicate Acts in the Statement of
Facts
Enterprise Formation and Structure
The statement of facts demonstrates the formation and operation of an
enterprise involving Defendants Myers and Branthoover. This enterprise
meets the definition under RICO as a "group of individuals associated in
fact" whose activities affect interstate commerce through their

=== PAGE 9 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
communications between Texas and Oklahoma and financial transactions
involving interstate banking systems.
Paragraph 31 establishes that "At all relevant times, Defendants have
maintained communications regarding the affairs of the enterprise's
purpose," directly addressing the enterprise element of RICO. The
coordinated actions between Myers and Branthoover, along with Myers'
grandmother, show a structured relationship aimed at accomplishing
specific objectives outlined in paragraph 59.
Wire Fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343)
Multiple instances of wire fraud are evident in the statement of facts:
Interstate Text Messages: Paragraph 33 states that "Myers and
Branthoover exchanged a total of 92 text messages" on December 14,
2023. These communications traversed state lines between Texas and
Oklahoma and were in furtherance of their scheme to defraud Plaintiff.
Fraudulent Financial Transaction: Paragraphs 39-42 detail that "Myers
had transferred $1,576 from the parties' joint–marital PNC account to
Branthoover's PayPal account (username "dmb575")." This electronic
transfer constitutes wire fraud as it used interstate wires to execute a
scheme to fraudulently obtain money.
Continued Interstate Communications: Paragraph 62 notes that "Myers
and Branthoover continuing to engage in illicit communications
regarding case details between one another across state lines,
specifically between Texas and Oklahoma, in direct furtherance of their
fraudulent scheme to see the divorce through to its' finalization."
Threatening Text Messages: Paragraphs 63-65 document a series of
threatening text messages from Branthoover to Plaintiff from June 2024
through May 2025. These messages, such as "When things all over you
get to deal with me. Just a heads up" and "Where's my lawsuit? Heard
your vm about me. File it. Let's do this :)" were transmitted via
interstate wire communications and served to intimidate Plaintiff as
part of the ongoing scheme.
These actions satisfy all elements of wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343: the
defendants devised a scheme to defraud, they utilized interstate wire
communications, and they did so with the intent to execute their fraudulent
scheme.
Mail Fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1341)
The statement of facts reveals actions constituting mail fraud:
Fraudulent Legal Documents: Paragraph 51 details that Myers and
Branthoover prepared "fraudulent legal documents" in Oklahoma
"designed to unlawfully influence legal proceedings in Texas." These
documents included an "Original Petition for Divorce," "Affidavit of
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
1. 

=== PAGE 10 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Indigency," "Request for Uncontested Cases," and "Application for
Protective Order," all containing false statements.
Use of U.S. Marshal Service: Paragraphs 53-54 state that "Myers
knowingly and intentionally utilized the United States Marshall Service
to effectuate service of the misleading documents on Plaintiff." This use
of an interstate carrier to deliver fraudulent documents falls squarely
within the definition of mail fraud.
False Statements in Court Documents: Paragraphs 55-58 detail
numerous false statements in legal documents filed with the court,
showing the fraudulent nature of these communications.
These actions fulfill the requirements of mail fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1341:
the defendants devised a scheme to defraud, they caused documents to be
delivered by an interstate carrier (U.S. Marshal Service), and they did so
with the intent to execute their fraudulent scheme.
Tampering with a Witness, Victim, or an Informant (18
U.S.C. § 1512)
Several actions in the statement of facts constitute witness tampering:
Isolation Attempt: Paragraph 52 describes how Branthoover sent a text
message to Plaintiff stating: "Charlie, it's come to my understanding
you have retained an attorney. I'm sure he has told you that all further
communication should take place between attorneys. I must formally
ask you refrain from discussing details of this case with my client
moving forward and only communicate with me or your attorney." This
was "a deliberate attempt to isolate Plaintiff from direct communication
with Myers and to control the flow of information, thereby hindering
Plaintiff's ability to uncover the full extent of the fraudulent scheme."
Intimidation and Threats: Paragraphs 63-65 document threatening
messages from Branthoover, including "When things all over you get to
deal with me. Just a heads up." These threats were designed to
influence Plaintiff's actions in ongoing legal proceedings.
These actions align with the elements of witness tampering under 18 U.S.C.
§ 1512, as they involve attempts to influence, delay, or prevent testimony
and communication related to official proceedings through intimidation and
threats.
Interference with Commerce by Threats or Violence (18
U.S.C. § 1951)
The defendants' actions constitute interference with commerce through
extortion:
Unauthorized Fund Transfer: The transfer of $1,576 from the joint
marital account to Branthoover's PayPal account (paragraphs 39-42)
affected commerce and the Plaintiff's business operations, as evidenced
2.

=== PAGE 11 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
by paragraph 40: "advertisements related to his legitimate at-home
business had ceased running due to a failure of payment."
Threats and Intimidation: Branthoover's threatening messages and
actions were designed to extort compliance from Plaintiff and gain
advantage in the legal proceedings, which directly affected Plaintiff's
property interests and business.
Eviction Notice: The fraudulent eviction notice (paragraph 46) sought
to deprive Plaintiff of his residence, "which was essential for his
livelihood and the family's financial well-being" (paragraph 59).
These actions satisfy the elements of 18 U.S.C. § 1951, as they obstructed,
delayed, or affected commerce through extortionate means.
Conspiracy (18 U.S.C. § 371 and 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d))
The statement of facts provides clear evidence of conspiracy:
Agreement to Join Racketeering Scheme: Paragraph 31 establishes that
"Defendants have maintained communications regarding the affairs of
the enterprise's purpose," demonstrating an agreement to participate
in the scheme.
Joint Planning and Coordination: Paragraph 47 states that "Defendant
Myers was physically present in Oklahoma with Defendant Branthoover,
actively collaborating in the drafting of the very documents referenced
in the frivolous eviction notice, thereby demonstrating clear
premeditation and coordination of the scheme."
Shared Objectives: Paragraph 59 details the "common and overarching
objectives" of the defendants, showing their agreement on the goals of
the enterprise.
Overt Acts in Furtherance: Multiple acts were undertaken to effect the
objectives of the conspiracy, including the filing of fraudulent
documents, unauthorized financial transactions, and use of interstate
communications.
These facts establish both a general conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. § 371 and a
RICO conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d), as they demonstrate an
agreement to join a racketeering scheme, knowing engagement with intent
to effectuate the scheme's goals, and involvement of multiple predicate acts
of racketeering.
Pattern of Racketeering Activity
The statement of facts demonstrates both closed-ended and open-ended
continuity required for a pattern of racketeering activity:
Closed-ended Continuity: The predicate acts extended from December
14, 2023, to May 24, 2025—approximately 18 months—which
constitutes "a substantial period of time" under RICO jurisprudence.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Open-ended Continuity: The nature of the threats in 2025 ("When
things all over you get to deal with me. Just a heads up.") shows a
threat of continuing criminal activity extending into the future.
Multiple Predicate Acts: The facts detail numerous predicate acts,
including wire fraud, mail fraud, witness tampering, and interference
with commerce, far exceeding the minimum requirement of two
predicate acts.
Relatedness: All predicate acts were related to the same enterprise and
scheme, aimed at depriving Plaintiff of property rights and gaining
advantage in divorce proceedings.
Civil RICO in Divorce Context
While RICO claims in divorce cases are generally challenging, this case
appears to meet the criteria outlined in Racketeer influenced and corrupt
organizations (2007): "(i) the plaintiff must show an injury to business or
property because of the divorce proceedings; (ii) the plaintiff must show that
the defendant acted as part of an enterprise to further the act of hiding
assets to minimize divorce settlements; and (iii) there must be either
multiple violations of the same predicate act, or the commission of more
than one predicate act."
The facts demonstrate injury to Plaintiff's property and business (paragraphs
39-40, 60), action as part of an enterprise to manipulate divorce proceedings
(paragraphs 31, 47, 59), and multiple predicate acts as analyzed above.
Exceptions and Caveats
Jurisdictional Requirements
For RICO to apply, the enterprise's activities must affect interstate
commerce. As noted in Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy (2024), "RICO requires
no more than a slight effect upon interstate commerce. Even a minimal
effect on interstate commerce satisfies this jurisdictional requirement." The
interstate communications between Texas and Oklahoma and the use of
interstate banking systems likely satisfy this requirement.
Pleading Standards
RICO claims based on mail or wire fraud must meet heightened pleading
standards. According to Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy (2024), "RICO claims
based on mail or wire fraud must comport with Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 9(b)'s requirement that allegations involving fraud be pleaded
with particularity." The statement of facts appears to provide the necessary
specificity, including dates, times, and content of communications.

Statute of Limitations
According to Crimes (2021), "In a substantive Racketeer Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) prosecution, the five-year statute of
limitations begins from the date of the last predicate act in which the
defendant personally participated." Since the most recent predicate act in
the statement of facts occurred on May 24, 2025 (paragraph 65), and the
current date is June 19, 2025, the case is within the statute of limitations.
Conclusion
Based on the statement of facts provided, multiple predicate acts have been
violated under the RICO framework:
Wire Fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343): Through interstate text messages and
electronic fund transfers in furtherance of a scheme to defraud.
Mail Fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1341): Through the preparation and filing of
fraudulent legal documents and the use of interstate carriers to deliver
them.
Tampering with a Witness, Victim, or an Informant (18 U.S.C. § 1512):
Through attempts to isolate the Plaintiff and impede communication, as
well as through threats designed to influence Plaintiff's actions in
ongoing legal proceedings.
Interference with Commerce by Threats or Violence (18 U.S.C. § 1951):
Through extortionate activities that affected Plaintiff's business and
property interests.
Conspiracy (18 U.S.C. § 371 and 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d)): Through
agreement and coordination between the defendants to carry out the
racketeering scheme.
These predicate acts were committed as part of an enterprise involving
Myers and Branthoover, with a clear pattern of racketeering activity
displaying both closed-ended continuity (occurring over approximately 18
months) and open-ended continuity (with threats of future harm). The
enterprise's activities affected interstate commerce through communications
between Texas and Oklahoma and the use of interstate banking systems.
The coordinated scheme had specific objectives: to remove Plaintiff from his
residence, gain unfair advantage in divorce proceedings, and finalize the
divorce on terms favorable to Defendant Myers—all while depriving Plaintiff
of his property rights. The multiple predicate acts committed in furtherance
of these objectives constitute violations of RICO, potentially giving rise to
both criminal penalties under 18 U.S.C. § 1963 and civil remedies under 18
U.S.C. § 1964.

NO. 12-03177, CASE NO: 10-33878 (Bankr. S.D. Tex. Aug 20, 2013)
U.S. Bankruptcy Court — Southern District of Texas
Extract
To show a violation of § 1962(c) a plaintiff must show: (1) the existence of an
enterprise that affects interstate or foreign commerce, (2) that the
defendant was employed by or associated with the enterprise, (3) that the
defendant was involved in conducting the enterprise's affairs, and (4) that
defendant's participation in the enterprise was through a pattern of
racketeering activity.
Summary
Elements required to establish a violation of § 1962(c) of the RICO Act,
which involves proving the existence of an enterprise affecting interstate
commerce, the defendant's association with the enterprise, their
involvement in conducting the enterprise's affairs, and their participation
through a pattern of racketeering activity. This framework is relevant to the
question as it provides the criteria for identifying predicate acts under RICO.

from racketeering activity or unlawful debt collection in violation of section
1962.
Summary
Penalties for such violations, including fines, imprisonment, and forfeiture of
property. The statement of facts provided suggests potential violations of
section 1962 due to the alleged fraudulent activities and conspiracy to
deprive the plaintiff of property and rights.
18 U.S.C. § 1956 18 U.S.C. § 1956 Laundering of Monetary Instruments
Extract

Extract
Within the field of family law, civil RICO claims have been attempted in
divorce cases, but most plaintiffs have been unsuccessful. However, a claim
by a woman that her ex-husband, along with the other defendants,
participated in a fraudulent scheme to conceal the true value of his income
during the couple's divorce proceedings has twice survived motions for
summary judgment. At least one commentator believes it is possible for a
RICO action to be successfully litigated in the area of divorce if it meets the
following criteria: (i) the plaintiff must show an injury to business or
property because of the divorce proceedings; (ii) the plaintiff must show that
the defendant acted as part of an enterprise to further the act of hiding
assets to minimize divorce settlements; and (iii) there must be either
multiple violations of the same...
Summary
Civil RICO claims in divorce cases are challenging but possible if certain
criteria are met. The criteria include showing an injury to business or
property due to the divorce, demonstrating that the defendant acted as part
of an enterprise to hide assets, and identifying multiple violations of the
same nature. This is relevant to the question as it provides a framework for
understanding how RICO claims might be applicable in the context of the
statement of facts provided.

part of an enterprise to further the act of hiding assets to minimize divorce
settlements; and (iii) there must be either multiple violations of the same
predicate act, or the commission of more than one predicate act.
Summary
A RICO action in the context of divorce can be pursued if there is an injury
to business or property, the defendant acted as part of an enterprise to hide
assets, and there are multiple violations of predicate acts. The statement of
facts provided in the question outlines a series of actions that could
potentially meet these criteria, such as fraudulent financial transactions,
unauthorized practice of law, and false statements in legal documents.

as 'Any act or threat involving murder, kidnapping, gambling, arson,
robbery, bribery, extortion, dealing in obscene matter, or dealing in a
controlled substance or listed chemical... which is chargeable under State
law and punishable by imprisonment for more than one year.' Id. at (1)(A).

Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy
The Brief - American Bar Association - 2024-01-01
Extract
A violation of § 1962(c), the section on which Sedima relies, requires (1)
conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity. The plaintiff must allege each of the elements to state a claim. They
are all equally essential components, and the complaint will fail if any one of
them is not adequately pleaded. In particular, RICO claims based on mail or
wire fraud must comport with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b)’s
requirement that allegations involving fraud be pleaded with particularity.
The practitioner through their pleadings must articulate with great care and
attention a viable racketeering claim. In addition, § 1962(a), (b), and (c) are
limited in scope to conduct involving enterprises engaged in or the activities
of which affect interstate commerce. It is the activities of the enterprise, not
each predicate act, that must affect interstate or foreign commerce. RICO
requires no more than a slight effect upon interstate commerce. Even a
minimal effect on interstate commerce satisfies this jurisdictional
requirement.
Summary
Elements required to establish a RICO claim under § 1962(c), which includes
conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. It
emphasizes the need for allegations involving fraud to be pleaded with
particularity and highlights the requirement for the enterprise's activities to
affect interstate commerce. This is relevant to the question as it provides a
framework for identifying potential predicate acts in the statement of facts.

Extract
RICO conspiracy was established by proof of: (a) of an agreement to join a
racketeering scheme, (b) of the defendant's knowing engagement in the
scheme with the intent that its overall goals be effectuated, and (c) that the
scheme involved, or by agreement between any members of the conspiracy
was intended to involve, two or more predicate acts of racketeering.

Summary
A RICO conspiracy involves an agreement to engage in a racketeering
scheme, knowing engagement with intent to effectuate the scheme's goals,
and the involvement of two or more predicate acts of racketeering. The
statement of facts provided describes a series of actions that could
potentially be considered predicate acts under RICO, such as extortion,
fraud, and obstruction of justice, which are part of a larger pattern of
racketeering activity.
PAYORS, PLAYERS, AND PROXIMATE CAUSE.
Notre Dame Law Review - University of Notre Dame Law School -
Crusey, Elisabeth F. - 2022-05-01
Extract
RICO is not just a tool for government control over organized crime. It is
also a remedial statute for civil matters. (31) It 'authorize[s]... criminal or
civil remedies on conduct already criminal, when performed in a specified
fashion' as delineated by the statute. (32) Section 1962 provides civil
remedies for four types of conduct: (1) using income derived from a pattern
of racketeering activity (33) to acquire an interest in an enterprise; (2)
acquiring or maintaining an interest in an enterprise through a pattern of
racketeering activity; (3) conducting the affairs of an enterprise through a
pattern of racketeering activity; and (4) conspiring to commit any of these
offenses. (34)
Summary
RICO addresses conduct involving a pattern of racketeering activity, which
includes using income derived from such activity, acquiring or maintaining
an interest in an enterprise through such activity, conducting the affairs of
an enterprise through such activity, and conspiring to commit any of these
offenses. The statement of facts provided in the question suggests a pattern
of racketeering activity involving fraud, unauthorized practice of law, and
conspiracy to defraud the plaintiff, which could potentially fall under the
conduct described in Section 1962 of RICO.

Extract
In a substantive Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO)
prosecution, the five-year statute of limitations begins from the date of the

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
last predicate act in which the defendant personally participated, not the
date of the last predicate act committed by the enterprise as a whole. State
must specifically plead a RICO conspiracy if it intends to charge a defendant
accordingly. In a RICO conspiracy, the crime is premised not upon the
commission of the predicate acts of racketeering, or even an agreement to
commit predicate acts, but upon an agreement to participate in the affairs of
the criminal enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity.
Summary
For a RICO charge, the focus is on the agreement to participate in the affairs
of a criminal enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. This
means that the predicate acts themselves are not the sole focus; rather, it is
the pattern and the agreement to engage in such a pattern that is crucial.
The passage also highlights the importance of the statute of limitations and
the need for specific pleading of a RICO conspiracy.
RICO: A Primer
Extract
The heart of a RICO case is the existence of a pattern of racketeering
activity. Under the statute, 'racketeering activity' includes a host of offenses.
Section 1961 defines the phrase to include any crime listed in subdivisions
A, B, C, D, E, F, or G of section 1961... A RICO enterprise includes 'any
individual, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, and
any union or group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal
entity.' Courts have interpreted 'enterprise' broadly, and the definition
captures both legitimate and illegitimate enterprises... There are four
separate and distinct RICO violations set out in section 1962: (a) acquiring
or operating an enterprise using racketeering proceeds; (b) controlling an
enterprise using racketeering activities; (c) conducting the affairs of an
enterprise using racketeering activities; and (d) conspiring to so acquire,
control, or conduct.
Summary
General overview of what constitutes racketeering activity under RICO,
including the definition of an enterprise and the different types of RICO
violations under section 1962. It explains that a pattern of racketeering
activity is central to a RICO case and that an enterprise can be any group of
individuals associated in fact. The passage also outlines the four types of
RICO violations, which involve using racketeering proceeds, controlling an
enterprise through racketeering, conducting enterprise affairs through
racketeering, and conspiring to commit these acts.

captures both legitimate and illegitimate enterprises... A 'pattern' may exist
where any combination of two or more offenses occurred within a period of
time... A plaintiff may demonstrate a pattern by establishment that the
predicate acts pose a threat of continued criminal activity, which is generally
demonstrated by showing either: * Closed-ended continuity. Proving 'a series
of related predicate acts extending over a substantial period of time.' *
Open-ended continuity. A threat of 'continuing criminal activity extending
indefinitely into the future,' in light of the nature of the enterprise and
predicate acts alleged.
Summary
General understanding of what constitutes racketeering activity under the
RICO statute, which includes a wide range of offenses. It also explains the
concept of a RICO enterprise and the requirement of a pattern of
racketeering activity, which can be demonstrated through either closed-
ended or open-ended continuity. This information is essential for identifying
potential predicate acts in the statement of facts provided.
Defending Civil RICO Claims: A Defense Plan Should Be In Every Business's
Arsenal
Extract
RICO is not a simple statute. It pertains to conduct associated with an
'enterprise' and 'a pattern racketeering activity.' An enterprise is an
individual or legal entity, or a union or group of individuals associated in fact
although not a legal entity, while a pattern of racketeering activity requires
long-term, organized conduct to violate state and federal laws. There are
four types of activities outlawed by RICO, and claims under Section 1962(c)
are the most commonly asserted: * Section 1962(a) prohibits a person from
investing in an enterprise any income derived from a pattern of racketeering
activity; * Section 1962(b) prohibits a person from using a pattern of
racketeering activity to acquire or maintain control over an enterprise; *
Section 1962(c) prohibits a person from conducting the affairs of an
enterprise through a pattern of racketeering; and * Section 1962(d)
prohibits a person from conspiring to violate Sections 1962(a), (b), or (c).
