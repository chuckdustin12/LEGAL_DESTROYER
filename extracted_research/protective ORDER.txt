Question
Petitioner has repeatedly claimed the existence of an “active protective
order” with a finding of family violence, despite the record showing no such
finding and the protective order proceeding being nonsuited. Texas Family
Code § 81.001 et seq. governs protective orders and requires a finding of
family violence for such orders to be issued. False statements to the court
regarding the existence or basis of protective orders may constitute fraud
upon the court. Petitioner’s and her counsel’s continued reliance on false
representations about protective orders to obtain ex parte relief and to
justify extraordinary restrictions on Respondent’s access to the children
constitutes a serious abuse of legal process and a flagrant disregard for the
integrity of the court.
Answer (Texas)
Short response
Under Texas law, a protective order based on family violence cannot exist
without a judicial finding that family violence has occurred, and any contrary
representation—especially after a nonsuit—misstates the legal status and
may constitute sanctionable misconduct or abuse of process. Repeated false
assertions to the court about the existence or basis of such an order
undermine the integrity of judicial proceedings and may warrant sanctions
against the party and counsel.
Summary
Texas Family Code §§ 81.001 and 85.001 require a court to make explicit
findings of family violence before issuing a protective order; if the record
shows no such finding and the protective order proceeding was nonsuited,
there is no valid "active protective order" with a family-violence finding.
Persistently misrepresenting the existence or basis of such an order to the
court—particularly to obtain ex parte relief or restrict another party’s rights
—contravenes statutory requirements, may constitute fraud upon the court,
and exposes the offending party and counsel to sanctions under the Texas
Civil Practice and Remedies Code.
The statutory and case law authorities make clear that protective orders are
only valid if the court has made the required findings, and that attorneys
and parties have a duty to ensure their representations to the court are
factually and legally supported. False or misleading statements about
protective orders, especially when used to secure extraordinary relief, are
not only improper but may be sanctionable as an abuse of process and a
violation of the duty of candor to the tribunal.

Background and Relevant Law
Legislative Framework
The issuance of family-violence protective orders in Texas is governed by
Texas Family Code §§ 81.001 et seq. Section 81.001 provides that a court
must render a protective order only if it finds that family violence has
occurred, as further detailed in Section 85.001, which requires the court to
make findings at the close of a hearing on an application for a protective
order. If the court finds that family violence has occurred, it must render a
protective order as provided by Section 85.022, which sets out the specific
restrictions and requirements that may be imposed on the person found to
have committed family violence. Importantly, Section 85.001 makes clear
that these findings are a prerequisite to the issuance of any such order.
Section 85.005 allows for agreed protective orders, which may be
enforceable even if the court does not make the findings required by Section
85.001. However, the existence of an agreed order is distinct from a judicial
finding of family violence; mischaracterizing an agreed order or a nonsuited
proceeding as one involving a judicial finding of family violence is
misleading.
The Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code further regulates the conduct of
parties and attorneys in civil proceedings. Section 10.001 requires that
every signed pleading or motion is certified as being factually supported and
not presented for improper purposes. Section 10.004 authorizes courts to
impose sanctions for violations of this duty, including for filings that are
groundless, made in bad faith, or for improper purposes. Section 10.002
provides the procedural mechanism for seeking such sanctions.
Case Law
Texas appellate courts have consistently held that a protective order under
the Family Code requires explicit findings that family violence has occurred
(and, under prior law, that it is likely to occur in the future). In Hagner v.
Valdez, 04-23-00379-CV (Tex. App. Mar 26, 2025), the court reiterated that a
protective order issues only upon a judicial finding of family violence.
Similarly, Velasquez v. Rayon (Tex. App. June 21, 2023) vacated a protective
order where the required findings were absent, emphasizing that courts
cannot presume such findings or independently review the record to supply
them.
Other cases, such as J.A.T. v. C.S.T., 641 S.W.3d 596 (Tex. App. 2022), Sharp
v. Jimmerson, 01-20-00360-CV (Tex. App. Aug 17, 2021), Onkst v. Morgan,
NO. 03-18-00367-CV (Tex. App. Sep 11, 2019), and Roper v. Jolliffe, 493 S.W.
3d 624 (Tex. App. 2015), all confirm that the statutory prerequisites for a
protective order are mandatory and that the absence of such findings
precludes the existence of a valid order. The Texas Supreme Court in Stary v.
Ethridge, 23-0067 (Tex. May 02, 2025) and Nath v. Tex. Children's Hosp.,
446 S.W.3d 355 (Tex. 2014) further affirms the importance of factual and

legal support for pleadings and the availability of sanctions for abuses of
process.
Analysis
Statutory Prerequisites for Protective Orders
The Texas Family Code establishes a clear and mandatory framework for the
issuance of family-violence protective orders. Section 81.001 provides that a
court may only render a protective order if it finds that family violence has
occurred. Section 85.001 requires the court to make this finding at the close
of a hearing on the application for a protective order. If the court does not
make the required finding, it cannot issue a protective order under Section
85.022, which sets out the specific restrictions that may be imposed on the
person found to have committed family violence (Tex. Fam. Code § 81.001; 
Tex. Fam. Code § 85.001; Tex. Fam. Code § 85.022).
The statutory scheme is reinforced by case law. In Hagner v. Valdez (Tex.
App. Mar 26, 2025), the court held that a protective order may only issue
upon a judicial finding of family violence. Velasquez v. Rayon (Tex. App. June
21, 2023) vacated a protective order where the trial court failed to make the
required findings, holding that such findings cannot be presumed or
supplied by appellate review. J.A.T. v. C.S.T., 641 S.W.3d 596 (Tex. App. 2022)
and Sharp v. Jimmerson, 01-20-00360-CV (Tex. App. Aug 17, 2021) similarly
confirm that the absence of the required findings precludes the issuance of a
valid protective order.
If a protective order proceeding is nonsuited, there is no judicial finding of
family violence, and thus no valid "active protective order" under the Family
Code. The existence of an agreed protective order under Section 85.005
does not equate to a judicial finding of family violence; such orders are
enforceable but do not carry the same legal implications as an order issued
after a contested hearing and explicit findings (Tex. Fam. Code § 85.005).
Duty of Candor and Sanctions for False Representations
Attorneys and parties have a duty to ensure that their representations to the
court are factually and legally supported. Section 10.001 of the Texas Civil
Practice and Remedies Code requires that every signed pleading or motion
is certified as being factually supported and not presented for improper
purposes. Section 10.004 authorizes courts to impose sanctions for
violations of this duty, including for filings that are groundless, made in bad
faith, or for improper purposes. Section 10.002 provides the procedural
mechanism for seeking such sanctions (Tex. Civ. Prac. and Rem. Code §
10.001; Tex. Civ. Prac. and Rem. Code § 10.004; Tex. Civ. Prac. and Rem.
Code § 10.002).
The Texas Supreme Court in Nath v. Tex. Children's Hosp., 446 S.W.3d 355
(Tex. 2014) and Low v. Henry, 221 S.W.3d 609 (Tex. 2007) has affirmed that
courts may sanction parties and attorneys for pleadings or representations
made with an improper purpose or without evidentiary support, and for false

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
or bad-faith filings. The amount and nature of sanctions are within the trial
court’s discretion but must be tailored to the abuse found.
Application to the Scenario
Where, as here, the record shows no judicial finding of family violence and
the protective order proceeding was nonsuited, there is no valid "active
protective order" with a family-violence finding. Repeatedly asserting
otherwise in pleadings, motions, or oral representations to the court is
factually unsupported and misstates the legal status of the case. If such
representations are made to obtain ex parte relief or to justify extraordinary
restrictions on another party’s rights (such as access to children), they are
not only improper but may constitute an abuse of process and a violation of
the duty of candor to the tribunal.
The authorities make clear that such conduct is sanctionable. Under Section
10.001, the signing of a pleading or motion certifies that the factual
contentions have evidentiary support. If a party or counsel asserts the
existence of an "active protective order" with a family-violence finding when
the record shows otherwise, that certification is false. Section 10.004
authorizes the court to impose sanctions to deter repetition of such conduct,
including directives to cease the conduct, monetary penalties, and fee-
shifting. Section 10.002 provides the mechanism for seeking such sanctions.
The Texas Supreme Court in Nath v. Tex. Children's Hosp., 446 S.W.3d 355
(Tex. 2014) and Low v. Henry, 221 S.W.3d 609 (Tex. 2007) confirms that
sanctions are appropriate for pleadings or representations made without
factual support or for improper purposes. The courts have emphasized that
the duty of candor to the tribunal is fundamental to the integrity of the
judicial process, and that abuses of process—such as knowingly false
representations about the existence or basis of a protective order—are
serious violations warranting judicial intervention.
Abuse of Process and Fraud Upon the Court
The repeated reliance on false representations about protective orders to
obtain ex parte relief or to justify extraordinary restrictions on another
party’s rights constitutes a serious abuse of legal process. The Texas
Supreme Court and courts of appeals have recognized that such conduct
undermines the integrity of judicial proceedings and may constitute fraud
upon the court. While the authorities provided do not use the precise term
"fraud upon the court," the principles articulated in Nath v. Tex. Children's
Hosp., 446 S.W.3d 355 (Tex. 2014) and Low v. Henry, 221 S.W.3d 609 (Tex.
2007) make clear that knowingly false representations to the court are
sanctionable and may be remedied by the court to protect the integrity of its
proceedings.
The gravity of such misconduct is heightened in the context of protective
orders, which carry significant collateral consequences and social stigma, as
noted in secondary materials (Hit Me Baby Just One Time – But Not in
Texas: How the 2023 Texas Legislative Update to Family Violence Protective
Orders Will Affect Divorce and Custody Litigation (2023)). The misuse of

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
protective order proceedings to gain tactical advantage in custody or other
family law disputes, through false or misleading representations, is
particularly egregious.
Exceptions and Caveats
There are limited circumstances in which a protective order may exist
without explicit findings of family violence, such as agreed protective orders
under Section 85.005. However, these orders are enforceable only as agreed
and do not carry the same legal implications as orders issued after a
contested hearing and explicit findings. Mischaracterizing an agreed order
or a nonsuited proceeding as one involving a judicial finding of family
violence is misleading and improper.
It is also important to note that the statutory requirements for protective
orders have evolved. As of September 1, 2023, a single act of family violence
may suffice for issuance of a protective order, but the requirement of a
judicial finding remains unchanged (Hit Me Baby Just One Time – But Not in
Texas: How the 2023 Texas Legislative Update to Family Violence Protective
Orders Will Affect Divorce and Custody Litigation (2023)). The authorities
provided do not indicate any subsequent negative treatment of the key
statutory or case law principles discussed.
Conclusion
Texas law is unequivocal: a protective order based on family violence cannot
exist without a judicial finding that family violence has occurred, and any
contrary representation—especially after a nonsuit—misstates the legal
status and may constitute sanctionable misconduct or abuse of process.
Attorneys and parties have a duty to ensure that their representations to the
court are factually and legally supported; repeated false assertions about
the existence or basis of a protective order, particularly when used to obtain
ex parte relief or restrict another party’s rights, undermine the integrity of
judicial proceedings and may warrant sanctions. The statutory and case law
authorities make clear that such conduct is not only improper but may be
remedied by the court to protect the integrity of its proceedings and to deter
future abuses.

Protective Order is, therefore, not supported by legally sufficient evidence.
Accordingly, we vacate the trial court's Final Protective Order and dismiss
the case.
Summary
Texas Family Code § 81.001 requires two findings—past family violence and
likelihood of future family violence—for a protective order to be rendered.
The court of appeals vacated and dismissed a protective order where the
record lacked the required future-likelihood finding. Thus, assertions that
there exists an “active protective order” with the necessary family-violence
findings are untenable when those statutory findings were not made or the
order was vacated/dismissed. This supports argument that representing the
existence or basis of such an order, despite the absence of required findings
or the case’s dismissal, misleads the court and undermines the integrity of
proceedings.

Fam.Code Ann. § 81.001 (Vernon 2002); see also id. § 85.001(b) (Vernon

Summary
The court reiterates the statutory requirement that a protective order may
issue only upon a judicial finding that family violence has occurred and is
likely to occur in the future under Tex. Fam. Code § 81.001 and § 85.001(b).
This supports the proposition’s premise that Texas Family Code § 81.001 et
seq. governs protective orders and requires such findings. If the record
reflects no such finding (e.g., proceeding nonsuited), representations that an
“active protective order” with a family-violence finding exists are
inconsistent with these statutory prerequisites and can be argued as false
statements to the court used to obtain ex parte relief or restrictions.

If the trial court finds that family violence has occurred and that family
violence is likely to occur in the future, the trial court: (1) shall render a
protective order as provided by Family Code section 85.022... See Tex. Fam.
Code Ann. § 85.001(b)." ... "Though the trial court had the power to issue a
protective order allowing Father to have only supervised access to Daughter,
the trial court was only authorized to do so after finding that family violence

order has since expired).
Summary
The passages confirm that a family-violence protective order requires
findings that family violence occurred and is likely to occur in the future,
citing §§ 81.001, 84.001, 85.001-.002 and Taylor. This directly undermines
any claim that an “active protective order” exists absent such findings or
where proceedings were nonsuited. It supports arguing that representations
of an active order with family-violence findings are false and an abuse of
process when the statutory predicates are unmet.
Roper v. Jolliffe, 493 S.W.3d 624 (Tex. App. 2015)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
At the close of the hearing on the application for a protective order, the trial
court must find whether family violence has occurred and is likely to occur
in the future. Id. § 85.001(a). If the court makes those findings, it must
render a protective order applying to the person found to have committed
family violence. Id. §§ 81.001, 85.022... “A court shall render a protective
order ... if the court finds that family violence has occurred and is likely to

85.001(a) requires “the court shall find whether: (1) family violence has
occurred; and (2) family violence is likely to occur in the future.”
Summary
The case reiterates that a protective order may be issued only if the court
makes specific findings that family violence has occurred and is likely to
occur. Thus, claiming an “active protective order” with a finding of family
violence when no such findings were made—and where the proceeding was
nonsuited—contradicts the statutory preconditions summarized by the court.

TEX. FAM.CODE ANN. § 85.001(a) (Vernon 2002).
Summary
Texas law requires a court finding that family violence has occurred and is
likely to occur in the future before a protective order may be rendered.
Thus, absent such findings (e.g., where the proceeding was nonsuited or no
findings were made), there can be no valid “active protective order” with a
family-violence finding. Misrepresenting that such an order exists
contradicts the statutory requirements.

Summary
The case establishes that attorneys certify factual contentions have
evidentiary support after reasonable inquiry and may be sanctioned under
Chapter 10/Rule 13 for filings lacking a factual basis or presented for
improper purposes. It further holds that proceeding despite information
negating allegations violates Chapter 10. These principles support sanctions
or other remedies when counsel falsely represents the existence/basis of a
protective order to secure ex parte relief and impose extraordinary
restrictions, particularly where the record shows no family-violence finding
and a nonsuit.
Nath v. Tex. Children's Hosp., 446 S.W.3d 355 (Tex. 2014)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
The Civil Practice and Remedies Code and our Rules of Civil Procedure
allow for pleadings sanctions against parties and attorneys when, among
other things, a pleading was filed with an improper purpose or was unlikely
to receive evidentiary support. ... Chapter 10 allows sanctions for pleadings
filed with an improper purpose or that lack legal or factual support. ... Rule
13 provides that pleadings that are groundless and in bad faith, intended to
harass, or false when made are also sanctionable: ... The amount of a
sanction is limited only by the trial court's duty to act within its sound
discretion in accordance with the Due Process clause of the Texas
Constitution. ... [T]he trial court must ensure that the sanction: (1) relates
directly to the abuse found; and (2) is not excessive.
Summary
The Texas Supreme Court affirms that courts may sanction parties and
attorneys for pleadings or representations made with an improper purpose
or without evidentiary support, and for false or bad-faith filings under
Chapter 10 and Rule 13. This supports the proposition’s contention that
knowingly false assertions about a protective order (e.g., claiming an “active
protective order” with a family-violence finding when none exists) are
sanctionable abuses of process. The opinion underscores due-process
constraints but confirms trial courts’ authority to impose sanctions tailored
to the abuse, which aligns with seeking remedies against parties/counsel
who rely on false protective-order claims to obtain ex parte relief or
extraordinary restrictions.

Summary
The case confirms that a valid protective order under Chapter 85 requires
an explicit finding that family violence occurred and is likely to occur again.
Thus, where no such finding exists—especially if a protective order
application was nonsuited—representations that there is an “active
protective order” with a family-violence finding are inconsistent with the

Vest v. Vest
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Under the Texas Family Code, a court shall render a protective order if the
court finds that family violence has occurred and is likely to occur in the
future. Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 81.001. ... A protective order is a statutory
remedy that is distinct from a permanent injunction. ... A protective order
does not require a party to establish liability on an underlying cause of
action. ... The purpose of the statute is to provide an expedited procedure
for victims of domestic violence and give immediate protection to the
applicant.
Summary
Texas Family Code § 81.001 requires an actual judicial finding that family
violence has occurred and is likely to occur before a court may render a
protective order. Thus, if no such finding exists—e.g., because the
proceeding was nonsuited—there is no valid “protective order” under the
statute. The case also clarifies that protective orders are statutory remedies,
distinct from other injunctive relief, reinforcing that their existence depends
on compliance with the statute’s prerequisites, including the family-violence
finding.
Diaz v. Alston

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
In the final protective order rendered by the trial court the court found and
concluded that Sierra 'is a victim of stalking and harassment pursuant to the
Texas Penal Code and Chapter 7b of the Code of Criminal Procedure.' The
trial court further found and concluded that 'this protective order can be
granted for longer than 2 years based on chapter 7b of the Code of Criminal
Procedure.' ... 'Although Tinch applied for a protective order pursuant to
Family Code provisions relating to cases involving family violence, the trial
court found at the hearing on the application that there were no allegations
of family violence and instead issued a protective order based on a finding of
harassment. ... Morott did not object in the trial court and does not complain
on appeal that the trial court's judgment does not comport with Tinch's
pleadings.' ... Ana raises this issue in relation to the findings necessary to
obtain a protective order under the Family Code, as opposed to those
required under the Code of Criminal Procedure.
Summary
The passages show that not all protective orders are based on Family Code
family-violence findings; some are issued under Chapter 7B of the Code of
Criminal Procedure for stalking/harassment with no family-violence
allegations. This undermines any assertion that an “active protective order”
necessarily entails a Family Code finding of family violence. It supports
arguing that claiming a Family Code family-violence finding when the order
rests on a different statutory basis misrepresents the record and the legal
basis for the order.

Summary
The case confirms that under Tex. Fam. Code § 81.001 and § 85.001, a valid
protective order requires explicit findings that family violence occurred and
is likely to occur. Without those findings, an order cannot be sustained;
courts cannot presume missing findings. Thus, claims of an “active
protective order” with a finding of family violence are untenable when the
record lacks the mandatory findings or the proceeding was dismissed. This
supports arguing that representing otherwise misstates the legal status and
undermines court integrity.

Summary
The opinion confirms that a valid family-violence protective order requires
explicit findings under Family Code § 85.001 that family violence occurred
and is likely to occur. Where such required findings are absent, a protective
order cannot stand, and courts cannot presume them. This undermines any
claim that there is an “active protective order” with a family-violence finding
when the record contains no such findings or the proceeding did not result
in a valid order.

Summary
The case reiterates that to rely on a protective order, there must actually be
an order issued under Chapter 85 (or Article 17.292, etc.), with proper
notice/hearing. It references Harvey’s construction that the order must be
issued under the specified statutes and at a proceeding the respondent
attended or after service and notice. It also quotes the definition of family
violence under the Family Code and notes that violation requires proof of a
valid protective order issued under Chapter 85. These points support the
proposition that invoking an “active protective order” with a finding of
family violence requires that such an order actually exist and be properly
issued; absent such an order (e.g., if nonsuited or without a finding), claims
to the contrary are false and an abuse of process.

Summary
Texas appellate authority confirms that issuance of a protective order
requires an express finding that family violence has occurred and is likely to
occur again. It also confirms that extended-duration orders require findings
including prior protective orders and future likelihood, reinforcing that
findings of family violence are a statutory prerequisite. Thus, if no finding
exists (e.g., proceeding nonsuited), claiming an “active protective order”
with a family-violence finding contradicts the statutory framework. This
supports the proposition that misrepresenting the existence or basis of such
orders is improper and can be argued as abuse of process/fraud on the
court.
Stary v. Ethridge, 23-0067 (Tex. May 02, 2025)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
Domestic violence protective orders protect family members from one of
their own who turns abusive toward them... Recognizing as much, the law
requires a court that issues a protective order lasting longer than two years
to find felony-level violence, serious bodily injury, or repeated violations of
prior protective orders... The statutory regime governing protective order
proceedings leaves trial courts with much discretion as to the duration of
the order and its intrusion into the parent-child relationship... E.g., Tex.
Fam. Code § 85.025(a-1) (permitting trial courts to extend an order for any
period exceeding two years upon making a requisite finding); id. § 85.022
(setting out actions that a trial court may prohibit a person found to have
committed family violence from committing, including communication and
contact with specific persons).
Summary
The Court confirms that protective orders are governed by the Family Code
and tethered to required findings of family violence; orders—especially
those exceeding two years—require specific statutory findings. This
undermines any assertion of an “active protective order” absent such
findings or where the proceeding has been nonsuited. While the opinion
does not address fraud-on-the-court directly, it reinforces that
representations about protective orders must rest on valid statutory
findings, supporting arguments that false claims about such orders are
improper and abusive.

See TEX. FAM. CODE ANN. § 81.001 ('A court shall render a protective
order as provided by Section 85.001(b) if the court finds that family violence
has occurred.'). … Under the Texas Family Code, a trial court shall render a
protective order if, at the close of a hearing on the application, the court
finds family violence has occurred and is likely to occur in the future. TEX.
FAM. CODE ANN. §§ 81.001, 85.001. … Evidence of a single act of family
violence can support a finding of future family violence.
Summary
The passages establish that, under Texas Family Code §§ 81.001 and 85.001,
a protective order issues only upon a judicial finding that family violence has
occurred (and is likely to occur). This supports arguing that if the record
shows no such finding and the proceeding was nonsuited, there can be no
“active protective order” with a family-violence finding. Thus,
representations to the contrary misstate the legal preconditions for a
protective order and bolster the contention that repeated false assertions
about an existing protective order and its basis are improper.

Extract
Under section 85.001 of the Texas Family Code, the trial court may grant a
protective order upon finding that family violence has occurred and is likely
to occur again. TEX. FAM.CODE ANN. § 85.001(a) (Vernon 2008). ... Section

Section 85.001 lists the required findings and orders to be issued by the
court if it finds that family violence has occurred and is likely to occur in the
future.
Summary
The passages confirm that a Texas protective order requires a judicial
finding that family violence has occurred and is likely to occur again. Thus,
absent such a finding or where the proceeding is nonsuited, there is no
lawful basis to assert an “active protective order” with a family-violence
finding. This supports challenging false representations about the existence
or basis of a protective order.

Texas Court of Criminal Appeals
Extract
A person commits the offense of violation of protective order if, 'in violation
of an order issued under [one of certain provisions of the Family Code or
Code of Criminal Procedure], the person knowingly or intentionally commits
family violence' ... Section 25.07(a) makes it an element of the offense that
the culpable act be performed 'in violation of an order issued under Section
6.504 or Chapter 85, Family Code...' Those codes, in turn, require certain
procedures for the order to be binding... The Family Code procedures for a
Texas court to render a protective order require service of notice and a copy
of the application as a prerequisite for a protective order to be binding. 'A
court may render a protective order that is binding on a respondent who
does not attend a hearing if the respondent received service of the
application and notice of the hearing.' ... When issuance of a protective
order is sought under Chapter 85 of the Family Code, the notice
requirements of Chapter 82 apply. The clerk of the court must issue a notice
that application for a protective order has been filed. 'Each respondent to an
application for protective order is entitled to service of notice of an
application for protective order.' ... 'The notice "must be served in the same
manner as citation under the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, except that
service by publication is not authorized."' ... 'The charge in this case
correctly told the jury, "A person commits the offense of violation of a
protective order if, in violation of a protective order issued after notice and
hearing, the person knowingly or intentionally commits family violence."'
Summary
Harvey confirms that a “protective order” contemplated under Chapter 85/§
6.504 is only binding if statutory prerequisites—service of the application
and notice of hearing, and issuance after notice and hearing—are met. The
court’s articulation that a valid protective order is “issued after notice and
hearing” and that service/notice are prerequisites helps rebut claims that an
“active protective order” exists where the protective order proceeding was
nonsuited or no finding/hearing occurred. By tying enforceability and
criminal consequences to proper issuance under the Family Code, Harvey
underscores that misrepresenting the existence of such an order (or a
family-violence finding supporting it) is contrary to the statutory framework
and prejudices court processes—supporting arguments that such
misstatements are an abuse of process and undermine court integrity.

Applying to Person Who Committed Family Violence

In a protective order, the court may order the person found to have

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
protective order, the court may prohibit the person found to have committed
family violence from: committing family violence; communicating... going to
or near the residence... [and other prohibitions].
Summary
Section 85.022 presupposes that a protective order’s restrictions and
mandates may be imposed only on a “person found to have committed family
violence.” This reinforces that operative protective orders under Chapter 85
are contingent on a judicial finding of family violence. If the proceeding was
nonsuited and no finding was made, there is no basis for asserting the
existence of an “active” protective order with the attendant restrictions
described in §85.022. Thus, misrepresenting that such an order exists or
that a family-violence finding was made contradicts the statutory framework
and supports the argument that the Petitioner’s representations are false
and abusive of process.
Tex. Fam. Code § 81.001 Tex. Fam. Code § 81.001 Entitlement to Protective
Order
Extract
A court shall render a protective order as provided by Section FAMILY
CODE 85.001(b) if the court finds that family violence has occurred.
Summary
Texas Family Code § 81.001 establishes a prerequisite for issuance of a
protective order: a court must find that family violence has occurred.
Therefore, if the record reflects no such finding (and especially if the
protective-order proceeding was nonsuited), there can be no valid “active
protective order” premised on a family-violence finding. Any contrary
representations to the court about the existence of an active protective
order with a family-violence finding are inconsistent with § 81.001’s
requirement and support the argument that such statements are false and
used improperly to obtain relief.
Tex. Fam. Code § 85.001 Tex. Fam. Code § 85.001 Required Findings and
Orders
Extract
At the close of a hearing on an application for a protective order, the court
shall find whether family violence has occurred. If the court finds that family
violence has occurred, the court: shall render a protective order as provided
by Section FAMILY CODE 85.022 applying only to a person found to have
committed family violence; ... A protective order that requires the first
applicant to do or refrain from doing an act under Section FAMILY CODE

=== PAGE 18 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
85.022 shall include a finding that the first applicant has committed family
violence.
Summary
Protective orders under Chapter 85 require the court to make a finding on
whether family violence occurred. If family violence is found, a protective
order issues and must reflect that finding; without such a finding, an order
under § 85.022 cannot issue, and the order would not exist as claimed. Thus,
if the protective-order proceeding was nonsuited or resulted in no family-
violence finding, there is no valid “active protective order” with such a
finding. Repeated claims to the contrary misstate the legal predicate
required by § 85.001.
Tex. Fam. Code § 85.025 Tex. Fam. Code § 85.025 Duration of Protective
Order
Extract
Except as otherwise provided by this section, an order under this subtitle is
effective: for the period stated in the order, not to exceed two years; or if a
period is not stated in the order, until the second anniversary of the date the
order was issued. ... The court may render a protective order ... that is
effective for a period that exceeds two years if the court finds that the
person who is the subject of the protective order: committed an act
constituting a felony offense involving family violence ... [or] caused serious
bodily injury ... [or] was the subject of two or more previous protective
orders rendered ... after a finding by the court that the subject of the
protective order has committed family violence.
Summary
The statute establishes that a protective order is only “effective” if one was
issued and remains within its statutory duration. It also ties extended
duration to explicit court findings (including findings of family violence).
Thus, if the protective order proceeding was nonsuited and no order with
the requisite findings was issued, there can be no “active” order. Claims of
an active order or findings of family violence are contradicted by §85.025’s
requirement that effectiveness depends on an issued order and, in some
cases, explicit findings for extended duration.

violation of Section CIVIL PRACTICE AND REMEDIES CODE 10.001 may

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
impose a sanction on the person, a party represented by the person, or
both. ... The sanction must be limited to what is sufficient to deter repetition
of the conduct or comparable conduct by others similarly situated. ... A
sanction may include any of the following: a directive to the violator to
perform, or refrain from performing, an act; an order to pay a penalty into
court; and an order to pay to the other party the amount of the reasonable
expenses incurred by the other party because of the filing of the pleading or
motion, including reasonable attorney's fees. ... The court may not award
monetary sanctions against a represented party for a violation of Section
CIVIL PRACTICE AND REMEDIES CODE 10.001. ... The court may not
award monetary sanctions on its own initiative unless the court issues its
order to show cause before a voluntary dismissal or settlement of the claims
made by or against the party or the party's attorney who is to be sanctioned.
Summary
Section 10.004 authorizes sanctions when a person signs a pleading or
motion in violation of § 10.001 (which prohibits filings that are groundless,
brought in bad faith, or for improper purpose, including false factual
contentions). When a party or counsel repeatedly asserts false
representations in pleadings or motions—such as claiming an “active
protective order” with a finding of family violence when none exists—§
10.004 permits the court to deter that misconduct through sanctions,
directives to cease the conduct, and fee-shifting. This supports the
proposition that such false statements are an abuse of process and warrant
court intervention and sanctions.
Tex. Civ. Prac. and Rem. Code § 10.001 Tex. Civ. Prac. and Rem. Code §
10.001 Signing of Pleadings and Motions
Extract
The signing of a pleading or motion as required by the Texas Rules of Civil
Procedure constitutes a certificate by the signatory that to the signatory's
best knowledge, information, and belief, formed after reasonable inquiry:
the pleading or motion is not being presented for any improper purpose,
including to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in
the cost of litigation; each claim, defense, or other legal contention in the
pleading or motion is warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous
argument...; each allegation or other factual contention in the pleading or
motion has evidentiary support...; and each denial in the pleading or motion
of a factual contention is warranted on the evidence...
Summary
Section 10.001 imposes a certification on every signed pleading/motion that
factual contentions have evidentiary support and are not filed for improper
purposes. If Petitioner or counsel signed filings asserting an “active
protective order” with a family-violence finding when the record shows no

=== PAGE 20 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
such finding and the case was nonsuited, those filings lack evidentiary
support and may have been presented for improper purposes (e.g., to obtain
ex parte relief or restrict access). This supports sanctions and underscores
the seriousness of making false representations to the court.
Tex. Fam. Code § 261.504 Tex. Fam. Code § 261.504 Required Findings;
Issuance of Protective Order
Extract
At the close of a hearing on an application for a protective order under this
subchapter, the court shall find whether there are reasonable grounds to
believe that: the child: (A) is a victim of abuse or neglect; or (B) has a history
of being abused or neglected; and there is a threat of: (A) immediate or
continued abuse or neglect to the child; (B) someone illegally taking the
child from the home in which the child is placed; (C) behavior that poses a
threat to the caregiver with whom the child is placed; or (D) someone
committing an act of violence against the child or the child's caregiver. ... If
the court makes an affirmative finding under Subsection (a), the court shall
issue a protective order that includes a statement of that finding.
Summary
The statute mandates that, to issue a protective order under this subchapter,
the court must make specified abuse/neglect findings and the issued order
must include a statement of those findings. Thus, claims of an “active
protective order” necessarily imply the court made and memorialized
required findings. If there is no such order or findings in the record (e.g.,
the proceeding was nonsuited), assertions to the contrary are inconsistent
with the statutory requirement and support the argument that
representations of an active order with findings are false and abusive of
process.
Tex. Fam. Code § 85.005 Tex. Fam. Code § 85.005 Agreed Order
Extract
An agreed protective order is enforceable civilly or criminally, regardless of
whether the court makes the findings required by Section FAMILY CODE
85.001.
Summary
The passage confirms that an agreed protective order can be entered and
enforced without the court making the Section 85.001 findings of family
violence. This distinction supports the proposition that claiming an “active
protective order” implies, inaccurately, that there was a judicial finding of
family violence when the order may have been merely agreed, or the

=== PAGE 21 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
proceeding was nonsuited. Mischaracterizing an agreed order (or a
nonsuited action) as an adjudicated finding of family violence can mislead
the court and supports arguments about false representations and abuse of
process.
Tex. Civ. Prac. and Rem. Code § 10.002 Tex. Civ. Prac. and Rem. Code §
10.002 Motion For Sanctions
Extract
(a) A party may make a motion for sanctions, describing the specific conduct
violating Section CIVIL PRACTICE AND REMEDIES CODE 10.001. (b) The
court on its own initiative may enter an order describing the specific
conduct that appears to violate Section CIVIL PRACTICE AND REMEDIES
CODE 10.001 and direct the alleged violator to show cause why the conduct
has not violated that section. (c) The court may award to a party prevailing
on a motion under this section the reasonable expenses and attorney's fees
incurred in presenting or opposing the motion, and if no due diligence is
shown the court may award to the prevailing party all costs for
inconvenience, harassment, and out-of-pocket expenses incurred or caused
by the subject litigation.
Summary
Section 10.002 authorizes a motion for sanctions and permits the court, sua
sponte or on motion, to address conduct violating § 10.001, including false
or unsupported factual contentions. It allows fee-shifting and additional
costs where lack of due diligence is shown. In a case where a party and
counsel repeatedly misrepresent the existence or basis of a protective order
to secure ex parte relief, § 10.002 supplies a procedural vehicle for sanctions
and cost recovery tied to those misrepresentations, supporting the
proposition that such conduct is a serious abuse of process and warrants
court intervention.
Hit Me Baby Just One Time – But Not in Texas: How the 2023 Texas
Legislative Update to Family Violence Protective Orders Will Affect Divorce
and Custody Litigation
Extract
Title 4 of the Texas Family Code has provided victims of domestic violence
for decades the opportunity to apply for and secure family violence
protective orders... The same has been espoused by Texas courts for years,
finding that these necessary vehicles carry “significant collateral
repercussions and a social stigma” and special gravity not found in other
civil contexts. ... Up until this year, to be entitled to a family violence
protective order, the applicant had to prove not only that family violence had
occurred but that it was likely to occur in the future. ... As of September 1,

=== PAGE 22 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
2023... if a court finds that one, single act of family violence has occurred, it
will be required to issue a family violence protective order.
Summary
Title 4 (Texas Family Code § 81.001 et seq.) governs family-violence
protective orders and that issuance requires a judicial finding that family
violence occurred (previously plus likelihood of future violence; after
9/1/2023, a single act suffices). It also emphasizes the severe, far-reaching
consequences of such orders. This supports the proposition’s premise that
an “active protective order” necessarily rests on a judicial finding and that
misrepresenting the existence/basis of such an order is serious given the
orders’ gravity. While the article does not address fraud-upon-the-court
directly, it bolsters the argument that false representations about protective
orders are material and abusive because these orders carry significant
collateral repercussions.
The Unconstitutionality of Protective Orders Under the Texas Family Code –
Part II
Extract
Tex. Fam. Code § 85.001(a) requires: (a) At the close of a hearing on an
application for a protective order, the court shall find whether: family
violence has occurred; and family violence is likely to occur in the future. ...
To enter a final civil protective order, the Court is required to find that the
defendant’s actions intended to result in physical harm, bodily injury,
assault, or sexual assault or were a threat that reasonably placed the family
member in fear of imminent physical harm, bodily injury, assault, or sexual
assault. ... in a civil protective order trial, the Court must only find that the
defendant has committed family violence and is likely to commit family
violence in the future by a preponderance of the evidence. Roper v. Jollife,
493 S.W.3d 624, 638 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2015, pet. denied).
Summary
The passages confirm that a protective order requires specific findings that
“family violence has occurred” and is likely to occur again. If the protective-
order case was nonsuited and no such findings were made, then claims of an
“active protective order” with a family-violence finding are contrary to the
statutory requirement. This supports the argument that misrepresentations
about the existence or basis of a protective order are false and abused for ex
parte relief and restrictions.
