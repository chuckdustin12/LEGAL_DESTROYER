Question
What are the key provisions and regulations in the Florida Administrative Code that govern Homeowners Associations (HOAs)?
Answer (Florida)
Short response
The Florida Administrative Code establishes detailed procedural and reporting requirements for Homeowners Associations (HOAs), particularly in the areas of
dispute resolution, board recalls, election procedures, and statutory reporting. These regulations work in tandem with the Florida Statutes to ensure transparency,
due process, and compliance in the governance of HOAs.
Summary
Florida’s regulatory framework for HOAs is anchored in Chapter 720 of the Florida Statutes, but the Florida Administrative Code (FAC) provides essential
procedural rules and administrative requirements that directly affect how HOAs operate. The FAC addresses the processes for arbitration of election and recall
disputes, the mechanics of recalling board members, and the mandatory reporting obligations for associations, ensuring that HOAs function with transparency
and accountability.
The FAC rules, particularly those promulgated by the Department of Business and Professional Regulation (DBPR), set forth the steps HOAs must follow in
handling internal disputes, conducting board recalls, and submitting required information to the state. These administrative regulations are designed to
supplement statutory provisions, providing clarity and enforceable procedures that protect the rights of association members and promote good governance within
Florida’s residential communities.
Background and Relevant Law
Legislative and Regulatory Framework
While the primary statutory authority for HOAs in Florida is found in Chapter 720 of the Florida Statutes, the Florida Administrative Code (FAC) contains several
chapters and rules that implement, interpret, and enforce these statutory provisions. The FAC rules are promulgated by the Division of Florida Condominiums,
Timeshares, and Mobile Homes within the Department of Business and Professional Regulation (DBPR), which is charged with certain oversight and dispute
resolution functions for HOAs.
The most significant FAC provisions governing HOAs include:
Arbitration of Election and Recall Disputes (Ch. 61B-80, FAC):
•
Scope and Applicability: Rule 61B-80.101 establishes that this chapter governs the arbitration of election and recall disputes in HOAs subject to Chapter
720, Florida Statutes. It applies to all such disputes arising on or after October 1, 2004, and incorporates by reference certain procedures from other FAC
chapters to the extent they are consistent with these rules. The rules define "homeowners" as members or parcel owners with voting rights, as set out in
the statutory definitions (Fla. Admin. Code Ann. R. 61B-80.101).
•
Filing for Recall Dispute Arbitration: Rule 61B-80.102 details the process for initiating arbitration when there is a dispute over the recall of one or more
directors. If homeowners attempt a recall and the board does not certify it, the board must file a petition for arbitration within five business days. If the board
fails to do so, the homeowners may file the petition themselves. This ensures a prompt and structured process for resolving recall disputes (Fla. Admin.
Code Ann. R. 61B-80.102).
Recall of Board Directors (Ch. 61B-33, FAC):
•
Recall at Member Meetings: Rule 61B-33.002 provides the procedures for recalling one or more directors at a member meeting. It specifies how a recall
meeting is called (by at least 10% of voting interests), the process for electing replacements if a majority of the board is recalled, and the steps to be taken
if the board does not certify the recall. The rule also addresses the consequences if the board fails to hold a required meeting to consider the recall within
the specified timeframe (Fla. Admin. Code Ann. R. 61B-33.002).
•
Recall by Written Agreement: Rule 61B-33.003 (supplementary) outlines the requirements for written agreements used to recall directors, including the
necessary content, signature requirements, and procedures for tallying votes and serving notice on the board. This rule is particularly relevant for HOAs
created under Section 723.075, Florida Statutes, which pertains to mobile home parks (Fla. Admin. Code Ann. R. 61B-33.003).
Statutory Reporting Requirements (Ch. 61B-85, FAC):
•
Annual Reporting: Rule 61B-85.001 mandates that HOAs, through their community association manager, management firm, or directly if no manager is
retained, must complete and submit the DBPR Form HOA 6000-1 (Homeowner Association Reporting) to comply with the reporting requirements of
Section 720.303, Florida Statutes. The form must be submitted online via the DBPR’s designated portal. This reporting obligation is designed to ensure
that the state maintains up-to-date records on the existence and basic information of all HOAs in Florida (Fla. Admin. Code Ann. R. 61B-85.001).
Transition from Developer Control (Ch. 61B-23, FAC):
•
Transition Procedures: Rule 61B-23.003 addresses the process for transitioning control of the association from the developer to the unit owners in
associations operating more than one condominium. It specifies the thresholds for when non-developer owners are entitled to elect board members and
the circumstances under which the developer retains certain rights. While this rule is more directly applicable to condominium associations, it is relevant to
HOAs that operate multiple communities or have similar governance structures (Fla. Admin. Code Ann. R. 61B-23.003).

Case Law
The case law provided does not directly interpret the Florida Administrative Code provisions but does confirm the importance of the statutory and regulatory
framework in ensuring fair governance and protecting the rights of association members. For example, in Avatar Props. v. Gundel (Fla. App. 2023), the court
recognized the statutory purpose of Chapter 720 to provide procedures for operating HOAs and to protect members’ rights, with the FAC rules serving as the
procedural backbone for implementing these statutory mandates.
Analysis
Arbitration and Dispute Resolution
The FAC rules on arbitration (Ch. 61B-80) are critical for ensuring that disputes over board elections and recalls are resolved efficiently and fairly. These rules
provide a clear, step-by-step process for initiating arbitration, set strict timelines for board action, and allow homeowners to seek redress if the board fails to act.
This procedural clarity is essential for maintaining trust in the governance of HOAs and for preventing protracted or unfair disputes.
The rules also incorporate by reference other procedural chapters (61B-45 and 61B-50) to the extent they are consistent, ensuring that the arbitration process is
comprehensive and harmonized with broader administrative procedures. The focus on election and recall disputes reflects the legislature’s intent, as seen in the
statutes, to provide expedited and alternative dispute resolution mechanisms for HOAs (Fla. Stat. § 720.311).
Board Recalls
The FAC provides detailed guidance on both recall by member meeting and recall by written agreement. The rules ensure that a minority of members cannot
unilaterally remove directors without due process, while also preventing boards from stonewalling legitimate recall efforts. The requirement for prompt board
action (five business days) and the ability of homeowners to initiate arbitration if the board fails to act are key safeguards. These rules are particularly important in
the context of mobile home park HOAs, but the principles are broadly applicable to all HOAs governed by Chapter 720.
Reporting Requirements
The annual reporting requirement in Rule 61B-85.001 is a cornerstone of administrative oversight. By mandating that HOAs submit up-to-date information to the
DBPR, the rule ensures that the state can monitor the existence and status of associations, which is vital for policy planning, enforcement, and public
transparency. The use of a standardized online form (DBPR Form HOA 6000-1) streamlines compliance and facilitates data collection.
Transition from Developer Control
While the primary statutory provisions for transition of control are found in Chapter 720, the FAC rule (61B-23.003) provides additional detail for associations
operating multiple condominiums. It sets out the thresholds for owner control and the rights retained by developers, ensuring a fair and orderly transition. This is
particularly relevant for large or phased developments where the timing and process of transition can be complex.
Exceptions and Caveats
•
Applicability to Mobile Home Parks: Some FAC rules, particularly those in Chapter 61B-33, are specifically tailored to HOAs created under Section
723.075, Florida Statutes, which governs mobile home parks. While the recall procedures and principles are similar, practitioners should verify the applicability
of each rule to the specific type of HOA involved.
•
Overlap with Statutory Provisions: The FAC rules are designed to supplement, not supplant, the statutory requirements of Chapter 720. In the event of a
conflict, the statutory provisions will control. The FAC rules often incorporate or reference statutory definitions and procedures to ensure consistency.
•
Condominium vs. HOA Distinctions: Some rules, such as those in Chapter 61B-23, are more directly applicable to condominium associations but may be
relevant to HOAs with similar governance structures. Practitioners should carefully distinguish between rules that apply to condominiums and those that apply
to HOAs under Chapter 720.
Conclusion
The Florida Administrative Code plays a vital role in the governance of Homeowners Associations by establishing clear, enforceable procedures for dispute
resolution, board recalls, and statutory reporting. These administrative regulations, developed by the DBPR, ensure that HOAs operate transparently, resolve
internal disputes efficiently, and comply with state oversight requirements. While the FAC rules are closely tied to the statutory framework of Chapter 720, they
provide the procedural detail necessary for effective and fair association governance, protecting the rights of both boards and members in Florida’s residential
communities.

Romero v. Shadywood Villas Homeowners Ass'n, Inc., 657 So.2d 1193 (Fla. App. 1995)
Florida District Court of Appeals
Extract
The present appeal centers around the interpretation of two statutory provisions contained within the Florida Not For Profit Corporation Act; Florida Statutes,
Section 617.1605 and Section 617.303(4). The issue is whether one or both of these sections control the reporting obligations of homeowners' associations
organized to do business under Chapter 617. Romero contends that the trial court erred in dismissing the Amended Complaint because Shadywood, as a
non-profit corporation organized to do business under Chapter 617, is subject to the reporting and delivery requirements of both Section 617.1605 and Section
617.303(4). Shadywood, on the other hand, maintains that since it is a homeowners' association, it is only required to comport with the reporting requirements set
out in Section 617.303(4)(i). For the reasons which follow, we hold that homeowners' associations must comply with the reporting requirements set out in both
Section 617.1605 and Section 617.303(4). Within the confines of Chapter 617, are Sections 617.301 through 617.306, which specifically and exclusively regulate
homeowner associations organized as non-profit corporations under Chapter 617. Within these specific sections is Florida Statute, Section 617.303(4) which
delineates the record maintenance and inspection obligations for homeowners' associations. Section 617.303(4), which was enacted in 1992, provides, in
pertinent part, as follows: (4) The association shall maintain each of the following items, when applicable, which shall constitute the official records of the
association: .... (i) Accounting records for the homeowners' association and separate accounting records for each parcel, ... The accounting records shall be open
to inspection by parcel owners or their authorized representatives at reasonable times. The accounting records shall include, but are not limited to: .... 1.
Accurate, itemized and detailed records of all receipts and expenditures ... 3. All audits, reviews, accounting statements, and financial reports of the homeowners'
association. Sec. 617.303(4), (4)(i), Fla.Stat. (1993) (emphasis added). One year after the Legislature enacted Section 617.303(4), it enacted Section 617.1605,
which specifies that non-profit corporations organized under Chapter 617 must deliver to each of its members a complete financial report within a certain time
frame. See Ch. 92-49, Sec. 617.303(4), Laws of Fla.; Ch. 93-281, Sec. 617.1605, Laws of Fla.
Summary
The passage provides insight into the reporting obligations of homeowners' associations under Florida law, specifically under the Florida Not For Profit
Corporation Act. It clarifies that such associations must comply with both Section 617.1605 and Section 617.303(4), which outline the requirements for
maintaining and inspecting records and delivering financial reports to members.
Avatar Props. v. Gundel
Florida District Court of Appeals
Extract
Before any parcels were sold, Avatar recorded the documents necessary to create a homeowner's association under the Florida Homeowners' Association Act,
chapter 720, Florida Statutes. The purpose of that Act is to 'to provide procedures for operating homeowners' associations, and to protect the rights of association
members without unduly impairing the ability of such associations to perform their functions.' § 720.302(1), Fla. Stat. (2017). The Act provides benefits and
imposes responsibilities on the developer, residents, and homeowner's association. One of the statutory powers granted to an association is the power to make
financial assessments, requiring the residents to share in expenses incurred by the association for maintaining common areas and otherwise maintaining the
community as the association sees fit. § 720.308, Fla. Stat. (2017). When the statutory requirements are met, section 720.3085, Florida Statutes (2017),
establishes a lien on the property for the failure to pay an assessment, which permits the association to foreclose on the property for payment of unpaid dues or
other assessments.
Summary
The passage provides specific references to the Florida Homeowners' Association Act, chapter 720, Florida Statutes, which outlines the procedures for operating
homeowners' associations, the rights of association members, and the responsibilities of developers, residents, and the association itself. It highlights the
statutory powers of associations, such as making financial assessments and establishing liens for unpaid dues, which are key provisions governing HOAs.

Lennar Homes, LLC v. Mart. At the Oasis Neighborhood Ass'n, Inc., 332 So.3d 1054 (Fla. App. 2021)
Florida District Court of Appeals
Extract
Florida law provides that homeowner associations may maintain lawsuits on behalf of their members against the developer 'concerning matters of common
interest to the members,' e.g., 'the common areas,' 'structural components of a building,' or 'other improvements for which the association is responsible.' §
720.303(1). See also Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.221 (providing that a homeowners association, 'after control of such association is obtained by homeowners or unit owners
other than the developer, may institute ... actions ... in its name on behalf of all association members concerning matters of common interest to the members,
including, but not limited to: [ ] the common property, area, or elements ... structural components of a building or other improvements ... for which the association
is responsible'). 'The sole requirement for the bundling of a class is that the members of the association have a common interest regarding the common elements
of the property.'
Summary
Florida law, specifically § 720.303(1) and Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.221, provides homeowners associations with the authority to maintain lawsuits on behalf of their
members concerning matters of common interest. This includes issues related to common areas, structural components, or other improvements for which the
association is responsible. The passage highlights the legal framework that allows associations to act collectively in legal matters once control is obtained by
homeowners or unit owners other than the developer.

the financial and legal mechanisms available to HOAs under Florida law.
Seaside Town Council, Inc. v. Seaside Cmty. Dev. Corp., 347 So.3d 89 (Fla. App. 2021)
Florida District Court of Appeals
Extract
In June 2018, SCDC moved for summary judgment. The gist of SCDC's motion was that STC lacked standing to sue under chapter 720, Florida Statutes,
because it is not authorized to represent the nine neighborhood associations, it is not an association, and even if it were an association it failed to comply with the
requirements of chapter 720 to file the action. Further, as an alternative, SCDC argued that chapter 720 did not apply to commercial parcels in the community
consisting of the Town Center and the Lyceum and that the declarations governing Seaside were not subject to the prohibition of certain clauses in association
documents as contained in section 720.3075 because the declarations predated the statute by decades. Finally, SCDC argued that STC's authority is limited to
the provisions of the declarations of each of the nine associations it purportedly represents, and STC has no power to act beyond the provisions as adopted by
each of those associations.
Summary

Fla. Stat. § 720.302 Fla. Stat. § 720.302 Purposes, Scope, and Application
Extract
The purposes of this chapter are to give statutory recognition to corporations not for profit that operate residential communities in this state, to provide procedures
for operating homeowners' associations, and to protect the rights of association members without unduly impairing the ability of such associations to perform their
functions. The Legislature recognizes that it is not in the best interest of homeowners' associations or the individual association members thereof to create or
impose a bureau or other agency of state government to regulate the affairs of homeowners' associations. However, in accordance with s. 720.311, the
Legislature finds that homeowners' associations and their individual members will benefit from an expedited alternative process for resolution of election and
recall disputes and presuit mediation of other disputes involving covenant enforcement and authorizes the department to hear, administer, and determine these
disputes as more fully set forth in this chapter.

Application of the Florida-Friendly Landscaping Statute to Homeowner Disputes Regarding Violation of Restrictive Covenants.
Florida Bar Journal - Florida Bar - Van Treese, Jeffery W., II - 2020-11-01
Extract
F.S. [section]720.3075(4) (a) (titled, 'Prohibited clauses in association documents') recites verbatim the 'compelling public interest' language used in F.S.
[section]373.185(3)(a), further emphasizing the priority the Florida Legislature has placed on water conservation and environmental protection... F.S.
[section]720.305 entitled, 'Obligations of members; remedies at law or in equity, levy of fines and suspension of use rights,' includes subsection (2), which
provides that an association may levy a fine of up to $100 per violation for failure to comply with any rules established by the association... F.A.C.R. 61E14-2.001,
which governs the standards of professional conduct for licensed community association managers, contains no reference to Florida-friendly landscaping, and
there is no language in that rule establishing liability and/or disciplinary action for a community association manager willfully disregarding the protections afforded
to homeowners under F.S. [section]...
Summary
The passage highlights specific sections of the Florida Statutes and the Florida Administrative Code that are relevant to HOAs. F.S. [section]720.3075(4)(a) and
F.S. [section]720.305 are key provisions that address prohibited clauses in association documents and the obligations and remedies available to HOA members,
respectively. Additionally, F.A.C.R. 61E14-2.001 outlines the standards for community association managers but lacks specific references to Florida-friendly
landscaping. These provisions collectively illustrate the regulatory framework governing HOAs, particularly in the context of environmental protection and
landscaping.
