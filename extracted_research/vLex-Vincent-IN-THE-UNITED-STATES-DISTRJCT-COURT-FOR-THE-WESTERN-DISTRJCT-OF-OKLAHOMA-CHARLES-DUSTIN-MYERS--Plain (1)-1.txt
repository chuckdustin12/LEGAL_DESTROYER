IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRJCT COURT FOR THE WESTERN DISTRJCT
OF OKLAHOMA CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, Plaintiff, vs. DANIEL
KENNETH BRANTHOOVER & MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS
Defendant. ) ) ) ) Case No. CIV-24-1311-R ) ) ) ) DEFENDANT'S MOTION TO
DISMISS FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT COMES NOW Defendant, Daniel
Kenneth Branthoover and Morgan Michelle Myers, pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6)
and Rule 12(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and respectfully
moves this Court to dismiss Plaintiffs First Amended Complaint for failure to
state a claim upon which relief can be granted and for improper venue. In
support thereof, Defendant submits the following Memorandum of Law.
MEMORANDUM OF LAW 1. Plaintiffs First Amended Complaint fails to
allege facts sufficient to support a claim under the Racketeer Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations Act (RJCO), 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961-1968. 1 2. The
Complaint lacks the necessary elements of a RICO claim, including a valid
enterprise, a pattern of racketeering activity, and specific predicate acts. 3.
Plaintiff's allegations are conclusory and speculative, and do not meet the
pleading standards required under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a) and
the Supreme Court's decisions in Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S.
544 (2007), and Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662 (2009). 4. Venue is improper
in the Western District of Oklahoma under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b), as the events
giving rise to the claims occurred primarily outside this district. 5. Failure to
Plead Fraud with Particularity (Rule 9(b)) Plaintiffs allegations of wire fraud,
which form the basis of the alleged RICO predicate acts, fail to meet the
heightened pleading standard of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b ). The
Complaint does not specify the time, place, or content of the alleged
fraudulent communications, nor does it identify the specific roles of each
Defendant in the purported scheme. See Tal v. Hogan, 453 F.3d 1244, 1263
(10th Cir. 2006). 6. Improper Use of Domestic Dispute as Basis for RICO
Plaintiff's allegations arise primarily from a domestic dispute and related
family court proceedings. Courts have consistently held that such disputes
do not constitute the type of organized criminal activity contemplated by
RICO. See Annulli v. Panikkar, 200 F.3d 189, 200 (3d Cir. 1999) (holding that
'garden-variety state law fraud' and domestic disputes are not actionable
under RICO). 2 7. No Standing Under RICO Plaintiff lacks standing to bring
a RICO claim because he has not alleged a concrete injury to business or
property as required under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c). Allegations of emotional
distress, reputational harm, or speculative business losses are insufficient.
See Holmes v. Sec. Investor Prot. Corp., 503 U.S. 258, 268 (1992). 8. Plaintiff
fails to allege continuity ofracketeering activity as required under 18 U.S.C.
§ 1961(5). The alleged conduct spans a short period and does not
demonstrate a threat of ongoing criminal activity. See H.J. Inc. v.
Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 241-42 (1989). 9. Accordingly, the
Complaint should be dismissed in its entirety. WHEREFORE, Defendant
respectfully requests that the Court grant this Motion and dismiss Plaintiffs
First Amended Complaint with prejudice, and for such other relief as the
Court deems just and proper. Respectfully sub -- ~ Daniel Kenn~ver 3100

OKLAHOMA CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, Plaintiff, v. DANIEL KENNETH
BRANTHOOVER & MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS Defendants § § § § § § Case
No. CIV-24-1311-R§ § § § FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT Plaintiff Charles
Dustin Myers, representing himself pro-se and proceeding in forma pauperis
respectfully files this First Amended Complaint against Daniel Kenneth
Branthoover and Morgan Michelle Myers. The original complaint filed on
December 16, 2024, is respectfully amended to incorporate Morgan
Michelle Myers as an additional defendant and Plaintiff has provided this
Court with the necessary materials to effectuate service prior to the July 11
deadline, as extended by this court pursuant to its recent order issued on
June 11, 2025.1 1 See Doc 15. 2 I. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 1. This
Honorable Court possesses subject matter jurisdiction over this action
pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331, as Plaintiff’s claims arise under the laws of the
United States, specifically the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c) and § 1964(d), which explicitly
grants federal courts jurisdiction over civil RICO actions. Further,
jurisdiction is established under 18 U.S.C. § 1965, which provides for
nationwide service of process and jurisdiction in RICO actions, thereby
ensuring that all Defendants, regardless of their physical location within the
United States, are subject to the jurisdiction of this Court. 2. Venue is proper
in the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma
pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 1965(a) and 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b). A substantial part of
the events or omissions giving rise to the claims asserted herein occurred
within this District. 3. Additionally, “any person injured in his business or
property by reason of a violation of section 1962…may sue therefor in any
appropriate United States district court and shall recover threefold the
damages he sustains and the cost of the suit, including a reasonable
attorney’s fee…” 18 U.S.C § 1964. Plaintiff alleges to have a direct and
ongoing injury to his business and property as a result from the alleged
predicate acts herein. 3 II. PARTIES A. Identification 4. Plaintiff Charles
Dustin Myers, referred to herein as “Plaintiff”, is a natural person and a
resident of the State of Texas and is legally domiciled in Tarrant County. 5.
Defendant Daniel Kenneth Branthoover, referred to herein as “Branthoover”,
is a natural person and a resident of the state of Oklahoma and is domiciled
in Canadian County. 6. Defendant Morgan Michelle Myers, referred to
herein as “Myers”, is a natural person, and a resident of the State of Texas
and is legally domiciled in Tarrant County. 7. Collectively, Branthoover and
Myers are referred to herein as “the Defendants”. B. Representation 8.
Plaintiff is representing himself in this matter. 9. Myers is believed to be self-
represented at this time. 10. Branthoover is believed to be self-represented
at this time. 4 III. PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 11. At the heart of this
litigation lies a deliberate and orchestrated scheme by Defendants Morgan
Michelle Myers and Daniel Kenneth Branthoover, who strategically chose to
displace Plaintiff from his home and destabilize his financial and familial
security. Branthoover administered and Myers meticulously executed a
calculated plan involving interstate travel, fraudulent affidavits, deliberate
perjury, asset diversion, and systematic manipulation of multiple Texas state
courts to escape accountability for her actions. 12. To carry out this scheme,
Myers enlisted the assistance of Daniel Kenneth Branthoover, a resident of
Yukon Oklahoma, who has a prior history regarding violations of protective
orders and tampering with government documents. For no other reason than
to escape accountability for her affair, Myers spun an elaborate web of lies

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
and weaponized her family and court procedures designed to help victims of
abuse. 13. What emerges from the evidence is not a domestic dispute gone
awry, but a textbook criminal enterprise created within this Court’s
Jurisdiction. This is the story of how a person corruptly influenced the very
courts designed to protect families—transforming them into instruments of
fraud, extortion, and systematic theft. It is a tale of how two individuals,
connected by a common goal, orchestrated a seventeen-month reign of
terror that began in Oklahoma and was carried out in the Texas courts. 14.
The Defendants did not merely lie to courts—they constructed an elaborate
criminal enterprise with defined roles, coordinated operations, and a
singular mission: to strip Plaintiff of everything he held dear through the
systematic corruption of judicial 5 proceedings. They engaged in laundering
funds across state lines while concurrently submitting fraudulent indigency
claims. They did not just fabricate allegations—they manufactured an entire
false narrative of domestic violence, complete with non-existent protective
orders and imaginary threats, all while the supposed "victim" continued to
share a bed with her alleged "abuser." 15. This case shows how the family
court system can be perverted by those willing to commit federal crimes to
achieve their goals. It reveals how easily the sacred trust placed in sworn
affidavits can be shattered by defendants who view perjury not as a crime,
but as a tool. Most importantly, it demonstrates that when domestic
relations become the vehicle for interstate racketeering, federal intervention
is not just appropriate—it is essential. 16. This is not a story about a
marriage that failed. This is simply the product of a litigant who values her
extramarital relationships over morality, and who chose to weaponize her
family against Plaintiff for the sole purpose of escaping accountability. 17.
After extensive research and vigorous advocacy, Plaintiff asserts that
Defendants engaged in racketeering activity through an organized
enterprise, seeking relief to prevent its finalization. Against all odds, and in
support of this preliminary statement, Plaintiff alleges the following: 6 IV.
FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS A. Enterprise Formation and Initial Criminal
Coordination (December 14-15, 2023) 18. Defendant Branthoover possesses
extensive knowledge of protective order procedures and requirements due
to his prior criminal convictions involving violations of such orders. This
knowledge would prove instrumental in the enterprise's systematic
manipulation of protective order proceedings. 19. On December 14, 2023,
immediately following Plaintiff's discovery of Defendant Myers' extramarital
affair, she initiated the criminal enterprise by taking two coordinated
actions: first, she opened a private bank account in her sole name to
facilitate asset concealment; and second, she commenced intensive
interstate communications with Defendant Branthoover via text messaging.
The scope and intensity of these communications—totaling 92 text messages
exchanged between Branthoover's registered number 940-312-3434 and
Myers' registered number 817-235-5189 on this single day—demonstrates
the deliberate and coordinated nature of their criminal planning. 20. While
coordinating with Branthoover, Defendant Myers tried to secure an ex-parte
protective order against Plaintiff, without legitimate cause. This action
marks the enterprise's first attempt to manipulate judicial proceedings
through false allegations. 21. Despite having just sought emergency
protection from Plaintiff hours earlier, Myers casually reminded him of their
child's school field trip scheduled for the following day, thereby creating a
facade of normalcy designed to conceal her fraudulent intentions and

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
prevent suspicion of the enterprise's activities. 7 B. Interstate Criminal
Coordination and Financial Crimes (December 15-16, 2023) 22. On
December 15, 2023, at precisely 9:51 A.M. CST, Defendant Branthoover
contacted Plaintiff directly, employing calculated deception by stating, "I've
been where you are before. I want to help both of you." This communication,
referencing Myers' December 1, 2023 divorce announcement, was designed
to establish false pretenses for Myers' planned interstate travel to Oklahoma
for criminal coordination purposes. 23. During this deceptive phone
conversation, Branthoover established the operational framework for the
next phase of the criminal scheme by arranging for Myers to visit his
Oklahoma residence over the weekend of December 15, 2023. The stated
purpose—"providing space" to Myers—was a deliberate misrepresentation
designed to conceal the true criminal purpose of coordinating fraudulent
document preparation and enterprise operations. 24. Having no reason to
suspect Branthoover's dishonest intentions, Plaintiff unwittingly facilitated
the enterprise's criminal coordination by agreeing to Myers' travel to
Oklahoma. 25. Immediately following Branthoover's deceptive phone call,
the enterprise executed its first major financial crime. Plaintiff received
notification that Myers had transferred $1,576 from the parties' joint marital
PNC account to Branthoover's PayPal account (username "dmb575"),
completely depleting the account balance. This interstate wire transfer
represents a critical predicate act, utilizing interstate commerce to further
the criminal scheme while simultaneously depriving Plaintiff of operating
funds necessary for his legitimate business operations, household bills, and
Christmas gifts. 8 26. The immediate and devastating impact of this financial
crime became apparent on December 16, 2023, when Plaintiff received
notification that the joint marital PNC account was overdrawn by $800.00.
Concurrently, Plaintiff discovered that advertisements for his legitimate
home-based business had ceased running due to payment failure directly
caused by the enterprise's theft of operating funds. This demonstrates the
enterprise's deliberate intent to cause maximum financial harm to Plaintiff.
27. The criminal nature of this financial transaction is conclusively
established by documentary evidence. The PNC bank statement for
December 2023 provides irrefutable proof of the unauthorized withdrawal,
documenting the precise date, amount, and destination of the fraudulent
transfer. 28. The direct connection between Defendant Branthoover and this
financial crime is established through multiple forms of evidence. The PayPal
identifier "dmb575" appearing on Plaintiff's bank statement directly
corresponds to Branthoover's PayPal account, creating an unbreakable
evidentiary chain linking him to the illicit financial transaction, corroborated
by his own admissions in subsequent text communications. 29. On December
16, 2023, at precisely 3:54 P.M. CST, Plaintiff made a good-faith attempt to
resolve the situation amicably by sending a detailed text message to
Defendant Branthoover. This communication explicitly requested the return
of the fraudulently transferred $1,576, detailed the intended legitimate use
of these funds, described the financial hardship caused by the theft
(including late bills and business disruption), explained Plaintiff's inability to
work due to the severe emotional distress 9 caused by Defendants' criminal
actions, and expressed his sincere desire for an amicable resolution during
the holiday season. 30. Defendant Branthoover's response to this reasonable
request revealed the true criminal nature of the enterprise. In a callous and
dismissive reply, Branthoover stated, "You Are Getting Divorced..." followed

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
by, "I hope I can help with the paperwork and make things go as smoothly as
possible." Far from the helpful assistance initially promised, this
communication constituted a direct threat and overt act in furtherance of
the criminal conspiracy, demonstrating Branthoover's intent to exploit
Plaintiff's financial distress for the enterprise's benefit while utilizing
interstate communications to further the scheme. 31. This communication
also establishes Branthoover's unauthorized practice of law across state
lines. At no time relevant to this litigation has Defendant Branthoover
possessed a license to practice law in any jurisdiction within the United
States. His statements regarding "paperwork" and making legal proceedings
"go as smoothly as possible" constitute clear evidence of unauthorized legal
practice and demonstrate his administrative role in directing the
enterprise's criminal activities. C. Coordinated Eviction Attempt Fraud and
Interstate Document Transportation (December 17, 2023) 32. On December
17, 2023, at approximately 11:00 A.M., Plaintiff was served with an eviction
notice by the grandmother of Myers, who is also the landlord of the
matrimonial residence, which contained the following false information: i. A
purported “lease violation,” which was entirely fabricated as no 10 valid
lease agreement existed between Plaintiff and Wilson; ii. The assertion that
“Granddaughter getting divorced,” referring to Defendant Myers, as a basis
for eviction; iii. The false claim that a “Protective order has been filed.” iv.
The directive that “He must leave. She and the girls may stay,”
demonstrating the clear intent to dispossess Plaintiff for the benefit of
Myers. 33. The coordinated and premeditated nature of this eviction fraud is
established by the timing of its execution. At the precise moment this
fraudulent notice was being served in Texas, Defendant Myers was
physically present in Oklahoma with Defendant Branthoover, actively
collaborating in the preparation of the very fraudulent court documents
referenced in the eviction notice. 34. Myers' knowledge of the fraudulent
nature of the eviction attempt is conclusively established. She possessed
actual knowledge that no valid lease agreement existed, and she had actual
knowledge that neither divorce proceedings nor protective orders had been
filed at the time of service, making her participation in the eviction fraud a
knowing and willful criminal act. 35. On December 17, 2023, Defendant
Myers completed the interstate transportation phase of the criminal scheme
by transporting the fraudulent court documents prepared in Oklahoma back
across state lines to Texas. These documents, including the Original Petition
for Divorce and Affidavit of Indigency, were specifically 11 prepared with the
intent of submitting them to Texas state courts to further the enterprise's
fraudulent manipulation of judicial proceedings. 36. Upon her return to
Texas, Myers demonstrated her control over the eviction fraud by personally
destroying the fraudulent eviction notice. She physically tore the notice in
half and wrote "VOID" on it in black marker, providing clear evidence of her
influence over and coordination of the fraudulent eviction attempt
orchestrated during her absence in Oklahoma. D. Operational Security and
Document Preparation (December 17-18, 2023) 37. As part of the
enterprise's operational security measures, Defendant Myers returned from
Oklahoma equipped with a canister of pepper spray, designed to support the
false narrative of domestic violence that would be central to the fraudulent
court documents prepared during her Oklahoma visit. 38. During her
Oklahoma visit, Defendant Myers acquired a secondary phone number
(817-940-0852) as a deliberate operational security measure. This

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
acquisition, which she explicitly disclosed to Plaintiff, constituted an overt
act in furtherance of the criminal enterprise, designed to facilitate
clandestine communications related to the fraudulent scheme while
concealing the enterprise's ongoing criminal coordination from detection.
39. This newly acquired secondary phone number became an integral
component of the fraudulent court documents prepared under Defendant
Branthoover's direct administrative oversight. The systematic use of this
number across multiple fraudulent legal documents demonstrates the
coordinated nature of the enterprise's document 12 preparation activities.
These documents, prepared in Oklahoma with the specific intent of
unlawfully influencing Texas legal proceedings, included: i. An "Original
Petition for Divorce" dated December 18, 2023, containing numerous
material false statements designed to deceive the Texas courts; ii. An
"Affidavit of Indigency" dated December 18, 2023, containing deliberate
misrepresentations regarding Myers' financial status to defraud the court of
legitimate filing fees; iii. A "Request for Uncontested Cases" dated
December 18, 2023, fraudulently filed despite the complete absence of any
communication between the parties regarding divorce proceedings; iv. An
"Application for Protective Order" dated December 22, 2023, containing
entirely fabricated allegations of family violence. E. Unauthorized Practice
of Law and Intimidation (December 18, 2023) 42. 40. Following the filing of
the initial fraudulent divorce documents on December 18, 2023, Defendant
Branthoover escalated his unauthorized practice of law by sending Plaintiff a
text message asserting legal representation and attempting to control all
future communications. The message stated: “Charlie, it’s come to my
understanding you have retained an attorney. I’m sure he has told you that
all further communication should take place between attorneys. I must
formally ask you refrain from discussing details of this case with my client
moving forward and only communicate with me or your attorney.” 13 This
communication was a deliberate attempt to isolate Plaintiff from direct
communication with Myers and to control the flow of information, thereby
hindering Plaintiff’s ability to uncover the full extent of the fraudulent
scheme. This communication also evidences that Branthoover’s role went
beyond helping Myers prepare the documents by seeing them through to
their submission and asserting an administrative role over the proceedings
to intimidate Plaintiff. F. Service Through Official Channels and Continued
Deception (December 22-28, 2023) 41. In furtherance of the criminal
scheme, and despite continuing to cohabitate with Plaintiff in the marital
residence, Defendant Myers deliberately utilized official constable service to
effectuate service of the fraudulent divorce petition and protective order
application, which occurred on December 27, 2023. This calculated use of
official legal processes to serve fraudulent documents while maintaining the
deceptive facade of normalcy at home demonstrates the sophisticated and
deliberate nature of the enterprise's operations. 42. The enterprise's
manipulation of official legal processes continued when Myers, despite
residing next door to Plaintiff, deliberately influenced and coordinated the
constable service of the fraudulent eviction documents, which occurred on
December 28, 2023. This systematic abuse of official legal processes while
maintaining physical proximity and continued cohabitation reveals the
calculated and deceptive nature of the enterprise's operations. 14 G.
Systematic False Statements in Sworn Court Documents (December 18,
2023) 43. When reviewing the documents prepared in part by Branthoover

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
and filed with the court by Myers, there existed several false statements and
were intended to deceive the court and prejudice Plaintiff in furtherance of
the scheme to dispose him of his property interests. Specifically, these false
statements included, but were not limited to: i. The assertion that the
spouses had ceased living together on December 1, 2023, when in fact they
were still residing together at the marital home on that date and for several
weeks thereafter. ii. The claim that Defendant Myers owned both family
vehicles as her separate property prior to the marriage, which was
demonstrably false as these vehicles were acquired during the marriage and
constituted community property, paid for by Plaintiff. iii. The representation
that Defendant Myers had an active order of protection against Plaintiff with
a judicial finding that family violence had occurred during the marriage,
which was fabricated and without any basis in fact or law. iv. The assertion
that the children or Defendant Myers would be subjected to harassment or
abuse if Plaintiff were provided with her second phone number
(817-940-0852) acquired in Oklahoma, which was a baseless and
manipulative claim designed to conceal her communications related to the
fraudulent scheme. 15 44. Concurrently with the fraudulent divorce petition,
Defendant Myers, again with the administrative oversight and full
knowledge of Defendant Branthoover, filed a fraudulent “Affidavit of
Indigency” with the court. This affidavit contained material
misrepresentations regarding Defendant Myers’ financial status, all of which
were known to be false at the time of filing and were intended to defraud the
court and avoid legitimate court costs. Specifically, these false statements
included: i. The claim that Defendant Myers was financially indigent and
unable to pay court costs, despite her access to and control over substantial
marital assets. ii. The representation that Defendant Myers was solely
responsible for all family living expenses, including rent, utilities, food, and
other living expenses, when in fact, Plaintiff was the primary breadwinner of
the household at that time. iii. The assertion that Defendant Myers was
solely responsible for both car payments, which she has no payment history
to support such a claim. H. Escalation Through Fabricated Violence
Allegations (December 22, 2023) 45. On December 22, 2023, despite having
claimed in her divorce petition to already possess an active protective order,
Myers filed an "Application for Protective Order," revealing the
contradictory and fabricated nature of her previous representations while
escalating the enterprise's fraudulent manipulation of judicial proceedings.
16 46. Upon review, defendant Myers made additional false statements
within the sworn document, all intended to further deceive the court and
secure an unwarranted protective order against Plaintiff to effectuate the
enterprises’ goal of divesting him of his property interests. These false
statements included, but were not limited to: i. The claim that family
violence occurred on December 18, 2023, in the presence of the children,
which was entirely false and fabricated. ii. The assertion that family violence
occurred prior to December 18, 2023, which was also false and without any
factual basis. iii. The request that Plaintiff take a battering intervention
program. I. Achievement of Primary Criminal Objective (January 16, 2024)
47. On January 16, 2024, the enterprise's criminal scheme achieved its
primary objective when Plaintiff appeared before the 322nd District Court of
Tarrant County and was ordered to vacate the family residence.
Significantly, this order was entered without any evidentiary hearing and
without judicial findings regarding the allegations contained in the

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
fraudulent documents, demonstrating that the court's decision was based
entirely on the false information systematically presented by the
Defendants. 48. The causal relationship between the Defendant’s fraudulent
representations and this judicial outcome is conclusively established. The
misinformation presented to the court through the coordinated fraudulent
documents was the sole basis for the court's decision, providing Myers with
the exact advantage that she and Branthoover had anticipated and planned
through significant and intentional misrepresentations. 17 J. Ongoing
Pattern of Racketeering Activity and Continuity (January 2024 - Present) 49.
Between January 16, 2024, and the present day, Defendants Myers and
Branthoover have continued to further their racketeering activity through a
series of ongoing illicit acts, demonstrating a clear pattern of continuity and
relatedness. These acts include, but are not limited to: i. Myers and
Branthoover continuing to engage in interstate communications regarding
case details between one another across state lines, specifically between
Texas and Oklahoma, in direct furtherance of their fraudulent scheme to see
the divorce through to its finalization. ii. Branthoover delivering ongoing
threats and intimidation to Plaintiff regarding his legitimate attempts to
seek legal relief from the orders that were a product of the Defendants’
actions, which occurred in December of 2023, June of 2024, December of
2024, and May of 2025. iii. Making direct statements such as “I’ve been
enjoying watching every filing get denied” by Branthoover, showing the
malicious intent behind his involvement as Plaintiff sought relief for their
coordinated actions. 50. On June 23, 2024, Defendant Branthoover
continued his pattern of harassment and intimidation by sending Plaintiff a
text message stating, "Lol. And here comes 18 another denial," in direct
reference to Plaintiff's court filing seeking to enjoin Branthoover as a party
to the divorce proceedings. This communication provides conclusive
evidence of Branthoover's continued awareness of and active involvement in
the Texas legal proceedings, his ongoing monitoring of court filings, and his
malicious intent to mock and intimidate Plaintiff's efforts to seek justice
through legitimate legal channels. 51. On December 12, 2024, Branthoover
escalated his threatening communications by sending Plaintiff a message
stating, "When things all over you get to deal with me. Just a heads up,"
demonstrating the enterprise's ongoing criminal intent and explicit threats
of future retaliation against Plaintiff for his efforts to expose and seek relief
from their criminal activities. 52. Most recently, on May 24, 2025,
Branthoover sent Plaintiff a message stating, "Where's my lawsuit? Heard
your vm about me. File it. Let's do this :)" This communication demonstrates
the enterprise's continued operation, Branthoover's ongoing monitoring of
Plaintiff's activities, and his explicit challenge and threat regarding potential
legal action, providing clear evidence of the enterprise's ongoing criminal
intent and the continuing threat posed to Plaintiff. 53. As a direct result of
the actions outlined above, Plaintiff has sustained substantial injury to his
business and property. 54. Plaintiff now turns to discuss the elements of
RICO and the alleged predicate acts committed by the Defendants in this
matter. 19 V. INTRODUCTION TO RICO 55. Plaintiff realleges and
incorporates by reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through
54 above, as if fully set forth herein. 56. The Racketeer Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) requires proof of a "pattern of
racketeering activity," which the Supreme Court has consistently held
consists of two essential elements: relatedness and continuity of predicate

=== PAGE 9 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
acts. Based on the provided facts and the applicable law, the Defendants'
series of related acts spanning from December 2023 through May 2025
(approximately 18 months) satisfies both the relatedness requirement (as
the acts share similar purposes, participants, and methods) and the
continuity requirement (as they extend over a substantial period of time)
necessary to establish a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO as
explained in more detail below. 57. For there to be a pattern of racketeering
activity, there must be conduct committed by an enterprise that is prohibited
under 18 U.S.C. § 1961. In the instant matter, Defendants are alleged to
have committed several predicate acts, including wire fraud, violations of
the Travel Act, and perjury/subordination of perjury to support a pattern of
racketeering activity, as explained in more detail below. VI. PREDICATE ACT
– WIRE FRAUD (18 U.S.C. § 1343) 58. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by
reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 57 above, as if
fully set forth herein. 59. The relevant federal statutes in this analysis are 18
U.S.C. § 1343 (Wire Fraud) and 18 U.S.C. § 1961 (RICO Definitions). 20 60.
Title 18 U.S.C. § 1343 states: "Whoever, having devised or intending to
devise any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or property
by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises,
transmits or causes to be transmitted by means of wire, radio, or television
communication in interstate or foreign commerce, any writings, signs,
signals, pictures, or sounds for the purpose of executing such scheme or
artifice, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years,
or both." 61. The facts above establish all three elements of wire fraud
under 18 U.S.C. § 1343—a scheme to defraud, use of interstate wire
communications, and intent to deprive another of money or property—
qualifying it as a RICO predicate act under 18 U.S.C. § 1961. A. Scheme to
Defraud 62. The first element of wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343 is the
existence of "a scheme to defraud." As noted in United States v. Greenberg,
835 F.3d 295 (2nd Cir. 2016), this constitutes an "essential element" of the
crime. In the present case, Myers transferred $1,576 from a joint marital
PNC account to Branthoover's PayPal account, depleting the account
entirely. This transfer was not an isolated action but was accompanied by "a
series of coordinated text messages and phone calls" between Myers and
Branthoover regarding the scheme, and followed after a deceptive message
was sent from Branthoover to Plaintiff. 63. The coordination between the
parties through multiple communications channels demonstrates a
deliberate plan rather than a spontaneous or inadvertent action. As
articulated in Mail and Wire Fraud, a "scheme to defraud requires a material
falsehood, material misrepresentation, or the concealment of a material
fact." By 21 transferring funds from a joint marital account without apparent
authorization from the joint account holder, Myers engaged in conduct that
reflects the concealment of material facts regarding the disposition of
marital assets. 64. The scheme in this case specifically targeted marital
funds, and community property, which are legally considered shared
property between spouses. By depleting the account, Myers intentionally
deprived the Plaintiff of access to funds to which he was legally entitled.
This satisfies the requirement that the scheme have "money or property as
the object of the scheme" as stated in Smulley v. Fed. Hous. Fin. Agency,
17-2666 (2nd Cir. Oct 05, 2018). B. Use of Interstate Wire Communications
65. The second element of wire fraud requires the "use of the mails or wires
to further the scheme." United States v. Greenberg, 835 F.3d 295 (2nd Cir.

=== PAGE 10 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
2016). The facts demonstrate that Myers used interstate wire
communications in two distinct ways: i. The transfer of $1,576 was
"executed via interstate wire (bank to PayPal)," which constitutes an
electronic transmission across state lines. ii. The transfer "was accompanied
by a series of coordinated text messages and phone calls between Myers (in
Texas) and Branthoover (in Oklahoma) regarding the scheme." 66. Wire
transmissions include interstate telephone calls or electronic transmissions.
Furthermore, internet communications satisfy the interstate nexus 22
requirement, even in the absence of proof that a fraudulent communication
traveled through out-of-state servers. 67. The interstate nature of these
communications is established by the fact that Myers was in Texas while
Branthoover was in Oklahoma during their communications about the
scheme. This satisfies the jurisdictional requirement that the wire
communication cross state lines. C. Intend to Defraud 68. The third element
requires that the defendant acted "with the intent to defraud." As stated in
U.S. v. Blackmon, 839 F.2d 900 (2nd Cir. 1988), the wire fraud statute
requires that the defendant "be a party to some kind of scheme to defraud, a
requirement that includes a high degree of scienter and moral culpability."
69. Here, Branthoover specifically stated that he wanted to help Plaintiff,
which he knew was not a true statement at the time. The fact that text and
phone communications were used to deceive Plaintiff into believing that
Myers’ interstate travel would be beneficial for him further supports a
scheme to defraud, because the transfer of funds occurred after this false
extension of help from Branthoover. 70. In summary, the facts presented
establish all required elements of wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343,
qualifying it as a predicate act for RICO purposes under 18 U.S.C. § 1961,
committed by both Defendants. D. Potential Defenses 71. One potential
defense might be that Myers, as a joint account holder, had legal authority
to transfer funds from the account. However, this authority does not extend
to 23 depleting the account for personal gain in coordination with a third
party with the intent to deprive the other account holder of their rightful
access to the funds. The joint nature of the account creates a fiduciary duty
to act in good faith regarding the shared asset. That fiduciary duty was
willingly violated when Myers chose to transfer the funds to Branthoover’s
PayPal, and then later to herself. The appropriate method would have been
for Myers to transfer the funds directly to herself, but she avoided this to
conceal her bank account information in furtherance of a broader scheme.
72. This argument fails because the proceeds from the transfer were used to
acquire a second phone in furtherance of the broader scheme. VII.
PREDICATE ACT – VIOLATION OF THE TRAVEL ACT (18 U.S.C. § 1952) 73.
Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations contained in
paragraphs 1 through 72 above, as if fully set forth herein. 74. The Travel
Act, codified at 18 U.S.C. § 1952, criminalizes interstate travel or the use of
interstate facilities with the intent to promote, manage, establish, carry on,
or facilitate unlawful activity, followed by the performance or attempted
performance of such acts. According to 18 U.S.C. § 1952: "Whoever travels
in interstate or foreign commerce or uses the mail or any facility in
interstate or foreign commerce, with intent to- ... otherwise promote,
manage, establish, carry on, or facilitate the promotion, management,
establishment, or carrying on, of any unlawful activity, and thereafter
performs or attempts to perform- ... an act described in paragraph or shall
be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both..." 75.

=== PAGE 11 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
The statute has three essential elements: i. Interstate travel or use of
interstate facilities 24 ii. Intent to promote, manage, establish, carry on, or
facilitate unlawful activity iii. Subsequent performance or attempted
performance of acts in furtherance of the unlawful activity 76. For a Travel
Act violation to serve as a RICO predicate act, it must be "indictable" under
18 U.S.C. § 1952. Myers' conduct, as analyzed above, satisfies all elements of
a Travel Act violation: i. Myers engaged in interstate travel between Texas
and Oklahoma. ii. Myers traveled with the specific intent to coordinate the
preparation of fraudulent court documents and execute a criminal scheme.
Under United States v. Compton, 355 F.2d 872 (6th Cir. 1966), this intent
can be inferred from "evidence of a substantial course of illegal conduct,
occurring a reasonable time before and after an act of interstate travel." The
preparation of fraudulent court documents falls within the definition of
"unlawful activity" under the Travel Act, as it involves fraud, which is
indictable under state law. iii. After the interstate travel, Myers engaged in
overt acts to further the unlawful activity by preparing fraudulent legal
documents and coordinating the fraudulent scheme. As U.S. v. Admon, 940 F.
2d 1121 (8th Cir. 1991) clarified, the conduct after travel need not itself be
unlawful but must further the unlawful activity. The preparation and use of
fraudulent documents clearly meet this requirement. 25 77. Given that
Myers' conduct satisfies all elements of a Travel Act violation, this violation
qualifies as an "indictable" offense under 18 U.S.C. § 1952. As such, it
constitutes a valid predicate act for RICO purposes under 18 U.S.C. §
1961(1). 78. The Supreme Court's explanation in Perrin v. United States, 444
U.S. 37 (1979) that the Travel Act was intended to provide "a second layer of
enforcement" for interstate criminal activity underscores the significance of
federalizing crimes that cross state lines. Myers' conduct, involving
interstate travel for the purpose of engaging in fraudulent activities, is
precisely the type of behavior that the Travel Act was designed to address.
VIII. PATTERN OF RACKETEERING ACTIVITY 79. Plaintiff realleges and
incorporates by reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through
78 above, as if fully set forth herein. 80. A "pattern of racketeering activity"
requires at least two acts of "racketeering activity" occurring within a ten-
year period. 18 U.S.C. § 1961 (2025) ("'pattern of racketeering activity'
requires at least two acts of racketeering activity, one of which occurred
after the effective date of this chapter and the last of which occurred within
ten years (excluding any period of imprisonment) after the commission of a
prior act of racketeering activity"). 81. However, the mere existence of two
predicate acts is not automatically sufficient to establish a pattern. As
explained in Bonton v. Archer Chrysler Plymouth, Inc., 889 F.Supp. 995 (S.D.
Tex. 1995): 26 "Although at least two acts of racketeering are necessary to
constitute a pattern, two acts may not be sufficient. Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex
Co., 473 U.S. 479, 496 n. 14, 105 S.Ct. 3275, 3285 n. 14, 87 L.Ed.2d 346
(1985). RICO's legislative history leaves no doubt that 'there is something to
a RICO pattern beyond simply the number of predicate acts involved.'" 82.
Instead, courts have established that to prove a pattern, the predicate acts
must be both related and continuous. Bustos v. Invierte En Tex., 4:22-
CV-02690 (S.D. Tex. Jun 03, 2024) ("To rise to the level of 'racketeering
activity' there must be two or more predicate acts that are: (1) related; and
(2) amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity."). A.
Establishing a Pattern of Racketeering Activity 83. The factual allegations
identify several instances that constitute wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343

=== PAGE 12 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
and violations of the Travel Act under 18 U.S.C. § 1952: i. The extensive text
message communications (92 exchanges) on December 14, 2023, between
Myers and Branthoover using interstate wire facilities to coordinate their
scheme. ii. Branthoover's deceptive phone call to Plaintiff on December 15,
2023, where he falsely stated, "I've been where you are before. I want to
help both of you," to facilitate Myers' interstate travel to Oklahoma. iii. The
interstate wire transfer of $1,576 from the joint marital account to
Branthoover's PayPal account, which was executed to deprive Plaintiff of
funds. 27 iv. Branthoover's text messages to Plaintiff on December 16, 2023,
refusing to return the transferred funds and offering to "help with the
paperwork." v. Branthoover's text message on December 18, 2023, falsely
claiming to be a legal representative. vi. The ongoing interstate
communications between Myers and Branthoover to further their fraudulent
scheme, continuing through May 2025. 84. The factual allegations also
demonstrate potential Travel Act violations: i. Myers' interstate travel from
Texas to Oklahoma on December 15, 2023, with the intent to prepare
fraudulent court documents. ii. The interstate transportation of fraudulent
documents from Oklahoma back to Texas on December 17, 2023, intended
for filing in Texas courts. iii. The use of interstate facilities (phone calls, text
messages) to coordinate and further the fraudulent scheme. B. Relatedness
of Predicate Acts 85. The predicate acts of wire fraud and Travel Act
violations are clearly related, meeting the standard outlined in Bonton v.
Archer Chrysler Plymouth, Inc., 889 F.Supp. 995 (S.D. Tex. 1995). They
share: 28 i. Common Purpose: All acts were directed toward depriving
Plaintiff of his property rights and manipulating judicial proceedings to
benefit Myers in divorce proceedings. ii. Same Participants: Myers and
Branthoover were the consistent actors in all predicate acts. iii. Same
Victim: All acts targeted Plaintiff, causing him financial harm and depriving
him of legal rights. iv. Similar Methods: The acts consistently involved
deception, misrepresentation, and the manipulation of legal processes. v.
Temporal Connection: The acts occurred in a logical sequence, beginning on
December 14, 2023, and continuing through May 2025. C. Continuity of
Racketeering Activity 86. The pattern of racketeering activity demonstrates
both closed-ended and open-ended continuity: i. Closed-ended Continuity:
The scheme extends over a substantial period—from December 2023
through May 2025, over eighteen months. This satisfies the requirement for
"a series of related predicate acts extending over a substantial period of
time" as described in RICO: A Primer (2022).2 2 https://freemanlaw.com/
rico-a-primer/ 29 ii. Open-ended Continuity: The scheme also poses a threat
of continued criminal activity. Branthoover's message on May 24, 2025,
demonstrating continued monitoring of Plaintiff's activities and threatening
future retaliation, indicates that the racketeering activity could continue
indefinitely given that they are unable to finalize the divorce. This satisfies
the alternative requirement for "a threat of continuing criminal activity
extending indefinitely into the future" noted in RICO: A Primer (2022). D.
Role of Perjury and Subornation of Perjury 87. While perjury and
subornation of perjury in state court proceedings are not themselves listed
as predicate acts under RICO, they form an integral part of the overall
criminal scheme and help establish the pattern of racketeering activity when
considered alongside the actual predicate acts of wire fraud and Travel Act
violations. 88. As explained in RICO: A Primer (2022), racketeering acts
need not be similar or directly related to each other; they must simply be

=== PAGE 13 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
"related in some way to the affairs of the charged enterprise." The perjury
and subornation of perjury evident in the fraudulent court filings—including
the false statements in the divorce petition, the Affidavit of Indigency, and
the Application for Protective Order—are directly related to the predicate
acts of wire fraud and Travel Act violations. They share the same purpose,
involve the same participants, target the same victim, and form part of the
same overall scheme. For example: 30 i. The fraudulent court documents
were prepared during Myers' interstate travel to Oklahoma, connecting the
perjury to the Travel Act violation. ii. The false statements in these
documents were discussed and planned via interstate wire communications,
connecting the perjury to the wire fraud. iii. The deceptive interstate wire
transfer of funds was executed to support Myers during the divorce
proceedings initiated through fraudulent filings. iv. The perjerous
statements were influenced by Branthoover, connecting subordination of
perjury to the predicate acts. 89. These connections demonstrate how the
non-predicate acts of perjury committed by Myers and subornation of
perjury alleged against Branthoover, while not sufficient alone to establish a
RICO violation, contribute to the overall pattern of racketeering activity
when combined with the predicate acts of wire fraud and Travel Act
violations alleged by the Defendants. IX. ESTABLISHING AN ASSOCIATE-
IN-FACT ENTERPRISE 90. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference
the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 89 above, as if fully set
forth herein. 31 A. Formation of the Enterprise 91. The factual allegations
demonstrate the formation of an associate-in-fact enterprise between Myers
and Branthoover that satisfies the definition in 18 U.S.C. § 1961 (2025). i.
Myers and Branthoover associated for the common purpose of depriving
Plaintiff of his property rights through the manipulation of legal
proceedings. This shared objective is evident from their coordinated actions
beginning on December 14, 2023, immediately following Plaintiff's discovery
of Myers' affair. ii. Though informal, the enterprise had a clear
organizational structure as 1) Myers acted as the "inside" operative, with
direct access to marital assets and the ability to file fraudulent court
documents in Texas. 2) Branthoover served as the "outside" operative,
providing administrative oversight, expertise on protective orders due to his
prior criminal history (Paragraph 18), and a base of operations in Oklahoma.
3) Their respective roles complemented each other and demonstrated an
organized approach to their criminal scheme. iii. The enterprise functioned
as a continuing unit from December 2023 through May 2025, with
consistent roles and coordinated actions throughout this period. 32 B.
Maintenance of the Enterprise 92. The enterprise was maintained through
several key mechanisms: i. Continuous Communication: Myers and
Branthoover maintained regular interstate communications throughout the
scheme, beginning with the 92 text messages on December 14, 2023, and
continuing through May 2025. ii. Financial Support: The interstate wire
transfer of $1,576 from the joint marital account to Branthoover's PayPal
account provided financial resources to support the enterprise's activities.
iii. Operational Security Measures: The enterprise implemented specific
measures to protect its operations: 1) Myers acquired a secondary phone
number during her Oklahoma visit (Paragraph 38). iv. Myers returned with
pepper spray to support the false domestic violence narrative (Paragraph
37). v. Branthoover attempted to control communications by falsely claiming
legal representation (Paragraph 40). vi. Geographic Distribution: The

=== PAGE 14 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
enterprise maintained operations across state lines, with activities in both
Texas and Oklahoma, enhancing its ability to avoid detection and complicate
legal responses. 33 C. Enterprise Distinct from Racketeering Activity 93. As
Allstate Ins. Co. v. Donovan, CIVIL ACTION NO. H-12-0432 (S.D. Tex. Jul 03,
2012) reiterates, a RICO enterprise must be an entity ‘separate and apart
from the alleged pattern of racketeering’—not merely a conduit for the
predicate acts themselves. The nature and duration of the Myers–
Branthoover operation exhibits all three required elements: a separate
organizational purpose, defined roles within an enduring structure, and
coordinated decision-making extending beyond the January 16, 2024 initial
outcome, with the finalization of the scheme still pending. X. CLAIMS FOR
RELIEF COUNT 1: VIOLATION OF 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) Against All
Defendants 94. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the
allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 93 above, as if fully set forth
herein. 95. At all relevant times, Plaintiff was a person within the meaning of
18 U.S.C. §§ 1961(3) and 1964(c). 96. At all relevant times, each Defendant
was a person within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961(3) and 1962(c). 97. As
set forth above, Defendants Myers and Branthoover formed an association-
in-fact enterprise within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4) (the
"Enterprise"). The Enterprise was engaged in, and its activities affected,
interstate commerce. 98. The Enterprise had an ascertainable structure
separate and apart from the pattern of racketeering activity in which the
Defendants engaged. The Enterprise 34 maintained an existence beyond
that which was necessary to commit the predicate acts constituting the
pattern of racketeering activity. 99. In furtherance of the fraudulent scheme,
each Defendant conducted or participated, directly or indirectly, in the
conduct of the Enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity
within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961(1), 1961(5), and 1962(c). 100. As
detailed above, the Defendants committed multiple related acts of wire
fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1343 and Travel Act violations under 18
U.S.C. § 1952, and further committed acts of perjury and subordinated
perjury in furtherance of the scheme, constituting a pattern of racketeering
activity as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5). 101. The predicate acts committed
by the Defendants were related to each other in that they had the same or
similar purposes (to defraud Plaintiff of his property interests and
manipulate judicial proceedings), involved the same participants
(Defendants Myers and Branthoover), targeted the same victim (Plaintiff),
employed similar methods (deception, misrepresentation, and manipulation
of legal processes), and were not isolated events. 102. The predicate acts
committed by the Defendants demonstrate both closed-ended continuity,
spanning over eighteen months from December 2023 through May 2025,
and open-ended continuity, as evidenced by the ongoing threats and
monitoring activities continuing through May 2025, with the potential for
continued criminal activity in the future. 35 103. The Defendants
participated in the operation and management of the Enterprise by making
decisions on behalf of the Enterprise and by directing its affairs. Specifically:
i. Defendant Myers directed the Enterprise by initiating the criminal
scheme, communicating the scheme's objectives to Branthoover, opening a
private bank account, transferring marital funds, traveling interstate to
coordinate fraudulent document preparation, and filing fraudulent legal
documents in Texas courts. ii. Defendant Branthoover directed the
Enterprise by providing administrative oversight of the scheme, offering his

=== PAGE 15 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
expertise on protective order procedures, coordinating Myers' interstate
travel, receiving and retaining fraudulently transferred funds, preparing
fraudulent legal documents, and attempting to exert control over
communications related to the legal proceedings. 104. As a direct and
proximate result of the Defendants' violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), Plaintiff
has been injured in his business and property in an amount to be determined
at trial. Specifically, Plaintiff has suffered: i. Loss of $1,576 fraudulently
transferred from the joint marital account; ii. Business losses resulting from
the disruption of his home-based business operations; iii. Additional financial
damages resulting from the overdrawn account 36 and associated fees; iv.
Loss of real and personal property rights through the fraudulent
manipulation of judicial proceedings; vi. Ongoing damages resulting from
the continued operation of the Enterprise. 105. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §
1964(c), Plaintiff is entitled to recover from the Defendants threefold the
damages sustained, explained in more detail below. COUNT 2: VIOLATION
OF 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d) Against All Defendants 106. Plaintiff realleges and
incorporates by reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through
105 above, as if fully set forth herein. 107. Beginning on December 14,
2023, and continuing through at least May 24, 2025, the Defendants
knowingly, willfully, and unlawfully conspired to violate 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c),
that is, to conduct and participate, directly and indirectly, in the conduct of
the affairs of the Enterprise, through a pattern of racketeering activity, in
violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d), as explained above. 108. The conspiracy
between Myers and Branthoover was formed on or about December 14,
2023, evidenced by the intensive communications (92 text messages)
exchanged between them immediately following Plaintiff's discovery of
Myers' extramarital affair. These communications—documented in Plaintiff’s
possession and available for production at the appropriate stage—
demonstrate the deliberate and coordinated formation of the conspiracy. 37
109. Each Defendant agreed that they would commit at least two acts of
racketeering activity in the conduct of the affairs of the Enterprise. The
agreement can be inferred from the Defendants' coordinated actions,
including: i. The systematic coordination of their activities through
interstate communications; ii. The division of responsibilities within the
Enterprise; iii. The implementation of operational security measures; iv. The
consistent pattern of actions furthering the fraudulent scheme; v. The
ongoing coordination over an eighteen-month period. 110. In furtherance of
the conspiracy, the Defendants committed numerous overt acts, including
but not limited to: i. Myers opening a private bank account to facilitate asset
concealment on December 14, 2023 and sharing these details with
Branthoover; ii. Myers and Branthoover exchanging 92 text messages on
December 14, 2023, to coordinate their criminal plans; iii. Branthoover
placing a deceptive phone call to Plaintiff on December 15, 2023; iv. Myers
executing an interstate wire transfer of $1,576 to Branthoover's PayPal
account on December 15, 2023; v. Myers traveling interstate to Oklahoma
on December 15, 2023, to coordinate with Branthoover; vi. Myers and
Branthoover preparing fraudulent court documents in 38 Oklahoma on
December 16-17, 2023 to be later submitted in Texas courts on December
18,22; vii. Myers transporting the fraudulent documents back to Texas on
December 17, 2023; viii. Branthoover sending threatening text messages to
Plaintiff on December 18, 2023; ix. Myers filing fraudulent documents with
Texas courts on December 18, 2023; x. Myers filing a fraudulent Application

=== PAGE 16 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
for Protective Order on December 22, 2023; xi. Branthoover continuing to
send threatening communications to Plaintiff through May 24, 2025. 111. As
a direct and proximate result of the Defendants' conspiracy in violation of 18
U.S.C. § 1962(d), Plaintiff has been injured in his business and property. The
injuries suffered by Plaintiff include but are not limited to: i. Loss of $1,576
fraudulently transferred from the joint marital account; ii. Business losses
resulting from the disruption of his home-based business operations; iii.
Additional financial damages resulting from the overdrawn account and
associated fees; iv. Loss of real and personal property rights through the
fraudulent 39 manipulation of judicial proceedings; v. Ongoing economic
harm resulting from the continued operation of the Enterprise. 112.
Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c), Plaintiff is entitled to recover from the
Defendants threefold the damages sustained, explained in more detail below.
XI. Damages 113. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the
allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 112 above, as if fully set forth
herein. 114. As a direct result of the racketeering activity alleged herein, the
Plaintiff has sustained substantial injury to his business operations, suffered
significant credit decrease, has lost business opportunities, had his personal
belongings destroyed, has had one vehicle repossessed, and has been
subject to transient and unstable housing. A. Damage to Business
Operations 115. In January of 2021, Plaintiff founded a digital financial
analytics business from his home, focused on delivering real-time stock
market data, automated technical indicators, and live market commentary to
retail traders and boutique investment groups across the United States and
Canada. His monetization model included tiered subscription plans, custom
data feed licensing, and API endpoints that offered real-time market data.
116. By 2022, client demand and revenue growth began outpacing Plaintiff’s
initial architecture. In response, Plaintiff made the strategic decision to
pause direct monetization in early 2023 to reinvest in infrastructure and
ensure the platform could handle commercial-scale traffic. This included: 40
i. Designing and deploying asynchronous financial signal algorithms, ii.
Mastering asynchronous programming, PostgreSQL and NoSQL systems for
storage and efficiency purposes, iii. Building websocket-based dashboards
for live data streaming, iv. Drafting licensing terms for premium indicator
access and reseller API use. v. Building partnerships and affiliations with
similar businesses in the market-data space. This period of reinvestment
came at significant cost: Plaintiff temporarily sacrificed a revenue stream
that had reached $12,000 per month at its peak in exchange for long-term
scalability. Plaintiff anticipated a short-term revenue dip, which he
strategically absorbed in reliance on his imminent reentry to market. 117.
By September of 2023, Plaintiff had completed core backend optimization
and UI integrations and obtained an affiliate marketing partnership with
polygon.io and was prepared to scale user acquisition and marketing. This
readiness marked a significant inflection point in Plaintiff’s commercial
trajectory. 118. Plaintiff reasonably projected a return to $9,000–$10,000/
month by mid-2024, with a 24-month growth model targeting $170,124.59 in
revenue through subscriptions and data services alone. This forecast was
based not on speculation, but on verified revenue history, platform
readiness, and documented user engagement trends. 119. As part of
Defendants’ coordinated scheme to deprive Plaintiff of his home and
operational capacity, Plaintiff was wrongfully and suddenly removed from
the family 41 residence in January 2024, despite Defendants’ full knowledge

=== PAGE 17 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
that he operated an active and income-generating business from that
location. This action caused a direct and immediate injury to Plaintiff’s
business, cutting off his ability to scale as planned. Instead of growing,
Plaintiff’s revenue collapsed. 120. The removal was executed without
warning or legal justification and had an immediate effect on Plaintiff’s
operations. Although the core data systems were technically portable, the
business depended on commercial-grade internet, low-latency upload
speeds, and a consistent, uninterrupted digital environment to support real-
time financial analytics, streaming, and API-based services. Following the
removal, Plaintiff was unable to find alternate housing with sufficient
bandwidth. Attempts to work from temporary family residences failed, as
Plaintiff’s usage either exceeded available internet capacity or interfered
with household connectivity, making it impossible to maintain stable service.
Without the ability to stream, deliver data products, or support his clients,
Plaintiff's revenue quickly declined and client engagement deteriorated.
121. Between September and December 2023, Plaintiff earned $10,529.72,
averaging $2,632.43 per month – his baseline earnings during the period of
restructuring. Based on past performance, technical stability, and confirmed
subscriber growth through marketing strategies, Plaintiff reasonably
projected returning to $5,000/month by mid-2024, with stable, scalable
performance continuing through 2025. 122. Under a conservative model,
had the business not been disrupted by Defendants’ interference, Plaintiff
would have earned: 42 i. Approximately $15,794.58 during the first half of
2024 (maintaining his pre-removal baseline), ii. Approximately $24,000.00
during the second half of 2024 (with moderate growth to $4,000/month), iii.
And approximately $60,000.00 across 2025 (at $5,000/month). This yields a
total projected income of $99,794.58 for the 18-month period following the
wrongful removal. 123. Accordingly, Plaintiff seeks recovery of $99,794.58 in
lost business income directly caused by Defendants’ pattern of racketeering
activity described above. B. Damages – Fraudulent Transfer and Cessation of
Business Advertisements 124. As noted above, Defendants coordinated in
emptying the joint marital PNC bank account, transferring $1,576.00 from
Plaintiff to a PayPal account controlled by Daniel Kenneth Branthoover,
which was subsequently routed to Morgan Michelle Myers. These funds
were used to purchase a second phone for Myers, enabling concealed
communication and coordination between Defendants in furtherance of their
scheme to defraud Plaintiff and obstruct his business operations.
Accordingly, Plaintiff therefore seeks recovery of the full amount of
$1,576.00. D. Damages – Total 126. As a direct result of the Defendants’
coordinated and fraudulent conduct detailed above, Plaintiff has sustained
total economic losses in the amount of one hundred and one thousand three
hundred seventy dollars and fifty-eight cents. ($101,370.58). This 43
includes: i. $99, 794.58 in lost business income caused by Defendant’s
actions leading to Plaintiff’s wrongful removal from his residence and the
destruction of his operational infrastructure over the last 18 months; ii.
$1,576.00 in marital funds fraudulently transferred from Plaintiff’s joint
bank account in furtherance of a scheme to defraud. 127. Pursuant to 18
U.S.C. § 1964(c), Plaintiff is entitled to treble damages for injuries sustained
to his business and property because of Defendants’ racketeering activity.
Accordingly, Plaintiff seeks an award of treble damages in the total
estimated amount of three hundred and four thousand, one hundred and
eleven dollars and seventy-four cents ($304,111.74) to be further clarified at

=== PAGE 18 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
trial. 128. All damages referenced herein are based on verifiable records
and financial documentation. Plaintiff will produce supporting evidence and
exhibits at the appropriate stage of these proceedings or at trial. XII.

Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
Daniel Branthoover's motion to dismiss is facially defective because he
purports to file on behalf of both himself and Morgan Myers despite not
being an attorney, and this unauthorized representation further supports the
plaintiff's enterprise claim by demonstrating continued coordination
between the defendants.
Summary
Daniel Branthoover's motion to dismiss suffers from several procedural
deficiencies that render it legally inadequate. Most significantly, by
purporting to file on behalf of both himself and Morgan Myers despite

=== PAGE 19 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
lacking legal credentials, he has engaged in the unauthorized practice of
law. This attempt to represent both defendants under a single filing not only
lacks Morgan Myers' signature but also directly contradicts his claim in the
motion that the defendants are unconnected parties.
Additionally, the motion contains numerous substantive misrepresentations
of the plaintiff's RICO claims, ignoring the detailed factual allegations in the
First Amended Complaint that establish predicate acts, pattern of
racketeering activity, and an enterprise structure. The fact that Branthoover
served the motion via email with Myers copied on the communication
provides further evidence supporting the plaintiff's allegation of an ongoing
enterprise relationship between the defendants, directly contradicting their
defense argument that no such connection exists.
Background and Legal Standards for Motion
to Dismiss
To properly evaluate the procedural and substantive defects in
Branthoover's motion to dismiss, it is important to understand the legal
standards that govern such motions under the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure.
A motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) tests the legal sufficiency of a
complaint. As articulated in Rodriguez v. Cnty. of Santa Cruz, 22-cv-07836-
JST (N.D. Cal. Jul 20, 2023), "Dismissal under [Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure] 12(b)(6) is appropriate only where the complaint lacks a
cognizable legal theory or sufficient facts to support a cognizable legal
theory." The court must "accept all factual allegations in the complaint as
true and construe the pleadings in the light most favorable to the nonmoving
party."
Furthermore, pro se complaints, such as the plaintiff's First Amended
Complaint in this case, must be "liberally construed and held to a less
stringent standard than formal pleadings drafted by attorneys." Erickson v.
Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94 (2007) (per curiam) (as cited in Rodriguez).
With these standards in mind, we can now address the specific defects in
Branthoover's motion to dismiss.
Procedural Defects in Branthoover's Motion
Unauthorized Practice of Law
The most glaring defect in Branthoover's motion is that he purports to file
on behalf of both himself and Morgan Myers despite not being licensed to
practice law. The caption of the motion states "DEFENDANT'S MOTION TO
DISMISS FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT" (singular possessive) and then
immediately identifies two defendants: "COMES NOW Defendant, Daniel
Kenneth Branthoover and Morgan Michelle Myers..."

=== PAGE 20 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
This attempt to represent both defendants in a single filing constitutes the
unauthorized practice of law. While Branthoover may represent himself pro
se, he cannot represent another party without being licensed to practice law.
This unauthorized representation is particularly significant given that the
First Amended Complaint specifically alleges in paragraph 31 that
Branthoover engaged in the "unauthorized practice of law across state
lines."
Lack of Signature from Myers
The motion lacks Morgan Myers' signature, which is required under Federal
Rule of Civil Procedure 11(a), which requires that every pleading be signed
by at least one attorney of record—or by a party personally if the party is
unrepresented. The only signature on the motion appears to be
Branthoover's, reinforcing the conclusion that he is improperly attempting
to represent Myers.
This defect is not merely technical. It raises questions about whether Myers
has even authorized or reviewed the motion. If she has not, then
Branthoover's filing on her behalf further supports the plaintiff's allegations
of a coordinated enterprise between the defendants.
Improper Service and Additional Evidence of Coordination
The plaintiff notes that the motion "doesn't appear on the docket yet, and he
served it to me via email, and CC'ed morgan." This is significant in two
respects:
It suggests improper service under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 5,
which governs service of papers after the initial complaint.
More importantly, it provides additional evidence supporting the
plaintiff's enterprise allegations. By copying Myers on the email,
Branthoover demonstrates continued coordination with her regarding
the litigation, directly contradicting the motion's argument that no
enterprise exists between the defendants.
This email communication is particularly telling given that it occurred after
the plaintiff filed the RICO complaint alleging an enterprise between
Branthoover and Myers. Rather than maintaining separate legal positions
and communications, the defendants continue to operate in the coordinated
manner alleged in the complaint.
Substantive Misrepresentations in the Motion
Beyond its procedural defects, Branthoover's motion substantially
misrepresents the plaintiff's allegations and ignores key aspects of the First
Amended Complaint.

=== PAGE 21 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Mischaracterization of the RICO Enterprise
In paragraph 2 of the motion, Branthoover claims that the complaint "lacks
the necessary elements of a RICO claim, including a valid enterprise."
However, the First Amended Complaint contains extensive allegations
establishing an association-in-fact enterprise.
Under 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4), an "'enterprise' includes any individual,
partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or
group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity." 18 U.S.C.
§ 1961 (2025). The complaint alleges specific facts demonstrating:
A common purpose between Branthoover and Myers (paragraphs
11-17)
An organizational structure with defined roles (paragraphs 91-92)
Longevity from December 2023 through May 2025 (paragraphs 49-52)
As explained in Allstate Ins. Co. v. Benhamou, 190 F.Supp.3d 631 (S.D. Tex.
2016), "a plaintiff must plead specific facts which establish that the
association exists for purposes other than simply to commit the predicate
acts." The complaint satisfies this requirement by alleging that the
enterprise had an organizational structure that existed beyond the predicate
acts themselves, including operational security measures and defined roles
(paragraphs 37-40, 91-93).
Failure to Address Pattern of Racketeering Activity
Branthoover's motion asserts in paragraph 8 that "Plaintiff fails to allege
continuity of racketeering activity" and claims that "the alleged conduct
spans a short period and does not demonstrate a threat of ongoing criminal
activity." This fundamentally misrepresents the complaint, which alleges
conduct spanning eighteen months from December 2023 through May 2025,
including specific instances of continuing activity as recent as May 24, 2025
(paragraph 52).
The complaint specifically alleges both closed-ended continuity (based on
the eighteen-month timeframe) and open-ended continuity (based on
ongoing threats and monitoring activities), as detailed in paragraphs 86-89.
This directly contradicts Branthoover's assertion.
Misrepresentation of Predicate Acts
The motion claims in paragraph 5 that the plaintiff's "allegations of wire
fraud... fail to meet the heightened pleading standard of Federal Rule of
Civil Procedure 9(b)" and "do not specify the time, place, or content of the
alleged fraudulent communications."
This assertion ignores the detailed allegations in the complaint, which
include:
Specific dates, times, and content of communications (e.g., paragraphs
22, 29-30, 50-52)
1. 
2. 
3. 
1. 

=== PAGE 22 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Particular bank account numbers and transfer details (paragraphs 25,
28)
Detailed descriptions of the fraudulent scheme (paragraphs 19-31)
The complaint provides far more detail than required under Rule 9(b),
specifying the "who, what, when, where, and how" of the alleged fraud with
precision.
False Characterization as Domestic Dispute
In paragraph 6, the motion claims that the plaintiff's allegations "arise
primarily from a domestic dispute and related family court proceedings" and
argues that such disputes "do not constitute the type of organized criminal
activity contemplated by RICO."
This misrepresents the nature of the plaintiff's claims. While the events may
have originated from a marital relationship, the complaint alleges a
sophisticated scheme involving interstate wire transfers, interstate travel for
fraudulent purposes, coordinated document preparation, and systematic
manipulation of court proceedings—extending well beyond an ordinary
domestic dispute.
The complaint carefully distinguishes between the domestic relationship and
the alleged enterprise activities in paragraph 16, stating: "This is not a story
about a marriage that failed. This is simply the product of a litigant who
values her extramarital relationships over morality, and who chose to
weaponize her family against Plaintiff for the sole purpose of escaping
accountability."
Misrepresentation of Standing and Damages
Paragraph 7 of the motion claims that the plaintiff "lacks standing to bring a
RICO claim because he has not alleged a concrete injury to business or
property" and dismisses the allegations as "emotional distress, reputational
harm, or speculative business losses."
This directly contradicts the complaint, which details specific economic
injuries:
Loss of $1,576 fraudulently transferred from a joint account
(paragraphs 25-28, 104)
Detailed business losses with specific dollar amounts (paragraphs
115-123)
Property losses through fraudulent court proceedings (paragraph 104)
The complaint provides extensive details about the plaintiff's business,
including revenue history, growth projections, and the specific impact of the
defendants' actions on business operations. These allegations go well
beyond "speculative" business losses and establish concrete injury to
business and property as required under RICO.

Analysis of RICO Elements in the Complaint
To fully understand why Branthoover's motion is frivolous, it is essential to
analyze how the First Amended Complaint satisfies the required elements of
a RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c).
Enterprise Element
The complaint establishes an association-in-fact enterprise between
Branthoover and Myers through detailed allegations about their coordinated
activities. As Allstate Ins. Co. v. Benhamou, 190 F.Supp.3d 631 (S.D. Tex.
2016) explains, "Regardless of whether an enterprise is alleged to be a legal
entity or an association-in-fact, the enterprise must be an entity separate
and apart from the pattern of activity in which it engages."
The complaint satisfies this requirement by detailing:
The formation of the enterprise on December 14, 2023 (paragraph 19)
The distinct roles of each defendant within the enterprise structure
(paragraph 91)
The maintenance of the enterprise through continuous communication,
financial support, and operational security measures (paragraph 92)
The enterprise's existence separate from the predicate acts themselves
(paragraph 93)
This level of detail goes well beyond what is required at the pleading stage
to establish an association-in-fact enterprise.
Pattern of Racketeering Activity
To establish a pattern of racketeering activity, a plaintiff must allege "at
least two acts of racketeering activity" that are both related and continuous. 
18 U.S.C. § 1961(5) (2025).
The complaint alleges multiple predicate acts, including:
Wire fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1343 (paragraphs 58-72)
Violations of the Travel Act under 18 U.S.C. § 1952 (paragraphs 73-78)
These alleged predicate acts are related because they "have the same or
similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of commission, or
otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not
isolated events" RICO: A Primer (2022). The complaint specifically details
how these acts are related through common purpose, same participants,
same victim, similar methods, and temporal connection (paragraph 85).
The continuity requirement is satisfied through allegations of both:
Closed-ended continuity: activities spanning eighteen months from
December 2023 through May 2025 (paragraph 86(i))
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
1. 
2. 
1. 

=== PAGE 24 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Open-ended continuity: ongoing threats and monitoring activities
continuing through May 2025, with potential for future criminal activity
(paragraph 86(ii))
Injury to Business or Property
RICO requires a plaintiff to allege injury to "business or property" as a result
of the RICO violation. The complaint contains detailed allegations of both:
Direct financial loss from the $1,576 wire transfer (paragraph 25)
Specific business losses with detailed revenue history and projections
(paragraphs 115-123)
Property losses through fraudulent court proceedings (paragraph 104)
These allegations go well beyond the "speculative" business losses
characterized in Branthoover's motion.
The Motion's Filing Further Supports the
RICO Claim
Perhaps most significantly, Branthoover's attempt to file on behalf of Myers
and his email copying her on communications related to the motion provides
additional evidence supporting the plaintiff's enterprise allegations. This
continued coordination directly contradicts the motion's claim that no
enterprise exists between the defendants.
As RICO: A Primer (2022) explains, racketeering acts need only be "related
in some way to the affairs of the charged enterprise." The manner in which
Branthoover served the motion—via email with Myers copied—demonstrates
ongoing communication and coordination between the defendants regarding
the lawsuit, which is precisely what the complaint alleges.
This continued coordination also supports the complaint's allegations of
open-ended continuity, as it shows that the defendants continue to act in
concert even after being sued for racketeering.
Conclusion
Daniel Branthoover's motion to dismiss is both procedurally defective and
substantively frivolous. Procedurally, it represents an unauthorized attempt
to practice law by filing on behalf of Morgan Myers without her signature.
Substantively, it misrepresents the detailed allegations in the First Amended
Complaint and ignores the specific facts establishing each element of the
RICO claims.
The motion's most significant flaw may be that the manner of its filing—with
Branthoover copying Myers on the email—actually provides additional
evidence supporting the plaintiff's allegations of an ongoing enterprise
between the defendants. Rather than undermining the RICO claims, the
motion and its service method further substantiate them.

The court should reject this motion and allow the plaintiff's well-pleaded
RICO claims to proceed to discovery, where the evidence of the alleged
enterprise and pattern of racketeering activity can be fully developed. Given
the pro se status of the plaintiff, the court should construe the complaint
liberally, as required by Rodriguez v. Cnty. of Santa Cruz, 22-cv-07836-JST
(N.D. Cal. Jul 20, 2023), and recognize the substantive adequacy of the
detailed factual allegations presented.
Legal Authorities
Allstate Ins. Co. v. Benhamou, 190 F.Supp.3d 631 (S.D. Tex. 2016)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of Texas
Extract
A violation of § 1962(c) requires (1) conduct or participation (2) of an
enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity. Sedima, 473
U.S. at 496, 105 S.Ct. 3275. A plaintiff must allege each of these elements in
order to state a claim. Id. The Court will address Defendants' arguments as
they relate to each of these elements. ... Regardless of whether an
enterprise is alleged to be a legal entity or an association-in-fact, the
enterprise must be an entity separate and apart from the pattern of activity
in which it engages. Old Time Enters., Inc. v. Int'l Coffee Corp., 862 F.2d
1213, 1217 (5th Cir.1989). Thus, a plaintiff must plead specific facts which
establish that the association exists for purposes other than simply to
commit the predicate acts. Foufas, 867 F.2d at 881. Although proof of one
does not necessarily establish the other, 'evidence used to prove the pattern
of racketeering activity and the evidence establishing an enterprise ‘may in
particular cases coalesce.’
Summary
For a RICO claim under § 1962(c), a plaintiff must allege conduct or
participation in an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. The
enterprise must be distinct from the pattern of activity, meaning it should
exist for purposes beyond just committing the predicate acts. This
distinction is crucial for establishing a valid RICO claim.

Plaintiff alleges that various Defendants conducted the management and
operation of the affairs of an enterprise, directly or indirectly, through a
pattern of racketeering activity within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961(1)
(B), 1961(5), and 1962(c) and (d), in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) and (d),

consisting of continuous and multiple instances of mail and wire fraud in
violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1341 and 1343. (Am.Compl.¶¶ 16, 64, 80, 90.)
Summary
Requirements for establishing a RICO claim, specifically the need to
demonstrate a pattern of racketeering activity through predicate acts such
as mail and wire fraud. It emphasizes that the scheme itself must be
fraudulent, not necessarily each individual communication. This is relevant
to the question as it highlights the importance of demonstrating a
coordinated scheme involving multiple parties, which is central to the
Plaintiff's allegations against Branthoover and Myers.

Summary
The passage provides definitions that are crucial for understanding what
constitutes a RICO violation. It defines "racketeering activity" as including
acts indictable under certain provisions of the U.S. Code, such as wire fraud
and violations of the Travel Act, which are relevant to the case at hand. It
also defines "enterprise" and "pattern of racketeering activity," which are
necessary elements to establish a RICO claim. This information is essential
for evaluating the validity of the RICO claims in the complaint and assessing
the motion to dismiss.
RICO: A Primer
Extract
The racketeering acts need not be similar or directly related to each other;
rather, it is sufficient that the racketeering acts are related in some way to
the affairs of the charged enterprise, including, for example, that: the
racketeering acts furthered the goals of or benefitted the enterprise, the
enterprise or the defendant's role in the enterprise enabled the defendant to
commit, or facilitated the commission of, the racketeering acts, the
racketeering acts were committed at the behest of, or on behalf of, the
enterprise, or the racketeering acts had the same or similar purposes,
results, participants, victims or methods of commission.
Summary
For acts to be considered part of a RICO enterprise, they do not need to be
similar or directly related but must be connected to the enterprise's affairs.
This connection can be through the acts furthering the enterprise's goals,
benefiting the enterprise, or being committed on behalf of the enterprise.
