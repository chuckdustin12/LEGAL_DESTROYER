Question
The complaint alleges that Defendants knowingly agreed to participate in
the racketeering enterprise and took overt actions in furtherance of the
conspiracy, such as filing false legal documents and coordinating eviction
proceedings. Under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d), a RICO conspiracy claim requires
proof that the defendants knowingly agreed to participate in the conduct of
an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. The detailed
allegations of coordinated actions and shared objectives among the
Defendants support the claim of a RICO conspiracy under § 1962(d).
Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
RICO conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d) requires proof that defendants
knowingly agreed to participate in the conduct of an enterprise through a
pattern of racketeering activity, without requiring proof of overt acts or
personal commission of predicate acts. The complaint's allegations of
coordinated actions (filing false legal documents and coordinating eviction
proceedings) and shared objectives among the Defendants sufficiently
support a RICO conspiracy claim under § 1962(d).
Summary
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) makes it
unlawful under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d) to conspire to violate the substantive
provisions of RICO, which include conducting an enterprise's affairs through
a pattern of racketeering activity. For a RICO conspiracy claim to succeed,
the prosecution must demonstrate that the defendants knowingly agreed to
participate in a racketeering enterprise and its pattern of racketeering
activity, although importantly, the defendants need not personally commit or
agree to commit the predicate acts themselves.
The complaint's detailed allegations that the Defendants knowingly agreed
to participate in the racketeering enterprise and took overt actions in
furtherance of the conspiracy, such as filing false legal documents and
coordinating eviction proceedings, are sufficient to support a RICO
conspiracy claim. This is because RICO conspiracy focuses on the agreement
to participate in the enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering
activity, not on the commission of specific predicate acts. The coordinated
actions and shared objectives alleged in the complaint demonstrate the
existence of an agreement among the Defendants to participate in the
enterprise's affairs, which is the essence of a RICO conspiracy under §
1962(d).

Background and Relevant Law
Legislation
RICO was enacted as a flexible tool to combat organized crime, with section
1962(d) specifically targeting conspiracies to violate RICO's substantive
provisions. According to 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d) as amended in 2025, "It shall be
unlawful for any person to conspire to violate any of the provisions of
subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section." 18 U.S.C. § 1962 Prohibited
Activities, 18 U.S.C. § 1962. This language establishes the basis for RICO
conspiracy claims, making it illegal to agree to participate in prohibited
RICO activities.
Key Case Law on RICO Conspiracy Requirements
The Agreement Element
The central element of a RICO conspiracy is the agreement to participate in
the affairs of a racketeering enterprise. As clarified in United States v.
Denava, U.S. District Court — Northern District of Illinois (2023): "A RICO
conspiracy has three elements: (1) an agreement to conduct or participate in
the affairs (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern of racketeering activity."
This clearly establishes that the core of a RICO conspiracy claim is the
agreement itself.
The Second Circuit further elaborated in United States v. Delgado, 972 F.3d
63 (2nd Cir. 2020) that "[t]he conspiracy provision of RICO, 18 U.S.C. §
1962(d), 'proscribes an agreement to conduct or to participate in the
conduct of an enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.'"
The court emphasized that "the crime of RICO conspiracy 'centers on the act
of agreement.'" This focus on the agreement rather than specific acts is
crucial to understanding RICO conspiracy claims.
The First Circuit similarly explained in United States v. Rodríguez-Torres,
939 F.3d 16 (1st Cir. 2019) that "a RICO-conspiracy conviction requires
proof that the defendant knowingly joined the conspiracy, agreeing with one
or more coconspirators 'to further [the] endeavor which, if completed, would
satisfy all the elements of a substantive [RICO] offense.'" The court further
noted that "Each RICO-conspiracy defendant must have knowingly joined
the conspiracy" and "[a]ll that is necessary to prove this RICO-conspiracy
element is to show 'that the defendant agreed with one or more
coconspirators to participate in the conspiracy.'"
No Requirement for Personal Commission of Predicate Acts
A critical aspect of RICO conspiracy is that defendants need not personally
commit or agree to commit the predicate acts. The Supreme Court
established in Salinas v. U.S., 522 U.S. 52, 118 S.Ct. 469, 139 L.Ed.2d 352
(1997) that "[t]o be convicted of conspiracy to violate RICO under §1962(d),
the conspirator need not himself have committed or agreed to commit the

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
two or more predicate acts, such as bribery, requisite for a substantive RICO
offense under §1962(c)." The Court further noted that Section 1962(d) "is
even more comprehensive than the general conspiracy provision applicable
to federal crimes, §371, since it contains no requirement of an overt or
specific act to effect the conspiracy's object."
This principle has been consistently applied across circuits. In United States
v. Capers, 20 F.4th 105 (2nd Cir. 2021), the Second Circuit explained that "a
RICO conspiracy offense under § 1962(d) requires only that a defendant
'conspire' – in other words, agree – to violate one of RICO's substantive
prohibitions." The court emphasized that "'the agreement proscribed by
section 1962(d) is a conspiracy to participate in a charged enterprise's
affairs through a pattern of racketeering, not a conspiracy to commit
predicate acts.'"
The Seventh Circuit has similarly held in Empress Casino Joliet Corp. v.
Balmoral Racing Club, Inc., 831 F.3d 815 (7th Cir. 2016) that "A RICO
conspirator need not agree to commit personally two predicate acts in
furtherance of the enterprise; rather, he must agree that someone will
commit them."
Enterprise Requirement
For a RICO conspiracy claim to succeed, there must be an agreement to
participate in an "enterprise," which is broadly defined under the statute. In 
Boyle v. United States, 129 S.Ct. 2237, 173 L.Ed.2d 1265, 556 U.S. 938, 77
USLW 4474 (2009), the Supreme Court explained that an enterprise under
RICO requires "an ongoing organization with some sort of framework,
formal or informal, for carrying out its objectives" and that "the various
members and associates of the association function[ed] as a continuing unit
to achieve a common purpose."
The Supreme Court had previously established in United States v. Turkette,
452 U.S. 576, 101 S.Ct. 2524, 69 L.Ed.2d 246 (1981) that "[t]he enterprise is
an entity, for present purposes a group of persons associated together for a
common purpose of engaging in a course of conduct." It should be noted
that Turkette was abrogated by United States v. Lane Lane v. United States,
474 U.S. 438, 106 S.Ct. 725, 88 L.Ed.2d 814 (1986), but this abrogation
pertained to issues related to misjoinder of defendants, not to the definition
of an enterprise under RICO, which remains valid law.
In U.S. v. Zielie, 734 F.2d 1447 (11th Cir. 1984), the Eleventh Circuit,
quoting Turkette, noted that an enterprise "is proved by evidence of an
ongoing organization, formal or informal, and by evidence that the various
associates function as a continuing unit." Though Zielie was stated as
abrogated by U.S. v. Salom, No. 08-10322 (11th Cir. Oct 15, 2009), this
abrogation did not affect the definition of a RICO enterprise, which remains
consistent with Turkette's interpretation.

Pattern of Racketeering Activity
A RICO conspiracy also requires evidence of a "pattern of racketeering
activity" or an agreement that such a pattern would exist. In United States v.
Gurry, Criminal Action No. 16-cr-10343-ADB (D. Mass. Jan 17, 2019), the
court explained that a RICO conspiracy claim requires "an allegation that
the defendant agreed that a co-conspirator would commit at least two acts
of racketeering activity."
The D.C. Circuit clarified in United States v. Eiland, 738 F.3d 338 (D.C. Cir.
2014) that "proof of a pattern of racketeering activity may be sufficient in a
particular case to permit a jury to infer the existence of an association-in-
fact enterprise."
Secondary Materials on RICO Conspiracy
Secondary materials further illustrate the requirements for establishing a
RICO conspiracy. According to RICO: A Primer (2022), to prove a violation of
Section 1962(d), a plaintiff must prove: "The existence of an enterprise (or
that an enterprise would exist); That the enterprise was (or would be)
engaged in, or its activities affected (or would affect), interstate or foreign
commerce; and That each defendant knowingly agreed that a conspirator
would commit a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c)."
This source also reiterates the Supreme Court's holding that "to establish a
RICO conspiracy offense under Section 1962(d), there is no requirement
that the defendant 'himself committed or agreed to commit the two
predicate acts requisite for a substantive RICO offense under § 1962(c).'" It
further explains: "A conspiracy may exist even if a conspirator does not
agree to commit or facilitate each and every part of the substantive offense.
The partners in the criminal plan must agree to pursue the same criminal
objective and may divide up the work, yet each is responsible for the acts of
each other."
The article The crime of associating with criminals? An argument for
extending the Reves "operation or management" test to RICO conspiracy
(2006) notes that "Unlike the general federal conspiracy statute, it is also
well accepted that RICO conspiracy does not require proof of any overt act.
Beyond this, a defendant must merely agree to the illegitimate objectives
that constitute the crime."
Similarly, Racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations (1997) explains
that "A RICO conspiracy differs from an ordinary conspiracy in two respects:
it need not embrace an overt act, and it is broader and may encompass a
greater variety of conduct."

Analysis of the Complaint's Allegations
Sufficient Allegations of an Agreement
The complaint's allegations that the Defendants "knowingly agreed to
participate in the racketeering enterprise" directly address the central
element of a RICO conspiracy under § 1962(d). As established in United
States v. Denava, U.S. District Court — Northern District of Illinois (2023)
and numerous other cases, the essence of a RICO conspiracy is the
agreement to participate in the affairs of an enterprise through a pattern of
racketeering activity.
The detailed allegations of "coordinated actions and shared objectives
among the Defendants" further support the existence of an agreement. As
explained in United States v. Rodríguez-Torres, 939 F.3d 16 (1st Cir. 2019),
all that is necessary to prove the agreement element is to show "that the
defendant agreed with one or more coconspirators to participate in the
conspiracy." The coordinated actions alleged in the complaint, including
"filing false legal documents and coordinating eviction proceedings," provide
evidence of such an agreement.
Evidence of a Racketeering Enterprise
The complaint's allegations also support the existence of a racketeering
enterprise, which is a required element of a RICO conspiracy. The Supreme
Court in Boyle v. United States, 129 S.Ct. 2237, 173 L.Ed.2d 1265, 556 U.S.
938, 77 USLW 4474 (2009) explained that an enterprise requires "an
ongoing organization with some sort of framework, formal or informal, for
carrying out its objectives" and that "the various members and associates of
the association function[ed] as a continuing unit to achieve a common
purpose."
The complaint's allegations of "coordinated actions and shared objectives"
suggest the existence of an ongoing organization with a framework for
carrying out objectives. The specific allegations of "filing false legal
documents and coordinating eviction proceedings" indicate that the
Defendants were functioning as a continuing unit to achieve common
purposes, which meets the definition of an enterprise under RICO.
Pattern of Racketeering Activity
The allegations that Defendants took "overt actions in furtherance of the
conspiracy, such as filing false legal documents and coordinating eviction
proceedings" suggest a pattern of racketeering activity. As explained in 
United States v. Gurry, Criminal Action No. 16-cr-10343-ADB (D. Mass. Jan
17, 2019), a RICO conspiracy claim requires "an allegation that the
defendant agreed that a co-conspirator would commit at least two acts of
racketeering activity."
Filing false legal documents could constitute predicate acts under RICO,
such as mail fraud, wire fraud, or obstruction of justice, depending on the

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
specific circumstances. Coordinating eviction proceedings based on false
documentation could similarly constitute predicate acts. These allegations
suggest an agreed-upon pattern of racketeering activity, which is sufficient
for a RICO conspiracy claim.
No Requirement for Overt Acts
Although the complaint alleges that Defendants took "overt actions in
furtherance of the conspiracy," it's important to note that RICO conspiracy
does not require proof of overt acts. As established by the Supreme Court in 
Salinas v. U.S., 522 U.S. 52, 118 S.Ct. 469, 139 L.Ed.2d 352 (1997), Section
1962(d) "contains no requirement of an overt or specific act to effect the
conspiracy's object."
This is reiterated in secondary materials such as The crime of associating
with criminals? An argument for extending the Reves "operation or
management" test to RICO conspiracy (2006), which states that "Unlike the
general federal conspiracy statute, it is also well accepted that RICO
conspiracy does not require proof of any overt act." Thus, even if the alleged
overt actions could not be proven, a RICO conspiracy claim could still
succeed based solely on proof of an agreement to participate in the
enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity.
No Requirement for Personal Commission of Predicate
Acts
The complaint's allegations do not need to show that each defendant
personally committed predicate acts. As established in United States v.
Capers, 20 F.4th 105 (2nd Cir. 2021), "'the agreement proscribed by section
1962(d) is a conspiracy to participate in a charged enterprise's affairs
through a pattern of racketeering, not a conspiracy to commit predicate
acts.'" Similarly, Empress Casino Joliet Corp. v. Balmoral Racing Club, Inc.,
831 F.3d 815 (7th Cir. 2016) held that "A RICO conspirator need not agree to
commit personally two predicate acts in furtherance of the enterprise;
rather, he must agree that someone will commit them."
Therefore, if the complaint alleges that Defendants agreed that someone in
the enterprise would commit the predicate acts, this is sufficient for a RICO
conspiracy claim, even if not all defendants personally participated in filing
false documents or coordinating eviction proceedings.
Knowledge Requirement
The complaint's allegation that Defendants "knowingly agreed" to
participate in the racketeering enterprise addresses the knowledge
requirement for RICO conspiracy. As explained in United States v. Chester,
No. 13 CR 00774 (N.D. Ill. Aug 08, 2017), the government must show "an
agreement to conduct or participate in the affairs of an enterprise through a
pattern of racketeering activity."

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
The allegation of "knowingly agreed" indicates that Defendants had
knowledge of the enterprise and its general criminal objectives, which is
sufficient under RICO conspiracy law. As noted in Racketeer influenced and
corrupt organizations (1997), when proving an agreement, use of
"circumstantial evidence to show that each defendant must necessarily have
known that the others were also conspiring to participate in the same
enterprise through a pattern of racketeering" is allowed.
Application to Filing False Legal Documents
and Coordinating Eviction Proceedings
The specific allegations of "filing false legal documents and coordinating
eviction proceedings" provide concrete examples of the coordinated actions
that support the RICO conspiracy claim. These actions suggest a pattern of
racketeering activity if they involve predicate acts such as mail fraud, wire
fraud, or obstruction of justice.
The "coordination" alleged in the complaint suggests an agreement among
the Defendants to participate in the enterprise's affairs. As explained in U.S.
v. Hewes, 729 F.2d 1302 (11th Cir. 1984), in a RICO conspiracy, "[t]he
diverse parties were tied together through the overall scheme and the
concept of the illegal enterprise." The allegation that Defendants
coordinated eviction proceedings suggests they were tied together through
an overall scheme, which supports a RICO conspiracy claim.
Moreover, the filing of false legal documents suggests that the enterprise
operated through fraudulent means, which could constitute predicate acts
under RICO. As noted in United States v. Larson, 07-CR-304S (W.D. N.Y. Dec
05, 2011), a RICO conspiracy indictment must allege that defendants
"agreed that a conspirator employed by or associated with the [Enterprise]
would commit at least two acts of racketeering activity in the conduct of the
affairs of the [Enterprise]." The allegation of filing false legal documents
suggests such an agreement.
Exceptions and Caveats
Proving the Enterprise
While the complaint's allegations of coordinated actions and shared
objectives support the existence of an enterprise, proving the enterprise's
existence may require additional evidence. As explained in United States v.
Fisher, Case No. 15-20652 (E.D. Mich. Aug 27, 2018), an association-in-fact
enterprise must have "a purpose, relationships among those associated with
the racketeering enterprise, and longevity sufficient to permit these
associates to pursue the racketeering enterprise's purpose."
The complaint would need to provide sufficient details to show these
structural features of the alleged enterprise. Mere allegations of
coordination might not be enough without evidence of an ongoing
organization with some sort of framework for carrying out objectives.

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Proving the Pattern of Racketeering Activity
While filing false legal documents and coordinating eviction proceedings
could constitute predicate acts under RICO, the specific allegations would
need to show that these actions qualify as "racketeering activity" as defined
in the statute. Not all fraudulent activities qualify as predicate acts under
RICO, and the complaint would need to show that the alleged actions fall
within the statutory definition.
Furthermore, as noted in Portionpac Chemical Corp. v. Sanitech Systems,
217 F.Supp.2d 1238 (M.D. Fla. 2002), to establish a pattern of racketeering
activity, the defendants must have participated in "at least two acts of
racketeering activity, one of which occurred after the effective date of
[RICO] and the last of which occurred within ten years (excluding any term
of imprisonment) after the commission of a prior act of racketeering
activity." The complaint would need to allege specific acts that meet this
temporal requirement.
Withdrawal from the Conspiracy
Defendants may assert withdrawal from the conspiracy as a defense. As
noted in Racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations (2011), "A
defendant can assert withdrawal from the conspiracy as a defense to an
action brought under [section] 1962(d) through proof that he took
affirmative steps, inconsistent with the objectives of the conspiracy, to
disavow or to defeat the conspiratorial objectives."
If any of the Defendants can prove that they took affirmative steps to
withdraw from the conspiracy before the relevant statute of limitations
period, they may have a valid defense to the RICO conspiracy claim.
Conclusion
The complaint's allegations that Defendants "knowingly agreed to
participate in the racketeering enterprise and took overt actions in
furtherance of the conspiracy, such as filing false legal documents and
coordinating eviction proceedings" are legally sufficient to support a RICO
conspiracy claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d).
RICO conspiracy requires proof that defendants knowingly agreed to
participate in the conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering
activity. Unlike ordinary conspiracy, RICO conspiracy does not require proof
of overt acts, and defendants need not personally commit or agree to
commit the predicate acts themselves. The focus is on the agreement to
participate in the enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering
activity.
The complaint's allegations of "coordinated actions and shared objectives"
among the Defendants support the existence of an agreement to participate
in a racketeering enterprise. The specific allegations of "filing false legal

=== PAGE 9 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
documents and coordinating eviction proceedings" suggest a pattern of
racketeering activity and provide evidence of the enterprise's operations.
While the complaint's allegations appear legally sufficient to state a RICO
conspiracy claim, proving such a claim would require evidence of the
enterprise's existence, the defendants' knowledge and agreement to
participate in the enterprise, and a pattern of racketeering activity. The
specific allegations of filing false legal documents and coordinating eviction
proceedings would need to be tied to predicate acts under RICO, and the
enterprise would need to be shown to have the structural features required
under the law.
Overall, the detailed allegations of coordinated actions and shared
objectives among the Defendants, including the specific actions of filing
false legal documents and coordinating eviction proceedings, provide a
strong foundation for a RICO conspiracy claim under § 1962(d).
Legal Authorities
U.S. v. Benevento, 836 F.2d 60 (2nd Cir. 1987)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Second Circuit
Extract
To establish the existence of a RICO conspiracy, the government was
required to prove only the existence of an agreement to violate RICO's
substantive provisions. Thus, the government necessarily had to establish
that Loiacono agreed with his criminal associates to form the RICO
enterprise, the J.E.M. Corporation, agreed to associate himself with that
enterprise and agreed to commit two predicate acts in furtherance of a
pattern of racketeering activity in connection with the enterprise.
Summary
To establish a RICO conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d), it is necessary to
prove an agreement to violate RICO's substantive provisions. This includes
demonstrating that the defendants agreed to form and associate with a
RICO enterprise and agreed to commit predicate acts in furtherance of a
pattern of racketeering activity. This aligns with the proposition that the
complaint alleges Defendants knowingly agreed to participate in the
racketeering enterprise and took overt actions in furtherance of the
conspiracy.

Extract
The conspiracy provision of RICO, 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d), 'proscribes an
agreement to conduct or to participate in the conduct of an enterprise's
affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.' United States v. Arrington,
941 F.3d 24, 36 (2d Cir. 2019). Importantly, the crime of RICO conspiracy
'centers on the act of agreement.' United States v. Applins, 637 F.3d 59, 81
(2d Cir. 2011) (emphasis in original). Thus, in contrast to RICO's substantive
offenses, see, e.g., 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), 'the Government need not establish
the existence of an enterprise' to 'prove a RICO conspiracy,' Arrington, 941
F.3d at 36. Nor must it establish that a pattern of racketeering activity
actually took place. See United States v. Zemlyansky, 908 F.3d 1, 11 (2d Cir.
2018) ('To prove the pattern element, the government must show that two or
more predicate acts were, or were intended to be, committed as part of the
conspiracy.').
Summary
The government does not need to prove the actual existence of an enterprise
or that a pattern of racketeering activity took place, only that there was an
agreement and intent to commit predicate acts as part of the conspiracy.
This supports the proposition that detailed allegations of coordinated actions
and shared objectives among defendants can substantiate a RICO
conspiracy claim.
Empress Casino Joliet Corp. v. Balmoral Racing Club, Inc., 831 F.3d 815 (7th

U.S. Court of Appeals — Seventh Circuit
Extract
A RICO conspiracy requires proof 'that (1) the defendant[s] agreed to
maintain an interest in or control of an enterprise or to participate in the
affairs of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity, and (2) the
defendant[s] further agreed that someone would commit at least two
predicate acts to accomplish these goals.' Empress Casino III, 763 F.3d at
734–35 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted; alteration in
original). Courts have further fleshed out those requirements. A RICO
conspirator need not agree to commit personally two predicate acts in
furtherance of the enterprise; rather, he must agree that someone will
commit them. Salinas, 522 U.S. at 65, 118 S.Ct. 469.
Summary
Defendants do not need to personally commit the predicate acts but must
agree that someone will commit them. This supports the proposition that the
complaint's allegations of coordinated actions and shared objectives among
the Defendants can substantiate a RICO conspiracy claim.

US v. Gallo, 668 F. Supp. 736 (E.D. N.Y. 1987)
U.S. District Court — Eastern District of New York
Extract
With the enactment of RICO, Congress supplemented traditional 'chain' and
'wheel' theories with a new conspiratorial concept—the enterprise... The
RICO conspiracy consists of an agreement to violate the 'substantive' RICO
law, that is, a conspiracy 'to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in
the conduct of the enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering
activity or collection of unlawful debt,' 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), rather than of a
conspiracy to perform any particular predicate crime... Under the RICO
conspiracy law, the prosecution has the burden of proving that the pattern of
racketeering activity was sufficiently related to the enterprise so as to
evidence an agreement to participate in the enterprise activities, that is, the
'connection' between the enterprise and the predicate acts.
Summary
The passage explains the concept of a RICO conspiracy, emphasizing that it
involves an agreement to participate in the conduct of an enterprise's affairs
through a pattern of racketeering activity. It highlights the requirement for
the prosecution to prove a connection between the enterprise and the
predicate acts, which aligns with the proposition that defendants must
knowingly agree to participate in the enterprise's conduct. This supports the
proposition by illustrating the legal framework and requirements for
establishing a RICO conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d).
United States v. Capers, 20 F.4th 105 (2nd Cir. 2021)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Second Circuit
Extract
In contrast to a substantive violation of RICO under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c),
which requires proof of the commission of specifically listed state or federal
crimes (some of which are categorically violent crimes) as part of a 'pattern
of racketeering' in the course of conducting the affairs of an enterprise, a
RICO conspiracy offense under § 1962(d) requires only that a defendant
'conspire' – in other words, agree – to violate one of RICO's substantive
prohibitions. ... In other words, 'the agreement proscribed by section
1962(d) is a conspiracy to participate in a charged enterprise's affairs
through a pattern of racketeering, not a conspiracy to commit predicate
acts.' United States v. Pizzonia, 577 F.3d 455, 463 (2d Cir. 2009) (internal
quotation marks and alterations omitted).

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
The passage clarifies the distinction between a substantive RICO violation
under § 1962(c) and a RICO conspiracy under § 1962(d). It emphasizes that
for a RICO conspiracy, it is sufficient to show that the defendants agreed to
participate in the conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering
activity, rather than committing specific predicate acts. This supports the
proposition that the complaint's allegations of coordinated actions and
shared objectives among the Defendants can substantiate a RICO conspiracy
claim under § 1962(d).
United States v. Rodr&iacute;guez-Torres, 939 F.3d 16 (1st Cir. 2019)
U.S. Court of Appeals — First Circuit
Extract
RICO makes it a crime 'for any person employed by or associated with any
enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign
commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of
[an] enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity' — or to
conspire to do so. See 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), (d). Broadly speaking (we will
have more to say on this below), a RICO-conspiracy conviction requires
proof that the defendant knowingly joined the conspiracy, agreeing with one
or more coconspirators 'to further [the] endeavor which, if completed, would
satisfy all the elements of a substantive [RICO] offense.' ... Each RICO-
conspiracy defendant must have knowingly joined the conspiracy. See, e.g.,
Aetna Cas. Sur. Co., 43 F.3d at 1562. And '[a]ll that is necessary to prove'
this RICO-conspiracy element is to show 'that the defendant agreed with one
or more coconspirators to participate in the conspiracy.' See Ramírez-Rivera,
800 F.3d at 18 n.11 (quotation marks omitted).
Summary
A RICO conspiracy claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d) requires proof that the
defendant knowingly agreed to participate in the conduct of an enterprise
through a pattern of racketeering activity. The passage emphasizes that the
key element is the knowing agreement to join the conspiracy, which aligns
with the proposition that the defendants knowingly agreed to participate in
the racketeering enterprise. The passage also references the necessity of
showing an agreement with one or more coconspirators, which supports the
proposition's claim of coordinated actions and shared objectives among the
defendants.

Extract
The allegation in the RICO conspiracy count was that the defendant[s]
agreed to further a racketeering enterprise through a pattern of
racketeering activity. The diverse parties were tied together through the
overall scheme and the concept of the illegal enterprise. The overt acts and
substantive predicate crimes that were alleged in the indictment to have
furthered the pattern of racketeering were sufficiently connected that their
interrelationship constituted an offense of a series of acts or transactions.
Summary
The passage from "U.S. v. Hewes" discusses the legal requirements for a
RICO conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d), emphasizing that the defendants
must have agreed to further a racketeering enterprise through a pattern of
racketeering activity. It highlights that the diverse parties involved in the
conspiracy were connected through an overall scheme and illegal
enterprise, and that the overt acts and predicate crimes were sufficiently
interrelated to constitute a series of acts or transactions. This directly
supports the proposition that the complaint's allegations of coordinated
actions and shared objectives among the Defendants can support a RICO
conspiracy claim.
U.S. v Tocco, 135 F.3d 116 (2000)
U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
Proof of a charge under § 1962(d) requires proof that the association or
enterprise existed and that the named defendants were associated with and
agreed to participate in the conduct of its affairs, which affect interstate
commerce, through a pattern of racketeering activity... The RICO statute
defines an enterprise as 'includ[ing] any individual, partnership, corporation,
association or other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals
associated in fact although not a legal entity.' 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4).
Summary
Elements required to prove a RICO conspiracy under § 1962(d), which
include the existence of an enterprise and the defendants' agreement to
participate in its conduct through a pattern of racketeering activity. This
directly supports the proposition that the complaint's allegations of
coordinated actions and shared objectives among the Defendants can
substantiate a RICO conspiracy claim. The definition of an enterprise under
the RICO statute further supports the notion that a group of individuals
associated in fact, even if not a legal entity, can constitute an enterprise for
the purposes of a RICO claim.

Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., Inc., 741 F.2d 482 (2nd Cir. 1984)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Second Circuit
Extract
The third count charges a RICO conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1962(c) and
(d). ... Section 1962 'violations' include conducting 'enterprises' 'through a
pattern of racketeering'; a 'pattern of racketeering' is defined by section
1961(5) as two or more 'acts of racketeering' occurring within a given
time. ... 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1962(d) provides: (d) It shall be unlawful for any
person to conspire to violate any of the provisions of subsections (a), (b), or
(c) of this section.
Summary
Legal basis for understanding how coordinated actions and shared
objectives among defendants can support a RICO conspiracy claim.
United States v. Chester, No. 13 CR 00774 (N.D. Ill. Aug 08, 2017)
U.S. District Court — Northern District of Illinois
Extract
To prove a RICO conspiracy, the government must show (1) an agreement to
conduct or participate in the affairs (2) of an enterprise (3) through a
pattern of racketeering activity. United States v. Olson, 450 F.3d 655, 664
(7th Cir. 2006). ... 'To prove primary liability for a RICO conspiracy under
section 1962(d), the government must prove only that a particular defendant
agreed that a member of the conspiracy would commit two predicate
racketeering acts, not that the particular defendant committed or agreed to
commit two predicate acts himself.' United States v. Benabe, 654 F.3d 753,
776 (7th Cir. 2011) (emphasis in original).
Summary
The government does not need to prove that each defendant personally
committed or agreed to commit specific predicate acts, only that they
agreed that a member of the conspiracy would commit such acts. This aligns
with the proposition that the defendants knowingly agreed to participate in
the racketeering enterprise and took overt actions in furtherance of the
conspiracy.
U.S. v. Pizzonia, 577 F.3d 455 (2nd Cir. 2009)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Second Circuit

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
RICO, specifically 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), makes it a substantive crime 'for any
person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the
activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or
participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs
through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt.'
Section 1962(d), in turn, makes it 'unlawful for any person to conspire to
violate' the substantive provisions of RICO. When read in conjunction with
the language of § 1962(c), RICO's conspiracy provision thus proscribes an
agreement to conduct or to participate in the conduct of the enterprise's
affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.
Summary
The passage explains that under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d), it is unlawful to
conspire to violate the substantive provisions of RICO, which includes
participating in the conduct of an enterprise's affairs through a pattern of
racketeering activity. This directly supports the proposition that a RICO
conspiracy claim requires proof of an agreement to participate in the
conduct of an enterprise through racketeering activities. The passage also
clarifies that the conspiracy is not merely an agreement to commit predicate
acts but to conduct the enterprise's affairs through such acts, aligning with
the proposition's emphasis on coordinated actions and shared objectives.
United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 101 S.Ct. 2524, 69 L.Ed.2d 246
(1981)
U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
In order to secure a conviction under RICO, the Government must prove
both the existence of an 'enterprise' and the connected 'pattern of
racketeering activity.' The enterprise is an entity, for present purposes a
group of persons associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a
course of conduct. The pattern of racketeering activity is, on the other hand,
a series of criminal acts as defined by the statute. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1) (1976
ed., Supp. III). The former is proved by evidence of an ongoing organization,
formal or informal, and by evidence that the various associates function as a
continuing unit.
Summary
The U.S. Supreme Court in "United States v. Turkette" clarified that for a
RICO violation, there must be proof of both an "enterprise" and a "pattern of
racketeering activity." The enterprise is defined as a group of individuals
associated for a common purpose, and the pattern of racketeering activity
involves a series of criminal acts. This aligns with the proposition that

=== PAGE 16 ===

defendants must knowingly agree to participate in such an enterprise
through a pattern of racketeering activity, supporting the claim of a RICO
conspiracy under § 1962(d).
Salinas v. U.S., 522 U.S. 52, 118 S.Ct. 469, 139 L.Ed.2d 352 (1997)
U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
To be convicted of conspiracy to violate RICO under §1962(d), the
conspirator need not himself have committed or agreed to commit the two
or more predicate acts, such as bribery, requisite for a substantive RICO
offense under §1962(c). Section 1962(d)-which forbids 'any person to
conspire to violate' §1962(c)-is even more comprehensive than the general
conspiracy provision applicable to federal crimes, §371, since it contains no
requirement of an overt or specific act to effect the conspiracy's object.
Summary
Under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d), a RICO conspiracy does not require the
conspirator to have committed or agreed to commit the predicate acts
themselves. This supports the proposition that the Defendants' agreement to
participate in the racketeering enterprise, as alleged in the complaint, is
sufficient for a RICO conspiracy claim. The passage also highlights that §
1962(d) is more comprehensive than the general conspiracy statute, as it
does not require an overt act, aligning with the proposition that coordinated
actions and shared objectives among Defendants can support a RICO
conspiracy claim.

U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
RICO makes it 'unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any
enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign
commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of
such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.' 18 U.S.C.
§ 1962(c) (emphasis added). ... The instructions also adequately told the jury
that the enterprise needed to have the structural attributes that may be
inferred from the statutory language. As noted, the trial judge told the jury
that the Government was required to prove that there was 'an ongoing
organization with some sort of framework, formal or informal, for carrying
out its objectives' and that 'the various members and associates of the
association function[ed] as a continuing unit to achieve a common purpose.'

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
The passage from "Boyle v. United States" clarifies that for a RICO claim, it
is necessary to prove the existence of an enterprise that functions as a
continuing unit with a common purpose. This aligns with the proposition
that the Defendants knowingly agreed to participate in a racketeering
enterprise. The passage also emphasizes that the enterprise can have a
formal or informal structure, which supports the idea that coordinated
actions and shared objectives among the Defendants can constitute an
enterprise under RICO.

106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989)
U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
RICO renders criminally and civilly liable 'any person' who uses or invests
income derived 'from a pattern of racketeering activity' to acquire an
interest in or to operate an enterprise engaged in interstate commerce, §
1962(a); who acquires or maintains an interest in or control of such an
enterprise 'through a pattern of racketeering activity,' § 1962(b); who, being
employed by or associated with such an enterprise, conducts or participates
in the conduct of its affairs 'through a pattern of racketeering activity,' §
1962(c); or, finally, who conspires to violate the first three subsections of §
1962, § 1962(d).
Summary
Liability under RICO for individuals who conspire to violate the provisions of
§ 1962, which includes participating in the conduct of an enterprise through
a pattern of racketeering activity. This directly supports the proposition that
a RICO conspiracy claim requires proof of an agreement to participate in
such conduct. The passage also emphasizes the broad applicability of RICO
to various forms of criminal activity, which aligns with the proposition's
assertion of coordinated actions and shared objectives among defendants.

Courts have interpreted these statutory provisions to require that a RICO

States v. Ortiz, No. C 12-00119 SI, 2013 WL 6842541, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Dec.
27, 2013) (applying Salinas and stating that '[i]t is sufficient that the
indictment alleges that [the defendant] knew about the enterprise's
racketeering activities and agreed to help facilitate them'). This requires an
allegation that the defendant agreed that a co-conspirator would commit at
least two acts of racketeering activity.
Summary
For a RICO conspiracy claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d), it is necessary to
allege that the defendant knowingly joined a conspiracy with the objective of
operating an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. The
passage supports the proposition by confirming that the complaint's
allegations of coordinated actions and shared objectives among the
Defendants align with the legal requirements for a RICO conspiracy claim.
The passage also emphasizes that it is sufficient to allege that the defendant
knew about and agreed to facilitate the scheme, which is consistent with the
proposition's assertion of Defendants' knowing agreement and overt actions.
United States v. Fisher, Case No. 15-20652 (E.D. Mich. Aug 27, 2018)
U.S. District Court — Eastern District of Michigan
Extract
The existence of the racketeering enterprise is a required element of the
RICO conspiracy offense charged in Count One. 18 USC §1962 sets forth the
following relevant prohibited conduct: An association-in-fact racketeering
enterprise, as alleged in the present indictment, must be 'a continuing unit
that functions with a common purpose.' United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S.
576 (1981). It must have at least three structural features: 'a purpose,
relationships among those associated with the racketeering enterprise, and
longevity sufficient to permit these associates to pursue the racketeering
enterprises' purpose.' Boyle v. United States, 556 US 938, 946 (2009). The
government need only show that a defendant agreed to participate in the
conduct of the enterprise and agreed that he or a coconspirator would
commit two acts of racketeering.
Summary
Necessary elements for establishing a RICO conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. §
1962(d), including the existence of a racketeering enterprise with a common
purpose, relationships among associates, and sufficient longevity. It also
clarifies that the government must show an agreement to participate in the
enterprise and the commission of at least two acts of racketeering. These
elements align with the proposition that the defendants knowingly agreed to

participate in a racketeering enterprise and took overt actions in
furtherance of the conspiracy.
United States v. Larson, 07-CR-304S (W.D. N.Y. Dec 05, 2011)
U.S. District Court — Western District of New York
Extract
This Court concludes Count One of the indictment adequately alleges the
necessary elements of a RICO conspiracy. The indictment alleges that the
charged Defendants 'unlawfully and knowingly combined, conspired,
confederated and agreed, together, with each other, and with others, to
violate the provisions of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1962(c); that
is, to conduct and participate, directly and indirectly, in the conduct of the
affairs of the Local 17 Criminal Enterprise through a pattern of racketeering
activity,' and that '[i]t was a part of the conspiracy that during the aforesaid
period, [Defendants], together and with others, agreed that a conspirator
employed by or associated with the Local 17 Criminal Enterprise would
commit at least two acts of racketeering activity in the conduct of the affairs
of the Local 17 Criminal Enterprise.'
Summary
The passage from "United States v. Larson" discusses the necessary
elements to allege a RICO conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d). It
emphasizes that the indictment must allege that defendants knowingly
agreed to participate in the conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of
racketeering activity. The passage supports the proposition by illustrating
that the allegations of coordinated actions and shared objectives among
defendants are sufficient to state a RICO conspiracy offense.
U.S. v. Brooklier, 685 F.2d 1208 (9th Cir. 1982)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Ninth Circuit
Extract
The essence of a RICO conspiracy is not an agreement to commit
racketeering acts, but an agreement to conduct or participate in the affairs
of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering. 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c)... The
purpose of the RICO statute is to allow a single prosecution of persons who
engage in a series of criminal acts for an enterprise, even if different
defendants perform different tasks or participate in separate acts of
racketeering. The same persons need not commit or endorse the same acts
of racketeering. It is sufficient if a defendant who participates in an
enterprise through a pattern of racketeering knows that the enterprise
operates by a pattern of racketeering.

=== PAGE 20 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
A RICO conspiracy involves an agreement to participate in the affairs of an
enterprise through a pattern of racketeering, rather than merely agreeing to
commit individual racketeering acts. It emphasizes that different defendants
can perform different tasks within the enterprise, and it is sufficient for a
defendant to know that the enterprise operates through a pattern of
racketeering. This supports the proposition that coordinated actions and
shared objectives among defendants can establish a RICO conspiracy under
§ 1962(d).

U.S. District Court — Middle District of Florida
Extract
Congress designed the Federal Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act (RICO), Title 18, United States Code, Section 1961, et
seq. as a flexible tool to fight organized crime. As such, it makes the
following activities unlawful: ... (d) conspiring to violate any of the
provisions of Section 1962(a)-(c). 18 U.S.C. § 1962. ... To engage in a 'pattern
of racketeering activity,' the defendant must have participated in 'at least
two acts of racketeering activity, one of which occurred after the effective
date of [RICO] and the last of which occurred within ten years (excluding
any term of imprisonment) after the commission of a prior act of
racketeering activity.' 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5). Finally, 'enterprise' is defined
under the statute as 'any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or
other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals associated in fact
although not a legal entity.' Id. § 1961(c).
Summary
Unlawful activities under the RICO statute, including conspiring to violate
its provisions, which directly relates to the proposition of a RICO conspiracy
claim under § 1962(d). It also explains the requirement of a "pattern of
racketeering activity," which supports the need for coordinated actions and
shared objectives among defendants, as alleged in the complaint. The
definition of "enterprise" further supports the notion of a group of
individuals associated in fact, which aligns with the allegations of a
racketeering enterprise.

A RICO conspiracy claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d) requires proof of an
agreement to conduct or participate in the affairs of an enterprise through a

U.S. v. Zielie, 734 F.2d 1447 (11th Cir. 1984)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Eleventh Circuit
Extract
In United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 101 S.Ct. 2524, 69 L.Ed.2d 246
(1981), the Supreme Court held that a RICO enterprise could be engaged
solely in illegitimate activity without fusing the enterprise with the pattern
of racketeering activity. In reaching its decision the Court discussed the
elements of RICO and the meaning of the word 'enterprise' under the
statute. It stated: That a wholly criminal enterprise comes within the ambit
of the statute does not mean that a 'pattern of racketeering activity' is an
'enterprise.' In order to secure a conviction under RICO, the Government
must prove both the existence of an 'enterprise' and the connected 'pattern
of racketeering activity.' The enterprise is an entity, for present purposes a
group of persons associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a
course of conduct. The pattern of racketeering activity is, on the other hand,
a series of criminal acts as defined by the statute [citation omitted]. The
former is proved by evidence of an ongoing organization, formal or informal,
and by evidence that the various associates function as a continuing unit.
The latter is proved by evidence of the requisite number of acts of
racketeering committed by the participants in the enterprise.
Summary
For a RICO violation, both an enterprise and a pattern of racketeering
activity must be proven. This supports the proposition by indicating that the
allegations of coordinated actions and shared objectives among the
Defendants could establish the existence of an enterprise and a pattern of

U.S. v. Zemek, 634 F.2d 1159 (9th Cir. 1980)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Ninth Circuit
Extract
The essence of a RICO conspiracy is not an agreement to commit predicate
crimes but an agreement to conduct or participate in the conduct of the
affairs of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering. 'Pattern' is
expressly defined as two or more predicate offenses.
Summary
A RICO conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d) does not require an agreement
to commit specific predicate crimes but rather an agreement to conduct or
participate in the conduct of an enterprise's affairs through a pattern of
racketeering activity. This aligns with the proposition that the defendants
knowingly agreed to participate in the racketeering enterprise and took
overt actions in furtherance of the conspiracy, as the focus is on the
agreement to engage in the enterprise's affairs through a pattern of illegal
activities.

U.S. Court of Appeals — District of Columbia Circuit
Extract
The RICO statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d), makes it unlawful to conspire to
violate § 1962(c), which, in turn, provides that it is unlawful for anyone
'employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities
of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate,
directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a
pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt.' ... An
association-in-fact enterprise must have three structural features: 'a
purpose, relationships among those associated with the enterprise, and

The crime of associating with criminals? An argument for extending the
Reves "operation or management" test to RICO conspiracy.
Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology - Northwestern University,
School of Law - Baumgarterl, Sarah - 2006-09-22
Extract
Unlike the general federal conspiracy statute, it is also well accepted that
RICO conspiracy does not require proof of any overt act. Beyond this, a
defendant must merely agree to the illegitimate objectives that constitute
the crime. The exact content of this agreement is where further questions
arise. There is apparent consensus that a RICO conspiracy charge must
include an intentional agreement on the part of some defendant to violate a
substantive provision of the statute; agreement merely to commit a
predicate offense would not be sufficient. Coupled with this requirement is
the need that the defendant possess some degree of knowledge that the
conspiratorial enterprise extends beyond her own personal participation.
Summary
The passage explains that for a RICO conspiracy charge under 18 U.S.C. §
1962(d), it is not necessary to prove an overt act, but there must be an
intentional agreement to violate a substantive provision of the statute. This
aligns with the proposition that the defendants knowingly agreed to

participate in the conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering
activity. The passage also highlights the need for the defendant to have
knowledge that the enterprise extends beyond their personal participation,

Extract
The Supreme Court accepted the government&#39;s arguments that,
because a RICO conspiracy does not require proof of an overt act, a RICO
conspiracy is established if the government proves that a defendant agreed
that the conspirators, as a group, would violate RICO by undertaking a
pattern of racketeering activity.(454) ... The Salinas Court stated that a
RICO conspiracy conviction, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. [sections] 1962(d), does
not require an overt or specific act.(458) ... The Court found that since
&#34;Marmolejo committed at least two acts of racketeering activity when
he accepted numerous bribes and that Salinas knew about and agreed to
facilitate the scheme . . . [and that this was] sufficient to support a
conviction under [[sections] 1962(d)].&#34;(464)
Summary
The passage explains that under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d), a RICO conspiracy
does not require proof of an overt act. Instead, it is sufficient to show that
the defendant agreed that the conspirators would engage in a pattern of
racketeering activity. This supports the proposition that the complaint's
allegations of coordinated actions and shared objectives among the
Defendants can establish a RICO conspiracy claim, even if specific overt acts
are not proven.

For a criminal RICO conspiracy action arising under [section] 1962(d), 'the

he took affirmative steps, inconsistent with the objectives of the conspiracy,
to disavow or to defeat the conspiratorial objectives. ... To be convicted as a
conspirator, one must be shown to have possessed knowledge of only the

Summary
The passage explains that for a RICO conspiracy claim under § 1962(d), the
statute of limitations is tied to the achievement or abandonment of the
conspiracy's objectives, not the timing of the predicate acts. It also clarifies
that a defendant's knowledge of the general contours of the conspiracy is
sufficient for conviction, which aligns with the proposition that defendants
knowingly agreed to participate in the enterprise. This supports the idea
that coordinated actions and shared objectives among defendants can
substantiate a RICO conspiracy claim.

American Criminal Law Review - Georgetown University Law Center -
Bremer, Lance - 1997-01-01
Extract
A RICO conspiracy differs from an ordinary conspiracy in two respects: it
need not embrace an overt act, and it is broader and may encompass a
greater variety of conduct. When proving an agreement on the overall
objective, use of 'circumstantial evidence to show that each defendant must
necessarily have known that the others were also conspiring to participate
in the same enterprise through a pattern of racketeering' is allowed.
Summary
The passage explains that a RICO conspiracy does not require an overt act,
which aligns with the proposition that defendants can be held liable for
agreeing to participate in a racketeering enterprise. It also highlights the
use of circumstantial evidence to demonstrate that defendants were aware
of and participated in the conspiracy, supporting the idea that coordinated
actions and shared objectives among defendants can substantiate a RICO
conspiracy claim.

conspiracy have been either achieved or abandoned,' even if the actual
illegal predicate acts occurred more than five years prior to the RICO
action's initiation. ... A defendant can assert withdrawal from the conspiracy
as a defense to an action brought under [section] 1962(d) through proof that
he took affirmative steps, inconsistent with the objectives of the conspiracy,
to disavow or to defeat the conspiratorial objectives.
Summary
The passage explains that a RICO conspiracy claim under § 1962(d) does not
require the completion of illegal acts within a specific timeframe, as long as
the conspiracy's objectives have not been achieved or abandoned. This
supports the proposition by indicating that the coordinated actions and
shared objectives among defendants can establish a RICO conspiracy, even if
overt acts occurred outside the typical statute of limitations. Additionally,
the passage outlines the defense of withdrawal, which is relevant to the
proposition's focus on defendants' participation in the conspiracy.

Extract
The penalty for a RICO conspiracy usually parallels the penalty for the
offense that was the object of the conspiracy. In addition, consecutive
sentences are often permitted when the substantive violation and the
conspiracy are both proved. See United States v. Felix, 503 U.S. 378, 389-90
(1992) (holding substantive crime and conspiracy to commit crime are
separate and distinct offenses and therefore not the same offense for double
jeopardy purposes).
Summary
Penalties associated with RICO conspiracies, emphasizing that a RICO
conspiracy is a distinct offense from the substantive crime. This supports the
proposition by highlighting that a RICO conspiracy claim under § 1962(d)
requires proof of an agreement to participate in the conduct of an enterprise
through a pattern of racketeering activity, which aligns with the allegations
of coordinated actions and shared objectives among the Defendants.

Extract
First, the defendant must have agreed, by some manifestation, to conduct or
participate in the affairs of an enterprise. Second, the defendant must have
agreed to the commission of at least two predicate acts. There can be no
conspiracy conviction for the defendant who was affiliated with the
enterprise but did not agree to the commission of the acts and to the
involvement of the enterprise.
Summary
Requirements for a RICO conspiracy conviction, which include an
agreement to participate in the enterprise's affairs and an agreement to
commit at least two predicate acts. This directly supports the proposition
that the defendants must have knowingly agreed to participate in the
conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity, as
alleged in the complaint.

Extract
Section 1962(d) prohibits conspiring to violate any provision of [sections]
1962.(210) A defendant not guilty of the substantive offense may still be
convicted of conspiracy if there is proof of an agreement to commit the
substantive crime.(211) Resolving a split among the circuits regarding what
constitutes an 'agreement to commit the substantive offense,' the Supreme
Court in Salinas v. United States (212) held that the conspiracy provision of
RICO, unlike an ordinary conspiracy, does not require some overt act on the
defendant's part. Instead, the 'partners in the criminal plan must agree to
pursue the same criminal objective,' even if 'each conspirator does not agree
to commit or facilitate each and every part of the substantive offense.'(213)
Summary
The passage explains that under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d), a RICO conspiracy
does not require each conspirator to commit an overt act, but rather to
agree to pursue the same criminal objective. This supports the proposition
that the defendants' agreement to participate in the racketeering enterprise,
even without committing each act, is sufficient for a RICO conspiracy claim.

The Brief - American Bar Association - 2024-01-01
Extract
A violation of § 1962(c), the section on which Sedima relies, requires (1)
conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity. The plaintiff must allege each of the elements to state a claim. They
are all equally essential components, and the complaint will fail if any one of
them is not adequately pleaded. In particular, RICO claims based on mail or
wire fraud must comport with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b)’s
requirement that allegations involving fraud be pleaded with particularity.
The practitioner through their pleadings must articulate with great care and
attention a viable racketeering claim.
Summary
A RICO claim under § 1962(c) requires the plaintiff to allege conduct of an
enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. This aligns with the
proposition that defendants must knowingly agree to participate in such
conduct. The passage emphasizes the necessity of pleading each element of
a RICO claim, which supports the need for detailed allegations of
coordinated actions and shared objectives among defendants, as stated in
the proposition.

Extract
RICO CONSPIRACY The essence of a RICO conspiracy is the existence of an
agreement to violate RICO's substantive provisions. RICO conspiracy was
established by proof of: (a) of an agreement to join a racketeering scheme,
(b) of the defendant's knowing engagement in the scheme with the intent
that its overall goals be effectuated, and (c) that the scheme involved, or by
agreement between any members of the conspiracy was intended to involve,
two or more predicate acts of racketeering.
Summary
Essential elements required to establish a RICO conspiracy, which include
an agreement to join a racketeering scheme, knowing engagement with
intent to effectuate the scheme's goals, and involvement in or intent to
involve two or more predicate acts of racketeering. These elements align
with the proposition that the complaint alleges Defendants knowingly
agreed to participate in a racketeering enterprise and took overt actions in
furtherance of the conspiracy, supporting a RICO conspiracy claim under 18
U.S.C. § 1962(d).
RICO: A Primer
Extract
Under Section 1962(d), it is a violation to conspire to commit any of the
three substantive RICO offenses. To prove a violation of Section 1962(d), a
plaintiff must prove the following elements: The existence of an enterprise
(or that an enterprise would exist); That the enterprise was (or would be)
engaged in, or its activities affected (or would affect), interstate or foreign
commerce; and That each defendant knowingly agreed that a conspirator
would commit a violation of 18 U.S.C. ' 1962(c). The Supreme Court held
that to establish a RICO conspiracy offense under Section 1962(d), there is
no requirement that the defendant 'himself committed or agreed to commit
the two predicate acts requisite for a substantive RICO offense under '
1962(c).' The Supreme Court explained: A conspiracy may exist even if a
conspirator does not agree to commit or facilitate each and every part of the
substantive offense. The partners in the criminal plan must agree to pursue
the same criminal objective and may divide up the work, yet each is
responsible for the acts of each other.
Summary
Under Section 1962(d), a RICO conspiracy claim does not require each
defendant to have committed the predicate acts themselves. Instead, it
requires proof of an agreement to pursue a shared criminal objective. The
passage explains that conspirators can divide the work, and each is

responsible for the acts of the others. This supports the proposition that the
defendants' coordinated actions and shared objectives can establish a RICO
conspiracy claim.
RICO: A Primer
Extract
Under Section 1962(d), it is a violation to conspire to commit any of the
three substantive RICO offenses. To prove a violation of Section 1962(d), a
plaintiff must prove the following elements: * The existence of an enterprise
(or that an enterprise would exist); * That the enterprise was (or would be)
engaged in, or its activities affected (or would affect), interstate or foreign
commerce; and * That each defendant knowingly agreed that a conspirator
would commit a violation of 18 U.S.C. ' 1962(c). The Supreme Court held
that to establish a RICO conspiracy offense under Section 1962(d), there is
no requirement that the defendant 'himself committed or agreed to commit
the two predicate acts requisite for a substantive RICO offense under '
1962(c).' The Supreme Court explained: A conspiracy may exist even if a
conspirator does not agree to commit or facilitate each and every part of the
substantive offense. The partners in the criminal plan must agree to pursue
the same criminal objective and may divide up the work, yet each is
responsible for the acts of each other. If conspirators have a plan which calls
for some conspirators to perpetrate the crime and others to provide support,
the supporters are as guilty as the perpetrators.
Summary
Elements required to establish a RICO conspiracy under Section 1962(d),
emphasizing that a defendant does not need to commit the predicate acts
themselves but must knowingly agree to the conspiracy's objectives. This
supports the proposition that the defendants' coordinated actions and
shared objectives, such as filing false legal documents and coordinating
eviction proceedings, can substantiate a RICO conspiracy claim.
