Question
Does traveling to Oklahoma to prepare fraudulent documents for submission
in Texas state courts satisfy any obstruction of justice provisions under the
federal RICO statute (18 U.S.C. §§ 1961-1968) if it is part of a broader
scheme to deprive someone of federally protected civil rights, even if the
fraudulent documents are intended to affect only state court proceedings?
Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
Preparing fraudulent documents in Oklahoma for submission in Texas state
courts can potentially satisfy obstruction of justice provisions under the
federal RICO statute when part of a broader scheme to deprive someone of
federally protected civil rights. This conclusion is supported by the inclusion
of obstruction of justice (18 U.S.C. § 1503) and obstruction of state or local
law enforcement (18 U.S.C. § 1511) as predicate acts within RICO's
definition of "racketeering activity" under 18 U.S.C. § 1961.
Summary
The preparation of fraudulent documents in Oklahoma for submission in
Texas state courts may constitute obstruction of justice under the federal
RICO statute (18 U.S.C. §§ 1961-1968) if it forms part of a broader scheme to
deprive someone of federally protected civil rights. While the fraudulent
documents themselves may be intended to affect only state court
proceedings, several provisions within the RICO statute's definition of
"racketeering activity" encompass obstruction of justice (§ 1503),
obstruction of criminal investigations (§ 1510), obstruction of state or local
law enforcement (§ 1511), and witness tampering (§ 1512). These provisions
could apply to interstate activities aimed at interfering with judicial
proceedings, regardless of whether they target federal or state courts.
For such activity to fall under RICO, it must constitute a "pattern of
racketeering activity" that affects interstate commerce and is connected to
an "enterprise." The interstate nature of preparing documents in Oklahoma
for use in Texas inherently implicates interstate commerce. Additionally, if
these activities are part of a broader scheme to deprive someone of federally
protected civil rights, they likely satisfy the "continuity plus relationship"
requirement established by the Supreme Court for a pattern of racketeering
activity. The key consideration is whether the preparation of fraudulent
documents, combined with other activities in the scheme, forms a pattern of
related criminal acts sufficient to trigger RICO's provisions.

Background and Relevant Law
Legislation: The RICO Framework
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), codified at
18 U.S.C. §§ 1961-1968, was designed to combat organized crime and
corruption. Two key provisions are central to answering the question at
hand: the definition of "racketeering activity" in § 1961 and the prohibited
activities outlined in § 1962.
Section 1961 defines "racketeering activity" as encompassing various
criminal offenses, including obstruction of justice and related crimes.
Specifically, 18 U.S.C. § 1961 states that racketeering activity includes
"section 1503 (relating to obstruction of justice), section 1510 (relating to
obstruction of criminal investigations), section 1511 (relating to the
obstruction of State or local law enforcement), section 1512 (relating to
tampering with a witness, victim, or an informant), section 1513 (relating to
retaliating against a witness, victim, or an informant)."
The prohibited activities under RICO are outlined in 18 U.S.C. § 1962, which
states: "It shall be unlawful for any person through a pattern of racketeering
activity or through collection of an unlawful debt to acquire or maintain,
directly or indirectly, any interest in or control of any enterprise which is
engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign
commerce." This provision establishes that RICO violations require a pattern
of racketeering activity that affects interstate or foreign commerce.
Case Law: Requirements for RICO Claims
In Heden v. Hill, 937 F.Supp. 1230 (S.D. Tex. 1996), the court elucidated the
elements necessary for RICO claims. The court noted that "Under RICO,
while four distinct offenses are declared to be unlawful, common elements
are present in all four offenses... 'Racketeering activity' is defined in §
1961(1) in terms of a list of state and federal crimes... Under § 1961(1)(B),
racketeering activity includes any act which is indictable under a number of
federal criminal statutes, including mail fraud and wire fraud. Any act that
does not fall within the purview of RICO's definition of predicate offenses is
not an act of 'racketeering activity.'"
This clarification is crucial because it establishes that for an activity to
qualify as "racketeering" under RICO, it must be specifically enumerated in
the statute's definition. As noted earlier, obstruction of justice (§ 1503) and
obstruction of state or local law enforcement (§ 1511) are expressly included
in this definition.
Secondary Materials: Pattern Requirement and RICO
Violations
The secondary source RICO: A Primer (2022) provides additional insight into
the requirements for establishing a RICO violation. It emphasizes that "The
heart of a RICO case is the existence of a pattern of racketeering activity"

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
and that "A 'pattern' may exist where any combination of two or more
offenses occurred within a period of time."
Importantly, the source references the Supreme Court case Sedima, S.P.R.L.
v. Imrex Co., which held that "the RICO pattern element requires more than
merely proving two predicate acts of racketeering. Rather, proof of
'continuity plus relationship' is necessary." This establishes that a pattern
requires not just multiple acts, but acts that are related and demonstrate
some form of continuity.
The source also outlines the four distinct RICO violations under section
1962: "(a) acquiring or operating an enterprise using racketeering proceeds;
(b) controlling an enterprise using racketeering activities; (c) conducting the
affairs of an enterprise using racketeering activities; and (d) conspiring to so
acquire, control, or conduct."
Analysis
Obstruction of Justice Provisions Under RICO
To determine whether traveling to Oklahoma to prepare fraudulent
documents for submission in Texas state courts satisfies obstruction of
justice provisions under the federal RICO statute, we must analyze whether
such activities constitute "racketeering activity" as defined in § 1961.
The definition of "racketeering activity" explicitly includes multiple
provisions related to obstruction of justice:
Section 1503 (obstruction of justice)
Section 1510 (obstruction of criminal investigations)
Section 1511 (obstruction of state or local law enforcement)
Section 1512 (tampering with a witness, victim, or informant)
Section 1513 (retaliating against a witness, victim, or informant)
Of particular relevance to the present question are sections 1503 and 1511.
Section 1503 addresses obstruction of justice generally, while section 1511
specifically addresses obstruction of state or local law enforcement. The
preparation of fraudulent documents intended for submission in state court
proceedings could potentially violate either or both of these provisions if the
activity is designed to interfere with the proper administration of justice.
Notably, section 1511's inclusion as a predicate act suggests that RICO
contemplates federal jurisdiction over schemes that obstruct state and local
judicial processes, not just federal ones. This is significant because it
indicates that the fraudulent documents' intended use in state courts does
not automatically preclude RICO applicability.
Interstate Activity and Commerce Nexus
The preparation of fraudulent documents in Oklahoma for submission in
Texas courts inherently involves interstate activity. This interstate element is
important because 18 U.S.C. § 1962 requires that the enterprise in question
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
5. 

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
"is engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign
commerce."
The fact that the hypothetical involves traveling across state lines to prepare
fraudulent documents that will then be transported back across state lines
for use in another state's courts demonstrates a clear connection to
interstate commerce. This interstate nature of the activity helps establish
the commerce nexus required under RICO.
Pattern of Racketeering Activity
According to RICO: A Primer (2022), a pattern of racketeering activity
requires both "continuity plus relationship" among the predicate acts. The
preparation of fraudulent documents alone may not constitute a pattern.
However, the question specifies that these activities are "part of a broader
scheme to deprive someone of federally protected civil rights."
This broader scheme context is crucial. If the preparation of fraudulent
documents is one of multiple related acts aimed at depriving someone of
federally protected civil rights, and these acts occur over a sufficient period
of time or with a threat of continued criminal activity, they likely satisfy the
"continuity plus relationship" requirement for establishing a pattern under
RICO.
The requirement that the fraudulent documents be part of a "broader
scheme" suggests the existence of additional predicate acts beyond the
document preparation itself. If these additional acts also qualify as
racketeering activity under § 1961, and they demonstrate sufficient
continuity and relationship to the document preparation, they collectively
could establish the required pattern.
Connection to an Enterprise
RICO violations require connection to an "enterprise." While the provided
materials don't extensively address the enterprise requirement, 18 U.S.C. §
1962 clarifies that the prohibited activities involve a "pattern of racketeering
activity" that affects an "enterprise which is engaged in, or the activities of
which affect, interstate or foreign commerce."
In the context of the hypothetical scenario, the "enterprise" might be a
group of individuals organized for the purpose of depriving someone of
federally protected civil rights, using fraudulent documents in state court
proceedings as one means to accomplish this goal. If this group
demonstrates sufficient organization and continuity to qualify as an
enterprise under RICO, and the preparation of fraudulent documents is
conducted through or benefits this enterprise, then this element of RICO
would be satisfied.
Impact of State vs. Federal Court Proceedings
A key aspect of the question is whether RICO applies when the fraudulent
documents are "intended to affect only state court proceedings." Based on

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
the provided materials, there are several reasons why RICO could still apply
in this scenario:
Section 1511, which relates to "obstruction of State or local law
enforcement," is explicitly included as a predicate act under 18 U.S.C. §
1961. This indicates that RICO contemplates federal jurisdiction over
schemes that obstruct state judicial processes.
The interstate nature of the activity (Oklahoma to Texas) provides a
nexus to federal jurisdiction, regardless of whether the targeted
proceedings are in state or federal court.
The broader context of depriving someone of "federally protected civil
rights" suggests a federal interest that could justify federal jurisdiction
under RICO, even if the immediate target of the fraudulent documents
is a state court proceeding.
Heden v. Hill, 937 F.Supp. 1230 (S.D. Tex. 1996) emphasizes that
racketeering activity includes "any act which is indictable under a number of
federal criminal statutes, including mail fraud and wire fraud." If the
preparation and submission of fraudulent documents involved mail or wire
communications across state lines, this could potentially implicate mail
fraud or wire fraud statutes, which are also predicate acts under RICO.
The Broader Scheme to Deprive Federally Protected Civil
Rights
The question specifies that the preparation of fraudulent documents is "part
of a broader scheme to deprive someone of federally protected civil rights."
This context is significant because:
It suggests a purpose and continuity that may help establish the
"pattern" requirement under RICO.
It indicates potential violations of federal civil rights laws, which could
serve as additional predicate acts under RICO if they qualify under §
1961.
It reinforces the federal interest in the scheme, despite the state-court
focus of the fraudulent documents themselves.
The deprivation of federally protected civil rights often involves multiple
acts over time, which aligns with the "continuity plus relationship"
requirement discussed in RICO: A Primer (2022). If the preparation of
fraudulent documents is one component of this broader pattern, and the
pattern includes at least two predicate acts under § 1961 that demonstrate
continuity and relationship, then RICO could apply.

Exceptions and Caveats
Requirement of Specific Predicate Acts
As emphasized in Heden v. Hill, 937 F.Supp. 1230 (S.D. Tex. 1996), "Any act
that does not fall within the purview of RICO's definition of predicate
offenses is not an act of 'racketeering activity.'" This means that the
preparation of fraudulent documents must specifically violate one of the
enumerated offenses in § 1961 to qualify as a predicate act under RICO.
While obstruction of justice (§ 1503) and obstruction of state or local law
enforcement (§ 1511) are included in the definition, the specific elements of
these offenses must be met. The mere preparation of fraudulent documents
may not, by itself, satisfy these elements without additional factors such as:
Intent to influence, obstruct, or impede the due administration of
justice
A pending judicial proceeding
Knowledge of the pending proceeding
A nexus between the obstructive conduct and the proceeding
Without meeting these specific elements, the document preparation might
not qualify as a predicate act, regardless of its fraudulent nature or
interstate character.
Pattern Requirement Limitations
The "pattern" requirement presents another potential limitation. As noted in 
RICO: A Primer (2022), the Supreme Court in Sedima established that a
pattern requires "continuity plus relationship," not merely two predicate
acts. If the preparation of fraudulent documents is an isolated event with
insufficient connection to other racketeering activities, it may fail to
establish the required pattern.
Additionally, if the "broader scheme" referenced in the question does not
involve additional acts that qualify as racketeering activity under § 1961, or
if these acts lack sufficient continuity and relationship, then a pattern may
not be established despite the interstate nature of the document
preparation.
Enterprise Connection Requirement
For RICO to apply, the pattern of racketeering activity must be connected to
an "enterprise." If the preparation of fraudulent documents and the broader
scheme to deprive civil rights are conducted by individuals acting
independently, without sufficient organization or continuity to constitute an
enterprise, then RICO may not apply despite the presence of predicate acts.

Interstate Commerce Nexus Requirements
While the interstate nature of traveling from Oklahoma to Texas suggests a
commerce nexus, this connection must be substantive rather than merely
incidental. If the interstate aspect of the activity is minimal or tangential to
the scheme, it might not satisfy the requirement that the enterprise "is
engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce"
as required by 18 U.S.C. § 1962.
Conclusion
Based on the analysis of the provided materials, traveling to Oklahoma to
prepare fraudulent documents for submission in Texas state courts can
potentially satisfy obstruction of justice provisions under the federal RICO
statute when it is part of a broader scheme to deprive someone of federally
protected civil rights.
The inclusion of both obstruction of justice (§ 1503) and obstruction of state
or local law enforcement (§ 1511) as predicate acts under 18 U.S.C. § 1961
indicates that RICO contemplates federal jurisdiction over schemes that
obstruct state judicial processes. The interstate nature of the activity
provides a nexus to federal jurisdiction and helps satisfy the commerce
requirement under 18 U.S.C. § 1962.
However, for RICO to apply, several additional requirements must be met:
The preparation of fraudulent documents must specifically violate one
of the enumerated offenses in § 1961, such as obstruction of justice or
obstruction of state law enforcement.
The fraudulent document preparation must be part of a "pattern of
racketeering activity," which requires not just multiple acts but
"continuity plus relationship" among these acts, as established in
Supreme Court precedent and noted in RICO: A Primer (2022).
The pattern must be connected to an "enterprise" that affects interstate
commerce, as required by 18 U.S.C. § 1962.
The interstate element must be substantive rather than merely
incidental to the scheme.
Therefore, while the preparation of fraudulent documents in Oklahoma for
submission in Texas state courts could potentially trigger RICO's obstruction
of justice provisions, especially when part of a broader scheme to deprive
someone of federally protected civil rights, the applicability of RICO would
ultimately depend on whether all elements of the statute are satisfied. The
fact that the fraudulent documents are intended to affect only state court
proceedings does not, by itself, preclude RICO's application, particularly
given the explicit inclusion of obstruction of state law enforcement as a
predicate act and the broader context of deprivation of federally protected
civil rights.

Legal Authorities
Heden v. Hill, 937 F.Supp. 1230 (S.D. Tex. 1996)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of Texas
Extract
Under RICO, while four distinct offenses are declared to be unlawful,
common elements are present in all four offenses... 'Racketeering activity' is
defined in § 1961(1) in terms of a list of state and federal crimes... Under §
1961(1)(B), racketeering activity includes any act which is indictable under
a number of federal criminal statutes, including mail fraud and wire fraud.
Any act that does not fall within the purview of RICO's definition of
predicate offenses is not an act of 'racketeering activity.'
Summary
If an act does not fall within the definition of predicate offenses under RICO,
it is not considered "racketeering activity." Therefore, the preparation of
fraudulent documents, if it involves mail or wire fraud, could potentially be
considered racketeering activity under RICO.
18 U.S.C. § 1961 18 U.S.C. § 1961 Definitions

Summary
The passage lists various acts that constitute "racketeering activity" under
the RICO statute, including obstruction of justice (section 1503), obstruction
of criminal investigations (section 1510), and obstruction of State or local
law enforcement (section 1511). These provisions could potentially apply to
the preparation of fraudulent documents intended to obstruct justice in state
court proceedings, especially if part of a broader scheme to violate federally
protected civil rights. The RICO statute is designed to address organized
crime and corruption, and its provisions are broadly construed to include
various forms of obstruction.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
It shall be unlawful for any person through a pattern of racketeering activity
or through collection of an unlawful debt to acquire or maintain, directly or
indirectly, any interest in or control of any enterprise which is engaged in, or
the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce.
Summary
The passage from 18 U.S.C. § 1962 outlines unlawful activities related to
racketeering, specifically focusing on the acquisition or maintenance of
interest in an enterprise through racketeering activities that affect
interstate or foreign commerce. The key element here is the impact on
interstate commerce, which could be relevant if the fraudulent activities in
Oklahoma and Texas are part of a broader scheme that affects interstate
commerce. The RICO statute is designed to address patterns of racketeering
activity, which could include the preparation and submission of fraudulent
documents if they are part of a larger scheme.
RICO: A Primer
Extract
The heart of a RICO case is the existence of a pattern of racketeering
activity. Under the statute, 'racketeering activity' includes a host of offenses.
Section 1961 defines the phrase to include any crime listed in subdivisions
A, B, C, D, E, F, or G of section 1961... A 'pattern' may exist where any
combination of two or more offenses occurred within a period of time. In
Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479, the Supreme Court held that the
RICO pattern element requires more than merely proving two predicate acts
of racketeering. Rather, proof of 'continuity plus relationship' is necessary...
There are four separate and distinct RICO violations set out in section 1962:
(a) acquiring or operating an enterprise using racketeering proceeds; (b)
controlling an enterprise using racketeering activities; (c) conducting the
affairs of an enterprise using racketeering activities; and (d) conspiring to so
acquire, control, or conduct.
Summary
For an action to satisfy the RICO statute, it must be part of a "pattern of
racketeering activity," which involves more than just two predicate acts; it
requires "continuity plus relationship." The passage also outlines the four
types of RICO violations under section 1962, which include conducting the
affairs of an enterprise through racketeering activities. The passage does
not specifically address the obstruction of justice provisions or the impact on
state court proceedings, but it provides a framework for understanding how
a broader scheme involving fraudulent documents could potentially fit into a
RICO violation if it meets the criteria of affecting interstate commerce and
being part of a pattern of racketeering activity.
