Plaintiff incorporates by reference public records from the Texas Supreme
Court, and requests the court to take judicial notice of these documents. The
Fifth Circuit has repeatedly held that it is proper for federal courts to take
judicial notice of matters of public record, including documents filed in state
court proceedings (Miller v. Dunn, 35 F.4th 1007 (5th Cir. 2022); LUV N'
Care, Ltd. v. Jackel Int'l Ltd., 502 F.Supp.3d 1106 (W.D. La. 2020); Wright v.
Arlington Indep. Sch. Dist., Civil Action No. 4:19-cv-00278-P (N.D. Tex. Nov
25, 2019)). Plaintiff therefore requests that this Court take judicial
knowledge of the consolidated mandamus record, as its’ authenticity is not
reasonably disputed. Here, all record references point to the public
consolidated mandamus record, as submitted to the Texas Supreme Court, a
copy of which has been served upon each defendant named in this complaint
either individually or through their agent. Link to the record: https://

bc41-bbc08c814365 All references to the record are marked herein with
“REC. [page]” and are hyperlinked to take the reader directly to the
reference. The record is filed under affidavit, and remains unopposed at the
time of filing this complaint. Therefore, Plaintiff respectfully asks that the
Court take judicial notice of the record under Federal Rule of Evidence 201,
filed on June 6, 2025, in the Texas Supreme Court under case numbers
25-0361, 25-0367, 25-0378, 25-0426, and 25-0458. II. TIMELINE OF
EVENTS BACKGROUND Morgan Michelle Myers, (“Myers”) and Charles
Dustin Myers, (“Plaintiff”) were married on June 20, 2015, and have two
daughters, C.R.M. and M.E.M, aged seven and nine. The evidence in this
case will show that in early December of 2023, the entire family was
blindsided by Myers’ sudden announcement that she wanted a divorce from
Plaintiff. REC. 717 The evidence will further show that Myers’ reasoning for
this divorce changes over time – beginning with how Plaintiff spoke to her,
and then switches to abuse and sexual harassment, and allegations of drug
abuse, claims that were only brought up in her initial pleadings. On
December 12, 2023, Plaintiff discovered a large volume of text messages
between Myers and two individuals identified as Debbie Price and Damen
Kazlauskas of Fort Worth, Texas spanning between October 2022 and
December 2023. REC. 254-714 In response to this discovery, Myers began to
communicate with Defendant Daniel Kenneth Branthoover, a resident of
Yukon, Oklahoma, who assisted her in the planning, drafting, traveling, and
submitting of fraudulent documents to the 322nd District Court of Tarrant
County designed to divest Plaintiff of his home and business operations.
When these allegations were raised to the State, they failed to adjudicate
them and violated the Plaintiff’s constitutional rights when he was deprived
of the guarantees of equal protection under the law and when he was not
afforded due process before being deprived of his property. REC. 183. The
central question is whether Defendants Munford, Kaitcer, Carter, and Baker
are victims of the initial scheme – or willing participants in an expanded
associate-in-fact enterprise that began in December of 2023 as the Myers-
Branthoover enterprise. A. The Myers-Branthoover Enterprise 1. On
December 14, 2023, Defendants Morgan Michelle Myers (“Myers)” and
Daniel Kenneth Branthoover (“Branthoover”), acting in concert and under
deceptive pretenses, (REC. 1704), initiated text-message communications
through which they formed and advanced a common plan and agreement.
Over the weekend of December 15, 2023, they met in Yukon, Oklahoma, to
further that plan ( REC. 274-278). The deceptive text message from
Defendant Branthoover claiming that he wanted to assist Plaintiff was
following an attempt by Myers to receive an ex-parte order of protection
from the 322nd District Court of Tarrant county, attempted on December 14,
2023 (REC. 78). B. Interstate Travel and Transfer 2. As part of their
agreement, both Defendants planned to draft and submit an original petition
for divorce and an affidavit of indigency to the 322nd District Court of
Tarrant County, with the intended and foreseeable result of removing
Plaintiff from his matrimonial residence at 6641 Anne Court, Watauga, Texas
76148—which also serves as his place of business for clients in the United
States, Canada, and the United Kingdom that rely on his market data
services (REC. 812 ¶ 16). 3. During Defendant Myers’s interstate travel, she
transferred the parties’ marital funds into Defendant Branthoover’s PayPal
account in the amount of $1,576 (REC. 723). Those proceeds funded a
second mobile phone (817-940-0852), listed on the fraudulent pleadings that

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Myers and Branthoover jointly prepared in Oklahoma, which Myers then
carried from Yukon to Texas on December 17, 2023 (REC. 86; 99; 102; 107).
C. Admissions 4. On December 16, 2023, Plaintiff reached out to
Branthoover and requested that the $1,576 be returned as they were needed
for Christmas gifts for the children, and for business advertising expenses
for his business. REC. 728-729. In response, defendant Branthoover
admitted that the purpose of defendant Myers’ visit was to help her prepare
paperwork for divorce litigation and confirmed that the transfer of $1,576
did in fact occur. REC. 730. Plaintiff’s bank statement from December 2023
further confirms this transaction. REC. 723. D. Post-submission
Collaboration 5. On December 18, 2023, defendant Myers submitted the
fraudulently prepared original petition for divorce, and an affidavit of
indigency to the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County. After these
documents were submitted, defendant Branthoover sent a text message to
Plaintiff on December 19, 2023, at 5:50 P.M. CST, holding himself out to be
defendant Myers’ attorney, showing his involvement extends past the initial
help in preparing the fraudulent documents. REC. 1712-1713 6. Four days
later, on December 22, 2023, defendant Myers submitted another knowingly
fraudulent application for protective to the 322nd District Court of Tarrant
County claiming that family violence had occurred on December 18, 2023,
supported by both an affidavit and unsworn declaration. REC. 108-109. E.
Significant and Intentional Misrepresentations 7. On December 27 and
December 28, 2023, respectively, the documents prepared by Myers with
the assistance of Branthoover were served on Plaintiff via the U.S.
Constable, and contained the following misrepresentations: i. That
defendant Myers could not afford court costs; REC. 72, REC. 85-96 ii. That
defendant Myers had an active order of protection against the Plaintiff with
a finding of family violence that had occurred during the marriage; REC. 78
at 10 iii. That defendant Myers was financially responsible for the family
vehicles, rent payments, utilities, and other household expenses, making
herself appear as the primary breadwinner; REC. 92 iv. That defendant
Myers would be harassed or abused if Plaintiff were given her newly
acquired phone number that was obtained while in Oklahoma; REC. 81 at
15. v. That defendant Myers and Plaintiff ceased living together on
December 1, 2023; REC. 74 at 4 vi. That family violence occurred on
December 18, 2023, in the presence of the two Children. REC. 108-109. vii.
That both family vehicles were defendant Myers’ separate property acquired
before marriage. REC. 79 at 11B F. Evidence to the Contrary 8. On the same
day Defendant Myers claimed to be in an emergency requiring the Plaintiff’s
prompt removal from the home, she can be seen at the home with Plaintiff
and the children in no state of emergency and also still cohabitating in the
marital home. REC 1715. 9. Again, on December 29, 2023, Defendant Myers
can be seen with Plaintiff at the family home, smiling and laughing with the
children in no state of emergency and still collaborating with Plaintiff in the
marital home. REC. 1735. 10. The citation for the application for protective
order ordered Respondent to show cause as to why it should not issue with a
hearing scheduled for January 16, 2024. REC. 118. 11. In response to
extensive misrepresentation above, Plaintiff prepared an original answer,
filed a motion to consolidate, and provided background information which
alleged that defendant Myers was intentionally abusing the legal process.
REC. 130-132. Plaintiff was ordered to show cause on January 16, 2024,
regarding the protective order application. REC. 118 G. Inclement Weather

and First Appearance 12. On January 15, 2024, the Tarrant County District
Courts Facebook page sent out a notice informing the members of the public
that the court would be closed on January 16, 2024, due to inclement
weather. REC. 1202. 13. Unaware of the closure at the time, the parties
appeared at the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County on January 16, 2024,
and were met with a dark courtroom, with only one judge in the building at
the time of their arrival – Defendant James Munford (“Munford”). 14.
Defendant Munford summarily ordered the Plaintiff out of his home,
inadvertently assisting the Myers-Branthoover associate-in-fact enterprise of
achieving their primary goal in having the Plaintiff removed from his
residence, despite the broader goal being to obtain a decree of divorce to
permanently divest Plaintiff of his interests. REC. 183. 15. Defendant
Munford’s initial order was baseless, made in the absence of any emergency,
without a hearing, and disregarded the Plaintiff’s pleadings, telling Myers
“you’re going to have to find evidence of family violence!” clearly aware that
this order was made without any regard to the Plaintiff’s constitutional
rights. 16. Defendant Jeffrey Kaitcer, (“Kaitcer”) walked into the courtroom
late due to the inclement weather and turned the courtroom into a laughing
matter as he began to joke with Defendant Munford, and instructed the
parties to download the AppClose app for communication, and the matter
was reset for January 22, 2024. There exists no record of this proceeding,
only marked appearances on the docket. H. Reset #1 – January 22, 2024,
Setting 17. At the January 22 reset hearing, the parties appeared only to
have the case reset once more because defendant Myers allegedly retained
the services of Defendant Cooper Carter, (“Carter”) in the lobby of the
courthouse just moments before the hearing was scheduled to begin. No
appearance can be traced to this setting by either party on the docket (REC.
1551), and once again, no hearing was held, and the case reset for a second
time to February 1, 2024. REC. 186. 18. Kaitcer permitted attorney Dan
Bacalis, Plaintiff’s prior attorney, to fill out the Associate Judge’s Report, and
the parties never went before him as indicated by the case docket’s lack of
appearance on this date by either party. I. Reset #2 – February 1, 2024,
Setting 19. One day prior to the February 1 setting, both attorneys,
Defendant Carter and Dan Bacalis, both amended the petition for divorce
and counterpetition for divorce without the parties’ knowledge. (REC. 189,
REC. 209) These amended documents were similar, submitted on the same
day, and raised concerns for Plaintiff regarding his quality of representation.
20. At the February 1 setting, both parties were in the conference rooms
outside of Defendant Kaitcer’s courtroom, when attorney Bacalis walks in
holding a settlement agreement. When Plaintiff refused this option and
requested that they go have a hearing before the judge. 21. This is when
Bacalis stated, as witness affidavits corroborate, that he “knows this Judge
and this is the best we can get.” and further stated “[w]e’ll be here all day.
We can come back and change it later.” 22. Outraged by this response,
Plaintiff paid very close attention to the settlement offer Bacalis was
pressuring him to sign, and noticed the following provisions: A typed written
Order conforming to this Report will follow within 20 days from the date this
Report is signed. The Temporary Order shall be prepared by DAN BACALIS.
Each attorney should approve the Order. The parties do not need to approve
the Order. The attorney reviewing the proposed Order shall have five (5)
days to do so. There arc no ten (JO) day letters. If an agreement is not
reached, a Motion to Sign shall be filed and set within thirty (30) days from

=== PAGE 5 ===

the signing of this Report. IT IS SO ORDERED (REC. 233) J. Termination of
Counsel and the Emergency Motion 23. With the above provisions in mind,
Plaintiff signed the document and immediately fired his attorney and
provided notice to the court. REC. 221. By doing so, Plaintiff gained access
back to the residency, invalidated the agreement, and was able to use the
time back in the house to run damage control on his business operations
while preparing to expose the Myers-Branthoover enterprise to the court via
a MOTION TO RECONSIDER EVIDENCE AND VACATE TEMPORARY
ORDERS, which was filed on February 9, 2024, within three business days of
the February 1 agreed associate judge’s report being served by the clerk.
REC. 240 24. In this motion, it was specifically stated that: i. “I am seeking
immediate court intervention to correct procedural e rrors and address the
misuse of the legal system by the Petitioner.” REC. 244 ii. “Particularly, Dan
Branthoover became involved. He is the boyfriend of the Petitioner’s Mother.
Shortly thereafter, I received a notice from our joint bank account stating
that $1,576 had just been withdrawn. As our bank statement for December
2023 will demonstrate – the transaction record shows the funds being
transferred directly to Mr. Branthoover’s PayPal account” REC. 245 iii. “The
Petitioner's action of filing for divorce under an Affidavit of Inability to pay
three days after transferring $1,576 to herself starkly contravenes the
mandates set forth in Chapter 10, Section 10.001 of the Civil Practice and
Remedies Code”. REC 247 at B2 iv. “The Petitioner violated Chapter 10,
Section 10.001 a second time within the same document when she
intentionally elected to waive the 60-day waiting period claiming to have an
active protective order against me that found family violence had occurred
during our marriage.” REC 247 at B3. v. “This suit was the second attempt
by the Petitioner to have me removed from the home, which ultimately
succeeded.” REC 248 at D1 25. The motion went on to explain the factual
pattern described up to this point, putting the court on notice of the key
issues with provided exhibits which were duly served on Carter. In response
to Plaintiff’s motion, he received the first of just two email communications
from Carter throughout the case’s history, where she claimed she would be
filing a counter motion when disclosing her availability for the hearing on
Plaintiff’s emergency motion. REC. 2794 No such countermotion was filed
by Carter. K. Summary Judgment and Notice of Hearing 26. By February 22,
no response had been filed by Carter, so Plaintiff filed a Partial Motion for
Summary Judgment. REC. 758. Plaintiff also submitted a proposed parenting
plan as Exhibit D. REC. 769. No response was ever received from Carter. 27.
On February 27, 2024, Defendant Munford signed and issued a notice of
hearing to the parties with the hearing set for March 14, 2024. REC. 776. L.
Plaintiff’s Notice to the Court and Defendant Myers’ Self-Help Remedies 28.
On March 3, 2024, Plaintiff notified the Court that he would not be leaving
the home as it was not in the best interests of his children. REC. 782. 29.
The following day, on March 6, 2024, while walking his daughters to school,
Myers ran inside the family home, and locked him out of the marital
residence, leaving a sign on the door that said “[y]ou should have been out
by Saturday you are now locked out!” REC. 1748. 30. Plaintiff called local
law enforcement to help him regain entry into the home, where mother
produced the agreed associate judge’s report signed on February 1, 2024,
and used it as a means to block Plaintiff’s entrance to the home. 31. To avoid
further conflict, Plaintiff was escorted into the home where he was able to
grab only his computer and a few clothes and went to Flower Mound to

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
temporarily stay with his father until the time of the hearing on his
emergency motion, scheduled for March 14, 2024, at 9:00 A.M. L. The
Hearing On Plaintiff’s Emergency Motion 32. On March 14, 2024, the
parties arrived at the 322nd District Court, and on the way into the
courtroom, defendants Myers and Carter could be seen in the conference
room, quickly shuffling papers back and forth. 33. After checking in with the
bailiff, Plaintiff turned around to see defendant Carter extending to him a
document titled “Temporary Orders” that were the reduced version of the
February 1 associate judge’s report. REC. 888. 34. These orders, which were
not prepared by Dan Bacalis, which were not agreed to by the parties, were
reduced well outside of the 20-day requirement as ordered by the judge, and
which were never filed with the clerk, stated the following
misrepresentations: i. On February 1, 2024, the Court heard Petitioner's
motion for temporary orders. ii. The parties have agreed to the terms of this
order as evidenced by the signatures below. REC. 888. iii. The Court, after
examining the record and the agreement of the parties and hearing the
evidence and argument of counsel, finds that all necessary prerequisites of
the law have been legally satisfied and that the Court has jurisdiction of this
case and of all the parties. REC. 888. iv. The dates that the parties would
have access to the family residence was altered, changing the date Plaintiff
was supposed to leave from March 1, 2024, to March 20, 2024, and
changing Myers’ date of re-entry from March 1, 2024, to March 30, 2024,
leaving a 10-day window where no one would occupy the residence. v. This
modification was made to prevent Myers from being liable for illegally
locking Plaintiff out of the home on March 6, 2024. 35. On the last page of
the orders, Plaintiff’s attorney who was terminated weeks earlier did not
sign the document, and Plaintiff refused to sign the document for the
forthcoming reasons: i. It claimed a hearing occurred on a motion which was
never set for a hearing or served on the Plaintiff and doesn’t exist on the
docket. ii. It was prepared by defendant Carter, not Dan Bacalis. iii. The
associate judge was presiding over a de novo request of his own prior
report. iv. The matrimonial address was incorrect, as it stated “6641 Anns
Court”, rather than 6641 Anne Court. REC. 915, REC. 922 v. The orders
were not in the best interests of the children. vi. Notwithstanding the
Plaintiff’s revocation of consent by filing the emergency motion, the terms
were altered right before they were rendered into effect by defendant
Kaitcer. vii. Plaintiff did not agree to the terms as he was in court that very
day to expose Myers. M. Predicate Acts: Extortion 36. Kaitcer, knowing that
no response was filed, knowing that he was presiding over a hearing to
which he had no subject matter jurisdiction, and knowing that the temporary
orders produced by defendant Carter was served just moments earlier,
signed another associate judge’s report pre-drafted by defendant Carter,
which summarily denied the Plaintiff’s emergency motion, ignored the fact
that Carter had not provided a response, and within the report itself,
Plaintiff was ordered to sign the document that Carter had just presented to
him despite raising objections to its’ contents, and despite his consent not
being present. REC. 795. 37. Finally, defendant Kaitcer refused to consider
Plaintiff’s exhibits, including six affidavits prepared by his business clients
who have been directly affected by his inability to provide the real-time
market data services his clients relied on, who were located throughout the
United States. REC. 851; REC. 854; REC. 857; REC. 860; REC. 863; REC.
867; REC. 870. 38. Following the setting, the orders were rendered into

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
effect without Plaintiff’s signature (REC. 925) , and Plaintiff filed a request
for findings of fact and conclusions of law (REC. 883), and filed and
amended a “Preparatory Notice for Judicial Review” which recounted the
factual timeline up to that point, and included the affidavits that Kaitcer
refused to accept on March 14, 2024. REC. 798, REC. 851, REC. 854, REC.
857, REC. 860, REC. 863, REC. 867, REC. 870. 39. The orders stated they
were to remain in effect until the final decree of divorce, and Plaintiff’s
journey of one-sided appeals began. N. One Sided Appellate Efforts, and
Defective IWO 40. Following the rendition of the temporary orders on March
26, 2024, Plaintiff spent between April 8, 2024 and September 15, 2024,
appealing via mandamus to the Second Court of Appeals and the Texas
Supreme Court. REC. 1010. 41. During the appellate efforts, Carter filed one
of two motions in the case, which was a motion for pre-trial conference filed
on April 24, 2024, on her behalf by Roderick D. Marx, a party not named in
the suit. REC. 1014, REC. 1016. 42. Plaintiff immediately objected to the
pre-trial conference, and no response was ever issued by Carter or the
court. REC. 1018. 43. On April 30th, Plaintiff filed his notice of completion
regarding the parenting course as ordered, despite actively trying to vacate
them. REC. 1047. No parenting course was ever completed by Myers. 44. On
May 2, 2024, Plaintiff’s en banc reconsideration was denied in the Second
Court of Appeals, and he began preparing an appeal to the Supreme Court
of Texas. REC. 1067. 45. On May 19, 2024, Carter sent the second and last
email correspondence that would be received in the case, which falsely
claimed he agreed to the orders signed on March 14, 2024, and requested
that he fill out an IWO, which Plaintiff found to be defective. REC. 1722,
REC. 1728. No further correspondence was received by Carter. O.
Fraudulent Intervention and Branthoover’s Continued Involvement 46. On
June 23rd Plaintiff filed a motion in state court entitled MOTION FOR
JOINDER OF PERSONS NEEDED FOR JUST ADJUDICATION at 12:14 P.M.
REC. 1075. This motion received no response from Carter. 47. On June 23rd
at 1:54 P.M., directly following the submission of the motion, Branthoover
texted Plaintiff stating “Lol. And here comes another denial. Please sue me
individually. Please.”, referring to the earlier filed motion and showing his
continued oversight of the case’s progression since his initial predicate acts.
48. Four days later, on June 28, 2024, the Texas Office of the Attorney
General allegedly filed an intervention pleading, claiming that Plaintiff was
past due on child support, and requested information from Plaintiff. REC.
1099. 49. Most notably, the certificate of service to this intervention
pleading was allegedly signed by Holly Hayes, the designated attorney for
the OAG, yet the name underneath the signature line reads CHOYA
BURKLEY. REC. 1102. 50. Plaintiff promptly objected to the intervention,
and never received any response from the OAG, Carter, or the court. REC.
1106. P. Supreme Court, Rule 12, and Emergency Temporary Orders 51. As
Plaintiff continued to appeal to the Supreme Court of Texas, all prosecution
came to an end in the trial court. It wasn’t until September 15, 2024, that
Plaintiff filed a first amended rehearing motion in the Texas Supreme Court,
(REC. 1136) and after noticing Carter’s lack of participation, he began to
question her authority given several ambiguities surrounding her
representation, and filed a rule 12 motion to show authority. REC. 1170. No
response was ever received to this motion from Carter. 52. At this point,
Plaintiff had been staying in Airbnb homes while he sought relief to ensure
he could remain close to his daughters during this time. On September 26,

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
2024, he filed and later amended an EMERGENCY MOTION FOR
TEMPORARY ORDERS and requested expedited relief by October 1, 2024,
as that was when Plaintiff was forced to move away from the area due to
cost of living being unsustainable. REC. 1184. No response was ever
received from Carter regarding this motion. 53. By October 1, Plaintiff had
no choice but to start pursuing administrative remedies, and thought the
court was biased against him given the case’s history up to that point. He
began to prepare a Joint Motion to Recuse defendants Munford and Kaitcer
and filed it with the clerk of the court on October 7, 2024. REC. 1197. Q.
Predicate Act: Wire Fraud 54. On October 8, 2024, Defendant Munford
signed and forwarded a “Joint Motion to Recuse” attached to his order of
referral to regional presiding judge David L. Evans but was notably missing
the exhibits and affidavit critical to the motion. REC. 1222 55. A copy of this
exchange was sent via defendant Baker on 4:43 P.M. on October 8. REC.
1254 56. Plaintiff immediately pointed out the discrepancies between the
motion filed and the motion forwarded to David L. Evans, where she replied
and admitted that the full document had been e-filed and remains with the
court. REC. 1255 57. Unsatisfied with this response, Plaintiff further pointed
out that the filing size of the document filed and the one referring to David
L. Evans was significantly different. No further correspondence was
received by Baker until the following day. REC. 1256 58. The following day
on October 8, 2024, defendant Munford signed and filed an “Amended Order
of Referral” which had the full motion attached this time, albeit still
modified as the hyperlinks and bookmarks had been removed. REC. 1282 59.
This amended referral was sent via email correspondence by Baker at 11:17
A.M. on October 8, 2024, who stated that due to the size of the motion, it
was split into three parts. REC. 1258. This excuse directly contradicts the
standard filing procedure in Tarrant County, which was raised and
subsequently ignored in an objection. REC. 1269. No response was filed in
regard to the motion to recuse or objection by Carter. R. Recusal Denial and
More Delays, and Federal Removal 60. Justice E. Lee Gabriel was assigned
to hear the motion, which had to be rescheduled due to technical difficulties
for November 7, 2024. REC. 1306. 61. The morning of the hearing, Plaintiff
woke up with a dental emergency, and promptly notified all parties, and
requested a reset for the hearing, which everyone agreed to. REC.
1393-1396. 62. Despite this agreement, the recusal was denied for failure to
appear, and made no mention of the agreement or the emergency. REC.
1398. 63. With no other remedies left, Plaintiff removed the case to Federal
Court on December 2, 2024, which was quickly remanded back on
December 4, 2024. REC. 1426. 64. On December 14, 2024, defendant
Branthoover texted Plaintiff, sending a threat which stated “[w]hen things
all over, you get to deal with me.” at 2:15 P.M. REC. 1720 65. On December
16, 2024, Plaintiff initiated suit against Daniel Kenneth Branthoover in the
Western District of Oklahoma seeking relief in the form of damages from the
ongoing deprivation from his home. REC. 1451. 66. Plaintiff notified the
Texas court of this lawsuit on December 31, 2024. REC. 1446. S. Further
Delays, Motion to Dismiss for Want of Prosecution, and the Original SAPCR
67. On January 24, 2025, Plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss for want of
prosecution due to the total lack of participation in the case by the opposing
party. REC. 1527. No response was ever received from Carter on this
motion. 68. On January 29, 2025, defendant Myers began disposing of
Plaintiff’s personal belongings that remained on the family property. REC.

=== PAGE 9 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
1629-1631. 69. On February 12, 2025, Plaintiff learned that his youngest
daughter was suffering from dental pain due to Myers’ failure to obtain
dental insurance for the children. REC. 3281. 70. By March 14, (REC.
1833-1837) the judges had still not been reinstated from the first recusal,
which lad Plaintiff to reach out to Baker to request a hearing on his
unopposed summary judgment that had been on the docket since February
22, 2024, where he had to remind her to reinstate the judges back into the
case. REC. 1833-1837. 71. Given the delays, and since the case had been
brought in bad faith initially, the Plaintiff opened an original SAPCR suit in
the 233rd District Court of Tarrant County on March 18, 2025, where he
argued for dominant jurisdiction in a cover letter sent to the clerk. REC.
2260. T. Counsel Suddenly Becomes Active 72. The very next day, defendant
Carter filed an original answer filed on her behalf by Roderick Marx. REC.
2279. The motion was a boilerplate motion, and was followed by a motion to
consolidate, which was filed in the wrong court, and was also filed on
Carter’s behalf by RODERICK D. MARX. REC. 2284. 73. The Plaintiff
immediately responded by filing a motion to strike (REC. 1957) a Rule 12
motion to show authority challenging both Carter and RODERICK D MARX’s
authority (REC. 2288) and on March 24, 2025, an emergency ex-parte TRO
to prevent Myers from barring Plaintiff’s access to the home. (REC. 2302)
No responses were ever received from Carter on these motions. 74. On
March 26, 2025, an objection was filed to Carter’s consolidation motion in
the 233rd court. REC. 1881. 75. Plaintiff reached out to the coordinator from
the 233rd and went through the process to present the motion to the judge.
REC. 2338-2341. 76. On March 29, 2025, Plaintiff appeared before Associate
Judge Kate Stone, who refused to hear Plaintiff’s emergency motion despite
no response being filed, and told him to leave the courtroom. The hearing
date scheduled for April 10, 2025, as agreed by Carter and Plaintiff (REC.
2358), was actually un-set by Stone. REC. 2361. 77. The grounds for this
outright refusal was due to Carter calling in a favor from the judge without
even being present in the courtroom, to where Stone left the room, came
back, and told the Plaintiff to leave informing him that a motion to
consolidate would be filed by Carter the following week. U. Five Concurrent
Mandamus Petitions 78. Subsequently, after he was turned away from the
courtroom, Carter’s consolidation motion wasn’t filed until April 4, 2025
(REC. 2367), resulting in two mandamus petitions to try again to have the
March 14, 2024, order signed by Kaitcer vacated, and to compel Kate Stone
to hear the emergency TRO. See 25-0361, 25-0367. 79. On the same day the
mandamus was filed against Stone, District Judge Kenneth Newell sua
sponte granted Carter’s consolidation motion in both courts without a
hearing, and without addressing the emergency situation for the children or
the Plaintiff’s objections, leading to a third mandamus proceeding. REC.
2393, See also 25-0378. 80. On April 23, 2025, a notice of trial setting was
served on the parties by defendant Munford in the midst of all of these
issues. REC. 1773. 81. The same day, Plaintiff filed an objection and
requested an emergency stay. REC. 2219. No response was received to this
objection by either Munford or Carter. 82. Two days later on April 25, 2025,
Plaintiff filed his second recusal motion, and amended it on April 28, 2025,
this time only against Munford, and requested that the rules of procedure be
followed, and objected to the involvement of the court coordinator given the
prior recusal’s ambiguity and significant delays caused by her involvement.
REC. 2488 No response to this motion was ever filed from Carter. 83. Baker

=== PAGE 10 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
continued to be involved in the recusal process, this time erroneously
forwarding an order of referral from defendant Kaitcer, who was not named
in the recusal motion. REC. 2615. 84. Plaintiff immediately objected on April
29, 2025, naming two issues: 1) the coordinator was still involved, and 2) the
order of referral sent by Kaitcer was erroneous. REC. 2620. 84. Plaintiff
objected to the order of assignment of John H. Cayce (REC. 3149) which was
issued on May 7, 2025, due to the unresolves issues. REC. 2620. 85. David L.
Evans overruled this objection on May 15, 2025, leading to mandamus
petition 25-0426, a direct appeal to the Texas Supreme Court. REC. 3507.
86. On May 20, 2025, John H. Cayce summarily denied the recusal, including
the denial of a motion to recuse Kaitcer which was never filed, leading to
mandamus petition 25-0458, a second direct appeal to the Texas Supreme
Court. 87. All five petitions were denied both initially and on rehearing, and
all emergency motions to stay proceedings were dismissed. The only insights
given from the appellate courts was: “Denied, per curiam.” No response was
filed by any implicated judge or opposing counsel. V. Federal RICO Case and
the Push Towards Final Trial 88. In June of 2025, Plaintiff amended his
complaint against Daniel Kenneth Branthoover and enjoined Myers as a
defendant, which they defended pro-se. 89. Plaintiff communicated this
action with the trial court, and no further action was taken in the case until
August of 2025, when defendant Munford sua sponte set the case for final
trial on December 10, 2025. 90. Plaintiff immediately objected to this trial
setting, and moved to recuse Munford for a third time. 91. The court
coordinator continued to be involved in the process, leading to a subsequent
motion to recuse the regional presiding judge, David L. Evans. 92. Plaintiff
now prepares this suit to hold defendants accountable for their collective
actions, and to prevent their common goal from being achieved, which is to
obtain defendant Myers a final decree of divorce. 93. For the forthcoming
reasons, the conduct outlined herein constitutes conduct of an enterprise
through a pattern of racketeering activity, as several predicate acts were
committed, the enterprise shares a common purpose, and Plaintiff has
suffered direct and ongoing injury to business and property as a direct result
of the defendant’s collective predicate acts. RICO The timeline and evidence
provided demonstrate that the Myers-Branthoover group constitutes an
association-in-fact enterprise under RICO, with a common goal to deprive
the Plaintiff of his home and business through a pattern of racketeering
activity—specifically, wire fraud, Travel Act violations, and fraudulent court
filings—causing direct injury to the Plaintiff’s business and property. The
conduct, structure, and continuity among the participants, as well as the use
of interstate communications and travel, satisfy the elements of a RICO
claim in the Tenth Circuit, with the liability of other defendants depending
on their knowledge and intent. A. Summary The Myers-Branthoover
enterprise, as detailed in the factual timeline, meets the Tenth Circuit’s
requirements for a RICO claim by establishing an association-in-fact
enterprise with a defined structure, purpose, and continuity. The group’s
coordinated actions—including interstate transfer of funds, preparation and
submission of fraudulent legal documents, and ongoing manipulation of
court proceedings—constitute a pattern of racketeering activity, with
predicate acts of wire fraud and Travel Act violations that are related and
continuous. Plaintiff’s direct and ongoing injury to his business and property,
including loss of home, business operations, and client relationships, is
proximately caused by the enterprise’s acts. While Myers and Branthoover’s

=== PAGE 11 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
liability is clear, the involvement of other defendants (Munford, Kaitcer,
Carter, and Baker) may be characterized as inadvertent or willing
participation, depending on their knowledge and intent, but the core
elements of a RICO violation are satisfied by the conduct of Myers and
Branthoover as outlined in the enumerated timeline. The additional acts
committed by each defendant, as alleged, furthered the scheme of the
enterprise despite each additional defendant having actual knowledge of the
fraudulent scheme. RICO Statutory Framework The Racketeer Influenced
and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), codified at 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961–1968,
provides a civil cause of action for individuals injured in their business or
property by reason of a pattern of racketeering activity conducted through
an enterprise affecting interstate or foreign commerce. The most commonly
invoked provision, § 1962(c), prohibits any person employed by or associated
with an enterprise from conducting or participating in the conduct of such
enterprise’s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity. Section
1962(d) further prohibits conspiracies to violate any of the substantive RICO
provisions. To establish a civil RICO claim under § 1962(c), a plaintiff must
prove: i. The existence of an enterprise; ii. The enterprise’s engagement in,
or effect on, interstate or foreign commerce; iii. The defendant’s
employment by or association with the enterprise; iv. The defendant’s
participation, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of the enterprise’s affairs;
v. The defendant’s participation through a pattern of racketeering activity or
collection of unlawful debt. See 100 Mount Holly Bypass v. Axos Bank, Case
No. 2:20-CV-856-TS-CMR (D. Utah Jul 27, 2021). B. Predicate Acts and
Pattern Requirement RICO defines “racketeering activity” to include a wide
range of criminal offenses, including wire fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343) and
violations of the Travel Act (18 U.S.C. § 1952). A “pattern of racketeering
activity” requires at least two predicate acts within a ten-year period, but
the acts must be related and amount to or pose a threat of continued
criminal activity. The Supreme Court has clarified that a RICO violation
requires both an “enterprise” and a “pattern of racketeering activity,” with
the enterprise being a group of persons associated for a common purpose,
and the pattern involving a series of criminal acts (United States v. Harris,
695 F.3d 1125 (10th Cir. 2012)). The Tenth Circuit has further explained
that, to establish a pattern, it is not enough to simply show that two
predicate acts occurred within ten years; the acts must also be related and
pose a threat of continued criminal activity (U.S. v. Smith, 413 F.3d 1253
(10th Cir. 2005)). Note, however, that U.S. v. Smith has been stated as
overruled by United States v. Nissen, 555 F.Supp.3d 1174 (D. N.M. 2021) on
unrelated grounds, but its articulation of the pattern requirement remains
consistent with current law. C. Enterprise and Association-in-Fact An
“enterprise” under RICO includes any individual, partnership, corporation,
association, or group of individuals associated in fact, even if not a legal
entity. For an association-in-fact enterprise, the Tenth Circuit requires: i. A
purpose; ii. Relationships among those associated with the enterprise; iii.
Longevity sufficient to permit the associates to pursue the enterprise’s
purpose; iv. A decision-making framework or mechanism for controlling the
group; v. Functioning as a continuing unit; vi. Existence separate and apart
from the pattern of racketeering activity. See 100 Mount Holly Bypass. D.
Conspiracy Section 1962(d) makes it unlawful to conspire to violate any of
the substantive RICO provisions. A RICO conspiracy does not require the
establishment of an enterprise but requires that a defendant adopts the goal

=== PAGE 12 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
of furthering or facilitating a criminal endeavor that would satisfy the
elements of a substantive RICO offense (United States v. Martinez, 543
F.Supp.3d 1209 (D. N.M. 2021); United States v. Randall, 661 F.3d 1291
(10th Cir. 2011)). E. Injury Requirement RICO provides a private right of
action for individuals injured in their business or property through
fraudulent conduct, and there is no requirement that the conduct be
connected to organized crime in a civil setting (Plains Resources, Inc. v.
Gable, 782 F.2d 883 (10th Cir. 1986)). ANALYSIS F. Existence of an
Association-in-Fact Enterprise The timeline establishes that Myers and
Branthoover formed an association-in-fact enterprise beginning in December
2023 (¶¶ 1–7, 93). Their collaboration was structured, with Myers as the
petitioner in the divorce and Branthoover as the planner, drafter, and
facilitator of fraudulent documents and financial transactions. The group
had a clear purpose: to divest the Plaintiff of his home and business through
fraudulent legal filings and manipulation of court processes (¶¶ 1–7, 93).
The enterprise’s structure is evidenced by: i. The initial planning and
agreement to meet in Yukon, Oklahoma, to draft fraudulent documents (¶¶
1–3); ii. The use of interstate communications and travel to further the
scheme (¶¶ 2–3); iii. Ongoing coordination and adaptation to changing
circumstances, including the preparation and submission of false affidavits
and pleadings, and manipulation of court proceedings (¶¶ 5–7, 34, 93). This
satisfies the Tenth Circuit’s requirements for an association-in-fact
enterprise, which does not require a formal legal entity but does require a
common purpose, relationships, and sufficient longevity to pursue the
enterprise’s goals. G. Structure, Purpose, Relationships, and Continuity The
Myers-Branthoover group meets the requirements for an association-in-fact
enterprise: i. Purpose: The shared goal was to deprive the Plaintiff of his
home, business, and property interests through fraudulent means (¶¶ 1–7,
93). ii. Relationships: Myers and Branthoover maintained ongoing
communications, coordinated actions, and divided roles in the scheme (¶¶ 1–
7, 93). iii. Longevity and Continuity: The enterprise operated over a
substantial period, from at least December 2023 through present day 2025,
with multiple related acts and ongoing adaptation to changing
circumstances (¶¶ 1–93). iv. Decision-Making Framework: The group
planned, agreed on steps, and executed those steps in a coordinated manner
(¶¶ 1–7, 93). v. Existence Separate from Predicate Acts: The enterprise was
formed for the purpose of achieving a specific goal and engaged in multiple
acts over time to accomplish that goal. H. Predicate Acts: Wire Fraud, Travel
Act Violations, and Fraudulent Filings The timeline identifies multiple
predicate acts that qualify as racketeering activity under RICO: i. Wire
Fraud: Myers transferred $1,576 in marital funds to Branthoover’s PayPal
account during interstate travel, and these funds were used to purchase a
phone for use in the fraudulent scheme (¶¶ 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 34). The use of
electronic communications (text messages, emails) to plan and execute the
scheme further supports the wire fraud allegation (¶¶ 1–7, 34). ii. Travel Act
Violations: Myers traveled from Texas to Oklahoma to meet with
Branthoover, where they planned and prepared fraudulent legal documents,
which were then transported back to Texas and submitted to the court (¶¶ 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, 7). iii. Fraudulent Filings: The preparation and submission of false
affidavits and pleadings to the court, containing material misrepresentations
about financial status, family violence, and property ownership, constitute
further predicate acts (¶¶ 5, 6, 7, 34). At least two related predicate acts

=== PAGE 13 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
within ten years are required (U.S. v. Smith, 413 F.3d 1253 (10th Cir. 2005)),
and the timeline shows multiple, related predicate acts over a substantial
period (¶¶ 1–93). I. Pattern of Racketeering Activity: Relatedness and
Continuity The predicate acts were not isolated incidents but part of an
ongoing scheme. The acts were related in that they all aimed to deprive the
Plaintiff of his property and business, and they posed a threat of continued
criminal activity, as the enterprise continued to operate and adapt its tactics
over time (¶¶ 1–93). The timeline shows that the enterprise’s activities
extended over a substantial period, with multiple acts occurring over
months and involving ongoing coordination and adaptation to changing
circumstances. J. Injury to Business or Property Plaintiff suffered direct and
ongoing injury to his business and property as a result of the enterprise’s
actions. He was deprived of his home and business operations, lost access to
marital funds, and was unable to provide services to clients, resulting in
financial harm (¶¶ 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 37). These injuries are precisely the type
of harm RICO is designed to redress. Plains Resources, Inc. v. Gable, 782 F.
2d 883 (10th Cir. 1986)). K. Participation of Other Defendants: Inadvertent
or Willing The timeline raises the question of whether Munford, Kaitcer,
Carter, and Baker were victims of the initial scheme or willing participants
in the expanded enterprise. The evidence suggests that, at a minimum,
Myers and Branthoover were the core members of the enterprise, with
others potentially becoming involved through their actions in the legal
proceedings (¶¶ 14–93). i. Inadvertent Participation: Some defendants may
have participated inadvertently, such as by issuing orders or facilitating
court processes without knowledge of the underlying scheme (¶¶ 14–93). ii.
Willing Participation: Others may have become willing participants if they
knowingly furthered the enterprise’s objectives or ignored clear evidence of
fraud and misrepresentation (¶¶ 14–93). RICO does not impose liability for
inadvertent or unwitting participation; there must be knowing and willful
involvement in the conduct of the enterprise’s affairs. For the forthcoming
reasons, Plaintiff alleges that the Defendants are willing participants in the
scheme. VICTIM OR PARTICIPANT RICO liability extends to those who
knowingly participate in the conduct of the enterprise’s affairs, even if they
were not original members (RICO: A Primer (2022-01-31)). The timeline
raises the question of whether Munford, Kaitcer, Carter, and Baker were
victims of the initial scheme or willing participants in the expanded
enterprise. The evidence suggests that, at a minimum, Myers and
Branthoover were the core members of the enterprise, with others becoming
involved through their actions in the legal proceedings (¶¶ 14–93). The
timeline demonstrates that Carter, Kaitcer, and Myers engaged in extortion
by leveraging the threat of adverse legal action, fraudulent court orders, and
the manipulation of judicial process to coerce Plaintiff into relinquishing
property and business interests, satisfying the elements of extortion as a
predicate act under RICO and the Travel Act. Munford and Baker, for their
part, committed wire fraud by intentionally sending altered or incomplete
court documents via interstate email, with the intent to mislead, obstruct
relief, and further the enterprise’s objective of finalizing the divorce and
depriving Plaintiff of his property, thus meeting the requirements for wire
fraud as a RICO predicate act. These acts, as detailed in the timeline, are
not isolated but part of a coordinated pattern of racketeering activity within
an association-in-fact enterprise, as required by RICO in the Tenth Circuit.
The conduct of each defendant is tied to specific predicate acts—extortion

=== PAGE 14 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
for Carter, Kaitcer, and Myers (notably at timeline events 33–37), and wire
fraud for Munford and Baker (notably at events 54–59, 83)—demonstrating
knowing and willful participation in the enterprise’s broader scheme to
deprive Plaintiff of his home and business through fraudulent and coercive
means. A. Extortion and Wire Fraud The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961–1968, provides a civil cause of
action for injury to business or property caused by a pattern of racketeering
activity conducted through an enterprise affecting interstate commerce.
Predicate acts under RICO include extortion (as defined by the Hobbs Act
and the Travel Act) and wire fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343), among others.
Extortion is defined as obtaining property from another, with his consent,
induced by wrongful use of actual or threatened force, violence, or fear, or
under color of official right. The Travel Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1952, includes
extortion as an “unlawful activity” and does not require it to be part of a
business enterprise (U.S. v. Welch, 327 F.3d 1081 (10th Cir. 2003)). The
Tenth Circuit recognizes that extortion under the Travel Act can be
established by showing threats or coercion to obtain something of value,
including property or legal rights, in violation of state or federal law. Wire
fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343 requires (1) a scheme to defraud or obtain
property by false or fraudulent pretenses, (2) intent to defraud, and (3) use
of interstate wire communications to execute the scheme (Clinton v. Sec.
Benefit Life Ins. Co., 63 F.4th 1264 (10th Cir. 2023); United States v.
Holloway, 826 F.3d 1237 (10th Cir. 2016)). The Tenth Circuit requires that
the deprivation of property be a central object of the scheme, and that the
use of wires (including email) be knowing and in furtherance of the
fraudulent scheme (United States v. Tao, 629 F.Supp.3d 1083). B. Extortion
by Carter, Kaitcer, and Myers Extortion, as a RICO predicate act, is defined
broadly under federal law and the Travel Act. It includes obtaining property
or rights through threats, coercion, or misuse of official process (U.S. v.
Welch, 327 F.3d 1081 (10th Cir. 2003)). The Tenth Circuit does not require
extortion to be part of a business enterprise for Travel Act purposes; a single
act suffices if it has the requisite interstate nexus. The timeline shows the
following: i. Event 33–34: Carter, with Myers, prepared and presented
“Temporary Orders” that misrepresented facts (e.g., that Plaintiff agreed to
terms he did not, that a hearing occurred when it did not, and that the
orders were in the best interests of the children). These orders altered the
dates of access to the home to shield Myers from liability for locking Plaintiff
out, and were presented to Plaintiff in a context where he was under threat
of losing his home and business. iii. Event 36: Kaitcer, knowing the orders
were disputed and that no response had been filed, signed an associate
judge’s report pre-drafted by Carter, summarily denying Plaintiff’s
emergency motion and ordering Plaintiff to sign the disputed document,
despite his objections and lack of consent. iv. Event 35: Plaintiff refused to
sign the orders for multiple reasons, including their fraudulent content and
the lack of due process, but the orders were rendered into effect without his
signature. These acts collectively demonstrate the use of legal process and
the threat of adverse judicial action to coerce Plaintiff into surrendering his
property and business interests. The manipulation of court orders, the
misrepresentation of facts, and the pressure to sign under threat of losing
his home constitute extortion under the Travel Act and RICO (U.S. v. Welch,
327 F.3d 1081 (10th Cir. 2003). Myers’s role is clear: she was the beneficiary
and instigator of the fraudulent filings and the manipulation of court

=== PAGE 15 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
process, using the threat of legal action and the actual deprivation of
Plaintiff’s property to achieve her goal. Carter and Kaitcer acted in concert
with Myers, knowingly facilitating the extortion by preparing, presenting,
and enforcing fraudulent orders, and by using the authority of the court to
coerce Plaintiff. The fact that Plaintiff was ordered to sign a document he
objected to, under threat of continued deprivation of his home and business,
is classic extortion by color of official right. All three defendants knew that
Plaintiff did not agree to the order, as he had just fired his attorney to
challenge any basis for an agreement. This implies that despite the motion
being served on all defendants, they chose to ignore the allegations of a
fraudulent scheme and further the affairs of the enterprise. These actions
meet the requirements for extortion as a RICO predicate act: they involved
the wrongful use of threats and official process to obtain property (the home
and business) from Plaintiff, with his consent induced by fear of further loss
or legal harm. The acts were not isolated but part of a coordinated scheme
to achieve the enterprise’s goal of finalizing the divorce and divesting
Plaintiff of his property B. Wire Fraud by Munford and Baker Wire fraud
under 18 U.S.C. § 1343 requires a scheme to defraud, intent to defraud, and
use of interstate wire communications to execute the scheme (Clinton v. Sec.
Benefit Life Ins. Co., 63 F.4th 1264 (10th Cir. 2023); United States v.
Holloway, 826 F.3d 1237 (10th Cir. 2016)). The Tenth Circuit recognizes that
sending altered or incomplete court documents via email, with the intent to
mislead or deprive someone of property or rights, can constitute wire fraud
if the deprivation of property is a central object of the scheme (United
States v. Tao, 629 F.Supp.3d 1083). The timeline shows the following: i.
Event 54: Munford signed and forwarded a “Joint Motion to Recuse”
attached to his order of referral, but the document was missing critical
exhibits and affidavits necessary for Plaintiff’s relief. ii. Event 55: Baker sent
a copy of this incomplete filing via email, representing it as the full
document. iii. Event 56–57: When Plaintiff pointed out the discrepancies,
Baker provided inconsistent explanations, first claiming the full document
was e-filed, then later stating it was split into three parts due to size. iv.
Event 58: Munford signed and filed an “Amended Order of Referral” with the
full motion attached, but with hyperlinks and bookmarks removed, further
impairing the document’s integrity. v. Event 59, 83: Baker continued to
forward altered or incomplete orders and referrals, even when procedural
irregularities were raised. These acts involved the knowing use of interstate
email to transmit altered or incomplete court documents, with the intent to
prevent Plaintiff from obtaining relief and to further the enterprise’s goal of
finalizing the divorce and depriving Plaintiff of his property. The use of email
to transmit these documents satisfies the interstate wire requirement, and
the intent to defraud is evidenced by the deliberate alteration and
misrepresentation of the filings. The conduct of Munford and Baker meets
the elements of wire fraud: (1) a scheme to defraud Plaintiff of property and
rights, (2) intent to defraud by preventing relief and misleading the court
and Plaintiff, and (3) use of interstate wire communications (email) to
execute the scheme (Clinton v. Sec. Benefit Life Ins. Co., 63 F.4th 1264 (10th
Cir. 2023)). The deprivation of property (Plaintiff’s home and business) was
a central object of the scheme, not a minor part. RELATIONSHIP AND
CONTINUITY All these acts—extortion by Carter, Kaitcer, and Myers, and
wire fraud by Munford and Baker—were committed in furtherance of the
Myers-Branthoover enterprise’s overarching objective: to finalize the

=== PAGE 16 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
divorce and divest Plaintiff of his home and business. The acts were
coordinated, continuous, and related, satisfying the RICO pattern
requirement. The timeline shows that each defendant’s conduct was not an
isolated error or routine administrative act, but part of a deliberate scheme
to use the legal process, threats, and fraudulent communications to achieve
the enterprise’s unlawful goals. DAMAGES The harm inflicted upon Plaintiff
is staggering. He has lost the home in which he lived for nearly a third of his
life, the companionship of his spouse, and the society of his children. His
income has collapsed. For two years he has been consigned to a futile
appellate gauntlet, even as Defendants Munford, Kaitcer, Baker, and Carter
have repeatedly exceeded the bounds of their lawful authority in furtherance
of a broader scheme. What began as a concerted effort by Myers and
Branthoover to dispossess Plaintiff of his residence and property
metastasized into a calculated plan to procure a final decree of divorce once
the initial objective had been achieved. The objective was plain: by
engineering a final decree, Defendants would not only hobble Plaintiff’s
ability to bring this suit but also invite invocation of the Rooker–Feldman
doctrine and related abstention principles to preclude federal jurisdiction.
Now, after two years of unremitting effort, Plaintiff seeks the only
meaningful remedy remaining: federal redress to halt the ongoing abuses of
authority, to unwind tainted actions, and to compensate him fully for the
catastrophic losses Defendants have wrought. Take each piece in the TABLE
OF CONTENTS, research the topic, and tie it to the factual timeline, filling
out each element of the RICO complaint and tie each element to the factual
allegations by enumerated paragraph number. What are the legal
requirements for identifying and pleading the parties in a civil RICO
complaint in the Fifth Circuit, including the standards for alleging individual
and enterprise liability?
Answer (Fifth Circuit)
Short response
To properly plead the parties in a civil RICO complaint in the Fifth Circuit, a
plaintiff must specifically identify each defendant as a RICO "person,"
describe the distinct "enterprise" (which may be a legal entity or an
association-in-fact), and allege with particularity each defendant’s role and
conduct in the enterprise’s affairs, ensuring the person and enterprise are
not the same entity. The complaint must set out detailed, non-conclusory
facts showing how each defendant participated in a pattern of racketeering
activity connected to the enterprise, and must avoid lumping defendants
together or relying on mere conclusory allegations.
Summary
In the Fifth Circuit, civil RICO complaints are subject to strict pleading
requirements: the plaintiff must allege with specificity the identity and role
of each defendant (the "person"), the structure and nature of the
"enterprise," and the connection between the defendants’ conduct and the
enterprise’s affairs. The enterprise must be distinct from the RICO person,

=== PAGE 17 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
and if the enterprise is an association-in-fact, the complaint must detail its
purpose, structure, relationships, and continuity, as well as each defendant’s
participation in the enterprise’s direction or conduct.
The complaint must also allege at least two related predicate acts of
racketeering activity by each defendant, with sufficient detail to satisfy Rule
9(b) for fraud-based predicates, and must show that these acts form a
pattern that threatens continued criminal activity. The plaintiff cannot
simply group defendants together or make conclusory statements; instead,
the complaint must provide specific factual allegations as to each party’s
involvement, ensuring that both individual and enterprise liability are
properly and distinctly pleaded.
Background and Relevant Law
Legislative and Regulatory Framework
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), codified at
18 U.S.C. §§ 1961–1968, provides a civil cause of action for persons injured
in their business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962. Section
1962(c), the most commonly invoked provision, prohibits any person
employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in interstate or
foreign commerce from conducting or participating in the conduct of such
enterprise’s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity. The statute
defines a "person" as any individual or entity capable of holding a legal or
beneficial interest in property, and an "enterprise" as any individual,
partnership, corporation, association, or group of individuals associated in
fact, even if not a legal entity (18 U.S.C. § 1961(3)-(4); RICO: A Primer
(2022-01-31)).
Case Law
The Fifth Circuit has consistently held that to state a civil RICO claim, a
plaintiff must allege: (1) a person who engages in (2) a pattern of
racketeering activity (3) connected to the acquisition, establishment,
conduct, or control of an enterprise (Abraham v. Singh, 480 F.3d 351, 355
(5th Cir. 2007); St. Paul Mercury Ins v. Williamson, 224 F.3d 425, 440 (5th
Cir. 2000); Gordon v. Neugebauer, 57 F.Supp.3d 766, 779 (N.D. Tex. 2014)).
The "person" and the "enterprise" must be distinct entities (Whelan v.
Winchester Production Co., 319 F.3d 225, 229 (5th Cir. 2003); Abraham v.
Singh, 480 F.3d at 357). An enterprise may be a legal entity or an
association-in-fact, but if the latter, the complaint must allege facts showing
the enterprise has a purpose, relationships among those associated, and
sufficient longevity to pursue its purpose (Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S.
938, 946 (2009); St. Paul Mercury Ins v. Williamson, 224 F.3d at 440).
Pleading a pattern of racketeering activity requires at least two predicate
acts that are related and pose a threat of continued criminal activity (United
Healthcare Sevices, Inc. v. Next Health, LLC, NO. 3:17-CV-00243-E-BT (N.D.
Tex. Feb 26, 2021); Brown v. Protective Life Ins. Co., 353 F.3d 405, 407 (5th
Cir. 2003)). Predicate acts must be pleaded with particularity under Rule

=== PAGE 18 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
9(b) if they are based on fraud, such as wire or mail fraud (Oblio Telecom,
Inc. v. Patel, 711 F.Supp.2d 668 (N.D. Tex. 2008); Tel-Phonic Services, Inc. v.
TBS Intern., Inc., 975 F.2d 1134 (5th Cir. 1992), superseded on other
grounds by Benchmark Electronics, Inc. v. J.M. Huber Corp., 343 F.3d 719
(5th Cir. 2003)).
The Fifth Circuit also requires that the complaint not lump defendants
together or rely on conclusory allegations; instead, it must plead specific
facts as to each defendant’s role in the enterprise and the racketeering
activity (Rodriguez v. Meta Platforms, Inc. (2025-04-09); Elliott v. Foufas,
867 F.2d 877, 881 (5th Cir. 1989)). For RICO conspiracy claims under §
1962(d), the plaintiff must allege that two or more persons agreed to commit
a substantive RICO offense and that each defendant knew of and agreed to
the overall objective (Chaney v. Dreyfus Service Corp., 595 F.3d 219, 239
(5th Cir. 2010)).
Analysis
I. JURISDICTION AND VENUE
A civil RICO action may be brought in federal court if the alleged
enterprise’s activities affect interstate or foreign commerce (18 U.S.C. §
1962(c)). The complaint must allege facts showing the enterprise’s
connection to interstate commerce, which is typically satisfied if the
predicate acts (such as wire fraud or interstate travel) cross state lines or
involve interstate communications (Maiden Biosciences, Inc. v. Document
Sec. Sys. (2021-08-09)). In the factual timeline, the transfer of funds from
Texas to Oklahoma and the use of interstate wire communications (e.g.,
PayPal, text messages, emails) are sufficient to establish this element (see
Timeline ¶¶ 2–3, 5, 54–59).
II. PARTIES
The complaint must specifically identify each defendant as a RICO "person,"
meaning an individual or entity capable of holding a legal or beneficial
interest in property (18 U.S.C. § 1961(3); RICO: A Primer (2022-01-31)).
Each defendant’s role must be described with particularity, including their
relationship to the enterprise and their participation in the alleged
racketeering activity (Rodriguez v. Meta Platforms, Inc. (2025-04-09)). The
complaint must avoid group pleading and instead set out the specific
conduct of each defendant (Elliott v. Foufas, 867 F.2d at 881).
In the timeline, the parties include Morgan Michelle Myers, Daniel Kenneth
Branthoover, James Munford, Jeffrey Kaitcer, Cooper Carter, and Baker. The
complaint must allege, for each, their status as a RICO person and their
distinctness from the enterprise (see Timeline ¶¶ 1, 14, 16, 17, 54, 55).
III. RECORD REFERENCES
The Fifth Circuit permits courts to take judicial notice of public records,
including state court filings, when their authenticity is not reasonably

=== PAGE 19 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
disputed (Miller v. Dunn, 35 F.4th 1007 (5th Cir. 2022); LUV N' Care, Ltd. v.
Jackel Int'l Ltd., 502 F.Supp.3d 1106 (W.D. La. 2020)). The complaint may
incorporate such records by reference, provided they are properly identified
and served on all parties.
IV. INTRODUCTION
The introduction should set out the nature of the RICO claim, the parties,
the enterprise, and a summary of the alleged racketeering activity. It should
preview the specific roles of each defendant and the harm suffered by the
plaintiff, as well as the connection to interstate commerce.
V. FACTUAL TIMELINE
The factual timeline must provide detailed, non-conclusory allegations as to
each defendant’s conduct, the structure and purpose of the enterprise, and
the predicate acts of racketeering. Each event should be tied to a specific
defendant and to the overall scheme, with references to supporting evidence
(e.g., REC. [page]).
A. The Myers-Branthoover Enterprise
The complaint must allege that Myers and Branthoover formed an
association-in-fact enterprise with a common purpose (to divest Plaintiff of
his home and business), ongoing organization (planning, drafting, and
submitting fraudulent documents), and continuity (actions spanning from
December 2023 through 2025) (Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. at 946; St.
Paul Mercury Ins v. Williamson, 224 F.3d at 440). The enterprise must be
distinct from the pattern of racketeering activity and from the RICO persons
(Whelan v. Winchester Production Co., 319 F.3d at 229).
B. Interstate Travel and Transfer
Allegations of interstate travel and transfer of funds (e.g., Myers traveling
from Texas to Oklahoma, transferring marital funds to Branthoover’s PayPal)
support both the enterprise’s connection to interstate commerce and the
commission of predicate acts (wire fraud, Travel Act violations) (Bustos v.
Invierte En Tex. (2024-06-03)).
C. Admissions
Specific admissions by defendants (e.g., Branthoover’s acknowledgment of
the transfer and purpose) must be pleaded with particularity to show
knowing participation in the enterprise’s affairs (Rodriguez v. Meta
Platforms, Inc. (2025-04-09)).
D. Post-submission Collaboration
Ongoing collaboration after the initial predicate acts (e.g., Branthoover
holding himself out as Myers’ attorney, continued communication)

=== PAGE 20 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
demonstrates the enterprise’s continuity and the defendants’ roles as a
continuing unit (Allstate Ins. Co. v. Benhamou, 190 F.Supp.3d 631 (S.D. Tex.
2016)).
E. Significant and Intentional Misrepresentations
Allegations of fraudulent court filings and misrepresentations must be
pleaded with specificity, identifying the false statements, the speaker, and
the context (Oblio Telecom, Inc. v. Patel, 711 F.Supp.2d at 678).
F. Evidence to the Contrary
The complaint should include factual allegations and evidence contradicting
the defendants’ misrepresentations, further supporting the claim of
fraudulent intent and racketeering activity.
G–V. Subsequent Events
Each subsequent event (e.g., court hearings, resets, motions, orders,
communications) must be tied to the roles and conduct of the defendants,
showing how each participated in the enterprise’s affairs and furthered the
pattern of racketeering activity. The complaint must detail the structure,
decision-making, and continuity of the enterprise, as well as the specific
predicate acts committed by each defendant.
VI. THE RICO ENTERPRISE
A. Structure and Membership
The complaint must describe the enterprise’s structure, purpose, roles, and
function, naming the individuals or entities involved and explaining their
relationships and decision-making framework (Chapter 7. Pleading and
Practice Issues; Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. at 946).
B. Expansion, Purpose, and Continuity
The enterprise’s purpose (e.g., to deprive Plaintiff of property), its expansion
(e.g., involvement of additional defendants), and its continuity (e.g., ongoing
acts over time) must be specifically alleged (St. Paul Mercury Ins v.
Williamson, 224 F.3d at 440).
C. Decision-Making and Functioning as a Unit
The complaint must explain how the enterprise functioned as a continuing
unit, including its decision-making structure (hierarchical or consensual)
and the roles of each defendant (Elliott v. Foufas, 867 F.2d at 881).

=== PAGE 21 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
VII. PREDICATE ACTS
A. Wire Fraud
Allegations of wire fraud must specify the scheme to defraud, the use of
interstate wires, the intent to defraud, and the resulting injury (Bustos v.
Invierte En Tex. (2024-06-03); Oblio Telecom, Inc. v. Patel, 711 F.Supp.2d at
678).
B. Travel Act Violation
Allegations of Travel Act violations must specify the use of interstate travel
or facilities to further unlawful activity (e.g., extortion, fraud) (Bustos v.
Invierte En Tex. (2024-06-03)).
C. Extortion
Allegations of extortion must detail the wrongful use of threats or official
process to obtain property or rights from the plaintiff (Amuneke-Nze v. Crain
(2023-08-17)).
D. Fraudulent Court Filings
Fraudulent court filings as predicate acts must be pleaded with particularity,
identifying the false statements, the responsible defendant, and the context
(Oblio Telecom, Inc. v. Patel, 711 F.Supp.2d at 678).
E. Relatedness and Continuity
The complaint must show that the predicate acts are related (i.e., have
similar purposes, results, participants, or methods) and pose a threat of
continued criminal activity (United Healthcare Sevices, Inc. v. Next Health,
LLC, NO. 3:17-CV-00243-E-BT (N.D. Tex. Feb 26, 2021)).
VIII. RICO CONSPIRACY
To plead a RICO conspiracy under § 1962(d), the complaint must allege that
two or more persons agreed to commit a substantive RICO offense and that
each defendant knew of and agreed to the overall objective (Chaney v.
Dreyfus Service Corp., 595 F.3d at 239). Mere association or presence is
insufficient.
IX. POTENTIAL DEFENSES
Defendants may raise defenses such as preclusion, the Rooker-Feldman
doctrine, Younger abstention, judicial immunity, or other affirmative
defenses. The complaint should anticipate and address these where possible.

=== PAGE 22 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
X. STATE LAW CLAIMS
The complaint may also plead state law claims (e.g., fraud, abuse of process,
intentional infliction of emotional distress) based on the same factual
allegations, but must clearly distinguish these from the RICO claims.
XI. CLAIMS FOR RELIEF
The complaint must specify the relief sought, including compensatory,
treble, and punitive damages, as well as injunctive and declaratory relief, as
authorized by RICO (18 U.S.C. § 1964(c)).
XII. DAMAGES
The plaintiff must allege injury to business or property proximately caused
by the RICO violation, with sufficient detail to show standing (United
Healthcare Sevices, Inc. v. Next Health, LLC, NO. 3:17-CV-00243-E-BT (N.D.
Tex. Feb 26, 2021)).
XIII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF
The prayer for relief should request all appropriate remedies, including
damages and equitable relief.
Exceptions and Caveats
The RICO person and enterprise must be distinct; a single entity cannot
be both (Whelan v. Winchester Production Co., 319 F.3d at 229).
Predicate acts based on fraud must be pleaded with particularity under
Rule 9(b) (Oblio Telecom, Inc. v. Patel, 711 F.Supp.2d at 678).
The complaint must avoid group pleading and conclusory allegations
(Rodriguez v. Meta Platforms, Inc. (2025-04-09)).
If a cited case has been superseded (e.g., Tel-Phonic Services, Inc. v.
TBS Intern., Inc., 975 F.2d 1134 (5th Cir. 1992)), rely on the current
standard as clarified by subsequent authority (Benchmark Electronics,
Inc. v. J.M. Huber Corp., 343 F.3d 719 (5th Cir. 2003)).
Conclusion
To properly plead the parties in a civil RICO complaint in the Fifth Circuit,
the plaintiff must specifically identify each defendant as a RICO person,
describe the distinct enterprise (legal entity or association-in-fact), and
allege with particularity each defendant’s role and conduct in the
enterprise’s affairs. The complaint must set out detailed, non-conclusory
facts showing how each defendant participated in a pattern of racketeering
activity connected to the enterprise, ensuring the person and enterprise are
not the same entity, and must avoid lumping defendants together or relying
on mere conclusory allegations. This approach, grounded in the statutory
text and controlling Fifth Circuit authority, is essential to withstand a motion

to dismiss and to properly allege both individual and enterprise liability
under RICO.
Legal Authorities
David v. Signal Int'l, LLC, CIVIL ACTION No. 08-1220 SECTION "E", CIVIL
ACTION No. 12-557 SECTION "E", CIVIL ACTION No. 13-6218 SECTION
"E" (E.D. La. Jan 09, 2015)
U.S. District Court — Eastern District of Louisiana
Extract
18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) prohibits 'any person employed by or associated with any
enterprise' from 'participat[ing]... in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs
through a pattern of racketeering activity....' Under this subsection, the Fifth
Circuit requires the RICO 'person' be distinct from the RICO 'enterprise.'
The RICO person(s) is the named defendant(s), while the RICO enterprise
can be either a legal entity or an association-in-fact. The seminal Fifth
Circuit case regarding the RICO person-RICO entity distinction is St. Paul
Mercury Insurance Co. v. Williamson. The plaintiff in St Paul filed a civil
RICO suit against three individuals who allegedly comprised an association-
in-fact enterprise. Summarizing its prior case law, the Fifth Circuit
distinguished between corporate entities and individuals: where a single
entity is named as both a RICO defendant and a RICO enterprise, the
person-entity distinction is violated. There is no violation, however, 'when
individuals have been named as defendants and as members of an
association-in-fact RICO enterprise.' Applying this rule to the case before it,
the court vacated the district's court dismissal of the plaintiff's Section
1962(c) claim.
Summary
The Fifth Circuit requires a clear distinction between the RICO "person" and
the RICO "enterprise" in a civil RICO complaint. The RICO person is the
named defendant, while the RICO enterprise can be a legal entity or an
association-in-fact. The court in St. Paul Mercury Insurance Co. v.
Williamson clarified that a single entity cannot be both a RICO defendant
and a RICO enterprise, but individuals can be named as defendants and as
part of an association-in-fact enterprise. This distinction is crucial for
properly pleading a civil RICO claim in the Fifth Circuit.

Extract
A RICO 'enterprise' includes any individual, partnership, corporation,
association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals
associated in fact although not a legal entity. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4). A RICO
enterprise must be distinct from the defendant serving as the RICO person.
Atkinson v. Anadarko Bank and Trust Co., 808 F.2d 438, 439 (5th Cir. 1987).
Under § 1962(c), no RICO enterprise exists where a subsidiary merely acts
on behalf of, or to the benefit of, its parent.
Summary
In the Fifth Circuit, a RICO enterprise can be any legal entity or group of
individuals associated in fact, but it must be distinct from the defendant
serving as the RICO person. This means that the enterprise cannot simply be
a subsidiary acting on behalf of its parent company. This distinction is
crucial for pleading a RICO claim, as it ensures that the enterprise is a
separate entity from the individuals or entities accused of conducting its
affairs through racketeering activity.

NO. 4:09-cv-2556 (S.D. Tex. Nov 03, 2011)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of Texas
Extract
All subsections of RICO 'have three common elements: '1) a person who
engages in 2) a pattern of racketeering activity, 3) connected to the
acquisition, establishment, conduct, or control of an enterprise.' Real Estate
Innovations, Inc. v. Houston Ass'n of Realtors, 422 Fed.Appx. 344, 350 (5th
Cir. 2011) (quoting Crowe v. Henry, 43 F.3d 198, 204 (5th Cir. 1995)
(quotation marks and citation omitted)). Thus to survive a motion to dismiss
its RICO claims, a plaintiff must plead facts that show a pattern of
racketeering activity.
Summary
General framework for pleading RICO claims in the Fifth Circuit.
St. Paul Mercury Ins v. Williamson, 224 F.3d 425 (5th Cir. 2000)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
Of the three elements required of any RICO claim, the district court noted
that the Williamsons in their summary judgment motion had not challenged

=== PAGE 25 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
whether St. Paul had asserted and/or provided evidence of a RICO person or
a RICO enterprise. A RICO person is the defendant, while a RICO enterprise
can be either a legal entity or an association-in-fact. See Crowe v. Henry, 43
F.3d 198, 204 (5th Cir. 1995). If the alleged enterprise is an association-in-
fact, the plaintiff must show evidence of an ongoing organization, formal or
informal, that functions as a continuing unit over time through a hierarchical
or consensual decision-making structure. See Elliott v. Foufas, 867 F.2d 877,
881 (5th Cir. 1989).
Summary
In the Fifth Circuit, a RICO claim requires the identification of a RICO
person, who is the defendant, and a RICO enterprise, which can be a legal
entity or an association-in-fact. For an association-in-fact enterprise, the
plaintiff must demonstrate evidence of an ongoing organization that
functions as a continuing unit over time, with a hierarchical or consensual
decision-making structure. This establishes the standards for alleging
individual and enterprise liability in a civil RICO complaint.

BT (N.D. Tex. Feb 26, 2021)
U.S. District Court — Northern District of Texas
Extract
It is 'unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any
enterprise ... to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct
of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.' 18
U.S.C. § 1962(c). RICO violation claims 'have three common elements: (1) a
person who engages in (2) a pattern of racketeering activity, (3) connected
to the acquisition, establishment, conduct, or control of an enterprise.'
Abraham v. Singh, 480 F.3d 351, 355 (5th Cir. 2007); 18 U.S.C. § 1962. A
plaintiff has standing to bring a civil RICO claim if he is 'injured in his
business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962.' 18 U.S.C. §
1964(c).
Summary
Elements required to plead a civil RICO claim in the Fifth Circuit, which
include identifying a person engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity
connected to an enterprise. It also specifies the standing requirement for a
plaintiff, which is to show injury to business or property due to a RICO
violation. This information is directly relevant to understanding the legal
requirements for identifying and pleading parties in a civil RICO complaint.

U.S. District Court — Southern District of Texas
Extract
When the alleged enterprise is an association-in-fact enterprise, the plaintiff
must show evidence of: (1) an existence separate and apart from the pattern
of racketeering; (2) ongoing organization; and (3) members that function as
a continuing unit as shown by a hierarchical or consensual, decision-making
structure. Delta Truck, 855 F.2d at 243. See also Boyle, 556 U.S. at 946, 129
S.Ct. 2237 (recognizing that 'an association-in-fact enterprise must have at
least three structural features: purpose, relationships among those
associated with the enterprise, and longevity sufficient to permit these
associates to pursue the enterprise's purpose'). In other words, a plaintiff
must explain the functioning of alleged enterprises to satisfy the pleading
standard for the enterprise element.
Summary
Requirements for pleading an association-in-fact enterprise under RICO in
the Fifth Circuit. It specifies that the plaintiff must demonstrate the
enterprise's existence separate from the racketeering pattern, its ongoing
organization, and its members functioning as a continuing unit. This is
crucial for establishing enterprise liability in a RICO complaint.
Elliott v. Foufas, 867 F.2d 877 (5th Cir. 1989)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
In order to state a claim under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1962, a plaintiff must allege:
1) the conduct; 2) of an enterprise; 3) through a pattern; 4) of racketeering
activity. ... The 'enterprise' element requires that the plaintiff specify the
enterprise and, in the case of an association-in-fact enterprise, plead the
necessary organizational characteristics. ... In order to avoid dismissal for
failure to state a claim, a plaintiff must plead specific facts, not mere
conclusory allegations, which establish the existence of an enterprise. ... The
enterprise must be 'an entity separate and apart from the pattern of activity
in which it engages.' ... The defendant who commits the predicate offenses
must also be distinct from the enterprise.
Summary
In the Fifth Circuit, a RICO complaint must include specific factual
allegations that establish the existence of an enterprise, which must be
distinct from the pattern of racketeering activity and the defendant. The
enterprise must have organizational characteristics, and the defendant must
be distinct from the enterprise. These requirements ensure that the
complaint is not dismissed for failure to state a claim.

Global Oil Tools, Inc. v. Barnhill, CIVIL ACTION NO: 12-1507 (E.D. La. Nov
19, 2012)
U.S. District Court — Eastern District of Louisiana
Extract
With regard to Defendants' arguments that Plaintiff has failed to properly
plead a RICO enterprise, Defendants contend that Count I of the complaint
does not establish an association-in-fact enterprise. In particular, Defendants
argue that the Plaintiff has not pled specific facts that demonstrate that the
alleged association-in-fact enterprise functions as a continuing unit through
either hierarchical or consensual decision-making. Moreover, Defendants
assert that, to the extent that Plaintiff may have successfully pleaded that an
association-in-fact enterprise, Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that the
enterprise existed for any purpose other than committing the alleged
predicate offenses, which Defendants contend is required under RICO.
Summary
In the Fifth Circuit, to properly plead a RICO enterprise, a plaintiff must
allege specific facts that demonstrate the enterprise functions as a
continuing unit through either hierarchical or consensual decision-making.
Additionally, the enterprise must exist for a purpose beyond merely
committing the alleged predicate offenses.
Atkinson v. Anadarko Bank and Trust Co., 808 F.2d 438 (5th Cir. 1987)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit

The existence of an enterprise is an essential element of a RICO claim. 18
U.S.C. Sec. 1962(c); Sedima v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479, 105 S.Ct. 3275,
3285, 87 L.Ed.2d 346 (1985). To establish an 'association in fact' enterprise
under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1961(4) plaintiffs must show 'evidence of an ongoing
organization, formal or informal, and ... evidence that the various associates
function as a continuing unit.' United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 583,
101 S.Ct. 2524, 2528, 69 L.Ed.2d 246 (1981); Shaffer v. Williams, 794 F.2d
1030, 1032 (5th Cir.1986).
Summary
Requirement for establishing an "association in fact" enterprise under RICO
in the Fifth Circuit. It specifies that plaintiffs must demonstrate evidence of
an ongoing organization, whether formal or informal, and that the associates
function as a continuing unit. This is essential for alleging enterprise liability
in a RICO complaint. The passage also references key cases that establish

=== PAGE 28 ===

these standards, indicating its broad applicability to RICO claims in the Fifth
Circuit.
Abraham v. Singh, 480 F.3d 351 (5th Cir. 2007)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
Plaintiffs allege that Defendants violated 18 U.S.C. § 1962(a), (b), (c), and
(d). These RICO subsections state, in their simplest terms, that: (a) a person
who has received income from a pattern of racketeering activity cannot
invest that income in an enterprise; (b) a person cannot acquire or maintain
an interest in an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering; (c) a person
who is employed by or associated with an enterprise cannot conduct the
affairs of the enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity; and (d) a
person cannot conspire to violate subsections (a), (b), or (c). ... To state a
claim under subsection (c), a plaintiff must demonstrate, inter alia, that the
RICO person is distinct from the RICO enterprise. ... In this case, Plaintiffs
have identified Chandler as the RICO person and Falcon Steel as the RICO
enterprise. This allegation is sufficient to demonstrate that the RICO person,
an individual employee of the corporation, is distinct from the RICO
enterprise, the corporation itself.
Summary
Requirements for pleading a civil RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) in
the Fifth Circuit. It emphasizes the necessity of distinguishing between the
RICO person and the RICO enterprise, which is a critical element in
establishing liability under subsection (c). The passage also briefly mentions
the requirements for subsections (a), (b), and (d), providing a
comprehensive overview of the standards for alleging individual and
enterprise liability in a civil RICO complaint.
Whelan v. Winchester Production Co., 319 F.3d 225 (5th Cir. 2003)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
For purposes of § 1962(c), which prohibits the conduct of an enterprise's
affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity, the plaintiff must
demonstrate not only that the enterprise is distinct from the series of
predicate acts constituting racketeering activity, but also that the RICO
'person' who commits the predicate acts is distinct from the enterprise.
Bishop v. Corbitt Marine Ways, Inc., 802 F.2d 122, 123 (5th Cir.1986). It is
not enough to establish that a defendant corporation through its agents
committed the predicate acts in the conduct of its own business. Elliott v.

=== PAGE 29 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Foufas, 867 F.2d 877, 881 (5th Cir.1989). That officers or employees of a
corporation, in the course of their employment, associate to commit
predicate acts does not establish an association-in-fact enterprise distinct
from the corporation.
Summary
The passage provides insight into the requirements for pleading a civil RICO
claim under § 1962(c) in the Fifth Circuit. It emphasizes the necessity of
demonstrating that the enterprise is distinct from the predicate acts and
that the RICO "person" is distinct from the enterprise. This distinction is
crucial to establish liability under RICO. The passage also clarifies that
merely associating to commit predicate acts within a corporation does not
automatically establish an association-in-fact enterprise distinct from the
corporation itself.
Crowe v. Henry, 43 F.3d 198 (5th Cir. 1995)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
Crowe has alleged RICO violations under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1962(a), (b), (c), and
(d). Reduced to their simplest terms, these subsections state that: (a) a
person who has received income from a pattern of racketeering activity
cannot invest that income in an enterprise; (b) a person cannot acquire or
maintain an interest in an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering
activity; (c) a person who is employed by or associated with an enterprise
cannot conduct the affairs of the enterprise through a pattern of
racketeering activity; and (d) a person cannot conspire to violate
subsections (a), (b), or (c). Common elements are present in all four of these
subsections. Ocean Energy II, Inc. v. Alexander & Alexander, Inc., 868 F.2d
740, 742 (5th Cir.1989). These common elements teach that any RICO claim
necessitates '1) a person who engages in 2) a pattern of racketeering
activity, 3) connected to the acquisition, establishment, conduct, or control
of an enterprise.' Delta Truck & Tractor, Inc. v. J.I. Case Co., 855 F.2d 241,
242 (5th Cir.1988); cert. denied, 489 U.S. 1079, 109 S.Ct. 1531, 103 L.Ed.2d
836 (1989) (emphasis in original).
Summary
Requirements for a RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1962, which include
identifying a "person" who engages in a "pattern of racketeering activity"
connected to an "enterprise." The RICO person is the defendant, and the
enterprise can be a legal entity or an association-in-fact. The passage also
emphasizes that the RICO person and the enterprise must be distinct
entities under subsection (c).

Andrews v. American Nat. Red Cross, Inc., 176 F.Supp.2d 673 (W.D. Tex.
2001)
U.S. District Court — Western District of Texas
Extract
Chiefly, Plaintiff cannot state a claim under RICO because of proximate
cause problems and a lack of distinctiveness between the RICO person and
the RICO enterprise. ... Notwithstanding that clear rule, the Fifth Circuit in
St. Paul fashioned a slim exception to allow a claim against an individual
who is also a component of an association-in-fact enterprise. As the St. Paul
court explained, 'courts have routinely required a distinction when a
corporation has been alleged as both a RICO defendant and a RICO
enterprise, but a similar requirement has not been mandated when
individuals have been named as defendants and as members of an
association-infact RICO enterprise.'
Summary
The passage highlights the requirement in the Fifth Circuit for a distinction
between the RICO person and the RICO enterprise, except in cases involving
individuals as part of an association-in-fact enterprise. This is crucial for
pleading a RICO claim, as it affects how parties are identified and alleged in
the complaint.
Tel-Phonic Services, Inc. v. TBS Intern., Inc., 975 F.2d 1134 (5th Cir. 1992)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
The RICO predicate acts were mail and wire fraud. Compl. pp 51-53. The
district court dismissed the RICO claims, finding that Plaintiffs failed 'to
allege a continuous pattern of intentional acts designed to defraud the
plaintiffs' and failed 'to plead with particularity the requisite elements of
wire and mail fraud pursuant to Rule 9(b).' Mem. Op. Sept. 12, 1988 at 3, 4;
see Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b). Because the complaint insufficiently pleads a
continuous pattern of racketeering activity or an agreement to commit at
least two predicate acts of racketeering activity, we affirm the dismissal of
the RICO claims.
Summary
The passage highlights the necessity for a RICO complaint to allege a
continuous pattern of racketeering activity and to plead the elements of
fraud with particularity as required by Rule 9(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure. This includes detailing the circumstances constituting fraud. The
failure to meet these requirements led to the dismissal of the RICO claims in

this case. This indicates that in the Fifth Circuit, a RICO complaint must
clearly identify the parties involved, specify the predicate acts, and
demonstrate a pattern of racketeering activity with sufficient detail.
Chaney v. Dreyfus Service Corp., 595 F.3d 219 (5th Cir. 2010)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
The Receivers also seek to recover under a RICO conspiracy theory. 18
U.S.C. § 1962(d). In order to demonstrate a RICO conspiracy under §
1962(d), the Receivers must demonstrate '(1) that two or more people
agreed to commit a substantive RICO offense and (2) that [DSC] knew of and
agreed to the overall objective of the RICO offense.' United States v. Sharpe,
193 F.3d 852, 869 (5th Cir.1999). A person cannot be held liable for a RICO
conspiracy 'merely by evidence that he associated with other... conspirators
or by evidence that places the defendant in a climate of activity that reeks of
something foul.'
Summary
To plead a RICO conspiracy under § 1962(d) in the Fifth Circuit, a plaintiff
must demonstrate that two or more individuals agreed to commit a
substantive RICO offense and that the defendant knew of and agreed to the
overall objective of the RICO offense. Mere association with conspirators or
being in an environment suggestive of wrongdoing is insufficient for liability.
This establishes the need for actual knowledge and agreement to the
conspiracy's objectives, which is crucial for alleging individual and
enterprise liability in a civil RICO complaint.
Cunningham v. Offshore Specialty Fabrications, 543 F.Supp.2d 614 (E.D. Tex.
2008)
U.S. District Court — Eastern District of Texas
Extract
As this Court has previously explained, '[t]o state a claim under the RICO
statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1962, a plaintiff must allege (1) the conduct (2) of an
enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity.' Z-Tel
Communs., Inc. v. SBC Communs., Inc., 331 F.Supp.2d 513, 557 (E.D.Tex.
2004) (citing Elliott v. Foufas, 867 F.2d 877, 880 (5th Cir.1989)). Defendants
attack prongs two and four by arguing that the Plaintiffs have not alleged a
proper RICO enterprise and that there are no RICO predicate acts.
Defendants also argue that Plaintiffs lack standing under RICO. As the Fifth
Circuit recently explained, '[t]o state a claim under subsection (c), a plaintiff
must demonstrate, inter alia, that the RICO person is distinct from the RICO

enterprise.' Abraham v. Singh, 480 F.3d 351, 357 (5th Cir.2007) (citing
Crowe v. Henry, 43 F.3d 198, 205-06 (5th Cir.1995); Whelan v. Winchester
Prod. Co., 319 F.3d 225, 229 (5th Cir.2003)). 'Although a defendant may not
be both a person and an enterprise, a defendant may be both a person and a
part of an enterprise. In such a case, the individual defendant is distinct
from the organizational entity.'
Summary
Requirements for pleading a RICO claim, emphasizing the need to allege
conduct, an enterprise, a pattern, and racketeering activity. It also
highlights the necessity for the RICO person to be distinct from the RICO
enterprise, which is a critical element in the Fifth Circuit. This distinction is
crucial for establishing individual and enterprise liability under RICO.
Crawford Arms, Inc. v. Waste Management of Miss., 23 F.Supp.2d 676 (S.D.
Miss. 1998)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of Mississippi
Extract
The RICO statute imposes civil and criminal liability on persons who use or
invest income derived from, acquire or maintain control of, or engage in the
conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity, or who
conspire to do any of these acts. 18 U.S.C. § 1962 (1988). Reduced to its
essential elements, a violation of § 1962 requires: '(1) a person who engages
in (2) a pattern of racketeering activity (3) connected to the acquisition,
establishment, conduct, or control of an enterprise.' Delta Truck & Tractor,
Inc. v. J.I. Case Co., 855 F.2d 241, 242 (5th Cir.1988).
Summary
Essential elements required to establish a RICO violation under § 1962,
which includes identifying a person who engages in a pattern of
racketeering activity connected to an enterprise. This is relevant to pleading
the parties in a civil RICO complaint, as it specifies the need to distinguish
between the RICO "person" and the RICO "enterprise."

To sufficiently plead a RICO claim, a plaintiff must allege that: (1) a person
(2) engages in a pattern of racketeering activity (3) connected to the

=== PAGE 33 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
acquisition, establishment, conduct, or control of an enterprise. In re
Burzynski, 989 F.2d 733, 741 (5th Cir. 1993). A 'pattern of racketeering
activity' requires at least two predicate acts of racketeering that are related
and pose a threat of continued criminal activity. Brown v. Protective Life Ins.
Co., 353 F.3d 405, 407 (5th Cir. 2003). ... A RICO enterprise may be a legal
entity or an association-in-fact. St. Paul Mercury Ins. Co. v. Williamson, 224
F.3d 425, 440 (5th Cir. 2000). To demonstrate the existence of an
association-in-fact enterprise, Plaintiffs must allege (1) there is an ongoing
organization, (2) the organization's members function as a continuing unit
through a hierarchical or consensual decision-making structure, and (3) the
organization exists separately and apart from the alleged pattern of
racketeering. Crowe v. Henry, 43 F.3d 198, 205 (5th Cir. 1995); see Gordon v.
Neugebauer, 57 F. Supp. 3d 766, 779 (N.D. Tex. 2014).
Summary
To plead a civil RICO claim in the Fifth Circuit, a plaintiff must allege the
existence of a person engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity
connected to an enterprise. The enterprise can be a legal entity or an
association-in-fact, which requires an ongoing organization, a decision-
making structure, and existence separate from the racketeering pattern.
These elements are essential for establishing both individual and enterprise
liability under RICO.
First Nat. Bank of Louisville v. Lustig, 727 F.Supp. 276 (E.D. La. 1989)
U.S. District Court — Eastern District of Louisiana
Extract
Thus, § 1962(a) requires a RICO plaintiff to plead and prove that the
defendant is liable as a principal within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. § 2 for the
underlying predicate acts. A corporation that is only the passive
instrumentality of an employee's wrongdoing cannot be held liable as a
principal... the RICO complaint must not depend upon mere conclusory
allegations, but must allege, among other things, fraud (including mail and
wire fraud) with specificity. Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b)... a civil RICO plaintiff cannot
hold a company vicariously liable for the racketeering activity of its
employee where the employee is the RICO 'person' and the company—his
employer—is the RICO 'enterprise' whose affairs are wrongfully conducted
by the employee through the pattern of racketeering activity... With respect
to the former, a plaintiff filing a civil RICO suit must 'plead facts that would
give rise to the corporate defendant's criminal liability' for the predicate
acts... the civil RICO plaintiff must plead that the defendant corporation
invested in, acquired, or participated in an enterprise through the pattern of
racketeering activity.

=== PAGE 34 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
Requirements for pleading a civil RICO claim, emphasizing the need for
specificity in allegations, particularly regarding fraud. It clarifies that a
corporation cannot be held liable for the actions of an employee unless the
corporation itself is involved in the racketeering activity. The plaintiff must
allege facts that establish the corporation's criminal liability and
participation in the enterprise. This guidance is applicable to civil RICO
claims in the Fifth Circuit.
Amuneke-Nze v. Crain
U.S. District Court — Western District of Texas
Extract
To state a civil RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962, a plaintiff must allege (1)
a person who engages in (2) a pattern of racketeering activity, (3) connected
to the acquisition, establishment, conduct, or control of an enterprise.
Abraham v. Singh, 480 F.3d 351, 355 (5th Cir. 2007). To establish a “pattern
of racketeering activity,” a plaintiff must allege “two or more predicate
criminal acts that are (1) related and (2) amount to or pose a threat of
continued criminal activity.” St. Germain v. Howard, 556 F.3d 261, 263 (5th
Cir. 2009). The RICO statute proscribes various categories of predicate acts
that may constitute racketeering activity, including extortion and mail and
wire fraud. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1).
Summary
Clear outline of the elements required to plead a civil RICO claim in the
Fifth Circuit, including the need to identify a person engaged in a pattern of
racketeering activity connected to an enterprise. It also specifies the
requirement for alleging a pattern of racketeering activity, which includes
two or more related predicate acts that pose a threat of continued criminal
activity.
Trevino v. Pechero, 592 F.Supp.2d 939 (S.D. Tex. 2008)

RICO requires a showing that (1) a person that engages in (2) a pattern of
racketeering activity, (3) connected to the acquisition, establishment,
conduct, or control of an enterprise. Crowe v. Henry, 43 F.3d 198, 204 (5th
Cir.1995) (quoting Delta Truck & Tractor, Inc. v. J.I. Case Co., 855 F.2d 241

480 F.3d 351, 357 (5th Cir.2007). The enterprise is not a pattern of
racketeering activity, but must exist separate and apart from the pattern of
racketeering activity in which it engages. Whelan v. Winchester Production
Co., 319 F.3d 225, 229 (5th Cir.2003).
Summary
Requirements for a RICO claim in the Fifth Circuit, emphasizing the need to
distinguish between RICO persons and enterprises. A RICO person is an
individual or entity that engages in a pattern of racketeering activity, while a
RICO enterprise is a separate entity that exists apart from the racketeering
activity. This distinction is crucial for properly pleading a RICO claim, as it
ensures that the enterprise is not merely the sum of the predicate acts but a
distinct entity with its own existence.

RICO makes it unlawful 'for any person employed by or associated with any
enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign
commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of
such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.' ...
'Reduced to their simplest terms, the essential elements of a RICO claim are:
(1) a person who engages in (2) a pattern of racketeering activity (3)
connected to the acquisition, establishment, conduct, or control of an

Summary
Basic elements necessary for a RICO claim, which include identifying a
person who engages in a pattern of racketeering activity connected to an
enterprise. This is relevant to understanding how to plead parties in a civil
RICO complaint, as it highlights the need to establish both individual and
enterprise liability.

1961(4). If the alleged enterprise is an association-in-fact, the plaintiff must

evidence that the various associates in the enterprise function as a
continuing unit with a common purpose. Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S.
938, 944-45 (2009). The Fifth Circuit also requires a plaintiff establish the
association-in-fact enterprise (1) has an existence separate and apart from
the pattern of racketeering, (2) is an ongoing organization and (3) has
members that function as a continuing unit as shown by a hierarchical or
consensual decision making structure.
Summary
Clear explanation of the requirements for pleading an enterprise in a RICO
complaint in the Fifth Circuit. It specifies that an enterprise can be any legal
entity or an association-in-fact, and it outlines the criteria for an association-
in-fact, including its separate existence from the pattern of racketeering, its
ongoing organization, and its functioning as a continuing unit.

RICO provides a civil cause of action to recover treble damages for '[a]ny
person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section
1962.' 18 U.S.C. § 1964. ... 'Common elements are present in all four of these
subsections. These common elements teach that any RICO claim
necessitates 1) a person who engages in 2) a pattern of racketeering activity,
3) connected to the acquisition, establishment, conduct, or control of an

'any individual partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity,
and any union or group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal
entity.' 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4). ... An association-in-fact enterprise '(1) must
have an existence separate and apart from the pattern of racketeering, (2)
must be an ongoing organization[,] and (3) its members must function as a
continuing unit as shown by a hierarchical or consensual decision making
structure.' ... Rule 9(b)'s particularity requirement applies to the pleading of
RICO predicate acts.
Summary
Essential elements required to plead a RICO claim, including the need to
identify a person engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity connected to
an enterprise. It also specifies that an association-in-fact enterprise must
have an existence separate from the racketeering pattern, be an ongoing
organization, and function as a continuing unit. Additionally, Rule 9(b)
requires that predicate acts be pleaded with particularity, specifying the
fraudulent statements, the speaker, and the context.

(1) related and (2) amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity.
Id. An enterprise under RICO is a group of persons or entities associating
together for the common purpose of engaging in a course of conduct, and an
enterprise may be a legal entity or any union or group of individuals
associated in fact.
Summary
Essential elements required to plead a RICO claim in the Fifth Circuit,
including the need to identify a person engaged in a pattern of racketeering
activity connected to an enterprise. It specifies that an enterprise can be a

complaint fails to properly plead a RICO 'enterprise'; thus, their RICO claims
would be futile. In their proposed fourth amended complaint, Plaintiffs relied
upon allegations from paragraphs 482 through 595 to support all three
RICO claims. See Doc. 120, Pls.' Mot. for Leave, Ex. B, ¶¶ 762-82. In these
paragraphs, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants comprise an 'association-in-
fact' and 'were systematically linked with overlapping leadership, structural
and financial ties, and continuing coordination.' Id. ¶ 490. This enterprise,
Plaintiffs allege, 'is a formal legitimate ongoing organization, functioning as
a continuing unit, pursuing an interrelated course of conduct, and with a
common or shared purpose and continuity of structure and personnel.' Id. ¶

Summary
In the Fifth Circuit, to plead a RICO claim, a plaintiff must establish: (1) a
person engaged in (2) a pattern of racketeering activity (3) connected to the
acquisition, establishment, conduct, or control of an enterprise. The
enterprise must have an existence separate from the pattern of
racketeering, be an ongoing organization, and its members must function as
a continuing unit. The plaintiff must plead specific facts that establish the
association exists for purposes other than simply committing predicate acts,
and must specify facts as to each defendant, avoiding lumping them
together.

emphasizing the need to allege the existence of an enterprise. It explains
that an enterprise can be a legal entity or an association-in-fact and must be
distinct from the pattern of racketeering activity itself. The passage also
highlights the necessity of pleading specific facts to establish the enterprise,
rather than relying on conclusory allegations.

98 F.4th 198 D&T Partners L.L.C. v. Baymark Partners Mgmt., L.L.C.
Extract
In pursuing this action, D&T brings claims under three subsections of the
RICO statute. See id. §§ 1962 (a), (c) & (d). Though the subsections are
distinct, each shares three common elements: '(1) a person who engages in
(2) a pattern of racketeering activity, (3) connected to the acquisition,
establishment, conduct, or control of an enterprise.' Abraham v. Singh, 480
F.3d 351, 355 (5th Cir. 2007) (quoting Word of Faith World Outreach Ctr.
Church, Inc. v. Sawyer, 90 F.3d 118, 122 (5th Cir. 1996)).
Summary
Three common elements required to plead a RICO claim under the Fifth
Circuit: (1) a person who engages in, (2) a pattern of racketeering activity,
(3) connected to the acquisition, establishment, conduct, or control of an
enterprise. This provides a clear framework for identifying and pleading the
parties involved in a RICO complaint, focusing on the individual's
engagement in racketeering activity and its connection to an enterprise.
Belton v. Regions Bank

=== PAGE 42 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
Plaintiff alleges that the defendants 'engaged in a pattern of racketing
activity' in violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations
Act ('RICO'), 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961-1968. (R. Doc. 1 at 22). To recover under
RICO, the plaintiff must establish three elements: (1) a person who engages
in (2) a pattern of racketeering activity (3) connected to the acquisition,
establishment, conduct, or control of an enterprise. Abraham v. Singh, 480 F.
3d 351, 355 (5th Cir. 2007) (quoting Word of Faith World Outreach Ctr.
Church, Inc. v. Sawyer, 90 F.3d 118, 122 (5th Cir. 1996)). As stated above,
RICO claims require the existence of an enterprise. An 'enterprise' is defined
to include 'any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or other
legal entity, and any union or group of individuals associated in fact although
not a legal entity.' 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4).
Summary
Elements required to establish a RICO claim in the Fifth Circuit, which
includes identifying a person engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity
connected to an enterprise. It also defines what constitutes an "enterprise"
under RICO, which is crucial for pleading both individual and enterprise
liability.
United Healthcare Sevices, Inc. v. Next Health, LLC
Extract
A RICO plaintiff must allege facts to show a 'pattern of racketeering activity,'
which consists of two or more predicate criminal acts that are (1) related
and (2) amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity. See 18
U.S.C. §§ 1961(5), 1962(c). United alleges predicate acts of money
laundering and mail and wire fraud, which are racketeering activities. See
18 U.S.C. §§ 1341, 1343, 1956, 1961(1). Executive Defendants contend
United fails to adequately plead both the predicate acts with specificity and
that a pattern exists.
Summary
Necessity for a RICO plaintiff to allege a pattern of racketeering activity,
which includes two or more related predicate acts that pose a threat of
continued criminal activity. It also highlights the need for specificity in
pleading these predicate acts, which are essential for establishing a RICO
claim.

Extract
To state a civil RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962, a plaintiff must allege
three common elements: “(1) a person who engages in (2) a pattern of
racketeering activity, (3) connected to the acquisition, establishment,
conduct, or control of an enterprise.” N. Cypress Med. Ctr. Operating Co.,
Ltd. v. Cigna Healthcare, 781 F.3d 182, 201 (5th Cir. 2015) (quotation
omitted). An act of “racketeering activity,” commonly referred to as a
“predicate act,” is defined to include certain criminal acts, including mail
and wire fraud, and any act indictable under the Immigration and
Nationality Act. See 18 U.S.C § 1961 (defining “racketeering activity”);
Waste Mgmt. of La., L.L.C. v. River Birch, Inc., 920 F.3d 958, 964 (5th Cir.
2019) (referring to racketeering activity as a “predicate act”).

Provost v. First Guar. Bank
Extract
In order for a plaintiff to establish liability, he must allege and prove the
existence of two distinct entities: (1) a 'person;' and (2) an 'enterprise.'
Cedric Kushner Promostions, Ltd. v. King, 533 U.S. 158, 161, 121 S.Ct. 2087,
2090, 150 L.Ed.2. 198 (2001). ... The Second Amended Complaint alleges
that 'Duhon and Plaintiff each constituted a 'person' within the meaning of
18 U.S.C. § 1961(3), as each was capable of holding a legal or beneficial
interest in property,' and that 'the corporation First Guaranty Bank
constituted an 'Enterprise' within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4)'
because '[a]mong other things, the Enterprise provided loans and other
banking services across multiple states, and it transacted business through
the use of the United States mails and interstate telephone wires.' (Rec.
Doc. 40, ¶¶ 147-149). The Second Amended Complaint further pleads that
'Senior Vice President Duhon is a separate person, distinct from the
Enterprise itself, who unlawfully used the Enterprise as a vehicle through
which unlawful activity was committed.' (Id. at 150).
Summary
Clear explanation of the requirements for pleading a civil RICO claim in the
Fifth Circuit. It emphasizes the necessity of alleging two distinct entities: a
"person" and an "enterprise." The "person" must be capable of holding a
legal or beneficial interest in property, while the "enterprise" is an entity
through which unlawful activity is conducted. The passage also highlights

X. Wen v. SanQuest, Inc.
Extract
RICO claims require ‘1) a person who engages in 2) a pattern of
racketeering activity, 3) connected to the acquisition, establishment,
conduct, or control of an enterprise.'” Word of Faith World Outreach Ctr.
Church, Inc. v. Sawyer, 90 F.3d 118, 122 (5th Cir. 1996) (quoting In re
Burzynski, 989 F.2d 733, 741-42 (5th Cir. 1993)). The RICO statute defines
an enterprise as “any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or
other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals associated in fact
although not a legal entity.” 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4). The Fifth Circuit has
further explained that an “enterprise can be either a legal entity or an
association-in-fact.” St. Paul Mercury Ins. Co. v. Williamson, 224 F.3d 425,
440 (5th Cir. 2000). An association-in-fact enterprise “must have at least
three structural features: a purpose, relationships among those associated
with the enterprise, and longevity sufficient to permit these associates to
pursue the enterprise's purpose.” Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938, 946
(2009). In essence, “an association-in-fact enterprise is a group of persons
associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a course of
conduct.” Id. (quotations omitted). To allege that an enterprise is an
association-in-fact, a plaintiff must plausibly allege that the organization
“functions as a continuing unit over time through a hierarchical or
consensual decision-making structure.” Elliott v. Foufas, 867 F.2d 877, 881
(5th Cir. 1989). Additionally, the Fifth Circuit has held that the defendant
who allegedly engaged in racketeering-the RICO person-must be “distinct
from the [RICO] enterprise” with respect to claims asserted under 18 U.S.C.
§§ 1962(c) and 1962(d). Id. at 881. This “separate and distinct” requirement
means that a plaintiff cannot claim that a company is both the RICO
enterprise and the “RICO person” who engaged in racketeering. See Whelan
v. Winchester Prod. Co., 319 F.3d 225, 229 (5th Cir. 2003).
Summary
In the Fifth Circuit, a RICO claim requires identifying a person who engages
in a pattern of racketeering activity connected to an enterprise. The
enterprise can be a legal entity or an association-in-fact, which must have a
purpose, relationships, and longevity. The RICO person must be distinct
from the enterprise, meaning a company cannot be both the enterprise and
the RICO person. This requirement ensures that the enterprise is separate
from the individual or entity engaging in racketeering.

Extract
All four subsections of § 1962 have three common elements: '1) a person
who engages in 2) a pattern of racketeering activity, 3) connected to the
acquisition, establishment, conduct, or control of an enterprise.' Crowe, 43
F.3d at 204 (emphasis omitted). The statute broadly defines 'person' to
include 'any individual or entity capable of holding a legal or beneficial
interest in property.' 18 U.S.C. § 1961(3); Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S.
938, 944 (2009) ('The term ‘any’ ensures that the definition has a wide
reach ....'). 'To establish th[e] pattern [element], a plaintiff must show both a
relationship between the predicate offenses. .. and the threat of continuing
activity.' Malvino v. Delluniversita, 840 F.3d 223, 231 (5th Cir. 2016). '[A]n
enterprise. .. ‘is proved by evidence of an ongoing organization, formal or
informal, and by evidence that the various associates function as a
continuing unit.' Boyle, 556 U.S. at 945 (quoting United States v. Turkette,
452 U.S. 576, 583 (1981)).
Summary
Clear explanation of the elements required to plead a RICO claim, including
the definition of a "person" and the requirements for establishing a "pattern
of racketeering activity" and an "enterprise." It also references relevant case
law that further clarifies these elements.

Rodriguez v. Meta Platforms, Inc.
Extract
A RICO plaintiff 'must plead specific facts, not mere conclusory allegations,
which establish the enterprise,' and 'plaintiff must plead the specified facts
as to each defendant. It cannot... lump[ ] together the defendants.' Plaintiff's
Complaint includes conclusory allegations of 'defamation, unauthorized
access, and systematic harassment,' but those activities do not constitute
'racketeering activity' as defined in the RICO statute.
Summary
The passage provides insight into the requirements for pleading a civil RICO
complaint in the Fifth Circuit. It emphasizes the necessity for plaintiffs to
plead specific facts that establish the existence of an enterprise and the
involvement of each defendant. Conclusory allegations are insufficient, and
plaintiffs must avoid vague group pleading. This aligns with the general
pleading standards under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, particularly
Rule 8 and Rule 9(b) for fraud claims.

Section [sections] 1962(c) prohibits persons employed by or associated with
an enterprise from conducting or participating in the conduct of the affairs
of that enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. This requires a
relationship between the pattern of racketeering activity and the enterprise.
Summary
Section 1962(c) of the RICO Act requires a clear relationship between the
defendant's actions and the enterprise's affairs. This means that for a civil
RICO complaint, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant was
employed by or associated with the enterprise and that their actions were
part of a pattern of racketeering activity that affected the enterprise. This
establishes the standard for alleging individual and enterprise liability in a
RICO claim.

Bailey, Lisa Pritchard - 1999-06-22
Extract
The circuits are split on the specific standing requirements for a civil action
under [sections] 1962(a). To allege a violation of [sections] 1962(a), a
plaintiff must show that someone had (1) received income from a pattern of
racketeering activity; and (2) used or invested this income in a RICO
enterprise. In determining whether a plaintiff suffered a type of injury
granting standing, the courts... by one of the predicate acts covered by
[sections] 1962(c). This rule significantly limits standing. For example, a
person wrongfully discharged for refusing to participate in a pattern of
racketeering activity lacks standing to sue under [sections] 1962(c) because
the harm suffered is caused by the termination, not the predicate acts of
racketeering. In addition, the Supreme Court held that a plaintiff must prove
the defendant's violation was the proximate cause of the plaintiff's injury in
order to have standing under civil RICO.
Summary
The passage provides insight into the standing requirements for a civil RICO
claim, emphasizing the need for a plaintiff to demonstrate that their injury
was proximately caused by the defendant's violation of RICO. It also
highlights the necessity of showing that the injury resulted from the
investment of racketeering income into the enterprise, which is crucial for
establishing individual and enterprise liability under RICO.

Extract
Courts agree that to establish standing under [sections] 1962(c), a plaintiff
must have suffered a harm caused by one of the predicate acts covered by
[sections] 1962(c). This rule significantly limits standing. For example, a
person wrongfully discharged for refusing to participate in a pattern of
racketeering activity lacks standing to sue under [sections] 1962(c) because
the harm suffered is caused by the termination, not the predicate acts of
racketeering. In addition, the Supreme Court has held that a plaintiff must
prove the defendant's violation was the proximate cause of the plaintiff's
injury in order to have standing under civil RICO. The Court reasoned that
Congress modeled [sections] 1964(c) on the civil action provisions in the
Clayton Act, which federal courts have long held to require a showing of
proximate causation.
Summary
The passage explains that for a plaintiff to have standing in a civil RICO case
under section 1962(c), they must demonstrate harm caused by a predicate
act of racketeering. Additionally, the plaintiff must show that the defendant's
violation was the proximate cause of their injury, aligning with the causation
standards in the Clayton Act. This information is crucial for understanding
the requirements for pleading individual and enterprise liability in a civil
RICO complaint.

To have standing for a civil cause of action under RICO, a plaintiff must

business or property; and (iii) causation of the injury by the violation. (299)
To sue for a violation of [section] 1962(a), a plaintiff must show that
someone both received income from a pattern of racketeering activity and
then used or invested such income in an enterprise. (300) Most courts hold
that a compensable injury must flow from the use or investment of the
income and cannot just flow from the predicate acts. (301)... Moreover, a
plaintiff must prove that the defendant's violation of [section] 1962 was the
proximate cause of the plaintiff's injury to have standing for a civil RICO
action. (310)

Extract
The Supreme Court has consistently reinforced Congress's intent to
construe civil RICO broadly by instructing the lower courts to heed the
expansive language of the statute. In Sedima, S.P.R.C. v. Imrex Co., the
Supreme Court struck down the Second's Circuit's requirement that a
plaintiff may file a civil suit under [section] 1964 only after showing a
criminal RICO conviction and proving a 'racketeering' injury distinct from
harm caused by predicate acts. Finding the restrictions inconsistent both
with RICO's statutory language and with the congressional intent that the
statute be broadly construed, the Court held that a plaintiff has a claim
under [section] 1964(c) if defendant engaged in a pattern of racketeering
activity in... is established when a plaintiff shows: (i) a violation of [section]
1962(a), (b), (c), or (d); (ii) injury to her business or property; and (iii) that
the violation caused the injury.
Summary
The passage highlights the Supreme Court's broad interpretation of civil
RICO, emphasizing that a plaintiff does not need to show a criminal RICO
conviction or a distinct "racketeering" injury. Instead, a plaintiff must
demonstrate a violation of section 1962, an injury to business or property,
and causation between the violation and the injury. This broad interpretation
is relevant to the Fifth Circuit as it aligns with the general federal approach
to RICO claims.

plaintiff must have suffered an injury to business or property caused by one
of the predicate acts of racketeering. (313) ... The Court held that an injury

=== PAGE 51 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
caused by an overt act that is not an act of racketeering nor otherwise
unlawful under RICO is not sufficient to bring a civil RICO suit. (316)
Therefore, a plaintiff bringing a civil RICO claim for injuries sustained from
a violation of [section] 1962(d) must demonstrate that the injuries arose
from a predicate act that is ... by predicate acts. Id. at 488-95. Second, the
Court established that plaintiff has a claim under [section] 1964(c) if
defendant engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity in a manner
forbidden by [section] 1962 and such activity injured plaintiff in his business
or property, Id. at 495. Third, the Court clarified that for a civil claim based
on a violation of [section] 1962(c), '[the] [c]ompensable injury necessarily is
the harm caused by [the] predicate acts' of a RICO violation. Id, at 497.
Summary
To plead a civil RICO claim, a plaintiff must demonstrate an injury to
business or property caused by a predicate act of racketeering. The injury
must be directly linked to the racketeering activity, and the plaintiff must
show that the defendant engaged in a pattern of such activity. This
establishes the basis for individual and enterprise liability under RICO.

Extract
RICO is not just a tool for government control over organized crime. It is
also a remedial statute for civil matters. (31) It 'authorize[s]... criminal or
civil remedies on conduct already criminal, when performed in a specified
fashion' as delineated by the statute. (32) Section 1962 provides civil
remedies for four types of conduct: (1) using income derived from a pattern
of racketeering activity (33) to acquire an interest in an enterprise; (2)
acquiring or maintaining an interest in an enterprise through a pattern of
racketeering activity; (3) conducting the affairs of an enterprise through a
pattern of racketeering activity; and (4) conspiring to commit any of these
offenses. (34) Today, Congress urges courts to construe RICO liberally from
the 'perspective of the victim, not the perpetrator.' (35) A private civil right
of action in [section] 1964 provides that '[a]ny person injured in his business
or property by reason of a violation of section 1962... may sue.' (36) Notably,
a successful plaintiff under [section] 1964 is entitled to treble damages and
the cost of the suit, including attorney fees. (37)
Summary
Types of conduct that can give rise to civil remedies under RICO,
emphasizing the statute's remedial nature and the liberal construction from

Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy
The Brief - American Bar Association - 2024-01-01
Extract
A violation of § 1962(c), the section on which Sedima relies, requires (1)
conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity. The plaintiff must allege each of the elements to state a claim. They
are all equally essential components, and the complaint will fail if any one of
them is not adequately pleaded. In particular, RICO claims based on mail or
wire fraud must comport with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b)’s
requirement that allegations involving fraud be pleaded with particularity.
The practitioner through their pleadings must articulate with great care and
attention a viable racketeering... To state a civil RICO case, the plaintiff
must allege the substantive components of an “enterprise” and a “pattern”
with specificity. The plaintiff must also allege facts sufficient to support each
of the statutory elements for at least two of the pleaded predicate acts and
that each defendant knowingly agreed to participate in the... RICO’s
prohibitions may be enforced in both criminal and civil contexts. In the
context of a civil action, a plaintiff must be directly injured by reason of the
defendant’s racketeering activities. Proximate cause, as an aspect of RICO’s
“by reason of ” standard, requires a RICO plaintiff to show that the
defendant’s racketeering offenses led directly to the plaintiff’s injuries.
RICO creates a private cause of action under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c). To state a
civil RICO claim, a plaintiff must allege (1) two or more predicate
racketeering offenses, (2) the existence of an enterprise affecting interstate
commerce, (3) a connection between the racketeering offenses, and (4) an
injury by reason of the above.
Summary
Essential elements required to plead a civil RICO claim, specifically under §
1962(c). It emphasizes the need to allege conduct of an enterprise through a
pattern of racketeering activity, with particular attention to the specificity
required for fraud-based claims under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b).
The passage also highlights the necessity of demonstrating direct injury
caused by the defendant's racketeering activities, establishing proximate
cause. These elements are crucial for identifying and pleading the parties in

Extract
The central provision of RICO states that 'it shall be unlawful for any person
through a pattern of racketeering activity which is engaged in, or the
activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce.' A person includes
'any individual or entity capable of holding a legal or beneficial interest in
property.' This term is intentionally broad and includes a variety of entities,
such as corporations, non-profit organizations, and 'members of organized
crime.' In order for the government to establish a violation of RICO it must
prove that the defendant engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity that
involved an enterprise engaged in interstate commerce.
Summary
RICO's definition of a "person" is broad, encompassing any individual or
entity capable of holding a legal or beneficial interest in property. This
includes corporations, non-profit organizations, and members of organized
crime. To establish a RICO violation, it must be shown that the defendant
engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity involving an enterprise
engaged in interstate commerce. This provides a foundational
understanding of who can be a party in a RICO complaint and the necessity
of demonstrating a pattern of racketeering activity linked to an enterprise.
RICO: A Primer
Extract
A RICO person 'includes any individual or entity capable of holding a legal
or beneficial interest in property.' This definition defines those who can be
charged under RICO. While the definition clearly includes a natural person,
as well as a corporation, union, partnership and a sole proprietorship, it is
not settled whether the definition encompasses a governmental entity. A
RICO enterprise includes 'any individual, partnership, corporation,
association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals
associated in fact although not a legal entity.' Courts have interpreted
'enterprise' broadly, and the definition captures both legitimate and
illegitimate enterprises.
Summary
The passage provides definitions for a "RICO person" and a "RICO
enterprise." A RICO person can be any individual or entity capable of
holding a legal or beneficial interest in property, which includes natural
persons, corporations, unions, partnerships, and sole proprietorships. The
definition of a RICO enterprise is broad and includes any individual,
partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, as well as any
group of individuals associated in fact, even if not a legal entity. This broad
interpretation captures both legitimate and illegitimate enterprises, which is
crucial for pleading enterprise liability in a RICO complaint.

Defending Civil RICO Claims: A Defense Plan Should Be In Every Business's
Arsenal
Extract
RICO is not a simple statute. It pertains to conduct associated with an
'enterprise' and 'a pattern racketeering activity.' An enterprise is an
individual or legal entity, or a union or group of individuals associated in fact
although not a legal entity, while a pattern of racketeering activity requires
long-term, organized conduct to violate state and federal laws. ... Fourth, for
most RICO claims, the plaintiff also must plead that the alleged 'person' and
'enterprise,' as defined in RICO, are distinct. While often technical, this
'distinctiveness' requirement provides that a corporation generally will not
be liable for operating an 'enterprise' consisting of itself and its officers or
employees.
