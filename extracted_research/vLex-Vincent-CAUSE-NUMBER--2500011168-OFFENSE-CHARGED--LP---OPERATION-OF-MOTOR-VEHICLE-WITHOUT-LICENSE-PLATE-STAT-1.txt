final judgment entered. Best options to challenge on appeal? The fines have
already been paid. What are the options?
Answer (Texas)

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Short response
Despite payment of fines, Mr. Myers still has limited options to challenge the
municipal court judgments, including filing a motion for new trial within 10
days of the judgments or pursuing a restricted appeal within six months if he
meets specific jurisdictional requirements.
Summary
Ryan Sterling Myers received three judgments from the Municipal Court of
Allen, Collin County, Texas on June 17, 2025, for operating a motor vehicle
without license plates ($146.00), operating a vehicle with improperly
displayed or no registration insignia ($141.00), and speeding ($262.00).
Despite entering pleas of "No Contest" and having already paid the fines,
Myers may still have legal avenues to challenge these judgments on appeal,
though these options are significantly limited by both the nature of his plea
and the payment of the fines.
The primary options available to Myers include filing a motion for new trial
with the municipal clerk within 10 days of the judgment date, which would
preserve certain points of error for appeal. Alternatively, he could pursue a
restricted appeal within six months of the judgment date if he meets specific
jurisdictional requirements. However, his "No Contest" plea substantially
narrows the grounds for appeal, generally limiting them to jurisdictional
defects, constitutional challenges to the underlying statutes, or arguments
regarding the voluntariness of his plea. The fact that the fines have already
been paid creates additional practical and procedural hurdles, though it
does not automatically preclude all appeal rights.
Background and Relevant Law
Appeal Process from Municipal Courts in Texas
In Texas, a defendant convicted in a municipal court of record has the right
to appeal that conviction to a county criminal court. Tex. Gov't. Code §
30.00014(a) states that "To perfect an appeal, the appellant must file a
written motion for new trial with the municipal clerk not later than the 10th
day after the date on which judgment is rendered." This motion must
specifically set forth the points of error the appellant is complaining about.
When appealing from a municipal court of record, the appeal to the county
court is not by trial de novo (a completely new trial). As clarified in 
Alexander v. State, 240 S.W.3d 72, 74 (Tex. App. 2007): "But in an appeal
from a municipal court of record, the county court may not retry the case;
instead, it must determine the appeal on the basis of the errors shown in the
municipal court record." This means that Myers would need to identify
specific errors in the record of the municipal court proceedings to have
grounds for an appeal.

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
If the county court affirms the municipal court's judgment and the fine
exceeds $100, the defendant may then appeal to the court of appeals. Tex.
Gov't. Code § 30.00027(a) provides that "The appellant has the right to
appeal to the court of appeals if: the fine assessed against the defendant
exceeds $100 and the judgment is affirmed by the appellate court; or the
sole issue is the constitutionality of the statute or ordinance on which a
conviction is based." In this case, all three fines exceed $100, so this
threshold requirement for further appeal would be met if the county court
affirms the municipal court judgments.
Appeal Bond Requirements
To perfect an appeal from a municipal court judgment, the defendant must
file an appeal bond. Tex. Gov't. Code § 30.00015 states: "If the defendant is
not in custody, the defendant may not take an appeal until the defendant
files an appeal bond with the municipal court of record. The bond must be
approved by the court and must be filed not later than the 10th day after the
date on which the motion for new trial is overruled." The appeal bond must
be in the amount of $100 or double the amount of the fines and costs,
whichever is greater.
Similarly, Tex. Code Crim. Proc. § 45A.203 affirms: "An appeal is perfected
when the appeal bond has been filed: with the justice or judge who tried the
case; and not later than the 10th day after the date the judgment was
entered." This underscores the importance of the timely filing of the appeal
bond to perfect the appeal.
In cases where the 10-day deadline has passed, there may be limited
exceptions. Tex. Gov't. Code § 30.00147 provides that "For good cause
shown, not later than the 100th day after the date of rendition of the
judgment of conviction, the appellate court or the court of appeals may
permit the filing of an appeal bond or the giving of notice of appeal in the
municipal court of record even though the time limits set under this section
have expired." This provision offers a potential avenue for Myers to file an
appeal bond after the initial deadline, provided he can demonstrate good
cause for the delay.
Impact of "No Contest" Plea on Appeal Rights
Myers entered a plea of "No Contest" to all three charges. This significantly
impacts his appeal rights. Ex parte Calderon, No. 05-18-01292-CR (Tex. App.
Feb 21, 2019) explains: "In cases where the defendant enters a plea of guilty
or no contest, however, the defendant is not entitled to Jackson legal
sufficiency review... The defendant's plea of guilty or no contest waives all
non-jurisdictional defenses including any issue as to the insufficiency of the
evidence." This means that by pleading "No Contest," Myers has waived his
right to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence against him.
Furthermore, Blanton v. State, 369 S.W.3d 894 (Tex. Crim. App. 2012)
clarifies: "A defendant in any criminal action has the right of appeal under
the rules hereinafter prescribed; provided, however, before the defendant
who has been convicted upon either his plea of guilty or plea of nolo

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
contendere before the court... may prosecute his appeal, he must have
permission of the trial court, except on those matters which have been
raised by written motion filed prior to trial." This means that to appeal
matters not raised in a pre-trial motion, Myers would need to obtain
permission from the trial court.
The secondary material Pretrial Motions (2019-08-16) further reinforces this
point: "When a defendant enters an open plea of guilty to an offense, he
waives the right to appeal any nonjurisdictional defects, other than the
voluntariness of his plea, which occurred before entry of the plea. Flowers v.
State, 935 S.W.2d 131 (Tex. Crim. App. 1996)." It's important to note that
Flowers has been "Stated as Overruled" by Ray Garcia v. the State of Texas,
43 S.W.3d 725 (Tex. App. 2001). However, the principle that a "No Contest"
plea waives non-jurisdictional defects remains valid in Texas law, as
evidenced by the other authorities cited.
Impact of Payment of Fines on Appeal Rights
The fact that Myers has already paid the fines complicates his appeal
options but does not necessarily eliminate them entirely. Tex. Code Crim.
Proc. § 44.02 broadly states: "A defendant in any criminal action has the
right of appeal under the rules hereinafter prescribed." This suggests that
the right to appeal exists independently of whether the fine has been paid.
Similarly, the secondary material Post-trial proceedings (2022-04-02)
confirms: "A defendant in a criminal case has the right of appeal under Code
of Criminal Procedure article 44.02 and these rules. The trial court shall
enter a certification of the defendant's right of appeal each time it enters a
judgment of guilt or other appealable order." This right exists regardless of
whether the fine has been paid, though practical and procedural issues may
arise.
Restricted Appeal as a Potential Option
If the conventional appeal deadlines have passed, Myers might consider a
restricted appeal. According to Restricted Appeals In Texas (2022-06-09): "A
restricted appeal is a direct attack on a judgment. To attack a trial court's
judgment by restricted appeal, a party must show that: a notice of appeal
was filed within six months of the date that the complained-of judgment was
signed; the filer was a party to the suit that did not participate in the
hearing that resulted in the judgment or order; the party did not timely file a
post-judgment motion, request findings of fact and conclusions of law, or file
a notice of appeal within the time permitted under Texas Rule of Appellate
Procedure 26.1(a); and the complained-of error is apparent from the face of
the record."
If Myers meets these jurisdictional requirements, a restricted appeal could
provide a path forward even after the conventional appeal deadlines have
passed.

Analysis of Appeal Options
Option 1: Motion for New Trial
The first and most immediate option available to Myers would be to file a
motion for new trial with the municipal clerk. Tex. Gov't. Code § 30.00014(c)
requires this motion to be filed "not later than the 10th day after the date on
which judgment is rendered." The judgments in this case were rendered on
June 17, 2025, meaning that Myers would need to file his motion for new
trial by June 27, 2025.
The motion must specifically set forth the points of error Myers is
complaining about. As emphasized in Chapa v. State, No. 05-19-00609-CR
(Tex. App. Mar 09, 2020): "To preserve a point of error in an appeal from a
municipal court, the appellant must raise the identical point in the motion
for new trial." This means that Myers must clearly identify and articulate the
specific errors he believes occurred in his case.
Given that the judgments are dated June 17, 2025, and today's date is June
24, 2025, Myers still has a few days remaining to file a motion for new trial.
This would be his most straightforward option to initiate the appeal process.
Option 2: Appeal Bond
Assuming Myers files a motion for new trial, the next step would be to file an
appeal bond. Tex. Gov't. Code § 30.00015 requires the appeal bond to be
filed "not later than the 10th day after the date on which the motion for new
trial is overruled." The court has 30 days to act on the motion for new trial,
after which time it is automatically overruled by operation of law if no action
is taken.
The appeal bond must be in the amount of $100 or double the amount of the
fines and costs, whichever is greater. In Myers' case, the total fines and
costs across all three judgments amount to $549.00 ($146.00 + $141.00 +
$262.00). Therefore, the appeal bond would need to be at least $1,098.00
(double the amount of fines and costs).
The fact that Myers has already paid the fines raises a practical question
about the appeal bond requirement. While the statutes do not explicitly
address how payment of fines affects the appeal bond requirement, the
purpose of the bond is to ensure payment of the judgment. Since payment
has already been made, Myers could potentially argue that the appeal bond
requirement should be waived or reduced, though this argument is not
directly supported by the provided legal authorities.
Option 3: Appeal to County Criminal Court
If Myers successfully files a motion for new trial and posts an appeal bond,
his appeal would proceed to the county criminal court. Tex. Code Crim. Proc.
§ 45A.202 states: "An appeal from a justice or municipal court, including an
appeal from a final judgment in a bond forfeiture proceeding, shall be heard

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
by the county court or, if the county court has no jurisdiction over the case,
the proper court in the county."
Since the Municipal Court of Allen is a court of record, the appeal to the
county court would not be by trial de novo. As explained in Swain v. State,
319 S.W.3d 878 (Tex. App. 2010): "The county criminal court may not retry
the case; instead, it must determine the appeal on the basis of the errors
shown in the municipal court record." This means that the county court will
review the municipal court record for errors, rather than conducting a new
trial.
The county court has several options when deciding the appeal. Tex. Gov't.
Code § 30.00024 provides: "According to the law and the nature of the case,
the appellate court may: affirm the judgment of the municipal court of
record; reverse and remand for a new trial; reverse and dismiss the case; or
reform and correct the judgment."
Option 4: Appeal to Court of Appeals
If the county criminal court affirms the municipal court's judgment, Myers
may have the option to further appeal to the court of appeals. Tex. Gov't.
Code § 30.00027(a) allows such an appeal if "the fine assessed against the
defendant exceeds $100 and the judgment is affirmed by the appellate
court; or the sole issue is the constitutionality of the statute or ordinance on
which a conviction is based."
Since all three of Myers' fines exceed $100 ($146.00, $141.00, and $262.00),
he would meet the financial threshold for appeal to the court of appeals if
the county court affirms the municipal court's judgment.
Option 5: Restricted Appeal
If Myers has missed the deadlines for filing a motion for new trial and
appeal bond, he might still have the option of pursuing a restricted appeal. 
Restricted Appeals In Texas (2022-06-09) outlines four jurisdictional
requirements for a restricted appeal:
The notice of appeal must be filed within six months of the judgment
date.
The appellant must be a party to the suit who did not participate in the
hearing that resulted in the judgment.
The appellant must not have timely filed a post-judgment motion,
request for findings of fact and conclusions of law, or notice of appeal
within the time permitted under Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure
26.1(a).
The error complained of must be apparent from the face of the record.
The judgments in Myers' case were rendered on June 17, 2025, so he would
have until December 17, 2025, to file a notice of restricted appeal. However,
he would need to meet all four jurisdictional requirements, which may be
challenging given his participation in the case through his "No Contest"
plea.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Potential Grounds for Appeal
Given Myers' "No Contest" plea, his grounds for appeal are significantly
limited. However, there are still potential bases for appeal that he might
consider:
1. Jurisdictional Defects
Myers' "No Contest" plea does not waive jurisdictional defects. If there were
issues with the court's jurisdiction over the case, these could still be raised
on appeal. For example, if the alleged offenses occurred outside the city
limits of Allen, this could potentially be a jurisdictional issue that could be
raised on appeal.
2. Constitutional Challenges to the Statutes
Tex. Gov't. Code § 30.00027(a) specifically allows appeal to the court of
appeals when "the sole issue is the constitutionality of the statute or
ordinance on which a conviction is based." If Myers believes that the
statutes underlying his convictions (e.g., the statutes regarding license
plates, registration insignia, or speeding) are unconstitutional, this could
provide grounds for appeal.
3. Involuntariness of the Plea
As noted in Pretrial Motions (2019-08-16), a defendant who enters a plea of
"No Contest" retains the right to appeal issues related to "the voluntariness
of his plea." If Myers believes that his "No Contest" plea was not made
voluntarily—for example, if he was coerced or not properly informed of the
consequences of his plea—this could potentially be grounds for appeal.
4. Dismissal Based on Remedying the Defect
For the charge of operating a vehicle without registration insignia, Tex.
Transp. Code § 502.473 provides a potential remedy: "A court may dismiss a
charge brought under Subsection (a) if the defendant pays a reimbursement
fee not to exceed $10 and: remedies the defect before the defendant's first
court appearance; or shows that the motor vehicle was issued a registration
insignia by the department that was attached to the motor vehicle,
establishing that the vehicle was registered for the period during which the
offense was committed." If Myers can demonstrate that he remedied the
defect before his first court appearance or that the vehicle was actually
registered during the relevant period, he might have grounds to seek
dismissal of this charge.

Practical Considerations and Challenges
Payment of Fines
The fact that Myers has already paid the fines presents practical challenges.
While payment of a fine does not automatically waive all appeal rights, it
may be viewed as an acceptance of the judgment, making it more difficult to
challenge. Furthermore, even if Myers succeeds in his appeal, the court
would need to address the issue of reimbursement for fines already paid.
Limited Time for Filing Motion for New Trial
With the judgments rendered on June 17, 2025, and today being June 24,
2025, Myers has just a few days remaining to file a motion for new trial
(until June 27, 2025). This limited timeframe creates practical pressure to
act quickly if he wishes to pursue this option.
Waiver of Non-Jurisdictional Defects
Myers' "No Contest" plea has waived many potential grounds for appeal. As
stated in Ex parte Calderon, No. 05-18-01292-CR (Tex. App. Feb 21, 2019),
"The defendant's plea of guilty or no contest waives all non-jurisdictional
defenses including any issue as to the insufficiency of the evidence." This
significantly narrows the potential grounds for appeal.
Need for Permission to Appeal
Given Myers' "No Contest" plea, he may need permission from the trial court
to appeal matters not raised in a pre-trial motion. Blanton v. State, 369 S.W.
3d 894 (Tex. Crim. App. 2012) states that a defendant who has entered a
plea of "nolo contendere" must have "permission of the trial court" to
"prosecute his appeal," except for "matters which have been raised by
written motion filed prior to trial."
Jurisdictional Requirements for Restricted Appeal
If Myers considers a restricted appeal, it may be challenging to meet all four
jurisdictional requirements. In particular, the requirement that the appellant
"did not participate in the hearing that resulted in the judgment" may be
difficult to satisfy given Myers' "No Contest" plea.
Recommendations and Strategy
Based on the analysis of the legal framework and the specific circumstances
of Myers' case, the following recommendations and strategy emerge:

=== PAGE 10 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Immediate Action: Motion for New Trial
Given that Myers still has time to file a motion for new trial (until June 27,
2025), this would be the most straightforward option to preserve his appeal
rights. The motion should clearly specify the points of error he is
complaining about.
Potential Grounds for the Motion
Given the limitations imposed by the "No Contest" plea, Myers should focus
on jurisdictional issues, constitutional challenges to the underlying statutes,
or arguments regarding the voluntariness of his plea. For the registration
insignia charge, he might also consider the specific dismissal provision in 
Tex. Transp. Code § 502.473 if he can demonstrate that he remedied the
defect before his first court appearance or that the vehicle was actually
registered during the relevant period.
Appeal Bond Consideration
If Myers files a motion for new trial, he should be prepared to file an appeal
bond within 10 days after the motion is overruled. Given that he has already
paid the fines, he might consider requesting a reduction or waiver of the
appeal bond requirement, though this is not explicitly provided for in the
statutes.
Restricted Appeal as a Fallback
If Myers misses the deadline for filing a motion for new trial, he might
consider a restricted appeal. However, he should carefully evaluate whether
he can meet all four jurisdictional requirements, particularly given his
participation in the case through his "No Contest" plea.
Seek Permission from the Trial Court
Given the "No Contest" plea, Myers should consider seeking permission
from the trial court to appeal, as required by Blanton v. State, 369 S.W.3d
894 (Tex. Crim. App. 2012), unless the appeal is based on matters raised in a
pre-trial motion.
Conclusion
Despite having entered pleas of "No Contest" and having already paid the
fines, Myers still has limited options to challenge the municipal court
judgments on appeal. His most immediate option is to file a motion for new
trial with the municipal clerk by June 27, 2025, clearly specifying the points
of error he is complaining about. He would then need to file an appeal bond
within 10 days after the motion is overruled, which could lead to an appeal
to the county criminal court and potentially to the court of appeals.

=== PAGE 11 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
However, Myers' "No Contest" plea significantly limits the grounds for
appeal, generally restricting them to jurisdictional defects, constitutional
challenges to the underlying statutes, or arguments regarding the
voluntariness of his plea. For the registration insignia charge, he might also
have grounds for dismissal if he can demonstrate that he remedied the
defect before his first court appearance or that the vehicle was actually
registered during the relevant period.
The fact that Myers has already paid the fines creates practical challenges
but does not automatically waive all appeal rights. However, it may be
viewed as an acceptance of the judgment, making it more difficult to
challenge. Furthermore, even if Myers succeeds in his appeal, the court
would need to address the issue of reimbursement for fines already paid.
If Myers misses the deadline for filing a motion for new trial, he might still
have the option of pursuing a restricted appeal within six months of the
judgment date, though this would require meeting specific jurisdictional
requirements that may be challenging given his participation in the case
through his "No Contest" plea.
Overall, while Myers has limited options to challenge the judgments on
appeal, these options are not entirely foreclosed. With prompt action and
careful attention to the procedural requirements, he may still be able to
pursue an appeal, though the grounds for appeal will be significantly
narrowed by his "No Contest" plea and the payment of the fines.
Legal Authorities
Ex parte Calderon, No. 05-18-01292-CR (Tex. App. Feb 21, 2019)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
In cases where the defendant enters a plea of guilty or no contest, however,
the defendant is not entitled to Jackson legal sufficiency review. See Boykin
v. Alabama, 395 U.S. 238, 242 (1969); Ex parte Williams, 703 S.W.2d 674,
682 (Tex. Crim. App. 1986). The defendant's plea of guilty or no contest
waives all non-jurisdictional defenses including any issue as to the
insufficiency of the evidence. See Williams, 703 S.W.2d at 682.
Summary
When a defendant enters a plea of no contest, they waive the right to
challenge the sufficiency of the evidence on appeal. This means that the
defendant cannot appeal the judgment on the grounds that the evidence was
insufficient to support the conviction. The plea of no contest is treated
similarly to a guilty plea in this context, and it waives all non-jurisdictional
defenses.

State v. Morse, 903 S.W.2d 100 (Tex. App. 1995)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Under Article 4.03, appeal by a defendant to this Court from trial de novo is
available only when the sole issue is the constitutionality of the statute or
ordinance on which the conviction is based, or when the fine assessed by the
county court exceeds $100. ... In the case of an appeal from the Midland
Municipal Court of Record, the defendant has the right to appeal to this
Court only if the fine assessed against the defendant exceeds $100 and the
judgment is affirmed by the appellate court. TEX.GOV'T CODE ANN. §
30.246 (Vernon 1988); see also Ex parte Brand, 822 S.W.2d at 636, 639 n. 3.
Summary
Conditions under which a defendant can appeal a municipal court decision
in Texas. Specifically, it states that an appeal is possible if the fine exceeds
$100 or if the constitutionality of the statute is in question. In the current
case, the fines for each offense exceed $100, which provides a basis for
appeal.

Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The county court issued a written opinion and judgment affirming the
judgments of the municipal court. See Tex. Gov't Code § 30.00024(a), (c);
see also id. § 30.00014(b); Tex. Crim. Proc. Code art. 45.042(b). Proceeding
pro se, appellant now appeals to this court. See Tex. Gov't Code §
30.00027(a) (defendant convicted in municipal court of record may appeal to
court of appeals if fine assessed against defendant exceeds $100 and county
court affirms municipal court's judgment).
Summary
A defendant convicted in a municipal court of record in Texas may appeal to
the court of appeals if the fine assessed against the defendant exceeds $100
and the county court affirms the municipal court's judgment. This is relevant
to the current situation because the fines assessed in the judgments against
Ryan Sterling Myers exceed $100, making them eligible for appeal under
the conditions described.
Sultan v. Mathew, 178 S.W.3d 747 (Tex. 2005)

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
An appeal or Writ of Error may be taken to the Court of Appeals from every
final judgment of the district court in civil cases, and from every final
judgment in the county court in civil cases of which the county court has
original jurisdiction, and from every final judgment of the county court in
civil cases in which the court has appellate jurisdiction, where the judgment
or amount in controversy exceeds one hundred dollars exclusive of interest
and costs.
Summary
In Texas, an appeal can be taken from a final judgment in civil cases if the
amount in controversy exceeds $100, exclusive of interest and costs. This
suggests that the judgments in question, which involve fines exceeding
$100, may be eligible for appeal to the Court of Appeals, provided other
procedural requirements are met.
Ex parte Minjares, 582 S.W.2d 105 (Tex. Crim. App. 1978)
Texas Court of Criminal Appeals
Extract
Petitioner was ordered committed to the El Paso county jail in default of the
fines adjudged against him. There he served sixty-two days of jail time,
receiving credit toward his judgments at the rate of $5.00 per day, totaling
$310.00. In addition, the sheriff of El Paso County, pursuant to V.A.T.S.,
Article 5118a, purported to commute one third of petitioner&#39;s sentence
at the rate of $2.50 per day, totaling $155.00. On November 10, 1977,
petitioner filed his application for writ of habeas corpus alleging that he had
satisfied the judgments against him and was entitled to be discharged.
Summary
The case discusses the application of jail time credit towards fines in
municipal court judgments. The petitioner in the case sought relief through
a writ of habeas corpus, arguing that he had satisfied the judgments against
him through jail time credit. The court's decision provides insight into how
jail time credit is applied and the limitations of such credits in municipal
court cases. This information is relevant for understanding potential
avenues for challenging judgments related to fines and jail time in Texas.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
Appeal is perfected in a criminal case by giving timely notice of appeal;
except, it is unnecessary to give notice of appeal in death penalty cases.
Notice of appeal shall be given in writing filed with the clerk of the trial
court. Such notice shall be sufficient if it shows the desire of the defendant
to appeal from the judgment or other appealable order; but if the judgment
was rendered upon his plea of guilty or nolo contendere pursuant to Article
1.15, Code of Criminal Procedure, and the punishment assessed does not
exceed the punishment recommended by the prosecutor and agreed to by
the defendant and his attorney, in order to prosecute an appeal for a
nonjurisdictional defect or error that occurred prior to entry of the plea the
notice shall state that the trial court granted permission to appeal or shall
specify that those matters were raised by written motion and ruled on
before trial.
Summary
In Texas, to appeal a criminal case judgment, a defendant must file a written
notice of appeal with the trial court's clerk. This notice must express the
defendant's desire to appeal. However, if the judgment was based on a plea
of guilty or nolo contendere, and the punishment does not exceed what was
agreed upon, the notice must indicate that the trial court granted
permission to appeal or that the issues were raised and ruled on before trial.
This is crucial for appealing nonjurisdictional defects or errors that occurred
before the plea.
Ex parte Williams, 703 S.W.2d 674 (Tex. Crim. App. 1986)
Texas Court of Criminal Appeals
Extract
Ex parte Burns, 133 Tex.Cr.R. 77, 109 S.W.2d 211 (1937), made clear that
when the trial court has jurisdiction to render judgment and the law affords
a remedy by appeal the court cannot in habeas corpus proceedings inquire
into questions of the sufficiency of the evidence upon which the judgment
was rendered. A study of the cases supporting the above general rule shows
that it has been applied or intended to apply across the board to all types of
criminal cases, whether the offense be a felony or misdemeanor or whether
the trial be before the court or jury, and whether the plea is one of not guilty,
guilty, or nolo contendere.
Summary
In Texas, once a trial court has jurisdiction and a judgment is rendered, the
sufficiency of the evidence cannot be challenged through habeas corpus if
an appeal was available. This applies to all criminal cases, including those
where a plea of nolo contendere (no contest) was entered. Therefore, the

=== PAGE 15 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
passage suggests that challenging the sufficiency of the evidence on appeal
may not be a viable option if the judgment was rendered with jurisdiction
and the opportunity for appeal was available.
Montpas v. State, 997 S.W.2d 650 (Tex. App. 1999)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The Courts of Appeals shall have appellate jurisdiction coextensive with the
limits of their respective districts in all criminal cases except those in which
the death penalty has been assessed. This Article shall not be so construed
as to embrace any case which has been appealed from any inferior court to
the county court, the county criminal court, or county court at law, in which
the fine imposed by the county court, the county criminal court or county
court at law does not exceed one hundred dollars, unless the sole issue is
the constitutionality of the statute or ordinance on which the conviction is
based.
Summary
The Texas Courts of Appeals have limited jurisdiction over cases appealed
from municipal courts to county courts when the fine does not exceed one
hundred dollars. The exception to this limitation is if the appeal is based on
the constitutionality of the statute or ordinance under which the conviction
was made. This means that for fines exceeding one hundred dollars, such as
those in the current case, the appellate court may have jurisdiction, but the
appeal must be based on grounds other than the amount of the fine, such as
procedural errors or constitutional issues.

Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
We also lack jurisdiction over this appeal because, in a plea-bargain case, a
defendant may only appeal those matters that were raised by written motion
filed and ruled on before trial or after getting the trial court's permission to
appeal. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 44.02; Tex.R.App.P. 25.2(a)(2). An appeal
must be dismissed if a certification showing that the defendant has the right
of appeal has not been made part of the record. Tex.R.App.P. 25.2(d); see
Dears v. State, 154 S.W.3d 610, 613 (Tex. Crim. App. 2005). Here, the clerk's
record supports the trial court's certification that this is a plea-bargain case
and that appellant has no right of appeal.

=== PAGE 16 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
In Texas, a defendant in a plea-bargain case can only appeal matters that
were raised by a written motion filed and ruled on before trial or if the trial
court grants permission to appeal. Additionally, an appeal must be dismissed
if there is no certification showing the defendant's right to appeal. This
means that if Ryan Sterling Myers entered a plea of "No Contest" as part of
a plea bargain, his options to appeal are limited unless he meets these
specific conditions.
Carr v. State, NO. 01-18-00880-CR (Tex. App. Dec 13, 2018)

Extract
A person convicted of an offense in a municipal court of record may appeal
that conviction to a county criminal court. TEX. GOV'T CODE ANN. §
30.00014(a) (West Supp. 2018). The county criminal court may not retry the
case but determines the appeal on the basis of any errors shown in the
municipal court record. See id. § 30.00014(b); Swain v. State, 319 S.W.3d
878, 879 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2010, no pet.). The county criminal court
may affirm, reverse, or reform the municipal court's judgment. TEX. GOV'T
CODE ANN. § 30.00024(a) (West Supp. 2018); see Alexander v. State, 240
S.W.3d 72, 74 (Tex. App.—Austin 2007, no pet.). The defendant may then
appeal to the court of appeals if (1) the county criminal court affirms the
municipal court's judgment and the fine assessed against the defendant
exceeds $100, or (2) the sole issue is the constitutionality of the statute or
ordinance on which a conviction is based. TEX. GOV'T CODE ANN. §
30.00027(a) (West Supp. 2018); see Flores v. State, 462 S.W.3d 551, 552
(Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2015, no pet.).
Summary
A person convicted in a municipal court of record in Texas can appeal to a
county criminal court. The county criminal court will not retry the case but
will review it for any errors in the municipal court record. If the county
criminal court affirms the municipal court's judgment and the fine exceeds
$100, or if the appeal is based on the constitutionality of the statute, the
defendant can further appeal to the court of appeals. This information is
directly relevant to understanding the appeal process for the judgments in
question.

Unless the sole issue is the constitutionality of the statute or ordinance on
which the conviction is based, we only have jurisdiction over such an appeal
from a county criminal court at law if (1) the fine assessed against appellant
exceeds $100 and (2) if the judgment is affirmed by the appellate court.
TEX.CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN. art. 4.03 (Vernon Supp.2004); TEX. GOV'T
CODE ANN. § 30.00027(a) (Vernon 2004).
Summary
For an appeal to be considered from a municipal court of record in Texas,
the fine must exceed $100, and the judgment must be affirmed by the
appellate court. This is relevant to the current situation as the fines in the
judgments for the traffic offenses exceed $100, which means they meet one
of the criteria for appeal. However, the passage also indicates that the
appeal must be based on specific grounds, such as the constitutionality of
the statute or ordinance, or errors in the trial process.
Swain v. State, 319 S.W.3d 878 (Tex. App. 2010)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
A person convicted of an offense in a municipal court of record may appeal
that conviction to a county criminal court. Id. § 30.00014(a). The county
criminal court may not retry the case; instead, it must determine the appeal
on the basis of the errors shown in the municipal court record. Id. §
30.00014(b) (“An appeal from the municipal court of record may not be by
trial de novo.”) (emphasis added). The county criminal court may affirm,
reverse, or reform the municipal court's judgment. Id. § 30.00024(a);
Alexander v. State, 240 S.W.3d 72, 74 (Tex.App.-Austin 2007, no pet.). The
defendant may then appeal to the court of appeals if the county criminal
court affirms the municipal court's judgment and if the fine assessed against
the defendant exceeds $100. Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 30.00027(a).
Summary
A defendant convicted in a municipal court of record in Texas can appeal to
a county criminal court. The county criminal court will not conduct a new
trial but will review the case based on the municipal court record. If the
county criminal court affirms the municipal court's judgment, the defendant
can further appeal to the court of appeals if the fine exceeds $100. This is
relevant because the fines in the judgments in question exceed $100,
making them eligible for appeal to the court of appeals.

=== PAGE 18 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Texas Court of Criminal Appeals
Extract
In construing Articles 44.08 and 42.02, supra, together, we conclude in the
instant case that the reasoning in McIntosh and Weston is here applicable.
We hold, therefore, that in misdemeanor cases where the maximum possible
punishment is by fine only, the notice of appeal to the Court of Criminal
Appeals must be given within ten days after the entry of the judgment if no
motions for new trial are timely filed. If a motion or amended motion for new
trial is timely and properly filed, then notice of appeal shall be given within
ten days after the overruling of the motion or amended motion for new trial.
Summary
In misdemeanor cases in Texas where the punishment is by fine only, the
notice of appeal must be given within ten days after the entry of the
judgment if no motions for a new trial are filed. If a motion for a new trial is
filed, the notice of appeal must be given within ten days after the motion is
overruled. This provides a clear timeline for when an appeal must be filed in
such cases.

Generally, a defendant in a criminal case must file his notice of appeal within
thirty days of the date of the appealed judgment, or if a motion for new trial
is filed, within ninety days of the judgment. TEX. R. APP. P. 26.2(a).
Summary
In Texas, a defendant must file a notice of appeal within thirty days of the
judgment in a criminal case. If a motion for a new trial is filed, this period
extends to ninety days. This rule is applicable to all criminal cases in Texas,
including the ones mentioned in the question.

entered. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art 44.14(b) (Vernon Supp. 1998).
Under article 27.14(b), however, a defendant charged with a misdemeanor
for which the maximum possible punishment is a fine may file a letter with
the justice or municipal court as an alternative to the ten day rule. The
defendant may mail or deliver in person to the court a plea of guilty or nolo
contendere and a waiver of jury trial. If the plea and waiver are received by
the court before the defendant's scheduled court date, then the court shall
dispose of the case and notify the defendant of the fine amount and, if
requested, the amount of the appeal bond. The defendant shall pay any fine
assessed or give an appeal bond in the amount stated in the notice before
the thirty-first day after receiving the notice. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art.
27.14(b) (Vernon Supp. 1998).
Summary
In Texas, to appeal a judgment from a municipal court, a defendant must file
an appeal bond with the court that tried the case within ten days of the
judgment. Alternatively, under article 27.14(b), a defendant can file a plea
and waiver before the court date, and then pay the fine or file an appeal
bond within thirty-one days of receiving notice of the fine. This information
is crucial for understanding the procedural requirements for appealing a
municipal court judgment in Texas.
Chapa v. State, No. 05-19-00609-CR (Tex. App. Mar 09, 2020)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
To perfect an appeal from a municipal court conviction, an appellant must
file a written motion for new trial with the municipal clerk setting forth the
points of error of which appellant complains. See TEX. GOV'T CODE ANN. §
30.00014(c). To preserve a point of error in an appeal from a municipal
court, the appellant must raise the identical point in the motion for new
trial.
Summary
To challenge a municipal court conviction in Texas, the appellant must file a
written motion for a new trial with the municipal clerk. This motion must
clearly set forth the points of error the appellant is complaining about.
Furthermore, to preserve these points of error for appeal, they must be
identical to those raised in the motion for a new trial. This process is
governed by the Texas Government Code, which provides the procedural
requirements for appealing municipal court convictions.

Summary
To challenge a municipal court judgment on appeal, a defendant must have
raised the claim of error in a motion for a new trial, and the record must
show that the same claim was raised before the municipal court. This is a
procedural requirement to preserve the issue for appellate review.
Additionally, the passage indicates that further appellate review with a court
of appeals is possible under certain circumstances, as outlined in the Texas

Arias v. State, 477 S.W.3d 925 (Tex. App. 2015)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
When a person convicted of an offense in a municipal court of record
appeals that conviction to a county criminal court, the county criminal court
must determine the appeal on the basis of any errors shown in the municipal
court record. Tex. Gov't Code § 30.00014(b) ('An appeal from the municipal
court of record may not be by trial de novo.'). The county criminal court may
affirm, reverse, or reform the municipal court's judgment. Id. § 30.00024(a);
Swain v. State, 319 S.W.3d 878, 879 (Tex.App.–Fort Worth 2010, no pet). The
defendant may then appeal to the court of appeals if the county criminal
court affirms the municipal court's judgment and if the fine assessed against
the defendant exceeds $100. Tex. Gov't Code § 30.00027(a); Swain, 319 S.W.
3d at 879. Our review in such a case is limited to those issues considered by
the county criminal court. See Tex. Gov't Code § 30.00027(b)(1) (setting
forth requirement that in an appeal from a municipal court of record, the
record and briefs from the appeal to the county court constitute the record
and briefs at the court of appeals).
Summary
In Texas, when appealing a conviction from a municipal court of record, the
appeal to a county criminal court is based on errors in the municipal court
record, not a new trial. The county criminal court can affirm, reverse, or
reform the judgment. If the county court affirms the judgment and the fine

exceeds $100, the defendant can appeal to the court of appeals. The review
at the court of appeals is limited to issues considered by the county criminal
court.

Texas Court of Criminal Appeals
Extract
A defendant in any criminal action has the right of appeal under the rules
hereinafter prescribed; provided, however, before the defendant who has
been convicted upon either his plea of guilty or plea of nolo contendere
before the court and the court, upon the election of the defendant, assesses
punishment and the punishment does not exceed the punishment
recommended by the prosecutor and agreed to by the defendant and his
attorney may prosecute his appeal, he must have permission of the trial
court, except on those matters which have been raised by written motion
filed prior to trial.
Summary
A defendant who has entered a plea of nolo contendere (no contest) and has
been convicted can appeal the judgment under certain conditions.
Specifically, the defendant must have the trial court's permission to appeal
unless the appeal concerns matters raised by a written motion filed before
the trial. This suggests that if Ryan Sterling Myers wishes to appeal the
judgments, he would need to seek the trial court's permission unless there
were pre-trial motions that could be the basis for an appeal.

may appeal that conviction to a county court or county court at law.
Tex.Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 44.02 (West 2006) (municipal courts and
justice of the peace courts); Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 30.00014(a) (West Supp.

court of record, the county court may not retry the case; instead, it must
determine the appeal on the basis of the errors shown in the municipal court
record.
Summary
A person convicted in a municipal court of record in Texas can appeal the
conviction to a county court or county court at law. The appeal is typically by
trial de novo, meaning the case is retried, but if the appeal is from a
municipal court of record, the county court must determine the appeal
based on errors in the municipal court record. This means that the appellant
must identify specific errors in the municipal court proceedings to have
grounds for an appeal.

Summary
To challenge the judgments on appeal, an appeal bond must be filed with the
justice or judge who tried the case within 10 days after the judgment was
entered. This is a procedural requirement to perfect an appeal, and failure
to meet this deadline means the appellate court will not have jurisdiction
over the case.
Tex. Code Crim. Proc. § 44.17 Tex. Code Crim. Proc. § 44.17 Appeal to
County Court, How Conducted
Extract
In all appeals to a county court from justice courts and municipal courts
other than municipal courts of record, the trial shall be de novo in the trial
in the county court, the same as if the prosecution had been originally
commenced in that court. An appeal to the county court from a municipal
court of record may be based only on errors reflected in the record.
Summary
Procedure for appealing judgments from justice courts and municipal courts
in Texas. If the appeal is from a municipal court that is not a court of record,
the trial in the county court will be de novo, meaning it will be as if the case
is being tried for the first time. However, if the appeal is from a municipal
court of record, the appeal can only be based on errors that are reflected in
the record of the original trial. This means that for the cases in question, if
they were from a municipal court of record, the appeal would need to focus
on any legal errors that occurred during the original proceedings.
Tex. Code Crim. Proc. § 45A.204 Tex. Code Crim. Proc. § 45A.204 Effect of
Appeal
Extract
All further proceedings in the case in the justice or municipal court must
cease when a defendant files the appeal bond required by law with the
justice or municipal court.
Summary
Once a defendant files the appeal bond required by law, all further
proceedings in the case in the justice or municipal court must cease. This
indicates that filing an appeal bond is a critical step in the appeal process,
and it effectively halts any further actions in the lower court regarding the
case.

what was recommended by the prosecutor and agreed to by the defendant
and his attorney, the defendant must have permission from the trial court to

Extract
An appeal from a justice or municipal court, including an appeal from a final
judgment in a bond forfeiture proceeding, shall be heard by the county court
or, if the county court has no jurisdiction over the case, the proper court in
the county. A de novo trial shall be held on appeal unless the appeal is: taken
from a municipal court of record; and based on error reflected in the record.
Summary
An appeal from a municipal court judgment in Texas can be heard by the
county court. The appeal will generally result in a de novo trial unless it is
from a municipal court of record and based on an error reflected in the
record. This means that if the municipal court is not a court of record, the
appellant can expect a new trial in the county court. If the municipal court is
a court of record, the appeal must be based on an error in the record.

Tex. Gov't. Code § 30.00162 Tex. Gov't. Code § 30.00162 Disposition On
Appeal; Presumptions; Decision
Extract
The appellate court may: affirm the judgment of the municipal court of
record; reverse and remand for a new trial; reverse and dismiss the case;
reform and correct the judgment; abate the appeal or dismiss the appeal; or
enter any other appropriate order, as the law and the nature of the case
require.
Summary
The appellate court has several options when reviewing a case from a
municipal court of record. These options include affirming the judgment,
reversing and remanding for a new trial, reversing and dismissing the case,
reforming and correcting the judgment, abating or dismissing the appeal, or
entering any other appropriate order. This provides a broad range of
potential outcomes for an appeal, depending on the specifics of the case and
any errors or issues identified in the original trial.
Tex. Gov't. Code § 30.00014 Tex. Gov't. Code § 30.00014 Appeal
Extract
To perfect an appeal, the appellant must file a written motion for new trial
with the municipal clerk not later than the 10th day after the date on which
judgment is rendered. The motion must set forth the points of error of which
the appellant complains. The motion or an amended motion may be
amended by leave of court at any time before action on the motion is taken,
but not later than the 20th day after the date on which the original or
amended motion is filed. The court may for good cause extend the time for
filing or amending, but the extension may not exceed 90 days from the
original filing deadline. If the court does not act on the motion before the
expiration of the 30 days allowed for determination of the motion, the
original or amended motion is overruled by operation of law.
Summary
To challenge the judgments on appeal, the defendant must file a written
motion for a new trial with the municipal clerk within 10 days of the
judgment date. The motion should specify the points of error. The motion
can be amended with court approval before the court acts on it, but not later
than 20 days after the original motion is filed. The court can extend the
filing or amending period for good cause, but not beyond 90 days from the
original deadline. If the court does not act on the motion within 30 days, it is
overruled by law.

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. § 44.01 Tex. Code Crim. Proc. § 44.01 Appeal By State
Extract
Nothing in this article is to interfere with the defendant's right to appeal
under the procedures of Article CODE OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE 44.02.
The defendant's right to appeal under Article CODE OF CRIMINAL
PROCEDURE 44.02 may be prosecuted by the defendant where the
punishment assessed is in accordance with Subchapter C, Chapter 42A, as
well as any other punishment assessed in compliance with Article CODE OF
CRIMINAL PROCEDURE 44.02.
Summary
The defendant retains the right to appeal under Article 44.02 of the Texas
Code of Criminal Procedure. This right is not interfered with by the
provisions of Article 44.01, which primarily addresses the state's right to
appeal. Therefore, the defendant can pursue an appeal if the punishment
assessed is in accordance with the relevant legal provisions.
Tex. Transp. Code § 502.473 Tex. Transp. Code § 502.473 Operation of
Vehicle Without Registration Insignia
Extract
A court may dismiss a charge brought under Subsection (a) if the defendant
pays a reimbursement fee not to exceed $10 and: remedies the defect before
the defendant's first court appearance; or shows that the motor vehicle was
issued a registration insignia by the department that was attached to the
motor vehicle, establishing that the vehicle was registered for the period
during which the offense was committed.
Summary
The Texas Transportation Code provides a potential remedy for dismissing a
charge related to operating a vehicle without a properly displayed
registration insignia. If the defendant can show that they remedied the
defect before their first court appearance or that the vehicle was indeed
registered for the period in question, the court may dismiss the charge upon
payment of a reimbursement fee not exceeding $10. This provision is
applicable to cases involving the operation of a vehicle without a properly
displayed registration insignia.
Tex. Gov't. Code § 30.00027 Tex. Gov't. Code § 30.00027 Appeals to Court of
Appeals

=== PAGE 27 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
The appellant has the right to appeal to the court of appeals if: the fine
assessed against the defendant exceeds $100 and the judgment is affirmed
by the appellate court; or the sole issue is the constitutionality of the statute
or ordinance on which a conviction is based.
Summary
The passage provides two specific conditions under which an appeal to the
court of appeals is permissible: (1) if the fine assessed exceeds $100 and the
judgment is affirmed by the appellate court, or (2) if the sole issue on appeal
is the constitutionality of the statute or ordinance on which the conviction is
based. Since the fines in the cases mentioned exceed $100, the first
condition is met, allowing for an appeal. Additionally, if there is a
constitutional issue with the statute or ordinance, that could also be a basis
for appeal.
Tex. Code Crim. Proc. § 27.14 Tex. Code Crim. Proc. § 27.14 Plea of Guilty
Or Nolo Contendere In Misdemeanor
Extract
A plea of 'guilty' or a plea of 'nolo contendere' in a misdemeanor case may
be made either by the defendant or his counsel in open court; in such case,
the defendant or his counsel may waive a jury, and the punishment may be
assessed by the court either upon or without evidence, at the discretion of
the court... In a misdemeanor case for which the maximum possible
punishment is by fine only, payment of a fine or an amount accepted by the
court constitutes a finding of guilty in open court as though a plea of nolo
contendere had been entered by the defendant and constitutes a waiver of a
jury trial in writing.
Summary
Entering a plea of "nolo contendere" (no contest) in a misdemeanor case,
where the maximum punishment is a fine, results in a finding of guilt and a
waiver of the right to a jury trial. The payment of the fine further solidifies
this finding of guilt as if the plea had been entered in open court. This
means that the defendant has limited options to challenge the judgment on
appeal, as the plea and payment constitute an acceptance of the judgment.
Tex. Code Crim. Proc. § 42.111 Tex. Code Crim. Proc. § 42.111 Deferral of
Proceedings In Cases Appealed to County Court

=== PAGE 28 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
If a defendant convicted of a misdemeanor punishable by fine only appeals
the conviction to a county court, on the trial in county court the defendant
may enter a plea of guilty or nolo contendere to the offense. If the defendant
enters a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, the court may defer further
proceedings without entering an adjudication of guilt in the same manner as
provided for the deferral of proceedings in justice court or municipal court
under Subchapter G, Chapter 45A. This article does not apply to a
misdemeanor case disposed of under Subchapter B, Chapter 543,
Transportation Code, or a serious traffic violation as defined by Section
Transportation Code 522.003, Transportation Code.
Summary
A defendant convicted of a misdemeanor punishable by fine only can appeal
the conviction to a county court. During the trial in the county court, the
defendant may enter a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, and the court may
defer further proceedings without entering an adjudication of guilt.
However, this option does not apply to cases disposed of under Subchapter
B, Chapter 543, Transportation Code, or serious traffic violations as defined
by Section 522.003, Transportation Code. This means that if the offenses in
question fall under these exceptions, the option to defer proceedings may
not be available.
Tex. Gov't. Code § 30.00015 Tex. Gov't. Code § 30.00015 Appeal Bond
Extract
If the defendant is not in custody, the defendant may not take an appeal until
the defendant files an appeal bond with the municipal court of record. The
bond must be approved by the court and must be filed not later than the
10th day after the date on which the motion for new trial is overruled. If the
defendant is in custody, the defendant shall be committed to jail unless the
defendant posts the appeal bond. The appeal bond must be in the amount of
$100 or double the amount of the fines and costs adjudged against the
defendant, whichever is greater. The bond must: state that the defendant
was convicted in the case and has appealed; and be conditioned on the
defendant's immediate and daily personal appearance in the court to which
the appeal is taken.
Summary
In order to appeal a municipal court judgment in Texas, a defendant who is
not in custody must file an appeal bond with the municipal court of record.
This bond must be approved by the court and filed within 10 days after the
motion for a new trial is overruled. The bond amount must be $100 or
double the fines and costs, whichever is greater. The bond must state the

conviction and appeal and require the defendant's immediate and daily
appearance in the appellate court.
Tex. Gov't. Code § 30.00147 Tex. Gov't. Code § 30.00147 Perfecting Appeal
Extract
A defendant, as a condition of perfecting an appeal to the appellate court,
must file an appeal bond, unless the defendant is in custody. An appeal may
be perfected by timely filing with the municipal court clerk an appeal bond
that meets the requirements of Subchapter A. It is not necessary to file a
notice of appeal. If the defendant is in custody, the appeal is perfected when
notice of appeal is given as provided by Article Code of Criminal Procedure
44.13, Code of Criminal Procedure. ... The appeal bond must be filed not
later than the 10th day after overruling of the motion or amended motion for
new trial, or if there is no motion or amended motion for new trial, not later
than the 10th day after the rendition of the judgment of conviction. ... For
good cause shown, not later than the 100th day after the date of rendition of
the judgment of conviction, the appellate court or the court of appeals may
permit the filing of an appeal bond or the giving of notice of appeal in the
municipal court of record even though the time limits set under this section
have expired.
Summary
To challenge the judgments on appeal, the defendant must file an appeal
bond within specific time limits. The appeal bond must be filed not later than
the 10th day after the judgment of conviction if no motion for a new trial is
filed. However, for good cause, the appellate court may allow the filing of an
appeal bond up to the 100th day after the judgment. This provides a
potential avenue for appeal even if the initial time limits have passed,
provided there is good cause.
Tex. Gov't. Code § 30.00024 Tex. Gov't. Code § 30.00024 Disposition On
Appeal
Extract
According to the law and the nature of the case, the appellate court may:
affirm the judgment of the municipal court of record; reverse and remand
for a new trial; reverse and dismiss the case; or reform and correct the
judgment.
Summary
The appellate court has several options when considering an appeal from a
municipal court of record. These options include affirming the judgment,
reversing and remanding for a new trial, reversing and dismissing the case,

or reforming and correcting the judgment. This provides a framework for
understanding the potential outcomes of an appeal and the avenues
available for challenging the judgments.
Pretrial Motions
Texas Criminal Lawyer's Handbook. Volume 1 - 2021 - James

Extract
When a defendant enters an open plea of guilty to an offense, he waives the
right to appeal any nonjurisdictional defects, other than the voluntariness of
his plea, which occurred before entry of the plea. Flowers v. State, 935 S.W.
2d 131 (Tex. Crim. App. 1996).
Summary
When a defendant enters a plea of guilty or no contest, they generally waive
the right to appeal any nonjurisdictional defects that occurred before the
entry of the plea. The only exception to this waiver is if the defendant can
demonstrate that their plea was not entered voluntarily. This means that in
the case of Ryan Sterling Myers, since he entered a plea of no contest, he
has waived the right to appeal any nonjurisdictional issues unless he can
show that his plea was involuntary.

Summary
When a defendant enters a plea of guilty or no contest, they generally waive
the right to appeal any nonjurisdictional defects that occurred before the
plea, except for issues related to the voluntariness of the plea. This means
that the defendant's options for appeal are limited to challenging the
voluntariness of the plea or any jurisdictional issues.

CHAPTER 5 Interlocutory Appeals
Practitioner's Guide to Civil Appeals in Texas - Full Court Press
Extract
An issue that continues to brew in Texas jurisprudence is whether a party
who did not utilize his right to appeal on an interlocutory basis may
challenge the interlocutory order after final judgment. Section 51.014(a) of
the Texas Civil Practice & Remedies Code provides that a person 'may'
appeal from one of the listed interlocutory orders. The Texas Supreme Court
has construed this language to mean interlocutory appeal is permitted but
not mandated—sometimes. Specifically, in Hernandez v. Ebrom, a defendant-
doctor failed to challenge the adequacy of the plaintiff's expert report by
interlocutory appeal, as permitted by Section 51.014(a), and instead waited
to raise it in his appeal from the final judgment. The Supreme Court
concluded that the defendant's failure to pursue an interlocutory appeal did
not waive his complaints about the expert report.
Summary
In Texas, a party may still challenge certain interlocutory orders after a final
judgment, even if they did not appeal them on an interlocutory basis. This
suggests that there might be an opportunity to appeal the final judgment of
the traffic offenses, even though the fines have been paid, if there are
grounds to challenge the underlying orders or procedures.
Post-Trial Issues
Texas Criminal Lawyer's Handbook. Volume 2 - 2021 - James
Publishing - Mark G. Daniel, Robert K. Gill - 2021-08-16
Extract
A trial court is not required to issue a writ of habeas corpus unless the
applicant has no adequate remedy at law. Ex parte Weise, 55 S.W.3d 617
(Tex. Crim. App. 2001). A refusal to issue a writ after a hearing on whether
to issue the writ or not is not appealable. Appeal does not lie unless a writ
issued and relief was denied. Ex parte Hargett, 819 S.W.2d 866 (Tex. Crim.
App. 1991). Applicant does not have the right to appeal the trial court’s
ruling unless the trial court actually ruled on the merits of the applicant’s
claim. Ex parte Gonzales, 12 S.W.3d 913 (Tex.App.—Austin 2000, pet. ref’d).
If the trial court declined to issue a writ of habeas corpus but proceeded to
rule on the merits of applicant’s petition, there, notwithstanding the refusal
to issue the writ, and not having dismissed the application, he, in effect has
ruled on it and the Court of Appeals has jurisdiction over applicant’s appeal.
Hargett v. State, Tex Cr, 819 S.W.2d 860 (1991) on remand 827 S.W.2d 606.

Summary
The passage provides insight into the appeal process concerning writs of
habeas corpus in Texas. It explains that an appeal is only possible if a writ
was issued and relief was denied, or if the trial court ruled on the merits of
the applicant's claim. This information is relevant to understanding the
potential avenues for appeal in the context of the judgments against Ryan
Sterling Myers.

A plea bargaining defendant can challenge the trial court’s jurisdiction
through an application for writ of habeas corpus. Ex parte Lockett, 956 S.W.
2d 41 (Tex. Crim. App. 1997).
Summary
The passage provides insight into one potential avenue for challenging the
judgments: filing an application for a writ of habeas corpus to challenge the
trial court's jurisdiction. This is applicable even in cases where a plea
bargain has been entered, as indicated by the reference to Ex parte Lockett.

Extract
A defendant in a criminal case has the right of appeal under Code of
Criminal Procedure article 44.02 and these rules. The trial court shall enter
a certification of the defendant’s right of appeal each time it enters a
judgment of guilt or other appealable order.
Summary
A defendant in a criminal case in Texas has the right to appeal a judgment of
guilt under the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure article 44.02. This right is
applicable to any criminal case where a judgment of guilt is entered, and the
trial court is required to certify the defendant's right to appeal. This means
that even though the fines have been paid, the defendant still retains the
right to appeal the judgments if they believe there was an error in the
proceedings or the judgment.

Misdemeanor Defense
Texas Small-Firm Practice Tools. Volume 1-2 - James Publishing -

Extract
A defendant can request a hearing to establish whether the fines and costs
in a particular case impose an undue hardship on him. [Tex. Code Crim. Pro.
Art. 43.035] Under CCP Art. 102.073, when the State tries a defendant in a
single criminal action for multiple offenses, a court may assess fees and
costs against a defendant only for the offense of the highest category.
Summary
There are potential grounds for appeal or post-judgment relief in cases
involving multiple offenses. Specifically, if the defendant was tried for
multiple offenses in a single action, the court should only assess fees and
costs for the highest category offense. Additionally, if the fines and costs
impose an undue hardship, the defendant can request a hearing to address
this issue. These insights suggest potential avenues for challenging the
judgments or seeking relief, even after fines have been paid.
Restricted Appeals In Texas
Extract
A restricted appeal is a direct attack on a judgment. To be entitled to a
restricted appeal, an appellant must demonstrate several elements
described below. What is necessary to bring a restricted appeal in a Texas
court? To attack a trial court's judgment by restricted appeal, a party must
show that: * a notice of appeal was filed within six months of the date that
the complained-of judgment was signed; * the filer was a party to the suit
that did not participate in the hearing that resulted in the judgment or
