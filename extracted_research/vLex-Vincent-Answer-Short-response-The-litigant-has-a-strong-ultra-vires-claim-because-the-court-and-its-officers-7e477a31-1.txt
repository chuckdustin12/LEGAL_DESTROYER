Question
Answer Short response The litigant has a strong ultra vires claim because
the court and its officers allegedly acted outside their statutory and
constitutional authority—such as issuing orders without required hearings,
findings, or proper judicial authority—rendering those actions void under
Texas law. Texas statutes and binding precedent confirm that actions taken
without legal authority, especially in violation of procedural safeguards like
recusal, due process, and statutory prerequisites, are ultra vires and subject
to challenge. Summary Under Texas law, an ultra vires claim arises when a
government official, including a judge, acts beyond the scope of their legal
authority or fails to perform a mandatory, non-discretionary duty. In this
case, the Respondent alleges a series of actions—including deprivation of
property without a hearing, orders issued during pending recusal,
fraudulent or unauthorized filings, and denial of statutory rights—that, if
substantiated, would constitute ultra vires conduct because they violate
explicit statutory requirements and due process protections. The Texas
Family Code and Government Code set clear procedural and substantive
limits on judicial authority, particularly regarding protective orders, recusal,
and the issuance of orders. Texas appellate and Supreme Court decisions
reinforce that actions taken in violation of these statutes—such as issuing
orders without a hearing or while recusal is pending—are void and ultra
vires. The Respondent’s allegations, if proven, fit squarely within the legal
framework for an ultra vires claim, entitling him to seek prospective relief to
restrain further unauthorized conduct and restore his due process rights.
Background and Relevant Law Legislative Framework 1. Protective Orders
and Due Process Requirements Texas Family Code § 85.001 requires that,
before issuing a protective order, the court must conduct a hearing and
make an affirmative finding that family violence has occurred. Only after
such findings can the court issue a protective order, including orders for
exclusive possession of a residence under § 85.021, which further specifies
the conditions under which a party may be ordered to vacate a residence.
These provisions are designed to protect due process rights and ensure that
significant deprivations—such as loss of residence—are not imposed without
proper legal process and findings. If a court issues a protective order
without conducting the required hearing and making the necessary findings,
it acts beyond its statutory authority, rendering the order void and ultra
vires, see Tex. Fam. Code § 85.001. 2. Right to De Novo Hearing Texas
Family Code § 201.015 grants parties the right to request a de novo hearing
before the referring court after an associate judge’s order, provided the
request is timely. Denial of this right, or failure to act on a timely request,
exceeds the court’s statutory authority and constitutes an ultra vires act, as
the statute explicitly provides this procedural safeguard, see Tex. Fam. Code
§ 201.015. 3. Recusal and Disqualification Procedures Texas Government
Code § 29.055 requires that, upon the filing of a motion for recusal or
disqualification, a judge must either recuse themselves or refer the motion
to the regional presiding judge and refrain from taking further action in the
case until the motion is resolved, except for good cause stated in the order.
Any action taken in violation of these requirements is beyond the judge’s
legal authority and is considered ultra vires, see Tex. Gov't. Code § 29.055.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
4. Powers of Associate Judges Texas Family Code § 201.007 and § 201.104
limit the authority of associate judges. An associate judge may only render
and sign certain types of orders, and only the referring court may rule on
postjudgment relief. Actions outside these boundaries are ultra vires, see
Tex. Fam. Code § 201.007; Tex. Fam. Code § 201.104. 5. Unauthorized
Practice of Law Texas Government Code §§ 81.101, 81.102, 81.104, 83.004,
and 83.006 collectively prohibit the unauthorized practice of law and
provide mechanisms for challenging such conduct. Only members of the
state bar may practice law in Texas, and violations can be enjoined by a
court, see Tex. Gov't. Code §§ 81.101, 81.102, 81.104, 83.004, 83.006. 6.
Fraudulent Documents and Orders Texas Government Code §§ 51.901 and
51.902 provide mechanisms for challenging fraudulent documents and
orders, supporting the argument that actions taken without legal authority,
such as fraudulent or unauthorized orders, are void and ultra vires, see Tex.
Gov't. Code §§ 51.901, 51.902. Case Law 1. Ultra Vires Doctrine in Texas The
Texas Supreme Court and Courts of Appeals have consistently held that an
ultra vires claim arises when a government official acts without legal
authority or fails to perform a purely ministerial act. The claim is not about
discretionary decisions, but about actions that exceed the official’s granted
authority or conflict with statutory or constitutional law, see Hall v.
McRaven, 508 S.W.3d 232, 238 (Tex. 2017); Hous. Belt & Terminal Ry. Co. v.
City of Hous., 487 S.W.3d 154, 158 (Tex. 2016); Univ. of Tex. of Permian
Basin v. Banzhoff, No. 11-17-00325-CV (Tex. App. May 31, 2019); City of El
Paso v. Heinrich, 284 S.W.3d 366 (Tex. 2009). 2. Judicial Actions Without
Authority When a judge acts while a recusal motion is pending, or without
proper reinstatement, any orders issued are void and ultra vires, see In re
PG & E Reata Energy, et al, 4 S.W.3d 897 (Tex. App. 1999); Monroe v.
Blackmon, 946 S.W.2d 533 (Tex. App. 1997). Similarly, if a court issues a
protective order without the required hearing and findings, the order is void
for lack of statutory authority, see In re A.D.A., 287 S.W.3d 382 (Tex. App.
2009). 3. Due Process and Void Judgments The Texas Supreme Court has
held that due process violations—such as deprivation of property or parental
rights without notice and hearing—render judgments void and subject to
collateral attack, see In re E.R., 385 S.W.3d 552 (Tex. 2012). 4. Limits of
Judicial Discretion Even where a judge has some discretion, actions that
exceed the bounds of that discretion or conflict with statutory requirements
are ultra vires, see Hall v. McRaven, 508 S.W.3d 232 (Tex. 2017); Hous. Belt
& Terminal Ry. Co. v. City of Hous., 487 S.W.3d 154 (Tex. 2016). 5. Relief for
Ultra Vires Actions Ultra vires claims are not barred by sovereign immunity
and may proceed against officials in their official capacities, but relief is
limited to prospective declaratory or injunctive relief to restrain ongoing or
future ultra vires conduct, see City of El Paso v. Heinrich, 284 S.W.3d 366
(Tex. 2009); Holt v. Tex. Dep't of Ins.-Div. of Workers' Comp., NO.
03-17-00758-CV (Tex. App. Dec 20, 2018). Analysis 1. Deprivation of
Residence and Property Without Hearing or Findings The Respondent
alleges that he was ordered to vacate his home based solely on
unsubstantiated allegations of family violence, without an evidentiary
hearing or findings of fact. Texas Family Code § 85.001 explicitly requires a
hearing and an affirmative finding of family violence before a protective
order may issue. The Texas Court of Appeals has confirmed that issuing a
protective order without these findings is beyond the court’s statutory
authority and renders the order void, see In re A.D.A., 287 S.W.3d 382 (Tex.

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
App. 2009). Similarly, § 85.021 limits the court’s authority to grant exclusive
possession of a residence, and any order to vacate that does not comply with
these statutory prerequisites is ultra vires, see Tex. Fam. Code § 85.021.
Thus, if the court issued an order depriving the Respondent of his residence
without the required hearing and findings, it acted outside its legal
authority, supporting an ultra vires claim. 2. Orders Issued During Pending
Recusal or Without Reinstatement The Respondent claims that the court
issued orders while recusal or mandamus proceedings were pending and
before any official reinstatement by the regional presiding judge. Texas
Government Code § 29.055 and related case law make clear that, upon the
filing of a recusal motion, a judge must either recuse themselves or refer the
motion to the presiding judge and may not take further action in the case
until the motion is resolved, except for good cause stated in the order. Any
action taken in violation of this requirement is void and ultra vires, see In re
PG & E Reata Energy, et al, 4 S.W.3d 897 (Tex. App. 1999); Monroe v.
Blackmon, 946 S.W.2d 533 (Tex. App. 1997). If the court proceeded to issue
orders or set the case for trial while recusal was pending or before
reinstatement, those actions would be ultra vires and subject to challenge.
3. Denial of De Novo Hearing The Respondent asserts that his timely
request for a de novo hearing under Texas Family Code § 201.015 was
ignored or denied without explanation. This statute grants a party the right
to a de novo hearing before the referring court if a timely request is made.
Denial of this right exceeds the court’s statutory authority and constitutes
an ultra vires act, as the statute explicitly provides this procedural
safeguard, see Tex. Fam. Code § 201.015. 4. Fraudulent or Unauthorized
Orders The Respondent alleges that the court signed an “agreed” order
containing only one party’s signature and that he was compelled to sign an
order falsely reciting universal consent. Texas law recognizes that orders
procured by fraud or without proper authority are void and may be
challenged as ultra vires, see Tex. Gov't. Code § 51.901; Tex. Gov't. Code §
51.902. If the court entered orders based on fraudulent representations or
without the required consent, those actions would be beyond its legal
authority. 5. Unauthorized Practice and Void Filings The Respondent
contends that opposing counsel filed motions without proper authority,
including using e-filing credentials tied to a prior employer and without
substitution of counsel. Texas law provides that filings by unauthorized
persons are void and undermine the legitimacy of proceedings, see Tex.
Gov't. Code §§ 81.101, 81.102, 81.104, 83.004, 83.006. The Unauthorized
Practice of Law Committee is tasked with preventing such conduct. If
proven, these actions would further support an ultra vires claim. 6. Judicial
and Staff Misconduct The Respondent alleges that court staff tampered with
recusal motions by removing exhibits and altering submissions, which is not
authorized under the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. Such conduct, if
proven, would violate procedural rules and due process, further supporting
the argument that the court and its officers acted beyond their legal
authority. 7. Cumulative Denial of Due Process The Texas Supreme Court
has held that due process violations—such as deprivation of property or
parental rights without notice and hearing—render judgments void and
subject to collateral attack, see In re E.R., 385 S.W.3d 552 (Tex. 2012). The
cumulative effect of the alleged irregularities—fraudulent orders,
unauthorized practice, recusal tampering, dormant prosecution, ultra vires
judicial acts, and denial of notice and hearing—amounts to a systemic denial

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
of due process and judicial integrity, further supporting the ultra vires claim.
8. Limits of Judicial Discretion and the Ultra Vires Exception The Texas
Supreme Court has clarified that an ultra vires claim is not about
challenging the exercise of discretion, but about actions that exceed the
official’s granted authority or conflict with statutory or constitutional law,
see Hall v. McRaven, 508 S.W.3d 232 (Tex. 2017); Hous. Belt & Terminal Ry.
Co. v. City of Hous., 487 S.W.3d 154 (Tex. 2016). Even where a judge has
some discretion, actions that go beyond the bounds of that discretion or
violate statutory requirements are ultra vires. 9. Relief for Ultra Vires
Actions Ultra vires claims are not barred by sovereign immunity and may
proceed against officials in their official capacities, but relief is limited to
prospective declaratory or injunctive relief to restrain ongoing or future
ultra vires conduct, see City of El Paso v. Heinrich, 284 S.W.3d 366 (Tex.
2009); Holt v. Tex. Dep't of Ins.-Div. of Workers' Comp., NO. 03-17-00758-CV
(Tex. App. Dec 20, 2018). 10. OAG Intervention and Signature Irregularities
The Respondent further alleges that the Office of the Attorney General
(OAG) intervened in the case, but the attorney who purportedly signed the
document is no longer employed by the OAG, and the signature does not
match the name underneath. Texas law requires that only authorized
attorneys may practice law and file documents on behalf of the state, see
Tex. Gov't. Code §§ 81.101, 81.102. If the OAG’s filings were made by an
unauthorized person, those filings would be void and ultra vires. Exceptions
and Caveats While the Respondent’s allegations, if proven, support an ultra
vires claim, the actual success of such a claim depends on the factual record
and the court’s findings. Some appellate denials referenced in the
memorandum may reflect procedural or evidentiary shortcomings, but do
not preclude a valid ultra vires claim if the underlying facts are established.
Additionally, relief for ultra vires actions is generally limited to prospective
relief; retroactive relief, such as damages, is not available, see City of El
Paso v. Heinrich, 284 S.W.3d 366 (Tex. 2009). It is also important to note that
some authorities, such as In re Lee, 411 S.W.3d 445 (Tex. 2013), have been
subject to subsequent negative treatment (disagreed by Cojocar v. Cojocar,
NO. 03-14-00422-CV (Tex. App. Jun 16, 2016)), but the core principles
regarding ultra vires actions and the limits of judicial authority remain
intact and are supported by more recent and controlling precedent.
Conclusion The Respondent has a strong basis for an ultra vires claim under
Texas law. The statutes and case law make clear that actions taken by a
court or its officers without legal authority—such as issuing orders without
required hearings or findings, acting during pending recusal, or entering
fraudulent or unauthorized orders—are void and ultra vires. The cumulative
effect of the alleged procedural and jurisdictional defects, if substantiated,
supports the Respondent’s right to seek prospective relief to restrain further
unauthorized conduct and to restore his due process rights. The court
should carefully consider these claims and ensure that all future
proceedings comply strictly with statutory and constitutional requirements.

Answer (Texas)
Short response
Charles Dustin Myers has a strong ultra vires claim under Texas law
because the defendants, acting as court officials and officers, allegedly
exceeded their statutory and constitutional authority by issuing orders
without required hearings, findings, or proper judicial authority, rendering
those actions void. Texas statutes and controlling case law confirm that such
actions, especially those violating procedural safeguards like recusal, due
process, and statutory prerequisites, are ultra vires and subject to challenge
through declaratory and injunctive relief.
Summary
Under Texas law, an ultra vires claim arises when a government official,
including a judge or court officer, acts beyond the scope of their legal
authority or fails to perform a mandatory, non-discretionary duty. In this
case, Myers alleges a series of actions—including deprivation of property
without a hearing, orders issued during pending recusal, fraudulent or
unauthorized filings, and denial of statutory rights—that, if substantiated,
would constitute ultra vires conduct because they violate explicit statutory
requirements and due process protections.
The Texas Family Code and Government Code set clear procedural and
substantive limits on judicial authority, particularly regarding protective
orders, recusal, and the issuance of orders. Texas appellate and Supreme
Court decisions reinforce that actions taken in violation of these statutes—
such as issuing orders without a hearing or while recusal is pending—are
void and ultra vires. Myers’s allegations, if proven, fit squarely within the
legal framework for an ultra vires claim, entitling him to seek prospective
relief to restrain further unauthorized conduct and restore his due process
rights.

Analysis
1. Deprivation of Residence and Property Without Hearing
or Findings
Myers alleges that he was ordered to vacate his home based solely on
unsubstantiated allegations of family violence, without an evidentiary
hearing or findings of fact. Texas Family Code § 85.001 explicitly requires a
hearing and an affirmative finding of family violence before a protective
order may issue. The Texas Court of Appeals has confirmed that issuing a
protective order without these findings is beyond the court’s statutory
authority and renders the order void, see In re A.D.A., 287 S.W.3d 382 (Tex.

possession of a residence, and any order to vacate that does not comply with
these statutory prerequisites is ultra vires, see Tex. Fam. Code § 85.021.
Thus, if the court issued an order depriving Myers of his residence without
the required hearing and findings, it acted outside its legal authority,
supporting an ultra vires claim.
2. Orders Issued During Pending Recusal or Without
Reinstatement
Myers claims that the court issued orders while recusal or mandamus
proceedings were pending and before any official reinstatement by the
regional presiding judge. Texas Government Code § 29.055 and related case
law make clear that, upon the filing of a recusal motion, a judge must either
recuse themselves or refer the motion to the presiding judge and may not
take further action in the case until the motion is resolved, except for good

court proceeded to issue orders or set the case for trial while recusal was
pending or before reinstatement, those actions would be ultra vires and
subject to challenge.
3. Denial of De Novo Hearing

S.W.3d 552 (Tex. 2012). The cumulative effect of the alleged irregularities—
fraudulent orders, unauthorized practice, recusal tampering, dormant

amounts to a systemic denial of due process and judicial integrity, further
supporting the ultra vires claim.
8. Limits of Judicial Discretion and the Ultra Vires

Conclusion
Myers has a strong basis for an ultra vires claim under Texas law. The
statutes and case law make clear that actions taken by a court or its officers
without legal authority—such as issuing orders without required hearings or
findings, acting during pending recusal, or entering fraudulent or
unauthorized orders—are void and ultra vires. The cumulative effect of the
alleged procedural and jurisdictional defects, if substantiated, supports
Myers’s right to seek prospective relief to restrain further unauthorized
conduct and to restore his due process rights. The court should carefully
consider these claims and ensure that all future proceedings comply strictly
with statutory and constitutional requirements.

JAMES B. MUNFORD, JEFFREY N. KAITCER, KATE STONE,
KENNETH NEWELL, DAVID L. EVANS, and LINDSEY K. BAKER,
Defendants.
Cause No. ___________
PLAINTIFF’S ORIGINAL PETITION FOR DECLARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF (ULTRA VIRES ACTION)
TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF SAID COURT:
Plaintiff Charles Dustin Myers files this Original Petition for Declaratory and
Injunctive Relief against Defendants James B. Munford, Jeffrey N. Kaitcer,
Kate Stone, Kenneth Newell, David L. Evans, and Lindsey K. Baker, in their
official capacities, and respectfully shows the Court as follows:
I. PARTIES
Plaintiff Charles Dustin Myers is an individual residing in Tarrant
County, Texas.
Defendants James B. Munford, Jeffrey N. Kaitcer, Kate Stone, Kenneth
Newell, David L. Evans, and Lindsey K. Baker are sued in their official
capacities as judicial officers and court staff of the 322nd District
Court, Tarrant County, Texas.
II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE
This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to the Texas
Constitution and Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code, as Plaintiff
seeks declaratory and injunctive relief for ultra vires acts by state
officials.
Venue is proper in Tarrant County, Texas, because all acts and
omissions occurred in this county.
III. NATURE OF THE CASE
This is an ultra vires action seeking prospective declaratory and
injunctive relief to restrain Defendants from continuing to act outside
their statutory and constitutional authority, in violation of Plaintiff’s due
process rights and Texas law.
IV. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
Plaintiff incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs.
Defendants, acting under color of state law, issued orders depriving
Plaintiff of his residence and property without conducting the
evidentiary hearing and making the affirmative findings required by
Texas Family Code §§ 85.001 and 85.021.
Defendants issued orders and took other judicial actions while motions
for recusal or mandamus were pending, and before any reinstatement
by the regional presiding judge, in violation of Texas Government Code
§ 29.055.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Defendants denied Plaintiff’s timely request for a de novo hearing
under Texas Family Code § 201.015, thereby exceeding their statutory
authority.
Defendants entered “agreed” orders that were not signed by all parties
and compelled Plaintiff to sign orders falsely reciting universal consent,
in violation of Texas Government Code §§ 51.901 and 51.902.
Defendants permitted and/or failed to prevent the unauthorized
practice of law, including filings by attorneys not properly substituted
or authorized, in violation of Texas Government Code §§ 81.101, 81.102,
81.104, 83.004, and 83.006.
Defendants and their staff tampered with court filings, including
removing exhibits from recusal motions and altering submissions, in
violation of procedural rules and due process.
The Office of the Attorney General intervened in the case through
filings signed by an attorney no longer employed by the OAG, with
signatures not matching the name underneath, in violation of Texas
Government Code §§ 81.101 and 81.102.
The cumulative effect of these actions constitutes a systemic denial of
due process and exceeds the lawful authority of Defendants.
V. LEGAL BASIS FOR ULTRA VIRES RELIEF
Under Texas law, an ultra vires claim arises when a government official
acts without legal authority or fails to perform a purely ministerial act,
see Hall v. McRaven, 508 S.W.3d 232 (Tex. 2017); City of El Paso v.
Heinrich, 284 S.W.3d 366 (Tex. 2009).
Actions taken in violation of statutory requirements, such as issuing
orders without required hearings, findings, or while recusal is pending,
are void and ultra vires, see In re A.D.A., 287 S.W.3d 382 (Tex. App.
2009); Monroe v. Blackmon, 946 S.W.2d 533 (Tex. App. 1997).
Relief for ultra vires actions is limited to prospective declaratory and
injunctive relief, see City of El Paso v. Heinrich, 284 S.W.3d 366 (Tex.
2009).
VI. REQUEST FOR RELIEF
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court:
a. Declare that Defendants’ actions described above were ultra vires and
void under Texas law;
b. Issue a permanent injunction restraining Defendants from further ultra
vires conduct, including issuing orders without statutory authority, denying
required hearings, acting during pending recusal, permitting unauthorized
practice of law, and tampering with court filings;
c. Award Plaintiff all costs of court and such other and further relief to which
he may be justly entitled.
Respectfully submitted,
[Signature block for Plaintiff or Plaintiff’s counsel]

Legal Authorities
Unauthorized Practice of Law Committee v. Jansen, 816 S.W.2d 813 (Tex.
App. 1991)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
UPLC filed a declaratory judgment requesting the trial court to declare that
various practices by appellee constituted the unauthorized practice of law in
violation of TEX. GOV'T CODE ANN. § 81.102(a) (Vernon 1988).
Summary
The Unauthorized Practice of Law Committee (UPLC) sought a declaratory
judgment to determine whether certain actions by Jansen and his firm
constituted the unauthorized practice of law. This is relevant to
understanding how Texas law defines and addresses unauthorized legal
practice, particularly under TEX. GOV'T CODE ANN. § 81.102(a).
Green v. Unauthorized Practice of Law Committee, 883 S.W.2d 293 (Tex.
App. 1994)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Injunctive relief may only be granted upon a showing of (1) the existence of
a wrongful act; (2) the existence of imminent harm; (3) the existence of
irreparable injury; and (4) the absence of an adequate remedy at law. Priest
v. Texas Animal Health Comm'n, 780 S.W.2d 874, 875 (Tex.App.--Dallas 1989,
no writ). The grant or refusal of a permanent or temporary injunction is
ordinarily within the trial court's sound discretion and, on appeal, review of
the trial court's action is limited to the question of whether the action
constituted a clear abuse of discretion. Priest, 780 S.W.2d at 875. Where the
facts conclusively show that a party is violating the substantive law, the trial
court should enjoin the violation, and in such case, there is no discretion to
be exercised. Priest, 780 S.W.2d at 876.
Summary
Criteria for granting injunctive relief, which is relevant to the question of
ultra vires actions because such actions may warrant injunctive relief if they
meet the criteria of wrongful act, imminent harm, irreparable injury, and
lack of adequate legal remedy. The passage also emphasizes that when a

violation of substantive law is clear, the court should enjoin the violation
without discretion.
Torres v. Unauthorized Practice of Law Comm. For Supreme Court of Tex.,
05-21-00651-CV (Tex. App. Sep 09, 2022)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The Unauthorized Practice of Law Committee for the Supreme Court of
Texas (UPLC) brought this suit in May 2020 alleging Torres, a non-lawyer,
was persistently attempting to represent two legal entities in litigation... The
UPLC sought an injunction to prevent Torres from engaging in acts that
would constitute the unauthorized practice of law... Section 81.104 of the
Texas Government Code authorizes the UPLC to 'seek the elimination of the
unauthorized practice of law by appropriate actions and methods, including
the filing of suits in the name of the committee.' Tex. Gov't Code Ann. §
81.104(2). The statute's express authorization of the committee to eliminate
the unauthorized practice law through legal action supersedes the common
law requirements for injunctive relief such as imminent harm and
irreparable injury.
Summary
The passage provides insight into the statutory framework governing the
unauthorized practice of law in Texas. It highlights the role of the UPLC in
seeking injunctions against individuals engaging in unauthorized legal
representation. This is relevant to the ultra vires claim as it underscores the
legal mechanisms available to challenge actions taken without proper
authority, which is a central theme in ultra vires claims.
Lopez v. Occhiogrosso, NO. 14-17-00324-CV (Tex. App. Jan 29, 2019)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The protective order is based on both Texas Code of Criminal Procedure
Chapter 7A and Texas Family Code Chapter 85. Texas Code of Criminal
Procedure Chapter 7A allows victims of sexual assault and other specifically
identified offenses to apply for a protective order against the alleged
offender. See Tex. Code Crim. Proc. arts. 7A.01(a)(1)-(2), 7A.07(a). If, after a
hearing, a court finds 'reasonable grounds to believe that the applicant is
the victim of sexual assault,' the court 'shall issue a protective order. .. .' Id.
art. 7A.03. The trial court may order the alleged offender to take specific
actions the court determines are 'necessary or appropriate to prevent or
reduce the likelihood of harm to the applicant or a member of the applicant's

=== PAGE 15 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
family or household' or prohibit the alleged offender from engaging in
certain conduct. Id. art. 7A.05(a).
Summary
The passage provides insight into the procedural requirements for issuing
protective orders in Texas, emphasizing the necessity of a hearing and
specific findings before such orders can be issued. This aligns with the ultra
vires doctrine, which holds that actions taken without legal authority, such
as issuing orders without required hearings, are void. The passage also
highlights the importance of judicial conduct and adherence to procedural
safeguards, which are central to the ultra vires claims discussed in the
question.
Culver v. Culver, 360 S.W.3d 526 (Tex. App. 2011)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Because a protective order is in the nature of a civil injunction, this Court
has held a protective order should be reviewed for an abuse of discretion.
See In re Epperson, 213 S.W.3d 541, 542–43 (Tex.App.-Texarkana 2007, no
pet.)... A trial court abuses its discretion if it acts without reference to any
guiding rules and principles or reaches a decision so arbitrary and
unreasonable as to amount to a clear and prejudicial error of law... In
addition, Kerri argues her due process rights were violated. Billy also agrees
that a due process violation has occurred, reasoning that Section 87.003 of
the Texas Family Code requires a hearing and that due process requires
notice and an opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a
meaningful manner.
Summary
The passage highlights that protective orders are reviewed for abuse of
discretion, which occurs when a court acts without guiding principles or in
an arbitrary manner. It also emphasizes the necessity of due process,
including notice and the opportunity to be heard, as required by Section
87.003 of the Texas Family Code. This aligns with the ultra vires doctrine,
where actions taken without legal authority or in violation of due process
are considered void.

Extract
To fall within the ultra vires exception, a suit must not complain of a
government official's exercise of discretion but must allege, and ultimately
prove, the official (1) 'acted without legal authority' or (2) 'failed to perform
a purely ministerial act.' Houston Mun. Employees' Pension Sys., 549 S.W.3d
at 576; Heinrich, 284 S.W.3d at 372; see also Hall v. McRaven, 508 S.W.3d
232, 241 (Tex. 2017). An official acts without legal authority if she exceeds
the bounds of her authority or if her acts conflict with the law itself. Houston
Belt & Terminal Ry. Co. v. City of Houston, 487 S.W.3d 154, 158 (Tex. 2016).
Summary
Clear definition of what constitutes an ultra vires claim in Texas. It specifies
that such a claim must not be about a government official's discretionary
actions but must focus on actions taken without legal authority or the failure
to perform a ministerial duty. This aligns with the general understanding of
ultra vires claims as actions that exceed the official's granted authority or
conflict with statutory or constitutional law.
Roach v. Ingram, 557 S.W.3d 203 (Tex. App. 2018)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
In this lawsuit, the only relief the Parents request is prospective injunctive
relief preventing the appellees from engaging in allegedly ultra vires acts
concerning truancy enforcement in the future. In effect, the Parents seek an
injunction requiring appellees to comply with the law. ... Governmental
immunity provides broad protection to the state and its officers, but suits to
require state officials to comply with statutory or constitutional provisions
are not prohibited by sovereign immunity. City of El Paso v. Heinrich, 284
S.W.3d 366, 372 (Tex. 2009). To fall within this ultra vires exception, 'a suit
must not complain of a government officer’s exercise of discretion, but
rather must allege, and ultimately prove, that the officer acted without legal
authority or failed to perform a purely ministerial act.'
Summary
Ultra vires claims are not barred by sovereign immunity when they seek to
compel government officials to comply with statutory or constitutional
provisions. The relief sought in such cases is typically prospective injunctive
relief, which aims to prevent future unauthorized actions. The passage also
emphasizes that the claim must focus on actions taken without legal
authority, rather than discretionary decisions.
In re A.D.A., 287 S.W.3d 382 (Tex. App. 2009)

=== PAGE 17 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Armstrong argues, in his third issue, that the trial court erred in issuing a
protective order without an affirmative finding that family violence had
occurred and that family violence was likely to occur again. 'At the close of a
hearing on an application for a protective order, the court shall find
whether: (1) family violence has occurred; and (2) family violence is likely to
occur in the future.' TEX. FAM.CODE ANN. § 85.001(a) (Vernon 2008); In re
Epperson, 213 S.W.3d 541, 542 (Tex.App.-Texarkana 2007, no pet.).
Summary
The passage highlights the requirement under Texas Family Code §
85.001(a) that a court must make an affirmative finding that family violence
has occurred and is likely to occur again before issuing a protective order.
This requirement is a procedural safeguard to ensure due process is
followed.
Hartzell v. S. O., 613 S.W.3d 244 (Tex. App. 2020)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The University officials argue that because they are not acting ultra vires —
i.e., because they have the authority to conduct a disciplinary hearing to
determine whether to revoke S.O.'s degree—S.O.'s claims for declaratory
relief as to whether they are acting without authority to revoke a degree are
barred by sovereign immunity. S.O. filed a cross-appeal challenging the trial
court's ruling on two of her requests for declarations unrelated to her ultra
vires claims and the trial court's denial of her request for attorneys' fees
pursuant to the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act. See Tex. Civ. Prac. &
Rem. Code § 37.009.
Summary
Concept of ultra vires actions in the context of a university's authority to
conduct disciplinary proceedings. It highlights the argument that actions
within the scope of granted authority are not ultra vires and are protected
by sovereign immunity. This is relevant to understanding the boundaries of
ultra vires claims, as it emphasizes that such claims must demonstrate
actions beyond legal authority to overcome sovereign immunity defenses.
City of El Paso v. Heinrich, 284 S.W.3d 366 (Tex. 2009)
Texas Supreme Court

=== PAGE 18 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
Sovereign immunity protects the State from lawsuits for money damages.
But 'an action to determine or protect a private party's rights against a state
official who has acted without legal or statutory authority is not a suit
against the State that sovereign immunity bars.' ... We conclude that while
governmental immunity generally bars suits for retrospective monetary
relief, it does not preclude prospective injunctive remedies in official-
capacity suits against government actors who violate statutory or
constitutional provisions.
Summary
While sovereign immunity protects the state from suits for monetary
damages, it does not bar suits seeking to enforce compliance with statutory
or constitutional provisions.
Hous. Belt &amp; Terminal Ry. Co. v. City of Hous., 487 S.W.3d 154 (Tex.
2016)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
Although governmental immunity justifiably provides broad protection to the
government and its agents, it does not protect every act by a government
officer that requires some exercise of judgment—a government officer with
some discretion to interpret and apply a law may nonetheless act 'without
legal authority,' and thus ultra vires, if he exceeds the bounds of his granted
authority or if his acts conflict with the law itself.
Summary
The ultra vires doctrine in Texas allows for suits against government officers
who act without legal authority, even if they have some discretion in their
roles. This is because governmental immunity does not protect actions that
exceed the officer's granted authority or conflict with the law.
In re PG & E Reata Energy, et al, 4 S.W.3d 897 (Tex. App. 1999)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Recusal is governed by Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a, which requires
the judge against whom a proper recusal motion is filed to either grant the
motion or request the Presiding Judge to assign another judge to hear the
motion. TEX. R. CIV. P. 18a(c); see also TEX. GOV'T CODE ANN. 74.059(c)(3)

=== PAGE 19 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
(Vernon 1998) (providing for requested assignment by the presiding judge).
The purpose of a recusal motion under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a is
to insure that all litigants have the opportunity to have an impartial judge
preside over their case.
Summary
The passage provides insight into the procedural requirements for recusal
under Texas law, emphasizing that a judge must either recuse themselves or
request the assignment of another judge when a recusal motion is filed. This
ensures impartiality in judicial proceedings. The passage is relevant to the
question as it highlights the procedural safeguards in place to prevent
judges from acting without authority during recusal proceedings.
Monroe v. Blackmon, 946 S.W.2d 533 (Tex. App. 1997)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The more fundamental is disqualification, for if a judge is disqualified from
sitting in a case he is without jurisdiction to rule. Any order or judgment by
a disqualified judge is void, without effect, and subject to collateral attack.
See Buckholts Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Glaser, 632 S.W.2d 146, 148 (Tex.1982).
The Texas Constitution provides in Article V, Section 11: 'No judge shall sit
in any case wherein he may be interested, or where either of the parties may
be connected with him, either by affinity or consanguinity, within such a
degree as may be prescribed by law, or when he shall have been counsel in
the case.' TEX. CONST. art. V, § 11.
Summary
A judge who is disqualified due to interest or connection to the parties lacks
jurisdiction to rule on a case. Any orders or judgments made by such a judge
are void and can be challenged through collateral attack. This principle is
rooted in the Texas Constitution, which prohibits judges from sitting in cases
where they have a personal interest or connection.
In re E.R., 385 S.W.3d 552, 55 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 1130 (Tex. 2012)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
If it was, 'then termination of appellant's claim without actual notice violated
due process,' regardless of the statutory two-month deadline for filing
claims. ... The Department's allegations against L.R. are serious, and if
proven, may justify terminating her parental rights. But that determination

=== PAGE 20 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
cannot be made before she is given notice and the opportunity to be heard.
Service by publication deprived L.R. of due process. She is entitled to a new
trial unless she unreasonably delayed in seeking relief after learning of the
judgment against her, and granting relief would impair another party's
substantial reliance on the judgment.
Summary
The passage highlights that due process violations, such as failing to provide
actual notice before terminating parental rights, render judgments void. It
emphasizes the necessity of notice and the opportunity to be heard before
making determinations that affect significant rights. This principle is
applicable broadly in Texas law, reinforcing the importance of procedural
safeguards.
Hall v. McRaven, 508 S.W.3d 232 (Tex. 2017)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
An ultra vires action requires a plaintiff to 'allege, and ultimately prove, that
the officer acted without legal authority or failed to perform a purely
ministerial act.' ... We recently clarified what it means for an official to act
'without legal authority.' See Houston Belt & Terminal Ry. Co. v. City of
Houston, 487 S.W.3d 154, 158 (Tex. 2016). We said that 'a government
officer with some discretion to interpret and apply a law may nonetheless
act ‘without legal authority,’ and thus ultra vires, if he exceeds the bounds of
his granted authority or if his acts conflict with the law itself.' ... Heinrich
clarified two general means of proving an ultra vires claim: (1) an action
'without legal authority' or (2) failure to 'perform a purely ministerial act.'
Summary
Even if an official has some discretion, they may still act ultra vires if they
exceed their authority or conflict with the law. This is relevant to the
question as it provides a legal basis for challenging actions taken by officials
that are beyond their granted authority.
Bailey v. Smith, 581 S.W.3d 374 (Tex. App. 2019)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Sovereign immunity from suit generally extends to state officials acting in
their official capacities because 'a suit against a government official acting
in an official capacity is ‘merely another way of pleading an action against

=== PAGE 21 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
the entity of which the official is an agent.’' However, a suit against a state
official can go forward if the official 'acted ultra vires, or without legal
authority, in carrying out his duties.' Houston Belt & Terminal Ry. Co. v. City
of Houston, 487 S.W.3d 154, 157–58 (Tex. 2016). A proper ultra vires suit
'must allege, and ultimately prove, that the officer acted without legal
authority or failed to perform a purely ministerial act.'
Summary
While sovereign immunity typically protects state officials from suits in their
official capacities, an exception exists for ultra vires actions. An ultra vires
claim can proceed if it is alleged and proven that the official acted without
legal authority or failed to perform a ministerial duty. This aligns with the
principles discussed in the question, where actions taken without legal
authority are considered ultra vires and not protected by sovereign
immunity.
In re Lee, 411 S.W.3d 445, 56 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 1247 (Tex. 2013)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
Further, the plurality advises that a trial court faced with a potentially
harmful MSA should issue some sort of temporary orders or protective
orders in conjunction with entry of judgment. Id. at 456. If the Family Code
allowed trial courts to issue whatever orders are necessary to protect
children, there might be no disagreement in this case. But the Family Code
limits the availability of protective actions, and trial courts often must rely
on parties protecting children's best interests to request such orders. For
example, although the Family Code authorizes a trial court to make
temporary orders for the safety and welfare of the child, such orders are
available while a SAPCR is pending and 'before final order,' making the
availability in cases of statutorily-compliant MSAs questionable.
Summary
The passage highlights the limitations imposed by the Texas Family Code on
a trial court's authority to issue protective orders and temporary orders. It
emphasizes that such orders are typically available only while a SAPCR (Suit
Affecting the Parent-Child Relationship) is pending and before a final order
is issued. This limitation is relevant to the question of ultra vires actions
because it underscores the statutory boundaries within which a court must
operate. If a court issues orders beyond these statutory limits, such actions
could be considered ultra vires.

"A trial judge has a legal, nondiscretionary duty to consider and rule on
properly filed motions within a reasonable time." In re Ramirez, 994 S.W.2d
682, 683 (Tex. App.-San Antonio 1998, orig. proceeding). When a trial court
fails to comply with that nondiscretionary, ministerial duty, "mandamus may
issue to compel the [trial court] to act." In re Layton, 257 S.W.3d 794, 795
(Tex. App.- Amarillo 2008, orig. proceeding).
Summary
A trial judge in Texas has a nondiscretionary duty to rule on motions in a
timely manner. If the judge fails to do so, a writ of mandamus can be issued
to compel the judge to act. This is relevant to the question of whether
actions taken by a judge outside their legal authority can be challenged, as
it highlights the judge's obligation to adhere to procedural duties.

discretion if it acts without reference to any guiding rules and principles or
reaches a decision so arbitrary and unreasonable as to amount to a clear
and prejudicial error of law.'
Summary
A trial court's decision can be considered an abuse of discretion if it acts
without reference to guiding rules and principles or if the decision is
arbitrary and unreasonable. This aligns with the ultra vires doctrine, where
actions taken without legal authority or in violation of statutory
requirements are considered void.

As a prerequisite to presenting a complaint for appellate review, the record
must show that 'the complaint was made to the trial court by a timely
request, objection, or motion.' See TEX. R. APP. P. 33.1(a)(1); Mansions in
the Forest, L.P. v. Montgomery Cnty., 365 S.W.3d 314, 317 (Tex. 2012). This
rule also applies to constitutional claims. See In re L.M.I., 119 S.W.3d 707,
711 (Tex. 2003) (noting that the Texas Supreme Court and the United States
Supreme Court have both held that even constitutional claims must be
raised before the trial court to preserve error); Valdez v. Valdez, 930 S.W.2d
725, 728 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1996, no writ).
Summary
In Texas, for a complaint to be considered on appeal, it must have been
presented to the trial court through a timely request, objection, or motion.
This requirement applies to all types of claims, including constitutional
claims, ensuring that the trial court has the opportunity to address the issue
before it is brought to an appellate court.

A suit seeking to compel a government official 'to comply with statutory or
constitutional provisions' is an ultra vires suit and is not protected by
sovereign immunity. City of El Paso v. Heinrich, 284 S.W.3d 366, 372 (Tex.
2009). However, relief is limited in an ultra vires suit to prospective
declaratory or injunctive relief restraining ultra vires conduct, as opposed to
retroactive relief. Id. at 374-77.
Summary
Ultra vires suits in Texas are not barred by sovereign immunity when they
seek to compel compliance with statutory or constitutional provisions. It also
specifies that the relief available in ultra vires suits is limited to prospective
declaratory or injunctive relief, not retroactive relief. This aligns with the
Respondent's claim, which seeks prospective relief to restrain further
unauthorized conduct and restore due process rights.

In Heinrich, the court recognized an 'ultra vires exception' to sovereign
immunity: [I]t is clear that suits to require state officials to comply with
statutory or constitutional provisions are not prohibited by sovereign
immunity even if a declaration to that effect compels the payment of money.
To fall within this ultra vires exception, a suit must not complain of a
government officer's exercise of discretion, but rather must allege, and
ultimately prove, that the officer acted without legal authority or failed to
perform a purely ministerial act.... Thus, ultra vires suits do not attempt to
reassert the control of the state. Stated another way, these suits do not seek
to alter government policy but rather to enforce existing policy.
Summary
The ultra vires exception allows suits against state officials to proceed even
in the face of sovereign immunity, provided the suit alleges that the official
acted without legal authority or failed to perform a ministerial duty. This
exception is not about challenging discretionary decisions but enforcing
compliance with statutory or constitutional provisions.
Chamberlain v. Cherry, 818 S.W.2d 201 (Tex. App. 1991)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
A trial court 'abuses its discretion when it reaches a decision so arbitrary
and unreasonable as to amount to a clear and prejudicial error of law.'
Johnson v. Fourth Court of Appeals, 700 S.W.2d 916, 917 (Tex.1985, orig.
proceeding); Foreman v. Jarrett, 796 S.W.2d 316, 317 (Tex.App.--Austin
1990, orig. proceeding). A relator must establish that the facts and law of
the case permit the trial court to make only one decision. Johnson v. Fourth
Court of Appeals, 700 S.W.2d at 917; Keller Indus. v. Blanton, 804 S.W.2d
182, 185 (Tex.App.--Houston [14th Dist.] 1991, orig. proceeding).
Summary
The passage provides insight into how Texas courts evaluate whether a trial
court has abused its discretion, which is relevant to determining whether
actions are ultra vires. An ultra vires action involves a government official
acting beyond their legal authority, and a court's abuse of discretion could
potentially fall into this category if it results in actions that exceed statutory
or constitutional limits.
In re Lozano 696 S.W.3d 222
Texas Court of Appeals

=== PAGE 25 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
If a relator in a habeas corpus proceeding establishes 'the order requiring
[her] confinement is void, either because the court that issued the order
lacked jurisdiction to enter it or because it deprived relator of [her] liberty
without due process of law,' then the relator is entitled to be discharged. ...
We have also repeatedly held that portions of Judge Mary Lou Alvarez’s
orders in this underlying case and other similar cases were void because
they violated the Separation of Powers Clause.
Summary
The passage highlights that orders can be deemed void if they are issued
without jurisdiction or violate due process, which aligns with the principles
of ultra vires actions where officials act beyond their legal authority. This
supports the argument that actions taken without proper authority are void
under Texas law.
Rogers v. State, 183 S.W.3d 853 (Tex. App. 2005)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
In his second issue, Appellant complains of the admission of a 1992
application for a protective order and a temporary ex parte protective order
signed by the trial court. Appellant contends that even though he did not
object to this evidence, its admission was fundamental error in violation of
the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States
Constitution and the due course of law provision of the Texas Constitution.
Appellant contends that he was not represented by an attorney or present to
defend himself when the 1992 temporary restraining order was entered.
Further, he argues that the order had become void by its own terms fourteen
days after its entry by the court since no hearing was held, and the State
cannot use a void judgment against him.
Summary
The passage highlights a situation where a protective order was challenged
on due process grounds because it was entered without a hearing and
without the appellant being present or represented. The appellant argued
that the order was void because it expired by its own terms without a
hearing. This is relevant to the ultra vires claim because it underscores the
importance of procedural safeguards, such as hearings, in maintaining the
validity of court orders. If a court issues an order without following statutory
requirements, such as holding a hearing, it may be acting beyond its
authority, rendering the order void.

Texas Department of State Health Services v. Holmes, 294 S.W.3d 328 (Tex.
App. 2009)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
In addition to her constitutional claims, Holmes alleges in her petition that
the Department exceeded its statutory authority under the health and safety
code in seizing her laser device. The issue of sovereign immunity in relation
to these claims is controlled by the recent Texas Supreme Court decision of
City of El Paso v. Heinrich, 284 S.W.3d 366 (Tex.2009). Under Heinrich, a
plaintiff may not bring declaratory actions against governmental entities to
determine their rights under a particular statute, but are limited to bringing
ultra vires suits against officials in their official capacity. Id. at 372-73. On
that basis, we reverse the trial court's order to the extent it denies the plea
to the jurisdiction as to Holmes's statutory ultra vires claims against the
Department. The trial court did not err, however, in denying the plea to the
jurisdiction as to Holmes's constitutional claims against the Department.
Furthermore, Holmes's statutory ultra vires claims against the
Commissioner are not barred by sovereign immunity. The Texas Supreme
Court recently reiterated that ultra vires claims may be brought against
governmental officials in their official capacities, as Holmes has done here.
Heinrich, 284 S.W.3d at 371-72. In order to bring this type of claim, a
plaintiff is required only to 'allege, and ultimately prove, that the officer
acted without legal authority or failed to perform a purely ministerial act.'
Id. at 372 (emphasis added).
Summary
Under Texas law, as established by the Texas Supreme Court in City of El
Paso v. Heinrich, ultra vires claims can be brought against government
officials in their official capacities without being barred by sovereign
immunity. This is relevant to the question as it supports the notion that the
Respondent in the original question can pursue an ultra vires claim against
the officials involved, provided they acted beyond their legal authority.

In certain narrow instances, a suit against a state official can proceed even
in the absence of a waiver of immunity if the state official's actions are ultra

act.' City of El Paso v. Heinrich, 284 S.W.3d 366, 372 (Tex. 2009)... Suits
complaining of ultra vires actions must be brought against government
officials in their official capacity and may seek only prospective injunctive
remedies.
Summary
Ultra vires claims can proceed against state officials in Texas when the
official acts beyond their legal authority or fails to perform a ministerial
duty. It emphasizes that these claims must be against officials in their official
capacity and are limited to seeking prospective injunctive relief. This aligns
with the principles discussed in the question regarding the limits of judicial
authority and the nature of ultra vires claims.
Hagstette v. State Comm'n on Judicial Conduct, NO. 01-19-00208-CV (Tex.
App. Dec 15, 2020)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The court held that for the 'ultra vires' exception to state actors' sovereign
immunity to apply, a suit 'must not complain of a government officer's
exercise of discretion, but rather must allege, and ultimately prove, that the
officer acted without legal authority or failed to perform a purely ministerial
act.'
Summary
The ultra vires exception to sovereign immunity applies when a government
official acts without legal authority or fails to perform a purely ministerial
act. It emphasizes that the exception does not apply to complaints about the
exercise of discretion within the scope of the official's authority.
Luttrell v. El Paso Cnty., 555 S.W.3d 812 (Tex. App. 2018)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
An ultra vires claim based on actions taken 'without legal authority' has two
fundamental components: '(1) authority giving the official some (but not
absolute) discretion to act and (2) conduct outside of that authority.' See
Hall v. McRaven, 508 S.W.3d 232, 239 (Tex. 2017) (citing Houston Belt &
Terminal Ry. Co. v. City of Houston, 487 S.W.3d 154, 158 (Tex. 2016) ). This
exception applies when a government officer with some discretion to
interpret and apply a law acts 'without legal authority, and thus ultra vires, if
he exceeds the bounds of his granted authority or if his acts conflict with the

law itself.' Hall, 508 S.W.3d at 238 (citing Hous. Belt, 487 S.W.3d at 158 )
(internal quotations omitted).
Summary
Clear explanation of the ultra vires doctrine in Texas, emphasizing that it
applies when a government official acts beyond their legal authority. It
highlights the two components necessary for an ultra vires claim: the
existence of some discretion and conduct outside that authority. This is
relevant to the question as it outlines the legal framework for challenging
actions taken without legal authority, which is central to the Respondent's
claims.
In re Layton, 257 S.W.3d 794 (Tex. App. 2008)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
A trial court has a ministerial duty to consider and rule on motions properly
filed and pending before the court and mandamus may issue to compel the
judge to act. Safety-Kleen Corp. v. Garcia, 945 S.W.2d 268, 269 (Tex.App.-
San Antonio 1997, orig. proceeding) (citing O'Donniley v. Golden, 860 S.W.2d
267, 269-70 (Tex. App.-Tyler 1993, orig. proceeding)). However, the trial
court is afforded a reasonable time in which to perform this ministerial duty.
Barnes v. State, 832 S.W.2d 424, 426 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 1992,
orig. proceeding). Whether the trial court has failed to act within a
reasonable time is dependent upon the circumstances of the case. Id.
Summary
A trial court has a ministerial duty to consider and rule on motions that are
properly filed and pending. This duty is not discretionary, meaning the court
must act on these motions. However, the court is allowed a reasonable
amount of time to perform this duty, and what constitutes a reasonable time
depends on the specific circumstances of each case. If a court fails to act
within a reasonable time, a mandamus may be issued to compel the court to
fulfill its duty.

Tex. Gov't. Code § 51.901 Tex. Gov't. Code § 51.901 Fraudulent Document Or
Instrument
Extract
If a clerk of the supreme court, clerk of the court of criminal appeals, clerk
of a court of appeals, district clerk, county clerk, district and county clerk,
or municipal clerk has a reasonable basis to believe in good faith that a
document or instrument previously filed or recorded or offered or submitted
for filing or for filing and recording is fraudulent, the clerk shall: ... provide
written notice of the filing, recording, or submission for filing or for filing
and recording to the stated or last known address of the person against
whom the purported judgment, act, order, directive, or process is
rendered; ... A document or instrument is presumed to be fraudulent if: ...
the document is a purported judgment or other document purporting to
memorialize or evidence an act, an order, a directive, or process of: (A) a
purported court or a purported judicial entity not expressly created or
established under the constitution or the laws of this state or of the United
States; or (B) a purported judicial officer of a purported court or purported

Mechanism for clerks to address potentially fraudulent documents, which is
relevant to the ultra vires claim as it supports the argument that actions
taken without legal authority, such as fraudulent or unauthorized orders, are
void and ultra vires. This aligns with the Respondent's allegations of
fraudulent or unauthorized orders in the ultra vires claim.

Recusal's Own Conflict of Interest
Criminal Justice - American Bar Association - Louis J. Virelli III -
2025-01-01
Extract
The Court found due process violations where a state supreme court justice
participated in a case in which his largest judicial campaign donor was a
party, and where a state supreme court justice took part in the review of a
defendant’s death sentence that the justice had personally approved while
serving as the district attorney responsible for the case. In each instance,

The Ultra Vires Exception To Sovereign Immunity In Texas
Extract
Under the ultra vires doctrine, sovereign immunity does not prohibit suits
against a state official or officer of a state entity if the official's actions were
ultra vires.1 Thus, even when a government entity's immunity has not been
waived by the Legislature, a claim may proceed against a government
official in his official capacity if the plaintiff successfully alleges that the
official has engaged in ultra vires conduct. ... The ultra vires doctrine is a
narrow exception to governmental immunity. An ultra vires claim against a
government official-that is, a suit against a government official for acting
outside his or her authority and seeking to require the official to comply with
statutory or constitutional provisions-is not barred by immunity. Such a suit
is known as an ultra vires suit. ... The Texas Supreme court defined an ultra
vires claim as 'an action to determine or protect a private party's rights
against a state official who has acted without legal or statutory authority,'
and did not confine ultra vires acts to acts taken 'outside' the agency's
jurisdictional authority.
Summary
Clear explanation of the ultra vires doctrine as it applies in Texas,
highlighting that it serves as an exception to sovereign immunity. It allows
for suits against government officials in their official capacities when they
act beyond their legal authority. The Texas Supreme Court's definition of an
ultra vires claim is also provided, emphasizing that it involves actions taken
without legal or statutory authority.
When Is Governmental Immunity Waived By The Acts Of Governmental
Officials? Ultra Vires Revisited
Extract
The Board's sovereign immunity from suit as a state agency extends to its
officials who act consistently with the law but not to those who act ultra
vires—that is, 'without legal authority or [by] fail[ing] to perform a purely

=== PAGE 45 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
ministerial act.' An official acts without legal authority when he 'exceeds the
bounds of his granted authority or if his acts conflict with the law itself.' An
official fails to perform a ministerial act when he fails to comply with a law
that 'prescribes and defines the duties to be performed with such precision
and certainty as to leave nothing to the exercise of discretion or judgment.'
An official who acts ultra vires is not acting for the state and not entitled to
its immunity. But 'it is not an ultra vires act for an official to make an
erroneous decision within the authority granted.'
Summary
The Texas Supreme Court has clarified the conditions under which
governmental immunity is waived for officials acting ultra vires. Specifically,
officials are not protected by immunity when they act without legal authority
or fail to perform a ministerial act as defined by law. This means that if a
government official exceeds their granted authority or their actions conflict
with the law, they are not acting on behalf of the state and are not entitled to
immunity. This is directly relevant to the question of ultra vires claims, as it
outlines the legal framework for when such claims can be made against
government officials in Texas.
