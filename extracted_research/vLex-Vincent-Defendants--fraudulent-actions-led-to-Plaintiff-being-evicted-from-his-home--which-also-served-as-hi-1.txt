Question
Defendants' fraudulent actions led to Plaintiff being evicted from his home,
which also served as his primary place of business. Defendants' actions
caused financial harm to Plaintiff, including the depletion of marital funds
and the cessation of his business operations. Under *Holmes v. Securities
Investor Protection Corp.*, 503 U.S. 258 (1992), RICO requires a direct
relationship between the predicate acts and the injury to the plaintiff’s
business or property. The Defendants' racketeering activities directly caused
Plaintiff's financial losses and the loss of his home, satisfying the proximate
cause requirement for a RICO claim.
Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
The plaintiff likely satisfies the RICO proximate cause requirement
established in Holmes because the financial losses and eviction from his
home/place of business appear to be direct injuries resulting from the
defendants' fraudulent actions rather than derivative or secondary harms.
This direct relationship between the predicate acts of racketeering and the
plaintiff's concrete injuries to business and property provides sufficient
grounds for a civil RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c).
Summary
The plaintiff's case presents a strong argument for satisfying the proximate
cause requirement under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act (RICO). The plaintiff alleges that the defendants'
fraudulent actions directly resulted in his eviction from a property that
served as both his home and primary place of business, causing concrete
financial harm including depletion of marital funds and cessation of business
operations. These circumstances establish the direct relationship between
the defendants' predicate acts and the plaintiff's injuries that is required
under Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corp. and subsequent Third
Circuit precedent.
Under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c), a person injured in their business or property by
reason of a RICO violation may seek civil remedies including treble
damages. The critical element of proximate causation in such claims
requires that the plaintiff's injuries flow directly from the defendant's
racketeering activities rather than being derivative of harm to third parties.
The financial losses and property loss suffered by the plaintiff appear to be
direct consequences of the defendants' alleged fraudulent scheme, not
attenuated or indirect injuries, thus likely fulfilling RICO's proximate cause
requirement as interpreted by the courts.

Background and Relevant Law
Statutory Framework for RICO Civil Claims
The civil remedies provision of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act (RICO) creates a private right of action for individuals
harmed by racketeering activity. Under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c), "Any person
injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962 of
this chapter may sue therefor in any appropriate United States district court
and shall recover threefold the damages he sustains and the cost of the suit,
including a reasonable attorney's fee..." This provision establishes that
individuals who suffer injuries to business or property as a result of RICO
violations may pursue civil remedies.
For a civil RICO claim to succeed, the plaintiff must establish several
elements, including demonstrating that the defendants engaged in a pattern
of racketeering activity through an enterprise affecting interstate
commerce, and that this activity directly caused injury to the plaintiff's
business or property.
The Proximate Cause Requirement under RICO
The seminal case on proximate causation in RICO claims is Holmes v.
Securities Investor Protection Corp., which the plaintiff has correctly cited.
In Holmes, the Supreme Court established that the "by reason of" language
in § 1964(c) requires a direct relationship between the predicate acts of
racketeering and the plaintiff's injuries. This direct relationship requirement
serves as RICO's proximate cause standard.
As explained in Town of Kearny v. Hudson Meadows Urban Renewal Corp.,
829 F.2d 1263 (3rd Cir. 1987), a plaintiff must prove: "(1) a violation of
section 1962 (for example, a person furthering an enterprise through a
pattern of racketeering activity), and (2) an injury directly resulting from
some or all of the activities comprising the violation." This case clarifies that
the injury must flow directly from the predicate acts of racketeering,
fulfilling the proximate cause requirement.
The Third Circuit has consistently followed and applied the Holmes
proximate cause standard. In In re Avandia Mktg. Sales Practices & Prod.
Liab. Litig., 804 F.3d 633 (3rd Cir. 2015), the court elaborated on this
requirement: "Among the 'many shapes' that the doctrine of proximate
cause took at common law 'was a demand for some direct relation between
the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.'" This direct
relationship standard is central to RICO's proximate causation requirement.
The requirement for directness is further emphasized in secondary
materials. As noted in "Chapter 3. Standing," "Since Holmes and Anza, the
directness requirement—the directness of injury to the RICO plaintiff—has
been the paramount consideration guiding proximate cause determinations."
The material explains that courts consider whether "the plaintiff's injury was

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
a direct result of the RICO predicate offenses, rather than being derivative
of, or mediated through, injury to another."
Injury to Business or Property Requirement
For a successful RICO claim, a plaintiff must demonstrate concrete financial
loss to business or property. According to "Defending RICO Claims In The
Business Context Part II," courts have found sufficient injuries in cases
involving "lost profits, excessive interest charges, property damage and
interference with business, such as decreased business profits or increased
costs of doing business."
The "Civil RICO: A Tool of Advocacy" resource emphasizes that "A showing
of injury for a civil RICO claim requires proof of a concrete financial loss and
not mere injury to a valuable intangible property interest." This requirement
ensures that RICO claims are grounded in tangible economic harm rather
than speculative or non-economic injuries.
Elements of a RICO Violation
According to Argiro v. Lamancusa, 23-1820 (3rd Cir. Apr 03, 2024), "To
plead a RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), a plaintiff 'must allege (1)
conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity.'" This case clarifies that predicate acts must be related, showing
"the same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of
commission," and must "amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal
activity."
The "RICO: A Primer" resource further explains that "The heart of a RICO
case is the existence of a pattern of racketeering activity," noting that a
"'pattern' may exist where any combination of two or more offenses
occurred within a period of time." Under section 1962(c), it is a violation to
conduct the affairs of an enterprise affecting interstate or foreign commerce
"through" a pattern of racketeering activity.
Analysis of Proximate Causation in the
Plaintiff's Case
Direct Relationship Between Predicate Acts and Injuries
The plaintiff's allegations present a scenario where the defendants'
fraudulent actions directly resulted in concrete injuries to his business and
property interests. Specifically:
The plaintiff was evicted from his home, which also served as his
primary place of business
The plaintiff suffered financial losses, including depletion of marital
funds
The plaintiff's business operations ceased as a result of the defendants'
actions
1. 
2. 
3. 

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
These alleged injuries meet the direct relationship requirement established
in Holmes and reinforced by Third Circuit precedent. As explained in St.
Luke's Health Network, Inc. v. Lancaster Gen. Hosp., 967 F.3d 295 (3rd Cir.
2020), a plaintiff bringing a civil RICO claim must "state an injury to
business or property" and demonstrate "that a RICO predicate offense 'not
only was a 'but for' cause of injury, but was the proximate cause as well.'"
The court in St. Luke's concluded that when plaintiffs adequately state that
defendants' misrepresentations proximately caused their injury, they satisfy
this requirement.
In this case, the plaintiff's eviction and resulting business closure appear to
be directly traceable to the defendants' fraudulent actions, establishing both
"but for" and proximate causation. The plaintiff's injuries are not derivative
of harm to third parties but are direct consequences of the alleged
racketeering activity, satisfying the directness requirement emphasized in 
Holmes.
The "Chapter Five: The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations
(RICO) Statute" resource reinforces this analysis by noting that "for you to
find that defendant's violation of RICO proximately caused injury to
plaintiff's business or property, plaintiff must establish a direct relationship
between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged." It further
explains that "plaintiff must prove that defendant's conduct was a
substantial factor in the sequence of responsible causation, and that
plaintiff's injury was reasonably foreseeable or anticipated as a natural
consequence of such conduct."
Here, the defendants' fraudulent actions were allegedly a substantial factor
in causing the plaintiff's eviction and business closure, and these injuries
were reasonably foreseeable consequences of the defendants' conduct. The
loss of a home that simultaneously served as a place of business is a
particularly direct injury, as it affects both personal and professional spheres
simultaneously.
Concrete Injuries to Business and Property
The injuries alleged by the plaintiff constitute concrete financial losses to
business and property that satisfy RICO's injury requirement. The eviction
from his home/place of business represents a tangible property loss, while
the cessation of business operations and depletion of marital funds
represent quantifiable economic damages.
As noted in "Civil RICO: A Tool of Advocacy," RICO requires "proof of a
concrete financial loss and not mere injury to a valuable intangible property
interest." The plaintiff's allegations encompass precisely such concrete
financial losses: the loss of physical premises and the cessation of business
operations resulting in lost income.
The "Defending RICO Claims In The Business Context Part II" resource
confirms that "courts have determined that a plaintiff's alleged injuries were
sufficient in cases involving lost profits, excessive interest charges, property
damage and interference with business, such as decreased business profits

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
or increased costs of doing business." The plaintiff's loss of business
operations aligns with these recognized categories of injury under RICO.
Application of Third Circuit Precedent
The Third Circuit's approach to RICO proximate causation supports the
plaintiff's position. In Smith v. Berg, 247 F.3d 532 (3rd Cir. 2001), the court
recognized that injuries must "arise out of the predicate acts" to support a
civil action under section 1964(c). The court concluded that plaintiffs who
are "direct victims of substantive RICO violations" have valid claims when
their injuries are "directly attributable" to the defendants' racketeering.
Here, the plaintiff's eviction and financial losses appear to be directly
attributable to the defendants' fraudulent actions, making the plaintiff a
direct victim of the alleged RICO violations rather than an indirect or
secondary victim.
Similarly, in Shearin v. E.F. Hutton Group, Inc., 885 F.2d 1162 (3rd Cir.
1989), the court stated that "If the defendant engages in a pattern of
racketeering activity in a manner forbidden by these provisions, and the
racketeering activities injure the plaintiff in his business or property, the
plaintiff has a claim under Sec. 1964(c)." It should be noted that Shearin has
been stated as overruled by Turner v. N.J. State Police, Civ. No. 08-5163
(KM) (JBC) (D. N.J. Mar 29, 2017). However, this overruling does not appear
to affect the basic principle cited regarding the relationship between
racketeering activities and injury to business or property, which remains
consistent with more recent Third Circuit precedent.
Single Predicate Act Causing Injury
It's worth noting that even if only some of the defendants' alleged acts
directly caused the plaintiff's injuries, this would still be sufficient for RICO
standing. As explained in "Chapter 3. Standing," "The plaintiff is not obliged
to plead or prove that it has been injured by multiple predicate acts, as long
as it has been injured by at least one predicate act: '[N]o requirement exists
that the plaintiff must suffer an injury from two or more predicate acts, or
from all of the predicate acts.'"
This principle is particularly relevant if the defendants engaged in multiple
fraudulent actions but only some directly resulted in the plaintiff's eviction
and business closure. As long as at least one predicate act caused these
injuries, the proximate cause requirement would be satisfied.
Potential Challenges and Counterarguments
Intervening Causes
One potential challenge to the plaintiff's proximate cause argument could be
the presence of intervening causes between the defendants' fraudulent
actions and the plaintiff's injuries. For instance, if the eviction was carried
out by a third party (such as a landlord or bank) in response to the

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
defendants' fraud, rather than directly by the defendants themselves, this
might raise questions about the directness of the causal relationship.
However, Third Circuit precedent suggests that such intervening actions
would not necessarily break the chain of proximate causation. In In re
Avandia Mktg. Sales Practices & Prod. Liab. Litig., 804 F.3d 633 (3rd Cir.
2015), the court noted that "if there is a sufficiently direct relationship
between the defendant's wrongful conduct and the plaintiffs' injury, the
Court has held that a RICO plaintiff who did not directly rely on a
defendant's misrepresentation can still establish proximate causation."
This suggests that even if the eviction process involved third parties, as long
as there is a "sufficiently direct relationship" between the defendants'
fraudulent actions and the plaintiff's eviction and business closure, the
proximate cause requirement could still be satisfied.
Multiple Causes of Injury
Another potential challenge might arise if there were multiple factors
contributing to the plaintiff's eviction and business closure, beyond just the
defendants' fraudulent actions. In such cases, courts must determine
whether the defendants' conduct was a "substantial factor" in causing the
plaintiff's injuries.
The "Chapter Five" resource addresses this issue by noting that "plaintiff
must prove that defendant's conduct was a substantial factor in the
sequence of responsible causation, and that plaintiff's injury was reasonably
foreseeable or anticipated as a natural consequence of such conduct." As
long as the defendants' fraudulent actions were a substantial factor in the
causal sequence leading to the plaintiff's injuries, and those injuries were
reasonably foreseeable consequences of the defendants' conduct, the
proximate cause requirement should be satisfied.
Distinction Between Personal and Business Injuries
Given that the plaintiff's home also served as his place of business, there
could be questions about distinguishing between personal injuries (which
are generally not recoverable under RICO) and business or property injuries
(which are recoverable).
However, the facts presented involve clear injuries to business (cessation of
operations) and property (eviction from premises used for business), both of
which are explicitly covered under RICO's "business or property" language.
The dual nature of the premises as both home and business place actually
strengthens the plaintiff's claim, as it demonstrates that the defendants'
actions directly impacted both his personal property interests and his
business operations simultaneously.

Conclusion
Based on the statutory framework of 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c) and the proximate
cause standard established in Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corp.
and subsequent Third Circuit precedent, the plaintiff's allegations present a
compelling case for satisfying RICO's proximate cause requirement.
The direct relationship between the defendants' fraudulent actions and the
plaintiff's concrete injuries to business and property—specifically, eviction
from his home/place of business, depletion of marital funds, and cessation of
business operations—establishes the direct causation required under RICO.
These injuries are not derivative or attenuated consequences but flow
directly from the alleged predicate acts of racketeering.
As articulated in St. Luke's Health Network, Inc. v. Lancaster Gen. Hosp.,
967 F.3d 295 (3rd Cir. 2020), the plaintiff's injuries appear to satisfy both the
"but for" and proximate cause requirements for a civil RICO claim. The
direct impact of the defendants' actions on the plaintiff's business operations
and property interests establishes the "direct relation between the injury
asserted and the injurious conduct alleged" demanded by the Holmes
standard.
While some challenges might arise regarding intervening causes or multiple
factors contributing to the plaintiff's injuries, Third Circuit precedent
suggests that as long as the defendants' conduct was a substantial factor in
the causal sequence and the injuries were reasonably foreseeable
consequences, the proximate cause requirement should be satisfied.
In sum, the plaintiff's allegations that the defendants' fraudulent actions
directly caused his eviction from a property that served as both home and
business place, resulting in concrete financial losses and business cessation,
present a strong case for meeting RICO's proximate cause requirement as
interpreted by the Supreme Court in Holmes and reinforced through Third
Circuit precedent.

Summary
Requirements for a civil RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c), emphasizing
the need for a direct relationship between the predicate acts and the injury
to the plaintiff’s business or property. It highlights that the plaintiff must
demonstrate that the RICO predicate offense was both a 'but for' and
proximate cause of the injury. The case further illustrates the application of
these principles by concluding that the plaintiffs in that case adequately
stated that the defendants' misrepresentation proximately caused their
injury. This supports the proposition by showing that if the Defendants'
fraudulent actions directly caused the Plaintiff's financial losses and
eviction, it would satisfy the proximate cause requirement for a RICO claim.

Extract
In addition to cognizable injury, a RICO plaintiff must satisfy RICO's
proximate causation requirements. ... The Holmes Court found the remedy
for this overbreadth in the doctrine of 'proximate cause.' ... Among the
'many shapes' that the doctrine of proximate cause took at common law 'was
a demand for some direct relation between the injury asserted and the
injurious conduct alleged.' ... In contrast, however, if there is a sufficiently
direct relationship between the defendant's wrongful conduct and the
plaintiffs' injury, the Court has held that a RICO plaintiff who did not directly
rely on a defendant's misrepresentation can still establish proximate
causation.
Summary
Requirement for a RICO plaintiff to demonstrate a direct relationship
between the defendant's wrongful conduct and the plaintiff's injury, as
established in *Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corp.* This aligns
with the proposition that the Defendants' fraudulent actions directly caused
the Plaintiff's financial losses and eviction, satisfying the proximate cause
requirement for a RICO claim.

U.S. Court of Appeals — Third Circuit

=== PAGE 9 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
The plaintiffs here alleged that the defendants had violated 18 U.S.C. Sec.
1962(c), which provides that it shall be unlawful for 'any person' associated
with an enterprise in interstate commerce to conduct the affairs of the
enterprise through a pattern of 'racketeering activity.' ... 'any person injured
in his business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962' has a
civil action for treble damages. 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1964(c). On its face,
therefore, RICO does not require anything more to make out a civil claim
than to make out a criminal case.
Summary
For a civil RICO claim, the statute does not require additional elements
beyond those needed for a criminal RICO case. Specifically, it emphasizes
that a person injured in their business or property due to a RICO violation
can seek treble damages. This supports the proposition by affirming that if
the Defendants' actions constituted racketeering activity that directly
caused the Plaintiff's financial harm, then the Plaintiff has a valid RICO
claim.

To plead a RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), a plaintiff 'must allege (1)
conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity.' ... Predicate acts are related if they 'have the same or similar
purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of commission, or
otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not
isolated events.' ... And, the relatedness of predicate acts is not the only
requirement for a 'pattern of racketeering activity.' The predicate acts must
also amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity.
Summary
To establish a RICO claim, a plaintiff must demonstrate conduct of an
enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. The passage explains
that predicate acts must be related and pose a threat of continued criminal
activity. This supports the proposition by outlining the necessary elements to
establish a RICO claim, which includes demonstrating a direct relationship
between the predicate acts and the injury to the plaintiff’s business or
property.

U.S. Court of Appeals — Third Circuit
Extract
The Sedima opinion makes plain that the injury which confers standing on a
RICO plaintiff is injury flowing from the commission of the predicate act, not
injury flowing from the pattern of such acts. 473 U.S. at 495, 105 S.Ct. at
3285... Rather we believe a plaintiff must prove only: (1) a violation of
section 1962 (for example, a person furthering an enterprise through a
pattern of racketeering activity), and (2) an injury directly resulting from
some or all of the activities comprising the violation.
Summary
The court clarifies the requirements for a RICO claim, emphasizing that the
injury must flow directly from the predicate acts of racketeering, not
necessarily from the entire pattern. This supports the proposition by
aligning with the requirement that the Defendants' actions directly caused
the Plaintiff's financial losses and eviction, satisfying the proximate cause
requirement under RICO.
Smith v. Berg, 247 F.3d 532 (3rd Cir. 2001)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Third Circuit
Extract
The holding of Beck is that an injury sufficient to support a civil action under
section 1964(c) must arise out of wrongful conduct proscribed by the
substantive provisions of section 1962 (i.e., in the context of a section
1962(c) violation, the injury must arise out of the predicate acts). As the
District Court correctly concluded, the Plaintiffs' claims in this case stem
from injury directly attributable to Berg's racketeering; they are the direct
victims of substantive RICO violations.
Summary
The court in "Smith v. Berg" recognized that for a RICO claim to be valid,
the injury must directly result from the predicate acts of racketeering. This
aligns with the proposition that the Defendants' racketeering activities
directly caused the Plaintiff's financial losses and the loss of his home, thus
satisfying the proximate cause requirement for a RICO claim.

Chapter 3. Standing
Civil RICO: A Definitive Guide. Fifth Edition - American Bar
Association - Gregory P. Joseph
Extract
Since Holmes and Anza, the directness requirement—the directness of
injury to the RICO plaintiff—has been the paramount consideration guiding
proximate cause determinations. Examining the nuances of this issue, courts
consider whether, among other things • the plaintiff’s injury was a direct
result of the RICO predicate offenses, rather than being derivative of, or
mediated through, injury to another; ... As long as the pattern of
racketeering activity has caused harm to the plaintiff’s business or property,
the plaintiff has RICO standing. The plaintiff is not obliged to plead or prove
that it has been injured by multiple predicate acts, as long as it has been
injured by at least one predicate act: '[N]o requirement exists that the
plaintiff must suffer an injury from two or more predicate acts, or from all of
the predicate acts. Thus, a RICO verdict can be sustained when a pattern of
racketeering acts existed, but when only one act caused injury.'
Summary
The directness of the injury to the plaintiff is crucial in RICO claims. The
passage emphasizes that the injury must be a direct result of the RICO
predicate offenses. It also clarifies that a plaintiff can have standing if
harmed by at least one predicate act, even if not all acts caused injury. This
supports the proposition that the Defendants' actions directly caused the
Plaintiff's financial losses and eviction, satisfying the proximate cause
requirement under RICO.

Robert W. Dibert
Extract
For you to find that defendant’s violation of RICO proximately caused injury
to plaintiff’s business or property, plaintiff must establish a direct
relationship between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.
In other words, plaintiff must prove that defendant’s conduct was a
substantial factor in the sequence of responsible causation, and that
plaintiff’s injury was reasonably foreseeable or anticipated as a natural
consequence of such conduct. It is not enough that the defendant has
committed a RICO violation, and that the plaintiff has suffered some injury.
Instead, there must be a direct and proximate link between the two.
Summary
The passage explains the requirement for a direct relationship between the
defendant's conduct and the plaintiff's injury under RICO, as established by
the Supreme Court in cases like *Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection
Corp.* This supports the proposition by emphasizing that the plaintiff must
show that the defendants' fraudulent actions were a substantial factor in
causing the financial harm and loss of property, which aligns with the
requirement for a RICO claim.

Extract
In Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corp.(119) following antitrust
precedent, the Court held that the 'by reason of' clause in 18 U.S.C.
[sections] 1964(c) imposed a 'proximate cause' burden on a plaintiff, that is,
a showing that his or her injury was not only caused in fact, but
'proximately' caused by the violation. In Holmes, the Court followed the
direct/indirect rule of the common law, excluding injury to the customer of a
brokerage suffered by reason of injury through a stock manipulation scheme
to the brokerage, but leaving open a possible suit for injury directly suffered
by reason of a stock parking scheme that defrauded the regulatory process
where the scheme that extended the life of the brokerage and magnified the
customer's injury.
Summary
The *Holmes* decision is pivotal in establishing the requirement of
proximate cause in RICO claims. The passage explains that the injury must

be directly caused by the violation, which aligns with the proposition that
the Defendants' actions directly caused the Plaintiff's financial losses and

Extract
A showing of injury for a civil RICO claim requires proof of a concrete
financial loss and not mere injury to a valuable intangible property interest...
the 'by reason of' language of § 1964(c) imposes a proximate cause
requirement on the plaintiff. The § 1962 violations must proximately cause
the plaintiff’s injury to business or property... RICO’s prohibitions may be
enforced in both criminal and civil contexts. In the context of a civil action, a
plaintiff must be directly injured by reason of the defendant’s racketeering
activities. Proximate cause, as an aspect of RICO’s 'by reason of' standard,
requires a RICO plaintiff to show that the defendant’s racketeering offenses
led directly to the plaintiff’s injuries.
Summary
For a civil RICO claim, the plaintiff must demonstrate a concrete financial
loss directly caused by the defendant's racketeering activities. The passage
emphasizes the necessity of proving proximate cause, meaning the
defendant's actions must have directly led to the plaintiff's injury. This aligns
with the proposition that the Defendants' fraudulent actions directly caused
the Plaintiff's financial harm and loss of home, satisfying the proximate
cause requirement under RICO.
RICO: A Primer
Extract
RICO provides for a civil action against persons engaged in a 'pattern of
racketeering activity' or 'collection of an unlawful debt.' A successful
plaintiff may recover treble damages, costs, and attorneys' fees. ... The heart
of a RICO case is the existence of a pattern of racketeering activity. ... A
'pattern' may exist where any combination of two or more offenses occurred
within a period of time. ... Under section 1962(c), it is a violation to conduct
the affairs of an enterprise affecting interstate or foreign commerce
'through' a pattern of racketeering activity or through the alternative theory
of collection of an unlawful debt.

Defending RICO Claims In The Business Context Part II: RICO Claims Must
Allege Injury To Business Or Property
Extract
If a plaintiff brings a civil suit alleging a RICO violation, the plaintiff must
plausibly allege that his injury animating the RICO claim is associated with
his business or property by reason of the defendant's violation of the RICO
laws. ... the plaintiff must allege that he suffered an injury to his business or
property that bears some causal relationship to the alleged act or acts that
violated RICO. ... courts have determined that a plaintiff's alleged injuries
were sufficient in cases involving lost profits, excessive interest charges,
property damage and interference with business, such as decreased
business profits or increased costs of doing business. ... the alleged injury to
a plaintiff's business or property must be both factually and proximately
caused by the defendant's alleged violation of RICO.
Summary
For a RICO claim to be valid, the plaintiff must allege a concrete financial
loss to business or property that is directly caused by the defendant's
actions. The passage supports the proposition by emphasizing the need for a
direct causal relationship between the defendant's actions and the plaintiff's
financial losses, which aligns with the requirement under *Holmes v.
Securities Investor Protection Corp.* for proximate cause in RICO claims.
