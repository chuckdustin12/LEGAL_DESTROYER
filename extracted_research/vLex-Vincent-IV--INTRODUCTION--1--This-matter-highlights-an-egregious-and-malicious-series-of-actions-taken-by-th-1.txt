Question
IV. INTRODUCTION 1. This matter highlights an egregious and malicious
series of actions taken by the Defendants which had four primary purposes:
1) to deprive the Plaintiff of his constitutionally protected property rights 2)
by misleading the Texas courts through several false statements 3) in order
to provide Defendant Myers with an advantage in divorce proceedings 4)
which intent to finalize. 2. The elaborate scheme consisted of intentional
deception, interstate travel, interstate communications, and the use of the
U.S. Marshall service to effectuate service of these knowingly fraudulent
documents. 3. First, Defendant Branthoover utilized interstate
communications to assist Defendant Myers in seeking an ex-parte temporary
order of protection in the Texas State courts. 4. Second, when this attempt
failed, Branthoover made contact with Plaintiff under the guise of offering
assistance, which involved Myers traveling to his residence in Oklahoma
under false pretenses. 5. Third, after Plaintiff agreed to Myers visiting his
residence for purposes of “getting space”, the Defendants began executing
their fraudulent scheme by working together to empty the joint-marital bank
account into Branthoover’s PayPal, which was later transferred to Myers’
private bank account. 6. Fourth, when confronted with this transfer,
Branthoover disclosed his true intentions, which was to help Myers draft
and prepare legal document to later be submitted in Texas courts, and
began to act like her legal representative. 7. Fifth, the proceeds from the
transfer of funds across state lines was used to purchase a second phone in
furtherance of the scheme for Myers, which was used on the documents
prepared in Oklahoma to be later submitted in Texas. 8. These documents
contained several false statements designed to influence Texas State court
proceedings to the Plaintiff’s detriment, which succeeded on January 16,
2024. 9. In response, Plaintiff began zealously advocating for his rights in
State court while Defendants continued to communicate with each other
regarding the proceedings as recently as May 24, 2025. 10. Throughout the
State court proceedings, Branthoover consistently threatened and harassed
Plaintiff via interstate communications, showing malicious intent and
admitting to his involvement. 11. Both Defendants knew of the false
statements made in these pleadings, and knew that doing so would
significantly prejudice the Plaintiff. V. STATEMENT OF FACTS 21. Plaintiff
realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations contained in
paragraphs 1 through 20 above, as if fully set forth herein. A. Party
References 22. For clarity and ease of reference throughout this Complaint,
the parties shall be referred to as follows: i. Plaintiff Charles Dustin Myers
shall be referred to herein as “Plaintiff ” and is the husband of Morgan
Michelle Myers. ii. Defendant Daniel Kenneth Branthoover shall be referred
to herein as “Branthoover” and is identified as the stepfather of Defendant
Morgan Michelle Myers. iii. Defendant Morgan Michelle Myers shall be
referred to herein as “Myers” and is identified as the spouse of Plaintiff
Charles Dustin Myers and stepdaughter of Branthoover. 23. At all relevant
times, Defendant Myers has not raised any defenses to these claims in State
court and has ignored all settlement offers made in an attempt to avoid this
lawsuit. 24. At all relevant times, Defendants have maintained
communications regarding the affairs of the enterprise’s purpose. B.

Formation of the Enterprise (December 14 – 15, 2023) 25. Defendant
Branthoover has extensive knowledge of protective orders given his prior
criminal convictions. 26. On December 14, 2023, in response to the
discovery of an extramarital affair by the Plaintiff, Defendant Myers opened
a private bank account in her own name and began interstate
communications with Branthoover via text message. In total, Myers and
Branthoover exchanged a total of 92 text messages between Branthoover’s
number registered as 940-312-3434, and Myers’ number registered as
817-235-5189 on this date. 27. Also on December 14, 2023, Defendant
Myers, without legitimate cause or factual basis, sought an ex-parte order of
protection against Plaintiff while in communications with Branthoover. 28.
Later on the evening of December 14, 2023, in a stark contrast to her earlier
emergency request for a protective order, Defendant Myers reminded
Plaintiff of a school field trip scheduled for the following day, thereby
attempting to maintain a facade of normalcy and prevent Plaintiff from
suspecting of her fraudulent intentions. C. Deception, Transfer, and Planned
Interstate Travel (December 15–17, 2023) 29. On December 15, 2023,
Plaintiff was contacted by Branthoover at 9:51 A.M. CST, where he stated
“I’ve been where you are before. I want to help both of you” regarding a
recent divorce announcement made by Myers on December 1, 2023. 30.
During this phone conversation, it was established that Myers would visit his
residence over the weekend of December 15, 2023, located within this
district, for the purpose of “providing space” to Myers. 31. At this time, it’s
important to note that Plaintiff had no knowledge of the ex-parte attempt
made the day prior, and he had no reason to believe that Branthoover was
being dishonest about his intentions for Myers’ visit to his residence. 32.
Immediately after the call, Plaintiff received notice that Myers had
transferred $1,576 from the parties’ joint–marital PNC account to
Branthoover’s PayPal account (username “dmb575”), depleting the
account’s balance. 33. On December 16, 2023, Plaintiff received notification
that the joint marital PNC bank account was overdrawn by -$800.00.
Concurrently, Plaintiff was informed that advertisements related to his
legitimate at-home business had ceased running due to a failure of payment.
34. The PNC bank statement for December 2023 clearly documents the
occurrence of this transaction, demonstrating the precise date and amount
of the unauthorized withdrawal. 36. The PayPal identifier “dmb575” directly
matches the information associated with the fraudulent transfer on
Plaintiff’s bank statement for December of 2023, linking Defendant
Branthoover to the illicit financial maneuver notwithstanding his admissions
via text message. 37. On December 16, 2023, at precisely 3:54 P.M. Central
Standard Time, Plaintiff, to mitigate the financial damage and resolve the
situation amicably, sent a text message to Defendant Branthoover. In this
message, Plaintiff explicitly requested the return of the $1,576.00 that had
been fraudulently transferred, detailing the intended use of the funds, the
late bills resulting from misappropriation, his inability to work due to the
severe mental anguish caused by the Defendants’ actions, and his sincere
desire for an amicable resolution given the time of year. 38. In a callous and
dismissive response to Plaintiff’s plea, Defendant Branthoover informed
Plaintiff via text message that “You Are Getting Divorced” and further
stated, “I hope I can help with the paperwork and make things go as
smoothly as possible.” This communication, far from helping as initially
stated by Branthoover, served as a direct threat and an overt act in

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
furtherance of the conspiracy, demonstrating Branthoover’s intent to exploit
Plaintiff’s distress for the benefit of the enterprise. 39. At no time relevant to
this Complaint has Defendant Branthoover possessed a license to practice
law in any state within the United States. In subsequent texts, his
statements regarding “paperwork” and making things “go as smoothly as
possible” constituted the unauthorized practice of law and that he held an
administrative role over the affairs of the enterprise. D. Eviction Attempt
Influenced by Myers in Furtherance of the Scheme (December 17–22, 2023)
40. On December 17, 2023, at approximately 11:00 A.M., Plaintiff was
served with an eviction notice by the grandmother of Myers, which
contained the following false information: i. A purported “lease violation,”
which was entirely fabricated as no valid lease agreement existed between
Plaintiff and Wilson; ii. The assertion that “Granddaughter getting divorced,”
referring to Defendant Myers, as a basis for eviction; iii. The false claim that
a “Protective order has been filed.” iv. The directive that “He must leave.
She and the girls may stay,” demonstrating the clear intent to dispossess
Plaintiff for the benefit of Myers. 41. Defendant Myers was physically
present in Oklahoma with Defendant Branthoover, actively collaborating in
the drafting of the very documents referenced in the frivolous eviction
notice, thereby demonstrating clear premeditation and coordination of the
scheme. 42. Defendant Myers possessed actual knowledge that no valid
lease agreement existed, and on December 17, 2023, Myers herself
physically tore the fraudulent eviction notice in half and wrote “VOID” on
the document in black sharpie, showing her influence over the attempt. E. A
Narrative of Protection, Secondary Phone, and Initiation of Suit 43.
Defendant Myers also returned from Oklahoma with a can of pepper spray
mace to further the narrative of protection first established on December 14,
2023, in her ex-parte attempt. 44. On the evening of December 17, 2023,
Defendant Morgan Michelle Myers explicitly disclosed to Plaintiff Charles
Dustin Myers that she had acquired a secondary phone number while in
Oklahoma, registered under the number 817-940-0852. This acquisition was
a deliberate act of concealment and an overt act in furtherance of the
enterprise, designed to facilitate clandestine communications related to the
fraudulent scheme. 45. This newly acquired phone number (817-940-0852)
was subsequently used on a series of fraudulent legal documents prepared
under the direct administrative oversight of Defendant Branthoover, with his
full knowledge and participation. These documents, which were prepared in
Oklahoma and designed to unlawfully influence legal proceedings in Texas,
included: i. An “Original Petition for Divorce,” dated December 18, 2023,
which contained numerous false statements. ii. An “Affidavit of Indigency,”
dated December 18, 2023, which contained material misrepresentations
regarding Defendant Myers’ financial status. iii. A “Request for Uncontested
Cases,” dated December 18, 2023, which was filed despite Plaintiff not
conversing with defendant Myers regarding any divorce litigation. iv. An
“Application for Protective Order,” dated December 22, 2023, which was
based on fabricated allegations of family violence. F. Continued Obstruction
and Unauthorized Practice of Law 46. After the initial divorce paperwork
was filed on December 18, 2023, Defendant Branthoover, continuing his
unauthorized practice of law and his role in the conspiracy, sent a text
message to Plaintiff stating: “Charlie, it’s come to my understanding you
have retained an attorney. I’m sure he has told you that all further
communication should take place between attorneys. I must formally ask

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
you refrain from discussing details of this case with my client moving
forward and only communicate with me or your attorney.” (emphasis added)
This communication was a deliberate attempt to isolate Plaintiff from direct
communication with Myers and to control the flow of information, thereby
hindering Plaintiff’s ability to uncover the full extent of the fraudulent
scheme. This communication also evidences that Branthoover’s role went
beyond helping Myers prepare the documents by seeing them through to
their submission and asserted an administrative role over the proceedings in
an attempt to intimidate Plaintiff. G. Service by US Marshall 47. In
furtherance of the scheme, and despite still cohabitating with Plaintiff,
defendant Myers knowingly and intentionally utilized the United States
Marshall Service to effectuate service of the misleading documents on
Plaintiff, thereby using an instrumentality of interstate commerce to further
the illicit enterprise, which occurred on December 27, 2023. 48. In
furtherance of the scheme, and despite living next-door to Plaintiff,
defendant Myers knowingly and intentionally influenced an eviction
proceeding and utilized the United States Marshall Service to effectuate
service of the misleading documents on Plaintiff, which occurred on
December 28, 2023. H. False Statements – Divorce Petition and Affidavit of
Indigency (Dec. 18, 2023) 49. When reviewing the documents prepared in
part by Branthoover and filed with the court by Myers, there existed several
false statements and were intended to deceive the court and prejudice
Plaintiff in furtherance of the scheme to dispose him of his property
interests. Specifically, these false statements included, but were not limited
to: i. The assertion that the spouses had ceased living together on December
1, 2023, when in fact they were still residing together at the marital home
on that date and for several weeks thereafter. ii. The claim that Defendant
Myers owned both family vehicles as her separate property prior to the
marriage, which was demonstrably false as these vehicles were acquired
during the marriage and constituted community property, paid for by
Plaintiff. iii. The representation that Defendant Myers had an active order of
protection against Plaintiff with a judicial finding that family violence had
occurred during the marriage, which was fabricated and without any basis
in fact or law. iv. The assertion that the children or Defendant Myers would
be subjected to harassment or abuse if Plaintiff were provided with her
second phone number (817-940-0852) acquired in Oklahoma, which was a
baseless and manipulative claim designed to conceal her communications
related to the fraudulent scheme. 50. Concurrently with the fraudulent
divorce petition, Defendant Myers, again with the administrative oversight
and full knowledge of Defendant Branthoover, filed a fraudulent “Affidavit of
Indigency” with the court. This affidavit contained material
misrepresentations regarding Defendant Myers’ financial status, all of which
were known to be false at the time of filing and were intended to defraud the
court and avoid legitimate court costs. Specifically, these false statements
included, but were not limited to: i. The claim that Defendant Myers was
financially indigent and unable to pay court costs, despite her access to and
control over substantial marital assets. ii. The representation that Defendant
Myers was solely responsible for all family living expenses, including rent,
utilities, food, and other living expenses, when in fact, Plaintiff was the
primary breadwinner of the household at that time. iii. The assertion that
Defendant Myers was solely responsible for both car payments, which she
has no payment history to support such a claim. I. False Statements –

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Application for Protective Order (Dec. 22, 2023) 51. Defendant was served
with an Application for a Protective Order on December 22, 2023, filed by
Myers, despite her claim to already have an existing order in her Original
Petition for Divorce. 52. Upon review, defendant Myers made additional
false statements within the sworn document, all intended to further deceive
the court and secure an unwarranted protective order against Plaintiff to
effectuate the enterprises’ goal of divesting him of his property interests.
These false statements included, but were not limited to: i. The claim that
family violence occurred on December 18, 2023, in the presence of the
children, which was entirely false and fabricated. ii. The assertion that
family violence occurred prior to December 18, 2023, which was also false
and without any factual basis. iii. The request that Plaintiff take a battering
intervention program. J. A Clear Objective 53. The common and overarching
objectives shared among Defendant Myers when reviewing these documents
(through the administration and direction of Defendant Branthoover) and
with the active participation of Myers’ grandmother, were multifaceted:
primarily, to unlawfully remove Plaintiff from his residence, which was
essential for his livelihood and the family’s financial well-being; secondarily,
to gain an unfair and illicit advantage in the ongoing divorce proceedings
between Plaintiff and Defendant Myers; and ultimately, to finalize the
divorce on terms unilaterally favorable to Defendant Myers, thereby making
the unlawful deprivation of Plaintiff’s rights and property permanent and to
escape accountability for the conduct alleged herein. K. Primary Objective
Success 54. On January 16, 2024, the parties appeared before the 322nd
District Court of Tarrant County, and the initial objective of the Defendants’
scheme succeeded when Plaintiff was ordered to vacate the family home
without any findings or without a hearing taking place. 55. The significance
of the misinformation presented to the court could have been the only
reason for this decision, and it afforded Myers the advantage that she and
Branthoover had anticipated. K. Pattern of Racketeering Activity and
Continuity 56. Between January 16, 2024, and the present day, Defendants
Myers and Branthoover have continued to further their racketeering activity
through a series of ongoing illicit acts, demonstrating a clear pattern of
continuity and relatedness. These acts include, but are not limited to: i.
Myers and Branthoover continuing to engage in illicit communications
regarding case details between one another across state lines, specifically
between Texas and Oklahoma, in direct furtherance of their fraudulent
scheme to see the divorce through to its’ finalization. ii. Branthoover
delivering ongoing threats and intimidation to Plaintiff regarding his
legitimate attempts to seek legal relief from the orders that were a product
of the Defendants’ actions, which occurred in December of 2023, June of
2024, December of 2024, and May of 2025. iii. Making direct statements
such as “I’ve been enjoying watching every filing get denied” by
Branthoover, showing the malicious intent behind his involvement. 57. On
June 23, 2024, Defendant Branthoover, continuing his pattern of harassment
and intimidation, sent a text message to Plaintiff stating, “Lol. And here
comes another denial,” in direct reference to a pleading filed in the Texas
State courts by Plaintiff seeking to enjoin Branthoover as a party to the
divorce proceedings. This communication demonstrates Branthoover’s
awareness of and continued involvement in the legal proceedings and his
malicious intent to mock Plaintiff’s efforts to seek justice. 58. On December
12, 2024, Defendant Branthoover sent a text message to Plaintiff explicitly

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
threatening future action by stating, “When things all over you get to deal
with me. Just a heads up.” This communication constitutes a direct threat of
future harm and further evidence of the Defendants’ future threat of
criminal activity. 59. On May 24, 2025, Defendant Branthoover sent a text
message to Plaintiff containing a direct and severe threat, stating, “Where’s
my lawsuit? Heard your vm about me. File it. Let’s do this :)” This malicious
communication is a clear act of intimidation and further evidence of the
Defendants’ collaboration throughout the proceedings with Defendant
Myers. List all RICO violations here and if this is enough for a RICO claim
Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
Based on the facts presented, the plaintiff has viable claims for multiple
RICO violations under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) (conducting enterprise affairs
through a pattern of racketeering activity) and § 1962(d) (conspiracy),
supported by predicate acts of wire fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343), mail fraud (18
U.S.C. § 1341), and potentially interference with commerce (18 U.S.C. §
1951).
Summary
The facts establish a potential RICO case with all required elements: (1)
persons (Branthoover and Myers) who engaged in (2) a pattern of
racketeering activity connected to (3) an enterprise. The acts described
demonstrate multiple predicate offenses including wire fraud through
interstate communications, mail fraud through use of the U.S. Marshal
Service for document delivery, and potentially interference with commerce
through extortion. These activities occurred in a coordinated fashion over a
substantial time period (December 2023 to May 2025), demonstrating both
relationship among the predicate acts and continuity.
The pattern of activity shows closed-ended continuity through repeated
related acts extending over more than a year, and open-ended continuity
through the nature of the enterprise and ongoing threats. The defendants
appear to have formed an association-in-fact enterprise with the common
purpose of depriving the plaintiff of property rights through fraudulent
divorce proceedings, with both defendants playing distinct roles in the
scheme. The alleged conduct involved interstate commerce, satisfying
RICO's jurisdictional requirement.
Background and Relevant Law
RICO Legislative Framework
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), codified at
18 U.S.C. §§ 1961-1968, provides both criminal penalties and civil remedies
for certain prohibited activities. The statute was originally designed to

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
combat organized crime but has been expanded to address a broader range
of coordinated criminal activity.
Under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c), "[a]ny person injured in his business or property
by reason of a violation of section 1962 of this chapter may sue therefor in
any appropriate United States district court and shall recover threefold the
damages he sustains and the cost of the suit, including a reasonable
attorney's fee." This provision establishes a civil right of action for RICO
violations.
18 U.S.C. § 1962 outlines four distinct prohibited activities:
Using income derived from racketeering activity to invest in an
enterprise (§ 1962(a))
Acquiring or maintaining an interest in an enterprise through
racketeering activity (§ 1962(b))
Conducting the affairs of an enterprise through a pattern of
racketeering activity (§ 1962(c))
Conspiring to violate subsections (a), (b), or (c) (§ 1962(d))
The statute specifically provides under § 1962(c): "It shall be unlawful for
any person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the
activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or
participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs
through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt."
18 U.S.C. § 1961(1) defines "racketeering activity" to include numerous
federal and state crimes, including "any act which is indictable under any of
the following provisions of title 18, United States Code: [...] section 1341
(relating to mail fraud), section 1343 (relating to wire fraud), [...] section
1951 (relating to interference with commerce, robbery, or extortion)."
A "pattern of racketeering activity" under 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5) "requires at
least two acts of racketeering activity, one of which occurred after the
effective date of this chapter and the last of which occurred within ten years
[...] after the commission of a prior act of racketeering activity."
Judicial Interpretation of RICO Requirements
Courts have consistently highlighted three essential elements for
establishing a civil RICO claim. As stated in Peel v. cPaperless LLC, 4:23-
CV-02417 (S.D. Tex. Nov 08, 2024): "To state a civil RICO claim under 18
U.S.C. § 1962, a plaintiff must allege three common elements: '(1) a person
who engages in (2) a pattern of racketeering activity, (3) connected to the
acquisition, establishment, conduct, or control of an enterprise.'"
The same elements are reiterated in Bustos v. Invierte En Tex., 4:22-
CV-02690 (S.D. Tex. Jun 03, 2024), which adds that "an act of 'racketeering
activity,' commonly referred to as a 'predicate act,' is defined to include
certain criminal acts, including mail and wire fraud."
In Alvarez v. Rosas, CIVIL ACTION NO. H-18-4646 (S.D. Tex. Apr 29, 2020),
the court elaborated that "in order to rise to the level of 'racketeering
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
activity' there must be 'two or more predicate criminal acts that are (1)
related and (2) amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity.'"
Pattern Requirement
The pattern requirement has been interpreted to require both "relationship"
and "continuity" among predicate acts. As noted in Allstate Ins. Co. v.
Donovan, CIVIL ACTION NO. H-12-0432 (S.D. Tex. Jul 03, 2012):
"'A pattern of racketeering activity consists of two or more predicate
criminal acts that are (1) related and (2) amount to or pose a threat of
continued criminal activity.' [...] Because RICO reaches only those unlawful
activities that amount to or threaten long-term criminal activity, a RICO
complaint must allege that 'the racketeering predicates are related, and that
they amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity.'"
The court further explained that "'Criminal conduct forms a pattern if it
embraces criminal acts that have the same or similar purposes, results,
participants, victims, or methods of commission, or otherwise are
interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not isolated
events.' [...] 'Continuity' is both a closed- and open-ended concept, referring
either to a closed period of repeated conduct, or to past conduct that by its
nature projects into the future with a threat of repetition."
Predicate Acts: Mail and Wire Fraud
In re Enron Corp. Securities, Derivative & Erisa, 284 F.Supp.2d 511 (S.D.
Tex. 2003) outlines the elements of mail and wire fraud: "The elements
comprising mail and wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1341 and § 1343 are (1)
the defendant's participation in a scheme to defraud, which includes false or
fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises; (2) the use of the mails
or wire communications to execute the scheme; and (3) specific intent to
defraud."
Bradley v. Phillips Petroleum Co., 527 F.Supp.2d 625 (S.D. Tex. 2007) further
specifies that articulating fraud with particularity "requires a plaintiff to
specify the statements contended to be fraudulent, identify the speaker,
state when and where the statements were made, and explain why the
statements were fraudulent."
Enterprise Requirement
An enterprise under RICO encompasses "any individual, partnership,
corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of
individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity." Courts have
interpreted "enterprise" broadly to include both legitimate and illegitimate
enterprises.
Trevino v. Pechero, 592 F.Supp.2d 939 (S.D. Tex. 2008) emphasizes the
interstate commerce nexus: "Because RICO is a federal statute, the
racketeering must have at least a minimal nexus with interstate commerce."

RICO in Divorce Proceedings
The application of RICO in family law contexts is addressed in secondary
sources. According to "Racketeer influenced and corrupt
organizations" (2007), civil RICO claims have been attempted in divorce
cases with limited success, but can potentially succeed if:
"(i) the plaintiff must show an injury to business or property because of the
divorce proceedings; (ii) the plaintiff must show that the defendant acted as
part of an enterprise to further the act of hiding assets to minimize divorce
settlements; and (iii) there must be either multiple violations of the same
predicate act, or the commission of more than one predicate act."
Analysis of Potential RICO Claims in this Case
Person Requirement
The "person" requirement is straightforwardly satisfied as both defendants,
Morgan Michelle Myers and Daniel Kenneth Branthoover, are individuals
capable of holding legal or beneficial interest in property as required under
RICO.
Enterprise Requirement
The facts strongly support the existence of an "association-in-fact"
enterprise between Myers and Branthoover. "Civil Rico: A Tool of
Advocacy" (2024) defines an enterprise as a "structured group of individuals
associated for a common purpose." The allegations demonstrate:
A structured relationship: Branthoover acted in an administrative
capacity, directing Myers' actions, preparing documents, and
representing himself as her de facto legal representative.
Common purpose: The defendants worked together to (a) deprive the
plaintiff of property rights, (b) provide Myers with an advantage in
divorce proceedings, and (c) finalize the divorce on favorable terms for
Myers.
Coordination of activities: The defendants engaged in coordinated,
calculated actions starting with the communications on December 14,
2023, continuing through the fraudulent transfer of funds, interstate
travel, preparation of misleading legal documents, and ongoing
interference with plaintiff's efforts through May 2025.
Branthoover explicitly stated his role when he told the plaintiff, "I hope I can
help with the paperwork and make things go as smoothly as possible" and
later referred to Myers as "my client" while attempting to control
communications. This shows the structured relationship between the
defendants, with Branthoover assuming an administrative role in the
enterprise despite lacking legal credentials.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
The enterprise clearly affected interstate commerce, satisfying the
jurisdictional requirement outlined in Trevino v. Pechero, 592 F.Supp.2d 939
(S.D. Tex. 2008). The activities spanned multiple states (Texas and
Oklahoma), involved interstate wire communications, interstate travel, and
the transfer of funds across state lines.
Pattern of Racketeering Activity
Predicate Acts
The facts support multiple predicate acts qualifying as "racketeering
activity" under 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1):
Wire Fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343): The defendants used interstate wire
communications to further their fraudulent scheme on numerous
occasions. As outlined in In re Enron Corp. Securities, Derivative &
Erisa, 284 F.Supp.2d 511 (S.D. Tex. 2003), wire fraud requires a
scheme to defraud, use of wire communications, and specific intent to
defraud. The facts show:
92 text messages exchanged on December 14, 2023, between
Myers and Branthoover across state lines
Branthoover's deceptive call to plaintiff on December 15, 2023,
falsely offering assistance
Multiple threatening and harassing text messages from
Branthoover to plaintiff regarding the legal proceedings on June
23, 2024, December 12, 2024, and May 24, 2025
Continued communications between defendants regarding case
details across state lines throughout the proceedings
Mail Fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1341): The defendants caused fraudulent
documents to be delivered through instrumentalities of interstate
commerce with intent to defraud:
Use of the U.S. Marshal Service to deliver fraudulent divorce
documents on December 27, 2023
Use of the U.S. Marshal Service to deliver fraudulent eviction
documents on December 28, 2023
Potentially Interference with Commerce by Threats or Violence
(18 U.S.C. § 1951): The defendants' actions to unlawfully deprive
plaintiff of his residence and property rights through deception and
threats may constitute a violation of the Hobbs Act, which prohibits
obstruction, delay, or affecting commerce through extortion.
The fraudulent statements in the divorce petition, affidavit of indigency, and
protective order application satisfy the particularity requirement for fraud
claims established in Bradley v. Phillips Petroleum Co., 527 F.Supp.2d 625
(S.D. Tex. 2007). The complaint identifies specific false statements, who
made them, when and where they were made, and why they were
fraudulent.

Relationship Among Predicate Acts
As required by Allstate Ins. Co. v. Donovan, CIVIL ACTION NO. H-12-0432
(S.D. Tex. Jul 03, 2012), the predicate acts show clear relationship by
having:
Same purpose: To deprive plaintiff of his property rights and give
Myers an advantage in divorce proceedings
Same participants: Myers and Branthoover consistently coordinated
throughout
Same victim: The plaintiff was the target of all fraudulent activities
Similar methods: Interstate communications, false statements, and
manipulation of legal processes
Interrelated nature: Each act built upon previous acts in a coordinated
scheme
Continuity
The facts support both closed-ended and open-ended continuity:
Closed-ended continuity: The pattern of racketeering activity
extended from December 14, 2023, through at least May 24, 2025—
approximately 17 months. This constitutes a "substantial period of
time" as referenced in case law. The acts were not isolated but rather
part of a continuing scheme to deprive plaintiff of property rights.
Open-ended continuity: The threatening communications from
Branthoover, particularly the December 12, 2024 message stating
"When things all over you get to deal with me. Just a heads up,"
indicate a threat of continued criminal activity extending into the
future. The nature of the enterprise—focused on finalizing divorce
proceedings favorable to Myers—projects a threat of repetition until
that goal is achieved.
Conduct Requirement
Both defendants actively participated in conducting the enterprise's affairs
through the pattern of racketeering activity:
Branthoover administered the enterprise by preparing legal documents,
advising Myers, transferring funds through his PayPal account, and
attempting to control communications between plaintiff and Myers
Myers executed the enterprise's activities by filing fraudulent
documents, transferring marital funds, making false statements in
court filings, and using legal processes to deprive plaintiff of property

Injury to Business or Property
The plaintiff suffered concrete injuries to his business and property interests
as a direct result of the defendants' racketeering activity:
Financial injury through unauthorized transfer of $1,576 from joint
marital account
Business injury through disruption of home-based business advertising
Property injury through unlawful eviction from residence on January
16, 2024
Additional property injury through misrepresentations regarding
vehicle ownership and other marital assets
These injuries relate directly to the plaintiff's "business or property" as
required by 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c) and are not merely personal injuries, which
would be insufficient for RICO standing.
Application to Specific RICO Violations
Section 1962(c) Violation
Based on the analysis above, there is substantial support for a Section
1962(c) violation. The facts establish:
Persons (Myers and Branthoover) associated with
An enterprise affecting interstate commerce
Conducted the enterprise's affairs through
A pattern of racketeering activity (multiple predicate acts of wire fraud,
mail fraud, and potentially Hobbs Act violations)
Resulting in injury to plaintiff's business or property
Section 1962(d) Conspiracy
The facts also support a Section 1962(d) conspiracy claim. According to
"Insurance Fraud is a Violent Crime" (2024), RICO conspiracy requires:
Agreement to join a racketeering scheme
Knowing participation with intent to effectuate its goals
Involvement of two or more predicate acts
The defendants' coordinated actions demonstrate an agreement to conduct
the fraudulent scheme. Their communications and actions show knowledge
of the fraudulent nature of the enterprise and intent to achieve its goals.
Multiple predicate acts were committed or planned as part of the scheme.

RICO in Divorce Context
While RICO claims in divorce proceedings are challenging, this case aligns
with the criteria identified in "Racketeer influenced and corrupt
organizations" (2007) for potentially successful claims:
Plaintiff has shown injury to business and property due to the divorce
proceedings
Defendants acted as part of an enterprise to hide assets and manipulate
proceedings
Multiple violations of predicate acts have been alleged
Potential Challenges and Limitations
Specificity in Pleading
RICO claims are subject to heightened pleading standards, particularly for
predicate acts involving fraud. As noted in Bradley v. Phillips Petroleum Co.,
527 F.Supp.2d 625 (S.D. Tex. 2007), a plaintiff must "specify the statements
contended to be fraudulent, identify the speaker, state when and where the
statements were made, and explain why the statements were fraudulent."
The current complaint appears to satisfy this standard by providing specific
details about false statements, including dates, content, and why they were
fraudulent.
Proving Enterprise Distinctness
Courts generally require that the "person" and the "enterprise" be distinct.
In this case, the enterprise is an association-in-fact between Myers and
Branthoover, with each defendant being a "person" who participated in but
is distinct from the enterprise itself. This structure should satisfy the
distinctness requirement.
Continuity Challenge
Although the pattern of activity extends over 17 months, defendants might
argue this is insufficient to establish closed-ended continuity. However,
courts have found periods of similar duration sufficient, and the open-ended
continuity showing (through threats of future harm) provides an alternative
basis for establishing the pattern requirement.
Causation
To recover damages, plaintiff must show that the RICO violation was both
the "but for" and proximate cause of the injury. The complaint establishes a
direct link between the racketeering activity and plaintiff's injuries, which
should satisfy this requirement.

Conclusion
Based on the analysis of the applicable law and the facts presented, there
are sufficient grounds for viable RICO claims under both 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c)
and § 1962(d).
The facts establish the required elements for a civil RICO claim:
Persons: Myers and Branthoover
Enterprise: Association-in-fact between the defendants with a common
purpose
Pattern of racketeering activity: Multiple predicate acts of wire fraud,
mail fraud, and potentially Hobbs Act violations showing both
relationship and continuity
Conduct: Both defendants participated in conducting the enterprise's
affairs through the pattern of racketeering activity
Interstate commerce: Activities crossed state lines and used
instrumentalities of interstate commerce
Injury: Direct harm to plaintiff's business and property interests
The predicate acts are well-documented and specified with particularity,
showing deliberate fraudulent actions by both defendants using interstate
commerce facilities. The pattern of activity extends over a substantial period
(December 2023 to May 2025) and demonstrates both closed-ended and
open-ended continuity.
While RICO claims in divorce contexts face additional scrutiny, this case
presents unusually egregious conduct that goes beyond typical divorce
disputes. The defendants' coordinated scheme involved interstate travel,
communications, and financial transfers specifically designed to deprive
plaintiff of property rights through fraudulent means, which distinguishes it
from routine divorce litigation.
Based on the provided fact pattern and applicable law, the plaintiff has
established sufficient grounds for RICO violations under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c)
and § 1962(d), with multiple predicate acts supporting the pattern of
racketeering activity required for a viable RICO claim.

Summary
Elements required to establish a RICO claim based on mail and wire fraud.
These elements include a scheme to defraud, the use of mail or wire
communications to execute the scheme, and actual injury to the plaintiff's
business or property. This framework is generally applicable in U.S. Federal
courts, including the Southern District of Texas.

Extract
Despite the rigorous standard of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a plaintiff must
state a claim 'with enough clarity to enable a court or opposing party to
determine whether or not a claim is alleged.' Elliott v. Foufas, 867 F.2d 877,
880 (5th Cir.1989). Accordingly, in order to properly plead a civil RICO
claim, the plaintiff must allege facts sufficient to first establish standing
under § 1964(c), and then the elements of the § 1962 claim. See Price v.
Pinnacle Brands, Inc., 138 F.3d 602, 606 (5th Cir.1998). To establish civil
RICO standing, the plaintiff must show 1) injury to his business or property,
2) caused by the defendant's RICO violation. See id.
Summary
Requirements for pleading a civil RICO claim, which include establishing
standing under § 1964(c) and the elements of the § 1962 claim. Specifically,
the plaintiff must demonstrate an injury to business or property caused by
the defendant's RICO violation. This is a general requirement for civil RICO
claims in U.S. Federal courts.

U.S. District Court — Southern District of Texas
Extract
Under RICO, while four distinct offenses are declared to be unlawful,
common elements are present in all four offenses. ... Reduced to its three
essentials, a civil RICO claim must involve: ... Under § 1961(1)(B),
racketeering activity includes any act which is indictable under a number of

=== PAGE 16 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
federal criminal statutes, including mail fraud and wire fraud. Any act that
does not fall within the purview of RICO's definition of predicate offenses is
not an act of 'racketeering activity.' ... For mail fraud, it is necessary to show
that (1) the defendants formed a scheme or artifice to defraud; (2) the
defendants used the United States mails or caused a use of the United
States mails in furtherance of the scheme; and (3) the defendants did so
with the specific intent to deceive or defraud. ... A 'pattern of racketeering
activity' requires at least two acts of racketeering activity within a ten-year
period. ... The predicate acts must 'amount to or threaten continuing
racketeering activity.' ... It is 'continuity' that assures a federal cause of
action. ... 'It refers either to a closed period of repeated conduct, or to past
conduct that by its nature projects into the future with a threat of
repetition.'

fraud, a plaintiff must show: ... In re FirstMerit Bank, N.A., 52 S.W.3d 749,
758 (Tex.2001). Specifically with respect to mail fraud, a plaintiff must be
able to demonstrate: "(1) a scheme to defraud by means of false or
fraudulent representation, (2) interstate or intrastate use of the mails to
execute the scheme, (3) the use of the mails, by the defendant connected
with [the] scheme, and (4) actual injury to the plaintiff." Burzynski, 989 F.2d

Summary
Requirements for articulating fraud with particularity, which is essential for
a RICO claim. It specifies that a plaintiff must detail the fraudulent
statements, identify the speaker, and explain why they are fraudulent. For
mail fraud, it requires demonstrating a scheme to defraud, use of mails, and
actual injury. The passage also emphasizes the need to specify facts for each
defendant in a RICO claim, rather than lumping them together.
In re Enron Corp. Securities, Derivative & Erisa, 284 F.Supp.2d 511 (S.D.
Tex. 2003)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of Texas
Extract
The elements comprising mail and wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1341 and §
1343 are (1) the defendant's participation in a scheme to defraud, which
includes false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises; (2) the
use of the mails or wire communications to execute the scheme; and (3)
specific intent to defraud.
Summary
For a RICO claim involving mail and wire fraud, the plaintiff must
demonstrate that the defendant participated in a scheme to defraud, used
mail or wire communications to execute the scheme, and had a specific
intent to defraud. These elements are crucial in establishing a pattern of
racketeering activity under RICO.

To establish a RICO claim, a plaintiff must demonstrate three elements: (1) a
person engaged in (2) a pattern of racketeering activity, and (3) this activity
must be connected to the acquisition, establishment, conduct, or control of
an enterprise. Additionally, there must be a minimal nexus with interstate
commerce. This provides a framework for evaluating whether the actions
described in the question meet the criteria for a RICO claim.

RICO provides civil causes of action for recovery of treble damages for '[a]ny
person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section
1962 of this chapter.' 18 U.S.C. § 1964 (c). Plaintiffs have alleged that
defendants have violated §§ 1962(c) and (d). These subsections state: 18
U.S.C. §§ 1962(c) and (d). The Fifth Circuit has interpreted these subsections
to mean that 'a person who is employed by or associated with an enterprise
cannot conduct the affairs of the enterprise through a pattern of
racketeering activity[, and that] a person cannot conspire to violate
subsection[]. .. (c).' ... Defendants argue that plaintiffs' RICO claims fail as a
matter of law because plaintiffs have not sufficiently alleged that defendants
engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity and have failed to plead fraud
with particularity. 'A pattern of racketeering activity consists of two or more
predicate criminal acts that are (1) related and (2) amount to or pose a
threat of continued criminal activity.' St. Germain, 556 F.3d at 263. See also

Summary
Detailed explanation of what constitutes a RICO violation under U.S. Federal

requirements for a pattern of racketeering activity, which includes at least
two predicate acts that are related and pose a threat of continued criminal
activity. The passage also explains the concept of continuity, which can be

through a pattern of racketeering activity or through collection of an
unlawful debt to acquire or maintain, directly or indirectly, any interest in or
control of any enterprise which is engaged in, or the activities of which
affect, interstate or foreign commerce... It shall be unlawful for any person
employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities
of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate,
directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a
pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt... It shall be
unlawful for any person to conspire to violate any of the provisions of

in violation of this section shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not
more than twenty years, or both.
Summary
18 U.S.C. § 1951, also known as the Hobbs Act, addresses interference with
commerce by threats or violence, including robbery or extortion. This
statute is relevant to RICO claims as it can be one of the predicate offenses
that constitute a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO. The passage
specifically mentions that any act that obstructs, delays, or affects
commerce through robbery, extortion, or threats of violence can be
penalized under this section. This is relevant to the question as it provides a

death results shall be imprisoned for any term of years or for life.
Summary
18 U.S.C. § 1952 addresses the use of interstate or foreign commerce to
further unlawful activities, which can include racketeering. The statute
outlines penalties for those who engage in such activities, including fines
and imprisonment. This is relevant to the question of RICO violations as it
provides a legal basis for prosecuting individuals who use interstate
commerce to facilitate racketeering activities.
18 U.S.C. § 1956 18 U.S.C. § 1956 Laundering of Monetary Instruments
Extract
Whoever, knowing that the property involved in a financial transaction
represents the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity, conducts or
attempts to conduct such a financial transaction which in fact involves the
proceeds of specified unlawful activity... shall be sentenced to a fine of not
more than $500,000 or twice the value of the property involved in the
transaction, whichever is greater, or imprisonment for not more than twenty
years, or both... the term 'specified unlawful activity' means- (A) any act or
activity constituting an offense listed in section 1961 of this title...
Summary
The passage outlines the penalties for conducting financial transactions with
the proceeds of unlawful activities. It specifies that such activities must be
listed under section 1961 to qualify as "specified unlawful activity." This is
relevant to RICO claims as RICO requires a pattern of racketeering activity,
which includes acts indictable under section 1961.

Within the field of family law, civil RICO claims have been attempted in
divorce cases, but most plaintiffs have been unsuccessful. However, a claim
by a woman that her ex-husband, along with the other defendants,
participated in a fraudulent scheme to conceal the true value of his income
during the couple's divorce proceedings has twice survived motions for
summary judgment. At least one commentator believes it is possible for a
RICO action to be successfully litigated in the area of divorce if it meets the
following criteria: (i) the plaintiff must show an injury to business or
property because of the divorce proceedings; (ii) the plaintiff must show that
the defendant acted as part of an enterprise to further the act of hiding
assets to minimize divorce settlements; and (iii) there must be either
multiple violations of the same predicate act, or the commission of more
than one predicate act.
Summary
Civil RICO claims in divorce cases are challenging but possible if specific
criteria are met. These criteria include showing an injury to business or
property, demonstrating that the defendant acted as part of an enterprise to
hide assets, and proving multiple violations of predicate acts. This

RICO is not just a tool for government control over organized crime. It is
also a remedial statute for civil matters. (31) It 'authorize[s]... criminal or
civil remedies on conduct already criminal, when performed in a specified
fashion' as delineated by the statute. (32) Section 1962 provides civil
remedies for four types of conduct: (1) using income derived from a pattern
of racketeering activity (33) to acquire an interest in an enterprise; (2)
acquiring or maintaining an interest in an enterprise through a pattern of
racketeering activity; (3) conducting the affairs of an enterprise through a
pattern of racketeering activity; and (4) conspiring to commit any of these
offenses. (34) Today, Congress urges courts to construe RICO liberally from
the 'perspective of the victim, not the perpetrator.' (35) A private civil right
of action in [section] 1964 provides that '[a]ny person injured in his business
or property by reason of a violation of section 1962... may sue.' (36) Notably,
a successful plaintiff under [section] 1964 is entitled to treble damages and
the cost of the suit, including attorney fees. (37)
Summary
Types of conduct that can constitute a RICO violation under Section 1962,
which includes using income from racketeering, acquiring or maintaining an
interest in an enterprise through racketeering, conducting enterprise affairs
through racketeering, and conspiring to commit these offenses. It also
highlights that RICO is to be construed liberally from the victim's
perspective and provides for civil remedies, including treble damages and
attorney fees, for those injured by such violations.

established by proof of: (a) of an agreement to join a racketeering scheme,
(b) of the defendant's knowing engagement in the scheme with the intent
that its overall goals be effectuated, and (c) that the scheme involved, or by
agreement between any members of the conspiracy was intended to involve,
two or more predicate acts of racketeering. Predicate Acts of Extortion. The

Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy
The Brief - American Bar Association - 2024-01-01
Extract
To establish a § 1962(c) RICO claim, the following elements must be proven:
• Enterprise: A structured group of individuals associated for a common
purpose. • Pattern of racketeering activity: At least two acts of racketeering,
as specified within the statute, within 10 years. • Conduct: Directly or
indirectly conducting the enterprise’s affairs through racketeering. • Injury:
An injury to business or property due to the racketeering activity.
Summary
Necessary elements to establish a civil RICO claim under § 1962(c). These
elements include the existence of an enterprise, a pattern of racketeering
activity, conduct of the enterprise's affairs through racketeering, and an
injury to business or property due to the racketeering activity. The scenario
provided describes a series of actions that could potentially meet these
criteria, such as the formation of an enterprise between Myers and

School of Law - Galoob, Stephen R. - 2022-03-22
Extract
The inquiry here is meant to invoke the 'pattern of racketeering activity'
element of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).
The Organized Crime Control Act (1970), which includes RICO, provides that
'criminal conduct forms a pattern if it embraces criminal acts that have the
same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of
commission, or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics
and are not isolated events.' The Supreme Court characterized this
requirement as a 'relationship' element and held that the statute further

=== PAGE 33 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
requires a 'continuity' element, 'referring either to a closed period of
repeated conduct, or to past conduct that by its nature projects into the
future with a threat of repetition.'
Summary
The passage provides insight into the requirements for establishing a RICO
claim, specifically the need for a "pattern of racketeering activity." This
pattern must include criminal acts that are related by purpose, result,
participants, victims, or methods, and must not be isolated events.
Additionally, there must be a "continuity" element, which can be shown
through repeated conduct over a closed period or conduct that suggests a
threat of future repetition.
Santos v. Delta Airlines, Inc.
USDOL Administrative Review Board Decisions
Extract
RICO, 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), prohibits 'any person employed by or associated
with any enterprise engaged in ... interstate or foreign commerce, to
conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such
enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.' The statute
thus requires the plaintiff to allege an enterprise, the conduct of the affairs
of the enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity, and injury to
[its] business or property ... caused by the violation of Section 1962.
Summary
For a RICO claim under U.S. Federal law, the plaintiff must allege: (1) an
enterprise, (2) the conduct of the affairs of the enterprise through a pattern
of racketeering activity, and (3) injury to business or property caused by the
violation of Section 1962. The passage provides the legal framework
necessary to evaluate whether the actions described in the question meet
the criteria for a RICO claim.
RICO: A Primer
Extract
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) was
enacted in 1970. Although RICO provides for both civil remedies and
criminal penalties, the number of civil RICO claims far outstrips the number
of criminal RICO cases brought each year. RICO provides for a civil action
against persons engaged in a 'pattern of racketeering activity' or 'collection
of an unlawful debt.' A successful plaintiff may recover treble damages,
costs, and attorneys' fees. RICO is, however, an intricate, complex statutory

=== PAGE 34 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
regime with numerous potential pitfalls. Yet a civil RICO claim involves
several standard, key issues. We address several of those fundamental issues
below. What is 'Racketeering activity'? The heart of a RICO case is the
existence of a pattern of racketeering activity. Under the statute,
'racketeering activity' includes a host of offenses. Section 1961 defines the
phrase to include any crime listed in subdivisions A, B, C, D, E, F, or G of
section 1961. Notably, there must be some nexus to interstate or foreign
commerce-it is a jurisdictional element of a civil RICO claim. Thus, predicate
acts will often occur in several States. Who is a RICO 'Person'? A RICO
person 'includes any individual or entity capable of holding a legal or
beneficial interest in property.' This definition defines those who can be
charged under RICO. While the definition clearly includes a natural person,
as well as a corporation, union, partnership and a sole proprietorship, it is
not settled whether the definition encompasses a governmental entity. What
is a RICO Enterprise? A plaintiff is required to demonstrate that the
defendant conducted the affairs of an enterprise though a pattern of
racketeering activity. The person and the enterprise generally must be
distinct; but, of course, a Rico person can be a part of an enterprise. A RICO
enterprise includes 'any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or
other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals associated in fact
although not a legal entity.' Courts have interpreted 'enterprise' broadly, and
the definition captures both legitimate and illegitimate enterprises. The
statutory list is not exhaustive but merely illustrative. What is A RICO
'Pattern'? A 'pattern' may exist where any combination of two or more
offenses occurred within a period of time. In Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co.,
473 U.S. 479, the Supreme Court held that the RICO pattern element
requires more than merely proving two predicate acts of racketeering.
Rather, proof of 'continuity plus relationship' is necessary. Nonetheless, the
Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized that Congress had a fairly flexible
concept of a pattern in mind. There are four separate and distinct RICO
violations set out in section 1962: (a) acquiring or operating an enterprise
using racketeering proceeds; (b) controlling an enterprise using
racketeering activities; (c) conducting the affairs of an enterprise using
racketeering activities; and (d) conspiring to so acquire, control, or conduct.
Each of the subsections incorporates the basic elements of 'enterprise' and a
'pattern of racketeering activity.' Section 1962(a) Under Section 1962(a), it
is violation to invest the proceeds of racketeering activity in an enterprise
that affects interstate commerce. Section 1962(b) is the least used of the
four RICO subsections. Under section 1962(b), it is a violation to acquire or
maintain an interest in an enterprise affecting interstate or foreign
commerce through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of an
unlawful debt. To prove a violation of Section 1962(b), a plaintiff must prove
the following elements: * Existence of an enterprise; * The enterprise
engaged in, or its activities affected, interstate or foreign commerce; * The
defendant acquired or maintained, directly or indirectly, an interest in or
control of the enterprise; and * The defendant acquired or maintained the
interest through a pattern of racketeering activity or through collection of
an unlawful debt. Courts have held that a plaintiff must allege a specific
nexus between control of the named enterprise and the alleged racketeering
activity. Section 1962(c) Under Section 1962(d), it is a violation to conspire
to commit any of the three substantive RICO offenses. To prove a violation of
Section 1962(d), a plaintiff must prove the following elements: * The

=== PAGE 35 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
existence of an enterprise (or that an enterprise would exist); * That the
enterprise was (or would be) engaged in, or its activities affected (or would
affect), interstate or foreign commerce; and * That each defendant
knowingly agreed that a conspirator would commit a violation of 18 U.S.C. '
1962(c). The Supreme Court held that to establish a RICO conspiracy
offense under Section 1962(d), there is no requirement that the defendant
'himself committed or agreed to commit the two predicate acts requisite for
a substantive RICO offense under ' 1962(c).' The Supreme Court explained:
Summary
Detailed explanation of the elements required to establish a RICO claim
under U.S. Federal law. It outlines the necessity of proving a "pattern of
racketeering activity," the existence of an "enterprise," and the impact on
interstate or foreign commerce. It also explains the different sections of
RICO violations, including acquiring, controlling, conducting, or conspiring
to conduct an enterprise through racketeering activities. The passage

though a pattern of racketeering activity. The person and the enterprise
generally must be distinct; but, of course, a Rico person can be a part of an
enterprise. ... A 'pattern' may exist where any combination of two or more
offenses occurred within a period of time. ... A plaintiff may demonstrate a
pattern by establishment that the predicate acts pose a threat of continued
criminal activity, which is generally demonstrated by showing either: *
Closed-ended continuity. Proving 'a series of related predicate acts
extending over a substantial period of time.' * Open-ended continuity. A
threat of 'continuing criminal activity extending indefinitely into the future,'
in light of the nature of the enterprise and predicate acts alleged. ... There
are four separate and distinct RICO violations set out in section 1962: (a)
acquiring or operating an enterprise using racketeering proceeds; (b)
controlling an enterprise using racketeering activities; (c) conducting the
affairs of an enterprise using racketeering activities; and (d) conspiring to so
acquire, control, or conduct.

Extract
RICO is not a simple statute. It pertains to conduct associated with an
'enterprise' and 'a pattern racketeering activity.' An enterprise is an
individual or legal entity, or a union or group of individuals associated in fact
although not a legal entity, while a pattern of racketeering activity requires
long-term, organized conduct to violate state and federal laws. There are
four types of activities outlawed by RICO, and claims under Section 1962(c)
are the most commonly asserted: * Section 1962(a) prohibits a person from
investing in an enterprise any income derived from a pattern of racketeering
activity; * Section 1962(b) prohibits a person from using a pattern of
racketeering activity to acquire or maintain control over an enterprise; *
Section 1962(c) prohibits a person from conducting the affairs of an
enterprise through a pattern of racketeering; and * Section 1962(d)
prohibits a person from conspiring to violate Sections 1962(a), (b), or (c).
