Question
The associate judge did not consider the merits of the emergency TRO or
make any findings on the record, but instead deferred action based on a
procedural development (anticipated consolidation motion). Judges are
required to exercise their discretion and consider requests for emergency
relief when properly presented, especially where irreparable harm is
alleged. Arbitrarily refusing to hear such requests may constitute an abuse
of discretion and a denial of due process (see, e.g., In re L.R., 324 S.W.3d
231, 235 (Tex. App.—Waco 2010, no pet.)). By failing to exercise judicial
discretion and refusing to consider the emergency TRO, the associate judge
denied the litigant due process of law.
Answer (Texas)
Short response
An associate judge who declines to consider the merits of an emergency
temporary restraining order (TRO) and makes no findings on the record,
instead deferring action solely due to a procedural development, fails to
exercise the judicial discretion required by Texas law. Such inaction may
constitute an abuse of discretion and a denial of due process, particularly
where irreparable harm is alleged and emergency relief is properly
requested.
Summary
Texas statutes and case law make clear that associate judges are
empowered and expected to exercise discretion on requests for emergency
relief, such as TROs, when those requests are properly presented. When an
associate judge refuses to consider the merits of an emergency TRO and
fails to make findings, instead deferring action for procedural reasons, this
conduct is inconsistent with statutory duties and established appellate
guidance, and may amount to an abuse of discretion and a violation of due
process.
The legislative framework grants associate judges the authority and
responsibility to conduct hearings, hear evidence, make findings, and issue
temporary orders, including emergency relief. Appellate case law further
underscores that courts must make specific findings and exercise discretion
when emergency injunctive relief is sought, and that failure to do so—
especially where irreparable harm is alleged—can be grounds for reversal or
mandamus. Deferring action without considering the merits of the request
undermines the statutory and constitutional protections afforded to litigants.

Background and Relevant Law
Legislative Framework
The Texas Family Code and Government Code set out the powers and duties
of associate judges in family law and related proceedings. Under Texas
Family Code section 201.007, associate judges are authorized to conduct
hearings, hear evidence, make findings of fact, formulate conclusions of law,
recommend orders, and render and sign temporary orders, including those
for emergency relief, unless limited by an order of referral. The statute also
empowers associate judges to take any action necessary and proper for the
efficient performance of their duties, which includes acting on requests for
emergency relief when presented. This statutory scheme presumes that
associate judges will exercise their discretion and act on such matters,
rather than deferring or declining to consider them without good cause (Tex.
Fam. Code § 201.007).
Similarly, Texas Government Code section 54A.209 grants associate judges
the authority to conduct hearings, hear evidence, make findings, rule on
pretrial motions, and render and sign temporary orders, again subject only
to the limitations of the order of referral. The statute specifically
contemplates that associate judges will rule on pretrial motions and issue
temporary orders, which includes emergency TROs (Tex. Gov't. Code § 54A.
209).
Texas Family Code section 105.001 further authorizes courts to issue a wide
range of temporary orders—including TROs and temporary injunctions—to
protect the safety and welfare of children in suits affecting the parent-child
relationship (SAPCRs). The statute restricts postponement of hearings on
temporary orders and facilitates prompt issuance of TROs by dispensing
with the need for affidavits or verified pleadings in certain circumstances.
The legislative intent is to ensure that requests for emergency relief are
considered and acted upon expeditiously, not delayed for procedural reasons
(Tex. Fam. Code § 105.001).
Case Law
Texas appellate courts have consistently held that when emergency
injunctive relief is sought, the trial court must exercise its discretion and
make specific findings on the record identifying the injury and explaining
why it is irreparable. The requirements for issuing a TRO or temporary
injunction are mandatory and must be strictly followed; substantial
compliance is insufficient. A trial court abuses its discretion when it fails to
comply with these requirements or issues a void order (In re Children's Med.
Ctr. of Dall., 05-22-00459-CV (Tex. App. May 18, 2022)).
The appellate guidance is clear that the court must consider the merits of
the emergency request, make findings, and articulate the reasons for
granting or denying relief. Failure to do so—such as by deferring action
without considering the request—constitutes a failure to exercise judicial
discretion and may be grounds for reversal or mandamus. This principle is

particularly important where the applicant alleges imminent and irreparable
harm, as the right to be heard and to have the court exercise its discretion is
a fundamental aspect of due process.
Analysis
Statutory Duties of Associate Judges
The legislative framework governing associate judges in Texas family law
and related proceedings is unambiguous: associate judges are empowered
and expected to conduct hearings, hear evidence, make findings, and issue
temporary orders, including emergency relief. Both the Family Code and
Government Code enumerate these powers and duties, and neither statute
contemplates that an associate judge may simply defer action on a properly
presented emergency request for relief without considering its merits.
Section 201.007 of the Family Code and section 54A.209 of the Government
Code both provide that associate judges may conduct hearings, hear
evidence, make findings of fact, rule on pretrial motions, and render and
sign temporary orders. These provisions are not merely permissive; they
reflect a legislative expectation that associate judges will exercise their
discretion and act on matters within their authority, particularly where
emergency relief is sought and irreparable harm is alleged (Tex. Fam. Code §
201.007; Tex. Gov't. Code § 54A.209).
Section 105.001 of the Family Code further reinforces this expectation by
authorizing courts to issue temporary orders—including TROs and
temporary injunctions—for the safety and welfare of children. The statute
restricts the ability of courts to postpone hearings on temporary orders and
facilitates prompt action on emergency requests. The legislative intent is
clear: courts must act promptly and exercise their discretion when
emergency relief is requested, not defer action for procedural reasons (Tex.
Fam. Code § 105.001).
Judicial Discretion and Due Process
Texas appellate case law underscores the importance of judicial discretion
and due process in the context of emergency relief. When a party seeks a
TRO or temporary injunction, the court is required to consider the request,
make specific findings on the record, and articulate the reasons for granting
or denying relief. These requirements are mandatory and must be strictly
followed; failure to do so constitutes an abuse of discretion (In re Children's
Med. Ctr. of Dall., 05-22-00459-CV (Tex. App. May 18, 2022)).
The appellate court in In re Children's Med. Ctr. of Dall. emphasized that the
trial court must set out in the order the reasons it deems it proper to issue
the injunction, including the reasons why the applicant will suffer injury if
relief is not granted. The court further held that the requirements for
issuing a TRO or temporary injunction are mandatory and must be strictly
followed; substantial or effective compliance is insufficient. A trial court

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
abuses its discretion when it fails to comply with these requirements or
issues a void order.
This appellate guidance is directly relevant to the scenario presented. When
an associate judge declines to consider the merits of an emergency TRO and
makes no findings on the record, instead deferring action for procedural
reasons (such as an anticipated consolidation motion), the judge fails to
exercise the discretion required by law. This conduct is inconsistent with
both the statutory duties of associate judges and the due process rights of
litigants.
Abuse of Discretion and Denial of Due Process
The failure to consider the merits of an emergency TRO and to make
findings on the record is not a mere procedural irregularity; it is a
substantive failure to exercise judicial discretion. Texas law is clear that
when a request for emergency relief is properly presented and irreparable
harm is alleged, the court must consider the request and make findings.
Arbitrarily refusing to hear such requests, or deferring action without
considering the merits, constitutes an abuse of discretion and may amount
to a denial of due process.
The statutory framework and appellate case law both support the
proposition that courts—and by extension, associate judges—must act on
emergency requests for relief and cannot simply defer action for procedural
reasons. The right to be heard and to have the court exercise its discretion
is a fundamental aspect of due process, particularly where the applicant
alleges imminent and irreparable harm.
Application to the Scenario
In the scenario presented, the associate judge did not consider the merits of
the emergency TRO, made no findings on the record, and instead deferred
action based on an anticipated consolidation motion. This conduct is
inconsistent with the statutory duties of associate judges under the Family
Code and Government Code, which require the exercise of discretion on
requests for emergency relief. It is also inconsistent with appellate
guidance, which mandates that courts make specific findings and articulate
the reasons for granting or denying emergency relief.
By failing to consider the merits of the emergency TRO and to make findings
on the record, the associate judge failed to exercise the discretion required
by law. This failure constitutes an abuse of discretion and may amount to a
denial of due process, particularly where the applicant alleges imminent and
irreparable harm.
Exceptions and Caveats
There are limited circumstances in which an associate judge may be justified
in deferring action on a request for emergency relief. For example, if the
order of referral specifically limits the associate judge's authority to act on

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
certain matters, or if there are jurisdictional or procedural defects in the
request, the associate judge may be justified in declining to act. However,
absent such limitations, the statutory framework and appellate guidance
require the associate judge to consider the merits of the request and to
make findings on the record.
It is also important to note that the right to a de novo hearing before the
referring court does not relieve the associate judge of the duty to exercise
discretion and act on emergency requests for relief. The statutory scheme
contemplates that associate judges will act on such matters, subject to the
right of de novo review, not that they will defer action and leave the matter
unresolved.
Conclusion
Texas law requires associate judges to exercise their discretion and act on
requests for emergency relief, such as TROs, when those requests are
properly presented and irreparable harm is alleged. The statutory
framework grants associate judges the authority and responsibility to
conduct hearings, hear evidence, make findings, and issue temporary
orders, and appellate case law mandates that courts make specific findings
and articulate the reasons for granting or denying emergency relief. When
an associate judge declines to consider the merits of an emergency TRO and
makes no findings on the record, instead deferring action for procedural
reasons, this conduct constitutes a failure to exercise judicial discretion and
may amount to an abuse of discretion and a denial of due process. The right
to be heard and to have the court exercise its discretion is a fundamental
aspect of due process, and courts must act promptly and decisively on
requests for emergency relief.

2022)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 683 states that a temporary restraining order
'shall set forth the reasons for its issuance' and 'shall be specific in its
terms.' ... 'A trial court's order stating its reasons for granting a temporary
injunction must be specific and legally sufficient on its face and not merely
conclusory. To comply with rule 683, a trial court must set out in the
temporary injunction order the reasons the court deems it proper to issue
the injunction, including the reasons why the applicant will suffer injury if
the injunctive relief is not granted.' ... 'The requirements of rule of civil
procedure 683 are mandatory and must be strictly followed' and that
substantial or effective compliance is insufficient. ... 'Under Texas law, one of
the requirements for obtaining a temporary restraining order is that the

applicant prove that he or she faces "imminent" and "irreparable" harm ...
[the order] must specifically identify what the alleged harm is [and] the
reasons why that alleged harm is "irreparable."' ... 'A trial court abuses its
discretion when it issues a void order.'
Summary
The case emphasizes that when emergency injunctive relief is sought, the
court must exercise discretion and make specific findings identifying the
injury and why it is irreparable; Rule 683’s requirements are mandatory and
must appear in the order itself. The opinion also ties noncompliance to
abuse of discretion and mandamus. This supports the proposition that a
judge must consider and articulate the merits of an emergency TRO request;
failure to do so (e.g., deferring without findings) is an abuse of discretion
and raises due process concerns.

Summary
• The statute affirmatively grants associate judges authority to conduct
hearings, hear evidence, make findings, rule on pretrial motions, regulate
proceedings, and render temporary orders. • When an emergency TRO or
request for temporary relief is properly presented, these provisions show the
associate judge has both the power and duty to exercise judicial discretion
on such matters unless limited by the referral order. • Deferring action
without considering the merits, findings, or ruling—particularly on
emergency relief—suggests a failure to exercise the granted discretion and
functions (hearing, evidence, findings, rulings, temporary orders),
supporting an argument that the refusal to consider the request was an
abdication of statutory authority and consistent with abuse-of-discretion/
due-process concerns.

Summary
Section 201.007 enumerates the powers and duties of associate judges,
including conducting hearings, hearing evidence, making findings of fact
and conclusions of law, regulating proceedings, and rendering and signing
temporary orders. These provisions reflect that associate judges are
expected to exercise judicial discretion on matters presented, including
requests for temporary relief, rather than deferring action without
consideration. The authority to "render and sign" temporary orders and to
"take action as necessary and proper" supports the argument that when an
emergency TRO is properly presented and irreparable harm is alleged, an
associate judge should entertain the request, hear evidence as necessary,
and make findings or otherwise act, rather than delaying solely due to
anticipated procedural developments.
Tex. Fam. Code § 105.001 Tex. Fam. Code § 105.001 Temporary Orders
Before Final Order
Extract
In a suit, the court may make a temporary order, including the modification
of a prior temporary order, for the safety and welfare of the child, including
an order: for the temporary conservatorship of the child; for the temporary
support of the child; restraining a party from disturbing the peace of the
child or another party; prohibiting a person from removing the child beyond
a geographical area identified by the court; or for payment of reasonable
and necessary attorney's fees, court costs, and expenses. (a-1) If the court
on its own motion refers to mediation a suit in which an initial hearing
regarding the rendition of a temporary order described by Subsection (a)
has not yet occurred, the court may not postpone the hearing to a date that
is later than the 30th day after the date set for the hearing. (b) Except as
provided by Subsection (c), temporary restraining orders and temporary
injunctions under this section shall be granted without the necessity of an
affidavit or verified pleading... Except as provided by Subsection (h), an
order may not be rendered under Subsection (a) ... except after notice and a
hearing.

Summary
Section 105.001 authorizes courts to issue a broad range of temporary
orders—including restraining orders—in SAPCRs to protect a child’s safety
and welfare. Subsection (a-1) restricts postponements when the court itself
diverts a case to mediation, evidencing a legislative expectation that
temporary-order hearings proceed without undue delay. Subsection (b)
facilitates prompt issuance of TROs/injunctions by dispensing with typical
affidavit requirements and contemplates prompt notice-and-hearing practice
for other temporary orders. Together, these provisions reflect a statutory
framework requiring courts to timely exercise discretion on emergency
temporary relief for child safety/welfare rather than deferring action for
procedural developments. This supports the argument that refusing to
consider an emergency TRO—without reaching the merits—fails to exercise
the discretion the statute presumes and can amount to abuse of discretion
and due process concerns in line with In re L.R.
Section 54A.209. Powers of Associate Judge
Extract
Except as limited by an order of referral, an associate judge may: conduct a
hearing; hear evidence; ... make findings of fact on evidence; formulate
conclusions of law; rule on pretrial motions; ... without prejudice to the right
to a de novo hearing under Section 54A.216, render and sign: ... (C) a
temporary order; ... and sign a final order that includes a waiver of the right
to a de novo hearing in accordance with Section 54A.216.
Summary
Section 54A.209 enumerates the powers of associate judges to conduct
hearings, take evidence, make findings, rule on pretrial motions, and issue
temporary orders. An emergency TRO request is a pretrial request for
temporary relief. These provisions confirm that, unless limited by the order
of referral, an associate judge is empowered—and thus expected—to
exercise judicial discretion by hearing and deciding such emergency
matters, making findings, and issuing temporary orders. Deferring action
without considering the request’s merits, when empowered to act, suggests
a failure to exercise discretion.
