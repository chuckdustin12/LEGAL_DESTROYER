Question
The mother transferred $1,576 from the marital bank account using
deceptive means, including PayPal, to conceal her actions. She used the
funds to purchase a second phone, which was used to prepare divorce
pleadings. The stepfather and grandparents assisted in serving an eviction
notice based on filings that had not yet been submitted to the court. A
"pattern of racketeering activity" requires at least two predicate acts of
racketeering, such as wire fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343) or obstruction of justice
(18 U.S.C. § 1503), that are related and amount to or pose a threat of
continued criminal activity. (18 U.S.C. § 1961(5)). The alleged acts of wire
fraud (e.g., transferring funds via PayPal under deceptive means) and
obstruction of justice (e.g., influencing grandparents to serve an eviction
based on unfiled pleadings) could constitute a pattern of racketeering
activity under RICO.
Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
Based on the provided facts and legal authorities, the alleged actions could
potentially constitute a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO, though
significant challenges exist in meeting all required elements. The deceptive
PayPal transfer could qualify as wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343, and the
service of an eviction notice based on unfiled pleadings might constitute
obstruction of justice, but establishing the required relatedness, continuity,
and enterprise elements would present substantial hurdles.
Summary
The alleged facts present a scenario where RICO violations might be
considered based on two potential predicate acts: wire fraud (through the
deceptive transfer of marital funds via PayPal) and obstruction of justice
(through serving an eviction notice based on unfiled court pleadings). These
acts, if proven, could satisfy the minimum requirement of two predicate acts
within ten years. However, establishing a RICO violation requires more than
just proving two predicate acts.
To constitute a "pattern of racketeering activity" under RICO, the predicate
acts must be related and demonstrate continuity or pose a threat of
continued criminal activity. Additionally, RICO requires proof of an
"enterprise" and a relationship between the pattern of racketeering activity
and that enterprise. The domestic context of these actions, their limited
scope, and the apparent absence of a formal enterprise structure present
significant challenges to establishing a successful RICO claim based on the
alleged facts.

Background and Relevant Law
Relevant Statutes
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) provides
both criminal and civil remedies against persons who engage in certain
prohibited activities. The key statutory provisions relevant to this analysis
include:
18 U.S.C. § 1962 - Prohibited Activities
Under 18 U.S.C. § 1962, RICO prohibits certain activities involving a pattern
of racketeering:
18 U.S.C. § 1962 Prohibited Activities, 18 U.S.C. § 1962 ("It shall be unlawful
for any person through a pattern of racketeering activity or through
collection of an unlawful debt to acquire or maintain, directly or indirectly,
any interest in or control of any enterprise which is engaged in, or the
activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce.").
18 U.S.C. § 1961 - Definitions
The definition of "racketeering activity" and "pattern of racketeering
activity" are crucial to understanding RICO's scope:
18 U.S.C. § 1961 Definitions, 18 U.S.C. § 1961 ("'racketeering activity'
means... (B) any act which is indictable under any of the following provisions
of title 18, United States Code: ... section 1343 (relating to wire fraud), ...
section 1503 (relating to obstruction of justice), ... 'pattern of racketeering
activity' requires at least two acts of racketeering activity, one of which
occurred after the effective date of this chapter and the last of which
occurred within ten years (excluding any period of imprisonment) after the
commission of a prior act of racketeering activity").
18 U.S.C. § 1343 - Wire Fraud
Wire fraud, one of the potential predicate acts in this case, is defined as:
18 U.S.C. § 1343 Fraud By Wire, Radio, Or Television, 18 U.S.C. § 1343
("Whoever, having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to
defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent
pretenses, representations, or promises, transmits or causes to be
transmitted by means of wire, radio, or television communication in
interstate or foreign commerce, any writings, signs, signals, pictures, or
sounds for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice, shall be fined
under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both.").

Judicial Interpretation of RICO Requirements
Elements of a RICO Violation
Courts have consistently held that a RICO claim requires proving four
essential elements:
Tashjian v. Deutsche Bank, CIVIL ACTION NO. 19-cv-40074-DHH (D. Mass.
Feb 23, 2021) ("To plead a civil RICO action, a plaintiff must plead specific,
non-conclusory, facts which, if accepted as true, show the existence of four
elements: '(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of
racketeering activity.'").
United HealthCare Corp. v. American Trade Ins. Co., Ltd., 88 F.3d 563 (8th
Cir. 1996) ("In order to demonstrate a violation of this section, therefore, a
plaintiff must establish (1) the existence of an enterprise; (2) defendant's
association with the enterprise; (3) defendant's participation in predicate
acts of racketeering; and (4) defendant's actions constitute a pattern of
racketeering activity.").
These four elements are equally essential, as noted in secondary materials:
Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy ("A violation of § 1962(c), the section on which
Sedima relies, requires (1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern
(4) of racketeering activity. The plaintiff must allege each of the elements to
state a claim. They are all equally essential components, and the complaint
will fail if any one of them is not adequately pleaded.").
Pattern of Racketeering Activity
The Supreme Court has provided important guidance on what constitutes a
"pattern of racketeering activity":
Inc v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Company, 492 U.S. 229, 109 S.Ct. 2893,
106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989) ("RICO's legislative history, however, establishes
that Congress intended that to prove a 'pattern of racketeering activity' a
plaintiff or prosecutor must show both 'relationship' and 'continuity'—that
the racketeering predicates are related, and that they either constitute or
threaten long-term criminal activity.").
This requirement for both relationship and continuity has been consistently
followed by lower courts:
Heinrich v. Waiting Angels Adoption Servs., Inc., 668 F.3d 393 (6th Cir.
2012) ("In order to show a 'pattern' of racketeering activity, a plaintiff must
show 'that the racketeering predicates are related, and that they amount to
or pose a threat of continued criminal activity.'").
Advanced Optics Electronics, Inc. v. Robins, 633 F.Supp.2d 1237 (D. N.M.
2008) ("To show a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO requires
showing that four separate elements have been met: (i) there must be at
least two acts that would qualify as racketeering activity; (ii) the acts must

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
have occurred within ten years of each other; (iii) the acts must be related to
each other or part of a common scheme; and (iv) the acts must pose a threat
of ongoing or expanding criminal activity.").
Relatedness Requirement
Courts have elaborated on what makes predicate acts "related" for RICO
purposes:
Heden v. Hill, 937 F.Supp. 1230 (S.D. Tex. 1996) ("Predicate acts are related
if they 'have the same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or
methods of commission, or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing
characteristics and are not isolated events.'").
Continuity Requirement
Continuity is a critical element of the "pattern" requirement, as explained by
the Eighth Circuit:
Wisdom v. First Midwest Bank, of Poplar Bluff, 167 F.3d 402 (8th Cir. 1999)
("However, a mere allegation of two or more acts is insufficient to state a
RICO claim; the predicate acts must be related and must 'amount to or pose
a threat of continued criminal activity.'").
Enterprise Requirement
The Supreme Court has clarified what constitutes an "enterprise" under
RICO:
United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 101 S.Ct. 2524, 69 L.Ed.2d 246
(1981) ("The enterprise is an entity, for present purposes a group of persons
associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a course of
conduct... The former is proved by evidence of an ongoing organization,
formal or informal, and by evidence that the various associates function as a
continuing unit.").
It should be noted that the Turkette case was abrogated by United States v.
Lane, 474 U.S. 438 (1986), though this abrogation focused on issues of
joinder and severance rather than the definition of "enterprise" that remains
valid.
Wire Fraud as a Predicate Act
Courts have outlined the elements of wire fraud as a predicate act:
U.S. v. International Longshoremen's Ass'n, 518 F.Supp.2d 422 (E.D. N.Y.
2007) ("The essential elements of a mail [or wire] fraud violation are (1) a
scheme to defraud, (2) money or property [as the object of the scheme], and
(3) use of the mails [or wires] to further the scheme.").

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
United HealthCare Corp. v. American Trade Ins. Co., Ltd., 88 F.3d 563 (8th
Cir. 1996) ("We have held that even a routine mailing (or wire use), or one
sent for a legitimate business purpose may satisfy the 'actual use'
requirement 'so long as it assists ... in carrying out the fraud.'").
Obstruction of Justice as a Predicate Act
Courts have discussed obstruction of justice as a predicate act under RICO:
Chevron Corp. v. Donziger, 974 F. Supp. 2d 362 (S.D. N.Y. 2014) ("Section
1503 requires also proof of 'a connection between the defendant's
intentional acts and the likelihood of potentially affecting the administration
of justice.' That is, 'the act must have a relationship in time, causation, or
logic with the judicial proceedings.' Obstruction of justice is a predicate act
under RICO in cases where, as here, a defendant's efforts were 'designed to
prevent detection and prosecution of the organization's illegal activities
[and] were part of a consistent pattern that was likely to continue for the
indefinite future, absent outside intervention.'").
Analysis
Wire Fraud Analysis
Based on the provided facts, the mother's actions in transferring $1,576
from the marital bank account via PayPal using deceptive means could
potentially constitute wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343.
To establish wire fraud as a predicate act, three elements must be proven:
A scheme to defraud
Money or property as the object of the scheme
Use of wire communications to further the scheme
U.S. v. International Longshoremen's Ass'n, 518 F.Supp.2d 422 (E.D. N.Y.
2007).
The stated facts suggest that the mother may have devised a scheme to
defraud by using "deceptive means" to conceal her actions when
transferring the funds. The object of this scheme was money—specifically,
$1,576 from the marital bank account. The use of PayPal would satisfy the
third element requiring wire communications, as PayPal transactions
typically involve interstate electronic communications.
The critical aspect would be proving the "deceptive means" used by the
mother and establishing that she had the requisite intent to defraud. The
mere fact that she concealed her actions does not automatically constitute
fraud. However, if she misrepresented the purpose of the transfers or used
deceptive methods to hide the transactions, this could potentially satisfy the
elements of wire fraud.

Obstruction of Justice Analysis
The second potential predicate act involves the service of an eviction notice
based on court filings that had not yet been submitted. This could potentially
constitute obstruction of justice under 18 U.S.C. § 1503, which is listed as a
racketeering activity in 18 U.S.C. § 1961.
For obstruction of justice to serve as a predicate act, there must be:
An intentional act
A connection between that act and the likelihood of affecting the
administration of justice
A relationship with judicial proceedings
Chevron Corp. v. Donziger, 974 F. Supp. 2d 362 (S.D. N.Y. 2014).
The factual scenario indicates that the stepfather and grandparents served
an eviction notice based on filings that had not yet been submitted to the
court. This raises questions about whether this action was intended to
obstruct justice by misrepresenting the status of pending legal proceedings.
However, several issues complicate this analysis:
Serving an eviction notice based on unfiled pleadings may be improper
but may not rise to the level of obstruction of justice without further
facts showing an intent to interfere with the administration of justice.
The connection to "judicial proceedings" is tenuous if the pleadings had
not yet been filed, as no judicial proceedings were technically
underway.
The facts do not clearly establish that these actions were "designed to
prevent detection and prosecution" of illegal activities, which is a factor
courts have considered in finding obstruction of justice as a RICO
predicate.
Pattern of Racketeering Analysis
Assuming arguendo that both predicate acts could be established, the next
question is whether they constitute a "pattern of racketeering activity"
under RICO.
Two Predicate Acts Within Ten Years
The facts suggest that both alleged acts (wire fraud and obstruction of
justice) occurred close in time as part of the same domestic dispute. This
would satisfy the basic statutory requirement of "at least two acts of
racketeering activity" occurring within ten years of each other as defined in 
18 U.S.C. § 1961(5).
Relatedness Requirement
For predicate acts to be related, they must "have the same or similar
purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of commission, or
1. 
2. 
3. 
1. 
2. 
3. 

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not
isolated events." Heden v. Hill, 937 F.Supp. 1230 (S.D. Tex. 1996).
The alleged predicate acts appear to be related in that:
They share a common purpose (facilitating the mother's divorce
proceedings)
They involve some of the same participants (the mother is involved in
both)
They target the same victim (the mother's spouse)
They are temporally connected as part of the same domestic dispute
However, the methods of commission differ substantially between the
financial deception (wire fraud) and the service of improper eviction papers
(potential obstruction of justice).
Continuity Requirement
The continuity requirement presents a significant challenge for establishing
a RICO pattern in this scenario. Courts have consistently held that "a mere
allegation of two or more acts is insufficient to state a RICO claim; the
predicate acts must be related and must 'amount to or pose a threat of
continued criminal activity.'" Wisdom v. First Midwest Bank, of Poplar Bluff,
167 F.3d 402 (8th Cir. 1999).
The facts as presented suggest isolated incidents related to a single
domestic dispute rather than "continued criminal activity" or a threat
thereof. Courts have been reluctant to find RICO violations in cases
involving a narrow purpose with a natural endpoint, such as a divorce
proceeding, as opposed to open-ended criminal schemes.
As explained in Nutrition Distribution LLC v. Custom Nutraceuticals LLC,
194 F.Supp.3d 952 (D. Ariz. 2016), the predicate acts must "amount to or
pose a threat of continued criminal activity." The limited scope and finite
nature of the alleged activities—tied specifically to initiating divorce
proceedings—may fail to demonstrate the continuity required for a RICO
pattern.
Enterprise Requirement
A critical element of any RICO violation is the existence of an "enterprise."
As defined by the Supreme Court:
United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 101 S.Ct. 2524, 69 L.Ed.2d 246
(1981) ("The enterprise is an entity, for present purposes a group of persons
associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a course of
conduct. The former is proved by evidence of an ongoing organization,
formal or informal, and by evidence that the various associates function as a
continuing unit.").
The facts suggest that the mother, stepfather, and grandparents acted
together in at least the eviction notice aspect of the scenario. This could
• 
• 
• 
• 

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
potentially constitute an informal association. However, several factors
weigh against finding an enterprise in this context:
The association appears to be temporary and limited to assisting with
specific divorce-related activities rather than an "ongoing
organization."
There is no indication that these individuals "function as a continuing
unit" beyond this specific situation.
The family relationship context suggests personal assistance rather
than a structured enterprise engaged in racketeering as contemplated
by RICO.
As explained in Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy, an enterprise requires "A
structured group of individuals associated for a common purpose." The loose
family association described in the facts may not satisfy this requirement.
Interstate Commerce Requirement
RICO applies to enterprises "engaged in, or the activities of which affect,
interstate or foreign commerce." 18 U.S.C. § 1962 Prohibited Activities, 18
U.S.C. § 1962. The only potential connection to interstate commerce in the
facts presented is the use of PayPal, which typically operates across state
lines. While this might suffice for the wire fraud predicate specifically, it's
questionable whether the overall activities of the alleged "enterprise"
substantially affect interstate commerce as required by RICO.
Exceptions and Caveats
Limited Scope of Alleged Activities
Courts have been careful to distinguish between ordinary civil or domestic
disputes and the kind of systematic racketeering activities that RICO was
designed to address. As noted in U.S. v. Pelullo, 964 F.2d 193 (3rd Cir. 1992),
for RICO to apply, the acts must be "connected with the other by some
common scheme, plan or motive so as to constitute a pattern."
While the alleged activities in this scenario may be improper or potentially
illegal, they appear to be limited in scope and directed toward a single
purpose (facilitating divorce proceedings) rather than constituting the kind
of ongoing criminal enterprise that RICO targets.
Distinction Between Criminal Acts and RICO Violations
It's important to note that even if the individual acts might constitute
criminal violations (such as wire fraud or obstruction of justice), this does
not automatically establish a RICO violation. As explained in Life after
Morrison: extraterritoriality and RICO, the Supreme Court has clarified that
"two isolated acts of racketeering activity do not constitute a pattern."

Civil vs. Criminal RICO Considerations
The analysis above applies to both civil and criminal RICO claims. However,
if this were a civil RICO case, additional requirements would apply:
Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy ("To establish a § 1962(c) RICO claim, the
following elements must be proven: • Enterprise: A structured group of
individuals associated for a common purpose. • Pattern of racketeering
activity: At least two acts of racketeering, as specified within the statute,
within 10 years. • Conduct: Directly or indirectly conducting the enterprise's
affairs through racketeering. • Injury: An injury to business or property due
to the racketeering activity.").
The injury requirement in particular would require showing concrete
business or property damage resulting from the pattern of racketeering
activity.
Conclusion
Based on the alleged facts and the legal authorities provided, there are
significant challenges to establishing that these activities constitute a
"pattern of racketeering activity" under RICO:
Predicate Acts: While the PayPal transfer could potentially qualify as
wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343 if deceptive means were used with
fraudulent intent, and the service of an eviction notice based on unfiled
pleadings might constitute obstruction of justice under certain
circumstances, both would require substantial additional factual
development to meet all elements of these predicate offenses.
Relatedness: The two alleged acts are connected by their relation to
the divorce proceedings and share some common participants and
purposes, potentially satisfying the relatedness requirement.
Continuity: The limited scope and finite nature of the alleged activities
present a substantial challenge to establishing the continuity element
required for a RICO pattern. The acts appear to be isolated incidents
related to a single domestic dispute rather than ongoing or threatened
criminal activity.
Enterprise: The loose family association described in the facts may not
constitute an "enterprise" as required by RICO, which typically involves
a more structured organization functioning as a continuing unit.
Interstate Commerce: While the use of PayPal may satisfy the
interstate commerce requirement for the wire fraud predicate
specifically, it's questionable whether the overall alleged enterprise
substantially affects interstate commerce as required by RICO.
The domestic context and limited scope of these actions suggest that they
would likely fall outside RICO's intended purpose of combating organized
criminal enterprises and ongoing patterns of racketeering activity. While
1.

4. 
5. 

=== PAGE 10 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
individual criminal charges might be appropriate if the elements of wire
fraud or obstruction of justice could be proven beyond a reasonable doubt,
establishing a RICO violation based on these facts would face substantial
legal hurdles.
As explained in RICO: A Primer, "The heart of a RICO case is the existence
of a pattern of racketeering activity." While the scenario described contains
elements that might technically satisfy some RICO requirements, the totality
of circumstances—particularly the challenges in establishing continuity and
a proper enterprise—suggests that these actions would likely not rise to the
level of a pattern of racketeering activity as contemplated by RICO and
interpreted by the courts.
Legal Authorities
Wisdom v. First Midwest Bank, of Poplar Bluff, 167 F.3d 402 (8th Cir. 1999)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Eighth Circuit

The pattern element 'requires at least two acts of racketeering activity.' 18
U.S.C. § 1961(5); see also H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S.
229, 237-38, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989). However, a mere
allegation of two or more acts is insufficient to state a RICO claim; the
predicate acts must be related and must 'amount to or pose a threat of
continued criminal activity.' See United HealthCare Corp. v. American Trade
Ins. Co., Ltd., 88 F.3d 563, 571 (8th Cir.1996) (quoting H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at
239, 109 S.Ct. 2893).
Summary
To establish a RICO claim, there must be at least two predicate acts of
racketeering activity that are related and pose a threat of continued criminal
activity. The passage specifically mentions wire fraud as a potential
predicate act, which aligns with the proposition's mention of wire fraud
through deceptive means using PayPal. Additionally, the requirement for the
acts to be related and pose a threat of continued criminal activity supports
the proposition's argument that the alleged acts could constitute a pattern
of racketeering activity.

Section 1961(5) provides that 'pattern of racketeering activity' requires at
least two acts of racketeering activity... In H.J. Inc. the Supreme Court held

=== PAGE 11 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
that 'to prove a pattern of racketeering activity a plaintiff or prosecutor must
show that the racketeering predicates are related, and that they amount to
or pose a threat of continued criminal activity.'... The district court
instructed the jury on the 'pattern' requirement as follows: The statute
defines the pattern of racketeering activity as requiring at least two acts of
racketeering activity within 10 years of each other... It is not necessary that
the two or more acts found to constitute the pattern be acts of the same kind
or nature so long as you find beyond a reasonable doubt that the two acts of
racketeering activity occurred within the time specified and that each was
connected with the other by some common scheme, plan or motive so as to
constitute a pattern...
Summary
The definition of a "pattern of racketeering activity" under RICO requires at
least two related acts of racketeering that pose a threat of continued
criminal activity. The passage explains that these acts do not need to be of
the same kind but must be connected by a common scheme or motive. This
supports the proposition that the mother's actions, if proven to be wire fraud
and obstruction of justice, could constitute a pattern of racketeering activity
if they are related and pose a threat of continued criminal activity.

requires at least two acts of racketeering within a ten-year period... To be
convicted on a section 1962(c) RICO charge, the evidence must show that
the defendant participated in the affairs of the enterprise through a pattern

(1985)
U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C.
§§ 1961-1968, which is directed at 'racketeering activity'—defined in §
1961(1) to encompass, inter alia, acts 'indictable' under specific federal
criminal provisions, including mail and wire fraud—provides in § 1964(c) for
a private civil action to recover treble damages by any person injured in his
business or property 'by reason of a violation of section 1962.' Section
1962(c) prohibits conducting or participating in the conduct of an enterprise
'through a pattern of racketeering activity.' ... Section 1961(5), defining
'pattern of racketeering activity,' states that such a pattern 'requires at least
two acts of racketeering activity.'
Summary
RICO defines "racketeering activity" to include acts indictable under federal
criminal provisions such as wire fraud. The statute requires at least two acts
of racketeering activity to establish a "pattern," which aligns with the
proposition that the mother's actions could constitute such a pattern if they
involve wire fraud and obstruction of justice. The passage supports the idea
that these acts, if proven, could be part of a RICO claim.
United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 101 S.Ct. 2524, 69 L.Ed.2d 246
(1981)
U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
In order to secure a conviction under RICO, the Government must prove
both the existence of an 'enterprise' and the connected 'pattern of
racketeering activity.' The enterprise is an entity, for present purposes a
group of persons associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a
course of conduct. The pattern of racketeering activity is, on the other hand,
a series of criminal acts as defined by the statute. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1) (1976
ed., Supp. III). The former is proved by evidence of an ongoing organization,
formal or informal, and by evidence that the various associates function as a
continuing unit. The latter is proved by evidence of the requisite number of
acts of racketeering committed by the participants in the enterprise.
Summary
The U.S. Supreme Court in United States v. Turkette clarified that for a
RICO conviction, there must be both an "enterprise" and a "pattern of

=== PAGE 13 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
racketeering activity." The enterprise can be a group of individuals
associated for a common purpose, and the pattern of racketeering activity
involves a series of criminal acts. This supports the proposition by providing
a legal framework under which the alleged acts of wire fraud and
obstruction of justice could be considered part of a pattern of racketeering
activity if they are connected to an enterprise.

U.S. Court of Appeals — Second Circuit
Extract
Two of the RICO counts allege that the fraudulent purchase orders, invoices
and credit memoranda constitute a pattern of racketeering activity, the
predicate acts being separate and numerous violations of the Mail Fraud
Act, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1341 (1982) and the Wire Fraud Act, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1343
(1982)... Referring to section 1961(1) which defines 'racketeering activity,'
the report says that that term is defined to include... wire and securities
fraud, and obstruction of justice... 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1961(5) provides: (5)
'pattern of racketeering activity' requires at least two acts of racketeering
activity...
Summary
The definition of "racketeering activity" under RICO includes acts such as
wire fraud and obstruction of justice. The passage also clarifies that a
"pattern of racketeering activity" requires at least two predicate acts. This
directly supports the proposition that the alleged acts of wire fraud and
obstruction of justice could constitute a pattern of racketeering activity
under RICO.
Inc v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Company, 492 U.S. 229, 109 S.Ct. 2893,
106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989)
U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
RICO's legislative history, however, establishes that Congress intended that
to prove a 'pattern of racketeering activity' a plaintiff or prosecutor must
show both 'relationship' and 'continuity'—that the racketeering predicates
are related, and that they either constitute or threaten long-term criminal
activity. Pp. 237-239... 'Racketeering activity' is defined in RICO to mean
'any act or threat involving' specified state-law crimes, any 'act' indictable
under various specified federal statutes, and certain federal 'offenses,' 18
U.S.C. § 1961(1) (1982 ed., Supp. V); but of the term 'pattern' the statute

says only that it 'requires at least two acts of racketeering activity' within a
10-year period, 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5).
Summary
At least two acts of racketeering activity within a 10-year period are
required, and these acts must be related and either constitute or threaten
long-term criminal activity. This supports the proposition that the alleged
acts of wire fraud and obstruction of justice could constitute a pattern of
racketeering activity if they meet these criteria.
Chevron Corp. v. Donziger, 974 F. Supp. 2d 362 (S.D. N.Y. 2014)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of New York
Extract
Section 1503 requires also proof of “a connection between the defendant's
intentional acts and the likelihood of potentially affecting the administration
of justice.” That is, “ ‘the act must have a relationship in time, causation, or
logic with the judicial proceedings.’ ” Obstruction of justice is a predicate
act under RICO in cases where, as here, a defendant's efforts were
“designed to prevent detection and prosecution of the organization's illegal
activities [and] were part of a consistent pattern that was likely to continue
for the indefinite future, absent outside intervention.” ... The pattern
requirement is well defined. The racketeering activity must include “at least
two [predicate] acts” within a ten-year period. The predicate acts must be
“related,” and they must “amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal
activity.” The predicate acts cannot be “isolated events”—instead, they must
“have the same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or
methods of commission.”
Summary
For a RICO claim, there must be at least two predicate acts of racketeering
that are related and pose a threat of continued criminal activity. The passage
explains that these acts must not be isolated and should have similar
purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of commission. The
passage also highlights that obstruction of justice can be a predicate act if it
is connected to judicial proceedings and designed to prevent detection and
prosecution of illegal activities. This supports the proposition that the
mother's actions, if proven to be deceptive and obstructive, could constitute
a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO.

Extract
A substantial number of, the predicate acts alleged in the Amended
Complaint are asserted to be violations of the federal mail and wire fraud
statutes, 18 U.S.C. §§ 1341, 1343. As the Second Circuit has repeatedly
recognized, '[t]he essential elements of a mail [or wire] fraud violation are
(1) a scheme to defraud, (2) money or property [as the object of the
scheme], and (3) use of the mails [or wires] to further the scheme.'
Summary
The essential elements of wire fraud include a scheme to defraud, the
objective of obtaining money or property, and the use of wires to further the
scheme. This directly relates to the proposition, as the mother's alleged
actions of transferring funds via PayPal under deceptive means could be
seen as a scheme to defraud, with the use of electronic means (wires) to
further that scheme. This supports the argument that her actions could
constitute wire fraud, which is a predicate act under RICO.
Delta Truck & Tractor, Inc. v. J.I. Case Co., 855 F.2d 241 (5th Cir. 1988)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
A pattern of racketeering activity 'requires at least two acts of racketeering.'
18 U.S.C. Sec. 1961(5). Predicate acts of racketeering are defined to include
wire and mail fraud. Id. at Sec. 1961(1)(B). In Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co.,
473 U.S. 479, 496 n. 14, 105 S.Ct. 3275, 3285 n. 14, 87 L.Ed.2d 346 (1985),
the Supreme Court noted that 'while two acts [of racketeering] are
necessary, they may not be sufficient.' The critical features of a pattern of
racketeering activity are continuity and relationship.
Summary
Requirements for a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO, specifically
noting that at least two acts of racketeering are required, and these acts can
include wire fraud. The proposition involves alleged acts of wire fraud and
obstruction of justice, which could potentially meet the criteria for a pattern
of racketeering activity if they are related and pose a threat of continued
criminal activity. The passage supports the proposition by confirming that
wire fraud is a recognized predicate act under RICO and that a pattern
requires at least two such acts.

Extract
Plaintiffs contend that, when taken as true, the alleged acts of mail and wire
fraud establish that Defendants violated 18 U.S.C. §§ 1962(b) and (c) of
RICO. Those sections render civilly liable any person: who, through 'a
pattern or racketeering activity,' acquires or maintains an interest in or
control of an enterprise engaged in interstate commerce, 18 U.S.C. §
1962(b); or who, being employed by or associated with such an enterprise,
conducts or participates in the conduct of its affairs through a 'pattern of
racketeering activity.' 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). 'Racketeering activity' includes
any act indictable under numerous federal criminal provisions, including
mail and wire fraud as those offenses are defined at 18 U.S.C. §§ 1341 and
1343. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1)(B). RICO states that a 'pattern of racketeering
activity requires at least two acts of racketeering activity.' 18 U.S.C. §
1961(5). To establish the requisite pattern, Plaintiffs 'must show that the
racketeering predicates are related, and that they amount to or pose a
threat of continued criminal activity.'
Summary
Requirements for establishing a "pattern of racketeering activity" under
RICO, which includes at least two acts of racketeering activity that are
related and pose a threat of continued criminal activity. The passage
specifically mentions wire fraud as a predicate act under RICO, which is
relevant to the proposition that the mother's actions could constitute wire
fraud. Additionally, the passage discusses the need for the acts to be related
and pose a threat of continued criminal activity, which aligns with the
proposition's assertion of a pattern of racketeering activity.

racketeering activity.' 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). 'Racketeering activity' includes
any of several listed crimes 'which is chargeable under State law and
punishable by imprisonment for more than one year,' as well as any act
chargeable under one of several enumerated federal statutes. § 1961(1). A
'pattern of racketeering activity' requires at least two acts of racketeering
activity, § 1961(5), which must be 'related' and 'amount to or pose a threat of
continued criminal activity.'

Summary
Statutory requirements for a RICO claim, specifically the need for a "pattern
of racketeering activity," which requires at least two related acts that pose a
threat of continued criminal activity. This directly relates to the proposition,
as it suggests that the alleged acts of wire fraud and obstruction of justice
could meet these criteria if they are related and pose such a threat.

U.S. District Court — District of Puerto Rico
Extract
The issuing and processing of the checks constitute a violation of the civil
RICO statute. In order to prove a violation of civil RICO, plaintiff must prove:
(1) that there existed an enterprise, which affected interstate commerce; (2)
that codefendants were employed by or associated with the enterprise; (3)
that codefendants participated in the conduct of the enterprise's affairs; and
(4) that codefendants' participation was through a pattern of racketeering
activity... A pattern requires at least two criminal activities within ten years.
18 U.S.C. § 1961(5) (1984). In addition, the racketeering predicates must be
related and amount to or pose a continued threat of criminal activity.
Summary
Elements necessary to establish a civil RICO violation, which includes
proving a pattern of racketeering activity. This pattern requires at least two
related criminal acts that pose a threat of continued criminal activity. The
passage supports the proposition by providing a legal framework for
considering the alleged acts of wire fraud and obstruction of justice as part
of a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO.

Summary
To establish a RICO violation, a plaintiff must demonstrate at least two
predicate acts of racketeering that are related and pose a threat of
continued criminal activity. The passage specifically mentions wire fraud as
a predicate act under RICO, which aligns with the proposition's claim of wire
fraud through deceptive means using PayPal. Additionally, the requirement
for acts to be related and pose a threat of continued activity supports the
proposition's claim of a pattern of racketeering activity.

To plead a civil RICO action, a plaintiff must plead specific, non-conclusory,
facts which, if accepted as true, show the existence of four elements: '(1)
conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity.' ... To plead a 'pattern' of 'racketeering activity,' a plaintiff must set
forth well-pled allegations of conduct violating specified federal or state
statutes. Racketeering acts include ... violations of certain federal statutes,
such as the mail and wire fraud statutes. See 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1). A ''pattern
of racketeering activity' requires at least two acts of racketeering activity'
within ten years of each other. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5). ... To satisfy this
mandate, a plaintiff must plead facts showing that racketeering acts are
'related, and that they amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal
activity.'
Summary
Elements required to plead a civil RICO action, including the need for a
"pattern of racketeering activity" which involves at least two acts of
racketeering within ten years. It specifies that these acts must be related
and pose a threat of continued criminal activity. The passage also identifies
wire fraud as a potential racketeering act under 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1). This
directly supports the proposition that the alleged acts of wire fraud and
obstruction of justice could constitute a pattern of racketeering activity
under RICO.

Extract
To establish a substantive RICO violation, a plaintiff must show “a pattern of
racketeering activity.” 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). A pattern of racketeering activity
requires, at minimum, two acts of racketeering activity within ten years of

number of acts necessary to establish a pattern of racketeering activity, the
Supreme Court has held that the minimum two acts are not necessarily
sufficient. In order to show a “pattern” of racketeering activity, a plaintiff
must show “that the racketeering predicates are related, and that they

Summary
To establish a RICO violation, there must be a pattern of racketeering
activity, which requires at least two related predicate acts that pose a threat
of continued criminal activity. This directly relates to the proposition, as the
alleged acts of wire fraud and obstruction of justice could be considered
predicate acts under RICO if they are related and pose such a threat.

Extract
To show a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO requires showing that
four separate elements have been met: (i) there must be at least two acts
that would qualify as racketeering activity; (ii) the acts must have occurred
within ten years of each other; (iii) the acts must be related to each other or
part of a common scheme; and (iv) the acts must pose a threat of ongoing or
expanding criminal activity.

Extract
Racketeering activity includes any act which is indictable under a number of
federal criminal statutes, including mail fraud and wire fraud. Any act that
does not fall within the purview of RICO's definition of predicate offenses is
not an act of 'racketeering activity.' ... A 'pattern of racketeering activity'
requires at least two acts of racketeering activity within a ten-year period.
18 U.S.C. § 1961(5). Although at least two acts of racketeering are necessary
to constitute a pattern, two acts may not be sufficient. ... 'To prove a pattern
of racketeering activity a plaintiff must show that the predicate acts are
related to each other and that they either constitute or threaten long-term
continued criminal activity.' ... Predicate acts are related if they 'have the
same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of
commission, or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics
and are not isolated events.'
Summary
For a RICO claim, the alleged acts must be indictable under federal statutes
like wire fraud. The passage also clarifies that a pattern of racketeering
activity requires at least two related predicate acts that either constitute or
threaten long-term criminal activity. The acts must be related by purpose,
result, participants, or method, which aligns with the proposition's
description of the mother's actions and the involvement of the stepfather
and grandparents.

Cir. 1996)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Eighth Circuit
Extract
UHC's surviving RICO claim was predicated on 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), which
states: It shall be unlawful for any person employed by or associated with
any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or
foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the
conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering
activity or collection of unlawful debt. In order to demonstrate a violation of
this section, therefore, a plaintiff must establish (1) the existence of an
enterprise; (2) defendant's association with the enterprise; (3) defendant's
participation in predicate acts of racketeering; and (4) defendant's actions
constitute a pattern of racketeering activity. ... We have held that even a
routine mailing (or wire use), or one sent for a legitimate business purpose
may satisfy the 'actual use' requirement 'so long as it assists ... in carrying
out the fraud.' ... Therefore, we conclude that UHC presented sufficient
evidence to establish the predicate acts of racketeering. ... Instead, to prove
a pattern of racketeering activity, a plaintiff must show that 'the
racketeering predicates are related, and that they amount to or pose a
threat of continued criminal activity.'

Summary
To establish a RICO violation, a plaintiff must demonstrate a pattern of
racketeering activity, which includes showing that the predicate acts are
related and pose a threat of continued criminal activity. The passage also
clarifies that even routine wire use can satisfy the requirement if it assists in
carrying out the fraud. This supports the proposition that the mother's
actions, involving deceptive wire transfers and influencing others to serve
an eviction notice based on unfiled pleadings, could constitute a pattern of
racketeering activity.

Whoever, having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to
defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent
pretenses, representations, or promises, transmits or causes to be

Summary
18 U.S.C. § 1343 defines wire fraud as a crime involving a scheme to defraud
or obtain money through false pretenses, using wire communications in
interstate commerce. The mother's actions of transferring funds via PayPal
under deceptive means could fall under this definition of wire fraud, as
PayPal transactions typically involve interstate wire communications. This
supports the proposition that her actions could be considered a predicate
act of racketeering under RICO.

Summary
The definition of "racketeering activity" under 18 U.S.C. § 1961 includes acts
indictable under sections 1343 (wire fraud) and 1503 (obstruction of
justice). The passage also defines a "pattern of racketeering activity" as
requiring at least two acts of racketeering. This directly supports the

Summary
The RICO Act makes it unlawful for any person to engage in a pattern of
racketeering activity to acquire or maintain control of an enterprise
affecting interstate or foreign commerce. The proposition involves alleged
acts of wire fraud and obstruction of justice, which are considered predicate
acts under RICO. The passage supports the proposition by establishing the
legal framework under which such activities could be considered a pattern
of racketeering.
Life after Morrison: extraterritoriality and RICO.
Vanderbilt Journal of Transnational Law - Vanderbilt University,
School of Law - Mello, R. Davis - 2011-11-01
Extract
The RICO statute meticulously defines 'racketeering activity.' (71)
'Racketeering activity' includes a broad range of federal crimes and other
serious crimes, including bribery, counterfeiting, mail fraud, wire fraud,
obstruction of justice... (72) Congress was more ambiguous as to the
meaning of a 'pattern' of racketeering activity. Under the statute, a 'pattern
of racketeering activity' consists of 'at least two acts of racketeering activity'
committed within a ten-year time period. (73)... Justice White noted in
footnote 14 that: [T]he definition of a 'pattern of racketeering activity' differs
from the other provisions in [section] 1961 in that it states that a pattern
'requires at least two acts of racketeering activity,' not that it 'means' two
such acts. The implication is that while two acts are necessary, they may not
be sufficient... (86) Justice White also cited RICO's legislative history, which,
he determined, 'supports the view that two isolated acts of racketeering

activity do not constitute a pattern.' (87)... the Court held that 'a plaintiff or
prosecutor must prove ... continuity of racketeering activity, or its
threat.' (100)...
Summary
Detailed explanation of what constitutes "racketeering activity" under RICO,
including wire fraud and obstruction of justice, which are relevant to the
proposition. It also discusses the requirement of a "pattern of racketeering
activity," which involves at least two acts that are related and pose a threat
of continued criminal activity. The passage highlights the need for continuity
and relationship between the acts, which aligns with the proposition's claim
of a pattern involving deceptive financial transactions and obstruction of
justice.

The most commonly charged RICO predicate acts are mail fraud and wire
fraud, 18 U.S.C. §§ 1341, 1343. The elements of proof necessary to establish
mail or wire fraud predicates are set forth in Section 5.10, infra. ... Under 18
U.S.C. § 1341 [1343], a person who has devised or intended to devise a
scheme or artifice to defraud, or to obtain money or property by means of
false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, and who uses
the mails [or interstate wire communications] to execute or attempt to
execute the scheme or artifice to defraud, has committed mail [wire]
fraud. ... A pattern of racketeering activity requires at least two acts of
racketeering activity within ten years of each other [one of which must have
occurred after October 15, 1970]. Those acts must be related to each other,
and must also amount to, or pose a threat of, continuing criminal activity.
Summary
Elements required to establish wire fraud, which aligns with the
proposition's claim of transferring funds via PayPal under deceptive means.
Additionally, the passage explains the requirement of a pattern of
racketeering activity, which involves at least two related acts that pose a
threat of continued criminal activity. This supports the proposition's claim of
a pattern involving wire fraud and obstruction of justice.

Extract
The first element of RICO requires two or more predicate acts of
'racketeering activity.'(28) RICO defendants need not be convicted of each
underlying offense before a civil or criminal RICO offense is charged.(29)
Under [sections] 1961(1), the term 'racketeering activity' includes a broad
assortment of state and federal crimes... wire fraud; mail fraud;...
obstruction of justice; obstruction of criminal investigations;... (36.) See H.J.,
Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 230 (1989) (holding that two
acts may not be sufficient to establish RICO violation);... (254.) As defined by
the statute, 'pattern of racketeering activity' requires at least two acts of
racketeering activity, one of which occurred after the effective date of this
chapter and the last of which occurred within ten years (excluding any
period of imprisonment) after the commission of a prior act of racketeering
activity....' 18 U.S.C. [sections] 1961(5) (1998).
Summary
RICO requires at least two predicate acts of racketeering activity, which can
include wire fraud and obstruction of justice. These acts must be related and
pose a threat of continued criminal activity. The passage also clarifies that a
conviction for each underlying offense is not necessary before charging a
RICO offense. This supports the proposition that the mother's actions, if
proven to involve wire fraud and obstruction of justice, could constitute a
pattern of racketeering activity under RICO.

The Brief - American Bar Association - 2024-01-01
Extract
A violation of § 1962(c), the section on which Sedima relies, requires (1)
conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity. The plaintiff must allege each of the elements to state a claim. They
are all equally essential components, and the complaint will fail if any one of
them is not adequately pleaded. In particular, RICO claims based on mail or
wire fraud must comport with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b)’s
requirement that allegations involving fraud be pleaded with particularity...
To establish a § 1962(c) RICO claim, the following elements must be proven:
• Enterprise: A structured group of individuals associated for a common
purpose. • Pattern of racketeering activity: At least two acts of racketeering,
as specified within the statute, within 10 years. • Conduct: Directly or
indirectly conducting the enterprise’s affairs through racketeering. • Injury:
An injury to business or property due to the racketeering activity.

Summary
Necessary elements to establish a RICO claim under § 1962(c), which
includes proving a pattern of racketeering activity through at least two
predicate acts, such as wire fraud and obstruction of justice. The passage
also emphasizes the need for these acts to be related and continuous, which
aligns with the proposition's claim of a pattern of racketeering activity
involving wire fraud and obstruction of justice. The requirement for an
enterprise and injury to business or property is also addressed, which
supports the proposition's context of financial and procedural manipulation.
RICO: A Primer
Extract
The heart of a RICO case is the existence of a pattern of racketeering
activity. Under the statute, 'racketeering activity' includes a host of offenses.
Section 1961 defines the phrase to include any crime listed in subdivisions
A, B, C, D, E, F, or G of section 1961. Among other things, 'racketeering
activities' include 'any act which is indictable under' a list of federal criminal
statutes. The list covers an expansive range of violations, for example,
violations of the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. ' 1951 (extortion); 18 U.S.C. ' 1341
(mail fraud) and 1343 (wire fraud); 18 U.S.C. ' 1831 (economic espionage);
18 U.S.C. ' 1832 (theft of trade secrets); 18 U.S.C. ' 1952 (Travel Act); 18
U.S.C. ' 1956, 1957 (money laundering); and 18 U.S.C. ' 2318-2320
(copyright infringement). Mail and wire fraud are the most common
predicate acts.
Summary
The passage explains that a RICO case requires a pattern of racketeering
activity, which includes offenses such as wire fraud. The proposition involves
allegations of wire fraud through deceptive means using PayPal, which
aligns with the predicate acts described in the passage. Additionally, the
passage notes that mail and wire fraud are common predicate acts,
supporting the idea that the alleged actions could constitute a pattern of
racketeering activity under RICO.
