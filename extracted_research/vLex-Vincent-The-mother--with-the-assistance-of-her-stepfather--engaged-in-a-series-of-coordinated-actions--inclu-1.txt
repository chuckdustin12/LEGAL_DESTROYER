Question
The mother, with the assistance of her stepfather, engaged in a series of
coordinated actions, including deceptive communications, financial
transactions, and the use of false statements in legal proceedings, with the
goal of removing the husband from the marital home and business. Under 18
U.S.C. § 1962(c), a RICO claim requires: (1) the existence of an enterprise,
(2) the defendant's association with the enterprise, (3) the defendant's
participation in the conduct of the enterprise's affairs, and (4) a pattern of
racketeering activity. The coordinated actions described, including the
alleged scheme to deceive the husband, financial transactions across state
lines, and the use of false statements in legal proceedings, could potentially
constitute an "enterprise" under RICO if they demonstrate a structured and
ongoing collaboration with a common purpose.
Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
The coordinated actions of the mother and stepfather could potentially
constitute an "enterprise" under RICO if they demonstrate a structured and
ongoing collaboration with a common purpose. To establish a successful
RICO claim, the plaintiff would need to prove that this enterprise engaged in
a pattern of racketeering activity affecting interstate commerce, as defined
by 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c).
Summary
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) provides
both criminal penalties and civil remedies against individuals who engage in
certain patterns of illegal activity in connection with an enterprise. For the
mother and stepfather's coordinated actions to constitute a RICO violation
under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), four elements must be established: (1) the
existence of an enterprise, (2) the defendants' association with the
enterprise, (3) the defendants' participation in the conduct of the
enterprise's affairs, and (4) a pattern of racketeering activity. The
coordinated actions described—including deceptive communications,
financial transactions across state lines, and false statements in legal
proceedings—could qualify as an "enterprise" if they demonstrate a
structured and ongoing collaboration with a common purpose.
Supreme Court and circuit court precedents have interpreted the concept of
"enterprise" broadly to include any group of individuals associated in fact,
even without a formal legal structure. To constitute an enterprise, the
association must have three key characteristics: (1) a common or shared
purpose, (2) some continuity of structure and personnel, and (3) an
ascertainable structure distinct from the pattern of racketeering activity
itself. If the mother and stepfather's coordinated efforts to remove the

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
husband from the marital home and business demonstrate these
characteristics, their association could qualify as an enterprise under RICO,
potentially subjecting them to significant civil liability or criminal penalties if
the other elements of a RICO claim are also satisfied.
Background and Relevant Law
Legislation
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) was
enacted as Title IX of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970. Section
1962(c) of RICO provides:
"It shall be unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any
enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign
commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of
such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity or
collection of unlawful debt." 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c)
This provision establishes the core prohibition of RICO that is relevant to the
scenario involving the mother and stepfather. To understand what activities
are covered by this prohibition, it is necessary to examine how RICO defines
its key terms.
RICO defines an "enterprise" as "any individual, partnership, corporation,
association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals
associated in fact although not a legal entity." 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4) This broad
definition encompasses both legitimate business organizations and informal
associations formed for illicit purposes.
A "pattern of racketeering activity" is defined as requiring "at least two acts
of racketeering activity, one of which occurred after the effective date of this
chapter and the last of which occurred within ten years (excluding any
period of imprisonment) after the commission of a prior act of racketeering
activity." 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5)
"Racketeering activity" itself is defined to include numerous state and
federal crimes, including:
Mail fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1341)
Wire fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343)
Financial institution fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1344)
Obstruction of justice (18 U.S.C. § 1503)
Witness tampering (18 U.S.C. § 1512)
Retaliating against witnesses (18 U.S.C. § 1513)
18 U.S.C. § 1961(1)
These statutory definitions provide the framework for determining whether
the coordinated actions of the mother and stepfather could constitute a
RICO violation.

Case Law
Supreme Court Precedent
The United States Supreme Court has provided significant guidance on
interpreting RICO's enterprise requirement. In United States v. Turkette,
452 U.S. 576 (1981), the Court established that an enterprise under RICO
includes not only legitimate businesses but also entirely illicit organizations.
The Court held that an "enterprise" is "an entity, for present purposes a
group of persons associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a
course of conduct." Turkette, 452 U.S. at 583. The Court emphasized that
the enterprise is "separate and apart from the pattern of activity in which it
engages" and is "proved by evidence of an ongoing organization, formal or
informal, and by evidence that the various associates function as a
continuing unit." Id.
It should be noted that Turkette was abrogated by United States v. Lane,
474 U.S. 438 (1986), but the abrogation related to issues of misjoinder under
Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 8, not to Turkette's interpretation of
RICO's enterprise requirements, which remains valid precedent.
In Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938 (2009), the Supreme Court further
clarified the enterprise requirement, holding that a RICO enterprise need
not have a formal hierarchical structure, defined roles for associates, or a
name, regular meetings, or established rules. Instead, all that is required is
"a purpose, relationships among those associated with the enterprise, and
longevity sufficient to permit these associates to pursue the enterprise's
purpose." Boyle, 556 U.S. at 946. The Court approved jury instructions
stating that an association-in-fact enterprise can be "established by evidence
showing an ongoing organization, formal or informal, and by evidence that
the people making up the association functioned as a continuing unit." Id. at
945
Regarding the pattern requirement, the Supreme Court in H.J. Inc. v.
Northwestern Bell Telephone Company, 492 U.S. 229 (1989) held that to
prove a pattern of racketeering activity, a plaintiff must show that the
predicate acts are related and "either constitute or threaten long-term
criminal activity." H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 239. The Court explained that RICO
was intended to apply broadly, acknowledging "a new situation in which
persons engaged in long-term criminal activity often operate wholly within
legitimate enterprises." Id. at 243
Circuit Court Decisions
Circuit court decisions have further developed the enterprise concept. The
Third Circuit in United States v. Console, 13 F.3d 641 (3rd Cir. 1993)
outlined the elements required to establish a RICO claim under § 1962(c):
"(1) the existence of an enterprise affecting interstate commerce; (2) that
the defendant was employed by or associated with the enterprise; (3) that
the defendant participated, either directly or indirectly, in the conduct or the

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
affairs of the enterprise; and (4) that he or she participated through a
pattern of racketeering activity." Console, 13 F.3d at 652-653
The Seventh Circuit in United States v. Brown, 973 F.3d 667 (7th Cir. 2020)
reiterated the broad definition of an association-in-fact enterprise, stating
that it "includes any 'group of persons associated together for a common
purpose of engaging in a course of conduct.'" Brown, 973 F.3d at 682 The
court emphasized that an association-in-fact under RICO "need not have any
structural features beyond 'a purpose, relationships among those associated
with the enterprise, and longevity sufficient to permit these associates to
pursue the enterprise's purpose.'" Id.
In Tabas v. Tabas, 47 F.3d 1280 (3rd Cir. 1995), the Third Circuit addressed
the continuity requirement for establishing a pattern of racketeering
activity. The court stated that continuity can be shown "where it is shown
that the predicates are a regular way of conducting defendant's ongoing
legitimate business." Tabas, 47 F.3d at 1295 It is worth noting that Tabas
was declined to be extended by Yucaipa Am. All. Fund I, LP v. Ehrlich, No.
16-3664 (3rd Cir. Nov 15, 2017), but this subsequent treatment primarily
concerned other aspects of the case and does not undermine Tabas's
analysis of the continuity requirement.
The Eleventh Circuit in U.S. v. Hewes, 729 F.2d 1302 (11th Cir. 1984)
clarified that a RICO enterprise can exist even if not all members participate
in or are aware of all activities, stating that "a RICO enterprise exists where
a group of persons associates, formally or informally, with the purpose of
conducting illegal activity." Hewes, 729 F.2d at 1311
District Court Decisions
District courts have also contributed to interpreting RICO's enterprise
requirement. In McGillvary v. Scutari, 23-cv-22605-JMY (D. N.J. Dec 23,
2024), the court reiterated that an association-in-fact RICO enterprise
requires "a purpose, relationships among those associated with the
enterprise, and longevity sufficient to permit these associates to pursue the
enterprise's purpose." McGillvary, 23-cv-22605-JMY
The District of Minnesota in Schreier v. Drealan Kvilhaug Hoefker & Co. P.A.,
611 F.Supp.3d 746 (D. Minn. 2020) specified three requirements to show a
RICO enterprise: "(1) a common purpose that animates the individuals
associated with it; (2) an ongoing organization with members who function
as a continuing unit; and (3) an ascertainable structure distinct from the
conduct of a pattern of racketeering." Schreier, 611 F.Supp.3d at 756
In Prudential Ins. Co. of America v. US Gypsum, 711 F. Supp. 1244 (D. N.J.
1989), the court outlined similar criteria, stating that to establish a RICO
enterprise, a plaintiff must prove "(1) there is an ongoing organization,
which has a structure or framework for making decisions and a mechanism
to control the affairs of the group on an ongoing basis; (2) that the various
associates function as a continuing unit... and (3) that the enterprise is
separate and distinct from... the pattern of activity in which it engages." 
Prudential, 711 F. Supp. at 1253

Secondary Materials
Secondary sources further clarify RICO's requirements. The article "Civil
Rico: A Tool of Advocacy" emphasizes that a violation of § 1962(c) "requires
(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity" and that each element must be adequately pleaded for a viable
claim. Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy (2024)
"RICO: A Primer" notes that racketeering acts "need not be similar or
directly related to each other" but must be "related in some way to the
affairs of the charged enterprise," such as by furthering the goals of the
enterprise or being committed on behalf of the enterprise. RICO: A Primer
(2022)
"Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations" explains that a RICO
enterprise "must have a continuous structure and purpose independent from
the racketeering activity in which it engages, and its alleged confederates
must work with a common purpose or towards a shared goal." RACKETEER
INFLUENCED AND CORRUPT ORGANIZATIONS (2021)
Analysis
Establishing an Enterprise
The first step in determining whether the mother and stepfather's actions
could constitute a RICO violation is to assess whether their coordinated
efforts qualify as an "enterprise" under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c).
Association-in-Fact Enterprise
Under RICO, an "enterprise" includes any "group of individuals associated in
fact although not a legal entity." 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4) The Supreme Court in 
Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938 (2009) established that an association-
in-fact enterprise requires only three features: "a purpose, relationships
among those associated with the enterprise, and longevity sufficient to
permit these associates to pursue the enterprise's purpose." Boyle, 556 U.S.
at 946
In the scenario presented, the mother and stepfather engaged in "a series of
coordinated actions" including "deceptive communications, financial
transactions, and the use of false statements in legal proceedings" with the
specific goal of "removing the husband from the marital home and business."
This description suggests:
A Common Purpose: The goal of removing the husband from the
marital home and business provides a clear common purpose, satisfying
the first requirement identified in Boyle and reiterated in Schreier v.
Drealan Kvilhaug Hoefker & Co. P.A., 611 F.Supp.3d 746 (D. Minn.
2020).
1. 

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Relationships Among Associates: The mother and stepfather worked
together in a coordinated manner, suggesting the necessary
relationship between associates. The Eleventh Circuit in U.S. v. Hewes,
729 F.2d 1302 (11th Cir. 1984) clarified that a RICO enterprise can
exist even if not all members participate in or are aware of all activities,
as long as there is "an association for the purpose of conducting illegal
activity." Hewes, 729 F.2d at 1311
Longevity: While the scenario doesn't specify the duration of their
activities, the description of "a series of coordinated actions" involving
multiple types of conduct (communications, financial transactions, legal
proceedings) suggests an ongoing course of action rather than a single
incident, potentially satisfying the longevity requirement.
Structured Organization
Beyond these basic requirements, courts have examined whether the alleged
enterprise has some form of structure. In United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S.
576 (1981), the Supreme Court stated that an enterprise is proved by
"evidence of an ongoing organization, formal or informal, and by evidence
that the various associates function as a continuing unit." Turkette, 452 U.S.
at 583
The described scenario suggests coordination between the mother and
stepfather across different types of activities (communications, financial
transactions, legal proceedings), which could indicate an "ongoing
organization" where they functioned as a "continuing unit." As noted in 
Prudential Ins. Co. of America v. US Gypsum, 711 F. Supp. 1244 (D. N.J.
1989), a RICO enterprise requires "an ongoing organization, which has a
structure or framework for making decisions and a mechanism to control the
affairs of the group on an ongoing basis." Prudential, 711 F. Supp. at 1253
Importantly, Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938 (2009) clarified that a
RICO enterprise need not have a formal hierarchical structure, defined
roles, a name, regular meetings, or established rules. Boyle, 556 U.S. at 946
This means that the relatively simple structure of two individuals (mother
and stepfather) working together could still qualify as an enterprise if they
had a mechanism for coordinating their actions toward their common goal.
Distinction from Pattern of Racketeering
A critical requirement for establishing a RICO enterprise is that it must be
distinct from the pattern of racketeering activity itself. As stated in United
States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576 (1981), "the enterprise is not the pattern of
racketeering activity; it is an entity separate and apart from the pattern of
activity in which it engages." Turkette, 452 U.S. at 583
In Schreier v. Drealan Kvilhaug Hoefker & Co. P.A., 611 F.Supp.3d 746 (D.
Minn. 2020), the court required "an ascertainable structure distinct from the
conduct of a pattern of racketeering." Schreier, 611 F.Supp.3d at 756
Similarly, RACKETEER INFLUENCED AND CORRUPT ORGANIZATIONS
(2021) notes that "The RICO enterprise must have a continuous structure
2. 
3. 

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
and purpose independent from the racketeering activity in which it
engages."
For the mother and stepfather to constitute a RICO enterprise, their
association would need to have some existence or structure beyond the
specific acts of alleged racketeering. This might be shown if they had an
ongoing relationship and coordinated activities that extended beyond the
specific deceptive communications, financial transactions, and false
statements in legal proceedings that form the basis of the alleged
racketeering pattern.
Interstate Commerce Requirement
For a RICO claim under § 1962(c), the enterprise must be "engaged in, or
the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce." 18 U.S.C. §
1962(c) The scenario mentions "financial transactions across state lines,"
which would likely satisfy this requirement. As noted in "Civil Rico: A Tool of
Advocacy," "RICO requires no more than a slight effect upon interstate
commerce." Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy (2024)
Pattern of Racketeering Activity
Establishing the existence of an enterprise is only one element of a RICO
claim. The claim also requires proving a "pattern of racketeering activity"
connected to that enterprise.
Predicate Acts
The coordinated actions described in the scenario must qualify as
"racketeering activity" as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1) for a RICO claim to
proceed. The described actions potentially implicate several predicate acts
listed in the statute:
Deceptive Communications: Could constitute mail fraud (18 U.S.C. §
1341) or wire fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343) if they involved use of mail or
interstate wires with intent to defraud.
Financial Transactions Across State Lines: Could implicate wire
fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343) or financial institution fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1344)
depending on the nature of the transactions.
False Statements in Legal Proceedings: Could constitute
obstruction of justice (18 U.S.C. § 1503), witness tampering (18 U.S.C. §
1512), or perjury in certain circumstances.
For these acts to constitute a "pattern," there must be at least two acts of
racketeering activity within a ten-year period. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5)
1. 
2. 
3. 

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Relationship and Continuity
The Supreme Court in H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Company,
492 U.S. 229 (1989) established that a pattern requires "relationship" and
"continuity" between the predicate acts. H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 239 The acts
must be related to each other and "either constitute or threaten long-term
criminal activity." Id.
In the described scenario, the various acts appear related as they all served
the common goal of "removing the husband from the marital home and
business." As for continuity, the Third Circuit in Tabas v. Tabas, 47 F.3d 1280
(3rd Cir. 1995) noted that continuity can be satisfied where "predicates are a
regular way of conducting defendant's ongoing legitimate business." Tabas,
47 F.3d at 1295 Although Tabas was declined to be extended by Yucaipa Am.
All. Fund I, LP v. Ehrlich, No. 16-3664 (3rd Cir. Nov 15, 2017), its analysis of
continuity remains instructive.
The series of coordinated actions described in the scenario could potentially
establish the continuity required for a pattern if they occurred over a
sufficient period or threatened ongoing criminal activity.
Defendants' Association with and Participation in the
Enterprise
For a RICO claim under § 1962(c), it must be shown that the defendants
(here, the mother and stepfather) were "employed by or associated with" the
enterprise and that they "conduct[ed] or participate[d], directly or indirectly,
in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering
activity." 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c)
In this scenario, both the mother and stepfather would clearly be
"associated with" the alleged enterprise as they are its only members. Their
active engagement in the coordinated actions described would likely satisfy
the requirement that they "participate" in the conduct of the enterprise's
affairs.
Exceptions and Caveats
Domestic Relations Exception
Courts have traditionally been reluctant to extend federal jurisdiction to
matters involving domestic relations, which are typically governed by state
family law. While not explicitly addressed in the provided materials, this
doctrine could potentially limit the application of RICO in a case involving
disputes between spouses over marital property.

=== PAGE 9 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
RICO Not Designed for "Ordinary" Business or Family
Disputes
Although not expressly stated in the provided materials, courts have
sometimes been hesitant to allow RICO claims to transform ordinary
commercial or family disputes into federal racketeering cases. This concern
arises from RICO's severe penalties, including treble damages and
attorney's fees in civil cases.
Proving Criminal Intent
The predicate acts that form the basis of a RICO claim are criminal offenses
that typically require proof of specific intent. For example, mail and wire
fraud require proof of a "scheme to defraud" and "specific intent to defraud."
The materials provided do not detail the specific nature of the "deceptive
communications" or "false statements," so the ability to establish the
required criminal intent would depend on those facts.
Statute of Limitations
RICO claims are subject to a four-year statute of limitations. The timing of
the coordinated actions would be critical in determining whether a RICO
claim is time-barred.
Conclusion
Based on the provided legal materials, the coordinated actions of the mother
and stepfather described in the scenario could potentially constitute an
"enterprise" under RICO if they demonstrate a structured and ongoing
collaboration with a common purpose. Supreme Court precedent in Boyle v.
United States, 556 U.S. 938 (2009) establishes that an association-in-fact
enterprise requires only "a purpose, relationships among those associated
with the enterprise, and longevity sufficient to permit these associates to
pursue the enterprise's purpose." Boyle, 556 U.S. at 946 The common goal of
removing the husband from the marital home and business, coupled with
coordinated actions across multiple domains (communications, financial
transactions, legal proceedings), could satisfy these requirements.
However, establishing the existence of an enterprise is only one element of a
successful RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). The claimant would also
need to prove:
That the enterprise engaged in or affected interstate commerce (likely
satisfied by the "financial transactions across state lines")
That the defendants (mother and stepfather) were associated with the
enterprise
That the defendants participated in the conduct of the enterprise's
affairs
That they did so through a pattern of racketeering activity
1. 
2.

=== PAGE 10 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
The "deceptive communications," "financial transactions," and "false
statements in legal proceedings" would need to qualify as specific predicate
acts under 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1), such as mail fraud, wire fraud, or obstruction
of justice. Additionally, these acts would need to demonstrate both
"relationship" and "continuity" to constitute a pattern as required by H.J.
Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Company, 492 U.S. 229 (1989).
While the coordinated actions described could potentially form the basis of a
RICO claim, the success of such a claim would ultimately depend on the
specific facts regarding the nature, extent, and duration of the mother and
stepfather's activities, as well as their intent in undertaking those activities.
The application of RICO to what appears to be a domestic dispute, rather
than traditional organized crime, also raises questions about whether courts
would be willing to extend RICO to this context, though the statutory text
and case law suggest that RICO's reach is not limited to traditional
organized crime scenarios.
Legal Authorities
Boyle v. United States, 129 S.Ct. 2237, 173 L.Ed.2d 1265, 556 U.S. 938, 77
USLW 4474 (2009)
U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
RICO makes it 'unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any
enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign
commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of
such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.' §
1962(c). The statute defines 'enterprise' to include 'any individual,
partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or
group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.' §
1961(4). ... 'Moreover, you may find an enterprise where an association of
individuals, without structural hierarchy, forms solely for the purpose of
carrying out a pattern of racketeering acts. Such an association of persons
may be established by evidence showing an ongoing organization, formal or
informal, and ... by evidence that the people making up the association
functioned as a continuing unit. Therefore, in order to establish the
existence of such an enterprise, the government must prove that: (1) There
is an ongoing organization with some sort of framework, formal or informal,
for carrying out its objectives; and (2) the various members and associates
of the association function as a continuing unit to achieve a common
purpose.'
Summary
An enterprise does not need a formal structure but must show an ongoing
organization and coordinated actions. This supports the proposition that the
coordinated actions of the mother and stepfather could constitute an

=== PAGE 11 ===

"enterprise" under RICO if they demonstrate a structured and ongoing
collaboration with a common purpose.
Corley v. Rosewood Care Center, Inc., 142 F.3d 1041, 1998 WL 206367 (7th
Cir. 1998)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Seventh Circuit
Extract
Corley alleges that the foregoing acts violated the following provision of the
RICO statute: It shall be unlawful for any person employed by or associated
with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or
foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the
conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering
activity or collection of unlawful debt. 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). ... The complaint
further alleges that Vander Maten and Hoefling conducted the affairs of the
enterprise through the predicate acts of mail fraud detailed above for the
purpose of maximizing their income and net worth. According to the
complaint, the predicate acts of mail fraud are sufficient to form a pattern of
racketeering activity under the statute.
Summary
The court in Corley v. Rosewood Care Center, Inc. addressed the elements
required to establish a RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). The court
found that the allegations of mail fraud and other predicate acts were
sufficient to form a pattern of racketeering activity. This supports the
proposition that coordinated actions, including deceptive communications
and financial transactions, could constitute an "enterprise" under RICO if
they demonstrate a structured and ongoing collaboration with a common
purpose.
P &amp; P MARKETING, INC. v. Ditton, 746 F. Supp. 1354 (N.D. Ill. 1990)
U.S. District Court — Northern District of Illinois
Extract
Civil actions for RICO violations are authorized by Section 1964(c) which
provides that 'any person injured in his business or property by reason of a
violation of Section 1962' may recover treble damages and costs including
attorney's fees. 18 USC § 1964(c); H.G. Gallimore, Inc. v. Abdula, 652
F.Supp. 437 (N.D.Ill.1987). Section 1962 sets out the prohibited conduct. 18
USC § 1962(a)-(d); see Id. at 439, 440. Plaintiff has alleged that defendants
violated Section 1962(c) which prohibits... Any person employed by or
associated with any enterprise, engaged in, or the activities of which affect,
interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or

=== PAGE 12 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of
racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt. 18 USC § 1962(c).
Regardless of which subsection of Section 1962 defendants are alleged to
have violated, five elements are common and necessary to every civil RICO
claim. These essential elements are: (1) a 'person'; (2) an 'enterprise'
engaged in or affecting interstate commerce; (3) 'racketeering activity'
which (4) occurred in a 'pattern' and (5) an injury. Id. at 440; 18 USC §
1962(a)-(d).
Summary
The passage outlines the essential elements required for a civil RICO claim
under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). It specifies that a RICO claim requires the
existence of an enterprise, the defendant's association with the enterprise,
participation in the conduct of the enterprise's affairs, and a pattern of
racketeering activity. These elements align with the proposition that the
coordinated actions described could potentially constitute an "enterprise"
under RICO if they demonstrate a structured and ongoing collaboration with
a common purpose.
U.S. v. Hewes, 729 F.2d 1302 (11th Cir. 1984)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Eleventh Circuit
Extract
The Court held that a 'group of persons who had committed a variety of
unrelated offenses with no agreement as to any particular crime could be
convicted of a RICO offense, because they were associated for the purpose
of making money from repeated criminal activity.' Id. at 920-21. Finally, the
Cagnina Court implicitly rejected the contention that Turkette's reference to
the enterprise as a 'continuing unit' requires participation of all of its
members throughout the life of the enterprise. 'Although the evidence did
not show that every member of the enterprise participated in or knew about
all its activities, such evidence was not necessary to prove the existence of
the enterprise.' Id. at 922. Our precedent indicates that a RICO enterprise
exists where a group of persons associates, formally or informally, with the
purpose of conducting illegal activity.
Summary
A RICO enterprise can exist even if not all members participate in or are
aware of all activities, as long as there is an association for the purpose of
conducting illegal activity. This supports the proposition that the
coordinated actions of the mother and stepfather could constitute a RICO
enterprise if they were associated for a common illegal purpose, such as
removing the husband from the marital home and business.

Tabas v. Tabas, 47 F.3d 1280 (3rd Cir. 1995)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Third Circuit
Extract
The RICO statute provides for civil damages for 'any person injured in his
business or property by reason of a violation of [18 U.S.C. Sec. 1962].' 18
U.S.C. Sec. 1964(c). A common thread running throughout Sec. 1962 is that
an injured party must demonstrate that the defendant was engaged in a
'pattern of racketeering activity.' Section 1962(c) prohibits any person
employed by or associated with an enterprise engaged in interstate
commerce from conducting or participating in the affairs of the enterprise
through 'a pattern of racketeering activity.' ... The continuity requirement is
likewise satisfied where it is shown that the predicates are a regular way of
conducting defendant's ongoing legitimate business (in the sense that it is
not a business that exists for criminal purposes), or of conducting or
participating in an ongoing and legitimate RICO 'enterprise.'
Summary
The RICO statute requires a demonstration of a "pattern of racketeering
activity" and that this pattern can be established through either closed-
ended or open-ended continuity. The passage explains that continuity can be
shown if the predicate acts are a regular way of conducting the defendant's
ongoing legitimate business or participating in an ongoing and legitimate
RICO enterprise. This supports the proposition that the coordinated actions
described, if they demonstrate a structured and ongoing collaboration with a
common purpose, could potentially constitute an "enterprise" under RICO.
United States v. Console, 13 F.3d 641 (3rd Cir. 1993)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Third Circuit
Extract
RICO defines an “enterprise” as “any individual, partnership, corporation,
association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals
associated in fact although not a legal entity.” 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4). In United
States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 583, 101 S.Ct. 2524, 2528–29, 69 L.Ed.2d
246 (1981), the Supreme Court stated that an enterprise “is an entity
separate and apart from the pattern of activity in which it engages,” and
that it is “proved by evidence of an ongoing organization, formal or informal,
and by evidence that the various associates function as a continuing unit.” ...
(1) the existence of an enterprise affecting interstate commerce; (2) that the
defendant was employed by or associated with the enterprise; (3) that the
defendant participated, either directly or indirectly, in the conduct or the
affairs of the enterprise; and (4) that he or she participated through a
pattern of racketeering activity.

Summary
Legal definition of a RICO "enterprise" and outlines the elements required to
establish a RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). It emphasizes that an
enterprise can be an association in fact, which may include both legal and
non-legal entities, and that it must be shown to function as a continuing unit
with a common purpose. This supports the proposition by suggesting that
the coordinated actions of the mother and stepfather, if structured and
ongoing, could meet the definition of an enterprise under RICO.
U.S. v. Miller, 116 F.3d 641 (2nd Cir. 1997)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Second Circuit
Extract
RICO makes it 'unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any
enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign
commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of
such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.' 18 U.S.C.
§ 1962(c). ... The terms 'conduct' and 'participate in the conduct' of an
enterprise, include the performance of the acts, functions or duties that are
necessary or helpful to the operation of the enterprise. A person may
participate in the conduct of an enterprise even though he had no part in the
management or control of the enterprise and no share in any profits. But the
participation must be wilful and knowing.
Summary
RICO liability under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) is not limited to those with primary
responsibility or upper management. It includes lower-rung participants
who are under the direction of upper management, as long as their
participation is willful and knowing. This supports the proposition that the
coordinated actions by the mother and stepfather could constitute an
"enterprise" under RICO if they demonstrate a structured and ongoing
collaboration with a common purpose, even if they were not in upper
management or had no share in profits.

Inc v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Company, 492 U.S. 229, 109 S.Ct. 2893,
106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989)
U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
RICO's legislative history, however, establishes that Congress intended that
to prove a 'pattern of racketeering activity' a plaintiff or prosecutor must
show both 'relationship' and 'continuity'—that the racketeering predicates
are related, and that they either constitute or threaten long-term criminal
activity. ... The limits of the relationship and continuity concepts that
combine to define a RICO pattern, and the precise methods by which
relatedness and continuity or its threat may be proved, cannot be fixed in
advance with such clarity that it will always be apparent whether in a
particular case a 'pattern of racketeering activity' exists. ... Title 18 U.S.C. §
1961(1) (1982 ed., Supp. V), with its very generous definition of
'racketeering activity,' acknowledges the breakdown of the traditional
conception of organized crime, and responds to a new situation in which
persons engaged in long-term criminal activity often operate wholly within
legitimate enterprises.
Summary
The RICO statute is intended to be applied broadly, encompassing a wide
range of criminal activities, including those that occur within legitimate
enterprises. The requirement for a "pattern of racketeering activity" involves
demonstrating both a relationship and continuity among the acts, which can
include deceptive communications and financial transactions. The passage
supports the proposition by indicating that the coordinated actions
described could potentially meet the RICO criteria if they show a structured
and ongoing collaboration with a common purpose.

2007)
U.S. District Court — Eastern District of New York
Extract
RICO broadly defines an 'enterprise' as including 'any individual,
partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or
group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.' 18 U.S.C.
§ 1961(4). In United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 580, 101 S.Ct. 2524,
69 L.Ed.2d 246 (1981), the Supreme Court recognized that '[t]here is no
restriction upon the associations embraced by the definition: an enterprise
includes any union or group of individuals associated in fact,' including both
legitimate ventures and wholly criminal organizations... The enterprise is an
entity, for present purposes a group of persons associated together for a
common purpose of engaging in a course of conduct. The pattern of
racketeering activity is, on the other hand, a series of criminal acts as
defined by the statute. The former is proved by evidence of an ongoing
organization, formal or informal, and by evidence that the various associates
function as a continuing unit.
Summary
The definition of an "enterprise" under RICO is broad and includes any
group of individuals associated in fact, whether legitimate or criminal. The
passage emphasizes that an enterprise is distinct from the pattern of
racketeering activity and must be shown to have a common purpose and
function as a continuing unit. This supports the proposition that the
coordinated actions of the mother and stepfather could constitute an
"enterprise" if they demonstrate a structured and ongoing collaboration with
a common purpose.

U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C.
§§ 1961-1968, which is directed at 'racketeering activity'—defined in §
1961(1) to encompass, inter alia, acts 'indictable' under specific federal
criminal provisions, including mail and wire fraud—provides in § 1964(c) for
a private civil action to recover treble damages by any person injured in his
business or property 'by reason of a violation of section 1962.' Section
1962(c) prohibits conducting or participating in the conduct of an enterprise
'through a pattern of racketeering activity.'

Summary
RICO targets "racketeering activity," which includes acts indictable under
federal criminal provisions such as mail and wire fraud. The statute allows
for private civil actions to recover damages for injuries caused by violations
of section 1962, which prohibits conducting an enterprise through a pattern
of racketeering activity. This aligns with the proposition that coordinated
actions, including deceptive communications and financial transactions,
could constitute an "enterprise" under RICO if they demonstrate a
structured and ongoing collaboration with a common purpose.

U.S. District Court — Southern District of New York

To plead a violation of § 1962(c), a plaintiff must allege '(1) conduct (2) of an
enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity.' Sedima,
S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479, 496, 105 S.Ct. 3275, 3285, 87 L.Ed.2d
346 (1985) (footnote omitted). 'Racketeering activity' is the commission of
specific predicate acts for which a defendant could be convicted, id. at 488,
and a 'pattern of racketeering activity' requires at least two such acts, 18
U.S.C. § 1961(5). A RICO 'enterprise' is defined as 'any individual,
partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or
group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.' 18 U.S.C.
§ 1961(4). Since Sedima, this circuit has emphasized its requirement of
'continuity plus relationship' with respect to the RICO enterprise, defining it
as a 'group associated 'for a common purpose of engaging in a course of
conduct' which 'is proved by evidence of an ongoing organization, formal or
informal, and by evidence that the various associates function as a
continuing unit.'
Summary
Necessary elements to establish a RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c),
which includes the existence of an enterprise, the defendant's association
with the enterprise, participation in the conduct of the enterprise's affairs,
and a pattern of racketeering activity. The passage also emphasizes the need
for "continuity plus relationship" in defining a RICO enterprise, which aligns
with the proposition's description of coordinated actions with a common
purpose.

Summary
Necessary elements to establish a RICO claim, which includes
demonstrating the existence of an enterprise, the defendant's association
with it, and a pattern of racketeering activity. The description of a RICO
enterprise as a group with a common purpose, ongoing organization, and
distinct structure aligns with the proposition's description of coordinated
actions with a common goal. This supports the idea that the described
actions could potentially meet the criteria for a RICO enterprise.

Extract
To establish the existence of a RICO enterprise, plaintiff must prove (1)
there is an ongoing organization, which has a structure or framework for
making decisions and a mechanism to control the affairs of the group on an
ongoing basis; (2) that the various associates function as a continuing unit,
that is that each individual component perform a role consistent within the
organized structure, which furthers the activities of the organization; and
(3) that the enterprise is separate and distinct from but not necessarily
wholly unrelated to, the pattern of activity in which it engages, but has an
existence beyond that which is necessary to merely commit each of the acts
charged as predicate offenses.
Summary
Criteria for establishing a RICO enterprise, which includes having an
ongoing organization with a decision-making structure, associates
functioning as a continuing unit, and an enterprise that is distinct from the
pattern of racketeering activity. This supports the proposition that the
coordinated actions described could constitute an "enterprise" under RICO if
they demonstrate a structured and ongoing collaboration with a common

of racketeering activity.” ... An “enterprise” as defined by statute includes:
“any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity,
and any union or group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal

with the enterprise, and longevity sufficient to permit these associates to
pursue the enterprise's purpose.” Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938, 946

and a pattern of racketeering activity. The definition of an "enterprise"
includes any group of individuals associated in fact, which aligns with the

(1981)
U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
With respect to § 1962(c), an 'enterprise' is not a 'pattern of racketeering
activity' but is an entity separate and apart from the pattern of activity in
which it engages. In order to secure a conviction, the Government must
prove both the existence of an 'enterprise' and the connected 'pattern of
racketeering activity.' ... The enterprise is an entity, for present purposes a
group of persons associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a
course of conduct. The pattern of racketeering activity is, on the other hand,
a series of criminal acts as defined by the statute.
Summary
An "enterprise" under RICO is distinct from the pattern of racketeering
activity and must be proven as a separate entity. This entity can be a group
of individuals associated for a common purpose, which aligns with the
proposition that the mother and stepfather's coordinated actions could form
such an enterprise. The passage supports the idea that if their actions
demonstrate a structured and ongoing collaboration with a common
purpose, they could potentially be considered an "enterprise" under RICO.

Summary
For a RICO claim, it is essential to establish the existence of an "enterprise"
that is engaged in or affects interstate or foreign commerce. The definition
of an "enterprise" includes any group of individuals associated in fact, even

structure, and function as a continuing unit. This aligns with the proposition
that the coordinated actions of the mother and stepfather could constitute
an "enterprise" if they demonstrate these characteristics.

The definition of an "enterprise" under RICO is broad and includes any
group of individuals associated for a common purpose. The passage from
"United States v. Brown" supports the proposition by explaining that an
"enterprise" under RICO can be an association-in-fact, which does not
require formal structural features but must have a purpose, relationships
among those involved, and sufficient longevity to pursue the enterprise's

RICO - the rejection of an economic motive requirement.
Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology - Northwestern University,
School of Law - Randolph, Jennifer G. - 1995-03-22
Extract
The Court rejected the defendant's argument 'that RICO was intended solely
to protect legitimate business enterprises from infiltration by racketeers and
that RICO does not make criminal the participation in an association which
performs only illegal acts and which has not infiltrated or attempted to
infiltrate a legitimate enterprise.' Instead, the Court interpreted the term
'enterprise' broadly. The Court reasoned that, if Congress had intended
enterprise to include only legitimate enterprises, it 'could easily have ...
insert[ed] a single word, 'legitimate.''
Summary
The interpretation of "enterprise" under RICO is broad and not limited to
legitimate businesses. This supports the proposition that the coordinated
actions described could constitute an "enterprise" under RICO, as the
statute does not require the enterprise to be legitimate or economically
motivated.

Section 1962(c) of RICO states: It shall be unlawful for any person employed
by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which
affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or
indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise s affairs through a pattern of
racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt. (28) To successfully
prosecute a RICO charge, the Government must prove beyond a reasonable
doubt that: '(1) an enterprise existed; (2) the enterprise participated in or its
activities affected interstate commerce; (3) the defendant was employed by
or was associated with the enterprise; (4) the defendant conducted or
participated in the conduct of the enterprise; (5) through a pattern of
racketeering activity.' (29)
Summary
Section 1962(c) of RICO requires proving the existence of an enterprise, its
effect on interstate commerce, the defendant's association with the
enterprise, and participation in a pattern of racketeering activity. The
passage supports the proposition by explaining that a RICO enterprise can
be any group of individuals associated in fact, which aligns with the
described coordinated actions of the mother and stepfather. The broad
terms of RICO allow for flexibility in recognizing such enterprises, which
could include the alleged scheme to deceive the husband and conduct
financial transactions.

Extract
ICO purposes, an enterprise must exist independently from the racketeering
activity in which it engages, its groups must have a common or shared
purpose, and there must be at least some continuity of structure or
personnel. To constitute an enterprise, a group must have an ongoing
mechanism for directing the affairs of the group on an ongoing, rather than
an ad hoc, basis. (70) Federal courts have a tremendous amount of
discretion in developing the enterprise prong, and they have recognized a
number of enterprise categories not mentioned in the statute. (71) As a
result, circuit court approaches vary as to which types of enterprises are
encompassed by the statute, how the existence of a RICO enterprise may be
established, and whether the 'person' charged with a RICO violation and the
alleged 'enterprise' must be separate and distinct entities.
Summary
For RICO purposes, an enterprise must have a common purpose and
continuity of structure or personnel. The passage also highlights the
discretion federal courts have in interpreting what constitutes an enterprise,
which can include various categories not explicitly mentioned in the statute.
This supports the proposition that the coordinated actions described could
potentially constitute an "enterprise" under RICO if they demonstrate a
structured and ongoing collaboration with a common purpose.

Extract
Section 1962(c), the most commonly used RICO provision, prohibits persons
employed by or associated with an enterprise from conducting or
participating in the conduct or affairs of that enterprise through a pattern of
racketeering activity... A relationship, or nexus, between the pattern of
racketeering activity and the enterprise is required... [T]he 'enterprise' in [§
1962(c)] connotes generally the vehicle through which the unlawful pattern
of racketeering activity is committed, rather than the victim of that activity.
Subsection (c) makes it unlawful for 'any person employed by or associated
with any enterprise . . . to conduct or participate . . . in the conduct of such
enterprise’s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity . . . .'
Consequently, since the enterprise in subsection (c) is not being acquired, it
need not have a property interest that can be acquired nor an economic
motive for engaging in illegal activity; it need only be an association in fact
that engages in a pattern of racketeering activity.

Summary
The enterprise does not need to have a property interest or economic
motive, but must be an association in fact that engages in racketeering
activities. This supports the proposition that the coordinated actions of the
mother and stepfather could constitute an enterprise under RICO if they
demonstrate a structured and ongoing collaboration with a common
purpose.

Extract
An 'enterprise' includes 'any individual, partnership, corporation,
association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals
associated in fact although not a legal entity.' It is unimportant whether the
defendant promotes or hinders the operation of the enterprise. The basic
hallmark of an enterprise for RICO purposes is that it must contain some
structure distinct from the pattern of racketeering activity that is identified
in the charge, its groups must have a common or shared purpose, and there
must be at least some continuity of structure or personnel.
Summary
For a RICO claim, an "enterprise" can be any group of individuals associated
in fact, even if not a legal entity. The enterprise must have a structure
distinct from the racketeering activity, a common purpose, and continuity of
structure or personnel. This supports the proposition that the coordinated
actions by the mother and stepfather could constitute an "enterprise" under
RICO if they demonstrate these characteristics.

An 'enterprise' includes 'any individual, partnership, corporation,
association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals
associated in fact.' A RICO defendant may also be an individual who is not
formally employed by the enterprise, but still assists the enterprise in its
racketeering activities. The RICO enterprise must have a continuous
structure and purpose independent from the racketeering activity in which it
engages, and its alleged confederates must work with a common purpose or

=== PAGE 28 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
towards a shared goal. The RICO enterprise must also have a mechanism for
directing its affairs on an ongoing, rather than ad hoc, basis.
Summary
Definition of an "enterprise" under RICO, which includes any group of
individuals associated in fact. It also clarifies that a RICO enterprise must
have a continuous structure and purpose independent from the racketeering
activity, and its members must work towards a common goal. This supports
the proposition that the coordinated actions of the mother and stepfather
could constitute an enterprise if they demonstrate a structured and ongoing
collaboration with a common purpose.
Reflections on Reves v. Ernst & Young: its meaning and impact on
substantive, accessory, aiding abetting and conspiracy liability under RICO.
American Criminal Law Review - Georgetown University Law Center -
Blakey, G. Robert - 1996-01-01
Extract
The concept of the 'enterprise' was selected by Congress when it enacted
RICO because it desired to use 'terms and concepts of breadth.' Indeed, the
statute itself broadly describes 'enterprise' to include 'any individual,
partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or
group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.' Thus, any
legal entity may be an enterprise, and any group of persons--in any
combination of natural and legal persons--may also constitute an enterprise,
even though it is not a legal entity, by being an association-in-fact.
Summary
The definition of "enterprise" under RICO is intentionally broad,
encompassing both legal entities and associations-in-fact. This supports the
proposition that the coordinated actions of the mother and stepfather could
constitute an "enterprise" under RICO if they demonstrate a structured and
ongoing collaboration with a common purpose.
Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy
The Brief - American Bar Association - 2024-01-01
Extract
A violation of § 1962(c), the section on which Sedima relies, requires (1)
conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity. The plaintiff must allege each of the elements to state a claim. They
are all equally essential components, and the complaint will fail if any one of

=== PAGE 29 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
them is not adequately pleaded. In particular, RICO claims based on mail or
wire fraud must comport with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b)’s
requirement that allegations involving fraud be pleaded with particularity.
The practitioner through their pleadings must articulate with great care and
attention a viable racketeering claim. In addition, § 1962(a), (b), and (c) are
limited in scope to conduct involving enterprises engaged in or the activities
of which affect interstate commerce. It is the activities of the enterprise, not
each predicate act, that must affect interstate or foreign commerce. RICO
requires no more than a slight effect upon interstate commerce.
Summary
Essential elements required to establish a RICO claim under § 1962(c),
which include conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering
activity. It emphasizes the need for particularity in pleading fraud-related
claims and highlights the requirement that the enterprise's activities affect
interstate commerce. This directly supports the proposition by providing a
legal framework for understanding how the described actions could
constitute a RICO violation if they meet these criteria.
Insurance Fraud is a Violent Crime.
Insurance Advocate - CINN Group, Inc. - 2024-03-01
Extract
RICO CONSPIRACY The essence of a RICO conspiracy is the existence of an
agreement to violate RICO's substantive provisions. RICO conspiracy was
established by proof of: (a) of an agreement to join a racketeering scheme,
(b) of the defendant's knowing engagement in the scheme with the intent
that its overall goals be effectuated, and (c) that the scheme involved, or by
agreement between any members of the conspiracy was intended to involve,
two or more predicate acts of racketeering.
Summary
A RICO conspiracy requires an agreement to violate RICO's provisions,
knowing engagement in the scheme, and the involvement of two or more
predicate acts of racketeering. The proposition involves coordinated actions
that could be seen as a racketeering scheme, with the mother and stepfather
potentially forming an agreement to engage in such activities. The passage
supports the idea that if these actions are structured and ongoing with a
common purpose, they could constitute an "enterprise" under RICO.
RECONCEIVING COERCION-BASED CRIMINAL DEFENSES.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
The inquiry here is meant to invoke the 'pattern of racketeering activity'
element of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).
The Organized Crime Control Act (1970), which includes RICO, provides that
'criminal conduct forms a pattern if it embraces criminal acts that have the
same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of
commission, or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics
and are not isolated events.' The Supreme Court characterized this
requirement as a 'relationship' element and held that the statute further
requires a 'continuity' element, 'referring either to a closed period of
repeated conduct, or to past conduct that by its nature projects into the
future with a threat of repetition.'
Summary
The passage provides a detailed explanation of what constitutes a "pattern
of racketeering activity" under RICO. It highlights the need for criminal acts
to have similar purposes, results, participants, or methods, and emphasizes
the importance of a "relationship" and "continuity" element. This aligns with
the proposition that the coordinated actions of the mother and stepfather
could form a RICO enterprise if they demonstrate a structured and ongoing
collaboration with a common purpose.
RICO: A Primer
Extract
A plaintiff is required to demonstrate that the defendant conducted the
affairs of an enterprise though a pattern of racketeering activity. The person
and the enterprise generally must be distinct; but, of course, a Rico person
can be a part of an enterprise... The racketeering acts need not be similar or
directly related to each other; rather, it is sufficient that the racketeering
acts are related in some way to the affairs of the charged enterprise,
including, for example, that: the racketeering acts furthered the goals of or
benefitted the enterprise, the enterprise or the defendant's role in the
enterprise enabled the defendant to commit, or facilitated the commission
of, the racketeering acts, the racketeering acts were committed at the
behest of, or on behalf of, the enterprise, or the racketeering acts had the
same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims or methods of
commission.
Summary
The racketeering acts do not need to be similar but must relate to the
enterprise's affairs, which aligns with the proposition's description of
coordinated actions, including deceptive communications and financial
transactions, as potentially constituting an enterprise if they demonstrate a
structured and ongoing collaboration with a common purpose.

Defending Civil RICO Claims: A Defense Plan Should Be In Every Business's
Arsenal
Extract
RICO is not a simple statute. It pertains to conduct associated with an
'enterprise' and 'a pattern racketeering activity.' An enterprise is an
individual or legal entity, or a union or group of individuals associated in fact
although not a legal entity, while a pattern of racketeering activity requires
long-term, organized conduct to violate state and federal laws. There are
four types of activities outlawed by RICO, and claims under Section 1962(c)
are the most commonly asserted: * Section 1962(c) prohibits a person from
conducting the affairs of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering;
Summary
RICO claims require the existence of an "enterprise" and a "pattern of
racketeering activity." The passage explains that an enterprise can be a
group of individuals associated in fact, which aligns with the proposition
that the mother and stepfather's coordinated actions could constitute such
an enterprise. Additionally, the passage highlights that Section 1962(c) is

commonly asserted in RICO claims, which is relevant to the proposition's
focus on this section.
Defending RICO Claims In The Business Context Part III
Extract
Knowingly receive or derive proceeds from a pattern of racketeering activity
or through the collection of an unlawful debt; Knowingly acquire or
maintain, directly or indirectly, any interest in or control of any enterprise or
real property through a pattern of racketeering activity or through collection
of an unlawful debt; Knowingly conduct or participate, directly or indirectly,
in any enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity or the collection
of an unlawful debt; or Conspire or endeavor to violate any of these
racketeering provisions.
Summary
The passage outlines the elements necessary for a RICO claim, including the
participation in an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. This
directly relates to the proposition, as it suggests that the coordinated
actions of the mother and stepfather, if they involve racketeering activities
such as deceptive communications and financial transactions, could meet
the criteria for a RICO claim.
Yegiazaryan v. Smagin : RICO Becomes A Tool For Foreign Plaintiffs To
Collect On Arbitration Awards In The U.S.
Extract
Under RICO, racketeering activity is defined broadly and includes, among
other things, money laundering, bribery, and a series of fraudulent activities.
RICO makes it unlawful for any person: * To engage, directly or indirectly,
with income derived from racketeering activity and use the illegal income to
invest or acquire an interest in an enterprise which is engaged in or impacts
interstate or foreign commerce. * To acquire or maintain, directly or
indirectly, any interest in or control of an enterprise engaged in or affecting
interstate or foreign commerce through racketeering activity. * Employed by
or associated with any enterprise engaged in or affecting interstate or
foreign commerce to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the
conduct of such enterprise's affairs through racketeering activity. * To
conspire to violate these provisions.
Summary
RICO defines racketeering activity broadly, including fraudulent activities,
and outlines unlawful acts such as engaging with income derived from
racketeering, acquiring or maintaining interest in an enterprise through

=== PAGE 33 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
racketeering, and participating in an enterprise's affairs through
racketeering. These elements align with the proposition's description of
coordinated actions involving deception, financial transactions, and false
statements, potentially constituting an "enterprise" under RICO.
