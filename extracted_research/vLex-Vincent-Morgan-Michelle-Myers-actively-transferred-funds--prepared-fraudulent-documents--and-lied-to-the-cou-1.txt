Question
Morgan Michelle Myers actively transferred funds, prepared fraudulent
documents, and lied to the court, while Daniel Kenneth Branthoover used
the funds to purchase tools (a second phone) to further the scheme. To be
liable under RICO, a defendant must participate in the operation or
management of the enterprise’s affairs (Reves v. Ernst & Young, 507 U.S.
170 (1993)). The active participation of both Morgan and Daniel in planning,
funding, and executing the fraudulent scheme demonstrates their operation
and management of the enterprise’s affairs, satisfying this element of RICO.
Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
Based on the Reves "operation or management" test and subsequent Third
Circuit interpretations, Morgan Myers and Daniel Branthoover's activities in
planning, funding, and executing the fraudulent scheme satisfy the
requirement for participation in the enterprise's affairs under RICO. Their
actions demonstrate sufficient control and direction of the enterprise to
establish liability, even though they may not have held formal management
positions.
Summary
Under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO),
specifically 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), a defendant must "conduct or participate,
directly or indirectly, in the conduct of [an] enterprise's affairs through a
pattern of racketeering activity." The Supreme Court in Reves v. Ernst &
Young, 507 U.S. 170 (1993) established that such participation requires
some part in directing the enterprise's affairs, commonly known as the
"operation or management" test. The facts indicate that Morgan Myers
actively transferred funds, prepared fraudulent documents, and lied to the
court, while Daniel Branthoover used those funds to purchase tools (a
second phone) to further the scheme. These activities demonstrate direct
involvement in operating and managing the enterprise's affairs.
Third Circuit case law has consistently interpreted Reves to extend RICO
liability beyond those with formal management positions to include
individuals who knowingly further the illegal aims of the enterprise by
executing essential components of the scheme. The courts have recognized
that even "lower-rung participants" who are under the direction of upper
management can be liable if they have some part in directing the
enterprise's affairs. Morgan and Daniel's actions in planning, funding, and
executing the fraudulent scheme constitute participation in the operation
and management of the enterprise's affairs sufficient to satisfy this element
of RICO liability, as their conduct was integral to the functioning of the
enterprise rather than merely peripheral.

Background and Relevant Law
RICO Statutory Framework
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) is codified
at 18 U.S.C. § 1962. Section 1962(c) specifically states: "It shall be unlawful
for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or
the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or
participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs
through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt."
This provision forms the basis of the current analysis regarding whether
Morgan and Daniel's activities satisfy the "operation or management"
requirement for RICO liability.
The Reves "Operation or Management" Test
The seminal case defining the level of participation required under RICO is 
Reves v. Ernst & Young, 507 U.S. 170 (1993). In Reves, the Supreme Court
established what has become known as the "operation or management" test.
The Court held that "in order to 'participate, directly or indirectly, in the
conduct of such enterprise's affairs,' one must have some part in directing
those affairs." The Court further clarified that "RICO liability is not limited to
those with primary responsibility for the enterprise's affairs, just as the
phrase 'directly or indirectly' makes clear that RICO liability is not limited to
those with a formal position in the enterprise, but some part in directing the
enterprise's affairs is required."
This test has been consistently applied in subsequent cases to determine
whether a defendant's involvement in an enterprise is sufficient to establish
liability under RICO.
Third Circuit Interpretations of the "Operation or
Management" Test
The Third Circuit has extensively interpreted and applied the Reves
"operation or management" test in numerous cases, providing valuable
guidance for assessing whether Morgan and Daniel's actions satisfy this
element of RICO liability.
In U.S. v. Parise, 159 F.3d 790 (3rd Cir. 1998), the Third Circuit elaborated
on the Reves test, stating: "According to Reves, '[i]n order to 'participate,
directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs,' one must
have some part in directing those affairs.' However, one need not hold a
formal position within an enterprise in order to 'participate' in its affairs."
The court emphasized that "the 'operation or management' test does not
limit RICO liability to upper management because 'an enterprise is
'operated' not just by upper management but also by lower-rung participants
in the enterprise who are under the direction of upper management.'"
Crucially, the court concluded that "RICO liability may extend to those who
do not hold a managerial position within an enterprise, but who do

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
nonetheless knowingly further the illegal aims of the enterprise by carrying
out the directives of those in control."
Similarly, in In re Insurance Brokerage Antitrust Litig., 618 F.3d 300 (3rd
Cir. 2010), the court reiterated that "mere association with an enterprise
does not violate § 1962(c). To be liable under this provision, a defendant
must 'conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such
enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.'" The court
emphasized that "one is not liable under [§ 1962(c)] unless one has
participated in the operation or management of the enterprise itself," citing
Reves.
In Jaguar Cars, Inc. v. Royal Oaks Motor Car Co., Inc., 46 F.3d 258 (3rd Cir.
1995), the Third Circuit recognized that even "'[o]utsiders' may be liable
under Sec. 1962(c) if they are 'associated with' an enterprise and participate
in the conduct of its affairs--that is, participate in the operation or
management of the enterprise itself." The court noted that an enterprise
might be "'operated' or 'managed' by others [those not in upper
management] 'associated with' the enterprise who exert control over it as,
for example, by bribery," quoting Reves.
In Smith v. Berg, 247 F.3d 532 (3rd Cir. 2001), the Third Circuit held that "in
accord with the general principles of criminal conspiracy law, a defendant
may be held liable for conspiracy to violate section 1962(c) if he knowingly
agrees to facilitate a scheme which includes the operation or management
of a RICO enterprise."
The Elements of a RICO Claim
To establish liability under RICO, several elements must be proven. As
articulated in Argiro v. Lamancusa, 23-1820 (3rd Cir. Apr 03, 2024), "To
plead a RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), a plaintiff 'must allege (1)
conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity.'" The court further explained that "predicate acts are related if they
'have the same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods
of commission, or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing
characteristics and are not isolated events.'" Additionally, "the complaint
must allege that [the defendant] had a sufficient role in the operation or
management of the enterprise to support RICO liability," citing Reves.
This framework is consistently applied across Third Circuit cases. In Hlista
v. Safeguard Props., LLC, No. 15-1812 (3rd Cir. May 05, 2016), the court
similarly stated that "A plaintiff bringing a substantive RICO claim under §
1962(c) must allege '(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern
(4) of racketeering activity.'" The court added that "A pattern of racketeering
activity 'requires at least two acts of racketeering activity within a ten-year
period,'" and that "no defendant can be liable under RICO unless he
participated in two or more predicate offenses sufficient to constitute a
pattern."
In United States v. Ferriero, 866 F.3d 107 (3rd Cir. 2017), the Third Circuit
emphasized the "nexus" element of RICO, which "requires proving a

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
sufficiently close relationship between the defendant, his involvement in the
enterprise's affairs, and the pattern of racketeering." The court stated that
"racketeering must be one means by which the defendant participates in the
conduct of the enterprise's affairs."
Secondary Source Interpretations
Secondary sources further illuminate the requirements for RICO liability
under the "operation or management" test. According to the American
Criminal Law Review's article "Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations" (2022), RICO liability is "not limited to those with primary
responsibility for the enterprise's affairs," citing Reves. The article also cites 
United States v. Fowler, 535 F.3d 408, 418 (6th Cir. 2008), which concluded
that "knowingly carrying out the decisions of his superiors" within the
criminal enterprise qualifies as "operation or management" under Reves.
Similarly, the article "Reflections on Reves v. Ernst & Young: its meaning and
impact on substantive, accessory, aiding abetting and conspiracy liability
under RICO" (1996) explains that "the 'operation or management' of the
enterprise is not to merely support or encourage, that is, aid and abet, the
affairs of the enterprise, but requires some participation in the operation or
management of its affairs." The article further clarifies that "'Outsiders' may
be liable under Section 1962(c) if they are 'associated with' an enterprise
and participate in the conduct of its affairs--that is, participate in the
operation or management of the enterprise itself." Importantly, it states that
"The terms 'conduct' and 'participate in the affairs' of an enterprise means
the performance of acts, functions, or duties that are necessary or helpful to
the operation of the enterprise."
Analysis
Application of the "Operation or Management" Test to
Morgan Myers' Actions
Morgan Myers' actions clearly satisfy the "operation or management" test
established in Reves and elaborated upon in subsequent Third Circuit cases.
The facts indicate that Morgan actively transferred funds, prepared
fraudulent documents, and lied to the court. These activities demonstrate
direct involvement in the operation and management of the enterprise's
affairs.
First, transferring funds is a crucial operational function of the fraudulent
enterprise. As recognized in U.S. v. Parise, 159 F.3d 790 (3rd Cir. 1998),
RICO liability extends to those who "knowingly further the illegal aims of the
enterprise by carrying out the directives of those in control." By actively
transferring funds, Morgan was engaging in conduct necessary for the
enterprise's operation, whether or not she held a formal management
position.
Second, preparing fraudulent documents demonstrates Morgan's
involvement in directing the enterprise's affairs. This activity goes beyond

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
mere association with the enterprise, which In re Insurance Brokerage
Antitrust Litig., 618 F.3d 300 (3rd Cir. 2010) clarified is insufficient for RICO
liability. Instead, it constitutes active participation in the operation or
management of the enterprise, as required by Reves.
Third, lying to the court further exemplifies Morgan's role in directing the
enterprise's affairs. This action was integral to the fraudulent scheme and
demonstrates her essential role in its execution. As stated in the article
"Reflections on Reves v. Ernst & Young," the terms "conduct" and
"participate in the affairs" of an enterprise means "the performance of acts,
functions, or duties that are necessary or helpful to the operation of the
enterprise." Morgan's deception of the court was clearly necessary to the
operation of the fraudulent scheme.
The American Criminal Law Review's article supports this conclusion by
citing United States v. Fowler, 535 F.3d 408, 418 (6th Cir. 2008), which held
that "knowingly carrying out the decisions of his superiors" within a criminal
enterprise qualifies as "operation or management" under Reves. Even if
Morgan was acting under the direction of others, her active role in
executing essential components of the scheme would still satisfy the
"operation or management" test.
Application of the "Operation or Management" Test to
Daniel Branthoover's Actions
Daniel Branthoover's actions similarly demonstrate his participation in the
operation or management of the enterprise's affairs. The facts indicate that
Daniel used the funds transferred by Morgan to purchase tools (a second
phone) to further the scheme.
In Jaguar Cars, Inc. v. Royal Oaks Motor Car Co., Inc., 46 F.3d 258 (3rd Cir.
1995), the Third Circuit recognized that even "outsiders" may be liable
under RICO if they are "associated with" an enterprise and participate in the
operation or management of the enterprise itself. By purchasing tools
specifically intended to further the fraudulent scheme, Daniel was directly
participating in the enterprise's operations.
The purchase of a second phone also demonstrates Daniel's deliberate
association with and participation in the enterprise. This action was not
incidental or tangential but was specifically undertaken to advance the
scheme's objectives. As stated in United States v. Ferriero, 866 F.3d 107 (3rd
Cir. 2017), RICO requires "a sufficiently close relationship between the
defendant, his involvement in the enterprise's affairs, and the pattern of
racketeering." Daniel's purposeful acquisition of tools to further the scheme
establishes this nexus.
Furthermore, in Smith v. Berg, 247 F.3d 532 (3rd Cir. 2001), the Third
Circuit held that a defendant may be liable if he "knowingly agrees to
facilitate a scheme which includes the operation or management of a RICO
enterprise." Daniel's actions in purchasing tools for the scheme demonstrate
such knowing facilitation.

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
The Collective Impact of Morgan and Daniel's Actions
Together, Morgan and Daniel's actions constitute a coordinated effort to
operate and manage the enterprise's affairs. Their respective roles in
transferring funds, preparing fraudulent documents, lying to the court, and
purchasing tools to further the scheme demonstrate active participation in
the enterprise's operations.
As articulated in Argiro v. Lamancusa, 23-1820 (3rd Cir. Apr 03, 2024),
predicate acts are related if they "have the same or similar purposes,
results, participants, victims, or methods of commission, or otherwise are
interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not isolated events."
Morgan and Daniel's activities were interrelated and served the common
purpose of advancing the fraudulent scheme.
Moreover, Hlista v. Safeguard Props., LLC, No. 15-1812 (3rd Cir. May 05,
2016) emphasizes that "no defendant can be liable under RICO unless he
participated in two or more predicate offenses sufficient to constitute a
pattern." Both Morgan and Daniel engaged in multiple acts that could
constitute predicate offenses under RICO, establishing the pattern necessary
for liability.
In particular, Morgan's preparation of fraudulent documents and lies to the
court could constitute mail or wire fraud if they involved the use of those
facilities. Similarly, Daniel's use of the fraudulently obtained funds to
purchase tools for the scheme could implicate money laundering provisions.
These acts, if proven to constitute predicate offenses, would satisfy the
pattern requirement for RICO liability.
Lower-Rung Participation as Sufficient for RICO Liability
Even if Morgan and Daniel were not the primary architects of the fraudulent
scheme but rather "lower-rung participants" acting under the direction of
others, their actions would still satisfy the "operation or management" test
under Reves.
As the Third Circuit clarified in U.S. v. Parise, 159 F.3d 790 (3rd Cir. 1998),
the "operation or management" test "does not limit RICO liability to upper
management because 'an enterprise is 'operated' not just by upper
management but also by lower-rung participants in the enterprise who are
under the direction of upper management.'" The court emphasized that
"RICO liability may extend to those who do not hold a managerial position
within an enterprise, but who do nonetheless knowingly further the illegal
aims of the enterprise by carrying out the directives of those in control."
This principle is further supported by the American Criminal Law Review's
article, which notes that RICO liability is "not limited to those with primary
responsibility for the enterprise's affairs," citing Reves. The article also cites 
United States v. Fowler, which concluded that "knowingly carrying out the
decisions of his superiors" within the criminal enterprise qualifies as
"operation or management" under Reves.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Morgan's actions in transferring funds, preparing fraudulent documents,
and lying to the court, as well as Daniel's use of those funds to purchase
tools to further the scheme, demonstrate the kind of knowing furtherance of
the enterprise's illegal aims that the Third Circuit has recognized as
sufficient for RICO liability, even for lower-rung participants.
Exceptions and Caveats
Mere Association Versus Active Participation
It is important to distinguish between mere association with an enterprise
and active participation in its operation or management. As the Third Circuit
emphasized in In re Insurance Brokerage Antitrust Litig., 618 F.3d 300 (3rd
Cir. 2010), "mere association with an enterprise does not violate § 1962(c)."
If Morgan or Daniel were merely aware of the fraudulent scheme but did not
actively participate in it, they would not satisfy the "operation or
management" test. However, the facts indicate that they both took specific
actions—Morgan transferring funds, preparing fraudulent documents, and
lying to the court, and Daniel purchasing tools to further the scheme—that
go beyond mere association and demonstrate active participation in the
enterprise's affairs.
The Need for Predicate Acts
RICO liability requires not only participation in the operation or
management of an enterprise but also engagement in a "pattern of
racketeering activity," which consists of at least two predicate acts. As
stated in Hlista v. Safeguard Props., LLC, No. 15-1812 (3rd Cir. May 05,
2016), "no defendant can be liable under RICO unless he participated in two
or more predicate offenses sufficient to constitute a pattern."
While the facts suggest that Morgan and Daniel engaged in activities that
could constitute predicate offenses under RICO, such as mail or wire fraud
(if the fraudulent documents were transmitted via mail or wire) or money
laundering (if the funds were transferred with the intent to promote
unlawful activity), these specific predicate acts would need to be established
to complete the RICO liability analysis.
The Impact of Tabas v. Tabas and U.S. v. Riccobene
Subsequent Treatment
It is important to note that two cases cited in this analysis have been subject
to subsequent negative treatment. Tabas v. Tabas, 47 F.3d 1280 (3rd Cir.
1995) was declined to be extended by Yucaipa Am. All. Fund I, LP v. Ehrlich,
No. 16-3664 (3rd Cir. Nov 15, 2017), and U.S. v. Riccobene, 709 F.2d 214
(3rd Cir. 1983) was stated as overruled by Pacheco v. Golden Living Ctr.-
Summit, No. 3:10cv1641 (M.D. Pa. Feb 23, 2011).
However, this subsequent treatment does not affect the central holding of
Reves regarding the "operation or management" test, nor does it undermine

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
the Third Circuit's consistent interpretation of that test in cases such as U.S.
v. Parise, In re Insurance Brokerage Antitrust Litig., and Smith v. Berg. The
principles established in these cases regarding the level of participation
required for RICO liability remain valid and applicable to the current
analysis.
The negative treatment of Tabas and Riccobene primarily concerns other
aspects of RICO liability, such as pleading standards and the definition of an
"enterprise," rather than the "operation or management" test at issue here.
Therefore, while acknowledging this negative treatment, it does not
significantly impact the conclusion that Morgan and Daniel's actions satisfy
the "operation or management" test under Reves.
Conclusion
Based on the Reves "operation or management" test and its interpretation
by the Third Circuit, Morgan Myers and Daniel Branthoover's actions
demonstrate sufficient participation in the operation or management of the
enterprise's affairs to satisfy this element of RICO liability.
Morgan's active transfer of funds, preparation of fraudulent documents, and
lies to the court constitute direct involvement in the enterprise's operations.
These actions go beyond mere association and demonstrate the kind of
participation in directing the enterprise's affairs that Reves requires for
RICO liability.
Similarly, Daniel's use of the fraudulently obtained funds to purchase tools (a
second phone) specifically intended to further the scheme demonstrates his
participation in the operation or management of the enterprise. By
knowingly facilitating the scheme through these purchases, Daniel was
actively participating in the enterprise's affairs, even if he was not in a
formal management position.
The Third Circuit has consistently recognized that RICO liability extends
beyond those with formal management positions to include individuals who
knowingly further the illegal aims of an enterprise by carrying out activities
necessary to its operation. Morgan and Daniel's actions fall squarely within
this understanding of the "operation or management" test.
Furthermore, their coordinated efforts—Morgan providing the funds and
Daniel using them to purchase tools for the scheme—demonstrate the kind
of interrelated activities with a common purpose that the Third Circuit has
recognized as establishing a pattern of racketeering activity.
While the full analysis of RICO liability would also require identification of
specific predicate acts constituting a pattern of racketeering activity, the
"operation or management" element is satisfied by Morgan and Daniel's
active participation in the fraudulent scheme. Their planning, funding, and
execution of the scheme demonstrate their roles in directing the enterprise's
affairs, thereby satisfying this crucial requirement for RICO liability under 
Reves v. Ernst & Young, 507 U.S. 170 (1993) and subsequent Third Circuit
interpretations.

Legal Authorities
Smith v. Berg, 247 F.3d 532 (3rd Cir. 2001)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Third Circuit
Extract
As the District Court observed, the starting point for our analysis is the
Supreme Court's decision in Reves v. Ernst & Young, 507 U.S. 170 (1993). In
Reves, the Court held that to be liable under section 1962(c), a person must
participate in the 'operation or management' of the corrupt enterprise's
affairs. Id. at 179... We therefore hold that any reading of Antar suggesting a
stricter standard of liability under section 1962(d) is inconsistent with the
broad application of general conspiracy law set forth in Salinas. In accord
with the general principles of criminal conspiracy law, a defendant may be
held liable for conspiracy to violate section 1962(c) if he knowingly agrees to
facilitate a scheme which includes the operation or management of a RICO
enterprise.
Summary
Requirement under RICO that a defendant must participate in the
"operation or management" of the enterprise's affairs, as established in
Reves v. Ernst & Young. It further clarifies that under general conspiracy
law, as applied in Salinas, a defendant can be held liable if they knowingly
agree to facilitate a scheme involving the operation or management of a
RICO enterprise. This supports the proposition that both Morgan and
Daniel's active participation in the fraudulent scheme could satisfy the RICO
requirement of participating in the operation or management of the
enterprise.
Banks v. Wolk, 918 F.2d 418 (3rd Cir. 1990)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Third Circuit
Extract
We note that no defendant can be liable under RICO unless he participated
in two or more predicate offenses sufficient to constitute a pattern. This
participation need not be direct. RICO recognizes liability for those who
merely aid and abet the underlying predicate offenses. Petro-Tech, Inc. v.
Western Co. of North America, 824 F.2d 1349, 1356-58 (3d Cir.1987).
Moreover, a defendant can be liable under RICO's conspiracy provision for
agreeing to the commission of a pattern of racketeering activity, even if that
defendant does not directly participate in the underlying acts.

=== PAGE 10 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
Under RICO, a defendant does not need to directly participate in predicate
offenses to be held liable. Liability can extend to those who aid and abet or
conspire to commit a pattern of racketeering activity. This supports the
proposition that both Morgan and Daniel's active participation in the
fraudulent scheme, even if not directly managing the enterprise, could
satisfy RICO's requirements.
Jaguar Cars, Inc. v. Royal Oaks Motor Car Co., Inc., 46 F.3d 258 (3rd Cir.
1995)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Third Circuit
Extract
In Reves, the Court acknowledged that in certain rare instances infiltrating
'persons' distinct from the corporate enterprise could satisfy the 'operation
or management test,' if they exerted sufficient control over the corporation's
activities. ' 'Outsiders' may be liable under Sec. 1962(c) if they are
'associated with' an enterprise and participate in the conduct of its affairs--
that is, participate in the operation or management of the enterprise itself.'
Reves, --- U.S. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 1173 ('An enterprise also might be
'operated' or 'managed' by others [those not in upper management]
'associated with' the enterprise who exert control over it as, for example, by
bribery.').
Summary
The Reves decision allows for RICO liability to extend to individuals who are
not in upper management but who exert control over an enterprise's
activities. This aligns with the proposition that Morgan and Daniel's active
participation in the fraudulent scheme could satisfy the operation or
management requirement under RICO, as they were involved in planning,
funding, and executing the scheme, thereby exerting control over the
enterprise's affairs.
U.S. v. Parise, 159 F.3d 790 (3rd Cir. 1998)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Third Circuit
Extract
In Reves, the Court endorsed the 'operation or management' test to
determine whether a defendant participated in the conduct of an
enterprise's affairs. Id. at 184, 113 S.Ct. 1163. According to Reves, '[i]n
order to 'participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such
enterprise's affairs,' one must have some part in directing those affairs.' Id.

=== PAGE 11 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
at 179, 113 S.Ct. 1163. However, one need not hold a formal position within
an enterprise in order to 'participate' in its affairs. Id. at 179, 113 S.Ct.
1163. Further, the 'operation or management' test does not limit RICO
liability to upper management because 'an enterprise is 'operated' not just
by upper management but also by lower-rung participants in the enterprise
who are under the direction of upper management.' Id. at 184, 113 S.Ct.
1163. In so holding, the Court made clear that RICO liability may extend to
those who do not hold a managerial position within an enterprise, but who
do nonetheless knowingly further the illegal aims of the enterprise by
carrying out the directives of those in control.
Summary
The "operation or management" test from Reves v. Ernst & Young is used to
determine RICO liability. This test does not require a formal managerial
position within the enterprise but extends liability to those who knowingly
further the illegal aims of the enterprise. The passage supports the
proposition by indicating that both Morgan and Daniel's active participation
in the fraudulent scheme could satisfy the "operation or management"
requirement for RICO liability, as they were integral to carrying out the
enterprise's activities.
Reyes v. Netdeposit, LLC, 802 F.3d 469 (3rd Cir. 2015)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Third Circuit
Extract
Reyes seeks to represent a class that may include tens of thousands of
claimants with potential civil RICO claims arising from the defendants'
operation of a sham enterprise. 'Establishing liability under [§ 1962(c) ] of
the RICO statute requires (1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a
pattern (4) of racketeering activity, plus an injury to business or property.' In
re Ins. Brokerage Antitrust Litig., 579 F.3d 241, 269 (3d Cir.2009) (internal
quotation marks and citations omitted). ... If accepted, the District Court
may conclude that this evidence supports a finding that there was a single
fraudulent RICO enterprise, that each defendant participated in that
enterprise, and that all members of the proposed class were damaged in the
amount of the funds debited from their bank accounts pursuant to the
fraudulent scheme.
Summary
Elements required to establish liability under the RICO statute, which
includes conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity.
The passage also suggests that evidence of participation in a fraudulent
enterprise can support a finding of liability. This aligns with the proposition
that Morgan and Daniel's active participation in the fraudulent scheme
demonstrates their operation and management of the enterprise's affairs,
satisfying the RICO element.

Tabas v. Tabas, 47 F.3d 1280 (3rd Cir. 1995)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Third Circuit
Extract
The RICO statute provides for civil damages for 'any person injured in his
business or property by reason of a violation of [18 U.S.C. Sec. 1962].' 18
U.S.C. Sec. 1964(c). A common thread running throughout Sec. 1962 is that
an injured party must demonstrate that the defendant was engaged in a
'pattern of racketeering activity.' ... Moreover, the Supreme Court has
confined the scope of RICO by limiting the persons who can be liable under
18 U.S.C. Sec. 1962(c). See Reves v. Ernst & Young, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct.
1163, 122 L.Ed.2d 525 (1993).
Summary
Requirements for a RICO violation, emphasizing the need for a "pattern of
racketeering activity" and referencing the Reves v. Ernst & Young decision,
which limits liability to those involved in the operation or management of
the enterprise. This directly supports the proposition that both Morgan and
Daniel's active participation in the fraudulent scheme could satisfy the RICO
liability requirements, as their actions demonstrate involvement in the
operation and management of the enterprise's affairs.
In re Insurance Brokerage Antitrust Litig., 618 F.3d 300 (3rd Cir. 2010)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Third Circuit
Extract
Mere association with an enterprise does not violate § 1962(c). To be liable
under this provision, a defendant must “conduct or participate, directly or
indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of
racketeering activity.” 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). The Supreme Court has held that
the “conduct or participate” element requires a defendant to “have some
part in directing those affairs.” Reves v. Ernst & Young, 507 U.S. 170, 179,
113 S.Ct. 1163, 122 L.Ed.2d 525 (1993). More precisely, “one is not liable
under [§ 1962(c) ] unless one has participated in the operation or
management of the enterprise itself.” Id. at 183, 113 S.Ct. 1163.
Summary
Mere association with an enterprise is insufficient; active participation in
directing the enterprise's affairs is required. This supports the proposition
that Morgan and Daniel's active roles in planning, funding, and executing
the fraudulent scheme demonstrate their operation and management of the
enterprise's affairs, satisfying the RICO element.

Laurel Gardens LLC v. McKenna, 23-2649 (3rd Cir. Jun 28, 2024)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Third Circuit
Extract
RICO recognizes liability for those who merely aid and abet the underlying
predicate offenses. Banks v. Wolk, 918 F.2d 418, 421 (3d Cir. 1990). [T]o find
a defendant liable for aiding and abetting a predicate act under RICO, the
plaintiff must prove (1) that the substantive act has been committed, and (2)
that the defendant alleged to have aided and abetted the act knew of the
commission of the act and acted with intent to facilitate it.
Summary
RICO liability can extend to those who aid and abet the commission of
predicate offenses. This means that even if Morgan and Daniel were not the
primary actors, their active participation in planning, funding, and executing
the fraudulent scheme could satisfy the RICO requirement of participating
in the operation or management of the enterprise’s affairs. The passage
supports the idea that knowing and intentional facilitation of the scheme is
sufficient for RICO liability.
Argiro v. Lamancusa, 23-1820 (3rd Cir. Apr 03, 2024)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Third Circuit
Extract
To plead a RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), a plaintiff 'must allege (1)
conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity.' ... Predicate acts are related if they 'have the same or similar
purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of commission, or
otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not
isolated events.' ... First, there must be an 'enterprise' as defined in the
statute. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4). Second, the crimes alleged in the complaint
must qualify as 'racketeering activity.' Id. § 1961(1). Third, the complaint
must allege that Lamancusa had a sufficient role in the operation or
management of the enterprise to support RICO liability. See Reves, 507 U.S.
at 183.
Summary
Elements required to establish a RICO claim, which include conduct of an
enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. It emphasizes the need
for related predicate acts and the defendant's role in the operation or
management of the enterprise, as established in Reves v. Ernst & Young.
This directly supports the proposition that Morgan and Daniel's active

participation in the fraudulent scheme demonstrates their operation and
management of the enterprise's affairs, satisfying the RICO element.
Hlista v. Safeguard Props., LLC, No. 15-1812 (3rd Cir. May 05, 2016)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Third Circuit
Extract
A plaintiff bringing a substantive RICO claim under § 1962(c) must allege
'(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity.' In re Ins. Brokerage Antitrust Litig., 618 F.3d 300, 362 (3d Cir.
2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). A pattern of racketeering activity
'requires at least two acts of racketeering activity within a ten-year period.'
Id. (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5)); see Banks v. Wolk, 918 F.2d 418, 421 (3d
Cir. 1990) ('[N]o defendant can be liable under RICO unless he participated
in two or more predicate offenses sufficient to constitute a pattern.').
Summary
Elements required to establish a RICO claim under § 1962(c), which includes
conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. The
requirement of at least two acts of racketeering activity within a ten-year
period is crucial to establish a pattern. This supports the proposition that
Morgan and Daniel's actions, if they include multiple acts of racketeering,
could satisfy the RICO requirements. Their active participation in the
fraudulent scheme aligns with the conduct of an enterprise through a
pattern of racketeering activity.
U.S. v. Riccobene, 709 F.2d 214 (3rd Cir. 1983)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Third Circuit
Extract
In order to obtain a conviction under RICO, the government must show not
only that a defendant participated in the operation of a single enterprise, but
also that he did so 'through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of
unlawful debt.' 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1962(c). A pattern is established by proof that
the defendant committed two or more predicate offenses--specified illegal
acts, prohibited by either state or federal law--which are often associated
with organized crime.
Summary
For a RICO conviction, it is necessary to demonstrate that a defendant
participated in the operation of an enterprise through a pattern of
racketeering activity. This aligns with the proposition that Morgan and

Daniel's active participation in the fraudulent scheme demonstrates their
operation and management of the enterprise's affairs, satisfying the RICO
element.
U.S. v. Boffa, 688 F.2d 919 (3rd Cir. 1982)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Third Circuit
Extract
Section 1962(c) of the Act provides: It shall be unlawful for any person
employed by or associated with an enterprise engaged in, or the activities of
which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate,
directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a
pattern of racketeering activity. Section 1962(d) makes it unlawful for any
person to conspire to violate section 1962(c). ... To be convicted as a
member of an enterprise conspiracy, an individual, by his words or actions,
must have objectively manifested an agreement to participate, directly or
indirectly, in the affairs of an enterprise through the commission of two or
more predicate crimes.
Summary
Requirements for a RICO violation, specifically under sections 1962(c) and
1962(d), which include participating in the conduct of an enterprise's affairs
through a pattern of racketeering activity. It also emphasizes that an
individual must have manifested an agreement to participate in the
enterprise's affairs through predicate crimes. This supports the proposition
that Morgan and Daniel's active participation in the fraudulent scheme
could satisfy the RICO requirements, as their actions could be seen as
conducting or participating in the enterprise's affairs through racketeering
activity.
United States v. Ferriero, 866 F.3d 107 (3rd Cir. 2017)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Third Circuit
Extract
Next, Ferriero challenges his RICO conviction by attacking the sufficiency of
the evidence supporting 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c)'s 'nexus' element. Section
1962(c) makes it unlawful 'to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in
the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering
activity.' ... The nexus element requires proving a sufficiently close
relationship between the defendant, his involvement in the enterprise's
affairs, and the pattern of racketeering. ... We reiterate Insurance
Brokerage's statement that racketeering must be one means by which the
defendant participates in the conduct of the enterprise's affairs. As noted,

=== PAGE 16 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
we believe there was sufficient evidence for a rational juror to conclude
Ferriero participated in the conduct of the BCDO's affairs by means of a
pattern of bribery.
Summary
The court in United States v. Ferriero affirmed the RICO conviction by
emphasizing the importance of the nexus element, which requires a close
relationship between the defendant's involvement in the enterprise's affairs
and the pattern of racketeering. This supports the proposition that Morgan
and Daniel's active participation in the fraudulent scheme could satisfy the
RICO requirement of participating in the operation or management of the
enterprise's affairs.
U.S. v. Philip Morris Usa, Inc., 327 F.Supp.2d 13 (D. D.C. 2004)
U.S. District Court — District of Columbia
Extract
In response, Defendants cite Reves v. Ernst & Young, 507 U.S. 170, 185, 113
S.Ct. 1163, 122 L.Ed.2d 525 (1993), claiming that it requires a showing of
'operation or management of the enterprise' to demonstrate a RICO
conspiracy under Section 1962(d). Even though the Supreme Court did hold
in Reves that, to 'conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct
of such enterprise's affairs, one must participate in the operation or
management of the enterprise itself,' Defendants' argument fails for the
following reasons. Thus, Reves' 'operation or management' standard applies
only to substantive RICO offenses under Section 1962(c) and not to a
conspiracy to violate RICO under Section 1962(d).
Summary
This requirement does not extend to RICO conspiracy under Section
1962(d), which only requires an agreement to further the criminal endeavor.
However, the proposition is about substantive RICO liability under Section
1962(c), which aligns with the Reves standard.
In re Ins. Brokerage Antitrust Litigation, 579 F.3d 241 (3rd Cir. 2009)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Third Circuit
Extract
The RICO statute provides, in relevant part: 'It shall be unlawful for any
person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the
activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or
participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs

through a pattern of racketeering activity....' 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c).
Establishing liability under this section of the RICO statute 'requires (1)
conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity,' plus an injury to 'business or property.' Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex
Co., 473 U.S. 479, 496 (1985) (footnote omitted); see Lum v. Bank of Am.,
361 F.3d 217, 223 (3d Cir.2004).
Summary
The passage outlines the elements required to establish a RICO violation,
which includes conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering
activity. This directly relates to the proposition that Morgan and Daniel's
actions demonstrate their participation in the operation and management of
the enterprise's affairs, as required by RICO. The passage supports the idea
that their active involvement in the fraudulent scheme could satisfy the
conduct element of a RICO claim.
18 U.S.C. § 1962 18 U.S.C. § 1962 Prohibited Activities
Extract
It shall be unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any
enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign
commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of
such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity or
collection of unlawful debt.
Summary
The passage explicitly states that it is unlawful for any person associated
with an enterprise to conduct or participate in the conduct of the
enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity. This aligns
with the proposition that Morgan and Daniel's active participation in the
fraudulent scheme demonstrates their involvement in the operation and
management of the enterprise's affairs, which is a requirement for RICO
liability.
Chapter 4. Elements of Cause of Action
Civil RICO: A Definitive Guide. Fifth Edition - American Bar

Extract
The late Chief Judge Becker of the Third Circuit properly observed that,
when an organizational entity is involved, it is important to bear in mind the
directive of Reves v. Ernst & Young, 507 U.S. 170, 183 (1993), that the
defendant must be involved in the operation and management of the

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
enterprise... In Reves v. Ernst & Young, 507 U.S. 170, 183 (1993), the
Supreme Court declared that there is no liability under § 1962(c) 'unless one
has participated in the operation or management of the enterprise itself.'
Summary
The Reves v. Ernst & Young decision is a key authority in determining
liability under RICO. It establishes that a defendant must participate in the
operation or management of the enterprise to be held liable. The passage
emphasizes the importance of this requirement and its application in RICO
cases.
Chapter 3. Standing
Civil RICO: A Definitive Guide. Fifth Edition - American Bar
Association - Gregory P. Joseph
Extract
In Reves v. Ernst & Young, 507 U.S. 170, 183 (1993), the Supreme Court
interpreted the requirement that a defendant 'conduct or participate,
directly or indirectly, in the conduct of [the] enterprise’s affairs,'... In order
to 'participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise’s
affairs,' one must have some part in directing those affairs. Of course, the
word 'participate' makes clear that RICO liability is not limited to those with
primary responsibility for the enterprise’s affairs, just as the phrase 'directly
or indirectly' makes clear that RICO liability is not limited to those with a
formal position in the enterprise, but some part in directing the enterprise’s
affairs is required.
Summary
RICO liability is not limited to those with primary responsibility or formal
positions, but rather includes those who participate in directing the
enterprise's affairs, directly or indirectly. This supports the proposition that
Morgan and Daniel's active participation in the fraudulent scheme could
satisfy the operation-and-management requirement under RICO.

Extract
Among the other elements the plaintiff must prove to establish RICO liability
on the part of the defendant are that the defendant was employed by or

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
associated with the enterprise and conducted or participated in the conduct
of the affairs of the enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. In
this regard, you must find that the defendant participated in the operation
or management of the enterprise itself and was involved in the alleged
unlawful activities. To participate in the operation or management of an
enterprise, a defendant must have had some part in directing the
enterprise’s affairs. A defendant need not be a member of upper
management to satisfy this requirement but may be a lower rung participant
in the enterprise who acted under the direction of upper management.
Summary
Requirements for establishing RICO liability, specifically the need for a
defendant to participate in the operation or management of the enterprise's
affairs. It clarifies that a defendant does not need to be in upper
management but can be a lower-level participant who directs the
enterprise's affairs. This supports the proposition that both Morgan and
Daniel, through their active participation in the fraudulent scheme, satisfy
the RICO requirement of participating in the operation or management of
the enterprise.

Extract
Reves v. Ernst & Young, 507 U.S. 170, 183 (1993) (holding that RICO
defendants must have participated in the “operation or management” of the
enterprise); Baisch v. Gallina, 346 F.3d 366, 376 (2d Cir. 2003) (citing Reves,
507 U.S. at 179); ... RICO liability is not limited to those with primary
responsibility for the enterprise’s affairs (quoting Reves v. Ernst & Young,
507 U.S. 170, 179 (1993)); ... United States v. Fowler, 535 F.3d 408, 418 (6th
Cir. 2008) (concluding that “knowingly carrying out the decisions of his
superiors” within the criminal enterprise qualifies as “operation or
management” under Reves).
Summary
The passages from the American Criminal Law Review provide a legal basis
for understanding the "operation or management" test under RICO, as
established in Reves v. Ernst & Young. The cited cases illustrate that RICO
liability extends beyond those with primary responsibility to include
individuals who actively participate in the enterprise's affairs, even if they
are not at the top of the hierarchy. This supports the proposition that both
Morgan and Daniel's actions in planning, funding, and executing the scheme
could satisfy the RICO requirement of participating in the operation or
management of the enterprise.

RACKETEER INFLUENCED AND CORRUPT ORGANIZATIONS
American Criminal Law Review - Georgetown University Law Center -
2021-07-01
Extract
In Reves v. Ernst & Young, the Supreme Court held that the nexus between a
pattern of racketeering activity and the enterprise exists only when the
defendant participates in the management or operation of the enterprise.
The defendant does not need a primary responsibility nor a formal position
within the enterprise to participate in its affairs; however, 'some part in
directing the enterprise’s affairs is required.'
Summary
This does not require a formal position or primary responsibility, but rather
some part in directing the enterprise's affairs. This supports the proposition
that Morgan and Daniel's active participation in the fraudulent scheme
could satisfy the RICO requirement of participating in the operation or
management of the enterprise.

Blakey, G. Robert - 2013-04-01
Extract
Reves v. Ernst & Young, 507 U.S. 170, 177-86 (1993), established that
'conduct' meant some part in the 'operation or management' of the
enterprise's affairs. Compare Slaney, 244 F.3d at 598 (holding that person
charged with violating RICO must have participated in the operation or
management of the enterprise and must have asserted some control over the
enterprise), and Viola, 35 F.3d at 43 (excluding an unwitting janitor/
handyman), with Aetna Casualty Sur. Co., 43 F.3d at 1559 (holding that
causing insurance payments to be made is included in 'operation').
Summary
The Reves v. Ernst & Young decision is a key authority in determining what
constitutes "operation or management" of an enterprise under RICO. The
passage highlights that participation in the operation or management of an
enterprise's affairs is necessary for RICO liability. The examples provided,
such as causing insurance payments to be made, illustrate actions that can
be considered part of the operation or management. This supports the
proposition that Morgan and Daniel's actions in planning, funding, and

executing the fraudulent scheme could satisfy the RICO requirement of
participating in the operation or management of the enterprise.

Extract
the 'operation or management' of the enterprise is not to merely support or
encourage, that is, aid and abet, the affairs of the enterprise, but requires
some participation in the operation or management of its affairs...
'Outsiders' may be liable under Section 1962(c) if they are 'associated with'
an enterprise and participate in the conduct of its affairs--that is, participate
in the operation or management of the enterprise itself... The terms
'conduct' and 'participate in the affairs' of an enterprise means [sic] the
performance of acts, functions, or duties that are necessary or helpful to the
operation of the enterprise.
Summary
Even those without primary responsibility can be liable if they perform acts
necessary or helpful to the enterprise's operation. This supports the
proposition that Morgan and Daniel's active roles in the fraudulent scheme
could satisfy the RICO requirement of participating in the enterprise's
affairs.
Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy
The Brief - American Bar Association - 2024-01-01
Extract
A violation of § 1962(c), the section on which Sedima relies, requires (1)
conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity. The plaintiff must allege each of the elements to state a claim. They
are all equally essential components, and the complaint will fail if any one of
them is not adequately pleaded. In particular, RICO claims based on mail or
wire fraud must comport with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b)’s
requirement that allegations involving fraud be pleaded with particularity.
The practitioner through their pleadings must articulate with great care and
attention a viable racketeering claim.

Summary
To establish a RICO claim under § 1962(c), a plaintiff must prove conduct of
an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. The passage
emphasizes the need for particularity in pleading fraud-related RICO claims,
which aligns with the proposition that Morgan and Daniel's actions
demonstrate their operation and management of the enterprise's affairs.
Their active participation in the fraudulent scheme can be seen as conduct
of the enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity.
Insurance Fraud is a Violent Crime.

Extract
RICO conspiracy was established by proof of: (a) of an agreement to join a
racketeering scheme, (b) of the defendant's knowing engagement in the
scheme with the intent that its overall goals be effectuated, and (c) that the
scheme involved, or by agreement between any members of the conspiracy
was intended to involve, two or more predicate acts of racketeering.
Summary
Elements necessary to establish a RICO conspiracy, which includes an
agreement to join a racketeering scheme, knowing engagement in the
scheme with intent to achieve its goals, and involvement in two or more
predicate acts of racketeering. This supports the proposition that Morgan
and Daniel's active participation in the fraudulent scheme demonstrates
their operation and management of the enterprise's affairs, as they would
have had to agree to join the scheme, engage in it knowingly, and commit
predicate acts, which aligns with the requirements for RICO liability.
