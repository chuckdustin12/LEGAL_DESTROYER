Question
What can be done when in texas the state courts in texas were submitted
fraudulent documents orchestrated by a scheme between a wife, her
grandmother, and her stepfather, and these actions included the wife
transferring money across state lines to the stepdad, traveling to his house
after he deceived the husband into believing he wanted to help him, then
made knowingly false claims of indigency, abuse and harassment to gain the
house and kids, and it worked, and the husband wants to sue in oklahoma
where the acts occurred and while the divorce is ongoing but just pursue
rico damages
Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
The husband may have grounds for a civil RICO claim in federal district
court in Oklahoma based on the alleged fraudulent scheme involving
interstate transfer of money and false claims, provided he can establish the
required elements of a RICO violation. To succeed, he will need to
demonstrate (1) the existence of persons who engaged in (2) a pattern of
racketeering activity (involving at least two predicate acts such as mail/wire
fraud) (3) connected to an enterprise affecting interstate commerce, and (4)
that he suffered injury to his business or property as a result.
Summary
The husband may have grounds to pursue a civil action under the Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act in federal district court in
Oklahoma while the Texas divorce proceedings are ongoing. The alleged
conduct—involving the wife, grandmother, and stepfather engaging in a
scheme that included transferring money across state lines, deceptive
practices, and submitting fraudulent documents to state courts—potentially
constitutes a "pattern of racketeering activity" connected to an "enterprise"
as required under RICO. If successful, the husband could recover treble
damages, costs, and attorney's fees.
To establish a viable RICO claim, the husband must demonstrate several key
elements: (1) the existence of persons who engaged in (2) a pattern of
racketeering activity involving at least two predicate acts such as mail fraud
or wire fraud, (3) connected to an enterprise affecting interstate commerce,
and (4) that he suffered injury to his business or property as a result of the
RICO violation. The interstate transfers of money and travel between states
in furtherance of the alleged scheme may provide the necessary nexus to
interstate commerce required for a RICO claim, though the husband will
need to meet the heightened pleading requirements for fraud under Federal
Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b).

Relevant Law
RICO Statutory Framework
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), enacted as
Title IX of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970, provides both criminal
penalties and civil remedies for racketeering activities conducted through
an enterprise. While originally intended to combat organized crime, RICO
has been applied to a variety of situations involving patterns of illegal
activity.
The key statutory provisions relevant to the husband's potential civil RICO
claim include:
1. Definition of Racketeering Activity
Under 18 U.S.C. § 1961, "racketeering activity" encompasses a wide range of
predicate acts, including:
Mail fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1341)
Wire fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343)
Interstate travel in aid of racketeering enterprises (18 U.S.C. § 1952)
Engaging in monetary transactions involving property derived from
specified unlawful activity (18 U.S.C. § 1957)
The statute defines a "pattern of racketeering activity" as requiring "at least
two acts of racketeering activity, one of which occurred after the effective
date of this chapter and the last of which occurred within ten years
(excluding any period of imprisonment) after the commission of a prior act
of racketeering activity" (18 U.S.C. § 1961).
2. Prohibited Activities
18 U.S.C. § 1962 outlines the prohibited activities under RICO, including:
Using income derived from a pattern of racketeering activity to acquire
an interest in an enterprise (§ 1962(a))
Acquiring or maintaining an interest in an enterprise through a pattern
of racketeering activity (§ 1962(b))
Conducting the affairs of an enterprise through a pattern of
racketeering activity (§ 1962(c))
Conspiring to violate any of the above provisions (§ 1962(d))
The statute specifically prohibits "any person through a pattern of
racketeering activity or through collection of an unlawful debt to acquire or
maintain, directly or indirectly, any interest in or control of any enterprise
which is engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign
commerce" (18 U.S.C. § 1962).

3. Civil Remedies
18 U.S.C. § 1964 provides for civil remedies, stating:
"Any person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of
section 1962 of this chapter may sue therefor in any appropriate United
States district court and shall recover threefold the damages he sustains and
the cost of the suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee."
This provision creates a private right of action for individuals who have
suffered injury to their business or property due to RICO violations, allowing
them to sue in federal district court and recover treble damages, costs, and
attorney's fees.
4. Predicate Acts Relevant to the Husband's Case
Several specific statutes may be relevant as predicate acts for the husband's
potential RICO claim:
18 U.S.C. § 1341 (Mail Fraud) prohibits using the postal service or any
private interstate carrier to execute "any scheme or artifice to defraud, or
for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses,
representations, or promises."
18 U.S.C. § 1343 (Wire Fraud) similarly prohibits using wire, radio, or
television communications in interstate commerce to execute a scheme to
defraud.
18 U.S.C. § 1952 addresses interstate travel in aid of racketeering
enterprises, making it unlawful to travel in interstate commerce or use
facilities in interstate commerce with intent to "distribute the proceeds of
any unlawful activity" or "otherwise promote, manage, establish, carry on, or
facilitate the promotion, management, establishment, or carrying on, of any
unlawful activity."
18 U.S.C. § 1957 criminalizes engaging in monetary transactions in property
derived from specified unlawful activity, specifically transactions exceeding
$10,000.
Case Law Interpretation of RICO Requirements
Federal courts have interpreted the requirements for establishing a civil
RICO claim. In Bustos v. Invierte En Tex., 4:22-CV-02690 (S.D. Tex. Jun 03,
2024), the court explained that "RICO claims based on allegations of fraud,
such as wire or mail fraud, are subject to the heightened pleading burden
imposed by Rule 9(b)." The court also noted that "Congress enacted RICO in
order to prohibit conduct involving a pattern of racketeering activity" and
that one of RICO's enforcement mechanisms is "a private right of action,
available to '[a]ny person injured in his business or property by reason of a
violation' of RICO's substantive restrictions."
The court in State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Punjwani, CIVIL ACTION NO.
H-19-1491 (S.D. Tex. Dec 31, 2019) outlined the three common elements of

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
RICO claims under 18 U.S.C. § 1962: "(1) a person who engages in (2) a
pattern of racketeering activity, (3) connected to the acquisition,
establishment, conduct, or control of an enterprise." The court further
explained that "A pattern of racketeering activity consists of two or more
predicate criminal acts that are (1) related and (2) amount to or pose a
threat of continued criminal activity."
Also significant, the court explained that "RICO claims based on predicate
acts of fraud are subject to the heightened pleading requirements of Rule
9(b)," which requires parties to "state with particularity the circumstances
constituting fraud or mistake." To meet this standard, a plaintiff should
"specify the statements contended to be fraudulent, identify the speaker,
state when and where the statements were made, and explain why the
statements were fraudulent" (State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Punjwani,
CIVIL ACTION NO. H-19-1491 (S.D. Tex. Dec 31, 2019)).
In Heden v. Hill, 937 F.Supp. 1230 (S.D. Tex. 1996), the court discussed the
legislative history and purpose of RICO, noting that it was enacted "to
combat organized crime through both criminal prosecutions and private
actions." The court emphasized that a private right of action is provided
under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c), allowing "[a]ny person injured in his business or
property by reason of a violation of section 1962" to sue in federal district
court and recover treble damages and attorney's fees.
Similarly, Bonton v. Archer Chrysler Plymouth, Inc., 889 F.Supp. 995 (S.D.
Tex. 1995) confirmed that RICO provides a private right of action under 18
U.S.C. § 1964(c), allowing injured persons to sue in an appropriate U.S.
district court and recover threefold damages and attorney's fees.
Additional guidance comes from Cedra Pharmacy Houston, LLC v.
UnitedHealth Grp., Inc., CIVIL ACTION NO. H-17-3800 (S.D. Tex. Mar 07,
2019), which reiterated that all civil RICO claims require allegations and
proof of "1) a person who engages in 2) a pattern of racketeering activity 3)
[which is] connected to the acquisition, establishment, conduct or control of
an enterprise."
Allstate Ins. Co. v. Benhamou, 190 F.Supp.3d 631 (S.D. Tex. 2016) further
clarified that regardless of which specific RICO provision a claim is brought
under, "three threshold elements must be met: (1) a person who engages in
(2) a pattern of racketeering activity (3) connected to the acquisition,
establishment, conduct, or control of an enterprise."
In Trevino v. Pechero, 592 F.Supp.2d 939 (S.D. Tex. 2008), the court
highlighted that "RICO requires a showing that (1) a person that engages in
(2) a pattern of racketeering activity, (3) connected to the acquisition,
establishment, conduct, or control of an enterprise." Importantly, the court
noted that "Because RICO is a federal statute, the racketeering must have at
least a minimal nexus with interstate commerce."
Mitchell Energy Corp. v. Martin, 616 F.Supp. 924 (S.D. Tex. 1985) addressed
the requirement of showing an injury "by reason of § 1962," noting that
some courts have adopted a requirement that plaintiffs must establish a
"racketeering injury" to have a cause of action under RICO. However, the

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
court clarified that the Fifth Circuit (which includes Texas and Oklahoma)
has rejected this requirement, meaning that a plaintiff does not need to
demonstrate a specific "racketeering injury" beyond the predicate acts.
Secondary Materials on RICO Claims
Secondary materials provide additional insights into the application and
requirements of RICO claims. According to Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy, "a
violation of § 1962(c)... requires (1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through
a pattern (4) of racketeering activity." The source emphasizes that "They are
all equally essential components, and the complaint will fail if any one of
them is not adequately pleaded."
Particularly relevant to the husband's case, the source notes that "RICO
claims based on mail or wire fraud must comport with Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 9(b)'s requirement that allegations involving fraud be pleaded
with particularity." It also explains that "to state a civil RICO claim, a
plaintiff must allege (1) two or more predicate racketeering offenses, (2) the
existence of an enterprise affecting interstate commerce, (3) a connection
between the racketeering offenses, and (4) an injury by reason of the
above."
RICO: A Primer provides that "RICO provides for a civil action against
persons engaged in a 'pattern of racketeering activity' or 'collection of an
unlawful debt.' A successful plaintiff may recover treble damages, costs, and
attorneys' fees." It defines a RICO enterprise broadly as "any individual,
partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or
group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity," noting
that courts have interpreted "enterprise" to capture both legitimate and
illegitimate enterprises.
The source further explains that a "pattern" may exist "where any
combination of two or more offenses occurred within a period of time," and
that a plaintiff may demonstrate a pattern by establishing that the predicate
acts pose a threat of continued criminal activity, generally demonstrated by
showing either:
"Closed-ended continuity. Proving 'a series of related predicate acts
extending over a substantial period of time.'"
"Open-ended continuity. A threat of 'continuing criminal activity
extending indefinitely into the future,' in light of the nature of the
enterprise and predicate acts alleged."
Defending Civil RICO Claims: A Defense Plan Should Be In Every Business's
Arsenal emphasizes that "RICO is not a simple statute. It pertains to conduct
associated with an 'enterprise' and 'a pattern racketeering activity.'" It
highlights that "to prove most types of RICO claims, the plaintiff must plead
that the defendant committed some qualifying criminal action, the most
common of which is mail, wire or securities fraud." Additionally, "the plaintiff
must plead a pattern of racketeering activity for most RICO claims. If the
alleged conduct occurred once or twice, or was not continuous, it cannot
form a pattern of conduct sufficient to support a RICO claim." Importantly
•

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
for the husband's case, the source notes that "a RICO claim cannot exist
without some nexus to interstate commerce. If the alleged conduct does not
affect interstate commerce, it must be dismissed."
Analysis of the Husband's Potential RICO
Claim
Existence of Persons Engaged in a Pattern of Racketeering
Activity
The husband alleges a scheme involving his wife, her grandmother, and her
stepfather to submit fraudulent documents to Texas state courts and make
false claims of indigency, abuse, and harassment to gain the house and
custody of the children. To establish a RICO claim, the husband must first
demonstrate that these individuals engaged in a "pattern of racketeering
activity."
Under 18 U.S.C. § 1961, a "pattern of racketeering activity" requires at least
two acts of racketeering activity within a ten-year period. The alleged acts
that might qualify as "racketeering activity" include:
Wire Fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343): The wife's transfer of money across
state lines to the stepfather could potentially constitute wire fraud if it
was part of a scheme to defraud. 18 U.S.C. § 1343 prohibits "having
devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for
obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses,
representations, or promises, transmits or causes to be transmitted by
means of wire... in interstate or foreign commerce, any writings, signs,
signals, pictures, or sounds for the purpose of executing such scheme
or artifice."
Mail Fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1341): If the alleged fraudulent documents
were submitted to Texas state courts via mail, this could constitute mail
fraud. 18 U.S.C. § 1341 prohibits using the mail for executing a scheme
to defraud or for obtaining money or property by means of false
representations.
Interstate Travel in Aid of Racketeering (18 U.S.C. § 1952): The
wife's travel to the stepfather's house after allegedly deceiving the
husband could potentially fall under this statute if it was undertaken
with the intent to "promote, manage, establish, carry on, or facilitate"
unlawful activity.
Monetary Transactions in Property Derived from Specified
Unlawful Activity (18 U.S.C. § 1957): If the money transferred across
state lines was derived from unlawful activity and exceeded $10,000,
this could constitute another predicate act under RICO.
To establish these acts as part of a pattern, they must be both "related" and
"amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity" (State Farm Mut.
Auto. Ins. Co. v. Punjwani, CIVIL ACTION NO. H-19-1491 (S.D. Tex. Dec 31,
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
2019)). The acts would likely be deemed related if they had "similar
purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of commission" (RICO: A
Primer).
The continuity requirement could be satisfied by showing either:
"Closed-ended continuity" - a series of related predicate acts over a
substantial period of time
"Open-ended continuity" - a threat of continuing criminal activity
extending into the future
Given that the alleged scheme resulted in the wife gaining the house and
custody of the children, the husband might argue that the acts were part of
an ongoing pattern designed to deprive him of his property and parental
rights.
Connection to an Enterprise Affecting Interstate
Commerce
The next element the husband must establish is the existence of an
"enterprise" and its connection to the pattern of racketeering activity. RICO
defines an enterprise broadly to include "any individual, partnership,
corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of
individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity" (18 U.S.C. § 1961).
In this case, the enterprise could be characterized as an association-in-fact
consisting of the wife, grandmother, and stepfather who allegedly worked
together to orchestrate the fraudulent scheme. As noted in RICO: A Primer,
courts have interpreted "enterprise" broadly to capture both legitimate and
illegitimate enterprises.
To satisfy the interstate commerce requirement, the husband would need to
demonstrate that the enterprise's activities had "at least a minimal nexus
with interstate commerce" (Trevino v. Pechero, 592 F.Supp.2d 939 (S.D. Tex.
2008)). The transfer of money across state lines and the wife's travel
between states would likely satisfy this requirement, as these activities
directly involve interstate commerce.
Injury to Business or Property
The husband must also demonstrate that he was "injured in his business or
property by reason of a violation of section 1962" (18 U.S.C. § 1964(c)). The
loss of his house as a result of the alleged fraudulent scheme would likely
qualify as an injury to property. The issue of losing custody of his children,
however, might not qualify as an injury to "business or property" under
RICO, as courts generally interpret this requirement to refer to economic
injuries.
Pleading Requirements
If the husband decides to pursue a civil RICO claim, he must be aware of the
heightened pleading requirements for fraud allegations. As stated in State
• 
• 

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Punjwani, CIVIL ACTION NO. H-19-1491 (S.D.
Tex. Dec 31, 2019), "RICO claims based on predicate acts of fraud are
subject to the heightened pleading requirements of Rule 9(b)," which
requires parties to "state with particularity the circumstances constituting
fraud or mistake."
This means the husband would need to "specify the statements contended to
be fraudulent, identify the speaker, state when and where the statements
were made, and explain why the statements were fraudulent." He would
need to provide specific details about the allegedly fraudulent documents
submitted to the Texas courts, the false claims of indigency, abuse, and
harassment, and how these fraudulent acts were part of a scheme
orchestrated by the wife, grandmother, and stepfather.
Venue and Jurisdiction
The husband wants to sue in Oklahoma "where the acts occurred." Under 18
U.S.C. § 1964(c), a person injured by a RICO violation "may sue therefor in
any appropriate United States district court." This means the husband could
potentially file his RICO claim in a federal district court in Oklahoma if some
of the predicate acts occurred there.
The fact that divorce proceedings are ongoing in Texas raises potential
complications. While there is no explicit prohibition against pursuing a RICO
claim while divorce proceedings are pending in another state, there may be
practical and legal considerations, such as:
Abstention Doctrines: Federal courts may abstain from exercising
jurisdiction over matters closely related to pending state court
proceedings, particularly in domestic relations cases.
Domestic Relations Exception: Federal courts generally avoid
interfering in domestic relations matters, which are traditionally the
domain of state courts.
Rooker-Feldman Doctrine: If the husband is essentially seeking to
appeal or overturn a state court judgment, federal courts may lack
jurisdiction under the Rooker-Feldman doctrine.
However, if the husband's RICO claim is focused solely on damages resulting
from the alleged fraudulent scheme, rather than attempting to modify the
custody or property determinations made by the Texas court, he may be able
to proceed with his federal claim.
Potential Challenges and Limitations
The husband's potential RICO claim faces several challenges and limitations:
1. 
2. 
3. 

=== PAGE 9 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
1. Heightened Pleading Standard
As previously discussed, RICO claims based on fraud are subject to the
heightened pleading requirements of Rule 9(b). The husband would need to
plead the alleged fraud with particularity, which may be difficult if he lacks
access to specific evidence of the fraudulent scheme.
2. Proving a Pattern of Racketeering Activity
The husband would need to establish at least two predicate acts that
constitute a pattern of racketeering activity. This would require showing that
the acts were related and demonstrated either closed-ended or open-ended
continuity. A single scheme with a narrow purpose and a limited number of
participants might not satisfy this requirement.
3. Demonstrating an Enterprise
While the definition of "enterprise" is broad, the husband would still need to
demonstrate that the wife, grandmother, and stepfather constituted an
"association-in-fact" with a common purpose and some degree of
organizational structure or decision-making mechanism.
4. Causation
The husband must establish that his injury was "by reason of" the RICO
violation, meaning there must be a direct causal connection between the
racketeering activity and his loss of property.
5. Domestic Relations Implications
Courts may be reluctant to entertain what could be perceived as an attempt
to circumvent or collaterally attack state court proceedings in domestic
relations matters.
Conclusion
Based on the provided legal materials, the husband may have grounds for a
civil RICO claim if he can establish that the wife, grandmother, and
stepfather engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity connected to an
enterprise that affected interstate commerce, and that he suffered injury to
his property as a result.
The interstate transfer of money, the wife's travel across state lines, and the
submission of allegedly fraudulent documents to Texas courts could
potentially constitute predicate acts under RICO, such as wire fraud, mail
fraud, interstate travel in aid of racketeering, and monetary transactions in
property derived from specified unlawful activity.
To succeed, the husband would need to file his claim in an appropriate
federal district court, likely in Oklahoma if that's where some of the

=== PAGE 10 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
predicate acts occurred. He would need to plead the alleged fraud with
particularity, as required by Rule 9(b), and establish all the elements of a
RICO violation: (1) persons who engaged in (2) a pattern of racketeering
activity (3) connected to an enterprise affecting interstate commerce,
resulting in (4) injury to his business or property.
If successful, the husband could recover treble damages, costs, and
attorney's fees under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c). However, he should be aware of
the challenges and limitations discussed above, including the potential
reluctance of federal courts to intervene in matters related to ongoing state
domestic relations proceedings.
Given these complexities, the husband would be well-advised to consult with
an attorney experienced in both RICO litigation and family law to assess the
viability of his claim and develop a strategic approach that addresses the
potential legal and practical challenges.
Legal Authorities
Mitchell Energy Corp. v. Martin, 616 F.Supp. 924 (S.D. Tex. 1985)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of Texas
Extract
Defendants attack Plaintiff's causes of action under the Racketeer
Influenced Corrupt Organization Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1961 et seq, ("RICO") and
for common law fraud. The Court will discuss each attack individually...
Defendants' next RICO argument concerns the scope of § 1962. Defendants
claim that Plaintiffs' Complaint does not satisfy the requirements of showing
an injury "by reason of § 1962." Specifically, Defendants note that some
courts have adopted a requirement that plaintiffs pressing a RICO claim
must establish a so-called "racketeering injury" in order to have a cause of
action under the statute... Moreover, the imposition of a racketeering injury
requirement is a means to an end which the Fifth Circuit has rejected... The
Court has examined the Complaint in the instant case and determined that it
satisfies Rule 9(b). The Complaint specifies a period of time during which
the alleged frauds were perpetrated... and the parties involved in the fraud,
the Defendants.
Summary
Requirements for a RICO claim, specifically addressing the argument that a
"racketeering injury" must be shown. The Fifth Circuit has rejected this
requirement, meaning that a plaintiff does not need to demonstrate a
specific "racketeering injury" beyond the predicate acts. This is relevant to
the husband's potential RICO claim, as it suggests that he may not need to
prove a separate racketeering injury beyond the fraudulent acts themselves.
The passage also emphasizes the importance of pleading fraud with
particularity, as required by Rule 9(b), which is relevant to the husband's
case if he pursues a RICO claim.

RICO requires a showing that (1) a person that engages in (2) a pattern of
racketeering activity, (3) connected to the acquisition, establishment,
conduct, or control of an enterprise. Crowe v. Henry, 43 F.3d 198, 204 (5th

commerce. R.A.G.S. Couture, Inc. v. Hyatt, 774 F.2d 1350, 1353 (5th Cir.
1985).
Summary
To pursue RICO damages, the husband must demonstrate that the wife,
grandmother, and stepfather engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity
connected to an enterprise. The passage highlights the necessity of showing
a pattern of racketeering activity and a connection to an enterprise, as well
as the requirement for a minimal nexus with interstate commerce, which is
relevant given the interstate transfer of money. This information is generally
applicable to RICO claims in the Fifth Circuit, which includes Texas.

Summary
Elements required to establish a RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962, which
includes demonstrating a pattern of racketeering activity connected to an
enterprise. It also highlights the necessity of meeting the heightened
pleading requirements for fraud under Rule 9(b), which requires specificity
in detailing the fraudulent acts. This information is directly relevant to the
husband's intention to pursue RICO damages, as it provides the legal

U.S.C. § 1962(a), (b), (c), or (d), and 2) injury to business or property as a
result of such violation. 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c) ('Any person injured in his
business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962 of this chapter
may sue therefor in any appropriate United States district court. .. ').

Summary
General framework for what is required to establish a civil RICO claim,
which is relevant to the husband's intention to sue for RICO damages.
Heden v. Hill, 937 F.Supp. 1230 (S.D. Tex. 1996)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of Texas
Extract
In 1970, Congress enacted RICO as Title IX of the Organized Crime Control
Act to combat organized crime through both criminal prosecutions and
private actions. See 18 U.S.C. § 1961 et seq. The 'legislative history
forcefully supports the view that the major purpose of Title IX is to address
the infiltration of legitimate business by organized crime.' United States v.
Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 591, 101 S.Ct. 2524, 2532, 69 L.Ed.2d 246 (1981). A
private right of action is provided under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c), which states in
pertinent part: Any person injured in his business or property by reason of a
violation of section 1962 of this chapter may sue therefor in any appropriate
United States district court and shall recover threefold the damages he
sustains and the cost of the suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee.
Summary
The RICO statute provides a private right of action for individuals injured in
their business or property due to a violation of section 1962. This means that
if the husband's claims can be framed as a RICO violation, he may have the
right to sue in a U.S. district court for damages, including treble damages
and attorney's fees. The passage also highlights the necessity of proving a
pattern of racketeering activity, which includes acts like mail and wire fraud.
Bustos v. Invierte En Tex., 4:22-CV-02690 (S.D. Tex. Jun 03, 2024)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of Texas
Extract
RICO claims based on allegations of fraud, such as wire or mail fraud, are
subject to the heightened pleading burden imposed by Rule 9(b).” Indeed,
that flaw was fatal not just to RICO but to nearly every claim. ... “Congress
enacted RICO in order to prohibit conduct involving a pattern of

=== PAGE 14 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
racketeering activity.” ... “One of RICO's enforcement mechanisms is a
private right of action, available to ‘[a]ny person injured in his business or
property by reason of a violation' of the RICO's substantive restrictions.” ...
To state a civil RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962, a plaintiff must allege
three common elements: “(1) a person who engages in (2) a pattern of
racketeering activity, (3) connected to the acquisition, establishment,
conduct, or control of an enterprise.” ... An act of “racketeering activity,”
commonly referred to as a “predicate act,” is defined to include certain
criminal acts, including mail and wire fraud, and any act indictable under
the Immigration and Nationality Act.
Summary
Framework for understanding the elements required to establish a civil
RICO claim, which is relevant to the husband's intention to sue for RICO
damages.
Allstate Ins. Co. v. Benhamou, 190 F.Supp.3d 631 (S.D. Tex. 2016)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of Texas
Extract
There are four substantive RICO violations set out in § 1962. 18 U.S.C. §
1962(a) -(d). The elements required to state a claim vary according to the
particular RICO claim asserted. Elliot v. Foufas, 867 F.2d 877, 880 (5th Cir.
1989). However, regardless of what section a claim is brought under, three
threshold elements must be met: (1) a person who engages in (2) a pattern
of racketeering activity (3) connected to the acquisition, establishment,
conduct, or control of an enterprise. Delta Truck &amp; Tractor, Inc. v. J.I.
Case Co., 855 F.2d 241, 242 (5th Cir.1988) (emphasis in original). Assuming
that all three of these elements are met, the court may then continue to the
substantive requirements of each respective subsection.
Summary
Threshold elements required for a RICO claim, which are applicable to the
husband's situation if he can demonstrate these elements in his case.
18 U.S.C. § 1961 18 U.S.C. § 1961 Definitions
Extract
As used in this chapter- 'racketeering activity' means (A) any act or threat
involving murder, kidnapping, gambling, arson, robbery, bribery, extortion,
dealing in obscene matter, or dealing in a controlled substance or listed
chemical (as defined in section 102 of the Controlled Substances Act), which
is chargeable under State law and punishable by imprisonment for more

than one year; (B) any act which is indictable under any of the following
provisions of title 18, United States Code: ... section 1341 (relating to mail
fraud), section 1343 (relating to wire fraud), ... section 1952 (relating to
racketeering), ... section 1956 (relating to the laundering of monetary
instruments), section 1957 (relating to engaging in monetary transactions in
property derived from specified unlawful activity), ... 'pattern of
racketeering activity' requires at least two acts of racketeering activity, one
of which occurred after the effective date of this chapter and the last of
which occurred within ten years (excluding any period of imprisonment)
after the commission of a prior act of racketeering activity;
Summary
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act defines
"racketeering activity" to include acts such as mail fraud, wire fraud, and
money laundering, which are relevant to the husband's situation. The
passage also explains that a "pattern of racketeering activity" requires at
least two acts of racketeering within a ten-year period. This information is
crucial for determining whether the husband's case can be pursued under
RICO in Oklahoma, as it involves fraudulent activities and interstate
transactions.
18 U.S.C. § 1962 18 U.S.C. § 1962 Prohibited Activities
Extract
It shall be unlawful for any person through a pattern of racketeering activity
or through collection of an unlawful debt to acquire or maintain, directly or
indirectly, any interest in or control of any enterprise which is engaged in, or
the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce.
Summary
18 U.S.C. § 1962 addresses unlawful activities related to racketeering.
Specifically, it prohibits acquiring or maintaining any interest in an
enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity that affects interstate
commerce. This is relevant to the question as the husband's situation
involves alleged fraudulent activities and interstate transactions, which
could potentially be considered racketeering under this statute.
18 U.S.C. § 1964 18 U.S.C. § 1964 Civil Remedies
Extract
Any person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of
section 1962 of this chapter may sue therefor in any appropriate United
States district court and shall recover threefold the damages he sustains and
the cost of the suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee...

Summary
Under 18 U.S.C. § 1964, individuals who have been injured in their business
or property due to a violation of section 1962 (RICO violations) can file a
lawsuit in a U.S. district court. They are entitled to recover three times the
damages they sustained, along with the costs of the suit and reasonable
attorney's fees. This provision is applicable to cases involving racketeering
activities, which may include the fraudulent actions described in the
question.
18 U.S.C. § 1343 18 U.S.C. § 1343 Fraud By Wire, Radio, Or Television
Extract
Whoever, having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to
defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent
pretenses, representations, or promises, transmits or causes to be
transmitted by means of wire, radio, or television communication in
interstate or foreign commerce, any writings, signs, signals, pictures, or
sounds for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice, shall be fined
under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both.
Summary
18 U.S.C. § 1343 addresses schemes to defraud using wire communications
in interstate commerce. This statute could potentially apply to the situation
described if the fraudulent scheme involved wire communications across
state lines, such as transferring money or making false claims. The statute
provides for fines and imprisonment for those found guilty of such offenses.
The husband's situation, involving interstate transfer of money and
potentially fraudulent claims, could fall under this statute if wire
communications were used in the scheme.
18 U.S.C. § 1952 18 U.S.C. § 1952 Interstate and Foreign Travel Or
Transportation In Aid of Racketeering Enterprises
Extract
Whoever travels in interstate or foreign commerce or uses the mail or any
facility in interstate or foreign commerce, with intent to- distribute the
proceeds of any unlawful activity; or commit any crime of violence to further
any unlawful activity; or otherwise promote, manage, establish, carry on, or
facilitate the promotion, management, establishment, or carrying on, of any
unlawful activity, and thereafter performs or attempts to perform- (A) an act
described in paragraph or shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not
more than 5 years, or both; or (B) an act described in paragraph shall be
fined under this title, imprisoned for not more than 20 years, or both, and if
death results shall be imprisoned for any term of years or for life.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
18 U.S.C. § 1952 addresses the use of interstate or foreign commerce to
facilitate unlawful activities, which can include racketeering. The statute
provides for penalties, including fines and imprisonment, for those who
engage in such activities. This is relevant to the question as it involves the
wife transferring money across state lines, which could be considered an
unlawful activity under this statute.
18 U.S.C. § 1957 18 U.S.C. § 1957 Engaging In Monetary Transactions In
Property Derived From Specified Unlawful Activity
Extract
Whoever, in any of the circumstances set forth in subsection (d), knowingly
engages or attempts to engage in a monetary transaction in criminally
derived property of a value greater than $10,000 and is derived from
specified unlawful activity, shall be punished as provided in subsection
(b). ... In a prosecution for an offense under this section, the Government is
not required to prove the defendant knew that the offense from which the
criminally derived property was derived was specified unlawful activity.
Summary
18 U.S.C. § 1957 addresses the criminal liability for engaging in monetary
transactions involving property derived from unlawful activities. This statute
could be relevant to the husband's situation if the wife's transfer of money
across state lines involved criminally derived property. The statute does not
require the government to prove that the defendant knew the property was
derived from unlawful activity, which could simplify the prosecution's
burden of proof. This could potentially support a RICO claim if the
fraudulent scheme involved racketeering activities.
18 U.S.C. § 1341 18 U.S.C. § 1341 Frauds and Swindles
Extract
Whoever, having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to
defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent
pretenses, representations, or promises, ... for the purpose of executing
such scheme or artifice or attempting so to do, places in any post office or
authorized depository for mail matter, any matter or thing whatever to be
sent or delivered by the Postal Service, or deposits or causes to be deposited
any matter or thing whatever to be sent or delivered by any private or
commercial interstate carrier, ... shall be fined under this title or imprisoned
not more than 20 years, or both.

=== PAGE 18 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
18 U.S.C. § 1341 addresses schemes to defraud using mail or interstate
carriers. The husband's situation involves fraudulent actions that may have
included the use of interstate carriers, which could potentially fall under this
statute. The statute provides for fines and imprisonment for those found
guilty of such offenses.
18 U.S.C. § 1963 18 U.S.C. § 1963 Criminal Penalties
Extract
Whoever violates any provision of section 1962 of this chapter shall be fined
under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years (or for life if the
violation is based on a racketeering activity for which the maximum penalty
includes life imprisonment), or both, and shall forfeit to the United States,
irrespective of any provision of State law... any property constituting, or
derived from, any proceeds which the person obtained, directly or indirectly,
from racketeering activity or unlawful debt collection in violation of section
1962.
Summary
The passage outlines the penalties for violating section 1962, which includes
engaging in racketeering activities. It specifies that violators can face fines,
imprisonment, and forfeiture of property obtained through racketeering.
This is relevant to the question as it provides a legal basis for pursuing RICO
damages if the actions described fall under racketeering activities as defined
by section 1962.
Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy
The Brief - American Bar Association - 2024-01-01
Extract
A violation of § 1962(c), the section on which Sedima relies, requires (1)
conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity. The plaintiff must allege each of the elements to state a claim. They
are all equally essential components, and the complaint will fail if any one of
them is not adequately pleaded. In particular, RICO claims based on mail or
wire fraud must comport with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b)’s
requirement that allegations involving fraud be pleaded with particularity.
The practitioner through their pleadings must articulate with great care and
attention a viable racketeering... RICO’s prohibitions may be enforced in
both criminal and civil contexts. In the context of a civil action, a plaintiff
must be directly injured by reason of the defendant’s racketeering activities.
Proximate cause, as an aspect of RICO’s “by reason of ” standard, requires a

=== PAGE 19 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
RICO plaintiff to show that the defendant’s racketeering offenses led directly
to the plaintiff ’s injuries. RICO creates a private cause of action under 18
U.S.C. § 1964(c). To state a civil RICO claim, a plaintiff must allege (1) two or
more predicate racketeering offenses, (2) the existence of an enterprise
affecting interstate commerce, (3) a connection between the racketeering
offenses, and (4) an injury by reason of the above.
Summary
Framework for understanding how to structure a civil RICO claim, which is
relevant to the husband's situation if he believes the fraudulent actions meet
these criteria.

APPLICATION OF PRESUMPTION AGAINST EXTRATERRITORIALITY IN
FEDERAL STATUTES WITH STATE PREDICATES - UNITED STATES V.
PEREZ.
Suffolk Transnational Law Review - Suffolk University Law School -
Callahan, Kathleen - 2021-01-01
Extract
The Court formalized a two-step framework for analyzing the extraterritorial
application of a statute (1) the presumption against extraterritoriality can
only be rebutted if the statute provides a clear indication that Congress
intended it to apply abroad, and (2) if there is no indication of
extraterritoriality, the conduct in the case must evidence a domestic
application of the statute. Regarding RICO specifically, the Court held that
the racketeering statute may have extraterritorial effect, 'but only to the
extent that the predicates alleged in a particular case themselves apply
extraterritoriality.'
Summary
Framework for understanding how RICO can be applied to conduct that
crosses state or national borders, which is relevant to the husband's
situation.
RICO: A Primer
Extract
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) was
enacted in 1970. Although RICO provides for both civil remedies and
criminal penalties, the number of civil RICO claims far outstrips the number
of criminal RICO cases brought each year. RICO provides for a civil action
against persons engaged in a 'pattern of racketeering activity' or 'collection

of an unlawful debt.' A successful plaintiff may recover treble damages,
costs, and attorneys' fees. ... A RICO enterprise includes 'any individual,
partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or
group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.' Courts
have interpreted 'enterprise' broadly, and the definition captures both
legitimate and illegitimate enterprises. ... A 'pattern' may exist where any
combination of two or more offenses occurred within a period of time. ... A
plaintiff may demonstrate a pattern by establishment that the predicate acts
pose a threat of continued criminal activity, which is generally demonstrated
by showing either: * Closed-ended continuity. Proving 'a series of related
predicate acts extending over a substantial period of time.' * Open-ended
continuity. A threat of 'continuing criminal activity extending indefinitely
into the future,' in light of the nature of the enterprise and predicate acts
alleged.
Summary
The RICO Act allows for civil action against individuals engaged in a pattern
of racketeering activity. The definition of an enterprise under RICO is broad
and can include both legitimate and illegitimate entities. To establish a RICO
claim, a plaintiff must demonstrate a pattern of racketeering activity, which
can be shown through either closed-ended or open-ended continuity. This
information is relevant to the husband's situation as he may be able to
pursue a RICO claim if he can demonstrate that the wife's actions, along
with her grandmother and stepfather, constitute a pattern of racketeering
activity.

within a period of time. ... There are four separate and distinct RICO
violations set out in section 1962: (a) acquiring or operating an enterprise
using racketeering proceeds; (b) controlling an enterprise using
racketeering activities; (c) conducting the affairs of an enterprise using
racketeering activities; and (d) conspiring to so acquire, control, or conduct.
Summary
Elements necessary to establish a RICO claim, including the existence of an
enterprise and a pattern of racketeering activity. The passage also explains

constitute racketeering activity under RICO.
Defending Civil RICO Claims: A Defense Plan Should Be In Every Business's
Arsenal
Extract
Congress passed the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act
(RICO), 18 U.S.C. Sections 1961-68, over 51 years ago with the intent to
close the gap in the criminal prosecution of organized crime. ... Civil RICO
actions are now ubiquitous, so much so that plaintiffs often attempt to apply
the statute to situations that bear little resemblance to the criminal
racketeering activity animating the enactment of the statute in the first
place. ... RICO is not a simple statute. It pertains to conduct associated with
an 'enterprise' and 'a pattern racketeering activity.' An enterprise is an
individual or legal entity, or a union or group of individuals associated in fact
although not a legal entity, while a pattern of racketeering activity requires
long-term, organized conduct to violate state and federal laws. ... Second, to
prove most types of RICO claims, the plaintiff must plead that the defendant
committed some qualifying criminal action, the most common of which is
mail, wire or securities fraud. ... Third, the plaintiff must plead a pattern of
racketeering activity for most RICO claims. If the alleged conduct occurred
once or twice, or was not continuous, it cannot form a pattern of conduct
sufficient to support a RICO claim. ... Fifth, a RICO claim cannot exist
without some nexus to interstate commerce. If the alleged conduct does not
affect interstate commerce, it must be dismissed.
Summary
N overview of the requirements for a civil RICO claim, which includes
proving a pattern of racketeering activity, a qualifying criminal action, and a
nexus to interstate commerce. These elements are crucial for the husband to
consider if he wishes to pursue RICO damages in Oklahoma. The passage
also highlights the complexity of RICO claims and the necessity of meeting
specific legal criteria, which may be relevant to the husband's situation.

long-term, organized conduct to violate state and federal laws. There are
four types of activities outlawed by RICO, and claims under Section 1962(c)
are the most commonly asserted: * Section 1962(a) prohibits a person from
investing in an enterprise any income derived from a pattern of racketeering
activity; * Section 1962(b) prohibits a person from using a pattern of
racketeering activity to acquire or maintain control over an enterprise; *
Section 1962(c) prohibits a person from conducting the affairs of an
enterprise through a pattern of racketeering; and * Section 1962(d)
prohibits a person from conspiring to violate Sections 1962(a), (b), or (c).
Summary
Types of activities prohibited under RICO, which include using a pattern of
racketeering to conduct or control an enterprise. This information is
relevant to the question as it provides insight into the legal framework
under which the husband might pursue RICO damages for the alleged
fraudulent scheme.
