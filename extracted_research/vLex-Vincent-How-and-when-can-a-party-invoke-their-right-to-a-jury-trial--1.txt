Question
How and when can a party invoke their right to a jury trial?
Answer (Texas)
Short response
A party can invoke their right to a jury trial by making a timely, written
request and paying the required jury fee in accordance with procedural
rules—typically at least thirty days before the trial date in civil cases, and by
not waiving the right in criminal cases. Failure to comply with these
requirements or to object when the court proceeds without a jury may result
in waiver of the right.
Summary
In Texas, the right to a jury trial is constitutionally protected in both civil
and criminal cases, but it is not self-executing in civil matters. To invoke this
right in a civil case, a party must file a written request and pay the jury fee
within the time limits set by the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, most
commonly at least thirty days before the trial date; in criminal cases, the
right is automatic unless expressly and properly waived.
The process for invoking the right to a jury trial is strictly regulated by
statute and case law, and courts have discretion to deny a jury trial if the
procedural requirements are not met or if granting a late request would
disrupt the proceedings or prejudice the opposing party. In both civil and
criminal contexts, a party’s failure to act affirmatively—such as by not
objecting to a bench trial after perfecting the right—can result in waiver,
making timely and clear assertion of the right essential.
Background and Relevant Law
Constitutional and Statutory Framework
The right to a jury trial in Texas is enshrined in both the Texas Constitution
and the United States Constitution. Article I, Section 15 of the Texas
Constitution provides that the right to trial by jury shall remain inviolate,
and Article V, Section 10 further specifies that in district courts, either party
may have a jury trial upon application and payment of a jury fee, subject to
legislative exceptions and procedural rules (Weng Ong v. Guzman,
05-22-00505-CV (Tex. App. Apr 26, 2023); State v. Credit Bureau of Laredo,
Inc., 530 S.W.2d 288 (Tex. 1975)).
In criminal cases, the right to a jury trial is guaranteed by the Sixth
Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and by the Texas Constitution. The
Texas Code of Criminal Procedure further codifies this right, with specific

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
provisions for waiver in non-capital cases (Chavez v. State; Hall v. State, 39
S.W.3d 316).
Civil Cases: Procedural Requirements
The right to a jury trial in civil cases is not automatic; it must be invoked and
perfected by compliance with procedural requirements. The principal
authority is Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 216, which provides that no jury
trial shall be had unless a written request is filed with the clerk a reasonable
time before the trial date, but not less than thirty days in advance, and the
jury fee is paid within the same period (In re R.D.B., 14-23-00409-CV (Tex.
App. Jul 02, 2024); In re Maness, 05-21-00465-CV (Tex. App. Nov 19, 2021); 
Brosseau v. Ranzau, 81 S.W.3d 381 (Tex. App. 2002)).
A request made before the thirty-day deadline is presumed to be reasonable,
but this presumption can be rebutted if granting a jury trial would injure the
adverse party, disrupt the court’s docket, or impede the ordinary handling of
the court’s business (Halsell v. Dehoyos, 810 S.W.2d 371 (Tex. 1991); 
Barkhausen v. Craycom, Inc., 178 S.W.3d 413 (Tex. 2005)). The fee must be
paid at the time of the request, and the clerk must promptly note the
payment on the docket (First Bankers Ins. Co. v. Lockwood, 417 S.W.2d 738
(Tex. Ct. App. 1967)).
If a party has perfected the right to a jury trial but the court proceeds
without a jury, the party must object on the record or affirmatively indicate
the intention to stand on the perfected right; failure to do so constitutes
waiver (Fox v. Oak; Green v. W. E. Grace Mfg. Co., 422 S.W.2d 723 (Tex.
1968)).
Criminal Cases: Invocation and Waiver
In criminal cases, the right to a jury trial is absolute unless waived. For non-
capital felonies, waiver must be made in person, in writing, in open court,
and with the consent of both the court and the state’s attorney (Chavez v.
State; Hall v. State, 39 S.W.3d 316). In misdemeanor cases, waiver does not
require a written statement and may be accomplished orally in open court,
typically by announcing ready and entering a plea before the judge
(Samudio v. State, 648 S.W.2d 312 (Tex. Crim. App. 1983); State v. Welch,
810 S.W.2d 13 (Tex. App. 1991)).
A defendant’s waiver of the right to a jury trial must be voluntary, knowing,
and intelligent, and the record must affirmatively show this. If challenged,
the state bears the burden of proving the waiver was valid (Chavez v. State).

Analysis
Civil Cases
How to Invoke the Right
To invoke the right to a jury trial in a Texas civil case, a party must:
File a Written Request: The party must file a written request for a
jury trial with the clerk of the court. This request must be made a
reasonable time before the trial date, but in any event, not less than
thirty days before the trial is set on the non-jury docket (In re R.D.B.,
14-23-00409-CV (Tex. App. Jul 02, 2024); General Motors Corp. v.
Gayle, 951 S.W.2d 469 (Tex. 1997)).
Pay the Jury Fee: The party must pay the required jury fee at the time
of the request. The amount is set by statute and must be deposited with
the clerk within the same time frame as the request (Brosseau v.
Ranzau, 81 S.W.3d 381 (Tex. App. 2002); Cardenas v. Montfort, Inc.,
894 S.W.2d 406 (Tex. App. 1994)).
Presumption of Timeliness: If the request and fee are submitted
more than thirty days before trial, they are presumed timely. However,
the opposing party may rebut this presumption by showing that
granting a jury trial would cause injury, disrupt the docket, or impede
the court’s business (Halsell v. Dehoyos, 810 S.W.2d 371 (Tex. 1991)).
Object if Necessary: If the court proceeds to trial without a jury after
the right has been perfected, the party must object on the record or
otherwise affirmatively indicate the intention to stand on the right.
Failure to do so waives the right (Fox v. Oak; Green v. W. E. Grace Mfg.
Co., 422 S.W.2d 723 (Tex. 1968)).
When to Invoke the Right
The request and fee must be submitted at least thirty days before the trial
date. Requests made after this deadline are untimely, and the court has
discretion to deny them. However, courts may grant untimely requests if
doing so does not interfere with the court’s schedule, delay the trial, or
prejudice the opposing party (Barkhausen v. Craycom, Inc., 178 S.W.3d 413
(Tex. 2005); Monroe v. Alternatives in Motion, 234 S.W.3d 56 (Tex. App.
2007)).
If a party receives late notice of a trial setting, making it impossible to
comply with the thirty-day requirement, the court may consider this in
determining whether to grant a jury trial ($2,424.21 in U.S. Currency v.
State, No. 02-18-00303-CV (Tex. App. Jul 18, 2019)).

Special Contexts
Partition Suits: In partition actions, a party dissatisfied with the
commissioners’ report may file objections within thirty days of the
report’s filing and demand a jury trial on those objections (Redden v.
Hickey, 308 S.W.2d 225 (Tex. App. 1957); Sand Point Ranch, Ltd. v.
Smith, 363 S.W.3d 268 (Tex. App. 2012)).
Family Law: The same procedural requirements apply, and requests
should be made well in advance of the trial date (Hector L. Rodriguez v.
Rodriguez).
Criminal Cases
How to Invoke the Right
In criminal cases, the right to a jury trial is automatic unless waived. The
default is that the case will be tried to a jury unless the defendant waives
this right in accordance with statutory requirements (Chavez v. State; 
Pretrial Motions).
Waiver of the Right
Felony Cases (Non-Capital): Waiver must be made in person, in
writing, in open court, and with the consent of both the court and the
state’s attorney (Chavez v. State; Hall v. State, 39 S.W.3d 316).
Misdemeanor Cases: Waiver does not require a written statement and
may be accomplished orally in open court, typically by announcing
ready and entering a plea before the judge (Samudio v. State, 648 S.W.
2d 312 (Tex. Crim. App. 1983); State v. Welch, 810 S.W.2d 13 (Tex. App.
1991)).
A waiver must be voluntary, knowing, and intelligent, and the record must
affirmatively show this. If the voluntariness of the waiver is challenged, the
state must prove its validity (Chavez v. State).
When to Invoke or Waive
The right is invoked by default unless the defendant waives it at the time of
entering a plea. In capital felony cases where the state seeks the death
penalty, the right cannot be waived (Chavez v. State; Trial motions).
Consequences of Non-Appearance
If a party fails to appear at trial, as in parental rights termination cases, the
court may proceed with a bench trial, and the right to a jury trial may be
deemed waived by absence, especially if counsel does not object (In re D.L.).

Exceptions and Caveats
Untimely Requests: Courts have discretion to grant untimely jury
demands if doing so does not disrupt the docket, delay the trial, or
prejudice the opposing party (Barkhausen v. Craycom, Inc., 178 S.W.3d
413 (Tex. 2005)).
Waiver by Inaction: Even after perfecting the right, a party may waive
it by failing to object when the court proceeds without a jury (Fox v.
Oak).
Criminal Waiver Requirements: In felony cases, strict compliance
with waiver requirements is necessary; in misdemeanor cases, oral
waiver is sufficient (Samudio v. State, 648 S.W.2d 312 (Tex. Crim. App.
1983)).
Constitutional Limitations: The right to a jury trial is preserved only
for those actions in which it existed at common law at the time the
Texas Constitution was adopted (State v. Credit Bureau of Laredo, Inc.,
530 S.W.2d 288 (Tex. 1975)).
Conclusion
A party in Texas can invoke their right to a jury trial by timely filing a
written request and paying the required fee—at least thirty days before trial
in civil cases—and by not waiving the right in criminal cases. Strict
compliance with procedural requirements is essential, as failure to act
affirmatively or to object when the court proceeds without a jury may result
in waiver. In criminal cases, the right is automatic unless properly waived,
with more stringent requirements for waiver in felony cases. Courts retain
discretion to grant untimely requests if no prejudice or disruption results,
but the safest course is always to comply strictly with the rules and to assert
the right clearly and promptly.
Legal Authorities
Samudio v. State, 648 S.W.2d 312 (Tex. Crim. App. 1983)
Texas Court of Criminal Appeals
Extract
As the Court of Appeals correctly observed, a defendant in a misdemeanor
case has the same right to a trial by jury as a defendant charged with a
felony. Franklin v. State, 576 S.W.2d 621 (Tex.Cr.App.1978). Under Art. 1.13,
V.A.C.C.P., a defendant charged with a felony less than capital may waive his
right to jury trial, but the waiver must be made in person by the defendant
in writing in open court with the consent of the court and the State. Waiver
of jury trial in misdemeanor cases is not governed by statute and does not
have to be in writing. Lamb v. State, 409 S.W.2d 418 (Tex.Cr.App.1966).

Summary
The passage provides insight into the right to a jury trial in Texas, indicating
that both misdemeanor and felony defendants have the right to a jury trial.
It also explains the conditions under which a defendant can waive this right,
particularly noting the requirements for waiver in felony cases and the lack
of statutory requirements for waiver in misdemeanor cases.
State v. Welch, 810 S.W.2d 13 (Tex. App. 1991)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
By its terms, article 1.13 applies only to 'a felony less than capital.' That
statute does not apply to a misdemeanor case such as this, and a written
waiver of jury trials is not required in such cases. Schultze v. State, 626 S.W.
2d 89 (Tex.App.--Corpus Christi 1981, pet. ref'd). In this case, both the
docket sheet and the court's order recite that appellee waived a jury trial.
That oral waiver, coupled with appellee's announcement of ready and plea
before the court was sufficient to waive his right to jury trial. See Lamb v.
State, 409 S.W.2d 418, 420 (Tex.Crim.App.1966).
Summary
In Texas, article 1.13, which requires a written waiver of jury trials, applies
only to felonies less than capital. In misdemeanor cases, a written waiver is
not necessary. An oral waiver, along with an announcement of readiness and
a plea before the court, is sufficient to waive the right to a jury trial. This
suggests that the right to a jury trial can be waived orally in misdemeanor
cases, and the timing of invoking or waiving this right is linked to the plea
and readiness announcement.
Barkhausen v. Craycom, Inc., 178 S.W.3d 413 (Tex. 2005)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
A request for a jury trial nonetheless must be filed 'a reasonable time before
the date set for trial of the cause of the non-jury docket, but not less than
thirty days in advance.' TEX.R. CIV. P. 216(a). Even if a party fails to timely
pay the jury fee, however, Texas courts have held that a trial court 'should
accord the right to jury trial if it can be done without interfering with the
court's docket, delaying the trial, or injuring the opposing party.'

Summary
The passage from the Barkhausen v. Craycom, Inc. case provides guidance
on the procedural requirements for invoking the right to a jury trial in Texas.
According to Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 216(a), a request for a jury trial
must be filed at least thirty days before the trial date. However, even if the
jury fee is not paid on time, the court may still grant a jury trial if it does not
disrupt the court's schedule, delay the trial, or prejudice the opposing party.
This indicates that while there is a strict timeline, there is also some
flexibility based on the circumstances.
McDaniel v. Yarbrough, 898 S.W.2d 251 (Tex. 1995)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
Denial of the constitutional right to trial by jury constitutes reversible error.
See Heflin v. Wilson, 297 S.W.2d 864, 866 (Tex.Civ.App.--Beaumont 1956,
writ ref'd). Depriving the McDaniels of a full jury of twelve members, absent
an exception authorized by the constitution or applicable rules, is a denial of
the right to jury trial guaranteed by the Texas Constitution. The trial court
abused its discretion in dismissing Seals as 'disabled from sitting' because it
was clear error to apply that provision in the absence of some physical or
mental disability.
Summary
The passage highlights the importance of the constitutional right to a jury
trial in Texas, emphasizing that any denial of this right constitutes reversible
error. It underscores that a full jury of twelve members is required unless an
exception is authorized by the constitution or applicable rules. The case
specifically addresses the improper dismissal of a juror, which led to a
violation of this right. This indicates that a party can invoke their right to a
jury trial by ensuring that the jury is properly constituted according to
constitutional and procedural rules.
Medley v. State, 47 S.W.3d 17 (Tex. App. 2000)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The Court of Criminal Appeals has held that, even for constitutional claims,
generally, a party seeking to change the status quo bears the burden of
showing facts entitling him to relief. Marquez, 921 S.W.2d at 222. And, a
criminal defendant who waives an absolute right and seeks to reclaim that
right occupies the status of one seeking to change the status quo. Id. at 223

(waiver of jury trial). If the evidence presented by a defendant seeking to
reclaim a right previously waived is rebutted by the State, the trial court, or
the record, then the trial court does not abuse its discretion in refusing to
allow the right to be reclaimed. Id.
Summary
In Texas, a party who has previously waived their right to a jury trial and
seeks to reclaim it must demonstrate facts entitling them to relief. This is
because they are attempting to change the status quo. If the evidence they
present is rebutted by the State, the trial court, or the record, the trial court
does not abuse its discretion in refusing to allow the right to be reclaimed.
This indicates that the right to a jury trial can be invoked or reclaimed if it
was previously waived, but the party must meet certain evidentiary
requirements.
$2,424.21 in U.S. Currency v. State, No. 02-18-00303-CV (Tex. App. Jul 18,
2019)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
There are many consequences to the failure to give sufficient notice of a trial
setting—the inability to request a jury, the inability to have the matter heard
by the trial judge instead of the magistrate, and the inability to secure
discovery through the rules of civil procedure. The first of these, the
inability to timely request a jury, occurred in Bell Helicopter. There, the
notice of the trial setting made it impossible for Bell, after receiving notice
of the setting, to comply with the time limit for paying a jury fee under Rule
216. Bell Helicopter Textron, 863 S.W.2d at 141; see Tex. R. Civ. P. 216. In
reversing the trial court's judgment and remanding for new trial, the court
noted that Rule 245 was amended in order to harmonize it with Rule 216
and to require notice of a trial setting before the time for demanding a jury.
Summary
In Texas, a party must comply with Rule 216 of the Texas Rules of Civil
Procedure to timely request a jury trial. This involves paying a jury fee
within a specific time frame after receiving notice of the trial setting. The
passage also highlights the importance of receiving sufficient notice of the
trial setting to allow a party to comply with this requirement. Rule 245 was
amended to ensure that notice of a trial setting is given before the time for
demanding a jury, thus harmonizing it with Rule 216.

Texas Supreme Court
Extract
Appellants contend that the dismissal violated their right to jury trial under
the Texas Constitution. However, the right to trial by jury found in the Texas
Constitution does not apply to frivolous lawsuits. See Black, 82 S.W.3d at 55;
Schorp v. Baptist Meml. Health Sys., 5 S.W.3d 727, 737-38 (Tex. App.-San
Antonio 1999, no pet.).
Summary
While the Texas Constitution provides a right to a jury trial, this right does
not extend to frivolous lawsuits. This suggests that a party can invoke their
right to a jury trial in Texas unless the lawsuit is deemed frivolous. The
context of the passage is a legal decision by the Texas Supreme Court, which
provides authoritative guidance on the application of the Texas Constitution
in this regard.
Halsell v. Dehoyos, 810 S.W.2d 371 (Tex. 1991)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
Under our rules, a request for a jury trial must be filed 'a reasonable time
before the date set for trial of the cause on the non-jury docket, but not less
than thirty days in advance.' Tex.R.Civ.P. 216. A request in advance of the
thirty-day deadline is presumed to have been made a reasonable time before
trial. See Wittie v. Skees, 786 S.W.2d 464, 466 (Tex.App.--Houston [14th
Dist.] 1990, writ denied). The adverse party may rebut that presumption by
showing that the granting of a jury trial would operate to injure the adverse
party, disrupt the court's docket, or impede the ordinary handling of the
court's business. Id.
Summary
The passage provides specific guidance on the timing requirements for
requesting a jury trial in Texas. It states that a request must be made at
least thirty days before the trial date, and if made within this timeframe, it is
presumed reasonable. However, this presumption can be challenged if the
opposing party can demonstrate potential harm or disruption.
State v. Credit Bureau of Laredo, Inc., 530 S.W.2d 288 (Tex. 1975)
Texas Supreme Court

=== PAGE 10 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
The question presented is whether the Texas Constitution gives a right to
trial by jury in this suit for civil penalties brought pursuant to the Texas
Deceptive Trade Practices Act... The Texas Constitution contains two
separate provisions regarding the right of trial by jury. The first is Article I,
Section 15, found in the Bill of Rights of the Constitution; the second is
Article V, Section 10, contained in the Judiciary Article... Article I, Section
15, contains a jury provision similar to that found in the United States
Constitution and every other state constitution. It states simply that 'the
right of trial by jury shall remain inviolate... In our opinion the Bill of Rights
Article preserved the right to a trial by jury in a suit for the collection of civil
penalties... Sec. 15. The right of trial by jury shall remain inviolate... § 10.
Trial by jury Sec. 10. In the trial of all causes in the District Courts, the
plaintiff or defendant shall, upon application made in open court, have the
right of trial by jury; but no jury shall be empaneled in any civil case unless
demanded by a party to the case, and a jury fee be paid by the party
demanding a jury, for such sum, and with such exceptions as may be
prescribed by the Legislature.
Summary
The passage provides insight into the constitutional basis for the right to a
jury trial in Texas, specifically under Article I, Section 15, and Article V,
Section 10. It explains that the right to a jury trial is preserved for cases
where it existed at the time the Constitution was adopted and outlines the
procedural requirements for invoking this right, such as making an
application in open court and paying a jury fee.
Green v. W. E. Grace Mfg. Co., 422 S.W.2d 723 (Tex. 1968)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
When one party demands a jury and timely pays the jury fee, is the right to a
jury trial thus secured to the adverse party under Texas Rules of Civil
Procedure, rule 220? ... 'When any party has paid the fee for a jury trial, he
shall not be permitted to withdraw the cause from the jury docket Over the
objection of the parties adversely interested. If so permitted, the court in its
discretion may by an order permit him to withdraw also his jury fee deposit.
* * * (Emphasis added).' ... It is clear then that the inviolate right to a jury
trial is regulated by those Rules which specify its availability. In 1947 Rule
220 was changed from requiring Consent of the adverse party to the
withdrawal to requiring the interposition of an objection to the removal. The
effect of this change is that the non-demanding party is no longer assured a
jury trial by virtue of the request and payment by his adversary. The Rule
now requires that some affirmative action be taken by all parties to insure
themselves a jury trial. Thus, until an objection is registered to the
withdrawal of a case from the jury docket, the non-demanding party has no

=== PAGE 11 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
right to have the case remain on that docket. It is the objection itself that
establishes the right.
Summary
Detailed explanation of how a party can invoke their right to a jury trial in
Texas. It clarifies that a party must demand a jury trial and pay the jury fee
to secure this right. Additionally, if a party wishes to ensure that the case
remains on the jury docket, they must object to any withdrawal of the case
from the jury docket. This requirement for an objection was established by a
change in Rule 220 in 1947, which shifted from requiring consent to
requiring an objection for withdrawal.
General Motors Corp. v. Gayle, 951 S.W.2d 469 (Tex. 1997)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
No jury trial shall be had in any civil suit, unless a written request for a jury
trial is filed with the clerk of the court a reasonable time before the date set
for trial of the cause on the non-jury docket, but not less than thirty days in
advance. TEX.R. CIV. P. 216(a). General Motors filed a written request for a
jury trial and tendered the $30.00 fee on January 3, 1996, the date the case
was set for trial. General Motors also moved to continue the trial to allow its
jury request to become timely. As noted, the trial court denied the motion for
continuance, calling the case for nonjury trial on January 5.
Summary
In Texas, a party must file a written request for a jury trial with the court
clerk at least thirty days before the trial date. This requirement is outlined
in Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 216(a). The passage also illustrates a
situation where a party, General Motors, attempted to invoke their right to a
jury trial by filing a request and paying the fee on the day of the trial, which
was not timely according to the rule. The court denied their motion for a
continuance to make the request timely, highlighting the importance of
adhering to the thirty-day requirement.

216 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. ... ICP concedes that the right to

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
trial by jury can be waived by failure to comply with the procedures
prescribed by Rule 216. ... Rule 216 states that '[n]o jury trial shall be had in
any civil suit, unless' a timely demand is made and jury fee paid. By the
rule's express language, those conditions are prerequisites to a jury trial,
not guarantees of one. ... Tex.R. Civ. P. 216 ('a. Request. No jury trial shall be
had in any civil suit, unless a written request for a jury trial is filed with the
clerk of the court a reasonable time before the date set for trial of the cause
on the non-jury docket, but not less than thirty days in advance. b. Jury Fee.
Unless otherwise provided by law, a fee of ten dollars if in the district court
and five dollars if in the county court must be deposited with the clerk of the
court within the time for making a written request for a jury trial. The clerk
shall promptly enter a notation of the payment of such fee upon the court's
docket sheet.').
Summary
Procedural requirements under Rule 216 of the Texas Rules of Civil
Procedure for invoking the right to a jury trial in Texas. It specifies that a
party must file a written request for a jury trial and pay the jury fee at least
thirty days before the trial date. These steps are prerequisites for securing a
jury trial, and failure to comply with them can result in waiving the right to a
jury trial. The passage also clarifies that these procedures are not
guarantees of a jury trial but necessary conditions to request one.
Wooten v. Dallas Hunting & Fishing Club, Inc., 427 S.W.2d 344 (Tex. Ct. App.
1968)
Texas Civil Court of Appeals
Extract
Rule 216, Vernon's Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, provides that no jury trial
shall be had in any civil suit, unless application be made therefor and unless
a fee of five dollars if in the district court, and three dollars if in the county
court, be deposited by the applicant with the clerk to the use of the county
on or before appearance day or, if thereafter, a reasonable time before the
date set for trial of the cause on the nonjury docket, but not less than ten
days in advance.
Summary
The passage from the case Wooten v. Dallas Hunting & Fishing Club, Inc.
provides specific procedural requirements for invoking the right to a jury
trial in Texas civil cases. It states that an application for a jury trial must be
made, and a fee must be deposited with the clerk. This must be done on or
before the appearance day or within a reasonable time before the trial date,
but not less than ten days in advance. This rule is applicable to civil cases in
Texas courts and is not considered a violation of constitutional rights.

First Bankers Ins. Co. v. Lockwood, 417 S.W.2d 738 (Tex. Ct. App. 1967)
Texas Civil Court of Appeals
Extract
Although Article 1, Section 15 of the Constitution of Texas, Vernon's Ann.St.,
provides: 'The right of trial by jury shall remain inviolate'; such a right is not
absolute in civil cases. It is subject to the compliance with certain
procedural rules set out in Rule 216, Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. This
rule permits a jury trial if application therefor is made in the proper court
and the specified fee 'be deposited by the applicant with the clerk to the use
of the county on or before the date set for trial of the cause on the non-jury
docket, but not less than ten days in advance. The clerk shall promptly enter
a notation of the payment of such fee upon the court's docket sheet.'
Summary
In Texas, the right to a jury trial in civil cases is not absolute and is subject
to procedural compliance. Specifically, Rule 216 of the Texas Rules of Civil
Procedure requires that a party must apply for a jury trial in the proper
court and deposit the specified jury fee with the clerk at least ten days
before the trial date set on the non-jury docket. The clerk must then
promptly note the payment on the court's docket sheet. This ensures that
the demand for a jury trial is timely and properly recorded.

Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Therefore, there are two basic requirements in securing a jury trial in a civil
case: (1) there must be an application or demand for a jury trial and (2) the
correct fee must be paid within the time allowed in Rule 216. Dawson v.
Jarvis, 627 S.W.2d 444, 446 (Tex.App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 1981, writ ref'd
n.r.e.). We acknowledge the fact that payment of the jury fee more than ten
days in advance of trial as required by Rule 216 does not make the payment
timely as a matter of law. Texas Oil & Gas Corp. v. Vela, 429 S.W.2d 866,
876-877 (Tex.1968). However, if the fee is paid more than ten days before
trial, there is a presumption that it has been paid within a reasonable time.
Summary
Requirements for invoking the right to a jury trial in Texas civil cases. It
specifies that a party must make an application or demand for a jury trial
and pay the correct fee within the time allowed by Rule 216. The passage
also clarifies that paying the fee more than ten days before the trial creates
a presumption of timeliness, although it does not automatically make it
timely as a matter of law. This information is applicable to all civil cases in
Texas, as it is based on the Texas Constitution and procedural rules.
Olson v. Texas Commerce Bank, 715 S.W.2d 764 (Tex. App. 1986)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The right to a jury trial is guaranteed by the Texas Constitution, which
provides: The right of trial by jury shall remain inviolate.... Tex. Const. art. I,
sec. 15. For civil cases, the constitution sets certain conditions on the right:
In the trial of all causes in the District Courts, the plaintiff or defendant
shall, upon application made in open court, have the right of trial by jury;
but no jury shall be empaneled in any civil case unless demanded by a party
to the case, and a jury fee be paid by the party demanding a jury, for such
sum, and with such exceptions as may be prescribed by the Legislature. Tex.
Const. art. V, sec. 10 (emphasis supplied). Finally, rule 216 of the Texas
Rules of Civil Procedure states specific procedural requirements for a party
desiring a jury trial: No jury trial shall be had in any civil suit, unless
application be made therefor and unless a fee ... be deposited by the
applicant with the clerk ... on or before appearance day or, if thereafter, a

Summary
Detailed explanation of the constitutional and procedural requirements for
invoking the right to a jury trial in Texas. It highlights the constitutional
guarantee of the right to a jury trial and specifies the conditions under
which this right can be exercised, including the requirement to demand a
jury and pay a jury fee. Rule 216 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure
further clarifies the timing for making such a demand, emphasizing that it
must be done at least ten days before the trial date.

Extract
The right to a jury trial is guaranteed by the Texas Constitution. Tex. Const.
art. I, § 15 ('The right of trial by jury shall remain inviolate.'), art. V, § 10 ('In
the trial of all causes in the District Courts, the plaintiff or defendant shall,
upon application made in open court, have the right of trial by jury.').
Nonetheless, the right to a jury trial in a civil case is not self-executing. See
Vardilos v. Vardilos, 219 S.W.3d 920, 923 (Tex. App.-Dallas 2007, no pet). To
invoke and perfect the right to a jury trial in a civil case, a party must first
comply with the requirements of rule 216. Id.
Summary
While the right to a jury trial is constitutionally guaranteed in Texas, it is not
automatic in civil cases. A party must actively invoke this right by complying
with specific procedural requirements, specifically those outlined in Rule
216 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. This suggests that a party must
make a formal request and pay a jury fee within a specified timeframe to
perfect their right to a jury trial.

before the date set for trial of the cause on the non-jury docket, but not less
than thirty days in advance. TEX.R.CIV.P. 216(1). By the terms of rule 216, a
party does not have a right to a jury if the party makes the request after the
case is certified for trial and less than 30 days before trial.
Summary
Clear procedural requirement for invoking the right to a jury trial in Texas
civil cases. According to Rule 216, a party must file a written request for a
jury trial with the court clerk at least 30 days before the trial date. This rule
is generally applicable to all civil cases in Texas, ensuring that parties have a
clear timeline to follow if they wish to exercise their right to a jury trial.

In civil cases, the right to a jury trial is not automatic and arises only when a
party has demanded a jury trial and paid the applicable fee. In re J.N.F., 116
S.W.3d 426, 431 (Tex. App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2003, no pet.). Under Texas
Rule of Civil Procedure 216, a party is entitled to a jury trial if a written
request is made within a reasonable time before the first trial setting on the
non-jury docket, but in no event less than thirty days before such setting.
Tex.R.Civ.P. 216(a). The conditions set forth in rule 216 are prerequisites to
a jury trial, not guarantees of one. In re Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., 148 S.W.
3d 124, 130 (Tex. 2004) (orig. proceeding). A jury request in advance of the
thirty-day deadline is presumed to have been made a reasonable time before
trial. Halsell v. Dehoyos, 810 S.W.2d 371, 371 (Tex. 1991) (per curiam);

Summary
In Texas, the right to a jury trial in civil cases is not automatic. A party must
demand a jury trial and pay the applicable fee. According to Texas Rule of
Civil Procedure 216, a written request for a jury trial must be made within a
reasonable time before the first trial setting on the non-jury docket, and it
must be at least thirty days before such setting. If a jury request is made
before the thirty-day deadline, it is presumed to be timely. However, this
presumption can be rebutted if granting a jury trial would injure the adverse
party, disrupt the court's docket, or impede the ordinary handling of the
court's business.

Summary
Constitutional guarantee of a jury trial in Texas and specifies the procedural
requirements for invoking this right. A party must request a jury trial and
pay the jury fee at least thirty days before the trial date. The court has
discretion to deny a jury trial if these requirements are not met, but may
allow an untimely request if it does not disrupt the court's schedule, delay
the trial, or harm the opposing party. This information is applicable to civil
cases in Texas, providing a clear guideline for when and how a party can
invoke their right to a jury trial.
Dawson v. Jarvis, 627 S.W.2d 444 (Tex. App. 1981)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The right of trial by jury and the manner in which this right may be secured
are set forth as follows: Art. 5, § 10, Texas Const.: In the trial of all causes in
the District Courts the plaintiff or defendant shall upon application made in
open court, have the right of trial by jury. But no jury shall be impaneled in
any civil case unless demanded by a party to the case, and a jury fee be paid
by the party demanding the jury for such sum and with such exceptions that
may be prescribed by the Legislature. Rule 216. T.R.C.P. No jury trial shall
be had in any civil suit unless application be made therefor and unless a fee
of five dollars if in the district court, and three dollars if in the county court,
be deposited by the applicant with the clerk to the use of the county on or
before appearance day or, if thereafter, a reasonable time before the date
set for trial of the cause on the non-jury docket, but not less than ten days in
advance.
Summary
The passage from the Dawson v. Jarvis case provides a clear explanation of
the requirements for invoking the right to a jury trial in Texas. It references
both the Texas Constitution and the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure,
specifically Rule 216, which outlines the necessity of making an application
for a jury trial and paying the associated fee within a specified timeframe.

Summary
Clear guideline on how a party can invoke their right to a jury trial in Texas.
It specifies that a written request and a $10 jury fee must be submitted at
least thirty days before the trial date. This requirement is based on the
Texas Constitution and the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, making it
generally applicable to civil cases in Texas. The passage also notes that a
request made before the thirty-day deadline is presumed reasonable, which
is important for ensuring the right is properly invoked.
Pisharodi v. Columbia Valley Healthcare Sys., L.P., 622 S.W.3d 74 (Tex. App.
2020)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The right to a jury trial for attorney's fees, however, is not self-executing; the
Texas Rules of Civil Procedure require affirmative action to obtain a jury
trial. See Green v. W.E. Grace Mfg. Co., 422 S.W.2d 723, 725–26 (Tex. 1968).
A party must demand a jury trial and timely pay the required fee. Tex. Const.
art. V, § 10 ; Tex. R. Civ. P. 216. Here, Pisharodi submitted a written request
for a jury trial on the issue of reasonable attorney's fees, paid the jury fee,
and re-urged his objection to proceeding without a jury trial prior to the
hearing on attorney's fees. Pisharodi has, therefore, preserved this issue for
review.
Summary
In Texas, the right to a jury trial is not automatic and requires specific
actions by the party seeking it. The party must make a formal demand for a
jury trial and pay the associated fee in a timely manner. This requirement is
grounded in the Texas Constitution and the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure.
The case of Pisharodi illustrates that by submitting a written request and
paying the fee, a party can preserve their right to a jury trial for review.

objections and to demand a jury trial on the objections made. It is true that
we have not been cited to any Texas case so holding and we have not found
any, but we think the clause in the rule '* * * and in such case a trial of the
issues thereon shall be had as in other cases * * *' means that the
dissatisfied party may submit his objections to the court without the
intervention of a jury, or he may demand a jury trial to pass on what he
believes to be important factual issues. We think this view is in accord with
our procedure and our judicial history.
Summary
This interpretation aligns with Texas procedural and judicial history.

Article 1.15 provides that no felony conviction can be had absent a jury
verdict, 'unless the defendant, upon entering a plea, has in open court in
person waived his right of trial by jury in writing in accordance with Articles
1.13 and 1.14.' Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 1.15 (Vernon Supp. 2001).
Article 1.13(a) requires jury waivers in non-capital cases to be 'made in

1.13(a) (Vernon Supp. 2001).
Summary
In Texas, a party can invoke their right to a jury trial unless they choose to
waive it. The waiver must be made in person, in writing, and in open court,
with the consent and approval of both the court and the attorney
representing the State. This is applicable to non-capital felony cases.

The passage provides specific procedural requirements for invoking the
right to a jury trial in Texas, stating that a written request must be filed at
least thirty days before the trial date. It also discusses the standard of

936 S.W.2d 59 A.M., In Interest of
Extract
In appellant's first point of error, he contends that the trial court erred in
denying him a jury trial where he had properly requested a jury pursuant to
TEX.R. CIV. P. 216. On November 6, 1995, appellant filed his request for jury
trial and tendered the appropriate fee... By requesting a jury trial and
paying the jury fee, appellant perfected his right to a jury trial. TEX.R. CIV.
P. 216. However, once perfected, the right to a jury trial in a civil case may
still be waived by a party's failure to act... A party is required to act
affirmatively in order to preserve the right to complain on appeal that it was
denied its right to a trial by jury.
Summary
The passage provides insight into the procedural requirements for invoking
the right to a jury trial in Texas. It specifies that a party must request a jury
trial and pay the jury fee to perfect this right. However, it also highlights
that this right can be waived if the party does not act affirmatively to
preserve it, such as by objecting to proceeding without a jury.
Fox v. Oak

The right to a jury trial in a civil case in Texas courts is not self-executing
and a litigant must take certain steps to invoke and perfect her jury trial
right. Matter of Troy S. Poe Tr., 646 S.W.3d 771, 778 (Tex. 2022); see Tex. R.
Civ. P. 216 ('Request and Fee for Jury Trial'). 'When a party has perfected

Summary
In Texas, the right to a jury trial in civil cases is not automatic. A party must
take specific steps to invoke and perfect this right, such as requesting a jury
trial and paying the associated fee as per Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 216.
If a party has perfected their right to a jury trial, they must object on the
record if the trial court proceeds without a jury or affirmatively indicate
their intention to stand on their perfected right. Failure to do so results in a
waiver of the right to a jury trial.
Chavez v. State
Extract
A defendant has an absolute right to a jury trial. Hobbs v. State, 298 S.W.3d
193, 197 (Tex. Crim. App. 2009); see U.S. Const. amend. VI; Tex. Const. art.
I, §15. However, except in a capital felony case in which the State is seeking
the death penalty, a defendant may waive the right to a jury trial and,
instead, have a bench trial. See Hobbs, 298 S.W.3d at 197; Tex. Code Crim.
Proc. Ann. art. 1.13(a) (West, Westlaw through 2023 4th C.S.). For a waiver
of a defendant's right to a jury trial to be valid, the record must show that it
was voluntarily and knowingly made. Hobbs, 298 S.W.3d at 203 n.42. When
a defendant challenges the voluntariness of his jury-trial waiver, the State
must establish through the record that the defendant expressly, knowingly,
and intelligently waived his right to a jury trial. Hobbs, 298 S.W.3d at 197;
Martinez v. State, 449 S.W.3d 193, 199 (Tex. App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2014,
pet. ref'd).
Summary
Clear explanation of the right to a jury trial in Texas, including the
conditions under which a defendant can waive this right. It specifies that a
defendant has an absolute right to a jury trial, but this right can be waived if
done voluntarily and knowingly. The passage also outlines the requirement
for the State to prove that any waiver of this right was made knowingly and
intelligently.

Summary
The passage provides insight into the procedural requirements for invoking
a right to a jury trial in the context of a partition suit in Texas. According to
Rule 771, a party must file objections to the commissioners' report within
thirty days of its filing to have a trial on those issues. This indicates that the
right to a jury trial is contingent upon timely objections to the report, and
the trial will address the issues raised in those objections.
Hector L. Rodriguez Hector Leal Rodriguez v. Rodriguez
Extract
On January 12, 2016, the trial court entered a docket control order which
set the case for trial on April 11, 2016. The order stated that the 'case shall
be tried by a jury if there are any issues to which a party has the right to a
determination by a jury trial,' but provided that the case would be tried to
the bench if 'there are no issues that are required to be submitted to a
jury.' ... On February 17, 2016, Hector requested a jury trial.
Summary
A party can request a jury trial in Texas if there are issues in the case that a
party has the right to have determined by a jury. The request for a jury trial
must be made in a timely manner, as demonstrated by Hector's request on
February 17, 2016, for a trial set on April 11, 2016. This suggests that the
request should be made well in advance of the trial date.

their right is preserved.
In re D.L.
Extract
After significant pretrial proceedings, the case was tried in February 2025.
The trial was bifurcated, with the case to terminate Father&#39;s parental
rights tried to the bench and the case to terminate Mother&#39;s rights
tried to a jury. Neither Mother nor Father was present during any portion of
either trial. As discussed below, Mother&#39;s counsel orally moved for a
continuance of trial, which was denied... The trial court set the case for trial
in February 2025. The court conducted a pretrial hearing the week before
trial began, which Father did not attend. At the hearing, the Department
informed the trial court it wanted to proceed with termination of
Father&#39;s parental rights under sections 161.002(b)(1) and (3) of the
Family Code. See TEX. FAM. CODE § 161.002(b)(1), (3). Father&#39;s
counsel objected, saying he had met Father &#34;for the first time&#34; at
a mediation held the week before and Father had said &#34;he wanted to
be in court when we went to trial.&#34; Father&#39;s counsel also
asserted that Father said he &#34;is the father and wants to establish
paternity.&#34; The trial court announced it would &#34;entertain the
termination Monday [the first day of trial] should [Father] not appear for
jury trial.&#34; When trial began the following week, Father did not appear,
and his counsel told the trial court he had not had any contact with Father
that day. After hearing argument from the parties about whether the
parents&#39; failure to appear waived their right to a jury trial, the trial
court announced it would proceed with Mother&#39;s case as a jury trial
and try Father&#39;s case to the bench. Over Father&#39;s counsel&#39;s
objection, the trial court called Father&#39;s case for a bench trial.
Summary
The right to a jury trial can be invoked in cases of parental rights
termination. However, the failure of a party to appear at the trial can lead to
the waiver of the right to a jury trial, as seen in the case of Father, whose
case was tried to the bench due to his absence. The trial court has the
discretion to decide whether to proceed with a jury trial or a bench trial
based on the circumstances, such as the presence or absence of the parties
involved.

jury trial is conditioned on approval by the prosecutor and the judge...
Procedures vary regarding when the respondent is required to make an
election between jury trial and bench trial. In some States s/he must demand
or waive a jury at arraignment...
Summary
The passage provides insight into the process of waiving or electing a jury
trial, indicating that while a respondent can waive their right to a jury trial,
this waiver often requires approval from both the prosecutor and the judge.

Extract
The defendant in a criminal prosecution for any offense other than a capital
felony case in which the state notifies the court and the defendant that it will
seek the death penalty shall have the right, upon entering a plea, to waive
the right of trial by jury, conditioned, however, that, except as provided by
Article 27.19, the waiver must be made in person by the defendant in
writing in open court with the consent and approval of the court, and the
attorney representing the state.
Summary
The passage from the Texas Criminal Forms provides information on the
waiver of a jury trial, indicating that a defendant has the right to waive a
jury trial in most criminal prosecutions, except in capital felony cases where
the death penalty is sought. This waiver must be made in person, in writing,
and with the consent of the court and the state's attorney. This implies that
the right to a jury trial is automatically available unless waived under these
conditions.
Jury Selection and Voir Dire

Extract
In a district court, a defendant can validly waive his right to be tried by
twelve jurors and consent to a trial by a lesser number. Hatch v. State, 958
S.W.2d 813 (Tex. Crim. App. 1997) (where it was discovered that one of the
jurors was not a U.S. citizen); Government Code §62.201. In a county court,
a defendant who has executed a valid written jury waiver may be tried by a
jury of less than six jurors. Hanley v. State, 909 S.W.2d 117 (Tex.App.—
Houston [14th Dist.] 1995, no pet.). There is no constitutional or statutory
impediment to proceeding with less than six jurors in county court, so long
as the defendant waives his right to trial by a complete jury under Article
1.14, and the State and the trial court are willing to consent to do so under
Article 1.13(a). Ex parte Garza, 337 S.W.3d 903 (Tex. Crim. App. 2011).
Summary
The passage provides information on the waiver of the right to a full jury
trial in Texas. It explains that in district courts, a defendant can waive the
right to a twelve-member jury, and in county courts, a defendant can waive
the right to a six-member jury, provided certain conditions are met. This
indicates that the right to a jury trial can be modified or waived under

Shuffle The Deck: The Role The Texas Jury Shuffle Plays In Creating Diverse
And Favorable Juries
Extract
At this point just before voir dire, the opposing party may invoke Texas Rule
of Civil Procedure 223 or Texas Criminal Procedure Article 35.11 for
criminal trials - referred to as the jury shuffle. Ordinarily, if the county
follows an interchangeable jury system, the jurors are placed on the general
panel randomly and assigned for service from the top down. But if any party
demands a shuffle before the voir dire examination, all the names of the
jurors assigned to that court are reshuffled in a receptacle and reordered
based on the shuffle. It is critical that the shuffle is requested before jurors
are sworn or else the request will not be proper. Only one shuffle is allowed
per trial in civil trials, while multiple shuffles are allowed in a criminal trial.
Summary
In Texas, a party can invoke their right to a jury shuffle just before the voir
dire examination. This is applicable under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 223
for civil trials and Texas Criminal Procedure Article 35.11 for criminal trials.
The request must be made before the jurors are sworn in, and only one
shuffle is allowed per civil trial, while multiple shuffles are allowed in
criminal trials. This information is generally applicable to trials in Texas.
