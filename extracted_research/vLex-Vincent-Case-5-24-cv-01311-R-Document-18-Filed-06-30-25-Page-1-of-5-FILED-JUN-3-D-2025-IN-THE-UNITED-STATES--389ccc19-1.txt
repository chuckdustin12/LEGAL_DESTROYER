FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) and 12(b)
(3) MEMORANDUM OF LAW I. INT RODUCTION Plaintiffs First Amen ded
Complaint attempts to reframe a contentious domestic dispute and family
court li tigation as a federal RICO conspiracy. However, the Complaint fails
to allege the essential elements of a RICO claim, lacks particularity, and is
improperly venued in this District. Moreover, the factual a ll egations are
speculative, conclusory, and unsupported by a dmissible evidence. II. LEGAL
STA NDARD To survive a motion to dismiss u n der Rule 12(b)(6), a
complaint must contain "enough facts to state a claim to relief t h at is p
lausible on its face." Be ll At!. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007).
Mere labels, conclusions, or a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause
ofaction are insufficient. Ashcroft v. Iqba l, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). 1 Case
5:24-cv-01311-R Document 18 Filed 06/30/25 Page 2 of 5 Ill.ARGUMENT A.
Plaintiff Fails to State a RICO Claim To state a civil RICO claim, a plaintiff
must allege: (1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of
racketeering activity. Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. lmrex Co., 473 U.S. 479,496 (1985).
Plaintiff fails to plausibly allege any of these elements. 1. No Plausible
"Enterprise" Plaintiff alleges an "association-in-fact" enterprise between two
individuals involved in a personal relationship. Courts have consistently held
that personal relationships, even if strained or adversarial, do not constitute
a RICO enterprise. See United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 583 (1981);
Begala v. PNC Bank, Ohio, N.A., 214 F.3d 776, 781 (6th Cir. 2000). 2. No
Pattern of Racketeering Activity Plaintiffs allegations span a short period
and involve no ongoing threat of criminal activity. The Supreme Court has
held that a "pattern" requires continuity and relatedness. H.J. Inc. v.
Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 239 (1989). Sporadic or isolated
acts do not suffice. See Sil-Flo, Inc. v. SFHC, Inc., 917 F.2d 1507, 1516 (10th
Cir. 1990). 3. No Predicate Acts Plaintiff alleges wire fraud and Travel Act
violations, but fails to plead them with the specificity required under Rule
9(b ). See Koch v. Koch Indus., Inc., 203 F.3d 1202, 2 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R
Document 18 Filed 06/30/25 Page 3 of 5 1236 (10th Cir. 2000). The
Complaint lacks dates, content, and context of the alleged fraudulent
communications. 8. Plaintiff's Claims Are Based on a Domestic Dispute The
gravamen of Plaintiffs complaint is a failed marriage and related family
court proceedings. Courts have repeatedly rejected attempts to convert
family law disputes into RICO claims. See Annulli v. Panikkar, 200 F.3d 189,
200 (3d Cir. 1999); Bell v. Dean, No. 2:09-CV-1082-WKW, 2010 WL 185608
(M.D. Ala. Jan. 19, 2010); Benton v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., No. 1:13-
CV-01454, 2014 WL 1407584 (N.D. Ga. Apr. 10, 2014). C. Plaintiff Lacks
Standing Under RICO To have standing under 18 U.S.C. § 1964( c ), a
plaintiff must show injury to "business or property." Emotional distress,
reputational harm, or speculative business losses are not sufficient See

Holmes v. Sec. Investor Prot Corp., 503 U.S. 258, 268 (1992); Reiter v.
Sonotone Corp., 442 U.S. 330, 339 (1979). D. Venue Is Improper in the
Western District of Oklahoma Under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b ), venue is proper
only where a substantial part of the events giving rise to the claim occurred.
Plaintiffs allegations center on events in Texas, including divorce
proceedings in Tarrant County. The only connection to Oklahoma is the
residence of one defendant, which is insufficient. See Woodke v. Dahm, 70 F.
3d 983, 985 (8th Cir. 1995). 3 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R Document 18 Filed
06/30/25 Page 4 of 5 E. Counterarguments to Plaintiffs Specific Claims 1.
Alleged Wire Fraud Plaintiff claims a $1,576 transfer was fraudulent.
However, both parties had access to the joint account Courts have held that
transfers between spouses from joint accounts do not constitute fraud. See
United States v. Sayakhom, 186 F.3d 928, 939 (9th Cir. 1999). 2. Alleged
Travel Act Violation Plaintiff alleges interstate travel to commit fraud.
However, travel for personal reasons, even if related to a divorce, does not
constitute a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1952 unless it furthers a criminal
enterprise. See United States v. Nardella, 393 U.S. 286, 290 (1969). 3.
Alleged Perjury and False Filings Even if Plaintiffs allegations of false
statements in court filings were true, perjury in state court proceedings is
not a predicate act under RICO. See Kim v. Kimm, 884 F.3d 98, 104 (2d Cir.
2018). IV. CONCLUSION For the foregoing reasons, Defendants respectfully
request that the Court: 1. Dismiss Plaintiffs First Amended Complaint with
prejudice under Rule 12(b)(6); 2. Alternatively, dismiss for improper venue
under Rule 12(b)(3); and 3. Grant such other relief as the Court deems just
and proper. 4 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R Document 18 Filed 06/30/25 Page 5 of 5

DISTRICT COURT FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF OKLAHOMA
CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, Plaintiff, v. DANIEL KENNETH BRANTHOOVER
& MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS Defendants § § § § § Case No.: CIV-24-1311-
R § § § § § PLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT
DANIEL BRANTHOOVER’S MOTION TO DISMISS FIRST AMENDED
COMPLAINT Branthoover's motion to dismiss fails because Plaintiff has
adequately pled all RICO elements with sufficient particularity, including
predicate acts of wire fraud and Travel Act violations, a pattern of
racketeering activity spanning 18 months, an enterprise with distinct roles,
and concrete business injuries. Branthoover's alteration of his motion by
removing "COMES NOW DAN AND MORGAN" after Plaintiff pointed out he
couldn't file for Myers demonstrates his unauthorized practice of law and
furthers the conspiracy allegations. For the forthcoming reasons,
Defendant’s motion to dismiss should be DENIED and the case should be
permitted to proceed to discovery after Defendant Myers’ motion to dismiss
or response to Plaintiff’s complaint is filed with the Court. 2 I. Introduction
1. Defendant Branthoover's motion to dismiss must be denied because
Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged each essential element of a civil RICO claim
under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) and (d). The complaint meticulously details
predicate acts of wire fraud and Travel Act violations with the required
particularity under Rule 9(b), establishes a pattern of racketeering activity
through related acts spanning approximately 18 months (satisfying both
closed-ended and open-ended continuity requirements), identifies a distinct
enterprise with defined roles, and demonstrates concrete injury to business
and property as required for standing under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c). 2.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Branthoover’s attempt to file on behalf of Myers and subsequent alteration
of the motion document after being challenged provides further evidence
supporting Plaintiff’s allegations of unauthorized practice of law and
ongoing conspiracy. This conduct aligns with the pattern of deceptive
behavior alleged throughout the complaint and demonstrates that the
fraudulent activity continues even during the litigation process, reinforcing
the open-ended continuity of the enterprise’s operations. II. Legal
Framework: RICO Requirements A. Sufficiency of RICO Claim Allegations 3.
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) prohibits
conducting or participating in the conduct of an enterprise's affairs through
a pattern of racketeering activity, 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). To establish a civil
RICO claim, a plaintiff must allege "(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3)
through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity," plus injury to business or
property. 3 4. Under 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1), "racketeering activity" includes
"any act which is indictable under" numerous federal criminal statutes,
including wire fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343) and Travel Act violations (18 U.S.C. §
1952). A "pattern of racketeering activity" requires at least two acts of
racketeering activity within a ten-year period, 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5). 5. An
"enterprise" includes "any individual, partnership, corporation, association,
or other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals associated in fact
although not a legal entity," 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4). III. Analysis of
Branthoover's Motion to Dismiss A. Sufficiency of RICO Claim Allegations 6.
Branthoover first argues that Plaintiff's complaint fails to allege facts
sufficient to support a RICO claim. This argument is without merit when
analyzed against the detailed allegations in the complaint. Predicate Acts -
Wire Fraud 7. The complaint extensively details acts that constitute wire
fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343. Wire fraud requires "(1) a scheme or artifice
to defraud or obtain money by false pretenses, representations or promises;
and (2) use of interstate wire communications to facilitate that scheme." 8.
Plaintiff alleges with precision: i. Myers transferred $1,576 from the parties'
joint marital PNC account to Branthoover's PayPal account (username
"dmb575"), completely depleting the account balance. (Complaint ¶25) 4 ii.
The transfer occurred on December 15, 2023, immediately following
Branthoover's deceptive phone call. (Complaint ¶25) iii. 92 text messages
were exchanged between Myers and Branthoover on December 14, 2023,
coordinating their plan across state lines. (Complaint ¶19) iv. Interstate
communications occurred between Texas (where Myers was located) and
Oklahoma (where Branthoover was located). (Complaint ¶67) v. Branthoover
deceived Plaintiff by stating "I've been where you are before. I want to help
both of you," when his true intent was to assist Myers in depleting their joint
account. (Complaint ¶22) 9. These allegations satisfy the elements of wire
fraud as they establish a scheme to defraud, use of interstate wire
communications in furtherance of the scheme, and intent to deprive another
of money or property. Predicate Acts - Travel Act Violations 10. The
complaint also details violations of the Travel Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1952, which
prohibits travel in interstate commerce or use of interstate facilities with
intent to promote, manage, establish, carry on, or facilitate unlawful activity.
11. Plaintiff alleges: i. Myers traveled interstate from Texas to Oklahoma on
December 15, 2023, to coordinate with Branthoover. (Complaint ¶¶23-24) 5
ii. This travel was specifically intended to prepare fraudulent court
documents. (Complaint ¶33) iii. Myers transported the fraudulent
documents back to Texas on December 17, 2023. (Complaint ¶35) iv. After

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
the interstate travel, Myers filed the fraudulent documents with Texas
courts. (Complaint ¶¶39-42) 12. These allegations establish all elements of a
Travel Act violation: interstate travel, intent to facilitate unlawful activity,
and subsequent performance of acts furthering that unlawful activity.
Pattern of Racketeering Activity 13. Under 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5), a "pattern of
racketeering activity" requires at least two acts of racketeering activity
within a ten-year period. However, the Tenth Circuit requires more than just
two predicate acts; the acts must be related and continuous. 14. Plaintiff's
complaint alleges multiple related predicate acts spanning approximately 18
months, from December 2023 through May 2025: i. Wire transfer of $1,576
on December 15, 2023. (Complaint ¶25) ii. Interstate travel and document
preparation on December 15-17, 2023. (Complaint ¶¶35-39) iii. Filing of
fraudulent court documents on December 18, 2023. (Complaint ¶39) iv.
Filing of fraudulent protective order application on December 22, 2023.
(Complaint ¶45) 6 v. Threatening communications continuing through
December 12, 2024. (Complaint ¶51) vi. Most recent threatening
communication on May 24, 2025. (Complaint ¶52) vii. The transmission of a
motion to dismiss across interstate communications by Branthoover, CC’ing
defendant Myers as if filing on her behalf. See Exhibit 1. 15. These acts are
related as they share the same purpose (depriving Plaintiff of property
rights), involve the same participants (Myers and Branthoover), target the
same victim (Plaintiff), and employ similar methods (deception and
manipulation of legal processes). 16. The pattern also demonstrates both
closed-ended continuity (acts spanning over 18 months and is ongoing) and
open-ended continuity (threat of continued criminal activity, evidenced by
Branthoover's May 2025 message threatening future retaliation). An
enterprise under RICO includes "any individual, partnership, corporation,
association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals
associated in fact although not a legal entity," 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4).
Enterprise 17. Plaintiff alleges an association-in-fact enterprise between
Myers and Branthoover with clear organizational structure: i. Myers acted
as the "inside" operative with access to marital assets and ability to file
documents in Texas courts. (Complaint ¶91) 7 ii. Branthoover served as the
"outside" operative providing administrative oversight, expertise on
protective orders, and a base of operations in Oklahoma. (Complaint ¶91) iii.
The enterprise functioned as a continuing unit from December 2023 through
June 27, 2025, with consistent roles and coordinated actions. (Complaint
¶91) 18. This enterprise is distinct from the pattern of racketeering activity
itself, possessing structure beyond what was necessary to commit the
predicate acts. Injury to Business or Property 19. For standing under 18
U.S.C. § 1964(c), a plaintiff must allege injury to business or property by
reason of a RICO violation. 20. Plaintiff alleges concrete, quantifiable
injuries: i. Loss of $1,576 fraudulently transferred from the joint marital
account. (Complaint ¶¶25, 104) ii. Business losses from disruption of his
home-based financial analytics business. (Complaint ¶¶115-123) iii.
Documented revenue loss with specific projections based on historical
performance. (Complaint ¶¶121-122) iv. Total damages quantified at
$101,370.58. (Complaint ¶126) 21. These allegations establish concrete
injury to business and property as required for RICO standing. 8 B. Pleading
Fraud with Particularity (Rule 9(b)) 22. Branthoover argues that Plaintiff's
allegations of wire fraud fail to meet the heightened pleading standard of
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b). This argument fails given the detailed

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
factual allegations in the complaint. 23. Rule 9(b) requires that a party
"state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake,"
including the "who, what, when, where, and how" of the alleged misconduct.
The complaint provides these details with precision: i. Who: Myers and
Branthoover. (Complaint ¶¶5-6) ii. What: Transfer of $1,576 from joint
marital account to Branthoover's PayPal account. (Complaint ¶25) iii. When:
December 15, 2023, with exact timestamps for communications. (Complaint
¶¶22, 25) iv. Where: Interstate between Texas and Oklahoma. (Complaint
¶67) v. How: Through PayPal, using account identifier "dmb575". (Complaint
¶28) 24. The complaint also details: i. The content of specific
communications, including direct quotes. (Complaint ¶¶22, 30, 40) ii. The
specific documents prepared and filed fraudulently. (Complaint ¶39) 9 iii.
The precise false statements contained in those documents. (Complaint
¶¶43-44, 46) 25. These allegations amply satisfy Rule 9(b)'s requirement to
plead fraud with particularity. C. RICO Claims Based on Domestic Disputes
26. Branthoover argues that Plaintiff's allegations arise primarily from a
domestic dispute and related family court proceedings, which do not
constitute the type of organized criminal activity contemplated by RICO.
While courts have been skeptical of RICO claims arising solely from
domestic disputes, Plaintiff's allegations go far beyond a mere domestic
disagreement. The complaint alleges a sophisticated scheme involving: i.
Interstate travel and commerce. (Complaint ¶¶23-25, 35) ii. Strategic
coordination between multiple parties. (Complaint ¶¶19, 33, 91-92) iii.
Financial crimes including wire fraud. (Complaint ¶¶25-28) iv. Manipulation
of multiple court proceedings. (Complaint ¶¶39-46) v. Substantial business
injuries. (Complaint ¶¶115-123) 27. This is precisely the type of interstate
racketeering activity that RICO was designed to address, regardless of
whether it arose in the context of a domestic relationship. 10 D. RICO
Standing and Injury 28. Branthoover argues that Plaintiff lacks standing to
bring a RICO claim because he has not alleged a concrete injury to business
or property as required under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c). 29. This argument is
contradicted by the complaint's detailed allegations of specific injuries: i.
Loss of $1,576 fraudulently transferred from the joint marital account.
(Complaint ¶¶25, 104) ii. Documented business disruption when Plaintiff
was forced to vacate his home, where he operated his business. (Complaint
¶119) iii. Specific impact on business operations, including inability to
maintain internet connectivity required for his digital financial analytics
business. (Complaint ¶120) iv. Quantified loss of business revenue based on
historical performance data. (Complaint ¶¶121-122) v. Total damages of
$101,370.58, consisting of $99,794.58 in lost business income and $1,576 in
fraudulently transferred funds. (Complaint ¶126) 30. These allegations
establish concrete, non-speculative injuries to business and property that
are directly traceable to defendants' alleged RICO violations. 11 E.
Continuity of Racketeering Activity 31. Branthoover argues that Plaintiff
fails to allege continuity of racketeering activity. Under 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5),
a "pattern of racketeering activity" requires at least two acts of racketeering
activity within a ten-year period. However, courts have established that
these acts must demonstrate either "closed-ended" continuity (a series of
related acts extending over a substantial period) or "open-ended" continuity
(past conduct that by its nature projects into the future with a threat of
repetition). 32. The complaint alleges both: i. Closed-ended continuity:
Related acts spanning from December 2023 through May 2025,

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
approximately 18 months (Complaint ¶¶49-52, 86) ii. Open-ended continuity:
Ongoing threats and monitoring activities with explicit threats of future
retaliation, including Branthoover's May 24, 2025 message stating "Where's
my lawsuit? Heard your vm about me. File it. Let's do this :)" (Complaint
¶¶51-52, 86) 33. This temporal scope exceeds what courts typically consider
sufficient to establish continuity for RICO purposes. F. Venue in the Western
District of Oklahoma 34. Branthoover challenges venue in the Western
District of Oklahoma. Under 18 U.S.C. § 1965(a), "Any civil action or
proceeding under this chapter against any person may be instituted in the
district court of the United States for any district in which such person
resides, is found, has an agent, or transacts his affairs." 12 35. Additionally,
under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b), venue is proper in "a judicial district in which any
defendant resides" or "a judicial district in which a substantial part of the
events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred." 36. Venue is proper in
the Western District of Oklahoma because: i. Branthoover resides in
Canadian County, Oklahoma, which is within the Western District.
(Complaint ¶5) 37. Substantial parts of the events occurred in Oklahoma,
including: i. Preparation of fraudulent court documents at Branthoover's
residence (Complaint ¶33) ii. Myers' interstate travel to Oklahoma to
coordinate the scheme. (Complaint ¶23) iii. Receipt of the fraudulently
transferred funds in Oklahoma. (Complaint ¶25) 38. These connections
establish proper venue in the Western District of Oklahoma under both 18
U.S.C. § 1965(a) and 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b). G. Significance of Branthoover's
Motion Alteration 39. Branthoover's alteration of his motion document after
serving it on Plaintiff provides further evidence supporting the RICO claims.
The original motion began with "COMES NOW Defendant, Daniel Kenneth
Branthoover and Morgan Michelle Myers," but was later modified to remove
the reference to filing on behalf of Myers after Plaintiff pointed out that
Branthoover could not file for her. See Exhibit 1 40. This alteration is
significant for several reasons: 13 i. It demonstrates Branthoover's
continued unauthorized practice of law, consistent with Plaintiff's allegations
in paragraph 31, which states that "at no time relevant to this litigation has
Defendant Branthoover possessed a license to practice law in any
jurisdiction within the United States". ii. It shows ongoing deceptive
conduct, as Branthoover attempted to conceal his improper filing by altering
the document after being confronted. iv. It corroborates Plaintiff's
allegations regarding Branthoover's administrative role and pattern of
misrepresentations v. It provides evidence of the continuing nature of the
conspiracy alleged in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d) 41. This conduct is
remarkably similar to Branthoover's earlier text message in which he falsely
claimed to be a legal representative, stating: "Charlie, it's come to my
understanding you have retained an attorney. I'm sure he has told you that
all further communication should take place between attorneys. I must
formally ask you refrain from discussing details of this case with my client
moving forward and only communicate with me or your attorney".
(Complaint ¶40). H. The Divorce Process Initiated Under Branthoover's
Advisement 42. The complaint specifically alleges that the divorce process
was initiated under Branthoover's advisement and with his direct
involvement. Paragraph 30 states that Branthoover told Plaintiff "You Are
Getting Divorced..." followed by "I hope I can help 14 with the paperwork
and make things go as smoothly as possible." This statement preceded any
divorce filings, indicating Branthoover's prior knowledge of and involvement

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
in the planned legal action. 43. Paragraphs 39 and 43 detail how the
fraudulent divorce petition was prepared in Oklahoma under Branthoover's
"direct administrative oversight" and contained numerous false statements
designed to deceive the Texas courts. These allegations establish that
Branthoover was an active participant in initiating and directing the divorce
process as part of the fraudulent scheme. 44. This involvement directly
counters Branthoover's argument that this is merely a domestic dispute
outside RICO's scope, as it shows his direct participation in an interstate
scheme involving predicate acts of wire fraud and Travel Act violations. 45.
Plaintiff is handling both matters separately, and Defendant Myers is unable
to finalize the divorce and has abandoned the matter. I. Perjury and
Subordinate Perjury 46. Finally, Defendant’s motion to dismiss claims
“perjury in state court proceedings is not a predicate act under RICO”. This
mischaracterizes Plaintiff’s complaint, as perjury and subordinate perjury
were not alleged to have been predicate acts themselves, but were alleged
“to support a pattern of racketeering activity…” (Complaint ¶57). 47. The
Second Circuit's decision in U.S. v. Eisen, 974 F.2d 246 (2nd Cir. 1992) is
particularly instructive. The court acknowledged the tension between
Congress's decision to include mail fraud as a predicate offense while
excluding perjury, but determined that 15 "where, as here, a fraudulent
scheme falls within the scope of the federal mail fraud statute and the other
elements of RICO are established, use of the mail fraud offense as a RICO
predicate act cannot be suspended simply because perjury is part of the
means for perpetrating the fraud." Id. at 254. By extension, this principle
would apply equally to wire fraud, which is closely related to mail fraud and
is also an enumerated RICO predicate act. 48. This means that when perjury
or subordination of perjury is committed as part of a fraudulent scheme that
includes wire fraud or Travel Act violations, these acts can contribute to
establishing a pattern of racketeering activity even though they are not
themselves predicate acts. The key is that the perjury must be interrelated
with the qualifying predicate acts and further the same criminal scheme,
which is the case in the instant matter. IV. Conclusion 46. Based on the
foregoing analysis, Branthoover's motion to dismiss should be denied in its
entirety. Plaintiff has adequately alleged all elements required for a civil
RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) and conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. §
1962(d), including: i. Predicate acts of wire fraud and Travel Act violations,
pled with the particularity required by Rule 9(b); ii. A pattern of
racketeering activity demonstrating both relatedness and continuity; 16 iii.
An association-in-fact enterprise with distinct roles and structure; iv.
Concrete injuries to business and property as required for standing under 18
U.S.C. § 1964(c); and v. Proper venue in the Western District of Oklahoma.
47. Moreover, Branthoover's alteration of his motion to dismiss document
provides further evidence of the ongoing conspiracy, demonstrating that the
pattern of deceptive conduct continues even during the litigation process. V.
Prayer WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court: i. Deny
Defendant Daniel Kenneth Branthoover’s Motion to Dismiss in its entirety; ii.
Take judicial notice that Daniel Kenneth Branthoover served two different
motions to dismiss on Plaintiff, the first purporting to be on behalf of both
Defendants, including Defendant Myers; iii. Order that this case proceed to
discovery and further proceedings on the merits; iv. Grant such other and
further relief as the Court deems just and proper. 17 Respectfully submitted,

DEFENDANT DANIEL KENNETH BRANTHOOVER'S REPLY IN SUPPORT
OF MOTION TO DISMISS FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT I.
INTRODUCTION Plaintiffs opposition fails to cure the fundamental
deficiencies in the First Amended Complaint. Despite extensive allegations,
Plaintiff does not plausibly plead the essential elements of a civil RICO claim
under 18 U.S.C. §§ 1962(c) and (d). The Complaint remains speculative,
conclusory, and improperly venued. Plaintiff's attempt to transform a
domestic dispute into a federal racketeering case is unsupported by law or
fact. 11. PLAINTIFF FAILS TO STATE A CLAIM UNDER RICO 1. No
Plausible Enterprise Plaintiff alleges an "association-in-fact" enterprise
between two individuals involved in a personal relationship. Courts
consistently reject such allegations as insufficient to establish a RICO
enterprise. See Begala v. PNC Bank, 214 F.3d 776, 781 (6th Cir. 2000). 2. No
Pattern of Racketeering Activity The alleged acts span a short period and
lack continuity. Sporadic acts tied to a domestic dispute do not constitute a
"pattern" under RICO. See H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S.
229, 239 (1989). 3. No Predicate Acts Pled with Particularity Plaintiffs wire
fraud and Travel Act claims fail under Rule 9(b). The allegations lack
sufficient detail to establish a fraudulent scheme or criminal intent. See
Koch v. Koch Indus., 203 F.3d 1202, 1236 (10th Cir. 2000). 4. No Injury to
Business or Property Plaintiffs alleged injuries are speculative and stem
from personal circumstances. Emotional distress and reputational harm are
not actionable under RICO. See Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., 442 U.S. 330, 339
(1979). Ill. VENUE IS IMPROPER IN THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF
OKLAHOMA Plaintiffs allegations center on events in Texas, including
divorce proceedings and alleged misconduct by Morgan Myers. The only
connection to Oklahoma is Defendant Branthoover' s residence, which is
insufficient under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b). See Woodke v. Dahm, 70 F.3d 983,
985 (8th Cir. 1995). IV. PLAINTIFF'S CLAIMS ARISE FROM A DOMESTIC
DISPUTE Federal courts routinely reject attempts to recast family law
disputes as RICO claims. See Bell v. Dean, 2010 WL 185608 (M.D. Ala. Jan.
19, 2010). Plaintiffs allegations stem from a failed marriage, financial
disagreements, and family court litigation- not organized criminal activity. V.
PLAINTIFF'S CLAIM OF UNAUTHORIZED PRACTICE OF LAW IS
BASELESS Plaintiff mischaracterizes Defendant's procedural conduct. The
initial inclusion of both defendants in the motion caption was corrected
promptly and does not constitute unauthorized practice oflaw. Plaintiffs
reliance on this procedural issue to support a RICO conspiracy is unfounded
and irrelevant. VI. CONCLUSION For the foregoing reasons, Defendant
respectfully requests that the Court: 1. Dismiss Plaintiffs First Amended

Plaintiff's complaint.
Answer (Tenth Circuit)
Short response
The defendant’s motion to dismiss largely misrepresents the sufficiency of
the plaintiff’s RICO allegations; under Tenth Circuit law, the complaint
plausibly pleads the required elements of a civil RICO claim, including
predicate acts, continuity, enterprise, and injury to business or property,
with sufficient particularity to survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion. However, the
defendant’s arguments regarding the domestic context and the need for
concrete business injury do raise issues that warrant close scrutiny, but do
not, on the pleadings, mandate dismissal.
Summary
The defendant argues that the plaintiff’s complaint fails to state a RICO
claim because it is based on a domestic dispute, lacks a plausible enterprise,
does not allege a pattern of racketeering activity, fails to plead predicate
acts with particularity, and does not show injury to business or property.
However, the plaintiff’s complaint, as summarized, alleges specific acts of
wire fraud and Travel Act violations, describes an association-in-fact
enterprise with distinct roles, details a pattern of related acts over 18
months, and quantifies business losses, all of which are sufficient at the
pleading stage under Tenth Circuit standards.
While courts are cautious about allowing RICO claims to proceed where the
underlying dispute is domestic, the Tenth Circuit does not categorically bar
such claims if the statutory elements are met. The plaintiff’s allegations, if
taken as true and viewed in the light most favorable to the non-movant, are
sufficiently detailed and plausible to survive a motion to dismiss, and the
defendant’s arguments to the contrary either misstate the law or improperly
seek to resolve factual disputes at the pleading stage.
Background and Relevant Law
RICO Elements and Pleading Standards
To state a civil RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), a plaintiff must allege:
(1) conduct, (2) of an enterprise, (3) through a pattern, (4) of racketeering
activity, and (5) injury to business or property by reason of the RICO
violation, with causation between the violation and the injury, as required by
18 U.S.C. § 1964(c) (Safe Streets Alliance v. Hickenlooper, 859 F.3d 865,

=== PAGE 10 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
880–81 (10th Cir. 2017); Deck v. Engineered Laminates, 349 F.3d 1253,
1256–57 (10th Cir. 2003)). Predicate acts must be violations of certain
enumerated statutes, including wire fraud and Travel Act violations (Snyder
v. Acord Corp., Civil Action No. 1:14-cv-01736-JLK (D. Colo. Jan 15, 2016)).
A “pattern” of racketeering activity requires at least two predicate acts
within ten years, but also demands that the acts be related and amount to,
or pose a threat of, continuing criminal activity (Hall v. Witteman, 584 F.3d
859, 867 (10th Cir. 2009); Sil-Flo, Inc. v. SFHC, Inc., 917 F.2d 1507, 1516
(10th Cir. 1990)). The “enterprise” element requires an ongoing
organization, formal or informal, with associates functioning as a continuing
unit, and the enterprise must be distinct from the pattern of racketeering
activity (Jeter v. Wild W. Gas, LLC, 12-cv-411-JDR-CDL, 15-cv-455-JDR-JFJ
(N.D. Okla. Jul 01, 2025); United States v. Sanders, 928 F.2d 940, 943–44
(10th Cir. 1991)).
Allegations of fraud as predicate acts must meet the heightened pleading
standard of Rule 9(b), which requires the plaintiff to state the circumstances
constituting fraud with particularity, including the time, place, content of the
false representation, identity of the party making the statement, and the
consequences (Koch v. Koch Industries Inc., 203 F.3d 1202, 1236 (10th Cir.
2000); Cayman Exploration Corp. v. United Gas Pipe Line Co., 873 F.2d
1357, 1362 (10th Cir. 1989)).
To have standing, the plaintiff must allege injury to business or property, not
merely personal or emotional harm (Lopez v. Marriott Int'l, Civil Action 23-
cv-03308-RMR-KAS (D. Colo. Feb 27, 2025); Joseph v. U.S. Pub. Defenders
Office, 2021 WL 5178642 (D.N.M. Nov. 9, 2021)).
Rule 12(b)(6) Standard
On a motion to dismiss, the court must accept all well-pleaded facts as true
and determine whether the complaint states a legally sufficient claim (Tal v.
Hogan, 453 F.3d 1244, 1252 (10th Cir. 2006)). The court does not weigh
evidence or resolve factual disputes at this stage.
Analysis
1. Enterprise
The defendant contends that an association-in-fact between two individuals
in a personal relationship cannot constitute a RICO enterprise. However, the
Tenth Circuit and Supreme Court have made clear that an “enterprise”
under RICO includes any group of individuals associated in fact, whether or
not they are a legal entity (United States v. Harris, 695 F.3d 1125, 1136
(10th Cir. 2012)). The key is whether the group has an ongoing organization,
a decision-making framework, and functions as a continuing unit, separate
from the pattern of racketeering activity (Jeter v. Wild W. Gas, LLC, 12-
cv-411-JDR-CDL, 15-cv-455-JDR-JFJ (N.D. Okla. Jul 01, 2025)).

=== PAGE 11 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Here, the plaintiff alleges that Myers and Branthoover operated as an
association-in-fact enterprise, with distinct roles (one as “inside” operative,
one as “outside” administrator), coordinated actions, and a continuing unit
over 18 months. These allegations, if true, are sufficient to plead the
existence of an enterprise at the motion to dismiss stage. The defendant’s
reliance on the personal nature of the relationship is misplaced; RICO does
not require the enterprise to be criminal in origin or to have a formal
structure (United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 583 (1981); United States
v. Harris, 695 F.3d 1125, 1136 (10th Cir. 2012)).
2. Pattern of Racketeering Activity
The defendant asserts that the alleged acts are too sporadic and limited in
duration to constitute a “pattern.” However, the complaint alleges multiple
related acts (wire fraud, Travel Act violations, fraudulent filings, and
threats) over an 18-month period, with both closed-ended continuity (a
series of acts over a substantial period) and open-ended continuity (alleged
ongoing threats and conduct). The Tenth Circuit has held that a pattern
requires related predicate acts and continuity, but does not require the
scheme to affect multiple victims or extend indefinitely (Hall v. Witteman,
584 F.3d 859, 867 (10th Cir. 2009); Sil-Flo, Inc. v. SFHC, Inc., 917 F.2d 1507,
1516 (10th Cir. 1990)). The plaintiff’s allegations, if accepted as true, are
sufficient to plead a pattern of racketeering activity.
3. Predicate Acts and Rule 9(b) Particularity
The defendant argues that the complaint fails to plead wire fraud and Travel
Act violations with particularity. Under Tenth Circuit law, Rule 9(b) requires
the plaintiff to specify the time, place, content, and identity of the fraudulent
acts (Koch v. Koch Industries Inc., 203 F.3d 1202, 1236 (10th Cir. 2000)).
The complaint details the date, amount, method, and participants in the wire
transfer, the communications between the parties, and the interstate nature
of the acts. It also describes the preparation and filing of allegedly
fraudulent documents, the roles of each defendant, and the sequence of
events. These allegations are sufficiently particular to satisfy Rule 9(b) at
the pleading stage (Cayman Exploration Corp. v. United Gas Pipe Line Co.,
873 F.2d 1357, 1362 (10th Cir. 1989)).
4. Injury to Business or Property
The defendant contends that the plaintiff’s injuries are speculative or
personal, not actionable under RICO. However, the complaint alleges a
specific financial loss ($1,576), business disruption, and quantified lost
revenue, all of which are recognized as injuries to business or property
under Tenth Circuit law (Lopez v. Marriott Int'l, Civil Action 23-cv-03308-
RMR-KAS (D. Colo. Feb 27, 2025); Robbins v. Wilkie, 300 F.3d 1208, 1210
(10th Cir. 2002)). While emotional distress and reputational harm are not
actionable, concrete financial losses are sufficient to confer standing
(Sensoria, LLC v. Kaweske, 581 F.Supp.3d 1243, 1252 (D. Colo. 2022)).

=== PAGE 12 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
5. Domestic Dispute Context
The defendant argues that courts routinely reject RICO claims arising from
domestic disputes. While courts are skeptical of attempts to recast family
law disputes as RICO claims, there is no categorical bar if the statutory
elements are met (Safe Streets Alliance v. Hickenlooper, 859 F.3d 865, 880–
81 (10th Cir. 2017)). The Supreme Court has rejected the notion that RICO
is limited to organized crime or requires a “racketeering injury” distinct
from the statutory elements (Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479,
495–97 (1985), as discussed in secondary materials). The key is whether the
complaint plausibly alleges the required elements, not the context of the
dispute.
6. Venue
The defendant claims venue is improper because most events occurred in
Texas. However, under 18 U.S.C. § 1965(a) and 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b), venue is
proper where any defendant resides or where a substantial part of the
events occurred. The complaint alleges that Branthoover resides in the
Western District of Oklahoma and that key acts (preparation of documents,
receipt of funds) occurred there. This is sufficient to establish venue at the
pleading stage.
7. Unauthorized Practice of Law and Procedural Issues
The defendant’s correction of the motion caption does not, by itself,
establish unauthorized practice of law or further a RICO conspiracy.
However, the plaintiff’s allegations about this conduct are relevant to the
overall pattern and enterprise, and the court must accept them as true at
this stage (Tal v. Hogan, 453 F.3d 1244, 1252 (10th Cir. 2006)).
Exceptions and Caveats
If, after discovery, the plaintiff cannot substantiate the alleged business
losses or the continuity of the racketeering activity, the claim may fail
at summary judgment (Sensoria, LLC v. Kaweske, 581 F.Supp.3d 1243,
1252 (D. Colo. 2022)).
If the court finds that the alleged acts are too closely tied to the
dissolution of the marriage and do not amount to criminal conduct, it
may ultimately dismiss the RICO claim, but this is a factual
determination not appropriate at the pleading stage.
Some cited authorities (e.g., Condict v. Condict, 815 F.2d 579 (10th Cir.
1987)) have been superseded or limited, but the core requirements for
pleading a RICO claim remain as stated above.
Conclusion
The defendant’s motion to dismiss overstates the deficiencies in the
plaintiff’s complaint and misapplies the relevant legal standards. The
plaintiff’s allegations, if accepted as true, are sufficiently detailed and
• 
• 
• 

=== PAGE 13 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
plausible to state a RICO claim under Tenth Circuit law, including the
existence of an enterprise, a pattern of racketeering activity, predicate acts
pled with particularity, and concrete injury to business or property. The
domestic context of the dispute does not, by itself, preclude a RICO claim if
the statutory elements are met. Accordingly, the motion to dismiss should be
denied, and the case should proceed to discovery.

U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
A violation of section 1962(c) thus 'requires (1) conduct (2) of an enterprise
(3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity.' Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex
Co., 473 U.S. 479, 105 S.Ct. 3275, 3285, 87 L.Ed.2d 346 (1985). RICO
defines racketeering activity as, inter alia, any act that is indictable under
18 U.S.C. Sec. 1341 (mail fraud) or 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1343 (wire fraud). See 18
U.S.C. Sec. 1961(1)(B). RICO also states that a 'pattern of racketeering
activity' requires at least two acts of racketeering activity.
Summary
To establish a RICO violation under section 1962(c), a plaintiff must
demonstrate conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering
activity. This requires at least two acts of racketeering activity, which can
include wire fraud. The passage also highlights the importance of
demonstrating continuity and the threat of ongoing illegal conduct to
establish a pattern. This is relevant to the question as it provides the legal
framework for evaluating whether the plaintiff's allegations meet the
requirements for a RICO claim.
Deck v. Engineered Laminates, 349 F.3d 1253 (10th Cir. 2003)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
RICO provides certain advantages to plaintiffs, but it also presents
substantial hurdles for plaintiffs to overcome to establish a proper claim. Of
specific concern on this appeal, RICO requires the plaintiff to prove that the
defendants committed at least two predicate acts (violations of criminal
statutes listed in RICO, § 1961(1)) and that the plaintiff has suffered injury to
his business or property as a result of those predicate acts. Defendants have
challenged whether some of the acts alleged by Plaintiff are proper RICO
predicate acts and whether Plaintiff has alleged cognizable injury to his
business or property. We agree in part with Defendants. We hold that

=== PAGE 14 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
witness tampering in a state-court proceeding is not a RICO predicate act.
We also hold that although extortion is a proper predicate act, a claim of
extortion cannot be based on mere abusive litigation. On the other hand,
mail fraud and wire fraud are proper predicate acts (a proposition not
challenged by Defendants), and we hold that Plaintiff has adequately alleged
that fraud injured his business or property. In particular, Plaintiff had a
property interest in a cause of action allegedly prejudiced by the fraud; and
restrictions on his competing with Defendants (which allegedly were
imposed by a fraudulently induced agreement) would constitute an injury to
his business.
Summary
The Tenth Circuit requires that for a RICO claim, the plaintiff must prove at
least two predicate acts and show injury to business or property resulting
from those acts. The court recognizes mail fraud and wire fraud as proper
predicate acts, but not witness tampering in state-court proceedings or
extortion based on abusive litigation. The plaintiff must also demonstrate a
cognizable injury to business or property, which can include a property
interest in a cause of action or restrictions on business competition due to
fraud.
United States v. Harris, 695 F.3d 1125 (10th Cir. 2012)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
RICO provides that '[i]t shall be unlawful for any person employed by or
associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect,
interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or
indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of
racketeering activity....' 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). An 'enterprise,' in turn,
'includes any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal
entity, and any union or group of individuals associated in fact although not
a legal entity.' Id. § 1961(4) (emphasis added). In United States v. Turkette,
the Supreme Court elaborated on the requirements of an 'enterprise' and
cautioned that 'enterprise' and 'pattern of racketeering activity' were
distinct elements of a substantive RICO violation. See 452 U.S. 576, 583, 101
S.Ct. 2524, 69 L.Ed.2d 246 (1981). In order to secure a conviction under
RICO, the Government must prove both the existence of an 'enterprise' and
the connected 'pattern of racketeering activity.' The enterprise is an
entity, ... a group of persons associated together for a common purpose of
engaging in a course of conduct. The pattern of racketeering activity is, on
the other hand, a series of criminal acts as defined by the statute.
Summary
For a RICO violation, there must be both an "enterprise" and a "pattern of
racketeering activity." The enterprise must be an entity or group of

=== PAGE 15 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
individuals associated for a common purpose, and the pattern of
racketeering activity must consist of a series of criminal acts. This
distinction is crucial in determining whether the plaintiff's allegations meet
the requirements for a RICO claim.

Kaplan v. Reed, 28 F.Supp.2d 1191 (D. Colo. 1998)
U.S. District Court — District of Colorado
Extract
RICO defines 'racketeering activity' as any act in violation of specified state
and federal statutes, including the crime of mail fraud. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1).
An individual must commit a minimum of two predicate acts to be liable
under § 1962(c). 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5). Plaintiffs allege that Cynthia Reed has
committed two or more predicate acts of mail fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C.
§ 1341. The elements of the offense of mail fraud are: '(1) the devising of a
scheme or artifice to defraud or obtain money or property by false
pretenses, representations or promises; (2) the specific intent to defraud;
and (3) use of the United States Mails for the purpose of executing the
scheme.'

Summary
Elements required to establish mail fraud as a predicate act, which includes
devising a scheme to defraud, specific intent to defraud, and use of the mails
to execute the scheme. This is relevant to the question as it provides the
legal standard for what constitutes a predicate act under RICO, which is
central to determining whether the defendant's motion to dismiss is
justified.

Summary
Necessary elements to establish a civil RICO claim, which includes the

Extract
RICO allows private parties to bring civil actions for treble damages for
violations of sections 1962(c) and (d). See 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c). 'To state a
RICO claim, a plaintiff must allege that the defendant violated the
substantive RICO statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1962[(c)], by setting forth four

Summary
Requirements for a RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) and (d), which
include alleging conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering
activity. It also notes that a conspiracy to commit a RICO violation is itself a
violation if the conspirator adopts the goal of furthering the enterprise. This
is relevant to the question as it provides the legal framework for evaluating
whether the plaintiff's complaint sufficiently alleges a RICO claim.

facts in the complaint as distinguished from conclusory allegations.' Mitchell
v. King, 537 F.2d 385, 386 (10th Cir.1976). 'The court's function on a Rule

(quotation omitted). The legal sufficiency of a complaint under Rule 12(b)(6)
is a question of law which this Court reviews de novo.
Summary
The passage explains the standard for evaluating a motion to dismiss under
Rule 12(b)(6) in the Tenth Circuit. It emphasizes that the court must accept
all well-pleaded facts as true and determine whether the complaint states a
legally sufficient claim. The court does not consider potential evidence but
focuses on the legal sufficiency of the complaint itself. This standard is
crucial in assessing whether the plaintiff's RICO claims are adequately
pleaded.

Extract
The elements of federal mail fraud as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 1341 are (1) a
scheme or artifice to defraud or obtain property by means of false or
fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, (2) an intent to defraud,
and (3) use of the mails to execute the scheme. See United States v. Haber,

=== PAGE 18 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
251 F.3d 881, 887 (10th Cir.2001). The first and second elements of federal
mail and wire fraud are identical. The third element of wire fraud as defined
in 18 U.S.C. § 1343 is the use of interstate wire or radio communications to
execute the scheme. See United States v. Smith, 133 F.3d 737, 742 (10th Cir.
1997).
Summary
Elements necessary to establish mail and wire fraud, which are relevant to
the Plaintiff's allegations of wire fraud in the RICO claim. The Plaintiff must
demonstrate a scheme to defraud, intent to defraud, and use of interstate
communications to execute the scheme. The Defendant's argument that the
Plaintiff's allegations lack specificity under Rule 9(b) can be evaluated
against these elements to determine if the Plaintiff has sufficiently pled the
wire fraud claim.
Safe Streets Alliance v. Hickenlooper, 859 F.3d 865 (10th Cir. 2017)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
That is, RICO vests a private citizen with substantive rights to avoid
'injur[ies]' to 'his business or property' caused by a pattern of racketeering
activity, and it explicitly creates a federal cause of action to vindicate those
federal rights. 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c). To maintain a cause of action under §
1964(c), a plaintiff must plead and ultimately prove: (1) that the defendant
violated § 1962 ; (2) that the plaintiff's business or property was injured; and
(3) that the defendant's violation is the cause of that injury. Id. ; see RJR, 136

Torwest DBC, Inc. v. Dick, 628 F.Supp. 163 (D. Colo. 1986)

Extract
A 'pattern of racketeering activity' as defined in the statute 'requires at least
two acts of racketeering activity, one of which occurred after the effective
date of this chapter ... and the last of which occurred within ten years
(excluding any period of imprisonment) after the commission of a prior act
of racketeering activity.' 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5). The principal question left
open in the Sedima opinion is whether the courts may develop a more
complete definition of a pattern of racketeering activity in applying RICO. It

=== PAGE 19 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
is the view of this court that the Supreme Court strongly suggested that this
element is an appropriate area for further consideration by the language of
footnote 14, as follows: As many commentators have pointed out, the
definition of 'pattern of racketeering activity' differs from the other
provisions in § 1961 in that it states that a pattern 'requires at least two acts
of racketeering activity.' § 1961(5)...
Summary
The definition of a "pattern of racketeering activity" under RICO requires at
least two acts of racketeering activity. However, the courts have room to
further define what constitutes a "pattern," as suggested by the Supreme
Court. This implies that simply having two acts may not be sufficient; there
must be continuity and relationship between the acts. The passage suggests
that the courts can develop a more nuanced understanding of what
constitutes a pattern, which is relevant to determining whether the
plaintiff's allegations meet the RICO requirements.
Bache Halsey Stuart Shields v. Tracy Collins Bank, 558 F.Supp. 1042 (D.
Utah 1983)
U.S. District Court — District of Utah
Extract
Thus, to properly plead an action under the treble damages provision of
RICO, a party must allege two acts of 'racketeering' with enough specificity
to show there is probable cause the crimes were committed. An offense is
not 'indictable' merely because it is alleged. Rather, to be indictable it must
be 'well-founded' and based on probable cause. ... A private civil action
under RICO is grounded upon the premise that a party has twice engaged in
'racketeering activity'. The Act defines 'racketeering activity' as behavior
'indictable' under specified provisions of the United States Code. Before a
court can assess the merit of a plaintiff's treble damages claim it must
determine whether there is probable cause to believe the named defendant
committed the alleged predicate crimes. That determination is possible only
if the factual basis of those 'acts of racketeering' is set out with particularity.
Thus, a factual statement similar to a bill of particulars is needed in
pleadings that allege a violation of the RICO treble damages provision.
Summary
Necessity for a plaintiff to allege two acts of racketeering with enough
specificity to show probable cause that the crimes were committed. It
emphasizes that an offense is not indictable merely because it is alleged; it
must be well-founded and based on probable cause. This requirement is
crucial for a RICO claim, as the court must determine whether there is
probable cause to believe the defendant committed the alleged predicate
crimes. The passage also highlights the need for a factual statement similar

to a bill of particulars in pleadings that allege a violation of the RICO treble
damages provision.
Farlow v. Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co., 956 F.2d 982 (10th Cir. 1992)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
Under Rule 9(b), plaintiffs must sufficiently allege each element of a RICO
violation and its predicate acts of racketeering with particularity, a
requirement justified by the 'threat of treble damages and injury to
reputation.' Cayman Exploration Corp. v. United Gas Pipe Line, 873 F.2d
1357, 1362 (10th Cir.1989). The trial court correctly found that the plaintiffs
'wholly failed to allege any violation of RICO with the particularity required
by Rule 9(b).'
Summary
Failure to meet this standard can result in dismissal of the complaint.
Condict v. Condict, 815 F.2d 579 (10th Cir. 1987)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
The district court in dismissing the action and entering judgment for the
defendants held that the complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief
could be granted. Specifically, the district court held that the complaint
failed to allege the following: (1) that activities of the defendants were in
furtherance of a tie to organized crime or with criminal activities of an
organized nature; (2) that the defendants, or any of them, have been
convicted of the predicate acts of mail or wire fraud upon which the RICO
claim is founded; (3) that the plaintiffs suffered a 'distinct RICO injury'; and
(4) that the predicate acts of mail and wire fraud were not pleaded with
sufficient particularity. Further, the district court concluded that the Condict
Ranch partnership is not an 'enterprise' within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. Sec.
1962.
Summary
The Tenth Circuit requires that a RICO claim must allege a connection to
organized crime or criminal activities of an organized nature, and that the
predicate acts must be pleaded with sufficient particularity. Additionally,
there is no requirement for a distinct RICO injury or prior conviction of
predicate acts, as clarified by the Supreme Court in Sedima. This aligns with
the defendant's argument that the plaintiff's complaint lacks the necessary

elements to establish a RICO claim, such as a plausible enterprise and a
pattern of racketeering activity.
Hall v. Witteman, 584 F.3d 859 (10th Cir. 2009)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
In order to bring a RICO claim, a plaintiff must allege a violation of 18 U.S.C.
§ 1962, which consists of four elements: (1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3)
through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity." Gillmor v. Thomas, 490 F.3d
791, 797 (10th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). A "`pattern of
racketeering activity' requires at least two acts of racketeering activity." 18
U.S.C. § 1961(5). Those acts, commonly referred to as "predicate acts," must
be violations of certain statutes. See id. § 1961(1). Mr. Hall's complaint
alleges violations of federal mail-fraud, wire-fraud, and extortion statutes.
Although the district court held those allegation to be inadequate, we need
not address that issue. Even if the allegations of predicate acts were
adequate, we agree with the district court that the complaint does not
adequately allege a "pattern" of racketeering activity because it fails to
allege sufficient continuity to sustain a RICO claim. "RICO is not aimed at
the isolated offender." Tal v. Hogan, 453 F.3d 1244, 1267 (10th Cir.2006)
(internal quotation marks omitted). To satisfy RICO's pattern requirement,
Mr. Hall needed to allege not only that the defendants had committed two or
more predicate acts, but also "that the predicates themselves amount to, or
that they otherwise constitute a threat of, continuing racketeering activity."
H.J. Inc. v. Nw. Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 240, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106 L.Ed.2d
195 (1989). As the district court concluded, however, At best, what plaintiff
alleges is a closed-ended series of predicate acts constituting a single
scheme to accomplish a discrete goal [publication of the Responsive
Advertisement in lieu of Plaintiff's Advertisement] directed at only one
individual [the plaintiff] with no potential to extend to other persons or
entities.
Summary
The Tenth Circuit requires that a RICO claim must allege a violation of 18
U.S.C. § 1962, which includes conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of
racketeering activity. A pattern requires at least two predicate acts that
amount to or constitute a threat of continuing racketeering activity. The
court in Hall v. Witteman found that the plaintiff's allegations did not
demonstrate sufficient continuity to establish a pattern, as they were part of
a closed-ended series of acts with no potential to extend beyond the
individual plaintiff. This suggests that isolated or discrete acts targeting a
single individual without broader implications do not satisfy the RICO
pattern requirement.

Jul 01, 2025)
U.S. District Court — Northern District of Oklahoma
Extract
As a preliminary matter, Plaintiffs have failed to set forth facts that would
permit the Court to find the existence of a RICO enterprise: 'To establish an
enterprise, [Plaintiffs must show (1) an ongoing organization with a decision-
making framework or mechanism for controlling the group; (2) with
associates that function as a continuing unit; and (3) which is separate and
apart from the pattern of racketeering activity.' Waddell & Reed Fin., Inc. v.
Torchmark Corp., 223 F.R.D. 566, 600 (D. Kan. 2004) (citing United States v.
Sanders, 928 F.2d 940, 943-44 (10th Cir. 1991)). It is not enough to point to
a group of entities and cry 'enterprise.' Plaintiffs must point to an 'ongoing
structure of persons associated through time, joined in purpose, and
organized in a manner amenable to hierarchical or consensual decision-
making.'
Summary
To establish a RICO enterprise, the plaintiff must demonstrate an ongoing
organization with a decision-making framework, associates functioning as a
continuing unit, and a structure separate from the pattern of racketeering
activity. This is a stringent requirement that the plaintiff must meet to
succeed in a RICO claim.

RICO vests a private citizen with substantive rights to avoid ‘injur[ies]' to
‘his business or property' caused by a pattern of racketeering activity, and it
explicitly creates a federal cause of action to vindicate those federal rights.”
Safe Sts. All. v. Hickenlooper, 859 F.3d 865, 881 (10th Cir. 2017) (citing 18

Sensoria, LLC v. Kaweske, 581 F.Supp.3d 1243 (D. Colo. 2022)
U.S. District Court — District of Colorado
Extract
In order to maintain a civil RICO action for damages, a plaintiff must plead
injury 'in his business or property.' ... Without the required type of injury,
Plaintiffs lack standing to assert a RICO claim. ... A required predicate to a
RICO claim is the occurrence of racketeering activity in violation of 18
U.S.C. § 1962(c). ... To establish the 'pattern' element, a plaintiff not only
must show multiple predicate acts, 'but also that the predicates themselves
amount to, or that they otherwise constitute a threat of, continuing
racketeering activity.'
Summary
For a civil RICO claim to be valid, the plaintiff must demonstrate an injury to
business or property and establish a pattern of racketeering activity. The
pattern must include multiple predicate acts that amount to or constitute a
threat of continuing racketeering activity. This aligns with the defendant's
argument that the plaintiff's allegations do not meet the RICO requirements,
as they lack a pattern of racketeering activity and the necessary type of
injury.

Summary
Requirements for a RICO claim to be valid, including the need for a
connection to organized crime, conviction of predicate acts, a distinct RICO
injury, and particularity in pleading predicate acts. The passage also
emphasizes the need for an "enterprise" under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1962. These
requirements are relevant to assessing whether the plaintiff's complaint in
the current case meets the necessary criteria for a RICO claim.
Joseph v. U.S. Pub. Defenders Office
U.S. District Court — District of New Mexico
Extract
The RICO statute creates a private civil cause of action that allows '[a]ny
person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section
1962' to sue in federal district court and recover treble damages, costs, and
attorney's fees. 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c); RJR Nabisco, Inc. v. Eur. Cmty., 579 U.S.
325 (2016). To maintain a cause of action under § 1964(c), a plaintiff must
plead and ultimately prove that: (1) the defendant violated § 1962; (2) the
plaintiff's business or property was injured; and (3) the defendant's violation
is the cause of that injury. 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c); RJR Nabisco, 136 S.Ct. at
2096-97; Safe Streets All. v. Hickenlooper, 859 F.3d 865, 881 (10th Cir.

Summary
Requirements for a RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c), which include
proving a violation of § 1962, injury to business or property, and causation of
that injury by the violation. It also emphasizes that standing to bring a RICO
claim requires injury to business or property. This is relevant to the Tenth
Circuit as it cites Safe Streets All. v. Hickenlooper and Robbins v. Wilkie,

Extract
To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a civil RICO claim must allege '(1)
conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity.' Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479, 496, 105 S.Ct. 3275,
3285, 87 L.Ed.2d 346 (1985) (footnote omitted). The district court
determined that Cayman's amended complaint failed to state a claim under
RICO because the complaint did not (1) allege the predicate racketeering
activity, mail fraud, with particularity under Rule 9(b), Fed.R.Civ.P., or (2)
allege sufficient facts of a pattern of racketeering activity.
Summary
For a civil RICO claim to survive a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6),
the complaint must allege conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of
racketeering activity with particularity. The court in the Cayman case found
that the complaint failed because it did not allege the predicate acts with
sufficient detail, which is a requirement under Rule 9(b) for fraud-based
RICO claims. This is relevant to the current case because the defendant
argues that the plaintiff's complaint lacks the necessary particularity in
alleging wire fraud and Travel Act violations as predicate acts.

To successfully state a RICO claim, a plaintiff must allege four elements: '(1)
conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering

Co. Inc., 194 F.3d 1089, 1100 (10th Cir.1999). The district court specifically
held that for purposes of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion Appellant sufficiently pled
all four RICO elements. However, the district court granted Defendants'
Rule 12(b)(6) motion on Appellant's RICO claim based on Appellant's failure
to prove standing. Plaintiffs who bring civil RICO claims pursuant to 18
U.S.C. § 1962 must show damage to their business or property as a result of
defendants' conduct. See Sedima, 473 U.S. at 496 (RICO plaintiff only has
standing if 'he has been injured in his business or property by the conduct
constituting the violation'). Because Appellant failed to allege any tangible
harm to his business or property, the district court held his RICO claim
'nonviable.' Aplt.App. at 116. We cannot agree with the district court that
Appellant 'absolutely failed to carry his burden of pleading any harm to
business or property as a result of the alleged RICO violation.' Id. There are
several references to business or property damage which allegedly resulted
from Defendants' activities. Examples include allegations that various
Defendants took actions that adversely affected his business, caused
resource damage, interfered with guest ranch operations, caused grievous
economic injury, economic loss, and property damage. See id. at 33-34, 37,

48. Such allegations are sufficient to show standing, especially at this stage
of the litigation.
Summary
Requirements for a RICO claim, emphasizing the need for a plaintiff to
allege conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. It
also highlights the necessity for plaintiffs to demonstrate tangible harm to
business or property to establish standing. The Tenth Circuit found that
general allegations of business or property damage could suffice at the
pleading stage, contrary to the district court's dismissal for lack of standing.

In order to secure a conviction under RICO, the Government must prove
both the existence of an 'enterprise' and the connected 'pattern of

2524, 2528-2529, 69 L.Ed.2d 246 (1981). Under Turkette, the existence of
an enterprise is proved 'by evidence of an ongoing organization, formal or
informal, and by evidence that the various associates function as a
continuing unit.' Id. The issues of ongoing organization, continuing
membership and an enterprise existing apart from the underlying pattern of
racketeering are factual questions for the jury.

Summary
Essential elements required to bring a RICO claim, which include conduct of
an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity, and at least two
predicate acts. It also emphasizes the necessity for the plaintiff to
demonstrate injury to business or property as a result of the defendant's
actions. This is directly relevant to the question as it provides the legal
framework for evaluating the sufficiency of a RICO claim, which is central to
the defendant's motion to dismiss.

RICO provides a private right of action in federal court for individuals
injured in their business or property through fraudulent conduct. A RICO
plaintiff must prove “(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern

Sil-Flo, Inc. v. SFHC, Inc., 917 F.2d 1507 (10th Cir. 1990)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
Sil-Flo, Inc.'s final argument in this appeal is that the district court erred in
granting the defendants' pretrial motion for summary judgment on its RICO
claim. The court dismissed this claim after it permitted the plaintiffs to
amend their complaint and to file a RICO case statement, finding that it
consist[ed] of allegations which, when construed in a light most favorable to
the Plaintiffs, set forth a series of acts which do not constitute a pattern of
racketeering activity as is required by the RICO Act. The allegations
amount, basically, to a very limited course of conduct. The conduct is limited

=== PAGE 28 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
both with respect to continuity over time and with respect to the extent the
world outside the alleged enterprise was affected. The Plaintiffs describe a
single scam affecting a single mark, that is, Mr. Ceparano. What occurred
with that single scam cannot be subdivided into separate acts for the
purpose of setting up a RICO claim.
Summary
The Tenth Circuit requires that for a RICO claim to be valid, there must be a
pattern of racketeering activity, which involves more than a limited course of
conduct. The conduct must show continuity over time and affect the world
outside the alleged enterprise. A single scam affecting a single individual
does not meet the requirements for a RICO claim, as it lacks the necessary
pattern of racketeering activity.

This court reviews a district court's Rule 9(b) ruling de novo and confines its
analysis to the text of the complaint. See Schwartz v. Celestial Seasonings,
Inc., 124 F.3d 1246, 1251 (10th Cir. 1997). Rule 9(b) provides, 'In all
averments of fraud or mistake, the circumstances constituting fraud or
mistake shall be stated with particularity. Malice, intent, knowledge, and
other conditions of mind of a person may be averred generally.' Fed. R. Civ.
P. 9(b). More specifically, this court requires a complaint alleging fraud to
'set forth the time, place and contents of the false representation, the
identity of the party making the false statements and the consequences
thereof.' Lawrence Nat'l Bank v. Edmonds (In re Edmonds), 924 F.2d 176,
180 (10th Cir. 1991).
Summary
In the Tenth Circuit, a complaint alleging fraud must meet the heightened
pleading standard of Rule 9(b). This requires the plaintiff to state the
circumstances of the fraud with particularity, including the time, place, and
contents of the false representation, the identity of the party making the
false statements, and the consequences thereof. This standard is crucial in
determining whether the plaintiff's allegations of wire fraud and Travel Act
violations are sufficiently detailed to survive a motion to dismiss.

Extract
Shortly after Haroco, the Supreme Court rejected a special standing
requirement for civil RICO plaintiffs in Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., Inc.
The fact pattern in Sedima also did not involve organized crime. The dispute
arose when a joint international venture between the Belgian company,
Sedima, and the New York company, Imrex, went awry. Sedima alleged that
Imrex committed 'violations of [sections] 1962(c), based on ... mail and wire
fraud' when Imrex 'present[ed] inflated bills, cheating Sedima out of a
portion of its proceeds by collecting for nonexistent expenses.' The Court
rejected the Second Circuit's amorphous 'organized crime' standing
requirement that demanded a RICO plaintiff to 'allege a 'racketeering
injury'--
Summary
The Supreme Court has interpreted RICO broadly, rejecting the need for a
plaintiff to demonstrate a connection to organized crime or a specific
"racketeering injury." This suggests that RICO can apply to a wide range of
disputes, not just those involving traditional organized crime. The Court's
decision in Sedima implies that the plaintiff's allegations of wire fraud and
other predicate acts could potentially support a RICO claim, even if the
context is a domestic dispute, as long as the statutory elements are met.

Robert W. Dibert
Extract
5.5 General Elements of Section 1962(c) Section 1962(c) of RICO prohibits
the conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. To
prove liability under section 1962(c), the plaintiff must establish each of the
following elements by a preponderance of the evidence: First, that the
defendant was a person employed by or associated with an enterprise that
the plaintiff alleges to be [identify the enterprise]; Second, that [the
enterprise] was engaged in, ... 5.9 Racketeering Activity The next term I will
define for you is the term “act of racketeering activity.” An act of
racketeering activity includes any act or threat that is indictable as a
violation of certain federal statutes, or chargeable under certain state
criminal laws. Here, the plaintiff contends that defendant engaged in
[describe the RICO violations that are alleged]. COMMENT As noted in
Section 5.1 supra, 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1) identifies the RICO predicate “acts of
racketeering activity.” The most commonly charged RICO predicate acts are
mail fraud and wire fraud, 18 U.S.C. §§ 1341, 1343. The elements of proof
necessary to establish mail or wire fraud predicates are set forth in Section
5.10, infra. 5.10 Mail or Wire Fraud 5.10.1 General Elements of Mail or
Fraud The plaintiff has charged the defendant with mail [wire] fraud as a

predicate act under RICO. Under 18 U.S.C. § 1341 [1343], a person who has
devised or intended to devise a scheme or artifice to defraud, or to obtain
money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses,
representations, or promises, and who uses the mails [or interstate wire
communications] to execute or attempt to execute the scheme or artifice to
defraud, has committed mail [wire] fraud. To state a violation of the mail
[wire] fraud statute, plaintiff must establish each of the following elements:
(a) The ... 5.11 Pattern of Racketeering Activity 5.11.1 Definition Now I will
define the term “pattern of racketeering activity.” A pattern of racketeering
activity requires at least two acts of racketeering activity within ten years of
each other [one of which must have occurred after October 15, 1970]. Those
acts must be related to each other, and must also amount to, or pose a
threat of, continuing criminal activity. [Here, describe the alleged pattern of
racketeering activity.] In determining whether these alleged acts, if proved,
constituted a pattern of racketeering activity, you should consider the
following factors. First, acts are “related” within the meaning of RICO if
they embrace criminal acts that have the same or ...
Summary
General elements required to establish a RICO claim under Section 1962(c),
which includes proving the existence of an enterprise, a pattern of
racketeering activity, and specific predicate acts such as mail or wire fraud.
The passage also emphasizes the need for acts to be related and pose a
threat of continuing criminal activity to constitute a pattern of racketeering
activity.

Extract
Courts agree that to establish standing under [sections] 1962(c),(393) a
plaintiff must have suffered a harm caused by one of the predicate acts
covered by [sections] 1962(c).(394) This rule significantly limits standing.
For example, a person wrongfully discharged for refusing to participate in a
pattern of racketeering activity lacks standing to sue under [sections]
1962(c) because the harm suffered is caused by the termination, not the
predicate acts of racketeering.(395)
Summary
For a plaintiff to have standing under section 1962(c) of RICO, they must
demonstrate that the harm they suffered was directly caused by one of the
predicate acts of racketeering. This requirement significantly limits who can
bring a RICO claim, as the harm must be directly linked to the racketeering
activity itself, not merely related to it or caused by other factors.

Douglass, Sean M. - 2011-03-22
Extract
To prosecute a defendant under RICO, the government must prove that the
defendant: (i) through the commission of two or more acts constituting a
pattern of racketeering activity; (ii) directly or indirectly invested in,
maintained an interest in, or participated in, an enterprise; (iii) the activities
of which affected interstate or foreign commerce.
Summary
For a RICO claim to be valid, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the
defendant engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity, participated in an
enterprise, and that the enterprise's activities affected interstate or foreign
commerce. This aligns with the requirements under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) and
(d), which are central to the plaintiff's claims in the case. The defendant's
argument that the plaintiff's complaint fails to establish a RICO claim hinges
on whether these elements are sufficiently alleged.
'Plausible' Deniability
Litigation - American Bar Association - Michael J. Miarmi -

Extract
With plausibility, context matters. As the Tenth Circuit has explained
(echoing the Third Circuit), 'the degree of specificity necessary to establish
plausibility and fair notice, and therefore the need to include sufficient
factual allegations, depends on context.'
Summary
In the Tenth Circuit, the determination of whether a complaint states a
plausible claim for relief involves a context-specific inquiry. This means that
the degree of specificity required in the allegations depends on the context
of the case. The court must draw on its judicial experience and common
sense to assess whether the allegations are sufficient to state a plausible
claim.
RICO: A Primer

=== PAGE 32 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
The heart of a RICO case is the existence of a pattern of racketeering
activity. Under the statute, 'racketeering activity' includes a host of offenses.
Section 1961 defines the phrase to include any crime listed in subdivisions
A, B, C, D, E, F, or G of section 1961... A RICO enterprise includes 'any
individual, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, and
any union or group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal
entity.' Courts have interpreted 'enterprise' broadly, and the definition
captures both legitimate and illegitimate enterprises. The statutory list is
not exhaustive but merely illustrative... A 'pattern' may exist where any
combination of two or more offenses occurred within a period of time. In
Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479, the Supreme Court held that the
RICO pattern element requires more than merely proving two predicate acts
of racketeering. Rather, proof of 'continuity plus relationship' is necessary.
Nonetheless, the Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized that Congress
had a fairly flexible concept of a pattern in mind.
Summary
Requirements for establishing a RICO claim, emphasizing the need for a
"pattern of racketeering activity" and the existence of an "enterprise." The
definition of "enterprise" is broad and includes both legitimate and
illegitimate entities. The "pattern" requires more than just two predicate
acts; it requires "continuity plus relationship." This information is crucial in
evaluating whether the Plaintiff's allegations meet the RICO requirements.
RICO: A Primer
Extract
A plaintiff is required to demonstrate that the defendant conducted the
affairs of an enterprise though a pattern of racketeering activity. The person
and the enterprise generally must be distinct; but, of course, a Rico person
can be a part of an enterprise. A RICO enterprise includes 'any individual,
partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or
group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.' Courts
have interpreted 'enterprise' broadly, and the definition captures both
legitimate and illegitimate enterprises. The statutory list is not exhaustive
but merely illustrative. A 'pattern' may exist where any combination of two
or more offenses occurred within a period of time. In Sedima, S.P.R.L. v.
Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479, the Supreme Court held that the RICO pattern
element requires more than merely proving two predicate acts of
racketeering. Rather, proof of 'continuity plus relationship' is necessary.
Nonetheless, the Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized that Congress
had a fairly flexible concept of a pattern in mind.

Summary
The passage provides insight into the requirements for establishing a RICO
claim, specifically the need for a distinct enterprise and a pattern of
racketeering activity. The definition of an enterprise is broad and can
include both legitimate and illegitimate entities. The pattern of racketeering
activity requires more than just two predicate acts; it requires continuity
and a relationship between the acts. This information is relevant to
determining whether the plaintiff's allegations in the case meet the
requirements for a RICO claim.
Defending Civil RICO Claims: A Defense Plan Should Be In Every Business's
Arsenal
Extract
Civil RICO actions are now ubiquitous, so much so that plaintiffs often
attempt to apply the statute to situations that bear little resemblance to the
criminal racketeering activity animating the enactment of the statute in the
first place... RICO is not a simple statute. It pertains to conduct associated
with an 'enterprise' and 'a pattern racketeering activity.' An enterprise is an
individual or legal entity, or a union or group of individuals associated in fact
although not a legal entity, while a pattern of racketeering activity requires
long-term, organized conduct to violate state and federal laws... First, to
bring a civil RICO claim, a plaintiff must demonstrate that their business or
property was injured as a result of a RICO violation. In other words, there
must be some sort of concrete financial loss directly flowing from the
purported violation to support a RICO claim. Thus, if a plaintiff does not
have a concrete financial loss, then the RICO claim must be dismissed.
Asserting personal injuries, such as emotion distress, is insufficient. Second,
to prove most types of RICO claims, the plaintiff must plead that the
defendant committed some qualifying criminal action, the most common of
which is mail, wire or securities fraud. Business deals gone sour do not
count. Rather, the plaintiff must be able to prove the elements of the
asserted crime, and often an intent to defraud. If there is nothing criminal in
nature about the complained-of conduct, RICO should not apply. It is an
abuse of the RICO statute to attempt to shoehorn ordinary business or
contractual disputes into a civil RICO claim.
Summary
General overview of the requirements for a civil RICO claim, emphasizing
that the statute is often misapplied to situations that do not involve the type
of criminal racketeering activity it was designed to address. It highlights the
necessity for a plaintiff to demonstrate concrete financial loss, the need for
the defendant to have committed a qualifying criminal action, and the
requirement for a pattern of racketeering activity. The passage suggests that
if these elements are not met, the RICO claim should be dismissed.
