Question
The Order of Assignment dated May 6, 2025, assigned a judge to rule on a
recusal motion against Judge Kaitcer, even though the operative motion did
not seek his recusal. Due process requires that parties receive notice and an
opportunity to be heard on the specific issues before the court. Assigning a
judge to rule on a non-existent motion against a party violates fundamental
due process (Walker v. Packer, 827 S.W.2d 833, 840 (Tex. 1992)). This
procedural error prejudices the respondent and further demonstrates the
presiding judge’s inability or unwillingness to follow the law, supporting the
necessity of recusal.
Answer (Texas)
Short response
Assigning a judge to rule on a recusal motion against Judge Kaitcer when no
such motion was pending constitutes a significant procedural error under
Texas law, violating due process by depriving parties of notice and an
opportunity to be heard on the actual issues before the court. This error not
only prejudices the respondent but also supports the argument that the
presiding judge is unable or unwilling to follow the law, thereby justifying
recusal.
Summary
Texas law imposes strict procedural requirements for handling motions to
recuse, mandating that a judge either recuse themselves or refer the motion
to another judge, regardless of the motion’s sufficiency. When a judge is
assigned to rule on a recusal motion that does not exist, this action exceeds
the court’s authority, undermines due process, and renders subsequent
judicial actions void.
The authorities make clear that due process in the context of recusal
requires both the existence of a proper motion and strict adherence to
procedural rules. Assigning a judge to address a non-existent motion not
only deprives parties of their right to notice and an opportunity to be heard
but also constitutes a clear and prejudicial error of law. Such procedural
missteps are grounds for mandamus relief and support the necessity of
recusal to preserve the integrity of the judicial process.
Background and Relevant Law
Case Law
The Texas courts have repeatedly emphasized the importance of strict
compliance with procedural rules governing judicial recusal. The leading

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
authority, as cited in the question, is Walker v. Packer, 827 S.W.2d 833 (Tex.
1992), which establishes that mandamus relief is available when a trial court
abuses its discretion, either by making an arbitrary decision or by
committing a clear and prejudicial error of law.
Building on this, In re Norman, 191 S.W.3d 858 (Tex. App. 2006) clarifies
that under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a, a judge who is the subject of a
recusal motion has a mandatory duty to either recuse themselves or refer
the motion to the presiding judge. The court in Norman further explains that
even if a recusal motion is procedurally defective, the judge must still follow
this process, and any failure to do so renders all subsequent actions by the
judge void.
Similarly, Greenberg, Fisk & Fielder v. Howell, 676 S.W.2d 431 (Tex. App.
1984) reinforces that the mere filing of a recusal motion, regardless of its
procedural sufficiency, triggers the statutory and rule-based requirements
for recusal or referral. The judge named in the motion cannot make any
determination regarding the motion’s sufficiency and must act in accordance
with the prescribed procedures.
Analysis
Procedural Requirements for Recusal Motions
Texas law, as interpreted by the courts, imposes a clear and non-
discretionary process for handling recusal motions. Once a motion to recuse
is filed, the judge who is the subject of the motion must either recuse
themselves or refer the motion to the presiding judge for assignment to
another judge. This process is mandatory and applies regardless of whether
the motion is procedurally sufficient or not, as established in In re Norman,
191 S.W.3d 858 (Tex. App. 2006) and Greenberg, Fisk & Fielder v. Howell,
676 S.W.2d 431 (Tex. App. 1984).
The rationale for this strict approach is to ensure that the judge who is the
subject of the recusal motion does not have the power to determine the
adequacy or merits of the motion, thereby preserving the appearance and
reality of impartiality in the judicial process. Any deviation from this
process, such as a judge making determinations on the sufficiency of the
motion or taking further action in the case without recusing or referring, is
considered a clear abuse of discretion and a violation of due process.
Due Process and Notice
Due process, as articulated in Walker v. Packer, 827 S.W.2d 833 (Tex. 1992),
requires that parties receive notice and an opportunity to be heard on the
specific issues before the court. This principle is fundamental to the
legitimacy of judicial proceedings. When a judge is assigned to rule on a
recusal motion that does not exist—meaning no party has filed such a motion
against that judge—this assignment deprives the parties of notice and the
opportunity to address the actual issues before the court.

The assignment of a judge to rule on a non-existent motion is not merely a
technical error; it is a substantive violation of due process. The parties are
entitled to know the precise nature of the proceedings and to respond to the
actual motions and issues presented. Assigning a judge to rule on a motion
that was never filed creates confusion, undermines the parties’ ability to
respond, and prejudices the respondent by introducing issues that were not
properly before the court.
Void Actions and Prejudice
The consequences of failing to follow the mandatory procedures for recusal
are severe. As held in In re Norman, 191 S.W.3d 858 (Tex. App. 2006), if a
judge fails to comply with the rules governing recusal motions, all
subsequent actions taken by that judge in the case are void. This is because
the judge’s authority to act is suspended once a recusal motion is filed, and
any further action taken without proper referral or recusal is without legal
effect.
In the present scenario, the error is even more fundamental: a judge was
assigned to rule on a recusal motion that did not exist. This not only violates
the procedural requirements but also results in actions that are ultra vires—
beyond the court’s authority. The prejudice to the respondent is clear, as
they are forced to respond to proceedings that have no basis in the actual
motions filed, and their right to due process is compromised.
Support for Recusal
The procedural error described—assigning a judge to rule on a non-existent
recusal motion—demonstrates a disregard for the mandatory requirements
of Texas law and the fundamental principles of due process. This conduct
supports the argument that the presiding judge is either unable or unwilling
to follow the law, which is itself a ground for recusal. The integrity of the
judicial process depends on strict adherence to procedural rules, especially
in matters involving judicial impartiality.
The authorities make clear that the appearance of impropriety or the failure
to follow mandatory procedures is sufficient to warrant recusal. The
respondent’s argument that the presiding judge’s actions demonstrate an
inability or unwillingness to follow the law is well-supported by the case law,
particularly in light of the void nature of any actions taken in violation of the
recusal procedures.
Exceptions and Caveats
While the authorities are clear that strict compliance with recusal
procedures is required, it is important to note that the courts have also
recognized that the mere filing of a recusal motion, even if procedurally
defective, triggers the mandatory process. However, there is no authority
supporting the assignment of a judge to rule on a motion that does not exist.
The process is only triggered by the filing of a motion, and any action taken
in the absence of such a motion is unauthorized.

There may be rare circumstances where a court acts sua sponte to address
issues of judicial impartiality, but such actions must still comply with due
process requirements, including notice and an opportunity to be heard. In
the absence of a filed motion, the assignment of a judge to rule on recusal is
procedurally improper and cannot be justified under the authorities
provided.
Conclusion
In summary, Texas law requires strict adherence to procedural rules
governing recusal motions, and any deviation from these rules—such as
assigning a judge to rule on a non-existent motion—constitutes a clear
violation of due process. The authorities establish that such errors render
subsequent judicial actions void and support the necessity of recusal to
preserve the integrity of the judicial process. The respondent’s argument
that the presiding judge’s actions demonstrate an inability or unwillingness
to follow the law is well-founded, and the procedural error described is
sufficient to justify recusal under Texas law.
Legal Authorities
In re Norman, 191 S.W.3d 858 (Tex. App. 2006)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Mandamus relief is available if the trial court abuses its discretion, either in
resolving factual issues or in determining legal principles. See Walker v.
Packer, 827 S.W.2d 833, 839-40 (Tex.1992). A trial court abuses its
discretion if 'it reaches a decision so arbitrary and unreasonable as to
amount to a clear and prejudicial error of law.' ... Under Texas Rule of Civil
Procedure 18a, Judge Austin had a mandatory duty either to recuse himself
or to refer the recusal motion to the presiding judge. TEX.R. CIV. P. 18a. ...
Even though a motion to recuse may be defective, the challenged judge must
either recuse or refer the motion, so that another judge can determine the
procedural adequacy and merits of the motion to recuse. ... If a judge fails to
comply with the rules governing motions for recusal, all subsequent actions
by the judge in that case are void.
Summary
The passage highlights the mandatory procedural requirements for handling
recusal motions under Texas law. It emphasizes that a judge must either
recuse themselves or refer the motion to another judge, regardless of the
motion's sufficiency. Failure to follow these procedures results in void
actions by the judge. This supports the proposition that assigning a judge to
rule on a non-existent motion violates due process, as it demonstrates a
failure to adhere to procedural rules, leading to prejudicial errors.

Greenberg, Fisk & Fielder v. Howell, 676 S.W.2d 431 (Tex. App. 1984)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
By his brief resisting the writ, Judge Howell urges that, since he has
determined that the recusal motions are procedurally insufficient, no
mandamus should issue. To the contrary, we hold that, since both statute
and rule forbid any determination with regard to the recusal motions by
Judge Howell, the writ must issue, unless Judge Howell promptly enters
either order permitted to him, i.e. recusal or referral. By his fifteen-page
brief, Judge Howell argues that a recusal motion that is procedurally
insufficient is not a recusal motion at all, therefore, neither statute nor rule
is invoked. We disagree and hold that a recusal motion invokes both statute
and rule the instant the motion is filed and the judge named in the motion
shall recuse or refer without regard to the 'procedural sufficiency' of the
motion itself.
Summary
The passage emphasizes that once a recusal motion is filed, it invokes the
relevant statute and rule, requiring the judge to either recuse themselves or
refer the motion, regardless of the motion's procedural sufficiency. This
supports the proposition that due process requires adherence to procedural
rules, and any deviation, such as assigning a judge to rule on a non-existent
motion, violates due process.
