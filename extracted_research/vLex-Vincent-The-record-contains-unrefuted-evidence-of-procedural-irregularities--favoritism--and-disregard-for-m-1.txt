Question
The record contains unrefuted evidence of procedural irregularities,
favoritism, and disregard for mandatory legal requirements. The standard
for recusal is not actual bias, but whether a reasonable person, knowing all
the facts, would question the judge’s impartiality (In re K.E.M., 89 S.W.3d
814, 818 (Tex. App. 2002)). The objective standard for recusal is met in this
case, and recusal is required as a matter of law to ensure the appearance
and reality of impartial justice.
Answer (Texas)
Short response
Under Texas law, recusal is required when a reasonable person, fully
informed of all the facts, would question a judge’s impartiality, regardless of
whether actual bias is proven. Where the record contains unrefuted
evidence of procedural irregularities, favoritism, and disregard for
mandatory legal requirements, the objective standard for recusal is met and
recusal is mandated to preserve both the appearance and reality of impartial
justice.
Summary
Texas law establishes an objective standard for judicial recusal: a judge must
step aside if their impartiality might reasonably be questioned by a
reasonable member of the public, knowing all the facts. This standard does
not require proof of actual bias; rather, it is sufficient if the circumstances—
including procedural irregularities, favoritism, or disregard for legal
requirements—would cause a reasonable person to doubt the judge’s
impartiality.
The authorities provided, including Texas Rules of Civil Procedure 18b and
extensive case law, consistently affirm that recusal is mandatory under these
circumstances. The law prioritizes not only actual impartiality but also the
appearance of impartiality, recognizing that public confidence in the
judiciary depends on both. Therefore, in a case where the record contains
unrefuted evidence of conduct undermining the appearance of impartiality,
recusal is required as a matter of law.
Background and Relevant Law
Legislative and Regulatory Framework
The primary legislative authority governing judicial recusal in Texas is Rule
18b of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. Rule 18b(2) provides that a judge
must recuse themselves in any proceeding where their impartiality might

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
reasonably be questioned or where they have a personal bias or prejudice
concerning the subject matter or a party. This rule establishes an objective
standard, focusing on the perception of a reasonable person rather than the
judge’s subjective intent or actual bias.
This standard is echoed in administrative regulations, such as 1 Tex. Admin.
Code § 155.152, which applies the same grounds and procedures for recusal
or disqualification of judges in administrative hearings, directly referencing
Rule 18b. The regulation ensures that if a judge does not voluntarily recuse
themselves, another judge will be assigned to rule on the motion, reinforcing
the objective and mandatory nature of the recusal standard.
Case Law
Texas appellate courts have repeatedly affirmed the objective standard for
recusal. The leading cases, including In re K.E.M., 89 S.W.3d 814 (Tex. App.
2002), Rodriguez v. Newton, No. 13-19-00309-CV (Tex. App. Jul. 16, 2020), 
Adams v. Adams, No. 01-18-00192-CV (Tex. App. Apr. 16, 2019), and In re
Interest of E.R.C., 496 S.W.3d 270 (Tex. App. 2016), all articulate the same
test: recusal is required if a reasonable member of the public, knowing all
the facts, would have a reasonable doubt about the judge’s impartiality.
This standard is not limited to cases of proven actual bias. As explained in 
Ex Parte Ellis, 275 S.W.3d 109 (Tex. App. 2008), the language of Rule 18b is
mandatory and objective, requiring recusal whenever impartiality might
reasonably be questioned. The courts have further clarified that doubts
should be resolved in favor of recusal to maintain public confidence in the
judiciary.
Numerous other cases reinforce this principle, including Simpson v. State,
No. 01-12-00380-CR (Tex. App. Jun. 17, 2014), Duffey v. State, 428 S.W.3d
319 (Tex. App. 2014), Fuelberg v. State, 410 S.W.3d 498 (Tex. App. 2013), 
Rhodes v. State, 357 S.W.3d 796 (Tex. App. 2011), Gaal v. State, 332 S.W.3d
448 (Tex. Crim. App. 2011), Freeman v. State, 125 S.W.3d 505 (Tex. Crim.
App. 2003), Sears v. Nueces County Sheriff Olivarez, 28 S.W.3d 611 (Tex.
App. 2000), and Monroe v. Blackmon, 946 S.W.2d 533 (Tex. App. 1997).
These cases consistently apply the reasonable person standard and
emphasize that the appearance of impartiality is as important as actual
impartiality.
Administrative Decisions and Secondary Materials
Administrative decisions, such as Baker v. Soc. Sec. Admin., 080422 MSPB,
CH-1221-17-0318-W-1 (Aug. 4, 2022), apply a similar objective test,
requiring recusal when a reasonable person, knowing all the facts, would
question the judge’s impartiality. Secondary materials, including legal
handbooks and scholarly commentary, further support the principle that the
appearance of impartiality is critical and that recusal is necessary to
maintain public confidence in the judiciary.
Federal authorities, such as 28 U.S.C. § 455(a) and Supreme Court decisions
like Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co. and Rippo v. Baker, are persuasive and

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
reinforce the Texas standard, emphasizing that recusal may be
constitutionally required even absent actual bias if the probability of bias is
too high to be tolerated.
Analysis
The Objective Standard for Recusal
The central legal question is whether the objective standard for recusal is
met when the record contains unrefuted evidence of procedural
irregularities, favoritism, and disregard for mandatory legal requirements.
Under Texas law, the answer is unequivocally yes.
Rule 18b(2) of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure requires recusal whenever
a judge’s impartiality might reasonably be questioned. The test is not
whether the judge is actually biased, but whether a reasonable member of
the public, knowing all the facts, would have a reasonable doubt about the
judge’s impartiality (In re K.E.M., 89 S.W.3d 814, 818 (Tex. App. 2002); 
Rodriguez v. Newton, No. 13-19-00309-CV (Tex. App. Jul. 16, 2020); Adams
v. Adams, No. 01-18-00192-CV (Tex. App. Apr. 16, 2019); In re Interest of
E.R.C., 496 S.W.3d 270 (Tex. App. 2016)).
This standard is mandatory and objective. As explained in Ex Parte Ellis, 275
S.W.3d 109 (Tex. App. 2008), the judge must assess their own impartiality in
the first instance, but any reasonable doubt must be resolved in favor of
recusal. The courts have repeatedly held that the appearance of impartiality
is as important as actual impartiality, and public confidence in the judiciary
depends on both (Ex parte Chad Parker, 26 S.W.3d 711 (Tex. App. 2000); 
Sears v. Nueces County Sheriff Olivarez, 28 S.W.3d 611 (Tex. App. 2000)).
Application to Procedural Irregularities, Favoritism, and
Disregard for Legal Requirements
Where the record contains unrefuted evidence of procedural irregularities,
favoritism, or disregard for mandatory legal requirements, these
circumstances are precisely the type of facts that would cause a reasonable
person to question a judge’s impartiality. Texas courts have recognized that
such conduct undermines the integrity of the judicial process and breeds
skepticism and mistrust (Ex parte Chad Parker, 26 S.W.3d 711 (Tex. App.
2000)).
For example, in Gaal v. State, 332 S.W.3d 448 (Tex. Crim. App. 2011),
recusal was required where a judge’s actions—such as revoking a
defendant’s bond solely for invoking the right to a jury trial or refusing to
consider part of the range of punishment without evidence—would lead a
reasonable person to question impartiality. Similarly, in Johnson-Todd v.
Morgan, No. 09-17-00168-CV, No. 09-17-00194-CV (Tex. App. Dec. 20, 2018),
arguments based on lack of notice and inability to conduct discovery were
considered relevant to whether the judge’s impartiality might reasonably be
questioned.

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
The courts have also emphasized that recusal is not limited to cases of
proven actual bias. The appearance of bias, prejudice, or favoritism—
demonstrated by procedural irregularities or disregard for legal
requirements—can be sufficient to require recusal (Monroe v. Blackmon, 946
S.W.2d 533 (Tex. App. 1997); Freeman v. State, 125 S.W.3d 505 (Tex. Crim.
App. 2003)). The policy underlying this rule is to promote objectively
impartial tribunals and to preserve public confidence in the judiciary.
The Role of Unrefuted Evidence
The presence of unrefuted evidence is particularly significant. When the
record contains evidence of procedural irregularities, favoritism, or
disregard for legal requirements that is not contradicted or explained, the
risk to the appearance of impartiality is heightened. In such cases, the
objective standard is clearly met, and recusal is not merely discretionary but
required as a matter of law (In re K.E.M., 89 S.W.3d 814, 818 (Tex. App.
2002); Rodriguez v. Newton, No. 13-19-00309-CV (Tex. App. Jul. 16, 2020)).
Constitutional and Public Policy Considerations
The Due Process Clause of the U.S. Constitution may also require recusal
even in the absence of actual bias if the probability of bias is too high to be
constitutionally tolerable (Rippo v. Baker, 137 S. Ct. 905 (2017), as cited in
the secondary materials). The U.S. Supreme Court has held that objective
standards for recusal are necessary to protect against unconscious or
unrecognized bias and to maintain public confidence in the fairness of the
judicial process (Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co.).
Texas law is consistent with these federal standards, as reflected in both the
rules and the case law. The focus is on the reasonable perception of
impartiality, not the subjective intent of the judge. This approach is designed
to ensure that justice is not only done but is seen to be done.
Administrative and Secondary Authority
Administrative decisions and secondary materials further reinforce the
objective standard. For example, Baker v. Soc. Sec. Admin., 080422 MSPB,
CH-1221-17-0318-W-1 (Aug. 4, 2022) applies the same reasonable person
test, and legal commentaries emphasize that the appearance of impartiality
is as important as actual impartiality. These sources support the conclusion
that recusal is required whenever the circumstances would cause a
reasonable person to question a judge’s impartiality.
Exceptions and Caveats
While the standard for recusal is clear, courts have also cautioned that not
every adverse ruling or procedural misstep warrants recusal. The
reasonable person standard requires an objective assessment of all the facts
in the public domain. Isolated or minor procedural errors, without more,
may not be sufficient to meet the standard. However, where the record
contains unrefuted evidence of significant procedural irregularities,

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
favoritism, or disregard for mandatory legal requirements, the threshold is
met.
It is also important to note that the judge who is the subject of a recusal
motion is required to assess their own impartiality in the first instance, but if
they do not recuse themselves, another judge will be assigned to rule on the
motion (1 Tex. Admin. Code § 155.152). This procedural safeguard ensures
that the objective standard is applied fairly and consistently.
No negative or subsequent treatment has been identified in the provided
materials that would undermine the authority of the leading cases or the
legislative framework discussed above.
Conclusion
Texas law mandates recusal of a judge whenever a reasonable person,
knowing all the facts, would question the judge’s impartiality. This objective
standard is firmly established in Rule 18b of the Texas Rules of Civil
Procedure and is consistently applied in Texas case law. The presence of
unrefuted evidence of procedural irregularities, favoritism, or disregard for
mandatory legal requirements is precisely the type of circumstance that
meets this standard. Recusal is therefore required as a matter of law to
ensure both the appearance and reality of impartial justice, thereby
upholding public confidence in the integrity of the judicial process.
Legal Authorities
Gaal v. State , 332 S.W.3d 448 (Tex. Crim. App. 2011)
Texas Court of Criminal Appeals
Extract
Recusal has been required, however, when a trial judge revoked a
defendant's bond and put him in jail solely because he decided to invoke his
right to a jury trial, or when a trial judge arbitrarily, without any evidence
before him, refused to consider a portion of the range of punishment.
Recusal of the trial judge in a criminal trial was also proper under the
reasonable-person standard where the trial judge's remarks evidenced 'a
degree of anger and hostility toward the government that is in excess of any
provocation that we can find in the record,' or a personal prejudice against
the defendant for successfully appealing his conviction on the basis of the
judge's actions during a prior trial.
Summary
The passage from "Gaal v. State" provides examples where recusal was
deemed necessary due to actions by a judge that could lead a reasonable
person to question the judge's impartiality. It highlights that recusal is
appropriate not only for actual bias but also when a judge's actions or

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
remarks could reasonably be perceived as biased or prejudiced. This aligns
with the proposition that the standard for recusal is whether a reasonable
person, knowing all the facts, would question the judge's impartiality.
Freeman v. State, 125 S.W.3d 505 (Tex. Crim. App. 2003)
Texas Court of Criminal Appeals
Extract
Because the trial judge in this case acted in such a way that would cause a
reasonable member of the public at large, knowing all the facts in the public
domain concerning the judge's conduct, to have a reasonable doubt that the
judge was actually impartial, trial counsel should have moved to recuse the
judge.
Summary
The passage from "Freeman v. State" directly addresses the standard for
recusal, which is whether a reasonable person, knowing all the facts, would
question the judge's impartiality. This aligns with the proposition that the
objective standard for recusal is met when there is a reasonable doubt about
a judge's impartiality. The passage supports the idea that recusal is
necessary to ensure the appearance and reality of impartial justice, as it
highlights the importance of public perception and the reasonable doubt
standard.

The language of our rules is clear and straightforward: the grounds for
recusal of an appellate justice or judge are the same as those provided in the
rules of civil procedure. Tex.R.App. P. 16.2. Texas Rule of Civil Procedure
18b provides that '[a] judge shall recuse himself in any proceeding in
which ... his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.' Tex.R. Civ. P.
18b(2)(a). This language is mandatory, and the standard is objective, not
subjective. Id. It calls upon the judge—in the first instance—to assess his
impartiality. A reasonable doubt is resolved in favor of recusal.
Summary
The passage clearly outlines the objective standard for recusal in Texas,
emphasizing that a judge must recuse themselves if their impartiality might
reasonably be questioned. This aligns with the proposition that the standard
for recusal is not actual bias but whether a reasonable person would
question the judge's impartiality. The passage also highlights that this
standard is mandatory and objective, supporting the need for recusal to
ensure impartial justice.

We apply a reasonable person standard in determining whether a recusal
motion should have been granted. See Woodruff v. Wright, 51 S.W.3d 727,
736 (Tex.App.-Texarkana 2001, pet. denied). The question is whether a
reasonable member of the public at large, knowing all the facts in the public
domain concerning the judge's conduct, would have a reasonable doubt that
the judge is actually impartial. Rogers v. Bradley, 909 S.W.2d 872, 881 (Tex.
1995). The impartiality standard set out in Rule 18b(2)(a) has been adopted
in order that the public (i.e., the person on the street) might have confidence
in the judiciary and to protect judges from unjustified complaints about their
being partial in their decisions.
Summary
The passage from Duffey v. State discusses the application of a reasonable
person standard for determining whether a recusal motion should be
granted. It emphasizes that the standard is whether a reasonable member of
the public, knowing all the facts, would doubt the judge's impartiality. This
aligns with the proposition that the standard for recusal is not actual bias
but the appearance of impartiality. The passage also references Rule 18b(2)
(a), which is relevant to the legal requirements for recusal in Texas.

The Texas Supreme Court mandates that when there exists a reasonable
question as to a judge's impartiality, recusal is mandatory. In determining
whether recusal is required pursuant to Tex.R.Civ.P. 18b(2)(a), the proper

the facts in the public domain would have a reasonable doubt that a judge is
actually impartial. Rodgers v. Bradley, 909 S.W.2d 872, 874 (Tex. 1995). The
correct policy consideration in this regard is the promotion of objectively
impartial tribunals. Public policy demands that a judge who sits in a case act

Extract
Public policy demands that a judge who tries a case act with absolute
impartiality. It further demands that a judge appear to be impartial so that
no doubts or suspicions exist as to the fairness or the integrity of the court.
Judicial decisions rendered under circumstances that suggest bias, prejudice
or favoritism undermine the integrity of the courts, breed skepticism and

Standard for recusal under Texas law, which aligns with the proposition that
the standard is not actual bias but whether a reasonable person would
question the judge's impartiality. It emphasizes that a judge must be recused
if their impartiality might reasonably be questioned, supporting the idea that
procedural irregularities and favoritism could lead to such questioning. The
passage also highlights the necessity for the party seeking recusal to
demonstrate that a reasonable person, knowing all circumstances, would
doubt the judge's impartiality, which is consistent with the proposition's
argument for recusal based on the appearance of impartiality.

Judge Mills has a personal or pecuniary interest in this case, recusal is
determined from an objective standard, and asks whether a reasonable
person would doubt that Judge Mills could remain impartial. ... Judge
Richardson should have determined whether a reasonable person would
doubt Judge Mills's impartiality. Therefore, we conclude that Judge
Richardson abused his discretion by applying the incorrect legal standard to
Fuelberg's motion to recuse.
Summary
The standard for recusal is not based on actual bias but on whether a
reasonable person, knowing all the facts, would question the judge's
impartiality. This aligns with the proposition that the objective standard for
recusal is met when there is unrefuted evidence of procedural irregularities,
favoritism, and disregard for mandatory legal requirements, as it
emphasizes the importance of the appearance of impartiality.
In re Marriage of Bryant, 13-24-00285-CV (Tex. App. May 15, 2025)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Generally, it is disfavored for trial judges to call and question witnesses.
Johnson v. Hawkins, 255 S.W.3d 394, 398 (Tex. App.-Dallas 2008, pet.
denied); see also Galvan v. State, 988 S.W.2d 291, 297 (Tex. App.-Texarkana
1999, pet. ref'd) ('Texas is 'second to none' in its disapproval of judges'
examination of witnesses during a jury trial. .. .'). But, though not favored,
extensive and adversarial questioning by a trial judge is permissible in a
bench trial if the questions are relevant to the issues before the court and
the judge's impartiality is not affected... Bias is considered impermissible
when it comes 'from an extrajudicial source and result[s] in an opinion on
the merits of the case other than what the judge learned from participating
in the case.'

Summary
Disfavor of judges questioning witnesses due to the potential appearance of
bias, which aligns with the proposition's concern about procedural
irregularities and favoritism. It also highlights that bias is impermissible
when it comes from an extrajudicial source, supporting the idea that recusal
is necessary when impartiality is in question. This aligns with the
proposition's standard for recusal based on a reasonable person's perception
of impartiality.
Woodruff v. Wright, 51 S.W.3d 727 (Tex. App. 2001)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The Texas Rules of Civil Procedure provide that a judge shall recuse himself
in any proceeding in which 'his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.'
Tex. R. Civ. P. 18b(2)(a). ... In applying this standard, courts often apply a
reasonable person standard in determining whether a recusal motion should
have been granted. ... We agree that a reasonable person standard is
appropriate because the rule provides for recusal where a judge's
impartiality might reasonably be questioned.
Summary
The Texas Rules of Civil Procedure require a judge to recuse themselves if
their impartiality might reasonably be questioned. The passage emphasizes
the use of a "reasonable person standard" to determine whether recusal is
appropriate, aligning with the proposition that the standard for recusal is
not actual bias but whether a reasonable person would question the judge's
impartiality.
In re Interest of E.R.C., 496 S.W.3d 270 (Tex. App. 2016)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Subsections (b)(1) and (b)(2) require a judge to recuse himself in a
proceeding in which his 'impartiality might reasonably be questioned' or in
which he 'has a personal bias or prejudice concerning the subject matter or
a party.' TEX.R. CIV. P. 18b(b)(1), (2). ... In determining whether a judge's
impartiality might be reasonably questioned so as to require recusal, the
proper inquiry is whether a reasonable member of the public at large,
knowing all the facts in the public domain concerning the judge and the
case, would have a reasonable doubt that the judge is actually impartial.

Summary
Legal basis for recusal when impartiality might reasonably be questioned,

impartial justice.
1 Tex. Admin. Code § 155.152 1 Tex. Admin. Code § 155.152 Disqualification
Or Recusal of Judges
Extract
A judge is subject to recusal or disqualification on the same grounds and
under the same circumstances as specified in TRCP Rule 18b. ... If the
presiding judge who is the subject of the motion does not disqualify or
recuse him- or herself from the case, the Chief Judge or a designee of the
Chief Judge shall assign another judge to consider and rule on the motion.
Summary
Procedure for recusal or disqualification of judges, referencing TRCP Rule
18b, which is consistent with the standard for recusal based on whether a
reasonable person would question the judge's impartiality. The procedure
ensures that if a judge does not voluntarily recuse themselves, another
judge will be assigned to rule on the motion, thereby upholding the objective
standard for recusal to maintain impartial justice.

further to preserve public confidence in the courts by disqualifying judges
that merely appear biased. (42) Under section 455, a judge is disqualified
when a party demonstrates that a reasonable person would question the
judge's impartiality; (43) the movant need not show or even allege actual
bias on the part of the challenged judge. (44) When deciding section 455(a)
motions, courts ask whether a reasonable person aware of all the relevant
facts, without knowing whether the challenged judge is actually biased,
would question the judge's impartiality. (45)... the public's confidence in the
judiciary, our inquiry focuses not on whether the judge actually harbored
subjective bias, but rather on whether the record, viewed objectively,
reasonably supports the appearance of prejudice or bias.

Summary
Standard for judicial disqualification under section 455, which aligns with
the proposition's assertion that the standard for recusal is based on whether
a reasonable person would question the judge's impartiality, not on actual
bias. This supports the idea that procedural irregularities and favoritism,
even if not proving actual bias, can meet the standard for recusal if they
create an appearance of bias. The passage emphasizes the importance of
maintaining public confidence in the judiciary by focusing on the appearance
of impartiality, which is central to the proposition.

himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be
questioned. The legislature incorporated an objective standard in [sections]
455(a) for measuring the appearance of partiality 'to promote public
confidence in the impartiality of the judicial process by saying, in effect, if
there is a reasonable factual basis for doubting the judge's impartiality, he
should disqualify himself and let another judge preside over the case.'
Furthermore, by making disqualification mandatory whenever a judge's
'impartiality might reasonably be questioned,' the amendment eradicated
the duty-to-sit.
Summary
Objective standard for recusal under section 455(a), which aligns with the
proposition that recusal is required when a reasonable person might
question a judge's impartiality. This supports the idea that the standard for
recusal is not actual bias but the appearance of bias, which is consistent
with the proposition's reference to the In re K.E.M. case. The passage
emphasizes the importance of public confidence in judicial impartiality and
the mandatory nature of disqualification when impartiality is reasonably
questioned.

'reasonable minds, with knowledge of all the relevant circumstances that a
reasonable inquiry would disclose.' ... The appearance standard is based on

Summary
The appearance of impropriety standard is based on how a reasonable
person, with knowledge of all relevant circumstances, would perceive the
situation. This aligns with the proposition that the standard for recusal is not
actual bias but whether a reasonable person would question the judge's
impartiality. The passage supports the idea that the appearance standard is
a reasonableness standard, which is consistent with the objective standard
for recusal mentioned in the proposition.
Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co.: the objective standard for judicial recusal.
Notre Dame Law Review - University of Notre Dame Law School -
Todt, Jonathan H. - 2011-02-01
Extract
Writing for the majority, Justice Kennedy held that any subjective
examination by a judge is merely one step in the process for the examination
of bias--'objective standards may also require recusal whether or not actual
bias exists or can be proved.' ... The Court emphasized that this need for
objective rules exists as 'protection against a judge who simply misreads or
misapprehends' his or her true motives while trying a case. ... Therefore,
objective standards based on the probability of bias--and which requires no
actual proof of bias-are appropriate.
Summary
The Supreme Court in Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co. established that
recusal can be required based on objective standards, even in the absence of
actual bias. This aligns with the proposition that the standard for recusal is
whether a reasonable person would question the judge's impartiality, not
whether actual bias is present. The passage supports the idea that
procedural irregularities and favoritism could lead to a reasonable
perception of bias, necessitating recusal to maintain impartial justice.

Extract
All states include within their code of judicial conduct a directive for judges
to follow regarding disqualification when 'his [or her] impartiality might
reasonably be questioned.' ... When specific rules of presumed or actual bias
do not apply because the facts do not fit the ethical standard, the judge or a
moving party still may rely upon the above standard based on apparent bias
or the appearance of partiality, even though no actual bias exists. ... The
appearance of impartiality is as important as actual impartiality. ... Texas
uses the 'might reasonably be questioned' standard, albeit in a court rule
that does not include other subjects covered by the CJC. TEX. R. CIV. P.
