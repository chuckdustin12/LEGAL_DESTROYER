final judgment entered. Are there any facial errors, such as a repealed
statute for appeal, or any other strategies the person can use to fight these
judgments?
Answer (Texas)

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Short response
While there are no facial errors or repealed statutes in the judgments, Ryan
Sterling Myers has several viable options to challenge them, including
potential dismissal of the license plate and registration insignia charges
under Texas Transportation Code §§ 504.943 and 502.473, and timely appeal
within 10 days of judgment.
Summary
Ryan Sterling Myers received three judgments from the Allen Municipal
Court for traffic violations: operating a vehicle without a license plate,
operating a vehicle without registration insignia, and speeding (90 mph in a
70 mph zone). Based on the provided legal materials, there are no facial
errors or repealed statutes apparent in the judgments themselves. However,
the defendant has several potential strategies to fight these judgments.
The most promising options include: (1) seeking dismissal of the license
plate and registration insignia charges by remedying the defects and paying
a reimbursement fee not exceeding $10 per offense under Texas
Transportation Code §§ 504.943 and 502.473; (2) filing a timely appeal by
submitting an appeal bond within 10 days of the judgment date; (3) filing a
motion for new trial within 10 days if the municipal court is a court of
record; (4) requesting a waiver or reduction of fines based on indigency or
hardship; or (5) pursuing a restricted appeal within six months if certain
conditions are met. Each strategy has specific requirements and timeframes
that must be strictly followed.
Background and Relevant Law
Texas Transportation Code Provisions
The Texas Transportation Code contains provisions that may allow for
dismissal of two of the three charges against Ryan Sterling Myers.
For the first charge of operating a vehicle without a license plate, Tex.
Transp. Code § 504.943 provides: "A court may dismiss a charge brought
under Subsection (a) if the defendant: remedies the defect before the
defendant's first court appearance; and pays a reimbursement fee not to
exceed $10." This provision creates an opportunity for dismissal if the
defendant obtains and properly displays the required license plates before
the first court appearance and pays a nominal reimbursement fee.
Similarly, for the second charge of operating a vehicle with improperly
displayed or no registration insignia, Tex. Transp. Code § 502.473 states: "A
court may dismiss a charge brought under Subsection (a) if the defendant
pays a reimbursement fee not to exceed $10 and: remedies the defect before
the defendant's first court appearance; or shows that the motor vehicle was
issued a registration insignia by the department that was attached to the
motor vehicle, establishing that the vehicle was registered for the period

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
during which the offense was committed." This provision provides two
alternative paths for dismissal: either remedying the defect or proving that
the vehicle was properly registered during the relevant period.
These provisions are significant because they offer specific mechanisms for
dismissal that could apply in this case. The judgments indicate that the
defendant has already made an initial appearance and entered a plea of no
contest on June 17, 2025, with the judgment signed on June 24, 2025. Thus,
whether the defendant can still utilize these dismissal provisions will depend
on whether the initial appearance constituted the "first court appearance"
referenced in the statutes, or whether there may still be an opportunity to
remedy these defects.
The case of Turner v. State, No. 05-17-00732-CR (Tex. App. Feb 08, 2018)
confirms that driving with expired registration violates multiple provisions of
the transportation code: "Driving with expired registration violates multiple
provisions of the transportation code. See, e.g., TEX. TRANSP. CODE ANN.
§§ 502.040(a) (Registration Required; General Rule), 502.407(a) (Operation
of Vehicle with Expired License Plate), 502.473(a) (Operation of Vehicle
Without Registration Insignia), 504.943 (Operation of Vehicle Without
License Plate) (West Supp. 2017)." This case affirms that the statutes under
which the defendant was charged are valid and applicable.
For the speeding offense, there is also a potential option under Tex. Code
Crim. Proc. § 45A.352, which provides for the possibility of completing a
driving safety course: "The judge shall require a defendant to successfully
complete a driving safety course approved by the Texas Department of
Licensing and Regulation or a course under the motorcycle operator
training and safety program approved by the designated state agency under
Chapter 662, Transportation Code, if: the defendant elects driving safety
course or motorcycle operator training course dismissal under this
subchapter; ... the defendant is charged with an offense to which this
subchapter applies, other than speeding at a speed of: (A) 95 miles per hour
or more; or (B) 25 miles per hour or more over the posted speed limit..."
Since the defendant was charged with speeding at 90 mph in a 70 mph zone,
which is 20 mph over the posted speed limit, he may be eligible for this
option if other conditions are met. However, the judgment indicates that the
defendant has already entered a plea of no contest and been found guilty, so
the timing for making this election may have passed.
Appeal Procedures
The Texas Code of Criminal Procedure provides several avenues for
appealing judgments from municipal courts. The judgments themselves
reference "Art. 45.0425 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure" for appeal
procedures. However, based on the provided legal materials, this appears to
correspond to the recently revised Tex. Code Crim. Proc. § 45A.203, which
states: "An appeal is perfected when the appeal bond has been filed: with
the justice or judge who tried the case; and not later than the 10th day after
the date the judgment was entered."

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
This means that to appeal any of these judgments, the defendant must file
an appeal bond with the judge who tried the case within 10 days after the
judgments were entered on June 24, 2025. The deadline would therefore be
July 4, 2025.
Tex. Code Crim. Proc. § 45A.202 further provides details on the appeal
process: "An appeal from a justice or municipal court, including an appeal
from a final judgment in a bond forfeiture proceeding, shall be heard by the
county court or, if the county court has no jurisdiction over the case, the
proper court in the county. A de novo trial shall be held on appeal unless the
appeal is: taken from a municipal court of record; and based on error
reflected in the record."
This means that if the Allen Municipal Court is not a court of record, then an
appeal would result in a completely new trial (de novo) in the county court.
If it is a court of record, then the appeal would be based on errors reflected
in the record.
Importantly, Tex. Code Crim. Proc. § 45A.202 also states: "An appeal may not
be dismissed because of: the defendant's failure to give notice of appeal in
open court; or the presence of a defect in the transcript." This provision
protects against dismissal on certain technical grounds.
For municipal courts of record, Tex. Gov't. Code § 30.00014 outlines a
different procedure: "A defendant has the right of appeal from a judgment or
conviction in a municipal court of record... To perfect an appeal, the
appellant must file a written motion for new trial with the municipal clerk
not later than the 10th day after the date on which judgment is rendered.
The motion must set forth the points of error of which the appellant
complains..." This means that if the Allen Municipal Court is a court of
record, the defendant would need to file a motion for new trial specifying
the errors within 10 days of the judgment (by July 4, 2025).
Waiver of Fines and Costs
Another potential strategy involves seeking a waiver or reduction of fines
based on financial hardship. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. § 45A.257 provides: "A
municipal court, regardless of whether the court is a court of record, or a
justice court may waive payment of all or part of a fine imposed on a
defendant if the court determines that: the defendant: (A) is indigent or does
not have sufficient resources or income to pay all or part of the fine; or (B)
was, at the time the offense was committed, a child as defined by Article
CODE OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE 45A.453(a); and discharging the fine
under Article CODE OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE 45A.254 or as otherwise
authorized by this chapter would impose an undue hardship on the
defendant."
If the defendant can demonstrate indigence or that paying the fines would
impose an undue hardship, he may be able to have the fines reduced or
waived entirely.

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Capias Pro Fine Considerations
Tex. Code Crim. Proc. § 45A.259 provides protection against immediate
arrest for non-payment: "The court may not issue a capias pro fine for the
defendant's failure to satisfy the judgment according to the terms of the
judgment unless the court holds a hearing to determine whether the
judgment imposes an undue hardship on the defendant and the defendant
fails to: appear at the hearing; or comply with an order issued under
Subsection (f) as a result of the hearing."
This means that if the defendant is unable to pay the fines immediately as
required by the judgments, the court cannot issue a warrant for his arrest
without first holding a hearing to determine if the judgment imposes an
undue hardship.
Judgment Requirements
Tex. Code Crim. Proc. § 42.01 sets forth the requirements for a valid
judgment, including numerous specific elements that must be included. A
review of the judgments in this case shows that they appear to contain the
essential elements required by this statute, including the title and number of
the case, the appearance of the parties, the plea, the verdict, the assessment
of punishment, the date of judgment, and other required information. There
do not appear to be any facial defects in the judgments based on these
requirements.
Restricted Appeal
As a final option, the defendant may consider a restricted appeal if they
meet certain conditions. According to the secondary material "Restricted
Appeals In Texas," "To attack a trial court's judgment by restricted appeal, a
party must show that: * a notice of appeal was filed within six months of the
date that the complained-of judgment was signed; * the filer was a party to
the suit that did not participate in the hearing that resulted in the judgment
or order; * the party did not timely file a post-judgment motion, request
findings of fact and conclusions of law, or file a notice of appeal within the
time permitted under Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure 26.1(a); and * the
complained-of error is apparent from the face of the record."
However, this option appears less viable in this case since the defendant
participated in the hearing by making an initial appearance and entering a
plea of no contest.

Analysis
Potential Strategies for Fighting the Judgments
1. Dismissal Under Transportation Code Provisions
The most straightforward strategy for the license plate and registration
insignia charges would be to seek dismissal under Tex. Transp. Code §
504.943 and Tex. Transp. Code § 502.473, respectively. These provisions
allow for dismissal if the defendant remedies the defects and pays a
reimbursement fee not exceeding $10.
However, there are timing considerations. The statutes specify that the
defect must be remedied "before the defendant's first court appearance."
Since the judgments indicate that the defendant has already made his initial
appearance and entered a plea of no contest on June 17, 2025, it may be too
late to utilize these provisions directly.
Nevertheless, the defendant could argue that the initial appearance should
not constitute the "first court appearance" for purposes of these statutes,
particularly if they were not informed of these dismissal options.
Alternatively, the defendant could file a motion for new trial (if in a court of
record) or appeal the judgments and then seek dismissal under these
provisions at the new trial. This approach would require prompt action
within the 10-day appeal window.
2. Timely Appeal
The defendant has the right to appeal these judgments. According to Tex.
Code Crim. Proc. § 45A.203, an appeal is perfected by filing an appeal bond
with the judge who tried the case within 10 days after the judgment was
entered. Since the judgments were entered on June 24, 2025, the deadline
for filing the appeal bond would be July 4, 2025.
The nature of the appeal depends on whether the Allen Municipal Court is a
court of record:
If it is not a court of record, then the appeal would result in a de novo
trial in the county court, meaning the case would be tried anew as if the
municipal court proceedings had never occurred.
If it is a court of record, then according to Tex. Gov't. Code § 30.00014,
the defendant would need to file a written motion for new trial with the
municipal clerk within 10 days after the judgment, specifying the points
of error.
Either way, the appeal must be filed promptly, and the defendant should be
prepared to articulate the grounds for appeal.

3. Motion for New Trial
If the Allen Municipal Court is a court of record, the defendant can file a
motion for new trial within 10 days of the judgment under Tex. Gov't. Code §
30.00014. This motion must set forth the specific errors alleged.
Potential grounds might include:
The court's failure to inform the defendant of the option to remedy the
license plate and registration defects under Tex. Transp. Code §
504.943 and Tex. Transp. Code § 502.473.
The court's failure to consider the option of a driving safety course for
the speeding offense under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. § 45A.352.
Any procedural irregularities or constitutional violations that may have
occurred.
4. Challenging the Validity of the Judgment
Based on Modica v. State, 151 S.W.3d 716 (Tex. App. 2004), "A judgment of
conviction for a crime is void when (1) the document purporting to be a
charging instrument (i.e. indictment, information, or complaint) does not
satisfy the constitutional requisites of a charging instrument, thus the trial
court has no jurisdiction over the defendant, (2) the trial court lacks subject
matter jurisdiction over the offense charged, such as when a misdemeanor
involving official misconduct is tried in a county court at law, (3) the record
reflects that there is no evidence to support the conviction, or (4) an
indigent defendant is required to face criminal trial proceedings without
appointed counsel, when such has not been waived, in violation of Gideon v.
Wainwright."
The defendant could review the charging instruments to determine if they
satisfy constitutional requirements. However, the judgments indicate that
the defendant "waives the objection to any defect in the charging
instrument, the filing of and notice of a sworn complaint," which may limit
this approach.
5. Seeking Waiver or Reduction of Fines
Under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. § 45A.257, the defendant can request that the
court waive or reduce the fines if they can demonstrate indigence or that
paying the fines would impose an undue hardship. This could be pursued
either before or after an appeal is filed.
The judgments require immediate payment (by 4:30 p.m. on June 24, 2025),
but the current outstanding balance is listed as $0.00, suggesting that the
fines may have already been paid. If this is inaccurate and the fines remain
unpaid, the defendant could request a hearing on their ability to pay.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
6. Driving Safety Course Option
For the speeding offense, the defendant might still be able to pursue the
option of completing a driving safety course under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. §
45A.352 and Tex. Code Crim. Proc. § 45A.356, which allows for deferral of
judgment and dismissal upon completion of the course. However, this
typically must be requested before a finding of guilt, so the defendant would
likely need to successfully appeal or obtain a new trial first.
7. Restricted Appeal
As a last resort, if the defendant did not participate in the hearing that
resulted in the judgments (though the record suggests they did make an
initial appearance), they could potentially file a restricted appeal within six
months of the judgment. However, this approach has strict requirements
and would only be successful if there is an error apparent on the face of the
record.
Facial Validity of the Judgments
Based on the requirements set forth in Tex. Code Crim. Proc. § 42.01, the
judgments appear to contain all the necessary elements and do not show any
facial defects or errors. The judgments properly identify the parties, the
offenses charged, the pleas entered, the findings of the court, the
punishments assessed, and the payment requirements.
The judgments also correctly reference the appeal procedure, although they
cite "Art. 45.0425 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure" rather than Tex.
Code Crim. Proc. § 45A.203. This discrepancy appears to be due to recent
legislative changes rather than an error, as the judgments were signed on
June 24, 2025, and the legal materials indicate that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. §
45A.203 was added by Acts 2023, Texas Acts of the 88th Leg.- Regular
Session, ch. 765, Sec. 1.001, effective 1/1/2025.
Statute Validity
None of the statutes referenced in the judgments appear to have been
repealed. Turner v. State, No. 05-17-00732-CR (Tex. App. Feb 08, 2018)
confirms the validity of the transportation code provisions related to vehicle
registration and license plates: "Driving with expired registration violates
multiple provisions of the transportation code. See, e.g., TEX. TRANSP.
CODE ANN. §§ 502.040(a) (Registration Required; General Rule), 502.407(a)
(Operation of Vehicle with Expired License Plate), 502.473(a) (Operation of
Vehicle Without Registration Insignia), 504.943 (Operation of Vehicle
Without License Plate) (West Supp. 2017)."

Conclusion
While there are no facial errors or repealed statutes apparent in the
judgments against Ryan Sterling Myers, there are several potential
strategies for challenging these judgments:
Seek Dismissal Under Transportation Code Provisions: For the
license plate and registration insignia charges, the defendant could
attempt to remedy the defects and pay the reimbursement fee,
although the timing may be an issue since the initial appearance has
already occurred.
File a Timely Appeal: The defendant has until July 4, 2025 (10 days
after the judgment) to file an appeal bond or motion for new trial,
depending on whether the Allen Municipal Court is a court of record.
Request Waiver of Fines: If the defendant is indigent or would face
undue hardship in paying the fines, they can request a waiver or
reduction under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. § 45A.257.
Pursue Driving Safety Course Option: For the speeding offense, the
defendant might be able to request the driving safety course option if
they can successfully appeal or obtain a new trial.
Consider a Restricted Appeal: If other options fail and the defendant
meets the strict requirements, they could file a restricted appeal within
six months of the judgment.
The most time-sensitive action is filing the appeal bond or motion for new
trial within the 10-day window. This would preserve the defendant's right to
appeal and open up additional possibilities for fighting the judgments. The
defendant should also gather any documentation showing that the vehicle
was properly registered and licensed at the time of the offenses, as this
could support a dismissal of those charges.
The statutes referenced in the judgments appear to be valid and current,
and there are no obvious facial defects that would render the judgments
void. Therefore, the defendant's best strategies lie in the procedural options
outlined above, particularly those that take advantage of the specific
dismissal provisions in the Texas Transportation Code for license plate and
registration violations.

Extract
A judgment of conviction for a crime is void when (1) the document
purporting to be a charging instrument (i.e. indictment, information, or
complaint) does not satisfy the constitutional requisites of a charging
instrument, thus the trial court has no jurisdiction over the defendant, (2)
the trial court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the offense charged,
such as when a misdemeanor involving official misconduct is tried in a
county court at law, (3) the record reflects that there is no evidence to
support the conviction, or (4) an indigent defendant is required to face
criminal trial proceedings without appointed counsel, when such has not
been waived, in violation of Gideon v. Wainwright.
Summary
A judgment can be considered void if there are jurisdictional issues, such as
the charging instrument not meeting constitutional requirements, lack of
subject matter jurisdiction, no evidence supporting the conviction, or if an
indigent defendant was not provided counsel. These are potential grounds
for appeal if any of these conditions are met in the current case.

Driving with expired registration violates multiple provisions of the
transportation code. See, e.g., TEX. TRANSP. CODE ANN. §§ 502.040(a)
(Registration Required; General Rule), 502.407(a) (Operation of Vehicle with

(West Supp. 2017).
Summary
The passage from Turner v. State provides insight into the relevant sections
of the Texas Transportation Code that pertain to vehicle registration and
license plate offenses. It confirms that the statutes under which the
defendant was charged are valid and applicable. The passage does not
indicate any repealed statutes or errors in the legal basis for the charges.
Therefore, the judgments appear to be based on current and applicable law.

Extract
An appeal is perfected when the appeal bond has been filed: with the justice
or judge who tried the case; and not later than the 10th day after the date
the judgment was entered.
Summary
To appeal a judgment in a municipal court in Texas, the defendant must file
an appeal bond with the justice or judge who tried the case within 10 days
after the judgment was entered. This is a procedural requirement that must
be met for the appellate court to have jurisdiction over the case. If the
appeal bond is not filed within this timeframe, the appellate court will not
have jurisdiction, and the case will be remanded to the municipal court for
execution of the sentence.

Extract
An appeal from a justice or municipal court, including an appeal from a final

or, if the county court has no jurisdiction over the case, the proper court in
the county. A de novo trial shall be held on appeal unless the appeal is: taken
from a municipal court of record; and based on error reflected in the record.
An appeal may not be dismissed because of: the defendant's failure to give

Summary
The passage provides guidance on the appeal process from a justice or
municipal court in Texas. It specifies that appeals are to be heard by the
county court or the proper court in the county if the county court lacks
jurisdiction. A de novo trial is required on appeal unless the appeal is from a
municipal court of record and based on an error in the record. Importantly,
the passage notes that an appeal cannot be dismissed due to the defendant's
failure to give notice of appeal in open court or due to a defect in the
transcript. This information is crucial for understanding the appeal process
and potential strategies for challenging the judgments.

Extract
(a) The judgment and sentence for a conviction in a criminal action before a

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
253(a) and (b) and Article CODE OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE 45A.257, the
justice or judge may direct the defendant: to pay: (A) the entire fine and
costs when the sentence is pronounced; (B) the entire fine and costs at a
later date; or (C) a specified portion of the fine and costs at designated
intervals; if applicable, to make restitution to a victim of the offense; and to
satisfy any other sanction authorized by law. (d) The justice or judge shall
credit the defendant for time served in jail as provided by Article CODE OF
CRIMINAL PROCEDURE 42.03. The credit under this subsection shall be
applied to the amount of the fine and costs at the rate provided by Article
CODE OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE 45A.262. (e) In addition to credit under
Subsection (d), in imposing a fine and costs in a case involving a
misdemeanor punishable by fine only, the justice or judge shall credit the
defendant for any period the defendant was confined in jail or prison while
serving a sentence for another offense if that confinement occurred after the
commission of the misdemeanor. The credit under this subsection shall be
applied to the amount of the fine and costs at the rate of not less than $150
for each day of confinement.
Summary
The passage outlines the procedures and options available to a judge when
imposing fines and costs on a defendant. It also specifies that the defendant
should receive credit for time served in jail, which can be applied to reduce
the amount of the fine and costs. This information is relevant to
understanding the options available to a defendant in terms of payment and
potential credits for time served, which could be a strategy to reduce the
financial burden of the judgment.
Tex. Gov't. Code § 30.00014 Tex. Gov't. Code § 30.00014 Appeal
Extract
A defendant has the right of appeal from a judgment or conviction in a
municipal court of record... To perfect an appeal, the appellant must file a
written motion for new trial with the municipal clerk not later than the 10th
day after the date on which judgment is rendered. The motion must set forth
the points of error of which the appellant complains... The court may for
good cause extend the time for filing or amending, but the extension may
not exceed 90 days from the original filing deadline.
Summary
A defendant has the right to appeal a judgment or conviction from a
municipal court of record. To do so, the defendant must file a written motion
for a new trial within 10 days of the judgment, specifying the points of error.
This provides a potential strategy for the defendant to challenge the
judgments if there are errors in the proceedings.

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. § 45A.257 Tex. Code Crim. Proc. § 45A.257 Waiver of
Payment of Fines and Costs
Extract
A municipal court, regardless of whether the court is a court of record, or a
justice court may waive payment of all or part of a fine imposed on a
defendant if the court determines that: the defendant: (A) is indigent or does
not have sufficient resources or income to pay all or part of the fine; or (B)
was, at the time the offense was committed, a child as defined by Article
CODE OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE 45A.453(a); and discharging the fine
under Article CODE OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE 45A.254 or as otherwise
authorized by this chapter would impose an undue hardship on the
defendant.
Summary
The Texas Code of Criminal Procedure allows for the waiver of fines and
costs if the defendant is indigent or if paying the fines would impose an
undue hardship. This provision is applicable to municipal and justice courts
in Texas and could be relevant to the defendant's situation if they meet the
criteria for indigence or undue hardship.
Tex. Code Crim. Proc. § 45A.259 Tex. Code Crim. Proc. § 45A.259 Capias Pro
Fine
Extract
If the defendant is not in custody when the judgment is imposed or if the
defendant fails to satisfy the judgment according to the terms of the
judgment, the court may order a capias pro fine, as defined by Article CODE
OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE 43.015, issued for the defendant's arrest... The
court may not issue a capias pro fine for the defendant's failure to satisfy the
judgment according to the terms of the judgment unless the court holds a
hearing to determine whether the judgment imposes an undue hardship on
the defendant and the defendant fails to: appear at the hearing; or comply
with an order issued under Subsection (f) as a result of the hearing.
Summary
The court must hold a hearing to determine if the judgment imposes an
undue hardship on the defendant before issuing a capias pro fine for failure
to satisfy the judgment. This provides a potential strategy for the defendant
to argue undue hardship if they are unable to pay the fines and costs. The
court must also consider alternative methods for satisfying the judgment if
undue hardship is found.

jury, the verdict, the punishment, and other procedural details. This ensures
that the judgment is complete and accurate. If any of these required
elements are missing or incorrect, it could be a basis for appeal or
challenge.
Tex. Transp. Code § 502.473 Tex. Transp. Code § 502.473 Operation of
Vehicle Without Registration Insignia
Extract
A court may dismiss a charge brought under Subsection (a) if the defendant
pays a reimbursement fee not to exceed $10 and: remedies the defect before
the defendant's first court appearance; or shows that the motor vehicle was
issued a registration insignia by the department that was attached to the
motor vehicle, establishing that the vehicle was registered for the period
during which the offense was committed.
Summary
The Texas Transportation Code § 502.473 provides a potential defense for
the charge of operating a vehicle without a registration insignia. Specifically,
the court may dismiss the charge if the defendant remedies the defect
before their first court appearance or shows that the vehicle was registered
for the period during which the offense was committed. This could be a
strategy for the defendant to fight the judgment related to the improperly
displayed or no registration insignia offense.
Tex. Transp. Code § 504.943 Tex. Transp. Code § 504.943 Operation of
Vehicle Without License Plate
Extract
A court may dismiss a charge brought under Subsection (a) if the defendant:
remedies the defect before the defendant's first court appearance; and pays
a reimbursement fee not to exceed $10.

=== PAGE 17 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
The Texas Transportation Code § 504.943 provides a potential defense for
the charge of operating a vehicle without a license plate. Specifically, if the
defendant remedies the defect (i.e., obtains and properly displays the
required license plates) before their first court appearance and pays a
reimbursement fee not exceeding $10, the court may dismiss the charge.
This could be a viable strategy for the defendant to contest the judgment
related to the license plate offense.
Tex. Code Crim. Proc. § 45A.356 Tex. Code Crim. Proc. § 45A.356 Judicial
Actions Following Plea; Show Cause Hearing
Extract
The court shall enter judgment on a defendant's plea of nolo contendere or
guilty at the time the plea is made, defer imposition of the judgment, and
allow the defendant a 90-day period to successfully complete the approved
driving safety course or motorcycle operator training course and present to
the court: a uniform certificate of completion of the driving safety course or
a verification of completion of the motorcycle operator training course;
unless the judge proceeds under Article CODE OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE
45A.359, the defendant's driving record as maintained by the Department of
Public Safety, if any, showing that the defendant has not completed an
approved driving safety course or motorcycle operator training course, as
applicable, within the 12-month period preceding the date of the offense; an
affidavit stating that the defendant: (A) was not taking a driving safety
course or motorcycle operator training course, as applicable, under this
subchapter on the date the request to take the course was made; and (B) has
not completed, within the 12-month period preceding the date of the
offense, a course described by Paragraph (A) that is not shown on the
defendant's driving record; and if the defendant does not have a Texas
driver's license or permit and is a member, or the spouse or dependent child
of a member, of the United States military forces serving on active duty, an
affidavit stating that the defendant: (A) was not taking a driving safety
course or motorcycle operator training course, as applicable, in another
state on the date the request to take the course was made; and (B) has not
completed a course described by Paragraph (A) within the 12-month period
preceding the date of the offense.
Summary
The Texas Code of Criminal Procedure allows for a deferral of judgment and
dismissal of charges if a defendant successfully completes a driving safety
course or motorcycle operator training course. This provision could
potentially be used as a strategy to fight the judgments if the defendant had
not completed such a course within the 12 months preceding the offense
and meets the other requirements outlined in the statute.

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. § 45A.352 Tex. Code Crim. Proc. § 45A.352 Driving
Safety Or Motorcycle Operator Training Course Completion
Extract
The judge shall require a defendant to successfully complete a driving safety
course approved by the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation or a
course under the motorcycle operator training and safety program approved
by the designated state agency under Chapter 662, Transportation Code, if:
the defendant elects driving safety course or motorcycle operator training
course dismissal under this subchapter; ... the defendant is charged with an
offense to which this subchapter applies, other than speeding at a speed of:
(A) 95 miles per hour or more; or (B) 25 miles per hour or more over the
posted speed limit; ...
Summary
Defendants in Texas may have the option to elect for a driving safety course
or motorcycle operator training course dismissal for certain traffic offenses.
However, this option is not available for speeding offenses where the speed
was 95 miles per hour or more, or 25 miles per hour or more over the posted
speed limit. In the case of Ryan Sterling Myers, the speeding offense was
90/70, which is 20 miles per hour over the posted speed limit, and thus may
be eligible for this option if other conditions are met.
Tex. Transp. Code § 502.407 Tex. Transp. Code § 502.407 Operation of
Vehicle With Expired License Plate
Extract
A justice of the peace or municipal court judge having jurisdiction of the
offense may: dismiss a charge of driving with an expired motor vehicle
registration if the defendant: (A) remedies the defect not later than the 20th
working day after the date of the offense or before the defendant's first
court appearance date, whichever is later; and (B) establishes that the fee
prescribed by Section TRANSPORTATION CODE 502.045 has been paid; and
assess a reimbursement fee not to exceed $20 when the charge is dismissed.
Summary
There is a provision in the Texas Transportation Code that allows for the
dismissal of a charge related to expired vehicle registration if the defendant
remedies the defect within a specified time frame and pays the necessary
fee. This could potentially be a strategy for the defendant to contest the
judgment related to the charge of operating a vehicle with improperly
displayed or no registration insignia, provided the conditions are met.
