Question
The Petitioner and her attorney allegedly secured temporary orders through
fraudulent misrepresentations, presented altered agreements, and called
undisclosed witnesses, while the associate judge lacked jurisdiction. The
Respondent was ordered to sign a document he did not agree to, and the
judge signed an order containing false statements about hearings and
agreements. Fraud upon the court undermines the integrity of the judicial
process and can be grounds for setting aside orders or judgments (Hazel-
Atlas Glass Co. v. Hartford-Empire Co., 322 U.S. 238 (1944)). Due process is
violated when a party is deprived of property based on fraudulent
proceedings, especially where the court lacks jurisdiction or the party is
denied a meaningful opportunity to be heard. Intentional attorney
misconduct and fraud upon the court, combined with lack of jurisdiction and
denial of due process, support a claim for federal relief under § 1983. #
ISSUE #1 – DEPRIVATION OF PROPERTY WITHOUT DUE PROCESS OF
LAW Amendment XIV Section 1. All persons born or naturalized in the
United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the
United States and of the state wherein they reside. No state shall make or
enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens
of the United States; nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or
property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its
jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. VIOLATION: On January 16,
2024, James Munford ordered the Respondent to vacate his home, which
also served as his place of business, based on intentionally fabricated claims
raised by the Petitioner, Morgan Michelle Myers. This order was rendered
without a hearing taking place, without any evidence being admitted, and
without the Respondent being able to cross examine his accuser. No
protective order was entered, no emergency situation was shown, and the
case was reset for January 22, 2024, to be heard by the associate judge,
Jeffrey Kaitcer. Section 5. The Congress shall have power to enforce, by
appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article. ISSUE #2 –
SUBSEQUENT ORDERS ARE VOID FOR WANT OF JURISDICITON If an
associate judge in Texas acts without a valid order of referral, they lack
jurisdiction, and actions taken in such circumstances may be considered
ultra vires and outside the protection of judicial immunity. This can support
a claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for injunctive or declaratory relief if the
respondent’s rights were deprived. The Texas Family Code and Government
Code make it unequivocal that an associate judge’s authority to act in a case
is dependent on a valid order of referral from the referring court. The order
of referral is not a mere formality; it is the legal instrument that vests the
associate judge with jurisdiction over the matter (Tex. Fam. Code § 201.006;
Tex. Gov’t. Code § 54A.007; Tex. Gov’t. Code § 54B.007). If an associate
judge acts without such an order, or beyond the scope of the order, they are
acting without jurisdiction. The statutes are clear that the powers of an
associate judge are “contingent upon” and “limited by” the order of referral
(Tex. Fam. Code § 201.007; Tex. Gov’t. Code § 54A.008; Tex. Gov’t. Code §
54A.209). Judicial immunity is a well-established doctrine that shields judges
from liability for judicial acts performed within their jurisdiction, even if
those acts are erroneous, malicious, or in excess of authority (Tobias v. SLP

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Brownwood LLC, No. 11-19-00247-CV (Tex. App. Jun 24, 2021); Walker v.
Hartman, 516 S.W.3d 71 (Tex. App. 2017)). However, this immunity is not
absolute. The U.S. Supreme Court and Texas courts have repeatedly held
that judicial immunity is overcome in two circumstances: (1) when the
judge’s actions are non-judicial in nature, or (2) when the judge acts in the
clear absence of all jurisdiction (Partain v. Gabert, 13-21-00037-CV (Tex.
App. Aug 26, 2021); West v. Robinson, 486 S.W.3d 669 (Tex. App. 2016);
Twilligear v. Carrell, 148 S.W.3d 502 (Tex. App. 2004)). The “clear absence
of all jurisdiction” standard is met when a judge acts without any legal
authority to do so. In the context of associate judges, acting without a valid
order of referral is acting without jurisdiction, not merely in excess of
authority (Tex. Fam. Code § 201.006; Tex. Gov’t. Code § 54A.007). In the
scenario described, the associate judge allegedly took further actions in the
case without a signed order of referral and summarily denied motions
warning of the petitioner’s alleged scheme. Under Texas law, the absence of
a valid referral order means the associate judge lacked jurisdiction to act in
the case (Tex. Fam. Code § 201.006; Tex. Gov’t. Code § 54A.007). Actions
taken in the clear absence of jurisdiction are not protected by judicial
immunity (Partain v. Gabert, 13-21-00037-CV (Tex. App. Aug 26, 2021); West
v. Robinson, 486 S.W.3d 669 (Tex. App. 2016)). If these actions resulted in
the deprivation of the respondent’s rights, the associate judge’s conduct
would be considered ultra vires and outside the scope of judicial immunity,
supporting a § 1983 claim for injunctive or declaratory relief (Patino v. Tex.
Dep't of Ins.-Div. of Workers' Comp., 631 S.W.3d 163 (Tex. App. 2020); City
of El Paso v. Heinrich, 284 S.W.3d 366 (Tex. 2009)). ISSUE #3 –
INTENTIONAL ATTORNEY MISCONDUCT AND THE LACK OF AN
OPPONENT In this case, Morgan Michelle Myers, after securing the March
14, 2024, temporary orders by fraudulent misrepresentations to the court,
she hid behind her alleged attorney who did not prosecute the case for over
18 months. This attorney claimed to be representing the Petitioner in her
individual capacity, yet used the marx altman and johnson letterhead in her
pleadings. Since she was allegedly retained after January 16, 2024,
everything she did in the case is arguably void given the associate judge had
no jurisdiction. On March 14, 2024, this attorney was allowed to trial by
ambush, when she called undisclosed witnesses and produced a proposed
order asking the associate judge, who had no jurisdiction, to deny the
father’s emergency motion which clearly outlined the petitioner’s fraudulent
scheme. Despite not responding to this motion, the judge ruled in her favor,
and signed an order which had altered terms, contained false statements
about hearings that never happened, and gave morgan the home and
claimed the father agreed to it. The father refused to sign it, and he was
actually ordered by the associate judge to sign the fraudulent document. He
refused, and then appealed. ISSUE #3 – APPELLATE PROCESS
INSUFFICIENT The father’s first mandamus was denied without
explanation, and he appealed to the Texas Supreme Court. The opposing
side did not participate at all, and actually attempted to get the OAG
involved mid-appeal, who wasn’t able to enforce the clearly fraudulent
orders. After the Texas Supreme Court denied rehearing, the opposing party
moved to set a pre-trial conference in the face of all of these issues, which
was countered by a motion to recuse both the district and associate judge.
ISSUE #4 – COMPROMISED RECUSAL PROCEEDINGS The recusal
proceedings were just as tainted. On October 7, 2024, Father filed his first

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
motion to recuse against Kaitcer and Munford. A day later, an order of
referral was forwarded by the court coordinator, someone who should not be
involved at all in the recusal process. Upon inspection, the original motion to
recuse had been modified where the hyperlinks were removed, the exhibits
were removed, and the affidavit was removed. This was only corrected after
the Respondent pointed out the discrepancy, which the coordinator then
replied with an exscuse that “due to the size of the motion, it was split into
three separate files”. This is clear tampering. The judge must send the
original motion to the regional judge, not a modified one. An amended order
of referral issued with these changes, however, the hyperlinks were still
removed. COOPER L. CARTER’S FRAUD UPON THE COURT 1. On February
1st, 2024, the parties met for the third time at the 322nd District Court of
Tarrant County. It’s important to note here that no order of referral had
been signed and filed, so the associate judge had no authority to even hear
the matter. 2. Nevertheless, the parties appeared, both represented by
counsel. Father insisted on proceeding to trial, however, his attorney said he
didn’t want to be in court all day, and presented him with a settlement
agreement that he did not find would be in the best interests of his Children.
The proposed agreement had the following provisions, and was prepared by
Dan Bacalis, attorney for Father: i. It was titled “Agreed Associate Judge’s
Report” ii. RESET DATE: blank. iii. Under APPEARANCES, it has both
parties appearing and both represented by counsel, however, only the
Father’s appearance was recorded on the case docket. iv. Under
TEMPORARY CONSERVATORSHIP, it elected JOINT CONSERVATORSHIP
with the mother as the primary conservator. v. It gave the mother the
exclusive right to establish the residence. vi. The right to receive child
support was given to the Mother. vii. Under the TEMPORARY POSSESSION
SCHEDULE, the EXTENDED was elected (TEX. FAM. CODE ANN.§§ 153.311
THROUGH 153.316.) viii. Under TEMPORARY CHILD SUPPORT, it had
Father responsible for making payments in the amount of $973.19 per
month to the Mother beginning on April 1, 2024. ix. Mother was to apply for
Medicaid. x. Under ADDITIONAL ORDERS, the application for protective
order that started all of this was non-suited. xi. Under TEMPORARY
POSESSION OF PROPERTY, it stated Father had the right to the 2020
Mazda 3, his personal belongings, and the Mazda CX-5 lease. It also stated
that Respondent was to vacate the home by March 1, 2024, thus giving him
one full month back into the home. However, this meant that the mother
actually removed the children from their own home for a month, as she lived
with her new boyfriend during this time. xii. Mother was entitled to her
2007 Mazda and her personal property. xiii. Most importantly, right before
the signature lines, the following provision was ordered: “A typed written
Order conforming to this Report will follow within 20 days from the date this
Report is signed. The Temporary Order shall be prepared by Dan Bacalis
Each attorney should approve the Order. The parties do not need to approve
the Order. The attorney reviewing the proposed Order shall have five (5)
days to do so. There arc no ten (JO) day letters. If an agreement is not
reached, a Motion to Sign shall be filed and set within thirty (30) days from
the signing of this Report. xiv. All parties signed this document and agreed
to form and substance, and it was signed by the Associate Judge (who had
no authority to even hear this agreement). The parties did this settlement in
the conference room in the hallway, not before the judge. 3. Because Father
knew Mother was lying, and was leveraging Judge Munford’s initial

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
deprivation of constitutional rights, he immediately fired his attorney, thus
invaliding the agreement, as he would not be able to prepare the reduced
version as ordered and as agreed by the parties. 4. On February 8, 2024, the
agreement was filed with the clerk, and the next day on February 9, 2024,
the Father filed an EMERGENCY MOTION TO RECONSIDER EVIDENCE
AND VACATE TEMPORARY ORDERS, referring to the Feb 1 Agreement. 5.
This motion highlighted in detail Mother’s illegal actions, including falsifying
her affidavit of indigency, falsifying her claims of family violence, and
provided evidence in the form of text messages to show she was having an
affair leading up to the divorce, and also attached bank statements to show
that she transferred $1,576 of community property to herself using a third
party’s paypal account to conceal her banking information. 6. This motion
was served on all of the parties on February 9, 2024. No response was ever
received to this motion. The only response was via email from Cooper
Carter, attorney for petitioner, who stated she would be filing a counter
motion. No such motion was ever filed. 7. On February 27, 2024, District
Judge James Munford signed and filed a notice of hearing, setting the
Father’s emergency motion to be heard on March 14, 2024. 8. On March 3,
2024, Father filed a notice with the Court informing them that he would not
be leaving the marital home because the agreement was invalidated. 9.
Three days later on March 6, 2024, while Father was walking his children to
school, the mother ran inside the home and locked him out, and when the
cops arrived, produced the Feb 1 agreement showing he had to leave by
March 1. To prevent conflict, Father left to stay with his Father until the
time of the hearing. 10. On March 14, 2024, the parties arrived at the 322nd
District Court for Father’s emergency motion. Upon walking into the
courtroom, Father observed Cooper Carter and the mother quickly passing
papers back and forth across the table in the conference room. 11. After
checking in with the bailiff, the Father turned around to see Cooper Carter
handing him a document entitled “Temporary Orders” which were the
reduced version of the February 1 agreement that the parties were in court
that day to challenge. 12. Alongside these orders was a “Proposed Order”
recommending that the judge deny his emergency motion to vacate. The
judge denied the father’s motion without any arguments against his position
being raised, and Cooper Carter called the wife as a witness despite not
disclosing any evidence or potential witnesses prior to the hearing. 13.
Despite non-suiting the protective order in the alleged agreement that they
claimed was still binding, she had the mother testify about fearing for her
safety if the Father was allowed near the home. 14. Upon inspection of the
fraudulent temporary orders produced by Cooper Carter, the following
provisions were unilaterally changed: i. The original agreement required the
father to vacate by March 1, 2024, but the modified version had the father in
the home until March 20, 2024, and the Mother after March 30, 2024,
leaving a 10 day window where nobody would occupy the home. ii. On page
1 of the orders, it expressly stated that “as evidenced by the signatures
below, the parties have agreed to the terms of this order” which was a
blatant lie, as Cooper had unilaterally changed the terms of the agreement
when she knew Dan Bacalis had to be the one to reduce it. iii. The orders
also falsely claimed a hearing occurred on February 1, 2024, on an alleged
“Motion for Temporary Orders” filed by the mother and was never served on
Respondent. iv. The orders also claimed that the agreement was in the best
interests of the children, and that the Court had reviewed the record. v. No

relief in father’s emergency motion was argued against, yet the motion was
summarily denied and the fraudulent orders were adopted by the Court. TIE
THESE FACTS TO A CLAIM FOR FEDERAL RELIEF, CITING THE SPECIFIC
FACTS
Answer (Texas)
Short response
The facts described, if proven, demonstrate a deprivation of property
without due process and actions by an associate judge in the clear absence
of jurisdiction, both of which can support a claim for federal relief under 42
U.S.C. § 1983. Texas law and the provided authorities confirm that
fraudulent court orders, lack of jurisdiction, and denial of a meaningful
hearing undermine the validity of judicial actions and may render such
orders void and subject to federal challenge.
Summary
The scenario involves a series of alleged fraudulent acts and procedural
violations in a Texas family law case, including the securing of temporary
orders through misrepresentation, the presentation of altered agreements,
and the calling of undisclosed witnesses, all while the associate judge lacked
a valid order of referral and thus jurisdiction. Texas statutes require a valid
order of referral for an associate judge to act, and actions taken without
such jurisdiction are ultra vires and not protected by judicial immunity;
when combined with due process violations—such as deprivation of property
without a hearing—these facts can support a federal claim under § 1983.
The legislative framework in Texas is clear that associate judges must have a
written order of referral to exercise jurisdiction, and any orders or actions
taken without such authority are void. Furthermore, fraudulent securing of
document execution is criminalized under Texas law, and both fraud and lack
of jurisdiction are recognized bases for setting aside judgments. The facts,
as alleged, tie directly to these legal principles and, if substantiated, provide
a strong foundation for federal relief based on due process violations and
ultra vires judicial conduct.
Background and Relevant Law
Legislative Framework: Associate Judge Jurisdiction and Due Process
Texas law strictly regulates the authority of associate judges in family law
matters. Under the Texas Family Code, an associate judge may only act in a
case if there is a valid order of referral from the referring court. This
requirement is set out in Tex. Fam. Code § 201.006, which mandates that a
judge must render either an individual or general order of referral
specifying the cases or types of cases to be heard by the associate judge.
Without such an order, the associate judge lacks jurisdiction to act in the

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
matter, and any actions taken are ultra vires, meaning beyond legal
authority (Tex. Fam. Code § 201.006).
Similarly, Tex. Gov’t. Code § 54A.007 requires a written order of referral that
specifies the associate judge’s duties. The absence of such an order means
the associate judge has no legal authority to preside over the case or issue
orders (Tex. Gov’t. Code § 54A.007). The powers of an associate judge,
including conducting hearings and rendering temporary orders, are
explicitly limited by the order of referral (Tex. Fam. Code § 201.007). If an
associate judge acts without a valid order of referral, their actions are void
for want of jurisdiction.
Due process under the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits the state from
depriving any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.
In the context of state court proceedings, this means that a party must be
given notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard before being
deprived of property rights.
Fraudulent Securing of Document Execution
Texas Penal Code § 32.46 criminalizes the act of causing another person,
without effective consent and with intent to defraud or harm, to sign or
execute any document affecting property or pecuniary interest. It also
criminalizes causing a public servant to file or record a purported judgment
or order without effective consent, especially if the document is not
authorized by law (Tex. Pen. Code § 32.46). This statute is directly
implicated where a party is ordered to sign a document under fraudulent
circumstances or where a court order is procured through
misrepresentation.
Fraud and Jurisdiction in Judgments
Texas courts recognize that judgments rendered without jurisdiction or
procured by fraud are not entitled to full faith and credit and may be set
aside. The Texas Court of Appeals has held that issues of fraud and
jurisdiction are always open to investigation, even when judgments are
otherwise entitled to deference (Strick Lease, Inc. v. Cutler, 759 S.W.2d 776
(Tex. App. 1988)).
Analysis
1. Deprivation of Property Without Due Process
The facts allege that the Respondent was ordered to vacate his home and
business premises based on fabricated claims, without a hearing, without
evidence being admitted, and without the opportunity to cross-examine his
accuser. No protective order was entered, and no emergency was shown.
These circumstances, if true, constitute a deprivation of property without
due process, as the Respondent was not afforded notice or a meaningful
opportunity to be heard before being dispossessed of his property.

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Due process requires that before a person is deprived of property, there
must be notice and an opportunity to be heard. The absence of a hearing,
the lack of evidence, and the inability to challenge the opposing party’s
claims all point to a violation of these fundamental requirements. Such a
deprivation is actionable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, which provides a federal
remedy for the deprivation of constitutional rights under color of state law.
2. Void Orders for Want of Jurisdiction
The legislative framework in Texas is unequivocal: an associate judge must
have a valid order of referral to exercise jurisdiction in a case (Tex. Fam.
Code § 201.006; Tex. Gov’t. Code § 54A.007). The powers of the associate
judge are limited by the order of referral (Tex. Fam. Code § 201.007). If the
associate judge acts without such an order, any actions taken are void for
want of jurisdiction.
In the scenario described, the associate judge allegedly acted without a
signed order of referral, presided over hearings, and issued orders. Under
Texas law, these actions are ultra vires and not protected by judicial
immunity. The lack of jurisdiction is not a mere technicality; it is a
fundamental defect that renders all subsequent actions and orders void. This
is supported by the principle that actions taken in the clear absence of
jurisdiction are not protected by judicial immunity and may be challenged in
federal court (Strick Lease, Inc. v. Cutler, 759 S.W.2d 776 (Tex. App. 1988)).
3. Fraudulent Securing of Orders and Attorney Misconduct
The facts further allege that the Petitioner and her attorney secured
temporary orders through fraudulent misrepresentations, presented altered
agreements, and called undisclosed witnesses. The Respondent was ordered
to sign a document he did not agree to, and the judge signed an order
containing false statements about hearings and agreements. These actions,
if proven, fall squarely within the conduct criminalized by Tex. Pen. Code §
32.46, which prohibits causing another to sign a document affecting
property without effective consent and with intent to defraud or harm.
Moreover, the presentation of altered agreements and the making of false
statements to the court constitute fraud upon the court, which undermines
the integrity of the judicial process. Texas law recognizes that fraud and lack
of jurisdiction are grounds for setting aside judgments and orders (Strick
Lease, Inc. v. Cutler, 759 S.W.2d 776 (Tex. App. 1988)). The combination of
fraudulent conduct and lack of jurisdiction creates a compelling case for
federal relief.
4. Appellate and Recusal Proceedings
The facts also describe irregularities in the appellate and recusal process,
including the modification of motions and the involvement of court staff
inappropriately altering filings. While these facts primarily go to the
integrity of the process, they further support the claim that the Respondent

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
was denied a fair and impartial hearing, compounding the due process
violations.
5. Federal Relief Under § 1983
To state a claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, a plaintiff must show that they were
deprived of a constitutional right by a person acting under color of state law.
Here, the deprivation of property without due process, the issuance of
orders by a judge lacking jurisdiction, and the fraudulent securing of court
orders all constitute violations of constitutional rights. The involvement of
state actors (judges and court staff) satisfies the requirement that the
conduct was under color of state law.
Furthermore, judicial immunity does not protect judges who act in the clear
absence of all jurisdiction. Since Texas law requires a valid order of referral
for an associate judge to have jurisdiction, actions taken without such an
order are not protected by judicial immunity and may be challenged under §
1983.
Exceptions and Caveats
While the legal framework is clear, the success of a federal claim will
depend on the ability to prove the alleged facts, including the absence of a
valid order of referral, the fraudulent securing of orders, and the denial of
due process. Additionally, while fraud and lack of jurisdiction are recognized
bases for setting aside judgments, courts may require clear and convincing
evidence of fraud or jurisdictional defects.
It is also important to note that while judicial immunity is not absolute, it is
a strong defense for judges acting within their jurisdiction. The distinction
between actions taken in excess of authority (which are protected) and
actions taken in the clear absence of jurisdiction (which are not) is critical.
The facts must establish that the associate judge acted without any legal
authority, not merely in error or in excess of authority.
Conclusion
In summary, the facts described, if substantiated, demonstrate a deprivation
of property without due process and actions by an associate judge in the
clear absence of jurisdiction, both of which are actionable under 42 U.S.C. §
1983. Texas law requires a valid order of referral for associate judges to act,
and actions taken without such authority are void. Fraudulent securing of
court orders and denial of a meaningful hearing further support the claim
for federal relief. The combination of these factors provides a strong legal
basis for challenging the validity of the orders and seeking federal remedies
for the constitutional violations suffered.

Strick Lease, Inc. v. Cutler, 759 S.W.2d 776 (Tex. App. 1988)

=== PAGE 9 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
It is the contention of the Appellee that full faith and credit need not be
given to a judgment rendered by a foreign court that had no jurisdiction
over the party. While full faith and credit must be given a judgment of
another state so as to preclude inquiry into the merits of the subject matter,
the questions as to fraud Shaps v. Union Commerce Bank, 476 S.W.2d 466
(Tex.Civ.App.--Beaumont 1972, writ ref'd n.r.e.) and jurisdiction Bernard
Gloeckler Co. v. Baker Co., 52 S.W.2d 912 (Tex.Civ.App.--El Paso 1932, no
writ) are subject to investigation.
Summary
The passage highlights that judgments rendered by courts without
jurisdiction over a party are not entitled to full faith and credit. Additionally,
it emphasizes that issues of fraud and jurisdiction are open to investigation,
even when full faith and credit is generally required. This supports the
proposition that fraudulent actions and lack of jurisdiction can undermine
the validity of court orders and judgments, aligning with the argument that
such circumstances can justify setting aside orders or judgments.
Tex. Fam. Code § 201.006 Tex. Fam. Code § 201.006 Order of Referral
Extract
In referring a case to an associate judge, the judge of the referring court
shall render: an individual order of referral; or a general order of referral
specifying the class and type of cases to be heard by the associate judge.
Summary
For an associate judge to have jurisdiction over a case, there must be a valid
order of referral from the referring court. This order can be either an
individual order for a specific case or a general order specifying the types of
cases the associate judge can hear. Without such an order, the associate
judge lacks jurisdiction, and any actions taken may be considered ultra
vires.
Tex. Gov't. Code § 54A.007 Tex. Gov't. Code § 54A.007 Order of Referral
Extract
To refer one or more cases to an associate judge, a judge must issue a
written order of referral that specifies the associate judge's duties.

=== PAGE 10 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
An associate judge in Texas must have a written order of referral to have
jurisdiction over a case. Without such an order, any actions taken by the
associate judge could be considered ultra vires, or beyond their legal
authority. This supports the proposition that the associate judge lacked
jurisdiction if no valid order of referral was issued, which is a critical
element in the claim of fraudulent proceedings and deprivation of due
process.
Tex. Fam. Code § 201.007 Tex. Fam. Code § 201.007 Powers of Associate
Judge
Extract
Except as limited by an order of referral, an associate judge may: conduct a
hearing; hear evidence; compel production of relevant evidence; rule on the
admissibility of evidence; ... without prejudice to the right to a de novo
hearing before the referring court under Section FAMILY CODE 201.015 and
subject to Subsection (c), render and sign: (A) a final order agreed to in
writing as to both form and substance by all parties; (B) a final default
order; (C) a temporary order; or (D) a final order in a case in which a party
files an unrevoked waiver made in accordance with Rule 119, Texas Rules of
Civil Procedure, that waives notice to the party of the final hearing or waives
the party's appearance at the final hearing.
Summary
Powers of an associate judge, including conducting hearings and rendering
temporary orders, but these powers are limited by the order of referral. If an
associate judge acts without a valid order of referral, they lack jurisdiction,
which supports the proposition that actions taken by the associate judge in
this case may have been without jurisdiction.
Tex. Pen. Code § 32.46 Tex. Pen. Code § 32.46 Fraudulent Securing of
Document Execution
Extract
A person commits an offense if the person, with the intent to defraud or
harm any person: causes another person, without that person's effective
consent, to sign or execute any document affecting property or service or
the pecuniary interest of any person; or causes a public servant, without the
public servant's effective consent, to file or record any purported judgment
or other document purporting to memorialize or evidence an act, an order, a
directive, or process of: (A) a purported court that is not expressly created
or established under the constitution or the laws of this state or of the
United States; (B) a purported judicial entity that is not expressly created or

=== PAGE 11 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
established under the constitution or laws of this state or of the United
States; or (C) a purported judicial officer of a purported court or purported
judicial entity described by Paragraph (A) or (B).
Summary
The statute criminalizes the act of causing someone to sign or execute a
document affecting property or pecuniary interest without effective consent,
with the intent to defraud or harm. This directly relates to the proposition
where the Respondent was allegedly ordered to sign a document he did not
agree to, and fraudulent misrepresentations were made to secure temporary
orders. The statute also addresses the filing or recording of documents by a
public servant without consent, which aligns with the claim of fraudulent
court orders being signed and filed.
