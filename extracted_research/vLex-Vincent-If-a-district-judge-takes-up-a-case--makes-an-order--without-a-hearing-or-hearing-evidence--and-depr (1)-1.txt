Question
If a district judge takes up a case, makes an order (without a hearing or
hearing evidence) and deprives one party of his fundamental rights to
property and liberty interest in his children, and then resets the case to be
heard by the associate judge a week later, if he doesn't file an order of
referral, can this error be waived, and if the associate judge takes action in
the abscense of an order of referral, is the actions void? Explain why the
actions are void and it's not waivable since it's jurisdictional supported by
caselaw. The associate judge issued orders affecting fundamental rights
(property and liberty interests in children) without jurisdiction. Orders
issued without jurisdiction are void ab initio and have no legal effect. See In
re Guardianship of V.A., 390 S.W.3d 414, 418 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2012,
pet. denied) (“A judgment rendered without jurisdiction is void and subject
to collateral attack.”). The orders issued by the associate judge in the
absence of a written order of referral are void and must be set aside,
regardless of whether any party objected at the time.
Answer (Texas)
Short response
If an associate judge acts without a written order of referral from the district
judge, any orders issued—including those affecting fundamental rights—are
void for lack of jurisdiction and cannot be rendered valid by waiver or failure
to object. This jurisdictional defect is not waivable and renders the associate
judge’s actions null from the outset.
Summary
Under Texas law, an associate judge may only exercise authority over a case
if the referring court issues a written order of referral, either specific to the
case or by general/omnibus order. If no such order is entered, the associate
judge lacks jurisdiction, and any orders issued—including those affecting
property or parental rights—are void ab initio and have no legal effect,
regardless of whether any party objects or participates in the proceedings.
This jurisdictional requirement is fundamental and cannot be waived by the
parties, as established by both statutory provisions and controlling Texas
appellate decisions. Orders issued without jurisdiction are subject to
collateral attack at any time, and the absence of a referral order is a defect
that cannot be cured by consent, participation, or failure to object.

Background and Relevant Law
Legislative Framework
The Texas Family Code and Texas Government Code set out the
requirements for referring cases to associate judges. The relevant statutes
are clear and consistent:
Tex. Fam. Code § 201.006 requires that a judge referring a case to an
associate judge must render either an individual order of referral or a
general order specifying the class and type of cases to be heard by the
associate judge. This is a mandatory procedural step that confers
jurisdiction on the associate judge to act in the matter.
Tex. Fam. Code § 201.007 enumerates the powers of an associate
judge, but explicitly states that these powers are limited by the order of
referral. Without such an order, the associate judge has no authority to
conduct hearings, issue orders, or otherwise act in the case.
Tex. Fam. Code § 201.307 and Tex. Gov’t Code §§ 54A.007, 54A.
107, 54A.208, 54B.007 all reinforce that a case may only be referred
to an associate judge by a written order of referral, which may be
specific to a case or by omnibus order. The statutes emphasize that the
order of referral is the jurisdictional basis for the associate judge’s
authority.
The legislative scheme thus makes clear that the issuance of a written order
of referral is not a mere formality, but a jurisdictional prerequisite for any
action by an associate judge.
Case Law
Texas appellate courts have repeatedly held that jurisdictional defects—such
as the absence of a valid order of referral—render judicial actions void, not
merely voidable. The following principles are established:
Voidness for Lack of Jurisdiction: A judgment or order is void if the
court or judge rendering it lacked jurisdiction over the parties, the
subject matter, or the capacity to act. This principle is articulated in
cases such as JD Auto Corp. v. Bell, 2023 Tex. App. LEXIS 7890 (Tex.
App. Oct. 13, 2023), Caballero v. Vig, 600 S.W.3d 452 (Tex. App. 2020),
and BMW of N. Am., LLC v. Gunn, No. 05-17-00600-CV (Tex. App. Jul
09, 2018).
Jurisdictional Defects Are Not Waivable: Subject matter jurisdiction
cannot be conferred by consent, participation, or waiver, and may be
challenged at any time, even after judgment or on collateral attack.
This is supported by De Los Santos v. Vargas, No. 13-11-00735-CV (Tex.
App. Jan 24, 2013) and the secondary material on subject matter
jurisdiction.
Orders Without Referral Are Void: Where an associate judge acts
without a valid order of referral, any orders issued are void ab initio.
This is confirmed in In re Laurie, 691 S.W.3d 769 (Tex. App. 2024),
which found that the absence of clear language referring a matter to an
•

associate judge rendered the associate judge’s actions ineffective and
void.
Fundamental Rights and Finality: Orders affecting fundamental
rights, such as property and parental rights, are particularly sensitive
to jurisdictional defects. The courts have held that associate judges may
only render final orders in limited circumstances expressly authorized
by statute, and otherwise their orders are temporary and subject to
review by the referring court (In re R. P., 2023 Tex. App. LEXIS 7890
(Tex. App. Aug. 30, 2023); Graham v. Graham, 414 S.W.3d 800 (Tex.
App. 2013)).
Analysis
The Requirement of a Written Order of Referral
The Texas Family Code and Government Code unambiguously require a
written order of referral as a jurisdictional prerequisite for an associate
judge to act. The statutes do not provide for any exceptions to this
requirement, nor do they suggest that the requirement can be satisfied by
implication, oral direction, or after-the-fact ratification.
Tex. Fam. Code § 201.006 and Tex. Gov’t Code § 54A.007 both state
that a judge “shall” or “must” issue a written order of referral to assign
cases to an associate judge. The use of mandatory language
underscores the jurisdictional nature of the requirement.
Tex. Fam. Code § 201.007 makes clear that the associate judge’s
powers are “limited by an order of referral,” and without such an order,
the associate judge has no authority to act.
The legislative materials are reinforced by the case law, which consistently
holds that the absence of a written order of referral deprives the associate
judge of jurisdiction. In In re Laurie, 691 S.W.3d 769 (Tex. App. 2024), the
court found that an order setting a proceeding before “this Court” was
ambiguous and did not provide effective notice of referral to an associate
judge, rendering any actions by the associate judge void for lack of
jurisdiction.
Voidness and Non-Waivability of Jurisdictional Defects
The Texas courts have drawn a clear distinction between void and voidable
orders. An order is void if the court or judge rendering it lacked jurisdiction;
such orders have no legal effect and may be attacked at any time, directly or
collaterally. This principle is articulated in JD Auto Corp. v. Bell, 2023 Tex.
App. LEXIS 7890 (Tex. App. Oct. 13, 2023), Caballero v. Vig, 600 S.W.3d 452
(Tex. App. 2020), and De Los Santos v. Vargas, No. 13-11-00735-CV (Tex.
App. Jan 24, 2013).
The secondary material on subject matter jurisdiction further explains that a
judgment rendered without subject matter jurisdiction is void ab initio and
of no effect, and that such defects are not subject to waiver. The issue of
• 
• 
• 

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any time, even after judgment
or on appeal, and courts have an affirmative duty to address it sua sponte.
This principle is particularly important in cases involving fundamental
rights, such as property and parental rights, where the consequences of void
orders can be severe and far-reaching.
Application to the Scenario
In the scenario presented, the district judge did not issue a written order of
referral before the associate judge took action. As a result, the associate
judge lacked jurisdiction to act in the case, and any orders issued—including
those affecting property and liberty interests in children—are void ab initio.
The absence of a written order of referral is a jurisdictional defect that
cannot be cured by consent, participation, or failure to object. The
parties’ actions or inactions are irrelevant to the associate judge’s lack
of authority.
The orders issued by the associate judge have no legal effect and are
subject to collateral attack at any time. They must be set aside,
regardless of whether any party objected at the time or participated in
the proceedings.
This result is compelled by both the statutory framework and the controlling
case law. The courts have consistently held that jurisdictional defects are not
waivable and that orders issued without jurisdiction are void.
Orders Affecting Fundamental Rights
The fact that the associate judge’s orders affected fundamental rights—such
as property and parental rights—does not alter the analysis. If anything, it
underscores the importance of strict adherence to jurisdictional
requirements. The Texas courts have emphasized that associate judges may
only render final orders in limited circumstances expressly authorized by
statute, and otherwise their orders are temporary and subject to review by
the referring court (In re R. P., 2023 Tex. App. LEXIS 7890 (Tex. App. Aug.
30, 2023); Graham v. Graham, 414 S.W.3d 800 (Tex. App. 2013)).
Where, as here, the associate judge acts without jurisdiction, the orders are
void and must be set aside.
Exceptions and Caveats
There are no relevant exceptions in the statutory or case law materials
provided. The requirement of a written order of referral is absolute and
jurisdictional. The statutes do allow for general or omnibus orders of
referral, but in the absence of any such order, the associate judge has no
authority to act.
The only limited exceptions to the associate judge’s lack of authority to
render final orders are those expressly provided in Tex. Fam. Code §
• 
• 

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
201.007, such as agreed final orders, default orders, or orders where
parties have waived the right to a de novo hearing. However, even these
exceptions presuppose the existence of a valid order of referral conferring
jurisdiction on the associate judge. Without such an order, none of the
exceptions apply.
No case in the provided materials suggests that the requirement of a written
order of referral can be waived or satisfied by implication. On the contrary,
the courts have consistently held that jurisdictional defects are not waivable
and render judicial actions void.
Conclusion
In summary, Texas law is clear that an associate judge may only act pursuant
to a written order of referral from the referring court. The absence of such
an order is a jurisdictional defect that renders any orders issued by the
associate judge void ab initio and of no legal effect. This defect is not
waivable and may be raised at any time, directly or collaterally. The
statutory framework and controlling case law leave no room for doubt:
orders issued by an associate judge without jurisdiction must be set aside,
regardless of the parties’ actions or the nature of the rights affected.
The most crucial point is that jurisdictional requirements are fundamental to
the validity of judicial actions. Where an associate judge acts without a
written order of referral, the resulting orders are nullities and cannot be
salvaged by waiver, consent, or participation. This ensures the integrity of
the judicial process and the protection of fundamental rights.

A litigant may attack a void judgment directly or collaterally, but a voidable
judgment may only be attacked directly. See Hagen v. Hagen, 282 S.W.3d
899, 902 (Tex. 2009). Because of this distinction, when a party challenges
the trial court's judgment as void, our first inquiry must be to determine
whether the alleged defect renders the judgment void or merely voidable. ...
A judgment is void only when it is apparent that the court rendering
judgment had no jurisdiction of the parties or property, no jurisdiction of the
subject matter, no jurisdiction to enter the particular judgment, or no
capacity to act.

Summary
A judgment is considered void if the court lacks jurisdiction over the parties,
subject matter, or the capacity to act as a court. This aligns with the
proposition that actions taken by an associate judge without a proper order

JD Auto Corp. v. Bell
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Any time after the time for filing an appeal has expired, a party to a final
judgment may collaterally attack the judgment on the ground that the
judgment was void. Caballero v. Vig, 600 S.W.3d 452, 458 (Tex. App.-El Paso
2020, pet. denied). A judgment is void-rather than voidable-when 'the court
rendering judgment had no jurisdiction of the parties or property, no
jurisdiction of the subject matter, no jurisdiction to enter the particular
judgment, or no capacity to act.' PNS Stores, Inc., 379 S.W.3d 267 at 272.
Summary
A judgment is void if the court lacks jurisdiction over the parties, subject
matter, or the capacity to act. This directly supports the proposition that
actions taken by an associate judge without a proper order of referral are
void due to lack of jurisdiction. The passage also indicates that such
jurisdictional defects render a judgment void, not voidable, meaning they
cannot be waived and can be attacked collaterally at any time.

Extract
On the other hand, if the facts set out did not confer jurisdiction upon the
district court to issue the writ of injunction, then its action in doing so is
wholly void... when they step beyond the jurisdiction conferred on them by
law, then, and in that instance only, is the court without authority to enforce
its decrees... No such inferior judge is given, directly or indirectly, any such
power, authority, or jurisdiction, and any assumption of the same by any
such judge is an absolute usurpation, and whatever he does attempting this
is a nullity and void.
Summary
Concept of jurisdiction and the consequences of actions taken without
proper jurisdiction. It emphasizes that actions taken by a court or judge
without jurisdiction are void and null. This directly supports the proposition
that if an associate judge acts without a proper order of referral, their
actions are void. The passage also highlights that jurisdictional errors are
not waivable, as they go to the core authority of the court to act.

Extract
A judgment is void, rather than merely voidable, when it is apparent that the
court rendering judgment 'had no jurisdiction of the parties or property, no
jurisdiction of the subject matter, no jurisdiction to enter the particular

(Tex. 2005), quoting Browning v. Placke, 698 S.W.2d 362, 363 (Tex. 1985).
Summary
A judgment is considered void if the court lacks jurisdiction over the parties,
the subject matter, or the capacity to act. This directly supports the
proposition that actions taken by an associate judge without a proper order
of referral are void because the associate judge would lack jurisdiction to
act in the absence of such an order.

Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
An associate judge does not have the power to render a final judgment
outside the context of certain limited exceptions listed in section 201.007 of
the Texas Family Code. ... Thus, '[u]nless authorized by section 201.007, an
associate judge's proposed order or recommendation has only temporary
effect, pending appeal to the referring trial court.' ... In other words, when a
party timely files a request for a de novo hearing before the referring court,
an associate judge's order is not a final, appealable order.
Summary
An associate judge's orders are not final and only have temporary effect
unless they fall within specific exceptions outlined in section 201.007 of the
Texas Family Code. This supports the proposition that without proper
jurisdiction or referral, any orders made by an associate judge are not final
and can be challenged. The passage also indicates that a timely request for a
de novo hearing before the referring court further prevents the associate
judge's order from being final or appealable, reinforcing the idea that
jurisdictional errors cannot be waived and result in void actions.

Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Associate judges do not have the power to render final judgment outside the
context of certain limited exceptions listed in section 201.007 of the Family
Code. See Tex. Fam.Code Ann. § 201.007(a)(14) (listing orders that associate
judges may render and sign); Chacon v. Chacon, 222 S.W.3d 909, 913
(Tex.App.-El Paso 2007, no pet.). ... Except when authorized by section
201.007, an associate judge's proposed orders or recommendations have
only temporary effect, pending appeal to the referring trial court. See id. §
201.013.
Summary
Associate judges in Texas do not have the authority to render final
judgments unless specifically authorized by section 201.007 of the Family
Code. Their orders are temporary and subject to review by the referring trial
court. Without a proper order of referral, any actions taken by the associate
judge would lack jurisdiction and thus be void. This supports the proposition
that actions taken without jurisdiction are void and not waivable, as they are
fundamental jurisdictional errors.

In re Laurie 691 S.W.3d 769
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
As to actual notice, the October 19, 2023 order contained at least two
deficiencies that rendered it ineffective in providing Laurie with notice. The
order stated, in relevant part, that 'the Court sets the above-styled and
numbered cause for a court proceeding before this Court.' First, the term
'court proceeding' is insufficiently specific to apprise an ordinary reader of
the nature of the proceeding for purposes of determining whether it was a
trial on the merits and therefore subject to objection. Section 201.005 of the
Texas Family Code explicitly governs the time frame for objecting to 'an
associate judge hearing a trial on the merits,' where 'trial on the merits' is
defined as 'any final adjudication from which an appeal may be taken to a
court of appeals.' ... Second, the order states that the proceeding will be
'before this Court.' Although the latter phrase can be understood to denote
any of the judicial officers authorized to preside over proceedings in the
district, it is also reasonably susceptible to the interpretation Laurie claims
to have given it—that the district judge who signed the order would preside
over the noticed proceeding. Furthermore, Laurie’s interpretation has
additional weight given that the order did not include any language
expressly stating that the matter had been referred to an associate judge
nor any language referencing the applicable local rules governing referrals.
That ambiguity is fatal to the proposition that the order provided Laurie with
effective notice of the referral.
Summary
The order setting the court proceeding was ambiguous and did not
effectively notify Laurie of the referral to an associate judge. The lack of
specific language indicating a referral to an associate judge and the absence
of reference to local rules governing such referrals rendered the notice
ineffective. This supports the proposition that actions taken by an associate
judge without proper referral are void, as the notice was insufficient to
inform the party of the referral, thus affecting jurisdiction.

Summary
The Texas Family Code requires a formal referral process for a case to be
heard by an associate judge. If there is no proper referral, the associate
judge lacks jurisdiction, and any orders issued are void. The passage
highlights the necessity of a written order of referral and the opportunity for
parties to object to such referrals. Without a proper referral, the associate
judge's actions are void, and this error is not waivable as it is jurisdictional.

Extract
In referring a case to an associate judge, the judge of the referring court
shall render: an individual order of referral; or a general order of referral
specifying the class and type of cases to be heard by the associate judge.
Summary
A judge of the referring court must render an order of referral, either
individual or general, when referring a case to an associate judge. This
requirement is a procedural mandate, and failure to comply with it means
that the associate judge lacks jurisdiction to act on the case. Without
jurisdiction, any orders issued by the associate judge are void ab initio,
meaning they have no legal effect from the outset. This aligns with the legal
principle that jurisdictional errors cannot be waived and can be challenged
at any time.

admissibility of evidence; issue a summons for: (A) the appearance of
witnesses; and (B) the appearance of a parent who has failed to appear
before an agency authorized to conduct an investigation of an allegation of
abuse or neglect of a child after receiving proper notice; examine a witness;

substance by all parties; (B) a final default order; (C) a temporary order; or
(D) a final order in a case in which a party files an unrevoked waiver made in
accordance with Rule 119, Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, that waives notice
to the party of the final hearing or waives the party's appearance at the final
hearing; take action as necessary and proper for the efficient performance
of the associate judge's duties; and render and sign a final order if the
parties waive the right to a de novo hearing before the referring court under
Section FAMILY CODE 201.015 in writing before the start of a hearing
conducted by the associate judge.
Summary
Powers of an associate judge, which are contingent upon an order of
referral. Without such an order, the associate judge lacks jurisdiction to take
actions such as conducting hearings or issuing orders. This supports the
proposition that actions taken by an associate judge without a proper order
of referral are void due to lack of jurisdiction. The passage emphasizes the
necessity of an order of referral for the associate judge to exercise their
powers, indicating that any actions taken without it are not legally valid.

Summary
A judge has the authority to refer cases to an associate judge, but this
authority is contingent upon the court having jurisdiction over the matter.
The passage implies that a formal referral process is necessary for an
associate judge to have jurisdiction over a case. Without a proper referral,
any actions taken by the associate judge would be without jurisdiction and
therefore void.

Summary
A referring court must issue an order of referral to refer cases to an
associate judge. This requirement is jurisdictional, meaning that without
such an order, the associate judge lacks the authority to act on the case. The
absence of an order of referral means that any actions taken by the
associate judge are without jurisdiction and therefore void. This aligns with
the legal principle that orders issued without jurisdiction are void ab initio

Summary
The referral of a case to an associate judge must be done through an order
of referral, which can be specific to a case or through an omnibus order.
This requirement is crucial because it establishes the jurisdiction and
authority of the associate judge to act on the case. Without such an order,
the associate judge lacks jurisdiction, and any actions taken would be void.
The passage supports the proposition that the absence of an order of

Summary
A case may only be referred to an associate judge through an order of
referral, either specific to the case or through an omnibus order. This
indicates that without such an order, the associate judge does not have the

Summary
The passage clearly states that a judge must issue a written order of referral
to assign cases to an associate judge. This requirement is a procedural
necessity, and without such an order, the associate judge lacks the
jurisdiction to act on the case. The absence of a written order of referral
means that any actions taken by the associate judge are without jurisdiction

Chapter I.B: Subject Matter Jurisdiction
International Aspects of U.S. Litigation. A Practitioner’s Deskbook.
Volume 1 - American Bar Association - James E. Berger
Extract
a judgment rendered by a court in a case over which the court lacks subject
matter jurisdiction is void ab initio and of no effect—its effect is the same as
if it never had been entered. Indeed, subject matter jurisdiction is so
important that it is one of the few types of defenses that are not subject to
waiver, as it may be raised at any time by any of the parties, even after a
judgment already has been rendered or after a case has gone up on appeal.
Lack of subject matter jurisdiction even may be raised by a court sua sponte.
To be sure, not only are courts authorized to raise the issue of subject
matter jurisdiction on their own initiative if the parties have failed to do so,
they have an affirmative duty to do so.
Summary
The passage clearly states that any judgment rendered without subject
matter jurisdiction is void ab initio, meaning it is null from the outset and
has no legal effect. This aligns with the proposition that actions taken by an
associate judge without a proper order of referral (which would confer
jurisdiction) are void. Furthermore, the passage emphasizes that subject
matter jurisdiction cannot be waived and can be challenged at any time,
supporting the idea that the error cannot be waived and must be addressed.
Section 54A.007. Order of Referral
Extract
To refer one or more cases to an associate judge, a judge must issue a
written order of referral that specifies the associate judge's duties.
Summary
The passage clearly states that a judge must issue a written order of referral
to assign cases to an associate judge. This requirement is procedural and
jurisdictional, meaning that without such an order, the associate judge lacks
the authority to act on the case. The absence of a written order of referral
means that any actions taken by the associate judge are without jurisdiction
and therefore void. This aligns with the legal principle that orders issued
without jurisdiction are void ab initio and have no legal effect, as supported
by the case In re Guardianship of V.A., 390 S.W.3d 414, 418 (Tex. App.—San
Antonio 2012, pet. denied).

Section 54B.007. Order of Referral
Extract
To refer cases to an associate judge, the referring court must issue an order
of referral.
Summary
An order of referral is required for a case to be referred to an associate
judge. This implies that without such an order, the associate judge does not
have the jurisdiction to act on the case. The requirement for an order of
referral is a procedural safeguard to ensure that the associate judge's
actions are within the bounds of their authority. Therefore, any actions taken
by the associate judge without this order would be void due to lack of
jurisdiction.
