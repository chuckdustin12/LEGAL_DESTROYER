Question
IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT
OF OKLAHOMA CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, Plaintiff, v. DANIEL KENNETH
BRANTHOOVER & MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS Defendants § § § § § Civil
No.: 5:24-cv-01311 § § § § § FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT Plaintiff Charles
Dustin Myers, representing himself pro-se and proceeding in forma pauperis
respectfully files this First Amended Complaint against Daniel Kenneth
Branthoover and Morgan Michelle Myers. The original complaint filed on
December 16, 2024, is respectfully amended to incorporate Morgan
Michelle Myers as an additional defendant and Plaintiff has provided this
Court with the necessary materials to effectuate service prior to the July 11
deadline, as extended by this court pursuant to its’ recent order issued on
June 11, 2025. See Doc 15. In support of this amended complaint, Plaintiff
alleges the following: II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 1. This Honorable
Court possesses subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28
U.S.C. § 1331, as Plaintiff’s claims arise under the laws of the United States,
specifically the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO),
18 U.S.C. § 1964(c) and § 1964(d), which explicitly grants federal courts
jurisdiction over civil RICO actions. Further, jurisdiction is established under
18 U.S.C. § 1965, which provides for nationwide service of process and
jurisdiction in RICO actions, thereby ensuring that all Defendants,
regardless of their physical location within the United States, are subject to
the jurisdiction of this Court. 2. Venue is proper in the United States District
Court for the Western District of Oklahoma pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 1965(a)
and 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b). A substantial part of the events or omissions giving
rise to the claims asserted herein occurred within this District. 3.
Additionally, “any person injured in his business or property by reason of a
violation of section 1962…may sue therefor in any appropriate United States
district court and shall recover threefold the damages he sustains and the
cost of the suit, including a reasonable attorney’s fee…” 18 U.S.C § 1964.
Plaintiff alleges a direct injury to his business and property as a result from
the alleged predicate acts herein. III. PARTIES A. Identification 4. Plaintiff

representing himself in this matter. 11. Myers is believed to be self-
represented at this time. 12. Branthoover is believed to be self-represented
at this time. IV. INTRODUCTION 13. This action exposes a breathtaking
betrayal of trust and systematic abuse of judicial process that shocks the
conscience. Defendants orchestrated an interstate racketeering enterprise
with four criminal objectives designed to destroy Plaintiff's life: (1) the
calculated theft of Plaintiff's constitutionally protected property rights; (2)

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
the deliberate corruption of Texas courts through perjury and fabricated
evidence; (3) the procurement of fraudulent advantages in divorce
proceedings through judicial deception; and (4) the concealment of their
crimes to ensure permanent deprivation of Plaintiff's rights and livelihood by
obtaining a final decree of divorce. 14. The enterprise's methods reveal a
level of premeditation and malice that defies comprehension. Defendants
weaponized the judicial system itself, transforming courts designed to
protect citizens into instruments of theft and oppression. Their scheme
employed interstate travel for criminal coordination, systematic perjury in
sworn documents, interstate money laundering to finance their crimes, and
the calculated abuse of federal law enforcement services to legitimize their
fraud. Each element demonstrates contempt for law, justice, and basic
human decency. 15. The enterprise commenced with an act of stunning
audacity: while still married to and living with Plaintiff, Defendant Myers
secretly coordinated with Defendant Branthoover to file fraudulent
protective order applications in Texas courts. This initial betrayal
established the enterprise's core methodology—the systematic corruption of
judicial proceedings through fabricated allegations and perjurious
statements designed to transform Plaintiff from husband into victim.
16.When their initial assault on judicial integrity failed on December 14,
2023, Defendants escalated their criminal conduct through calculated
deception. Branthoover contacted Plaintiff with false offers of assistance,
exploiting Plaintiff's emotional vulnerability during marital crisis to facilitate
the next phase of their scheme. This manipulation enabled Myers' interstate
travel to Oklahoma under the pretense of seeking "space" while
coordinating the preparation of fraudulent legal documents to be deployed
against Texas courts. 17. The enterprise's financial crimes demonstrate
disregard for Plaintiff's survival and livelihood. While Plaintiff believed his
wife was seeking emotional space, Defendants executed a coordinated theft
of the family's financial resources, transferring $1,576 from the joint marital
PNC bank account to Branthoover's PayPal account, which was later
transferred to Myers in furtherance of the scheme once she arrived in
Oklahoma. This theft occurred while Myers maintained the facade of a
grieving spouse, revealing the calculated cruelty underlying their criminal
enterprise. 18. When confronted with evidence of their theft, Defendants
abandoned all pretense of legitimacy. Branthoover explicitly disclosed his
role as architect of the criminal scheme, admitting his intention to “help
with the paperwork” and that he “hopes he can make the divorce process go
as smoothly as possible” while preparing documents for Texas court
submission. This admission revealed the enterprise's hierarchical structure
and Branthoover's administrative control over operations designed to
destroy Plaintiff's legal rights. 19. The enterprise's use of stolen funds to
purchase instruments of continued deception demonstrates the systematic
nature of their criminal planning. Defendants utilized the proceeds of their
theft to acquire a secondary telephone number for Myers, which was
subsequently used on fraudulent court documents to conceal
communications related to their racketeering activities from Plaintiff and to
further a narrative of protection. This purchase reveals their intent to
maintain operational security while continuing to deceive Texas courts. 20.
The fraudulent documents prepared through this interstate criminal
conspiracy represent a systematic assault on judicial integrity. These
documents contained fabricated allegations of domestic violence designed to

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
influence courts into granting protective orders, false claims regarding
property ownership intended to misrepresent marital assets and financial
responsibility, material misrepresentations about indigency to avoid court
costs, and perjurious statements regarding nonexistent prior protective
orders that allege family violence occurred during the marriage. Each false
statement was crafted to maximize harm to Plaintiff while providing
maximum benefit to the criminal enterprise. 21. The enterprise achieved its
criminal objectives through the complete corruption of Texas judicial
proceedings. On January 16, 2024, Texas courts, relying entirely on the
fraudulent documents and perjurious statements prepared by the interstate
criminal enterprise, entered orders that accomplished part of Defendants'
goals. 22. The common goal to deprive Plaintiff of his residence, thereby
affording Myers a significant advantage in State proceedings succeeded.
However, the finalization of this scheme, against all odds, has not yet been
satisfied due to Plaintiff’s zealous advocation for his Constitutionally
protected rights. 23. The enterprise's partial success reveals the ongoing
threat posed by Defendants' criminal association to finalize the scheme.
Rather than ceasing their criminal activities after achieving initial success,
Defendants continued coordinating their operations through May 24, 2025,
using interstate communications regarding the proceedings amongst the
Defendants, and by threatening Plaintiff via text messages as he sought
relief in the Texas appellate courts, demonstrating their intent to maintain
the benefits of their crimes while preventing discovery of their fraudulent
conduct. 24. Throughout the state court proceedings, Defendant
Branthoover engaged in systematic intimidation designed to intimidate and
harass Plaintiff. These communications explicitly acknowledged his central
role in the fraudulent scheme while threatening escalated criminal conduct.
Both Defendants possessed full knowledge of their perjurious statements
and fraudulent representations to Texas courts. Their coordinated
preparation of false documents in Oklahoma, their systematic concealment
of communications through fraudulent telephone numbers, their continued
coordination following partial judicial success, and their ongoing efforts to
prevent discovery demonstrate conscious participation in a criminal
enterprise designed to corrupt judicial proceedings for personal enrichment.
25. The enterprise's assault on Plaintiff's business operations reveals the
calculated cruelty underlying their criminal conduct. Defendants knew that
Plaintiff operated his legitimate business from the marital residence and
that their fraudulent scheme would have the potential to destroy his
livelihood. Their intentional influence of the courts resulting in the
deprivation of his property interests and business location caused
immediate, substantial, and ongoing harm to his income, destroyed his
credit, forced dramatic increases in his cost of living, and imposed legal
costs to defend against their fraudulent litigation. This destruction of
Plaintiff's economic foundation was not collateral damage but a calculated
objective of their criminal enterprise. 26. The predicate acts committed by
this interstate racketeering enterprise include multiple violations of federal
criminal law: systematic wire fraud through interstate communications
designed to deceive Plaintiff and Texas courts, potential mail fraud through
the abuse of United States Marshall Service to legitimize fraudulent
documents, money laundering through interstate transfer of funds derived
from criminal activity, and potentially obstruction of justice for the interstate
activity that was designed to corruptly influence the Texas judiciary. Each

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
predicate act was committed in furtherance of the enterprise's criminal
objectives and demonstrates the sophisticated nature of Defendants' assault
on federal and state legal systems. 27. This interstate racketeering
enterprise represents an unprecedented assault on the integrity of judicial
proceedings and the sanctity of marital relationships. Defendants
transformed the most intimate human bond—marriage—into a weapon for
systematic theft and judicial corruption. Their success in manipulating Texas
courts through documents prepared in Oklahoma, financed through
interstate money laundering, and legitimized through federal mail services
should not be tolerated by any U.S. District Court. V. STATEMENT OF FACTS
28. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations
contained in paragraphs 1 through 27 above, as if fully set forth herein. A.
Party References 29. For clarity and ease of reference throughout this
Complaint, the parties shall be referred to as follows: i. Plaintiff Charles
Dustin Myers shall be referred to herein as “Plaintiff ” and is the husband of
Morgan Michelle Myers. ii. Defendant Daniel Kenneth Branthoover shall be
referred to herein as “Branthoover” and is identified as the stepfather of
Defendant Morgan Michelle Myers. iii. Defendant Morgan Michelle Myers
shall be referred to herein as “Myers” and is identified as the spouse of
Plaintiff Charles Dustin Myers and stepdaughter of Branthoover. 30. At all
relevant times, Defendant Myers has not raised any defenses to these claims
in State court and has ignored all settlement offers made in an attempt to
avoid this lawsuit. 31. At all relevant times, Defendants have maintained
communications regarding the affairs of the enterprise’s purpose. B.
Formation of the Enterprise (December 14 – 15, 2023) 32. Defendant
Branthoover has extensive knowledge of protective orders given his prior
criminal convictions. 33. On December 14, 2023, in response to the
discovery of an extramarital affair by the Plaintiff, Defendant Myers opened
a private bank account in her own name and began interstate
communications with Branthoover via text message. In total, Myers and
Branthoover exchanged a total of 92 text messages between Branthoover’s
number registered as 940-312-3434, and Myers’ number registered as
817-235-5189 on this date. 34. Also on December 14, 2023, Defendant
Myers, without legitimate cause or factual basis, sought an ex-parte order of
protection against Plaintiff while in communications with Branthoover. 35.
Later on the evening of December 14, 2023, in a stark contrast to her earlier
emergency request for a protective order, Defendant Myers reminded
Plaintiff of a school field trip scheduled for the following day, thereby
attempting to maintain a facade of normalcy and prevent Plaintiff from
suspecting of her fraudulent intentions. C. Deception, Transfer, and Planned
Interstate Travel (December 15–17, 2023) 36. On December 15, 2023,
Plaintiff was contacted by Branthoover at 9:51 A.M. CST, where he stated
“I’ve been where you are before. I want to help both of you” regarding a
recent divorce announcement made by Myers on December 1, 2023. 37.
During this phone conversation, it was established that Myers would visit his
residence over the weekend of December 15, 2023, located within this
district, for the purpose of “providing space” to Myers. 38. At this time, it’s
important to note that Plaintiff had no knowledge of the ex-parte attempt
made the day prior, and he had no reason to believe that Branthoover was
being dishonest about his intentions for Myers’ visit to his residence. 39.
Immediately after the call, Plaintiff received notice that Myers had
transferred $1,576 from the parties’ joint–marital PNC account to

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Branthoover’s PayPal account (username “dmb575”), depleting the
account’s balance. 40. On December 16, 2023, Plaintiff received notification
that the joint marital PNC bank account was overdrawn by -$800.00.
Concurrently, Plaintiff was informed that advertisements related to his
legitimate at-home business had ceased running due to a failure of payment.
41. The PNC bank statement for December 2023 clearly documents the
occurrence of this transaction, demonstrating the precise date and amount
of the unauthorized withdrawal. 42. The PayPal identifier “dmb575” directly
matches the information associated with the fraudulent transfer on
Plaintiff’s bank statement for December of 2023, linking Defendant
Branthoover to the illicit financial maneuver notwithstanding his admissions
via text message. 43. On December 16, 2023, at precisely 3:54 P.M. Central
Standard Time, Plaintiff, to mitigate the financial damage and resolve the
situation amicably, sent a text message to Defendant Branthoover. In this
message, Plaintiff explicitly requested the return of the $1,576.00 that had
been fraudulently transferred, detailing the intended use of the funds, the
late bills resulting from misappropriation, his inability to work due to the
severe mental anguish caused by the Defendants’ actions, and his sincere
desire for an amicable resolution given the time of year. 44. In a callous and
dismissive response to Plaintiff’s plea, Defendant Branthoover informed
Plaintiff via text message that “You Are Getting Divorced” and further
stated, “I hope I can help with the paperwork and make things go as
smoothly as possible.” This communication, far from helping as initially
stated by Branthoover, served as a direct threat and an overt act in
furtherance of the conspiracy, demonstrating Branthoover’s intent to exploit
Plaintiff’s distress for the benefit of the enterprise. 45. At no time relevant to
this Complaint has Defendant Branthoover possessed a license to practice
law in any state within the United States. In subsequent texts, his
statements regarding “paperwork” and making things “go as smoothly as
possible” constituted the unauthorized practice of law and that he held an
administrative role over the affairs of the enterprise. D. Eviction Attempt
Influenced by Myers in Furtherance of the Scheme (December 17–22, 2023)
46. On December 17, 2023, at approximately 11:00 A.M., Plaintiff was
served with an eviction notice by the grandmother of Myers, which
contained the following false information: i. A purported “lease violation,”
which was entirely fabricated as no valid lease agreement existed between
Plaintiff and Wilson; ii. The assertion that “Granddaughter getting divorced,”
referring to Defendant Myers, as a basis for eviction; iii. The false claim that
a “Protective order has been filed.” iv. The directive that “He must leave.
She and the girls may stay,” demonstrating the clear intent to dispossess
Plaintiff for the benefit of Myers. 47. Defendant Myers was physically
present in Oklahoma with Defendant Branthoover, actively collaborating in
the drafting of the very documents referenced in the frivolous eviction
notice, thereby demonstrating clear premeditation and coordination of the
scheme. 48. Defendant Myers possessed actual knowledge that no valid
lease agreement existed, and on December 17, 2023, Myers herself
physically tore the fraudulent eviction notice in half and wrote “VOID” on
the document in black sharpie, showing her influence over the attempt. E. A
Narrative of Protection, Secondary Phone, and Initiation of Suit 49.
Defendant Myers also returned from Oklahoma with a can of pepper spray
mace to further the narrative of protection first established on December 14,
2023, in her ex-parte attempt. 50. On the evening of December 17, 2023,

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Defendant Morgan Michelle Myers explicitly disclosed to Plaintiff Charles
Dustin Myers that she had acquired a secondary phone number while in
Oklahoma, registered under the number 817-940-0852. This acquisition was
a deliberate act of concealment and an overt act in furtherance of the
enterprise, designed to facilitate clandestine communications related to the
fraudulent scheme. 51. This newly acquired phone number (817-940-0852)
was subsequently used on a series of fraudulent legal documents prepared
under the direct administrative oversight of Defendant Branthoover, with his
full knowledge and participation. These documents, which were prepared in
Oklahoma and designed to unlawfully influence legal proceedings in Texas,
included: i. An “Original Petition for Divorce,” dated December 18, 2023,
which contained numerous false statements. ii. An “Affidavit of Indigency,”
dated December 18, 2023, which contained material misrepresentations
regarding Defendant Myers’ financial status. iii. A “Request for Uncontested
Cases,” dated December 18, 2023, which was filed despite Plaintiff not
conversing with defendant Myers regarding any divorce litigation. iv. An
“Application for Protective Order,” dated December 22, 2023, which was
based on fabricated allegations of family violence. F. Continued Obstruction
and Unauthorized Practice of Law 52. After the initial divorce paperwork
was filed on December 18, 2023, Defendant Branthoover, continuing his
unauthorized practice of law and his role in the conspiracy, sent a text
message to Plaintiff stating: “Charlie, it’s come to my understanding you
have retained an attorney. I’m sure he has told you that all further
communication should take place between attorneys. I must formally ask
you refrain from discussing details of this case with my client moving
forward and only communicate with me or your attorney.” (emphasis added)
This communication was a deliberate attempt to isolate Plaintiff from direct
communication with Myers and to control the flow of information, thereby
hindering Plaintiff’s ability to uncover the full extent of the fraudulent
scheme. This communication also evidences that Branthoover’s role went
beyond helping Myers prepare the documents by seeing them through to
their submission and asserted an administrative role over the proceedings in
an attempt to intimidate Plaintiff. G. Service by US Marshall 53. In
furtherance of the scheme, and despite still cohabitating with Plaintiff,
defendant Myers knowingly and intentionally utilized the United States
Marshall Service to effectuate service of the misleading documents on
Plaintiff, thereby using an instrumentality of interstate commerce to further
the illicit enterprise, which occurred on December 27, 2023. 54. In
furtherance of the scheme, and despite living next-door to Plaintiff,
defendant Myers knowingly and intentionally influenced an eviction
proceeding and utilized the United States Marshall Service to effectuate
service of the misleading documents on Plaintiff, which occurred on
December 28, 2023. H. False Statements – Divorce Petition and Affidavit of
Indigency (Dec. 18, 2023) 55. When reviewing the documents prepared in
part by Branthoover and filed with the court by Myers, there existed several
false statements and were intended to deceive the court and prejudice
Plaintiff in furtherance of the scheme to dispose him of his property
interests. Specifically, these false statements included, but were not limited
to: i. The assertion that the spouses had ceased living together on December
1, 2023, when in fact they were still residing together at the marital home
on that date and for several weeks thereafter. ii. The claim that Defendant
Myers owned both family vehicles as her separate property prior to the

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
marriage, which was demonstrably false as these vehicles were acquired
during the marriage and constituted community property, paid for by
Plaintiff. iii. The representation that Defendant Myers had an active order of
protection against Plaintiff with a judicial finding that family violence had
occurred during the marriage, which was fabricated and without any basis
in fact or law. iv. The assertion that the children or Defendant Myers would
be subjected to harassment or abuse if Plaintiff were provided with her
second phone number (817-940-0852) acquired in Oklahoma, which was a
baseless and manipulative claim designed to conceal her communications
related to the fraudulent scheme. 56. Concurrently with the fraudulent
divorce petition, Defendant Myers, again with the administrative oversight
and full knowledge of Defendant Branthoover, filed a fraudulent “Affidavit of
Indigency” with the court. This affidavit contained material
misrepresentations regarding Defendant Myers’ financial status, all of which
were known to be false at the time of filing and were intended to defraud the
court and avoid legitimate court costs. Specifically, these false statements
included, but were not limited to: i. The claim that Defendant Myers was
financially indigent and unable to pay court costs, despite her access to and
control over substantial marital assets. ii. The representation that Defendant
Myers was solely responsible for all family living expenses, including rent,
utilities, food, and other living expenses, when in fact, Plaintiff was the
primary breadwinner of the household at that time. iii. The assertion that
Defendant Myers was solely responsible for both car payments, which she
has no payment history to support such a claim. I. False Statements –
Application for Protective Order (Dec. 22, 2023) 57. Defendant was served
with an Application for a Protective Order on December 22, 2023, filed by
Myers, despite her claim to already have an existing order in her Original
Petition for Divorce. 58. Upon review, defendant Myers made additional
false statements within the sworn document, all intended to further deceive
the court and secure an unwarranted protective order against Plaintiff to
effectuate the enterprises’ goal of divesting him of his property interests.
These false statements included, but were not limited to: i. The claim that
family violence occurred on December 18, 2023, in the presence of the
children, which was entirely false and fabricated. ii. The assertion that
family violence occurred prior to December 18, 2023, which was also false
and without any factual basis. iii. The request that Plaintiff take a battering
intervention program. J. A Clear Objective 59. The common and overarching
objectives shared among Defendant Myers when reviewing these documents
(through the administration and direction of Defendant Branthoover) and
with the active participation of Myers’ grandmother, were multifaceted:
primarily, to unlawfully remove Plaintiff from his residence, which was
essential for his livelihood and the family’s financial well-being; secondarily,
to gain an unfair and illicit advantage in the ongoing divorce proceedings
between Plaintiff and Defendant Myers; and ultimately, to finalize the
divorce on terms unilaterally favorable to Defendant Myers, thereby making
the unlawful deprivation of Plaintiff’s rights and property permanent and to
escape accountability for the conduct alleged herein. K. Primary Objective
Success 60. On January 16, 2024, the parties appeared before the 322nd
District Court of Tarrant County, and the initial objective of the Defendants’
scheme succeeded when Plaintiff was ordered to vacate the family home
without any findings or without a hearing taking place. 61. The significance
of the misinformation presented to the court could have been the only

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
reason for this decision, and it afforded Myers the advantage that she and
Branthoover had anticipated. K. Pattern of Racketeering Activity and
Continuity 62. Between January 16, 2024, and the present day, Defendants
Myers and Branthoover have continued to further their racketeering activity
through a series of ongoing illicit acts, demonstrating a clear pattern of
continuity and relatedness. These acts include, but are not limited to: i.
Myers and Branthoover continuing to engage in illicit communications
regarding case details between one another across state lines, specifically
between Texas and Oklahoma, in direct furtherance of their fraudulent
scheme to see the divorce through to its’ finalization. ii. Branthoover
delivering ongoing threats and intimidation to Plaintiff regarding his
legitimate attempts to seek legal relief from the orders that were a product
of the Defendants’ actions, which occurred in December of 2023, June of
2024, December of 2024, and May of 2025. iii. Making direct statements
such as “I’ve been enjoying watching every filing get denied” by
Branthoover, showing the malicious intent behind his involvement. 63. On
June 23, 2024, Defendant Branthoover, continuing his pattern of harassment
and intimidation, sent a text message to Plaintiff stating, “Lol. And here
comes another denial,” in direct reference to a pleading filed in the Texas
State courts by Plaintiff seeking to enjoin Branthoover as a party to the
divorce proceedings. This communication demonstrates Branthoover’s
awareness of and continued involvement in the legal proceedings and his
malicious intent to mock Plaintiff’s efforts to seek justice. 64. On December
12, 2024, Defendant Branthoover sent a text message to Plaintiff explicitly
threatening future action by stating, “When things all over you get to deal
with me. Just a heads up.” This communication constitutes a direct threat of
future harm and further evidence of the Defendants’ future threat of
criminal activity. 65. On May 24, 2025, Defendant Branthoover sent a text
message to Plaintiff containing a direct and severe threat, stating, “Where’s
my lawsuit? Heard your vm about me. File it. Let’s do this :)” This malicious
communication is a clear act of intimidation and further evidence of the
Defendants’ collaboration throughout the proceedings with Defendant
Myers. VI. 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) - The RICO Statute 66. Plaintiff realleges and
incorporates by reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through
59 above, as if fully set forth herein. 67. The Racketeer Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) was enacted to combat organized crime
by providing enhanced criminal penalties and civil remedies. Section
1962(c) of the statute provides the legal framework for establishing liability
under RICO: "It shall be unlawful for any person employed by or associated
with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or
foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the
conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering
activity or collection of unlawful debt." 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) (2025). In
essence, the elements required for a RICO claim are: "(1) conduct (2) of an
enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity." Schreier v.
Drealan Kvilhaug Hoefker & Co. P.A., 611 F.Supp.3d 746 (D. Minn. 2020).
Plaintiff now turns to establish these required elements in the instant
matter. VII. The Conduct Element 68. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by
reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 61 above, as if
fully set forth herein. 69. Based on the facts presented, both Defendants
Branthoover and Myers satisfy this "conduct" element. Branthoover actively
communicated with Myers across state lines, coordinated her actions,

=== PAGE 9 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
facilitated a monetary transfer in furtherance of the broader scheme, and
provided administrative oversight for fraudulent legal documents,
demonstrating direction and control over the enterprise's affairs. Myers
executed the fraudulent acts by filing false affidavits, transferring marital
funds, and participating in the eviction scheme, showing her role in the
operation of the enterprise. The case law consistently supports that such
involvement in directing and executing an enterprise's fraudulent activities
satisfies the "conduct" element under RICO. A. Defendant Branthoover's
Role and the "Conduct" Element 70. Based on the facts presented,
Defendant Branthoover "actively communicated with Defendant Myers,
coordinated her actions, and provided administrative oversight for the
preparation and filing of fraudulent legal documents." These actions
demonstrate direction and control over the enterprise's affairs, which
satisfies the "conduct" element under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) as interpreted by
the Supreme Court in Reves. 71. First, Branthoover's active communication
with Myers and coordination of her actions show that Branthoover "gave
directions," one of the factors identified in Tatung Co. v. Shu Tze Hsu, 217
F.Supp.3d 1138 (C.D. Cal. 2016) for determining whether a defendant had
some part in directing the affairs of the enterprise. By coordinating Myers'
actions, Branthoover played a role in the "chain of command" through which
the affairs of the enterprise were conducted, another factor identified in
Tatung. 72. Second, Branthoover's provision of "administrative oversight for
the preparation and filing of fraudulent legal documents" demonstrates
management and direction of the enterprise's affairs. This oversight role
aligns with the "operation or management" test established in Reves v. Ernst
& Young, 507 U.S. 170 (1993), which requires "some degree of direction and
control over the enterprise's affairs." 73. The fact that Branthoover provided
oversight for fraudulent activities further strengthens the case that his
conduct satisfies the RICO "conduct" element. As noted in secondary
authorities "Reflections on Reves v. Ernst & Young: its meaning and impact
on substantive, accessory, aiding abetting and conspiracy liability under
RICO" (1996): "The prosecution is, however, required to prove that the
defendant's actions were related to the enterprise and that those acts were
known to and were intended to further the affairs of the enterprise and did
in fact further the affairs of the enterprise." 74. Branthoover's oversight of
fraudulent legal documents demonstrates that his actions were intended to
further the enterprise's fraudulent scheme. Even if Branthoover was not the
top-level manager of the enterprise, RICO liability "is not limited to those
with primary responsibility for the enterprise's affairs." Crabhouse of
Douglaston Inc. v. Newsday Inc., 801 F.Supp.2d 64 (E.D.N.Y. 2011). His role
in directing and overseeing the enterprise's fraudulent activities is sufficient
to establish liability under § 1962(c). B. Defendant Myers' Role and the
"Conduct" Element 75. Defendant Myers "engaged in fraudulent activities,
including filing false affidavits, transferring marital funds, and participating
in the eviction scheme." Although her role appears to be more focused on
execution rather than direction, the case law supports the conclusion that
her conduct also satisfies the "conduct" element under RICO. 76. First,
Myers' execution of fraudulent acts, including filing false affidavits and
transferring marital funds, demonstrates her participation in the
enterprise's affairs. While the Supreme Court in Reves established that mere
participation is not enough, Myers' actions go beyond mere participation. By
filing false affidavits, several misleading documents, and transferring

=== PAGE 10 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
marital funds, she was actively carrying out essential components of the
fraudulent scheme, making her "indispensable to the achievement of the
enterprise's goal," one of the factors identified in Tatung Co. v. Shu Tze Hsu,
217 F.Supp.3d 1138 (C.D. Cal. 2016). 77. Second, although Myers may have
been following Branthoover's directions, RICO liability can still attach if she
"exercised broad discretion in carrying out the instructions of her principal."
Crabhouse of Douglaston Inc. v. Newsday Inc., 801 F.Supp.2d 64 (E.D.N.Y.
2011). The filing of false affidavits and participation in the eviction scheme
involved discretionary decision-making on Myers' part, rather than merely
following specific, detailed instructions without any independent judgment.
Furthermore, Myers didn’t travel to Oklahoma in furtherance of the scheme
until after her first initial attempt at seeking an ex-parte order of protection
failed, showing a willingness to override the initial denial by making more
robust false statements in subsequent filings. Myers also submitted multiple
documents to the Texas Courts with actual knowledge of their
untruthfulness and used the transferred funds to acquire a second phone in
furtherance of the scheme. 78. Third, Myers' role in actually executing
fraudulent acts places her within the "chain of command" through which the
affairs of the enterprise were conducted, another factor identified in Tatung.
By carrying out the fraudulent activities that were central to the enterprise's
operations, she was participating in the conduct of the enterprise's affairs.
C. Collective Analysis of Both Defendants’ Roles 79. Collectively,
Branthoover and Myers operated at different levels of the enterprise, with
Branthoover providing direction and oversight and Myers executing the
fraudulent acts. This hierarchical structure is precisely the type of operation
contemplated by RICO, which aims to combat organized criminal activity. 80.
Under the “operation or management” test established in Reves, both
defendants had “some part in directing the enterprise’s affairs,” albeit to
different degrees. Branthoover’s role was more focused on coordination and
oversight, while Myers’ role was more focused on execution. However, both
roles involved discretionary actions that furthered the enterprise’s
fraudulent objectives. 81. The fact that Branthoover has a criminal history
surrounding protective orders further supports that he “directed Myers’
actions and oversaw the fraudulent filings, while Myers executed the
fraudulent acts” and demonstrates that they were operating as part of a
coordinated enterprise. This coordination and division of responsibilities
supports the conclusion that both defendants participated in the operation
or management of the enterprise, satisfying the “conduct” element under §
1962(c). VIII. The Enterprise Element 82. Plaintiff realleges and
incorporates by reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through
81 above, as if fully set forth herein. 83. Myers and Branthoover's
coordinated actions from December 2023 to May 2025 establish an
association-in-fact enterprise under RICO. This analysis applies the three
essential structural features established in Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S.
938 (2009): purpose, relationships, and longevity. A. Common Purpose 84.
Myers and Branthoover acted "with a shared purpose to defraud Plaintiff
and deprive him of his property and rights, provide Myers with an advantage
in divorce litigation, and finalize the scheme." This common fraudulent
purpose satisfies the first element of an association-in-fact enterprise. As
explained in Comm. to Protect Our Agric. Water v. Occidental Oil & Gas
Corp., 235 F.Supp.3d 1132 (E.D. Cal. 2017), to show a common purpose,
"plaintiffs must allege that the group engaged in enterprise conduct distinct

=== PAGE 11 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
from their own affairs." The coordinated fraudulent scheme directed at the
Plaintiff represents such a common purpose. B. Relationships Among
Associates 85. The facts indicate that Myers and Branthoover "acted
together" and engaged in "coordinated actions" including "fraudulent filings,
financial transactions, and communications to further their scheme." This
coordination demonstrates the relationships between the associates
necessary to establish an enterprise. As stated in United Ironworkers, Inc. v.
Travelers Prop. Cas. Co. of Am., Case No. 3:18-CV-553-NJR-DGW (S.D. Ill.
Jan 02, 2019), an enterprise must have "some structure, evinced by a
common purpose, some longevity, and relationships among those associated
with it." 86. Their coordinated roles in executing various aspects of the
fraudulent scheme fulfill this relationship requirement. The relationship
requirement is further supported by the interstate travel that took place to
carry out the scheme, which began in Oklahoma, and was carried out in
Texas. C. Sufficient Longevity 87. The enterprise operated through "ongoing
actions from December 2023 to May 2025," a period of approximately 18
months. This timeframe demonstrates sufficient longevity to pursue the
enterprise's purpose of defrauding the Plaintiff. According to Chambers v.
King Buick GMC, LLC, 43 F. Supp. 3d 575 (D. Md. 2014), a RICO enterprise
is characterized by "continuity, unity, shared purpose and identifiable
structure." The continuous operation over this period satisfies the longevity
requirement. While the initial predicate acts were carried out in the
beginning, the ongoing communications and direct threats to Plaintiff for
challenging their actions highlight an ongoing relationship contributable to
the enterprises’ purpose. D. Broad Interpretation of RICO Enterprise 88.
Courts have consistently interpreted the RICO enterprise element broadly, in
keeping with the statute's remedial purpose. As noted in McGillvary v.
Scutari, 23-cv-22605-JMY (D. N.J. Dec 23, 2024), "the very concept of an
association in fact is expansive," consistent with RICO's directive that "its
terms are to be liberally construed to effectuate its remedial purposes."
Similarly, Dugan v. State Farm Mut. Ins. Co., Case No. CIV-17-1221-R (W.D.
Okla. Apr 03, 2018) emphasized "the broad scope of a RICO enterprise" as
interpreted by the Supreme Court in Boyle. 89. This broad interpretation
supports finding an association-in-fact enterprise between Myers and
Branthoover based on their coordinated fraudulent activities. As stated in
secondary sources, RICO: A Primer (2022), courts have interpreted
"enterprise" broadly, and the statutory list is "not exhaustive but merely
illustrative." E. Enterprise Distinct from Pattern of Racketeering Activity 90.
One potential issue is whether the enterprise is sufficiently distinct from the
pattern of racketeering activity. As noted in Schreier v. Drealan Kvilhaug
Hoefker & Co. P.A., 611 F.Supp.3d 746 (D. Minn. 2020), "the existence of an
enterprise is an element distinct from the pattern of racketeering activity
and proof of one does not necessarily establish the other." Similarly,
Chambers v. King Buick GMC, LLC, 43 F. Supp. 3d 575 (D. Md. 2014) states
that an enterprise must be "an entity 'separate and apart from the pattern of
activity in which it engages.'" 91. However, this distinction does not require
a formal structure beyond the pattern of racketeering activity. As clarified in
Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938 (2009) and reiterated in the secondary
authority RACKETEER INFLUENCED AND CORRUPT ORGANIZATIONS
(2021), an association-in-fact enterprise "does not need 'an[y] ascertainable
structure beyond... a purpose, relationships among those associated with the
enterprise, and longevity sufficient to permit these associates to pursue the

=== PAGE 12 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
enterprise's purpose.'" 92. The facts indicate that Myers and Branthoover
had "coordinated roles," suggesting an organization beyond merely
committing predicate acts together. This coordination, combined with their
shared purpose and continuity over time, establishes an enterprise distinct
from the pattern of racketeering activity that they committed. 93. In
conclusion, the facts establish an association-in-fact enterprise between
Myers and Branthoover under RICO, as they worked together with a
common purpose (defrauding Plaintiff), had a structure (coordinated roles),
and demonstrated continuity (ongoing actions from December 2023 to May
2025), satisfying all the elements required by the Supreme Court in Boyle
and subsequent case law. IX. The Pattern Element 94. Plaintiff realleges and
incorporates by reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through
87 above, as if fully set forth herein. 95. The defendants' multiple predicate
acts of mail fraud, wire fraud, and obstruction of justice occurring over
approximately 18 months (December 2023 to May 2025) satisfy RICO's
pattern requirement by demonstrating both relationship among the acts and
continuity of criminal activity. Both closed-ended continuity (through
multiple related acts over a substantial time period) and open-ended
continuity (through a demonstrated threat of continued criminal activity) are
established under the standards set forth in H.J. Inc v. Northwestern Bell
Telephone Company, 492 U.S. 229, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989).
A. The Relevant Predicate Acts 96. RICO defines "racketeering activity" in
18 U.S.C. § 1961(1), which includes specific federal offenses. According to
the current version of the statute, "racketeering activity" includes "any act
which is indictable under any of the following provisions of title 18, United
States Code: ... section 1341 (relating to mail fraud), section 1343 (relating
to wire fraud), ... section 1503 (relating to obstruction of justice)." 18 U.S.C.
§ 1961 (2025). This directly establishes that the defendants' alleged acts of
mail fraud, wire fraud, and obstruction of justice qualify as predicate acts
under RICO. 97. The alleged predicate acts—mail fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1341),
wire fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343), and obstruction of justice (18 U.S.C. § 1503)—
all qualify as "racketeering activity" under 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1). The
defendants' engagement in these multiple related predicate acts over an 18-
month period satisfies the "continuity plus relationship" test established in
H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co., demonstrating both closed-
ended and open-ended continuity. 98. Specifically, the transfer of $1,576
from Myers to Branthoover on December 15, 2023, constitutes wire fraud
and was effectuated to further the goal of the enterprise. 99. The intent to
prepare the Original Petition for Divorce, Affidavit of Indigency, Application
for Protective Order, and the influence over an eviction proceeding which
was later dismissed for want of prosecution constitutes obstruction of justice
by deceiving the State courts into issuing an adverse ruling against Plaintiff
which achieved part of the enterprises common goal. 100. The use of the US
Marshall to effectuate the service of these fraudulent documents constitutes
mail fraud. 101. The repeated threats as Plaintiff sought relief from the
adverse ruling against him spanning several months and on several
occasions by Branthoover constitutes obstruction of justice by attempting to
intimidate Plaintiff. 102. However, the acts of racketeering activity are not
enough to establish a “pattern”. Plaintiff must also plead relatedness and
continuity. B. Relatedness Requirement 103. The relatedness prong
examines whether the predicate acts share common characteristics linking
them together. As explained in Wisdom v. First Midwest Bank, of Poplar

=== PAGE 13 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Bluff, 167 F.3d 402 (8th Cir. 1999): "The relationship prong of the pattern
element is satisfied if the predicate acts 'have the same or similar purposes,
results, participants, victims, or methods of commission, or otherwise are
interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not isolated events.'"
This definition of relatedness was borrowed from Title X of the Organized
Crime Control Act, as noted in H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co.:
"RICO's notion of relationship is no more constrained than that used in Title
X of OCCA, under which 'criminal conduct forms a pattern if it embraces
criminal acts that have the same or similar purposes, results, participants,
victims, or methods of commission, or otherwise are interrelated by
distinguishing characteristics and are not isolated events.'" C. Continuity
Requirement 104. The continuity element of the pattern requirement has
been extensively analyzed in case law. According to Id: "Continuity is
centrally a temporal concept, and may be either closed- or open-ended." 99.
The Court described two forms of continuity: i. Closed-ended continuity. As
explained in Spool v. World Child Intern. Adoption Agency, 520 F3d 178 (2nd
Cir. 2008): "Closed-ended continuity is defined as 'a series of related
predicates extending over a substantial period of time.'" This form of
continuity looks retrospectively at completed conduct. ii. Open-ended
continuity: As explained in U.S. v. Triumph Capital Group, Inc., 260 F.Supp.
2d 444 (D. Conn. 2002): "Open-ended continuity exists where there is past
conduct that, by its nature, projects into the future with a threat of
repetition." This form of continuity looks prospectively at the threat of
continued criminal activity. 105. Courts have emphasized that the continuity
requirement is determined on a case-by-case basis. As stated in U.S. v.
Pelullo, 964 F.2d 193 (3rd Cir. 1992): "The continuity element must be
determined on a case-by-case basis." D. Relatedness Analysis 106. The
relatedness requirement examines whether the predicate acts are connected
by common characteristics rather than being isolated events. According to
Wisdom v. First Midwest Bank, of Poplar Bluff, 167 F.3d 402 (8th Cir. 1999),
relatedness is satisfied if the acts "have the same or similar purposes,
results, participants, victims, or methods of commission, or otherwise are
interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not isolated events."
107. In this case, the defendants' alleged acts of mail fraud, wire fraud, and
obstruction of justice demonstrate relatedness because: i. They share similar
purposes: The fraudulent filings, interstate communications, and threats
were allegedly aimed at defrauding the plaintiff. ii. They involve the same
participants: The same defendants were involved in all the predicate acts. iii.
They target the same victim: The plaintiff was the target of all the predicate
acts. iv. They employ similar methods: The use of fraudulent filings and
interstate communications shows a consistent methodology. E. Continuity
Analysis 108. The continuity requirement can be satisfied by demonstrating
either closed-ended continuity or open-ended continuity. 109. The 18-month
period here (December 2023 to May 2025) is substantial and involves
multiple predicate acts, including mail fraud, wire fraud, and obstruction of
justice. This duration and variety of predicate acts supports a finding of
closed-ended continuity under the standard established in H.J. Inc. v.
Northwestern Bell Telephone Co. 110. In this case, Branthoover’s threats to
Plaintiff, combined with the ongoing nature of their fraudulent filings and
interstate communications up to May 2025 show that their conduct poses a
threat of continued criminal activity. The recency of their alleged acts shows
that the end goal of the enterprise has not been satisfied, which is to finalize

=== PAGE 14 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
the proceedings that the Defendants initialized through a pattern of
racketeering activity. 111. In conclusion, the pattern requirement is
supported by the statutory language of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961, 1962, 1341, and
1343, as well as case law. The defendants' alleged conduct goes beyond
isolated or sporadic criminal acts and demonstrates the sustained, related
pattern of criminal activity that RICO was designed to address. X. Damages
112. As a direct result of the racketeering activity alleged herein, Plaintiff
has sustained substantial injury to his business operations, suffered
significant credit decrease, lost business opportunities, had his personal
belongings destroyed, and has had one vehicle repossessed. Does this
constitute a prima facie RICO claim? If so, list the counts.
Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
Yes, the complaint constitutes a prima facie RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. §
1962(c), as it adequately pleads all four required elements: (1) conduct, (2)
of an enterprise, (3) through a pattern, (4) of racketeering activity.
Summary
The complaint filed by Charles Dustin Myers presents a comprehensive civil
RICO claim against defendants Daniel Branthoover and Morgan Myers. The
plaintiff has successfully established the essential elements required for a
prima facie RICO violation under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c): conduct of an
enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. Through detailed
factual allegations spanning an 18-month period, the complaint
demonstrates how the defendants engaged in coordinated fraudulent
activities including wire fraud, mail fraud, and obstruction of justice to
deprive the plaintiff of property rights and gain advantages in divorce
proceedings.
The strength of this RICO claim lies in the plaintiff's methodical presentation
of evidence showing the defendants' respective roles in the enterprise, their
shared purpose, the relationship between predicate acts, and the continuity
of their criminal activity. The complaint articulates a clear narrative of how
Branthoover provided direction and oversight while Myers executed
fraudulent acts, establishing both defendants' participation in the operation
and management of the enterprise. The pattern of racketeering activity is
well-documented through multiple related predicate acts that occurred over
a substantial time period with ongoing threats continuing into May 2025,
satisfying both the relatedness and continuity requirements under RICO
jurisprudence.

Background and Relevant Law
RICO Statutory Framework
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) provides a
civil remedy for persons injured by violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1962. Section
1962(c) makes it "unlawful for any person employed by or associated with
any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or
foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the
conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering
activity or collection of unlawful debt." 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) (2025).
Under RICO's civil remedies provision, "Any person injured in his business
or property by reason of a violation of section 1962 of this chapter may sue
therefor in any appropriate United States district court and shall recover
threefold the damages he sustains and the cost of the suit, including a
reasonable attorney's fee..." 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c) (2025).
Federal district courts have original jurisdiction over RICO claims pursuant
to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (2025), which provides that "The district courts shall
have original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the Constitution,
laws, or treaties of the United States."
Elements of a Civil RICO Claim
Courts have consistently identified four essential elements required to
establish a civil RICO claim under § 1962(c): "(1) conduct (2) of an
enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity." Schreier v.
Drealan Kvilhaug Hoefker & Co. P.A., 611 F.Supp.3d 746 (D. Minn. 2020).
This framework has been widely adopted across federal jurisdictions.
As explained by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan,
"To state a RICO claim, a plaintiff must plead: '(1) conduct (2) of an
enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity.'" Lockhart v.
Deluca (E.D. Mich. 2023). Similarly, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern
District of Virginia has held that "the elements of a civil Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) claim are (1) a person, (2)
an enterprise, (3) a pattern of (4) racketeering activity (5) which causes
injury to the plaintiff." Studco Bldg. Sys. U.S., LLC v. 1st Advantage Fed.
Credit Union, 509 F.Supp.3d 560 (E.D. Va. 2020).
Some courts have articulated the requirements slightly differently but
preserve the same essential elements. For instance, the U.S. District Court
for the Northern District of Ohio stated that "The elements of a RICO claim
are: 1) two or more predicate offenses; 2) the existence of an enterprise; 3) a
nexus between the pattern of racketeering activity and the enterprise; and
4) resulting injury to business or property." Miller v. Norfolk Southern Ry.
Co., 183 F.Supp.2d 996 (N.D. Ohio 2002).

Analysis
1. The "Conduct" Element
The "conduct" element requires that a defendant "participate in the
operation or management of the enterprise itself." Davis v. Hudgins, 896
F.Supp. 561 (E.D. Va. 1995) (citing Reves v. Ernst & Young, 113 S.Ct. 1163
(1993)). As the Eastern District of Virginia explained, "RICO liability is not
limited to those with a formal position in the enterprise, but some part in
directing the enterprise's affairs is required." Id.
The complaint adequately alleges that both defendants participated in the
operation or management of the enterprise:
Defendant Branthoover's Role
The complaint details Branthoover's direction and oversight of the
enterprise through:
Coordinating Myers' travel to Oklahoma for the purpose of preparing
fraudulent documents
Providing "administrative oversight for the preparation and filing of
fraudulent legal documents"
Explicitly stating he would "help with the paperwork and make things
go as smoothly as possible"
Asserting control over communications by instructing plaintiff to "only
communicate with me or your attorney"
Continuing to monitor and comment on the divorce proceedings
through May 2025
These allegations demonstrate that Branthoover had "some part in directing
the enterprise's affairs" as required by Davis v. Hudgins, 896 F.Supp. 561
(E.D. Va. 1995). His actions show more than mere participation; they reflect
management and direction of the enterprise's activities.
Moreover, as noted in Crabhouse of Douglaston Inc. v. Newsday Inc., 801
F.Supp.2d 64 (E.D. N.Y. 2011), RICO liability "is not limited to those with
primary responsibility for the enterprise's affairs." Branthoover's role in
directing and overseeing the fraudulent activities is sufficient to establish
the conduct element.
Defendant Myers' Role
While Myers' role appears more focused on execution rather than direction,
the complaint adequately alleges her participation in the conduct of the
enterprise through:
Filing false affidavits and other fraudulent court documents
Transferring marital funds to Branthoover's PayPal account
Acquiring a secondary phone number to facilitate clandestine
communications
•

• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 

=== PAGE 17 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Participating in and influencing the fraudulent eviction attempt
Continuing communications with Branthoover regarding the divorce
proceedings
These actions demonstrate that Myers was not merely following instructions
but exercised discretion in executing essential components of the fraudulent
scheme. As explained in secondary materials, members of a RICO enterprise
need not all serve in the same capacity; some may direct activities while
others execute them, but both roles can satisfy the conduct element if they
involve discretionary actions furthering the enterprise's objectives. "Civil
Rico: A Tool of Advocacy" (2024).
2. The "Enterprise" Element
RICO defines an "enterprise" to include "any individual, partnership,
corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of
individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity." 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4)
(2025).
For an association-in-fact enterprise, courts require: "(1) a common purpose
that animates the individuals associated with it; (2) an ongoing organization
with members who function as a continuing unit; and (3) an ascertainable
structure distinct from the conduct of a pattern of racketeering." Schreier v.
Drealan Kvilhaug Hoefker & Co. P.A., 611 F.Supp.3d 746 (D. Minn. 2020).
The complaint sufficiently alleges an association-in-fact enterprise between
Branthoover and Myers by establishing:
Common Purpose
The defendants allegedly shared a common purpose to defraud the plaintiff
and deprive him of property rights, provide Myers with an advantage in
divorce proceedings, and finalize the divorce on terms favorable to Myers.
This satisfies the common purpose requirement as outlined in "RICO: A
Primer" (2022), which states that members of an enterprise must share "the
same or similar purposes."
Relationships Among Associates
The complaint details the relationship between Branthoover and Myers,
including:
Their familial relationship (stepfather and stepdaughter)
Extensive communications (92 text messages in a single day)
Coordinated roles (Branthoover directing and Myers executing)
Interstate travel to plan and prepare fraudulent documents
Ongoing communications about judicial proceedings
These allegations establish the relationships among associates necessary for
an enterprise, showing that they "function as a continuing unit" as required
by Schreier v. Drealan Kvilhaug Hoefker & Co. P.A., 611 F.Supp.3d 746 (D.
Minn. 2020).

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Sufficient Longevity
The enterprise allegedly operated from December 2023 through May 2025,
approximately 18 months. This timeframe demonstrates sufficient longevity
to pursue the enterprise's fraudulent purpose. As noted in Chambers v. King
Buick GMC, LLC, 43 F. Supp. 3d 575 (D. Md. 2014), a RICO enterprise is
characterized by "continuity, unity, shared purpose and identifiable
structure."
Structure Distinct from Pattern
While the structure of an association-in-fact enterprise need not be formal, it
must be "separate and apart from the pattern of activity in which it
engages." Chambers v. King Buick GMC, LLC, 43 F. Supp. 3d 575 (D. Md.
2014). However, as noted in "RICO: A Primer" (2022), an association-in-fact
enterprise "does not need 'an[y] ascertainable structure beyond... a purpose,
relationships among those associated with the enterprise, and longevity
sufficient to permit these associates to pursue the enterprise's purpose.'"
The complaint alleges an enterprise structure through the defendants'
coordinated roles, hierarchical relationship (Branthoover directing, Myers
executing), and systematic approach to achieving their fraudulent
objectives. This goes beyond merely alleging that they committed predicate
acts together.
3. The "Pattern" Element
A pattern of racketeering activity "requires at least two acts of racketeering
activity" within a ten-year period. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5) (2025). However,
courts have interpreted this requirement to demand more than just two
predicate acts. As explained in "Racketeer influenced and corrupt
organizations" (2007), establishing a pattern requires proving both
"continuity" and "relationship" among the predicate acts.
Predicate Acts
The complaint alleges multiple predicate acts that qualify as "racketeering
activity" under 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1) (2025), including:
Wire fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343):
Transfer of $1,576 from a joint account to Branthoover's PayPal
account
Interstate communications to coordinate the fraudulent scheme
Mail fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1341):
Use of the U.S. Marshal Service to serve fraudulent documents
1.

=== PAGE 19 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Obstruction of justice (18 U.S.C. § 1503):
Filing fraudulent documents in Texas courts to obtain favorable
rulings
Threats to intimidate plaintiff from seeking legal remedies
These acts qualify as "racketeering activity" under 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1)
(2025), which specifically includes mail fraud, wire fraud, and obstruction of
justice.
Relatedness Requirement
The relatedness requirement examines whether the predicate acts share
common characteristics rather than being isolated events. According to 
"Racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations" (2007), relatedness is
satisfied if the acts "have the same or similar purposes, results, participants,
victims, or methods of commission, or otherwise are interrelated by
distinguishing characteristics and are not isolated events."
The complaint establishes relatedness by showing that the predicate acts:
Share a common purpose (defrauding plaintiff and gaining advantages
in divorce proceedings)
Involve the same participants (Branthoover and Myers)
Target the same victim (the plaintiff)
Employ similar methods (fraudulent filings and interstate
communications)
Continuity Requirement
Continuity can be established through either "closed-ended continuity" (a
series of related predicates over a substantial period) or "open-ended
continuity" (conduct posing a threat of continued criminal activity). 
"Racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations" (2007).
The complaint demonstrates both forms of continuity:
Closed-ended continuity: The alleged racketeering activities span from
December 2023 to May 2025, approximately 18 months. This
constitutes a "substantial period of time" under prevailing case law.
Open-ended continuity: The complaint alleges ongoing threats and
communications as recently as May 2025, suggesting that the
defendants' criminal activities pose a threat of continuing into the
future until they achieve their ultimate goal of finalizing the divorce on
terms favorable to Myers.
As noted in "RICO: A Primer" (2022), "The continuity requirement is likewise
satisfied where the predicates are a regular way of conducting the
defendant's ongoing legitimate business... or of conducting or participating
in an ongoing and legitimate RICO 'enterprise.'"

4. Injury to Business or Property
The complaint adequately alleges injury to the plaintiff's business and
property interests, including:
Loss of residence which was essential to his business operations
Significant credit decrease
Lost business opportunities
Destruction of personal belongings
Vehicle repossession
These allegations satisfy the injury requirement under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c)
(2025), which provides a civil remedy for any person "injured in his business
or property by reason of a violation of section 1962."
Potential Challenges and Limitations
While the complaint presents a prima facie RICO claim, several potential
challenges could arise:
Proximate Causation
Courts require a direct relationship between the alleged RICO violation and
the plaintiff's injury. The complaint must establish that the defendants'
racketeering activity was not just the "but for" cause of the injury but also
the proximate cause. Chambers v. King Buick GMC, LLC, 43 F. Supp. 3d 575
(D. Md. 2014) ("Plaintiff must additionally plead proximate cause, that is she
was injured in her business or property 'by reason of' the RICO violation").
Here, the complaint adequately alleges proximate causation by detailing
how the defendants' fraudulent filings directly led to court orders forcing
the plaintiff from his residence, thus directly impacting his business
operations and property interests.
Specificity of Fraud Allegations
RICO claims based on mail or wire fraud must comply with Federal Rule of
Civil Procedure 9(b)'s requirement that fraud allegations be pleaded with
particularity. "Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy" (2024). The complaint meets
this standard by providing specific details about the fraudulent activities,
including:
Dates of communications and transactions
Content of fraudulent statements
Specific amounts transferred
Identification of fraudulent documents filed
Domestic Relations Exception
Some courts have been reluctant to allow RICO claims that essentially
involve domestic relations matters, traditionally the province of state courts.

However, the complaint goes beyond a mere domestic dispute, alleging a
coordinated scheme involving interstate travel, fraudulent documents, and
financial transactions that affected plaintiff's business interests.
Conclusion
Based on the comprehensive legal analysis above, the complaint filed by
Charles Dustin Myers constitutes a prima facie RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. §
1962(c). The complaint successfully establishes all four essential elements of
a civil RICO claim:
Conduct: Both defendants participated in the operation or
management of the enterprise, with Branthoover providing direction
and oversight and Myers executing essential components of the
fraudulent scheme.
Enterprise: The complaint adequately alleges an association-in-fact
enterprise between Branthoover and Myers, demonstrating common
purpose, relationships among associates, and sufficient longevity.
Pattern: The complaint establishes a pattern of racketeering activity by
alleging multiple predicate acts (wire fraud, mail fraud, and obstruction
of justice) that are related and demonstrate both closed-ended and
open-ended continuity.
Racketeering Activity: The alleged predicate acts qualify as
"racketeering activity" under 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1).
Additionally, the complaint alleges specific injury to the plaintiff's business
and property interests, as required for civil RICO claims under 18 U.S.C. §
1964(c).
The complaint therefore states a viable civil RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. §
1962(c), entitling the plaintiff to seek treble damages and attorney's fees.
Based on the allegations in the complaint, the following count could be
properly pleaded:
Count I: Violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) - Conducting the Affairs of
an Enterprise Through a Pattern of Racketeering Activity
The strength of this RICO claim lies in the detailed factual allegations that
establish the defendants' respective roles in the enterprise, their shared
purpose, the relationship between predicate acts, and the continuity of their
criminal activity over a substantial period. While challenges may arise
regarding proximate causation and the domestic relations context, the
complaint's comprehensive allegations provide a strong foundation for the
RICO claim to proceed.

Extract
In Reves v. Ernst & Young, ___ U.S. ___, 113 S.Ct. 1163, 122 L.Ed.2d 525
(1993), the United States Supreme Court discussed the 'conduct' element of
section 1962(c) and determined that RICO requires a participant to have
some role in the operation or management of the enterprise. Id. at ___, 113
S.Ct. at 1170. The Court stated that 'RICO liability is not limited to those
with a formal position in the enterprise, but some part in directing the
enterprise's affairs is required.' Id.; see also United States v. Grubb, 11 F.3d
426, 439 n. 24 (4th Cir.1993). Plaintiff provides no clear indication of which
Defendants directed the activities of the alleged scheme. He has alleged that
each Defendant committed specific acts in furtherance of the scheme, but
none of the acts Plaintiff lists suggests that any Defendants held a
management role in the purported scheme. Therefore, the Court finds that
Plaintiff has failed to allege that Defendants engaged in the conduct
necessary to impose liability under RICO.
Summary
The passage highlights the importance of demonstrating that defendants
had a role in directing the enterprise's affairs to establish RICO liability. It
emphasizes that merely committing acts in furtherance of a scheme is
insufficient without showing management or operational control.

U.S. District Court — District of Minnesota
Extract
To state a RICO claim, a plaintiff must show '(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise
(3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity.' ... 'A RICO enterprise
‘includes any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal
entity, and any union or group of individuals associated in fact although not
a legal entity.' ... To show a RICO enterprise, a plaintiff must show: '(1) a
common purpose that animates the individuals associated with it; (2) an
ongoing organization with members who function as a continuing unit; and
(3) an ascertainable structure distinct from the conduct of a pattern of
racketeering.' ... An essential element of the civil RICO cause of action is
proof that defendants have engaged in a 'pattern of racketeering activity.' ...
'A pattern is shown through two or more related acts of racketeering activity
that amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity.'

Summary
To establish a prima facie RICO claim, a plaintiff must demonstrate conduct
of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. The enterprise
must have a common purpose, function as a continuing unit, and have a
structure distinct from the pattern of racketeering. A pattern requires at
least two related acts of racketeering that pose a threat of continued
criminal activity. The passage provides the necessary elements and
definitions to evaluate whether the allegations in the complaint meet the
criteria for a RICO claim.

Extract
To state a claim for violation of section 1962(c), Plaintiffs must allege facts
showing '(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of
racketeering activity.' Sedima v. Imrex Co., Inc., 473 U.S. 479, 496, 105 S.Ct.

predicate acts as mail fraud (§ 1341), wire fraud (§ 1343), and obstruction of
justice (§ 1503). See 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1) ; see also American Dental Ass'n v.

'requires at least two acts of racketeering activity.'
Summary
Racketeering activity includes predicate acts such as mail fraud, wire fraud,
and obstruction of justice, and that a pattern requires at least two acts of
racketeering activity.
D'Addario v. Geller, 264 F.Supp.2d 367 (E.D. Va. 2003)
U.S. District Court — Eastern District of Virginia
Extract
Title 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) provides that 'it shall be unlawful for any person
employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities
of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate,
directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a
pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt.' According to
18 U.S.C. § 1961, racketeering must involve the commission of two or more
predicate acts, including mail fraud and obstruction of justice. A plaintiff
must plead all elements of the alleged violation of section 1962 in order to
state a civil claim under section 1964(c). Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex, Co., 473
U.S. 479, 496, 105 S.Ct. 3275, 87 L.Ed.2d 346 (1985).
Summary
To establish a prima facie RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), a plaintiff
must allege: (1) conduct, (2) of an enterprise, (3) through a pattern, (4) of
racketeering activity. Additionally, the plaintiff must show that they were
injured in their business or property by reason of the RICO violations. The
passage confirms that the plaintiff must plead all elements of the alleged
violation, including the commission of two or more predicate acts such as
mail fraud and obstruction of justice.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
RICO is a broadly worded statute that “has as its purpose the elimination of
the infiltration of organized crime and racketeering into legitimate
organizations operating in interstate commerce.” ... “Any principled analysis
of a RICO claim [ ] must begin from an understanding of what enterprise is
alleged.” ... One violates RICO where “a defendant, through the commission
of two or more acts constituting a pattern of racketeering activity, directly or
indirectly participate[s] in an enterprise ....” ... The Court now turns to the
third and fourth elements of the plaintiffs' substantive RICO claims: “the
commission of two or more acts constituting a pattern of racketeering
activity.” The pattern of racketeering alleged by plaintiffs in their RICO
claim is mail fraud. To bring such a claim, plaintiffs must allege “(1) the
existence of a scheme to defraud, (2) defendant's knowing or intentional
participation in the scheme, and (3) the use of interstate mails or
transmission facilities in furtherance of the scheme.”
Summary
Elements necessary to establish a RICO claim, which include the existence
of an enterprise, the commission of two or more acts constituting a pattern
of racketeering activity, and the use of interstate mails or transmission
facilities in furtherance of the scheme. The passage also emphasizes the
need for a scheme to defraud and the defendant's knowing or intentional
participation in the scheme. This framework is applicable to the question of
whether the complaint constitutes a prima facie RICO claim.

U.S. District Court — Southern District of Texas
Extract
RICO makes it 'unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any
enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign
commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of
such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity or
collection of unlawful debt.' Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938, 943–45,

(internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, to establish liability under §
1962(c) one must allege and prove the existence of two distinct entities: (1)
a 'person'; and (2) an 'enterprise' that is not simply the same 'person'
referred to by a different name.

RICO is a 'unique cause of action that is concerned with eradicating
organized, long-term, habitual criminal activity.' Gamboa v. Velez, 457 F.3d
703, 705 (7th Cir. 2006). When Congress enacted RICO, it chose to
supplement criminal enforcement of its provision by providing that '[a]ny
person injured in his business or property' by a RICO violation may seek
treble damages and attorney's fees. 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c); Goren v. New Vision
Intern., Inc., 156 F.3d 721, 726 (7th Cir.1998). While there are significant
substantive differences among the various RICO provisions contained in §
1962, the existence of an 'enterprise' and a 'pattern of racketeering' are
elements that are fundamental to each subsection. 18 U.S.C. § 1962.
Accordingly, to state a claim for a RICO violation, a plaintiff must allege a
cognizable injury to its business or property resulting from the '(1) conduct
(2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity.'

of two or more acts (3) constituting a 'pattern' (4) of 'racketeering
activity' (5) directly or indirectly invests in, or maintains an interest in, or
participates in (6) an 'enterprise' (7) the activities of which affect interstate

Summary
Essential elements required to establish a RICO claim: conduct, enterprise,
pattern, and racketeering activity. It emphasizes that while RICO pleadings
should be liberally construed, plaintiffs must still provide allegations that
establish each of these elements. This framework is generally applicable to
any RICO case, providing a foundational understanding of what constitutes a
prima facie RICO claim.

Extract
Plaintiffs allege that defendants violated RICO, 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), by
engaging in a pattern of racketeering activity. Section 1962(c) provides: It
shall be unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any
enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign
commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of
such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity or
collection of unlawful debt. To establish a violation of § 1962(c), plaintiffs
must prove injury caused by a person who conducts the affairs of an
enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c).
The elements of a RICO claim are: 1) two or more predicate offenses; 2) the
existence of an enterprise; 3) a nexus between the pattern of racketeering
activity and the enterprise; and 4) resulting injury to business or property.

Arizona Premium Finance, Inc. v. Bielli, 77 F.Supp.2d 341 (E.D. N.Y. 1999)
U.S. District Court — Eastern District of New York
Extract
To state a claim for damages under RICO a plaintiff has two pleading
burdens. First, he must allege that the defendant has violated the
substantive RICO statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1962 (1976), commonly known as
'criminal RICO.' In so doing, he must allege the existence of seven
constituent elements: (1) that the defendant (2) through the commission of
two or more acts (3) constituting a 'pattern' (4) of 'racketeering activity' (5)
directly or indirectly invests in, or maintains an interest in, or participates in
(6) an 'enterprise' (7) the activities of which affect interstate or foreign
commerce.... Plaintiff must allege adequately defendant's violation of section
1962 before turning to the second burden — i.e., invoking RICO's civil
remedies of treble damages, attorneys fees and costs.... To establish such a
pattern of racketeering activity, 'a plaintiff must plead at least two predicate
acts, show that the acts are related and that they amount to, or pose a
threat of, continuing criminal activity.' H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell
Telephone Co., 492 U.S. 229, 239, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989).
Summary
Necessary elements to establish a RICO claim, which include demonstrating
that the defendant committed two or more acts of racketeering activity that
form a pattern, are related, and pose a threat of continuing criminal activity.
The passage also emphasizes the need for the plaintiff to allege that the
defendant participated in an enterprise affecting interstate or foreign
commerce. This framework is applicable to the question of whether the

Elements required to establish a RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c),
which are: (1) conduct, (2) of an enterprise, (3) through a pattern, (4) of
racketeering activity. It also clarifies that an enterprise can be any group of
individuals associated in fact, and a pattern of racketeering activity requires
at least two predicate acts within a ten-year period. This information is

Nunes v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., 609 F. Supp. 1055
(D. Md. 1985)
U.S. District Court — District of Maryland
Extract
In Counts IX, X, XIX, and XX of the Complaint, plaintiffs allege causes of
action under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act
(RICO), 18 U.S.C. § 1961 et seq. Defendants assert that plaintiffs have failed
to state a claim, particularly that plaintiffs have failed to plead the predicate
acts constituting racketeering activity and that plaintiffs have failed to
describe an enterprise separate and apart from Merrill Lynch. The civil
remedies available under RICO are provided by 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c), which
states that: 'Any person injured in his business or property by reason of a
violation of section 1962 of this chapter may sue therefor in any appropriate
United States district court and shall recover threefold the damages he
sustains and the cost of the suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee.' The
predicate offenses alleged by plaintiffs in this case include mail fraud, wire
fraud, and federal securities fraud. Plaintiffs' complaint alleges that between
October 1982 and June 1983, the defendants committed at least two of the
predicate acts stated above. Under § 1961(5), a pattern of racketeering
activity has been sufficiently established for purposes of a motion to dismiss
if the plaintiff has alleged that defendants are guilty of two acts of
racketeering activity.
Summary
To establish a prima facie RICO claim, a plaintiff must allege that the
defendants committed at least two predicate acts of racketeering activity,
which can include mail fraud, wire fraud, and other offenses. The passage
also highlights the necessity of demonstrating a pattern of racketeering
activity, which is satisfied by alleging two acts of racketeering. This aligns
with the requirements outlined in the RICO statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1961 et seq.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
To state a cause of action under RICO, Plaintiffs must establish (1) conduct
(2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity (5)
causing injury to the Plaintiffs' business or property by the conduct
constituting the violation. See Sedima v. Imrex Co., Inc., 473 U.S. 479, 496,
105 S.Ct. 3275, 87 L.Ed.2d 346 (1985). RICO, in pertinent part, defines
'racketeering activity,' as 'any act or threat ... which is indictable' under an
enumerated list of offenses codified in Title 18 of United States Code and
'which is chargeable under State law and punishable by imprisonment for
more than one year.' 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1). A pattern of racketeering activity
exists when a person commits two or more specified acts ('predicate acts')
that have sufficient continuity and relationship so as to pose a threat of
continued criminal activity.
Summary
Necessary elements for a RICO claim, which include conduct, enterprise,
pattern, racketeering activity, and injury. The passage also clarifies that a
pattern of racketeering activity requires at least two predicate acts that are
related and continuous.
Saine v. AIA, INC., 582 F.Supp. 1299 (D. Colo. 1984)
U.S. District Court — District of Colorado
Extract
The civil remedies section of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1961-1968 (RICO) provides for a private right
of action for treble damages: Any person injured in his business or property
by reason of a violation of section 1962 of this chapter may sue therefor in
any appropriate United States District Court and shall recover threefold the
damages he sustains and the cost of the suit, including a reasonable
attorney's fee... The statutory pattern reveals eight elements that are critical
to a RICO claim: Moss v. Morgan Stanley Inc., 719 F.2d 5, 17 (2d Cir.1983);
Taylor v. Bear Stearns & Co., 572 F.Supp. 667, 682 (N.D.Ga.1983)... RICO
does not by its terms prohibit only the acts of those associated with
'organized crime.' It was, however, the declared purpose of Congress to
'seek the eradication of organized crime in the United States.' See United
States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 589, 101 S.Ct. 2524, 2531, 69 L.Ed.2d 246
(1981).
Summary
Elements necessary for a RICO claim, emphasizing that RICO applies
broadly to any pattern of racketeering activity, not just organized crime. It
also highlights the need for specific allegations of fraud to be stated with

an enterprise, (3) a pattern of racketeering activity, and (4) conduct of the
enterprise's affairs through the pattern of racketeering activity. Additionally,
the passage notes that the injury and causation components are viewed as
standing requirements. The passage also clarifies that racketeering activity
includes mail and wire fraud, which are relevant to the case at hand.

Summary
The RICO statute defines "racketeering activity" to include acts such as mail
fraud, wire fraud, and obstruction of justice, which are relevant to the
allegations in the complaint. The complaint alleges acts that fall under these
categories, suggesting that the elements of a RICO claim may be present.

Summary
28 U.S.C. § 1331 grants federal district courts original jurisdiction over civil
actions that arise under federal laws, such as the RICO statute. This means
that if a RICO claim is properly pleaded, the federal court has the authority
to hear the case. The passage confirms that the court has jurisdiction over
the RICO claim presented in the complaint.

Summary
The U.S. Code provides a civil remedy for individuals injured in their
business or property due to a violation of section 1962, which includes RICO
violations. The passage confirms that a person can sue in federal court and
recover treble damages and attorney's fees if they can establish a violation
of section 1962. This is relevant to determining whether the plaintiff in the
complaint has a prima facie RICO claim, as it outlines the potential remedies
available if such a claim is established.
RICO - the rejection of an economic motive requirement.
Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology - Northwestern University,
School of Law - Randolph, Jennifer G. - 1995-03-22
Extract
The Court rejected a narrow reading of the phrase 'pattern of racketeering
activity,' holding that it does not require proof of 'multiple illegal schemes'
or that the predicate acts be 'indicative of an organized crime perpetrator.'
Instead, the Court settled on a broad meaning for 'pattern of racketeering'
that requires a 'plaintiff or prosecutor [merely to] prove [a] continuity of
racketeering activity, or its threat, simpliciter.'
Summary
The RICO statute is interpreted broadly, allowing for a pattern of
racketeering activity to be established without the need for multiple illegal
schemes or organized crime indicators. This broad interpretation supports

the idea that a series of related acts over a substantial period can constitute
a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO.

continuity of those acts to prove a 'pattern of racketeering activity' for RICO
purposes. (49) These requirements, referred to as the 'continuity plus
relationship' test, (50) must be proven independently, but the Court has
recognized that evidence establishing the two elements will often overlap.
(51) In H.J. Inc., the Court looked to a provision of the Organized Crime
Control Act of 1970 (52) for guidance in defining the relationship component
of the pattern requirement of RICO: '[c]riminal conduct forms a pattern if it
embraces criminal acts that have the same or similar purposes, results,
participants, victims, or methods of commission, or otherwise are
interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not isolated
events.' (53) The 'continuity' component is met by either closed-ended
continuity, defined as 'a series of related predicates extending over a
substantial period of time,' (54) or open-ended continuity, defined as conduct
that poses a threat of continued criminal activity.
Summary
To establish a RICO claim, the plaintiff must demonstrate a "pattern of
racketeering activity," which involves proving both "continuity" and
"relationship" among the predicate acts. The passage explains that
continuity can be either closed-ended (a series of related predicates over a
substantial period) or open-ended (conduct posing a threat of continued
criminal activity). The relationship component requires that the acts have
similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods, or are otherwise
interrelated.

Extract
A violation of § 1962(c), the section on which Sedima relies, requires (1)
conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity. The plaintiff must allege each of the elements to state a claim. They
are all equally essential components, and the complaint will fail if any one of
them is not adequately pleaded. In particular, RICO claims based on mail or

wire fraud must comport with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b)’s
requirement that allegations involving fraud be pleaded with particularity.

RICO CONSPIRACY The essence of a RICO conspiracy is the existence of an
agreement to violate RICO's substantive provisions. RICO conspiracy was
established by proof of: (a) of an agreement to join a racketeering scheme,
(b) of the defendant's knowing engagement in the scheme with the intent
that its overall goals be effectuated, and (c) that the scheme involved, or by
agreement between any members of the conspiracy was intended to involve,
two or more predicate acts of racketeering.
Summary
Elements necessary to establish a RICO conspiracy: an agreement to join a
racketeering scheme, knowing engagement with intent to effectuate the
scheme's goals, and involvement in or intent to involve two or more
predicate acts of racketeering. This is relevant to determining whether the
complaint in question constitutes a prima facie RICO claim, as it provides
the criteria for establishing a RICO conspiracy.
RICO: A Primer
Extract
A plaintiff is required to demonstrate that the defendant conducted the
affairs of an enterprise though a pattern of racketeering activity. The person
and the enterprise generally must be distinct; but, of course, a Rico person
can be a part of an enterprise. A RICO enterprise includes 'any individual,
partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or
group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.' Courts
have interpreted 'enterprise' broadly, and the definition captures both
legitimate and illegitimate enterprises. The statutory list is not exhaustive
but merely illustrative. A 'pattern' may exist where any combination of two
or more offenses occurred within a period of time. In Sedima, S.P.R.L. v.
Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479, the Supreme Court held that the RICO pattern
element requires more than merely proving two predicate acts of
racketeering. Rather, proof of 'continuity plus relationship' is necessary.

=== PAGE 37 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Nonetheless, the Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized that Congress
had a fairly flexible concept of a pattern in mind. The Supreme Court has
stated that: ... The racketeering acts need not be similar or directly related
to each other; rather, it is sufficient that the racketeering acts are related in
some way to the affairs of the charged enterprise, including, for example,
that: the racketeering acts furthered the goals of or benefitted the
enterprise, the enterprise or the defendant's role in the enterprise enabled
the defendant to commit, or facilitated the commission of, the racketeering
acts, the racketeering acts were committed at the behest of, or on behalf of,
the enterprise, or the racketeering acts had the same or similar purposes,
results, participants, victims or methods of commission. The continuity
requirement is likewise satisfied where the predicates are a regular way of
conducting the defendant's ongoing legitimate business (in the sense that it
is not a business that exists for criminal purposes), or of conducting or
participating in an ongoing and legitimate RICO 'enterprise.' A plaintiff may
demonstrate a pattern by establishment that the predicate acts pose a threat
of continued criminal activity, which is generally demonstrated by showing
either: * Closed-ended continuity. Proving 'a series of related predicate acts
extending over a substantial period of time.' * Open-ended continuity. A
threat of 'continuing criminal activity extending indefinitely into the future,'
in light of the nature of the enterprise and predicate acts alleged.
Summary
Detailed explanation of what constitutes a RICO enterprise and a pattern of
racketeering activity. It explains that a RICO enterprise can be any group of
individuals associated in fact, and that the pattern of racketeering activity
requires more than two predicate acts, needing proof of continuity and
relationship. The passage also clarifies that the racketeering acts need not
be similar but must be related to the enterprise's affairs. The continuity
requirement can be satisfied by showing either closed-ended or open-ended
continuity.

elements: * Existence of an enterprise; * The enterprise engaged in, or its
activities affected, interstate or foreign commerce; * The defendant was
employed by or was associated with the enterprise; * The defendant
conducted or participated, either directly or indirectly, in the conduct of the

Summary
Elements necessary to establish a RICO claim under Section 1962(c). These
elements include the existence of an enterprise, the enterprise's
engagement in or effect on interstate or foreign commerce, the defendant's
association with the enterprise, the defendant's participation in the conduct
of the enterprise's affairs, and the defendant's participation through a
pattern of racketeering activity. The provided complaint seems to address
these elements by alleging the existence of an enterprise involving the
defendants, their engagement in activities affecting interstate commerce,
and their participation in a pattern of racketeering activity.
