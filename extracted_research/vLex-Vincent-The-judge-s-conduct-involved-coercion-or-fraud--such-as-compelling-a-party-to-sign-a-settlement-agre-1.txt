Question
The judge’s conduct involved coercion or fraud, such as compelling a party
to sign a settlement agreement under duress or through misrepresentation.
The Fifth Circuit applies a four-factor test to determine whether an act is
judicial: (1) normal judicial function; (2) judicial setting; (3) relation to a
case; (4) arising from official capacity. (Brewer v. Blackwell, 692 F.2d 387
(5th Cir. 1982)). While presiding over settlement discussions may be a
judicial function, using coercion or fraud to compel agreement is not a
normal judicial function and falls outside the scope of judicial capacity.
Therefore, even if the judge was acting in an official capacity, the nature of
the act (coercion/fraud) removes it from the protection of judicial immunity.
Answer (Fifth Circuit)
Short response
Judicial immunity does not protect a judge who uses coercion or fraud, such
as compelling a party to sign a settlement agreement under duress or
through misrepresentation, because such conduct is not a normal judicial
function under the Fifth Circuit’s four-factor test. Even if the judge acts in
an official capacity and within a judicial setting, the nature of coercion or
fraud removes the act from the scope of judicial immunity.
Summary
The Fifth Circuit applies a four-factor test to determine whether a judge’s
act is judicial and thus protected by judicial immunity: (1) whether the act is
a normal judicial function, (2) whether it occurred in a judicial setting, (3)
whether it relates to a case before the court, and (4) whether it arises from
the judge’s official capacity. While presiding over settlement discussions is
generally a judicial function, acts involving coercion or fraud—such as
forcing a party to settle under duress or through misrepresentation—are not
considered normal judicial functions and therefore fall outside the
protection of judicial immunity.
Case law from the Fifth Circuit, including Brewer v. Blackwell, 692 F.2d 387
(5th Cir. 1982), Malina v. Gonzales, 994 F.2d 1121 (5th Cir. 1993), and 
Jefferson v. City of Hazlehurst, 936 F.Supp. 382 (S.D. Miss. 1995),
consistently holds that judicial immunity does not extend to nonjudicial acts,
particularly those involving coercion or fraud. Even if the other factors of
the test are met, the absence of a normal judicial function is dispositive, and
immunity is not available for such conduct.

Background and Relevant Law
Judicial Immunity in the Fifth Circuit
Judicial immunity is a well-established doctrine that protects judges from
liability for acts performed in their judicial capacity. The doctrine is
designed to preserve judicial independence by shielding judges from
personal liability for their judicial acts, even if those acts are in error,
malicious, or in excess of their authority. However, this immunity is not
absolute.
The U.S. Supreme Court and the Fifth Circuit have articulated two primary
exceptions to judicial immunity: (1) actions taken in the clear absence of all
jurisdiction, and (2) actions not taken in the judge’s judicial capacity. The
focus here is on the second exception—whether the act is judicial in nature.
The Four-Factor Test
The Fifth Circuit, building on Supreme Court precedent, has developed a
four-factor test to determine whether an act is judicial and thus protected by
immunity. This test, as articulated in Brewer v. Blackwell, 692 F.2d 387 (5th
Cir. 1982), and reaffirmed in subsequent cases, asks:
Whether the act complained of is a normal judicial function;
Whether the events occurred in the judge’s court or chambers;
Whether the controversy centered around a case then pending before
the judge; and
Whether the confrontation arose directly and immediately out of a visit
to the judge in his judicial capacity.
These factors are generally construed broadly in favor of immunity, but the
first factor—whether the act is a normal judicial function—is critical and can
be dispositive.
Key Case Law
Brewer v. Blackwell
In Brewer v. Blackwell, 692 F.2d 387 (5th Cir. 1982), the Fifth Circuit
clarified that judicial officers are not immune from liability for acts
performed in a nonjudicial capacity. The court emphasized that if an act
involves both judicial and nonjudicial conduct, the nonjudicial behavior must
be separated and is not protected by immunity. The court’s four-part test, as
outlined above, is central to this determination.
Malina v. Gonzales
Malina v. Gonzales, 994 F.2d 1121 (5th Cir. 1993) reaffirmed the four-factor
test and clarified that judicial immunity does not extend to actions outside a
judge’s judicial capacity or those performed in the clear absence of all

jurisdiction. The court noted that the four factors should be construed
broadly in favor of immunity, but also recognized that immunity should not
be denied unless the act clearly falls outside the scope of normal judicial
functions.
It is important to note that Malina v. Gonzales was reheard by the Fifth
Circuit in Malina v. Gonzales, 1 F.3d 304 (5th Cir. 1993). However, the
rehearing did not disturb the core principles regarding the four-factor test
and the limits of judicial immunity for nonjudicial acts.
Jefferson v. City of Hazlehurst
In Jefferson v. City of Hazlehurst, 936 F.Supp. 382 (S.D. Miss. 1995), the
district court, relying on Supreme Court and Fifth Circuit precedent,
reiterated that judicial immunity is not absolute and can be defeated if the
judge’s actions are not taken in a judicial capacity. The court again
referenced the four-factor test and emphasized that an act is judicial if it is a
function normally performed by a judge and the parties are dealing with the
judge in his judicial capacity.
Ammons v. Baldwin
In Ammons v. Baldwin, 705 F.2d 1445 (5th Cir. 1983), the Fifth Circuit held
that a judge’s threat of physical abuse was not a normal judicial function
and thus not protected by judicial immunity, even though the other three
factors of the test were met. This case illustrates that the first factor—
normal judicial function—can be determinative.
Analysis
Application of the Four-Factor Test
1. Normal Judicial Function
The first and most critical factor is whether the act complained of is a
normal judicial function. Presiding over settlement discussions is generally
considered a judicial function, as judges often facilitate settlements in civil
cases. However, the use of coercion or fraud—such as compelling a party to
sign a settlement agreement under duress or through misrepresentation—
falls outside the scope of what is considered normal judicial conduct.
The Fifth Circuit has made clear that acts which are not normal judicial
functions are not protected by judicial immunity, even if they occur in a
judicial setting or arise from a case before the court. In Brewer v. Blackwell,
the court stated that nonjudicial conduct must be separated from judicial
acts, and judges are liable for acts that are not judicial in nature (692 F.2d at
387). Similarly, in Ammons v. Baldwin, the court found that threats of
physical abuse were not normal judicial functions and thus not protected by
immunity (705 F.2d at 1447).

Applying this reasoning, coercion or fraud in compelling a settlement
agreement is not a normal judicial function. While a judge may encourage
settlement, the use of duress or misrepresentation is fundamentally
inconsistent with the impartial and fair administration of justice that defines
the judicial role.
2. Judicial Setting
The second factor considers whether the act occurred in the courtroom or
an appropriate judicial setting, such as the judge’s chambers. In the
scenario described, the conduct likely occurred during settlement
discussions overseen by the judge, which would typically satisfy this factor.
3. Relation to a Case
The third factor asks whether the controversy centered around a case
pending before the court. Settlement discussions are inherently related to a
pending case, so this factor would also be met.
4. Arising from Official Capacity
The fourth factor examines whether the act arose directly out of a visit to
the judge in his official capacity. If the judge was presiding over settlement
discussions as part of his official duties, this factor would be satisfied.
Synthesis
Although the second, third, and fourth factors are likely satisfied in the
scenario described, the first factor—whether the act is a normal judicial
function—is not. The Fifth Circuit has held that the absence of a normal
judicial function is sufficient to defeat judicial immunity, even if the other
factors are present. This is illustrated in Ammons v. Baldwin, where the
court denied immunity for conduct that was not a normal judicial function,
despite the other factors being met (705 F.2d at 1447).
Judicial Immunity and Nonjudicial Acts
The doctrine of judicial immunity is designed to protect judges from liability
for their judicial acts, but it does not extend to nonjudicial acts. In Jefferson
v. City of Hazlehurst, the court emphasized that judicial immunity can be
defeated if the judge’s actions are not taken in a judicial capacity (936
F.Supp. at 385). The use of coercion or fraud is not a judicial act, even if it
occurs in the context of a judicial proceeding.
The Supreme Court’s decision in Stump v. Sparkman, 435 U.S. 349 (1978),
as cited in the Fifth Circuit cases, supports this distinction. The Court
recognized that judicial immunity does not protect acts that are not judicial
in nature. The Fifth Circuit has refined this principle through its four-factor
test, with the first factor serving as a critical threshold.

Subsequent Treatment of Malina v. Gonzales
It is important to acknowledge that Malina v. Gonzales, 994 F.2d 1121 (5th
Cir. 1993) was reheard by the Fifth Circuit in Malina v. Gonzales, 1 F.3d 304
(5th Cir. 1993). However, the rehearing did not alter the fundamental
principles regarding the four-factor test or the limits of judicial immunity for
nonjudicial acts. The core holding—that judicial immunity does not extend to
acts outside a judge’s judicial capacity—remains good law and is consistent
with other Fifth Circuit and Supreme Court precedents.
Illustrative Example: Threats and Coercion
The Fifth Circuit’s decision in Ammons v. Baldwin provides a useful analogy.
There, the court held that a judge’s threat of physical abuse was not a
normal judicial function and thus not protected by judicial immunity, even
though the other three factors of the test were satisfied (705 F.2d at 1447).
By analogy, coercion or fraud in compelling a settlement agreement is
similarly outside the scope of normal judicial functions and not protected by
immunity.
Exceptions and Caveats
Broad Construction of Immunity
The Fifth Circuit has stated that the four factors should be broadly
construed in favor of immunity, and that immunity should not be denied
unless the act clearly falls outside the scope of normal judicial functions
(Malina v. Gonzales, 994 F.2d 1121, 1124 (5th Cir. 1993)). However, the use
of coercion or fraud is so clearly outside the bounds of normal judicial
conduct that it cannot be protected, even under a broad construction.
Mixed Acts
If a judge’s conduct involves both judicial and nonjudicial elements, the
nonjudicial behavior must be separated and is not protected by immunity
(Brewer v. Blackwell, 692 F.2d 387, 398 (5th Cir. 1982)). Thus, if a judge
presides over a settlement discussion (a judicial act) but also uses coercion
or fraud (a nonjudicial act), only the latter conduct is unprotected.
Jurisdictional Limits
Judicial immunity is also not available for acts performed in the clear
absence of all jurisdiction. However, in the scenario described, the focus is
on the nature of the act rather than the judge’s jurisdiction.
Conclusion
In summary, under the Fifth Circuit’s four-factor test, judicial immunity does
not protect a judge who uses coercion or fraud to compel a party to sign a

settlement agreement. While presiding over settlement discussions is
generally a judicial function, the use of duress or misrepresentation is not.
The first factor of the test—whether the act is a normal judicial function—is
dispositive, and the absence of this element removes the act from the
protection of judicial immunity. This conclusion is supported by consistent
Fifth Circuit case law, including Brewer v. Blackwell, 692 F.2d 387 (5th Cir.
1982), Malina v. Gonzales, 994 F.2d 1121 (5th Cir. 1993), and Jefferson v.
City of Hazlehurst, 936 F.Supp. 382 (S.D. Miss. 1995), as well as by analogy
to Ammons v. Baldwin, 705 F.2d 1445 (5th Cir. 1983). Even though the other
factors of the test may be satisfied, the nature of the act—coercion or fraud
—removes it from the scope of judicial capacity and the protection of judicial
immunity.
Legal Authorities
Brewer v. Blackwell, 692 F.2d 387 (5th Cir. 1982)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
When, however, judicial officers act in a 'nonjudicial' capacity, they are not
immune from liability for that conduct. ... If on occasion their acts involve
both judicial and nonjudicial conduct, the unprotected behavior must be
separated from the shielded and judges are liable for the acts that were not
judicial. ... The Supreme Court in Stump identified two factors relevant to
determining whether a given act is judicial. First, the act must be of the sort
judges ordinarily perform. ... This circuit has refined those criteria into a
four-part test. We inquire, in determining the judicial nature of an act,
whether: (1) the act complained of is a normal judicial function; (2) the
events occurred in the judge's court or chambers; (3) the controversy
centered around a case then pending before the judge, and (4) the
confrontation arose directly and immediately out of a visit to the judge in his
judicial capacity.
Summary
Judicial immunity does not protect acts that are nonjudicial in nature. The
passage outlines a four-part test to determine whether an act is judicial,
which includes assessing whether the act is a normal judicial function. If a
judge's conduct, such as using coercion or fraud, does not meet these
criteria, it is considered nonjudicial, and the judge may be liable for such
acts. This supports the proposition that coercion or fraud in compelling a
settlement agreement is not a normal judicial function and falls outside the
scope of judicial capacity.

Extract
Ammons' claim that Judge Baldwin threatened to abuse him physically,
however, charges conduct that is not protected by judicial immunity. Even
this conduct meets the last three criteria set forth in Brewer. But the threat
of physical abuse is clearly not a normal judicial function... The threat of
physical force, like its actual application, strays too far from the normal
conduct of a judge to enjoy immunity.
Summary
The Fifth Circuit recognizes that certain actions by a judge, such as threats
of physical abuse, are not considered normal judicial functions and therefore
do not enjoy judicial immunity. This aligns with the proposition that coercion
or fraud, which are also not normal judicial functions, would similarly fall
outside the scope of judicial immunity.
Malina v. Gonzales, 994 F.2d 1121 (5th Cir. 1993)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
Absolute judicial immunity extends to all judicial acts that are not performed
in the clear absence of all jurisdiction. ... a judge has no immunity (1) for
actions taken outside of his judicial capacity, or (2) for actions that are
judicial in nature, but occur in the complete absence of all jurisdiction. ... In
determining whether Judge Gonzales' actions were 'judicial in nature,' this
Court considers four factors: (1) whether the precise act complained of is a
normal judicial function; (2) whether the acts occurred in the courtroom or
appropriate adjunct spaces such as the judge's chambers; (3) whether the
controversy centered around a case pending before the court; and (4)
whether the acts arose directly out of a visit to the judge in his official
capacity. ... The four factors are to be broadly construed in favor of
immunity, and immunity should not be denied where the denial carries the
potential of raising more than a frivolous concern in a judge's mind that to
take proper action might expose him to personal liability.
Summary
Conditions under which judicial immunity applies and the four-factor test
used to determine if an act is judicial in nature. It emphasizes that immunity
does not cover actions taken outside of judicial capacity or in the absence of
jurisdiction. The passage supports the proposition by indicating that
coercion or fraud, which are not normal judicial functions, would fall outside
the scope of judicial capacity and thus not be protected by judicial immunity.

The doctrine of judicial immunity, though longstanding and expansive, is not
absolute. Judicial immunity can be defeated in two sets of circumstances. ...
Secondly, 'a judge is not immune from liability for nonjudicial actions, i.e.,
actions not taken in the judge's judicial capacity.' Mireles v. Waco, 502 U.S.
9, 11, 112 S.Ct. 286, 288, 116 L.Ed.2d 9 (1991); Forrester v. White, 484 U.S.

435 U.S. 349, 360, 98 S.Ct. 1099, 1106, 55 L.Ed.2d 331 (1978). ... An act by
a judge is a judicial one where it is a function normally performed by a judge
and the parties are dealing with the judge in his judicial capacity. Mireles,
502 U.S. at 11, 112 S.Ct. at 288. ... there are four factors generally relied
upon in determining whether an act is judicial, thereby entitled to judicial
immunity: (1) whether the precise act complained of is a normal judicial
function; (2) whether the subject act occurred in the courtroom or
appropriate adjunct spaces such as the judge's chambers; (3) whether the
controversy centered around cases pending before the court; and (4)
whether the act arose directly out of a visit to the judge in his official
capacity.
Summary
Four-factor test used to determine whether an act is judicial, which aligns
with the proposition's argument that coercion or fraud is not a normal
judicial function. Therefore, if a judge uses coercion or fraud, it could be
considered a nonjudicial action, thus not protected by judicial immunity.
