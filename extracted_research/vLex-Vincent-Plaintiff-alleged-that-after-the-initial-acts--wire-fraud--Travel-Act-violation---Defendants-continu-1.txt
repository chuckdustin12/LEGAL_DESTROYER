Question
Plaintiff alleged that after the initial acts (wire fraud, Travel Act violation),
Defendants continued to communicate, threaten, and interfere with
Plaintiff’s legal and business affairs, including taunting messages and
ongoing coordination regarding the divorce and litigation. Open-ended
continuity exists where the predicate acts pose a threat of continued
criminal activity, such as when the acts are part of the regular way of
conducting business or where there is an implicit or explicit threat of
repetition. (H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 242-43; Johnson v. Heath, 56 F.4th at
859-60). The district court erred by characterizing the ongoing
communications and threats as unrelated to the original scheme, rather than
as evidence of a continuing threat or as acts in furtherance of the
enterprise’s objectives. The court’s approach is inconsistent with Supreme
Court and Tenth Circuit precedent, which require a fact-specific inquiry into
whether the acts, taken together, pose a threat of continued racketeering
activity.
Answer (Tenth Circuit)
Short response
The district court erred in dismissing the ongoing communications, threats,
and interference as unrelated to the original racketeering scheme; Supreme
Court and Tenth Circuit precedent require a fact-specific inquiry into
whether such acts, taken together, pose a threat of continued racketeering
activity and may establish open-ended continuity under RICO. Ongoing
conduct that furthers the enterprise’s objectives or poses a threat of
repetition can satisfy the continuity requirement, and the court’s approach
was inconsistent with controlling authority.
Summary
Under both Supreme Court and Tenth Circuit law, the RICO “pattern”
requirement demands not only multiple predicate acts but also a showing of
“continuity plus relationship.” Continuity can be established through either
a closed period of repeated conduct or, as relevant here, open-ended
continuity—where the predicate acts pose a threat of continued criminal
activity, such as when ongoing communications, threats, or interference are
part of the regular way of conducting business or suggest an implicit or
explicit threat of repetition.
The district court’s failure to consider the ongoing acts as evidence of a
continuing threat or as acts in furtherance of the enterprise’s objectives was
inconsistent with binding precedent. Both the Supreme Court and the Tenth
Circuit have emphasized that the existence of a threat of continued
racketeering activity is a fact-specific inquiry, and ongoing conduct related
to the enterprise’s affairs may satisfy the open-ended continuity

requirement. The court should have considered the totality of the
circumstances, including the ongoing communications and threats, in
determining whether the pattern requirement was met.
Background and Relevant Law
Statutory Framework
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C.
§§ 1961–1968, prohibits conducting an enterprise’s affairs through a pattern
of racketeering activity. A “pattern” requires at least two predicate acts of
racketeering activity within ten years, but the Supreme Court has made
clear that two acts alone are not sufficient; there must also be a relationship
between the acts and a threat of continued criminal activity (H.J. Inc. v.
Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229 (1989); Johnson v. Heath, 56 F.4th
851, 859-60 (10th Cir. 2022)).
Case Law
Supreme Court and Tenth Circuit Precedent
The Supreme Court in H.J. Inc. established that a RICO “pattern” requires
both “relationship” and “continuity.” Relationship is shown when predicate
acts have similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods, or are
otherwise interrelated and not isolated. Continuity, the focus here, can be
either closed-ended (a series of related predicates over a substantial period)
or open-ended (conduct that poses a threat of continuing into the future)
(H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 239-43).
The Tenth Circuit has consistently followed this framework, emphasizing
that continuity may be established by showing that the predicate acts
themselves involve a distinct threat of long-term racketeering activity, either
implicit or explicit, or that the acts are part of the regular way of conducting
the enterprise’s business (Johnson v. Heath, 56 F.4th at 859-60; Bixler v.
Foster, 596 F.3d 751, 761 (10th Cir. 2010); Resolution Trust Corp. v. Stone,
998 F.2d 1534, 1543 (10th Cir. 1993)).
Open-ended continuity is particularly relevant where the acts, even if
occurring over a short period, pose a threat of repetition or are part of an
ongoing scheme without a single, finite objective (Edwards v. First Nat.
Bank, Bartlesville, Oklahoma, 872 F.2d 347, 351 (10th Cir. 1989); Condict v.
Condict, 826 F.2d 923, 927 (10th Cir. 1987)). The Tenth Circuit has also
stressed that the inquiry is fact-specific and must consider the totality of the
circumstances (Fisher Sand & Gravel Co. v. FNF Constr., Inc., No. 10-
cv-0635 RB/SMV (D. N.M. Mar 27, 2013); U.S. v. Smith, 413 F.3d 1253, 1266
(10th Cir. 2005)).

Secondary Materials
Secondary authorities reinforce that continuity can be established by
showing that the predicate acts are part of the regular way of conducting
business or that there is a threat of continued criminal activity, and that the
acts need not be identical but must be related to the enterprise’s affairs
(RICO: A Primer (2022); Racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations.
(2011)).
Analysis
The Continuity Requirement: Open-Ended Continuity
The central issue is whether the ongoing communications, threats, and
interference following the initial predicate acts (wire fraud, Travel Act
violation) can satisfy the open-ended continuity requirement for a RICO
pattern. Under H.J. Inc. and its progeny, open-ended continuity exists where
the predicate acts pose a threat of continued criminal activity. This can be
shown in several ways:
Explicit or Implicit Threat of Repetition: If the acts themselves
include a specific threat of repetition extending indefinitely into the
future, this supplies the requisite threat of continuity (H.J. Inc., 492
U.S. at 242-43; Johnson v. Heath, 56 F.4th at 859-60; Chapter 4.
Elements of Cause of Action).
Regular Way of Conducting Business: If the predicate acts are part
of the regular way the enterprise conducts its business, continuity is
established (Watchous Enterprrises, LLC v. Pac. Nat'l Capital, LLC,
Case No. 16-1432-JTM (D. Kan. Jul 25, 2018); Resolution Trust Corp. v.
Stone, 998 F.2d at 1543).
Long-Term Association for Criminal Purposes: If the acts can be
attributed to a defendant operating as part of a long-term association
that exists for criminal purposes, continuity is also satisfied (Chapter 4.
Elements of Cause of Action).
The Tenth Circuit has repeatedly held that the continuity requirement is not
met by isolated or sporadic acts, or by a scheme with a single, discrete
objective that ends when the goal is achieved (Pitts v. Turner and Boisseau
Chartered, 850 F.2d 650, 652 (10th Cir. 1988); Condict v. Condict, 826 F.2d
at 927). However, where the scheme is ongoing, lacks a finite endpoint, or
contemplates future criminal conduct, open-ended continuity may be
established (Edwards v. First Nat. Bank, 872 F.2d at 351).
Application to Ongoing Communications, Threats, and
Interference
The plaintiff’s allegations—that after the initial predicate acts, defendants
continued to communicate, threaten, and interfere with the plaintiff’s legal
and business affairs, including taunting messages and ongoing coordination
1.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
regarding divorce and litigation—are precisely the type of conduct that may
evidence open-ended continuity under the controlling authorities.
Relationship to the Enterprise’s Objectives: The ongoing acts are
not isolated or unrelated; rather, they are alleged to be in furtherance
of the enterprise’s objectives, such as intimidating the plaintiff,
interfering with legal and business affairs, and perpetuating the
scheme. This satisfies the “relationship” prong (Schrag v. Dinges, 788
F.Supp. 1543, 1550 (D. Kan. 1992); RICO: A Primer (2022)).
Threat of Continued Criminal Activity: The ongoing
communications and threats, especially if they are part of a pattern of
interference and intimidation, may constitute an implicit or explicit
threat of repetition. If the enterprise’s conduct is ongoing and not
limited to a single, completed objective, this supports a finding of open-
ended continuity (Nation v. Shah, 4:19-cv-00588-JDR-JFJ (N.D. Okla. Oct
30, 2024); Fisher Sand & Gravel Co. v. FNF Constr., Inc.).
Fact-Specific Inquiry Required: Both the Supreme Court and the
Tenth Circuit have emphasized that whether continuity exists is a fact-
specific inquiry, requiring consideration of the totality of the
circumstances. The district court’s categorical dismissal of the ongoing
acts as unrelated to the original scheme is inconsistent with this
requirement (H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 242; Johnson v. Heath, 56 F.4th at
859-60; U.S. v. Smith, 413 F.3d at 1266).
Regular Way of Conducting Business: If the ongoing acts are part of
the regular way the enterprise operates—such as using threats and
interference to achieve its goals—this further supports a finding of
open-ended continuity (Watchous Enterprrises, LLC v. Pac. Nat'l
Capital, LLC; Gotfredson v. Larsen Lp, 432 F.Supp.2d 1163, 1177 (D.
Colo. 2006)).
The District Court’s Error
The district court’s approach—treating the ongoing communications and
threats as unrelated to the original scheme—contravenes the requirement
for a fact-specific inquiry and the broad, flexible approach to continuity
mandated by the Supreme Court and Tenth Circuit. The court should have
considered whether the ongoing acts, in context, posed a threat of continued
racketeering activity or were part of the regular way the enterprise
conducted its affairs (Nation v. Shah, 4:19-cv-00588-JDR-JFJ (N.D. Okla. Oct
30, 2024); Johnson v. Heath, 56 F.4th at 859-60).
Subsequent/Negative Treatment of Authorities
It is important to note that U.S. v. Smith, 413 F.3d 1253 (10th Cir. 2005) was
stated as overruled by United States v. Nissen, 555 F.Supp.3d 1174 (D. N.M.
2021). However, the relevant portions of Smith cited here—regarding the
fact-specific nature of the continuity inquiry and the distinction between
closed- and open-ended continuity—remain consistent with Supreme Court
and Tenth Circuit precedent and are supported by other authorities cited

above. Similarly, Condict v. Condict, 815 F.2d 579 (10th Cir. 1987) was
stated as superseded by a New Mexico Supreme Court case, but the
relevant discussion of continuity is echoed in later Tenth Circuit and
Supreme Court cases, so its persuasive value on this point remains intact.
Exceptions and Caveats
While ongoing acts may establish open-ended continuity, courts have
cautioned that a scheme with a single, discrete objective that ends when the
goal is achieved does not, by itself, create a threat of ongoing activity. There
must be evidence that the scheme is not isolated or that it contemplates
future criminal conduct (Pitts v. Turner and Boisseau Chartered, 850 F.2d at
652; Condict v. Condict, 826 F.2d at 927). The inquiry is highly fact-specific,
and the plaintiff must plausibly allege that the ongoing acts are related to
the enterprise’s affairs and pose a threat of continued racketeering activity
(Fisher Sand & Gravel Co. v. FNF Constr., Inc.).
Conclusion
In sum, the district court erred by failing to consider the ongoing
communications, threats, and interference as potential evidence of open-
ended continuity under RICO. Supreme Court and Tenth Circuit precedent
require a fact-specific inquiry into whether such acts, taken together, pose a
threat of continued racketeering activity or are part of the regular way the
enterprise conducts its affairs. The ongoing acts alleged by the plaintiff
could satisfy the continuity requirement, and the court’s categorical
dismissal of these acts as unrelated to the original scheme was inconsistent
with controlling law. The totality of the circumstances must be considered to
determine whether the pattern requirement is met.

Extract
Fisher relies on open-ended continuity to prove the 'pattern' element of its
RICO claim. (Doc. 105 at 18). Open-ended continuity depends heavily on the
facts of the case. Resolution Trust Corp., 998 F.2d at 1543. For 12(b)(6)
purposes, open-ended continuity is established if the plaintiff can plausibly
allege 'that there was a threat of continuing criminal activity beyond the
period during which the predicate acts were performed.' Heinrich, 668 F.3d
at 410. The threat of continuing racketeering activity need not be
established exclusively by the predicate acts, and the court should consider
the totality of the circumstances surrounding the commission of the acts. Id.

Summary
Concept of open-ended continuity in the context of RICO claims,
emphasizing that it depends heavily on the facts of the case and the totality
of the circumstances. It supports the idea that ongoing communications and
threats can be considered part of a pattern of racketeering activity if they
pose a threat of continued criminal activity. This aligns with the proposition
that the district court erred by not considering the ongoing acts as evidence
of a continuing threat.

U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
Only the continuity prong of the pattern element is at issue in this case.
'Continuity' is both a closed- and open-ended concept: closed-ended
referring to a closed period of repeated conduct and open-ended referring to
conduct that by its nature projects into the future with a threat of repetition.
See id. at 241, 109 S.Ct. at 2902; Phelps v. Wichita Eagle-Beacon, 886 F.2d
1262, 1273 (10th Cir.1989). A party alleging a RICO violation may
demonstrate continuity over a closed period by proving a series of related
predicates extending over a substantial period of time. H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at
242, 109 S.Ct. at 2902; Phelps, 886 F.2d at 1273. Predicate acts extending
over a few weeks or months are insufficient to show closed-ended continuity.
H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 242, 109 S.Ct. at 2902. Open-ended continuity depends
upon the facts of each case, and may be established by showing that the
predicates themselves involve a distinct threat of long-term racketeering
activity, either implicit or explicit, or that the predicates are a regular way of
conducting the defendant's ongoing legitimate business or the RICO
enterprise. Id. at 242-43, 109 S.Ct. at 2902.
Summary
Concept of continuity in RICO cases, distinguishing between closed-ended
and open-ended continuity. It explains that open-ended continuity can be
established by showing a threat of long-term racketeering activity or that
the predicates are a regular way of conducting business. This directly
supports the proposition that ongoing communications and threats can be
seen as evidence of a continuing threat or acts in furtherance of the
enterprise's objectives, aligning with the requirement for a fact-specific
inquiry into whether the acts pose a threat of continued racketeering
activity.

Predicate acts must also 'amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal
activity' in order to establish a pattern of racketeering activity. H.J., 492 U.S.
at 239, 109 S.Ct. 2893. 'Continuity' is both a closed—and open-ended
concept, referring either to a closed period of repeated conduct, or to past
conduct that by its nature projects into the future with a threat of repetition.
Id. at 241, 109 S.Ct. 2893. Proving continuity may be done in several ways;
there is no bright-line rule. Id. Indeed, whether this requirement is met
'depends on the specific facts of each case.' Id. at 242, 109 S.Ct. 2893.
Summary
Concept of continuity in the context of racketeering activity, emphasizing
that continuity can be either closed-ended or open-ended. It highlights that
proving continuity is fact-specific and does not follow a strict rule, aligning
with the proposition that ongoing communications and threats can be seen
as part of a continuing threat or acts in furtherance of an enterprise's
objectives. This supports the argument that the district court should have
considered the ongoing acts as evidence of a continuing threat.

U.S. District Court — District of Kansas
Extract
Both Section 1962(c) and Section 1962(a) require a showing of a pattern of
racketeering activity, consisting of at least two predicate acts. See 18 U.S.C.
§§ 1961(5), 1962(a), (c). In order to satisfy this requirement, there must be
both a relationship between the predicate acts and some element of
continuity. See H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 239
(1989). The Supreme Court has explained the continuity requirement as
follows: 'Continuity' is both a closed- and open-ended concept, referring
either to a closed period of repeated conduct, or to past conduct that by its
nature projects into the future with a threat of repetition. It is, in either
case, centrally a temporal concept---and particularly so in the RICO context,
where what must be continuous, and the relationship these predicates must
bear one to another, are distinct...
Summary
Requirement of continuity in RICO cases, referencing the Supreme Court's
explanation in H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co. It highlights that
continuity can be open-ended, involving a threat of future violations, which
aligns with the proposition that ongoing communications and threats can be
seen as evidence of a continuing threat. This supports the argument that the
district court erred by not considering these acts as part of a continuous
pattern of racketeering activity.

Advanced Optics Electronics, Inc. v. Robins, 633 F.Supp.2d 1237 (D. N.M.
2008)
U.S. District Court — District of New Mexico
Extract
The Supreme Court and the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth
Circuit have held that merely showing two acts of racketeering within the
requisite ten-year period is not sufficient to show an actual pattern of
racketeering activity. `[T]he statement that a pattern `requires at least' two
predicates implies `that while two acts are necessary, they may not be
sufficient.'` H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co., 492 U.S. 229, 237,
109 S.Ct. 2893, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989). Rather, based upon RICO's
legislative history and the ordinary usage of the word `pattern,` a pattern of
racketeering activity `requires the showing of a relationship between the
predicates` and `the threat of continuing activity.` H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern
Bell Telephone Co., 492 U.S. at 239, 109 S.Ct. 2893 (citation and internal
quotation marks omitted). As the Tenth Circuit has explained, both elements
must be present. Even if the racketeering activities are part of a common
scheme, there is no showing of a RICO claim if the plaintiff has `failed to
show that they pose a threat of continuing criminal activity.` Duran v. Carris,
238 F.3d 1268, 1271 (10th Cir.2001).
Summary
The Tenth Circuit requires both a relationship between predicate acts and a
threat of continuing activity to establish a pattern of racketeering. This
aligns with the proposition that ongoing communications and threats can be
seen as evidence of a continuing threat or acts in furtherance of an
enterprise's objectives. The passage supports the idea that the district court
erred by not considering the ongoing acts as part of a continuing threat,
consistent with Supreme Court and Tenth Circuit precedent.

(1989) (quotation omitted). Interpreting RICO's legislative history, the
Supreme Court stated that the pattern element is not satisfied by a showing

Summary
The passage from "Duran v. Carris" highlights the necessity of
demonstrating both a relationship between predicate acts and a threat of
continuing activity to establish a RICO pattern. This aligns with the
proposition that ongoing communications and threats can be part of a
continuing threat or acts in furtherance of an enterprise's objectives. The
passage supports the idea that the district court should have considered
whether the acts posed a threat of continued racketeering activity,

A RICO claim 'must allege a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1962, which consists of
four elements: (1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of
racketeering activity.' Gillmor, 490 F.3d at 797 (quotation omitted). A
'pattern' requires at least two predicate acts. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5). In
addition, '[t]o satisfy RICO's pattern requirement, [a plaintiff must] allege
not only that the defendants had committed two or more predicate acts, but
also that the predicates themselves amount to, or that they otherwise
constitute a threat of, continuing racketeering activity.' Hall v. Witteman,
584 F.3d 859, 867 (10th Cir.2009) (quotation omitted). A viable RICO claim
requires a showing of 'continuity plus relationship.' Sedima, 473 U.S. at 496
n. 14, 105 S.Ct. 3275 (quotation omitted). 'The relationship test is not a
cumbersome one for a RICO plaintiff. A showing that predicate acts have the
same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of
commission, or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics
and are not isolated events is essentially all that is needed.' Boone v.
Carlsbad Bancorporation, Inc., 972 F.2d 1545, 1555 (10th Cir. 1992)
(quotations omitted). The showing required for 'continuity,' on the other
hand, 'is more difficult to meet.' Id. '`Continuity' is both a closed- and open-
ended concept, referring either to a closed period of repeated conduct, or to
past conduct that by its nature projects into the future with a threat of

109 S.Ct. 2893, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989). The Supreme Court has determined
'that when Congress said predicates must demonstrate `continuity' before
they may form a RICO pattern, it expressed an intent that RICO reach
activities that amount to or threaten long-term criminal activity.' Id. at 243
n. 4, 109 S.Ct. 2893.
Summary
Requirements for a RICO claim, emphasizing the need for a pattern of
racketeering activity, which includes demonstrating both continuity and
relationship among predicate acts. The passage specifically highlights that
continuity can be open-ended, referring to conduct that projects into the

Johnson v. Heath, 56 F.4th 851 (10th Cir. 2022)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
The Supreme Court has attempted to provide some guidance—though
whether that guidance provides any more clarity than the statute is subject
to dispute. See H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 252, 109 S.Ct. 2893 (Scalia, J.,
concurring) (&#34;I doubt that the lower courts will find the Court&#39;s
instructions much more helpful than telling them to look for a ‘pattern’—
which is what the statute already says.&#34;). According to the Supreme
Court, a RICO pattern requires that the racketeering predicates relate to
each other and amount to a threat of continued racketeering activity. Id. at
239, 109 S.Ct. 2893. No pattern exists without this &#34;continuity plus
relationship.&#34; Id. (emphasis omitted). ... Continuity can be either
closed or open ended. Id. at 241, 109 S.Ct. 2893. Closed-ended continuity is
a closed period of repeated racketeering conduct, while open-ended
continuity consists of racketeering conduct that threatens future repetition.
Id. Plaintiffs can establish open-ended continuity by showing that the
racketeering acts involved implicit or explicit threats of repetition, that they
formed the operations of an association that exists for criminal purposes, or
that they were the defendants’ regular way of conducting a legitimate
enterprise. Id. at 242–43, 109 S.Ct. 2893.
Summary
The passage from "Johnson v. Heath" discusses the requirements for
establishing a RICO pattern, emphasizing the need for "continuity plus
relationship" among predicate acts. It explains that open-ended continuity
can be shown through acts that pose a threat of future repetition, are part of
a criminal association, or are the regular way of conducting business. This
directly supports the proposition that ongoing communications and threats
can be seen as evidence of a continuing threat or acts in furtherance of an
enterprise's objectives, aligning with the Supreme Court and Tenth Circuit
precedent.

A violation of section 1962(c) thus 'requires (1) conduct (2) of an enterprise
(3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity.' Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex
Co., 473 U.S. 479, 105 S.Ct. 3275, 3285, 87 L.Ed.2d 346 (1985). RICO
defines racketeering activity as, inter alia, any act that is indictable under
18 U.S.C. Sec. 1341 (mail fraud) or 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1343 (wire fraud). See 18
U.S.C. Sec. 1961(1)(B). RICO also states that a ' "pattern of racketeering
activity" requires at least two acts of racketeering activity.' 18 U.S.C. Sec.
1961(5). ... [T]o establish a RICO pattern, a plaintiff must also demonstrate
continuity, that is, 'the threat of continuing activity.' Sedima, 105 S.Ct. at
3285 n. 14. This element is derived from RICO's legislative history, which
indicates that RICO does not apply to 'sporadic activity' or to the 'isolated
offender'. Id. The continuity requirement has been the source of
considerable difficulty. Courts generally agree that to make an adequate
showing of continuity under Sedima, a plaintiff must demonstrate some facts
from which at least a threat of ongoing illegal conduct may be inferred. A
scheme to achieve a single discrete objective does not in and of itself create
a threat of ongoing activity, even when that goal is pursued by multiple
illegal acts, because the scheme ends when the purpose is accomplished.
Summary
Requirements for establishing a RICO violation, emphasizing the need for a
pattern of racketeering activity, which includes demonstrating continuity or
the threat of ongoing illegal conduct. This aligns with the proposition that
ongoing communications and threats can be part of a pattern of
racketeering activity if they pose a threat of continued criminal activity. The

whether the ongoing acts were part of a continuing threat rather than
isolated incidents.

scheme ends when the purpose is accomplished. Courts that have
considered a RICO claim grounded on this type of scheme have therefore
required some additional evidence showing that the scheme was not an
isolated occurrence. A more difficult question is presented when the RICO
claim is based on one scheme involving one victim, but the plan
contemplates open-ended fraudulent activity and does not have a single goal

that, when achieved, will bring the activity to an end. Some courts have
found that such an ongoing scheme is itself sufficient to satisfy the
continuity element of a RICO pattern.
Summary
Continuity requirement for establishing a RICO pattern, emphasizing that a
plaintiff must demonstrate a threat of ongoing illegal conduct. It highlights
that a scheme with a single discrete objective does not inherently pose a
threat of ongoing activity unless there is additional evidence showing the
scheme is not isolated. Importantly, it notes that an ongoing scheme with
open-ended fraudulent activity can satisfy the continuity element, which
aligns with the proposition that ongoing communications and threats can be
evidence of a continuing threat or acts in furtherance of an enterprise's
objectives.
Skurkey v. Daniel
U.S. District Court — Western District of Oklahoma
Extract
Defendants next argue the Complaint fails to allege a “pattern of
racketeering.” A “pattern” requires at least two predicate acts. 18 U.S.C. §
1961(5). Predicate acts must be violations of certain statutes, 18 U.S.C. §
1961(1), here alleged to be federal mail fraud and wire fraud statutes.
Additionally, a Plaintiff must allege facts from which the Court can conclude
the existence of a pattern, that is that the “predicates themselves amount to,
or that they otherwise constitute a threat of, continuing racketeering
activity.” H.J., Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co., 492 U.S. 229, 240
(1989) (emphasis original). The Supreme Court has explained that there are
two elements to finding a pattern for RICO purposes: “continuity plus
relationship.”
Summary
Requirements for establishing a "pattern of racketeering" under RICO,
emphasizing the need for predicate acts to either amount to or constitute a
threat of continuing racketeering activity. This aligns with the proposition's
assertion that ongoing communications and threats can be seen as evidence
of a continuing threat, supporting the idea of open-ended continuity. The
reference to H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co. further supports
the proposition by highlighting the importance of continuity and relationship
in determining a pattern of racketeering.

U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit

Extract
The continuity requirement has been the source of considerable difficulty.
Courts generally agree that to make an adequate showing of continuity
under Sedima, a plaintiff must demonstrate some facts from which at least a
threat of ongoing illegal conduct may be inferred. A scheme to achieve a
single discrete objective does not in and of itself create a threat of ongoing
activity, even when that goal is pursued by multiple illegal acts, because the
scheme ends when the purpose is accomplished. Courts that have
considered a RICO claim grounded on this type of scheme have therefore
required some additional evidence showing that the scheme was not an
isolated occurrence. See, e.g., Lipin Enters. Inc. v. Lee, 803 F.2d 322, 324
(7th Cir.1986) (acts to defraud one victim one time insufficient in absence of
showing of other victims or other frauds). A more difficult question is
presented when the RICO claim is based on one scheme involving one
victim, but the plan contemplates open-ended fraudulent activity and does
not have a single goal that, when achieved, will bring the activity to an end.
Some courts have found that such an ongoing scheme is itself sufficient to
satisfy the continuity element of a RICO pattern.
Summary
Requirement of continuity in RICO claims, emphasizing that a single scheme
with a discrete objective does not inherently demonstrate continuity unless
there is evidence of ongoing illegal conduct or a threat thereof. It highlights
that an ongoing scheme without a single endpoint can satisfy the continuity
requirement, which aligns with the proposition that ongoing
communications and threats can be part of a continuing threat or acts in
furtherance of an enterprise's objectives.

U.S. District Court — Northern District of Oklahoma
Extract
More difficult to establish-and more problematic for Plaintiffs-is the
requirement that the predicate acts have sufficient “continuity” to constitute
a RICO “pattern.” See Bixler v. Foster, 596 F.3d 751, 761 (10th Cir. 2010)
(indicating that the continuity requirement “is more difficult to
meet” (citation and quotation marks omitted)). For RICO purposes,
continuity comes in one of two forms: Closed-ended continuity can be
established by alleging a “closed period of repeated racketeering conduct.”
Johnson, 56 F.4th at 859-60 (citing H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 241-43). Open-ended
continuity can be established by racketeering acts that “involved implicit or
explicit threats of repetition,” “formed the operations of an association that
exists for criminal purposes,” or were part of the defendants' “regular way
of conducting a legitimate enterprise.”

=== PAGE 14 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
The concept of "continuity" in RICO cases can be established through open-
ended continuity, which involves acts that pose a threat of continued
criminal activity. This aligns with the proposition that ongoing
communications and threats can be seen as evidence of a continuing threat
or acts in furtherance of the enterprise’s objectives. The passage supports
the idea that the district court should consider whether the acts, taken
together, pose a threat of continued racketeering activity, consistent with
Supreme Court and Tenth Circuit precedent.
UMB Bank v. Monson, 21-CV-2504-EFM (D. Kan. Jun 04, 2025)
U.S. District Court — District of Kansas
Extract
To state a “pattern” of racketeering activity, the plaintiff must allege “at
least two acts of racketeering activity. .. which occurred within ten years.”[]
Moreover, “a RICO pattern requires that the racketeering predicates relate
to each other and amount to a threat of continued racketeering activity. No
pattern exists without this ‘continuity plus relationship.&#39;”[] ... Next, the
Court turns to the continuity requirement. Under this prong, a plaintiff must
allege that the acts amounted to or threaten continued racketeering activity.
[] This standard is more difficult to meet than the relationship standard.[]
Either “open-ended” or “closed-ended” continuity can satisfy the continuity
prong.
Summary
Requirements for establishing a "pattern" of racketeering activity under
RICO, emphasizing the need for continuity and relationship among predicate
acts. It highlights that continuity can be either open-ended or closed-ended,
and that a threat of continued racketeering activity is necessary. This aligns
with the proposition that ongoing communications and threats can be seen
as evidence of a continuing threat or acts in furtherance of an enterprise's
objectives, supporting the argument that the district court erred in its
characterization.

concept that racketeering acts form a 'pattern' in RICO where they exhibit

=== PAGE 15 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
'continuity plus relationship.' Id. at 239, 109 S.Ct. at 2900. The 'relationship'
requirement is satisfied when the racketeering acts have 'the same or
similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of commission, or
otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not
isolated events.' Id. at 240, 109 S.Ct. at 2901 (citing Sedima, 473 U.S. at 496
n. 14, 105 S.Ct. at 3285 n. 14). With respect to the 'continuity' requirement,
the Supreme Court stated that the predicate acts must amount to, or pose a
threat of, continuing racketeering activity. Id. According to the Supreme
Court, continuity 'is both a closed- and open-ended concept, referring to a
closed period of repeated conduct, or to past conduct that by its nature
projects into the future with a threat of repetition.' Id. A RICO plaintiff 'may
demonstrate continuity over a closed period by proving a series of related
predicates extending over a substantial period of time.' Id. Predicates
extending over merely a few weeks or months, on the other hand, may
satisfy the continuity element if there is a threat of repetition in the future.
This latter concept of continuity, which occurs over an 'open period,' is
established by showing that the predicate acts are a 'regular way of
conducting the enterprise's ongoing business.'
Summary
The Supreme Court's interpretation of RICO's pattern requirement involves
both continuity and relationship. The passage explains that continuity can be
demonstrated through either a closed period of repeated conduct or an
open-ended threat of future repetition. This aligns with the proposition that
ongoing communications and threats can be seen as part of a continuing
threat or as acts in furtherance of the enterprise’s objectives, thus
supporting the argument that the district court erred in its characterization.
Gotfredson v. Larsen Lp, 432 F.Supp.2d 1163 (D. Colo. 2006)
U.S. District Court — District of Colorado
Extract
Open-ended continuity 'may be established by showing that the predicates
themselves involve a distinct threat of long-term racketeering activity, either
implicit or explicit, or that the predicates are a regular way of conducting
the defendant's ongoing legitimate business or the RICO enterprise.' Id.
Open-ended continuity requires a clear threat of future criminal conduct.
Summary
Concept of open-ended continuity in the context of RICO claims, which is
directly relevant to the proposition. It explains that open-ended continuity
can be established by demonstrating a threat of long-term racketeering
activity or that the predicate acts are a regular way of conducting business.
This aligns with the proposition's assertion that the district court erred by
not recognizing the ongoing communications and threats as evidence of a
continuing threat or acts in furtherance of the enterprise's objectives.

Extract
A more difficult question is presented when the RICO claim is based on one
scheme involving one victim, but the plan contemplates open-ended
fraudulent activity and does not have a single goal that, when achieved, will
bring the activity to an end. Some courts have found that such an ongoing
scheme is itself sufficient to satisfy the continuity element of a RICO pattern.
Summary
Continuity requirement in RICO cases, specifically addressing situations
where a scheme involves ongoing fraudulent activity without a single goal
that concludes the activity. This aligns with the proposition that ongoing
communications and threats can be part of a continuing threat or acts in
furtherance of an enterprise's objectives. The passage supports the idea that
such ongoing schemes can satisfy the continuity element of a RICO pattern,
which is relevant to the proposition's argument about the district court's

JTM (D. Kan. Jul 25, 2018)
U.S. District Court — District of Kansas
Extract
A pattern of activity under the RICO statute means 'a series of related
predicates that together demonstrate the existence or threat of continued
criminal activity.' RJR Nabsico v. European Community, 136 S.Ct. 2090, 2096
(2016). This threat of continuity may be shown by demonstrating that 'the
predicate acts or offenses are part of an ongoing entity's regular way of
doing business.' H.J. Inc. v. Nw. Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 249 (1989).
Demonstrating the existence of a pattern of racketeering activity may be
satisfied by proof of prior acts with 'the same or similar purposes, results,
participants, victims, or methods of commission, or otherwise are
interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not isolated events is
essentially all that is needed.' Bixler v. Foster, 596 F.3d 751, 761 (10th Cir.
2010).
Summary
The passage provides a legal framework for establishing a pattern of
racketeering activity under the RICO statute. It emphasizes that a pattern

=== PAGE 17 ===

can be demonstrated by showing related predicate acts that pose a threat of
continued criminal activity, particularly when these acts are part of an
entity's regular business practices. This aligns with the proposition that
ongoing communications and threats can be seen as part of a continuing
threat or as acts in furtherance of an enterprise's objectives, thus supporting
the argument that the district court erred in its characterization.

The Supreme Court made a second attempt to clarify the 'pattern' concept in
H.J., Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co. In that case, the Court held
that when proving a 'pattern of racketeering activity,' RICO requires both
relationship and continuity of predicate acts as separate elements. However,
the Court recognized that proof of these factors will often overlap. The
relationship prong is defined by the connection of the defendant's criminal
acts to one another: 'continuity' is successfully proved if a prosecutor can
show actual continuity during a past, closed period of repeated conduct or
an open-ended threat of continued racketeering activity in the future. The
H.J., Inc. Court suggested a case-by-case examination of this issue.

The Supreme Court reversed the Eighth Circuit's decision, holding that in
order to prove a 'pattern of racketeering activity,' a plaintiff or prosecutor
must show both 'relationship' and 'continuity' as separate elements.
However, the Court recognized that these factors will often overlap. The
relationship prong is defined by the connection of the defendant's criminal
acts to one another. As the Court wrote: '[c]riminal conduct forms a pattern
if it embraces criminal acts that have the same or similar purposes, results,
participants, victims, or methods of commission, or otherwise are

'Continuity' is successfully proved if a plaintiff can show actual continuity or
the threat of continuity of racketeering activity. The Court seemed to

of a 'threat of continued racketeering activity' is a function of the particular
facts.
Summary
The Supreme Court's decision in H.J. Inc. emphasizes the need to
demonstrate both "relationship" and "continuity" to establish a pattern of
racketeering activity. The Court's recognition that these factors often
overlap and its emphasis on a case-by-case examination of the threat of
continued racketeering activity support the proposition that ongoing

The 'continuity' prong is satisfied by proof of either closed-ended continuity
or open-ended continuity. Closed-ended continuity in the RICO context may
be demonstrated 'by proving a series of related predicates extending over a
substantial period of time.' Open-ended continuity in the RICO context is
conduct that may last only a short period of time but nonetheless, poses a
threat of extending into the future. The Court suggested a case-by-case
examination of this issue, noting that the existence of a 'threat of continued
racketeering activity' is a function of particular facts.
Summary
Concept of continuity in the context of RICO, explaining that continuity can
be either closed-ended or open-ended. Open-ended continuity is particularly
relevant to the proposition as it involves conduct that poses a threat of

Extract
Open-ended continuity, in contrast, requires proof of 'a threat of continued
racketeering activity.' Id. at 242. Under H.J. Inc., open-ended continuity may
be established in various ways. The Court furnished some examples. First, a
small number of related predicates occurring close together in time will
establish open-ended continuity if 'the racketeering acts themselves include
a specific threat of repetition extending indefinitely into the future, and thus
supply the requisite threat of continuity.' Second, the threat of continuity
may be established with a 'showing that the predicate acts or offenses are

=== PAGE 24 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
part of an ongoing entity’s regular way of doing business.' Third, continuity
is proved 'if the predicates can be attributed to a defendant operating as
part of a long‑term association that exists for criminal purposes.'
Summary
Open-ended continuity in RICO cases can be established by demonstrating a
threat of continued racketeering activity. This can be shown if the predicate
acts include a specific threat of repetition, are part of an ongoing entity's
regular way of doing business, or are part of a long-term association for
criminal purposes. These criteria align with the proposition that the
defendants' ongoing actions could be seen as a continuation of the initial
scheme, posing a threat of continued criminal activity.
RICO: A Primer
Extract
The racketeering acts need not be similar or directly related to each other;
rather, it is sufficient that the racketeering acts are related in some way to
the affairs of the charged enterprise, including, for example, that: the
racketeering acts furthered the goals of or benefitted the enterprise, the
enterprise or the defendant's role in the enterprise enabled the defendant to
commit, or facilitated the commission of, the racketeering acts, the
racketeering acts were committed at the behest of, or on behalf of, the
enterprise, or the racketeering acts had the same or similar purposes,
results, participants, victims or methods of commission. The continuity
requirement is likewise satisfied where the predicates are a regular way of
conducting the defendant's ongoing legitimate business (in the sense that it
is not a business that exists for criminal purposes), or of conducting or
participating in an ongoing and legitimate RICO 'enterprise.' A plaintiff may
demonstrate a pattern by establishment that the predicate acts pose a threat
of continued criminal activity, which is generally demonstrated by showing
either: * Closed-ended continuity. Proving 'a series of related predicate acts
extending over a substantial period of time.' * Open-ended continuity. A
threat of 'continuing criminal activity extending indefinitely into the future,'
in light of the nature of the enterprise and predicate acts alleged.
Summary
The passage explains that racketeering acts do not need to be directly
related but must be connected to the enterprise's affairs. It also clarifies that
continuity can be established if the acts are part of the regular way of
conducting business or if there is a threat of ongoing criminal activity. This
supports the proposition that the ongoing communications and threats could
be seen as part of a pattern of racketeering activity, especially if they further

RICO: A Primer
Extract
The racketeering acts need not be similar or directly related to each other;
rather, it is sufficient that the racketeering acts are related in some way to
the affairs of the charged enterprise, including, for example, that: the
racketeering acts furthered the goals of or benefitted the enterprise, the
enterprise or the defendant's role in the enterprise enabled the defendant to
commit, or facilitated the commission of, the racketeering acts, the
racketeering acts were committed at the behest of, or on behalf of, the
enterprise, or the racketeering acts had the same or similar purposes,
results, participants, victims or methods of commission. The continuity
requirement is likewise satisfied where the predicates are a regular way of
conducting the defendant's ongoing legitimate business (in the sense that it
is not a business that exists for criminal purposes), or of conducting or
participating in an ongoing and legitimate RICO 'enterprise.' A plaintiff may
demonstrate a pattern by establishment that the predicate acts pose a threat
of continued criminal activity, which is generally demonstrated by showing
either: * Closed-ended continuity. Proving 'a series of related predicate acts
extending over a substantial period of time.' * Open-ended continuity. A
threat of 'continuing criminal activity extending indefinitely into the future,'
in light of the nature of the enterprise and predicate acts alleged.
Summary
The passage explains that racketeering acts do not need to be similar or
directly related but must be related to the enterprise's affairs. It also
clarifies that continuity can be established through a regular way of
conducting business or by demonstrating a threat of continued criminal
activity. This aligns with the proposition that ongoing communications and
threats can be seen as part of a continuing threat or acts in furtherance of
the enterprise's objectives, supporting the argument that the district court
erred in its characterization.
