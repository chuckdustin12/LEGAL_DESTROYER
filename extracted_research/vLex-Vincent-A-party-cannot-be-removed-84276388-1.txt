Question
A party cannot be removed from their home without a court finding of family violence, and the court must provide a fair forum for all parties involved.
Answer (Texas)
Short response
Under Texas law, a party cannot be removed from their home through a protective order without a court finding of family violence, and the statutory framework
ensures that all parties are afforded a fair forum through required hearings and evidentiary procedures. Both the Texas Family Code and Texas appellate courts
consistently mandate these procedural and substantive protections.
Summary
Texas statutes and case law make clear that removal of a party from their home—whether through a protective order or exclusion from a residence—requires a
judicial finding that family violence has occurred, and, in most cases, that it is likely to occur in the future. The process is structured to guarantee due process,
including notice, the opportunity to be heard, and judicial evaluation of evidence, thereby providing a fair forum for all parties involved.
The legislative framework, particularly the Texas Family Code, sets out explicit requirements for findings of family violence before any order affecting residence or
possession can be issued. Texas appellate courts have repeatedly affirmed these requirements, emphasizing that protective orders and related relief cannot be
granted absent such findings, and that the statutory hearing process is designed to ensure fairness and protect the rights of all parties.
Background and Relevant Law
Legislative Framework
The Texas Family Code provides the primary statutory basis for the removal of a party from their home in the context of family violence. Several key provisions
are directly relevant:
Protective Orders and Required Findings: Section 81.001 of the Texas Family Code requires a court to issue a protective order only if it finds that family
violence has occurred (Tex. Fam. Code § 81.001). Section 85.001 further mandates that, at the close of a hearing on an application for a protective order, the
court must determine whether family violence has occurred (Tex. Fam. Code § 85.001). If such a finding is made, the court must render a protective order as
provided by the Code.
Exclusion from Residence: Section 83.006 governs the exclusion of a party from their residence by a temporary ex parte order. It stipulates that exclusion is
permissible only if the applicant files a sworn affidavit detailing the facts and circumstances justifying exclusion and appears in person to testify at a temporary
ex parte hearing. The court must find, based on the affidavit and testimony, that the person to be excluded has committed family violence within the preceding
30 days and that there is a clear and present danger of further family violence (Tex. Fam. Code § 83.006).
Protective Orders Affecting Residence: Section 85.021 authorizes the court, in a protective order, to grant exclusive possession of a residence to one party
and direct another to vacate, but this authority is exercised within the context of a protective order, which itself requires a finding of family violence (Tex. Fam.
Code § 85.021).
Child Protection and Removal: Sections 262.1015, 262.102, and 262.201 address the removal of an alleged perpetrator or a child from a residence in cases
involving immediate danger to a child's physical health or safety, or where the child has been a victim of abuse or family violence. These provisions require the
court to make specific findings of danger or family violence and to conduct hearings to ensure due process (Tex. Fam. Code §§ 262.1015, 262.102, 262.201).
Case Law
Texas appellate courts have consistently interpreted and applied these statutory requirements, reinforcing the necessity of a court finding of family violence and
the provision of a fair forum:
In Hagner v. Valdez, 04-23-00379-CV (Tex. App. Mar 26, 2025), the court held that a trial court must render a protective order only if it finds that family
violence has occurred and is likely to occur in the future, and that this determination must be made at the close of a hearing.
Johnson v. Vernon, 05-24-00179-CV (Tex. App. Jan 27, 2025) emphasized the procedural requirement for a hearing on an application for a protective order,
with the court required to make findings regarding family violence before issuing any order that could result in removal from the home.
In Sanchez v. Sanchez, the court explained that the Texas Family Code defines family violence and that a finding of such violence is a prerequisite for orders
prohibiting a person from going near the residence of the protected person.
Velasquez v. Rayon (multiple passages) reiterated that a court must find both that family violence has occurred and is likely to occur in the future before
issuing a protective order, and that the absence of such findings can result in the vacating of the order.
In re A.H., 02-22-00241-CV (Tex. App. Apr 06, 2023) and Northfell v. Northfell, 01-22-00082-CV (Tex. App. Nov 03, 2022) both confirmed that the statutory
framework requires a court to make findings of family violence before issuing protective orders, and that these findings must be based on evidence presented
at a hearing.

Earlier cases such as Cox v. Walden, 13-20-00283-CV (Tex. App. Jan 13, 2022), Bell v. State ex rel. S.E.G., 659 S.W.3d 21 (Tex. App. 2021), Boyd v.
Palmore, 425 S.W.3d 425 (Tex. App. 2011), and In re Epperson, 213 S.W.3d 541 (Tex. App. 2007) all reinforce the requirement for a court finding of family
violence and the necessity of a hearing to ensure fairness.
In the context of child custody and visitation, In re C.A.C. and In re L.C.L., 396 S.W.3d 712 (Tex. App. 2013) highlight that findings of family violence are
required before restricting a parent's access or possession, and that the court must consider the best interests of the child and the safety of all parties.
Analysis
Statutory Prerequisites for Removal
The Texas Family Code establishes a clear and mandatory process for the removal of a party from their home in cases involving family violence. The statutory
scheme is designed to protect victims while safeguarding the due process rights of all parties.
Protective Orders: The issuance of a protective order, which may include provisions excluding a party from a shared residence, is contingent upon a judicial
finding that family violence has occurred. The court must also find, in most cases, that family violence is likely to occur in the future (Tex. Fam. Code §§
81.001, 85.001). This requirement is not discretionary; the court is obligated to make these findings based on the evidence presented at a hearing.
Exclusion from Residence: For temporary ex parte orders excluding a party from their residence, the applicant must provide a sworn affidavit and testify at a
hearing, and the court must find both recent family violence and a clear and present danger of further violence (Tex. Fam. Code § 83.006). Even though such
orders may be issued without notice to the respondent, the statutory requirements for evidence and judicial findings remain stringent.
Orders Affecting Children: In cases involving the removal of a child or an alleged perpetrator from a residence, the court must find immediate danger to the
child's physical health or safety, or that the child has been a victim of abuse or family violence (Tex. Fam. Code §§ 262.1015, 262.102, 262.201). These
provisions also require hearings and findings based on evidence.
Procedural Safeguards and Fair Forum
The Texas Family Code and the courts interpreting it are explicit in requiring that all parties be afforded a fair forum:
Notice and Hearing: Except in limited emergency circumstances (such as certain ex parte orders), the respondent is entitled to notice and a hearing before
any order affecting their residence or access to children is issued (Tex. Fam. Code §§ 81.001, 85.001, 262.201; Johnson v. Vernon, 05-24-00179-CV (Tex.
App. Jan 27, 2025)). The hearing provides an opportunity for both parties to present evidence and argument.
Judicial Findings: The court must make specific findings, based on the evidence, regarding the occurrence and likelihood of family violence (Hagner v.
Valdez, 04-23-00379-CV (Tex. App. Mar 26, 2025); Velasquez v. Rayon). These findings are subject to appellate review, ensuring accountability and
adherence to statutory requirements.
Due Process Protections: The requirement for sworn affidavits, testimony, and judicial findings ensures that orders are not issued arbitrarily or without a
factual basis. Even in emergency situations, the statutory framework requires prompt hearings and opportunities for the respondent to contest the allegations
(Tex. Fam. Code § 83.006).
Judicial Interpretation and Consistency
Texas appellate courts have consistently enforced these statutory requirements, vacating or reversing protective orders where the necessary findings were not
made or where due process was not observed (Velasquez v. Rayon; Bell v. State ex rel. S.E.G., 659 S.W.3d 21 (Tex. App. 2021)). The courts have also clarified
that even a single act of violence can constitute a sufficient basis for a finding of family violence, but such a finding must be made by the court after a fair hearing
(In re L.C.L., 396 S.W.3d 712 (Tex. App. 2013)).
In the context of child custody and visitation, the courts have held that credible evidence of family violence creates a rebuttable presumption against unsupervised
visitation, but the court must still make findings and issue orders designed to protect the safety and well-being of the child and any other victims (In re C.A.C.).
Scope and Limitations
The statutory and case law framework applies broadly to cases involving protective orders, exclusion from residence, and child protection in the context of family
violence. The requirement for a court finding of family violence and the provision of a fair forum are not limited to any particular type of relationship or household
arrangement; they apply to all cases falling within the definitions and procedures set out in the Texas Family Code.
Exceptions and Caveats
While the general rule is that a party cannot be removed from their home without a court finding of family violence, there are limited exceptions for emergency
situations:
Temporary Ex Parte Orders: In cases of immediate danger, a court may issue a temporary ex parte order excluding a party from a residence without prior
notice to the respondent (Tex. Fam. Code § 83.006). However, even in these cases, the applicant must provide a sworn affidavit and testify at a hearing, and
the court must make specific findings of recent family violence and a clear and present danger.
Child Protection Emergencies: Similarly, in cases involving the immediate removal of a child or alleged perpetrator, the court may act without prior notice if 
there is an immediate danger to the child's physical health or safety (Tex. Fam. Code § 262.102). Nonetheless, the court must make findings based on the

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
evidence presented, and a full adversary hearing must follow promptly to ensure due process (Tex. Fam. Code § 262.201).
Best Interest of the Child: In custody and visitation matters, the court may restrict or deny access based on findings of family violence, but must also
consider the best interests of the child and issue orders designed to protect all parties (In re C.A.C.).
These exceptions do not undermine the fundamental requirement for judicial findings and procedural fairness; rather, they provide mechanisms for immediate
protection while preserving the respondent's right to a subsequent hearing.
Conclusion
Texas law is unequivocal: a party cannot be removed from their home through a protective order or similar mechanism without a court finding of family violence,
and the statutory framework is designed to ensure that all parties are afforded a fair forum through notice, hearing, and judicial evaluation of evidence. The Texas
Family Code and the appellate courts interpreting it consistently require these procedural and substantive protections, reflecting a careful balance between the
need to protect victims of family violence and the due process rights of all parties involved. Emergency procedures exist for situations of immediate danger, but
even these are subject to strict evidentiary and procedural safeguards. The overarching principle is that removal from the home is a remedy available only after a
fair and thorough judicial process resulting in a finding of family violence.
Legal Authorities
In re Epperson, 213 S.W.3d 541 (Tex. App. 2007)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
A trial court shall render a protective order if the court finds that family violence (1) has occurred and (2) is likely to occur in the future. TEX. FAM.CODE ANN. §
81.001 (Vernon 2002). 'At the close of a hearing on an application for a protective order, the court shall find whether: (1) family violence occurred; and (2) family
violence is likely to occur in the future.' TEX. FAM.CODE ANN. § 85.001(a) (Vernon 2002).
Summary
The Texas Family Code requires a court to find that family violence has occurred and is likely to occur in the future before rendering a protective order. This
implies that a party cannot be removed from their home without such a finding, as protective orders often involve removing a party from a shared residence. The
requirement for a hearing and findings ensures a fair forum for all parties involved.
In re L.C.L., 396 S.W.3d 712 (Tex. App. 2013)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The Texas Family Code provides that 'family violence' means 'an act by a member of a family or household against another member of the family or household
that is intended to result in physical harm, bodily injury, assault, or sexual assault or that is a threat that reasonably places the member in fear of imminent
physical harm, bodily injury, assault, or sexual assault, but does not include defensive measures to protect oneself.' ... A single act of violence or abuse can
constitute a 'history' of physical abuse for purposes of section 153.004 of the Texas Family Code. ... The trial court is required to 'consider the commission of
family violence in determining whether to deny, restrict, or limit the possession of a child by a parent who is appointed as a possessory conservator.'
Summary
The passage defines "family violence" and explains that even a single act can be considered a history of abuse, which is relevant to court decisions regarding
conservatorship and access to children. The court must consider family violence when making decisions about possession and access, indicating that a finding of
family violence is necessary before restricting a party's rights. This supports the proposition that a party cannot be removed from their home or have their rights
restricted without such a finding.

In re C.A.C.
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
§ 156.1045(a). 'It is a rebuttable presumption that it is not in the best interest of a child for a parent to have unsupervised visitation with the child if credible
evidence is presented of a history or pattern' of family violence by that parent. § 153.004(e). Under section 153.004, a trial court 'may not allow' a parent to have
access to a child when it is shown that there is a history of family violence, unless the trial court (1) finds that awarding the parent access to the child would not
endanger the child's physical health or emotional welfare and would be in the best interest of the child and (2) renders a possession order that is designed to
protect the safety and well-being of the child and any other person who has been a victim of family violence committed by the parent. § 153.004(d), (d-1).
Summary
The passage from the Texas Family Code, as referenced in the court decision, establishes that a court must consider a history or pattern of family violence when
making decisions about a parent's access to a child. It sets a rebuttable presumption against unsupervised visitation if credible evidence of family violence is
presented. Furthermore, the court is prohibited from allowing access unless it finds that such access would not endanger the child and is in the child's best
interest, and it must issue orders to protect victims of family violence. This supports the proposition that a court must make specific findings related to family
violence before altering access or possession, ensuring a fair forum for all parties.

removed from their home without such a determination.
Bell v. State ex rel. S.E.G., 659 S.W.3d 21 (Tex. App. 2021)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Appellant's primary issue on appeal is that the trial court erred in granting a protective order when there was not a finding that family violence had occurred in the
past. And indeed, issuance of a protective order depends on two distinct and required findings: the existence of past family violence and the likelihood of future
family violence. This conclusion flows inexorably from the statutory language. In a section titled 'Required Findings and Orders' the trial court is required to make
a finding as to both aspects of family violence. TEX.FAM.CODE ANN. § 85.001(a) ('At the close of a hearing on an application for a protective order, the court
shall find whether: (1) family violence has occurred; and (2) family violence is likely to occur in the future.').
Summary
The passage emphasizes the statutory requirement under Texas law that a court must find both past and likely future family violence before issuing a protective
order. This requirement ensures that a party cannot be removed from their home without a court finding of family violence, aligning with the proposition that the
court must provide a fair forum for all parties involved. The passage directly supports the need for a court finding of family violence before a protective order can
be issued, which can lead to a party being removed from their home.

Tex. Fam. Code § 85.021 Tex. Fam. Code § 85.021 Requirements of Order Applying to Any Party
Extract
In a protective order, the court may: ... grant exclusive possession of a residence to a party and, if appropriate, direct one or more parties to vacate the residence
if the residence: (A) is jointly owned or leased by the party receiving exclusive possession and a party being denied possession; (B) is owned or leased by the
party retaining possession; or (C) is owned or leased by the party being denied possession and that party has an obligation to support the party or a child of the
party granted possession of the residence;
Summary
Conditions under which a court may grant exclusive possession of a residence to one party and direct another party to vacate the residence. This is relevant to
the proposition because it implies that such orders are made within the context of protective orders, which are typically issued in cases involving family violence.
The passage suggests that the court has the authority to make such determinations, indicating that a fair forum is provided for all parties involved, as these
decisions are made through legal proceedings.
Tex. Fam. Code § 83.006 Tex. Fam. Code § 83.006 Exclusion of Party From Residence
Extract
a person may only be excluded from the occupancy of the person's residence by a temporary ex parte order under this chapter if the applicant: files a sworn
affidavit that provides a detailed description of the facts and circumstances requiring the exclusion of the person from the residence; and appears in person to
testify at a temporary ex parte hearing to justify the issuance of the order without notice. ... the court must find from the required affidavit and testimony that: ... the
person to be excluded has within the 30 days before the date the application was filed committed family violence against a member of the household; and there is
a clear and present danger that the person to be excluded is likely to commit family violence against a member of the household.
Summary
A person can only be excluded from their residence through a temporary ex parte order if there is a sworn affidavit and testimony justifying the exclusion due to
family violence. The court must find evidence of family violence and a clear and present danger of future violence. This supports the proposition that a court
finding of family violence is necessary for removal from a home. Additionally, the requirement for a hearing, even if ex parte, provides a forum for the applicant to
present their case, which aligns with the need for a fair forum.

safety, or if the child has been a victim of sexual abuse. This implies that a court finding of family violence or a similar threat is necessary before removal.
Additionally, the requirement for a court order suggests that a fair forum is provided for all parties involved.
Tex. Fam. Code § 81.001 Tex. Fam. Code § 81.001 Entitlement to Protective Order
Extract
A court shall render a protective order as provided by Section FAMILY CODE 85.001(b) if the court finds that family violence has occurred.
Summary
A court is required to issue a protective order only if it finds that family violence has occurred. This implies that a party cannot be removed from their home
through a protective order without such a finding. The requirement for a court finding ensures that there is a fair process in place, as the court must evaluate the
evidence and circumstances before making a decision. This aligns with the proposition that a party cannot be removed from their home without a court finding of
family violence and that the court must provide a fair forum for all parties involved.
Tex. Fam. Code § 262.201 Tex. Fam. Code § 262.201 Full Adversary Hearing; Findings of the Court
Extract
In a suit filed under Section FAMILY CODE 262.101 or FAMILY CODE 262.105, at the conclusion of the full adversary hearing, the court shall order the return of
the child to the parent, managing conservator, possessory conservator, guardian, caretaker, or custodian entitled to possession from whom the child is removed
unless the court finds sufficient evidence to satisfy a person of ordinary prudence and caution that: there was a danger to the physical health or safety of the
child...; the urgent need for protection required the immediate removal of the child...; and reasonable efforts have been made to enable the child to return home,
but there is a substantial risk of a continuing danger if the child is returned home.
Summary
Requirement for a full adversary hearing before a child can be removed from their home, ensuring that the court provides a fair forum for all parties involved. The
court must find sufficient evidence of danger to the child's physical health or safety before ordering removal, which aligns with the proposition that a party cannot
be removed without a court finding of family violence or similar danger. The passage also emphasizes the need for reasonable efforts to enable the child's return
home, further supporting the proposition.
Tex. Fam. Code § 262.102 Tex. Fam. Code § 262.102 Emergency Order Authorizing Possession of Child
Extract
Before a court may, without prior notice and a hearing, issue a temporary order for the conservatorship of a child... the court must find that: there is an immediate
danger to the physical health or safety of the child or the child has been a victim of neglect or sexual abuse; continuation in the home would be contrary to the
child's welfare... If, based on the recommendation of or a request by the Department of Family and Protective Services, the court finds that child abuse or neglect
has occurred and that the child requires protection from family violence by a member of the child's family or household, the court shall render a temporary order
under Title 4 for the protection of the child.
Summary
Conditions under which a court may issue a temporary order for the conservatorship of a child without prior notice and a hearing. It specifies that the court must
find immediate danger to the child's physical health or safety, or that the child has been a victim of neglect or sexual abuse. Additionally, it mentions that if the
court finds that the child requires protection from family violence, a temporary order for protection must be rendered. This supports the proposition that a party
cannot be removed from their home without a court finding of family violence, as the court must make specific findings regarding the child's safety and welfare
before issuing such orders.
