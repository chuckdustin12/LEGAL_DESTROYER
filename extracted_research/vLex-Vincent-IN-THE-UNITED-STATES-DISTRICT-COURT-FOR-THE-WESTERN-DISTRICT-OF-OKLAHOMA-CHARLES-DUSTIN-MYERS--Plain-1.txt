Question
IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT
OF OKLAHOMA CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, Plaintiff, v. DANIEL KENNETH
BRANTHOOVER & MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS Defendants § § § § § Civil
No.: 5:24-cv-01311 § § § § § FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT Plaintiff Charles
Dustin Myers, representing himself pro-se and proceeding in forma pauperis
respectfully files this First Amended Complaint against Daniel Kenneth
Branthoover and Morgan Michelle Myers. The original complaint filed on
December 16, 2024, is respectfully amended to incorporate Morgan
Michelle Myers as an additional defendant and Plaintiff has provided this
Court with the necessary materials to effectuate service prior to the July 11
deadline, as extended by this court pursuant to its’ recent order issued on
June 11, 2025.1 In support of this amended complaint, Plaintiff alleges the
following: 1 See Doc 15. I. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 1. This Honorable
Court possesses subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28
U.S.C. § 1331, as Plaintiff’s claims arise under the laws of the United States,
specifically the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO),
18 U.S.C. § 1964(c) and § 1964(d), which explicitly grants federal courts
jurisdiction over civil RICO actions. Further, jurisdiction is established under
18 U.S.C. § 1965, which provides for nationwide service of process and
jurisdiction in RICO actions, thereby ensuring that all Defendants,
regardless of their physical location within the United States, are subject to
the jurisdiction of this Court. 2. Venue is proper in the United States District
Court for the Western District of Oklahoma pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 1965(a)
and 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b). A substantial part of the events or omissions giving
rise to the claims asserted herein occurred within this District. 3.
Additionally, “any person injured in his business or property by reason of a
violation of section 1962…may sue therefor in any appropriate United States
district court and shall recover threefold the damages he sustains and the
cost of the suit, including a reasonable attorney’s fee…” 18 U.S.C § 1964.
Plaintiff alleges to have a direct and ongoing injury to his business and
property as a result from the alleged predicate acts herein. II. PARTIES A.

heart of this litigation lies a deliberate and orchestrated scheme by
Defendant Morgan Michelle Myers, who, instead of accepting accountability
for her extramarital affair, strategically chose to displace Plaintiff from his
home and destabilize his financial and familial security. Myers meticulously

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
executed a calculated plan involving interstate travel, fraudulent affidavits,
deliberate perjury, asset diversion, and systematic manipulation of multiple
Texas state courts to escape accountability for her actions. 12. To carry out
this scheme, Myers enlisted the assistance of Daniel Kenneth Branthoover, a
resident of Yukon Oklahoma, who has a prior history regarding violations of
protective orders and tampering with government documents. For no other
reason than to escape accountability for her affair, Myers spun an elaborate
web of lies and weaponized her family and court procedures designed to
help victims of abuse. 13.What emerges from the evidence is not a domestic
dispute gone awry, but a textbook criminal enterprise created within this
Court’s Jurisdiction. This is the story of how a person corruptly influenced
the very courts designed to protect families—transforming them into
instruments of fraud, extortion, and systematic theft. It is a tale of how two
individuals, connected by a common goal, orchestrated a seventeen-month
reign of terror that began in Oklahoma and was carried out in the Texas
courts. 14.The Defendants did not merely lie to courts—they constructed an
elaborate criminal enterprise with defined roles, coordinated operations,
and a singular mission: to strip Plaintiff of everything he held dear through
the systematic corruption of judicial proceedings. They did not simply steal
money—they laundered it across state lines while simultaneously preparing
false indigency claims. They did not just fabricate allegations—they
manufactured an entire false narrative of domestic violence, complete with
non-existent protective orders and imaginary threats, all while the supposed
"victim" continued to share a bed with her alleged "abuser." 15.This case
exposes the dark underbelly of how the family court system can be
perverted by those willing to commit federal crimes to achieve their goals. It
reveals how easily the sacred trust placed in sworn affidavits can be
shattered by defendants who view perjury not as a crime, but as a tool. Most
importantly, it demonstrates that when domestic relations become the
vehicle for interstate racketeering, federal intervention is not just
appropriate—it is essential. 16.The evidence will show that Defendants
Myers and Branthoover operated their criminal enterprise with the precision
of seasoned criminals thanks to Branthoover’s history involving protective
order violations and government document tampering. 17.This is not a story
about a marriage that failed. This is simply the product of a litigant who
values her extramarital relationships over morality, and who chose to
weaponize her family against Plaintiff for the sole purpose of escaping
accountability. 18. Through hundreds of hours of research, and through his
zealous advocacy in state courts, Plaintiff now turns to establish that the
Defendants in this matter engaged in the prohibited conduct of an
enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity, and seeks relief to
prevent the enterprise from reaching its’ ultimate goal: finalization. Against
all odds, and in support of this preliminary statement, Plaintiff alleges the
following: IV. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS A. Enterprise Formation and Initial
Criminal Coordination (December 14-15, 2023) 19. Defendant Branthoover
possesses extensive knowledge of protective order procedures and
requirements due to his prior criminal convictions involving violations of
such orders. See Exhibit 1. This knowledge would prove instrumental in the
enterprise's systematic manipulation of protective order proceedings. 20. On
December 14, 2023, immediately following Plaintiff's discovery of Defendant
Myers' extramarital affair, Myers initiated the criminal enterprise by taking
two coordinated actions: first, she opened a private bank account in her sole

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
name to facilitate asset concealment; and second, she commenced intensive
interstate communications with Defendant Branthoover via text messaging.
The scope and intensity of these communications—totaling 92 text messages
exchanged between Branthoover's registered number 940-312-3434 and
Myers' registered number 817-235-5189 on this single day—demonstrates
the deliberate and coordinated nature of their criminal planning. See Exhibit
2. 21. Concurrently with these interstate communications, and without any
legitimate cause or factual basis, Defendant Myers attempted to obtain an
ex-parte protective order against Plaintiff. This attempt, made while actively
coordinating with Branthoover, represents the enterprise's first overt act
designed to manipulate judicial proceedings through false allegations. See
Exhibit 3. 22. In a calculated effort to maintain operational security and
prevent Plaintiff from discovering the criminal scheme, Myers engaged in
deliberate deception that same evening. Despite having just sought
emergency protection from Plaintiff hours earlier, she casually reminded him
of their child's school field trip scheduled for the following day, thereby
creating a facade of normalcy designed to conceal her fraudulent intentions
and prevent suspicion of the enterprise's activities. See Exhibit 4. B.
Interstate Criminal Coordination and Financial Crimes (December 15-16,
2023) 23. On December 15, 2023, at precisely 9:51 A.M. CST, Defendant
Branthoover contacted Plaintiff directly, employing calculated deception by
stating, "I've been where you are before. I want to help both of you." This
communication, referencing Myers' December 1, 2023 divorce
announcement, was designed to establish false pretenses for Myers' planned
interstate travel to Oklahoma for criminal coordination purposes. See
Exhibit 5. 24. During this deceptive phone conversation, Branthoover
established the operational framework for the next phase of the criminal
scheme by arranging for Myers to visit his Oklahoma residence over the
weekend of December 15, 2023. The stated purpose—"providing space" to
Myers—was a deliberate misrepresentation designed to conceal the true
criminal purpose of coordinating fraudulent document preparation and
enterprise operations. 25. The effectiveness of this deception is evidenced
by Plaintiff's complete lack of knowledge regarding the previous day's ex-
parte protective order attempt. Having no reason to suspect Branthoover's
dishonest intentions, Plaintiff unwittingly facilitated the enterprise's criminal
coordination by agreeing to Myers' travel to Oklahoma. 26. Immediately
following Branthoover's deceptive phone call, the enterprise executed its
first major financial crime. Plaintiff received notification that Myers had
transferred $1,576 from the parties' joint marital PNC account to
Branthoover's PayPal account (username "dmb575"), completely depleting
the account balance. This interstate wire transfer represents a critical
predicate act, utilizing interstate commerce to further the criminal scheme
while simultaneously depriving Plaintiff of operating funds necessary for his
legitimate business operations. 27. The immediate and devastating impact of
this financial crime became apparent on December 16, 2023, when Plaintiff
received notification that the joint marital PNC account was overdrawn by
$800.00. Concurrently, Plaintiff discovered that advertisements for his
legitimate home-based business had ceased running due to payment failure
directly caused by the enterprise's theft of operating funds. This
demonstrates the enterprise's deliberate intent to cause maximum financial
harm to Plaintiff. 28. The criminal nature of this financial transaction is
conclusively established by documentary evidence. The PNC bank statement

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
for December 2023 provides irrefutable proof of the unauthorized
withdrawal, documenting the precise date, amount, and destination of the
fraudulent transfer. 29. The direct connection between Defendant
Branthoover and this financial crime is established through multiple forms
of evidence. The PayPal identifier "dmb575" appearing on Plaintiff's bank
statement directly corresponds to Branthoover's PayPal account, creating an
unbreakable evidentiary chain linking him to the illicit financial transaction,
corroborated by his own admissions in subsequent text communications. 30.
On December 16, 2023, at precisely 3:54 P.M. CST, Plaintiff made a good-
faith attempt to resolve the situation amicably by sending a detailed text
message to Defendant Branthoover. This communication explicitly requested
the return of the fraudulently transferred $1,576, detailed the intended
legitimate use of these funds, described the financial hardship caused by the
theft (including late bills and business disruption), explained Plaintiff's
inability to work due to the severe emotional distress caused by Defendants'
criminal actions, and expressed his sincere desire for an amicable resolution
during the holiday season. 31. Defendant Branthoover's response to this
reasonable request revealed the true criminal nature of the enterprise. In a
callous and dismissive reply, Branthoover stated, "You Are Getting
Divorced..." followed by, "I hope I can help with the paperwork and make
things go as smoothly as possible." Far from the helpful assistance initially
promised, this communication constituted a direct threat and overt act in
furtherance of the criminal conspiracy, demonstrating Branthoover's intent
to exploit Plaintiff's financial distress for the enterprise's benefit while
utilizing interstate communications to further the scheme. 32. This
communication also establishes Branthoover's unauthorized practice of law
across state lines. At no time relevant to this litigation has Defendant
Branthoover possessed a license to practice law in any jurisdiction within
the United States. His statements regarding "paperwork" and making legal
proceedings "go as smoothly as possible" constitute clear evidence of
unauthorized legal practice and demonstrate his administrative role in
directing the enterprise's criminal activities. C. Coordinated Eviction Fraud
and Interstate Document Transportation (December 17, 2023) 33. On
December 17, 2023, at approximately 11:00 A.M., Plaintiff was served with
an eviction notice by the grandmother of Myers, who is also the landlord of
the matrimonial residence, which contained the following false information:
i. A purported “lease violation,” which was entirely fabricated as no valid
lease agreement existed between Plaintiff and Wilson; ii. The assertion that
“Granddaughter getting divorced,” referring to Defendant Myers, as a basis
for eviction; iii. The false claim that a “Protective order has been filed.” iv.
The directive that “He must leave. She and the girls may stay,”
demonstrating the clear intent to dispossess Plaintiff for the benefit of
Myers. 34. The coordinated and premeditated nature of this eviction fraud is
established by the timing of its execution. At the precise moment this
fraudulent notice was being served in Texas, Defendant Myers was
physically present in Oklahoma with Defendant Branthoover, actively
collaborating in the preparation of the very fraudulent court documents
referenced in the eviction notice. This simultaneous coordination across
state lines demonstrates the sophisticated and deliberate nature of the
criminal enterprise's operations. 35. Myers' knowledge of the fraudulent
nature of these proceedings is conclusively established. She possessed
actual knowledge that no valid lease agreement existed between Plaintiff

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
and the landlord, and she had actual knowledge that neither divorce
proceedings nor protective orders had been filed at the time of service,
making her participation in the eviction fraud a knowing and willful criminal
act. 36. On December 17, 2023, Defendant Myers completed the interstate
transportation phase of the criminal scheme by transporting the fraudulent
court documents prepared in Oklahoma back across state lines to Texas.
These documents, including the Original Petition for Divorce and Affidavit of
Indigency, were specifically prepared with the intent of submitting them to
Texas state courts to further the enterprise's fraudulent manipulation of
judicial proceedings. 37. Upon her return to Texas, Myers demonstrated her
control over the eviction fraud by personally destroying the fraudulent
eviction notice. She physically tore the notice in half and wrote "VOID" on it
in black marker, providing clear evidence of her influence over and
coordination of the fraudulent eviction attempt orchestrated during her
absence in Oklahoma. D. Operational Security and Document Preparation
(December 17-18, 2023) 38. As part of the enterprise's operational security
measures, Defendant Myers returned from Oklahoma equipped with a
canister of pepper spray, designed to support the false narrative of domestic
violence that would be central to the fraudulent court documents prepared
during her Oklahoma visit. 39. During her Oklahoma visit, Defendant Myers
acquired a secondary phone number (817-940-0852) as a deliberate
operational security measure. This acquisition, which she explicitly disclosed
to Plaintiff, constituted an overt act in furtherance of the criminal
enterprise, designed to facilitate clandestine communications related to the
fraudulent scheme while concealing the enterprise's ongoing criminal
coordination from detection. 40. This newly acquired secondary phone
number became an integral component of the fraudulent court documents
prepared under Defendant Branthoover's direct administrative oversight.
The systematic use of this number across multiple fraudulent legal
documents demonstrates the coordinated nature of the enterprise's
document preparation activities. These documents, prepared in Oklahoma
with the specific intent of unlawfully influencing Texas legal proceedings,
included: i. An "Original Petition for Divorce" dated December 18, 2023,
containing numerous material false statements designed to deceive the
Texas courts; ii. An "Affidavit of Indigency" dated December 18, 2023,
containing deliberate misrepresentations regarding Myers' financial status
to defraud the court of legitimate filing fees; iii. A "Request for Uncontested
Cases" dated December 18, 2023, fraudulently filed despite the complete
absence of any communication between the parties regarding divorce
proceedings; iv. An "Application for Protective Order" dated December 22,
2023, containing entirely fabricated allegations of family violence. E.
Unauthorized Practice of Law and Intimidation (December 18, 2023) 42. 41.
Following the filing of the initial fraudulent divorce documents on December
18, 2023, Defendant Branthoover escalated his unauthorized practice of law
by sending Plaintiff a text message asserting legal representation and
attempting to control all future communications. The message stated:
“Charlie, it’s come to my understanding you have retained an attorney. I’m
sure he has told you that all further communication should take place
between attorneys. I must formally ask you refrain from discussing details of
this case with my client moving forward and only communicate with me or
your attorney.” This communication was a deliberate attempt to isolate
Plaintiff from direct communication with Myers and to control the flow of

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
information, thereby hindering Plaintiff’s ability to uncover the full extent of
the fraudulent scheme. This communication also evidences that
Branthoover’s role went beyond helping Myers prepare the documents by
seeing them through to their submission and asserting an administrative
role over the proceedings to intimidate Plaintiff. F. Service Through Official
Channels and Continued Deception (December 22-28, 2023) 42. In
furtherance of the criminal scheme, and despite continuing to cohabitate
with Plaintiff in the marital residence, Defendant Myers deliberately utilized
official constable service to effectuate service of the fraudulent divorce
petition and protective order application, which occurred on December 27,
2023. This calculated use of official legal processes to serve fraudulent
documents while maintaining the deceptive facade of normalcy at home
demonstrates the sophisticated and deliberate nature of the enterprise's
operations. 43. The enterprise's manipulation of official legal processes
continued when Myers, despite residing next door to Plaintiff, deliberately
influenced and coordinated the constable service of the fraudulent eviction
documents, which occurred on December 28, 2023. This systematic abuse of
official legal processes while maintaining physical proximity and continued
cohabitation reveals the calculated and deceptive nature of the enterprise's
operations. G. Systematic False Statements in Sworn Court Documents
(December 18, 2023) 44. When reviewing the documents prepared in part
by Branthoover and filed with the court by Myers, there existed several false
statements and were intended to deceive the court and prejudice Plaintiff in
furtherance of the scheme to dispose him of his property interests.
Specifically, these false statements included, but were not limited to: i. The
assertion that the spouses had ceased living together on December 1, 2023,
when in fact they were still residing together at the marital home on that
date and for several weeks thereafter. ii. The claim that Defendant Myers
owned both family vehicles as her separate property prior to the marriage,
which was demonstrably false as these vehicles were acquired during the
marriage and constituted community property, paid for by Plaintiff. iii. The
representation that Defendant Myers had an active order of protection
against Plaintiff with a judicial finding that family violence had occurred
during the marriage, which was fabricated and without any basis in fact or
law. iv. The assertion that the children or Defendant Myers would be
subjected to harassment or abuse if Plaintiff were provided with her second
phone number (817-940-0852) acquired in Oklahoma, which was a baseless
and manipulative claim designed to conceal her communications related to
the fraudulent scheme. 45. Concurrently with the fraudulent divorce
petition, Defendant Myers, again with the administrative oversight and full
knowledge of Defendant Branthoover, filed a fraudulent “Affidavit of
Indigency” with the court. This affidavit contained material
misrepresentations regarding Defendant Myers’ financial status, all of which
were known to be false at the time of filing and were intended to defraud the
court and avoid legitimate court costs. Specifically, these false statements
included: i. The claim that Defendant Myers was financially indigent and
unable to pay court costs, despite her access to and control over substantial
marital assets. ii. The representation that Defendant Myers was solely
responsible for all family living expenses, including rent, utilities, food, and
other living expenses, when in fact, Plaintiff was the primary breadwinner of
the household at that time. iii. The assertion that Defendant Myers was
solely responsible for both car payments, which she has no payment history

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
to support such a claim. H. Escalation Through Fabricated Violence
Allegations (December 22, 2023) 46. On December 22, 2023, despite having
claimed in her divorce petition to already possess an active protective order,
Myers filed an "Application for Protective Order," revealing the
contradictory and fabricated nature of her previous representations while
escalating the enterprise's fraudulent manipulation of judicial proceedings.
47. Upon review, defendant Myers made additional false statements within
the sworn document, all intended to further deceive the court and secure an
unwarranted protective order against Plaintiff to effectuate the enterprises’
goal of divesting him of his property interests. These false statements
included, but were not limited to: i. The claim that family violence occurred
on December 18, 2023, in the presence of the children, which was entirely
false and fabricated. ii. The assertion that family violence occurred prior to
December 18, 2023, which was also false and without any factual basis. iii.
The request that Plaintiff take a battering intervention program. I.
Achievement of Primary Criminal Objective (January 16, 2024) 48. The
enterprise's coordinated criminal activities achieved their primary objective
through the systematic deception of the Texas court system. The common
purpose underlying all fraudulent documents and criminal acts—executed
through Branthoover's administrative coordination and Myers' on-ground
implementation—encompassed multiple interconnected goals: unlawfully
removing Plaintiff from his residence (essential for his livelihood and the
family's financial stability), gaining an illicit advantage in divorce
proceedings through fraudulent representations, and ultimately securing a
divorce decree on terms unilaterally favorable to Myers, thereby making the
unlawful deprivation of Plaintiff's rights and property permanent while
enabling the enterprise to escape accountability for their criminal conduct.
49. On January 16, 2024, the enterprise's criminal scheme achieved its
primary objective when Plaintiff appeared before the 322nd District Court of
Tarrant County and was ordered to vacate the family residence.
Significantly, this order was entered without any evidentiary hearing and
without judicial findings regarding the allegations contained in the
fraudulent documents, demonstrating that the court's decision was based
entirely on the false information systematically presented by the enterprise.
50. The causal relationship between the enterprise's fraudulent
representations and this judicial outcome is conclusively established. The
misinformation presented to the court through the coordinated fraudulent
documents was the sole basis for the court's decision, providing Myers with
the exact advantage that she and Branthoover had anticipated and planned
through their criminal coordination. J. Ongoing Pattern of Racketeering
Activity and Continuity (January 2024 - Present) 51. Between January 16,
2024, and the present day, Defendants Myers and Branthoover have
continued to further their racketeering activity through a series of ongoing
illicit acts, demonstrating a clear pattern of continuity and relatedness.
These acts include, but are not limited to: i. Myers and Branthoover
continuing to engage in illicit communications regarding case details
between one another across state lines, specifically between Texas and
Oklahoma, in direct furtherance of their fraudulent scheme to see the
divorce through to its’ finalization. ii. Branthoover delivering ongoing
threats and intimidation to Plaintiff regarding his legitimate attempts to
seek legal relief from the orders that were a product of the Defendants’
actions, which occurred in December of 2023, June of 2024, December of

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
2024, and May of 2025. iii. Making direct statements such as “I’ve been
enjoying watching every filing get denied” by Branthoover, showing the
malicious intent behind his involvement as Plaintiff sought relief for their
coordinated actions. 52. On June 23, 2024, Defendant Branthoover
continued his pattern of harassment and intimidation by sending Plaintiff a
text message stating, "Lol. And here comes another denial," in direct
reference to Plaintiff's court filing seeking to enjoin Branthoover as a party
to the divorce proceedings. This communication provides conclusive
evidence of Branthoover's continued awareness of and active involvement in
the Texas legal proceedings, his ongoing monitoring of court filings, and his
malicious intent to mock and intimidate Plaintiff's efforts to seek justice
through legitimate legal channels. 53. On December 12, 2024, Branthoover
escalated his threatening communications by sending Plaintiff a message
stating, "When things all over you get to deal with me. Just a heads up,"
demonstrating the enterprise's ongoing criminal intent and explicit threats
of future retaliation against Plaintiff for his efforts to expose and seek relief
from their criminal activities. 54. Most recently, on May 24, 2025,
Branthoover sent Plaintiff a message stating, "Where's my lawsuit? Heard
your vm about me. File it. Let's do this :)" This communication demonstrates
the enterprise's continued operation, Branthoover's ongoing monitoring of
Plaintiff's activities, and his explicit challenge and threat regarding potential
legal action, providing clear evidence of the enterprise's ongoing criminal
intent and the continuing threat posed to Plaintiff. 55. As a direct result of
the actions outlined above, Plaintiff has sustained substantial injury to his
business and property. V. RICO FRAMEWORK AND PREDICATE ACTS 56.
Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations contained in
paragraphs 1 through 55 above, as if fully set forth herein. 57. The
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) provides civil
and criminal penalties for those who engage in a pattern of racketeering
activity connected to an enterprise affecting interstate commerce. Under 18
U.S.C. § 1961, "racketeering activity" encompasses a broad range of criminal
actions including "any act which is indictable under any of the following
provisions of title 18, United States Code: ... section 1952 (relating to
racketeering)." 58. To establish a RICO violation, a plaintiff must
demonstrate: "(1) a person who engages in (2) a pattern of racketeering
activity, (3) connected to the acquisition, establishment, conduct, or control
of an enterprise." Gil Ramirez Grp., L.L.C. v. Houston Indep. Sch. Dist.,
CIVIL ACTION 4:10-CV-04872 (S.D. Tex. Jul 31, 2017). The pattern of
racketeering activity must include at least two predicate acts that are
related and amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity. 59.
Here, Defendants are alleged to have committed several predicate acts
including multiple counts of wire fraud, violations of the Travelers Act, and
perjury as part of a broader pattern of racketeering activity. 60. As explained
in more detail below, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations
Act (RICO) requires a “pattern of racketeering activity”, which Plaintiff will
plead with particularity the predicate acts committed by the Defendants,
how they are related, and demonstrate continuity as required. V.
INTRODUCTION TO RICO 61. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by
reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 60 above, as if
fully set forth herein. 62. The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act (RICO) requires proof of a "pattern of racketeering
activity," which the Supreme Court has consistently held consists of two

=== PAGE 9 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
essential elements: relatedness and continuity of predicate acts. Based on
the provided facts and the applicable law, the Defendants' series of related
acts spanning from December 2023 through May 2025 (approximately 18
months) satisfies both the relatedness requirement (as the acts share similar
purposes, participants, and methods) and the continuity requirement (as
they extend over a substantial period of time) necessary to establish a
pattern of racketeering activity under RICO. 63. The defendants' conduct
falls squarely within the 10th Circuit's interpretation of RICO's pattern
requirement. The predicate acts of wire fraud, interstate travel, perjury,
threats, and intimidation are all enumerated as "racketeering activities"
under 18 U.S.C. § 1961, and they were committed in furtherance of the same
criminal enterprise. This ongoing criminal activity over an extended period
demonstrates "closed-ended continuity" as recognized by the Supreme Court
and followed by federal courts nationwide, including the 10th Circuit. The
defendants' pattern of racketeering activity clearly satisfies the statutory
definition and judicial interpretations of what constitutes a RICO violation.
A. Statutory Framework 64. The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act (RICO) provides the statutory framework for prosecuting
organized criminal activities. The statute defines key terms and establishes
the elements required to prove a RICO violation. 65. Under 18 U.S.C. § 1962,
it is unlawful for "any person through a pattern of racketeering activity or
through collection of an unlawful debt to acquire or maintain, directly or
indirectly, any interest in or control of any enterprise which is engaged in, or
the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce." 18 U.S.C. §
1962 (2025). 66. The term "racketeering activity" is defined in 18 U.S.C. §
1961 to include specific enumerated offenses, including "any act which is
indictable under any of the following provisions of title 18, United States
Code: ... section 1343 (relating to wire fraud), ... section 1512 (relating to
tampering with a witness, victim, or an informant), section 1513 (relating to
retaliating against a witness, victim, or an informant)." 18 U.S.C. § 1961
(2025). 67. Crucially, the statute defines a "pattern of racketeering activity"
as requiring "at least two acts of racketeering activity, one of which
occurred after the effective date of this chapter and the last of which
occurred within ten years (excluding any period of imprisonment) after the
commission of a prior act of racketeering activity." 18 U.S.C. § 1961 (2025).
68. Additionally, 18 U.S.C. § 1952 establishes penalties for interstate or
foreign travel in aid of racketeering enterprises, which is relevant to the
defendants' interstate travel in this case. 18 U.S.C. § 1952 (2025). B.
Supreme Court Interpretation of RICO's "Pattern" Requirement 69. While
the statutory definition of "pattern of racketeering activity" requires at least
two predicate acts within a ten-year period, the Supreme Court has clarified
that merely proving two predicate acts is not sufficient to establish a pattern
under RICO. In the landmark case of H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co.,
492 U.S. 229 (1989), the Supreme Court established that a RICO pattern
requires both "relatedness" and "continuity" of the predicate acts. 70. This
interpretation has been consistently referenced and applied in subsequent
cases. As explained in Ellis v. Warner, CASE NO. 15-10134-CIV-GOODMAN
(S.D. Fla. Feb 16, 2017), "To establish a pattern of racketeering activity, 'a
plaintiff... must show that the racketeering predicates are related, and that
they amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity.' H.J. Inc. v.
Nw. Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 239, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989).
The pattern requirement has been reduced to a 'continuity plus relationship'

test." 71. The "continuity plus relationship" test has become the standard
framework for analyzing whether a pattern of racketeering activity exists
under RICO. This test requires proving both that the predicate acts are
related to each other and that they demonstrate continuity or a threat of
continuity. C. Relatedness Requirement 72. The relatedness element focuses
on whether the predicate acts are connected to each other and to a common
purpose. As articulated in Chambers v. King Buick GMC, LLC, 43 F. Supp. 3d
575 (D. Md. 2014), "The relationship criterion may be satisfied by showing
that the criminal acts 'have the same or similar purposes, victims, or
methods of commission, or are otherwise interrelated by distinguishing
characteristics and are not isolated events.'" 73. Similarly, Gross v. Waywell,
628 F.Supp.2d 475 (S.D. N.Y. 2009) explains that "The relatedness test
requires that the predicate acts relied upon 'share the same or similar
purposes, results, participants, victims or methods, or otherwise are
interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not isolated events.'
H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 240, 109 S.Ct. 2893." The relatedness element ensures
that RICO is applied to organized criminal activity rather than disconnected,
sporadic offenses. D. Continuity Requirement 74. The continuity element can
be established through either "closed-ended continuity" or "open-ended
continuity." As stated in Murphy v. Farmer, 176 F.Supp.3d 1325 (N.D. Ga.
2016), "Continuity may be established in one of two ways. A plaintiff may
prove closed-ended continuity by showing 'a closed period of repeated
conduct,' or the plaintiff may prove open-ended continuity by showing 'past
conduct that by its nature projects into the future with a threat of
repetition.'" 75. Closed-ended continuity involves a series of related
predicate acts over a substantial period of time. As noted in Reynolds v.
Condon, 908 F.Supp. 1494 (N.D. W.Va. 1996), "A party alleging a RICO
violation may demonstrate continuity over a closed period by proving a
series of related predicates extending over a substantial period of time." 76.
Open-ended continuity, on the other hand, involves a threat of continued
criminal activity into the future. According to WATER INTERN. NETWORK,
USA, INC. v. East, 892 F. Supp. 1477 (M.D. Fla. 1995), continuity
encompasses both "a close-ended and open-ended concept. A party alleging
a RICO violation may demonstrate continuity over a closed period by
proving a series of related predicate acts over a substantial period of time.
Otherwise, it must be shown that the predicate acts establish a threat of
long-term racketeering activity." The continuity requirement ensures that
RICO is applied to ongoing patterns of criminal activity rather than isolated
incidents. E. Defendants' Conduct as Predicate Acts Under RICO 77. The
Defendants' conduct, as outlined above, includes wire fraud, interstate
travel, perjury, threats, and intimidation from December 2023 through May
2025, all in furtherance of the same criminal enterprise with a common
purpose. To determine whether this conduct constitutes a pattern of
racketeering activity under RICO, it must be analyzed whether these acts
qualify as predicate acts and whether they demonstrate both relatedness
and continuity. 78. First, Plaintiff needs to establish whether the defendants'
acts qualify as "racketeering activity" under 18 U.S.C. § 1961. According to
this statute, "racketeering activity" includes "any act which is indictable
under any of the following provisions of title 18, United States Code: ...
section 1343 (relating to wire fraud), ... section 1512 (relating to tampering
with a witness, victim, or an informant), section 1513 (relating to retaliating
against a witness, victim, or an informant)." 18 U.S.C. § 1961 (2025). VI.

PREDICATE ACT – WIRE FRAUD 79. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by
reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 74 above, as if
fully set forth herein. 80. The facts establish all three elements of wire fraud
under 18 U.S.C. § 1343—a scheme to defraud, use of interstate wire
communications, and intent to deprive another of money or property—
qualifying it as a RICO predicate act under 18 U.S.C. § 1961. 81. The
relevant federal statutes in this analysis are 18 U.S.C. § 1343 (Wire Fraud)
and 18 U.S.C. § 1961 (RICO Definitions). 82. Title 18 U.S.C. § 1343 states:
"Whoever, having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to
defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent
pretenses, representations, or promises, transmits or causes to be
transmitted by means of wire, radio, or television communication in
interstate or foreign commerce, any writings, signs, signals, pictures, or
sounds for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice, shall be fined
under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both." 83. Title 18
U.S.C. § 1961 defines "racketeering activity" to include "any act which is
indictable under any of the following provisions of title 18, United States
Code:... section 1343 (relating to wire fraud)...". This statutory provision
explicitly establishes wire fraud as a predicate act for RICO violations. A.
Scheme to Defraud 84. The first element of wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. §
1343 is the existence of "a scheme to defraud." As noted in United States v.
Greenberg, 835 F.3d 295 (2nd Cir. 2016), this constitutes an "essential
element" of the crime. In the present case, Myers transferred $1,576 from a
joint marital PNC account to Branthoover's PayPal account, depleting the
account entirely. This transfer was not an isolated action but was
accompanied by "a series of coordinated text messages and phone calls"
between Myers and Branthoover regarding the scheme. 85. The
coordination between the parties through multiple communications channels
demonstrates a deliberate plan rather than a spontaneous or inadvertent
action. As articulated in Mail and Wire Fraud, a "scheme to defraud requires
a material falsehood, material misrepresentation, or the concealment of a
material fact." By transferring funds from a joint marital account without
apparent authorization from the joint account holder, Myers engaged in
conduct that reflects the concealment of material facts regarding the
disposition of marital assets. 86. The scheme in this case specifically
targeted marital funds, which are legally considered shared property
between spouses. By depleting the account, Myers intentionally deprived the
Plaintiff of access to funds to which they were legally entitled. This satisfies
the requirement that the scheme have "money or property as the object of
the scheme" as stated in Smulley v. Fed. Hous. Fin. Agency, 17-2666 (2nd
Cir. Oct 05, 2018). B. Use of Interstate Wire Communications 87. The second
element of wire fraud requires the "use of the mails or wires to further the
scheme." United States v. Greenberg, 835 F.3d 295 (2nd Cir. 2016). The
facts demonstrate that Myers used interstate wire communications in two
distinct ways: i. The transfer of $1,576 was "executed via interstate wire
(bank to PayPal)," which constitutes an electronic transmission across state
lines. ii. The transfer "was accompanied by a series of coordinated text
messages and phone calls between Myers (in Texas) and Branthoover (in
Oklahoma) regarding the scheme." 88. Wire transmissions include interstate
telephone calls or electronic transmissions. Furthermore, internet
communications satisfy the interstate nexus requirement, even in the
absence of proof that a fraudulent communication traveled through out-of-

=== PAGE 12 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
state servers. 89. The interstate nature of these communications is
established by the fact that Myers was in Texas while Branthoover was in
Oklahoma during their communications about the scheme. This satisfies the
jurisdictional requirement that the wire communication cross state lines. 90.
Importantly, each of these communications—the bank transfer, text
messages, and phone calls—constitutes a separate use of interstate wire
communications. As noted in Mail and Wire Fraud: "Each use of the mail or
wires constitutes a separate offense and therefore can be a separate count
in an indictment." C. Intend to Defraud 91. The third element requires that
the defendant acted "with the intent to defraud." As stated in U.S. v.
Blackmon, 839 F.2d 900 (2nd Cir. 1988), the wire fraud statute requires that
the defendant "be a party to some kind of scheme to defraud, a requirement
that includes a high degree of scienter and moral culpability." 92. The facts
indicate that Myers and Branthoover engaged in "a series of coordinated
text messages and phone calls... regarding the scheme." This coordination
demonstrates premeditation and planning, which supports a finding of intent
to defraud. The fact that the transfer depleted the joint account entirely
further suggests an intent to maximize the financial impact on the Plaintiff,
depriving them of access to any funds from that account. 93. According to
Theft offenses, wire fraud requires "that the defendant voluntarily and
intentionally devised or participated in a scheme to defraud another out of
money." The coordination between Myers and Branthoover through multiple
communications channels demonstrates voluntary and intentional
participation in the scheme. 94. Furthermore, Branthoover specifically
stated that he wanted to help Plaintiff, which he knew was not a true
statement at the time. The fact that text and phone communications were
used to deceive Plaintiff into believing that Myers’ interstate travel would be
beneficial for him further supports a scheme to defraud, because the
transfer of funds occurred after this false extension of help from
Branthoover. D. Potential Defenses 95. One potential defense might be that
Myers, as a joint account holder, had legal authority to transfer funds from
the account. However, this authority does not necessarily extend to
depleting the account for personal gain or in coordination with a third party
with the intent to deprive the other account holder of their rightful access to
the funds. The joint nature of the account creates a fiduciary duty to act in
good faith regarding the shared asset. That fiduciary duty was willingly
violated when Myers chose to transfer the funds to Branthoover’s PayPal,
and then later to herself. The appropriate method would have been for
Myers to transfer the funds directly to herself, but she avoided this to
conceal her bank account information in furtherance of a broader scheme.
96. The evidence supporting these elements includes the interstate transfer
of funds, the coordination of the scheme through interstate communications,
and the depletion of the joint account to the detriment of the Plaintiff. Each
use of interstate wire communications—the bank transfer, text messages,
and phone calls—constitutes a separate instance of wire fraud. 97. In
summary, the facts presented establish all required elements of wire fraud
under 18 U.S.C. § 1343, qualifying it as a predicate act for RICO purposes
under 18 U.S.C. § 1961. VII. PREDICATE ACT – VIOLATION OF THE TRAVEL
ACT 98. The Travel Act, codified at 18 U.S.C. § 1952, is a federal statute that
criminalizes interstate travel undertaken with the intent to promote or carry
on certain unlawful activities. According to the statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1952
states: "Whoever travels in interstate or foreign commerce or uses the mail

=== PAGE 13 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
or any facility in interstate or foreign commerce, with intent to- ... otherwise
promote, manage, establish, carry on, or facilitate the promotion,
management, establishment, or carrying on, of any unlawful activity, and
thereafter performs or attempts to perform- ... an act described in
paragraph or shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 5
years, or both; ..." The statute is designed to target individuals who cross
state lines with the intent to engage in or facilitate criminal activity. It was
enacted as part of the federal government's efforts to combat organized
crime by reaching criminal activities that might otherwise fall outside
federal jurisdiction due to their local nature. By utilizing Congress's power
to regulate interstate commerce, the Travel Act extends federal jurisdiction
to criminal enterprises that operate across state lines. A. Elements of a
Travel Act Violation 99. As set forth by the act's plain language, the
elements necessary to sustain a Travel Act conviction are (1) travel in
interstate or foreign commerce or use of the mail or any facility in interstate
or foreign commerce, (2) with the intent to promote, manage, establish,
carry on, or facilitate the promotion, management, establishment, or
carrying on, of any unlawful activity, and (3) performance of or an attempt to
perform an act of promotion, management, establishment, or carrying on of
the enumerated unlawful activity. 100. Each of these elements must be
proven beyond a reasonable doubt to establish a Travel Act violation: i.
Interstate Travel or Use of Interstate Facilities: The defendant must have
either traveled across state lines or used facilities of interstate commerce
(such as telephones, electronic communications, or mail). ii. Intent to
Promote Unlawful Activity: The defendant must have undertaken this
interstate travel or used interstate facilities with the specific intent to
promote, manage, establish, carry on, or facilitate one of the unlawful
activities enumerated in the statute. These unlawful activities include
various state and federal crimes such as gambling, liquor offenses,
narcotics, prostitution, extortion, bribery, arson, and importantly for this
case, fraud. iii. Subsequent Acts: After the interstate travel or use of
interstate facilities, the defendant must have performed or attempted to
perform acts that promote, manage, establish, or carry on the unlawful
activity. B. Interstate Travel 101. The first element of a Travel Act violation
requires travel in interstate commerce or the use of facilities in interstate
commerce. According to the facts provided, Myers traveled from Texas to
Oklahoma on December 15, 2023, and then transported the fraudulent
documents back to Texas on December 17, 2023. This clearly establishes
interstate travel, as Myers physically crossed state lines from Texas to
Oklahoma and then returned to Texas. The interstate commerce
requirement is therefore satisfied. C. Intent to Promote Unlawful Activity
102. The second element requires that the interstate travel was undertaken
with the intent to promote, manage, establish, carry on, or facilitate an
unlawful activity. Here, the facts state that Myers traveled to Oklahoma "for
the purpose of preparing fraudulent court documents and coordinating the
criminal scheme." 103. Fraud is specifically encompassed within the
"unlawful activity" contemplated by the Travel Act, as 18 U.S.C. § 1952
prohibits interstate travel with the intent to promote "any unlawful activity,
including fraud or extortion." The explicit purpose of Myers' travel—to
prepare fraudulent court documents—demonstrates her intent to promote
and facilitate fraud, which is an unlawful activity under the statute. 104. The
intent requirement is clearly satisfied, as the purpose of Myers' interstate

=== PAGE 14 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
travel was explicitly to prepare fraudulent documents with the assistance of
Branthoover—a direct promotion of fraudulent activity. This is not a case
where the connection between the travel and the unlawful activity is
tenuous or where the unlawful activity was merely incidental to the travel.
Rather, the preparation of fraudulent court documents was the very reason
for the interstate journey. D. Subsequent Acts in Furtherance of the
Unlawful Activity 105. The third element requires that, following the
interstate travel, the defendant performed or attempted to perform acts to
promote, manage, establish, or carry on the unlawful activity. In this case,
after returning to Texas, Myers "transported the fraudulent documents back
to Texas for use in judicial proceedings" and there were "subsequent acts
(filing and using those documents)." 106. These actions—transporting the
fraudulent documents across state lines, filing them, and using them in
judicial proceedings—constitute clear performance of acts in furtherance of
the fraudulent scheme. The fraudulent documents were not merely prepared
and then abandoned; rather, they were actively transported and
subsequently used in judicial proceedings, demonstrating Myers' continued
efforts to carry out the fraudulent scheme after her interstate travel, which
Branthoover also participated in. 107. The sequence of events—interstate
travel followed by acts in furtherance of fraud—aligns perfectly with the
structure of the Travel Act, which prohibits interstate travel with criminal
intent followed by actions that further the criminal activity. E. Potential
Defenses 108. Defendants may argue that the intent element has not been
properly satisfied, however, texts later sent by Branthoover to Plaintiff
clearly demonstrate a malicious intent. For example, the text sent on June
2023 which stated “I’ve enjoyed watching every filing get denied” defeats
this argument. 109. Defendants might also attempt to argue that the acts
performed after interstate travel were insufficient to satisfy the "subsequent
acts" requirement. However, given that Myers not only transported the
fraudulent documents back to Texas but also used them in judicial
proceedings, this element appears to be clearly satisfied. The filing and use
of the documents in judicial proceedings constitute direct acts in
furtherance of the fraudulent scheme. As far as Branthoover, his role in the
enterprise extended beyond the mere assistance of preparing the fraudulent
documents. After they were filed, he continued to hold himself out to be an
administrative agent of Myers, and send numerous threatening texts
throughout the past seventeen months. 110. In summary, given that Myers'
conduct establishes a clear Travel Act violation, this violation can properly
serve as a predicate act for purposes of establishing a pattern of
racketeering activity under RICO. The deliberate nature of her actions—
traveling interstate specifically to prepare fraudulent court documents—and
the subsequent use of those documents in judicial proceedings demonstrate
a level of planning and execution that aligns with the types of criminal
activity that both the Travel Act and RICO were designed to combat. VIII.
PREDICATE ACT – PERJURY 111. It’s important to note that the Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) does not explicitly list
perjury as a predicate act under 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1). However, courts have
recognized that perjury can serve as a RICO predicate when it is part of a
broader pattern of racketeering activity, particularly when connected to
fraud schemes that qualify as RICO predicates. A. Authority on Perjury as a
Predicate Act 112. The case of United States v. Eisen, 974 F.2d 246 (2d Cir.
1992) addressed this issue directly, stating that "where, as here, a

=== PAGE 15 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
fraudulent scheme falls within the scope of the federal mail fraud statute
and the other elements of RICO are established, use of the mail fraud
offense as a RICO predicate act cannot be suspended simply because perjury
is part of the means for perpetrating the fraud." This means that while
perjury alone might not be a RICO predicate, when it is part of a broader
fraudulent scheme that qualifies as a RICO predicate (such as mail fraud or
wire fraud), the perjurious acts can be included in the RICO violation. 113.
Similarly, ASI, Inc. v. Aquawood, LLC, Civil No. 19-763 (JRT/HB) (D. Minn.
Oct 05, 2020) confirms that "although perjury alone is not a predicate act
under RICO, courts have found that false litigation documents can support a
mail/wire fraud RICO claim." The court further found that "submission of
false litigation documents, in conjunction with a broader RICO scheme, can
be a predicate act." In this case, that is exactly the conduct at issue. 114.
More explicitly, C & W Constr. Co. v. Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners,
Local 745, 687 F.Supp. 1453 (D.Haw.1988) stated that "the more reasoned
rule would allow perjury to be a predicate act under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(1),
through 18 U.S.C. § 1503, where the plaintiffs allege that the perjury was
part of the pattern of racketeering." 115. The case of Florida Evergreen
Foliage v. Ei Du Pont De Nemours, 135 F.Supp.2d 1271 (S.D. Fla. 2001)
further supports this view, noting that "defendants have not been able to
direct the Court to any federal cases specifically holding that litigation
conduct by a litigating party in a prior case is entitled to absolute immunity
and may not form the basis of a subsequent federal civil RICO claim." The
court was persuaded that perjury could be a predicate act under RICO
"where the plaintiffs allege that the perjury was part of the pattern of
racketeering." 116. Furthermore, United States v. Hansmeier, Case No. 0:16-
cr-00334-JNE-KMM (D. Minn. Jul 24, 2017) explicitly rejected the notion that
civil litigation conduct cannot form the basis of criminal charges, stating
that "federal law criminalizes any number of actions that are conducted in
relation to litigation, including most obviously committing or suborning
perjury." The court cited multiple cases affirming mail fraud charges based
on conduct in civil lawsuits, establishing that perjury in litigation can be part
of a broader fraudulent scheme that constitutes a RICO predicate. B. Myers'
Actions as Perjury Under 18 U.S.C. § 1621 and § 1623 117. First, Myers
made several statements under oath in a judicial proceeding, satisfying the
first element of perjury under both statutes. 118. Second, several statements
were made with knowledge of their falsities, including: i. Myers intentionally
lied about her financial status and knowingly falsified her financial
obligations in her Affidavit of Indigency. ii. Myers intentionally lied about the
existence of an active order of protection that she knew did not exist. iii.
Myers intentionally lied about cohabitation with the Plaintiff when she
stated that the couples stopped living together as spouses on December 1,
2023, when she continued to cohabitate up until his unlawful removal
caused by her false statements. Picture evidence establishes this and there
is no defense to these false statements. iv. Myers intentionally lied about her
separate property when she claimed both vehicles that Plaintiff pays for
were her separate property prior to the marriage, which is a blatant
misrepresentation as one of the vehicles was leased in 2022, and the other
was financed in 2020, five years after the marriage took place. v. Myers
intentionally fabricated multiple claims of family violence occurring, yet has
no evidence to support these claims. These claims satisfy the second
element of perjury, materiality. These statements were material to the

=== PAGE 16 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
court’s determination of the legitimacy of financial transactions and the
authenticity of court documents, satisfying the this requirement under both
statutes. 119. Third, Myers' perjurious statements were made knowingly and
intentionally, as evidenced by her coordination with Branthoover and
concealment of bank account information. This satisfies the willful intent
requirement, which the Supreme Court has defined as "false testimony
concerning a material matter with the willful intent to provide false
testimony, rather than as a result of confusion, mistake, or faulty memory."
In re Alvarado, 26 I&N Dec. 895 (citing Dunnigan, 507 U.S. at 94). 120. One
minor mistake by Myers would have defeated the intent argument. However,
because several misrepresentations were made across several pleadings
with the intent to have Plaintiff removed from his home, and the fact that
these documents were specifically prepared in part by Branthoover, it
highlights not only a broader scheme, but shows malicious intent especially
when paired with the threatening text messages. C. The Perjurious
Statements Were Part of a Broader Scheme to Defraud 121. In Myers' case,
her perjurious statements were made as part of a broader fraudulent
scheme, as explained above, that involved: i. Financial transactions
(transferring $1,576 from a joint marital account to Branthoover's PayPal
account) ii. Interstate travel for the purpose of preparing fraudulent court
documents iii. Preparation and filing of fraudulent court documents iv.
Concealment of financial information 122. This pattern of activity is part of a
broader, coordinated scheme with Branthoover to defraud the court and
were designed to remove Plaintiff from his residence. Because this perjury
occurred within a scheme that involved enumerated predicate acts,
including wire fraud and the Travel Act, Myers' perjury can be included as
part of the pattern of racketeering activity required for this RICO claim. 123.
In summary, the specificity of Myers’ false statements, the context in which
they were made, and the supporting documentary evidence (bank records,
PayPal records, text messages, phone records) provide strong support for
both perjury prosecution under federal law and inclusion in a RICO claim as
part of a broader pattern of racketeering activity. XI. PATTERN OF
RACKETEERING ACTIVITY A. The Defendants' Activities Satisfy the
"Relatedness" Requirement 124. The enumerated facts above clearly
demonstrate that the predicate acts committed by Defendants Myers and
Branthoover are related under the standard established in H.J. Inc. The
alleged predicate acts share multiple elements of relatedness: i. Same
Purpose: All of the acts were committed with the purpose of "unlawfully
depriving Plaintiff of property and rights." As noted in RICO: A Primer
(2022), acts that "further[] the goals of or benefitted the enterprise" can
establish relatedness. Here, the coordinated scheme to manipulate judicial
proceedings demonstrates a common purpose. ii. Same Participants: The
acts all involve the same defendants, Myers and Branthoover. Similar
participants is one factor that can establish relatedness. iii. Same Victim: All
of the acts target the same victim, the Plaintiff. The consistent targeting of a
single victim further supports the relatedness of the acts. iv. Similar
Methods: The defendants employed similar methods across their activities,
including fraudulent court filings, wire fraud, interstate travel and
communications in furtherance of the scheme, and intimidation after the
scheme was successful, in part. 125. The case of Verges v. Babovich, 644
F.Supp. 150 (E.D. La. 1986) supports the conclusion that these facts
establish relatedness. In that case, the court found that allegations of a

=== PAGE 17 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
coordinated scheme with similar elements were sufficient to establish a
"pattern of racketeering activity" under RICO. B. The Defendants' Activities
Satisfy the "Continuity" Requirement 126. The facts above also demonstrate
that the defendants' activities satisfy the continuity requirement under both
the closed-ended and open-ended frameworks. 127. Closed-ended continuity
requires "a series of related predicates extending over a substantial period
of time," as explained in Egana v. Blair's Bail Bonds Inc, The activities of
Defendants Myers and Branthoover span from December 2023 through May
2025, a period of approximately 18 months. 128. While there is no bright-
line rule defining a "substantial period," courts generally require more than
a few weeks or months. The 18-month period described in the facts meets
this threshold. See Reynolds v. Condon, 908 F.Supp. 1494 (N.D. W.Va. 1996).
129. Beyond closed-ended continuity, the facts also support a finding of
open-ended continuity, which focuses on "a threat of continuing criminal
activity extending indefinitely into the future”. 130. The ongoing nature of
the threats and intimidation, as well as the continued illicit communications
and monitoring of the Plaintiff's legal actions, suggest that the criminal
activity is not limited to a finite period but threatens to continue into the
future. Open-ended continuity can be established if "the related predicates
themselves involve a distinct threat of long-term racketeering activity, either
implicit or explicit." Here, the fact that the divorce matter has not been
adjudicated on the merits and the specific threat from Branthoover stating
“[w]hen this is all over, you get to deal with me. Just a heads up” which
creates a future risk of further criminal activity. In other words, even if the
State court proceedings eventually conclude, the pattern of behavior
suggests that the defendants might continue their harassment and
intimidation of the Plaintiff through subsequent litigation or criminal
activity. C. Meeting Both Closed-Ended and Open-Ended Continuity 131. It is
significant that the facts establish both closed-ended and open-ended
continuity, although either one alone would be sufficient to satisfy the
continuity requirement under H.J. Inc. 132. The fact that the scheme is not
an isolated event but a series of related acts over a substantial period, with
evidence of ongoing and future threats, serves to reinforce the conclusion
that the continuity requirement is satisfied. The combined presence of both
closed-ended and open-ended continuity provides a robust basis for finding
that the defendants' activities constitute a pattern of racketeering activity
under RICO. 133. In summary, the enumerated facts and predicate acts
establish a "pattern of racketeering activity" under RICO, meeting both the
relatedness and continuity requirements as interpreted by the Supreme
Court and federal courts. X. THE ENTERPRISE 134. Plaintiff realleges and
incorporates by reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through
133 above, as if fully set forth herein. 135. Now that the conduct and pattern
of racketeering activity have been established, the final element before
damages is the enterprise element. A. Definition of "Enterprise" Under 18
U.S.C. § 1961(4) 135. Under 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4), "enterprise" is defined
broadly to include "any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or
other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals associated in fact
although not a legal entity.” This definition encompasses a wide range of
entities and associations, both formal and informal, legitimate and
illegitimate. 136. Based on the statutory definition, Myers and Branthoover
constitute a "group of individuals associated in fact" under 18 U.S.C. §
1961(4). The statute explicitly includes an association-in-fact within the

=== PAGE 18 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
definition of "enterprise," and the Supreme Court's decision in United States
v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 583, 101 S.Ct. 2524, 2528, 69 L.Ed.2d 246 (1981)
established that this definition encompasses both legitimate and illegitimate
associations. B. Boyle v. United States and Structural Features of an
Association-in-Fact Enterprise 137. The Supreme Court further clarified the
requirements for an association-in-fact enterprise in Boyle v. United States,
which is cited in United States v. Perry: "an association-in-fact enterprise
must have at least three structural features: a purpose, relationships among
those associated with the enterprise, and longevity sufficient to permit these
associates to pursue the enterprise's purpose." Id. 17-30610, 17-30611 (5th
Cir. May 12, 2022). X. Damages 134. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by
reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 133 above, as if
fully set forth herein. 135. As a direct result of the racketeering activity
alleged herein, the Plaintiff has sustained substantial injury to his business
operations, suffered significant credit decrease, has lost business
opportunities, had his personal belongings destroyed, has had one vehicle
repossessed, and has been subject to transient and unstable housing. A.
Damage to Business Operations 136. In January of 2021, Plaintiff founded a
digital financial analytics business from his home, focused on delivering
real-time stock market data, automated technical indicators, and live market
commentary to retail traders and boutique investment groups across the
United States and Canada. His monetization model included tiered
subscription plans, custom data feed licensing, and API endpoints. 137. By
2022, client demand and revenue growth began outpacing Plaintiff’s initial
architecture. In response, Plaintiff made the strategic decision to pause
direct monetization in early 2023 to reinvest in infrastructure and ensure
the platform could handle commercial-scale traffic. This included: i.
Designing and deploying asynchronous financial signal algorithms, ii.
Mastering PostgreSQL and NoSQL systems for real-time data delivery, iii.
Building websocket-based dashboards for live data streaming, iv. Drafting
licensing terms for premium indicator access and reseller API use. This
period of reinvestment came at significant cost: Plaintiff temporarily
sacrificed a revenue stream that had reached $12,000 per month at its peak
in exchange for long-term scalability. Plaintiff anticipated a short-term
revenue dip, which he strategically absorbed in reliance on his imminent
reentry to market. 138. By the summer of 2023, Plaintiff had completed core
backend optimization and UI integrations and was prepared to scale user
acquisition and marketing. This readiness marked a significant inflection
point in Plaintiff’s commercial trajectory. 139. Plaintiff reasonably projected
a return to $9,000–$10,000/month by mid-2024, with a 24-month growth
model targeting $170,124.59 in revenue through subscriptions and data
services alone. This forecast was based not on speculation, but on verified
revenue history, platform readiness, and documented user engagement
trends. 140. As part of Defendants’ coordinated scheme to deprive Plaintiff
of his home and operational capacity, Plaintiff was wrongfully and suddenly
removed from the family residence in January 2024, despite Defendants’ full
knowledge that he operated an active and income-generating business from
that location. This action caused a direct and immediate injury to Plaintiff’s
business, cutting off his ability to scale as planned. Instead of growing,
Plaintiff’s revenue collapsed. 141. The removal was executed without
warning or legal justification and had an immediate effect on Plaintiff’s
operations. Although the core data systems were technically portable, the

=== PAGE 19 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
business depended on commercial-grade internet, low-latency upload
speeds, and a consistent, uninterrupted digital environment to support real-
time financial analytics, streaming, and API-based services. Following the
removal, Plaintiff was unable to find alternate housing with sufficient
bandwidth. Attempts to work from temporary family residences failed, as
Plaintiff’s usage either exceeded available internet capacity or interfered
with household connectivity, making it impossible to maintain stable service.
Without the ability to stream, deliver data products, or support his clients,
Plaintiff's revenue quickly declined and client engagement deteriorated.
142. Between September and December 2023, Plaintiff earned $10,529.72,
averaging $2,632.43 per month after reactivating his business operations.
Based on the platform’s performance, technical stability, and confirmed
subscriber growth, Plaintiff reasonably projected returning to $5,000/month
by mid-2024, with stable performance continuing through 2025. 143. Under
a conservative model, had the business not been disrupted by Defendants’
interference, Plaintiff would have earned: i. Approximately $15,794.58
during the first half of 2024 (maintaining his pre-removal baseline), ii.
Approximately $24,000.00 during the second half of 2024 (with moderate
growth to $4,000/month), iii. And approximately $60,000.00 across 2025 (at
$5,000/month). This yields a total projected income of $99,794.58 for the 24-
month period following the wrongful removal. 144. Instead, Plaintiff earned
only $14,892.27 across that period due to his inability to operate at scale.
This results in a verified, direct business revenue loss of $84,902.31. 145.
Accordingly, Plaintiff seeks recovery of $84,902.31 in lost business income
directly caused by Defendants’ pattern of racketeering activity described
above. B. Cost of Living Increase – Proximity to Children 146. Between
March and June of 2024, Plaintiff resided with his grandmother in Garland,
Texas while he sought relief from the State courts. By July of 2024,
Plaintiff’s grandmother sold her home and moved into a small apartment,
leaving Plaintiff without any place to stay. 147. Because no family member
could offer reliable housing—due in part to Plaintiff’s internet bandwidth
requirements and the sensitive nature of the litigation—Plaintiff was forced
to rely on a series of short-term Airbnb rentals between July and October
2024 so that he could reside near-by his daughters and provide them with a
stable environment as he sought relief. 148. Verified receipts show that
Plaintiff incurred a total of $14,553.89 in temporary housing costs during
this period. These expenses were not discretionary but were directly caused
by the Defendants’ actions that: i. Deprived Plaintiff of access to his lawful
residence, ii. Created legal uncertainty regarding custody, iii. And required
proximity to the children to preserve parental rights and the status quo. C.
Damages – Fraudulent Transfer of $1,576 and Cessation of Business
Advertisements 149. As noted above, Defendants coordinated in emptying
the joint marital PNC bank account, transferring $1,576.00 from Plaintiff to
a PayPal account controlled by Daniel Kenneth Branthoover, which was
subsequently routed to Morgan Michelle Myers. These funds were used to
purchase a second phone for Myers, enabling concealed communication and
coordination between Defendants in furtherance of their scheme to defraud
Plaintiff and obstruct his business operations. 150. At the time of the
transfer, Plaintiff was in the final stages of preparing to relaunch his
business. The stolen funds were earmarked for early 2024 digital ad
campaigns, planned platform upgrades, and onboarding expenses designed
to expand subscriber reach. The sudden and unauthorized withdrawal of this

=== PAGE 20 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
capital forced Plaintiff to cancel scheduled promotional placements and
postpone key infrastructure expenses necessary for business continuity. 151.
Based on Plaintiff’s historical subscriber acquisition cost and prior return on
advertising spend (ROAS), the canceled campaigns were projected to
generate $5,000.00–$7,000.00 in new subscriber revenue during the first
quarter of 2024. A conservative midpoint estimate places the value of this
lost opportunity at $5,000.00. 152. Plaintiff therefore seeks recovery of: i.
The full amount of the fraudulently transferred $1,576.00. D. Damages –
Total 153. As a direct result of the Defendants’ coordinated and fraudulent
conduct detailed above, Plaintiff has sustained total economic losses in the
amount of one hundred ten thousand five hundred thirty-two dollars and
twenty cents ($110,532.20). This includes: (1) $84,902.31 in lost business
income caused by Plaintiff’s wrongful removal from his residence and the
destruction of his operational infrastructure; (2) $14,553.89 in necessary
temporary housing expenses incurred to remain near his daughters and
preserve the parent-child relationship while deprived of access to his home;
(3) $1,576.00 in marital funds fraudulently transferred from Plaintiff’s joint
bank account without consent and used by Defendants in furtherance of the
fraudulent scheme; (4) $5,000.00 in estimated lost income resulting from
the forced cancellation of business advertisements due to the diversion of
business capital; and (5) $4,500.00 in legal and procedural costs incurred by
Plaintiff in defending against the initial, baseless protective order
proceedings filed by Defendant Myers, which were weaponized to gain
leverage in the underlying divorce litigation. 154. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §
1964(c), Plaintiff is entitled to treble damages for injuries sustained to his
business and property as a result of Defendants’ racketeering activity.
Accordingly, Plaintiff seeks an award of treble damages in the total amount
of three hundred thirty-one thousand five hundred ninety-six dollars and
sixty cents ($331,596.60). 155. All damages referenced herein are based on
verifiable records and financial documentation. Plaintiff will produce
supporting evidence and exhibits at the appropriate stage of these
proceedings or at trial. Case 5:24-cv-01311-R Document 18 Filed 06/30/25

Ill.ARGUMENT A. Plaintiff Fails to State a RICO Claim To state a civil RICO
claim, a plaintiff must allege: (1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a

=== PAGE 21 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
pattern (4) of racketeering activity. Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. lmrex Co., 473 U.S.
479,496 (1985). Plaintiff fails to plausibly allege any of these elements. 1. No
Plausible "Enterprise" Plaintiff alleges an "association-in-fact" enterprise
between two individuals involved in a personal relationship. Courts have
consistently held that personal relationships, even if strained or adversarial,
do not constitute a RICO enterprise. See United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S.
576, 583 (1981); Begala v. PNC Bank, Ohio, N.A., 214 F.3d 776, 781 (6th Cir.
2000). 2. No Pattern of Racketeering Activity Plaintiffs allegations span a
short period and involve no ongoing threat of criminal activity. The Supreme
Court has held that a "pattern" requires continuity and relatedness. H.J. Inc.
v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 239 (1989). Sporadic or isolated
acts do not suffice. See Sil-Flo, Inc. v. SFHC, Inc., 917 F.2d 1507, 1516 (10th
Cir. 1990). 3. No Predicate Acts Plaintiff alleges wire fraud and Travel Act
violations, but fails to plead them with the specificity required under Rule
9(b ). See Koch v. Koch Indus., Inc., 203 F.3d 1202, 2 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R
Document 18 Filed 06/30/25 Page 3 of 5 1236 (10th Cir. 2000). The
Complaint lacks dates, content, and context of the alleged fraudulent
communications. 8. Plaintiff's Claims Are Based on a Domestic Dispute The
gravamen of Plaintiffs complaint is a failed marriage and related family
court proceedings. Courts have repeatedly rejected attempts to convert
family law disputes into RICO claims. See Annulli v. Panikkar, 200 F.3d 189,
200 (3d Cir. 1999); Bell v. Dean, No. 2:09-CV-1082-WKW, 2010 WL 185608
(M.D. Ala. Jan. 19, 2010); Benton v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., No. 1:13-
CV-01454, 2014 WL 1407584 (N.D. Ga. Apr. 10, 2014). C. Plaintiff Lacks
Standing Under RICO To have standing under 18 U.S.C. § 1964( c ), a
plaintiff must show injury to "business or property." Emotional distress,
reputational harm, or speculative business losses are not sufficient See
Holmes v. Sec. Investor Prot Corp., 503 U.S. 258, 268 (1992); Reiter v.
Sonotone Corp., 442 U.S. 330, 339 (1979). D. Venue Is Improper in the
Western District of Oklahoma Under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b ), venue is proper
only where a substantial part of the events giving rise to the claim occurred.
Plaintiffs allegations center on events in Texas, including divorce
proceedings in Tarrant County. The only connection to Oklahoma is the
residence of one defendant, which is insufficient. See Woodke v. Dahm, 70 F.
3d 983, 985 (8th Cir. 1995). 3 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R Document 18 Filed
06/30/25 Page 4 of 5 E. Counterarguments to Plaintiffs Specific Claims 1.
Alleged Wire Fraud Plaintiff claims a $1,576 transfer was fraudulent.
However, both parties had access to the joint account Courts have held that
transfers between spouses from joint accounts do not constitute fraud. See
United States v. Sayakhom, 186 F.3d 928, 939 (9th Cir. 1999). 2. Alleged
Travel Act Violation Plaintiff alleges interstate travel to commit fraud.
However, travel for personal reasons, even if related to a divorce, does not
constitute a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1952 unless it furthers a criminal
enterprise. See United States v. Nardella, 393 U.S. 286, 290 (1969). 3.
Alleged Perjury and False Filings Even if Plaintiffs allegations of false
statements in court filings were true, perjury in state court proceedings is
not a predicate act under RICO. See Kim v. Kimm, 884 F.3d 98, 104 (2d Cir.
2018). IV. CONCLUSION For the foregoing reasons, Defendants respectfully
request that the Court: 1. Dismiss Plaintiffs First Amended Complaint with
prejudice under Rule 12(b)(6); 2. Alternatively, dismiss for improper venue
under Rule 12(b)(3); and 3. Grant such other relief as the Court deems just
and proper. 4 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R Document 18 Filed 06/30/25 Page 5 of 5

DISTRICT COURT FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF OKLAHOMA
CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, Plaintiff, v. DANIEL KENNETH BRANTHOOVER
& MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS Defendants § § § § § Case No.: CIV-24-1311-
R § § § § § PLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT
DANIEL BRANTHOOVER’S MOTION TO DISMISS FIRST AMENDED
COMPLAINT Branthoover's motion to dismiss fails because Plaintiff has
adequately pled all RICO elements with sufficient particularity, including
predicate acts of wire fraud and Travel Act violations, a pattern of
racketeering activity spanning 18 months, an enterprise with distinct roles,
and concrete business injuries. Branthoover's alteration of his motion by
removing "COMES NOW DAN AND MORGAN" after Plaintiff pointed out he
couldn't file for Myers demonstrates his unauthorized practice of law and
furthers the conspiracy allegations. For the forthcoming reasons,
Defendant’s motion to dismiss should be DENIED and the case should be
permitted to proceed to discovery after Defendant Myers’ motion to dismiss
or response to Plaintiff’s complaint is filed with the Court. 2 I. Introduction
1. Defendant Branthoover's motion to dismiss must be denied because
Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged each essential element of a civil RICO claim
under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) and (d). The complaint meticulously details
predicate acts of wire fraud and Travel Act violations with the required
particularity under Rule 9(b), establishes a pattern of racketeering activity
through related acts spanning approximately 18 months (satisfying both
closed-ended and open-ended continuity requirements), identifies a distinct
enterprise with defined roles, and demonstrates concrete injury to business
and property as required for standing under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c). 2.
Branthoover’s attempt to file on behalf of Myers and subsequent alteration
of the motion document after being challenged provides further evidence
supporting Plaintiff’s allegations of unauthorized practice of law and
ongoing conspiracy. This conduct aligns with the pattern of deceptive
behavior alleged throughout the complaint and demonstrates that the
fraudulent activity continues even during the litigation process, reinforcing
the open-ended continuity of the enterprise’s operations. II. Legal
Framework: RICO Requirements A. Sufficiency of RICO Claim Allegations 3.
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) prohibits
conducting or participating in the conduct of an enterprise's affairs through
a pattern of racketeering activity, 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). To establish a civil
RICO claim, a plaintiff must allege "(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3)
through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity," plus injury to business or
property. 3 4. Under 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1), "racketeering activity" includes
"any act which is indictable under" numerous federal criminal statutes,
including wire fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343) and Travel Act violations (18 U.S.C. §
1952). A "pattern of racketeering activity" requires at least two acts of
racketeering activity within a ten-year period, 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5). 5. An
"enterprise" includes "any individual, partnership, corporation, association,
or other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals associated in fact
although not a legal entity," 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4). III. Analysis of
Branthoover's Motion to Dismiss A. Sufficiency of RICO Claim Allegations 6.
Branthoover first argues that Plaintiff's complaint fails to allege facts
sufficient to support a RICO claim. This argument is without merit when
analyzed against the detailed allegations in the complaint. Predicate Acts -

=== PAGE 23 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Wire Fraud 7. The complaint extensively details acts that constitute wire
fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343. Wire fraud requires "(1) a scheme or artifice
to defraud or obtain money by false pretenses, representations or promises;
and (2) use of interstate wire communications to facilitate that scheme." 8.
Plaintiff alleges with precision: i. Myers transferred $1,576 from the parties'
joint marital PNC account to Branthoover's PayPal account (username
"dmb575"), completely depleting the account balance. (Complaint ¶25) 4 ii.
The transfer occurred on December 15, 2023, immediately following
Branthoover's deceptive phone call. (Complaint ¶25) iii. 92 text messages
were exchanged between Myers and Branthoover on December 14, 2023,
coordinating their plan across state lines. (Complaint ¶19) iv. Interstate
communications occurred between Texas (where Myers was located) and
Oklahoma (where Branthoover was located). (Complaint ¶67) v. Branthoover
deceived Plaintiff by stating "I've been where you are before. I want to help
both of you," when his true intent was to assist Myers in depleting their joint
account. (Complaint ¶22) 9. These allegations satisfy the elements of wire
fraud as they establish a scheme to defraud, use of interstate wire
communications in furtherance of the scheme, and intent to deprive another
of money or property. Predicate Acts - Travel Act Violations 10. The
complaint also details violations of the Travel Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1952, which
prohibits travel in interstate commerce or use of interstate facilities with
intent to promote, manage, establish, carry on, or facilitate unlawful activity.
11. Plaintiff alleges: i. Myers traveled interstate from Texas to Oklahoma on
December 15, 2023, to coordinate with Branthoover. (Complaint ¶¶23-24) 5
ii. This travel was specifically intended to prepare fraudulent court
documents. (Complaint ¶33) iii. Myers transported the fraudulent
documents back to Texas on December 17, 2023. (Complaint ¶35) iv. After
the interstate travel, Myers filed the fraudulent documents with Texas
courts. (Complaint ¶¶39-42) 12. These allegations establish all elements of a
Travel Act violation: interstate travel, intent to facilitate unlawful activity,
and subsequent performance of acts furthering that unlawful activity.
Pattern of Racketeering Activity 13. Under 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5), a "pattern of
racketeering activity" requires at least two acts of racketeering activity
within a ten-year period. However, the Tenth Circuit requires more than just
two predicate acts; the acts must be related and continuous. 14. Plaintiff's
complaint alleges multiple related predicate acts spanning approximately 18
months, from December 2023 through May 2025: i. Wire transfer of $1,576
on December 15, 2023. (Complaint ¶25) ii. Interstate travel and document
preparation on December 15-17, 2023. (Complaint ¶¶35-39) iii. Filing of
fraudulent court documents on December 18, 2023. (Complaint ¶39) iv.
Filing of fraudulent protective order application on December 22, 2023.
(Complaint ¶45) 6 v. Threatening communications continuing through
December 12, 2024. (Complaint ¶51) vi. Most recent threatening
communication on May 24, 2025. (Complaint ¶52) vii. The transmission of a
motion to dismiss across interstate communications by Branthoover, CC’ing
defendant Myers as if filing on her behalf. See Exhibit 1. 15. These acts are
related as they share the same purpose (depriving Plaintiff of property
rights), involve the same participants (Myers and Branthoover), target the
same victim (Plaintiff), and employ similar methods (deception and
manipulation of legal processes). 16. The pattern also demonstrates both
closed-ended continuity (acts spanning over 18 months and is ongoing) and
open-ended continuity (threat of continued criminal activity, evidenced by

=== PAGE 24 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Branthoover's May 2025 message threatening future retaliation). An
enterprise under RICO includes "any individual, partnership, corporation,
association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals
associated in fact although not a legal entity," 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4).
Enterprise 17. Plaintiff alleges an association-in-fact enterprise between
Myers and Branthoover with clear organizational structure: i. Myers acted
as the "inside" operative with access to marital assets and ability to file
documents in Texas courts. (Complaint ¶91) 7 ii. Branthoover served as the
"outside" operative providing administrative oversight, expertise on
protective orders, and a base of operations in Oklahoma. (Complaint ¶91) iii.
The enterprise functioned as a continuing unit from December 2023 through
June 27, 2025, with consistent roles and coordinated actions. (Complaint
¶91) 18. This enterprise is distinct from the pattern of racketeering activity
itself, possessing structure beyond what was necessary to commit the
predicate acts. Injury to Business or Property 19. For standing under 18
U.S.C. § 1964(c), a plaintiff must allege injury to business or property by
reason of a RICO violation. 20. Plaintiff alleges concrete, quantifiable
injuries: i. Loss of $1,576 fraudulently transferred from the joint marital
account. (Complaint ¶¶25, 104) ii. Business losses from disruption of his
home-based financial analytics business. (Complaint ¶¶115-123) iii.
Documented revenue loss with specific projections based on historical
performance. (Complaint ¶¶121-122) iv. Total damages quantified at
$101,370.58. (Complaint ¶126) 21. These allegations establish concrete
injury to business and property as required for RICO standing. 8 B. Pleading
Fraud with Particularity (Rule 9(b)) 22. Branthoover argues that Plaintiff's
allegations of wire fraud fail to meet the heightened pleading standard of
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b). This argument fails given the detailed
factual allegations in the complaint. 23. Rule 9(b) requires that a party
"state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake,"
including the "who, what, when, where, and how" of the alleged misconduct.
The complaint provides these details with precision: i. Who: Myers and
Branthoover. (Complaint ¶¶5-6) ii. What: Transfer of $1,576 from joint
marital account to Branthoover's PayPal account. (Complaint ¶25) iii. When:
December 15, 2023, with exact timestamps for communications. (Complaint
¶¶22, 25) iv. Where: Interstate between Texas and Oklahoma. (Complaint
¶67) v. How: Through PayPal, using account identifier "dmb575". (Complaint
¶28) 24. The complaint also details: i. The content of specific
communications, including direct quotes. (Complaint ¶¶22, 30, 40) ii. The
specific documents prepared and filed fraudulently. (Complaint ¶39) 9 iii.
The precise false statements contained in those documents. (Complaint
¶¶43-44, 46) 25. These allegations amply satisfy Rule 9(b)'s requirement to
plead fraud with particularity. C. RICO Claims Based on Domestic Disputes
26. Branthoover argues that Plaintiff's allegations arise primarily from a
domestic dispute and related family court proceedings, which do not
constitute the type of organized criminal activity contemplated by RICO.
While courts have been skeptical of RICO claims arising solely from
domestic disputes, Plaintiff's allegations go far beyond a mere domestic
disagreement. The complaint alleges a sophisticated scheme involving: i.
Interstate travel and commerce. (Complaint ¶¶23-25, 35) ii. Strategic
coordination between multiple parties. (Complaint ¶¶19, 33, 91-92) iii.
Financial crimes including wire fraud. (Complaint ¶¶25-28) iv. Manipulation
of multiple court proceedings. (Complaint ¶¶39-46) v. Substantial business

=== PAGE 25 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
injuries. (Complaint ¶¶115-123) 27. This is precisely the type of interstate
racketeering activity that RICO was designed to address, regardless of
whether it arose in the context of a domestic relationship. 10 D. RICO
Standing and Injury 28. Branthoover argues that Plaintiff lacks standing to
bring a RICO claim because he has not alleged a concrete injury to business
or property as required under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c). 29. This argument is
contradicted by the complaint's detailed allegations of specific injuries: i.
Loss of $1,576 fraudulently transferred from the joint marital account.
(Complaint ¶¶25, 104) ii. Documented business disruption when Plaintiff
was forced to vacate his home, where he operated his business. (Complaint
¶119) iii. Specific impact on business operations, including inability to
maintain internet connectivity required for his digital financial analytics
business. (Complaint ¶120) iv. Quantified loss of business revenue based on
historical performance data. (Complaint ¶¶121-122) v. Total damages of
$101,370.58, consisting of $99,794.58 in lost business income and $1,576 in
fraudulently transferred funds. (Complaint ¶126) 30. These allegations
establish concrete, non-speculative injuries to business and property that
are directly traceable to defendants' alleged RICO violations. 11 E.
Continuity of Racketeering Activity 31. Branthoover argues that Plaintiff
fails to allege continuity of racketeering activity. Under 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5),
a "pattern of racketeering activity" requires at least two acts of racketeering
activity within a ten-year period. However, courts have established that
these acts must demonstrate either "closed-ended" continuity (a series of
related acts extending over a substantial period) or "open-ended" continuity
(past conduct that by its nature projects into the future with a threat of
repetition). 32. The complaint alleges both: i. Closed-ended continuity:
Related acts spanning from December 2023 through May 2025,
approximately 18 months (Complaint ¶¶49-52, 86) ii. Open-ended continuity:
Ongoing threats and monitoring activities with explicit threats of future
retaliation, including Branthoover's May 24, 2025 message stating "Where's
my lawsuit? Heard your vm about me. File it. Let's do this :)" (Complaint
¶¶51-52, 86) 33. This temporal scope exceeds what courts typically consider
sufficient to establish continuity for RICO purposes. F. Venue in the Western
District of Oklahoma 34. Branthoover challenges venue in the Western
District of Oklahoma. Under 18 U.S.C. § 1965(a), "Any civil action or
proceeding under this chapter against any person may be instituted in the
district court of the United States for any district in which such person
resides, is found, has an agent, or transacts his affairs." 12 35. Additionally,
under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b), venue is proper in "a judicial district in which any
defendant resides" or "a judicial district in which a substantial part of the
events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred." 36. Venue is proper in
the Western District of Oklahoma because: i. Branthoover resides in
Canadian County, Oklahoma, which is within the Western District.
(Complaint ¶5) 37. Substantial parts of the events occurred in Oklahoma,
including: i. Preparation of fraudulent court documents at Branthoover's
residence (Complaint ¶33) ii. Myers' interstate travel to Oklahoma to
coordinate the scheme. (Complaint ¶23) iii. Receipt of the fraudulently
transferred funds in Oklahoma. (Complaint ¶25) 38. These connections
establish proper venue in the Western District of Oklahoma under both 18
U.S.C. § 1965(a) and 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b). G. Significance of Branthoover's
Motion Alteration 39. Branthoover's alteration of his motion document after
serving it on Plaintiff provides further evidence supporting the RICO claims.

=== PAGE 26 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
The original motion began with "COMES NOW Defendant, Daniel Kenneth
Branthoover and Morgan Michelle Myers," but was later modified to remove
the reference to filing on behalf of Myers after Plaintiff pointed out that
Branthoover could not file for her. See Exhibit 1 40. This alteration is
significant for several reasons: 13 i. It demonstrates Branthoover's
continued unauthorized practice of law, consistent with Plaintiff's allegations
in paragraph 31, which states that "at no time relevant to this litigation has
Defendant Branthoover possessed a license to practice law in any
jurisdiction within the United States". ii. It shows ongoing deceptive
conduct, as Branthoover attempted to conceal his improper filing by altering
the document after being confronted. iv. It corroborates Plaintiff's
allegations regarding Branthoover's administrative role and pattern of
misrepresentations v. It provides evidence of the continuing nature of the
conspiracy alleged in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d) 41. This conduct is
remarkably similar to Branthoover's earlier text message in which he falsely
claimed to be a legal representative, stating: "Charlie, it's come to my
understanding you have retained an attorney. I'm sure he has told you that
all further communication should take place between attorneys. I must
formally ask you refrain from discussing details of this case with my client
moving forward and only communicate with me or your attorney".
(Complaint ¶40). H. The Divorce Process Initiated Under Branthoover's
Advisement 42. The complaint specifically alleges that the divorce process
was initiated under Branthoover's advisement and with his direct
involvement. Paragraph 30 states that Branthoover told Plaintiff "You Are
Getting Divorced..." followed by "I hope I can help 14 with the paperwork
and make things go as smoothly as possible." This statement preceded any
divorce filings, indicating Branthoover's prior knowledge of and involvement
in the planned legal action. 43. Paragraphs 39 and 43 detail how the
fraudulent divorce petition was prepared in Oklahoma under Branthoover's
"direct administrative oversight" and contained numerous false statements
designed to deceive the Texas courts. These allegations establish that
Branthoover was an active participant in initiating and directing the divorce
process as part of the fraudulent scheme. 44. This involvement directly
counters Branthoover's argument that this is merely a domestic dispute
outside RICO's scope, as it shows his direct participation in an interstate
scheme involving predicate acts of wire fraud and Travel Act violations. 45.
Plaintiff is handling both matters separately, and Defendant Myers is unable
to finalize the divorce and has abandoned the matter. I. Perjury and
Subordinate Perjury 46. Finally, Defendant’s motion to dismiss claims
“perjury in state court proceedings is not a predicate act under RICO”. This
mischaracterizes Plaintiff’s complaint, as perjury and subordinate perjury
were not alleged to have been predicate acts themselves, but were alleged
“to support a pattern of racketeering activity…” (Complaint ¶57). 47. The
Second Circuit's decision in U.S. v. Eisen, 974 F.2d 246 (2nd Cir. 1992) is
particularly instructive. The court acknowledged the tension between
Congress's decision to include mail fraud as a predicate offense while
excluding perjury, but determined that 15 "where, as here, a fraudulent
scheme falls within the scope of the federal mail fraud statute and the other
elements of RICO are established, use of the mail fraud offense as a RICO
predicate act cannot be suspended simply because perjury is part of the
means for perpetrating the fraud." Id. at 254. By extension, this principle
would apply equally to wire fraud, which is closely related to mail fraud and

=== PAGE 27 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
is also an enumerated RICO predicate act. 48. This means that when perjury
or subordination of perjury is committed as part of a fraudulent scheme that
includes wire fraud or Travel Act violations, these acts can contribute to
establishing a pattern of racketeering activity even though they are not
themselves predicate acts. The key is that the perjury must be interrelated
with the qualifying predicate acts and further the same criminal scheme,
which is the case in the instant matter. IV. Conclusion 46. Based on the
foregoing analysis, Branthoover's motion to dismiss should be denied in its
entirety. Plaintiff has adequately alleged all elements required for a civil
RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) and conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. §
1962(d), including: i. Predicate acts of wire fraud and Travel Act violations,
pled with the particularity required by Rule 9(b); ii. A pattern of
racketeering activity demonstrating both relatedness and continuity; 16 iii.
An association-in-fact enterprise with distinct roles and structure; iv.
Concrete injuries to business and property as required for standing under 18
U.S.C. § 1964(c); and v. Proper venue in the Western District of Oklahoma.
47. Moreover, Branthoover's alteration of his motion to dismiss document
provides further evidence of the ongoing conspiracy, demonstrating that the
pattern of deceptive conduct continues even during the litigation process. V.
Prayer WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court: i. Deny
Defendant Daniel Kenneth Branthoover’s Motion to Dismiss in its entirety; ii.
Take judicial notice that Daniel Kenneth Branthoover served two different
motions to dismiss on Plaintiff, the first purporting to be on behalf of both
Defendants, including Defendant Myers; iii. Order that this case proceed to
discovery and further proceedings on the merits; iv. Grant such other and
further relief as the Court deems just and proper. 17 Respectfully submitted,

DEFENDANT DANIEL KENNETH BRANTHOOVER'S REPLY IN SUPPORT
OF MOTION TO DISMISS FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT I.
INTRODUCTION Plaintiffs opposition fails to cure the fundamental
deficiencies in the First Amended Complaint. Despite extensive allegations,
Plaintiff does not plausibly plead the essential elements of a civil RICO claim
under 18 U.S.C. §§ 1962(c) and (d). The Complaint remains speculative,
conclusory, and improperly venued. Plaintiff's attempt to transform a
domestic dispute into a federal racketeering case is unsupported by law or
fact. 11. PLAINTIFF FAILS TO STATE A CLAIM UNDER RICO 1. No
Plausible Enterprise Plaintiff alleges an "association-in-fact" enterprise
between two individuals involved in a personal relationship. Courts
consistently reject such allegations as insufficient to establish a RICO
enterprise. See Begala v. PNC Bank, 214 F.3d 776, 781 (6th Cir. 2000). 2. No

=== PAGE 28 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Pattern of Racketeering Activity The alleged acts span a short period and
lack continuity. Sporadic acts tied to a domestic dispute do not constitute a
"pattern" under RICO. See H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S.
229, 239 (1989). 3. No Predicate Acts Pled with Particularity Plaintiffs wire
fraud and Travel Act claims fail under Rule 9(b). The allegations lack
sufficient detail to establish a fraudulent scheme or criminal intent. See
Koch v. Koch Indus., 203 F.3d 1202, 1236 (10th Cir. 2000). 4. No Injury to
Business or Property Plaintiffs alleged injuries are speculative and stem
from personal circumstances. Emotional distress and reputational harm are
not actionable under RICO. See Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., 442 U.S. 330, 339
(1979). Ill. VENUE IS IMPROPER IN THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF
OKLAHOMA Plaintiffs allegations center on events in Texas, including
divorce proceedings and alleged misconduct by Morgan Myers. The only
connection to Oklahoma is Defendant Branthoover' s residence, which is
insufficient under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b). See Woodke v. Dahm, 70 F.3d 983,
985 (8th Cir. 1995). IV. PLAINTIFF'S CLAIMS ARISE FROM A DOMESTIC
DISPUTE Federal courts routinely reject attempts to recast family law
disputes as RICO claims. See Bell v. Dean, 2010 WL 185608 (M.D. Ala. Jan.
19, 2010). Plaintiffs allegations stem from a failed marriage, financial
disagreements, and family court litigation- not organized criminal activity. V.
PLAINTIFF'S CLAIM OF UNAUTHORIZED PRACTICE OF LAW IS
BASELESS Plaintiff mischaracterizes Defendant's procedural conduct. The
initial inclusion of both defendants in the motion caption was corrected
promptly and does not constitute unauthorized practice oflaw. Plaintiffs
reliance on this procedural issue to support a RICO conspiracy is unfounded
and irrelevant. VI. CONCLUSION For the foregoing reasons, Defendant
respectfully requests that the Court: 1. Dismiss Plaintiffs First Amended
Complaint with prejudice under Rule 12(b)(6); 2. Alternatively, dismiss for
improper venue under Rule 12(b)(3); and 3. Grant such other relief as the
Court deems just and proper. Respectfully submitted, Daniel Kenneth

First Amended Complaint filed by Plaintiff pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure l2(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be
granted. In support of this Motion, Defendant submits the following
Memorandum of Law. MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT OF MOTION
TO DISMISS I. LEGAL STANDARD To survive a motion to dismiss under
Rule 12(b)(6), a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted
as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face. Ashcroft v.
Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). Mere legal conclusions or recitations of the
elements of a cause of action arc insufficient. Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550
U.S. 544, 555 (2007). II. ARGUMENT I. The Complaint fails to allege a viable
RJCO claim. Plaintiff's allegations do not establish the existence of an
enterprise, a pattern of racketeering activity, or the requisite predicate acts
under 18 U.S.C. § 1962. The assertions are conclusory and lack the
specificity required to support a RICO cause of action. 2. The Complaint

does not meet the heightened pleading standard for fraud under Federal
Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b). The allegations of wire fraud are vague and do
not identify the specific time, place, or content of the alleged fraudulent
communications. Case 5:24-cv-01311-R Document 23 Filed 07/24/25 Page 2
of 2 3. Plaintiff's claims appear to arise from a personal and domestic
dispute, which is not the type of conduct RICO was intended to address.
Courts have consistently rejected attempts to convert private disagreements
into federal racketeering claims. 4. Plaintiff fails to demonstrate continuity
of racketeering activity. The alleged conduct is isolated and does not suggest
an ongoing threat of criminal behavior as required by RICO jurisprudence.
See H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229 (1989). 5. Plaintiff
lacks standing under RICO because he has not alleged a concrete injury to
business or property. Emotional distress or reputational harm is not
sufficient to confer standing under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c). Ill. CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Defendant respectfully requests that the Court
dismiss the First Amended Complaint in its entirety with prejudice.

Answer (Tenth Circuit)
Short response
Defendants’ motions to dismiss are meritless and mischaracterize both the
law and the facts; the First Amended Complaint pleads a valid RICO claim
with particularity, supported by detailed allegations of predicate acts,
continuity, and injury to business and property that predate and are
independent of any divorce proceedings. The defense’s arguments are
superficial, ignore binding RICO precedent, and represent an attempt to
evade accountability for a coordinated interstate scheme that is not a mere
domestic dispute.

=== PAGE 30 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
The First Amended Complaint sets forth a robust and particularized RICO
claim, alleging a pattern of racketeering activity—including wire fraud and
Travel Act violations—spanning at least 18 months, with detailed factual
support for each element required under 18 U.S.C. § 1962. Defendants’
motions to dismiss, which rely on mischaracterizations of the pleadings and
a superficial reading of the law, fail to address the substance of the
allegations and instead attempt to recast a complex, ongoing criminal
enterprise as a simple family law dispute, despite clear evidence that the
racketeering conduct began before any divorce action and is wholly distinct
from any request for custody or property division.
The defense’s reliance on inapposite or misapplied case law, as well as their
failure to engage with the specific factual allegations and legal standards
governing RICO claims in the Tenth Circuit, renders their motions legally
and factually deficient. The Complaint’s allegations of interstate
coordination, financial fraud, and ongoing threats are precisely the type of
conduct RICO was designed to address, and the injury to Plaintiff’s business
and property is concrete, quantifiable, and directly traceable to Defendants’
racketeering activity—not to any marital dissolution.
Background and Relevant Law
RICO Statutory Framework
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C.
§§ 1961–1964, provides a civil cause of action for any person injured in their
business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962. To state a
claim under § 1962(c), a plaintiff must allege: (1) conduct, (2) of an
enterprise, (3) through a pattern, (4) of racketeering activity, and (5) injury
to business or property, with proximate causation between the predicate
acts and the injury, as established in Tal v. Hogan, 453 F.3d 1244, 1261-62
(10th Cir. 2006); Skurkey v. Daniel, No. CIV-22-1234-D, slip op. at 4 (W.D.
Okla. Jan. 4, 2023); Taylor v. Chesapeake Operating, Inc., Case No.
CIV-18-565-D (W.D. Okla. Nov. 20, 2019).
“Racketeering activity” includes wire fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343) and Travel Act
violations (18 U.S.C. § 1952), among others, and a “pattern” requires at least
two predicate acts within ten years, with both “continuity” and
“relationship” among the acts, as clarified by the Supreme Court in H.J. Inc.
v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229 (1989) and adopted by the Tenth
Circuit in Tal v. Hogan, 453 F.3d at 1267.
An “enterprise” is defined broadly to include any group of individuals
associated in fact, whether or not a legal entity, and need not be a formal
organization (18 U.S.C. § 1961(4); Church Mut. Ins. Co. v. Coutu, Civil Action
No. 17-cv-00209-RM-NYW (D. Colo. Sep. 13, 2017)).

=== PAGE 31 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Pleading Standards
RICO claims based on fraud must meet the heightened pleading
requirements of Rule 9(b), requiring particularity as to the “who, what,
when, where, and how” of the alleged misconduct (Farlow v. Peat, Marwick,
Mitchell & Co., 956 F.2d 982, 989 (10th Cir. 1992), overruled on other
grounds by Shah v. Intermountain Healthcare, Inc., 314 P.3d 1079 (Utah
App. 2013); Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy (2024)).
Pattern: Continuity and Relationship
A “pattern” of racketeering activity requires both relationship (acts that
share similar purposes, participants, victims, or methods) and continuity
(either a closed period of repeated conduct or a threat of future criminal
activity). The Tenth Circuit applies the “continuity plus relationship” test
(Fisher Sand & Gravel Co. v. FNF Constr., Inc., No. 10-cv-0635 RB/SMV (D.
N.M. Mar. 27, 2013); Tal v. Hogan, 453 F.3d at 1267-68; RICO: A Primer
(2022)).
Injury to Business or Property
RICO standing requires concrete injury to business or property, not merely
emotional or reputational harm (Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., 442 U.S. 330, 339
(1979); Luttrell v. Brannon, Case No. 17-2137-JWL (D. Kan. Jun. 19, 2018)).
Analysis
1. The First Amended Complaint Pleads a Valid RICO Claim
a. Predicate Acts: Wire Fraud and Travel Act Violations
The Complaint details with precision the predicate acts of wire fraud and
Travel Act violations. It alleges that, before any divorce action was filed,
Defendant Branthoover initiated contact with Plaintiff under false pretenses,
coordinated with Defendant Myers across state lines, and facilitated the
transfer of $1,576 from the marital account to his own PayPal account,
leaving the account overdrawn and directly harming Plaintiff’s business
operations. The Complaint specifies the dates, participants, communications,
and financial transactions involved, satisfying Rule 9(b) (Farlow v. Peat,
Marwick, Mitchell & Co., 956 F.2d at 989, overruled on other grounds).
Wire fraud requires a scheme to defraud, intent, and use of interstate wires
(U.S. v. Welch, 327 F.3d 1081, 1104 (10th Cir. 2003), overruled on other
grounds by United States v. Stanart). The Complaint alleges all three: a
coordinated scheme, intent to deprive Plaintiff of funds, and use of interstate
electronic communications.
The Travel Act violation is also pled with particularity: Myers traveled from
Texas to Oklahoma to coordinate the fraudulent scheme, then transported
fraudulent documents back to Texas for use in court, all with the intent to

=== PAGE 32 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
further unlawful activity (fraud), and subsequent acts were performed in
furtherance of that scheme (RICO: A Primer (2022)).
b. Pattern: Relationship and Continuity
The Complaint alleges a pattern of racketeering activity spanning at least 18
months, with multiple related acts (wire fraud, interstate travel, fraudulent
court filings, ongoing threats and intimidation) involving the same
participants, targeting the same victim, and employing similar methods. This
satisfies both the “relationship” and “continuity” requirements for a RICO
pattern (Tal v. Hogan, 453 F.3d at 1267-68; Fisher Sand & Gravel Co. v. FNF
Constr., Inc., No. 10-cv-0635 RB/SMV).
Closed-ended continuity is established by the 18-month duration, which far
exceeds the “few weeks or months” threshold courts have found insufficient
(Levey v. Wetherall, Civil Action No. 1:19-cv-02294-DDD-MEH (D. Colo. Sep.
29, 2020)). Open-ended continuity is also present, as the Complaint alleges
ongoing threats and a continuing risk of future racketeering activity.
c. Enterprise
The Complaint alleges an association-in-fact enterprise between Myers and
Branthoover, with defined roles, a common purpose, and sufficient longevity
to pursue the enterprise’s objectives. This meets the broad definition of
“enterprise” under RICO (18 U.S.C. § 1961(4); Church Mut. Ins. Co. v. Coutu,
Civil Action No. 17-cv-00209-RM-NYW; RICO: A Primer (2022)).
d. Injury to Business or Property
The Complaint alleges concrete, quantifiable injury: loss of business income,
loss of funds from the marital account, and additional costs directly resulting
from Defendants’ racketeering activity. These are precisely the types of
injuries RICO is designed to redress (Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., 442 U.S. at
339; Luttrell v. Brannon, Case No. 17-2137-JWL).
2. Defendants’ Motions Are Legally and Factually Deficient
a. Mischaracterization as a “Domestic Dispute”
Defendants’ repeated assertion that this is merely a family law dispute is
contradicted by the pleadings and the law. The racketeering conduct began
before any divorce action was filed, was orchestrated by Branthoover (not
the parties), and involved interstate coordination, financial fraud, and
ongoing threats. The divorce action itself was initiated as part of the
scheme, not as a pre-existing dispute. The Complaint does not seek custody
or property division, but damages for business and property injuries caused
by Defendants’ racketeering activity.
RICO is not limited to “organized crime” or traditional mob activity; it
applies to any pattern of racketeering activity that injures business or
property, regardless of the context (Plains Resources, Inc. v. Gable, 782 F.2d

=== PAGE 33 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
883, 886 (10th Cir. 1986); PAYORS, PLAYERS, AND PROXIMATE CAUSE
(2022)). The Tenth Circuit has expressly rejected any requirement that RICO
claims be tied to “organized crime” (Plains Resources, Inc. v. Gable, 782 F.2d
at 886).
b. Pleading Particularity
Defendants’ claim that the Complaint lacks particularity is baseless. The
Complaint provides dates, participants, communications, financial
transactions, and the specific methods used to perpetrate the scheme. This
far exceeds the requirements of Rule 9(b) as interpreted by the Tenth Circuit
(Farlow v. Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co., 956 F.2d at 989, overruled on
other grounds).
c. Pattern and Continuity
Defendants’ argument that the alleged acts are “sporadic” or “isolated” is
contradicted by the 18-month duration, the ongoing nature of the threats,
and the repeated use of interstate communications and fraudulent filings.
The Tenth Circuit has held that a pattern may be established by a series of
related acts over a substantial period, and the Complaint’s allegations easily
meet this standard (Levey v. Wetherall, Civil Action No. 1:19-cv-02294-DDD-
MEH; Fisher Sand & Gravel Co. v. FNF Constr., Inc., No. 10-cv-0635 RB/
SMV).
d. Enterprise
Defendants’ assertion that a personal relationship cannot constitute an
enterprise is legally incorrect. RICO’s definition of “enterprise” is broad and
includes any group of individuals associated in fact for a common purpose
(18 U.S.C. § 1961(4); Church Mut. Ins. Co. v. Coutu, Civil Action No. 17-
cv-00209-RM-NYW; RICO: A Primer (2022)). The Complaint alleges a
structured, ongoing association with defined roles and objectives.
e. Standing
Defendants’ claim that Plaintiff lacks standing is meritless. The Complaint
alleges direct, non-speculative injury to business and property, not mere
emotional distress or reputational harm. The loss of business income, funds,
and additional costs are all concrete injuries recognized by RICO (Reiter v.
Sonotone Corp., 442 U.S. at 339; Luttrell v. Brannon, Case No. 17-2137-
JWL).
f. Venue
Venue is proper in the Western District of Oklahoma because substantial
parts of the events occurred there: Branthoover resides in the district,
fraudulent documents were prepared there, and the wire fraud was
executed in part from Oklahoma. Both 18 U.S.C. § 1965(a) and 28 U.S.C. §
1391(b) are satisfied.

=== PAGE 34 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
g. Perjury as Part of the Scheme
Defendants’ assertion that perjury cannot be a predicate act under RICO is a
red herring. The Complaint does not rely on perjury alone as a predicate act,
but alleges that perjury was part of a broader scheme involving wire fraud
and Travel Act violations. Courts have recognized that perjury, when
committed as part of a qualifying fraudulent scheme, can support a RICO
claim (RICO: A Primer (2022)).
3. Defendants’ Motions Are Superficial and Evasive
Defendants’ motions are formulaic, ignore the specific factual allegations,
and rely on inapposite case law. For example, their citation to cases
rejecting RICO claims in purely domestic disputes is irrelevant where, as
here, the Complaint alleges a coordinated interstate scheme with concrete
business injury. Their reliance on out-of-circuit or distinguishable cases does
not override binding Tenth Circuit precedent.
Moreover, their failure to address the specific role of Branthoover in
initiating the scheme, the pre-divorce timing of the predicate acts, and the
ongoing nature of the racketeering activity demonstrates a lack of
engagement with the actual pleadings. Their efforts to dismiss the case are
not grounded in law or fact, but represent an attempt to escape
accountability for their actions.
Exceptions and Caveats
Some authorities cited by Defendants, such as Condict v. Condict, 815 F.2d
579 (10th Cir. 1987), have been superseded or limited by subsequent case
law, and the Tenth Circuit has clarified that RICO does not require a
connection to organized crime or a “distinct RICO injury” beyond injury to
business or property (Plains Resources, Inc. v. Gable, 782 F.2d at 886).
Similarly, Farlow v. Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co., 956 F.2d 982 was
overruled on other grounds, but its articulation of Rule 9(b) particularity
remains instructive.
Conclusion
The First Amended Complaint pleads a valid, particularized RICO claim,
supported by detailed factual allegations of predicate acts, continuity,
enterprise, and concrete injury to business and property. Defendants’
motions to dismiss are legally and factually deficient, mischaracterize the
nature of the case, and ignore binding precedent. The racketeering conduct
alleged is not a mere domestic dispute, but a coordinated interstate scheme
that began before any divorce action and is wholly distinct from any family
law matter. The Court should deny Defendants’ motions in their entirety and
permit the case to proceed to discovery.

Sundance Servs., Inc. v. Roach, Civ. No. 10-110 JP/CEG (D. N.M. Sep 16,
2011)
U.S. District Court — District of New Mexico
Extract
The Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals has set forth the elements for mail and
wire fraud as follows: The elements of federal mail fraud as defined in 18
U.S.C. §1341 are (1) a scheme or artifice to defraud or obtain property by
means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, (2) an
intent to defraud, and (3) use of the mails to execute the scheme. The first
and second elements of federal mail and wire fraud are identical. The third
element of wire fraud as defined in 18 U.S.C. §1343 is the use of interstate
wire or radio communications to execute the scheme. One may 'defraud'
another within the meaning of §§1341 and 1343 by depriving another of
property or 'the intangible right of honest services.' Whether alleging a
deprivation of property or honest services or both, a mail or wire fraud
indictment must allege a scheme to defraud, an intent to defraud...
Summary
Elements necessary to establish mail and wire fraud, which are relevant to
the plaintiff's allegations of wire fraud in the RICO claim. The elements
include a scheme to defraud, intent to defraud, and use of interstate
communications, which align with the plaintiff's allegations against the
defendants. This supports the argument that the plaintiff's complaint
sufficiently alleges predicate acts of wire fraud, countering the defendants'
motion to dismiss.

"RICO provides a cause of action for those injured in business or property by
reason of prohibited racketeering activities." Bixler v. Foster, 596 F.3d 751,
756 (10th Cir. 2010) (citing 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c)). To state a claim under
RICO, a plaintiff must allege "(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a
pattern (4) of racketeering activity." Id. at 761 (quoting Gillmor v. Thomas,
490 F.3d 791, 797 (10th Cir. 2007)). To form a "pattern," at least two acts of
racketeering activity are required. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5). ... To establish a
substantive RICO violation, a plaintiff must show that there was "a pattern
of racketeering activity." 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). At least two predicate acts of
racketeering activity are required but not necessarily sufficient to
demonstrate a pattern. Heinrich v. Waiting Angels Adoption Servs., Inc., 668
F.3d 393, 409 (6th Cir. 2012). "'RICO is not aimed at the isolated offender,'"
so, in addition to the predicate acts, a plaintiff must show that the

racketeering predicates are related and amount to "a threat of continuing
activity." Tal, 453 F.3d at 1267-68 (quoting Resolution Trust Corp. v. Stone,
998 F.2d 1534, 1544 (10th Cir. 1993)). This test has come to be called the
"continuity plus relationship" test. ... Fisher relies on open-ended continuity
to prove the "pattern" element of its RICO claim. (Doc. 105 at 18). Open-
ended continuity depends heavily on the facts of the case. Resolution Trust
Corp., 998 F.2d at 1543. For 12(b)(6) purposes, open-ended continuity is
established if the plaintiff can plausibly allege "that there was a threat of
continuing criminal activity beyond the period during which the predicate
acts were performed." Heinrich, 668 F.3d at 410. The threat of continuing
racketeering activity need not be established exclusively by the predicate
acts, and the court should consider the totality of the circumstances
surrounding the commission of the acts. Id. (citation omitted); see also Tal,
453 F.3d at 1268 (citation omitted).
Summary
To establish a RICO claim, a plaintiff must demonstrate conduct of an
enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. This requires at least
two predicate acts that are related and amount to a threat of continuing
activity. The Tenth Circuit emphasizes the "continuity plus relationship" test,
which requires showing that the racketeering predicates are related and
pose a threat of ongoing criminal activity. Open-ended continuity can be
established if there is a plausible threat of continuing criminal activity
beyond the period of the predicate acts, considering the totality of the
circumstances.
Luttrell v. Brannon, Case No. 17-2137-JWL (D. Kan. Jun 19, 2018)
U.S. District Court — District of Kansas
Extract
In Count III of his amended complaint, plaintiff asserts claims against all
defendants under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C. § 1961 et seq. RICO allows for a civil
action by a person 'injured in his business or property' by a violation of
Section 1962 of the Act. See id. § 1964(c); see also Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex
Co., Inc., 473 U.S. 479, 496-97 (1985) (a RICO plaintiff 'only has standing if,
and can only recover to the extent that, he has been injured in his business
or property by the conduct constituting the offenses'). Congress has thus
excluded personal injuries from the kinds of injury that may underlie a RICO
claim. ... Both Section 1962(c) and Section 1962(a) require a showing of a
pattern of racketeering activity, consisting of at least two predicate acts. See
18 U.S.C. §§ 1961(5), 1962(a), (c). In order to satisfy this requirement, there
must be both a relationship between the predicate acts and some element of
continuity. See H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 239
(1989). The Supreme Court has explained the continuity requirement as
follows: 'Continuity' is both a closed- and open-ended concept, referring
either to a closed period of repeated conduct, or to past conduct that by its

=== PAGE 37 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
nature projects into the future with a threat of repetition. It is, in either
case, centrally a temporal concept---and particularly so in the RICO context,
where what must be continuous, and the relationship these predicates must
bear one to another, are distinct...
Summary
The passage provides insight into the requirements for a RICO claim,
emphasizing the need for a pattern of racketeering activity, which includes
at least two predicate acts with a relationship and continuity. It also clarifies
that personal injuries are excluded from RICO claims, focusing instead on
injuries to business or property. This information is generally applicable to
RICO claims and can be used to argue that the plaintiff's claims are valid
under RICO if they meet these criteria.
Snyder v. Acord Corp., Civil Action No. 1:14-cv-01736-JLK (D. Colo. Jan 15,
2016)
U.S. District Court — District of Colorado
Extract
The elements of a civil RICO claim are (1) investment in, control of, or
conduct of (2) an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity. 18 U.S.C. § 1962(a), (b), & (c); see Tal v. Hogan, 453 F.3d 1244, 1261
(10th Cir. 2006). 'Racketeering activity' is defined in 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1)(B)
as any 'act which is indictable' under federal law and specifically includes
mail fraud and wire fraud. Tal, 453 F.3d at 1261.
Summary
To establish a civil RICO claim, a plaintiff must demonstrate the conduct of
an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity, which includes acts
indictable under federal law such as wire fraud. This framework is
applicable to the current case, as the First Amended Complaint alleges wire
fraud and other predicate acts as part of a pattern of racketeering activity.
Hall v. Doering, 997 F.Supp. 1445 (D. Kan. 1998)
U.S. District Court — District of Kansas
Extract
Plaintiffs allege that defendants violated civil RICO, 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961-1965.
That Act makes it unlawful for 'any person employed by or associated with
an enterprise ... to conduct or participate ... in the conduct of such
enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity ...' 18 U.S.C. §
1962(c). A violation of RICO requires conduct of an enterprise through a

=== PAGE 38 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
pattern of racketeering activity. ... For these reasons alone, plaintiffs' RICO
claims must be dismissed. Even if plaintiffs had sufficiently alleged a
predicate racketeering activity, however, their RICO claims would fail for
other reasons. For example plaintiffs do not properly allege a 'pattern' of
racketeering activity. A 'pattern' presumes repeated activity, not merely
repeated acts to carry out the same scheme. ... The Supreme Court has held
that to establish a 'pattern' under RICO, a plaintiff must show that the
predicates themselves amount to or otherwise constitute a threat of
continuing racketeering activity. ... 'Continuity' is both a closed- and open-
ended concept, referring either to a closed period of repeated conduct, or to
past conduct that by its nature projects into the future with a threat of
repetition.... A party alleging a RICO violation may demonstrate continuity
over a closed period by proving a series of related predicates extending over
a substantial period of time. Predicate acts extending over a few weeks or
months and threatening no future criminal conduct do not satisfy this
requirement: Congress was concerned in RICO with long-term criminal
conduct.
Summary
To establish a RICO claim, a plaintiff must demonstrate a pattern of
racketeering activity, which requires more than just repeated acts to carry
out the same scheme. The pattern must involve repeated activity that
constitutes a threat of continuing racketeering activity. Continuity can be
shown through either a closed period of repeated conduct or past conduct
that projects into the future with a threat of repetition. The passage
emphasizes that short-term or isolated acts do not satisfy the continuity
requirement, as RICO is concerned with long-term criminal conduct.
Sil-Flo, Inc. v. SFHC, Inc., 917 F.2d 1507 (10th Cir. 1990)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
Sil-Flo, Inc.'s final argument in this appeal is that the district court erred in
granting the defendants' pretrial motion for summary judgment on its RICO
claim. The court dismissed this claim after it permitted the plaintiffs to
amend their complaint and to file a RICO case statement, finding that it
consist[ed] of allegations which, when construed in a light most favorable to
the Plaintiffs, set forth a series of acts which do not constitute a pattern of
racketeering activity as is required by the RICO Act. The allegations
amount, basically, to a very limited course of conduct. The conduct is limited
both with respect to continuity over time and with respect to the extent the
world outside the alleged enterprise was affected. The Plaintiffs describe a
single scam affecting a single mark, that is, Mr. Ceparano. What occurred
with that single scam cannot be subdivided into separate acts for the
purpose of setting up a RICO claim.

=== PAGE 39 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
For a RICO claim to be valid, there must be a pattern of racketeering
activity that demonstrates continuity and relationship. The court in "Sil-Flo,
Inc. v. SFHC, Inc." found that a single scheme affecting a single individual
without a threat of ongoing criminal activity does not meet the RICO
requirements. This is relevant to the current case because it highlights the
need for a pattern of activity rather than isolated incidents.
Kaplan v. Archer, Civil Action No. 11-cv-02094-PAB-CBS (D. Colo. Jul 03,
2012)
U.S. District Court — District of Colorado
Extract
RICO makes it 'unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any
enterprise... to conduct or participate... in the conduct of such enterprise's
affairs' through the commission of two or more statutorily defined crimes -
which RICO calls 'a pattern of racketeering activity.' 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c).
'Racketeering activity' encompasses a number of crimes identified in the
statute. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1). 'These underlying acts are referred to as
predicate acts, because they form the basis for liability under RICO.' Tal v.
Hogan, 453 F.3d 1244, 1261 (10th Cir. 2006) (internal quotation marks and
citation omitted).
Summary
To establish a RICO claim, a plaintiff must demonstrate a pattern of
racketeering activity, which involves the commission of two or more
predicate acts as defined by 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1). This is relevant to the
plaintiff's case as it supports the argument that the actions of the
defendants, including wire fraud and Travel Act violations, can be
considered predicate acts under RICO, thus forming a pattern of
racketeering activity.

U.S. District Court — District of Colorado
Extract
RICO allows private parties to bring civil actions for treble damages for
violations of sections 1962(c) and (d). See 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c). 'To state a
RICO claim, a plaintiff must allege that the defendant violated the
substantive RICO statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1962[(c)], by setting forth four
elements: (1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of

racketeering activity.' Deck v. Engineered Laminates, 349 F.3d 1253,
1256-57 (10th Cir. 2003) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).
'Pursuant to § 1962(d), conspiracy to commit a RICO violation also
constitutes a violation of the Act when a conspirator adopts the goal of
furthering the enterprise, even if the conspirator does not commit a
predicate act.'
Summary
Clear explanation of the elements required to establish a RICO claim, which
includes conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity.
It also highlights that a conspiracy to commit a RICO violation is itself a
violation, even if a conspirator does not commit a predicate act. This is
relevant to the plaintiff's case as it supports the argument that the actions of
the defendants, including the alleged conspiracy and racketeering activities,
fall within the scope of RICO violations.
Tal v. Hogan, 453 F.3d 1244 (10th Cir. 2006)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
The elements of a civil RICO claim are (1) investment in, control of, or
conduct of (2) an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity. 18 U.S.C. § 1962(a), (b), & (c). 'Racketeering activity' is defined in
18 U.S.C. § 1961(1)(B) as any 'act which is indictable' under federal law and
specifically includes mail fraud, wire fraud and racketeering... A 'pattern' of
racketeering is defined as 'at least two acts of racketeering activity,... which
occurred within ten years' of each other. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5). However,
because 'RICO is not aimed at the isolated offender,' proof of two or more
predicate acts are not sufficient to prove a pattern unless there is a
relationship between the predicate acts and a threat of continuing activity.
Summary
The "Tal v. Hogan" case provides a clear outline of the elements required to
establish a civil RICO claim, which includes the conduct of an enterprise
through a pattern of racketeering activity. The case emphasizes that merely
proving two predicate acts is not sufficient; there must be a relationship
between the acts and a threat of continuing activity. This is relevant to the
allegations made by Charles Dustin Myers, as he must demonstrate that the
actions of the defendants constitute a pattern of racketeering activity with
continuity and relatedness.

Extract
The elements of federal mail fraud as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 1341 are (1) a
scheme or artifice to defraud or obtain property by means of false or
fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, (2) an intent to defraud,
and (3) use of the mails to execute the scheme. See United States v. Haber,
251 F.3d 881, 887 (10th Cir.2001). The first and second elements of federal
mail and wire fraud are identical. The third element of wire fraud as defined
in 18 U.S.C. § 1343 is the use of interstate wire or radio communications to
execute the scheme. See United States v. Smith, 133 F.3d 737, 742 (10th Cir.
1997).
Summary
Elements necessary to establish mail and wire fraud, which are relevant to
the plaintiff's allegations of wire fraud in the complaint. The elements
include a scheme to defraud, intent to defraud, and the use of interstate
communications to execute the scheme. These elements are directly
applicable to the plaintiff's claims against the defendants, as the complaint
alleges a scheme involving interstate communications and fraudulent
transfers.
Pitts v. Turner and Boisseau Chartered, 850 F.2d 650 (10th Cir. 1988)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
Appellant contends the trial court erred in dismissing his claim under 18
U.S.C. Sec. 1961, et seq. or the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act. In Torwest DBC, Inc. v. Dick, 810 F.2d 925, 927-929 (10th
Cir.), we discussed what a plaintiff must plead in order to establish a RICO
violation: 'A violation of section 1962(c) thus 'requires (1) conduct (2) of an
enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity.' Sedima,
S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479, 105 S.Ct. 3275, 3285, 87 L.Ed.2d 346
(1985). RICO defines racketeering activity as, inter alia, any act that is
indictable under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1341 (mail fraud) or 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1343
(wire fraud). See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1961(1)(B). RICO also states that a '
"pattern of racketeering activity" requires at least two acts of racketeering
activity.' 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1961(5).
Summary
To establish a RICO violation, a plaintiff must demonstrate conduct of an
enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. This requires at least
two acts of racketeering activity, which can include acts indictable under
mail fraud or wire fraud statutes. The passage also highlights the
importance of demonstrating continuity, meaning a threat of ongoing illegal
conduct, to establish a RICO pattern.

Torwest DBC, Inc. v. Dick, 810 F.2d 925 (10th Cir. 1987)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
The Supreme Court has pointedly observed that '[t]he 'extraordinary' uses to
which civil RICO has been put appear to be primarily the result of the
breadth of the predicate offenses, in particular the inclusion of wire, mail,
and securities fraud, and the failure of Congress and the courts to develop a
meaningful concept of 'pattern.' ' Sedima, 105 S.Ct. at 3287. The Court
noted in Sedima that the RICO definition of pattern implies that 'while two
acts are necessary, they may not be sufficient,' id. at 3285 n. 14, and pointed
to the Act's legislative history indicating the type of activity Congress
intended RICO to encompass. ... Sedima thus makes clear that a RICO
violation requires continuous and related racketeering acts.
Summary
The requirement for a "pattern of racketeering activity" under RICO involves
more than just two acts. The acts must be continuous and related, and the
courts have struggled to define a meaningful concept of "pattern." The
passage highlights the importance of continuity and relationship in
establishing a RICO pattern, as emphasized by the Supreme Court in
Sedima.

activity." Tal v. Hogan, 453 F.3d 1244, 1261-62 (10th Cir. 2006).
"Racketeering activity" is defined in 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1)(B) as any "act which

Plains Resources, Inc. v. Gable, 782 F.2d 883 (10th Cir. 1986)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
We disagree with the view that, to state such a RICO claim, a plaintiff must
allege and prove that the conduct described as 'racketeering activity' is
connected to criminal conduct of an organized nature. We are persuaded by
the opinions which have held that there is no such requirement in a civil
setting... The Supreme Court's reasoning and its view of the legislative
history persuade us that we must reverse the dismissal in this case... If the
defendant engages in a pattern of racketeering activity in a manner
forbidden by [Secs. 1962(a)-(c) ], and the racketeering activities injure the
plaintiff in his business or property, the plaintiff has a claim under Sec.
1964(c). There is no room in the statutory language for an additional,
amorphous 'racketeering injury' requirement.
Summary
The Tenth Circuit does not require a connection to organized crime for a
RICO claim. The court emphasizes that the statutory language of RICO does
not include a requirement for the conduct to be connected to organized
crime. The focus is on whether the defendant engaged in a pattern of
racketeering activity that injured the plaintiff's business or property.

Under Rule 9(b), plaintiffs must sufficiently allege each element of a RICO
violation and its predicate acts of racketeering with particularity, a
requirement justified by the 'threat of treble damages and injury to
reputation.' Cayman Exploration Corp. v. United Gas Pipe Line, 873 F.2d
1357, 1362 (10th Cir.1989). The trial court correctly found that the plaintiffs
'wholly failed to allege any violation of RICO with the particularity required
by Rule 9(b).' While plaintiffs claimed mail fraud as one of the predicate acts
to establish a 'pattern of racketeering,' they failed to plead specific mail
fraud violations.

Summary
The passage highlights the necessity for plaintiffs to provide detailed
allegations when claiming RICO violations, emphasizing the importance of
specificity in pleading predicate acts of racketeering. This is relevant to the
plaintiff's response as it underscores the need to demonstrate that the first
amended complaint meets these requirements.
Hall v. Witteman, 584 F.3d 859 (10th Cir. 2009)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
"In order to bring a RICO claim, a plaintiff must allege a violation of 18
U.S.C. § 1962, which consists of four elements: (1) conduct (2) of an
enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity." Gillmor v.
Thomas, 490 F.3d 791, 797 (10th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks
omitted). A "`pattern of racketeering activity' requires at least two acts of
racketeering activity." 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5). Those acts, commonly referred to
as "predicate acts," must be violations of certain statutes. See id. § 1961(1).
Mr. Hall's complaint alleges violations of federal mail-fraud, wire-fraud, and
extortion statutes. Although the district court held those allegation to be
inadequate, we need not address that issue. Even if the allegations of
predicate acts were adequate, we agree with the district court that the
complaint does not adequately allege a "pattern" of racketeering activity
because it fails to allege sufficient continuity to sustain a RICO claim. "RICO
is not aimed at the isolated offender." Tal v. Hogan, 453 F.3d 1244, 1267
(10th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). To satisfy RICO's pattern
requirement, Mr. Hall needed to allege not only that the defendants had
committed two or more predicate acts, but also "that the predicates
themselves amount to, or that they otherwise constitute a threat of,
continuing racketeering activity." H.J. Inc. v. Nw. Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229,
240, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989).
Summary
To bring a RICO claim, a plaintiff must allege a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1962,
which includes conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering
activity. The pattern requires at least two acts of racketeering activity, and
these acts must constitute a threat of continuing racketeering activity. The
passage highlights the importance of continuity and relatedness in
establishing a RICO claim.
Condict v. Condict, 815 F.2d 579 (10th Cir. 1987)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit

=== PAGE 45 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
Specifically, the district court held that the complaint failed to allege the
following: (1) that activities of the defendants were in furtherance of a tie to
organized crime or with criminal activities of an organized nature; (2) that
the defendants, or any of them, have been convicted of the predicate acts of
mail or wire fraud upon which the RICO claim is founded; (3) that the
plaintiffs suffered a 'distinct RICO injury'; and (4) that the predicate acts of
mail and wire fraud were not pleaded with sufficient particularity. Further,
the district court concluded that the Condict Ranch partnership is not an
'enterprise' within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1962. Having dismissed the
RICO claim, the district court also dismissed the second claim for common
law fraud, deceit and misrepresentation.
Summary
For a RICO claim to be valid, it must allege that the defendants' activities
were in furtherance of organized crime or criminal activities of an organized
nature. The claim must also demonstrate a "distinct RICO injury" and plead
predicate acts with sufficient particularity. Additionally, the enterprise must
be defined within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1962, and there must be
continuity in the pattern of racketeering activities.
Condict v. Condict, 826 F.2d 923 (10th Cir. 1987)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
The district court in dismissing the action and entering judgment for the
defendants held that the complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief
could be granted. Specifically, the district court held that the complaint
failed to allege the following: (1) that activities of the defendants were in
furtherance of a tie to organized crime or with criminal activities of an
organized nature; (2) that the defendants, or any of them, have been
convicted of the predicate acts of mail or wire fraud upon which the RICO
claim is founded; (3) that the plaintiffs suffered a 'distinct RICO injury'; and
(4) that the predicate acts of mail and wire fraud were not pleaded with
sufficient particularity. Further, the district court concluded that the Condict
Ranch partnership is not an 'enterprise' within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. Sec.
1962. Having dismissed the RICO claim, the district court also dismissed the
second claim for common law fraud, deceit and misrepresentation.
Summary
The passage highlights the necessity of demonstrating a pattern of
racketeering activity, a distinct RICO injury, and the particularity of
predicate acts in a RICO claim. It also emphasizes that ties to organized
crime or prior convictions are not necessary for a RICO claim. This is

Saine v. AIA, INC., 582 F.Supp. 1299 (D. Colo. 1984)
U.S. District Court — District of Colorado
Extract
The Eighth Circuit has held that the evidence needed to prove the
'enterprise' must be different from that used to prove the 'pattern of
racketeering.' ... The court construed RICO as requiring 'some structure
separate from the racketeering activity and distinct from the organization
which is a necessary incident to the racketeering.' ... If the enterprise can be
co-extensive with the racketeering activity, as the Second Circuit believes,
the statute could simply state that it is unlawful for any person to engage in
a pattern of racketeering activity. No reference to 'enterprises' would be
necessary.
Summary
The passage highlights the Eighth Circuit's interpretation that an enterprise
under RICO must have a structure distinct from the racketeering activity
itself. This interpretation is crucial because it emphasizes that the enterprise
should not merely be a sum of the predicate acts of racketeering. The
court's reasoning is that if the enterprise were merely the cumulation of the
predicate acts, RICO would not need to reference "enterprises" separately.
This interpretation supports the argument that the enterprise in a RICO
claim must be distinct from the pattern of racketeering activity.

of racketeering activity, including predicate acts like wire fraud. The plaintiff
must also demonstrate proximate causation between the predicate act and
the injury. This aligns with the plaintiff's allegations in the current case,
where wire fraud and Travel Act violations are claimed as predicate acts,
and the plaintiff has detailed the injury to business and property.
UMB Bank v. Monson, 21-CV-2504-EFM (D. Kan. Jun 04, 2025)
U.S. District Court — District of Kansas
Extract
The Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, 18 U.S.C. §
1961, et seq. (“RICO”) makes it illegal “for any person employed by or
associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect,
interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or
indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of
racketeering activity.” Therefore, to state a RICO claim, a plaintiff must set
forth four elements: “(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern
(4) of racketeering activity.” ... UMB presents facts supporting Defendants'
involvement in several qualifying predicate acts listed under 18 U.S.C. §
1961- namely wire fraud and financial institution fraud. ... To state a
“pattern” of racketeering activity, the plaintiff must allege “at least two acts
of racketeering activity. .. which occurred within ten years.” Moreover, “a
RICO pattern requires that the racketeering predicates relate to each other
and amount to a threat of continued racketeering activity. No pattern exists
without this ‘continuity plus relationship.’” ... The Amended Complaint
outlines a series of related fraudulent acts involving multiple parties and
spanning a significant period, which collectively suggest a coordinated effort
to defraud the financial institutions and manipulate the Project for financial
gain.
Summary
To establish a RICO claim, a plaintiff must demonstrate conduct of an
enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. The passage explains
that a pattern requires at least two acts of racketeering activity within ten
years, and these acts must relate to each other and pose a threat of
continued activity. The UMB Bank case illustrates how allegations of wire
fraud and financial institution fraud can support a RICO claim when they are
part of a coordinated scheme involving multiple parties over a significant
period.

U.S. District Court — Western District of Oklahoma
Extract
To plead a valid RICO claim, a plaintiff must plausibly allege that a
defendant '(1) conducted the affairs (2) of an enterprise (3) through a
pattern (4) of racketeering activity.' Id. (citing 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c)). An
'enterprise' is 'any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or other
legal entity, and any union or group of individuals associated in fact although
not a legal entity.' 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4). 'Racketeering activity' consists of the
criminal offenses listed in 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1), and a 'pattern' requires at
least two racketeering acts committed within ten years of each other. 18
U.S.C. § 1961(5).
Summary
To establish a RICO claim, a plaintiff must demonstrate the conduct of an
enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. This involves showing
that the defendants were part of an enterprise and engaged in at least two
acts of racketeering within a ten-year period. The Myers case alleges
multiple predicate acts, including wire fraud and Travel Act violations,
which could satisfy these requirements if adequately supported by evidence.

U.S. District Court — District of Kansas
Extract
In order to prove a substantive RICO violation under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), the
claimant must prove the defendant—any person—was employed by, or
associated with, an enterprise which affected interstate commerce, and the
defendant participated in: (1) conduct, (2) of the enterprise, (3) through a
pattern, (4) of racketeering activity. Sedima S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S.
___, ___, 105 S.Ct. 3275, 3285-86, 87 L.Ed.2d 346, 358-59 (1985). The
gravamen of a RICO offense is the conduct of an enterprise through a
pattern of racketeering activity... The threshold requirement under 18 U.S.C.
§ 1961(5) of establishing a 'pattern of racketeering activity' is the showing of
at least two predicate acts. However, as the Supreme Court noted in Sedima,
'Proof of two acts of racketeering activity, without more, does not establish a
pattern.' 473 U.S. at ___, n. 14, 105 S.Ct. at 3285, n. 14, 87 L.Ed.2d at 358,
n. 14 (quoting 116 Cong.Rec. 18,940 (1970) (statement of Sen. McClelland)).
'The target of RICO is ... not sporadic activity, the infiltration of legitimate
business normally requires more than one `racketeering activity' and the
threat of continuing activity to be effective. It is this factor of continuity plus
relationship which combines to produce a pattern.'

100 Mount Holly Bypass v. Axos Bank, Case No. 2:20-CV-856-TS-CMR (D.
Utah Jul 27, 2021)
U.S. District Court — District of Utah
Extract
'RICO provides a private right of action in federal court for individuals
injured in their business or property through fraudulent conduct.' It
encompasses many traditional common-law fraud claims 'if the requisite
pattern and entity requirements are met. The Mafia, of course, is the
quintessential racketeering enterprise, but normal businesses can also fall
under' RICO. 18 U.S.C. § 1692(c) and (d) provide: In short, '[a] RICO plaintiff
must prove '(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of
racketeering activity'' or conspiracy to do the same. For clarity, the court
will address the elements in a different order than they appear in the
statute. Section 1961(4) of RICO defines an enterprise as 'any individual,
partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or
group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.' The
Supreme Court has emphasized that 'enterprise' should be read broadly.
Where the alleged enterprise is an 'association-in-fact'—that is, comprised of
actors not formally or legally affiliated with one another—the enterprise
must have (1) 'a purpose,' (2) 'relationships among those associated with the
enterprise,' and (3) 'longevity sufficient to permit these associates to pursue
the enterprise's purpose.' Here, Plaintiffs adequately allege an enterprise
both as a legal entity (Counts I and II) and as an association-in-fact (Counts
III and IV).
Summary
Elements required to establish a RICO claim, including conduct, an
enterprise, a pattern, and racketeering activity. It emphasizes that the
definition of an enterprise should be read broadly and can include an
association-in-fact, which requires a purpose, relationships among those
associated, and longevity to pursue the enterprise's purpose.

The court further explained that, 'the fact that RICO has been applied in
situations not expressly anticipated by Congress does not demonstrate
ambiguity. It demonstrates breadth.'... The Court rejected a narrow reading
of the phrase 'pattern of racketeering activity,' holding that it does not
require proof of 'multiple illegal schemes' or that the predicate acts be
'indicative of an organized crime perpetrator.' Instead, the Court settled on a
broad meaning for 'pattern of racketeering' that requires a 'plaintiff or
prosecutor [merely to] prove [a] continuity of racketeering activity, or its
threat, simpliciter.'
Summary
The RICO statute has been interpreted broadly by courts, including the
Supreme Court, to apply to cases beyond traditional organized crime. The
requirement for a "pattern of racketeering activity" does not necessitate
multiple illegal schemes or acts indicative of organized crime. Instead, it
requires continuity or the threat of racketeering activity. This broad
interpretation allows RICO to be applied in a variety of contexts, including
those not originally anticipated by Congress.

The first element of RICO requires two or more predicate acts of
'racketeering activity.' RICO defendants need not be convicted of each
'racketeering activity' before a substantive RICO offense is charged. Under
[sections] 1961(1), the term 'racketeering activity' includes a broad
assortment of state and federal crimes. These crimes include: (a) certain
acts that are chargeable under state laws and punishable by imprisonment
for more than one year; (b) acts that are indictable under specified
provisions of Title 18; ... The Supreme Court made a second attempt to
clarify the 'pattern' concept in H.J., Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co.
In that case, the Court held that when proving a 'pattern of racketeering
activity,' RICO requires both relationship and continuity of predicate acts as
separate elements. However, the Court recognized that proof of these
factors will often overlap. The relationship prong is defined by the
connection of the defendant's criminal acts to one another: 'continuity' is
successfully proved if a prosecutor can show actual continuity during a past,
closed period of repeated conduct or an open-ended threat of continued
racketeering activity in the future.
Summary
To establish a RICO claim, a plaintiff must demonstrate a pattern of
racketeering activity, which requires at least two predicate acts. These acts
must be related and continuous, as clarified by the Supreme Court in H.J.,
Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co. The relationship prong involves the
connection of the defendant's criminal acts, while continuity can be shown
through repeated conduct over a closed period or a threat of continued
activity.

Extract
The two most controversial elements of RICO continue to be the 'pattern'
and 'enterprise' requirements. A. Two or More Predicate Acts of
Racketeering Activity. The first element of RICO requires two or more
predicate acts of 'racketeering activity.'(28) RICO defendants need not be
convicted of each underlying offense before a civil or criminal RICO offense
is charged.(29) Under [sections] 1961(1), the term 'racketeering activity'
includes a broad assortment of state and federal crimes. These crimes
include: (a) certain acts that are chargeable under state laws and punishable
by imprisonment for more than one year;(30) (b) acts that are indictable
under specified provisions of Title 18;(31) (c) acts that are indictable under
specified provisions... a corporation under RICO for fraud committed in the
course of its regular business.(168) The Eleventh Circuit reasoned that the
corporation could play the dual role of defendant and enterprise, given the
Supreme Court's broad interpretation of 'enterprise.' By analogizing to
corporate law, the court concluded that '[a]s a defendant, [the corporation
could] maintain its separate legal status as an ongoing business venture. By
piercing through this sterile exterior, however, it [was] revealed as an
[association-in-fact] ... working as a unit to effectuate a common purpose--to
defraud the government.'(169) The court noted that an 'enterprise' includes
individuals and that requiring complete division would allow those
individuals to escape prosecution.(170)
Summary
RICO requires at least two predicate acts of racketeering activity, which can
include a wide range of state and federal crimes. The concept of "enterprise"
is broadly interpreted to include both legal entities and associations-in-fact,
allowing for the prosecution of individuals working together to commit
racketeering activities. This broad interpretation ensures that individuals
cannot escape prosecution by hiding behind corporate structures or informal
associations.

Extract
RICO applies only to those injuries resulting from commission of predicate
acts constituting a 'pattern of racketeering activity.' The statutory definition
of 'pattern of racketeering activity' requires at least two predicate acts
occurring within ten years of each other. A 'pattern of racketeering activity'
also requires evidence that the predicate acts are continuous and
interrelated, rather than isolated and sporadic. A plaintiff can satisfy RICO’s
pattern requirement two ways: by alleging a long-running series of
interrelated predicate acts constituting a closed-ended conspiracy; or by
alleging at least two interrelated predicate acts and the distinct threat of
continued racketeering activities, demonstrating an open-ended conspiracy.
Summary
To establish a "pattern of racketeering activity" under RICO, there must be
at least two predicate acts within ten years of each other. These acts must
be continuous and interrelated, not isolated or sporadic. The pattern can be
demonstrated through a long-running series of interrelated acts (closed-
ended conspiracy) or by showing a threat of continued racketeering
activities (open-ended conspiracy).

defendant's agreement to participate in such activities.
Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy
The Brief - American Bar Association - 2024-01-01
Extract
A violation of § 1962(c), the section on which Sedima relies, requires (1)
conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity. The plaintiff must allege each of the elements to state a claim. They
are all equally essential components, and the complaint will fail if any one of
them is not adequately pleaded. In particular, RICO claims based on mail or
wire fraud must comport with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b)’s
requirement that allegations involving fraud be pleaded with particularity.
The practitioner through their pleadings must articulate with great care and
attention a viable racketeering conspiracy. The court must read the facts
alleged in the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.
Summary
A RICO claim must be carefully articulated with specific allegations of
conduct, enterprise, pattern, and racketeering activity. The complaint must
meet the particularity requirements of Rule 9(b) for fraud-related claims.
The court is required to view the allegations in the light most favorable to
the plaintiff, which supports the argument that the plaintiff's detailed
allegations should be considered sufficient.

Extract
RICO is not just a tool for government control over organized crime. It is
also a remedial statute for civil matters. (31) It 'authorize[s]... criminal or
civil remedies on conduct already criminal, when performed in a specified
fashion' as delineated by the statute. (32) Section 1962 provides civil
remedies for four types of conduct: (1) using income derived from a pattern
of racketeering activity (33) to acquire an interest in an enterprise; (2)
acquiring or maintaining an interest in an enterprise through a pattern of

=== PAGE 57 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
racketeering activity; (3) conducting the affairs of an enterprise through a
pattern of racketeering activity; and (4) conspiring to commit any of these
offenses. (34) Today, Congress urges courts to construe RICO liberally from
the 'perspective of the victim, not the perpetrator.' (35) A private civil right
of action in [section] 1964 provides that '[a]ny person injured in his business
or property by reason of a violation of section 1962... may sue.' (36) Notably,
a successful plaintiff under [section] 1964 is entitled to treble damages and
the cost of the suit, including attorney fees. (37) The threat of treble
damages encourages plaintiffs to bring claims and discourages entities from
engaging in illegal activities.
Summary
The passage highlights that RICO is not limited to government control over
organized crime but also serves as a remedial statute for civil matters. It
authorizes civil remedies for conduct that is criminal when performed in a
specified manner. The passage emphasizes that RICO should be construed
liberally from the victim's perspective, allowing any person injured in their
business or property by a RICO violation to sue. This supports the plaintiff's
argument that the case is not merely a domestic dispute but involves a
pattern of racketeering activity that caused injury to the plaintiff's business
and property.
Santos v. Delta Airlines, Inc.
USDOL Administrative Review Board Decisions
Extract
In contrast, the district court in Chevron Corp. took a different approach
when considering a RICO claim that involved a scheme formulated
predominantly by Americans to extort funds from Chevron Corp. (a U.S.
Company) through 'a pattern of racketeering activity that included acts in
the United States by Americans as well as acts in Ecuador by both
Americans and Ecuadorians.' Chevron Corp., 2012 WL 1711521, at *4. After
finding that RICO applies only to territorial claims, the court moved on to
the second step of the Morrison test. The court first paused to explain that
limiting RICO's reach to 'purely domestic enterprises' is not a workable
approach because 'foreign enterprises have been at the heart of precisely
the sort of activities—committed in the United States—that were exactly
what Congress enacted RICO to eradicate.' Id. at *6 (citations omitted).
Additionally, the court pointed out that because the RICO enterprise is not
necessarily the named defendant in the case, the focus should be on the
pattern of racketeering activity and its consequences.
Summary
The focus in RICO claims should be on the pattern of racketeering activity
and its consequences, rather than solely on the nature of the enterprise or
its location. This is relevant to the plaintiff's case as it emphasizes that the

=== PAGE 58 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
alleged racketeering activities, which include wire fraud and Travel Act
violations, are central to the RICO claim, regardless of the domestic nature
of the dispute.
RICO: A Primer
Extract
A 'pattern' may exist where any combination of two or more offenses
occurred within a period of time. In Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S.
479, the Supreme Court held that the RICO pattern element requires more
than merely proving two predicate acts of racketeering. Rather, proof of
'continuity plus relationship' is necessary. Nonetheless, the Supreme Court
has repeatedly recognized that Congress had a fairly flexible concept of a
pattern in mind. The continuity requirement is likewise satisfied where the
predicates are a regular way of conducting the defendant's ongoing
legitimate business (in the sense that it is not a business that exists for
criminal purposes), or of conducting or participating in an ongoing and
legitimate RICO 'enterprise.' A plaintiff may demonstrate a pattern by
establishment that the predicate acts pose a threat of continued criminal
activity, which is generally demonstrated by showing either: * Closed-ended
continuity. Proving 'a series of related predicate acts extending over a
substantial period of time.' * Open-ended continuity. A threat of 'continuing
criminal activity extending indefinitely into the future,' in light of the nature
of the enterprise and predicate acts alleged.
Summary
The passage provides insight into the requirements for establishing a
pattern of racketeering activity under RICO. It emphasizes the need for
"continuity plus relationship" and explains that continuity can be
demonstrated through either closed-ended or open-ended continuity. This is
relevant to the plaintiff's case as it supports the argument that the alleged
acts, which span over 18 months, demonstrate both closed-ended and open-
ended continuity, thus satisfying the pattern requirement under RICO.
Defending RICO Claims In The Business Context Part II: RICO Claims Must
Allege Injury To Business Or Property
Extract
If a plaintiff brings a civil suit alleging a RICO violation, the plaintiff must
plausibly allege that his injury animating the RICO claim is associated with
his business or property by reason of the defendant's violation of the RICO
laws. Absent these allegations, the lawsuit must be dismissed. RICO
standing is distinct from the more well-known concept of constitutional
standing. For RICO claims, in addition to pleading a sufficiently specific
injury, including allegations that the plaintiff has suffered known damages

=== PAGE 59 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
(as opposed to mere speculative or unprovable damages), the plaintiff must
allege that he suffered an injury to his business or property that bears some
causal relationship to the alleged act or acts that violated RICO. This
fundamental RICO requirement helps ensure that RICO is not expanded
beyond its original intent.
Summary
The passage highlights the necessity for a plaintiff to demonstrate a direct
injury to business or property to establish RICO standing. This is relevant to
the plaintiff's case as it underscores the importance of showing how the
defendants' actions directly caused financial harm, which the plaintiff has
alleged in terms of business disruption and financial losses.
RICO: A Primer
Extract
Among other things, 'racketeering activities' include 'any act which is
indictable under' a list of federal criminal statutes. The list covers an
expansive range of violations, for example, violations of the Hobbs Act, 18
U.S.C. ' 1951 (extortion); 18 U.S.C. ' 1341 (mail fraud) and 1343 (wire fraud);
18 U.S.C. ' 1831 (economic espionage); 18 U.S.C. ' 1832 (theft of trade
secrets); 18 U.S.C. ' 1952 (Travel Act); 18 U.S.C. ' 1956, 1957 (money
laundering); and 18 U.S.C. ' 2318-2320 (copyright infringement). Mail and
wire fraud are the most common predicate acts. Notably, there must be
some nexus to interstate or foreign commerce-it is a jurisdictional element
of a civil RICO claim. Thus, predicate acts will often occur in several
States. ... A RICO enterprise includes 'any individual, partnership,
corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of
individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.' Courts have
interpreted 'enterprise' broadly, and the definition captures both legitimate
and illegitimate enterprises. The statutory list is not exhaustive but merely
illustrative. ... A 'pattern' may exist where any combination of two or more
offenses occurred within a period of time. In Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co.,
473 U.S. 479 , the Supreme Court held that the RICO pattern element
requires more than merely proving two predicate acts of racketeering.
Rather, proof of 'continuity plus relationship' is necessary. Nonetheless, the
Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized that Congress had a fairly flexible
concept of a pattern in mind. ... The racketeering acts need not be similar or
directly related to each other; rather, it is sufficient that the racketeering
acts are related in some way to the affairs of the charged enterprise,
including, for example, that: the racketeering acts furthered the goals of or
benefitted the enterprise, the enterprise or the defendant's role in the
enterprise enabled the defendant to commit, or facilitated the commission
of, the racketeering acts, the racketeering acts were committed at the
behest of, or on behalf of, the enterprise, or the racketeering acts had the
same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims or methods of
commission. The continuity requirement is likewise satisfied where the
predicates are a regular way of conducting the defendant's ongoing

legitimate business (in the sense that it is not a business that exists for
criminal purposes), or of conducting or participating in an ongoing and
legitimate RICO 'enterprise.' A plaintiff may demonstrate a pattern by
establishment that the predicate acts pose a threat of continued criminal
activity, which is generally demonstrated by showing either: * Closed-ended
continuity. Proving 'a series of related predicate acts extending over a
substantial period of time.' * Open-ended continuity. A threat of 'continuing
criminal activity extending indefinitely into the future,' in light of the nature
of the enterprise and predicate acts alleged.
Summary
Comprehensive overview of what constitutes racketeering activities under
RICO, the definition of an enterprise, and the requirements for establishing
a pattern of racketeering activity. It highlights that wire fraud and Travel
Act violations are common predicate acts and that a pattern requires
continuity and relationship among acts. This information is directly relevant
to the plaintiff's case, as it supports the argument that the alleged activities
of the defendants fall within the scope of RICO violations.
Defending Civil RICO Claims: A Defense Plan Should Be In Every Business's
Arsenal
Extract
Civil RICO actions are now ubiquitous, so much so that plaintiffs often
attempt to apply the statute to situations that bear little resemblance to the
criminal racketeering activity animating the enactment of the statute in the
first place. And the potential consequences of these claims need to be taken
seriously. Indeed, RICO not only provides a plaintiff a private right of action,
it also contemplates the possibility of treble damages and attorneys' fee
awards if a plaintiff can prove the claim. The unfortunate reality is that the
mere threat of a RICO claim often can be enough to force a business to the
bargaining table. ... Civil RICO claims are not limited to conduct
traditionally associated with organized crime, but they certainly are not
meant to apply to ordinary business disputes. ... First, to bring a civil RICO
claim, a plaintiff must demonstrate that their business or property was
injured as a result of a RICO violation. In other words, there must be some
sort of concrete financial loss directly flowing from the purported violation
to support a RICO claim. Thus, if a plaintiff does not have a concrete
financial loss, then the RICO claim must be dismissed. Asserting personal
injuries, such as emotion distress, is insufficient. ... Third, the plaintiff must
plead a pattern of racketeering activity for most RICO claims. If the alleged
conduct occurred once or twice, or was not continuous, it cannot form a
pattern of conduct sufficient to support a RICO claim. And oftentimes,
because there is a fraud component, those instances must be particularly
identified in the plaintiff's pleading—a barrier that can prove difficult to
accomplish.

Summary
N overview of the requirements for a civil RICO claim, emphasizing the need
for a concrete financial loss, a pattern of racketeering activity, and the
challenges of proving such claims. It highlights that RICO claims are not
limited to traditional organized crime but are not meant for ordinary
disputes. This information is relevant to the plaintiff's response as it
underscores the need to demonstrate concrete financial loss and a pattern of
racketeering, which the plaintiff has alleged in the complaint.
Defending Civil RICO Claims: A Defense Plan Should Be In Every Business's
Arsenal
Extract
Civil RICO claims are not limited to conduct traditionally associated with
organized crime, but they certainly are not meant to apply to ordinary
business disputes. While there are a number of defenses available as to each
of the four types of civil RICO claims, there are several RICO defenses that
should be in every business's playbook. First, to bring a civil RICO claim, a
plaintiff must demonstrate that their business or property was injured as a
result of a RICO violation. In other words, there must be some sort of
concrete financial loss directly flowing from the purported violation to
support a RICO claim. Thus, if a plaintiff does not have a concrete financial
loss, then the RICO claim must be dismissed. Asserting personal injuries,
such as emotion distress, is insufficient. Second, to prove most types of
RICO claims, the plaintiff must plead that the defendant committed some
qualifying criminal action, the most common of which is mail, wire or
securities fraud. Business deals gone sour do not count. Rather, the plaintiff
must be able to prove the elements of the asserted crime, and often an
intent to defraud. If there is nothing criminal in nature about the
complained-of conduct, RICO should not apply. It is an abuse of the RICO
statute to attempt to shoehorn ordinary business or contractual disputes
into a civil RICO claim. Third, the plaintiff must plead a pattern of
racketeering activity for most RICO claims. If the alleged conduct occurred
once or twice, or was not continuous, it cannot form a pattern of conduct
sufficient to support a RICO claim. And oftentimes, because there is a fraud
component, those instances must be particularly identified in the plaintiff's
pleading—a barrier that can prove difficult to accomplish.
Summary
Requirements for a civil RICO claim, emphasizing the need for concrete
financial loss, qualifying criminal actions, and a pattern of racketeering
activity. It also highlights common defenses against RICO claims, such as the
absence of a criminal nature in the conduct or lack of continuity in the
alleged activities. This information is relevant to assessing the sufficiency of
the plaintiff's allegations and the validity of the defendants' motions to
dismiss.

SCOTUS Resolves Circuit Split On How To Assess Domestic Injury Under
RICO
Extract
The Supreme Court rejected the Seventh Circuit's approach and sided with
the Ninth Circuit. Yegiazaryan, slip op. at 7-8. The Court held that
'determining whether a plaintiff has alleged a domestic injury [for purposes
of RICO] is a context-specific inquiry that turns largely on the particular
facts alleged in a complaint.' Id. at 8. This means that district courts must
consider the 'circumstances surrounding the alleged injury to assess
whether it arose in the United States.' Id. 'If those circumstances sufficiently
ground the injury in the United States, such that it is clear the injury arose
domestically, then the plaintiff has alleged a domestic injury.' Id. at 9-10.
Notably, because the analysis is contextual and 'the range of predicate acts'
for RICO is quite expansive, 'no set of factors can capture the relevant
considerations for all cases.' Id. at 10.
Summary
The Supreme Court requires a context-specific inquiry to determine if a
plaintiff has alleged a domestic injury under RICO. This means that the court
must consider the specific circumstances of the alleged injury to assess
whether it arose domestically. The passage highlights that the range of
predicate acts for RICO is expansive, and no single set of factors can
capture all relevant considerations, indicating that each case must be
evaluated on its unique facts.
