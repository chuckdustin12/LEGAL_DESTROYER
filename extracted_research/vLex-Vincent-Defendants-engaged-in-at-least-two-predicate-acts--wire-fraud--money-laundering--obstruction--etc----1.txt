Question
Defendants engaged in at least two predicate acts (wire fraud, money
laundering, obstruction, etc.) that were related and continuous, and acted as
an associated group with a common purpose. 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) prohibits
any person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in
interstate commerce from conducting or participating in the conduct of such
enterprise’s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity. The
defendants’ coordinated actions, involving multiple predicate acts and a
shared objective, establish both the existence of an enterprise and a pattern
of racketeering activity under RICO.
Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
The proposition accurately states that defendants who engage in at least two
predicate acts that are related and continuous, while acting as an associated
group with a common purpose, can establish both an enterprise and pattern
of racketeering activity required for RICO liability under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c).
Courts consistently require proving both the existence of an enterprise and
a pattern of racketeering activity involving multiple related predicate acts to
establish a RICO violation.
Summary
Under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO),
specifically 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), individuals who are associated with an
enterprise that affects interstate commerce are prohibited from conducting
or participating in that enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering
activity. The statutory framework requires proving multiple elements: (1) the
existence of an enterprise, (2) the enterprise's engagement in or effect on
interstate commerce, (3) the defendant's association with the enterprise, (4)
the defendant's participation in the enterprise's affairs, and (5) participation
through a pattern of racketeering activity. Supreme Court precedent has
established that an enterprise can be formal or informal but must
demonstrate a common purpose, relationships among associates, and
sufficient longevity, while a pattern of racketeering activity requires at least
two related predicate acts that demonstrate continuity.
The provided materials consistently support the proposition that defendants
engaged in at least two predicate acts (such as wire fraud, money
laundering, or obstruction of justice) that are related and continuous, while
acting as an associated group with a common purpose, can establish both
the existence of an enterprise and a pattern of racketeering activity under
RICO. The evidence of an ongoing organization and associates functioning
as a continuing unit establishes the enterprise, while multiple predicate acts
that are related to the enterprise's affairs and demonstrate continuity

establish the pattern of racketeering activity. When defendants engage in
coordinated actions involving multiple predicate acts with a shared
objective, they fulfill the statutory requirements for RICO liability under 18
U.S.C. § 1962(c).
Background and Relevant Law
Legislation
RICO was enacted as Title IX of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970 to
combat organized criminal activity. The statutory framework relevant to this
analysis centers on three key provisions of Title 18 of the United States
Code.
First, 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) establishes the core prohibition: "It shall be
unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise
engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce,
to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such
enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of
unlawful debt." 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) (2025). This provision directly supports
the proposition that persons associated with an enterprise affecting
interstate commerce are prohibited from conducting the enterprise's affairs
through a pattern of racketeering activity.
Second, 18 U.S.C. § 1961 provides critical definitions that shape the
application of § 1962(c). "Racketeering activity" includes numerous federal
and state offenses, including "any act which is indictable under any of the
following provisions of title 18, United States Code: ... section 1343 (relating
to wire fraud), ... section 1956 (relating to the laundering of monetary
instruments), ... section 1503 (relating to obstruction of justice)." 18 U.S.C. §
1961 (2025). This provision confirms that wire fraud, money laundering, and
obstruction of justice qualify as predicate acts under RICO.
Furthermore, § 1961 defines a "pattern of racketeering activity" as requiring
"at least two acts of racketeering activity, one of which occurred after the
effective date of this chapter and the last of which occurred within ten years
(excluding any period of imprisonment) after the commission of a prior act
of racketeering activity." 18 U.S.C. § 1961 (2025). The statute also defines
"enterprise" to include "any individual, partnership, corporation, association,
or other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals associated in fact
although not a legal entity." 18 U.S.C. § 1961 (2025).
Third, the substantive statutes defining the predicate acts mentioned in the
proposition are also relevant. Wire fraud is defined in 18 U.S.C. § 1343,
which prohibits the use of "wire, radio, or television communication in
interstate or foreign commerce" to execute "any scheme or artifice to
defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent
pretenses, representations, or promises." 18 U.S.C. § 1343 (2025). Money
laundering is defined in 18 U.S.C. § 1956, which prohibits conducting
financial transactions with proceeds of specified unlawful activity, knowing
that the property represents such proceeds. 18 U.S.C. § 1956 (2025).

Case Law
The Supreme Court has provided authoritative interpretations of RICO's key
provisions, particularly regarding what constitutes an "enterprise" and a
"pattern of racketeering activity."
In United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576 (1981), the Supreme Court
established fundamental principles regarding RICO enterprises and patterns
of racketeering activity. The Court held: "In order to secure a conviction
under RICO, the Government must prove both the existence of an
'enterprise' and the connected 'pattern of racketeering activity.' The
enterprise is an entity, for present purposes a group of persons associated
together for a common purpose of engaging in a course of conduct. The
pattern of racketeering activity is, on the other hand, a series of criminal
acts as defined by the statute." United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 583
(1981).
The Court further explained that the enterprise "is proved by evidence of an
ongoing organization, formal or informal, and by evidence that the various
associates function as a continuing unit," while the pattern of racketeering
activity "is proved by evidence of the requisite number of acts of
racketeering committed by the participants in the enterprise." United States
v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 583 (1981). This clearly supports the proposition
that defendants acting as an associated group with a common purpose can
establish an enterprise, and their engagement in multiple predicate acts can
establish a pattern of racketeering activity.
It should be noted that Turkette was abrogated by United States v. Lane,
474 U.S. 438 (1986), but this abrogation was limited to the harmless error
analysis in misjoinder cases and does not affect Turkette's core holdings
regarding the definition of enterprise and pattern of racketeering activity
under RICO.
In H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229 (1989), the Supreme
Court elaborated on the pattern requirement, holding that "RICO's
legislative history establishes that Congress intended that to prove a
'pattern of racketeering activity' a plaintiff or prosecutor must show both
'relationship' and 'continuity'—that the racketeering predicates are related,
and that they either constitute or threaten long-term criminal activity." H.J.
Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 229 (1989). This decision
adds the important requirements of relationship and continuity between
predicate acts, supporting the proposition that the acts must be "related and
continuous."
More recently, in Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938 (2009), the Supreme
Court further clarified the enterprise requirement, holding that an
association-in-fact enterprise under RICO is "simply a continuing unit that
functions with a common purpose." Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938, 948
(2009). The Court specified that such an enterprise must have three
structural features: "(1) a purpose, (2) relationships among those associated
with the enterprise, and (3) longevity sufficient to permit these associates to
pursue the enterprise's purpose." United States v. Eiland, 738 F.3d 338, 360

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
(D.C. Cir. 2014) (citing Boyle). This decision reinforces the proposition that
defendants acting as an associated group with a common purpose can
establish an enterprise under RICO.
Lower courts have further developed and applied these principles. The D.C.
Circuit explained in United States v. Eiland, 738 F.3d 338 (D.C. Cir. 2014):
"The RICO statute defines 'enterprise' to include 'any union or group of
individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.' 18 U.S.C. §
1961(4)." United States v. Eiland, 738 F.3d 338, 360 (D.C. Cir. 2014).
Regarding the pattern requirement, the court added: "A pattern of
racketeering activity requires 'two or more related predicate acts of
racketeering within a 10-year period.' The government must show that 'the
racketeering predicates are related, and that they amount to or pose a
threat of continued criminal activity.'" United States v. Eiland, 738 F.3d 338,
360 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (citations omitted).
In U.S. v. Battle, 473 F.Supp.2d 1185 (S.D. Fla. 2006), the court specifically
addressed how predicate acts relate to the enterprise and form a pattern,
rejecting the argument that money laundering acts were unrelated to the
enterprise: "I specifically reject Battle, Jr.'s argument that his predicate
money laundering acts were not related to the enterprise charged and did
not form a 'pattern.' I conclude that the money laundering acts facilitated
racketeering activities by securing them from detection. The two main goals
of the enterprise conspiracy, as charged, were to make as much money as
possible and not get caught." U.S. v. Battle, 473 F.Supp.2d 1185, 1246 (S.D.
Fla. 2006). This case illustrates how predicate acts like money laundering
can be integral to an enterprise's goals, supporting the proposition that
related predicate acts can establish both the enterprise and the pattern
elements.
The D.C. Circuit in U.S. v. Crosby, 20 F.3d 480 (D.C. Cir. 1994) emphasized
that "Criminal liability under RICO is premised on the commission of a
'pattern of racketeering activity,' defined by the statute as engaging in two
or more related predicate acts of racketeering within a 10-year period." U.S.
v. Crosby, 20 F.3d 480, 481 (D.C. Cir. 1994). This reinforces the proposition's
assertion that at least two predicate acts are required.
In Reynolds v. Condon, 908 F.Supp. 1494 (N.D. W.Va. 1996), the court
enumerated the elements necessary to establish a RICO violation: "to
establish a RICO violation under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) a plaintiff must
demonstrate '(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of
racketeering activity that must include at least two racketeering acts.'" 
Reynolds v. Condon, 908 F.Supp. 1494, 1506-07 (N.D. W.Va. 1996). The court
further clarified that the enterprise need only have a common or shared
purpose, which may be legal or otherwise. Reynolds v. Condon, 908 F.Supp.
1494, 1507 (N.D. W.Va. 1996). This supports the proposition that defendants'
coordinated actions with a shared objective can establish an enterprise.
In U.S. v. Welch, 656 F.2d 1039 (5th Cir. 1981), the Fifth Circuit identified
five elements the government must prove: "(1) the existence of the
enterprise; (2) that the enterprise affected interstate commerce; (3) that the
defendant was employed by or associated with the enterprise; (4) that he

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
participated in the conduct of the affairs of the enterprise; and (5) that he
participated through a pattern of racketeering activity." U.S. v. Welch, 656 F.
2d 1039, 1060-61 (5th Cir. 1981). The court emphasized the importance of a
"common goal" in establishing a pattern of racketeering activity, noting that
"The common goal conducting the affairs of the Sheriff's Office by means of
a pattern of racketeering provides a sufficient identity of facts." U.S. v.
Welch, 656 F.2d 1039, 1056 (5th Cir. 1981).
Administrative Decisions and Secondary Materials
Administrative decisions and secondary materials provide additional insights
into the interpretation and application of RICO's provisions.
In Blanchard v. Exelis Sys. Corporation/Vectrus Sys. Corp. (2017), it was
explained that "The RICO statute defines 'racketeering activity' to include
specified, criminal offences (both federal and state) known in RICO
jurisprudence as 'predicates.' A minimum of two predicate offences
committed within 10 years of each other are necessary to constitute a
'pattern of racketeering' action in violation of RICO." Blanchard v. Exelis
Sys. Corporation/Vectrus Sys. Corp. (2017). The decision specifically
identified wire fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343) and money laundering (18 U.S.C. §§
1956-57) as examples of predicate offenses, supporting the proposition that
these acts can form part of a pattern of racketeering activity.
The secondary material "RICO: A Primer" (2022) explains that "To prove a
violation of Section 1962(c), a plaintiff must prove the following elements:
Existence of an enterprise; The enterprise engaged in, or its activities
affected, interstate or foreign commerce; The defendant was employed by or
was associated with the enterprise; The defendant conducted or
participated, either directly or indirectly, in the conduct of the affairs of the
enterprise; and The defendant participated in the affairs of the enterprise
through a pattern of racketeering activity." "RICO: A Primer" (2022). This
comprehensive enumeration of elements aligns with the proposition's
structure and requirements.
Furthermore, "RICO: A Primer" (2022) clarifies that racketeering acts "need
not be similar or directly related to each other; rather, it is sufficient that the
racketeering acts are related in some way to the affairs of the charged
enterprise, including, for example, that: the racketeering acts furthered the
goals of or benefitted the enterprise, the enterprise or the defendant's role
in the enterprise enabled the defendant to commit, or facilitated the
commission of, the racketeering acts, the racketeering acts were committed
at the behest of, or on behalf of, the enterprise, or the racketeering acts had
the same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims or methods of
commission." "RICO: A Primer" (2022). This explanation supports the
proposition that defendants' coordinated actions with a shared objective can
establish both the enterprise and pattern elements.
Similarly, "Racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations" (2008) notes
that "RICO applies only where the commission of two predicate acts
constitutes a 'pattern of racketeering activity.' While the statutory definition
of 'pattern of racketeering activity' requires at least two acts of racketeering

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
occurring within ten years of each other, simply proving two acts may not be
sufficient to establish a RICO violation. The Supreme Court has stated that a
'pattern of racketeering' can only be established if the predicate acts are
continuous and interrelated. Thus, 'two isolated acts of racketeering do not
constitute a pattern.'" "Racketeer influenced and corrupt
organizations" (2008). This reinforces the requirement that the predicate
acts must be related and continuous, as stated in the proposition.
Analysis
Based on the authorities examined, the proposition accurately states the
requirements for establishing RICO liability under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). The
analysis of this proposition involves examining two primary components: (1)
what constitutes an "enterprise" under RICO, and (2) what constitutes a
"pattern of racketeering activity."
The Enterprise Requirement
The RICO statute defines "enterprise" broadly to include "any individual,
partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or
group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity." 18 U.S.C.
§ 1961 (2025). The Supreme Court in United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576
(1981) characterized an enterprise as "an entity, for present purposes a
group of persons associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a
course of conduct," which is "proved by evidence of an ongoing organization,
formal or informal, and by evidence that the various associates function as a
continuing unit." United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 583 (1981).
Building on Turkette, the Supreme Court in Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S.
938 (2009) clarified that an association-in-fact enterprise is "simply a
continuing unit that functions with a common purpose." Boyle v. United
States, 556 U.S. 938, 948 (2009). The Court specified three structural
features required for such an enterprise: "(1) a purpose, (2) relationships
among those associated with the enterprise, and (3) longevity sufficient to
permit these associates to pursue the enterprise's purpose." United States v.
Eiland, 738 F.3d 338, 360 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (citing Boyle).
The proposition states that "defendants... acted as an associated group with
a common purpose," which directly addresses the first two requirements
from Boyle: a purpose and relationships among associates. While the
proposition does not explicitly mention longevity, it does state that the
defendants engaged in "at least two predicate acts... that were related and
continuous," implying a timeframe sufficient to satisfy the longevity
requirement.
Moreover, "Racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations" (2000) stated
that a RICO enterprise must exhibit three characteristics: "(1) a common or
shared purpose; (2) some continuity of structure and personnel; and (3) an
ascertainable structure distinct from that inherent in a pattern of
racketeering." "Racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations" (2000). The
proposition's reference to defendants acting "as an associated group with a

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
common purpose" addresses the first characteristic, while the mention of
"coordinated actions" implies the second and third characteristics.
Therefore, when defendants act as an associated group with a common
purpose, engaging in coordinated actions over a period sufficient to conduct
at least two predicate acts, they can establish the existence of an enterprise
under RICO.
The Pattern of Racketeering Activity Requirement
The RICO statute defines "pattern of racketeering activity" as requiring "at
least two acts of racketeering activity" within a specified timeframe. 18
U.S.C. § 1961 (2025). However, as noted in H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel.
Co., 492 U.S. 229 (1989), the pattern requirement involves more than just
numerosity: "to prove a 'pattern of racketeering activity' a plaintiff or
prosecutor must show both 'relationship' and 'continuity'—that the
racketeering predicates are related, and that they either constitute or
threaten long-term criminal activity." H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co.,
492 U.S. 229, 229 (1989).
The proposition states that defendants engaged in "at least two predicate
acts... that were related and continuous," which directly addresses the
relationship and continuity requirements established in H.J. Inc. The
proposition specifically identifies wire fraud, money laundering, and
obstruction of justice as examples of predicate acts, all of which are
explicitly included in the statutory definition of "racketeering activity." 18
U.S.C. § 1961 (2025).
Furthermore, "Racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations" (2008) notes
that "simply proving two acts may not be sufficient to establish a RICO
violation. The Supreme Court has stated that a 'pattern of racketeering' can
only be established if the predicate acts are continuous and interrelated.
Thus, 'two isolated acts of racketeering do not constitute a pattern.'" 
"Racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations" (2008). The proposition
addresses this concern by specifying that the predicate acts were "related
and continuous."
The relationship between the predicate acts and the enterprise is also
critical. As explained in U.S. v. Battle, 473 F.Supp.2d 1185 (S.D. Fla. 2006),
predicate acts like money laundering can be related to the enterprise when
they "facilitated racketeering activities by securing them from detection." 
U.S. v. Battle, 473 F.Supp.2d 1185, 1246 (S.D. Fla. 2006). Similarly, "RICO: A
Primer" (2022) explains that racketeering acts are related to the enterprise
when they "furthered the goals of or benefitted the enterprise" or "had the
same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims or methods of
commission." "RICO: A Primer" (2022).
The proposition's reference to "coordinated actions, involving multiple
predicate acts and a shared objective" addresses this relationship
requirement, indicating that the predicate acts furthered the goals of the
enterprise and involved the same participants working toward a common
purpose.

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Synthesizing the Enterprise and Pattern Requirements
The proposition suggests that defendants' coordinated actions involving
multiple predicate acts and a shared objective "establish both the existence
of an enterprise and a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO." This
assertion is legally sound based on the authorities examined.
In United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576 (1981), the Supreme Court
distinguished between the enterprise and pattern elements but recognized
their potential overlap in proof: "While the proof used to establish these
separate elements may in particular cases coalesce, proof of one does not
necessarily establish the other. The 'enterprise' is not the 'pattern of
racketeering activity'; it is an entity separate and apart from the pattern of
activity in which it engages. The existence of an enterprise at all times
remains a separate element which must be proved by the Government." 
United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 583 (1981).
This distinction is important—while evidence of coordinated actions and
multiple predicate acts can help establish both elements, they remain
conceptually distinct requirements. The enterprise focuses on the
associational structure, while the pattern focuses on the criminal activities
conducted through that structure.
Nevertheless, as explained in United Energy Owners Committee, Inc. v. U.S.
Energy Management Systems, Inc., 837 F.2d 356 (9th Cir. 1988), citing
Turkette: "The 'pattern of racketeering activity is ... a series of criminal
acts,' while an enterprise may be 'a group of persons associated together for
a common purpose of engaging in a course of conduct.'" United Energy
Owners Committee, Inc. v. U.S. Energy Management Systems, Inc., 837 F.2d
356, 362 (9th Cir. 1988). When defendants engage in coordinated actions
involving multiple predicate acts with a shared objective, they demonstrate
both the associational structure (enterprise) and the series of criminal acts
(pattern) required by RICO.
Furthermore, the relationship between the defendants and the enterprise
must be established. As explained in "Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy" (2024):
"A violation of § 1962(c), the section on which Sedima relies, requires (1)
conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity." "Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy" (2024). The proposition's reference
to defendants' "coordinated actions" implies conduct of the enterprise, while
their engagement in "multiple predicate acts" establishes the pattern of
racketeering activity.
Exceptions and Caveats
While the proposition accurately states the basic requirements for RICO
liability, several important caveats must be considered.
First, mere association with an enterprise is insufficient; the defendant must
participate in its operation or management. In "Racketeer influenced and
corrupt organizations" (2005), citing the Supreme Court's decision in Reves
v. Ernst & Young: "In Reves v. Ernst & Young, the Supreme Court held that

=== PAGE 9 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
the requisite nexus exists only when the defendant's predicate acts 'rise to
the level' of participation in the management or operation of the enterprise.
Actions involving a low degree of decision-making may not constitute
participation in the affairs of the enterprise. One must play some role in
directing the affairs of the enterprise to 'conduct or participate' in the affairs
of the enterprise." "Racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations" (2005).
Second, while two predicate acts are necessary, they may not be sufficient to
establish a pattern. As explained in "Racketeer influenced and corrupt
organizations" (2008): "While the statutory definition of 'pattern of
racketeering activity' requires at least two acts of racketeering occurring
within ten years of each other, simply proving two acts may not be sufficient
to establish a RICO violation." "Racketeer influenced and corrupt
organizations" (2008). The acts must demonstrate both relationship and
continuity.
Third, the interstate commerce requirement must be satisfied. As noted in 
"Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy" (2024): "§ 1962(a), (b), and (c) are limited in
scope to conduct involving enterprises engaged in or the activities of which
affect interstate commerce. It is the activities of the enterprise, not each
predicate act, that must affect interstate or foreign commerce." "Civil Rico:
A Tool of Advocacy" (2024). While the proposition mentions "interstate
commerce," it is important to emphasize that this is a distinct element that
must be proven.
Fourth, for civil RICO claims, there is an additional requirement of injury. As
explained in Prudential Ins. Co. of America v. US Gypsum, 711 F. Supp. 1244
(D. N.J. 1989): "To state a claim under civil RICO, plaintiffs must allege that
defendants are (1) conducting (2) an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of
racketeering activity (5) that has caused injury to plaintiff's business or
property." Prudential Ins. Co. of America v. US Gypsum, 711 F. Supp. 1244,
1251 (D. N.J. 1989). The proposition does not address this injury
requirement, which is essential for civil (but not criminal) RICO cases.
Finally, as "Defending Civil RICO Claims: A Defense Plan Should Be In Every
Business's Arsenal" (2022) notes, "RICO is not a simple statute." "Defending
Civil RICO Claims: A Defense Plan Should Be In Every Business's
Arsenal" (2022). The complexity of RICO's provisions and their
interpretation by courts means that each case requires careful analysis of its
specific facts in relation to the statutory elements.
Conclusion
The proposition accurately states the requirements for establishing RICO
liability under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). When defendants engage in at least two
predicate acts (such as wire fraud, money laundering, or obstruction of
justice) that are related and continuous, while acting as an associated group
with a common purpose, they can establish both the existence of an
enterprise and a pattern of racketeering activity required under RICO.
The statutory framework of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961-1962, as interpreted by the
Supreme Court in cases like Turkette, H.J. Inc., and Boyle, provides clear

=== PAGE 10 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
guidance on the elements necessary to prove a RICO violation. The
enterprise element requires showing an ongoing organization with
associates functioning as a continuing unit for a common purpose, while the
pattern element requires showing at least two related predicate acts that
demonstrate continuity of criminal activity.
When defendants engage in coordinated actions involving multiple predicate
acts with a shared objective, they demonstrate both the associational
structure of an enterprise and the related criminal acts constituting a
pattern of racketeering activity. This combined showing, along with proof
that the enterprise affects interstate commerce and the defendants
participated in its operation or management, establishes RICO liability
under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c).
While various caveats and additional requirements may apply in specific
contexts, particularly for civil RICO claims, the proposition's core assertion
regarding the establishment of an enterprise and pattern of racketeering
activity through defendants' coordinated predicate acts and shared
objectives is well-supported by the legal authorities.
Legal Authorities
P &amp; P MARKETING, INC. v. Ditton, 746 F. Supp. 1354 (N.D. Ill. 1990)
U.S. District Court — Northern District of Illinois
Extract
Regardless of which subsection of Section 1962 defendants are alleged to
have violated, five elements are common and necessary to every civil RICO
claim. These essential elements are: (1) a 'person'; (2) an 'enterprise'
engaged in or affecting interstate commerce; (3) 'racketeering activity'
which (4) occurred in a 'pattern' and (5) an injury. ... Defendants contend
plaintiff failed to adequately allege a pattern of racketeering activity. As a
necessary element of any civil RICO claim, a plaintiff must allege a 'pattern
of racketeering activity'. ... Section 1961(5) provides: 'pattern of
racketeering activity' requires at least two acts of racketeering activity, one
of which occurred after October 15, 1970 and the last of which occurred
within ten years (excluding any period of imprisonment) after the
commission of a prior act of racketeering activity. ... Applying the factors
listed in Morgan to the facts of this case, the court finds plaintiff's
allegations sufficient to meet the continuity element of the pattern
requirement. ... Defendants allegedly committed numerous predicate acts
over a period of two-to-three years; although there is only one victim, P & P,
three separate schemes are involved; and distinct injuries occurred, i.e.,
numerous overpayments relative to Capcom Kits, extortion of Grudge Match
rights, and loss of money and proprietary information concerning the ESAC
system. These alleged facts are sufficient, if true, to establish that either the
predicate acts amounted to continuing racketeering activity or threatened
continued racketeering activity.

Summary
N example where the court found sufficient allegations of multiple predicate
acts over a period of time, which could establish a pattern of racketeering

predicate acts with a common purpose, establishing both an enterprise and
a pattern of racketeering activity.
U.S. v. Battle, 473 F.Supp.2d 1185 (S.D. Fla. 2006)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of Florida
Extract
The Superseding Indictment charges an enterprise conspiracy under Title
18, United States. Code, § 1962(c). Both sections 1961 and 1962 became
effective on October 15, 1970. 'A pattern of racketeering activity' requires at
least two acts of racketeering activity, one of which must have occurred
after October 15, 1970, and the last of which must occur within ten years
(excluding any period of imprisonment) after the commission, of a prior act
of racketeering activity. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5)... Furthermore, I specifically
reject Battle, Jr.'s argument that his predicate money laundering acts were
not related to the enterprise charged and did not form a 'pattern.' I conclude
that the money laundering acts facilitated racketeering activities by
securing them from detection. The two main goals of the enterprise
conspiracy, as charged, were to make as much money as possible and not
get caught.
Summary
The court in "U.S. v. Battle" addressed the requirements for establishing a
pattern of racketeering activity under RICO. The court emphasized that a
pattern requires at least two acts of racketeering activity, and these acts
must be related to the enterprise's goals. The court also rejected arguments
that predicate acts like money laundering were unrelated to the enterprise,
affirming that such acts can facilitate the enterprise's objectives, such as
making money and avoiding detection. This directly supports the proposition
that defendants engaged in multiple predicate acts with a common purpose,
establishing a pattern of racketeering activity.

racketeering activity. Engaging in a 'pattern of racketeering activity'
requires at least two acts of racketeering within a ten-year period... Thus,
each conspiracy was aimed at participating in the affairs of the enterprise.
The acts directed at conducting the affairs of the Sheriff's Office through a
pattern of racketeering activity were related to each other and were part of
a series of acts or transactions. The common goal conducting the affairs of
the Sheriff's Office by means of a pattern of racketeering provides a
sufficient identity of facts to satisfy Rule 8(b)... The government must prove
(1) the existence of the enterprise; (2) that the enterprise affected interstate
commerce; (3) that the defendant was employed by or associated with the
enterprise; (4) that he participated in the conduct of the affairs of the
enterprise; and (5) that he participated through a pattern of racketeering
activity.
Summary
The passage from "U.S. v. Welch" provides a clear explanation of the
elements required to establish a RICO violation under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). It
emphasizes the need for at least two predicate acts of racketeering that are
related to the affairs of an enterprise, which must affect interstate
commerce. The passage also highlights the requirement for a common goal
or purpose in conducting the enterprise's affairs through a pattern of
racketeering activity. This directly supports the proposition by illustrating
how coordinated actions involving multiple predicate acts and a shared
objective can establish both the existence of an enterprise and a pattern of
racketeering activity.

(1985)
U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
RICO takes aim at 'racketeering activity,' which it defines as any act
'chargeable' under several generically described state criminal laws, any act
'indictable' under numerous specific federal criminal provisions, including
mail and wire fraud... Section 1962, entitled 'Prohibited Activities,' outlaws
the use of income derived from a 'pattern of racketeering activity' to acquire
an interest in or establish an enterprise engaged in or affecting interstate
commerce; the acquisition or maintenance of any interest in an enterprise
'through' a pattern of racketeering activity; conducting or participating in
the conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity; and
conspiring to violate any of these provisions... As many commentators have
pointed out, the definition of a 'pattern of racketeering activity' differs from
the other provisions in § 1961 in that it states that a pattern 'requires at
least two acts of racketeering activity,' § 1961(5) (emphasis added), not that
it 'means' two such acts. The implication is that while two acts are
necessary, they may not be sufficient... It is this factor of continuity plus
relationship which combines to produce a pattern.

Summary
RICO targets racketeering activity, which includes acts indictable under
federal criminal provisions such as mail and wire fraud. Section 1962(c)
prohibits conducting an enterprise's affairs through a pattern of
racketeering activity. The passage emphasizes that a pattern requires at
least two acts of racketeering activity, but these acts must also demonstrate
continuity and relationship to form a pattern. This supports the proposition
that defendants engaged in multiple predicate acts with a shared objective,
establishing both an enterprise and a pattern of racketeering activity.
Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., Inc., 741 F.2d 482 (2nd Cir. 1984)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Second Circuit
Extract
Section 1964(c) states that anyone 'injured' 'by reason of' a violation of
section 1962 is entitled to treble damages. Section 1962 'violations' include
conducting 'enterprises' 'through a pattern of racketeering'; a 'pattern of
racketeering' is defined by section 1961(5) as two or more 'acts of
racketeering' occurring within a given time. 'Acts of racketeering' are
defined by section 1961(1), inter alia, as any of a number of acts 'chargeable
under State law,' acts 'indictable' under a variety of federal laws, or an
'offense' under the federal securities law. Thus, ignoring for the moment
some troubling ambiguities, the statute on its surface seems to allow private
suits for people injured by defendants who have committed two so-called
predicate acts.
Summary
The passage explains that under RICO, a "pattern of racketeering activity"
requires at least two acts of racketeering, which can be acts chargeable
under state law or indictable under federal law. This supports the
proposition that defendants engaged in multiple predicate acts, as it clarifies
that such acts can form a pattern of racketeering activity if they are related
and continuous. The passage also highlights that section 1962 violations
include conducting enterprises through such a pattern, which aligns with
the proposition that defendants acted as an associated group with a common
purpose.

Extract
To engage in a 'pattern of racketeering activity,' the defendant must have
participated in 'at least two acts of racketeering activity, one of which
occurred after the effective date of [RICO] and the last of which occurred
within ten years (excluding any term of imprisonment) after the commission
of a prior act of racketeering activity.' 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5). Finally,
'enterprise' is defined under the statute as 'any individual, partnership,
corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of
individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.' Id. § 1961(c).
Summary
Clear explanation of what constitutes a "pattern of racketeering activity"
under RICO, requiring at least two acts of racketeering activity within a
specified timeframe. It also defines "enterprise" broadly to include various
forms of associations, which supports the proposition that defendants'
coordinated actions can establish both an enterprise and a pattern of
racketeering activity. This aligns with the proposition that defendants
engaged in multiple predicate acts with a shared objective, thus violating 18
U.S.C. § 1962(c).

The Supreme Court held in United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 101
S.Ct. 2524, 69 L.Ed.2d 246 (1981), that under section 1962(c) a RICO

purpose of engaging in a course of conduct.' Id.
Summary
The passage references the Supreme Court's interpretation in United States
v. Turkette, which clarifies that a RICO enterprise must be distinct from the
pattern of racketeering activity. It also defines a pattern of racketeering
activity as a series of criminal acts and an enterprise as a group of persons
associated for a common purpose. This supports the proposition by
establishing that defendants' coordinated actions, involving multiple
predicate acts and a shared objective, can constitute both an enterprise and
a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO.

Prudential Ins. Co. of America v. US Gypsum, 711 F. Supp. 1244 (D. N.J.
1989)
U.S. District Court — District of New Jersey
Extract
To state a claim under civil RICO, plaintiffs must allege that defendants are
(1) conducting (2) an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity (5) that has caused injury to plaintiff's business or property. Sedima,
SPRL v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479, 496, 105 S.Ct. 3275, 3285, 87 L.Ed.2d 346
(1985)... A single illegal scheme can constitute a pattern of racketeering
activity so long as the racketeering acts meet the 'continuity plus
relationship requirement,' that distinguishes a RICO pattern from a series of
isolated events that occur close in time.
Summary
To establish a RICO claim, plaintiffs must demonstrate that defendants
conducted an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity that
caused injury. The passage also clarifies that a single illegal scheme can
meet the RICO pattern requirement if it shows continuity and relationship
among the acts. This supports the proposition by indicating that multiple
predicate acts, when related and continuous, can establish a RICO pattern,
and that the defendants' coordinated actions can demonstrate the existence
of an enterprise.

The RICO statute defines “enterprise” to include “any union or group of
individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.” 18 U.S.C. §

enterprise's purpose.” Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938, 946, 129 S.Ct.
2237, 173 L.Ed.2d 1265 (2009). ... A pattern of racketeering activity

Summary
Legal definition of an "enterprise" under RICO, which includes any group of
individuals associated in fact, and outlines the structural features required
for such an enterprise. It also explains the requirement for a "pattern of
racketeering activity," which involves at least two related predicate acts
within a 10-year period. This directly supports the proposition by clarifying
the legal standards for establishing an enterprise and a pattern of
racketeering activity, which are central to proving a RICO violation.
Reynolds v. Condon, 908 F.Supp. 1494 (N.D. W.Va. 1996)
U.S. District Court — Northern District of West Virginia
Extract
Thus, to establish a RICO violation under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) a plaintiff must
demonstrate '(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of
racketeering activity that must include at least two racketeering acts.' ...
The court concludes here that there is no requirement that the common or
shared purpose of the 'RICO enterprise' in fact be the criminal or injurious
scheme of which the plaintiff complains, or even that the common or shared
purpose be illegal activity aimed at this or other victims; the enterprise need
only have a common or shared purpose, which may be legal or otherwise,
and may be related to the predicate acts or not, as the case may be, as well
as the other organizational characteristics of an enterprise, continuity of
structure and structure distinct from that inherent in a pattern of
racketeering activity.
Summary
Elements required to establish a RICO violation, which include conduct of an
enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity with at least two
predicate acts. It clarifies that the enterprise must have a common or shared
purpose, which does not necessarily have to be illegal. This supports the
proposition by confirming that defendants' coordinated actions, involving
multiple predicate acts and a shared objective, can establish both the
existence of an enterprise and a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO.

Extract
In order to secure a conviction under RICO, the Government must prove

racketeering activity.' The enterprise is an entity, for present purposes a
group of persons associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a
course of conduct. The pattern of racketeering activity is, on the other hand,
a series of criminal acts as defined by the statute. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1) (1976
ed., Supp. III). The former is proved by evidence of an ongoing organization,
formal or informal, and by evidence that the various associates function as a
continuing unit. The latter is proved by evidence of the requisite number of
acts of racketeering committed by the participants in the enterprise.
Summary
For a RICO conviction, the government must demonstrate both the existence
of an enterprise and a pattern of racketeering activity. An enterprise is
defined as a group of individuals associated for a common purpose, and a
pattern of racketeering activity involves a series of criminal acts. This aligns
with the proposition that defendants engaged in multiple predicate acts with
a shared objective, thus establishing both an enterprise and a pattern of
racketeering activity.

Count 1 and Count 2 of the indictment charge each of the appellants with,
respectively, substantive RICO and RICO conspiracy offenses, in violation of
18 U.S.C. Sec. 1962(c) and (d). 'Criminal liability under RICO is premised on
the commission of a 'pattern of racketeering activity,' defined by the statute

ten years (excluding any period of imprisonment) after the commission of a
prior act of racketeering activity.' 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1961(5) (emphasis added).
Summary
The court discusses the statutory requirements for establishing a RICO
violation, specifically the need for a pattern of racketeering activity, which
involves at least two related predicate acts within a specified timeframe.
This directly supports the proposition that defendants engaged in multiple
predicate acts as part of a coordinated effort, fulfilling the criteria for a
RICO violation.

RICO makes it 'unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any
enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign
commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of
such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.' 18 U.S.C.

continuing unit that functions with a common purpose. ... Such an
enterprise, we said, 'is proved by evidence of an ongoing organization,
formal or informal, and by evidence that the various associates function as a
continuing unit.'
Summary
The Supreme Court clarifies that an "enterprise" under RICO does not
require a formal structure but can be an informal association-in-fact that
functions with a common purpose. This supports the proposition that
defendants' coordinated actions, involving multiple predicate acts and a
shared objective, can establish both the existence of an enterprise and a
pattern of racketeering activity under RICO. The Court's interpretation
emphasizes that the enterprise can be proved by evidence of an ongoing
organization, whether formal or informal, and that the associates function as
a continuing unit.

activity... RICO renders criminally and civilly liable 'any person' who uses or
invests income derived 'from a pattern of racketeering activity' to acquire an

Summary
The U.S. Supreme Court has clarified the requirements for establishing a
"pattern of racketeering activity" under RICO. The Court emphasized that
both "relationship" and "continuity" must be demonstrated, meaning the
predicate acts must be related and either constitute or threaten long-term
criminal activity. This interpretation supports the proposition that
defendants' coordinated actions, involving multiple predicate acts and a
shared objective, can establish both the existence of an enterprise and a
pattern of racketeering activity under RICO.

Summary
18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) specifically prohibits individuals associated with an
enterprise engaged in interstate commerce from conducting or participating
in the enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity. This
directly supports the proposition that defendants, by engaging in multiple

As used in this chapter- 'racketeering activity' means (A) any act or threat
involving murder, kidnapping, gambling, arson, robbery, bribery, extortion,
dealing in obscene matter, or dealing in a controlled substance or listed
chemical (as defined in section 102 of the Controlled Substances Act), which
is chargeable under State law and punishable by imprisonment for more
than one year; (B) any act which is indictable under any of the following
provisions of title 18, United States Code: ... section 1343 (relating to wire
fraud), ... section 1956 (relating to the laundering of monetary
instruments), ... section 1503 (relating to obstruction of justice), ... 'pattern

entity, and any union or group of individuals associated in fact although not
a legal entity;
Summary
The passage defines "racketeering activity" to include acts such as wire
fraud, money laundering, and obstruction of justice, which are relevant
predicate acts under RICO. It also defines a "pattern of racketeering
activity" as requiring at least two acts of racketeering activity within a
specified time frame. Additionally, it defines "enterprise" to include groups
of individuals associated in fact, which supports the notion of defendants
acting as an associated group with a common purpose. These definitions are
directly relevant to establishing both the existence of an enterprise and a
pattern of racketeering activity under RICO.
18 U.S.C. § 1343 18 U.S.C. § 1343 Fraud By Wire, Radio, Or Television
Extract
Whoever, having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to
defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent
pretenses, representations, or promises, transmits or causes to be
transmitted by means of wire, radio, or television communication in
interstate or foreign commerce, any writings, signs, signals, pictures, or
sounds for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice, shall be fined
under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both.
Summary
18 U.S.C. § 1343 defines wire fraud as a federal crime involving the use of
wire, radio, or television communication in interstate or foreign commerce
to execute a scheme to defraud. This statute is relevant to the proposition
because wire fraud is considered a predicate act under the Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). The passage supports the
proposition by establishing that the defendants' use of wire communications
to further a fraudulent scheme can be considered a predicate act of
racketeering activity, which is necessary to demonstrate a pattern of
racketeering activity under RICO.

proceeds of specified unlawful activity... shall be sentenced to a fine of not
more than $500,000 or twice the value of the property involved in the

transaction, whichever is greater, or imprisonment for not more than twenty
years, or both. For purposes of this paragraph, a financial transaction shall
be considered to be one involving the proceeds of specified unlawful activity
if it is part of a set of parallel or dependent transactions, any one of which
involves the proceeds of specified unlawful activity, and all of which are part
of a single plan or arrangement.
Summary
The passage from 18 U.S.C. § 1956 outlines the criminal offense of money
laundering, which involves conducting financial transactions with the
proceeds of unlawful activities. It specifies that such transactions are
considered part of a single plan or arrangement if they are parallel or
dependent, which aligns with the concept of a pattern of racketeering
activity under RICO. This supports the proposition by providing a legal basis
for considering multiple related financial transactions as part of a
coordinated effort, which is essential for establishing a pattern of
racketeering activity.

Extract
RICO applies only where the commission of two predicate acts constitutes a
'pattern of racketeering activity.' (43) While the statutory definition of
'pattern of racketeering activity' requires at least two acts of racketeering
occurring within ten years of each other, (44) simply proving two acts may
not be sufficient to establish a RICO violation. (45) The Supreme Court has
stated that a 'pattern of racketeering' can only be established if the
predicate acts are continuous and interrelated. (46) Thus, 'two isolated acts
of racketeering do not constitute a pattern.' (47)... Section 1962(c) prohibits
persons employed by or associated with an enterprise from conducting or
participating in the conduct or the affairs of that enterprise through a
pattern of racketeering activity. (149) A relationship between the pattern of
racketeering activity and the enterprise is required.
Summary
To establish a RICO violation under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), it is necessary to
demonstrate a pattern of racketeering activity, which involves at least two
predicate acts that are continuous and interrelated. Additionally, there must
be a relationship between these acts and the enterprise. The passage
supports the proposition by explaining the legal requirements for proving a
pattern of racketeering activity and the involvement of an enterprise, which
aligns with the defendants' coordinated actions and shared objectives.

against individuals associated with an enterprise from engaging in a pattern
of racketeering activity. The passage highlights the requirement of a
relationship between the pattern of racketeering activity and the enterprise,
which aligns with the proposition that defendants engaged in multiple
predicate acts as part of a coordinated effort within an enterprise.

Section 1962(c) prohibits persons employed by or associated with an
enterprise from conducting or participating in the conduct or the affairs of
that enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. (158) A
relationship between the pattern of racketeering activity and the enterprise
is required. (159) ... 18 U.S.C. [section] 1962(c) (&#34;It shall be unlawful

for any person ... associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities
of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to ... participate ... in the
conduct of such enterprise&#39;s affairs through a pattern of racketeering
activity....&#34;) (emphasis added).
Summary
The passage clearly outlines that 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) prohibits individuals
associated with an enterprise from participating in its affairs through a
pattern of racketeering activity. It emphasizes the necessity of a relationship
between the racketeering activity and the enterprise, which aligns with the
proposition that defendants engaged in multiple predicate acts as part of a
coordinated effort. The passage also highlights the requirement that the
enterprise's activities affect interstate commerce, which is a critical element
in establishing a RICO violation.

Extract
RICO applies only where the commission of two predicate acts constitutes a
'pattern of racketeering activity.' (43) While the statutory definition of
'pattern of racketeering activity' requires at least two acts of racketeering
occurring within ten years of each other, (44) simply proving two acts may
not be sufficient to establish a RICO violation. (45) The Supreme Court has
stated that a 'pattern of racketeering' can only be established if the
predicate acts are continuous and interrelated. (46) Thus, 'two isolated acts
of racketeering do not constitute a pattern.' (47) ... Section 1962(c) prohibits
persons employed by or associated with an enterprise from conducting or
participating in the conduct or the affairs of that enterprise through a
pattern of racketeering activity. (150)
Summary
For a RICO violation under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), there must be a pattern of
racketeering activity, which requires at least two predicate acts that are
continuous and interrelated. The passage also clarifies that merely having
two acts is insufficient unless they demonstrate continuity and a
relationship. Additionally, the passage explains that § 1962(c) specifically
prohibits conducting or participating in an enterprise's affairs through such
a pattern, which aligns with the proposition that defendants engaged in
multiple predicate acts with a shared objective.

Extract
To prosecute a defendant under RICO, the government must prove that the
defendant: (i) through the commission of two or more acts constituting a
pattern of racketeering activity; (ii) directly or indirectly invested in,
maintained an interest in, or participated in, an enterprise; (iii) the activities
of which affected interstate or foreign commerce... A RICO offense requires
two or more predicate acts of 'racketeering activity'... The Supreme Court
has stated that a 'pattern of racketeering' can only be established if the
predicate acts are continuous and interrelated... Section 1962(c) prohibits
persons employed by or associated with an enterprise from conducting or
participating in the conduct or the affairs of that enterprise through a
pattern of racketeering activity.
Summary
Elements required to establish a RICO offense, including the need for two or
more predicate acts that are continuous and interrelated, participation in an
enterprise, and an effect on interstate commerce. It also highlights the
prohibition under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) against conducting an enterprise's
affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity. This directly supports the
proposition by explaining the legal framework and requirements for proving
a RICO violation, which aligns with the defendants' alleged actions.
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.
American Criminal Law Review - Georgetown University Law Center -
Bailey, Lisa Pritchard - 1999-06-22
Extract
Section 1962(c) prohibits persons employed by or associated with an
enterprise from conducting or participating in the conduct or the affairs of
that enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. This requires a
relationship between the pattern of racketeering activity and the enterprise.
In Reves v. Ernst & Young, the Supreme Court held that the requisite nexus
exists only when the defendant's predicate acts 'rise to the level' of
participation in the management or operation of the enterprise. Although
RICO liability does not rest solely upon those with primary responsibility for
the enterprise's affairs, to 'conduct or participate' in the affairs of the
enterprise, one must play some role in directing the affairs of the enterprise.
Summary
There must be a relationship between the racketeering activity and the
enterprise, and that participation in the enterprise's affairs can include roles

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
in management or operation. This supports the proposition by establishing
the legal framework under which defendants' coordinated actions and
shared objectives can be seen as participating in an enterprise's affairs
through a pattern of racketeering activity.

Bourgeois, Richard L., Jr. - 2000-03-22
Extract
A recurring issue is the type and sufficiency of proof the government must
offer to establish the existence of a RICO enterprise. Although the circuits
have not adopted a uniform definition of enterprise, they do require that the
charged RICO enterprise, in order to distinguish it from a conspiracy, have
some structure. A more specific definition requires that a RICO enterprise
exhibit three characteristics: (1) a common or shared purpose; (2) some
continuity of structure and personnel; and (3) an ascertainable structure
distinct from that inherent in a pattern of racketeering.
Summary
To establish a RICO enterprise, there must be proof of a common or shared
purpose, continuity of structure and personnel, and an ascertainable
structure distinct from the pattern of racketeering. This supports the
proposition by outlining the necessary elements to prove the existence of an
enterprise and a pattern of racketeering activity, which are central to the
RICO statute.

American Criminal Law Review - Georgetown University Law Center -

Extract
RICO applies only to those injuries resulting from commission of predicate
acts constituting a “pattern of racketeering activity.” The statutory definition
of “pattern of racketeering activity” requires at least two predicate acts
occurring within ten years of each other. A “pattern of racketeering activity”
also requires evidence that the predicate acts are continuous and
interrelated, rather than isolated and sporadic. A plaintiff can satisfy RICO’s
pattern requirement two ways: by alleging a long-running series of
interrelated predicate acts constituting a closed-ended conspiracy; or by
alleging at least two interrelated predicate acts and the distinct threat of
continued racketeering activities, demonstrating an open-ended conspiracy.

=== PAGE 27 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
To establish a RICO violation under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), there must be a
pattern of racketeering activity, which involves at least two predicate acts
that are continuous and interrelated. The passage explains that these acts
must not be isolated or sporadic, and they can demonstrate either a closed-
ended or open-ended conspiracy. This directly supports the proposition that
the defendants engaged in multiple predicate acts with a shared objective,
establishing both an enterprise and a pattern of racketeering activity.
Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy
The Brief - American Bar Association - 2024-01-01
Extract
A violation of § 1962(c), the section on which Sedima relies, requires (1)
conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity. The plaintiff must allege each of the elements to state a claim. They
are all equally essential components, and the complaint will fail if any one of
them is not adequately pleaded. In particular, RICO claims based on mail or
wire fraud must comport with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b)’s
requirement that allegations involving fraud be pleaded with particularity.
The practitioner through their pleadings must articulate with great care and
attention a viable racketeering claim. In addition, § 1962(a), (b), and (c) are
limited in scope to conduct involving enterprises engaged in or the activities
of which affect interstate commerce. It is the activities of the enterprise, not
each predicate act, that must affect interstate or foreign commerce. RICO
requires no more than a slight effect upon interstate commerce.
Summary
Essential elements required to establish a violation of § 1962(c), which
include conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity.
It emphasizes the need for particularity in pleading fraud-related predicate
acts, such as wire fraud, and highlights that the enterprise's activities must
affect interstate commerce, albeit minimally. This directly supports the
proposition by confirming the legal requirements for establishing a RICO
claim, including the need for multiple predicate acts and the existence of an
enterprise with a common purpose.

Extract
RICO is not just a tool for government control over organized crime. It is
also a remedial statute for civil matters. (31) It 'authorize[s]... criminal or
civil remedies on conduct already criminal, when performed in a specified
fashion' as delineated by the statute. (32) Section 1962 provides civil
remedies for four types of conduct: (1) using income derived from a pattern
of racketeering activity (33) to acquire an interest in an enterprise; (2)
acquiring or maintaining an interest in an enterprise through a pattern of
racketeering activity; (3) conducting the affairs of an enterprise through a
pattern of racketeering activity; and (4) conspiring to commit any of these
offenses. (34)
Summary
Civil remedies available under RICO, specifically under Section 1962, which
addresses the conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering
activity. This directly supports the proposition by highlighting that RICO
targets individuals who conduct or participate in an enterprise's affairs
through a pattern of racketeering activity, which includes multiple predicate
acts. The passage also emphasizes that RICO is applicable to both criminal
and civil matters, reinforcing its broad applicability to cases involving
organized crime and related activities.
Corporate Criminal Liability: End It, Don't Mend It.
The Journal of Corporation Law - University of Iowa Journal of
Corporation Law - Smith, Stephen F. - 2022-06-22
Extract
Subsection 1962(c), the most commonly used basis for substantive RICO
charges, is instructive. It imposes civil and criminal liability on the persons
'employed by or associated with' organized-crime syndicates or other RICO
'enterprises' who 'conduct, or participate in the conduct of, the [enterprise's]
affairs' through a 'pattern of racketeering activity.' ... Although it was
originally quite doubtful that purely criminal organizations could constitute
RICO enterprises, the Supreme Court has long endorsed that expansive
interpretation, which breathed new life into RICO by allowing prosecutors to
go directly after organized criminals without awaiting efforts to infiltrate
legitimate businesses. See United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 587
(1981) (holding that purely illegitimate groups can constitute RICO
enterprises).
Summary
RICO's Subsection 1962(c) is a key provision for imposing liability on
individuals associated with enterprises engaged in racketeering activities.
The passage highlights that the Supreme Court has interpreted RICO to

apply to purely criminal organizations, thus supporting the idea that
defendants acting as an associated group with a common purpose can be
prosecuted under RICO for engaging in a pattern of racketeering activity.
RECONCEIVING COERCION-BASED CRIMINAL DEFENSES.
Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology - Northwestern University,
School of Law - Galoob, Stephen R. - 2022-03-22
Extract
The inquiry here is meant to invoke the 'pattern of racketeering activity'
element of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).
The Organized Crime Control Act (1970), which includes RICO, provides that
'criminal conduct forms a pattern if it embraces criminal acts that have the
same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of
commission, or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics
and are not isolated events.' The Supreme Court characterized this
requirement as a 'relationship' element and held that the statute further
requires a 'continuity' element, 'referring either to a closed period of
repeated conduct, or to past conduct that by its nature projects into the
future with a threat of repetition.'
Summary
Detailed explanation of the "pattern of racketeering activity" requirement
under RICO, emphasizing the need for criminal acts to have similar
purposes, results, participants, or methods, and to be interrelated rather
than isolated. It also highlights the Supreme Court's interpretation of the
"relationship" and "continuity" elements, which are crucial for establishing a
pattern of racketeering activity. This directly supports the proposition by
explaining how multiple predicate acts can form a pattern under RICO.
Asset Forfeiture and Inequality.
Stanford Law Review - Stanford Law School - 2025-01-01
Extract
The first significant development to forfeiture law came with the 1970
enactment of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization (RICO)
Act. RICO is a federal criminal law 'aimed at curbing the criminal activity of
organized crime.' RICO expanded the legal processes through which assets
could be forfeited by creating the procedure of criminal asset forfeiture...
RICO expanded the reach of asset forfeiture by permitting the seizure and
forfeiture of not only contraband and instrumentalities of crime, but also of
'any interest ... acquired or maintained in violation of [RICO].' The Supreme
Court in 1983 clarified that the term 'any interest' in RICO included not only

=== PAGE 30 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
the defendant's interest in the criminal enterprise itself, but also the 'profits
and proceeds' the defendant derived from racketeering.
Summary
The RICO Act was designed to combat organized crime by allowing for the
forfeiture of assets obtained through racketeering activities. The passage
highlights the law's focus on criminal enterprises and the ability to seize
profits and proceeds from such activities, which aligns with the proposition
that defendants engaged in predicate acts as part of a coordinated group
with a common purpose.

Fourth, it requires criminalization of money laundering and requires
countries to expand the reach of their money-laundering statutes to make
certain that the predicate offenses associated with this Convention are
predicate offenses for the purposes of their money-laundering offenses.
Finally, the Convention requires criminalization of obstruction of justice
related to the offenses set forth in the Convention... but not limited to mail
and wire fraud, antitrust violations, conspiracy, and securities fraud,
depending upon the facts of a given case.
Summary
Requirement for criminalization of money laundering and obstruction of
justice, which are relevant predicate acts under RICO. It also mentions mail
and wire fraud, which are common predicate acts in RICO cases. The
context of the passage is a report on the United Nations Convention against
Corruption, which the U.S. adheres to, indicating that these acts are
recognized as serious offenses that can form part of a pattern of
racketeering activity. The scope is broad as it aligns with federal laws and
international obligations, supporting the proposition that such acts can
establish a pattern of racketeering activity.

'predicates.' A minimum of two predicate offences committed within 10
years of each other are necessary to constitute a 'pattern of racketeering'

securities fraud (§ 1344).
Summary
The RICO statute requires at least two predicate offenses within a 10-year
period to establish a pattern of racketeering activity. The passage also
clarifies that predicate offenses like wire fraud and money laundering are
included under RICO, supporting the proposition that defendants engaged in
such acts can be considered part of a pattern of racketeering activity. The
mention of extraterritorial application further supports the idea that RICO
can apply to coordinated actions with a shared objective, even if they involve
foreign elements.

USDOL Administrative Review Board Decisions
Extract
RICO, 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), prohibits 'any person employed by or associated
with any enterprise engaged in ... interstate or foreign commerce, to
conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such
enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.' The statute
thus requires the plaintiff to allege an enterprise, the conduct of the affairs
of the enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity, and injury to
[its] business or property ... caused by the violation of Section 1962.
Summary
The passage directly addresses the requirements under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c)
for establishing a RICO violation. It specifies that a plaintiff must allege an
enterprise, a pattern of racketeering activity, and an injury caused by the
violation. This aligns with the proposition that defendants engaged in
predicate acts as part of an enterprise with a common purpose, thus
supporting the existence of a RICO violation.
RICO: A Primer
Extract
Among other things, 'racketeering activities' include 'any act which is
indictable under' a list of federal criminal statutes. The list covers an
expansive range of violations, for example, violations of the Hobbs Act, 18
U.S.C. ' 1951 (extortion); 18 U.S.C. ' 1341 (mail fraud) and 1343 (wire fraud);
18 U.S.C. ' 1831 (economic espionage); 18 U.S.C. ' 1832 (theft of trade
secrets); 18 U.S.C. ' 1952 (Travel Act); 18 U.S.C. ' 1956, 1957 (money
laundering); and 18 U.S.C. ' 2318-2320 (copyright infringement). Mail and
wire fraud are the most common predicate acts. ... The racketeering acts
need not be similar or directly related to each other; rather, it is sufficient
that the racketeering acts are related in some way to the affairs of the
charged enterprise, including, for example, that: the racketeering acts
furthered the goals of or benefitted the enterprise, the enterprise or the
defendant's role in the enterprise enabled the defendant to commit, or
facilitated the commission of, the racketeering acts, the racketeering acts
were committed at the behest of, or on behalf of, the enterprise, or the
racketeering acts had the same or similar purposes, results, participants,
victims or methods of commission. ... Subsection (c) is, far and away, the
most often used and important substantive RICO provision. Under section
1962(c), it is a violation to conduct the affairs of an enterprise affecting
interstate or foreign commerce 'through' a pattern of racketeering activity
or through the alternative theory of collection of an unlawful debt.

=== PAGE 33 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
The passage outlines what constitutes "racketeering activities" under RICO,
including wire fraud and money laundering, which are relevant predicate
acts. It explains that these acts need not be similar but must be related to
the enterprise's affairs, supporting the idea of a pattern of racketeering
activity. Section 1962(c) specifically addresses conducting an enterprise's
affairs through such a pattern, which aligns with the proposition that
defendants engaged in multiple predicate acts with a common purpose.
RICO: A Primer
Extract
Mail and wire fraud are the most common predicate acts... The racketeering
acts need not be similar or directly related to each other; rather, it is
sufficient that the racketeering acts are related in some way to the affairs of
the charged enterprise... The continuity requirement is likewise satisfied
where the predicates are a regular way of conducting the defendant's
ongoing legitimate business... A plaintiff may demonstrate a pattern by
establishment that the predicate acts pose a threat of continued criminal
activity... Section 1962(c)... Under section 1962(c), it is a violation to
conduct the affairs of an enterprise affecting interstate or foreign commerce
'through' a pattern of racketeering activity... To prove a violation of Section
1962(c), a plaintiff must prove the following elements: Existence of an
enterprise; The enterprise engaged in, or its activities affected, interstate or
foreign commerce; The defendant was employed by or was associated with
the enterprise; The defendant conducted or participated, either directly or
indirectly, in the conduct of the affairs of the enterprise; and The defendant
participated in the affairs of the enterprise through a pattern of
racketeering activity...
Summary
The passage outlines the elements required to establish a violation of 18
U.S.C. § 1962(c), which includes demonstrating the existence of an
enterprise, its engagement in interstate commerce, and the defendant's
participation in the enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering
activity. The passage also clarifies that predicate acts, such as wire fraud
and money laundering, need not be similar but must be related to the
enterprise's affairs. This supports the proposition by showing how
defendants' coordinated actions and multiple predicate acts can establish
both an enterprise and a pattern of racketeering activity.

Extract
Smagin alleged that the defendants, led by Yegiazaryan, impeded Smagin's
collection of the California Judgment 'through a pattern of wire fraud and
other RICO predicate racketeering acts, including witness tampering and
obstruction of justice.'
Summary
The passage describes a case where defendants were alleged to have
engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity, including wire fraud, witness
tampering, and obstruction of justice. These are considered predicate acts
under RICO. The passage supports the proposition by illustrating how
multiple predicate acts, when related and continuous, can establish a
pattern of racketeering activity. The defendants' coordinated actions to
impede judgment collection demonstrate a shared objective, which aligns
with the concept of an enterprise under RICO.
Defending Civil RICO Claims: A Defense Plan Should Be In Every Business's
Arsenal
Extract
RICO is not a simple statute. It pertains to conduct associated with an
'enterprise' and 'a pattern racketeering activity.' An enterprise is an
individual or legal entity, or a union or group of individuals associated in fact
although not a legal entity, while a pattern of racketeering activity requires
long-term, organized conduct to violate state and federal laws. ... Second, to
prove most types of RICO claims, the plaintiff must plead that the defendant
committed some qualifying criminal action, the most common of which is
mail, wire or securities fraud. ... Third, the plaintiff must plead a pattern of
racketeering activity for most RICO claims. If the alleged conduct occurred
once or twice, or was not continuous, it cannot form a pattern of conduct
sufficient to support a RICO claim.
Summary
The passage explains the requirements for establishing a RICO claim,
including the need for an "enterprise" and a "pattern of racketeering
activity." It specifies that a pattern requires long-term, organized conduct
and that the plaintiff must prove qualifying criminal actions such as wire
fraud. This directly supports the proposition that defendants engaged in
multiple predicate acts and acted as an associated group with a common
purpose, fulfilling the criteria under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c).
The New White House Proposal To Seize Russian Assets: A Legal Analysis

=== PAGE 35 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
RICO is a valuable tool in prosecuting organized crime because it allows
prosecutors to join multiple defendants and crimes (that might otherwise
have to be tried separately) in a single case. This allows the judge and jury
to see the full range of criminal activity of the organization and its members,
making it easier for prosecutors to obtain convictions, longer sentences, and
forfeiture of assets. Thus, the proposal would allow prosecutors to join
IEEPA and ECRA violations with other charges such as wire fraud, mail
fraud, bribery, and money laundering and charge all those who had a
sufficient degree of participation in the underlying 'pattern of racketeering
activity' as part of a single 'racketeering enterprise.'
Summary
RICO is designed to address organized crime by allowing the consolidation
of multiple defendants and crimes into a single case. This consolidation
helps demonstrate the full scope of criminal activity and facilitates the
prosecution of a pattern of racketeering activity. The passage specifically
mentions the inclusion of wire fraud and money laundering as part of the
pattern of racketeering activity, which directly supports the proposition that
defendants engaged in multiple predicate acts as part of an enterprise.
