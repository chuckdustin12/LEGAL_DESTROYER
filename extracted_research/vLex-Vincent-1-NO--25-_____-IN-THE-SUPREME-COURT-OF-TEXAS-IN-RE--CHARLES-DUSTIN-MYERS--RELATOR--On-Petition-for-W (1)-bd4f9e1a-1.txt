Statement of the Case Nature of the Underlying Proceeding and Order
Complained Of This is an original proceeding seeking a writ of mandamus to
compel the Honorable Kenneth Newell, Presiding Judge of the 233rd Judicial
District Court, Tarrant County, Texas, to vacate his order dated April 11,
2025. This order granted a contested motion to consolidate Relator’s Suit
Affecting the Parent-Child Relationship (SAPCR), Cause No. 233-765358-25,
with a firstfiled divorce proceeding, Cause No. 322-744263-23, pending in
the 322nd Judicial District Court of Tarrant County. Respondent Judge The
Honorable Kenneth Newell, District Judge, 233rd Judicial District Court,
Tarrant County, Texas. His office is located at the Family Law Center, 200 E.
Weatherford St., 5th Floor, Fort Worth, TX 76196-0230. Respondent’s
Challenged Actions: Respondent granted Real Party in Interest’s contested
motion to consolidate the SAPCR (the later-filed case) into the divorce
proceeding (the first-filed case). This order was issued sua sponte as to its
timing and effect, without prior notice to Relator of an imminent ruling,
without a hearing on Relator’s timely filed objections to the consolidation,
and in direct contravention of Tarrant County Local Rule 4.01(8)(a), which
mandates that consolidation motions be filed and heard in the earliest-filed
case. Procedural History in the Court of Appeals Relator previously sought
mandamus relief from the Second District Court of Appeals, Fort Worth,
Texas, in Cause No. 02-25-00164-CV, challenging the Associate Judge’s
refusal to hear his Emergency Temporary Restraining Order in the SAPCR.
That petition was denied per curiam. The current petition for writ of
mandamus arises from the consolidation order issued by Respondent
moments after Relator filed the aforementioned mandamus in the court of
appeals. Relator also has two pending mandamus in this Court, cause Nos.
25-0361 & 25-0367, related to the underlying divorce matter. 7 Statement of
Jurisdiction STATEMENT OF JURISDICTION This Honorable Court has
jurisdiction to consider this original proceeding for writ of mandamus. Tex.
Const. art. V, § 3(a); Tex. Gov’t Code § 22.002. 8 Issue Presented Did the
Respondent clearly abuse his discretion, leaving Relator with no adequate
remedy by appeal, by sua sponte granting a contested motion to consolidate
a later-filed Suit Affecting the Parent-Child Relationship with a first-filed
divorce case, where such order was issued without prior notice to Relator,
without a hearing on Relator’s timely filed objections, and in direct violation
of a mandatory Tarrant County Local Rule requiring consolidation motions
to be filed and heard in the earliest-filed case? 9 Introduction This Petition
for Writ of Mandamus presents a case of profound and continuing injustice,
compelling Relator, Charles Dustin Myers, to seek this Court’s extraordinary
intervention. For over fifteen agonizing months, Relator has been ensnared
in a procedural labyrinth, his fundamental parental rights systematically

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
imperiled by a pattern of judicial actions that defy due process and the clear
mandates of Texas law. This is not a mere disagreement with a discretionary
ruling; it is a challenge to actions taken sua sponte, without notice, without
hearing, and in direct contravention of established legal safeguards,
culminating in an improper consolidation order that further entrenches the
denial of Relator’s access to a fair and timely resolution of matters critical to
his relationship with his children. This mandamus marks the third
concurrent petition before this Honorable Court, and in totality, spell out a
complete failure of the courts below to provide an adequate forum. The
circumstances detailed herein are not only extraordinary but also represent
an unprecedented disregard for the basic tenets of procedural fairness
within the very system designed to uphold them. Relator has diligently
pursued every available avenue to protect his rights and seek redress for the
clear abuses of discretion by the 233rd and 322nd District Courts of Tarrant
County. These efforts, however, have been met with a series of per curiam
denials from the Second Court 10 of Appeals, leaving Relator with no
answers and without an adequate remedy by an appeal, resulting in
continuous and ongoing irreparable harm. The challenged consolidation
order, issued moments after Relator sought mandamus relief from the Court
of Appeals concerning a related TRO denial, is the latest manifestation of a
judicial course that appears determined to frustrate appellate review and
perpetuate the denial of Relator’s rights. This Court’s intervention is not
merely sought to correct a single erroneous order, but to address a situation
where the lower courts’ actions, if left uncorrected, threaten to render
Relator’s substantive parental rights meaningless and undermine public
confidence in the integrity of the judicial process. The facts of this case cry
out for the exercise of this Court’s mandamus power to uphold the rule of
law, ensure fundamental fairness, and prevent the permanent loss of
Relator’s most precious rights. This petition demonstrates a clear abuse of
discretion for which no adequate appellate remedy exists, demanding this
Court’s immediate and decisive action to restore due process and rectify a
stunning departure from judicial propriety. A MOTION TO CONSOLIDATE
these three mandamus petitions will be filed by May 8th, 2025, to provide
this Court with the full context of this matter, the efforts put forth by the
Relator, and to showcase the silence and lack of engagement from the
opposing party and trial courts below. 11 STATEMENT OF FACTS This case
arises from a deeply troubling sequence of procedural events in underlying
family law matters involving Relator, Charles Dustin Myers, and his children.
The facts, meticulously supported by the record, paint a picture of Relator’s
persistent efforts to protect his parental rights and seek due process, met
with actions by the 233rd District Court of Tarrant County and its Associate
Judge that give rise to this petition. See In Re: Myers, No. 25-0367 (Tex.
pending). On March 18, 2025, Relator initiated an original Suit Affecting the
ParentChild Relationship (SAPCR), providing a comprehensive cover letter
detailing his legal position. R. 1.0-1.18; R. 2.1-2.11. Accompanying this filing
was an Application for Emergency Injunctive Relief, which outlined the
series of events spanning from December 15, 2023, to the present day. R.
3.1-3.31. This application included numerous exhibits evidencing concerning
issues such as badfaith actions by the opposing party, (R. 3.33-3.37)
problematic third-party involvement (R. 3.38-R. 3.41), a decline in the eldest
child’s academic performance, (R. 3.44-3.45) and signs of medical neglect
concerning the youngest child R. 3.46-3.47. Despite months of inactivity in

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
the first-filed divorce matter, the opposing party answered the SAPCR suit
merely two days after its filing R. 4.1-4.5. Shortly 12 thereafter, a motion to
consolidate the SAPCR with the divorce case was filed by the opposing party
in the 233rd District Court. R. 5.0-5.4 In response to these developments
and to protect his procedural rights, Relator moved to strike certain
pleadings (R.6.1-6.10) and filed a Rule 12 motion against opposing counsel
R. 7.1-7.14. No response was ever filed to these motions. Faced with
ongoing harm and the urgent need to care for his children, Relator then filed
for an Emergency Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) seeking to prevent
the Real Party in Interest from barring the Relator from his residence. R.
8.1-8.31. See also R. 12.15. (Relator providing merits of TRO to opposing
party) The attempt to secure a hearing on this critical TRO was summarily
thwarted despite following proper procedure. R. 12.9; 12.12-12.13. Relator
was denied the opportunity to even present his motion in the courtroom.
Instead, he left with only the Court Coordinator’s initials regarding a
hearing scheduled for April 10, 2024, a hearing that was subsequently un-
set by the Associate Judge without explanation or rescheduling. See In Re:
Charles Dustin Myers, No. 02-25-00164- CV; see also R.12.29. The decision
to refuse to hear Relator’s emergency motion was based on an out-of-court
statement made by opposing counsel, who was not even present in the
courtroom at the time R.12.20. A forward-looking motion related to these
matters was not filed by the opposing party until a week later, on April 3,
2025 R.13-13.2. Subsequently, the 13 opposing party attempted to have a
motion signed by the court without addressing Relator’s timely filed
objections R.12.31, an attempt Relator was forced to rebut R.12.32. No
further correspondence was received from opposing counsel on this matter.
Having been denied a hearing on his emergency TRO, Relator formally
informed the 233rd District Court of his intention to seek mandamus relief
from the Second Court of Appeals regarding this outright denial (R.
14-14.18) and provided a statement of facts recapping the situation. R.
14.4-14.6. Relator then prepared and, on April 11, 2025, filed his petition for
writ of mandamus with the Second Court of Appeals (See In re: Charles
Dustin Myers, No. 02-25-00164-CV, challenging the TRO denial). In a
striking turn of events, mere moments after Relator sought this appellate
oversight, he was served with an order, signed by the Respondent Judge of
the 233rd District Court, granting the opposing party’s contested motion to
consolidate. This consolidation order was issued sua sponte as to its timing
and effect, without notice to Relator of any imminent ruling, without a
hearing on the consolidation motion itself, and without addressing Relator’s
timely filed objections to the consolidation R.15-15.1. Relator promptly
moved for en banc reconsideration of the Second Court of Appeals'
subsequent per curiam denial of his TRO mandamus, but this too was denied
without any substantive reasoning, 14 marking the ninth such summary per
curiam denial Relator has faced from that court concerning the same set of
underlying facts and without any opposition from the opposing party or the
judges below. This mandamus petition to the Supreme Court of Texas
concerning the improper consolidation order necessarily followed. Summary
of Argument The Second Court of Appeals per curiam denials cannot be
reconciled with Texas jurisprudence.1 Respondent’s sua sponte grant of a
contested motion to consolidate after the refusal to hear an un-contested
emergency TRO by his Associate Judge constitutes an abuse of discretion
that has left Relator without an adequate appellate remedy. Relator, Charles

Worth May 1, 2025, orig. proceeding) (per curiam) (denying en banc
reconsideration). 15 addressing Relator’s timely filed objections. The
Respondent’s actions constitute a clear abuse of discretion for at least two
fundamental reasons: first, the consolidation order directly violates Tarrant
County Local Rule 4.01(8)(a), which mandates that consolidation motions be
filed and heard in the earliest-filed case—a rule the Respondent had no
discretion to ignore. Second, the denial of notice and an opportunity to be
heard on a contested, potentially case-dispositive motion is a fundamental
violation of due process. Relator lacks an adequate remedy by appeal. The
improper consolidation, effected under highly prejudicial circumstances
(including the prior refusal of the Associate Judge to hear Relator’s
emergency TRO and the suspicious timing of the consolidation order itself,
issued moments after Relator sought mandamus relief from the Court of
Appeals concerning the TRO denial), creates extraordinary circumstances.
Forcing Relator to proceed through trial based on this voidable order would
result in wasted judicial and personal resources, subject Relator to ongoing
irreparable harm concerning his fundamental parental rights, and present
insurmountable difficulties in demonstrating harm on appeal from
proceedings tainted by such clear procedural error. The consistent per
curiam denials by the Second Court of Appeals, without addressing the
merits of Relator’s well-founded complaints, further underscore the
inadequacy of ordinary appellate remedies and 16 the necessity of this
Court’s intervention to uphold the rule of law and ensure Relator receives a
fair process before his rights are irrevocably prejudiced. Argument
Mandamus relief is an extraordinary but essential remedy to correct clear
abuses of discretion by a trial court when no adequate appellate remedy
exists. In re Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., 148 S.W.3d 124, 135-36 (Tex. 2004)
(orig. proceeding). The circumstances of this case unequivocally meet this
high standard, demanding this Court’s intervention to prevent manifest
injustice and uphold the integrity of judicial proceedings. I. Standard for
Mandamus review. Mandamus relief is available where the trial court’s error
“constitute[s] a clear abuse of discretion” and the relator lacks “an adequate
remedy by appeal.” Walker v. Packer, 827 S.W.2d 833, 839 (Tex. 1992) (orig.
proceeding). A trial court clearly abuses its discretion if it reaches a decision
so arbitrary and unreasonable as to amount to a clear and prejudicial error
of law, or if it clearly fails to analyze or apply the law correctly to the facts.

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Id. at 839-40; In re Cerberus Capital Mgmt., L.P., 164 S.W.3d 379, 382 (Tex.
2005) (orig. proceeding). A trial court has no discretion in determining what
the law is or applying the law to the facts. Walker, 827 S.W.2d at 840. Thus,
“a clear failure by the trial court to analyze or apply the 17 law correctly will
constitute an abuse of discretion.” Id. Both elements for mandamus relief
are met here. II. Respondent clearly abused his discretion when he granted
a contested consolidation motion sua sponte, without notice, without a
hearing, and in clear violation of local rules. The actions of the 233rd
District Court, through its Presiding Judge, Respondent, constitute a clear
and reversible abuse of discretion for at least two fundamental reasons:
first, the consolidation order directly violates mandatory Tarrant County
Local Rules, and second, the manner of its issuance—sua sponte, without
notice to Relator, without a hearing, and without addressing Relator’s timely
filed objections—is a profound denial of fundamental due process. A.
Extraordinary circumstances exist warranting mandamus review While
mandamus typically does not lie from a trial court’s consolidation order
because such orders usually do not threaten a party’s substantial rights, this
Court has recognized that “if an ordinary appeal is inadequate because
extraordinary circumstances exist, mandamus relief may be appropriate.” In
re Van Waters & Rogers, Inc., 145 S.W.3d 203, 210-11 (Tex. 2004) (orig.
proceeding). Extraordinary circumstances are present when the appellate
remedy is inadequate because, inter alia, “the party is in danger of
permanently losing substantial rights,” “the error cannot be cured on
appeal,” or “the party’s ability to present a 18 viable claim or defense is
vitiated.” Id. at 211. Such circumstances are manifest here. The Tarrant
County Local Rules are unequivocal. Local Rule 4.01(8)(a) mandates that
“every motion to . . . consolidate . . . shall be filed in the earliestfiled case
and the motion shall be heard in the earliest-filed case.” (emphasis added).
This rule is not merely advisory but a directive ensuring orderly case
management and has the force of law. See In re Christus Spohn Hosp.
Kleberg, 222 S.W.3d 434, 437 (Tex. 2007) (orig. proceeding) (trial courts are
required to follow local rules). Here, the underlying divorce matter (Cause
No. 322-744263-23), pending in the 322nd District Court, is the first-filed
case. The SAPCR (Cause No. 233-765358-25) was filed later in the 233rd
District Court. Despite the clear mandate of Local Rule 4.01(8)(a), and the
fact that the consolidation motion was filed in both Courts, Respondent in
the 233rd District Court (the later-filed case) granted the motion. This action
directly contravenes the local first-filed rule, an act for which the trial court
had no discretion. Walker, 827 S.W.2d at 840. B. The respondent had no
discretion to violate local rules or deny due process. Furthermore,
Respondent granted the consolidation motion sua sponte as to its timing and
effect, without providing Relator notice or an opportunity for a hearing on
his timely filed objections. This deprived Relator of his fundamental right to
due process. A trial court has no discretion to ignore or misapply clear local
19 rules or to deny a party due process. See In re J.B. Hunt Transp., Inc.,
492 S.W.3d 287, 299-300 (Tex. 2016) (orig. proceeding) (due process
requires notice and an opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a
meaningful manner). The Respondent’s decision to grant consolidation in
the later-filed case, particularly under these circumstances—sua sponte,
without notice or hearing on Relator’s objections, and with the effect of
centralizing proceedings before a court that had previously demonstrated a
reluctance to afford Relator emergency relief— constitutes a clear abuse of

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
discretion. The timing and manner of this consolidation, occurring
immediately after Relator sought mandamus relief from the Associate
Judge’s refusal to hear his TRO, strongly suggests that this procedural
maneuver was intended to circumvent appellate oversight and further
entrench the existing denial of Relator’s access to justice. III. Relator lacks
an adequate appellate remedy. An appellate remedy is inadequate when a
party is in real danger of losing substantial rights, Perry v. Del Rio, 66 S.W.
3d 239, 257 (Tex. 2001) (orig. proceeding), or when the trial court’s error is
such that it cannot be effectively cured on appeal, potentially leading to
wasted judicial resources and irreparable harm to the litigant. See In re
McAllen Med. Ctr., Inc., 275 S.W.3d 458, 469 (Tex. 2008) (orig. proceeding);
In re Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., 148 S.W.3d at 136. 20 In this case, the
Respondent’s sua sponte consolidation order, issued without notice, hearing,
and in violation of local rules, presents precisely such a scenario. Relator’s
substantial rights, particularly his fundamental parental rights and his right
to a fair process in the determination of those rights, are directly imperiled.
The improper consolidation forces Relator to litigate critical issues
concerning his children in a procedural posture tainted by clear legal error
and apparent judicial resistance to affording him due process. Forcing
Relator to endure a full trial under these circumstances, only to argue on
appeal that the consolidation was improper, is not an adequate remedy. The
prejudice from such a procedurally flawed consolidation, especially in a
sensitive family law context involving custody of children, is difficult to
quantify and may be impossible to fully “untangle” on appeal. See Dal-Briar
Corp. v. Baskette, 833 S.W.2d 612, 616 (Tex. App.—El Paso 1992, orig.
proceeding) (noting difficulty in showing harm from improper consolidation
after trial). Furthermore, the history of this case, including the prior denial
to hear a motion requesting emergency relief based on ex parte
communications and the pattern of per curiam denials from the appellate
court without substantive review, demonstrates that ordinary appellate
processes have thus far failed to provide Relator with a meaningful
opportunity to be heard or to correct clear abuses of discretion. The
challenged consolidation order is not an isolated incident but part 21 of a
continuing course of conduct that effectively denies Relator due process and
access to justice, specifically his ability to protect his relationship with his
daughters and ensure their well-being. Waiting for a final appeal would
subject Relator to further irreparable harm, including the continued
deprivation of his parental rights and the significant expense and burden of
a trial predicated on a voidable order. This Court has recognized that
mandamus is appropriate to spare parties and the public the expense of a
trial and appeal when the trial court’s ruling is a clear abuse of discretion
that an appellate court would likely correct. See In re USAA, 307 S.W.3d
299, 314 (Tex. 2010) (orig. proceeding). The circumstances here cry out for
such intervention to prevent further injustice and the needless expenditure
of judicial and personal resources on proceedings founded upon clear and
prejudicial error. CONCLUSION For the reasons stated, Respondent clearly
abused his discretion by granting the contested consolidation motion sua
sponte, without notice, without a hearing, without addressing Relator’s
objections, and in violation of Tarrant County Local Rules. Relator lacks an
adequate remedy by appeal due to the extraordinary circumstances
presented and the inability of a final appeal to cure the prejudice caused by
these procedural violations. Relator respectfully requests that this Court

10:58:49 AM Status NOT SENT NOT SENT NOT SENT Did Judge Kenneth
Newell sign a consolidation motion in favor of opposing counsel without a
hearing, sua sponte, in the wrong court, immediately after denying the
complainant access to the court, and does this conduct violate Texas law or
judicial ethics?
Answer (Texas)
Short response
Judge Kenneth Newell’s action in signing a contested consolidation order
sua sponte, without notice or hearing, and in the wrong court, appears to
violate both Texas law and judicial ethics, as it disregards mandatory local
rules and fundamental due process requirements. Such conduct constitutes
a clear abuse of discretion and is subject to correction by mandamus.
Summary
The facts indicate that Judge Newell granted a contested motion to
consolidate two family law cases—one a Suit Affecting the Parent-Child
Relationship (SAPCR) and the other a divorce—without providing notice or a
hearing to the complainant, and did so in the later-filed court rather than the
earliest-filed court as required by Tarrant County Local Rule 4.01(8)(a).
Texas law, as interpreted by the courts, requires strict adherence to local
rules and due process, including notice and an opportunity to be heard
before a court takes action on contested matters.
Case law establishes that a trial court abuses its discretion when it acts
arbitrarily, unreasonably, or in disregard of guiding rules or principles,
especially where due process is denied. The combination of violating a
mandatory local rule, denying notice and hearing, and acting in a manner
that prejudices a party’s substantial rights meets the threshold for
mandamus relief and raises serious concerns under Texas judicial ethics.

Background and Relevant Law
Tarrant County Local Rule 4.01(8)(a)
Tarrant County Local Rule 4.01(8)(a) mandates that every motion to
consolidate must be filed and heard in the earliest-filed case. This rule is
designed to ensure orderly case management and prevent forum shopping
or procedural gamesmanship. The rule is not merely advisory; it has the
force of law within the county and must be followed by all district courts in
Tarrant County.
Texas Rules of Civil Procedure 174(a)
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 174(a) grants trial courts broad discretion to
consolidate cases involving common questions of law or fact. However, this
discretion is not unlimited and must be exercised in a manner that furthers
convenience, avoids prejudice, and promotes justice. The rule does not
override local rules or due process requirements.
Due Process
Fundamental due process under Texas law requires that parties receive
notice and an opportunity to be heard before the court rules on contested
matters that affect their substantial rights. The denial of these rights
constitutes a clear abuse of discretion and may be remedied by mandamus.
Case Law
Texas appellate courts have repeatedly held that a trial court abuses its
discretion when it acts arbitrarily, unreasonably, or in disregard of guiding
rules or principles, including local rules and due process requirements.
Several cases are directly on point:
In In re Shumate, 13-23-00150-CV (Tex. App. May 18, 2023), the court
held that a trial court abuses its discretion when it disregards guiding
rules or acts arbitrarily, and that mandamus may be appropriate where
an appeal is inadequate to address an improper consolidation order.
In re Romo, NUMBER 13-20-00440-CV (Tex. App. Mar 29, 2021)
reiterates that a trial court’s decision is an abuse of discretion if it is
arbitrary, unreasonable, or fails to correctly apply the law.
In re Shell Oil Co., 202 S.W.3d 286 (Tex. App. 2006) clarifies that while
courts have broad discretion to consolidate, this discretion is not
unlimited and must be exercised to avoid manifest injustice.
In re Van Waters & Rogers, Inc., 145 S.W.3d 203 (Tex. 2004) holds that
mandamus relief is appropriate when a consolidation order threatens
substantial rights or when extraordinary circumstances make an
ordinary appeal inadequate.
In re Acceptance Insurance Co., 33 S.W.3d 443 (Tex. App. 2000) and 
Dal-Briar Corp. v. Baskette, 833 S.W.2d 612 (Tex. App. 1992) (noting
subsequent abrogation, discussed below) both emphasize that

mandamus is proper to correct a clear abuse of discretion, especially
where due process rights such as notice are denied.
Analysis
Violation of Local Rule
The record shows that the motion to consolidate was granted by Judge
Newell in the 233rd District Court, which was the later-filed case, rather
than in the earliest-filed case as required by Tarrant County Local Rule
4.01(8)(a). This is a direct violation of the local rule, which is binding on the
court. Texas courts have held that a trial court has no discretion to disregard
mandatory local rules; doing so is a clear abuse of discretion (Walker v.
Packer, 827 S.W.2d 833, 839 (Tex. 1992), as cited in multiple cases above).
Lack of Notice and Hearing
The facts further indicate that the order was issued sua sponte, without
notice to the complainant and without a hearing on the contested motion.
Texas law is clear that due process requires notice and an opportunity to be
heard before a court rules on a contested matter affecting substantial rights
(In re Acceptance Insurance Co., 33 S.W.3d 443 (Tex. App. 2000)). The
denial of these rights is itself a clear abuse of discretion and grounds for
mandamus relief.
Abuse of Discretion and Mandamus
The combination of violating a mandatory local rule and denying due
process constitutes a clear abuse of discretion. The Texas Supreme Court
and courts of appeals have repeatedly held that such conduct is subject to
correction by mandamus, especially where an ordinary appeal would be
inadequate to remedy the harm (In re Van Waters & Rogers, Inc., 145 S.W.3d
203 (Tex. 2004); In re Shumate, 13-23-00150-CV (Tex. App. May 18, 2023)).
The facts here—where the consolidation order was issued immediately after
the complainant sought appellate relief for denial of access to the court—
underscore the extraordinary circumstances justifying mandamus.
Prejudice and Substantial Rights
Improper consolidation, especially in family law cases involving parental
rights, can result in irreparable harm that cannot be adequately remedied
on appeal. The prejudice is compounded when the order is issued in
violation of local rules and without due process, as it undermines the
integrity of the proceedings and the party’s ability to protect their rights (In
re Shell Oil Co., 202 S.W.3d 286 (Tex. App. 2006); Dal-Briar Corp. v.
Baskette, 833 S.W.2d 612 (Tex. App. 1992)).

=== PAGE 13 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Judicial Ethics
While the provided materials do not include specific judicial ethics opinions,
Texas judicial ethics require judges to uphold the law, act impartially, and
ensure that all parties receive fair process. Disregarding mandatory rules
and denying a party notice and a hearing, particularly in a manner that
appears to retaliate for seeking appellate review, raises serious ethical
concerns and may constitute a violation of the Texas Code of Judicial
Conduct.
Negative Treatment of Dal-Briar
It is important to note that Dal-Briar Corp. v. Baskette, 833 S.W.2d 612 (Tex.
App. 1992) has been abrogated by a later case (Eagle Fabricators Inc. v.
Raymond Rakowitz D/B/A Redline Welding & Steel Serv., 344 S.W.3d 414
(Tex. App. 2011)). However, the abrogation relates to the standard for
showing harm from improper consolidation after trial, not to the core
principle that a clear abuse of discretion is subject to mandamus. The other
authorities cited above remain good law and support the analysis.
Exceptions and Caveats
There may be rare circumstances where a court’s failure to follow a local
rule or provide notice and hearing could be excused, such as in true
emergencies or where the party’s rights are not substantially affected.
However, no such circumstances appear in the present facts. The violation of
both the local rule and due process requirements, especially in a contested
and prejudicial context, leaves little room for justification.
Conclusion
Judge Kenneth Newell’s action in granting a contested consolidation motion
sua sponte, without notice or hearing, and in the wrong court, constitutes a
clear abuse of discretion under Texas law. This conduct violates both
mandatory local rules and fundamental due process, and is subject to
correction by mandamus. The facts also raise serious concerns under Texas
judicial ethics, as judges are required to uphold the law and ensure fair
process for all parties. The complainant is entitled to relief, and the
consolidation order should be vacated.

Walker v. Packer, 827 S.W.2d 833, 839 (Tex. 1992); Johnson v. Fourth Court
of Appeals, 700 S.W.2d 916, 917 (Tex. 1985). This standard is satisfied where
the trial court 'effectively deprive[s] [the relator] of its fundamental due
process right to notice. .. .' In re L.A.M. & Assocs., 975 S.W.2d 80, 83 (Tex.
App. San Antonio 1998, orig. proceeding) (quoting from Union Carbide
Corp. v. Moye, 798 S.W.2d 792, 793 (Tex. 1990)).
Summary
Mandamus relief is appropriate when a trial court's actions deprive a party
of fundamental due process rights, such as notice and the opportunity to be
heard. This is relevant to the question because it addresses the potential
violation of due process rights if a judge signs a consolidation motion
without a hearing and without notice, which could be considered a clear
abuse of discretion.
Monroe v. Blackmon, 946 S.W.2d 533 (Tex. App. 1997)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Mandamus is proper (1) to correct a clear abuse of discretion committed by
the trial court, (2) when there exists no adequate remedy by appeal. Walker
v. Packer, 827 S.W.2d 833, 839-40 (Tex.1992)... A trial court has no
'discretion' in determining what the law is or applying the law to the facts.
Thus, a clear failure by the trial court to analyze or apply the law correctly
will constitute an abuse of discretion, and may result in appellate reversal
by extraordinary writ.
Summary
Conditions under which a writ of mandamus is appropriate, specifically
when a trial court commits a clear abuse of discretion and when there is no
adequate remedy by appeal. It emphasizes that a trial court has no
discretion in determining or applying the law incorrectly, which constitutes
an abuse of discretion. This is relevant to the question as it provides a legal
basis for challenging a trial court's decision if it was made without proper
legal procedure, such as signing a consolidation motion without a hearing or
in the wrong court.

Extract
As a reviewing court, we may issue a writ of mandamus only to correct a
'clear abuse of discretion' committed by the trial court. This occurs where
the trial court reaches a decision so arbitrary and unreasonable as to
amount to clear and prejudicial error. Walker v. Packer, 827 S.W.2d 833, 839
(1992, orig. proceeding). ... A trial court possesses no discretion to
determine what the law is. A clear failure of the trial court to correctly
analyze or apply the law will constitute an abuse of discretion with resulting
reversal by extraordinary writ. Walker, 827 S.W.2d at 839-40.
Summary
A trial court's decision can be considered a "clear abuse of discretion" if it is
arbitrary, unreasonable, and amounts to a clear and prejudicial error. The
trial court has no discretion to misapply the law, and such misapplication
can be corrected by a writ of mandamus. This principle is applicable to the
question of whether Judge Kenneth Newell's actions in signing a
consolidation motion without a hearing and in the wrong court constitute a
violation of Texas law or judicial ethics.
In re Van Waters & Rogers, Inc., 145 S.W.3d 203 (Tex. 2004)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
Because we hold that the trial court abused its discretion and the
defendants have no adequate remedy by appeal, we conditionally grant
mandamus relief... Having concluded the trial court abused its discretion,
we now must determine whether the defendants nevertheless have an
adequate remedy by appeal. Absent extraordinary circumstances,
mandamus will not issue unless defendants lack an adequate appellate
remedy. An appeal is inadequate when parties are in danger of permanently
losing substantial rights. Such a danger arises when the appellate court
would not be able to cure the error, when the party's ability to present a
viable claim or defense is vitiated, or when the error cannot be made part of
the appellate record... Because most consolidation orders do not threaten a
defendant's substantial rights, mandamus typically does not lie from a trial
court's consolidation order. But if 'extraordinary circumstances' are present
that make an ordinary appeal inadequate, mandamus relief may be
warranted.
Summary
A trial court's consolidation order can be considered an abuse of discretion
if it threatens substantial rights or if extraordinary circumstances make an
ordinary appeal inadequate. The passage also suggests that mandamus
relief is appropriate in such cases. This is relevant to the question as it

provides a legal basis for challenging a consolidation order that was issued
without a hearing, sua sponte, and potentially in the wrong court, especially
if it results in a denial of due process or judicial ethics.
In re All Repair & Restoration
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
A trial court has broad but not unlimited discretion to consolidate cases with
common issues of law or fact. See In re Gulf Coast Bus. Dev. Corp., 247 S.W.
3d 787, 794 (Tex. App.-Dallas 2008, orig. proceeding). A trial court may
consolidate actions that related to substantially the same transaction,
occurrence, subject matter, or question. Id. 'The actions should be so related
that the evidence presented will be material, relevant, and admissible in
each case.' Id. A trial court may abuse its discretion by 'incorrectly resolving
the relatedness issue or by consolidating cases when the consolidation
results in prejudice to the complaining party.' Id. 'The central and primary
requirement for consolidation of actions as directed by rule 174(a) is that
there must exist common issues of law or fact in both cases.' Id. at 795.
Summary
A trial court has discretion to consolidate cases with common issues of law
or fact, but this discretion is not unlimited. The court may abuse its
discretion if it consolidates cases incorrectly, especially if the consolidation
results in prejudice to the complaining party. The passage highlights the
importance of relatedness and the potential for prejudice, which are
relevant to the question of whether Judge Newell's actions violated Texas
law or judicial ethics.
In re Shell Oil Co., 202 S.W.3d 286 (Tex. App. 2006)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Rule 174 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure provides as follows: (a)
Consolidation. When actions involving a common question of law or fact are
pending before the court, it may order a joint hearing or trial of any or all
the matters in issue in the actions; it may order all the actions consolidated;
and it may make such orders concerning proceedings therein as may tend to
avoid unnecessary costs or delay. Tex. R. Civ. P. 174(a). Although Tex. R. Civ.
P. 174 gives the trial court broad discretion to consolidate cases, the trial
court's discretion is not unlimited. Womack v. Berry, 156 Tex. 44, 291 S.W.2d
677, 683 (1956). The express purpose of the rule is to further convenience
and avoid prejudice, and thus promote the ends of justice. When all of the

=== PAGE 17 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
facts and circumstances of the case unquestionably require a separate trial
to prevent manifest injustice, and there is no fact or circumstance
supporting or tending to support a contrary conclusion, and the legal rights
of the parties will not be prejudiced thereby, there is no room for the
exercise of discretion.. .. If it also appears that the injustice resulting from
such refusal cannot later be remedied on appeal, the action of the court is
subject to control by mandamus.
Summary
While Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 174 grants broad discretion to trial
courts to consolidate cases, this discretion is not unlimited. The rule's
purpose is to further convenience and avoid prejudice, promoting justice. If
a separate trial is necessary to prevent manifest injustice, and no facts
support a contrary conclusion, the court's discretion is limited. Moreover, if
the injustice cannot be remedied on appeal, the court's action is subject to
mandamus control. This suggests that a sua sponte consolidation without a
hearing, especially if it violates local rules or due process, could be
considered an abuse of discretion and subject to mandamus.

"A trial court abuses its discretion when it acts with disregard of guiding
rules or principles or when it acts in an arbitrary or unreasonable manner."
In re Acad., Ltd., 625 S.W.3d 19, 25 (Tex. 2021) (orig. proceeding). We
determine the adequacy of an appellate remedy by balancing the benefits of
mandamus review against the detriments. In re Essex Ins., 450 S.W.3d 524,
528 (Tex. 2014) (orig. proceeding) (per curiam); In re Prudential Ins. Co. of
Am., 148 S.W.3d at 136. Thus, under certain circumstances, a remedy by
appeal may be inadequate to address an improper consolidation order.
Summary
A trial court abuses its discretion if it acts arbitrarily or unreasonably, or
disregards guiding rules or principles. This is relevant to the question as it
suggests that if Judge Newell signed a consolidation motion without a
hearing, sua sponte, and in the wrong court, it could be considered an abuse
of discretion. The passage also notes that under certain circumstances, an
appeal may not be adequate to address such an improper order, which could
justify mandamus relief.

Mandamus relief is proper only to correct a clear abuse of discretion when
there is no adequate remedy by appeal. In re State, 355 S.W.3d 611, 613
(Tex. 2011) (orig. proceeding). A trial court abuses its discretion when it
reaches a decision so arbitrary and unreasonable as to amount to a clear
and prejudicial error of law or if it fails to correctly analyze or apply the law.

Summary
A trial court abuses its discretion if its decision is arbitrary, unreasonable, or
fails to correctly apply the law. This is relevant to assessing whether the
judge's actions in signing a consolidation motion without a hearing and in
the wrong court could be seen as an abuse of discretion.

Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Mandamus relief is available if the relator establishes a clear abuse of
discretion for which there is no adequate remedy by appeal. In re Deere &
Co., 299 S.W.3d 819, 820 (Tex. 2009) (orig. proceeding). Whether a clear
abuse of discretion adequately can be remedied by appeal depends on a
careful analysis of costs and benefits of interlocutory review. In re McAllen
Med. Ctr., Inc., 275 S.W.3d 458, 464 (Tex. 2008) (orig. proceeding). Because
this balance depends heavily on the circumstances, it must be guided by
analysis of principles rather than simple rules that treat cases as categories.
Id. An appeal is inadequate when the parties are in danger of permanently
losing substantial rights. In re Van Waters & Rogers, Inc., 145 S.W.3d 203,
211 (Tex. 2004) (orig. proceeding).
Summary
Conditions under which mandamus relief is appropriate in Texas, specifically
when there is a clear abuse of discretion by a trial court and no adequate
remedy by appeal. It emphasizes that an appeal is inadequate when
substantial rights are at risk of being permanently lost. This is relevant to
the question as it provides a legal framework for evaluating whether Judge
Newell's actions could be considered an abuse of discretion and whether
mandamus relief would be appropriate.

In re Gulf Coast Business Development Corp., 247 S.W.3d 787 (Tex. App.
2008)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
This mandamus action arises from an order in the trial court consolidating
two cases filed in that court. Relator Gulf Coast Business Development
Corporation, individually and derivatively on behalf of Patients'
Comprehensive Cancer Center, L.P., asserts the trial judge abused his
discretion in consolidating the cases because (1) the two cases do not share
common questions of law and fact; and (2) consolidation of the cases for trial
will be confusing to the jury and will result in prejudice. Relator argues it
has no adequate remedy by appeal because once the cases are tried
together to a jury, there is no way to discern how or whether prejudice and
confusion affected the jury's deliberations... Rule 174 of the Texas Rules of
Civil Procedure governs consolidation of actions. Rule 174(a) provides:
When actions involving a common question of law or fact are pending before
the court, it may order a joint hearing or trial of any or all the matters in
issue in the actions; it may order all the actions consolidated; and it may
make such orders concerning proceedings therein as may tend to avoid
unnecessary costs or delay.
Summary
The passage provides insight into the requirements for consolidating cases
under Texas law, specifically Rule 174. It emphasizes that consolidation
should only occur when there are common questions of law or fact and that
improper consolidation can lead to jury confusion and prejudice. The
passage also suggests that a trial judge's discretion in consolidation is not
unlimited and can be challenged if it results in an abuse of discretion.
