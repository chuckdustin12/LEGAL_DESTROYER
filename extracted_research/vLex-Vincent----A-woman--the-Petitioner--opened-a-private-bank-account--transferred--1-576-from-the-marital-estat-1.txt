Question
- A woman (the Petitioner) opened a private bank account, transferred
$1,576 from the marital estate to a third party across state lines using
PayPal, then back to herself. - She used the proceeds to purchase a second
phone, which was used in paperwork prepared in Oklahoma with another
individual residing there. - The fraudulent documents were transported back
to Texas and submitted to the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County, with
the purpose of removing the father from his home and business. - The court
ordered the father to vacate without a hearing, findings, or protective order
on January 16, 2024. - The court was notified of the alleged enterprise but
ignored the claims and, through Associate Judge Jeffrey Kaitcer, compelled
the father to agree to the situation, denied his emergency motion, and
rendered a fraudulent agreement into effect. - The judge had no jurisdiction
as he was presiding over a de novo request, and the agreement was
prepared by the mother’s attorney, who was also allegedly part of the
scheme. - Child support payments were added to the agreement, which the
father claims is an unlawful debt. - Under 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1), predicate acts
for RICO include wire fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343), mail fraud (18 U.S.C. §
1341), and extortion (Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1951). - Wire fraud occurs when
someone uses interstate wire communications to further a scheme to
defraud. - Extortion under the Hobbs Act includes obtaining property from
another, with their consent, induced by wrongful use of actual or threatened
force, violence, fear, or under color of official right. - Texas Penal Code §
32.46 criminalizes securing execution of a document by deception, and §
37.10 criminalizes tampering with governmental records. - Judicial immunity
does not protect judges for nonjudicial (administrative) acts or acts taken in
the complete absence of jurisdiction (see Malina v. Gonzales, 994 F.2d 1121
(5th Cir. 1993); Wilder v. Merritt, NO. 02-16-00477-CV (Tex. App. Nov 16,
2017)). - A RICO “enterprise” can be any group of individuals associated in
fact, and a “pattern of racketeering activity” requires at least two related
predicate acts within ten years (18 U.S.C. § 1961(4)-(5)). - RICO liability
attaches to those who conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the
conduct of the enterprise’s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity
(18 U.S.C. § 1962(c)). - The transfer of marital funds across state lines using
PayPal, with the intent to defraud the marital estate, constitutes wire fraud
under 18 U.S.C. § 1343. - The use of proceeds to purchase a second phone,
and the preparation and interstate transport of fraudulent documents,
further supports the wire fraud and mail fraud predicates. - Submitting
fraudulent documents to a Texas court to obtain an order removing the
father from his home and business, if done under false pretenses and with
intent to deprive him of property, may constitute extortion under the Hobbs
Act and Texas law. - If the court, after being notified of the alleged
enterprise, ignored the claims and took further action (such as compelling
the father’s agreement to a fraudulent order, denying emergency relief, and
awarding property and child support based on fraudulent documents), these
acts could be seen as furthering the enterprise’s scheme. - If Associate
Judge Kaitcer acted without jurisdiction and compelled the father’s
signature on a fraudulent document, this may fall outside judicial immunity
and constitute a predicate act (see Malina v. Gonzales, Wilder v. Merritt). -

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
The involvement of the mother’s attorney in preparing the fraudulent
agreement, and the addition of child support as an “unlawful debt,” could be
further predicate acts if done with intent to defraud or extort. - The pattern
of conduct—wire fraud, extortion, tampering with governmental records,
and securing execution of documents by deception—satisfies the RICO
requirement of at least two related predicate acts. - The enterprise
requirement is met if the mother, her attorney, the Oklahoma individual, and
court officials acted in concert to further the scheme. - The effect on
interstate commerce is established by the interstate transfer of funds, use of
interstate communications, and impact on the father’s business with clients
in multiple states and countries. - Therefore, all participants—including the
court, if it acted outside its judicial capacity or jurisdiction—could be liable
under RICO for conducting the affairs of an enterprise through a pattern of
racketeering activity. 
Answer (Fifth Circuit)
Short response
The facts described could potentially support a civil RICO claim under 18
U.S.C. § 1962(c) if the alleged conduct—wire fraud, mail fraud, and extortion
—can be substantiated as predicate acts forming a pattern of racketeering
activity by an enterprise affecting interstate commerce. However, significant
legal and evidentiary hurdles exist, particularly regarding judicial immunity,
the distinctness of the enterprise, and the sufficiency of the alleged
predicate acts.
Summary
The scenario presents a complex set of facts involving alleged fraudulent
transfers, document tampering, and judicial actions, all potentially
implicating federal RICO statutes and related Texas criminal provisions.
Under established Fifth Circuit and federal authority, a viable RICO claim
requires proof of a pattern of racketeering activity (such as wire fraud, mail
fraud, or extortion) conducted through an enterprise that affects interstate
commerce, with at least two predicate acts within ten years.
While the described conduct—interstate wire transfers, preparation and
submission of fraudulent documents, and alleged extortionate court orders—
could, if proven, satisfy the elements of RICO, several legal obstacles must
be addressed. These include the need to show the requisite intent for each
predicate act, the distinctness between the "person" and the "enterprise,"
the applicability of judicial immunity to the judge's actions, and whether the
facts support a pattern of racketeering rather than isolated incidents. The
involvement of attorneys and court officials further complicates the analysis,
especially regarding the boundaries of legitimate legal advocacy and judicial
conduct.

Background and Relevant Law
Federal RICO Statute and Predicate Acts
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), codified at
18 U.S.C. §§ 1961–1968, provides both criminal and civil remedies for
persons injured by a pattern of racketeering activity conducted through an
enterprise affecting interstate commerce. The statute defines "racketeering
activity" to include a range of federal crimes, notably wire fraud (18 U.S.C. §
1343), mail fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1341), and extortion under the Hobbs Act (18
U.S.C. § 1951) (RICO: A Primer (2022-01-31); Peel v. cPaperless LLC, 4:23-
CV-02417 (S.D. Tex. Nov 08, 2024)).
To establish a civil RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), a plaintiff must
show: (1) a person, (2) who engages in a pattern of racketeering activity, (3)
connected to the conduct of an enterprise's affairs, (4) which affects
interstate or foreign commerce (Allstate Ins. Co. v. Benhamou, 190 F.Supp.
3d 631 (S.D. Tex. 2016); St. Paul Mercury Ins v. Williamson, 224 F.3d 425
(5th Cir. 2000)). A "pattern" requires at least two predicate acts within ten
years that are related and pose a threat of continued criminal activity (Word
of Faith World Outreach Center Church, Inc. v. Sawyer, 90 F.3d 118 (5th Cir.
1996); JMF Med., LLC v. Team Health, LLC, 490 F.Supp.3d 947 (M.D. La.
2020)).
Elements of Predicate Acts
Wire Fraud: To prove wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343, the government
(or a civil RICO plaintiff) must show: (1) a scheme to defraud, (2) use of
interstate wire communications in furtherance of the scheme, and (3) intent
to defraud or cause harm (U.S. v. Keller, 14 F.3d 1051 (5th Cir. 1994); U.S. v.
Powers, 168 F.3d 741 (5th Cir. 1999); Mail and Wire Fraud (2023-07-01)).
The interstate element is satisfied by electronic transfers (e.g., PayPal)
crossing state lines (Mail and wire fraud. (1999-06-22)).
Mail Fraud: Similar to wire fraud, mail fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1341
requires a scheme to defraud and use of the mails to further the scheme
(Dale v. Ala Acquisitions, Inc., 203 F.Supp.2d 694 (S.D. Miss. 2002)).
Extortion (Hobbs Act): Extortion under 18 U.S.C. § 1951 includes
obtaining property from another, with their consent, induced by wrongful
use of actual or threatened force, violence, fear, or under color of official
right (RICO: A Primer (2022-01-31)).
RICO Enterprise and Pattern
A RICO "enterprise" can be any group of individuals associated in fact, not
necessarily a formal legal entity (RICO: A Primer (2022-01-31)). The
"person" and the "enterprise" must be distinct (Allstate Ins. Co. v.
Benhamou, 190 F.Supp.3d 631 (S.D. Tex. 2016); Mortgage v. Flores, 735
F.Supp.2d 679 (S.D. Tex. 2010)). The pattern requirement is met by at least
two related predicate acts within ten years that show relatedness and

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
continuity (Word of Faith World Outreach Center Church, Inc. v. Sawyer, 90
F.3d 118 (5th Cir. 1996)).
Judicial Immunity
Judges are generally immune from civil liability for acts taken in their
judicial capacity, but this immunity does not extend to nonjudicial acts or
acts taken in the complete absence of jurisdiction (Malina v. Gonzales, 994 F.
2d 1121 (5th Cir. 1993); Wilder v. Merritt, NO. 02-16-00477-CV (Tex. App.
Nov 16, 2017)). The scope of immunity is a critical issue when considering
whether judicial conduct can serve as a RICO predicate act.
Texas Law
Texas Penal Code § 32.46 criminalizes securing execution of a document by
deception, and § 37.10 criminalizes tampering with governmental records.
These state law violations can serve as predicate acts for RICO if they are
indictable under federal law or otherwise incorporated by reference (U.S. v.
Marmolejo, 86 F.3d 404 (5th Cir. 1996)).
Analysis
Application of RICO Elements to the Facts
1. Predicate Acts: Wire Fraud, Mail Fraud, and Extortion
The facts allege that the petitioner transferred marital funds across state
lines using PayPal, with the intent to defraud the marital estate. This
conduct, if proven, aligns with the elements of wire fraud: a scheme to
defraud, use of interstate wire communications, and intent to cause harm
(U.S. v. Keller, 14 F.3d 1051 (5th Cir. 1994); U.S. v. Powers, 168 F.3d 741 (5th
Cir. 1999)). The use of proceeds to purchase a second phone, and the
preparation and interstate transport of fraudulent documents, could further
support wire fraud and potentially mail fraud if the mails were used (Dale v.
Ala Acquisitions, Inc., 203 F.Supp.2d 694 (S.D. Miss. 2002)).
Submitting fraudulent documents to a Texas court to obtain an order
removing the father from his home and business, if done under false
pretenses and with intent to deprive him of property, may constitute
extortion under the Hobbs Act, especially if the deprivation was induced
under color of official right (RICO: A Primer (2022-01-31)). The addition of
child support as an "unlawful debt" could also be relevant if it was imposed
as part of the fraudulent scheme, though courts are generally reluctant to
treat court-ordered child support as an "unlawful debt" under RICO absent
clear evidence of fraud or extortion.
2. Pattern of Racketeering Activity
A pattern requires at least two related predicate acts within ten years that
are related and pose a threat of continued criminal activity (Word of Faith

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
World Outreach Center Church, Inc. v. Sawyer, 90 F.3d 118 (5th Cir. 1996)).
The described conduct—wire fraud (interstate transfer of funds), mail fraud
(if the mails were used for the documents), and extortion (court order
obtained by fraud)—could, if proven, satisfy this requirement. The acts
appear related in purpose, participants, and method, and the alleged
scheme appears ongoing rather than isolated.
3. Existence of an Enterprise
A RICO enterprise can be any group of individuals associated in fact,
including informal associations (RICO: A Primer (2022-01-31)). The facts
allege a coordinated effort involving the petitioner, her attorney, an
Oklahoma individual, and possibly court officials. If these individuals acted
in concert to further the scheme, the enterprise requirement could be met
(Allstate Ins. Co. v. Benhamou, 190 F.Supp.3d 631 (S.D. Tex. 2016)).
However, RICO requires that the "person" and the "enterprise" be distinct
(Allstate Ins. Co. v. Benhamou, 190 F.Supp.3d 631 (S.D. Tex. 2016); 
Mortgage v. Flores, 735 F.Supp.2d 679 (S.D. Tex. 2010)). If the only alleged
participants are the petitioner and her attorney, courts may find insufficient
distinctness. The inclusion of court officials complicates the analysis, as
their participation must be outside the scope of legitimate judicial functions.
4. Effect on Interstate Commerce
RICO applies only to enterprises whose activities affect interstate or foreign
commerce (U.S. v. Cauble, 706 F.2d 1322 (5th Cir. 1983)). The interstate
transfer of funds via PayPal, the preparation of documents in Oklahoma, and
the alleged impact on the father's business with clients in multiple states
and countries likely satisfy this requirement.
5. Judicial Immunity
Judicial immunity generally shields judges from civil liability for acts taken
in their judicial capacity, even if those acts are alleged to be in error or done
maliciously (Malina v. Gonzales, 994 F.2d 1121 (5th Cir. 1993)). However,
immunity does not apply to nonjudicial acts or acts taken in the complete
absence of jurisdiction. If Associate Judge Kaitcer acted entirely outside his
jurisdiction or performed nonjudicial acts (such as compelling a party to sign
a fraudulent agreement), immunity may not apply. The facts would need to
show that the judge's actions were not judicial in nature or were taken
without any subject-matter jurisdiction (Wilder v. Merritt, NO. 02-16-00477-
CV (Tex. App. Nov 16, 2017)).
6. Conspiracy
RICO also prohibits conspiracy to violate its substantive provisions (United
States v. Rosenthal, 805 F.3d 523 (5th Cir. 2015); United States v. Pratt, 728
F.3d 463 (5th Cir. 2013)). To establish a RICO conspiracy, it must be shown
that two or more people agreed to commit a substantive RICO offense and
knew of the overall objective. The facts suggest possible agreement among

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
the petitioner, her attorney, and others, but clear evidence of such
agreement is required.
Note: United States v. Pratt, 728 F.3d 463 (5th Cir. 2013) has been stated as
abrogated by Widmer v. Smith, Civil Action 21-381 (E.D. La. Sep 16, 2021)
on certain points, but the basic elements of RICO conspiracy remain
consistent with other Fifth Circuit authority.
7. State Law Predicate Acts
Texas Penal Code §§ 32.46 and 37.10 criminalize securing execution of
documents by deception and tampering with governmental records,
respectively. If these acts are part of the alleged scheme, they may serve as
predicate acts for RICO if they are indictable under federal law or otherwise
incorporated (U.S. v. Marmolejo, 86 F.3d 404 (5th Cir. 1996)).
Potential Obstacles and Defenses
Judicial Immunity: As noted, judicial immunity is a significant barrier
to RICO liability for judges unless the acts were nonjudicial or taken in
the complete absence of jurisdiction. The facts must clearly establish
that the judge's conduct falls outside protected judicial functions.
Distinctness Requirement: The "person" and the "enterprise" must
be distinct. If the alleged enterprise is simply the petitioner and her
attorney, courts may find insufficient distinctness (Allstate Ins. Co. v.
Benhamou, 190 F.Supp.3d 631 (S.D. Tex. 2016)).
Sufficiency of Predicate Acts: Each predicate act must be proven
with evidence of intent to defraud or extort. Mere irregularities or
errors in court proceedings, without fraudulent intent, are unlikely to
suffice.
Pattern and Continuity: The acts must be related and pose a threat of
continued criminal activity. Isolated incidents or a single scheme with
no threat of repetition may not meet this standard (Word of Faith World
Outreach Center Church, Inc. v. Sawyer, 90 F.3d 118 (5th Cir. 1996)).
Unlawful Debt: RICO's "unlawful debt" provision is typically applied to
debts arising from illegal gambling or usurious lending, not to court-
ordered child support unless the order itself was obtained by fraud or
extortion (RICO: A Primer (2022-01-31)).
Exceptions and Caveats
Judicial Immunity: As discussed, most judicial acts are immune from
civil liability, including under RICO, unless the judge acted in a
nonjudicial capacity or in the complete absence of jurisdiction. The
facts must be clear and specific to overcome this defense.
Attorney Conduct: Attorneys are generally immune from civil liability
for conduct within the scope of legitimate advocacy, unless they
actively participate in fraudulent or criminal acts.
Proof of Intent: RICO claims require clear evidence of intent to
defraud or extort. Mere negligence, poor judgment, or even gross
procedural errors are insufficient.

Abrogation of Authority: The abrogation of United States v. Pratt,
728 F.3d 463 (5th Cir. 2013) by Widmer v. Smith, Civil Action 21-381
(E.D. La. Sep 16, 2021) may affect the precise articulation of RICO
conspiracy elements, but the core requirements remain supported by
other Fifth Circuit cases.
Conclusion
The described conduct, if substantiated with evidence, could potentially
support a civil RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) by alleging a pattern of
racketeering activity—specifically, wire fraud, mail fraud, and extortion—
conducted through an enterprise affecting interstate commerce. However,
the success of such a claim would depend on overcoming significant legal
hurdles, including judicial immunity, the distinctness of the enterprise, and
the sufficiency and continuity of the alleged predicate acts. The facts must
clearly demonstrate fraudulent intent, coordinated action among multiple
parties, and conduct falling outside the protections of judicial and attorney
immunity. Without such evidence, courts are likely to dismiss RICO claims as
insufficiently pled or legally barred.
Legal Authorities
United States v. Rosenthal, 805 F.3d 523 (5th Cir. 2015)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
Under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), it is a crime for “any person employed by or
associated with any enterprise engaged in, [or affecting] interstate or
foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the
conduct of [the] enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering
activity or collection of unlawful debt”. 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). Section 1962(d),
at issue here, prohibits conspiracy to violate any part of § 1962. “The
elements of a conspiracy under § 1962(d) are simply (1) that two or more
people agreed to commit a substantive RICO offense and (2) that the
defendant knew of and agreed to the overall objective of the RICO offense.”
United States v. Pratt, 728 F.3d 463, 477 (5th Cir.2013) (emphasis added)
(internal quotation marks omitted).
Summary
The passage from United States v. Rosenthal outlines the elements required
to establish a RICO conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d), which includes an
agreement between two or more people to commit a RICO offense and
knowledge of the overall objective. This supports the proposition by
providing a legal framework for understanding how the alleged actions of
the woman, her attorney, and others could constitute a RICO conspiracy if
they agreed to engage in racketeering activities such as wire fraud and
extortion. The passage also highlights the requirement of affecting
•

interstate commerce, which is relevant given the interstate nature of the
alleged activities.
U.S. v. Welch, 656 F.2d 1039 (5th Cir. 1981)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
The RICO count charged that the four defendants violated 18 U.S.C.A. §
1962(c) by conducting the affairs of the Sheriff's Office through a pattern of
racketeering activity. Engaging in a 'pattern of racketeering activity'
requires at least two acts of racketeering within a ten-year period. Finally,
racketeering activity is expressly defined to include only certain types of
conduct, including acts indictable under 18 U.S.C.A. § 1511. Here, the
Cantrell's game conspiracy (Count III) and the fairgrounds conspiracy
(Count IV) were each alleged to constitute one of the required two acts of
racketeering activity necessary for the substantive RICO violation. Including
both conspiracies as predicate acts under the substantive RICO count
served as an allegation that the purpose of both conspiracies was to conduct
the affairs of the Sheriff's Office through a pattern of racketeering activity.
Summary
The RICO statute requires at least two predicate acts of racketeering
activity within a ten-year period to establish a pattern of racketeering
activity. The passage illustrates how multiple conspiracies can be used as
predicate acts to support a RICO charge. This is relevant to the proposition
as it involves allegations of multiple predicate acts (wire fraud, extortion,
etc.) that could form a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO.
Mortgage v. Flores, 735 F.Supp.2d 679 (S.D. Tex. 2010)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of Texas
Extract
RICO provides an exhaustive definition of 'racketeering activity,' which
includes numerous federal crimes. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1) ('racketeering
activity' means....); Johnson v. Hoffa, 196 Fed.Appx. 88, 90 n. 3 (3d Cir.2006)
('18 U.S.C. § 1961(1) catalogues an exhaustive list of 'racketeering activities'

their RICO 'racketeering activity' allegations, including: 18 U.S.C. § 1028
(fraudulent identification documents), 1341 (mail fraud), 1343 (wire fraud),
1344 (bank fraud), 1956 (money laundering), and securities fraud. (D.E. 98,
p. 30.) ... As such, the wire and mail fraud were the proximate cause of
Intervenors' injury to property. ... Section 1962(c) prohibits any person

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
conducting the affairs of the enterprise through a pattern of racketeering
activity. Abraham, 480 F.3d at 357. 'For purposes of § 1962(c) ... the plaintiff
must demonstrate not only that the enterprise is distinct from the series of
predicate acts constituting racketeering activity, but also that the RICO
'person' who commits the predicate acts is distinct from the enterprise. It is
not enough to establish that a defendant corporation through its agents
committed the predicate acts in the conduct of its own business.' Whelan v.
Winchester Production Co., 319 F.3d 225, 229 (5th Cir.2003) (internal
citations omitted); see also Abraham, 480 F.3d at 357.
Summary
The passage discusses the definition of "racketeering activity" under RICO,
which includes wire fraud and mail fraud. It also explains the requirements
for establishing a RICO claim under Section 1962(c), emphasizing the need
for a distinct enterprise and a pattern of racketeering activity. This supports
the proposition by highlighting the legal framework for RICO claims, which
is relevant to the alleged activities in the proposition.
Allstate Ins. Co. v. Benhamou, 190 F.Supp.3d 631 (S.D. Tex. 2016)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of Texas
Extract
RICO makes it 'unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any
enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign
commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of
such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity or
collection of unlawful debt.' Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938, 943–45,
129 S.Ct. 2237, 173 L.Ed.2d 1265 (2009) (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) )
(internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, to establish liability under §
1962(c) one must allege and prove the existence of two distinct entities: (1)
a 'person'; and (2) an 'enterprise' that is not simply the same 'person'
referred to by a different name.
Summary
Requirements for establishing a RICO claim under § 1962(c), which includes
proving the existence of a "person" and an "enterprise" engaged in a pattern
of racketeering activity. This directly supports the proposition by providing a
legal framework for alleging RICO violations based on the described
activities, such as wire fraud and extortion, which are considered predicate
acts under RICO.

the jury was instructed that it could convict the defendants on Count 34 if it
found that they knowingly conducted a financial transaction involving the
proceeds of a 'license as property' fraud.
Summary
The court in U.S. v. Edwards dealt with RICO charges involving wire fraud,
mail fraud, and extortion. The passage highlights the importance of
establishing a prima facie case for fraudulent activity and the use of
financial transactions involving proceeds from such activities. This is
relevant to the proposition as it involves similar allegations of wire fraud,
extortion, and fraudulent transactions.
JMF Med., LLC v. Team Health, LLC, 490 F.Supp.3d 947 (M.D. La. 2020)
U.S. District Court — Middle District of Louisiana
Extract
RICO imposes civil liability on those who engage in certain 'prohibited
activities,' which are defined as requiring proof of either 'a pattern of
racketeering activity' or 'collection of an unlawful debt.' 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c).
A pattern of racketeering activity requires at least two predicate acts of
racketeering activity which are related and pose a threat of continued
criminal activity. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5) ; H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell
Telephone Co., 492 U.S. 229, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989) ;
Howell Hydrocarbons, Inc. v. Adams, 897 F.2d 183, 191 (5th Cir. 1991).
'Racketeering activity' means any act indictable under various specified
federal statutes, and certain federal offenses.
Summary
RICO liability requires a pattern of racketeering activity, which involves at
least two related predicate acts. The passage supports the proposition by
explaining the legal framework for RICO claims, which is relevant to the
alleged actions of wire fraud, mail fraud, and extortion in the proposition.
The passage also highlights the requirement for these acts to pose a threat
of continued criminal activity, which aligns with the ongoing nature of the
alleged scheme in the proposition.

U.S. v. Mills, 199 F.3d 184 (5th Cir. 1999)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
To establish wire fraud, the government must prove (1) that the defendant
knowingly participated in a scheme to defraud; (2) that interstate wire
communications were used to further the scheme; and (3) that the
defendant intended that some harm result from the fraud. See United States
v. Powers, 168 F.3d 741, 746 (5th Cir. 1999). For purposes of jurisdiction, the
first and third elements (knowingly participating in a harmful fraudulent
scheme) were established by the allegations of the indictment as a whole,
the plea agreement, and the resume of stipulated facts. Whether the second
element (that interstate wire communications were used to further the
scheme) was established is a more complex question.
Summary
The elements required to establish wire fraud include knowingly
participating in a scheme to defraud, using interstate wire communications
to further the scheme, and intending harm to result from the fraud. This
aligns with the proposition that the transfer of marital funds across state
lines using PayPal, with the intent to defraud, constitutes wire fraud. The
passage supports the notion that the use of interstate wire communications

U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
To sustain a conviction for wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1343, the
government must present evidence of (1) a scheme to defraud, and (2) the
use of, or causing the use of, wire communications in furtherance of the
scheme. United States v. Dula, 989 F.2d 772, 778 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, ---

Summary
To establish wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343, there must be evidence of a
scheme to defraud and the use of wire communications in furtherance of
that scheme. Additionally, there must be an intent to defraud or deceive the
victims. This directly supports the proposition that the transfer of marital

funds across state lines using PayPal, with the intent to defraud the marital
estate, constitutes wire fraud. The passage provides the legal framework
necessary to argue that the actions described in the proposition meet the
criteria for wire fraud.
Word of Faith World Outreach Center Church, Inc. v. Sawyer, 90 F.3d 118
(5th Cir. 1996)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
The Church alleges the defendants violated 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) and (d) of
the Racketeer Influence and Corrupt Organization Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C. §§
1961-1968. Subsection 1962(c) prohibits persons employed by or associated
with any enterprise from conducting or participating in the enterprise's
affairs through a pattern of racketeering. ... To establish a pattern of
racketeering activity, the Supreme Court explained in H.J. Inc. v.
Northwestern Bell Telephone, Co. 492 U.S. 229, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106 L.Ed.2d
195 (1989), that a plaintiff 'must show that the racketeering predicates are
related, and that they amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal
activity.' ... The element of relatedness is established if the acts have the
'same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of
commission.'
Summary
Requirements for establishing a RICO claim, specifically the need for a
pattern of racketeering activity, which includes related predicate acts that
pose a threat of continued criminal activity. This is relevant to the
proposition as it involves allegations of wire fraud, extortion, and other
predicate acts that could form a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO.
The passage also highlights the importance of relatedness and continuity in
establishing a RICO claim, which aligns with the proposition's description of
a coordinated scheme involving multiple parties and actions.
Abraham v. Singh, 480 F.3d 351 (5th Cir. 2007)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
Plaintiffs allege that Defendants violated 18 U.S.C. § 1962(a), (b), (c), and
(d). These RICO subsections state, in their simplest terms, that: (a) a person
who has received income from a pattern of racketeering activity cannot
invest that income in an enterprise; (b) a person cannot acquire or maintain
an interest in an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering; (c) a person
who is employed by or associated with an enterprise cannot conduct the

=== PAGE 13 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
affairs of the enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity; and (d) a
person cannot conspire to violate subsections (a), (b), or (c). ... Subsection
(c) prohibits any `person employed by or associated with any enterprise'
from participating in or conducting the affairs of the enterprise through a
pattern of racketeering activity. ... Plaintiffs specifically alleged that the
Defendants entered into an agreement and that each agreed to commit at
least two predicate acts of racketeering. These allegations are specific
enough to state a claim that the Defendants conspired to violate § 1962(c).
Summary
The Fifth Circuit recognizes the applicability of RICO claims when there is a
pattern of racketeering activity, which includes wire fraud, mail fraud, and
extortion. The passage supports the proposition by illustrating that a RICO
claim can be made when individuals conspire to commit predicate acts of
racketeering, which aligns with the alleged actions in the proposition. The
case demonstrates that a pattern of racketeering activity involving multiple
parties can form the basis of a RICO claim, similar to the alleged scheme
involving the mother, her attorney, and court officials.
U.S. v. Elliott, 571 F.2d 880 (5th Cir. 1978)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
The substantive proscriptions of the RICO statute apply to insiders and
outsiders those merely 'associated with' an enterprise who participate
directly and indirectly in the enterprise's affairs through a pattern of
racketeering activity. 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). ... Thus, the RICO net is woven
tightly to trap even the smallest fish, those peripherally involved with the
enterprise. ... Undeniably, then, under the RICO conspiracy provision,
remote associates of an enterprise may be convicted as conspirators on the
basis of purely circumstantial evidence.
Summary
The RICO statute is designed to encompass a wide range of participants in a
criminal enterprise, including those who are only peripherally involved. The
passage emphasizes that RICO can apply to both insiders and outsiders who
participate in the enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering
activity. This supports the proposition that the individuals involved in the
alleged scheme, including the mother, her attorney, and potentially court
officials, could be liable under RICO if they participated in the enterprise's
affairs through predicate acts like wire fraud and extortion.

U.S. District Court — Southern District of Mississippi
Extract
Defendants further argue that plaintiffs have failed to state a claim against
them under RICO. Plaintiffs have alleged that defendants are liable under
RICO pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) and (d). Generally, to state a prima
facie claim under RICO, plaintiffs must allege that there is `(1) a person who
engages in (2) a pattern of racketeering activity (3) connected to the
acquisition, establishment, conduct, or control of an enterprise.' St. Paul
Mercury Ins. Co. v. Williamson, 224 F.3d 425, 439 (5th Cir.2000) (quoting
Delta Truck & Tractor, Inc. v. J.I. Case Co., 855 F.2d 241, 242 (5th Cir.
1988)). ... Plaintiffs argue that a `pattern of racketeering activity' has been
pled based on defendants' alleged violations of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1341 and 1343,
the federal wire and mail fraud statutes, respectively. Under RICO,
racketeering activity is defined as two or more predicate acts, which include
acts of wire and mail fraud. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1)(B) & (5); Word of Faith
World Outreach Ctr. Church, Inc. v. Sawyer, 90 F.3d 118, 122 (5th Cir.
1996). ... Construing the complaint in the light most favorable to plaintiffs,
the court concludes that plaintiffs have sufficiently pled that defendants
were involved in a scheme to defraud using both the interstate wires and
mails for the purpose of executing a scheme that would result in some
intended harm. Consequently, plaintiffs have adequately pled the requisite
predicate acts to maintain their RICO claims against defendants.
Summary
To establish a RICO claim, plaintiffs must allege a pattern of racketeering
activity connected to an enterprise. The passage confirms that wire and mail
fraud are recognized predicate acts under RICO, and a pattern can be
established by showing related acts that threaten continued criminal
activity. This aligns with the proposition's claim of wire fraud and other
predicate acts as part of a scheme to defraud.
Heden v. Hill, 937 F.Supp. 1230 (S.D. Tex. 1996)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of Texas
Extract
In 1970, Congress enacted RICO as Title IX of the Organized Crime Control
Act to combat organized crime through both criminal prosecutions and
private actions. See 18 U.S.C. § 1961 et seq. The 'legislative history
forcefully supports the view that the major purpose of Title IX is to address
the infiltration of legitimate business by organized crime.' United States v.
Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 591, 101 S.Ct. 2524, 2532, 69 L.Ed.2d 246 (1981). A
private right of action is provided under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c), which states in
pertinent part: Any person injured in his business or property by reason of a
violation of section 1962 of this chapter may sue therefor in any appropriate

United States district court and shall recover threefold the damages he
sustains and the cost of the suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee.
Summary
RICO provides a private right of action for individuals injured in their
business or property due to a violation of section 1962. This supports the
proposition that the father could potentially bring a RICO claim if he can
demonstrate that the actions of the mother, her attorney, and others
constituted a pattern of racketeering activity that injured his business or
property.
U.S. v. Marmolejo, 86 F.3d 404 (5th Cir. 1996)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
A jury found Marmolejo guilty of violating RICO, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §
1962(c), RICO conspiracy, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d)... At trial, the
government alleged that the defendants violated TEX.PENAL CODE ANN. §
36.02(a)(1), which constituted 'predicate acts establishing a pattern of
racketeering activity' in violation of RICO. See 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c)... the
object of a RICO conspiracy is to violate a substantive RICO provision--here,
to conduct or participate in the affairs of an enterprise through a pattern of
racketeering activity--and not merely to commit each of the predicate crimes
necessary to demonstrate a pattern of racketeering activity.... Under the
statute, it is irrelevant that each defendant participated in the enterprise's
affairs through different, even unrelated crimes, so long as we may
reasonably infer that each crime was intended to further the enterprise's
affairs.
Summary
The case of U.S. v. Marmolejo illustrates how RICO can be applied to a
pattern of racketeering activity involving multiple predicate acts. The
passage highlights that a RICO violation involves conducting or participating
in an enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity, which
can include different crimes as long as they further the enterprise's affairs.
This supports the proposition by showing that the alleged actions of the
woman, her attorney, and others could constitute a RICO violation if they
engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity to further their scheme.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
The gist of the RICO offense, however, is that the defendant, through a
pattern of predicate crimes, furthered a racketeering enterprise. ... Section
1962(c) of Title 18 provides: It shall be unlawful for any person employed by
or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which
affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or
indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of
racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt. ... The final element of a
RICO violation is proof that the defendant participated in the affairs of the
enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. ... The RICO
conspiracy statute provides: 'It shall be unlawful for any person to conspire
to violate any of the provisions of subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section.'
18 U.S.C. § 1962(d). To be convicted of conspiracy to violate RICO there
must be proof that the individual, by his words or actions, objectively
manifested an agreement to participate, directly or indirectly, in the affairs
of the enterprise, through the commission of two or more predicate crimes.
Summary
The RICO statute requires proof of an enterprise, association with the
enterprise, participation in its affairs, and a pattern of racketeering activity.
The passage supports the proposition by illustrating how a pattern of
predicate crimes, such as wire fraud and extortion, can further a
racketeering enterprise. The case also highlights the necessity of
demonstrating an agreement to participate in the enterprise's affairs
through predicate crimes, which aligns with the alleged actions in the
proposition.
U.S. v. Cauble, 706 F.2d 1322 (5th Cir. 1983)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
RICO's purpose is 'the imposition of enhanced criminal penalties and new
civil sanctions to provide new legal remedies for all types of organized
criminal behavior, that is, enterprise criminality--from simple political
corruption to sophisticated white-collar crime schemes to traditional Mafia-
type endeavors.' RICO does not, however, criminalize conduct that was legal
before its enactment. Its application depends on the existence of
racketeering activity violating some other criminal statute, state or federal.
Section 1962(a) of the statute prohibits the use of illegally-derived funds to
acquire or maintain an interest in an enterprise by legal means. Section
1962(c) proscribes the illegal use of an enterprise. Section 1962(d) makes
illegal a conspiracy to violate RICO's substantive provisions, requiring the
government to prove that the defendant agreed to participate in the
enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering. Each section requires
that the enterprise affect interstate commerce. ... RICO criminalizes the
conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity and not

=== PAGE 17 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
merely the defendant's engaging in racketeering activity. Therefore, there
must be a nexus between the enterprise, the defendant, and the pattern of
racketeering activity. The mere fact that a defendant works for a legitimate
enterprise and commits racketeering acts while on the business premises
does not establish that the affairs of the enterprise have been conducted
'through' a pattern of racketeering activity. Similarly, a defendant's mere
association with a lawful enterprise whose affairs are conducted through a
pattern of racketeering activity in which he is not personally engaged does
not establish his guilt under RICO.
Summary
RICO is designed to address organized criminal behavior through enhanced
penalties and civil sanctions. The statute requires a pattern of racketeering
activity that affects interstate commerce. The passage highlights the
necessity of a nexus between the enterprise, the defendant, and the
racketeering activity, which aligns with the proposition's claim of a
coordinated scheme involving multiple parties and interstate activities. The
passage also emphasizes that RICO does not criminalize legal conduct,
underscoring the need for predicate acts that violate other criminal statutes,
which the proposition outlines through wire fraud, mail fraud, and extortion.
U.S. v. Dula, 989 F.2d 772 (5th Cir. 1993)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
Evidence of an uncharged offense arising out of the same transaction or
series of transactions as the charged offense is not an 'extrinsic' offense
within the meaning of Rule 404(b), and is therefore not barred by the rule.
See, e.g., United States v. Simpson, 709 F.2d 903, 907 (5th Cir.1983), cert.
denied, 464 U.S. 942, 104 S.Ct. 360, 78 L.Ed.2d 322. The defendants were
charged with conducting a continuing scheme to defraud, characterized by
the substitution of products, and it was necessary for the government to
prove that the defendants had intentionally devised a scheme and artifice to
defraud. In developing proof of intent and motive, the prosecution may offer
all of the surrounding circumstances that were relevant. ... In this case, the
existence of a scheme to defraud is an element of the offense of wire fraud
under 18 U.S.C. § 1343. Although Pan Metals' order was not one of those
charged in the indictment, it was relevant to the existence of a scheme and
therefore was independently admissible as direct proof of the scheme
charged. United States v. Santagata, 924 F.2d 391, 393-394 (1st Cir.1991).
In addition, the admission of the testimony did not violate Rule 403, which
allows a trial judge to exclude probative evidence that is substantially
outweighed by its prejudicial effect. The balancing of probative value
against prejudicial effect is committed to the sound discretion of the trial
judge, a decision that is final in the absence of abuse of discretion. ... To
obtain Dula's convictions for the crimes of wire fraud alleged in the
indictment, the government was required to prove beyond a reasonable

purpose of executing scheme); United States v. Shaw, 555 F.2d 1295 (5th
Cir.1977) (same elements as to wire fraud).
Summary
The existence of a scheme to defraud is a critical element in proving wire
fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343. The passage highlights that evidence of a
scheme, even if not directly charged, can be admissible to prove the
existence of a fraudulent scheme. This supports the proposition that the
actions described, such as transferring funds and submitting fraudulent
documents, could be part of a scheme to defraud, thus constituting wire
fraud.
Peel v. cPaperless LLC, 4:23-CV-02417 (S.D. Tex. Nov 08, 2024)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of Texas
Extract
Congress enacted RICO in order to prohibit conduct involving a pattern of
racketeering activity. ... One of RICO's enforcement mechanisms is a private
right of action, available to ‘[a]ny person injured in his business or property
by reason of a violation' of the RICO's substantive restrictions. ... To state a
civil RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962, a plaintiff must allege three
common elements: (1) a person who engages in (2) a pattern of racketeering
activity, (3) connected to the acquisition, establishment, conduct, or control
of an enterprise. ... An act of 'racketeering activity,' commonly referred to as
a 'predicate act,' is defined to include certain criminal acts, including mail
and wire fraud.
Summary
The passage outlines the elements required to establish a RICO claim, which
includes engaging in a pattern of racketeering activity connected to an
enterprise. The passage specifically mentions wire fraud as a predicate act,
which is relevant to the proposition's claim of wire fraud through the
transfer of marital funds using PayPal. The passage also highlights the
private right of action under RICO for those injured in their business or
property, which aligns with the father's claim of being deprived of his home
and business.

Counts 8 through 15 of the indictment charged Powers with executing a
scheme to defraud by use of the wires, i.e., telephone calls, in violation of 18

Government must prove that a defendant knowingly participated in a
scheme to defraud, that interstate wire communications were used to
further the scheme, and that the defendants intended that some harm result
from the fraud.
Summary
The elements required to establish wire fraud include knowingly
participating in a scheme to defraud, using interstate wire communications
to further the scheme, and intending that some harm result from the fraud.
This directly supports the proposition that the transfer of marital funds
across state lines using PayPal, with the intent to defraud the marital estate,
constitutes wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343.
United States v. Pratt, 728 F.3d 463 (5th Cir. 2013)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit

=== PAGE 20 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
Pratt was charged under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d) with conspiring to violate a
substantive RICO provision, § 1962(c). The elements of a conspiracy under §
1962(d) are simply “(1) that two or more people agreed to commit a
substantive RICO offense and (2) that the defendant knew of and agreed to
the overall objective of the RICO offense.” The defendant need not be one of
the people who agreed to commit the substantive offense.Section 1962(c)
makes it “unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any
enterprise ... to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct
of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.” ... A “
‘pattern of racketeering activity’ requires at least two acts of racketeering
activity” that occur within ten years of each other. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5). An
act of racketeering activity is defined in part as any act that is indictable
under enumerated provisions of the criminal code. Id. § 1961(1)(B). In this
case, the indictment alleges that the “pattern of racketeering activity”
consisted of multiple, specific acts of mail fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §
1341, and of money laundering, in violation of § 1956. In order to constitute
a pattern, the predicating acts must also be connected in a way that shows a
“threat of continuing activity.”
Summary
The elements of a RICO conspiracy under § 1962(d) require an agreement to
commit a substantive RICO offense and knowledge of the overall objective.
The passage also clarifies that a pattern of racketeering activity requires at
least two acts within ten years, which aligns with the proposition's claim of
multiple predicate acts (wire fraud, mail fraud, extortion). The passage
supports the idea that the alleged actions in the proposition could form a
RICO pattern if they are connected and show a threat of continuing activity.

subsections, to state a RICO claim, there must be: '(1) a person who engages
in (2) a pattern of racketeering activity (3) connected to the acquisition,
establishment, conduct, or control of an enterprise.' ... Despite the
problems, we believe that St. Paul has sufficiently distinguished and
established a genuine issue of material fact as to the existence of a prior
pattern of racketeering activity, which may have produced income that was
invested into a RICO enterprise, causing injuries to St. Paul in the form of
legal costs.

Summary
The court outlines the elements necessary to establish a RICO claim, which
includes a person engaging in a pattern of racketeering activity connected
to an enterprise. The passage also discusses the sufficiency of evidence to
establish a genuine issue of material fact regarding a pattern of
racketeering activity. This supports the proposition by providing a legal
framework for establishing a RICO claim, which is relevant to the alleged
activities described in the proposition.
Mail and Wire Fraud
American Criminal Law Review - Georgetown University Law Center -
Todd Kowalski - 2023-07-01
Extract
Additionally, the wire fraud statute requires proof of an interstate nexus
because Congress relied solely on its Commerce Clause power to enact the
statute. Internet communications satisfy this requirement, even in the
absence of proof that a fraudulent communication traveled through out-of-
state servers. Each use of the mail or wires constitutes a separate offense
and can be charged as a separate count in an indictment. In addition, mail
and wire fraud charges can be brought in conjunction with other or more
specific fraud charges to prosecute similar underlying conduct. Under the
first element of both the mail and wire fraud statutes, the government must
prove that the defendant engaged in a scheme to defraud by means of
material deception. The third element the government must prove for a mail
or wire fraud conviction is that the defendant used or caused to be used: (i)
the U.S. mails; (ii) any private or commercial interstate carrier; and/or (iii)
interstate wires in furtherance of, or for the purpose of, executing the
scheme to defraud.
Summary
The passage explains the requirements for establishing wire fraud, including
the need for an interstate nexus and the use of interstate communications to
further a scheme to defraud. This directly supports the proposition that the
transfer of marital funds across state lines using PayPal, with the intent to
defraud, constitutes wire fraud. The passage also notes that each use of the
wires can be charged separately, which aligns with the multiple acts
described in the proposition.

Extract
The wire fraud statute, [sections] 1343, further requires that the
communication cross state lines.(20) This interstate requirement arises
because Congress relied on its Commerce Clause powers to assert
jurisdiction over wire fraud... The elements of wire fraud under [sections]
1343 directly parallel those of the mail fraud statute, but require the use of
a telephone call or electronic communication made in furtherance of the
scheme. See, e.g., United States v. Keller, 14 F.3d 1051, 1056 (5th Cir. 1994)
(describing required elements of proof for wire fraud)...
Summary
Elements required to establish wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343, which
includes the use of interstate wire communications to further a scheme to
defraud. This directly supports the proposition that the transfer of marital
funds across state lines using PayPal, with the intent to defraud, constitutes
wire fraud. The passage also highlights the requirement for the
communication to cross state lines, which aligns with the facts of the case
where funds were transferred across state lines.
RICO: A Primer
Extract
Among other things, 'racketeering activities' include 'any act which is
indictable under' a list of federal criminal statutes. The list covers an
expansive range of violations, for example, violations of the Hobbs Act, 18
U.S.C. ' 1951 (extortion); 18 U.S.C. ' 1341 (mail fraud) and 1343 (wire
fraud)... A RICO enterprise includes 'any individual, partnership,
corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of
individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.' Courts have
interpreted 'enterprise' broadly, and the definition captures both legitimate
and illegitimate enterprises... A 'pattern' may exist where any combination
of two or more offenses occurred within a period of time... The racketeering
acts need not be similar or directly related to each other; rather, it is
sufficient that the racketeering acts are related in some way to the affairs of
the charged enterprise... The continuity requirement is likewise satisfied
where the predicates are a regular way of conducting the defendant's
ongoing legitimate business... A plaintiff may demonstrate a pattern by
establishment that the predicate acts pose a threat of continued criminal
activity... Section 1962(c), it is a violation to conduct the affairs of an
enterprise affecting interstate or foreign commerce 'through' a pattern of
racketeering activity or through the alternative theory of collection of an
unlawful debt.

individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.' Courts have
interpreted 'enterprise' broadly, and the definition captures both legitimate
and illegitimate enterprises... A 'pattern' may exist where any combination
of two or more offenses occurred within a period of time... The racketeering
acts need not be similar or directly related to each other; rather, it is
sufficient that the racketeering acts are related in some way to the affairs of
the charged enterprise... The continuity requirement is likewise satisfied
where the predicates are a regular way of conducting the defendant's
ongoing legitimate business... Section 1962(c), it is a violation to conduct
the affairs of an enterprise affecting interstate or foreign commerce
'through' a pattern of racketeering activity or through the alternative theory
of collection of an unlawful debt.

activity, which supports the claim that the actions described in the
proposition could constitute a RICO violation. The passage also highlights
the requirement of affecting interstate commerce, which is met by the
interstate transfer of funds and communications in the proposition.
