Question
1 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT WESTERN DISTRICT OF OKLAHOMA
CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, ) ) Plaintiff, ) ) v. ) No. CIV-24-1311-R ) DANIEL
KENNETH BRANTHOOVER; ) and MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS, ) )
Defendants. ) ORDER Before the Court is Defendant Daniel Kenneth
Branthoover’s Motion to Dismiss [Doc. No. 18], as well as Defendant Morgan
Michelle Myers’ Motion to Dismiss [Doc. No. 24]. Plaintiff Charles Dustin
Myers responded [Doc. Nos. 21 & 28], and Defendant Branthoover filed a
reply brief [Doc. No. 25]. The matter is now at issue.1 For the reasons that
follow, the Motions are GRANTED. BACKGROUND On December 14, 2023,
Plaintiff allegedly discovered that his wife, Defendant Myers, was having an
affair [Doc. No. 16, ¶ 19]. That same day, Defendant Myers opened a private
bank account and exchanged several text messages with Defendant
Branthoover. Id. The next day, Defendant Myers transferred $1,576.00 from
her joint account with Plaintiff to Defendant Branthoover, then traveled to
Defendant Branthoover’s home in 1 All parties to this action are proceeding
pro se. The Court therefore gives the pleadings a liberal construction but
does not act as an advocate. See Hall v. Bellmon, 935 F.2d 1106, 1110 (10th
Cir. 1991). Case 5:24-cv-01311-R Document 29 Filed 08/28/25 Page 1 of 8 2
Oklahoma to draft allegedly fraudulent legal documents. Id. ¶¶ 23, 25. This
transfer caused the account to be overdrawn, which harmed Plaintiff’s
business. Id. ¶ 26. Plaintiff contends that this transfer constitutes wire fraud
in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1343, and that Defendant Myers’ trip to Oklahoma
violated the Travel Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1952. Id. ¶¶ 25, 59, 74. On December 17,
2023, Defendant Myers allegedly “completed the interstate transportation
phase of the criminal scheme by transporting the fraudulent court
documents prepared in Oklahoma back across state lines to Texas. Id. ¶ 35.
These documents were filed in a Texas court the next day. Id. ¶ 39. On
January 16, 2024, Plaintiff was ordered to vacate the home he shared with
Defendant Myers. Id. ¶ 47. According to Plaintiff, this marked the
achievement of Defendants’ primary criminal objective. Id. ¶¶ 47-48.
Plaintiff filed this civil RICO suit under 18 U.S.C. §§ 1962(c) and (d).
Defendants have moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim and improper
venue.2 LEGAL STANDARD Dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) is proper when a
complaint fails “to state a claim upon which relief can be granted[.]” Fed. R.
Civ. P. 12(b)(6). “To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the complaint ‘must
contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief
that is plausible on its face.’” Brown v. City of Tulsa, 124 F.4th 1251, 1263
(10th Cir. 2025) (quoting Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009)). And
while the Court “must accept the truth of all properly alleged facts and draw
all reasonable inferences in 2 The Court notes that based on Plaintiff’s
allegations, a substantial part of the events giving rise to the litigation
occurred in this District, and therefore venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. §
1391(b)(2). Case 5:24-cv-01311-R Document 29 Filed 08/28/25 Page 2 of 8 3
the plaintiff’s favor, the plaintiff still ‘must nudge the claim across the line
from conceivable or speculative to plausible.’” Id. (quoting Brooks v. Mentor
Worldwide LLC, 985 F.3d 1272, 1281 (10th Cir. 2021)). “Mere ‘labels and
conclusions’ or ‘formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action’ will
not suffice.” Id. (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
(2007)). DISCUSSION “To plead a valid RICO claim, a plaintiff must
plausibly allege that a defendant ‘(1) conducted the affairs (2) of an
enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity.’” Johnson v.
Heath, 56 F.4th 851, 858 (10th Cir. 2022) (quoting George v. Urb. Settlement
Servs., 833 F.3d 1242, 1248 (10th Cir. 2016)). Because the Court finds that
Plaintiff did not adequately allege a pattern of racketeering activity, it tailors
its analysis to that element. “[A] RICO pattern requires that the racketeering
predicates relate to each other and amount to a threat of continued
racketeering activity.” Id. (citing H.J. Inc. v. Nw. Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229,
239 (1989)). “[R]acketeering predicates relate to each other if they ‘have the
same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of
commission, or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics
and are not isolated events.’” Id. at 859 (quoting H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 240).
“Predicate acts satisfy the relationship requirement when they make up one
common scheme.” Id. (citing Sil-Flo, Inc. v. SFHC, Inc., 917 F.2d 1507, 1516
(10th Cir. 1990)). The standard is “‘not a cumbersome one.’” Id. (quoting
Bixler v. Foster, 596 F.3d 751, 761 (10th Cir. 2010)). Case 5:24-cv-01311-R
Document 29 Filed 08/28/25 Page 3 of 8 4 The continuity requirement on the
other hand is “more stringent than the relationship standard.” Id. (citing
Bixler, 596 F.3d at 761). Continuity “‘depends on the facts of each case[],’”
id. (quoting H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 241-42), and “can be either closed or open
ended[,]” id. (citing H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 241). “Closed-ended continuity is a
closed period of repeated racketeering conduct, while open-ended continuity
consists of racketeering conduct that threatens future repetition.” Id. (citing
H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 241). “Plaintiffs can establish open-ended continuity by
showing that the racketeering acts involved implicit or explicit threats of
repetition, that they formed the operations of an association that exists for
criminal purposes, or that they were the defendants’ regular way of
conducting a legitimate enterprise.” Id. at 859-60 (citing H.J. Inc., 492 U.S.
at 242-43). “[C]losed-ended continuity consists of a closed period of
repeated, related racketeering acts that do not necessarily threaten future
repetition.” Id. at 860 (citing H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 241-42). And “[b]ecause
RICO targets long-term racketeering conduct, closed-ended continuity
requires a series of related racketeering acts over a ‘substantial period of
time.’” Id. (quoting H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 242). Two factors are relevant to
determine whether there is closed-ended continuity: “the duration of the
related predicate acts and the extensiveness of the racketeering scheme. Id.
(citation omitted). Regarding the first factor, “predicate acts extending over
a few weeks or months do not show closed-ended continuity.” Poindexter v.
Stuteville, No. CIV-12-0031-F, 2012 WL 13035041, at *7 (W.D. Okla. May 10,
2012) (citing Resol. Tr. Corp. v. Stone, 998 F.2d 1534, 1543 (10th Cir. 1993)),
abrogated on other grounds by Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938 (2009)).
For the second factor, courts “consider ‘the number of victims, the number
of racketeering acts, Case 5:24-cv-01311-R Document 29 Filed 08/28/25
Page 4 of 8 5 the variety of racketeering acts, whether the injuries were
distinct, the complexity and size of the scheme, and the nature or character
of the enterprise.’” Johnson, 56 F.4th at 860 (quoting Resol. Tr. Corp., 998 F.
2d at 1543). Plaintiff alleges that Defendants’ “scheme extends over a
substantial period of time—from December 2023 through May 2025, over
eighteen months[,]” Doc. No. 16, ¶ 86(i). The predicate acts—wire fraud and
violation of the Travel Act—took place within days of each other in
December of 2023. Id. ¶¶ 83-84. Plaintiff claims that Defendants’ alleged

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
scheme “achieved its primary criminal objective” on January 16, 2024, when
he was ordered to vacate the family home. Id. ¶ 47. So it took just over one
month from the formation of the alleged enterprise to complete its primary
goal. Nevertheless, Plaintiff points to the following to demonstrate the
duration of the scheme: • Defendants’ continued interstate communication
regarding the case “in direct furtherance of their fraudulent scheme to see
the divorce through to its finalization[;]” • Defendant Branthoover’s June 23,
2024, text message to Plaintiff stating “Lol. And here comes another
denial[;]” • Defendant Branthoover’s December 12, 2024, text message to
Plaintiff stating "When things all over you get to deal with me. Just a heads
up[;]” • Defendant Branthoover’s statement “I’ve been enjoying watching
every filing get denied[;]” and • Defendant Branthoover’s May 24, 2025, text
message to Plaintiff stating “Where’s my lawsuit? Heard your vm about me.
File it. Let’s do this :)[.]” Id. ¶¶ 49-52. But the communications between
Defendants and the text messages from Defendant Branthoover are not
related to the initial scheme, nor do they show continuity sufficient to
demonstrate a pattern of racketeering activities. Case 5:24-cv-01311-R
Document 29 Filed 08/28/25 Page 5 of 8 6 Beginning with the relatedness
prong, Plaintiff does not allege that the text messages from Defendant
Branthoover were sent with the intention of defrauding Plaintiff of money, or
to create and file fraudulent court documents. See Doc. No. 16, ¶ 101
(claiming that the purpose of the predicate acts was “to defraud Plaintiff of
his property interests and manipulate judicial proceedings”). Instead, he
alleges that these texts evidence retaliation, malice, and involvement in the
Texas litigation. Id. ¶¶ 49-52. Aside from being temporally distinct, the
messages are distinct in character from the initial alleged scheme and do
not evidence criminal conduct. And as for the alleged interstate
communications between Defendants regarding the case, this allegation is
conclusory and does not demonstrate that the communications relate to the
initial common scheme to defraud Plaintiff and to file false documents
created across state lines. Id. ¶ 101. Accordingly, Plaintiff has failed to meet
the bar of relatedness sufficient to show a pattern of racketeering activity.3
The same is true for the continuity prong of the pattern requirement.
Plaintiff points to the text messages from Defendant Branthoover and the
continuing communication between Defendants as evidence of an implicit or
explicit threat of repetition. But these messages—while taunting—do not
plausibly support a continuing threat of criminal conduct. Neither do the
vaguely pled claims of continued communications between Defendants. So
Plaintiff fails to demonstrate open-ended continuity. 3 Plaintiff alleges that
perjury and subornation of perjury sufficiently connect the predicate acts of
wire fraud and violation of the Travel Act. Doc. No. 16, ¶¶ 87-88. Assuming
without deciding that is true, he still does not relate the text messages and
on-going communication to the predicate acts that were performed in
December of 2023 and successfully completed in January of 2024. Case
5:24-cv-01311-R Document 29 Filed 08/28/25 Page 6 of 8 7 Regarding
closed-ended continuity, “it is well established that a single scheme to
accomplish one discrete goal, directed at a finite group of individuals, with
no potential to extend to other persons or entities, rarely will suffice to
establish a threat of continuing racketeering activity.” Pagel v. Wash. Mut.
Bank, Inc., 153 F. App’x 498, 502 (10th Cir. 2005) (collecting cases). Plaintiff
alleges a scheme that achieved its primary objective within one month of its
formation, harmed only one victim, had no potential to harm others, involved

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
two predicate acts of an isolated nature, and consisted of two individuals.
And even if the scheme lasted over 18 months, when considering the factors
set out in Resolution Trust, Plaintiff alleges “at best…a closed-ended series
of predicate acts constituting a single scheme to accomplish a discrete goal
directed at only one individual with no potential to extend to other persons
or entities.” Poindexter, 2012 WL 13035041, at *7 (citing Hall v. Witteman,
584 F.3d 859, 867-68 (10th Cir. 2009)). This is insufficient to establish
closed-ended continuity. “Courts have uniformly and consistently held that
schemes involving a single, narrow purpose and one or few participants
directed towards a single victim do not satisfy the RICO requirement of a
closed or open pattern of continuity.” Skurkey v. Daniel, No. CIV-22-496-R,
2023 WL 101946, at *6 (W.D. Okla. Jan. 4, 2023) (citation and quotation
marks omitted). Because that is the exact scheme Plaintiff alleges, he has
failed to plead a viable civil RICO claim regarding Defendants’ purported
scheme.4 4 Plaintiff’s claims for conspiracy under § 1962(d) likewise fails.
See Skurkey, 2023 WL 101946, at *6 (“Because Plaintiff has no viable claim
under § 1962(c), the subsection (d) conspiracy claim fails as a matter of
law.”). Case 5:24-cv-01311-R Document 29 Filed 08/28/25 Page 7 of 8 8
CONCLUSION Accordingly, Defendants’ Motions are GRANTED, and this
case is DISMISSED.5 IT IS SO ORDERED this 28th day of August, 2025. 5
Defendant Myers’ unsigned Motion to Dismiss [Doc. No. 23], and Plaintiff’s
Motion to Strike [Doc. No. 26] are denied as moot. Case 5:24-cv-01311-R

45 III. PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 11. At the heart of this litigation lies a
deliberate and orchestrated scheme by Defendants Morgan Michelle Myers
and Daniel Kenneth Branthoover, who strategically chose to displace
Plaintiff from his home and destabilize his financial and familial security.
Branthoover administered and Myers meticulously executed a calculated
plan involving interstate travel, fraudulent affidavits, deliberate petjury,
asset diversion, and systematic manipulation of multiple Texas state courts
to escape accountability for her actions. 12. To carry out this scheme, Myers
enlisted the assistance of Daniel Kenneth Branthoover, a resident of Yukon
Oklahoma, who has a prior history regarding violations of protective orders
and tampering with government documents. For no other reason than to
escape accountability for her affair, Myers spun an elaborate web of lies and
weaponized her family and court procedures designed to help victims of
abuse. 13. What emerges from the evidence is not a domestic dispute gone
awry, but a textbook criminal enterprise created within this Court's
Jurisdiction. This is the story of how a person corruptly influenced the very
courts designed to protect familiestransforming them into instruments of
fraud, extortion, and systematic theft. It is a tale of how two individuals,
connected by a common goal, orchestrated a seventeen-month reign of
terror that began in Oklahoma and was carried out in the Texas courts. 14.
The Defendants did not merely lie to courts-they constructed an elaborate
criminal enterprise with defined roles, coordinated operations, and a
singular mission: to strip Plaintiff of eve1ything he held dear through the
systematic corruption of judicial 4 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed
06/24/25 Page 5 of 45 proceedings. They engaged in laundering funds
across state lines while concurrently submitting fraudulent indigency claims.
They did not just fabricate allegations-they manufactured an entire false
narrative of domestic violence, complete with non-existent protective orders
and imaginary threats, all while the supposed "victim" continued to share a
bed with her alleged "abuser." 15. This case shows how the family court
system can be perverted by those willing to commit federal crimes to
achieve their goals. It reveals how easily the sacred trust placed in sworn
affidavits can be shattered by defendants who view perjury not as a crime,
but as a tool. Most importantly, it demonstrates that when domestic
relations become the vehicle for interstate racketeering, federal intervention

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
is not just appropriate-it is essential. 16. This is not a story about a marriage
that failed. This is simply the product of a litigant who values her
extramarital relationships over morality, and who chose to weaponize her
family against Plaintiff for the sole purpose of escaping accountability. 17.
After extensive research and vigorous advocacy, Plaintiff asserts that
Defendants engaged in racketeering activity through an organized
enterprise, seeking relief to prevent its finalization. Against all odds, and in
support of this preliminruy statement, Plaintiff alleges the following: 5 Case
5:24-cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 6 of 45 IV.
FACTUALALLEGATIONS A. Enterprise Formation and Initial Criminal
Coordination (December 14-15, 2023) 18. Defendant Branthoover possesses
extensive knowledge of protective order procedmes and requirements due to
his prior criminal convictions involving violations of such orders. This
knowledge would prove instrumental in the enterprise's systematic
manipulation of protective order proceedings. 19. On December 14, 2023,
immediately following Plaintiffs discovery of Defendant Myers' extramarital
affair, she initiated the criminal enterprise by taking two coordinated
actions: first, she opened a private bank account in her sole name to
facilitate asset concealment; and second, she commenced intensive
interstate communications with Defendant Branthoover via text messaging.
The scope and intensity of these communications-totaling 92 text messages
exchanged between Branthoover's registered number 940-312-3434 and
Myers' registered number 817-235-5189 on this single daydemonstrates the
deliberate and coordinated nature of their criminal planning. 20. While
coordinating with Branthoover, Defendant Myers tried to secure an exparte
protective order against Plaintiff, without legitimate cause. This action
marks the enterprise's first attempt to manipulate judicial proceedings
through false allegations. 21. Despite having just sought emergency
protection from Plaintiff hours earlier, Myers casually reminded him of their
child's school field trip scheduled for the following day, thereby creating a
facade of normalcy designed to conceal her fraudulent intentions and
prevent suspicion of the enterprise's activities. 6 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R
Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 7 of 45 B. Interstate Criminal
Coordination and Financial Crimes (December 15-16, 2023) 22. On
December 15, 2023, at precisely 9:51 A.M. CST, Defendant Branthoover
contacted Plaintiff directly, employing calculated deception by stating, "I've
been where you are before. I want to help both of you." This communication,
referencing Myers' December 1, 2023 divorce announcement, was designed
to establish false pretenses for Myers' planned interstate travel to Oklahoma
for criminal coordination purposes. 23. During this deceptive phone
conversation, Branthoover established the operational framework for the
next phase of the criminal scheme by atl'anging for Myers to visit his
Oklahoma residence over the weekend of December 15, 2023. The stated
purpose-"providing space" to Myers-was a deliberate misrepresentation
designed to conceal the true criminal purpose of coordinating fraudulent
document preparation and enterprise operations. 24. Having no reason to
suspect Branthoover's dishonest intentions, Plaintiff unwittingly facilitated
the enterprise's criminal coordination by agreeing to Myers' travel to
Oklahoma. 25. Immediately following Branthoover's deceptive phone call,
the enterprise executed its first major financial crime. Plaintiff received
notification that Myers had transfetl'ed $1,576 from the parties' joint marital
PNC account to Branthoover's Pay Pal account (usemame "dmb575"),

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
completely depleting the account balance. This interstate wire transfer
represents a critical predicate act, utilizing interstate commerce to further
the criminal scheme while simultaneously depriving Plaintiff of operating
funds necessary for his legitimate business operations, household bills, and
Christmas gifts. 7 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 8
of 45 26. The immediate and devastating impact of this financial crime
became apparent on December 16, 2023, when Plaintiff received notification
that the joint marital PNC account was overdrawn by $800.00. Concurrently,
Plaintiff discovered that advertisements for his legitimate home-based
business had ceased running due to payment failure directly caused by the
enterprise's theft of operating funds. This demonstrates the enterprise's
deliberate intent to cause maximum financial harm to Plaintiff. 27. The
criminal nature of this financial transaction is conclusively established by
documentary evidence. The PNC bank statement for December 2023
provides irrefutable proof of the unauthorized withdrawal, documenting the
precise date, amount, and destination of the :fraudulent transfer. 28. The
direct connection between Defendant Branthoover and this financial crime is
established through multiple forms of evidence. The PayPal identifier
"dmb575" appearing on Plaintiffs bank statement directly corresponds to
Branthoover's Pay Pal account, creating an unbreakable evidentiary chain
linking him to the illicit financial transaction, c01Toborated by his own
admissions in subsequent text communications. 29. On December 16, 2023,
at precisely 3:54 P.M. CST, Plaintiff made a goodfaith attempt to resolve the
situation amicably by sending a detailed text message to Defendant
Branthoover. This communication explicitly requested the return of the
fraudulently transferred $1,576, detailed the intended legitimate use of
these funds, described the financial hardship caused by the theft (including
late bills and business disruption), explained Plaintiff's inability to work due
to the severe emotional distress 8 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed
06/24/25 Page 9 of 45 caused by Defendants' criminal actions, and
expressed his sincere desire for an amicable resolution during the holiday
season. 30. Defendant Branthoover's response to this reasonable request
revealed the true criminal nature of the enterprise. In a callous and
dismissive reply, Branthoover stated, "You Are Getting Divorced ... " followed
by, "I hope I can help with the paperwork and make things go as smoothly as
possible." Far from the helpful assistance initially promised, this
communication constituted a direct threat and overt act in furtherance of
the criminal conspiracy, demonstrating Branthoover's intent to exploit
Plaintiffs financial distress for the enterprise's benefit while utilizing
interstate communications to further the scheme. 31. This communication
also establishes Branthoover's unauthorized practice of law across state
lines. At no time relevant to this litigation has Defendant Branthoover
possessed a license to practice law in any jurisdiction within the United
States. His statements regarding "paperwork" and making legal proceedings
"go as smoothly as possible" constitute clear evidence of unauthorized legal
practice and demonstrate his administrative role in directing the
enterprise's criminal activities. C. Coordinated Eviction Attempt Fraud and
Interstate Document Transportation (December 17, 2023) 32. On December
17, 2023, at approximately 11 :00 A.M., Plaintiff was served with an eviction
notice by the grandmother of Myers, who is also the landlord of the
matrimonial residence, which contained the following false information: 1. A
purported "lease violation," which was entirely fabricated as no 9 Case 5:24-

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 10 of 45 valid lease
agreement existed between Plaintiff and Wilson; 11. The assertion that
"Granddaughter getting divorced," referring to Defendant Myers, as a basis
for eviction; iii. The false claim that a "Protective order has been filed." 1v.
The directive that "He must leave. She and the girls may stay,"
demonstrating the clear intent to dispossess Plaintiff for the benefit ofMyers.
33. The coordinated and premeditated nature of this eviction fraud is
established by the timing of its execution. At the precise moment this
fraudulent notice was being served in Texas, Defendant Myers was
physically present in Oklahoma with Defendant Branthoover, actively
collaborating in the preparation of the very fraudulent court documents
referenced in the eviction notice. 34. Myers' knowledge of the fraudulent
nature of the eviction attempt is conclusively established. She possessed
actual knowledge that no valid lease agreement existed, and she had actual
knowledge that neither divorce proceedings nor protective orders had been
filed at the time of service, making her participation in the eviction fraud a
knowing and willful criminal act. 35. On December 17, 2023, Defendant
Myers completed the interstate transportation phase of the criminal scheme
by transporting the fraudulent court documents prepared in Oklahoma back
across state lines to Texas. These documents, including the Original Petition
for Divorce and Affidavit oflndigency, were specifically 10 Case 5:24-
cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 11 of 45 prepared with the
intent of submitting them to Texas state courts to further the enterprise's
fraudulent manipulation of judicial proceedings. 36. Upon her return to
Texas, Myers demonstrated her control over the eviction fraud by personally
destroying the fraudulent eviction notice. She physically tore the notice in
half and wrote "VOID" on it in black marker, providing clear evidence of her
influence over and coordination of the fraudulent eviction attempt
orchestrated during her absence in Oklahoma. D. Operational Security and
Document Preparation (December 17-18, 2023) 37. As part of the
enterprise's operational security measures, Defendant Myers returned from
Oklahoma equipped with a canister of pepper spray, designed to support the
false narrative of domestic violence that would be central to the fraudulent
comt documents prepared during her Oklahoma visit. 38. During her
Oklahoma visit, Defendant Myers acquired a secondary phone number
(817-940-0852) as a deliberate operational security measure. This
acquisition, which she explicitly disclosed to Plaintiff, constituted an overt
act in furtherance of the criminal enterprise, designed to facilitate
clandestine communications related to the fraudulent scheme while
concealing the enterprise's ongoing criminal coordination from detection.
39. This newly acquired secondary phone number became an integral
component of the fraudulent court documents prepared under Defendant
Branthoover's direct administrative oversight. The systematic use of this
number across multiple fraudulent legal documents demonstrates the
coordinated nature of the enterprise's document 11 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R
Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 12 of 45 preparation activities. These
documents, prepared in Oklahoma with the specific intent of unlawfully
influencing Texas legal proceedings, included: 1. An "Original Petition for
Divorce" dated December 18, 2023, containing numerous material false
statements designed to deceive the Texas courts; 11. An "Affidavit
oflndigency" dated December 18, 2023, containing deliberate
misrepresentations regarding Myers' financial status to defraud the court of

=== PAGE 9 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
legitimate filing fees; iii. A "Request for Uncontested Cases" dated
December 18, 2023, fraudulently filed despite the complete absence of any
communication between the parties regarding divorce proceedings; 1v. An
"Application for Protective Order" dated December 22, 2023, containing
entirely fabricated allegations of family violence. E. Unauthorized Practice
of Law and Intimidation (December 18, 2023) 42. 40. Following the filing of
the initial fraudulent divorce documents on December 18, 2023, Defendant
Branthoover escalated his unauthorized practice of law by sending Plaintiff a
text message asserting legal representation and attempting to control all
future communications. The message stated: "Charlie, its come to my
understanding you have retained an attorney. I'm sure he has told you that
all further communication should take place between attorneys. I must
formally ask you refrain from discussing details of this case with my client
moving forward and only communicate with me or your attorney." 12 Case
5:24-cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 13 of 45 This
communication was a deliberate attempt to isolate Plaintiff from direct
communication with Myers and to control the flow of information, thereby
hindering Plaintiff's ability to uncover the full extent of the fraudulent
scheme. This communication also evidences that Branthoover's role went
beyond helping Myers prepare the documents by seeing them through to
their submission and asserting an administrative role over the proceedings
to intimidate Plaintiff. F. Service Through Official Channels and Continued
Deception (December 22-28, 2023) 41. In furtherance of the criminal
scheme, and despite continuing to cohabitate with Plaintiff in the marital
residence, Defendant Myers deliberately utilized official constable service to
effectuate service of the fraudulent divorce petition and protective order
application, which occurred on December 27, 2023. This calculated use of
official legal processes to serve fraudulent documents while maintaining the
deceptive facade of normalcy at home demonstrates the sophisticated and
deliberate nature of the enterprise's operations. 42. The enterprise's
manipulation of official legal processes continued when Myers, despite
residing next door to Plaintiff, deliberately influenced and coordinated the
constable service of the fraudulent eviction documents, which occurred on
December 28, 2023. This systematic abuse of official legal processes while
maintaining physical proximity and continued cohabitation reveals the
calculated and deceptive nature of the enterprise's operations. 13 Case 5:24-
cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 14 of 45 G. Systematic False
Statements in Sworn Court Documents (December 18, 2023) 43. When
reviewing the documents prepared in part by Branthoover and filed with the
court by Myers, there existed several false statements and were intended to
deceive the court and prejudice Plaintiff in furtherance of the scheme to
dispose him of his property interests. Specifically, these false statements
included, but were not limited to: 1. The assertion that the spouses had
ceased living together on December 1, 2023, when in fact they were still
residing together at the marital home on that date and for several weeks
thereafter. 11. The claim that Defendant Myers owned both family vehicles
as her separate property prior to the marriage, which was demonstrably
false as these vehicles were acquired during the marriage and constituted
community property, paid for by Plaintiff. m. The representation that
Defendant Myers had an active order of protection against Plaintiff with a
judicial finding that family violence had occurred during the marriage, which
was fabricated and without any basis in fact or law. 1v. The assertion that

=== PAGE 10 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
the children or Defendant Myers would be subjected to harassment or abuse
if Plaintiff were provided with her second phone number (817-940-0852)
acquired in Oklahoma, which was a baseless and manipulative claim
designed to conceal her communications related to the fraudulent scheme.
14 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 15 of 45 44.
Concurrently with the fraudulent divorce petition, Defendant Myers, again
with the administrative oversight and full knowledge of Defendant
Branthoover, filed a fraudulent "Affidavit of Indigency" with the court. This
affidavit contained material misrepresentations regarding Defendant Myers'
fmancial status, all of which were known to be false at the time of filing and
were intended to defraud the court and avoid legitimate court costs.
Specifically, these false statements included: 1. The claim that Defendant
Myers was financially indigent and unable to pay comi costs, despite her
access to and control over substantial marital assets. 11. The representation
that Defendant Myers was solely responsible for all family living expenses,
including rent, utilities, food, and other living expenses, when in fact,
Plaintiff was the primary breadwinner of the household at that time. 111.
The asse1tion that Defendant Myers was solely responsible for both car
payments, which she has no payment history to suppmi such a claim. H.
Escalation Through Fabricated Violence Allegations (December 22, 2023)
45. On December 22, 2023, despite having claimed in her divorce petition to
already possess an active protective order, Myers filed an "Application for
Protective Order," revealing the contradictory and fabricated nature of her
previous representations while escalating the enterprise's fraudulent
manipulation of judicial proceedings. 15 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R Document 16
Filed 06/24/25 Page 16 of 45 46. Upon review, defendant Myers made
additional false statements within the sworn document, all intended to
further deceive the court and secure an unwarranted protective order
against Plaintiff to effectuate the enterprises' goal of divesting him of his
property interests. These false statements included, but were not limited to:
i. The claim that family violence occurred on December 18, 2023, in the
presence of the children, which was entirely false and fabricated. 11. The
assertion that family violence occurred prior to December 18, 2023, which
was also false and without any factual basis. 111. The request that Plaintiff
take a battering intervention program. I. Achievement of Primary Criminal
Objective (January 16, 2024) 47. On January 16, 2024, the enterprise's
criminal scheme achieved its primary objective when Plaintiff appeared
before the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County and was ordered to vacate
the family residence. Significantly, this order was entered without any
evidentiary hearing and without judicial findings regarding the allegations
contained in the fraudulent documents, demonstrating that the court's
decision was based entirely on the false information systematically
presented by the Defendants. 48. The causal relationship between the
Defendant's fraudulent representations and this judicial outcome is
conclusively established. The misinformation presented to the court through
the coordinated fraudulent documents was the sole basis for the comt's
decision, providing Myers with the exact advantage that she and
Branthoover had anticipated and planned through significant and intentional
misrepresentations. 16 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed 06/24/25
Page 17 of 45 J. Ongoing Pattern of Racketeering Activity and Continuity
( January 2024 - Present) 49. Between January 16, 2024, and the present
day, Defendants Myers and Branthoover have continued to further their

=== PAGE 11 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
racketeering activity through a series of ongoing illicit acts, demonstrating a
clear pattern of continuity and relatedness. These acts include, but are not
limited to: 1. Myers and Branthoover continuing to engage in interstate
communications regarding case details between one another across state
lines, specifically between Texas and Oklahoma, in direct fwtherance of
their :fraudulent scheme to see the divorce through to its finalization. 11.
Branthoover delivering ongoing threats and intimidation to Plaintiff
regarding his legitimate attempts to seek legal relief from the orders that
were a product of the Defendants' actions, which occurred in December of
2023, June of 2024, December of 2024, and May of 2025. 111. Making direct
statements such as "I've been enjoying watching every filing get denied" by
Branthoover, showing the malicious intent behind his involvement as
Plaintiff sought relief for their coordinated actions. 50. On June 23, 2024,
Defendant Branthoover continued his pattern of harassment and
intimidation by sending Plaintiff a text message stating, "Loi. And here
comes 17 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 18 of 45
another denial," in direct reference to Plaintiffs court filing seeking to enjoin
Branthoover as a party to the divorce proceedings. This communication
provides conclusive evidence of Branthoover's continued awareness of and
active involvement in the Texas legal proceedings, his ongoing monitoring of
court filings, and his malicious intent to mock and intimidate Plaintiff's
efforts to seek justice through legitimate legal channels. 51. On December
12, 2024, Branthoover escalated his threatening communications by sending
Plaintiff a message stating, "When things all over you get to deal with me.
Just a heads up," demonstrating the enterprise's ongoing criminal intent and
explicit threats of future retaliation against Plaintiff for his efforts to expose
and seek relief from their criminal activities. 52. Most recently, on May 24,
2025, Branthoover sent Plaintiff a message stating, "Where's my lawsuit?
Heard your vm about me. File it. Let's do this:)" This communication
demonstrates the enterprise's continued operation, Branthoover's ongoing
monitoring of Plaintiffs activities, and his explicit challenge and threat
regarding potential legal action, providing clear evidence of the enterprise's
ongoing criminal intent and the continuing threat posed to Plaintiff. 53. As a
direct result of the actions outlined above, Plaintiff has sustained substantial
injury to his business and property. 54. Plaintiff now turns to discuss the
elements of RICO and the alleged predicate acts committed by the
Defendants in this matter. 18 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed
06/24/25 Page 19 of 45 V. INTRODUCTION TO RICO 55. Plaintiff realleges
and incorporates by reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1
through 54 above, as if fully set forth herein. 56. The Racketeer Influenced
and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) requires proof of a "pattern of
racketeering activity," which the Supreme Court has consistently held
consists of two essential elements: relatedness and continuity of predicate
acts. Based on the provided facts and the applicable law, the Defendants'
series of related acts spanning from December 2023 through May 2025
(approximately 18 months) satisfies both the relatedness requirement ( as
the acts share similar purposes, participants, and methods) and the
continuity requirement (as they extend over a substantial period of time)
necessary to establish a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO as
explained in more detail below. 57. For there to be a pattern of racketeering
activity, there must be conduct committed by an enterprise that is prohibited
under 18 U.S.C. § 1961. In the instant matter, Defendants are alleged to

=== PAGE 12 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
have committed several predicate acts, including wire fraud, violations of
the Travel Act, and perjury/subordination of perjury to support a pattern of
racketeering activity, as explained in more detail below. VI. PREDICATE ACT
- WIRE FRAUD (18 U.S.C. § 1343) 58. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by
reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 57 above, as if
fully set forth herein. 59. The relevant federal statutes in this analysis are 18
U.S.C. § 1343 (Wire Fraud) and 18 U.S.C. § 1961 (RICO Definitions). 19 Case
5:24-cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 20 of 45 60. Title 18
U.S.C. § 1343 states: "Whoever, having devised or intending to devise any
scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means
of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, transmits or
causes to be transmitted by means of wire, radio, or television
communication in interstate or foreign commerce, any writings, signs,
signals, pictures, or sounds for the purpose of executing such scheme or
artifice, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years,
or both." 61. The facts above establish all three elements of wire fraud
under 18 U.S.C. § 1343-a scheme to defraud, use of interstate wire
communications, and intent to deprive another of money or property-
qualifying it as a RICO predicate act under 18 U.S.C. § 1961. A. Scheme to
Defraud 62. The first element of wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343 is the
existence of "a scheme to defraud." As noted in United States v. Greenberg,
835 F.3d 295 (2nd Cir. 2016), this constitutes an "essential element" of the
crime. In the present case, Myers transferred $1,576 from a joint marital
PNC account to Branthoover's PayPal account, depleting the account
entirely. This transfer was not an isolated action but was accompanied by "a
series of coordinated text messages and phone calls" between Myers and
Branthoover regarding the scheme, and followed after a deceptive message
was sent from Branthoover to Plaintiff. 63. The coordination between the
parties through multiple communications channels demonstrates a
deliberate plan rather than a spontaneous or inadvertent action. As
a1ticulated in Mail and Wire Fraud, a "scheme to defraud requires a
material falsehood, material misrepresentation, or the concealment of a
material fact." By 20 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed 06/24/25
Page 21 of 45 transferring funds from a joint marital account without
apparent authorization from the joint account holder, Myers engaged in
conduct that reflects the concealment of material facts regarding the
disposition of marital assets. 64. The scheme in this case specifically
targeted marital funds, and community property, which are legally
considered shared property between spouses. By depleting the account,
Myers intentionally deprived the Plaintiff of access to funds to which he was
legally entitled. This satisfies the requirement that the scheme have "money
or property as the object of the scheme" as stated in Smulley v. Fed Haus.
Fin. Agency, 17-2666 (2nd Cir. Oct 05, 2018). B. Use of Interstate Wire
Communications 65. The second element of wire fraud requires the "use of
the mails or wires to further the scheme." United States v. Greenberg, 835 F.
3d 295 (2nd Cir. 2016). The facts demonstrate that Myers used interstate
wire communications in two distinct ways: 1. The transfer of $1,576 was
"executed via interstate wire (bank to Pay Pal)," which constitutes an
electronic transmission across state lines. 11. The transfer "was
accompanied by a series of coordinated text messages and phone calls
between Myers (in Texas) and Branthoover (in Oklahoma) regarding the
scheme." 66. Wire transmissions include interstate telephone calls or

=== PAGE 13 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
electronic transmissions. Furthermore, internet communications satisfy the
interstate nexus 21 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page
22 of 45 requirement, even in the absence of proof that a fraudulent
communication traveled through out-of-state servers. 67. The interstate
nature of these communications is established by the fact that Myers was in
Texas while Branthoover was in Oklahoma during their communications
about the scheme. This satisfies the jurisdictional requirement that the wire
communication cross state lines. C. Intend to Defraud 68. The third element
requires that the defendant acted "with the intent to defraud." As stated in
US. v. Blackmon, 839 F.2d 900 (2nd Cir. 1988), the wire fraud statute
requires that the defendant "be a party to some kind of scheme to defraud, a
requirement that includes a high degree of scienter and moral culpability."
69. Here, Branthoover specifically stated that he wanted to help Plaintiff,
which he knew was not a true statement at the time. The fact that text and
phone communications were used to deceive Plaintiff into believing that
Myers' interstate travel would be beneficial for him further supports a
scheme to defraud, because the transfer of funds occmTed after this false
extension of help from Branthoover. 70. In summary, the facts presented
establish all required elements of wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343,
qualifying it as a predicate act for RICO purposes under 18 U.S.C. § 1961,
committed by both Defendants. D. Potential Defenses 71. One potential
defense might be that Myers, as a joint account holder, had legal authority
to transfer funds from the account. However, this authority does not extend
to 22 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 23 of 45
depleting the account for personal gain in coordination with a third party
with the intent to deprive the other account holder of their rightful access to
the funds. The joint nature of the account creates a fiduciary duty to act in
good faith regarding the shared asset. That fiduciary duty was willingly
violated when Myers chose to transfer the funds to Branthoover's Pay Pal,
and then later to herself. The appropriate method would have been for
Myers to transfer the funds directly to herself, but she avoided this to
conceal her bank account information in furtherance of a broader scheme.
72. This argument fails because the proceeds from the transfer were used to
acquire a second phone in furtherance of the broader scheme. VII.
PREDICATE ACT-VIOLATION OF THE TRAVEL ACT (18 U.S.C. § 1952) 73.
Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations contained in
paragraphs 1 through 72 above, as if fully set forth herein. 74. The Travel
Act, codified at 18 U.S.C. § 1952, criminalizes interstate travel or the use of
interstate facilities with the intent to promote, manage, establish, carry on,
or facilitate unlawful activity, followed by the performance or attempted
performance of such acts. According to 18 U.S.C. § 1952: "Whoever travels
in interstate or foreign commerce or uses the mail or any facility in
interstate or foreign commerce, with intent to- ... otherwise promote,
manage, establish, carry on, or facilitate the promotion, management,
establishment, or can-ying on, of any unlawful activity, and thereafter
performs or attempts to perform- ... an act described in paragraph or shall
be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both ... " 75.
The statute has three essential elements: 1. Interstate travel or use of
interstate facilities 23 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed 06/24/25
Page 24 of 45 ii. Intent to promote, manage, establish, carry on, or facilitate
unlawful activity iii. Subsequent performance or attempted performance of
acts in fmtherance of the unlawful activity 76. For a Travel Act violation to

=== PAGE 14 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
serve as a RICO predicate act, it must be "indictable" under 18 U.S.C. §
1952. Myers' conduct, as analyzed above, satisfies all elements of a Travel
Act violation: 1. Myers engaged in interstate travel between Texas and
Oklahoma. 11. Myers traveled with the specific intent to coordinate the
preparation of fraudulent court documents and execute a criminal scheme.
Under United States v. Compton, 355 F.2d 872 (6th Cir. 1966), this intent
can be inferred from "evidence of a substantial course of illegal conduct,
occurring a reasonable time before and after an act of interstate travel." The
preparation of fraudulent court documents falls within the definition of
"unlawful activity" under the Travel Act, as it involves fraud, which is
indictable under state law. iii. After the interstate travel, Myers engaged in
overt acts to fu1ther the unlawful activity by preparing fraudulent legal
documents and coordinating the fraudulent scheme. As U.S. v. Admon, 940 F.
2d 1121 (8th Cir. 1991) clarified, the conduct after travel need not itself be
unlawful but must further the unlawful activity. The preparation and use of
fraudulent documents clearly meet this requirement. 24 Case 5:24-cv-01311-
R Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 25 of 45 77. Given that Myers' conduct
satisfies all elements of a Travel Act violation, this violation qualifies as an
"indictable" offense under 18 U.S.C. § 1952. As such, it constitutes a valid
predicate act for RICO purposes under 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1). 78. The Supreme
Court's explanation in Perrin v. United States, 444 U.S. 37 ( 1979) that the
Travel Act was intended to provide "a second layer of enforcement" for
interstate criminal activity underscores the significance of federalizing
crimes that cross state lines. Myers' conduct, involving interstate travel for
the purpose of engaging in fraudulent activities, is precisely the type of
behavior that the Travel Act was designed to address. VIII. PATTERN OF
RACKETEERING ACTIVITY 79. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by
reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 78 above, as if
fully set forth herein. 80. A "pattern of racketeering activity" requires at
least two acts of "racketeering activity" occun'ing within a ten-year period.
18 U.S.C. § 1961 (2025) ('"pattern of racketeering activity' requires at least
two acts of racketeering activity, one of which occwTed after the effective
date of this chapter and the last of which occurred within ten years
( excluding any period of imprisonment) after the commission of a prior act
of racketeering activity"). 81. However, the mere existence of two predicate
acts is not automatically sufficient to establish a pattern. As explained in
Bonton v. Archer Chrysler Plymouth, Inc., 889 F.Supp. 995 (S.D. Tex. 1995):
25 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 26 of 45
"Although at least two acts of racketeering are necessary to constitute a
pattern, two acts may not be sufficient. Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., 473
U.S. 479,496 n. 14, 105 S.Ct. 3275, 3285 n. 14, 87 L.Ed.2d 346 (1985).
RICO's legislative history leaves no doubt that 'there is something to a RICO
pattern beyond simply the number of predicate acts involved."' 82. Instead,
courts have established that to prove a pattern, the predicate acts must be
both related and continuous. Bustos v. Invierte En Tex. , 4:22-CV-02690 (S.D.
Tex. Jun 03, 2024) ("To rise to the level of 'racketeering activity' there must
be two or more predicate acts that are: (1) related; and (2) amount to or
pose a threat of continued criminal activity."). A. Establishing a Pattern of
Racketeering Activity 83. The factual allegations identify several instances
that constitute wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343 and violations of the Travel
Act under 18 U.S.C. § 1952: 1. The extensive text message communications
(92 exchanges) on December 14, 2023, between Myers and Branthoover

=== PAGE 15 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
using interstate wire facilities to coordinate their scheme. 11. Branthoover's
deceptive phone call to Plaintiff on December 15, 2023, where he falsely
stated, "I've been where you are before. I want to help both of you," to
facilitate Myers' interstate travel to Oklahoma. 111. The interstate wire
transfer of $1,576 from the joint marital account to Branthoover's PayPal
account, which was executed to deprive Plaintiff of funds. 26 Case 5:24-
cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 27 of 45 iv. Branthoover's text
messages to Plaintiff on December 16, 2023, refusing to return the
transferred funds and offering to "help with the paperwork." v.
Branthoover's text message on December 18, 2023, falsely claiming to be a
legal representative. v1. The ongoing interstate communications between
Myers and Branthoover to further their fraudulent scheme, continuing
through May 2025. 84. The factual allegations also demonstrate potential
Travel Act violations: 1. Myers' interstate travel from Texas to Oklahoma on
December 15, 2023, with the intent to prepare fraudulent court documents.
11. The interstate transportation of fraudulent documents from Oklahoma
back to Texas on December 17, 2023, intended for filing in Texas courts. iii.
The use of interstate facilities (phone calls, text messages) to coordinate and
further the fraudulent scheme. B. Relatedness of Predicate Acts 85. The
predicate acts of wire fraud and Travel Act violations are clearly related,
meeting the standard outlined in Bonton v. Archer Chrysler Plymouth, Inc.,
889 F.Supp. 995 (S.D. Tex. 1995). They share: 27 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R
Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 28 of 45 i. Common Purpose: All acts were
directed toward depriving Plaintiff of his property rights and manipulating
judicial proceedings to benefit Myers in divorce proceedings. 11. Same
Participants: Myers and Branthoover were the consistent actors in all
predicate acts. 111. Same Victim: All acts targeted Plaintiff, causing him
financial harm and depriving him of legal rights. 1v. Similar Methods: The
acts consistently involved deception, misrepresentation, and the
manipulation of legal processes. v. Temporal Connection: The acts occurred
in a logical sequence, beginning on December 14, 2023, and continuing
through May 2025. C. Continuity of Racketeering Activity 86. The pattern of
racketeering activity demonstrates both closed-ended and openended
continuity: 1. Closed-ended Continuity: The scheme extends over a
substantial period- from December 2023 through May 2025, over eighteen
months. This satisfies the requirement for "a series of related predicate acts
extending over a substantial period of time" as described in RICO: A Primer
(2022). 2 2 https://freemanlaw.com/rico-a-primer/ 28 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R
Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 29 of 45 11. Open-ended Continuity: The
scheme also poses a threat of continued criminal activity. Branthoover's
message on May 24, 2025, demonstrating continued monitoring of Plaintiffs
activities and threatening future retaliation, indicates that the racketeering
activity could continue indefinitely given that they are unable to finalize the
divorce. This satisfies the alternative requirement for "a threat of continuing
criminal activity extending indefinitely into the future" noted in RICO: A
Primer (2022). D. Role of Perjury and Subornation of Perjury 87. While
perjury and subornation of perjury in state court proceedings are not
themselves listed as predicate acts under RICO, they form an integral part of
the overall criminal scheme and help establish the pattern of racketeering
activity when considered alongside the actual predicate acts of wire fraud
and Travel Act violations. 88. As explained in RICO: A Primer (2022),
racketeering acts need not be similar or directly related to each other; they

=== PAGE 16 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
must simply be "related in some way to the affairs of the charged
enterprise." The perjury and subornation of perjury evident in the fraudulent
court filings- including the false statements in the divorce petition, the
Affidavit oflndigency, and the Application for Protective Order-are directly
related to the predicate acts of wire fraud and Travel Act violations. They
share the same purpose, involve the same participants, target the same
victim, and form part of the same overall scheme. For example: 29 Case
5:24-cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 30 of 45 1. The
fraudulent court documents were prepared during Myers' interstate travel
to Oklahoma, connecting the perjury to the Travel Act violation. 11. The
false statements in these documents were discussed and planned via
interstate wire communications, connecting the perjury to the wire fraud.
111. The deceptive interstate wire transfer of funds was executed to support
Myers during the divorce proceedings initiated through fraudulent filings. iv.
The perjerous statements were influenced by Branthoover, connecting
subordination of perjury to the predicate acts. 89. These connections
demonstrate how the non-predicate acts of perjury committed by Myers and
subornation of perjury alleged against Branthoover, while not sufficient
alone to establish a RICO violation, contribute to the overall pattern of
racketeering activity when combined with the predicate acts of wire fraud
and Travel Act violations alleged by the Defendants. IX. ESTABLISHING AN
ASSOCIATE-IN-FACT ENTERPRISE 90. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates

if fully set forth herein. 30 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed
06/24/25 Page 31 of 45 A. Formation of the Enterprise 91. The factual
allegations demonstrate the formation of an associate-in-fact enterprise
between Myers and Branthoover that satisfies the definition in 18 U.S.C. §
1961 (2025). i. Myers and Branthoover associated for the common purpose
of depriving Plaintiff of his property rights through the manipulation of legal
proceedings. This shared objective is evident from their coordinated actions
beginning on December 14, 2023, immediately following Plaintiffs discovery
of Myers' affair. ii. Though informal, the enterprise had a clear
organizational structure as 1) Myers acted as the "inside" operative, with
direct access to marital assets and the ability to file fraudulent court
documents in Texas. 2) Branthoover served as the "outside" operative,
providing administrative oversight, expertise on protective orders due to his
prior criminal history (Paragraph 18), and a base of operations in Oklahoma.
3) Their respective roles complemented each other and demonstrated an
organized approach to their criminal scheme. iii. The enterprise functioned
as a continuing unit from December 2023 through May 2025, with
consistent roles and coordinated actions throughout this period. 31 Case
5:24-cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 32 of 45 B. Maintenance
of the Enterprise 92. The enterprise was maintained through several key
mechanisms: 1. Continuous Communication: Myers and Branthoover
maintained regular interstate communications throughout the scheme,
beginning with the 92 text messages on December 14, 2023, and continuing
through May 2025. 11. Financial Support: The interstate wire transfer of
$1,576 from the joint marital account to Branthoover's Pay Pal account
provided financial resources to support the enterprise's activities. 111.
Operational Security Measures: The enterprise implemented specific
measures to protect its operations: 1) Myers acquired a secondary phone
number during her Oklahoma visit (Paragraph 38). 1v. Myers returned with

=== PAGE 17 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
pepper spray to support the false domestic violence narrative (Paragraph
37). v. Branthoover attempted to control communications by falsely claiming
legal representation (Paragraph 40). v1. Geographic Distribution: The
enterprise maintained operations across state lines, with activities in both
Texas and Oklahoma, enhancing its ability to avoid detection and complicate
legal responses. 32 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page
33 of 45 C. Enterprise Distinct from Racketeering Activity 93. As Allstate
Ins. Co. v. Donovan, CIVIL ACTION NO. H-12-0432 (S.D. Tex. Jul 03, 2012)
reiterates, a RICO enterprise must be an entity 'separate and apart from the
alleged pattern of racketeering'-not merely a conduit for the predicate acts
themselves. The nature and duration of the Myers-Branthoover operation
exhibits all three required elements: a separate organizational purpose,
defined roles within an enduring structure, and coordinated decision-making
extending beyond the January 16, 2024 initial outcome, with the finalization
of the scheme still pending. X. CLAIMS FOR RELIEF COUNT 1: VIOLATION
OF 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) Against All Defendants 94. Plaintiff realleges and
incorporates by reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through
93 above, as if fully set forth herein. 95. At all relevant times, Plaintiff was a
person within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961(3) and 1964(c). 96. At all
relevant times, each Defendant was a person within the meaning of 18
U.S.C. §§ 1961(3) and 1962(c). 97. As set forth above, Defendants Myers and
Branthoover formed an associationin- fact enterprise within the meaning of
18 U.S.C. § 1961(4) (the "Enterprise"). The Enterprise was engaged in, and
its activities affected, interstate commerce. 98. The Enterprise had an
ascertainable structure separate and apart from the pattern of racketeering
activity in which the Defendants engaged. The Enterprise 33 Case 5:24-
cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 34 of 45 maintained an
existence beyond that which was necessary to commit the predicate acts
constituting the pattern of racketeering activity. 99. In furtherance of the
fraudulent scheme, each Defendant conducted or participated, directly or
indirectly, in the conduct of the Enterprise's affairs through a pattern of
racketeering activity within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961(1), 1961(5),
and 1962(c). 100. As detailed above, the Defendants committed multiple
related acts of wire fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1343 and Travel Act
violations under 18 U.S.C. § 1952, and further committed acts of perjury and
subordinated perjury in furtherance of the scheme, constituting a pattern of
racketeering activity as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5). 101. The predicate
acts committed by the Defendants were related to each other in that they
had the same or similar purposes (to defraud Plaintiff of his property
interests and manipulate judicial proceedings), involved the same
participants (Defendants Myers and Branthoover), targeted the same victim
(Plaintiff), employed similar methods ( deception, misrepresentation, and
manipulation of legal processes), and were not isolated events. 102. The
predicate acts committed by the Defendants demonstrate both closedended
continuity, spanning over eighteen months from December 2023 through
May 2025, and open-ended continuity, as evidenced by the ongoing threats
and monitoring activities continuing through May 2025, with the potential
for continued criminal activity in the future. 34 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R
Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 35 of 45 103. The Defendants participated
in the operation and management of the Enterprise by making decisions on
behalf of the Enterprise and by directing its affairs. Specifically: 1.
Defendant Myers directed the Enterprise by initiating the criminal scheme,

=== PAGE 18 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
communicating the scheme's objectives to Branthoover, opening a private
bank account, transferring marital funds, traveling interstate to coordinate
fraudulent document preparation, and filing fraudulent legal documents in
Texas courts. 11. Defendant Branthoover directed the Enterprise by
providing administrative oversight of the scheme, offering his expertise on
protective order procedures, coordinating Myers' interstate travel, receiving
and retaining fraudulently transferred funds, preparing fraudulent legal
documents, and attempting to exert control over communications related to
the legal proceedings. l04. As a direct and proximate result of the
Defendants' violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), Plaintiff has been injured in his
business and property in an amount to be dete1mined at trial. Specifically,
Plaintiff has suffered: 1. Loss of $1,576 fraudulently transferred from the
joint marital account; 11. Business losses resulting from the disrnption of his
home-based business operations; 111. Additional financial damages
resulting from the overdrawn account 35 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R Document
16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 36 of 45 and associated fees; 1v. Loss of real and
personal property rights through the fraudulent manipulation of judicial
proceedings; v1. Ongoing damages resulting from the continued operation
of the Enterprise. 105. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c), Plaintiff is entitled to
recover from the Defendants threefold the damages sustained, explained in
more detail below. COUNT 2: VIOLATION OF 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d) Against All
Defendants 106. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the
allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 105 above, as if fully set forth
herein. 107. Beginning on December 14, 2023, and continuing through at
least May 24, 2025, the Defendants knowingly, willfully, and unlawfully
conspired to violate 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), that is, to conduct and participate,
directly and indirectly, in the conduct of the affairs of the Enterprise,
through a pattern of racketeering activity, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d),
as explained above. 108. The conspiracy between Myers and Branthoover
was formed on or about December 14, 2023, evidenced by the intensive
communications (92 text messages) exchanged between them immediately
following Plaintiffs discovery of Myers' extramarital affair. These
communications---documented in Plaintiff's possession and available for
production at the appropriate stage---demonstrate the deliberate and
coordinated formation of the conspiracy. 36 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R Document
16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 37 of 45 109. Each Defendant agreed that they
would commit at least two acts of racketeering activity in the conduct of the
affairs of the Enterprise. The agreement can be infened from the
Defendants' coordinated actions, including: 1. The systematic coordination
of their activities through interstate communications; 11. The division of
responsibilities within the Enterprise; iii. The implementation of operational
security measures; IV. The consistent pattern of actions furthering the
fraudulent scheme; v. The ongoing coordination over an eighteen-month
period. 110. In furtherance of the conspiracy, the Defendants committed
numerous overt acts, including but not limited to: I. Myers opening a private
bank account to facilitate asset concealment on December 14, 2023 and
sharing these details with Branthoover; ii. Myers and Branthoover
exchanging 92 text messages on December 14, 2023, to coordinate their
criminal plans; m. Branthoover placing a deceptive phone call to Plaintiff on
December 15, 2023; IV. Myers executing an interstate wire transfer of
$1,576 to Branthoover's PayPal account on December 15, 2023; v. Myers
traveling interstate to Oklahoma on December 15, 2023, to coordinate with

documents in 37 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 38
of 45 Oklahoma on December 16-17, 2023 to be later submitted in Texas
courts on December 18,22; vu. Myers transporting the fraudulent
documents back to Texas on December 17, 2023; vm. Branthoover sending
threatening text messages to Plaintiff on December 18, 2023; 1x. Myers
filing fraudulent documents with Texas courts on December 18, 2023; x.
Myers filing a fraudulent Application for Protective Order on December 22,
2023; x1. Branthoover continuing to send threatening communications to
Plaintiff through May 24, 2025. 111. As a direct and proximate result of the
Defendants' conspiracy in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d), Plaintiff has been
injured in his business and property. The injuries suffered by Plaintiff include
but are not limited to: 1. Loss of $1,576 fraudulently transferred from the
joint marital account; ii. Business losses resulting from the dismption of his
home-based business operations; iii. Additional financial damages resulting
from the overdrawn account and associated fees; 1v. Loss of real and
personal property rights through the fraudulent 38 Case 5:24-cv-01311-R
Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 39 of 45 manipulation of judicial
proceedings; v. Ongoing economic harm resulting from the continued
operation of the Enterprise. 112. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c), Plaintiff is
entitled to recover from the Defendants threefold the damages sustained,
explained in more detail below. XI. Damages 113. Plaintiff realleges and
incorporates by reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through
112 above, as if fully set forth herein. 114. As a direct result of the
racketeering activity alleged herein, the Plaintiff has sustained substantial
injury to his business operations, suffered significant credit decrease, has
lost business opportunities, had his personal belongings destroyed, has had
one vehicle repossessed, and has been subject to transient and unstable
housing. A. Damage to Business Operations 11 5. In January of 2021,
Plaintiff founded a digital financial analytics business from his home,
focused on delivering real-time stock market data, automated technical
indicators, and live market commentary to retail traders and boutique
investment groups across the United States and Canada. His monetization
model included tiered subscription plans, custom data feed licensing, and
API endpoints that offered real-time market data. 116. By 2022, client
demand and revenue growth began outpacing Plaintiff's initial architecture.
In response, Plaintiff made the strategic decision to pause direct
monetization in early 2023 to reinvest in infrastructure and ensure the
platform could handle commercial-scale traffic. This included: 39 Case 5:24-
cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 40 of 45 1. Designing and
deploying asynchronous financial signal algorithms, 11. Mastering
asynchronous programming, PostgreSQL and NoSQL systems for storage
and efficiency purposes, iii. Building websocket-based dashboards for live
data streaming, iv. Drafting licensing terms for premium indicator access
and reseller API use. v. Building pa1tnerships and affiliations with similar
businesses in the market-data space. This period of reinvestment came at
significant cost: Plaintiff temporarily sacrificed a revenue stream that had
reached $12,000 per month at its peak in exchange for longterm scalability.
Plaintiff anticipated a short-term revenue dip, which he strategically
absorbed in reliance on his imminent reentry to market. 117. By September
of 2023, Plaintiff had completed core backend optimization and UI
integrations and obtained an affiliate marketing partnership with polygon.io

=== PAGE 20 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
and was prepared to scale user acquisition and marketing. This readiness
marked a significant inflection point in Plaintiff's commercial trajectory. 118.
Plaintiff reasonably projected a return to $9,000-$10,000/month by mid-
2024, with a 24-month growth model targeting $170,124.59 in revenue
through subscriptions and data services alone. This forecast was based not
on speculation, but on verified revenue history, platform readiness, and
documented user engagement trends. 119. As part of Defendants'
coordinated scheme to deprive Plaintiff of his home and operational
capacity, Plaintiff was wrongfully and suddenly removed from the family 40
Case 5:24-cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 41 of 45 residence
in January 2024, despite Defendants' full knowledge that he operated an
active and income-generating business from that location. This action
caused a direct and immediate injury to Plaintiff's business, cutting off his
ability to scale as planned. Instead of growing, Plaintiff's revenue collapsed.
120. The removal was executed without warning or legal justification and
had an immediate effect on Plaintiff's operations. Although the core data
systems were technically portable, the business depended on commercial-
grade internet, low-latency upload speeds, and a consistent, uninterrupted
digital environment to support real-time financial analytics, streaming, and
API-based services. Following the removal, Plaintiff was unable to find
alternate housing with sufficient bandwidth. Attempts to work from
temporary family residences failed, as Plaintiff's usage either exceeded
available internet capacity or interfered with household connectivity, making
it impossible to maintain stable service. Without the ability to stream,
deliver data products, or support his clients, Plaintiffs revenue quickly
declined and client engagement deteriorated. 121. Between September and
December 2023, Plaintiff earned $10,529.72, averaging $2,632.43 per
month - his baseline earnings during the period of restructuring. Based on
past performance, technical stability, and confirmed subscriber growth
through marketing strategies, Plaintiff reasonably projected returning to
$5,000/month by mid- 2024, with stable, scalable performance continuing
through 2025. 122. Under a conservative model, had the business not been
disrupted by Defendants' interference, Plaintiff would have earned: 41 Case
5:24-cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 42 of 45 1.
Approximately $15,794.58 during the first half of 2024 (maintaining his pre-
removal baseline), ii. Approximately $24,000.00 during the second half of
2024 (with moderate growth to $4,000/month), 111. And approximately
$60,000.00 across 2025 (at $5,000/month). This yields a total projected
income of$99,794.58 for the 18-month period following the wrongful
removal. 123. Accordingly, Plaintiff seeks recovery of $99,794.58 in lost
business income directly caused by Defendants' pattern of racketeering
activity described above. B. Damages - Fraudulent Transfer and Cessation of
Business Advertisements 124. As noted above, Defendants coordinated in
emptying the joint marital PNC bank account, transferring $1,576.00 from
Plaintiff to a Pay Pal account controlled by Daniel Kenneth Branthoover,
which was subsequently routed to Morgan Michelle Myers. These funds
were used to purchase a second phone for Myers, enabling concealed
communication and coordination between Defendants in furtherance of their
scheme to defraud Plaintiff and obstruct his business operations.
Accordingly, Plaintiff therefore seeks recovery of the full amount of
$1,576.00. D. Damages - Total 126. As a direct result of the Defendants'
coordinated and fraudulent conduct detailed above, Plaintiff has sustained

=== PAGE 21 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
total economic losses in the amount of one hundred and one thousand three
hundred seventy dollars and fifty-eight cents. ($101,370.58). This 42 Case
5:24-cv-01311-R Document 16 Filed 06/24/25 Page 43 of 45 includes: i. $99,
794.58 in lost business income caused by Defendant's actions leading to
Plaintiff's wrongful removal from his residence and the destruction of his
operational infrastructure over the last 18 months; 11. $1,576.00 in marital
funds fraudulently transferred from Plaintiff's joint bank account in
furtherance of a scheme to defraud. 127. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c),
Plaintiff is entitled to treble damages for injuries sustained to his business
and property because of Defendants' racketeering activity. Accordingly,
Plaintiff seeks an award of treble damages in the total estimated amount of
three hundred and four thousand, one hundred and eleven dollars and
seventyfour cents ($304,111.74) to be further clarified at trial. 128. All
damages referenced herein are based on verifiable records and financial
documentation. Plaintiff will produce supporting evidence and exhibits at
the appropriate stage of these proceedings or at trial. Xll. PRAYER FOR
RELIEF 129. WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Charles Dustin Myers respectfully
requests that this Court enter judgment against Defendants Daniel Kenneth
Branthoover and Morgan Michelle Myers as follows: 1. For a specific finding

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
RESPECT IS POSSIBLE, EXPLAIN WHY PLAINTIFF SHOULD HAVE
RECONSIDERATION GRANTED. CITE BOTH THE ORDER AND THE
COMPLAINT The divorce litigation is ongoing, and the final disposition of
property and rights has not occurred. Plaintiff alleges that Defendants’
enterprise continues to operate with the goal of finalizing the fraudulent
scheme through further manipulation of the courts. A pattern of
racketeering activity requires at least two predicate acts that are related
and amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity. See 18 U.S.C. §
1961(5); H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 239-41. The Court’s Order (Order at 6-7) held
that the scheme was “single, narrow,” and directed at one victim, and thus
insufficient for RICO continuity. However, the FAC (¶¶ 49-52, 86(ii)) alleges
that the enterprise’s objective—fraudulent disposition of property through
the divorce—remains unfulfilled, and the risk of further predicate acts (e.g.,
perjury, wire fraud) is ongoing as the case proceeds. The threat of continued
racketeering activity is not speculative but grounded in the ongoing
litigation and Defendants’ conduct, as documented in the record. This
supports a finding of open-ended continuity and a pattern of racketeering
activity. 
Answer (Tenth Circuit)
Short response
The Court’s order granting dismissal overlooked well-pleaded allegations in
the First Amended Complaint that the alleged racketeering enterprise
remains ongoing, with the risk of further predicate acts as the divorce
litigation continues and the final disposition of property and rights remains
unresolved. Under controlling RICO authority, these facts plausibly support
open-ended continuity and a pattern of racketeering activity, warranting
reconsideration.
Summary
The Court dismissed Plaintiff’s RICO claims on the ground that the alleged
scheme was a single, narrow effort directed at one victim, with its primary
objective achieved when Plaintiff was ordered to vacate the home. However,
the First Amended Complaint specifically alleges that the enterprise’s
broader goal—fraudulent disposition of property through the divorce—
remains unfulfilled, and that the risk of further predicate acts (such as
perjury and wire fraud) is ongoing as the divorce litigation is still pending
and set for final trial.
Controlling Tenth Circuit and Supreme Court precedent make clear that a
RICO “pattern” can be established not only by a closed period of repeated
conduct, but also by a threat of continued criminal activity—open-ended
continuity—especially where the enterprise’s objective has not been fully
achieved and the risk of further predicate acts is real and ongoing. The
Court’s order did not address these ongoing risks, as alleged in the
complaint, and thus failed to apply the correct legal standard to the facts

pled. Reconsideration should be granted to allow the case to proceed on the
merits.
Background and Relevant Law
RICO Pattern: Relationship and Continuity
To state a civil RICO claim, a plaintiff must plausibly allege that the
defendant conducted the affairs of an enterprise through a pattern of
racketeering activity, which requires at least two predicate acts that are
related and amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity
(George v. Urban Settlement Servs., 833 F.3d 1242, 1248 (10th Cir. 2016); 
18 U.S.C. § 1961(5)). The Supreme Court in H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell
Telephone Co. clarified that “continuity” can be either closed-ended (a series
of related acts over a substantial period) or open-ended (a threat of
continuing criminal activity into the future) (H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell
Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 239-41 (1989); see also Resolution Trust Corp. v.
Stone, 998 F.2d 1534, 1543 (10th Cir. 1993)).
Open-ended continuity is established where the predicate acts themselves
involve a distinct threat of long-term racketeering activity, or where the
enterprise’s business is such that racketeering acts are its regular way of
operating (Tal v. Hogan, 453 F.3d 1244, 1267 (10th Cir. 2006); Gotfredson v.
Larsen Lp, 432 F.Supp.2d 1163, 1177 (D. Colo. 2006)). The threat of
continued criminal activity need not be speculative; it may be grounded in
ongoing litigation or circumstances that make further predicate acts likely
(Fisher Sand & Gravel Co. v. FNF Constr., Inc., No. 10-cv-0635 RB/SMV (D.
N.M. Mar 27, 2013); Suddath v. Oklahoma Homebuilders, LLC, CIV-24-745-
SLP (W.D. Okla. Nov 08, 2024)).
The Tenth Circuit has repeatedly held that even where a scheme targets a
single victim, if the plan contemplates open-ended fraudulent activity and
does not have a single goal that, when achieved, will bring the activity to an
end, continuity may be satisfied (Torwest DBC, Inc. v. Dick, 810 F.2d 925,
928 (10th Cir. 1987); Edwards v. First Nat. Bank, Bartlesville, Oklahoma,
872 F.2d 347, 351 (10th Cir. 1989)). Conversely, if the scheme is truly
isolated and its objective is fully achieved, continuity is lacking (Condict v.
Condict, 815 F.2d 579, 581 (10th Cir. 1987), but see subsequent negative
treatment in Maxwell v. Wilson, 766 P.2d 909 (N.M. 1988), which does not
affect the federal RICO analysis here).
Analysis
The Court’s Order and Its Reasoning
The Court’s order (Order at 6-7) concluded that Plaintiff failed to allege a
pattern of racketeering activity because the scheme was “single, narrow,”
directed at one victim, and achieved its primary objective—Plaintiff’s
removal from the home—within a month. The Court found that subsequent
communications and ongoing litigation did not relate to the initial scheme or

=== PAGE 24 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
show a threat of continued criminal conduct, and thus dismissed the RICO
claims.
What the Court Overlooked
1. Ongoing Nature of the Enterprise and Unfulfilled Objective
The First Amended Complaint (FAC) alleges that the enterprise’s broader
objective—fraudulent disposition of property and rights through the divorce
—remains unfulfilled, and that the divorce litigation is ongoing, with the
final trial still pending (FAC ¶¶ 49-52, 86(ii)). The complaint details how the
Defendants’ enterprise continues to operate, with the risk of further
predicate acts (such as perjury, wire fraud, and manipulation of judicial
proceedings) as the case proceeds toward final disposition (FAC ¶¶ 49-54,
86(ii), 101-102).
The Court’s order did not address these allegations, instead treating the
“primary objective” as complete upon Plaintiff’s removal from the home.
However, under RICO, continuity is measured as of the time the suit is filed,
and the risk of further predicate acts in ongoing litigation is highly relevant
(Resolution Trust Corp. v. Stone, 998 F.2d 1534, 1543 (10th Cir. 1993); 
Fisher Sand & Gravel Co. v. FNF Constr., Inc., No. 10-cv-0635 RB/SMV (D.
N.M. Mar 27, 2013)).
2. Open-Ended Continuity: Threat of Continued Criminal Activity
The Tenth Circuit and Supreme Court have made clear that open-ended
continuity exists where the predicate acts pose a threat of continued
criminal activity, especially where the enterprise’s business is not complete
and further acts are likely (H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S.
229, 241-42 (1989); Tal v. Hogan, 453 F.3d 1244, 1267 (10th Cir. 2006); 
Suddath v. Oklahoma Homebuilders, LLC, CIV-24-745-SLP (W.D. Okla. Nov
08, 2024)). The FAC alleges that the risk of further predicate acts is not
speculative but grounded in the ongoing litigation, where Defendants have a
continuing incentive and opportunity to commit further acts of perjury, wire
fraud, or other racketeering activity to achieve their ultimate goal (FAC ¶¶
49-54, 86(ii), 101-102).
The order’s focus on the completion of the “primary objective” ignores the
reality that the enterprise’s broader goal—fraudulent disposition of property
through the divorce—remains unachieved, and the litigation is still pending.
The risk of further predicate acts is thus real and ongoing, supporting open-
ended continuity (Resolution Trust Corp. v. Stone, 998 F.2d 1534, 1543 (10th
Cir. 1993); Fisher Sand & Gravel Co. v. FNF Constr., Inc., No. 10-cv-0635
RB/SMV (D. N.M. Mar 27, 2013); RICO: A Primer (2022)).
3. Relationship and Pattern
The FAC also pleads that the predicate acts are related: they share the same
purpose (fraudulent deprivation of Plaintiff’s property rights), involve the
same participants (Myers and Branthoover), target the same victim, and

=== PAGE 25 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
employ similar methods (deception, misrepresentation, manipulation of legal
processes) (FAC ¶¶ 49-54, 85, 101). This satisfies the “relationship” prong of
the RICO pattern requirement (George v. Urban Settlement Servs., 833 F.3d
1242, 1248 (10th Cir. 2016)).
4. The Law Does Not Require Multiple Victims or Schemes
The Court’s order relied on the fact that the scheme was directed at a single
victim and had a “single, narrow purpose.” However, the Tenth Circuit has
recognized that even a scheme targeting one victim can satisfy the
continuity requirement if it contemplates open-ended fraudulent activity and
does not have a single goal that, when achieved, will bring the activity to an
end (Torwest DBC, Inc. v. Dick, 810 F.2d 925, 928 (10th Cir. 1987); Edwards
v. First Nat. Bank, Bartlesville, Oklahoma, 872 F.2d 347, 351 (10th Cir.
1989)). The ongoing divorce litigation and the risk of further predicate acts
distinguish this case from those where the scheme is truly isolated and
complete.
5. The Totality of the Circumstances
Courts are to consider the totality of the circumstances, not just the timing
of the initial predicate acts, in assessing continuity (Fisher Sand & Gravel
Co. v. FNF Constr., Inc., No. 10-cv-0635 RB/SMV (D. N.M. Mar 27, 2013)).
Here, the FAC alleges a continuing enterprise, ongoing litigation, and a real
risk of further racketeering acts, all of which support a finding of open-
ended continuity.
Application to the Complaint and Order
The FAC alleges that the enterprise’s objective—fraudulent disposition
of property through the divorce—remains unfulfilled, and the risk of
further predicate acts is ongoing (FAC ¶¶ 49-54, 86(ii), 101-102).
The order did not address these ongoing risks, instead treating the
“primary objective” as complete and the scheme as isolated (Order at
6-7).
Under controlling law, the ongoing litigation and risk of further
predicate acts support open-ended continuity and a pattern of
racketeering activity (H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S.
229, 241-42 (1989); Resolution Trust Corp. v. Stone, 998 F.2d 1534,
1543 (10th Cir. 1993); Tal v. Hogan, 453 F.3d 1244, 1267 (10th Cir.
2006)).
Exceptions and Caveats
It is true that courts are cautious about finding RICO continuity in cases
involving a single scheme and a single victim, especially where the scheme
is short-lived and its objective is fully achieved (Condict v. Condict, 815 F.2d
579, 581 (10th Cir. 1987)). However, as the Tenth Circuit and Supreme
Court have clarified, if the scheme is ongoing or the risk of further predicate
acts is real, continuity may be established (H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel.

1534, 1543 (10th Cir. 1993)). The negative treatment of Condict in Maxwell
v. Wilson does not affect this federal RICO analysis.
Conclusion
With respect, the Court’s order granting dismissal did not address well-
pleaded allegations in the First Amended Complaint that the alleged
racketeering enterprise remains ongoing, with the risk of further predicate
acts as the divorce litigation continues and the final disposition of property
and rights remains unresolved. Under controlling RICO authority, these facts
plausibly support open-ended continuity and a pattern of racketeering
activity. Reconsideration should be granted so that Plaintiff’s claims may be
adjudicated on the merits, consistent with the standards set forth by the
Supreme Court and the Tenth Circuit.

Torwest DBC, Inc. v. Dick, 810 F.2d 925 (10th Cir. 1987)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
A more difficult question is presented when the RICO claim is based on one
scheme involving one victim, but the plan contemplates open-ended
fraudulent activity and does not have a single goal that, when achieved, will
bring the activity to an end. Some courts have found that such an ongoing
scheme is itself sufficient to satisfy the continuity element of a RICO pattern.
Summary
Continuity requirement for a RICO pattern, emphasizing that a scheme with
an open-ended fraudulent activity that does not have a single goal bringing
the activity to an end can satisfy the continuity element. This directly relates
to the ongoing divorce litigation in the current case, where the enterprise's
objective remains unfulfilled, and there is a threat of continued criminal
activity.

U.S. 1, 8 (2010).
Summary
Requirements for a RICO claim to survive a motion to dismiss, emphasizing
the need for a pattern of racketeering activity and proximate causation
between the predicate acts and the injury. This supports the proposition that
the enterprise can still be functional and pose a threat of ongoing criminal
activity, even if the primary objective appears complete. The ongoing
litigation and potential for further predicate acts, such as perjury, align with
the requirement for a pattern of racketeering activity.

RICO provides a private right of action in federal court for individuals
injured in their business or property through fraudulent conduct. A RICO
plaintiff must prove “(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern
(4) of racketeering activity.” Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479, 496,

including “any act which is indictable under ... section 1343 (relating to wire
fraud).” 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1)(B). It thus sweeps in a number of traditional
common law fraud claims if the requisite pattern and entity requirements
are met.
Summary
A RICO claim requires a pattern of racketeering activity, which includes
conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. The
passage emphasizes that the term "racketeering activity" includes acts
indictable under section 1343 (relating to wire fraud), which is relevant to
the ongoing threat of continued criminal activity in the RICO claim. The
ongoing litigation and Defendants’ conduct, as documented in the record,
support a finding of open-ended continuity and a pattern of racketeering
activity.

Fisher relies on open-ended continuity to prove the 'pattern' element of its
RICO claim. (Doc. 105 at 18). Open-ended continuity depends heavily on the
facts of the case. Resolution Trust Corp., 998 F.2d at 1543. For 12(b)(6)
purposes, open-ended continuity is established if the plaintiff can plausibly
allege 'that there was a threat of continuing criminal activity beyond the
period during which the predicate acts were performed.' Heinrich, 668 F.3d
at 410. The threat of continuing racketeering activity need not be
established exclusively by the predicate acts, and the court should consider
the totality of the circumstances surrounding the commission of the acts. Id.
(citation omitted); see also Tal, 453 F.3d at 1268 (citation omitted).
Summary
Open-ended continuity in a RICO claim can be established if there is a
plausible allegation of a threat of continuing criminal activity beyond the
period of the predicate acts. The court should consider the totality of the
circumstances, not just the predicate acts themselves. This supports the
argument that the ongoing divorce litigation and the potential for further
manipulation of legal proceedings by the Defendants could constitute a
threat of continued criminal activity, thus supporting a finding of open-ended
continuity.
Tal v. Hogan, 453 F.3d 1244 (10th Cir. 2006)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
Continuity of threat requires both proof of 'a series of related predicates
extending over a substantial period of time,' as well as a 'showing that the
predicates themselves involve a distinct threat of long-term racketeering
activity... or that the predicates are a regular way of conducting the
defendant's ongoing legitimate business or the RICO enterprise.'
Summary
The passage from "Tal v. Hogan" emphasizes the requirement for continuity
in a RICO claim, which involves demonstrating a threat of long-term
racketeering activity. The ongoing divorce litigation and the potential for
further predicate acts, such as perjury and wire fraud, indicate a threat of
continued criminal activity. The judge's order may have overlooked this
aspect, as the enterprise's objective of fraudulent disposition of property
through the divorce remains unfulfilled, and the litigation is still pending.

extending over a few weeks or months' are insufficient. Id. Open-ended
continuity requires a clear threat of future criminal conduct related to past

Summary
The court requires either closed-ended or open-ended continuity to establish
a pattern of racketeering activity. Open-ended continuity involves a threat of
future criminal conduct related to past conduct. The ongoing divorce
litigation and the potential for further predicate acts, such as perjury,
support the argument for open-ended continuity.

U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
RICO provides a private right of action in federal court for individuals
injured in their business or property through fraudulent conduct... To
establish a pattern of racketeering activity, the plaintiffs must allege at least
two predicate acts... But, 'while two acts are necessary, they may not be
sufficient' to establish a pattern... The plaintiffs allege that BOA and Urban
committed several acts of mail and wire fraud while conducting the affairs of
the BOA–Urban enterprise... To support the mail and wire fraud allegations,
the plaintiffs must plausibly allege 'the existence of a scheme or artifice to
defraud or obtain money or property by false pretenses, representations or
promises,' and that BOA and Urban communicated, or caused
communications to occur, through the U.S. mail or interstate wires to
execute that fraudulent scheme.
Summary
Requirements for establishing a RICO claim, emphasizing the need for a
pattern of racketeering activity, which includes related and continuous
predicate acts. The ongoing nature of the divorce litigation and the potential
for further predicate acts, such as perjury or wire fraud, support the
argument for open-ended continuity. The passage also highlights the
importance of alleging a scheme to defraud and the use of interstate
communications, which are present in the plaintiff's allegations.
Resolution Trust Corp. v. Stone, 998 F.2d 1534 (10th Cir. 1993)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
Open-ended continuity depends upon the facts of each case, and may be
established by showing that the predicates themselves involve a distinct
threat of long-term racketeering activity, either implicit or explicit, or that
the predicates are a regular way of conducting the defendant's ongoing
legitimate business or the RICO enterprise. ... We note that even if the
evidence were insufficient to establish close-ended continuity, there would
nevertheless be sufficient evidence to establish open-ended continuity. We
measure continuity as of the time suit is filed.
Summary
Open-ended continuity in a RICO claim can be established if there is a
distinct threat of long-term racketeering activity. The passage emphasizes

=== PAGE 31 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
that continuity should be measured as of the time the suit is filed, and
ongoing threats or activities can support a finding of open-ended continuity.
This is relevant to the plaintiff's argument that the enterprise's objective
remains unfulfilled, and the threat of further predicate acts is ongoing as the
divorce litigation continues.
Condict v. Condict, 826 F.2d 923 (10th Cir. 1987)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
A scheme to achieve a single discrete objective does not in and of itself
create a threat of ongoing activity, even when that goal is pursued by
multiple illegal acts, because the scheme ends when the purpose is
accomplished. Courts that have considered a RICO claim grounded on this
type of scheme have therefore required some additional evidence showing
that the scheme was not an isolated occurrence.
Summary
The passage from Condict v. Condict highlights that a single scheme with a
discrete objective does not automatically imply a threat of ongoing activity.
However, it also notes that additional evidence showing the scheme was not
isolated can support a RICO claim. In the present case, the ongoing divorce
litigation and the potential for further predicate acts, such as perjury,
suggest that the scheme is not isolated and poses a threat of continued
criminal activity. This aligns with the requirement for open-ended continuity
in a RICO claim.
Skurkey v. Daniel
U.S. District Court — Western District of Oklahoma
Extract
Plaintiff argues the Complaint alleges facts to support both open- and
closed-ended continuity... closed-ended continuity requires a series of
related racketeering acts over a 'substantial period of time.'... In evaluating
whether the Plaintiff has pled sufficient facts to support the extensiveness
prong the Court considers 'the number of victims, the number of
racketeering acts, the variety of racketeering acts, whether the injuries
were distinct, the complexity and size of the scheme, and the nature or
character of the enterprise.'... The same holds true if the Court considers
whether Plaintiff has alleged continuity under an open-ended theory because
Plaintiff has not alleged facts that show a clear threat of future criminal
conduct related to past criminal conduct.

Summary
Factors considered for closed-ended continuity, such as the number of
victims and the complexity of the scheme, and emphasizes the need for a
clear threat of future criminal conduct for open-ended continuity. The
judge's order may have overlooked the ongoing nature of the divorce
litigation and the potential for further predicate acts, which could support a
finding of open-ended continuity.
Condict v. Condict, 815 F.2d 579 (10th Cir. 1987)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
Courts generally agree that to make an adequate showing of continuity
under Sedima, a plaintiff must demonstrate some facts from which at least a
threat of ongoing illegal conduct may be inferred. A scheme to achieve a
single discrete objective does not in and of itself create a threat of ongoing
activity, even when that goal is pursued by multiple illegal acts, because the
scheme ends when the purpose is accomplished. Courts that have
considered a RICO claim grounded on this type of scheme have therefore
required some additional evidence showing that the scheme was not an
isolated occurrence.
Summary
The passage highlights the necessity of demonstrating a threat of ongoing
illegal conduct to establish continuity in a RICO claim. It clarifies that a
single scheme with a discrete objective does not automatically imply
ongoing activity unless additional evidence suggests the scheme is not
isolated. This is relevant to the plaintiff's argument that the enterprise's
objective remains unfulfilled, and the threat of further predicate acts is
ongoing.

Open-ended continuity in a RICO claim can be established by demonstrating
a distinct threat of long-term racketeering activity. This can be shown
through a clear threat of future criminal conduct related to past criminal
conduct. The ongoing divorce litigation and the potential for further
predicate acts, such as perjury and wire fraud, as the case proceeds,

In H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106
L.Ed.2d 195 (1989), the Supreme Court reiterated the well-established
concept that racketeering acts form a 'pattern' in RICO where they exhibit
'continuity plus relationship.' ... With respect to the 'continuity' requirement,
the Supreme Court stated that the predicate acts must amount to, or pose a
threat of, continuing racketeering activity. ... continuity 'is both a closed- and
open-ended concept, referring to a closed period of repeated conduct, or to
past conduct that by its nature projects into the future with a threat of
repetition.' ... Predicates extending over merely a few weeks or months, on
the other hand, may satisfy the continuity element if there is a threat of
repetition in the future. This latter concept of continuity, which occurs over
an 'open period,' is established by showing that the predicate acts are a
'regular way of conducting the enterprise's ongoing business.'
Summary
The continuity requirement for a RICO pattern can be satisfied by
demonstrating either a closed period of repeated conduct or a threat of
future repetition. The passage emphasizes that even if predicate acts occur
over a short period, they can still meet the continuity requirement if there is
a threat of ongoing criminal activity. This aligns with the Plaintiff's argument
that the ongoing divorce litigation and potential for further fraudulent acts
pose a threat of continued racketeering activity.

=== PAGE 34 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
Next, the Court turns to the continuity requirement. Under this prong, a
plaintiff must allege that the acts amounted to or threaten continued
racketeering activity.[] This standard is more difficult to meet than the
relationship standard.[] Either “open-ended” or “closed-ended” continuity
can satisfy the continuity prong. ... “[C]losed-ended continuity consists of a
closed period of repeated, related racketeering acts that do not necessarily
threaten future repetition.”[] However, “[w]ithout a threat of continued
illegal activity, a single scheme rarely supports finding continuity. And a
single scheme even less likely supports a continuity finding when the
scheme targets only one discrete goal.”[]
Summary
The continuity requirement for a RICO claim can be satisfied by either open-
ended or closed-ended continuity. Open-ended continuity involves acts that
threaten continued racketeering activity, while closed-ended continuity
involves a series of related acts over a substantial period. The passage
highlights that a single scheme targeting one discrete goal is less likely to
support a finding of continuity unless there is a threat of continued illegal
activity. This is relevant to the proposition because the ongoing divorce
litigation and the potential for further predicate acts (e.g., perjury, wire
fraud) suggest a threat of continued racketeering activity, supporting a
finding of open-ended continuity.

U.S. District Court — District of Colorado
Extract
A 'pattern' of racketeering activity under RICO 'requires at least two acts of
racketeering activity' within a ten-year period, 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5), but
'while two acts are necessary, they may not be sufficient.' Sedima, S.P.R.L. v.

must somehow be ordered or arranged, bearing some relationship to each
other, and implicate the threat of continuing activity. H.J. Inc. v.
Northwestern Bell Telephone Co., 492 U.S. 229, 238-239, 109 S.Ct. 2893,
2900-2901, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989). 'Continuity' is both a closed- and
openended concept, referring either to a closed period of repeated conduct,
or to past conduct that by its nature projects into the future with the threat
of repetition.
Summary
A pattern of racketeering activity under RICO requires not only related acts
but also a threat of continued criminal activity. The concept of "continuity"

=== PAGE 35 ===

can be open-ended, meaning that past conduct that projects into the future
with the threat of repetition can satisfy the requirement. This supports the
argument that the ongoing divorce litigation and the potential for further
perjury and manipulation of legal proceedings could constitute a threat of
continued criminal activity, thus supporting a pattern of racketeering
activity.
Phelps v. Wichita Eagle-Beacon, 886 F.2d 1262 (10th Cir. 1989)

The Supreme Court has recently held that a RICO violation does not require
more than one scheme. H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co., --- U.S.
----, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989). The Court there reiterated its
prior holding that all that is required to constitute a pattern are two
elements--'continuity plus relationship.' Sedima, 473 U.S. at 496 n. 14, 105
S.Ct. at 3285 n. 14. There is no question that the acts complained of in this
case are related because they are all part of an alleged common scheme.
See Torwest DBC, Inc. v. Dick, 810 F.2d 925, 928 (10th Cir.1987). The
central question is whether they are 'continuous.' To establish continuity, the
plaintiff must demonstrate either 'a closed period of repeated conduct' or
'past conduct that by its nature projects into the future with a threat of
repetition.' H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co., 109 S.Ct. at 2902.
These two forms of continuity are respectively referred to as closed-ended
and open-ended continuity. Id. The Supreme Court held that closed-ended
continuity requires 'a series of related predicates extending over a
substantial period of time. Predicate acts extending over a few weeks or
months' are insufficient. Id. Open-ended continuity requires a clear threat of
future criminal conduct related to past criminal conduct. Id.
Summary
A RICO violation does not require more than one scheme and emphasizes
the need for "continuity plus relationship" to establish a pattern of
racketeering activity. It distinguishes between closed-ended and open-ended
continuity, with the latter requiring a threat of future criminal conduct. This
supports the proposition that the enterprise can still be functional and pose
a threat of ongoing criminal activity, even if the primary objective appears
complete.

Open-ended continuity 'may be established by showing that the predicates

ended continuity requires a clear threat of future criminal conduct.
Summary
The passage explains that open-ended continuity in a RICO claim can be
established by demonstrating a distinct threat of long-term racketeering
activity. This is relevant to the proposition because the ongoing divorce
litigation and the potential for further predicate acts, such as perjury or wire
fraud, indicate a threat of continued criminal activity. The judge's order may
have overlooked this aspect by focusing on the completion of the primary

Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy
The Brief - American Bar Association - 2024-01-01
Extract
RICO’s broad definition of racketeering activity and the act’s reference to
mail and wire fraud as predicate offenses begs the question: Why not RICO?
That is, should the plaintiff consider adding a RICO count to an existing
state cause of action? Moreover, since an action under RICO arises under
federal law, a plaintiff can elect to have access to federal court. Civil RICO is
so broad and offers such a potentially broad pathway to pleading of such a
claim in light of the inclusion of mail and wire fraud as predicate acts that a
plaintiff can take almost any given set of facts and fashion their pleadings
and be... the award of treble damages for civil RICO violations. It provides
that the plaintiff “shall recover threefold the damages he sustains” in
addition to costs and attorney fees.
Summary
RICO's broad definition allows for the inclusion of various predicate acts,
such as mail and wire fraud, which are relevant in the ongoing divorce
litigation. The passage suggests that RICO can be applied broadly, and the
ongoing nature of the litigation supports the argument for open-ended
continuity in the pattern of racketeering activity.

Extract
Most significantly for the pattern element of RICO, each violation of the mail
or wire fraud statutes is treated as a separate offense, even where multiple
violations occur in the execution of a single scheme... Several courts have

seized on the closing dictum in Inryco, announcing that a RICO pattern
requires more than a single fraudulent scheme. Most significantly, the
Eighth Circuit Court adopted this approach, reversing a jury verdict in
Superior Oil Co. v. Fulmer. The Circuit Court found 'one isolated fraudulent
scheme' to divert natural gas from plaintiff's pipeline but insufficient
evidence to show any threat of continuing activity, stating that '[t]here was
no proof that defendants had ever done these activities in the past and there
was no proof that they were engaged in other criminal activities
elsewhere.'... Where this Court differs with Inryco is in the implication that a
single fraudulent effort or episode should be equated with a single
fraudulent scheme... . [Continuity] requires more than a single transaction
but not necessarily more than a single scheme... .[A]n open-ended scheme
may include a sufficient number of criminal episodes to satisfy the
'continuity' factor of Sedima.
Summary
The pattern requirement in RICO cases does not necessarily require
multiple schemes but can be satisfied by a single scheme with multiple
criminal episodes. The passage highlights that continuity can be established
even in a single scheme if there is a threat of ongoing criminal activity. This
supports the argument that the enterprise in the case at hand may still be
functional and pose a threat of continued criminal activity, as the divorce
proceedings are ongoing and there is a risk of further fraudulent acts.

Extract
The Supreme Court made a second attempt to clarify the 'pattern' concept in
H.J., Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co. In that case, the Court held
that when proving a 'pattern of racketeering activity,' RICO requires both
relationship and continuity of predicate acts as separate elements. However,
the Court recognized that proof of these factors will often overlap. The
relationship prong is defined by the connection of the defendant's criminal
acts to one another: 'continuity' is successfully proved if a prosecutor can
show actual continuity during a past, closed period of repeated conduct or
an open-ended threat of continued racketeering activity in the future.
Summary
The Supreme Court in H.J., Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co. clarified
that a pattern of racketeering activity requires both relationship and
continuity. Continuity can be shown through an open-ended threat of
continued racketeering activity in the future. This supports the argument
that the ongoing divorce litigation and the potential for further predicate

acts (e.g., perjury, wire fraud) demonstrate an open-ended threat of
continued criminal activity, which the judge may have overlooked.
RICO: A Primer
Extract
A plaintiff may demonstrate a pattern by establishment that the predicate
acts pose a threat of continued criminal activity, which is generally
demonstrated by showing either: * Closed-ended continuity. Proving 'a series
of related predicate acts extending over a substantial period of time.' *
Open-ended continuity. A threat of 'continuing criminal activity extending
indefinitely into the future,' in light of the nature of the enterprise and
predicate acts alleged.
Summary
A pattern of racketeering activity can be established by demonstrating
either closed-ended or open-ended continuity. Open-ended continuity
involves showing a threat of continuing criminal activity extending
indefinitely into the future. In this case, the ongoing divorce litigation and
the potential for further predicate acts, such as perjury or wire fraud,
support the argument for open-ended continuity. The judge's order may have
overlooked this aspect, as the enterprise's objective of fraudulent disposition
of property through the divorce remains unfulfilled, and the risk of further
criminal activity persists.

A pattern of racketeering activity can be established through either closed-
ended or open-ended continuity. Open-ended continuity involves
demonstrating a threat of continuing criminal activity extending indefinitely
into the future. The ongoing divorce litigation and the potential for further
predicate acts, such as perjury and wire fraud, support the argument for
open-ended continuity in this case.
