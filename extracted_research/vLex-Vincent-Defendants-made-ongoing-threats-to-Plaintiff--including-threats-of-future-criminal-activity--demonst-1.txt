Question
Defendants made ongoing threats to Plaintiff, including threats of future
criminal activity, demonstrating the continuity of the enterprise's unlawful
conduct. The false statements in legal documents, including the divorce
petition and protective order, were made with the intent to deceive the court
and gain an unfair advantage in legal proceedings. RICO claims can be
based on both closed-ended continuity (a series of related predicate acts
over a substantial period) and open-ended continuity (a threat of ongoing
criminal activity) (H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co., 492 U.S. 229
(1989)). The defendants' actions demonstrate both closed-ended continuity
(predicate acts over a substantial period) and open-ended continuity (threats
of future criminal activity), further supporting the RICO claim.
Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
The defendants' ongoing threats to the plaintiff, coupled with false
statements in legal documents, likely establish both closed-ended and open-
ended continuity necessary for a RICO claim under H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern
Bell Telephone Co. These actions, demonstrating a pattern of racketeering
activity over time and posing threats of future criminal activity, fulfill RICO's
continuity requirement as interpreted by federal courts.
Summary
For a successful RICO claim, a plaintiff must demonstrate a "pattern of
racketeering activity" involving at least two predicate acts that show both
relationship and continuity. The Supreme Court in H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern
Bell Telephone Co. established that continuity can be proven in two ways:
closed-ended continuity (related predicate acts extending over a substantial
period) or open-ended continuity (past conduct that projects a threat of
future criminal activity). The ongoing threats made by defendants to the
plaintiff, combined with false statements in legal documents like divorce
petitions and protective orders, can establish both forms of continuity.
The defendants' actions appear to satisfy closed-ended continuity through
related predicate acts occurring over a substantial time period, with courts
generally considering periods of at least one year sufficient. The actions also
demonstrate open-ended continuity through threats of future criminal
activity, which courts recognize as a valid basis for establishing an ongoing
pattern. By meeting both forms of continuity, along with showing related
predicate acts that constitute racketeering activity under 18 U.S.C. § 1962,
the plaintiff has strong grounds to support their RICO claim.

Background and Relevant Law
The RICO Statutory Framework
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) prohibits
certain activities connected to enterprises engaged in interstate or foreign
commerce. Under 18 U.S.C. § 1962, "It shall be unlawful for any person
through a pattern of racketeering activity or through collection of an
unlawful debt to acquire or maintain, directly or indirectly, any interest in or
control of any enterprise which is engaged in, or the activities of which
affect, interstate or foreign commerce" (18 U.S.C. § 1962). This provision
establishes the basic elements of a civil RICO claim, which includes proving
a "pattern of racketeering activity."
To establish a "pattern of racketeering activity," RICO requires "at least two
acts of racketeering activity committed in a 10 year period" (Sunwealth
Glob. HK Ltd. v. Pinder Int'l, Inc., 20 Civ. 1436 (ER) (S.D.N.Y. Mar 23, 2021)).
However, the mere existence of two predicate acts is insufficient; the
plaintiff must also demonstrate that these acts are related and continuous.
The Continuity Requirement: H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell
Telephone Co.
The landmark case establishing the continuity requirement for RICO claims
is H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co., 492 U.S. 229 (1989). In this
seminal decision, the Supreme Court established that "to prove a pattern of
racketeering activity a plaintiff ... must show that the racketeering
predicates are related, and that they amount to or pose a threat of continued
criminal activity" (H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co., 492 U.S. 229,
109 S.Ct. 2893, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989)).
The Court specifically noted: "Continuity is centrally a temporal concept,
and may be either closed- or open-ended. A party alleging a RICO violation
may demonstrate continuity over a closed period by proving a series of
related predicates extending over a substantial period of time. Otherwise, it
must be shown that the predicates establish a threat of long-term
racketeering activity... In other cases, the threat of continuity may be
established by showing that the predicate acts or offenses are part of an
ongoing entity's regular way of doing business" (H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern
Bell Telephone Co., 492 U.S. 229, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989)).
Closed-Ended Continuity
Closed-ended continuity refers to "a closed period of repeated
conduct" (McLaughlin v. Anderson, 962 F.2d 187 (2nd Cir. 1992)). It is
established by demonstrating "a series of related predicates extending over
a substantial period of time" (Curtis v. Greenberg, 20-CV-824 (PKC) (LB)
(E.D. N.Y. Sep 23, 2021)). Courts have generally found that predicate acts
occurring over at least one year satisfy the closed-ended continuity
requirement: "Closed-end continuity 'can be shown by related acts
continuing over a period of time lasting at least one year'" (Clancy v.

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Vacationaire Estates, Inc., Civil No. 18-2249 (JRT/LIB) (D. Minn. Feb 27,
2019)).
The Second Circuit has noted that "Although we have not viewed two years
as a bright-line requirement, it will be rare that conduct persisting for a
shorter period of time establishes closed-ended continuity" (Racketeer
influenced and corrupt organizations, 2015-09-22). However, this is not a
universal standard across all circuits, and the duration requirement may
vary by jurisdiction.
Open-Ended Continuity
Open-ended continuity refers to "past conduct that by its nature projects
into the future with a threat of repetition" (Craig Outdoor Advertising v.
Viacom Outdoor, Inc., 528 F.3d 1001 (8th Cir. 2008)). It is established by
showing "a threat of continuing criminal activity beyond the period during
which the predicate acts were performed" (Sunwealth Glob. HK Ltd. v.
Pinder Int'l, Inc., 20 Civ. 1436 (ER) (S.D.N.Y. Mar 23, 2021)).
Open-ended continuity can be demonstrated in several ways: "(1) a 'specific
threat of repetition,' (2) that the 'predicate acts or offenses are part of an
ongoing entity's regular way of doing business,' or (3) that the defendant
operates a 'long-term association that exists for criminal
purposes'" (Midwest Grinding Co., Inc. v. Spitz, 976 F.2d 1016 (7th Cir.
1992)).
Unlike closed-ended continuity, open-ended continuity does not require a
substantial period of past conduct: "Although a RICO plaintiff must show
duration to allege closed-ended continuity, open-ended continuity may
satisfy the continuity prong of the pattern requirement regardless of its
brevity" (Pelfresne v. Stephens, 35 F.Supp.2d 1064 (N.D. Ill. 1999)).
The "Continuity Plus Relationship" Test
Courts have developed what is known as the "continuity plus relationship"
test to determine whether a pattern of racketeering activity exists. This test
requires showing both that the predicate acts are related and that they
demonstrate continuity, either closed-ended or open-ended.
As stated by the Seventh Circuit: "To that end, a civil RICO plaintiff may no
longer get by merely alleging two predicate acts, but must also satisfy the
so-called 'continuity plus relationship' test: the predicate acts must be
related to one another (the relationship prong) and pose a threat of
continued criminal activity (the continuity prong)" (Midwest Grinding Co.,
Inc. v. Spitz, 976 F.2d 1016 (7th Cir. 1992)).
The "relationship" prong is satisfied when the predicate acts "have the same
or similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of commission,
or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not
isolated events" (Schlaifer Nance & Co. v. Estate of Warhol, 119 F.3d 91 (2nd
Cir. 1997)).

Analysis of the Defendants' Actions
Assessing Closed-Ended Continuity
The defendants' actions, including making false statements in legal
documents such as divorce petitions and protective orders, may establish
closed-ended continuity if these acts occurred over a substantial period of
time. While the exact timeframe is not specified in the scenario, courts
generally require that the predicate acts extend over a period of at least one
year to demonstrate closed-ended continuity.
As noted in Curtis v. Greenberg, 20-CV-824 (PKC) (LB) (E.D. N.Y. Sep 23,
2021), "closed-ended continuity is primarily a temporal concept, and it
requires that the predicate crimes extend over a substantial period of time."
The Eighth Circuit has held that "closed-end continuity 'can be shown by
related acts continuing over a period of time lasting at least one
year'" (Clancy v. Vacationaire Estates, Inc., Civil No. 18-2249 (JRT/LIB) (D.
Minn. Feb 27, 2019)).
If the defendants' false statements in legal documents and threats to the
plaintiff occurred over a period exceeding one year, this would likely satisfy
the closed-ended continuity requirement. As noted in In re Juul Labs, Inc.,
Mktg., Sales Practices, & Prods. Liab. Litig., 497 F.Supp.3d 552 (N.D. Cal.
2020), "by identifying predicate wire and mail fraud acts over a course of
five years, they have alleged 'closed-ended' continuity." Similarly, if the
defendants' acts span a comparable timeframe, closed-ended continuity
could be established.
It's also important to note that the predicate acts must be related, not
isolated events. As stated in Turner v. Cook, 362 F.3d 1219 (9th Cir. 2004),
"proof of a single scheme can be sufficient so long as the predicate acts
involved are not isolated or sporadic." The defendants' false statements in
legal documents and threats to the plaintiff appear to be related acts with
the common purpose of deceiving the court and gaining an unfair advantage
in legal proceedings, which would satisfy the relationship requirement.
Assessing Open-Ended Continuity
The defendants' ongoing threats to the plaintiff, including threats of future
criminal activity, likely establish open-ended continuity. As explained in 
Heinrich v. Waiting Angels Adoption Servs., Inc., 668 F.3d 393 (6th Cir.
2012), "The plaintiffs can, however, establish open-ended continuity. 'Often a
RICO action will be brought before continuity can be established [by
showing predicate acts spanning a substantial period of time]. In such cases,
liability depends on whether the threat of continuity is demonstrated.'"
The threats of future criminal activity specifically demonstrate a "threat of
repetition" that courts have recognized as sufficient for open-ended
continuity. As noted in Curtis v. Greenberg, 20-CV-824 (PKC) (LB) (E.D. N.Y.
Sep 23, 2021), "criminal activity 'that by its nature projects into the future
with a threat of repetition' possesses open-ended continuity, and that can be

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
established in several ways." The court further explained that "Some crimes
may by their very nature include a future threat, such as in a protection
racket."
The defendants' threats of future criminal activity directly parallel this
example, suggesting that their conduct "by its nature projects into the
future with a threat of repetition." This is precisely what the Supreme Court
identified as establishing open-ended continuity in H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern
Bell Telephone Co., 492 U.S. 229, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989).
Furthermore, the intent to deceive the court through false statements in
legal documents suggests an ongoing pattern of fraudulent activity that
could extend into the future. As stated in Nightingale Grp., LLC v. CW
Capital Mgmt., LLC, 11 Civ. 9293 (PAE) (S.D. N.Y. Jul 05, 2012), "A claim of
open-ended continuity is shown by demonstrating past unlawful conduct
coupled with a threat of future criminal conduct." The defendants' use of
false statements in legal proceedings, combined with ongoing threats,
establishes this requisite pattern.
The "Enterprise's Unlawful Conduct"
The scenario mentions "the continuity of the enterprise's unlawful conduct,"
which suggests that the defendants' actions were conducted through an
"enterprise" as required by RICO. Under 18 U.S.C. § 1962, it is unlawful for
any person to conduct an enterprise's affairs through a pattern of
racketeering activity.
The false statements in legal documents and threats to the plaintiff appear
to be part of a coordinated effort by the defendants, potentially constituting
an enterprise's activities. As noted in US Airline Pilots Ass'n v. Awappa, LLC,
615 F.3d 312 (4th Cir. 2010), to state a RICO claim, a plaintiff must allege
that the defendants engaged in a "pattern of racketeering activity," which
includes acts like extortion, defined as "the obtaining of property from
another, with his consent, induced by wrongful use of actual or threatened
force, violence, or fear."
The defendants' threats to the plaintiff could potentially constitute extortion
if they were made to obtain property or advantage through fear or
intimidation. The false statements in legal documents, particularly if they
involve mail or wire communications, could constitute mail or wire fraud,
which are recognized predicate acts under RICO.
Combining Closed-Ended and Open-Ended
Continuity
The defendants' actions appear to demonstrate both closed-ended and open-
ended continuity, which strengthens the RICO claim. As noted in RICO: A
Primer, 2022-01-31, "A plaintiff may demonstrate a pattern by establishment
that the predicate acts pose a threat of continued criminal activity, which is
generally demonstrated by showing either: * Closed-ended continuity.
Proving 'a series of related predicate acts extending over a substantial

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
period of time.' * Open-ended continuity. A threat of 'continuing criminal
activity extending indefinitely into the future,' in light of the nature of the
enterprise and predicate acts alleged."
While either form of continuity alone could be sufficient to establish a
pattern of racketeering activity, demonstrating both provides stronger
support for the RICO claim. As stated in In re Juul Labs, Inc., Mktg., Sales
Practices, & Prods. Liab. Litig., 497 F.Supp.3d 552 (N.D. Cal. 2020), "by
identifying predicate wire and mail fraud acts over a course of five years,
they have alleged 'closed-ended' continuity; and (ii) by alleging that some of
the misrepresentations continue to this day, they have likewise alleged
'open-ended' continuity."
Similarly, the defendants' false statements in legal documents over time
establish closed-ended continuity, while their ongoing threats of future
criminal activity establish open-ended continuity. Together, these
demonstrate a pattern of racketeering activity that supports a RICO claim.
Temporal Considerations and Court
Interpretations
Duration Requirements for Closed-Ended Continuity
Courts have provided varying guidance on what constitutes a "substantial
period of time" for closed-ended continuity. The Second Circuit has
suggested that conduct lasting less than two years rarely establishes closed-
ended continuity: "Although we have not viewed two years as a bright-line
requirement, it will be rare that conduct persisting for a shorter period of
time establishes closed-ended continuity" (Racketeer influenced and corrupt
organizations, 2015-09-22).
However, other circuits have found shorter periods sufficient. The Eighth
Circuit has held that "closed-end continuity 'can be shown by related acts
continuing over a period of time lasting at least one year'" (Clancy v.
Vacationaire Estates, Inc., Civil No. 18-2249 (JRT/LIB) (D. Minn. Feb 27,
2019)).
The Third Circuit, in Tabas v. Tabas, 47 F.3d 1280 (3rd Cir. 1995), held that
"defendant's allegedly fraudulent distribution of estate over three and one
half years was 'substantial' and satisfied closed-ended continuity
requirement of RICO." It is important to note, however, that Tabas was
"Declined To Extend by Yucaipa Am. All. Fund I, LP v. Ehrlich, No. 16-3664
(3rd Cir. Nov 15, 2017)," which suggests that the Third Circuit may have
narrowed its interpretation of what satisfies closed-ended continuity since
the Tabas decision. This subsequent treatment indicates that courts may be
becoming more stringent in their requirements for establishing closed-
ended continuity.

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
No Requirement for Multiple Schemes
It's worth emphasizing that multiple schemes are not necessary to establish
a pattern of racketeering activity. As stated in Turner v. Cook, 362 F.3d 1219
(9th Cir. 2004), "Evidence of multiple schemes is not required to show a
threat of continued criminal activity, id. at 240, 109 S.Ct. 2893, and, indeed,
proof of a single scheme can be sufficient so long as the predicate acts
involved are not isolated or sporadic." This means that even if the
defendants' actions all relate to a single scheme, such as gaining advantage
in legal proceedings, this can still satisfy the continuity requirement if the
predicate acts are not isolated or sporadic.
Totality of Circumstances Approach
In assessing continuity, courts consider the totality of circumstances
surrounding the predicate acts, not just the acts themselves. As noted in 
Heinrich v. Waiting Angels Adoption Servs., Inc., 668 F.3d 393 (6th Cir.
2012), "The threat of continuing racketeering activity need not be
established, however, exclusively by reference to the predicate acts alone;
rather, a court should consider the totality of the circumstances surrounding
the commission of those acts."
This approach allows courts to consider factors such as the nature of the
enterprise, the relationship between the defendants, the purpose of the
predicate acts, and the potential for future criminal activity. In the current
scenario, the court would likely consider not only the specific false
statements and threats made by the defendants but also the broader context
in which these actions occurred, including the intent to deceive the court
and gain an unfair advantage in legal proceedings.
Application to the Defendants' Actions
Based on the legal principles established in the cited cases, the defendants'
actions likely establish both closed-ended and open-ended continuity.
Analysis of Closed-Ended Continuity
The false statements in legal documents, including the divorce petition and
protective order, if made over a substantial period (ideally over a year),
would likely satisfy the closed-ended continuity requirement. These
statements appear to be related predicate acts with the common purpose of
deceiving the court and gaining an unfair advantage in legal proceedings.
As stated in Ellis v. Warner, CASE NO. 15-10134-CIV-GOODMAN (S.D. Fla.
Feb 16, 2017), closed-ended continuity exists "where the racketeering
occurred over a substantial period of time." If the defendants' false
statements were made in multiple legal documents over time, this would
strengthen the case for closed-ended continuity.

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Analysis of Open-Ended Continuity
The defendants' ongoing threats to the plaintiff, including threats of future
criminal activity, strongly support a finding of open-ended continuity. These
threats demonstrate a "specific threat of repetition," which is one way to
establish open-ended continuity according to Midwest Grinding Co., Inc. v.
Spitz, 976 F.2d 1016 (7th Cir. 1992).
The nature of threats of future criminal activity inherently projects into the
future, which is exactly what the Supreme Court required for open-ended
continuity in H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co., 492 U.S. 229, 109
S.Ct. 2893, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989).
Combined Analysis
The combination of false statements in legal documents over time and
ongoing threats of future criminal activity provides strong support for a
RICO claim based on both closed-ended and open-ended continuity. As
stated in Cofacredit v. Windsor Plumbing Supply, 187 F.3d 229 (2nd Cir.
1997), "In assessing whether or not the plaintiff has shown open-ended
continuity, the nature of the RICO enterprise and of the predicate acts are
relevant."
The nature of the defendants' actions, particularly the intent to deceive the
court and the threats of future criminal activity, strongly suggests an
ongoing pattern of racketeering activity that satisfies both closed-ended and
open-ended continuity requirements.
Conclusion
The defendants' ongoing threats to the plaintiff, including threats of future
criminal activity, combined with false statements in legal documents, likely
establish both closed-ended and open-ended continuity as required for a
RICO claim under H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co., 492 U.S. 229,
109 S.Ct. 2893, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989).
For closed-ended continuity, the false statements in legal documents, if
occurring over a substantial period (ideally a year or more), would satisfy
the requirement for "a series of related predicates extending over a
substantial period of time." For open-ended continuity, the ongoing threats
of future criminal activity clearly demonstrate that the defendants' conduct
"by its nature projects into the future with a threat of repetition."
The combination of these two forms of continuity provides robust support
for a RICO claim. As courts have consistently held, either closed-ended or
open-ended continuity alone can satisfy the continuity requirement for a
pattern of racketeering activity, but demonstrating both strengthens the
RICO claim.
It is important to note that the ultimate determination would depend on
specific factual details not provided in the scenario, such as the exact

=== PAGE 9 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
timeframe of the defendants' actions, the nature and frequency of the
threats, and the specific content of the false statements in legal documents.
However, based on the legal principles established in the cited cases, the
defendants' actions as described would likely support a RICO claim based on
both closed-ended and open-ended continuity.
Legal Authorities
Heinrich v. Waiting Angels Adoption Servs., Inc., 668 F.3d 393 (6th Cir.
2012)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Sixth Circuit
Extract
The continuity prong of the test can be satisfied by showing either a 'close-
ended' pattern (a series of related predicate acts extending over a
substantial period of time) or an 'open-ended' pattern (a set of predicate acts
that poses a threat of continuing criminal conduct extending beyond the
period in which the predicate acts were performed). ... The plaintiffs can,
however, establish open-ended continuity. 'Often a RICO action will be
brought before continuity can be established [by showing predicate acts
spanning a substantial period of time]. In such cases, liability depends on
whether the threat of continuity is demonstrated.' H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 242,
109 S.Ct. 2893. ... The threat of continuing racketeering activity need not be
established, however, exclusively by reference to the predicate acts alone;
rather, a court should consider the totality of the circumstances surrounding
the commission of those acts.
Summary
The court recognizes both closed-ended and open-ended continuity as valid
means to establish a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO. The
passage explains that open-ended continuity can be demonstrated by
showing a threat of ongoing criminal activity, which aligns with the
proposition that defendants' threats of future criminal activity support a
RICO claim. The court also emphasizes considering the totality of
circumstances, which supports the argument that false statements in legal
documents with intent to deceive can be part of the pattern of racketeering
activity.

Summary
The court recognizes both closed-ended and open-ended continuity as valid
bases for establishing a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO. The
passage specifically mentions that a pattern can be shown through related
acts that either occur over a substantial period (closed-ended) or pose a

U.S. District Court — Northern District of Illinois
Extract
Sansone argues that even if the tax protest amounts to mail fraud, plaintiffs
do not allege a pattern of racketeering activity. To allege a pattern, the two
predicate acts must be related and continuous. Sansone does not dispute
that the various mailings associated with the tax protest are related.
Sansone argues, however, that the mailings do not satisfy the duration
requirement of the continuity prong because the acts occurred too close
together in time. See Vicom, Inc. v. Harbridge Merchant Services, Inc., 20 F.
3d 771, 779-80 (7th Cir.1994). Courts have held that there are two types of
continuity: closed and open. 'Open-ended continuity is present when ... `a
specific threat of repetition' exists' by the very nature and scope of the
scheme. Id. at 782 (citing H.J., Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co., 492
U.S. 229, 242-43, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989)). 'Although a RICO
plaintiff must show duration to allege closed-ended continuity, open-ended
continuity may satisfy the continuity prong of the pattern requirement
regardless of its brevity.' Id. (citing H.J., 492 U.S. at 241-42, 109 S.Ct. 2893);
see also Midwest Grinding Co., Inc. v. Spitz, 976 F.2d 1016, 1023 (7th Cir.
1992) ('An openended period of racketeering ... is a course of criminal
activity which lacks the duration and repetition to establish continuity.'). A
plaintiff can show open-ended continuity by alleging that a scheme has no
'natural ending point,' because such an allegation suggests that the conduct
threatens to continue into the future. See Vicom, 20 F.3d at 783.

Summary
The passage discusses the requirements for establishing a pattern of
racketeering activity under RICO, specifically focusing on the concepts of
closed-ended and open-ended continuity. It explains that open-ended
continuity can be established by showing a threat of ongoing criminal
activity, which aligns with the proposition that defendants' actions
demonstrate both closed-ended and open-ended continuity.

Extract
A 'pattern of racketeering activity' includes 'at least two acts of racketeering
activity,... the last of which occurred within ten years... after the commission
of a prior act of racketeering activity.' 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5). These predicate
acts, the Supreme Court has held, must be related and either amount to, or
pose a threat of, continued criminal activity. H.J. Inc. v. Nw. Bell Tel. Co., 492
U.S. 229, 239 (1989). Therefore, to plead a pattern under RICO, a plaintiff
'must allege either an open-ended pattern of racketeering activity (i.e., past
criminal conduct coupled with a threat of future criminal conduct) or a
closed-ended pattern of racketeering activity (i.e., past criminal conduct
extending over a substantial period of time).' ... A claim of open-ended
continuity is shown by demonstrating past unlawful conduct coupled with a
threat of future criminal conduct. GICC Capital Corp., 67 F.3d at 466. 'In
assessing whether or not the plaintiff has shown open-ended continuity, the
nature of the RICO enterprise and of the predicate acts are relevant.'

Summary
Requirements for establishing a "pattern of racketeering activity" under
RICO, referencing the Supreme Court's decision in H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern
Bell Telephone Co. It explains that a pattern can be established through
either closed-ended continuity (a series of related predicate acts over a
substantial period) or open-ended continuity (a threat of ongoing criminal
activity). This directly supports the proposition that defendants' actions can
demonstrate both types of continuity, thereby supporting a RICO claim.

Extract
Continuity is centrally a temporal concept, and may be either closed- or
open-ended. A party alleging a RICO violation may demonstrate continuity
over a closed period by proving a series of related predicates extending over
a substantial period of time. Otherwise, it must be shown that the predicates
establish a threat of long-term racketeering activity... In other cases, the
threat of continuity may be established by showing that the predicate acts or
offenses are part of an ongoing entity's regular way of doing business.
Summary
The U.S. Supreme Court has clarified that continuity in RICO cases can be
demonstrated through either closed-ended or open-ended continuity. Closed-
ended continuity involves a series of related predicate acts over a
substantial period, while open-ended continuity involves a threat of ongoing
criminal activity. This directly supports the proposition that defendants'
actions, involving ongoing threats and false statements, can demonstrate
both types of continuity, thus supporting a RICO claim.
Ellis v. Warner, CASE NO. 15-10134-CIV-GOODMAN (S.D. Fla. Feb 16, 2017)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of Florida
Extract
To establish a pattern of racketeering activity, 'a plaintiff... must show that
the racketeering predicates are related, and that they amount to or pose a
threat of continued criminal activity.' H.J. Inc. v. Nw. Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S.
229, 239, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989). The pattern requirement
has been reduced to a 'continuity plus relationship' test. See id. Under this
'continuity' requirement, courts require allegations of either open-ended
continuity, in which there is an ongoing threat of racketeering activity
beyond the predicate act, or closed-ended continuity, where the racketeering
occurred over a substantial period of time.
Summary
The court requires a demonstration of either open-ended or closed-ended
continuity to establish a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO. The
passage directly references the Supreme Court's decision in H.J. Inc., which
is authoritative on the issue of continuity in RICO cases. The passage
explains the "continuity plus relationship" test, which is essential for
supporting the proposition that the defendants' actions demonstrate both
closed-ended and open-ended continuity.

To satisfy the “pattern” requirement, the predicate acts must “pose a threat
of continuous criminal activity” and “be related to each other.” Reich, 858 F.
3d at 59 (citing H.J. Inc. v. Nw. Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 239 (1989)). The
“continuity can be closed-ended or open-ended.” Id. at 60 (citing H.J., 492
U.S. at 239). “Criminal activity that occurred over a long period of time in
the past has closed-ended continuity, regardless of whether it may extend
into the future.” Id. (citing H.J., 492 U.S. at 242). “As such, closed-ended
continuity is primarily a temporal concept, and it requires that the predicate
crimes extend over a substantial period of time.” Id. (citations and
quotations omitted). ... “On the other hand, criminal activity ‘that by its
nature projects into the future with a threat of repetition' possesses open-
ended continuity, and that can be established in several ways.” Id. (quoting
H.J., 492 U.S. at 241). “Some crimes may by their very nature include a
future threat, such as in a protection racket.” Id. (citing H.J., 492 U.S. at
242). “When the business of an enterprise is primarily unlawful, the
continuity of the enterprise itself projects criminal activity into the future.”
Id. (citation omitted).
Summary
Requirements for establishing a "pattern" of racketeering activity under
RICO, specifically focusing on the concepts of closed-ended and open-ended
continuity as defined by the Supreme Court in H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell
Telephone Co. The passage explains that closed-ended continuity involves
criminal activity over a substantial period, while open-ended continuity
involves a threat of future criminal activity. This directly supports the
proposition that defendants' actions can demonstrate both types of
continuity, which is essential for a RICO claim.

F.Supp.3d 552 (N.D. Cal. 2020)
U.S. District Court — Northern District of California
Extract
A 'pattern of racketeering activity' requires the commission of at least two
predicate acts within a ten-year period. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5). 'Evidence of
multiple schemes is not required ... and, indeed, proof of a single scheme
can be sufficient so long as the predicate acts involved are not isolated or
sporadic.' Turner v. Cook, 362 F.3d 1219, 1229 (9th Cir. 2004) (citing H.J.
Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106 L.Ed.2d
195 (1989) ). ... A RICO pattern consisting of different acts by the Enterprise
is shown where the acts are 'related' and extend over a 'substantial' period
of time. Howard v. Am. Online Inc., 208 F.3d 741, 750 (9th Cir. 2000). ...
Plaintiffs contend that: (i) by identifying predicate wire and mail fraud acts

=== PAGE 14 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
over a course of five years, they have alleged 'closed-ended' continuity; and
(ii) by alleging that some of the misrepresentations continue to this day, they
have likewise alleged 'open-ended' continuity. See Allwaste, Inc. v. Hecht, 65
F.3d 1523, 1526-27 (9th Cir. 1995).
Summary
Multiple schemes are not necessary, and a single scheme can suffice if the
acts are not isolated or sporadic. It also explains the concepts of closed-
ended and open-ended continuity, which are directly relevant to the
proposition. The passage supports the idea that ongoing threats and false
statements in legal documents can demonstrate both types of continuity,
thus supporting a RICO claim.
US Airline Pilots Ass'n v. Awappa, LLC, 615 F.3d 312 (4th Cir. 2010)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fourth Circuit
Extract
To state a civil RICO claim, a plaintiff must allege that the defendants
engaged in, or conspired to engage in, a 'pattern of racketeering activity.' 18
U.S.C. § 1962 (emphasis added). 'Racketeering activity' includes 'extortion,'
defined as 'the obtaining of property from another, with his consent, induced
by wrongful use of actual or threatened force, violence, or fear, or under
color of official right.' Id. §§ 1951(b)(2) (defining extortion), 1961(1)
(defining 'racketeering activity' to include the offenses enumerated in §
1951). ... To demonstrate a pattern of such activity, the plaintiff must show
'continuity plus relationship,' i.e., 'that the racketeering predicates are
related, and that they amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal
activity.' H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 239, 109 S.Ct. 2893 (emphasis and internal
quotation marks omitted).
Summary
Requirements for a civil RICO claim, emphasizing the need for a "pattern of
racketeering activity," which includes demonstrating "continuity plus
relationship." This directly supports the proposition that RICO claims can be
based on both closed-ended and open-ended continuity, as it references the
need for related predicate acts that pose a threat of continued criminal
activity. The passage also references H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell
Telephone Co., which is a key case in understanding RICO's continuity
requirement.

Extract
To establish a pattern, a plaintiff must also make a showing that the
predicate acts of racketeering activity by a defendant are 'related, and that
they amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity.' See H.J., Inc.
v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 239 (1989). ... To satisfy open-
ended continuity, the plaintiff need not show that the predicates extended
over a substantial period of time but must show that there was a threat of
continuing criminal activity beyond the period during which the predicate
acts were performed. Id. at 242-43. In assessing whether or not the plaintiff
has shown open-ended continuity, the nature of the RICO enterprise and of
the predicate acts are relevant.
Summary
The court outlines the requirements for establishing a pattern of
racketeering activity under RICO. It emphasizes the need for predicate acts
to be related and to pose a threat of continued criminal activity, which aligns
with the proposition's assertion of both closed-ended and open-ended
continuity. The passage directly references the H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell
Telephone Co. case, which is central to the proposition.

a RICO claim must allege, among other things, relatedness and continuity.
Summary
The court emphasizes the need for a plaintiff to demonstrate both
relatedness and continuity of racketeering activity to establish a RICO claim.
The reference to H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co. supports the
proposition that RICO claims can be based on both closed-ended and open-
ended continuity. This aligns with the proposition that defendants' actions
can demonstrate both types of continuity, supporting a RICO claim.

Extract
Continuity encompasses both a close-ended and open-ended concept. A
party alleging a RICO violation may demonstrate continuity over a closed
period by proving a series of related predicate acts over a substantial period
of time. Otherwise, it must be shown that the predicate acts establish a
threat of long-term racketeering activity. Colonial Penn. Ins. Co. v. Value
Rent-A-Car Inc., 814 F.Supp. at 1094, (citing), H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell

Summary
Concept of continuity in RICO claims, which is central to the proposition. It
explains that continuity can be demonstrated through either closed-ended
continuity (a series of related predicate acts over a substantial period) or
open-ended continuity (a threat of ongoing criminal activity). This directly

McLaughlin v. Anderson, 962 F.2d 187 (2nd Cir. 1992)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Second Circuit
Extract
To prove a 'pattern of racketeering activity,' a RICO plaintiff must show that
the alleged predicate acts are both related in the relevant sense and amount
to, or threaten the likelihood of, 'continued criminal activity.' H.J., Inc. v.
Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. at 237, 109 S.Ct. at 2899. The
continuity element is satisfied by showing either the commission of related
predicate offenses during 'a closed period of repeated conduct' that lasts a
'substantial period of time' or the threat thereof, that is, 'past conduct that
by its nature projects into the future with a threat of repetition.' Id. at
241-42, 109 S.Ct. at 2901-02.
Summary
The passage from "McLaughlin v. Anderson" discusses the requirements for
establishing a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO, specifically
referencing the continuity element as defined in "H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern
Bell Telephone Co." It explains that continuity can be shown through either
closed-ended continuity (a series of related acts over a substantial period) or
open-ended continuity (a threat of future criminal activity). This directly
supports the proposition that defendants' actions can demonstrate both
types of continuity, thereby supporting a RICO claim.

Mar 23, 2021)

=== PAGE 17 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
U.S. District Court — Southern District of New York
Extract
To satisfy a pattern of racketeering activity, RICO requires 'at least two acts
of racketeering activity committed in a 10 year period.' The continuity
needed to prove this pattern can be either 'closed-ended' - which requires
the plaintiff to 'prove 'a series of related predicates extending over a
substantial period of time'' - or 'open-ended' - which requires the plaintiff to
show 'a threat of continuing criminal activity beyond the period during
which the predicate acts were performed.'
Summary
Legal basis for understanding how continuity can be established in RICO
cases, which is essential for the proposition.
Allwaste, Inc. v. Hecht, 65 F.3d 1523 (9th Cir. 1995)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Ninth Circuit
Extract
To prevail under RICO, plaintiffs must establish that the predicate acts were
continuous. This can be done either by pleading 'closed-ended continuity' or
by pleading 'open-ended continuity.' Closed-ended continuity refers to a
closed period of repeated conduct. It is established by showing that the
predicate acts occurred over a substantial period of time. If closed-ended
continuity cannot be established, plaintiffs may plead open-ended continuity.
Open-ended continuity refers to past conduct that by its nature indicates a
threat of future criminal conduct. It is established by showing either that the
predicate acts specifically threaten repetition or that they were an ongoing
entity's regular way of doing business.
Summary
Requirements for establishing continuity under RICO, which is central to the
proposition. It explains that continuity can be demonstrated through either
closed-ended or open-ended continuity. Closed-ended continuity involves a
series of related predicate acts over a substantial period, while open-ended
continuity involves a threat of ongoing criminal activity. This directly
supports the proposition that the defendants' actions demonstrate both
types of continuity, which is crucial for a RICO claim.

Extract
The pattern element 'requires at least two acts of racketeering activity.' 18
U.S.C. § 1961(5); see also H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S.
229, 237-38, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989). However, a mere
allegation of two or more acts is insufficient to state a RICO claim; the
predicate acts must be related and must 'amount to or pose a threat of
continued criminal activity.'
Summary
The pattern element of a RICO claim requires not just multiple acts of
racketeering, but also that these acts are related and pose a threat of
continued criminal activity. This aligns with the proposition that RICO claims
can be based on both closed-ended and open-ended continuity, as
established in H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co.
Schlaifer Nance & Co. v. Estate of Warhol, 119 F.3d 91 (2nd Cir. 1997)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Second Circuit
Extract
To show a RICO violation, the plaintiff must plead at least two predicate
acts, show that the predicate acts are related, and that they amount to, or
pose a threat of, continuing criminal activity. See H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern
Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 239, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 2900-01, 106 L.Ed.2d 195
(1989). Predicate acts are 'related' for RICO purposes when they 'have the
same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of
commission, or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics
and are not isolated events.' H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 240, 109 S.Ct. at 2901
(internal quotation marks omitted).
Summary
Requirements for a RICO violation, emphasizing the need for related
predicate acts and continuity, either closed-ended or open-ended. This
directly supports the proposition by confirming that RICO claims can be
based on a series of related acts over time or a threat of ongoing criminal
activity. The reference to H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co.
further solidifies the legal foundation for these requirements.

Evidence of multiple schemes is not required to show a threat of continued
criminal activity, id. at 240, 109 S.Ct. 2893, and, indeed, proof of a single
scheme can be sufficient so long as the predicate acts involved are not
isolated or sporadic. Sun Sav., 825 F.2d at 193, 194. The Supreme Court, in
H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 241, 109 S.Ct. 2893, expounded on RICO's continuity
requirement, stating: ... Thus, in order to allege open-ended continuity, a
RICO plaintiff must charge a form of predicate misconduct that 'by its
nature projects into the future with a threat of repetition.'
Summary
A single scheme can suffice for RICO claims if the predicate acts are not
isolated or sporadic, and it emphasizes the need for a threat of future
criminal activity to establish open-ended continuity. This aligns with the
proposition's assertion that ongoing threats and false statements in legal
documents demonstrate both closed-ended and open-ended continuity.
Midwest Grinding Co., Inc. v. Spitz, 976 F.2d 1016 (7th Cir. 1992)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Seventh Circuit
Extract
To that end, a civil RICO plaintiff may no longer get by merely alleging two
predicate acts, but must also satisfy the so-called 'continuity plus
relationship' test: the predicate acts must be related to one another (the
relationship prong) and pose a threat of continued criminal activity (the
continuity prong). H.J., Inc., 492 U.S. at 239, 109 S.Ct. at 2900; Sedima, 473
U.S. at 496 n. 14, 105 S.Ct. at 3285 n. 14. ... An open-ended period of
racketeering, by contrast, is a course of criminal activity which lacks the
duration and repetition to establish continuity. A RICO plaintiff may still
satisfy the continuity requirement in that situation, however, by showing
past conduct which 'by its nature projects into the future with a threat of
repetition.' Id. Such a threat of continuity exists when the plaintiff can show
(1) a 'specific threat of repetition,' (2) that the 'predicate acts or offenses are
part of an ongoing entity's regular way of doing business,' or (3) that the
defendant operates a 'long-term association that exists for criminal
purposes.'
Summary
The passage from Midwest Grinding Co., Inc. v. Spitz discusses the
requirements for establishing a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO,
specifically the "continuity plus relationship" test. It references the H.J. Inc.
case, which is directly cited in the proposition, and explains that continuity
can be demonstrated through either closed-ended or open-ended continuity.
The passage outlines that open-ended continuity can be shown by a threat of

future criminal activity, which aligns with the proposition's claim of ongoing
threats and future criminal activity by the defendants.
Vicom, Inc. v. Harbridge Merchant Services, Inc., 20 F.3d 771 (7th Cir. 1994)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Seventh Circuit
Extract
A pattern of racketeering activity consists of at least two predicate acts of
racketeering committed within a ten-year period. 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1961(5).
Because the RICO statute has nothing more to say about its pattern
requirement, the Supreme Court has attempted to sharpen the contours of
the pattern requirement in order to effectuate the congressional intent with
respect to the statute's use. The Court has stated that, because Congress
enacted RICO not out of concern for a sporadic fraudulent act but out of
concern for long-term conduct, 'a plaintiff ... must show that the
racketeering predicates are related, and that they amount to or pose a
threat of continued criminal activity.' H.J., Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co.,
492 U.S. 229, 239, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 2900, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989)... If no
specific threat of continuity exists, however, a RICO plaintiff can also allege
open-ended continuity by showing that 'the predicate acts are a regular way
of conducting [the] defendant's ongoing legitimate business.' H.J., Inc., 492
U.S. at 243, 109 S.Ct. at 2902.
Summary
Requirements for establishing a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO,
referencing the Supreme Court's decision in H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell
Telephone Co. It highlights the need for related predicate acts that either
amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity, which aligns with
the proposition's focus on demonstrating both closed-ended and open-ended
continuity. The passage also explains that open-ended continuity can be
shown if the predicate acts are a regular way of conducting the defendant's
business, which supports the idea of ongoing threats and future criminal
activity.

2893, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989), the Supreme Court observed that 'to prove a
pattern of racketeering activity a plaintiff ... must show that the

threat of continued criminal activity.' Continuity in this context refers 'either
to a closed period of repeated conduct, or to past conduct that by its nature
projects into the future with a threat of repetition.' Id. at 241, 109 S.Ct.
2893. To satisfy the RICO continuity element, therefore, a plaintiff must
provide evidence of multiple predicate acts occurring over a substantial
period of time (closed-end continuity) or evidence that the alleged predicate
acts threaten to extend into the future (open-ended continuity). Id. at 242,
109 S.Ct. 2893.
Summary
The passage from the case references the Supreme Court's decision in H.J.
Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co., which is a foundational case for
understanding the continuity requirement in RICO claims. It explains that
continuity can be established through either closed-ended continuity (a
series of related acts over time) or open-ended continuity (a threat of
ongoing criminal activity). This directly supports the proposition that the
defendants' actions demonstrate both types of continuity, which is essential
for a RICO claim.
18 U.S.C. § 1962 18 U.S.C. § 1962 Prohibited Activities
Extract
It shall be unlawful for any person through a pattern of racketeering activity
or through collection of an unlawful debt to acquire or maintain, directly or
indirectly, any interest in or control of any enterprise which is engaged in, or
the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce.
Summary
The passage from 18 U.S.C. § 1962 outlines the unlawful nature of
conducting or participating in an enterprise's affairs through a pattern of
racketeering activity. This directly supports the proposition that defendants'
actions, which include ongoing threats and false statements, could be
considered part of a pattern of racketeering activity. The statute's focus on
patterns of activity aligns with the concept of both closed-ended and open-
ended continuity, as it addresses ongoing criminal conduct and the
maintenance of control over an enterprise through unlawful means.

activity' is a function of particular facts.
Summary
The concept of continuity under RICO can be satisfied by either closed-
ended or open-ended continuity. Closed-ended continuity involves a series of
related predicate acts over a substantial period, while open-ended continuity

involves conduct that poses a threat of future criminal activity. The passage
supports the proposition by explaining how both types of continuity can be
established, which aligns with the claim that the defendants' actions
demonstrate both closed-ended and open-ended continuity.

closed-ended continuity requires a series of related predicate acts over a

Extract
The 'continuity' prong is satisfied by proof of either closed-ended continuity
or open-ended continuity. Closed-ended continuity is defined as 'a series of
related predicates extending over a substantial period of time.' Open-ended
continuity is defined as conduct that may last only a short period of time but
nonetheless, poses a threat of extending into the future. The Court
suggested a case-by-case examination of this issue, noting that the existence
of a 'threat of continued racketeering activity' is a function of particular
facts.
Summary
The concept of continuity under RICO can be satisfied by either closed-
ended or open-ended continuity. Closed-ended continuity involves a series of
related acts over a substantial period, while open-ended continuity involves
conduct that poses a threat of future criminal activity. This aligns with the
proposition that the defendants' actions demonstrate both types of
continuity, supporting a RICO claim.

Extract
The Supreme Court made a second attempt to clarify the 'pattern' concept in
H.J., Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co. The Court held that in order to
prove a 'pattern of racketeering activity' for RICO purposes, the government
must establish both (a) relationship and (b) continuity of predicate acts. This
test is referred to as the 'continuity plus relationship' test. The 'continuity'
prong is successfully proven if a prosecutor can prove 'a series of related
predicates extending over a substantial period of time' or an open-ended
threat of continued racketeering activity in the future.

Summary
The Supreme Court's decision in H.J., Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone
Co. provides a framework for establishing a "pattern of racketeering
activity" under RICO. This framework requires demonstrating both a
relationship and continuity of predicate acts. The continuity can be shown
through either a series of related acts over a substantial period (closed-
ended continuity) or a threat of ongoing criminal activity (open-ended
continuity). This directly supports the proposition that the defendants'
actions can be evaluated under both closed-ended and open-ended
continuity for a RICO claim.
Chapter 4. Elements of Cause of Action
Civil RICO: A Definitive Guide. Fifth Edition - American Bar
Association - Gregory P. Joseph
Extract
Under the 'less inflexible approach' adopted in H.J. Inc., continuity is 'both a
closed- and open-ended concept.' Id. at 241. Closed-ended continuity refers
'to a closed period of repeated conduct,' while open-ended continuity
denotes 'past conduct that by its nature projects into the future with a threat
of repetition.' ... Closed-ended continuity may be demonstrated with proof of
'a series of related predicates extending over a substantial period of time.'
Id. at 242 ... Open-ended continuity, in contrast, requires proof of 'a threat of
continued racketeering activity.' Id. at 242.
Summary
The passage from the guide explains the concepts of closed-ended and open-
ended continuity as they relate to RICO claims, referencing the Supreme
Court's decision in H.J. Inc. This decision is a key authority on the continuity
requirement for RICO claims, establishing that continuity can be shown
through either a series of related predicate acts over a substantial period
(closed-ended) or a threat of ongoing criminal activity (open-ended). The
passage supports the proposition by explaining these concepts and how they
apply to demonstrating continuity in RICO claims.

Extract
The inquiry here is meant to invoke the 'pattern of racketeering activity'
element of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).

=== PAGE 28 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
The Organized Crime Control Act (1970), which includes RICO, provides that
'criminal conduct forms a pattern if it embraces criminal acts that have the
same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of
commission, or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics
and are not isolated events.' The Supreme Court characterized this
requirement as a 'relationship' element and held that the statute further
requires a 'continuity' element, 'referring either to a closed period of
repeated conduct, or to past conduct that by its nature projects into the
future with a threat of repetition.'
Summary
Elements required to establish a pattern of racketeering activity under
RICO, specifically the relationship and continuity elements. It explains that
continuity can be demonstrated through either a closed period of repeated
conduct or past conduct that suggests a threat of future repetition. This
directly supports the proposition that the defendants' actions demonstrate
both closed-ended and open-ended continuity, which are necessary for a
RICO claim.
RICO: A Primer
Extract
A plaintiff may demonstrate a pattern by establishment that the predicate
acts pose a threat of continued criminal activity, which is generally
demonstrated by showing either: * Closed-ended continuity. Proving 'a series
of related predicate acts extending over a substantial period of time.' *
Open-ended continuity. A threat of 'continuing criminal activity extending
indefinitely into the future,' in light of the nature of the enterprise and
predicate acts alleged.
Summary
RICO claims require demonstrating a pattern of racketeering activity, which
can be shown through either closed-ended or open-ended continuity. The
passage explains that closed-ended continuity involves a series of related
predicate acts over a substantial period, while open-ended continuity
involves a threat of ongoing criminal activity. This directly supports the
proposition that the defendants' actions demonstrate both types of
continuity, which is essential for establishing a RICO claim.

Summary
The passage provides a clear explanation of how a pattern of racketeering
activity can be established under RICO. It specifically mentions the concepts
of closed-ended continuity (a series of related predicate acts over a
substantial period) and open-ended continuity (a threat of ongoing criminal
activity), which are directly relevant to the proposition. The passage
supports the idea that the defendants' actions, as described in the
proposition, could demonstrate both types of continuity, thereby supporting
a RICO claim.
