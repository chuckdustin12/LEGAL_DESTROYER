Question
What is the hierarchy of legal authorities in Texas, including the Texas
Constitution, statutes (such as the Government Code, Penal Code, Family
Code), administrative regulations, Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, Texas
Rules of Evidence, judicial conduct rules, attorney rules, and case law?
Please organize these authorities by their legal hierarchy.
Answer (Texas)
Short response
The hierarchy of legal authorities in Texas places the Texas Constitution at
the top, followed by statutes enacted by the legislature, administrative
regulations, court-promulgated procedural and evidentiary rules, and finally,
case law interpreting these authorities. Each level of authority is
subordinate to those above it, with procedural and administrative rules
yielding to constitutional and statutory law, and case law serving to interpret
and apply these higher authorities.
Summary
In Texas, the legal hierarchy is structured to ensure that the Texas
Constitution is the supreme source of law within the state, subject only to
the United States Constitution. Statutes enacted by the Texas Legislature,
such as the Government Code, Penal Code, and Family Code, are
subordinate to the Constitution and take precedence over administrative
regulations and court rules, except in limited circumstances where
procedural rules may repeal conflicting statutes as authorized by law.
Administrative regulations, including those promulgated by state agencies,
must conform to both constitutional and statutory mandates. The Texas
Supreme Court has authority to promulgate rules of civil procedure and
evidence, but these rules cannot conflict with substantive law established by
the legislature or the Constitution. Case law, while authoritative in
interpreting and applying these sources, is subordinate to the Constitution,
statutes, and validly adopted rules and regulations.
Background and Relevant Law
The Texas Constitution
The Texas Constitution is the highest legal authority in the state,
establishing the framework for government, the separation of powers, and
the supremacy of constitutional provisions over all other forms of state law.
The Constitution divides the powers of government into legislative,
executive, and judicial branches, and prohibits any branch from exercising
powers assigned to another, except as expressly permitted (Armadillo Bail

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Bonds v. State, 772 S.W.2d 193, 195 (Tex. App. 1989)). The Constitution also
grants the Texas Supreme Court authority to promulgate rules of
administration and civil procedure, provided these rules are not inconsistent
with state law (Tex. Const. art. 5 § 31).
Statutes
Statutes enacted by the Texas Legislature, such as the Government Code,
Penal Code, and Family Code, are the next highest authority after the
Constitution. Statutes must conform to the Constitution and are binding on
all state actors. The Texas Government Code, for example, grants the
Supreme Court rulemaking power in civil actions but explicitly states that
such rules cannot abridge, enlarge, or modify substantive rights, and that
rules conflicting with statutes are repealed only if the rule is adopted after
the statute and expressly repeals it (Tex. Gov't. Code § 22.004).
Administrative Regulations
Administrative regulations are promulgated by state agencies under
authority granted by statute. These regulations must be consistent with both
the Constitution and statutes. In the event of a conflict, constitutional and
statutory provisions control over administrative rules (22 Tex. Admin. Code §
881.10).
Court Rules (Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, Texas Rules of Evidence,
Judicial Conduct Rules, Attorney Rules)
The Texas Supreme Court is empowered to promulgate rules of civil
procedure and evidence, as well as rules for judicial administration and
attorney conduct, but only to the extent that these rules do not conflict with
the Constitution or statutes (Tex. Const. art. 5 § 31; Tex. Gov't. Code §
22.004). The rules of civil procedure and evidence have the force and effect
of statutes, but if a conflict arises between a rule and a statute, the statute
generally prevails unless the rule was adopted after the statute and
expressly repeals it (Senter Invs., L.L.C. v. Veerjee, 358 S.W.3d 841, 849
(Tex. App. 2012); Few v. Charter Oak Fire Insurance Company, 463 S.W.2d
424, 426 (Tex. 1971)).
Case Law
Case law consists of judicial decisions interpreting the Constitution,
statutes, administrative regulations, and court rules. While case law is
binding on lower courts and provides authoritative interpretations, it is
subordinate to the Constitution, statutes, and validly adopted rules and
regulations. Courts are required to interpret and apply higher authorities
faithfully, and their decisions may be superseded by subsequent legislative
or constitutional amendments.

Analysis
Hierarchy of Legal Authorities in Texas
Texas Constitution: The Texas Constitution is the supreme law of the
state, subject only to the United States Constitution. All other state
laws, including statutes, administrative regulations, and court rules,
must conform to its provisions. The Constitution establishes the
separation of powers and grants the Texas Supreme Court rulemaking
authority, but only within the limits set by the Constitution and statutes
(Armadillo Bail Bonds v. State, 772 S.W.2d 193, 195 (Tex. App. 1989); 
Tex. Const. art. 5 § 31).
Statutes (e.g., Government Code, Penal Code, Family Code):
Statutes enacted by the Texas Legislature are subordinate only to the
Constitution. They provide the substantive law governing the state and
may delegate rulemaking authority to courts and administrative
agencies. Statutes prevail over conflicting administrative regulations
and court rules, except in the limited circumstance where a procedural
rule is adopted after the statute and expressly repeals it as authorized
by the Government Code (Tex. Gov't. Code § 22.004; Senter Invs., L.L.C.
v. Veerjee, 358 S.W.3d 841, 849 (Tex. App. 2012)).
Administrative Regulations: Regulations promulgated by state
agencies under statutory authority are subordinate to both the
Constitution and statutes. In the event of a conflict, constitutional and
statutory provisions control (22 Tex. Admin. Code § 881.10).
Court Rules (Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, Texas Rules of
Evidence, Judicial Conduct Rules, Attorney Rules): The Texas
Supreme Court has authority to promulgate rules of civil procedure,
evidence, and other rules for the administration of justice. These rules
have the force and effect of statutes but cannot conflict with
substantive law or the Constitution. If a procedural rule conflicts with a
statute, the statute generally prevails unless the rule was adopted after
the statute and expressly repeals it (Tex. Gov't. Code § 22.004; Guillory
v. Seaton, LLC, 470 S.W.3d 237, 241 (Tex. App. 2015); Few v. Charter
Oak Fire Insurance Company, 463 S.W.2d 424, 426 (Tex. 1971)). Local
court rules are subordinate to statewide rules and must be consistent
with them (In re El Paso Healthcare System, Ltd., 225 S.W.3d 146, 150
(Tex. App. 2005)).
Case Law: Judicial decisions interpret and apply the Constitution,
statutes, regulations, and court rules. While case law is binding and
authoritative, it is subordinate to the higher authorities it interprets.
Courts must yield to constitutional and statutory mandates, and their
interpretations may be superseded by subsequent legislative or
constitutional changes (In re Google, 705 S.W.3d 479, 482 (Tex. App.
2025)).

Application to Specific Authorities
Texas Constitution: Supreme authority; all other state law must
conform.
Statutes (Government Code, Penal Code, Family Code, etc.):
Subordinate to the Constitution; control over administrative regulations
and court rules except as specifically provided by law.
Administrative Regulations: Must be consistent with statutes and the
Constitution; subordinate to both.
Texas Rules of Civil Procedure and Evidence: Promulgated by the
Supreme Court under constitutional and statutory authority; have the
force of statutes but cannot conflict with substantive law or the
Constitution. In case of conflict with a statute, the statute prevails
unless the rule was adopted after the statute and expressly repeals it.
Judicial Conduct Rules and Attorney Rules: Promulgated under
similar authority as procedural rules; subordinate to statutes and the
Constitution.
Case Law: Interprets and applies the above authorities; subordinate to
the Constitution, statutes, and validly adopted rules and regulations.
Interplay and Conflict Resolution
The Texas legal system provides mechanisms for resolving conflicts between
different sources of law. When a procedural rule conflicts with a statute, the
statute generally prevails unless the rule was adopted after the statute and
expressly repeals it as authorized by the Government Code (Senter Invs.,
L.L.C. v. Veerjee, 358 S.W.3d 841, 849 (Tex. App. 2012)). Administrative
regulations are always subordinate to statutes and the Constitution (22 Tex.
Admin. Code § 881.10). Case law must interpret and apply these authorities
faithfully, and courts are bound by higher authorities.
Exceptions and Caveats
There are limited circumstances in which a procedural rule may supersede a
statute, specifically when the rule is adopted after the statute and expressly
repeals it as authorized by the Government Code (Tex. Gov't. Code §
22.004). However, this is the exception rather than the rule, and statutes
generally prevail over conflicting procedural rules. Additionally, while the
Texas Supreme Court has broad rulemaking authority, it cannot use this
power to alter substantive rights established by statute or the Constitution.
No negative or subsequent treatment affecting the core principles outlined
above has been identified in the provided sources.
Conclusion
The hierarchy of legal authorities in Texas is clear: the Texas Constitution is
supreme, followed by statutes enacted by the legislature, administrative
regulations, court-promulgated rules, and finally, case law interpreting these
authorities. Each level of authority is subordinate to those above it, and
conflicts are resolved in favor of the higher authority, with only narrow

exceptions as provided by law. This structure ensures the primacy of the
Constitution and statutes in the Texas legal system, while allowing for the
necessary flexibility and interpretation provided by administrative
regulations, court rules, and judicial decisions.
Legal Authorities
Few v. Charter Oak Fire Insurance Company, 463 S.W.2d 424 (Tex. 1971)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
Article V, Sec. 25, of the Texas Constitution, Vernon's Ann.St. vests in the
Supreme Court the power to establish rules of procedure 'not inconsistent
with the law of the State.' Legislative authority for this power is found in
Article 1731a, Sec. 2. Rule 39 was established pursuant to this power. As the
constitutional provision indicates, this is a limited power; and when a rule of
the court conflicts with a legislative enactment, the rule must yield.
Summary
The Texas Constitution grants the Supreme Court the power to establish
procedural rules, but these rules must not conflict with state law. If a
conflict arises between a court rule and a legislative enactment, the
legislative enactment prevails. This indicates that statutes enacted by the
legislature have a higher authority than procedural rules established by the
court.
Parker v. State, 51 S.W.3d 719 (Tex. App. 2001)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The separation of powers provision of the Texas Constitution may be violated
in two ways: (1) when one branch of government assumes, or is delegated,
to whatever degree, a power that is more 'properly attached' to another
branch, and (2) when one branch unduly interferes with another branch
such that the other branch cannot effectively exercise its constitutionally
assigned powers. ... The present language that appears in the Texas
Constitution in Article V, § 31 Court Administration, Rule Making Authority,
provides in subsection (a) that the Texas Supreme Court promulgate the
rules of administration not inconsistent with the laws of the state; in
subsection (b) the Texas Constitution provides that the Texas Supreme Court
shall promulgate the Rules of Civil Procedure not inconsistent with the laws
of the state; and in subsection (c), the Legislature may designate to the
Texas Supreme Court or the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals the power to

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
promulgate other rules as prescribed by law or the Texas Constitution
subject to limitations and procedures as may be provided by law.
Summary
The Texas Constitution is the supreme legal authority in Texas, establishing
the separation of powers and the rule-making authority of the Texas
Supreme Court. The Texas Supreme Court is empowered to promulgate
rules of administration and civil procedure, provided they are not
inconsistent with state laws. The Legislature can also delegate rule-making
authority to the Texas Supreme Court or the Texas Court of Criminal
Appeals, subject to legal limitations and procedures.
In re El Paso Healthcare System, Ltd., 225 S.W.3d 146 (Tex. App. 2005)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The Legislature has vested the Supreme Court of Texas with exclusive
rulemaking authority in the practice and procedure in civil actions. See
TEX.GOV'T CODE ANN. § 22.004 (Vernon 2004). Under that authority, the
Supreme Court has adopted the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, which have
the same force and effect as statutes. See TEX.R.CIV.P. 2, 814; Missouri Pac.
R.R. Co. v. Cross, 501 S.W.2d 868, 872 (Tex.1973). Rule 3a of the Texas Rules
of Civil Procedure permits each administrative judicial region, district court,
county court, county court at law, and probate to make and amend local
rules governing practice before such courts, provided that any proposed rule
or amendment is not inconsistent with the Rules of Civil Procedure. See
TEX.R.CIV.P. 3a(1).
Summary
The passage provides insight into the hierarchy of legal authorities in Texas
by explaining the rulemaking authority of the Texas Supreme Court. It states
that the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, adopted by the Supreme Court, have
the same force and effect as statutes. This indicates that these rules are on
par with statutory law in the legal hierarchy. Additionally, it highlights the
process for local courts to make and amend rules, which must be consistent
with the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, further emphasizing the
hierarchical structure.

Extract
From the Constitution of the State of Texas, we know that the people of
Texas have divided the powers of government of the State of Texas into
three departments. We know also that these three departments are the
legislative, the executive, and the judicial, and that none of these
departments can exercise any power assigned by the constitution to either
of the others. As commanded by the Constitution of the State of Texas: The
powers of the Government of the State of Texas shall be divided into three
distinct departments, each of which shall be confided to a separate body of
magistracy, to wit: Those which are Legislative to one, those which are
Executive to another, and those which are Judicial to another; and no
person, or collection of persons, being of one of these departments, shall
exercise any power properly attached to either of the others, except in
instances herein expressly permitted. TEX. CONST. art. II, § 1.
Summary
The Texas Constitution is the supreme legal authority in Texas, establishing
the separation of powers among the legislative, executive, and judicial
branches. This separation is a fundamental principle that underpins the
hierarchy of legal authorities in Texas. The passage highlights the
constitutional basis for the division of powers, which is essential for
understanding the hierarchy of legal authorities in the state.

Extract
"[W]hen a rule of procedure conflicts with a statute, the statute prevails
unless the rule has been passed subsequent to the statute and repeals the
statute as provided by Texas Government Code § 22.004." Jackson v. State
Office of Admin. Hearings, 351 S.W.3d 290, 298–99 (Tex.2011) (quoting
Johnstone v. State, 22 S.W.3d 408, 409 (Tex.2000)); see Tex. Gov't Code Ann.
§ 22.004; Few v. Charter Oak Fire Ins. Co., 463 S.W.2d 424, 425 (Tex.1971)
("[Where a] rule of the court conflicts with a legislative enactment, the rule
must yield.").
Summary
In Texas, when there is a conflict between a rule of procedure and a statute,
the statute generally prevails unless the procedural rule was enacted after
the statute and explicitly repeals it as per Texas Government Code § 22.004.
This indicates that statutes have a higher legal authority than procedural
rules unless specific conditions are met.

Guillory v. Seaton, LLC, 470 S.W.3d 237 (Tex. App. 2015)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Article V, section 31(b) of the Texas Constitution authorizes the Texas
Supreme Court to “promulgate rules of civil procedure for all courts not
inconsistent with the laws of the state as may be necessary for the efficient
and uniform administration of justice in the various courts.” Tex. Const. art.
V, § 31 (b); In re M.N., 262 S.W.3d 799, 802 (Tex.2008). The Texas
Government Code further specifies that “[t]he supreme court has the full
rulemaking power in the practice and procedure in civil actions, except that
its rules may not abridge, enlarge, or modify the substantive rights of a
litigant.” Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 22.004(a) ; In re M.N., 262 S.W.3d at 802.
Moreover, “[s]o that the supreme court has full rulemaking power in civil
actions, a rule adopted by the supreme court repeals all conflicting laws and
parts of laws governing practice and procedure in civil actions, but
substantive law is not repealed.” Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 22.004(c) ; In re
M.N., 262 S.W.3d at 802.
Summary
The passage provides insight into the hierarchy by explaining the Texas
Supreme Court's authority to create rules of civil procedure, which must not
conflict with state laws. This indicates that the Texas Constitution and
statutes hold a higher position in the hierarchy than procedural rules, as the
latter cannot override substantive law.
In re Google, 705 S.W.3d 479 (Tex. App. 2025)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The first clause of the Texas Constitution declares, 'Texas is a free and
independent State, subject only to the Constitution of the United States.' ...
Although the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure are not codified, the Code
Construction Act can be used in interpreting them because the Texas
Supreme Court passes the rules pursuant to its authority under Section
22.004 of the Government Code, in addition to its constitutional authority.
Summary
The passage highlights the supremacy of the Texas Constitution, indicating
it is subject only to the U.S. Constitution. It also mentions the Texas Rules of
Civil Procedure, which are interpreted using the Code Construction Act, and
are established under the authority of the Texas Supreme Court and the
Government Code. This suggests a hierarchy where the Texas Constitution is

at the top, followed by statutes like the Government Code, and then
procedural rules like the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure.

Extract
HISD further urges that the statutory scheme and the rules of appellate
procedure cannot be construed as neutering judicial power in the way
Relators suggest without violating the separation-of-powers doctrine
established in Article II, Section 1 of the Texas Constitution.
Summary
The passage highlights the importance of the Texas Constitution, specifically
Article II, Section 1, which establishes the separation-of-powers doctrine.
This doctrine is a fundamental principle that underpins the hierarchy of
legal authorities in Texas, ensuring that the legislative, executive, and
judicial branches of government operate independently. This constitutional
principle is paramount and influences the interpretation and application of
statutes, rules, and case law in Texas.
Tex. Gov't. Code § 22.004 Tex. Gov't. Code § 22.004 [Effective Until
12/4/2025] Rules of Civil Procedure
Extract
The supreme court has the full rulemaking power in the practice and
procedure in civil actions, except that its rules may not abridge, enlarge, or
modify the substantive rights of a litigant... The rules and amendments to
rules remain in effect unless and until disapproved by the legislature... So
that the supreme court has full rulemaking power in civil actions, a rule
adopted by the supreme court repeals all conflicting laws and parts of laws
governing practice and procedure in civil actions, but substantive law is not
repealed.
Summary
The Texas Supreme Court has the authority to promulgate rules of civil
procedure, which can repeal conflicting procedural laws but cannot alter
substantive rights. This indicates that the Texas Supreme Court's rules of
civil procedure hold significant authority, but they are subject to legislative
oversight and cannot conflict with substantive law.

Summary
In the event of a conflict, the state or federal constitution, statutes, or
federal guidelines take precedence over the rules of the Texas Behavioral

Extract
The Supreme Court is responsible for the efficient administration of the
judicial branch and shall promulgate rules of administration not inconsistent
with the laws of the state as may be necessary for the efficient and uniform
administration of justice in the various courts. The Supreme Court shall
promulgate rules of civil procedure for all courts not inconsistent with the
laws of the state as may be necessary for the efficient and uniform
administration of justice in the various courts. The legislature may delegate
to the Supreme Court or Court of Criminal Appeals the power to promulgate
such other rules as may be prescribed by law or this Constitution, subject to
such limitations and procedures as may be provided by law.
Summary
The Texas Supreme Court has the authority to promulgate rules of
administration and civil procedure for the courts, provided these rules are
not inconsistent with state laws. This indicates that the Texas Constitution
grants the Supreme Court rule-making authority, which is a significant
aspect of the legal hierarchy in Texas. The legislature can also delegate rule-
making powers to the Supreme Court or Court of Criminal Appeals, further
emphasizing the role of these courts in the legal hierarchy.
