Question
The regional presiding judge has been using the court coordinator to handle matters related to recusal. There is no adequate remedy by appeal for the improper
handling of recusal motions, as such errors affect the fairness and impartiality of the proceedings. Texas courts have consistently held that mandamus relief is
appropriate to address violations of Rule 18a and to ensure compliance with procedural rules governing recusal (e.g., *In re Union Pac. Res. Co.*, 969 S.W.2d
427, 428-29 (Tex. 1998)). The regional presiding judge's failure to personally address or refer recusal motions, as required by Rule 18a, constitutes a clear abuse
of discretion that warrants mandamus relief. Mandamus relief is necessary to compel the regional presiding judge to comply with Rule 18a and to protect the
integrity of the judicial process.
Answer (Texas)
Introduction and Overview:
The central issue is whether the regional presiding judge’s practice of delegating the handling of recusal motions to a court coordinator, rather than personally
addressing or referring such motions as required by Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a and related statutes, constitutes a clear abuse of discretion warranting
mandamus relief. The user seeks to establish that there is no adequate remedy by appeal for the improper handling of recusal motions, as such errors undermine
the fairness and impartiality of judicial proceedings. The most effective argument is that Texas law imposes a mandatory, non-delegable duty on the presiding
judge to either recuse or refer recusal motions, and that deviation from this process—such as by using a court coordinator—constitutes a clear abuse of discretion
for which mandamus is the appropriate remedy. This note provides a comprehensive analysis of the relevant statutory framework, case law, and procedural rules,
and addresses potential vulnerabilities and counterarguments.
Relevant Facts and Factual Assumptions:
The following facts are assumed or established for the purposes of this analysis:
1. A motion to recuse a trial judge has been filed in a Texas court.
2. The regional presiding judge, rather than personally addressing or referring the motion as required by law, has delegated the matter to a court coordinator.
3. The court coordinator, not being a judge, has taken steps to process or otherwise handle the recusal motion.
4. The party seeking recusal contends that this delegation violates the mandatory procedures set forth in Rule 18a and related statutes.
5. The party further asserts that there is no adequate remedy by appeal, as the improper handling of the recusal motion affects the fairness and impartiality of the
proceedings.
Potential ambiguities:
•
The precise actions taken by the court coordinator (e.g., scheduling, substantive review, or other administrative steps) are not specified. If the coordinator
merely performed ministerial tasks under the judge’s direct supervision, the argument may be weaker; if the coordinator exercised discretion or made
substantive decisions, the argument is stronger.
•
It is not specified whether the recusal motion was facially sufficient and timely, but for the purposes of this analysis, we assume it was.
Legal Principles and Points of Law:
Mandatory Nature of Recusal Procedures:
•
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a and related statutes (Tex. Gov’t Code §§ 74.059, 25.00255, 29.056) impose a mandatory duty on a judge who is the
subject of a recusal motion to either recuse themselves or refer the motion to the presiding judge for assignment to another judge. This duty is
non-discretionary and must be strictly followed. See Hudson v. Texas Children's Hosp., 177 S.W.3d 232, 233 (Tex. 2005) (“the recuse or refer procedure is
mandatory”); De Leon v. Aguilar, 127 S.W.3d 1, 5 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004) (“Rule 18a leaves a trial judge with no discretion—the trial judge must either
recuse himself or refer the motion for another judge to decide”); McLeod v. Harris, 582 S.W.2d 772, 775 (Tex. 1979).
Non-Delegable Judicial Duty:
•
The statutes and rules require the judge—not a staff member or coordinator—to act. Tex. Gov’t Code § 74.059(c)(3) (“a district, statutory probate, or
statutory county court judge shall: ... request the presiding judge to assign another judge to hear a motion relating to the recusal of the judge from a case
pending in his court”); Tex. Gov’t Code § 29.056 (“A regional presiding judge who receives a request ... shall: immediately set a hearing ... and cause
notice of the hearing to be given to all parties ...”). The use of “shall” and the assignment of duties to the judge underscore the non-delegable nature of
these responsibilities.
Mandamus as the Appropriate Remedy:
•
Mandamus relief is available to correct a clear abuse of discretion or the violation of a ministerial duty when there is no adequate remedy by appeal. See In
re Union Pac. Res. Co., 969 S.W.2d 427, 428-29 (Tex. 1998); In re Lucio, WR-72, 702-03 (Tex. Crim. App. Apr. 25, 2022); In re Amir-Sharif, No.
13-19-00573-CV (Tex. App. Dec. 12, 2019); Walker v. Packer, 827 S.W.2d 833, 839 (Tex. 1992).
No Adequate Remedy by Appeal:
•
When a judge fails to comply with the mandatory recusal procedures, the movant is deprived of the opportunity to develop a record for appeal, and thus
lacks an adequate remedy by appeal. See Monroe v. Blackmon, 946 S.W.2d 533, 534 (Tex. App. 1997); Winfield v. Daggett, 846 S.W.2d 920, 922 (Tex.
App. 1993).
Effect of Procedural Defects and Void Orders:

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
•
Any order entered by a judge after a proper recusal motion is filed, other than an order of recusal or referral, is void. See Rio Grande Valley Gas Co., In re,
987 S.W.2d 167, 179 (Tex. App. 1999); Carson v. Gomez, 841 S.W.2d 491, 492 (Tex. App. 1992).
Recent Negative Treatment of Brosseau v. Ranzau:
•
Brosseau v. Ranzau, 28 S.W.3d 235 (Tex. App. 2000), which held that a trial judge has only two options when faced with a recusal motion, was overruled
by Brosseau v. Ranzau, 58 S.W.3d 305 (Tex. App. 2001). While the original case supports the mandatory nature of the recusal/referral procedure, its
persuasive value is diminished by the subsequent overruling and should be cited with caution.
Application and Analysis:
The Regional Presiding Judge’s Non-Delegable Duty:
•
The statutory and rule-based framework is unequivocal: the judge must personally act on a recusal motion. Tex. Gov’t Code § 74.059(c)(3) and Rule
18a(c) both use mandatory language (“shall”) and assign the duty to the judge, not to staff. The Texas Supreme Court in Hudson and McLeod confirmed
that this is a non-discretionary, ministerial duty. Delegating this responsibility to a court coordinator is not contemplated by the rules or statutes and
constitutes a clear deviation from the required process.
Mandamus is the Proper Remedy:
•
The Texas Supreme Court and Courts of Appeals have repeatedly held that mandamus is the appropriate remedy when a judge fails to comply with the
mandatory recusal/referral procedure. See In re Union Pac. Res. Co., 969 S.W.2d at 428-29 (“Mandamus is proper to correct a clear abuse of discretion
for which there is no adequate remedy by appeal”); In re Lucio, WR-72, 702-03 (Tex. Crim. App. Apr. 25, 2022) (mandamus granted where judge failed to
rule on or refer recusal motion); In re Amir-Sharif, No. 13-19-00573-CV (Tex. App. Dec. 12, 2019) (mandamus appropriate to compel compliance with Rule
18a).
No Adequate Remedy by Appeal:
•
The improper handling of a recusal motion deprives the movant of the opportunity to develop a record for appeal, and thus there is no adequate remedy by
appeal. See Monroe v. Blackmon, 946 S.W.2d at 534; Winfield v. Daggett, 846 S.W.2d at 922. This is especially true where the judge’s failure to act or
improper delegation prevents the recusal motion from being properly heard.
Void Orders and the Integrity of Proceedings:
•
Any order entered after a recusal motion is filed, other than an order of recusal or referral, is void. See Rio Grande Valley Gas Co., In re, 987 S.W.2d at
179; Carson v. Gomez, 841 S.W.2d at 492. This underscores the seriousness of the procedural violation and the necessity of mandamus to protect the
integrity of the judicial process.
Judicial Fairness and Impartiality:
•
The recusal procedures are designed to safeguard the fairness and impartiality of judicial proceedings. Any practice that circumvents these
procedures—such as delegating to a court coordinator—undermines these fundamental goals. See In re PG & E Reata Energy, et al., 4 S.W.3d 897, 900
(Tex. App. 1999) (“The procedures governing recusal are designed to address concerns of judicial fairness and impartiality, goals which are undermined by
any practice that short-circuits the mandatory procedures”).
Procedural Sufficiency and Timeliness:
•
Even if a recusal motion is procedurally defective, the judge must refer it for determination by another judge. See Carson v. Gomez, 841 S.W.2d at 492
(“Even if the motion were procedurally defective, the trial judge should have referred the motion so that another judge would make that determination”).
Key Submissions:
1. The regional presiding judge’s duty to personally address or refer recusal motions is mandatory and non-delegable. See Hudson v. Texas Children's Hosp.,
177 S.W.3d at 233; Tex. Gov’t Code §§ 74.059, 25.00255, 29.056; Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a.
2. Delegating this duty to a court coordinator constitutes a clear abuse of discretion and a violation of a ministerial duty. See De Leon v. Aguilar, 127 S.W.3d at 5;
McLeod v. Harris, 582 S.W.2d at 775.
3. Mandamus is the appropriate remedy because there is no adequate remedy by appeal for the improper handling of recusal motions. See In re Lucio, WR-72,
702-03; Monroe v. Blackmon, 946 S.W.2d at 534.
4. Any orders entered after a recusal motion is filed, other than an order of recusal or referral, are void. See Rio Grande Valley Gas Co., In re, 987 S.W.2d at
179.
5. The integrity of the judicial process and the appearance of impartiality require strict compliance with recusal procedures. See In re PG & E Reata Energy, et
al., 4 S.W.3d at 900.
Alternative Arguments and Nuanced Points:
•
Ministerial vs. Administrative Delegation: Opposing counsel may argue that the court coordinator’s actions were purely ministerial and did not involve any
substantive decision-making. However, the authorities make clear that the duty to act on a recusal motion is personal to the judge and cannot be delegated,
regardless of the nature of the task. See Hudson, De Leon, and Tex. Gov’t Code § 74.059.
•
Procedural Defects in the Recusal Motion: If the recusal motion was not timely or facially sufficient, the judge may have some discretion not to refer it.
However, the prevailing view is that even procedurally defective motions should be referred for determination by another judge. See Carson v. Gomez, 841
S.W.2d at 492.

•
Negative Treatment of Brosseau v. Ranzau: While Brosseau v. Ranzau, 28 S.W.3d 235 (Tex. App. 2000), supports the mandatory nature of the
recusal/referral procedure, it was overruled by Brosseau v. Ranzau, 58 S.W.3d 305 (Tex. App. 2001). Therefore, reliance on this case should be limited, and
the argument should be grounded in the more robust and still-valid authorities cited above.
Areas of Risk:
1. Ambiguity in the Court Coordinator’s Role: If the coordinator’s actions were purely administrative and under the judge’s direct supervision, a court may find
that there was no substantive violation. Mitigation: Emphasize that the statutory and rule-based duties are personal to the judge and that even administrative
delegation is not contemplated by the rules. See Hudson, De Leon.
2. Procedural Defects in the Recusal Motion: If the motion was not timely or sufficient, the judge may have had discretion not to refer it. Mitigation: Argue that
the judge should refer even arguably defective motions for determination by another judge. See Carson v. Gomez, 841 S.W.2d at 492.
3. Recent Negative Treatment of Supporting Authority: The overruling of Brosseau v. Ranzau diminishes its persuasive value. Mitigation: Rely primarily on
the Texas Supreme Court and Court of Criminal Appeals authorities, which remain good law.
Conclusion:
The strongest argument is that Texas law imposes a mandatory, non-delegable duty on the regional presiding judge to personally address or refer recusal
motions, and that delegation of this responsibility to a court coordinator constitutes a clear abuse of discretion. There is no adequate remedy by appeal for such
procedural violations, as they undermine the fairness and impartiality of the proceedings. Mandamus is the appropriate remedy to compel compliance with Rule
18a and related statutes, as established by a consistent line of Texas Supreme Court and Court of Appeals decisions. The user has a solid basis for seeking
mandamus relief to protect the integrity of the judicial process and ensure strict adherence to the procedural safeguards governing judicial recusal.
Legal Authorities
In re Amir-Sharif, NUMBER 13-19-00573-CV (Tex. App. Dec 12, 2019)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Mandamus is an extraordinary remedy issued at the discretion of the court. In re Garza, 544 S.W.3d 836, 840 (Tex. 2018) (orig. proceeding) (per curiam). To
obtain relief by writ of mandamus, a relator must establish that an underlying order is void or is a clear abuse of discretion and there is no adequate appellate
remedy. ... Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a(f)(1) governs the duties of the respondent judge when a party files a motion to recuse. ... Rule 18a's
recusal-or-referral requirement is mandatory, and mandamus relief is appropriate to compel compliance with the rule. ... The respondent judge abused her
discretion by failing to recuse or refer and relator lacks an adequate remedy by appeal.
Summary
Mandatory nature of Rule 18a(f)(1), which requires a judge to either recuse themselves or refer the motion to the regional presiding judge. The failure to do so
constitutes an abuse of discretion, and mandamus relief is appropriate to compel compliance. The passage also highlights that there is no adequate remedy by
appeal when a judge fails to act on a recusal motion, supporting the need for mandamus relief to ensure procedural compliance and protect the integrity of the
judicial process.
De Leon v. Aguilar, 127 S.W.3d 1 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004)
Texas Court of Criminal Appeals
Extract
When a recusal motion is timely filed, Rule 18a leaves a trial judge with no discretion—the trial judge must either recuse himself or refer the motion for another
judge to decide. See Rule 18a(c). Any criminal cases to the contrary such as McClenan are overruled. Rule 18a does not contemplate that a trial judge whose
impartiality is questioned can nevertheless determine whether the allegations of bias against him state sufficient grounds for recusal.
Summary
The passage clearly states that Rule 18a requires a trial judge to either recuse themselves or refer the motion to another judge when a recusal motion is filed.
This aligns with the proposition that the regional presiding judge's failure to personally address or refer recusal motions is a violation of Rule 18a. The passage
also indicates that any discretion by the judge in this matter is not allowed, supporting the argument that such actions constitute a clear abuse of discretion. The
reference to overruling previous cases that allowed for discretion further strengthens the argument for mandamus relief to ensure compliance with Rule 18a.
In re PG & E Reata Energy, et al, 4 S.W.3d 897 (Tex. App. 1999)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Recusal is governed by Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a, which requires the judge against whom a proper recusal motion is filed to either grant the motion or
request the Presiding Judge to assign another judge to hear the motion. TEX. R. CIV. P. 18a(c)... A trial court has no 'discretion' in determining what the law is or
applying the law to the facts. Walker, 827 S.W.2d at 840. Thus, a clear failure by a trial court to analyze or apply the law correctly will constitute an abuse of
discretion, and may result in appellate reversal by extraordinary writ... The procedures governing recusal are designed to address concerns of judicial fairness
and impartiality, goals which are undermined by any practice that short-circuits the mandatory procedures... The mandatory provisions of rule 18a are rendered
meaningless if, following recusal and assignment by the regional presiding judge, a local administrative judge may simply override the presiding judge's orders by
transferring the case to a court (and judge) of his own choosing.
Summary
The passage emphasizes the mandatory nature of Rule 18a, which requires specific actions by judges when a recusal motion is filed. It highlights that any
deviation from these procedures, such as a judge failing to refer the motion to the presiding judge, constitutes an abuse of discretion. The passage also
underscores the importance of these procedures in maintaining judicial fairness and impartiality. The reference to mandamus relief as a remedy for such abuses
supports the proposition that improper handling of recusal motions can be addressed through extraordinary writs.
Monroe v. Blackmon, 946 S.W.2d 533 (Tex. App. 1997)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The only instances in which mandamus has been found to be appropriate to review action on a motion to recuse is where the challenged judge fails to comply
with his duty under Rule of Civil Procedure 18a(c) & (d) to either recuse himself or refer the motion. When the motion has not been referred for a hearing to the
administrative judge or another judge designated by him, the movant has not had an opportunity to develop a record on his recusal motion, and, without a record,
he has no adequate remedy by appeal. Winfield v. Daggett, 846 S.W.2d 920, 922 (Tex.App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 1993, orig. proceeding). The failure to refer may
be reviewed by mandamus.
Summary
Mandamus relief is appropriate when a judge fails to comply with Rule 18a(c) & (d) by not recusing themselves or referring the motion for recusal. This failure
prevents the development of a record, which is necessary for an adequate remedy by appeal. This directly supports the proposition that the regional presiding
judge's failure to address or refer recusal motions is a clear abuse of discretion warranting mandamus relief.
Ex Parte Ellis, 275 S.W.3d 109 (Tex. App. 2008)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The language of our rules is clear and straightforward: the grounds for recusal of an appellate justice or judge are the same as those provided in the rules of civil
procedure. Tex.R.App. P. 16.2. Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18b provides that '[a] judge shall recuse himself in any proceeding in which ... his impartiality might
reasonably be questioned.' Tex.R. Civ. P. 18b(2)(a). This language is mandatory, and the standard is objective, not subjective. Id. It calls upon the judge—in the
first instance—to assess his impartiality. A reasonable doubt is resolved in favor of recusal.
Summary
The passage emphasizes the mandatory nature of the recusal rules under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18b, which requires a judge to recuse themselves if their
impartiality might reasonably be questioned. This supports the proposition that the improper handling of recusal motions affects the fairness and impartiality of
proceedings. The passage also highlights the objective standard for assessing impartiality, reinforcing the need for strict compliance with recusal procedures. This
aligns with the proposition that mandamus relief is necessary to ensure compliance with Rule 18a and protect judicial integrity.
In re Norman, 191 S.W.3d 858 (Tex. App. 2006)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Denial of a motion to recuse is appealable upon final judgment. TEX.R. CIV. P. 18a(f). Thus, a relator challenging the denial of a recusal motion ordinarily has an
adequate remedy by appeal of the denial of a motion to recuse. However, mandamus relief is available when a judge violates a mandatory statutory duty either to
recuse or refer a motion to recuse. McLeod v. Harris, 582 S.W.2d 772, 775 (Tex.1979); In re Healthmark Partners, L.L.C., No. 14-04-00743-CV, 2004 WL
1899953, at *1 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.], Aug. 26, 2004, orig. proceeding) (mem.op). Under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a, Judge Austin had a
mandatory duty either to recuse himself or to refer the recusal motion to the presiding judge. TEX.R. CIV. P. 18a. Furthermore, section 74.059(c)(3) of the
Government Code states that a district, statutory probate, or statutory county court judge shall 'request the presiding judge to assign another judge to hear a
motion relating to the recusal of the judge from a case pending in his court.' TEX. GOV'T CODE ANN. § 74.059(c)(3) (Vernon 2005).

Summary
The passage highlights that while denial of a recusal motion is typically appealable, mandamus relief is appropriate when a judge fails to comply with the
mandatory duty to either recuse or refer the motion. This supports the proposition that improper handling of recusal motions, such as failing to personally address
or refer them, constitutes an abuse of discretion warranting mandamus relief. The passage underscores the importance of adhering to procedural rules to
maintain the integrity of the judicial process.
Rio Grande Valley Gas Co., In re, 987 S.W.2d 167 (Tex. App. 1999)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
When a motion to recuse has been filed, a judge must either recuse him- or herself or request the presiding administrative judge to assign another judge to hear
the motion. ... Any order other than an order of recusal or referral, entered by a court after a proper motion to recuse is entered is void. ... Rule 18a(c) requires a
judge to either recuse himself or request the presiding judge to assign a judge to hear a recusal motion 'prior to any further proceedings in the case.'
Summary
Mandatory procedures under Rule 18a for handling recusal motions, emphasizing that a judge must either recuse themselves or request the presiding judge to
assign another judge to hear the motion. It also states that any order other than recusal or referral is void if entered after a proper motion to recuse. This supports
the proposition that the regional presiding judge's failure to personally address or refer recusal motions is a violation of Rule 18a, constituting a clear abuse of
discretion. The passage further implies that such violations can affect the fairness and impartiality of proceedings, justifying mandamus relief to ensure
compliance with procedural rules.
Carson v. Gomez, 841 S.W.2d 491 (Tex. App. 1992)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Appellant asserts the trial judge was without jurisdiction to dismiss. Once a motion to recuse has been filed, the trial judge has only two options, recusal or
referral. TEX.R.CIV.P. 18a(c). Rule 18a(d) provides: If the judge declines to recuse himself, he shall forward to the presiding judge of the administrative judicial
district, in either original form or certified copy, an order of referral, the motion, and all opposing and concurring statements. Except for good cause stated in the
order in which further action is taken, the judge shall make no further orders and shall take no further action in the case after filing of the motion and prior to a
hearing on the motion. TEX.R.CIV.P. 18a(d). ... Even if the motion were procedurally defective, the trial judge should have referred the motion so that another
judge would make that determination. The Dallas Court of Appeals has held that 'a recusal motion invokes both statute and rule the instant the motion is filed and
the judge named in the motion shall recuse or refer without regard to the 'procedural sufficiency' of the motion itself.'
Summary
The passage emphasizes the mandatory nature of Rule 18a, which requires a judge to either recuse themselves or refer the motion to the presiding judge of the
administrative judicial district. This supports the proposition that the regional presiding judge's failure to personally address or refer recusal motions, as required
by Rule 18a, constitutes a clear abuse of discretion. The passage also highlights that procedural defects in the motion do not negate the requirement to refer,
reinforcing the need for compliance with Rule 18a to protect the integrity of the judicial process.
Jamilah v. Bass, 862 S.W.2d 201 (Tex. App. 1993)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Relator's motion for recusal sought the have Judge Bass either recuse himself or forward the case to the presiding judge of Brazoria County... This court has
previously held that the procedural requirements of Rule 18a are mandatory and a party who fails to comply with them waives the right to complain of a judge's
failure to recuse himself... On these facts, we hold the trial judge had but two options: to recuse himself or refer the case to the presiding judge. TEX.R.CIV.P.
18a(c)... We conditionally grant the petition for writ of mandamus.
Summary
The passage emphasizes the mandatory nature of Rule 18a, which requires a judge to either recuse themselves or refer the recusal motion to the presiding
judge. The court's decision to conditionally grant mandamus relief underscores the importance of adhering to these procedural requirements. This supports the
proposition that improper handling of recusal motions, such as failing to personally address or refer them, constitutes a clear abuse of discretion that warrants
mandamus relief.

Gaines v. Gaines, 677 S.W.2d 727 (Tex. App. 1984)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Article 200a, section 6 provides, in part, that: A district judge shall request the Presiding Judge to assign a judge of the Administrative District to hear any motions
to recuse such district judge from a case pending in his court. TEX.REV.CIV.STAT.ANN. art. 200a, § 6 (Vernon 1977). In McLeod v. Harris, 582 S.W.2d 772
(Tex.1979), it was held that under the express terms of Article 200a, § 6, the trial judge had a mandatory duty to request the presiding judge to assign another
district judge to hear the motion to recuse.
Summary
The passage highlights the mandatory duty of a trial judge to request the presiding judge to assign another district judge to hear a recusal motion, as per Article
200a, § 6. This supports the proposition that the regional presiding judge must personally address or refer recusal motions, aligning with Rule 18a requirements.
The failure to do so could be seen as a clear abuse of discretion, justifying mandamus relief to ensure compliance with procedural rules and protect the integrity
of the judicial process.
Sanchez v. State, 926 S.W.2d 391 (Tex. App. 1996)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
We note as a threshold matter that TEX.R.CIV.P. 18a applies to recusal matters in criminal cases absent a legislative declaration to the contrary. Arnold v. State,
853 S.W.2d 543, 544 (Tex.Crim.App.1993). Rule 18a and the case law interpreting it apply here. ... Where an appellate court finds that the trial court erred in
failing to have a hearing on a motion to recuse, the proper remedy is to abate the appeal and order the administrative judge of the judicial region to hear, or
assign another judge to hear, the recusal motion.
Summary
The passage confirms that Rule 18a applies to recusal matters and that the failure to conduct a hearing on a recusal motion is an error that requires remedy. The
appropriate remedy is to abate the appeal and have the recusal motion heard by the administrative judge or an assigned judge. This supports the proposition that
improper handling of recusal motions affects the fairness of proceedings and that mandamus relief is appropriate to ensure compliance with Rule 18a.
In re Lucio, 702-03, WR-72 (Tex. Crim. App. Apr 25, 2022)
Texas Court of Criminal Appeals
Extract
In her mandamus petition, Relator asserts that she has filed a motion to recuse or disqualify Respondent, but Respondent has failed to timely rule on the motion
as Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a requires.[] Because Respondent has refused to rule on the motion or refer it to the regional presiding judge, Relator
contends, this Court should compel Respondent to act in accordance with Rule 18a... A relator is entitled to mandamus relief against a trial court when (1) the
relator has no other adequate legal remedy and, (2) the act sought to be compelled is purely ministerial... Thus, Relator has shown that the act sought to be
compelled is purely ministerial... Therefore, we find that it is not an adequate remedy at law and Relator has no other adequate remedy at this time.
Consequently, we conditionally grant mandamus relief.
Summary
The passage discusses a situation where a judge failed to rule on or refer a recusal motion as required by Rule 18a. The court found that the relator had no
adequate remedy at law and that the act sought to be compelled was purely ministerial, thus justifying mandamus relief. This supports the proposition that
improper handling of recusal motions can warrant mandamus relief to ensure compliance with procedural rules and protect the integrity of the judicial process.
Brosseau v. Ranzau, 28 S.W.3d 235 (Tex. App. 2000)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
This Court has previously held that a trial judge, when presented with a recusal motion, regardless of the 'procedural sufficiency' of that motion, has only the
option to act in one of two specified ways: to recuse himself, or refer the case to the presiding judge. ... By pursuing an option unavailable through any rule or
statute, the court abused its discretion as a matter of law.
Summary

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
The passage from "Brosseau v. Ranzau" emphasizes that a trial judge has only two options when faced with a recusal motion: to recuse themselves or to refer
the case to the presiding judge. This aligns with the proposition that the regional presiding judge's failure to personally address or refer recusal motions
constitutes an abuse of discretion. The passage supports the idea that any deviation from these prescribed actions is a violation of procedural rules, which can
affect the fairness and impartiality of the proceedings. Therefore, mandamus relief is appropriate to address such violations and ensure compliance with Rule
18a.
Bruno v. State, 916 S.W.2d 4 (Tex. App. 1995)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Appellant argues that once a recusal motion is filed, a judge must recuse himself or herself or refer the case to the presiding judge of the administrative district.
As support, appellant cites both TEX.GOV'T CODE ANN. § 74.059(c)(3) and TEX.R.CIV.P. 18a. ... Rule 18a addresses the requirements of a motion for recusal
or disqualification of trial court judges. ... (c) Prior to any further proceedings in the case, the judge shall either recuse himself or request the presiding judge of the
administrative judicial district to assign a judge to hear such motion. ... We emphasize that if this motion had been verified and timely filed, the trial judge would
have been required either to recuse himself or to refer the recusal motion to the presiding judge of the administrative region for assignment to another judge for
hearing and disposition.
Summary
The passage emphasizes the procedural requirements under Rule 18a, which mandates that a judge must either recuse themselves or refer the recusal motion to
the presiding judge of the administrative district. This supports the proposition that the regional presiding judge's failure to personally address or refer recusal
motions, as required by Rule 18a, constitutes a clear abuse of discretion. The passage also highlights the importance of compliance with procedural rules to
ensure fairness and impartiality, aligning with the need for mandamus relief to compel compliance and protect the integrity of the judicial process.
In re Alpert, 276 S.W.3d 592 (Tex. App. 2008)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Mandamus relief is available to correct a 'clear abuse of discretion' when no adequate remedy by appeal exists. Walker v. Packer, 827 S.W.2d 833, 839
(Tex.1992) (orig. proceeding). Mandamus is proper if a trial court issues an order beyond its jurisdiction. In re Sw. Bell Tel. Co., 35 S.W.3d 602, 605 (Tex.2000)
(orig. proceeding). Cases involving void orders present a circumstance warranting mandamus relief. In re Dickason, 987 S.W.2d 570, 571 (Tex.1998) (orig.
proceeding). A trial court has a ministerial duty to consider and rule on motions properly filed and pending before the court and mandamus may issue to compel
the judge to act when a judge has refused to do so.
Summary
Mandamus relief is appropriate to correct a clear abuse of discretion when no adequate remedy by appeal exists. It emphasizes that mandamus is proper if a trial
court issues an order beyond its jurisdiction or fails to act on motions properly filed and pending before it. This supports the proposition that improper handling of
recusal motions, which affects the fairness and impartiality of proceedings, can warrant mandamus relief to ensure compliance with procedural rules like Rule
18a.
Hudson v. Texas Children's Hosp., 177 S.W.3d 232 (Tex. 2005)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
Once a motion to recuse is filed in statutory probate court, the trial judge has two options before taking any other action: (1) recuse himself or (2) request that the
presiding judge of the statutory probate courts assign a judge to hear the motion to recuse. Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 25.00255(f) (Vernon 2004); TEX.R. CIV. P.
18a(c). The Texas Supreme Court has held that the recuse or refer procedure is mandatory. See McLeod v. Harris, 582 S.W.2d 772, 774 (Tex.1979). ... We hold
that the trial judge erred when he did not follow the mandatory requirements either to recuse himself or to refer the motion to recuse to the presiding judge of the
statutory probate courts and instead denied the motion to recuse.
Summary
The Texas Supreme Court has emphasized the mandatory nature of the recuse or refer procedure under Rule 18a. The court held that a trial judge must either
recuse themselves or refer the motion to the presiding judge, and failure to do so constitutes an error. This supports the proposition that improper handling of
recusal motions, such as not following the mandatory procedure, affects the fairness and impartiality of proceedings and warrants mandamus relief to ensure
compliance with procedural rules.

Winfield v. Daggett, 846 S.W.2d 920 (Tex. App. 1993)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Winfield asserts Judge Daggett violated his clear duty under rule 18a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure and abused his discretion in not recusing himself or
referring the motion to the presiding judge of the Second Administrative Judicial District. ... Mandamus issues to correct a clear abuse of discretion or the violation
of a duty imposed by law when there is no other adequate remedy by law. ... Both rule 18a and TEX.GOV'T CODE ANN. § 74.059(c)(3) (Vernon 1988) make it
clear that once Judge Daggett refused to recuse himself, he had a duty to forward the motion to the presiding judge of the administrative judicial district. He
refused to do so. Thus, he violated a duty imposed upon him by law.
Summary
The passage from "Winfield v. Daggett" highlights a situation where a judge failed to comply with Rule 18a by not referring a recusal motion to the presiding
judge, which constitutes a violation of a legal duty. The passage supports the proposition by illustrating that such failures can be addressed through mandamus
relief, as there is no adequate remedy by appeal. This aligns with the proposition's assertion that mandamus relief is necessary to ensure compliance with
procedural rules governing recusal and to protect the integrity of the judicial process.
McLeod v. Harris, 582 S.W.2d 772 (Tex. 1979)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
The question presented here is whether respondent, Honorable Edward J. Harris, Judge of the 10th Judicial District Court of Galveston County, is required by the
provisions of Article 200a, Section 6 to request the Presiding Judge of the Second Administrative District to hear relator's motion to recuse Judge Harris... We
conclude that under the express terms of Article 200a, Section 6, Judge Harris had the mandatory duty to request the Presiding Judge of the Second
Administrative District to assign another district judge to hear relator's motion to recuse... In the event he fails to do so, a writ of mandamus will issue.
Summary
The passage from "McLeod v. Harris" establishes that a judge has a mandatory duty to request the presiding judge to assign another judge to hear a recusal
motion. This aligns with the proposition that the regional presiding judge must personally address or refer recusal motions, as required by procedural rules. The
failure to do so can result in mandamus relief, as it constitutes a clear abuse of discretion. The case supports the idea that mandamus relief is appropriate to
ensure compliance with procedural rules governing recusal.

pending cause as justice may require.
Summary
The regional presiding judge is required to personally set a hearing for recusal or disqualification motions and ensure that notice is given to all parties. This aligns
with the proposition that the regional presiding judge must comply with procedural rules governing recusal, and any deviation from this requirement could be seen
as an abuse of discretion. The passage supports the need for mandamus relief to ensure compliance with these procedural rules.

Extract
When a motion for disqualification or recusal is timely filed, before any further proceedings in the case, the judge must recuse himself or herself or request the
presiding judge of the judicial district to assign a judge to hear the recusal motion. [TRCP 18a(c).] It is improper for the sitting judge to take any further action on
the case until the recusal motion has been heard. [Jamilah v. Bass, 862 SW2d 201 (TexApp — Houston [14th Dist] 1993, orig proc) (trial judge improperly held
contempt hearing after motion for recusal was filed and held attorney who filed the motion in contempt).]

When a recusal motion is filed, the trial judge against whom the motion is directed may properly make an initial decision of whether the motion is sufficient to
invoke Rule 18a. See Arnold (no error in not referring motion to recuse not timely filed); McDuffie v. State, 854 S.W.2d 195 (Tex.App.— Beaumont 1993, pet.
ref’d). Once a sufficient motion to recuse has been filed, before proceeding further in the case, the judge must either recuse himself or request the presiding judge
of the administrative judicial district to assign a judge to hear the motion under Tex. Gov’t Code §74.059(c)(3). Sanchez. If a recusal motion is timely filed and
facially sufficient, a hearing must be held. Sanchez.
