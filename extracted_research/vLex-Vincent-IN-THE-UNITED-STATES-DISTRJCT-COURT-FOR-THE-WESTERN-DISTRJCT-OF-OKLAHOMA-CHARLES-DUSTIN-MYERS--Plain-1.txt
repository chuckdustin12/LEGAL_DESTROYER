IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRJCT COURT FOR THE WESTERN DISTRJCT
OF OKLAHOMA CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, Plaintiff, vs. DANIEL
KENNETH BRANTHOOVER & MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS
Defendant. ) ) ) ) Case No. CIV-24-1311-R ) ) ) ) DEFENDANT'S MOTION TO
DISMISS FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT COMES NOW Defendant, Daniel
Kenneth Branthoover and Morgan Michelle Myers, pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6)
and Rule 12(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and respectfully
moves this Court to dismiss Plaintiffs First Amended Complaint for failure to
state a claim upon which relief can be granted and for improper venue. In
support thereof, Defendant submits the following Memorandum of Law.
MEMORANDUM OF LAW 1. Plaintiffs First Amended Complaint fails to
allege facts sufficient to support a claim under the Racketeer Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations Act (RJCO), 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961-1968. 1 2. The
Complaint lacks the necessary elements of a RICO claim, including a valid
enterprise, a pattern of racketeering activity, and specific predicate acts. 3.
Plaintiff's allegations are conclusory and speculative, and do not meet the
pleading standards required under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a) and
the Supreme Court's decisions in Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S.
544 (2007), and Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662 (2009). 4. Venue is improper
in the Western District of Oklahoma under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b), as the events
giving rise to the claims occurred primarily outside this district. 5. Failure to
Plead Fraud with Particularity (Rule 9(b)) Plaintiffs allegations of wire fraud,
which form the basis of the alleged RICO predicate acts, fail to meet the
heightened pleading standard of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b ). The
Complaint does not specify the time, place, or content of the alleged
fraudulent communications, nor does it identify the specific roles of each
Defendant in the purported scheme. See Tal v. Hogan, 453 F.3d 1244, 1263
(10th Cir. 2006). 6. Improper Use of Domestic Dispute as Basis for RICO
Plaintiff's allegations arise primarily from a domestic dispute and related
family court proceedings. Courts have consistently held that such disputes
do not constitute the type of organized criminal activity contemplated by
RICO. See Annulli v. Panikkar, 200 F.3d 189, 200 (3d Cir. 1999) (holding that
'garden-variety state law fraud' and domestic disputes are not actionable
under RICO). 2 7. No Standing Under RICO Plaintiff lacks standing to bring
a RICO claim because he has not alleged a concrete injury to business or
property as required under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c). Allegations of emotional
distress, reputational harm, or speculative business losses are insufficient.
See Holmes v. Sec. Investor Prot. Corp., 503 U.S. 258, 268 (1992). 8. Plaintiff
fails to allege continuity ofracketeering activity as required under 18 U.S.C.
§ 1961(5). The alleged conduct spans a short period and does not
demonstrate a threat of ongoing criminal activity. See H.J. Inc. v.
Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 241-42 (1989). 9. Accordingly, the
Complaint should be dismissed in its entirety. WHEREFORE, Defendant
respectfully requests that the Court grant this Motion and dismiss Plaintiffs
First Amended Complaint with prejudice, and for such other relief as the
Court deems just and proper. Respectfully sub -- ~ Daniel Kenn~ver 3100

OKLAHOMA CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, Plaintiff, v. DANIEL KENNETH
BRANTHOOVER & MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS Defendants § § § § § § Case
No. CIV-24-1311-R§ § § § FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT Plaintiff Charles
Dustin Myers, representing himself pro-se and proceeding in forma pauperis
respectfully files this First Amended Complaint against Daniel Kenneth
Branthoover and Morgan Michelle Myers. The original complaint filed on
December 16, 2024, is respectfully amended to incorporate Morgan
Michelle Myers as an additional defendant and Plaintiff has provided this
Court with the necessary materials to effectuate service prior to the July 11
deadline, as extended by this court pursuant to its recent order issued on
June 11, 2025.1 1 See Doc 15. 2 I. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 1. This
Honorable Court possesses subject matter jurisdiction over this action
pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331, as Plaintiff’s claims arise under the laws of the
United States, specifically the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c) and § 1964(d), which explicitly
grants federal courts jurisdiction over civil RICO actions. Further,
jurisdiction is established under 18 U.S.C. § 1965, which provides for
nationwide service of process and jurisdiction in RICO actions, thereby
ensuring that all Defendants, regardless of their physical location within the
United States, are subject to the jurisdiction of this Court. 2. Venue is proper
in the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma
pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 1965(a) and 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b). A substantial part of
the events or omissions giving rise to the claims asserted herein occurred
within this District. 3. Additionally, “any person injured in his business or
property by reason of a violation of section 1962…may sue therefor in any
appropriate United States district court and shall recover threefold the
damages he sustains and the cost of the suit, including a reasonable
attorney’s fee…” 18 U.S.C § 1964. Plaintiff alleges to have a direct and
ongoing injury to his business and property as a result from the alleged
predicate acts herein. 3 II. PARTIES A. Identification 4. Plaintiff Charles
Dustin Myers, referred to herein as “Plaintiff”, is a natural person and a
resident of the State of Texas and is legally domiciled in Tarrant County. 5.
Defendant Daniel Kenneth Branthoover, referred to herein as “Branthoover”,
is a natural person and a resident of the state of Oklahoma and is domiciled
in Canadian County. 6. Defendant Morgan Michelle Myers, referred to
herein as “Myers”, is a natural person, and a resident of the State of Texas
and is legally domiciled in Tarrant County. 7. Collectively, Branthoover and
Myers are referred to herein as “the Defendants”. B. Representation 8.
Plaintiff is representing himself in this matter. 9. Myers is believed to be self-
represented at this time. 10. Branthoover is believed to be self-represented
at this time. 4 III. PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 11. At the heart of this
litigation lies a deliberate and orchestrated scheme by Defendants Morgan
Michelle Myers and Daniel Kenneth Branthoover, who strategically chose to
displace Plaintiff from his home and destabilize his financial and familial
security. Branthoover administered and Myers meticulously executed a
calculated plan involving interstate travel, fraudulent affidavits, deliberate
perjury, asset diversion, and systematic manipulation of multiple Texas state
courts to escape accountability for her actions. 12. To carry out this scheme,
Myers enlisted the assistance of Daniel Kenneth Branthoover, a resident of
Yukon Oklahoma, who has a prior history regarding violations of protective
orders and tampering with government documents. For no other reason than
to escape accountability for her affair, Myers spun an elaborate web of lies

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
and weaponized her family and court procedures designed to help victims of
abuse. 13. What emerges from the evidence is not a domestic dispute gone
awry, but a textbook criminal enterprise created within this Court’s
Jurisdiction. This is the story of how a person corruptly influenced the very
courts designed to protect families—transforming them into instruments of
fraud, extortion, and systematic theft. It is a tale of how two individuals,
connected by a common goal, orchestrated a seventeen-month reign of
terror that began in Oklahoma and was carried out in the Texas courts. 14.
The Defendants did not merely lie to courts—they constructed an elaborate
criminal enterprise with defined roles, coordinated operations, and a
singular mission: to strip Plaintiff of everything he held dear through the
systematic corruption of judicial 5 proceedings. They engaged in laundering
funds across state lines while concurrently submitting fraudulent indigency
claims. They did not just fabricate allegations—they manufactured an entire
false narrative of domestic violence, complete with non-existent protective
orders and imaginary threats, all while the supposed "victim" continued to
share a bed with her alleged "abuser." 15. This case shows how the family
court system can be perverted by those willing to commit federal crimes to
achieve their goals. It reveals how easily the sacred trust placed in sworn
affidavits can be shattered by defendants who view perjury not as a crime,
but as a tool. Most importantly, it demonstrates that when domestic
relations become the vehicle for interstate racketeering, federal intervention
is not just appropriate—it is essential. 16. This is not a story about a
marriage that failed. This is simply the product of a litigant who values her
extramarital relationships over morality, and who chose to weaponize her
family against Plaintiff for the sole purpose of escaping accountability. 17.
After extensive research and vigorous advocacy, Plaintiff asserts that
Defendants engaged in racketeering activity through an organized
enterprise, seeking relief to prevent its finalization. Against all odds, and in
support of this preliminary statement, Plaintiff alleges the following: 6 IV.
FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS A. Enterprise Formation and Initial Criminal
Coordination (December 14-15, 2023) 18. Defendant Branthoover possesses
extensive knowledge of protective order procedures and requirements due
to his prior criminal convictions involving violations of such orders. This
knowledge would prove instrumental in the enterprise's systematic
manipulation of protective order proceedings. 19. On December 14, 2023,
immediately following Plaintiff's discovery of Defendant Myers' extramarital
affair, she initiated the criminal enterprise by taking two coordinated
actions: first, she opened a private bank account in her sole name to
facilitate asset concealment; and second, she commenced intensive
interstate communications with Defendant Branthoover via text messaging.
The scope and intensity of these communications—totaling 92 text messages
exchanged between Branthoover's registered number 940-312-3434 and
Myers' registered number 817-235-5189 on this single day—demonstrates
the deliberate and coordinated nature of their criminal planning. 20. While
coordinating with Branthoover, Defendant Myers tried to secure an ex-parte
protective order against Plaintiff, without legitimate cause. This action
marks the enterprise's first attempt to manipulate judicial proceedings
through false allegations. 21. Despite having just sought emergency
protection from Plaintiff hours earlier, Myers casually reminded him of their
child's school field trip scheduled for the following day, thereby creating a
facade of normalcy designed to conceal her fraudulent intentions and

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
prevent suspicion of the enterprise's activities. 7 B. Interstate Criminal
Coordination and Financial Crimes (December 15-16, 2023) 22. On
December 15, 2023, at precisely 9:51 A.M. CST, Defendant Branthoover
contacted Plaintiff directly, employing calculated deception by stating, "I've
been where you are before. I want to help both of you." This communication,
referencing Myers' December 1, 2023 divorce announcement, was designed
to establish false pretenses for Myers' planned interstate travel to Oklahoma
for criminal coordination purposes. 23. During this deceptive phone
conversation, Branthoover established the operational framework for the
next phase of the criminal scheme by arranging for Myers to visit his
Oklahoma residence over the weekend of December 15, 2023. The stated
purpose—"providing space" to Myers—was a deliberate misrepresentation
designed to conceal the true criminal purpose of coordinating fraudulent
document preparation and enterprise operations. 24. Having no reason to
suspect Branthoover's dishonest intentions, Plaintiff unwittingly facilitated
the enterprise's criminal coordination by agreeing to Myers' travel to
Oklahoma. 25. Immediately following Branthoover's deceptive phone call,
the enterprise executed its first major financial crime. Plaintiff received
notification that Myers had transferred $1,576 from the parties' joint marital
PNC account to Branthoover's PayPal account (username "dmb575"),
completely depleting the account balance. This interstate wire transfer
represents a critical predicate act, utilizing interstate commerce to further
the criminal scheme while simultaneously depriving Plaintiff of operating
funds necessary for his legitimate business operations, household bills, and
Christmas gifts. 8 26. The immediate and devastating impact of this financial
crime became apparent on December 16, 2023, when Plaintiff received
notification that the joint marital PNC account was overdrawn by $800.00.
Concurrently, Plaintiff discovered that advertisements for his legitimate
home-based business had ceased running due to payment failure directly
caused by the enterprise's theft of operating funds. This demonstrates the
enterprise's deliberate intent to cause maximum financial harm to Plaintiff.
27. The criminal nature of this financial transaction is conclusively
established by documentary evidence. The PNC bank statement for
December 2023 provides irrefutable proof of the unauthorized withdrawal,
documenting the precise date, amount, and destination of the fraudulent
transfer. 28. The direct connection between Defendant Branthoover and this
financial crime is established through multiple forms of evidence. The PayPal
identifier "dmb575" appearing on Plaintiff's bank statement directly
corresponds to Branthoover's PayPal account, creating an unbreakable
evidentiary chain linking him to the illicit financial transaction, corroborated
by his own admissions in subsequent text communications. 29. On December
16, 2023, at precisely 3:54 P.M. CST, Plaintiff made a good-faith attempt to
resolve the situation amicably by sending a detailed text message to
Defendant Branthoover. This communication explicitly requested the return
of the fraudulently transferred $1,576, detailed the intended legitimate use
of these funds, described the financial hardship caused by the theft
(including late bills and business disruption), explained Plaintiff's inability to
work due to the severe emotional distress 9 caused by Defendants' criminal
actions, and expressed his sincere desire for an amicable resolution during
the holiday season. 30. Defendant Branthoover's response to this reasonable
request revealed the true criminal nature of the enterprise. In a callous and
dismissive reply, Branthoover stated, "You Are Getting Divorced..." followed

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
by, "I hope I can help with the paperwork and make things go as smoothly as
possible." Far from the helpful assistance initially promised, this
communication constituted a direct threat and overt act in furtherance of
the criminal conspiracy, demonstrating Branthoover's intent to exploit
Plaintiff's financial distress for the enterprise's benefit while utilizing
interstate communications to further the scheme. 31. This communication
also establishes Branthoover's unauthorized practice of law across state
lines. At no time relevant to this litigation has Defendant Branthoover
possessed a license to practice law in any jurisdiction within the United
States. His statements regarding "paperwork" and making legal proceedings
"go as smoothly as possible" constitute clear evidence of unauthorized legal
practice and demonstrate his administrative role in directing the
enterprise's criminal activities. C. Coordinated Eviction Attempt Fraud and
Interstate Document Transportation (December 17, 2023) 32. On December
17, 2023, at approximately 11:00 A.M., Plaintiff was served with an eviction
notice by the grandmother of Myers, who is also the landlord of the
matrimonial residence, which contained the following false information: i. A
purported “lease violation,” which was entirely fabricated as no 10 valid
lease agreement existed between Plaintiff and Wilson; ii. The assertion that
“Granddaughter getting divorced,” referring to Defendant Myers, as a basis
for eviction; iii. The false claim that a “Protective order has been filed.” iv.
The directive that “He must leave. She and the girls may stay,”
demonstrating the clear intent to dispossess Plaintiff for the benefit of
Myers. 33. The coordinated and premeditated nature of this eviction fraud is
established by the timing of its execution. At the precise moment this
fraudulent notice was being served in Texas, Defendant Myers was
physically present in Oklahoma with Defendant Branthoover, actively
collaborating in the preparation of the very fraudulent court documents
referenced in the eviction notice. 34. Myers' knowledge of the fraudulent
nature of the eviction attempt is conclusively established. She possessed
actual knowledge that no valid lease agreement existed, and she had actual
knowledge that neither divorce proceedings nor protective orders had been
filed at the time of service, making her participation in the eviction fraud a
knowing and willful criminal act. 35. On December 17, 2023, Defendant
Myers completed the interstate transportation phase of the criminal scheme
by transporting the fraudulent court documents prepared in Oklahoma back
across state lines to Texas. These documents, including the Original Petition
for Divorce and Affidavit of Indigency, were specifically 11 prepared with the
intent of submitting them to Texas state courts to further the enterprise's
fraudulent manipulation of judicial proceedings. 36. Upon her return to
Texas, Myers demonstrated her control over the eviction fraud by personally
destroying the fraudulent eviction notice. She physically tore the notice in
half and wrote "VOID" on it in black marker, providing clear evidence of her
influence over and coordination of the fraudulent eviction attempt
orchestrated during her absence in Oklahoma. D. Operational Security and
Document Preparation (December 17-18, 2023) 37. As part of the
enterprise's operational security measures, Defendant Myers returned from
Oklahoma equipped with a canister of pepper spray, designed to support the
false narrative of domestic violence that would be central to the fraudulent
court documents prepared during her Oklahoma visit. 38. During her
Oklahoma visit, Defendant Myers acquired a secondary phone number
(817-940-0852) as a deliberate operational security measure. This

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
acquisition, which she explicitly disclosed to Plaintiff, constituted an overt
act in furtherance of the criminal enterprise, designed to facilitate
clandestine communications related to the fraudulent scheme while
concealing the enterprise's ongoing criminal coordination from detection.
39. This newly acquired secondary phone number became an integral
component of the fraudulent court documents prepared under Defendant
Branthoover's direct administrative oversight. The systematic use of this
number across multiple fraudulent legal documents demonstrates the
coordinated nature of the enterprise's document 12 preparation activities.
These documents, prepared in Oklahoma with the specific intent of
unlawfully influencing Texas legal proceedings, included: i. An "Original
Petition for Divorce" dated December 18, 2023, containing numerous
material false statements designed to deceive the Texas courts; ii. An
"Affidavit of Indigency" dated December 18, 2023, containing deliberate
misrepresentations regarding Myers' financial status to defraud the court of
legitimate filing fees; iii. A "Request for Uncontested Cases" dated
December 18, 2023, fraudulently filed despite the complete absence of any
communication between the parties regarding divorce proceedings; iv. An
"Application for Protective Order" dated December 22, 2023, containing
entirely fabricated allegations of family violence. E. Unauthorized Practice
of Law and Intimidation (December 18, 2023) 42. 40. Following the filing of
the initial fraudulent divorce documents on December 18, 2023, Defendant
Branthoover escalated his unauthorized practice of law by sending Plaintiff a
text message asserting legal representation and attempting to control all
future communications. The message stated: “Charlie, it’s come to my
understanding you have retained an attorney. I’m sure he has told you that
all further communication should take place between attorneys. I must
formally ask you refrain from discussing details of this case with my client
moving forward and only communicate with me or your attorney.” 13 This
communication was a deliberate attempt to isolate Plaintiff from direct
communication with Myers and to control the flow of information, thereby
hindering Plaintiff’s ability to uncover the full extent of the fraudulent
scheme. This communication also evidences that Branthoover’s role went
beyond helping Myers prepare the documents by seeing them through to
their submission and asserting an administrative role over the proceedings
to intimidate Plaintiff. F. Service Through Official Channels and Continued
Deception (December 22-28, 2023) 41. In furtherance of the criminal
scheme, and despite continuing to cohabitate with Plaintiff in the marital
residence, Defendant Myers deliberately utilized official constable service to
effectuate service of the fraudulent divorce petition and protective order
application, which occurred on December 27, 2023. This calculated use of
official legal processes to serve fraudulent documents while maintaining the
deceptive facade of normalcy at home demonstrates the sophisticated and
deliberate nature of the enterprise's operations. 42. The enterprise's
manipulation of official legal processes continued when Myers, despite
residing next door to Plaintiff, deliberately influenced and coordinated the
constable service of the fraudulent eviction documents, which occurred on
December 28, 2023. This systematic abuse of official legal processes while
maintaining physical proximity and continued cohabitation reveals the
calculated and deceptive nature of the enterprise's operations. 14 G.
Systematic False Statements in Sworn Court Documents (December 18,
2023) 43. When reviewing the documents prepared in part by Branthoover

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
and filed with the court by Myers, there existed several false statements and
were intended to deceive the court and prejudice Plaintiff in furtherance of
the scheme to dispose him of his property interests. Specifically, these false
statements included, but were not limited to: i. The assertion that the
spouses had ceased living together on December 1, 2023, when in fact they
were still residing together at the marital home on that date and for several
weeks thereafter. ii. The claim that Defendant Myers owned both family
vehicles as her separate property prior to the marriage, which was
demonstrably false as these vehicles were acquired during the marriage and
constituted community property, paid for by Plaintiff. iii. The representation
that Defendant Myers had an active order of protection against Plaintiff with
a judicial finding that family violence had occurred during the marriage,
which was fabricated and without any basis in fact or law. iv. The assertion
that the children or Defendant Myers would be subjected to harassment or
abuse if Plaintiff were provided with her second phone number
(817-940-0852) acquired in Oklahoma, which was a baseless and
manipulative claim designed to conceal her communications related to the
fraudulent scheme. 15 44. Concurrently with the fraudulent divorce petition,
Defendant Myers, again with the administrative oversight and full
knowledge of Defendant Branthoover, filed a fraudulent “Affidavit of
Indigency” with the court. This affidavit contained material
misrepresentations regarding Defendant Myers’ financial status, all of which
were known to be false at the time of filing and were intended to defraud the
court and avoid legitimate court costs. Specifically, these false statements
included: i. The claim that Defendant Myers was financially indigent and
unable to pay court costs, despite her access to and control over substantial
marital assets. ii. The representation that Defendant Myers was solely
responsible for all family living expenses, including rent, utilities, food, and
other living expenses, when in fact, Plaintiff was the primary breadwinner of
the household at that time. iii. The assertion that Defendant Myers was
solely responsible for both car payments, which she has no payment history
to support such a claim. H. Escalation Through Fabricated Violence
Allegations (December 22, 2023) 45. On December 22, 2023, despite having
claimed in her divorce petition to already possess an active protective order,
Myers filed an "Application for Protective Order," revealing the
contradictory and fabricated nature of her previous representations while
escalating the enterprise's fraudulent manipulation of judicial proceedings.
16 46. Upon review, defendant Myers made additional false statements
within the sworn document, all intended to further deceive the court and
secure an unwarranted protective order against Plaintiff to effectuate the
enterprises’ goal of divesting him of his property interests. These false
statements included, but were not limited to: i. The claim that family
violence occurred on December 18, 2023, in the presence of the children,
which was entirely false and fabricated. ii. The assertion that family violence
occurred prior to December 18, 2023, which was also false and without any
factual basis. iii. The request that Plaintiff take a battering intervention
program. I. Achievement of Primary Criminal Objective (January 16, 2024)
47. On January 16, 2024, the enterprise's criminal scheme achieved its
primary objective when Plaintiff appeared before the 322nd District Court of
Tarrant County and was ordered to vacate the family residence.
Significantly, this order was entered without any evidentiary hearing and
without judicial findings regarding the allegations contained in the

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
fraudulent documents, demonstrating that the court's decision was based
entirely on the false information systematically presented by the
Defendants. 48. The causal relationship between the Defendant’s fraudulent
representations and this judicial outcome is conclusively established. The
misinformation presented to the court through the coordinated fraudulent
documents was the sole basis for the court's decision, providing Myers with
the exact advantage that she and Branthoover had anticipated and planned
through significant and intentional misrepresentations. 17 J. Ongoing
Pattern of Racketeering Activity and Continuity (January 2024 - Present) 49.
Between January 16, 2024, and the present day, Defendants Myers and
Branthoover have continued to further their racketeering activity through a
series of ongoing illicit acts, demonstrating a clear pattern of continuity and
relatedness. These acts include, but are not limited to: i. Myers and
Branthoover continuing to engage in interstate communications regarding
case details between one another across state lines, specifically between
Texas and Oklahoma, in direct furtherance of their fraudulent scheme to see
the divorce through to its finalization. ii. Branthoover delivering ongoing
threats and intimidation to Plaintiff regarding his legitimate attempts to
seek legal relief from the orders that were a product of the Defendants’
actions, which occurred in December of 2023, June of 2024, December of
2024, and May of 2025. iii. Making direct statements such as “I’ve been
enjoying watching every filing get denied” by Branthoover, showing the
malicious intent behind his involvement as Plaintiff sought relief for their
coordinated actions. 50. On June 23, 2024, Defendant Branthoover
continued his pattern of harassment and intimidation by sending Plaintiff a
text message stating, "Lol. And here comes 18 another denial," in direct
reference to Plaintiff's court filing seeking to enjoin Branthoover as a party
to the divorce proceedings. This communication provides conclusive
evidence of Branthoover's continued awareness of and active involvement in
the Texas legal proceedings, his ongoing monitoring of court filings, and his
malicious intent to mock and intimidate Plaintiff's efforts to seek justice
through legitimate legal channels. 51. On December 12, 2024, Branthoover
escalated his threatening communications by sending Plaintiff a message
stating, "When things all over you get to deal with me. Just a heads up,"
demonstrating the enterprise's ongoing criminal intent and explicit threats
of future retaliation against Plaintiff for his efforts to expose and seek relief
from their criminal activities. 52. Most recently, on May 24, 2025,
Branthoover sent Plaintiff a message stating, "Where's my lawsuit? Heard
your vm about me. File it. Let's do this :)" This communication demonstrates
the enterprise's continued operation, Branthoover's ongoing monitoring of
Plaintiff's activities, and his explicit challenge and threat regarding potential
legal action, providing clear evidence of the enterprise's ongoing criminal
intent and the continuing threat posed to Plaintiff. 53. As a direct result of
the actions outlined above, Plaintiff has sustained substantial injury to his
business and property. 54. Plaintiff now turns to discuss the elements of
RICO and the alleged predicate acts committed by the Defendants in this
matter. 19 V. INTRODUCTION TO RICO 55. Plaintiff realleges and
incorporates by reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through
54 above, as if fully set forth herein. 56. The Racketeer Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) requires proof of a "pattern of
racketeering activity," which the Supreme Court has consistently held
consists of two essential elements: relatedness and continuity of predicate

=== PAGE 9 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
acts. Based on the provided facts and the applicable law, the Defendants'
series of related acts spanning from December 2023 through May 2025
(approximately 18 months) satisfies both the relatedness requirement (as
the acts share similar purposes, participants, and methods) and the
continuity requirement (as they extend over a substantial period of time)
necessary to establish a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO as
explained in more detail below. 57. For there to be a pattern of racketeering
activity, there must be conduct committed by an enterprise that is prohibited
under 18 U.S.C. § 1961. In the instant matter, Defendants are alleged to
have committed several predicate acts, including wire fraud, violations of
the Travel Act, and perjury/subordination of perjury to support a pattern of
racketeering activity, as explained in more detail below. VI. PREDICATE ACT
– WIRE FRAUD (18 U.S.C. § 1343) 58. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by
reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 57 above, as if
fully set forth herein. 59. The relevant federal statutes in this analysis are 18
U.S.C. § 1343 (Wire Fraud) and 18 U.S.C. § 1961 (RICO Definitions). 20 60.
Title 18 U.S.C. § 1343 states: "Whoever, having devised or intending to
devise any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or property
by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises,
transmits or causes to be transmitted by means of wire, radio, or television
communication in interstate or foreign commerce, any writings, signs,
signals, pictures, or sounds for the purpose of executing such scheme or
artifice, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years,
or both." 61. The facts above establish all three elements of wire fraud
under 18 U.S.C. § 1343—a scheme to defraud, use of interstate wire
communications, and intent to deprive another of money or property—
qualifying it as a RICO predicate act under 18 U.S.C. § 1961. A. Scheme to
Defraud 62. The first element of wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343 is the
existence of "a scheme to defraud." As noted in United States v. Greenberg,
835 F.3d 295 (2nd Cir. 2016), this constitutes an "essential element" of the
crime. In the present case, Myers transferred $1,576 from a joint marital
PNC account to Branthoover's PayPal account, depleting the account
entirely. This transfer was not an isolated action but was accompanied by "a
series of coordinated text messages and phone calls" between Myers and
Branthoover regarding the scheme, and followed after a deceptive message
was sent from Branthoover to Plaintiff. 63. The coordination between the
parties through multiple communications channels demonstrates a
deliberate plan rather than a spontaneous or inadvertent action. As
articulated in Mail and Wire Fraud, a "scheme to defraud requires a material
falsehood, material misrepresentation, or the concealment of a material
fact." By 21 transferring funds from a joint marital account without apparent
authorization from the joint account holder, Myers engaged in conduct that
reflects the concealment of material facts regarding the disposition of
marital assets. 64. The scheme in this case specifically targeted marital
funds, and community property, which are legally considered shared
property between spouses. By depleting the account, Myers intentionally
deprived the Plaintiff of access to funds to which he was legally entitled.
This satisfies the requirement that the scheme have "money or property as
the object of the scheme" as stated in Smulley v. Fed. Hous. Fin. Agency,
17-2666 (2nd Cir. Oct 05, 2018). B. Use of Interstate Wire Communications
65. The second element of wire fraud requires the "use of the mails or wires
to further the scheme." United States v. Greenberg, 835 F.3d 295 (2nd Cir.

=== PAGE 10 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
2016). The facts demonstrate that Myers used interstate wire
communications in two distinct ways: i. The transfer of $1,576 was
"executed via interstate wire (bank to PayPal)," which constitutes an
electronic transmission across state lines. ii. The transfer "was accompanied
by a series of coordinated text messages and phone calls between Myers (in
Texas) and Branthoover (in Oklahoma) regarding the scheme." 66. Wire
transmissions include interstate telephone calls or electronic transmissions.
Furthermore, internet communications satisfy the interstate nexus 22
requirement, even in the absence of proof that a fraudulent communication
traveled through out-of-state servers. 67. The interstate nature of these
communications is established by the fact that Myers was in Texas while
Branthoover was in Oklahoma during their communications about the
scheme. This satisfies the jurisdictional requirement that the wire
communication cross state lines. C. Intend to Defraud 68. The third element
requires that the defendant acted "with the intent to defraud." As stated in
U.S. v. Blackmon, 839 F.2d 900 (2nd Cir. 1988), the wire fraud statute
requires that the defendant "be a party to some kind of scheme to defraud, a
requirement that includes a high degree of scienter and moral culpability."
69. Here, Branthoover specifically stated that he wanted to help Plaintiff,
which he knew was not a true statement at the time. The fact that text and
phone communications were used to deceive Plaintiff into believing that
Myers’ interstate travel would be beneficial for him further supports a
scheme to defraud, because the transfer of funds occurred after this false
extension of help from Branthoover. 70. In summary, the facts presented
establish all required elements of wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343,
qualifying it as a predicate act for RICO purposes under 18 U.S.C. § 1961,
committed by both Defendants. D. Potential Defenses 71. One potential
defense might be that Myers, as a joint account holder, had legal authority
to transfer funds from the account. However, this authority does not extend
to 23 depleting the account for personal gain in coordination with a third
party with the intent to deprive the other account holder of their rightful
access to the funds. The joint nature of the account creates a fiduciary duty
to act in good faith regarding the shared asset. That fiduciary duty was
willingly violated when Myers chose to transfer the funds to Branthoover’s
PayPal, and then later to herself. The appropriate method would have been
for Myers to transfer the funds directly to herself, but she avoided this to
conceal her bank account information in furtherance of a broader scheme.
72. This argument fails because the proceeds from the transfer were used to
acquire a second phone in furtherance of the broader scheme. VII.
PREDICATE ACT – VIOLATION OF THE TRAVEL ACT (18 U.S.C. § 1952) 73.
Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations contained in
paragraphs 1 through 72 above, as if fully set forth herein. 74. The Travel
Act, codified at 18 U.S.C. § 1952, criminalizes interstate travel or the use of
interstate facilities with the intent to promote, manage, establish, carry on,
or facilitate unlawful activity, followed by the performance or attempted
performance of such acts. According to 18 U.S.C. § 1952: "Whoever travels
in interstate or foreign commerce or uses the mail or any facility in
interstate or foreign commerce, with intent to- ... otherwise promote,
manage, establish, carry on, or facilitate the promotion, management,
establishment, or carrying on, of any unlawful activity, and thereafter
performs or attempts to perform- ... an act described in paragraph or shall
be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both..." 75.

=== PAGE 11 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
The statute has three essential elements: i. Interstate travel or use of
interstate facilities 24 ii. Intent to promote, manage, establish, carry on, or
facilitate unlawful activity iii. Subsequent performance or attempted
performance of acts in furtherance of the unlawful activity 76. For a Travel
Act violation to serve as a RICO predicate act, it must be "indictable" under
18 U.S.C. § 1952. Myers' conduct, as analyzed above, satisfies all elements of
a Travel Act violation: i. Myers engaged in interstate travel between Texas
and Oklahoma. ii. Myers traveled with the specific intent to coordinate the
preparation of fraudulent court documents and execute a criminal scheme.
Under United States v. Compton, 355 F.2d 872 (6th Cir. 1966), this intent
can be inferred from "evidence of a substantial course of illegal conduct,
occurring a reasonable time before and after an act of interstate travel." The
preparation of fraudulent court documents falls within the definition of
"unlawful activity" under the Travel Act, as it involves fraud, which is
indictable under state law. iii. After the interstate travel, Myers engaged in
overt acts to further the unlawful activity by preparing fraudulent legal
documents and coordinating the fraudulent scheme. As U.S. v. Admon, 940 F.
2d 1121 (8th Cir. 1991) clarified, the conduct after travel need not itself be
unlawful but must further the unlawful activity. The preparation and use of
fraudulent documents clearly meet this requirement. 25 77. Given that
Myers' conduct satisfies all elements of a Travel Act violation, this violation
qualifies as an "indictable" offense under 18 U.S.C. § 1952. As such, it
constitutes a valid predicate act for RICO purposes under 18 U.S.C. §
1961(1). 78. The Supreme Court's explanation in Perrin v. United States, 444
U.S. 37 (1979) that the Travel Act was intended to provide "a second layer of
enforcement" for interstate criminal activity underscores the significance of
federalizing crimes that cross state lines. Myers' conduct, involving
interstate travel for the purpose of engaging in fraudulent activities, is
precisely the type of behavior that the Travel Act was designed to address.
VIII. PATTERN OF RACKETEERING ACTIVITY 79. Plaintiff realleges and
incorporates by reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through
78 above, as if fully set forth herein. 80. A "pattern of racketeering activity"
requires at least two acts of "racketeering activity" occurring within a ten-
year period. 18 U.S.C. § 1961 (2025) ("'pattern of racketeering activity'
requires at least two acts of racketeering activity, one of which occurred
after the effective date of this chapter and the last of which occurred within
ten years (excluding any period of imprisonment) after the commission of a
prior act of racketeering activity"). 81. However, the mere existence of two
predicate acts is not automatically sufficient to establish a pattern. As
explained in Bonton v. Archer Chrysler Plymouth, Inc., 889 F.Supp. 995 (S.D.
Tex. 1995): 26 "Although at least two acts of racketeering are necessary to
constitute a pattern, two acts may not be sufficient. Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex
Co., 473 U.S. 479, 496 n. 14, 105 S.Ct. 3275, 3285 n. 14, 87 L.Ed.2d 346
(1985). RICO's legislative history leaves no doubt that 'there is something to
a RICO pattern beyond simply the number of predicate acts involved.'" 82.
Instead, courts have established that to prove a pattern, the predicate acts
must be both related and continuous. Bustos v. Invierte En Tex., 4:22-
CV-02690 (S.D. Tex. Jun 03, 2024) ("To rise to the level of 'racketeering
activity' there must be two or more predicate acts that are: (1) related; and
(2) amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity."). A.
Establishing a Pattern of Racketeering Activity 83. The factual allegations
identify several instances that constitute wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343

=== PAGE 12 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
and violations of the Travel Act under 18 U.S.C. § 1952: i. The extensive text
message communications (92 exchanges) on December 14, 2023, between
Myers and Branthoover using interstate wire facilities to coordinate their
scheme. ii. Branthoover's deceptive phone call to Plaintiff on December 15,
2023, where he falsely stated, "I've been where you are before. I want to
help both of you," to facilitate Myers' interstate travel to Oklahoma. iii. The
interstate wire transfer of $1,576 from the joint marital account to
Branthoover's PayPal account, which was executed to deprive Plaintiff of
funds. 27 iv. Branthoover's text messages to Plaintiff on December 16, 2023,
refusing to return the transferred funds and offering to "help with the
paperwork." v. Branthoover's text message on December 18, 2023, falsely
claiming to be a legal representative. vi. The ongoing interstate
communications between Myers and Branthoover to further their fraudulent
scheme, continuing through May 2025. 84. The factual allegations also
demonstrate potential Travel Act violations: i. Myers' interstate travel from
Texas to Oklahoma on December 15, 2023, with the intent to prepare
fraudulent court documents. ii. The interstate transportation of fraudulent
documents from Oklahoma back to Texas on December 17, 2023, intended
for filing in Texas courts. iii. The use of interstate facilities (phone calls, text
messages) to coordinate and further the fraudulent scheme. B. Relatedness
of Predicate Acts 85. The predicate acts of wire fraud and Travel Act
violations are clearly related, meeting the standard outlined in Bonton v.
Archer Chrysler Plymouth, Inc., 889 F.Supp. 995 (S.D. Tex. 1995). They
share: 28 i. Common Purpose: All acts were directed toward depriving
Plaintiff of his property rights and manipulating judicial proceedings to
benefit Myers in divorce proceedings. ii. Same Participants: Myers and
Branthoover were the consistent actors in all predicate acts. iii. Same
Victim: All acts targeted Plaintiff, causing him financial harm and depriving
him of legal rights. iv. Similar Methods: The acts consistently involved
deception, misrepresentation, and the manipulation of legal processes. v.
Temporal Connection: The acts occurred in a logical sequence, beginning on
December 14, 2023, and continuing through May 2025. C. Continuity of
Racketeering Activity 86. The pattern of racketeering activity demonstrates
both closed-ended and open-ended continuity: i. Closed-ended Continuity:
The scheme extends over a substantial period—from December 2023
through May 2025, over eighteen months. This satisfies the requirement for
"a series of related predicate acts extending over a substantial period of
time" as described in RICO: A Primer (2022).2 2 https://freemanlaw.com/
rico-a-primer/ 29 ii. Open-ended Continuity: The scheme also poses a threat
of continued criminal activity. Branthoover's message on May 24, 2025,
demonstrating continued monitoring of Plaintiff's activities and threatening
future retaliation, indicates that the racketeering activity could continue
indefinitely given that they are unable to finalize the divorce. This satisfies
the alternative requirement for "a threat of continuing criminal activity
extending indefinitely into the future" noted in RICO: A Primer (2022). D.
Role of Perjury and Subornation of Perjury 87. While perjury and
subornation of perjury in state court proceedings are not themselves listed
as predicate acts under RICO, they form an integral part of the overall
criminal scheme and help establish the pattern of racketeering activity when
considered alongside the actual predicate acts of wire fraud and Travel Act
violations. 88. As explained in RICO: A Primer (2022), racketeering acts
need not be similar or directly related to each other; they must simply be

=== PAGE 13 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
"related in some way to the affairs of the charged enterprise." The perjury
and subornation of perjury evident in the fraudulent court filings—including
the false statements in the divorce petition, the Affidavit of Indigency, and
the Application for Protective Order—are directly related to the predicate
acts of wire fraud and Travel Act violations. They share the same purpose,
involve the same participants, target the same victim, and form part of the
same overall scheme. For example: 30 i. The fraudulent court documents
were prepared during Myers' interstate travel to Oklahoma, connecting the
perjury to the Travel Act violation. ii. The false statements in these
documents were discussed and planned via interstate wire communications,
connecting the perjury to the wire fraud. iii. The deceptive interstate wire
transfer of funds was executed to support Myers during the divorce
proceedings initiated through fraudulent filings. iv. The perjerous
statements were influenced by Branthoover, connecting subordination of
perjury to the predicate acts. 89. These connections demonstrate how the
non-predicate acts of perjury committed by Myers and subornation of
perjury alleged against Branthoover, while not sufficient alone to establish a
RICO violation, contribute to the overall pattern of racketeering activity
when combined with the predicate acts of wire fraud and Travel Act
violations alleged by the Defendants. IX. ESTABLISHING AN ASSOCIATE-
IN-FACT ENTERPRISE 90. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference
the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 89 above, as if fully set
forth herein. 31 A. Formation of the Enterprise 91. The factual allegations
demonstrate the formation of an associate-in-fact enterprise between Myers
and Branthoover that satisfies the definition in 18 U.S.C. § 1961 (2025). i.
Myers and Branthoover associated for the common purpose of depriving
Plaintiff of his property rights through the manipulation of legal
proceedings. This shared objective is evident from their coordinated actions
beginning on December 14, 2023, immediately following Plaintiff's discovery
of Myers' affair. ii. Though informal, the enterprise had a clear
organizational structure as 1) Myers acted as the "inside" operative, with
direct access to marital assets and the ability to file fraudulent court
documents in Texas. 2) Branthoover served as the "outside" operative,
providing administrative oversight, expertise on protective orders due to his
prior criminal history (Paragraph 18), and a base of operations in Oklahoma.
3) Their respective roles complemented each other and demonstrated an
organized approach to their criminal scheme. iii. The enterprise functioned
as a continuing unit from December 2023 through May 2025, with
consistent roles and coordinated actions throughout this period. 32 B.
Maintenance of the Enterprise 92. The enterprise was maintained through
several key mechanisms: i. Continuous Communication: Myers and
Branthoover maintained regular interstate communications throughout the
scheme, beginning with the 92 text messages on December 14, 2023, and
continuing through May 2025. ii. Financial Support: The interstate wire
transfer of $1,576 from the joint marital account to Branthoover's PayPal
account provided financial resources to support the enterprise's activities.
iii. Operational Security Measures: The enterprise implemented specific
measures to protect its operations: 1) Myers acquired a secondary phone
number during her Oklahoma visit (Paragraph 38). iv. Myers returned with
pepper spray to support the false domestic violence narrative (Paragraph
37). v. Branthoover attempted to control communications by falsely claiming
legal representation (Paragraph 40). vi. Geographic Distribution: The

=== PAGE 14 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
enterprise maintained operations across state lines, with activities in both
Texas and Oklahoma, enhancing its ability to avoid detection and complicate
legal responses. 33 C. Enterprise Distinct from Racketeering Activity 93. As
Allstate Ins. Co. v. Donovan, CIVIL ACTION NO. H-12-0432 (S.D. Tex. Jul 03,
2012) reiterates, a RICO enterprise must be an entity ‘separate and apart
from the alleged pattern of racketeering’—not merely a conduit for the
predicate acts themselves. The nature and duration of the Myers–
Branthoover operation exhibits all three required elements: a separate
organizational purpose, defined roles within an enduring structure, and
coordinated decision-making extending beyond the January 16, 2024 initial
outcome, with the finalization of the scheme still pending. X. CLAIMS FOR
RELIEF COUNT 1: VIOLATION OF 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) Against All
Defendants 94. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the
allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 93 above, as if fully set forth
herein. 95. At all relevant times, Plaintiff was a person within the meaning of
18 U.S.C. §§ 1961(3) and 1964(c). 96. At all relevant times, each Defendant
was a person within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961(3) and 1962(c). 97. As
set forth above, Defendants Myers and Branthoover formed an association-
in-fact enterprise within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4) (the
"Enterprise"). The Enterprise was engaged in, and its activities affected,
interstate commerce. 98. The Enterprise had an ascertainable structure
separate and apart from the pattern of racketeering activity in which the
Defendants engaged. The Enterprise 34 maintained an existence beyond
that which was necessary to commit the predicate acts constituting the
pattern of racketeering activity. 99. In furtherance of the fraudulent scheme,
each Defendant conducted or participated, directly or indirectly, in the
conduct of the Enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity
within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961(1), 1961(5), and 1962(c). 100. As
detailed above, the Defendants committed multiple related acts of wire
fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1343 and Travel Act violations under 18
U.S.C. § 1952, and further committed acts of perjury and subordinated
perjury in furtherance of the scheme, constituting a pattern of racketeering
activity as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5). 101. The predicate acts committed
by the Defendants were related to each other in that they had the same or
similar purposes (to defraud Plaintiff of his property interests and
manipulate judicial proceedings), involved the same participants
(Defendants Myers and Branthoover), targeted the same victim (Plaintiff),
employed similar methods (deception, misrepresentation, and manipulation
of legal processes), and were not isolated events. 102. The predicate acts
committed by the Defendants demonstrate both closed-ended continuity,
spanning over eighteen months from December 2023 through May 2025,
and open-ended continuity, as evidenced by the ongoing threats and
monitoring activities continuing through May 2025, with the potential for
continued criminal activity in the future. 35 103. The Defendants
participated in the operation and management of the Enterprise by making
decisions on behalf of the Enterprise and by directing its affairs. Specifically:
i. Defendant Myers directed the Enterprise by initiating the criminal
scheme, communicating the scheme's objectives to Branthoover, opening a
private bank account, transferring marital funds, traveling interstate to
coordinate fraudulent document preparation, and filing fraudulent legal
documents in Texas courts. ii. Defendant Branthoover directed the
Enterprise by providing administrative oversight of the scheme, offering his

=== PAGE 15 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
expertise on protective order procedures, coordinating Myers' interstate
travel, receiving and retaining fraudulently transferred funds, preparing
fraudulent legal documents, and attempting to exert control over
communications related to the legal proceedings. 104. As a direct and
proximate result of the Defendants' violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), Plaintiff
has been injured in his business and property in an amount to be determined
at trial. Specifically, Plaintiff has suffered: i. Loss of $1,576 fraudulently
transferred from the joint marital account; ii. Business losses resulting from
the disruption of his home-based business operations; iii. Additional financial
damages resulting from the overdrawn account 36 and associated fees; iv.
Loss of real and personal property rights through the fraudulent
manipulation of judicial proceedings; vi. Ongoing damages resulting from
the continued operation of the Enterprise. 105. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §
1964(c), Plaintiff is entitled to recover from the Defendants threefold the
damages sustained, explained in more detail below. COUNT 2: VIOLATION
OF 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d) Against All Defendants 106. Plaintiff realleges and
incorporates by reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through
105 above, as if fully set forth herein. 107. Beginning on December 14,
2023, and continuing through at least May 24, 2025, the Defendants
knowingly, willfully, and unlawfully conspired to violate 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c),
that is, to conduct and participate, directly and indirectly, in the conduct of
the affairs of the Enterprise, through a pattern of racketeering activity, in
violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d), as explained above. 108. The conspiracy
between Myers and Branthoover was formed on or about December 14,
2023, evidenced by the intensive communications (92 text messages)
exchanged between them immediately following Plaintiff's discovery of
Myers' extramarital affair. These communications—documented in Plaintiff’s
possession and available for production at the appropriate stage—
demonstrate the deliberate and coordinated formation of the conspiracy. 37
109. Each Defendant agreed that they would commit at least two acts of
racketeering activity in the conduct of the affairs of the Enterprise. The
agreement can be inferred from the Defendants' coordinated actions,
including: i. The systematic coordination of their activities through
interstate communications; ii. The division of responsibilities within the
Enterprise; iii. The implementation of operational security measures; iv. The
consistent pattern of actions furthering the fraudulent scheme; v. The
ongoing coordination over an eighteen-month period. 110. In furtherance of
the conspiracy, the Defendants committed numerous overt acts, including
but not limited to: i. Myers opening a private bank account to facilitate asset
concealment on December 14, 2023 and sharing these details with
Branthoover; ii. Myers and Branthoover exchanging 92 text messages on
December 14, 2023, to coordinate their criminal plans; iii. Branthoover
placing a deceptive phone call to Plaintiff on December 15, 2023; iv. Myers
executing an interstate wire transfer of $1,576 to Branthoover's PayPal
account on December 15, 2023; v. Myers traveling interstate to Oklahoma
on December 15, 2023, to coordinate with Branthoover; vi. Myers and
Branthoover preparing fraudulent court documents in 38 Oklahoma on
December 16-17, 2023 to be later submitted in Texas courts on December
18,22; vii. Myers transporting the fraudulent documents back to Texas on
December 17, 2023; viii. Branthoover sending threatening text messages to
Plaintiff on December 18, 2023; ix. Myers filing fraudulent documents with
Texas courts on December 18, 2023; x. Myers filing a fraudulent Application

=== PAGE 16 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
for Protective Order on December 22, 2023; xi. Branthoover continuing to
send threatening communications to Plaintiff through May 24, 2025. 111. As
a direct and proximate result of the Defendants' conspiracy in violation of 18
U.S.C. § 1962(d), Plaintiff has been injured in his business and property. The
injuries suffered by Plaintiff include but are not limited to: i. Loss of $1,576
fraudulently transferred from the joint marital account; ii. Business losses
resulting from the disruption of his home-based business operations; iii.
Additional financial damages resulting from the overdrawn account and
associated fees; iv. Loss of real and personal property rights through the
fraudulent 39 manipulation of judicial proceedings; v. Ongoing economic
harm resulting from the continued operation of the Enterprise. 112.
Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c), Plaintiff is entitled to recover from the
Defendants threefold the damages sustained, explained in more detail below.
XI. Damages 113. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the
allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 112 above, as if fully set forth
herein. 114. As a direct result of the racketeering activity alleged herein, the
Plaintiff has sustained substantial injury to his business operations, suffered
significant credit decrease, has lost business opportunities, had his personal
belongings destroyed, has had one vehicle repossessed, and has been
subject to transient and unstable housing. A. Damage to Business
Operations 115. In January of 2021, Plaintiff founded a digital financial
analytics business from his home, focused on delivering real-time stock
market data, automated technical indicators, and live market commentary to
retail traders and boutique investment groups across the United States and
Canada. His monetization model included tiered subscription plans, custom
data feed licensing, and API endpoints that offered real-time market data.
116. By 2022, client demand and revenue growth began outpacing Plaintiff’s
initial architecture. In response, Plaintiff made the strategic decision to
pause direct monetization in early 2023 to reinvest in infrastructure and
ensure the platform could handle commercial-scale traffic. This included: 40
i. Designing and deploying asynchronous financial signal algorithms, ii.
Mastering asynchronous programming, PostgreSQL and NoSQL systems for
storage and efficiency purposes, iii. Building websocket-based dashboards
for live data streaming, iv. Drafting licensing terms for premium indicator
access and reseller API use. v. Building partnerships and affiliations with
similar businesses in the market-data space. This period of reinvestment
came at significant cost: Plaintiff temporarily sacrificed a revenue stream
that had reached $12,000 per month at its peak in exchange for long-term
scalability. Plaintiff anticipated a short-term revenue dip, which he
strategically absorbed in reliance on his imminent reentry to market. 117.
By September of 2023, Plaintiff had completed core backend optimization
and UI integrations and obtained an affiliate marketing partnership with
polygon.io and was prepared to scale user acquisition and marketing. This
readiness marked a significant inflection point in Plaintiff’s commercial
trajectory. 118. Plaintiff reasonably projected a return to $9,000–$10,000/
month by mid-2024, with a 24-month growth model targeting $170,124.59 in
revenue through subscriptions and data services alone. This forecast was
based not on speculation, but on verified revenue history, platform
readiness, and documented user engagement trends. 119. As part of
Defendants’ coordinated scheme to deprive Plaintiff of his home and
operational capacity, Plaintiff was wrongfully and suddenly removed from
the family 41 residence in January 2024, despite Defendants’ full knowledge

=== PAGE 17 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
that he operated an active and income-generating business from that
location. This action caused a direct and immediate injury to Plaintiff’s
business, cutting off his ability to scale as planned. Instead of growing,
Plaintiff’s revenue collapsed. 120. The removal was executed without
warning or legal justification and had an immediate effect on Plaintiff’s
operations. Although the core data systems were technically portable, the
business depended on commercial-grade internet, low-latency upload
speeds, and a consistent, uninterrupted digital environment to support real-
time financial analytics, streaming, and API-based services. Following the
removal, Plaintiff was unable to find alternate housing with sufficient
bandwidth. Attempts to work from temporary family residences failed, as
Plaintiff’s usage either exceeded available internet capacity or interfered
with household connectivity, making it impossible to maintain stable service.
Without the ability to stream, deliver data products, or support his clients,
Plaintiff's revenue quickly declined and client engagement deteriorated.
121. Between September and December 2023, Plaintiff earned $10,529.72,
averaging $2,632.43 per month – his baseline earnings during the period of
restructuring. Based on past performance, technical stability, and confirmed
subscriber growth through marketing strategies, Plaintiff reasonably
projected returning to $5,000/month by mid-2024, with stable, scalable
performance continuing through 2025. 122. Under a conservative model,
had the business not been disrupted by Defendants’ interference, Plaintiff
would have earned: 42 i. Approximately $15,794.58 during the first half of
2024 (maintaining his pre-removal baseline), ii. Approximately $24,000.00
during the second half of 2024 (with moderate growth to $4,000/month), iii.
And approximately $60,000.00 across 2025 (at $5,000/month). This yields a
total projected income of $99,794.58 for the 18-month period following the
wrongful removal. 123. Accordingly, Plaintiff seeks recovery of $99,794.58 in
lost business income directly caused by Defendants’ pattern of racketeering
activity described above. B. Damages – Fraudulent Transfer and Cessation of
Business Advertisements 124. As noted above, Defendants coordinated in
emptying the joint marital PNC bank account, transferring $1,576.00 from
Plaintiff to a PayPal account controlled by Daniel Kenneth Branthoover,
which was subsequently routed to Morgan Michelle Myers. These funds
were used to purchase a second phone for Myers, enabling concealed
communication and coordination between Defendants in furtherance of their
scheme to defraud Plaintiff and obstruct his business operations.
Accordingly, Plaintiff therefore seeks recovery of the full amount of
$1,576.00. D. Damages – Total 126. As a direct result of the Defendants’
coordinated and fraudulent conduct detailed above, Plaintiff has sustained
total economic losses in the amount of one hundred and one thousand three
hundred seventy dollars and fifty-eight cents. ($101,370.58). This 43
includes: i. $99, 794.58 in lost business income caused by Defendant’s
actions leading to Plaintiff’s wrongful removal from his residence and the
destruction of his operational infrastructure over the last 18 months; ii.
$1,576.00 in marital funds fraudulently transferred from Plaintiff’s joint
bank account in furtherance of a scheme to defraud. 127. Pursuant to 18
U.S.C. § 1964(c), Plaintiff is entitled to treble damages for injuries sustained
to his business and property because of Defendants’ racketeering activity.
Accordingly, Plaintiff seeks an award of treble damages in the total
estimated amount of three hundred and four thousand, one hundred and
eleven dollars and seventy-four cents ($304,111.74) to be further clarified at

=== PAGE 18 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
trial. 128. All damages referenced herein are based on verifiable records
and financial documentation. Plaintiff will produce supporting evidence and
exhibits at the appropriate stage of these proceedings or at trial. XII.

TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS research and explain why plaintiff's complaint
beats the motion to dismiss
Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
The plaintiff's RICO complaint is likely to survive the motion to dismiss
because it adequately pleads all required elements—including a valid
enterprise, sufficient predicate acts, a pattern of racketeering activity, and
concrete injury to business and property—with the specificity required
under federal pleading standards, while also establishing proper venue in
the Western District of Oklahoma.
Summary
Plaintiff Charles Dustin Myers has filed a civil RICO action against
defendants Daniel Kenneth Branthoover and Morgan Michelle Myers,
alleging they engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity that included
wire fraud and violations of the Travel Act to deprive him of property and
business interests. The defendants have moved to dismiss under Rule 12(b)
(6) for failure to state a claim and Rule 12(b)(3) for improper venue. Upon

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
analysis of the applicable law and the plaintiff's detailed factual allegations,
the complaint appears to sufficiently plead all required elements of a RICO
claim to survive the motion to dismiss.
The plaintiff's complaint sets forth specific factual allegations detailing an
enterprise formed between the defendants, multiple predicate acts including
interstate wire transfers and travel, a pattern of racketeering activity
showing both relatedness and continuity over an 18-month period, and
concrete injuries to his business and property directly resulting from the
defendants' actions. Additionally, the plaintiff has adequately established
venue in the Western District of Oklahoma by alleging that substantial parts
of the events giving rise to the claim occurred within that district,
particularly related to the coordination and planning that took place at
defendant Branthoover's Oklahoma residence.
Background and Relevant Law
RICO Statutory Framework
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) provides a
civil remedy for persons injured by racketeering activity. Under 18 U.S.C. §
1964(c) (2025), "Any person injured in his business or property by reason of
a violation of section 1962 of this chapter may sue therefor in any
appropriate United States district court and shall recover threefold the
damages he sustains and the cost of the suit, including a reasonable
attorney's fee..."
To establish a civil RICO claim under § 1962(c), a plaintiff must prove: "(1)
conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity." Taylor v. Chesapeake Operating, Inc., Case No. CIV-18-565-D (W.D.
Okla. Nov 20, 2019). This is echoed in Hershewe v. Givens, CIVIL ACTION
NO. 1:14cv655-MHT (WO) (M.D. Ala. Sep 29, 2015), which confirms these
four elements as essential for a viable RICO claim.
"Racketeering activity" is defined by 18 U.S.C. § 1961 (2025) to include
various predicate acts, including wire fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343) and violations
of the Travel Act (18 U.S.C. § 1952). To establish a "pattern" of racketeering
activity, RICO requires at least two predicate acts occurring within a ten-
year period, but as noted in Bonton v. Archer Chrysler Plymouth, Inc., 889
F.Supp. 995 (S.D. Tex. 1995), "Although at least two acts of racketeering are
necessary to constitute a pattern, two acts may not be sufficient." Courts
have established that the predicate acts must be both related and
continuous to form a pattern.
Pleading Standards for RICO Claims
For a complaint to survive a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), it "must
contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to 'state a claim to relief
that is plausible on its face.'" Pajany v. Capgemini, Inc. (2019-07-03). A claim
is facially plausible "when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the
court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the

=== PAGE 20 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
misconduct alleged." This standard demands "more than a sheer possibility
that a defendant has acted unlawfully."
In Remsnyder v. MBA Mortg. Servs., Civil Action CCB-19-0492 (D. Md. Sep
09, 2021), the court explained that a plaintiff need not "forecast" evidence
sufficient to prove the elements of the claim, but the complaint must allege
sufficient facts to establish those elements. The complaint must "advance
the plaintiff's claim 'across the line from conceivable to plausible.'"
Additionally, when a plaintiff appears pro se, as in this case, courts apply a
more lenient standard to the pleadings. As stated in Mendlow v. Seven Locks
Facility, 86 F.Supp.2d 55 (D. Conn. 2000), "Where a plaintiff is appearing pro
se, the complaint must be liberally construed in the plaintiff's favor and must
be held to the less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by
lawyers." However, "the court's focus remains on whether the complaint
states any valid ground for relief."
Venue Requirements
Venue for civil RICO actions is governed by both general venue provisions
and specific RICO venue provisions. Under 28 U.S.C. § 1391 (2025), venue is
proper in "a judicial district in which a substantial part of the events or
omissions giving rise to the claim occurred." Additionally, 18 U.S.C. § 1965
(2025) provides that a civil RICO action "may be instituted in the district
court of the United States for any district in which such person resides, is
found, has an agent, or transacts his affairs."
Analysis of the Plaintiff's RICO Claim
Subject Matter Jurisdiction
The federal court clearly has subject matter jurisdiction over this case under 
28 U.S.C. § 1331 (2025), which provides that "district courts shall have
original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws,
or treaties of the United States." The plaintiff's claims arise under the
federal RICO statute, giving the district court original jurisdiction.
Sufficiency of the Enterprise Allegation
The defendants argue that the complaint fails to allege a valid enterprise.
However, the plaintiff has alleged specific facts that establish the existence
of an enterprise between defendants Myers and Branthoover. As explained
in Raineri Constr., LLC v. Taylor, Case No. 4:12-CV-2297 (CEJ) (E.D. Mo. Jan
31, 2014), "In order to avoid dismissal for failure to state a claim, a plaintiff
must plead specific facts, not mere conclusory allegations, which establish
the existence of an enterprise."
The plaintiff has pleaded that Myers and Branthoover formed an association-
in-fact with a defined structure: Myers acting as the "inside" operative with
direct access to marital assets and ability to file court documents in Texas,
and Branthoover serving as the "outside" operative, providing administrative

=== PAGE 21 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
oversight, expertise on protective orders, and a base of operations in
Oklahoma. The enterprise persisted from December 2023 through May
2025, with consistent roles and coordinated actions.
According to Allstate Ins. Co. v. Benhamou, 190 F.Supp.3d 631 (S.D. Tex.
2016), "Regardless of whether an enterprise is alleged to be a legal entity or
an association-in-fact, the enterprise must be an entity separate and apart
from the pattern of activity in which it engages." The plaintiff has alleged
that the enterprise existed beyond just committing the predicate acts, as it
maintained an organizational structure with defined roles, geographic
distribution, and operational security measures.
Sufficient Predicate Acts
The defendants contend that the complaint lacks specific predicate acts.
However, the plaintiff has alleged several acts that qualify as predicates
under RICO:
Wire Fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343): 18 U.S.C. § 1343 (2025) establishes
that wire fraud occurs when someone "having devised or intending to
devise any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or
property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or
promises, transmits or causes to be transmitted by means of wire,
radio, or television communication in interstate or foreign commerce,
any writings, signs, signals, pictures, or sounds for the purpose of
executing such scheme or artifice."
The plaintiff alleges that Myers transferred $1,576 from a joint marital
account to Branthoover's PayPal account via interstate wire, with the
intent to defraud the plaintiff of his share of those funds. This
transaction was accompanied by extensive text messages (92
exchanges) between Myers and Branthoover on December 14, 2023,
using interstate wire facilities to coordinate their scheme. Branthoover
also made a deceptive phone call to the plaintiff on December 15, 2023,
falsely claiming he wanted to help both parties while actually
facilitating the fraudulent scheme.
As outlined in City of New York v. Cyco.Net, Inc., 383 F.Supp.2d 526
(S.D. N.Y. 2005), to establish wire fraud as a RICO predicate act, a
plaintiff must show: "(1) scheme to defraud, including proof of intent;
(2) money or property as object of scheme; (3) use of mails or wires to
further the scheme." The plaintiff's allegations satisfy all three
elements.
Travel Act Violations (18 U.S.C. § 1952): 18 U.S.C. § 1952 (2025)
criminalizes interstate travel or the use of interstate facilities with the
intent to "promote, manage, establish, carry on, or facilitate the
promotion, management, establishment, or carrying on, of any unlawful
activity."
The plaintiff alleges that Myers traveled interstate from Texas to
Oklahoma on December 15, 2023, with the intent to prepare fraudulent
1. 
2. 

=== PAGE 22 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
court documents. She then transported these documents back to Texas
on December 17, 2023, for filing in Texas courts. These allegations
describe interstate travel for the purpose of facilitating unlawful
activity, followed by the performance of acts in furtherance of that
activity, satisfying the elements of a Travel Act violation.
Pattern of Racketeering Activity
The defendants argue that the plaintiff fails to allege continuity of
racketeering activity. However, the complaint alleges facts that demonstrate
both relatedness and continuity of the predicate acts:
Relatedness: As explained in RICO: A Primer (2022), predicate acts
are related when they "have the same or similar purposes, results,
participants, victims or methods of commission." The plaintiff alleges
that all predicate acts shared a common purpose (depriving the plaintiff
of property rights), involved the same participants (Myers and
Branthoover), targeted the same victim (the plaintiff), used similar
methods (deception and manipulation of legal processes), and occurred
in a logical sequence from December 2023 through May 2025.
Continuity: RICO: A Primer (2022) notes that continuity can be
demonstrated by showing either:
"Closed-ended continuity. Proving 'a series of related predicate
acts extending over a substantial period of time.'"
"Open-ended continuity. A threat of 'continuing criminal activity
extending indefinitely into the future.'"
The plaintiff demonstrates closed-ended continuity by alleging a
scheme spanning over 18 months (December 2023 through May 2025).
He also shows open-ended continuity through Branthoover's message
on May 24, 2025, which indicates ongoing monitoring of the plaintiff's
activities and threats of future retaliation.
This pattern of activity goes well beyond the minimum requirement of two
predicate acts, addressing the concern raised in Smith v. Fed. Title &
Escrow Co., Civil Case No. 17-cv-01580 (RCL) (D. D.C. Jun 20, 2018) that "to
show that a pattern of racketeering activity exists, RICO requires at least
two predicate criminal racketeering acts over a ten-year period" and that
"these predicate acts show elements of 'relatedness' and 'continuity.'"
Standing: Injury to Business or Property
The defendants contend that the plaintiff lacks standing because he has not
alleged a concrete injury to business or property. However, the plaintiff has
alleged specific injuries, including:
Loss of $1,576 fraudulently transferred from the joint marital account
Business losses resulting from the disruption of his home-based
business operations
Financial damages from the overdrawn account and associated fees

Loss of real and personal property through manipulated judicial
proceedings
Kovalev v. Stepansky, CIVIL ACTION NO. 19-5579 (E.D. Pa. Feb 04, 2020)
explains that "to have standing to litigate a civil RICO claim, a plaintiff must
show that [he] suffered an injury to [his] business or property and that the
injury was proximately caused by the defendant's racketeering activities."
The plaintiff's alleged injuries are concrete financial losses, not speculative
damages or personal injuries, and he has alleged a direct causal connection
between these losses and the defendants' racketeering activities.
As noted in Defending RICO Claims In The Business Context Part II: RICO
Claims Must Allege Injury To Business Or Property (2022-05-17), courts
have determined that "injuries to business or property" include "lost profits,
excessive interest charges, property damage and interference with business,
such as decreased business profits or increased costs of doing business."
The plaintiff's alleged business disruption and financial losses fall squarely
within these recognized categories of injury.
Proper Venue in the Western District of Oklahoma
The plaintiff has established venue in the Western District of Oklahoma on
two grounds:
Under 28 U.S.C. § 1391 (2025), venue is proper in "a judicial district in
which a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the
claim occurred." The plaintiff alleges that substantial parts of the
events giving rise to the claim occurred in the Western District of
Oklahoma, including:
Myers' travel to Oklahoma to coordinate with Branthoover
Preparation of fraudulent court documents at Branthoover's
Oklahoma residence
Planning and coordination of the scheme at Branthoover's
Oklahoma residence
Under 18 U.S.C. § 1965 (2025), a civil RICO action "may be instituted in
the district court of the United States for any district in which such
person resides, is found, has an agent, or transacts his affairs." The
plaintiff alleges that Branthoover resides in Canadian County, which is
within the Western District of Oklahoma.
The defendants' argument that venue is improper because events occurred
primarily outside this district is not supported by the law, which requires
only that "a substantial part" of the events occurred in the district, not that
most events occurred there.
Pro Se Plaintiff Considerations
As noted in Mendlow v. Seven Locks Facility, 86 F.Supp.2d 55 (D. Conn.
2000), "Where a plaintiff is appearing pro se, the complaint must be liberally
construed in the plaintiff's favor and must be held to the less stringent
4. 
1. 
◦ 
◦ 
◦ 
2. 

=== PAGE 24 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers." The plaintiff's pro se
status entitles him to a more lenient evaluation of his pleadings, although
the court must still focus on whether the complaint states valid grounds for
relief.
The plaintiff's complaint, while drafted pro se, demonstrates a sophisticated
understanding of RICO requirements and provides detailed factual
allegations supporting each element of his claims. When construed liberally,
as required for pro se litigants, the complaint clearly states valid grounds for
relief under RICO.
Domestic Dispute Context
The defendants argue that the case is an improper use of RICO because it
arises from a domestic dispute. However, neither the RICO statute nor
binding precedent categorically excludes domestic disputes from RICO's
reach. The determinative factor is not the underlying relationship between
the parties, but whether the alleged conduct meets the statutory
requirements for a RICO claim.
As explained in Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy (2024-01-01), RICO's broad
definition of racketeering activity and its inclusion of mail and wire fraud as
predicate offenses creates "a potentially broad pathway to pleading of such
a claim." While courts should be cautious about allowing ordinary domestic
disputes to be transformed into federal RICO claims, the plaintiff's
allegations go well beyond a typical domestic dispute, describing a
coordinated scheme involving interstate travel, wire fraud, and manipulation
of judicial proceedings that continued for over 18 months.
Conclusion: The Complaint Survives the
Motion to Dismiss
For a motion to dismiss to succeed, the defendants must show that the
complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted or that
venue is improper. Based on the analysis above, the plaintiff's complaint
should survive the motion to dismiss for several reasons:
Valid Enterprise: The plaintiff has alleged specific facts establishing
an association-in-fact enterprise between Myers and Branthoover, with
a structure distinct from the pattern of racketeering activity itself.
Sufficient Predicate Acts: The plaintiff has alleged multiple acts of
wire fraud and violations of the Travel Act, which qualify as predicate
acts under RICO.
Pattern of Racketeering Activity: The plaintiff has alleged related
acts spanning over 18 months, demonstrating both closed-ended and
open-ended continuity.
1. 
2. 
3. 

=== PAGE 25 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Concrete Injury to Business and Property: The plaintiff has alleged
specific financial losses and business disruption directly caused by the
defendants' racketeering activities.
Proper Venue: The plaintiff has established venue in the Western
District of Oklahoma by showing that substantial parts of the events
occurred there and that defendant Branthoover resides there.
Detailed Factual Allegations: The complaint provides specific dates,
amounts, communications, and actions that, when accepted as true for
purposes of the motion to dismiss, state a plausible claim for relief
under RICO.
As stated in Evans v. United States Environmental Protection Agency ARB
CASE NO. 08-059, ALJ CASE NO. 2008-CAA-003 (2012-07-31), a complaint
has "facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows
the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for
the misconduct alleged." The plaintiff's detailed factual allegations, when
accepted as true and viewed in the light most favorable to him as a pro se
litigant, allow the court to reasonably infer that the defendants are liable for
RICO violations.
Therefore, the plaintiff's complaint states a claim upon which relief can be
granted, establishes proper venue, and should survive the defendants'
motion to dismiss.
Legal Authorities
Raineri Constr., LLC v. Taylor, Case No. 4:12-CV-2297 (CEJ) (E.D. Mo. Jan 31,
2014)
U.S. District Court — Eastern District of Missouri
Extract
In order to avoid dismissal for failure to state a claim, a plaintiff must plead
specific facts, not mere conclusory allegations, which establish the existence
of an enterprise. An enterprise can include any 'union or group of
individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.' However, the
alleged enterprise must be an entity separate and distinct from the pattern
of racketeering activity in which it engages. In other words, 'there must be
some showing of an ascertainable structure beyond that inherent in the
pattern of racketeering activity.'
Summary
To survive a motion to dismiss a RICO claim, the plaintiff must plead specific
facts that establish the existence of an enterprise. This enterprise must be
distinct from the pattern of racketeering activity itself and must have an
ascertainable structure. The passage provides guidance on what is

Sep 29, 2015)
U.S. District Court — Middle District of Alabama
Extract
The defendants next argue that Hershewe does not meet the substantive
requirements for pleading a civil RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). To
establish a RICO claim, a plaintiff must plead '(1) conduct (2) of an
enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity.' Williams v.
Mohawk Indus., Inc., 465 F.3d 1277, 1282 (11th Cir. 2006). As a 'breed of
fraud claims,' civil RICO allegations 'must be pled with an increased level of
specificity.' Ambrosia Coal & Const. Co. v. Pages Morales, 482 F.3d 1309,
1316 (11th Cir. 2007).
Summary
Framework for understanding the necessary elements of a RICO claim,
which are conduct, enterprise, pattern, and racketeering activity. The
plaintiff in the current case has detailed allegations that align with these
elements, including the conduct of an enterprise (Myers and Branthoover), a
pattern of racketeering activity (wire fraud and Travel Act violations), and
specific predicate acts. This specificity and alignment with the required
elements can help the plaintiff's complaint withstand a motion to dismiss.
Bonton v. Archer Chrysler Plymouth, Inc., 889 F.Supp. 995 (S.D. Tex. 1995)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of Texas
Extract
Reduced to its three essentials, a civil RICO claim must involve: (1) a person
who engages in (2) a pattern of racketeering activity; (3) connected to the
acquisition, establishment, conduct, or control of an enterprise... Without
regard to Bonton's failure to establish a predicate act, a RICO plaintiff must
also establish that there was a 'pattern of racketeering activity.' Delta Truck
& Tractor, Inc., 855 F.2d at 242. A 'pattern of racketeering activity,' as
required by § 1962(c), requires at least two acts of racketeering activity
within a ten year period. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5). Although at least two acts of
racketeering are necessary to constitute a pattern, two acts may not be
sufficient. Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479, 496 n. 14, 105 S.Ct.
3275, 3285 n. 14, 87 L.Ed.2d 346 (1985)... Rule 9(b)'s particularity
requirement applies to pleading fraud as a predicate act in a RICO claim.

Landry, 901 F.2d at 430; Elliott, 867 F.2d at 880; Haroco, Inc., 747 F.2d at
405. To satisfy Rule 9(b), a plaintiff must at a minimum allege the '`time,
place, and contents of the false representations, as well as the identity of the
person making the misrepresentation and what he obtained thereby.'
Summary
A civil RICO claim must involve a person engaging in a pattern of
racketeering activity connected to an enterprise. The pattern requires at
least two acts of racketeering within ten years, but two acts alone may not
be sufficient. The acts must be related and continuous. Rule 9(b) requires
fraud to be pleaded with particularity, specifying the time, place, and
contents of false representations, the identity of the person making them,
and what was obtained. The plaintiff's complaint must meet these standards
to survive a motion to dismiss.
Allstate Ins. Co. v. Benhamou, 190 F.Supp.3d 631 (S.D. Tex. 2016)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of Texas
Extract
A violation of § 1962(c) requires (1) conduct or participation (2) of an
enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity. Sedima, 473
U.S. at 496, 105 S.Ct. 3275. A plaintiff must allege each of these elements in
order to state a claim. ... Regardless of whether an enterprise is alleged to
be a legal entity or an association-in-fact, the enterprise must be an entity
separate and apart from the pattern of activity in which it engages. Old Time
Enters., Inc. v. Int'l Coffee Corp., 862 F.2d 1213, 1217 (5th Cir.1989). Thus, a
plaintiff must plead specific facts which establish that the association exists
for purposes other than simply to commit the predicate acts. Foufas, 867 F.
2d at 881. Although proof of one does not necessarily establish the other,
'evidence used to prove the pattern of racketeering activity and the evidence
establishing an enterprise ‘may in particular cases coalesce.’
Summary
To successfully allege a RICO claim under § 1962(c), a plaintiff must
demonstrate conduct or participation in an enterprise through a pattern of
racketeering activity. The enterprise must be distinct from the pattern of
racketeering activity, and the plaintiff must plead specific facts establishing
the existence of the enterprise for purposes beyond merely committing
predicate acts. The evidence for the pattern of racketeering activity and the
enterprise may overlap but must be distinct.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
Plaintiff alleges that the Defendants conducted the management and
operation of the affairs of their own enterprises, directly or indirectly,
through a pattern of racketeering activity within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. §§
1961(1)(B), 1961(5), and 1962(c), in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c),
consisting of continuous and multiple instances of mail and wire fraud in
violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1341 and 1343. (Am.Compl.¶¶ 16, 64, 80, 90.) ...
Where a plaintiff in a RICO claim alleges racketeering activity based on the
predicate acts of violating the mail or wire fraud statutes, he or she must
prove three elements: (1) scheme to defraud, including proof of intent; (2)
money or property as object of scheme; (3) use of mails or wires to further
the scheme. See United States v. Autuori, 212 F.3d 105, 115 (2d Cir.2000);
United States v. Dinome, 86 F.3d 277, 283 (2d Cir.1996).
Summary
Elements required to establish a RICO claim based on mail and wire fraud: a
scheme to defraud, intent, money or property as the object, and the use of
mails or wires to further the scheme. The plaintiff in the current case has
alleged similar predicate acts of wire fraud and violations of the Travel Act,
which are recognized as racketeering activities under RICO. The plaintiff's
complaint details a scheme involving fraudulent transfers and interstate
communications, which aligns with the elements required for a RICO claim.
Therefore, the complaint sufficiently alleges a pattern of racketeering
activity, which is necessary to withstand a motion to dismiss.

U.S. 97, 106, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976). However, the court's
focus remains on whether the complaint states any valid ground for relief.

Summary
In U.S. Federal Courts, complaints filed by pro se plaintiffs are subject to a
liberal construction standard, meaning they are interpreted more leniently
than those drafted by attorneys. This is to ensure that pro se litigants are
not unfairly disadvantaged due to their lack of legal expertise. The court's
primary focus is on whether the complaint states any valid ground for relief,
rather than on technical deficiencies in the pleading.
Smith v. Fed. Title & Escrow Co., Civil Case No. 17-cv-01580 (RCL) (D. D.C.
Jun 20, 2018)
U.S. District Court — District of Columbia
Extract
A violation of § 1962(a) of the RICO Act consists of four elements: '(1)
conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity.' W. Assocs. Ltd. P'ship v. Mkt Square Assocs., 235 F.3d 629, 633
(D.C. Cir. 2000) (citing Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479, 496, 105
S.Ct. 3275, 87 L.Ed.2d 346 (1985)). Because Plaintiffs fail to allege sufficient
facts to plausibly plead a pattern of racketeering activity—RICO's third
element—the claim must be dismissed. To show that a pattern of
racketeering activity exists, RICO requires at least two predicate criminal
racketeering acts over a ten-year period. See 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5). The
Supreme Court has further required that these predicate acts show
elements of 'relatedness' and 'continuity.' H.J. Inc. v. Nw. Bell Tel. Co., 492
U.S. 229, 239, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989). For the relatedness
element, the criminal acts must share 'similar purposes, results, victims, or

=== PAGE 30 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
methods of commission, or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing
characteristics.' Id at 240. Continuity may be proved by establishing either a
'closed period of repeated conduct' or a threat of future criminal activity. Id.
at 241.
Summary
Essential elements required to establish a RICO claim, specifically focusing
on the need to demonstrate a pattern of racketeering activity. This pattern
requires at least two predicate acts that are related and continuous. The
passage emphasizes the importance of showing relatedness (similar
purposes, results, victims, or methods) and continuity (either a closed period
of repeated conduct or a threat of future criminal activity). This framework
is applicable in federal courts when evaluating RICO claims.
Kovalev v. Stepansky, CIVIL ACTION NO. 19-5579 (E.D. Pa. Feb 04, 2020)
U.S. District Court — Eastern District of Pennsylvania
Extract
Under the federal civil RICO statute, '[a]ny person injured in his business or
property by reason of a violation of section 1962 of this chapter[, which
prohibits racketeering activity,] may sue therefor in any appropriate United
States district court. .. .' 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c). 'In order to have standing to
litigate a civil RICO claim, a plaintiff must show that [he] suffered an injury
to [his] business or property and that the injury was proximately caused by
the defendant's racketeering activities.' Miller v. Pocono Ranch Lands Prop.
Owners Ass'n Inc., 557 F. App'x 141, 145 (3d Cir. 2014) (per curiam).
Because '[i]njuries to one's business or property differ from injuries to one's
person,' the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit 'has
rejected the argument that personal injuries qualify as RICO injuries to
'business or property.'' Williams v. BASF Catalysts LLC, 765 F.3d 306, 323
(3d Cir. 2014) (citing Maio v. Aetna, Inc., 221 F.3d 472, 483, 492 (3d Cir.
2000)). Furthermore, RICO does not provide a cause of action where the
damages alleged are 'speculative.' Maio, 221 F.3d at 495 (speculative
damages that were 'predicated exclusively on the possibility that future
events might occur' could not form the basis of a RICO injury).
Summary
To have standing to litigate a civil RICO claim, a plaintiff must demonstrate
an injury to business or property that is proximately caused by the
defendant's racketeering activities. Personal injuries do not qualify as RICO
injuries to business or property, and speculative damages cannot form the
basis of a RICO injury. The plaintiff in the current case has alleged specific
financial losses and business disruptions, which are concrete injuries to
business or property, thus satisfying the standing requirement for a RICO
claim.

Taylor v. Chesapeake Operating, Inc., Case No. CIV-18-565-D (W.D. Okla.
Nov 20, 2019)
U.S. District Court — Western District of Oklahoma
Extract
To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss a § 1962(c) claim, Plaintiffs
must allege that Defendant '(1) participated in the conduct (2) of an
enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity.' Tal, 453 at
1244. '[R]acketeering activity' is defined to include several predicate acts,
including the two alleged here—mail fraud and wire fraud. In addition to
these elements, Plaintiffs must also show proximate causation between the
RICO predicate act and the injury. Hemi Group, LLC v. City of New York, 559
U.S. 1, 8 (2010).
Summary
The plaintiff's allegations must include participation in an enterprise, a
pattern of racketeering activity, and a direct link between the predicate acts
and the injury suffered. The passage also clarifies that there is no
requirement for a separate "racketeering injury" beyond the injury to
business or property caused by the racketeering activity itself.
Remsnyder v. MBA Mortg. Servs., Civil Action CCB-19-0492 (D. Md. Sep 09,
2021)
U.S. District Court — District of Maryland
Extract
To survive a motion to dismiss, the factual allegations of a complaint 'must
be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level on the
assumption that all the allegations in the complaint are true (even if
doubtful in fact).' Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007)
(citations omitted). 'To satisfy this standard, a plaintiff need not 'forecast'
evidence sufficient to prove the elements of the claim.- However, the
complaint must allege sufficient facts to establish those elements.' Walters v.
McMahen, 684 F.3d 435, 439 (4th Cir. 2012) (citation omitted). 'Thus, while
a plaintiff does not need to demonstrate in a complaint that the right to
relief is 'probable,' the complaint must advance the plaintiff's claim 'across
the line from conceivable to plausible.'
Summary
Standard for a complaint to survive a motion to dismiss in federal court. The
complaint must contain factual allegations that raise the right to relief above
a speculative level, assuming all allegations are true. The plaintiff does not

=== PAGE 32 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
need to prove the elements of the claim at this stage but must allege
sufficient facts to make the claim plausible, not just conceivable. This
standard is derived from the Supreme Court's decision in Bell Atl. Corp. v.
Twombly and is applicable in federal courts.
18 U.S.C. § 1965 18 U.S.C. § 1965 Venue and Process
Extract
(a) Any civil action or proceeding under this chapter against any person may
be instituted in the district court of the United States for any district in
which such person resides, is found, has an agent, or transacts his affairs.
Summary
The passage from 18 U.S.C. § 1965(a) provides that a civil action under the
RICO statute can be instituted in any district where the defendant resides, is
found, has an agent, or transacts his affairs. This is relevant to the question
of venue, which is one of the grounds for the motion to dismiss. The
defendants in this case are alleged to have engaged in activities that could
be considered as transacting affairs within the Western District of
Oklahoma, thus potentially making venue proper in that district.
28 U.S.C. § 1331 28 U.S.C. § 1331 Federal Question
Extract
The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising
under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.
Summary
28 U.S.C. § 1331 provides federal district courts with original jurisdiction
over civil actions that arise under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the
United States. This means that if a plaintiff's complaint involves a federal
question, such as a claim under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act (RICO), the federal court has jurisdiction to hear the case.
In this scenario, the plaintiff's complaint involves allegations under RICO,
which is a federal statute. Therefore, the federal court has jurisdiction to
hear the case, and the motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction would not be
successful.

Summary
The U.S. Code provides a civil remedy for individuals who have been injured
in their business or property due to a RICO violation. This includes the
ability to sue in federal court and recover threefold the damages sustained,
along with the cost of the suit and reasonable attorney's fees. This provision
supports the plaintiff's ability to bring a RICO claim in federal court and
seek substantial damages if the allegations are proven.
18 U.S.C. § 1343 18 U.S.C. § 1343 Fraud By Wire, Radio, Or Television
Extract
Whoever, having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to
defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent
pretenses, representations, or promises, transmits or causes to be
transmitted by means of wire, radio, or television communication in
interstate or foreign commerce, any writings, signs, signals, pictures, or
sounds for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice, shall be fined
under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both.
Summary
Elements of wire fraud, which include devising a scheme to defraud and
using interstate wire communications to execute the scheme. This is
relevant to the plaintiff's complaint because the plaintiff alleges that the
defendants engaged in wire fraud by transferring funds from a joint account
using interstate wire communications. This alleged wire fraud is a predicate
act under RICO, which supports the plaintiff's claim that the defendants
engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity. The plaintiff's complaint
includes specific allegations of wire fraud, which, if proven, would satisfy
the requirements for a RICO claim. Therefore, the complaint has a basis in
law and fact that could withstand a motion to dismiss.
18 U.S.C. § 1952 18 U.S.C. § 1952 Interstate and Foreign Travel Or
Transportation In Aid of Racketeering Enterprises

Extract
Whoever travels in interstate or foreign commerce or uses the mail or any
facility in interstate or foreign commerce, with intent to- distribute the
proceeds of any unlawful activity; or commit any crime of violence to further
any unlawful activity; or otherwise promote, manage, establish, carry on, or
facilitate the promotion, management, establishment, or carrying on, of any
unlawful activity, and thereafter performs or attempts to perform- (A) an act
described in paragraph or shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not
more than 5 years, or both; or (B) an act described in paragraph shall be
fined under this title, imprisoned for not more than 20 years, or both, and if
death results shall be imprisoned for any term of years or for life.
Summary
The Travel Act under 18 U.S.C. § 1952 criminalizes the use of interstate
commerce facilities with the intent to promote or facilitate unlawful
activities. This is relevant to the plaintiff's complaint as it alleges that the
defendants engaged in interstate travel and communications to further a
fraudulent scheme, which could constitute a violation of the Travel Act. The
plaintiff's complaint includes allegations of wire fraud and violations of the
Travel Act, which are recognized as predicate acts under RICO. If the
plaintiff can establish these predicate acts, it supports the claim of a pattern
of racketeering activity, which is essential to withstand a motion to dismiss
under Rule 12(b)(6).
28 U.S.C. § 1391 28 U.S.C. § 1391 Venue Generally
Extract
A civil action may be brought in- a judicial district in which any defendant
resides, if all defendants are residents of the State in which the district is
located; a judicial district in which a substantial part of the events or
omissions giving rise to the claim occurred, or a substantial part of property
that is the subject of the action is situated; or if there is no district in which
an action may otherwise be brought as provided in this section, any judicial
district in which any defendant is subject to the court's personal jurisdiction
with respect to such action.
Summary
The venue is proper in a judicial district where any defendant resides if all
defendants are residents of the state in which the district is located.
Additionally, venue is proper in a district where a substantial part of the
events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred. In this case, the
plaintiff has alleged that a substantial part of the events giving rise to the
claim occurred within the Western District of Oklahoma, which would make
venue proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2).

Summary
The definition of "racketeering activity" under 18 U.S.C. § 1961 includes acts
that are indictable under certain provisions of the U.S. Code, such as wire
fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343) and violations of the Travel Act (18 U.S.C. § 1952).
These acts are relevant to the plaintiff's complaint, which alleges that the
defendants engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity involving wire
fraud and Travel Act violations. The plaintiff's complaint outlines specific
instances of wire fraud and interstate travel with the intent to commit
unlawful acts, which are recognized as predicate acts under the RICO
statute. Therefore, the plaintiff's complaint sufficiently alleges a pattern of
racketeering activity, which is a necessary element to survive a motion to
dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6).
Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy
The Brief - American Bar Association - 2024-01-01

Extract
RICO’s broad definition of racketeering activity and the act’s reference to
mail and wire fraud as predicate offenses begs the question: Why not RICO?
That is, should the plaintiff consider adding a RICO count to an existing
state cause of action? Moreover, since an action under RICO arises under
federal law, a plaintiff can elect to have access to federal court. Civil RICO is
so broad and offers such a potentially broad pathway to pleading of such a
claim in light of the inclusion of mail and wire fraud as predicate acts that a
plaintiff can take almost any given set of facts and fashion their pleadings
and be... RICO’s prohibitions may be enforced in both criminal and civil
contexts. In the context of a civil action, a plaintiff must be directly injured
by reason of the defendant’s racketeering activities. Proximate cause, as an
aspect of RICO’s “by reason of ” standard, requires a RICO plaintiff to show
that the defendant’s racketeering offenses led directly to the plaintiff ’s
injuries. RICO creates a private cause of action under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c). To
state a civil RICO claim, a plaintiff must allege (1) two or more predicate
racketeering offenses, (2) the existence of an enterprise affecting interstate
commerce, (3) a connection between the racketeering offenses, and (4) an
injury by reason of the above.
Summary
The passage explains that RICO's broad definition of racketeering activity,
including mail and wire fraud as predicate offenses, provides a wide
pathway for plaintiffs to plead a RICO claim. In a civil RICO action, the
plaintiff must demonstrate direct injury from the defendant's racketeering
activities, which must include at least two predicate offenses, an enterprise
affecting interstate commerce, a connection between the offenses, and an
injury resulting from them. This broad framework allows plaintiffs to fashion
their pleadings to fit within the RICO statute, making it a powerful tool in
federal court.

'Plausible' Deniability
Litigation - American Bar Association - Michael J. Miarmi -
2021-01-01
Extract
Among the 86 Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 8 is arguably one of the
most—if not the most—important, as it sets the initial test all federal
plaintiffs must pass in pursuing their claims... Courts have long wrestled
with how deeply to scrutinize allegations at the pleading stage, but that
question has become even more thorny following two decisions from the U.S.
Supreme Court that have altered both the language and the landscape of
pleading in civil cases: Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544 (2007),
and Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662 (2009)... With plausibility, context
matters. As the Tenth Circuit has explained (echoing the Third Circuit), 'the
degree of specificity necessary to establish plausibility and fair notice, and
therefore the need to include sufficient factual allegations, depends on
context.'
Summary
Importance of Rule 8 in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which requires
a "short and plain statement of the claim" to survive a motion to dismiss.
The passage highlights the impact of the Twombly and Iqbal decisions,
which require that a complaint must state a plausible claim for relief. The
Tenth Circuit's explanation emphasizes that the degree of specificity needed
to establish plausibility depends on the context of the case.

and a demand for relief. In 2007 and 2009, the Supreme Court interpreted
Rule 8 to require that plaintiffs allege in their complaints 'sufficient factual
matter, accepted as true, to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its
face.' Under this standard, a complaint filed in federal district court has
'facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the
court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the
misconduct alleged.'
Summary
Requirements under Rule 8 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which
mandates that a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter to state a
claim that is plausible on its face. This means that the complaint must
provide enough factual content to allow the court to reasonably infer that
the defendant is liable for the alleged misconduct. This standard was
established by the Supreme Court in 2007 and 2009, emphasizing the need
for factual plausibility rather than mere legal conclusions.

OCAHO's Rules of Practice and Procedure provide that complaints shall
contain: 'A clear and concise statement of facts, upon which an assertion of

To meet pleading standards, a complaint must contain '[t]he alleged
violations of law, with a clear and concise statement of facts for each
violation alleged to have occurred.' 28 C.F.R. § 68.7(b). ... receive sufficient
notice of the complainant's allegations. Separately, the legal standard for a
motion to dismiss requires an analysis as to whether the complaint states a
claim upon which relief may be granted. 28 C.F.R. § 68.10; see Heath v.
Tringapps, Inc., 15 OCAHO no. 1410, 3. When reviewing a motion to

construes the facts in the light most favorable to the complainant.' A.S. v.
Amazon Web Servs., Inc., 14 OCAHO no. 1381d, 10 (citation omitted). ...
OCAHO's legal standard for a motion to dismiss is 'modeled after Federal
Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b).' Tringapps, Inc., 15 OCAHO no. 1410, at 3.
While Rule 12(b) can serve as a model, case law applying the rule is
instructive only to the extent it does not contradict Section 68.10. See Split
Rail Fence Co., Inc., 10 OCAHO no. 1181, at 4; infra Part IV.A. When
analyzing a motion to dismiss, '[t]he court must accept the complainant's

drawn in the complainant's favor[.]' See Udala v. N.Y. State Dep't of Educ., 4
OCAHO no. 633, 390, 394 (citations omitted). Bearing in mind the
interdependent nature of an analysis of a Rule 12-based motion and pleading
standards, by meeting the pleading standard here, the Complaint has stated
a claim upon which relief can be granted because he has identified a theory
by which this Respondent allegedly violated 8 U.S.C. § 1324b.

If the complaint meets these standards, it states a claim upon which relief
can be granted, thus defeating a motion to dismiss.
US Tech Workers v. IO Datasphere, Inc.
DOJ Office of the Chief Administrative Hearing Officer Decisions
Extract
A Complaint must state a claim upon which relief can be granted. 28 C.F.R. §
68.10(b). Respondent may file a motion highlighting this issue to the Court,
and alternatively, '[t]he Administrative Law Judge may dismiss the
complaint... without a motion from the respondent, if the Administrative Law
Judge determines that the complainant has failed to state a claim upon
which relief can be granted.' 28 C.F.R. § 68.10(b). See Zajradhara v. Jin Joo
Corp., 19 OCAHO no. 1554a, 2-3 (dismissing § 1324b retaliation claim for

failure to state a claim under ALJ's own authority); Patel v. USCIS Boston, 14
OCAHO no. 1353, 3-4 (noting that OCAHO ALJs may sua sponte dismiss a
complaint for failure to state a claim, after providing complainant an
opportunity to amend). Whether potential deficiencies in a Complaint are
brought to the Court's attention by way a motion, or based on its own
determination, the same legal standards for analyzing the pleadings apply.
OCAHO's Rules of Practice and Procedure provide that complaints shall
contain: 'A clear and concise statement of facts, upon which an assertion of
jurisdiction is predicated'; 'The alleged violations of law, with a clear and
concise statement of facts for each violation alleged to have occurred'; and
'A short statement containing the remedies and/or sanctions sought to be
imposed against the respondent.' 28 C.F.R. § 68.7(b)-.
Summary
Requirements for a complaint to survive a motion to dismiss, emphasizing
the need for a clear and concise statement of facts, alleged violations of law,
and the remedies sought. These requirements are generally applicable to
complaints under OCAHO's jurisdiction. The passage also notes that a
complaint can be dismissed if it fails to state a claim upon which relief can
be granted, but the complainant must be given an opportunity to amend the
complaint.
Pajany v. Capgemini, Inc.
Immigration Decisions of the Administrative Law Judge
Extract
A complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to
'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.' A claim will have 'facial
plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to
draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the
misconduct alleged.' This standard demands 'more than a sheer possibility
that a defendant has acted unlawfully.'
Summary
For a complaint to survive a motion to dismiss, it must present sufficient
factual matter that, when accepted as true, states a claim that is plausible
on its face. This means the complaint must allow the court to reasonably
infer that the defendant is liable for the alleged misconduct. The standard
requires more than just a possibility of unlawful action; it requires factual
content that supports the claim.

Summary
For a complaint to survive a motion to dismiss, it must contain enough
factual matter to make the claim plausible on its face. This means that the
complaint must provide enough detail to allow the court to reasonably infer
that the defendant is liable for the alleged misconduct. The standard is not
met by mere possibility; there must be enough factual content to make the
claim plausible.
RICO: A Primer
Extract
Mail and wire fraud are the most common predicate acts... The racketeering
acts need not be similar or directly related to each other; rather, it is
sufficient that the racketeering acts are related in some way to the affairs of
the charged enterprise, including, for example, that: the racketeering acts
furthered the goals of or benefitted the enterprise, the enterprise or the
defendant's role in the enterprise enabled the defendant to commit, or
facilitated the commission of, the racketeering acts, the racketeering acts
were committed at the behest of, or on behalf of, the enterprise, or the
racketeering acts had the same or similar purposes, results, participants,
victims or methods of commission. The continuity requirement is likewise
satisfied where the predicates are a regular way of conducting the
defendant's ongoing legitimate business (in the sense that it is not a
business that exists for criminal purposes), or of conducting or participating
in an ongoing and legitimate RICO 'enterprise.' A plaintiff may demonstrate
a pattern by establishment that the predicate acts pose a threat of continued
criminal activity, which is generally demonstrated by showing either: *
Closed-ended continuity. Proving 'a series of related predicate acts
extending over a substantial period of time.' * Open-ended continuity. A
threat of 'continuing criminal activity extending indefinitely into the future,'
in light of the nature of the enterprise and predicate acts alleged.
Summary
The passage explains that for a RICO claim to succeed, the plaintiff must
demonstrate a pattern of racketeering activity, which can be established
through related acts that further the goals of the enterprise. The acts do not
need to be similar but must be related to the enterprise's affairs. Continuity

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
can be shown through closed-ended continuity (a series of acts over a
substantial period) or open-ended continuity (a threat of ongoing criminal
activity). The plaintiff's complaint alleges multiple predicate acts, including
wire fraud and violations of the Travel Act, which are related to the
enterprise's goal of defrauding the plaintiff. The complaint also
demonstrates continuity, as the acts span over 18 months and pose a threat
of continued activity. This aligns with the requirements outlined in the
passage, suggesting that the plaintiff's complaint sufficiently alleges a RICO
violation.
Defending RICO Claims In The Business Context Part II: RICO Claims Must
Allege Injury To Business Or Property
Extract
Fortunately for defendants, the RICO standing requirement greatly restricts
the types of claims that can survive a motion to dismiss. If a plaintiff brings a
civil suit alleging a RICO violation, the plaintiff must plausibly allege that his
injury animating the RICO claim is associated with his business or property
by reason of the defendant's violation of the RICO laws. Absent these
allegations, the lawsuit must be dismissed. RICO standing is distinct from
the more well-known concept of constitutional standing. For RICO claims, in
addition to pleading a sufficiently specific injury, including allegations that
the plaintiff has suffered known damages (as opposed to mere speculative or
unprovable damages), the plaintiff must allege that he suffered an injury to
his business or property that bears some causal relationship to the alleged
act or acts that violated RICO. This fundamental RICO requirement helps
ensure that RICO is not expanded beyond its original intent. ... In contrast,
in addition to more obvious injuries to business or property, courts have
determined that a plaintiff's alleged injuries were sufficient in cases
involving lost profits, excessive interest charges, property damage and
interference with business, such as decreased business profits or increased
costs of doing business. Injuries to intangible business assets (such as lost
customers or business relationships) are also usually sufficient. Moreover,
the alleged injury to a plaintiff's business or property must be both factually
and proximately caused by the defendant's alleged violation of RICO. This
means not only that absent the defendant's alleged violation of RICO, the
injury to the plaintiff's business or property would not have occurred (i.e.,
but-for causation), but also that the alleged violation must directly lead to
the plaintiff's injuries. The latter significantly limits RICO's reach and
prohibits those indirectly harmed from bringing flimsy RICO claims.
Summary
For a RICO claim to survive a motion to dismiss, the plaintiff must allege a
specific injury to business or property that is causally related to the
defendant's RICO violation. The injury must be concrete and not speculative,
and it must be both factually and proximately caused by the alleged RICO
violation. The passage provides examples of sufficient injuries, such as lost

profits and interference with business, which align with the plaintiff's
allegations in the complaint.

Summary
The passage explains that for a RICO claim to be valid, the plaintiff must
demonstrate a pattern of racketeering activity, which can be established
through related predicate acts that further the goals of the enterprise. The
continuity requirement can be satisfied by showing either closed-ended
continuity (a series of related acts over a substantial period) or open-ended
continuity (a threat of ongoing criminal activity). The plaintiff's complaint
alleges multiple predicate acts, including wire fraud and violations of the
Travel Act, which are related to the enterprise's goals and demonstrate both
closed-ended and open-ended continuity. This supports the argument that
the plaintiff's complaint sufficiently alleges a pattern of racketeering activity,
which is essential to withstand a motion to dismiss.
