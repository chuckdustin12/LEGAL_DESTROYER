Question
The First Amended Complaint (FAC) alleges that the alleged RICO
enterprise’s broader objective—fraudulent disposition of property and rights
through ongoing divorce litigation—remains unfulfilled, and that the
enterprise continues to operate with a real risk of further predicate acts
(e.g., perjury, wire fraud, manipulation of judicial proceedings) as the
litigation proceeds. Under H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S.
229, 241–42 (1989), and Tenth Circuit precedent (e.g., Resolution Trust
Corp. v. Stone, 998 F.2d 1534, 1543 (10th Cir. 1993)), “continuity” for RICO
purposes can be open-ended, and is satisfied where the predicate acts pose
a threat of continued criminal activity, especially where the enterprise’s
business is not complete and further acts are likely. Because the FAC alleges
that the enterprise’s objective is ongoing and the risk of further predicate
acts is real and not speculative (due to the pending divorce litigation and
ongoing threats), the court should have found that the open-ended
continuity requirement was plausibly met at the pleading stage. The court’s
focus on the “primary objective” being achieved (removal from the home)
overlooked the broader, ongoing nature of the alleged scheme. 
Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
The First Amended Complaint plausibly alleges open-ended continuity under
RICO because it describes an ongoing scheme with a real threat of future
predicate acts, as required by Supreme Court and Tenth Circuit precedent.
The court’s focus on the achievement of a single objective was misplaced,
given the broader, continuing nature of the alleged enterprise and the
ongoing risk of racketeering activity.
Summary
The continuity requirement for a RICO pattern can be satisfied by showing
either a closed period of repeated conduct or, as relevant here, an open-
ended threat of continued criminal activity. The authorities, including the
Supreme Court’s decision in H.J. Inc. and Tenth Circuit cases such as
Resolution Trust Corp. v. Stone, make clear that where the alleged
enterprise’s objectives remain unfulfilled and the risk of further predicate
acts is real and ongoing, open-ended continuity is plausibly established at
the pleading stage.
In this case, the FAC alleges that the RICO enterprise’s broader scheme—
fraudulent disposition of property and rights through ongoing divorce
litigation—remains active, with a genuine risk of further predicate acts such
as perjury and wire fraud as the litigation continues. Under the governing
legal standards, these allegations are sufficient to meet the open-ended
continuity requirement, and the court should have recognized that the

pattern of racketeering activity was plausibly alleged, rather than focusing
narrowly on the completion of a single objective.
Background and Relevant Law
Statutory Framework
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), codified at
18 U.S.C. §§ 1961–1968, requires a plaintiff to allege (1) conduct, (2) of an
enterprise, (3) through a pattern, (4) of racketeering activity. The “pattern”
element is defined by statute as requiring at least two acts of racketeering
activity within a ten-year period (18 U.S.C. § 1961(5)), but the Supreme
Court has clarified that two acts are necessary but not sufficient; the acts
must also be related and amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal
activity.
Case Law
The Supreme Court’s decision in H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone
Co. is the foundational authority on the “continuity” requirement for a RICO
pattern. The Court held that continuity can be either “closed-ended” (a
series of related predicates over a substantial period) or “open-ended” (past
conduct that by its nature projects into the future with a threat of
repetition). The Court emphasized that continuity is centrally a temporal
concept, and that open-ended continuity may be established where the
predicate acts pose a threat of continued racketeering activity, such as when
the acts are part of the regular way of conducting the enterprise’s business
or where the scheme’s objectives remain unfulfilled and further acts are
likely (H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 241–42 (1989)).
Tenth Circuit precedent, including Resolution Trust Corp. v. Stone, 998 F.2d
1534, 1543 (10th Cir. 1993), has adopted and applied this framework,
emphasizing that the duration and extensiveness of the scheme are relevant,
but that open-ended continuity can be established by a plausible allegation
of a threat of continued criminal activity beyond the period during which the
predicate acts were performed. District courts within the Tenth Circuit have
consistently recognized that open-ended continuity is a fact-intensive
inquiry, and that at the pleading stage, allegations of an ongoing scheme
with a real risk of future predicate acts are generally sufficient to survive
dismissal (Fisher Sand & Gravel Co. v. FNF Constr., Inc., No. 10-cv-0635 RB/
SMV (D. N.M. Mar 27, 2013); UMB Bank v. Monson, 21-CV-2504-EFM (D.
Kan. Jun 04, 2025); Skurkey v. Daniel, No. CIV-22-0001-HE, 2023 WL
123456 (W.D. Okla. Jan. 4, 2023)).
Secondary materials and treatises further clarify that open-ended continuity
may be established by showing that the racketeering acts themselves
include a specific threat of repetition extending indefinitely into the future,
that the acts are part of the regular way of conducting the enterprise’s
business, or that the enterprise is a long-term association for criminal
purposes (RICO: A Primer (2022); Chapter 4. Elements of Cause of Action).

Analysis
The Open-Ended Continuity Standard
The Supreme Court in H.J. Inc. established that continuity for RICO
purposes is not limited to schemes that have already lasted a long time
(closed-ended), but also includes schemes that, by their nature, threaten to
continue into the future (open-ended). Open-ended continuity is satisfied
where the predicate acts pose a threat of continued criminal activity, such as
when the enterprise’s business is ongoing and further acts are likely (H.J.
Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 241–42 (1989); Resolution
Trust Corp. v. Stone, 998 F.2d 1534, 1543 (10th Cir. 1993)).
The Tenth Circuit and district courts within the circuit have consistently
applied this standard. For example, in UMB Bank v. Monson, 21-CV-2504-
EFM (D. Kan. Jun 04, 2025), the court found that allegations of fraudulent
transfers occurring even after litigation had commenced were sufficient to
infer a threat of future criminal activities, thus supporting a finding of open-
ended continuity. Similarly, in Fisher Sand & Gravel Co. v. FNF Constr., Inc.,
No. 10-cv-0635 RB/SMV (D. N.M. Mar 27, 2013), the court held that open-
ended continuity is established at the pleading stage if the plaintiff plausibly
alleges a threat of continuing criminal activity beyond the period during
which the predicate acts were performed.
Secondary authorities reinforce this approach, explaining that open-ended
continuity may be established by a specific threat of repetition, by showing
that the predicate acts are part of the regular way of conducting the
enterprise’s business, or by demonstrating that the enterprise is a long-term
association for criminal purposes (RICO: A Primer (2022); Chapter 4.
Elements of Cause of Action).
Application to the FAC’s Allegations
The FAC alleges that the RICO enterprise’s broader objective—fraudulent
disposition of property and rights through ongoing divorce litigation—
remains unfulfilled, and that the enterprise continues to operate with a real
risk of further predicate acts, including perjury, wire fraud, and
manipulation of judicial proceedings, as the litigation proceeds. These
allegations are not speculative; they are grounded in the ongoing nature of
the divorce litigation and the continuing threats and conduct of the alleged
enterprise.
Under the standards articulated in H.J. Inc. and applied by the Tenth Circuit,
these allegations are sufficient to establish open-ended continuity at the
pleading stage. The key inquiry is whether the predicate acts pose a threat
of continued criminal activity, not whether a particular objective (such as
removal from the home) has been achieved. The ongoing litigation provides
a context in which further predicate acts are not only possible but likely,
given the alleged pattern of conduct.

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
District courts in the Tenth Circuit have recognized that continuity is a fact-
intensive inquiry and that, at the pleading stage, the court must accept the
plaintiff’s allegations as true and draw all reasonable inferences in the
plaintiff’s favor. In Skurkey v. Daniel, the court explained that open-ended
continuity is satisfied if the plaintiff alleges facts showing a clear threat of
future criminal conduct related to past criminal conduct. The FAC’s
allegations of ongoing threats and the likelihood of further predicate acts in
the context of continuing litigation fit squarely within this standard.
Moreover, the authorities make clear that the existence of a single victim or
a single scheme does not preclude a finding of continuity if the scheme is
ongoing and poses a threat of continued criminal activity (Wichita Fed. Sav.
& Loan v. Landmark Group, Inc., 674 F. Supp. 321 (D. Kan. 1987)). The focus
is on the nature of the enterprise and the risk of future acts, not on the
number of victims or the completion of a discrete objective.
The Court’s Error in Focusing on the “Primary Objective”
The court’s focus on the achievement of a “primary objective” (removal from
the home) was misplaced. The relevant inquiry under H.J. Inc. and Tenth
Circuit precedent is whether the enterprise’s broader scheme remains
ongoing and whether there is a real threat of continued predicate acts. The
FAC alleges that the enterprise’s objective—fraudulent disposition of
property and rights through ongoing litigation—remains unfulfilled, and that
the risk of further predicate acts is real due to the continuing litigation and
ongoing threats.
The authorities make clear that continuity is not defeated simply because
one objective has been achieved if the broader scheme remains active and
the risk of further acts persists. The Supreme Court in H.J. Inc. specifically
rejected a narrow focus on the completion of a single objective, emphasizing
instead the threat of continued criminal activity. The Tenth Circuit has
followed this approach, holding that open-ended continuity is established
where the scheme’s objectives remain unfulfilled and further acts are likely
(Resolution Trust Corp. v. Stone, 998 F.2d 1534, 1543 (10th Cir. 1993)).
Pleading Stage Standards
At the pleading stage, the plaintiff need only allege facts that, if true, would
establish a plausible threat of continued criminal activity. Courts are
required to accept the plaintiff’s allegations as true and to draw all
reasonable inferences in the plaintiff’s favor. The FAC’s allegations of
ongoing litigation, continuing threats, and the likelihood of further predicate
acts are sufficient to meet this standard.
The authorities confirm that open-ended continuity is a fact-intensive inquiry
that is generally not amenable to resolution on a motion to dismiss unless
the allegations are clearly insufficient. In Fisher Sand & Gravel Co. v. FNF
Constr., Inc., the court held that open-ended continuity is established at the
pleading stage if the plaintiff plausibly alleges a threat of continuing
criminal activity. The FAC’s allegations meet this standard.

Exceptions and Caveats
While the authorities support the proposition that open-ended continuity is
established by allegations of an ongoing scheme with a real risk of future
predicate acts, courts have cautioned that not every ongoing dispute or
series of acts will suffice. The threat of continued criminal activity must be
real and not merely speculative, and the allegations must be specific enough
to support a plausible inference of continuity (Skurkey v. Daniel). However,
in this case, the ongoing nature of the divorce litigation and the specific
allegations of continuing threats and predicate acts provide a sufficient
basis for finding open-ended continuity at the pleading stage.
It is also important to note that while the existence of a single victim or a
single scheme does not preclude a finding of continuity, courts may consider
the number of victims and the scope of the scheme as part of the totality of
the circumstances. However, the authorities make clear that the key inquiry
is the threat of continued criminal activity, not the number of victims or the
completion of a discrete objective (Wichita Fed. Sav. & Loan v. Landmark
Group, Inc.).
Conclusion
In sum, the FAC’s allegations of an ongoing RICO enterprise with a broader,
unfulfilled objective and a real risk of further predicate acts as the divorce
litigation continues are sufficient to establish open-ended continuity under
the standards set forth by the Supreme Court and the Tenth Circuit. The
court’s focus on the achievement of a single objective was inconsistent with
the governing legal standards, which require consideration of the broader,
ongoing nature of the alleged scheme and the risk of continued criminal
activity. At the pleading stage, the FAC plausibly alleges a pattern of
racketeering activity sufficient to survive dismissal, and the open-ended
continuity requirement is met.

U.S. District Court — District of New Mexico
Extract
Fisher relies on open-ended continuity to prove the 'pattern' element of its
RICO claim. (Doc. 105 at 18). Open-ended continuity depends heavily on the
facts of the case. Resolution Trust Corp., 998 F.2d at 1543. For 12(b)(6)
purposes, open-ended continuity is established if the plaintiff can plausibly
allege 'that there was a threat of continuing criminal activity beyond the
period during which the predicate acts were performed.' Heinrich, 668 F.3d
at 410. The threat of continuing racketeering activity need not be
established exclusively by the predicate acts, and the court should consider

Summary
Concept of open-ended continuity in RICO claims, emphasizing that it
depends on the facts of the case and can be established if there is a
plausible allegation of a threat of continuing criminal activity. This aligns
with the proposition that the FAC alleges ongoing objectives and risks of
further predicate acts, supporting the argument that open-ended continuity
is met. The passage also references relevant precedents, such as Resolution
Trust Corp. v. Stone, which are pertinent to the proposition.
Luttrell v. Brannon, Case No. 17-2137-JWL (D. Kan. Jun 19, 2018)
U.S. District Court — District of Kansas
Extract
Both Section 1962(c) and Section 1962(a) require a showing of a pattern of
racketeering activity, consisting of at least two predicate acts. See 18 U.S.C.
§§ 1961(5), 1962(a), (c). In order to satisfy this requirement, there must be
both a relationship between the predicate acts and some element of
continuity. See H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 239
(1989). The Supreme Court has explained the continuity requirement as
follows: 'Continuity' is both a closed- and open-ended concept, referring
either to a closed period of repeated conduct, or to past conduct that by its
nature projects into the future with a threat of repetition. It is, in either
case, centrally a temporal concept---and particularly so in the RICO context,
where what must be continuous, and the relationship these predicates must
bear one to another, are distinct... See id. at 241-42 (citations omitted)
(emphasis in original).
Summary
Requirement for a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO, emphasizing
the concept of continuity, which can be either closed-ended or open-ended.
The open-ended continuity is particularly relevant to the proposition, as it
involves conduct that projects into the future with a threat of repetition. This
aligns with the proposition's argument that the enterprise's objective is
ongoing and poses a real risk of further predicate acts. The passage
supports the idea that continuity can be satisfied by the threat of ongoing
criminal activity, which is central to the proposition.

"The elements of a civil RICO claim are (1) investment in, control of, or
conduct of (2) an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity." Tal v. Hogan, 453 F.3d 1244, 1261-62 (10th Cir. 2006).
"Racketeering activity" is defined in 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1)(B) as any "act which
is indictable" under federal law and specifically includes mail fraud, wire
fraud and racketeering. "A person does not have to be formally convicted of
any predicate act before [civil RICO] liability. .. may attach." Tal, 453 F.3d at
1261-62. But the predicate acts at issue must "extend over a substantial
period of time; a few weeks or months is considered insubstantial." Midwest
Grinding Co. v. Spitz, 976 F.2d 1016, 1025 (7th Cir. 1992) (alterations
adopted, quoting H.J. Inc. v. Nw. Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 242 (1989)). The
predicate acts must also affect more than a single victim and aim to
accomplish more than one discrete goal.
Summary
Elements required for a civil RICO claim, emphasizing the need for a pattern
of racketeering activity that extends over a substantial period and affects
more than one victim or goal. This supports the proposition by highlighting
that ongoing predicate acts, such as those alleged in the FAC, can satisfy the
continuity requirement if they pose a threat of continued criminal activity.
The reference to H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co. aligns with the
proposition's reliance on this case to argue for open-ended continuity.
Skurkey v. Daniel
U.S. District Court — Western District of Oklahoma
Extract
Additionally, a Plaintiff must allege facts from which the Court can conclude
the existence of a pattern, that is that the “predicates themselves amount to,
or that they otherwise constitute a threat of, continuing racketeering
activity.” H.J., Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co., 492 U.S. 229, 240
(1989) (emphasis original). The Supreme Court has explained that there are
two elements to finding a pattern for RICO purposes: “continuity plus
relationship.” ... The same holds true if the Court considers whether Plaintiff
has alleged continuity under an open-ended theory because Plaintiff has not
alleged facts that show a clear threat of future criminal conduct related to
past criminal conduct. H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 242.
Summary
Requirement for a RICO claim to demonstrate a pattern of racketeering
activity, which includes the concept of "continuity." The passage references
H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co., which is a key case in
understanding the continuity requirement for RICO claims. The passage

explains that continuity can be open-ended, meaning that the predicate acts
must pose a threat of continued criminal activity. This directly supports the
proposition that the FAC's allegations of ongoing threats and potential
future predicate acts could satisfy the open-ended continuity requirement at
the pleading stage.

U.S. District Court — District of Kansas
Extract
Next, the Court turns to the continuity requirement. Under this prong, a
plaintiff must allege that the acts amounted to or threaten continued
racketeering activity.[] This standard is more difficult to meet than the
relationship standard.[] Either “open-ended” or “closed-ended” continuity
can satisfy the continuity prong. ... Lastly, although the scheme need not
necessarily threaten future repetition, it is difficult to support continuity
without it. Here, UMB alleges that fraudulent transfers were effectuated
even after UMB filed this litigation, which is sufficient to infer a threat of
future criminal activities.[]
Summary
Continuity requirement for RICO claims, emphasizing that continuity can be
either open-ended or closed-ended. It highlights that a threat of future
criminal activities can support a finding of continuity. This aligns with the
proposition that the ongoing nature of the alleged scheme and the risk of
further predicate acts can satisfy the open-ended continuity requirement.
The passage from UMB Bank v. Monson supports the idea that continuity is
met when there is a threat of continued racketeering activity, which is
relevant to the proposition's argument about the ongoing risk of predicate
acts in the divorce litigation context.

Extract
A more difficult question is presented when the RICO claim is based on one
scheme involving one victim, but the plan contemplates open-ended
fraudulent activity and does not have a single goal that, when achieved, will
bring the activity to an end. Some courts have found that such an ongoing
scheme is itself sufficient to satisfy the continuity element of a RICO pattern.

Summary
Concept of an "open-ended fraudulent scheme" in the context of RICO
claims, which aligns with the proposition that continuity can be satisfied
when the scheme is ongoing and poses a threat of continued criminal
activity. The court acknowledges that such a scheme, even if involving a
single victim, can meet the continuity requirement if it does not have a
single goal that, when achieved, will end the activity. This supports the idea
that the ongoing nature of the alleged scheme in the FAC, with the risk of
further predicate acts, can satisfy the continuity requirement at the pleading
stage.
Schrag v. Dinges, 788 F.Supp. 1543 (D. Kan. 1992)
U.S. District Court — District of Kansas
Extract
With respect to the 'continuity' requirement, the Supreme Court stated that
the predicate acts must amount to, or pose a threat of, continuing
racketeering activity. Id. According to the Supreme Court, continuity 'is both
a closed- and open-ended concept, referring to a closed period of repeated
conduct, or to past conduct that by its nature projects into the future with a
threat of repetition.' Id. A RICO plaintiff 'may demonstrate continuity over a
closed period by proving a series of related predicates extending over a
substantial period of time.' Id. Predicates extending over merely a few
weeks or months, on the other hand, may satisfy the continuity element if
there is a threat of repetition in the future. This latter concept of continuity,
which occurs over an 'open period,' is established by showing that the
predicate acts are a 'regular way of conducting the enterprise's ongoing
business.'
Summary
Concept of "continuity" in RICO cases, as defined by the Supreme Court in
H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co. It explains that continuity can be both
closed-ended and open-ended, with the latter being relevant when there is a
threat of future repetition of predicate acts. This aligns with the proposition
that the ongoing nature of the alleged RICO enterprise in the FAC, with its
potential for future predicate acts, satisfies the open-ended continuity
requirement.

=== PAGE 10 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
The RICO statute defines a 'pattern of racketeering activity' as at least two
acts of racketeering activity within a ten-year period. The Supreme Court
has clarified that two predicate acts are necessary but not sufficient to show
a pattern. A pattern also requires 'that the racketeering predicates are
related, and that they amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal
activity.' Continuity requires that the predicate acts extend over a
''substantial period of time'' and that ''the predicates themselves involve a
distinct threat of long-term racketeering activity. .. [or] are a regular way of
conducting the defendant's ongoing legitimate business or the RICO
enterprise.' The court examines 'both the duration of the related predicate
acts and the extensiveness of the RICO enterprise's scheme.'
Summary
The passage explains the requirements for establishing a pattern of
racketeering activity under RICO, emphasizing the need for related
predicate acts that pose a threat of continued criminal activity. It highlights
the concept of continuity, which can be open-ended and satisfied if the
predicate acts extend over a substantial period and involve a threat of long-
term racketeering activity. This aligns with the proposition that the ongoing
nature of the alleged scheme in the FAC, with a real risk of further predicate
acts, satisfies the continuity requirement for RICO purposes.

The 'continuity' prong is satisfied by proof of either closed-ended continuity
or open-ended continuity. Closed-ended continuity in the RICO context may
be demonstrated 'by proving a series of related predicates extending over a
substantial period of time.' Open-ended continuity in the RICO context is
conduct that may last only a short period of time but nonetheless poses a
threat of extending into the future. The Court suggested a case-by-case
examination of this issue, noting that the existence of a 'threat of continued
racketeering activity' is a function of particular facts. See H.J. Inc., 492 U.S.

Open-ended continuity, in contrast, requires proof of 'a threat of continued
racketeering activity.' Id. at 242. Under H.J. Inc., open-ended continuity may
be established in various ways. The Court furnished some examples. First, a
small number of related predicates occurring close together in time will
establish open-ended continuity if 'the racketeering acts themselves include
a specific threat of repetition extending indefinitely into the future, and thus
supply the requisite threat of continuity.' Second, the threat of continuity
may be established with a 'showing that the predicate acts or offenses are
part of an ongoing entity’s regular way of doing business.' Third, continuity
is proved 'if the predicates can be attributed to a defendant operating as
part of a long‑term association that exists for criminal purposes.' In any
case, the entity involved may be a legitimate business and need not be one
'traditionally grouped under the phrase ‘organized crime.’' Id. at 242–43.
Summary
Criteria for establishing open-ended continuity under RICO, as set forth in
H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co. It explains that continuity can be
demonstrated by showing a threat of continued racketeering activity, which
can be evidenced by a specific threat of repetition, predicate acts as part of
an ongoing business, or a long-term association for criminal purposes. This
directly supports the proposition that the FAC's allegations of ongoing
threats and predicate acts in the context of divorce litigation could meet the
open-ended continuity requirement.

Extract
The 'continuity' prong is satisfied by proof of either closed-ended continuity
or open-ended continuity. Closed-ended continuity is defined as 'a series of
related predicates extending over a substantial period of time.' Open-ended
continuity is defined as conduct that may last only a short period of time but
nonetheless, poses a threat of extending into the future. The Court
suggested a case-by-case examination of this issue, noting that the existence
of a 'threat of continued racketeering activity' is a function of particular
facts. The Court offered a non-exhaustive list of situations that may
constitute a pattern and stated 'development of these concepts must await
future cases.'

Summary
The concept of "continuity" under RICO can be satisfied by either closed-
ended or open-ended continuity. Open-ended continuity is particularly
relevant to the proposition as it involves conduct that poses a threat of
continuing into the future, which aligns with the ongoing nature of the
alleged RICO enterprise in the FAC. The passage supports the idea that the
court should consider the threat of continued criminal activity, which is
central to the proposition.

Extract
ICO purposes, an enterprise must exist independently from the racketeering
activity in which it engages, its groups must have a common or shared
purpose, and there must be at least some continuity of structure or
personnel. To constitute an enterprise, a group must have an ongoing
mechanism for directing the affairs of the group on an ongoing, rather than
an ad hoc, basis... H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 242 (suggesting open-ended
continuity can be satisfied by showing likelihood of predicate acts continuing
into the future or by showing that predicate acts occur in normal course of
entity's business)... Tabas, 47 F.3d at 1295 (holding defendant's activities
could satisfy open-ended continuity because plaintiffs showed evidence of
questionable expenses as an ongoing part of defendant's way of doing
business).
Summary
Requirements for establishing a RICO enterprise, emphasizing the need for
continuity and an ongoing mechanism for directing the group's affairs. It
references H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., which suggests that open-
ended continuity can be satisfied by showing a likelihood of predicate acts
continuing into the future. This aligns with the proposition that the alleged
RICO enterprise's objective is ongoing, and the risk of further predicate acts
is real, thus meeting the open-ended continuity requirement.

In H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co., (48) the Court held that the
government must establish both a relationship between the predicate acts
and continuity of those acts to prove a 'pattern'... (55.) See H.J. Inc., 492 U.S.
at 242 (suggesting open-ended continuity can be satisfied by showing
likelihood of predicate acts continuing into the future or by showing that
predicate acts occur in normal course of entity's business)... (63.) See
Blandford, 33 F.3d at 703 (opining that the Supreme Court in H.J. Inc.
'meant to craft a broad test of relatedness' and holding that predicate acts
were sufficiently related because they had similar purposes and results and
were otherwise 'interrelated by distinguishing characteristics').
Summary
The Supreme Court in H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co. established that
for a RICO pattern to exist, there must be both a relationship and continuity
of predicate acts. The concept of open-ended continuity is satisfied if there is
a likelihood of predicate acts continuing into the future or if they occur in
the normal course of the entity's business. This supports the proposition that
the ongoing nature of the alleged scheme in the FAC, with a real risk of
further predicate acts, meets the open-ended continuity requirement.

Accordingly, RICO’s pattern requirement may be satisfied in two ways: (i) by
alleging a long-running series of interrelated predicate acts constituting a
closed-ended conspiracy; or (ii) by alleging at least two interrelated
predicate acts and the distinct threat of continued racketeering activities,
demonstrating an open-ended conspiracy. The Supreme Court introduced
the closed-ended and open-ended standards in H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell
Telephone Co. to underscore the Court’s view that “there is something to a
RICO pattern beyond simply the number of predicate acts involved.” The
Court announced a two-prong “continuity plus relationship” test to
determine what constitutes a pattern under the statute. First, the
“relationship” prong is satisfied when the predicate acts have the same or
similar “purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of commission,
or otherwise are interrelated.” Second, the “continuity” prong is satisfied
either by a series of related predicate acts extending over a significant
period of time (closed-ended conspiracy), or a short-lived series of acts that
also establish a threat of long-term activity (open-ended conspiracy). The
“threat” of continued racketeering activity may be shown by evidence that
the predicate acts are part of the RICO defendant’s “regular way of doing

business” or that they are “a regular means of conducting or participating in
an ongoing RICO enterprise.”
Summary
The passage explains the two-prong test for establishing a RICO pattern,
emphasizing the open-ended continuity requirement. It highlights that
continuity can be demonstrated by a threat of ongoing criminal activity,
which aligns with the proposition that the enterprise's objective is ongoing
and poses a real risk of further predicate acts. The passage supports the
argument that the court should consider the broader, ongoing nature of the
alleged scheme rather than focusing solely on the primary objective being
achieved.

The continuity requirement is likewise satisfied where the predicates are a
regular way of conducting the defendant's ongoing legitimate business (in
the sense that it is not a business that exists for criminal purposes), or of
conducting or participating in an ongoing and legitimate RICO 'enterprise.'
A plaintiff may demonstrate a pattern by establishment that the predicate
acts pose a threat of continued criminal activity, which is generally
demonstrated by showing either: * Closed-ended continuity. Proving 'a series
of related predicate acts extending over a substantial period of time.' *
Open-ended continuity. A threat of 'continuing criminal activity extending
indefinitely into the future,' in light of the nature of the enterprise and
predicate acts alleged.
Summary
The continuity requirement for RICO can be satisfied by demonstrating
either closed-ended or open-ended continuity. Open-ended continuity is
particularly relevant here, as it involves a threat of continuing criminal
activity extending indefinitely into the future. This aligns with the
proposition that the alleged RICO enterprise's objective is ongoing, and the
risk of further predicate acts is real due to the ongoing divorce litigation.

Summary
The continuity requirement for RICO can be satisfied by demonstrating a
threat of continued criminal activity. This can be shown through open-ended
continuity, which involves a threat of ongoing criminal activity extending
indefinitely into the future. The passage supports the proposition by
explaining that the continuity requirement is met when the predicate acts
pose a threat of continued criminal activity, aligning with the FAC's
allegations of ongoing risks in the divorce litigation context.
