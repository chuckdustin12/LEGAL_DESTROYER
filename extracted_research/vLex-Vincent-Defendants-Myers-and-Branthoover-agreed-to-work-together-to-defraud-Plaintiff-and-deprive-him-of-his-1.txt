Question
Defendants Myers and Branthoover agreed to work together to defraud
Plaintiff and deprive him of his property and rights. Their coordinated
actions, including fraudulent filings and financial transactions, demonstrate
a shared intent to further the scheme. Under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d), a RICO
conspiracy claim requires proof that the defendants agreed to participate in
the conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity, as
held in *Salinas v. United States*, 522 U.S. 52 (1997). The facts demonstrate
that Defendants conspired to violate RICO by agreeing to engage in a
pattern of racketeering activity through their association-in-fact enterprise,
satisfying the elements of a RICO conspiracy claim.
Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
Defendants Myers and Branthoover's coordinated actions in defrauding the
Plaintiff fully satisfy the RICO conspiracy requirements under 18 U.S.C. §
1962(d) as interpreted by the Supreme Court in Salinas v. United States.
Their agreement to participate in a fraud scheme through coordinated
activities constitutes an association-in-fact enterprise engaged in a pattern
of racketeering activity, even if they did not each personally commit all the
predicate acts.
Summary
A conspiracy to violate the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations
Act (RICO) under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d) requires proof that defendants agreed
to participate in the conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of
racketeering activity. Based on the authorities reviewed, the coordinated
actions of Defendants Myers and Branthoover, including their fraudulent
filings and financial transactions demonstrating a shared intent to further a
scheme to defraud the Plaintiff and deprive him of property and rights,
satisfy the elements required for a RICO conspiracy claim.
The Supreme Court in Salinas v. United States, 522 U.S. 52 (1997)
established that a RICO conspiracy does not require proof that each
defendant personally committed or agreed to commit the predicate acts of
racketeering. Rather, it is sufficient to show that the defendants knew about
and agreed to facilitate the scheme with the intention of furthering the
criminal endeavor. Myers and Branthoover's conduct demonstrates they
formed an association-in-fact enterprise and knowingly agreed to pursue the
common objective of defrauding the Plaintiff through a pattern of
racketeering activity, thus fulfilling all required elements of a RICO
conspiracy claim under § 1962(d).

Legal Framework for RICO Conspiracy Claims
Statutory Basis
The statutory foundation for RICO conspiracy claims is found in 18 U.S.C. §
1962(d), which states: "It shall be unlawful for any person to conspire to
violate any of the provisions of subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section." 18
U.S.C. § 1962(d) (2025). This provision forms the legal basis for asserting
that a conspiracy to commit RICO violations is itself a violation under
federal law.
In the present case, the conspiracy allegation relates to a violation of §
1962(c), which prohibits "any person employed by or associated with any
enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign
commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of
such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity." Boyle v.
United States, 556 U.S. 938, 948 (2009) ("RICO makes it 'unlawful for any
person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the
activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or
participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs
through a pattern of racketeering activity.'").
Elements of a RICO Conspiracy Claim
To establish a RICO conspiracy under § 1962(d), the plaintiff must prove the
following elements:
An agreement between two or more people to commit a substantive
RICO offense;
Knowledge of and agreement to the overall objective of the RICO
offense.
United States v. Perry, 17-30610, 17-30611 (5th Cir. May 12, 2022) ("'The
elements of a RICO conspiracy are: (1) an agreement between two or more
people to commit a substantive RICO offense; and (2) knowledge of and
agreement to the overall objective of the RICO offense.'") (citing United
States v. Onyeri, 996 F.3d 274, 280 (5th Cir. 2021)).
These elements need not be proven through direct evidence but can be
established through circumstantial evidence. United States v. Delgado, 401
F.3d 290, 296 (5th Cir. 2005) ("These elements may be established by
circumstantial evidence."). The agreement, a defendant's guilty knowledge,
and a defendant's participation in the conspiracy may all be inferred from
the "development and collocation of circumstances." United States v.
Posada-Rios, 158 F.3d 832, 857 (5th Cir. 1998) ("'The agreement, a
defendant's guilty knowledge and a defendant's participation in the
conspiracy all may be inferred from the 'development and collocation of
circumstances.'").

Enterprise Requirement
A RICO conspiracy requires the existence (or potential existence) of an
"enterprise." RICO: A Primer (2022-01-31) ("To prove a violation of Section
1962(d), a plaintiff must prove the following elements: * The existence of an
enterprise (or that an enterprise would exist)").
Under RICO, an "enterprise" is defined as "any individual, partnership,
corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of
individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity." Portionpac
Chemical Corp. v. Sanitech Systems, 217 F.Supp.2d 1238, 1243 (M.D. Fla.
2002).
The Supreme Court has recognized that "[t]he enterprise is an entity, for
present purposes a group of persons associated together for a common
purpose of engaging in a course of conduct." U.S. v. International
Longshoremen's Ass'n, 518 F.Supp.2d 422, 470 (E.D.N.Y. 2007) (citing 
Salinas v. United States, 522 U.S. 52, 62 (1997)). The enterprise is "proved
by evidence of an ongoing organization, formal or informal, and by evidence
that the various associates function as a continuing unit." Id.
For an association-in-fact enterprise, the Supreme Court has held that any
type of association can satisfy the enterprise element as long as it consists of
"a group of persons associated together for a common purpose of engaging
in a course of conduct." Racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations
(2008-03-22).
Pattern of Racketeering Activity
A "pattern of racketeering activity" requires "at least two acts of
racketeering activity, one of which occurred after the effective date of
[RICO] and the last of which occurred within ten years (excluding any term
of imprisonment) after the commission of a prior act of racketeering
activity." Portionpac Chemical Corp. v. Sanitech Systems, 217 F.Supp.2d
1238, 1243 (M.D. Fla. 2002) (citing 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5)).
Unlike the general conspiracy statute, § 1962(d) requires no "overt act or
specific act" in carrying it forward. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Warren
Chiropractic & Rehab Clinic P.C., Case No. 4:14-CV-11521 (E.D. Mich. Aug
10, 2015) (citing Salinas v. United States, 522 U.S. 52, 63 (1997)).
The Seminal Case: Salinas v. United States
The Supreme Court's decision in Salinas v. United States, 522 U.S. 52 (1997)
is central to the analysis of RICO conspiracy claims. In Salinas, the Court
held that a defendant can be convicted of conspiracy to violate RICO without
personally committing or agreeing to commit the predicate acts of
racketeering.
The Court stated: "To be convicted of conspiracy to violate RICO under
§1962(d), the conspirator need not himself have committed or agreed to

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
commit the two or more predicate acts, such as bribery, requisite for a
substantive RICO offense under §1962(c)." Salinas v. U.S., 522 U.S. 52, 63
(1997).
The Court further explained that § 1962(d) "is even more comprehensive
than the general conspiracy provision applicable to federal crimes, §371,
since it contains no requirement of an overt or specific act to effect the
conspiracy's object." Id. It is sufficient if "the defendant knew of and agreed
to the overall objective of the RICO offense." United States v. Jones, 873 F.3d
482, 489 (5th Cir. 2017) ("A co-conspirator needs only to have known of, and
agreed to, the overall objective of the RICO offense.").
In Salinas, the Court found sufficient evidence to support a RICO conspiracy
conviction where "the evidence showed that [another defendant] committed
at least two acts of racketeering activity when he accepted numerous bribes
and that Salinas knew about and agreed to facilitate the scheme." Salinas v.
U.S., 522 U.S. 52, 66 (1997).
Analysis of Myers and Branthoover's Conduct
Agreement Between Myers and Branthoover
The facts indicate that "Defendants Myers and Branthoover agreed to work
together to defraud Plaintiff and deprive him of his property and rights."
This agreement satisfies the first element of a RICO conspiracy claim, which
requires "an agreement between two or more people to commit a
substantive RICO offense." United States v. Perry, 17-30610, 17-30611 (5th
Cir. May 12, 2022).
Courts have consistently held that an agreement may be inferred from
circumstances and the conduct of the defendants. United States v. Posada-
Rios, 158 F.3d 832, 857 (5th Cir. 1998) ("The agreement, a defendant's guilty
knowledge and a defendant's participation in the conspiracy all may be
inferred from the 'development and collocation of circumstances.'"). Here,
the "coordinated actions" of Myers and Branthoover, "including fraudulent
filings and financial transactions," provide circumstantial evidence of their
agreement to participate in a fraudulent scheme.
Knowledge and Intent
The facts state that Myers and Branthoover's actions "demonstrate a shared
intent to further the scheme." This satisfies the second element of a RICO
conspiracy claim, which requires "knowledge of and agreement to the
overall objective of the RICO offense." United States v. Perry, 17-30610,
17-30611 (5th Cir. May 12, 2022).
The intent to join a RICO conspiracy "can be inferred from Defendants'
subsequent conduct in light of evidence evincing their actual or constructive
knowledge." Kruse v. Repp, 543 F.Supp.3d 654 (S.D. Iowa 2021). In this
case, the "coordinated actions" of Myers and Branthoover, which include

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
"fraudulent filings and financial transactions," provide evidence of their
knowledge and intent to participate in the fraudulent scheme.
Association-in-Fact Enterprise
Myers and Branthoover's coordinated efforts to defraud the Plaintiff
constitute an association-in-fact enterprise under RICO. The Supreme Court
has recognized that an enterprise can be "a group of persons associated
together for a common purpose of engaging in a course of conduct." U.S. v.
International Longshoremen's Ass'n, 518 F.Supp.2d 422, 470 (E.D.N.Y.
2007).
Their coordinated actions and shared intent to further the scheme
demonstrate that they formed "a group with a common purpose and course
of conduct." Boyle v. United States, 129 S.Ct. 2237, 2245 (2009). This
association-in-fact enterprise satisfies the enterprise requirement for a RICO
conspiracy claim.
Pattern of Racketeering Activity
The "fraudulent filings and financial transactions" described in the facts
suggest a pattern of racketeering activity. A pattern of racketeering activity
requires at least two acts of racketeering activity within a ten-year period. 
Portionpac Chemical Corp. v. Sanitech Systems, 217 F.Supp.2d 1238, 1243
(M.D. Fla. 2002).
However, under § 1962(d), it is not necessary for each defendant to have
committed or agreed to commit two predicate acts. Salinas v. U.S., 522 U.S.
52, 63 (1997) ("To be convicted of conspiracy to violate RICO under
§1962(d), the conspirator need not himself have committed or agreed to
commit the two or more predicate acts."). It is sufficient that they agreed to
participate in a scheme that would involve a pattern of racketeering activity.
Application of Post-Salinas Case Law
Numerous cases following Salinas have reinforced and clarified its holding.
These cases provide additional support for the proposition that Myers and
Branthoover's conduct satisfies the requirements for a RICO conspiracy
claim.
No Need for Personal Commission of Predicate Acts
Courts have consistently held that a defendant need not personally commit
or agree to commit predicate acts to be liable for a RICO conspiracy. United
States v. Fowler, 535 F.3d 408, 421 (6th Cir. 2008) ("Unlike a substantive
RICO charge, a RICO conspiracy charge does not require proof that the
defendant committed any predicate acts. ... Indeed, a RICO conspiracy
charge does not even require proof that the defendant 'agreed to commit
two predicate acts himself, or even that any overt acts have been
committed.'") (citing Salinas, 522 U.S. at 63).

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
This principle is directly applicable to Myers and Branthoover. Even if one of
them did not personally commit predicate acts, they can still be liable for a
RICO conspiracy if they knew about and agreed to facilitate the scheme.
Agreement to Overall Objective
Courts have emphasized that a RICO conspiracy requires only that the
defendant knew of and agreed to the overall objective of the RICO offense. 
United States v. Jones, 873 F.3d 482, 489 (5th Cir. 2017) ("A co-conspirator
needs only to have known of, and agreed to, the overall objective of the
RICO offense.").
The facts indicate that Myers and Branthoover had a "shared intent to
further the scheme," which demonstrates their knowledge of and agreement
to the overall objective of the fraudulent enterprise.
Circumstantial Evidence
Courts have recognized that the elements of a RICO conspiracy can be
established through circumstantial evidence. United States v. Delgado, 401
F.3d 290, 296 (5th Cir. 2005) ("These elements may be established by
circumstantial evidence.").
The "coordinated actions" of Myers and Branthoover, "including fraudulent
filings and financial transactions," provide circumstantial evidence of their
agreement to participate in a RICO conspiracy.
Division of Labor
Courts have also recognized that conspirators can divide up the work while
still being responsible for the acts of each other. RICO: A Primer
(2022-01-31) ("The partners in the criminal plan must agree to pursue the
same criminal objective and may divide up the work, yet each is responsible
for the acts of each other. If conspirators have a plan which calls for some
conspirators to perpetrate the crime and others to provide support, the
supporters are as guilty as the perpetrators.").
This principle applies to Myers and Branthoover's "coordinated actions,"
which suggest a division of labor in furthering their fraudulent scheme.
Recent Developments in RICO Conspiracy Law
Recent cases have continued to apply and refine the principles established
in Salinas, providing additional support for the proposition that Myers and
Branthoover's conduct constitutes a RICO conspiracy.
In United States v. Householder, 1:20-cr-77 (S.D. Ohio Jan 03, 2023), the
court emphasized that "the focus of RICO conspiracy is the defendant's
agreement to participate in the conduct of the affairs of the enterprise
through a pattern of racketeering activity; not the defendant's agreement to
commit a predicate racketeering act." This reinforces the principle that a

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
RICO conspiracy charge focuses on the agreement to participate in the
enterprise's affairs, not on the commission of specific predicate acts.
The court also noted that "the RICO conspiracy statute in particular is
intentionally drafted to cast a wider net than a general conspiracy charge."
Id. This broad interpretation of the RICO conspiracy statute supports the
conclusion that Myers and Branthoover's agreement to defraud the Plaintiff
falls within the scope of § 1962(d).
Potential Challenges and Counterarguments
Sufficiency of the Enterprise
One potential challenge to a RICO conspiracy claim against Myers and
Branthoover could be that their association does not constitute an enterprise
under RICO. However, the Supreme Court has adopted a broad
interpretation of the enterprise requirement, recognizing that an enterprise
can be "a group of persons associated together for a common purpose of
engaging in a course of conduct." U.S. v. International Longshoremen's
Ass'n, 518 F.Supp.2d 422, 470 (E.D.N.Y. 2007).
In Boyle v. United States, 129 S.Ct. 2237 (2009), the Supreme Court clarified
that an association-in-fact enterprise requires only "a group with a common
purpose and course of conduct." The coordinated actions of Myers and
Branthoover in furthering their fraudulent scheme satisfy this requirement.
Sufficiency of the Conspiracy
Another potential challenge could be that there is insufficient evidence of a
conspiracy between Myers and Branthoover. However, courts have
consistently held that a conspiracy can be proven through circumstantial
evidence. United States v. Delgado, 401 F.3d 290, 296 (5th Cir. 2005)
("These elements may be established by circumstantial evidence.").
The "coordinated actions" of Myers and Branthoover, "including fraudulent
filings and financial transactions," provide circumstantial evidence of their
agreement to participate in a fraudulent scheme. Their "shared intent to
further the scheme" further supports the existence of a conspiracy.
Interstate Commerce Requirement
A RICO enterprise must engage in or affect interstate commerce. United
States v. Nicholson, No. 15-1963, No. 15-1966, No. 15-1998 (6th Cir. Nov 17,
2017) ("Therefore, to sustain these convictions, the government must have
shown that each defendant agreed (1) to associate with an enterprise that
has activities affecting interstate commerce...").
The facts do not explicitly address the interstate commerce requirement.
However, courts have generally interpreted this requirement broadly, and it
may be satisfied by minimal effects on interstate commerce. If the
fraudulent scheme involved interstate communications, transactions, or

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
other activities that affect interstate commerce, this requirement would be
met.
Subsequent Negative Treatment of
Authorities
It is important to note that Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection
Corporation, 503 U.S. 258 (1992) was stated as vacated by State v. Swafford,
654 S.E.2d 297, 375 S.C. 637 (S.C. App. 2007). However, this subsequent
treatment does not significantly impact the analysis of the RICO conspiracy
claim against Myers and Branthoover. Holmes primarily addressed the issue
of proximate causation in RICO claims, which is not directly relevant to the
elements of a RICO conspiracy under § 1962(d). The core principles of RICO
conspiracy law established in Salinas and followed in subsequent cases
remain valid and applicable to the present case.
Additionally, the materials indicate that the citations to 18 U.S.C. § 1962 in
the provided cases rely on older versions of the statute, as the last
amendment was made in 2025. However, the fundamental principles of
RICO conspiracy law under § 1962(d) have remained consistent, and the
2025 version of the statute maintains the prohibition on conspiring to violate
the substantive RICO provisions.
Conclusion
Based on the comprehensive examination of RICO conspiracy law,
Defendants Myers and Branthoover's coordinated actions in defrauding the
Plaintiff satisfy the elements required for a RICO conspiracy claim under 18
U.S.C. § 1962(d).
Under the Supreme Court's interpretation in Salinas v. United States, 522
U.S. 52 (1997), a RICO conspiracy requires only that the defendants agreed
to facilitate a scheme that would involve the operation of an enterprise
through a pattern of racketeering activity. It is not necessary for each
defendant to have committed or agreed to commit the predicate acts
themselves.
The coordinated actions of Myers and Branthoover, including fraudulent
filings and financial transactions, provide circumstantial evidence of their
agreement to participate in a fraudulent scheme. Their shared intent to
further the scheme demonstrates their knowledge of and agreement to the
overall objective of the RICO offense.
Their association for the purpose of defrauding the Plaintiff constitutes an
association-in-fact enterprise under RICO, and their fraudulent activities
suggest a pattern of racketeering activity. Even if one of them did not
personally commit predicate acts, they can still be liable for a RICO
conspiracy based on their knowledge of and agreement to facilitate the
scheme.

=== PAGE 9 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Numerous cases following Salinas have reinforced and clarified its holding,
providing additional support for the proposition that Myers and
Branthoover's conduct satisfies the requirements for a RICO conspiracy
claim. Recent developments in RICO conspiracy law have continued to apply
and refine these principles, further supporting this conclusion.
While potential challenges exist, including questions about the sufficiency of
the enterprise, the conspiracy, and the interstate commerce requirement,
the weight of legal authority supports the conclusion that Myers and
Branthoover conspired to violate RICO by agreeing to engage in a pattern of
racketeering activity through their association-in-fact enterprise, thus
satisfying the elements of a RICO conspiracy claim under § 1962(d).
Legal Authorities
Salinas v. U.S., 522 U.S. 52, 118 S.Ct. 469, 139 L.Ed.2d 352 (1997)
U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
To be convicted of conspiracy to violate RICO under §1962(d), the
conspirator need not himself have committed or agreed to commit the two
or more predicate acts, such as bribery, requisite for a substantive RICO
offense under §1962(c). Section 1962(d)-which forbids 'any person to
conspire to violate' §1962(c)-is even more comprehensive than the general
conspiracy provision applicable to federal crimes, §371, since it contains no
requirement of an overt or specific act to effect the conspiracy's object... In
the case before us, even if Salinas did not accept or agree to accept two
bribes, there was ample evidence that he conspired to violate subsection (c).
The evidence showed that Marmolejo committed at least two acts of
racketeering activity when he accepted numerous bribes and that Salinas
knew about and agreed to facilitate the scheme. This is sufficient to support
a conviction under §1962(d).
Summary
Under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d), a defendant can be convicted of a RICO
conspiracy without personally committing or agreeing to commit the
predicate acts of racketeering. It is sufficient if the defendant agreed to the
overall objective of the conspiracy and knew about the scheme. This
supports the proposition that Myers and Branthoover could be found liable
for a RICO conspiracy if they agreed to the fraudulent scheme, even if they
did not personally commit all the predicate acts.
State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Warren Chiropractic & Rehab Clinic P.C.,
Case No. 4:14-CV-11521 (E.D. Mich. Aug 10, 2015)
U.S. District Court — Eastern District of Michigan

=== PAGE 10 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d), a defendant may be liable for RICO
conspiracy if he or she 'conspire[s] to violate any of the provisions of
subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section,' i.e., the substantive RICO offenses.
'Unlike the general conspiracy statute, § 1962(d) requires no 'overt act or
specific act' in carrying it forward.' United States v. Corrado, 227 F.3d 543,
553-554 (6th Cir. 2000) (citing Salinas v. United States, 522 U.S. 52, 63
(1997)). '[S]upporters are as guilty as... perpetrators... [S]o long as they
share a common purpose, conspirators are liable for the acts of their co-
conspirators.'
Summary
The passage explains that under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d), a RICO conspiracy
does not require an overt act, only an agreement to participate in the
conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. The
reference to *Salinas v. United States* supports the idea that conspirators
are liable if they share a common purpose, even if they do not commit overt
acts themselves. This aligns with the proposition that Myers and
Branthoover conspired to violate RICO by agreeing to engage in
racketeering activity.
United States v. Nicholson, No. 15-1963, No. 15-1966, No. 15-1998 (6th Cir.
Nov 17, 2017)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Sixth Circuit
Extract
To be convicted of RICO conspiracy, a defendant must intend to further an
endeavor that, if completed, would satisfy all elements of a RICO offense.
Salinas v. United States, 522 U.S. 52, 65 (1997); United States v. Fowler, 535
F.3d 408, 421 (6th Cir. 2008). Defendants were charged with conspiring to
violate § 1962(c). Therefore, to sustain these convictions, the government
must have shown that each defendant agreed (1) to associate with an
enterprise that has activities affecting interstate commerce; (2) to
participate in the conduct of the enterprise's affairs; and (3) that either he or
another conspirator would engage in a pattern of racketeering activity. See
Fowler, 535 F.3d at 418; see also 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c)-(d).
Summary
For a RICO conspiracy conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d), it is necessary
to show that the defendants agreed to associate with an enterprise affecting
interstate commerce, participate in its affairs, and that either they or
another conspirator would engage in a pattern of racketeering activity. This
aligns with the proposition that Defendants Myers and Branthoover

conspired to violate RICO by engaging in a pattern of racketeering activity
through their association-in-fact enterprise.
U.S. v. Hewes, 729 F.2d 1302 (11th Cir. 1984)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Eleventh Circuit
Extract
The allegation in the RICO conspiracy count was that the defendant[s]
agreed to further a racketeering enterprise through a pattern of
racketeering activity. The diverse parties were tied together through the
overall scheme and the concept of the illegal enterprise. The overt acts and
substantive predicate crimes that were alleged in the indictment to have
furthered the pattern of racketeering were sufficiently connected that their
interrelationship constituted an offense of a series of acts or transactions.
Summary
The passage from "U.S. v. Hewes" discusses the requirements for a RICO
conspiracy, emphasizing that defendants must agree to further a
racketeering enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. It
highlights that the diverse parties involved in the conspiracy are connected
through the overall scheme and the illegal enterprise. This aligns with the
proposition that Defendants Myers and Branthoover conspired to violate
RICO by engaging in a pattern of racketeering activity. The passage
supports the idea that their coordinated actions and shared intent to further
the scheme satisfy the elements of a RICO conspiracy claim.
United States v. Rodr&iacute;guez-Torres, 939 F.3d 16 (1st Cir. 2019)
U.S. Court of Appeals — First Circuit
Extract
RICO makes it a crime 'for any person employed by or associated with any
enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign
commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of
[an] enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity' — or to
conspire to do so. See 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), (d). Broadly speaking (we will
have more to say on this below), a RICO-conspiracy conviction requires
proof that the defendant knowingly joined the conspiracy, agreeing with one
or more coconspirators 'to further [the] endeavor which, if completed, would
satisfy all the elements of a substantive [RICO] offense.'

=== PAGE 12 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
Elements required for a RICO-conspiracy conviction, emphasizing that a
defendant must knowingly join a conspiracy with the intent to further an
endeavor that would satisfy the elements of a substantive RICO offense. This
aligns with the proposition that Defendants Myers and Branthoover
conspired to engage in a pattern of racketeering activity, as it highlights the
necessity of an agreement to participate in the conduct of an enterprise
through such activity.
U.S. v Tocco, 135 F.3d 116 (2000)
U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
Proof of a charge under § 1962(d) requires proof that the association or
enterprise existed and that the named defendants were associated with and
agreed to participate in the conduct of its affairs, which affect interstate
commerce, through a pattern of racketeering activity... Tocco claims that the
evidence did not show a pattern of racketeering. To show a pattern of
racketeering activity conspiracy, a defendant need not personally agree to
commit two predicate acts; rather, he need only 'kn[ow] about and agree[ ]
to facilitate the scheme.' Salinas v. United States, 522 U.S. 52, 66 (1997).
Further, a defendant need not know about every member and component of
the enterprise; he need only know 'the general nature of the enterprise and
that the enterprise extends beyond his role.'
Summary
A defendant does not need to personally commit predicate acts but must
know about and agree to facilitate the scheme. This aligns with the
proposition that Defendants Myers and Branthoover conspired to violate

Summary
Elements required to establish a RICO conspiracy, which include an
agreement between two or more people to commit a substantive RICO
offense and knowledge of and agreement to the overall objective of the RICO
offense. It also emphasizes that these elements can be established through
circumstantial evidence, and a co-conspirator only needs to have known of
and agreed to the overall objective of the RICO offense. This supports the
proposition that Defendants Myers and Branthoover conspired to violate
RICO by agreeing to engage in a pattern of racketeering activity.
Allstate Ins. Co. v. Benhamou, 190 F.Supp.3d 631 (S.D. Tex. 2016)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of Texas
Extract
In order to demonstrate a RICO conspiracy under § 1962(d), a plaintiff must
demonstrate that (1) two or more people agreed to commit a substantive
RICO offense, and (2) the defendant knew of and agreed to the overall
objective of the RICO offense. Chaney v. Dreyfus Serv. Corp., 595 F.3d 219,
239 (5th Cir.2010) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). In the
RICO criminal context, a person need not commit or agree to commit
predicate acts to be held liable. Salinas v. United States, 522 U.S. 52, 63–64,
118 S.Ct. 469, 139 L.Ed.2d 352.
Summary
Requirements for establishing a RICO conspiracy under § 1962(d), which
include an agreement between two or more people to commit a substantive
RICO offense and knowledge of the overall objective of the RICO offense. It
references *Salinas v. United States*, which supports the notion that a
person need not commit predicate acts to be held liable in a RICO
conspiracy. This aligns with the proposition that Defendants Myers and
Branthoover conspired to violate RICO by agreeing to engage in a pattern of
racketeering activity.

Kruse v. Repp, 543 F.Supp.3d 654 (S.D. Iowa 2021)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of Iowa
Extract
The decision to actively agree to further the endeavors of a racketeering
enterprise only requires knowledge of the conspiracy's general objective and
the intent to join the conspiracy. See Aguilar, 853 F.3d at 403. While
knowledge can be shown by actual knowledge or willful blindness, intent to
agree to join the conspiracy can be inferred from Defendants’ subsequent
conduct in light of evidence evincing their actual or constructive knowledge.
Summary
To establish a RICO conspiracy, it is sufficient to show that the defendants
had knowledge of the conspiracy's general objective and intended to join it.
This can be demonstrated through their conduct and evidence of their
knowledge, whether actual or constructive. This aligns with the proposition
that Defendants Myers and Branthoover conspired to violate RICO by
agreeing to engage in a pattern of racketeering activity.
Kruse v. Repp, 611 F.Supp.3d 666 (S.D. Iowa 2020)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of Iowa
Extract
In Salinas, the Supreme Court held the defendant-deputy could be found
guilty of a RICO conspiracy by merely facilitating a known bribery scheme
directed by his boss, the county sheriff: [E]ven if [the defendant] did not
accept or agree to accept two bribes, there was ample evidence that he
conspired to violate 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). The evidence showed that [the
sheriff] committed at least two acts of racketeering activity when he
accepted numerous bribes and that [the defendant] knew about and agreed
to facilitate the scheme. This is sufficient to support a conviction under §
1962(d).
Summary
A RICO conspiracy claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d) does not require proof
that a defendant agreed to commit specific predicate acts. Instead, it is
sufficient to show that the defendant agreed to facilitate the general
criminal objective of the racketeering scheme. This aligns with the
proposition that Defendants Myers and Branthoover conspired to violate
RICO by agreeing to engage in a pattern of racketeering activity, as their
coordinated actions demonstrate a shared intent to further the scheme.

U.S. v. International Longshoremen's Ass'n, 518 F.Supp.2d 422 (E.D. N.Y.
2007)
U.S. District Court — Eastern District of New York
Extract
The Supreme Court has recognized that '[t]he elements predominant in a [§
1962] subsection (c) violation are: (1) the conduct (2) of an enterprise (3)
through a pattern of racketeering activity' Salinas v. United States, 522 U.S.
52, 62, 118 S.Ct. 469, 139 L.Ed.2d 352 (1997)... The enterprise is an entity,
for present purposes a group of persons associated together for a common
purpose of engaging in a course of conduct. The pattern of racketeering
activity is, on the other hand, a series of criminal acts as defined by the
statute. The former is proved by evidence of an ongoing organization, formal
or informal, and by evidence that the various associates function as a
continuing unit.
Summary
Elements required to establish a RICO violation under § 1962(c), as
recognized by the Supreme Court in *Salinas v. United States*. It
emphasizes the need to prove both the existence of an enterprise and a
pattern of racketeering activity. The passage further explains that an
enterprise can be a group of individuals associated for a common purpose,
and the pattern of racketeering activity involves a series of criminal acts.
This directly supports the proposition that Defendants Myers and
Branthoover conspired to violate RICO by engaging in a pattern of
racketeering activity through their association-in-fact enterprise.
Smith v. Berg, 247 F.3d 532 (3rd Cir. 2001)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Third Circuit
Extract
Moreover, the Supreme Court provided an extensive discussion indicating
that RICO's conspiracy section-- section 1962(d) -- is to be interpreted in
light of the common law of criminal conspiracy and that all that is necessary
for such a conspiracy is that the conspirators share a common purpose. ... In
accord with the general principles of criminal conspiracy law, a defendant
may be held liable for conspiracy to violate section 1962(c) if he knowingly
agrees to facilitate a scheme which includes the operation or management
of a RICO enterprise.
Summary
The passage from "Smith v. Berg" clarifies that under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d), a
RICO conspiracy does not require each conspirator to participate in the

=== PAGE 16 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
operation or management of the enterprise. Instead, it is sufficient if the
conspirators share a common purpose and knowingly agree to facilitate a
scheme involving a RICO enterprise. This aligns with the proposition that
Defendants Myers and Branthoover conspired to engage in a pattern of
racketeering activity, as it emphasizes the shared intent and agreement to
further the scheme, which is central to establishing a RICO conspiracy.
Boyle v. United States, 129 S.Ct. 2237, 173 L.Ed.2d 1265, 556 U.S. 938, 77
USLW 4474 (2009)
U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
RICO makes it 'unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any
enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign
commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of
such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.' 18 U.S.C.
§ 1962(c) (emphasis added). ... Given that it is also unlawful to conspire to
violate § 1962(c), see § 1962(d), this comment provides no assurance that
RICO and § 371 offenses remain distinct. Only if proof of the enterprise
element—the 'group with a common purpose and course of conduct'—
requires evidence of activity or organization beyond that inherent in the
pattern of predicate acts will RICO offenses retain an identity distinct from §
371 offenses.
Summary
The passage from "Boyle v. United States" clarifies that for a RICO violation
under § 1962(c), there must be an enterprise engaged in activities affecting
interstate commerce, and the conduct must involve a pattern of racketeering
activity. Furthermore, § 1962(d) makes it unlawful to conspire to violate §
1962(c). The passage emphasizes the need for a "group with a common
purpose and course of conduct," which aligns with the proposition that
Myers and Branthoover conspired to engage in racketeering activity through
an association-in-fact enterprise.
Inc v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Company, 492 U.S. 229, 109 S.Ct. 2893,
106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989)
U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
RICO renders criminally and civilly liable 'any person' who uses or invests
income derived 'from a pattern of racketeering activity' to acquire an
interest in or to operate an enterprise engaged in interstate commerce, §
1962(a); who acquires or maintains an interest in or control of such an

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
enterprise 'through a pattern of racketeering activity,' § 1962(b); who, being
employed by or associated with such an enterprise, conducts or participates
in the conduct of its affairs 'through a pattern of racketeering activity,' §
1962(c); or, finally, who conspires to violate the first three subsections of §
1962, § 1962(d).
Summary
Liability under RICO is not limited to organized crime but extends to any
person or entity engaged in such activities. This supports the proposition
that Defendants Myers and Branthoover could be held liable under RICO for
conspiring to engage in a pattern of racketeering activity.
Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corporation, 503 U.S. 258, 112
S.Ct. 1311, 117 L.Ed.2d 532 (1992)
U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
Finally, the complaint concluded that their acts amounted to a 'pattern of
racketeering activity' within the meaning of the RICO statute, 18 U.S.C. §§
1962, 1961(1) and (5) (1988 ed. and Supp. I), so as to entitle the plaintiffs to
recover treble damages, § 1964(c). ... Section 1962 lists 'prohibited
activities.' Before this Court, SIPC invokes only subsections (c) and (d). ...
Subsection (d) makes it unlawful to conspire to violate subsection (c). The
RICO statute defines 'pattern of racketeering activity' as 'requir[ing] at least
two acts of racketeering activity. .. the last of which occurred within ten
years. .. after the commission of a prior act of racketeering activity.' §
1961(5).
Summary
Requirements for a RICO claim, including the need for a "pattern of
racketeering activity" and the unlawful nature of conspiring to violate RICO
provisions under subsection (d). This aligns with the proposition that
Defendants Myers and Branthoover conspired to engage in racketeering
activity, as the passage outlines the legal framework for such a conspiracy
under RICO.
U.S. v. Zichettello, 208 F.3d 72 (2nd Cir. 1998)

in furtherance thereof.'... Assuming that a RICO enterprise exists, the
government must prove only 'that the defendant[s]... know the general
nature of the conspiracy and that the conspiracy extends beyond [their]
individual role[s].'... see also Salinas, 118 S. Ct. at 478 (upholding conviction
under Section 1962(d) where defendant 'knew about and agreed to facilitate
the scheme').
Summary
A RICO conspiracy charge can be proven if the defendants embraced the
objective of the conspiracy and agreed to commit predicate acts in
furtherance of it. The passage also clarifies that the government only needs
to prove that the defendants knew the general nature of the conspiracy and
that it extended beyond their individual roles. This aligns with the
proposition that Defendants Myers and Branthoover conspired to violate
RICO by agreeing to engage in a pattern of racketeering activity.
United States v. Gurry, Criminal Action No. 16-cr-10343-ADB (D. Mass. Jan
17, 2019)
U.S. District Court — District of Massachusetts
Extract
Courts have interpreted these statutory provisions to require that a RICO
conspiracy indictment allege 'that the defendant knowingly joined a
conspiracy the objective of which was to operate that enterprise through an
identified pattern of racketeering activity.' United States v. Glecier, 923 F.2d
496, 500 (7th Cir. 1991); see Salinas v. United States, 522 U.S. 52, 66 (1997)
(holding that to prove a RICO conspiracy claim, it is sufficient to prove that
the defendant 'knew about and agreed to facilitate the scheme'); United
States v. Ortiz, No. C 12-00119 SI, 2013 WL 6842541, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Dec.
27, 2013) (applying Salinas and stating that '[i]t is sufficient that the
indictment alleges that [the defendant] knew about the enterprise's
racketeering activities and agreed to help facilitate them').
Summary
For a RICO conspiracy claim, it is sufficient to show that the defendants
knowingly joined a conspiracy with the objective of operating an enterprise
through a pattern of racketeering activity. The passage references the
*Salinas v. United States* case, which supports the proposition that an
agreement to facilitate a scheme is sufficient for a RICO conspiracy claim.
This aligns with the proposition that Defendants Myers and Branthoover
conspired to violate RICO by agreeing to engage in a pattern of racketeering
activity.
United States v. Householder, 1:20-cr-77 (S.D. Ohio Jan 03, 2023)

=== PAGE 19 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
U.S. District Court — Southern District of Ohio
Extract
The Government notes that 'the focus of RICO conspiracy is the defendant's
agreement to participate in the conduct of the affairs of the enterprise
through a pattern of racketeering activity; not the defendant's agreement to
commit a predicate racketeering act.' ... the Indictment alleges that the Co-
Defendants and others all constituted an 'enterprise' and further alleges that
the Co-Defendants 'did knowingly and intentionally conspire with each other
and with others known and unknown ... to conduct and participate directly
and indirectly, in the conduct of the affairs of the enterprise through a
pattern of racketeering.' ... the RICO conspiracy statute in particular is
intentionally drafted to cast a wider net than a general conspiracy charge. ...
For purposes of a RICO conspiracy, what matters is that 'the defendant
intended to further an endeavor which, if completed, would satisfy all of the
elements of a substantive [RICO] criminal offense [and] it suffices that he
adopt the goal of furthering or facilitating the criminal endeavor.'
Summary
The focus of a RICO conspiracy charge is on the agreement to participate in
the conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. The
passage emphasizes that the RICO conspiracy statute is broader than a
general conspiracy charge, as it does not require an overt act. The passage
also highlights that the intent to further a criminal endeavor that satisfies
the elements of a substantive RICO offense is sufficient for a RICO
conspiracy charge. This supports the proposition that Defendants Myers and
Branthoover's coordinated actions and shared intent to further a fraudulent
scheme could satisfy the elements of a RICO conspiracy claim.
Portionpac Chemical Corp. v. Sanitech Systems, 217 F.Supp.2d 1238 (M.D.
Fla. 2002)
U.S. District Court — Middle District of Florida
Extract
Congress designed the Federal Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act (RICO), Title 18, United States Code, Section 1961, et
seq. as a flexible tool to fight organized crime. As such, it makes the
following activities unlawful: ... (d) conspiring to violate any of the
provisions of Section 1962(a)-(c). 18 U.S.C. § 1962. ... To engage in a 'pattern
of racketeering activity,' the defendant must have participated in 'at least
two acts of racketeering activity, one of which occurred after the effective
date of [RICO] and the last of which occurred within ten years (excluding
any term of imprisonment) after the commission of a prior act of
racketeering activity.' 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5). Finally, 'enterprise' is defined
under the statute as 'any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals associated in fact
although not a legal entity.' Id. § 1961(c).
Summary
Elements of a RICO violation, including the unlawful act of conspiring to
violate provisions of Section 1962, which is directly relevant to the
proposition. It also explains the requirement of a "pattern of racketeering
activity" and defines "enterprise," both of which are necessary components
to establish a RICO conspiracy claim. This supports the proposition that
Defendants Myers and Branthoover's actions could be seen as a conspiracy
to violate RICO by engaging in a pattern of racketeering activity through
their association-in-fact enterprise.
U.S. v. Delgado, 401 F.3d 290 (5th Cir. 2005)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
The RICO Act criminalizes conspiracy to violate any of its substantive
provisions. 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d). 'To prove a RICO conspiracy, the
government must establish (1) that two or more people agreed to commit a
substantive RICO offense and (2) that the defendant knew of and agreed to
the overall objective of the RICO offense.' Posada-Rios, 158 F.3d at 857-58.
These elements may be established by circumstantial evidence. Id. Each
requirement is met here. First, there is sufficient evidence for a jury to find
that two or more people agreed to violate § 1962(c), which criminalizes
racketeering activity and the collection of unlawful debts. Evidence
presented at trial showed that TMM had many members, including Delgado,
who met frequently to discuss the interests of their organization and plan its
activities, including drug trafficking, the collection of drug debts, murder,
and robbery, as prohibited by RICO. Such evidence supports the jury's
determination that two or more people agreed to violate § 1962(c). Second,
there is ample evidence that Delgado agreed to the overall objective of the
conspiracy.
Summary
Legal framework that supports the proposition that Myers and Branthoover
could be found to have conspired to violate RICO if there is evidence of their
agreement to engage in a pattern of racketeering activity.
United States v. Onyeri, 996 F.3d 274 (5th Cir. 2021)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit

=== PAGE 21 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
Onyeri's challenge is specific to one offense of conviction: conspiring to
violate the RICO statute. The elements of a RICO conspiracy are: (1) an
agreement between two or more people to commit a substantive RICO
offense; and (2) knowledge of and agreement to the overall objective of the
RICO offense. United States v. Rosenthal, 805 F.3d 523, 530 (5th Cir. 2015);
see 18 U.S.C. § 1962. These elements may be established by circumstantial
evidence. United States v. Delgado, 401 F.3d 290, 296 (5th Cir. 2005). First,
there is sufficient evidence to find that two or more people agreed to violate
§ 1962(c), which criminalizes racketeering activity. Evidence presented at
trial showed that Onyeri engaged associates to assist him in carrying out his
many fraudulent schemes. They met to discuss the organization and plan
activities in furtherance of the enterprise, including mail fraud, wire fraud,
and murder, as prohibited by RICO.
Summary
The elements of a RICO conspiracy include an agreement between two or
more people to commit a substantive RICO offense and knowledge of and
agreement to the overall objective of the RICO offense. These elements can
be established by circumstantial evidence, as demonstrated in the Onyeri
case, where associates were engaged to assist in fraudulent schemes. This
supports the proposition that Defendants Myers and Branthoover could be
found to have conspired to violate RICO if similar evidence of agreement
and intent is present.
United States v. Rosenthal, 805 F.3d 523 (5th Cir. 2015)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
Under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d), at issue here, prohibits conspiracy to violate any
part of § 1962. 'The elements of a conspiracy under § 1962(d) are simply (1)
that two or more people agreed to commit a substantive RICO offense and
(2) that the defendant knew of and agreed to the overall objective of the
RICO offense.' United States v. Pratt, 728 F.3d 463, 477 (5th Cir.2013)
(emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omitted). ... 'One can be a
conspirator by agreeing to facilitate only some of the acts leading to the

offense and that the defendant knew of and agreed to the overall objective of
the RICO offense. It also references *Salinas v. United States*, which
supports the notion that a conspiracy can exist even if the substantive crime
does not occur, emphasizing the distinct and punishable nature of the
conspiracy itself. This aligns with the proposition that Defendants Myers and
Branthoover conspired to violate RICO by agreeing to engage in a pattern of
racketeering activity.
U.S. v. Glecier, 923 F.2d 496 (7th Cir. 1991)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Seventh Circuit
Extract
All that 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1962(d), the 'RICO conspiracy statute,' provides is
that it is unlawful 'to conspire to violate any of the provisions of subsections
(a), (b) or (c) of this section.' Section 1962(c), the familiar 'substantive' RICO
provision, criminalizes the participation in the affairs of an enterprise
affecting interstate commerce through a pattern of racketeering activity.
Section 1962(d), like all conspiracy provisions, has as its target the act of
agreement--here, the agreement to engage in activity that implicates section
1962(c).
Summary
Under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d), a RICO conspiracy involves an agreement to
violate the provisions of subsections (a), (b), or (c), specifically targeting the
act of agreement to engage in racketeering activity. This aligns with the
proposition that Defendants Myers and Branthoover conspired to engage in
a pattern of racketeering activity, as the statute and the court's
interpretation focus on the agreement to participate in such conduct.
United States v. Jones, 873 F.3d 482 (5th Cir. 2017)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
The evidence is sufficient on the RICO convictions. Conspiracy to violate any
of RICO's substantive provisions is a crime. See 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d). 'To
prove a RICO conspiracy, the government must establish (1) that two or
more people agreed to commit a substantive RICO offense and (2) that the
defendant knew of and agreed to the overall objective of the RICO offense.'
Posada-Rios, 158 F.3d at 857–58. 'The agreement, a defendant's guilty
knowledge and a defendant's participation in the conspiracy all may be
inferred from the development and collocation of circumstances.' Id. at 857.
A co-conspirator needs only to have known of, and agreed to, the overall
objective of the RICO offense.

=== PAGE 23 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
The passage provides a clear explanation of the elements required to
establish a RICO conspiracy claim. It emphasizes that an agreement
between two or more people to commit a RICO offense and the defendant's
knowledge and agreement to the overall objective are necessary. This
directly supports the proposition that Defendants Myers and Branthoover
conspired to violate RICO by agreeing to engage in a pattern of racketeering
activity.
U.S. v. Fowler, 535 F.3d 408 (6th Cir. 2008)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Sixth Circuit
Extract
Fowler was not entitled to a directed verdict on the RICO conspiracy charge
either. His willful participation in the robbery and murder of Charles Hurst
alone satisfies the requirements for a RICO conspiracy conviction because it
shows that he 'intended to further `an endeavor which, if completed, would
satisfy all of the elements of a substantive [RICO] criminal offense....''
United States v. Saadey, 393 F.3d 669, 676 (6th Cir.2005) (quoting Salinas v.
United States, 522 U.S. 52, 65, 118 S.Ct. 469, 139 L.Ed.2d 352 (1997)). ...
Unlike a substantive RICO charge, a RICO conspiracy charge does not
require proof that the defendant committed any predicate acts. See id.
(citing Salinas, 522 U.S. at 63, 118 S.Ct. 469). Indeed, a RICO conspiracy
charge does not even require proof that the defendant 'agreed to commit
two predicate acts himself, or even that any overt acts have been
committed.' Id. (citing Salinas, 522 U.S. at 63, 118 S.Ct. 469). To the
contrary, it merely requires proof that the defendant 'intended to further `an
endeavor which, if completed, would satisfy all of the elements of a
substantive [RICO] criminal offense [and] it suffices that he adopt the goal of
furthering or facilitating the criminal endeavor.'' Id. (quoting Salinas, 522
U.S. at 65, 118 S.Ct. 469).
Summary
A RICO conspiracy charge does not require proof of the commission of
predicate acts or even an agreement to commit them. Instead, it requires
proof of intent to further an endeavor that would satisfy the elements of a
substantive RICO offense. This aligns with the proposition that Myers and
Branthoover's coordinated actions and shared intent to defraud the Plaintiff
could satisfy the elements of a RICO conspiracy claim under 18 U.S.C. §
1962(d).

Extract
Salinas, moreover, summarizes these conspiracy principles applicable to the
RICO charges in counts one and two: 'A conspiracy may exist even if a
conspirator does not agree to commit or facilitate every part of the
substantive offense. See United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U.S.
150, 253-54 (1940).' Id. at 63 (emphasis added). We agree that 'it is not
determinative that the defendant committed the crime to further his own
agenda, if indeed he was only able to commit the crime by virtue of his
position within the enterprise.' Id.; see also United States v. Indelicato, 865
F.2d 1370, 1383 (2d Cir. 1989) (en banc).
Summary
The passage from "U.S. v. Corrado" references the principles established in
*Salinas v. United States*, which are directly relevant to RICO conspiracy
claims. It emphasizes that a conspiracy can exist even if a conspirator does
not agree to commit every part of the substantive offense, aligning with the
proposition that Myers and Branthoover conspired to violate RICO. The
passage supports the idea that their coordinated actions, even if not directly
linked to every part of the scheme, demonstrate a shared intent to further
the conspiracy.
U.S. v. Posada-Rios, 158 F.3d 832 (5th Cir. 1998)

To prove a RICO conspiracy the government must establish (1) that two or
more people agreed to commit a substantive RICO offense and (2) that the
defendant knew of and agreed to the overall objective of the RICO offense.
See Marmolejo, 89 F.3d at 1196-97. The government is not required to prove
a conspiracy through direct evidence. Because conspirators normally
attempt to conceal their conduct, the elements of a conspiracy offense may
be established solely by circumstantial evidence. See United States v.
Espinoza-Seanez, 862 F.2d 526, 537 (5th Cir.1988). 'The agreement, a
defendant's guilty knowledge and a defendant's participation in the
conspiracy all may be inferred from the 'development and collocation of
circumstances.'
Summary
Elements required to prove a RICO conspiracy, which include an agreement
between two or more people to commit a substantive RICO offense and the
defendant's knowledge and agreement to the overall objective. It also
emphasizes that direct evidence is not necessary, and circumstantial
evidence can be used to establish the elements of a conspiracy. This
supports the proposition that Defendants Myers and Branthoover could be

found to have conspired to violate RICO based on their coordinated actions
and shared intent, even if direct evidence of their agreement is not
available.

Summary
The passage explains that the existence of racketeering activity and an
enterprise are distinct but related elements of a RICO charge. It also
clarifies that for a RICO conspiracy claim under § 1962(d), the plaintiff must
demonstrate that the injuries arose from a predicate act that is
independently wrongful. This supports the proposition by highlighting the
need for a shared intent to engage in a pattern of racketeering activity,
which is central to proving a RICO conspiracy.

The existence of an association-in-fact requires the more difficult showing
that 'a group of persons associated together for a common purpose of
engaging in a course of conduct.' According to the Supreme Court, any type
of association can satisfy the enterprise element as long as it meets this
definition. As a result, courts have found a broad array of groups and
organizations to constitute associations-in-fact... See Salinas v. United
States, 522 U.S. 52, 61-66 (1997) (upholding conspiracy conviction where
defendant did not accept or agree to accept two bribes but still knew about
and agreed to facilitate a racketeering scheme involving bribery).
Summary
The existence of an association-in-fact enterprise under RICO requires
showing that a group of persons is associated for a common purpose of
engaging in a course of conduct. The Supreme Court has recognized that
any type of association can satisfy this element if it meets the definition. The
passage also references *Salinas v. United States*, which supports the idea
that a defendant can be convicted of a RICO conspiracy even if they did not

rather than the victim of that activity. Subsection (c) makes it unlawful for
'any person employed by or associated with any enterprise ... to conduct or
participate ... in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of
racketeering activity' .... Consequently, since the enterprise in subsection (c)
is not being acquired, it need not have a property interest that can be
acquired nor an economic motive for engaging in illegal activity; it need only
be an association-in-fact that engages in a pattern of racketeering activity.
Summary
The passage references the Supreme Court case *Salinas v. United States*,
which is directly relevant to RICO conspiracy claims. It highlights that a
defendant can be convicted of a RICO conspiracy even if they did not
commit or agree to commit the predicate acts themselves, as long as they
knew about and agreed to facilitate the scheme. This supports the
proposition that Defendants Myers and Branthoover could be found to have
conspired to violate RICO by agreeing to engage in a pattern of racketeering
activity through their association-in-fact enterprise.

Extract
A RICO offense requires two or more predicate acts of 'racketeering
activity.' (31) RICO defendants need not be convicted of each underlying
offense before a RICO offense is charged. (32) In fact, offenses of which the
defendant has been acquitted nonetheless may serve as the basis of a RICO
offense. (33)... See Salinas v. United States, 522 U.S. 52, 61-66 (1997)
(upholding conspiracy conviction where defendant did not accept or agree to
accept two bribes but still knew about and agreed to facilitate a
racketeering scheme involving bribery); see also United States v. Zichettello,
208 F.3d 72, 100 (2d Cir. 2000) ('To be convicted as a conspirator, one must
be shown to have possessed knowledge of only the general contours of the
conspiracy').
Summary
A RICO offense requires two or more predicate acts of racketeering activity,
and a defendant can be charged with a RICO offense even if not convicted of
each underlying offense. The passage also references *Salinas v. United
States*, which supports the idea that a defendant can be convicted of
conspiracy if they knew about and agreed to facilitate a racketeering
scheme, even if they did not directly commit the acts. This aligns with the
proposition that Defendants Myers and Branthoover conspired to engage in
a pattern of racketeering activity.

Summary
The passage from *Salinas v. United States* supports the proposition by
illustrating that a RICO conspiracy conviction does not require a defendant
to have directly engaged in all acts of racketeering. Instead, it is sufficient
for the defendant to have knowledge of the conspiracy's general contours
and to agree to facilitate the scheme. This aligns with the proposition that
Defendants Myers and Branthoover conspired to violate RICO by agreeing to
engage in a pattern of racketeering activity.

Prosecutors prove the existence of an enterprise 'by evidence of an ongoing
organization, formal or informal, and by evidence that the various associates
function as a continuing unit.'... The Eighth Circuit requires the government
to demonstrate that the alleged enterprise functions as a continuing unit,
has an 'ascertainable structure' distinct from that inherent in the conduct of
a pattern of racketeering activity, and has associates who have a common or
shared purpose.

Section 1962(d) prohibits 'any person' from conspiring to violate any
provision of § 1962.165 A defendant does not need to commit an overt act to
be found liable for conspiracy.166 Rather, as the Supreme Court held in
Salinas v. United States, 522 U.S. 52, 66 (holding that even though the
defendant did not commit the two predicate acts required to violate §
1962(c), he still violated § 1962(d) because he knowingly facilitated the
racketeering activity and 'conspired to violate subsection (c)').
Summary
The passage explains that under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d), a defendant can be
found liable for a RICO conspiracy even if they did not commit the predicate
acts themselves, as long as they knowingly facilitated the racketeering
activity. This aligns with the proposition that Defendants Myers and
Branthoover conspired to violate RICO by agreeing to engage in a pattern of
racketeering activity. The reference to *Salinas v. United States* supports
the idea that an agreement to participate in the conduct of an enterprise
through racketeering activity is sufficient for a RICO conspiracy claim.

Extract
RICO CONSPIRACY The essence of a RICO conspiracy is the existence of an
agreement to violate RICO's substantive provisions. RICO conspiracy was
established by proof of: (a) of an agreement to join a racketeering scheme,
(b) of the defendant's knowing engagement in the scheme with the intent
that its overall goals be effectuated, and (c) that the scheme involved, or by
agreement between any members of the conspiracy was intended to involve,
two or more predicate acts of racketeering.
Summary
Essential elements required to establish a RICO conspiracy, which include
an agreement to join a racketeering scheme, knowing engagement in the
scheme with intent, and involvement of two or more predicate acts of
racketeering. This directly supports the proposition that Defendants Myers
and Branthoover conspired to violate RICO by agreeing to engage in a
pattern of racketeering activity.

The Brief - American Bar Association - 2024-01-01
Extract
A violation of § 1962(c), the section on which Sedima relies, requires (1)
conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity. The plaintiff must allege each of the elements to state a claim. They
are all equally essential components, and the complaint will fail if any one of
them is not adequately pleaded. In particular, RICO claims based on mail or
wire fraud must comport with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b)’s
requirement that allegations involving fraud be pleaded with particularity...
A plaintiff only has standing to sue if they have been injured in their
business or property by conduct constituting the violation. To establish a §
1962(c) RICO claim, the following elements must be proven: • Enterprise: A
structured group of individuals associated for a common purpose. • Pattern
of racketeering activity: At least two acts of racketeering, as specified within
the statute, within 10 years. • Conduct: Directly or indirectly conducting the
enterprise’s affairs through racketeering. • Injury: An injury to business or
property due to the racketeering activity.
Summary
Essential elements required to establish a RICO claim under § 1962(c),
which includes conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering
activity. It emphasizes the need for a structured group of individuals
associated for a common purpose, which aligns with the proposition that
Defendants Myers and Branthoover conspired to defraud the Plaintiff. The
passage also highlights the necessity of proving injury to business or
property, which supports the claim that the Plaintiff was deprived of his
property and rights. The requirement for particularity in pleading fraud
underlines the need for detailed allegations, which is relevant to the
proposition's assertion of fraudulent filings and transactions.

RICO: A Primer
Extract
Under Section 1962(d), it is a violation to conspire to commit any of the
three substantive RICO offenses. To prove a violation of Section 1962(d), a
plaintiff must prove the following elements: * The existence of an enterprise
(or that an enterprise would exist); * That the enterprise was (or would be)
engaged in, or its activities affected (or would affect), interstate or foreign
commerce; and * That each defendant knowingly agreed that a conspirator
would commit a violation of 18 U.S.C. ' 1962(c). The Supreme Court held
that to establish a RICO conspiracy offense under Section 1962(d), there is
no requirement that the defendant 'himself committed or agreed to commit
the two predicate acts requisite for a substantive RICO offense under '
1962(c).' The Supreme Court explained: A conspiracy may exist even if a
conspirator does not agree to commit or facilitate each and every part of the
substantive offense. The partners in the criminal plan must agree to pursue
the same criminal objective and may divide up the work, yet each is
responsible for the acts of each other. If conspirators have a plan which calls
for some conspirators to perpetrate the crime and others to provide support,
the supporters are as guilty as the perpetrators.
Summary
Under Section 1962(d), a RICO conspiracy claim does not require each
defendant to commit or agree to commit the predicate acts themselves.
Instead, it requires proof of an agreement to pursue a shared criminal
objective, which aligns with the proposition that Defendants Myers and
Branthoover conspired to defraud the Plaintiff. The passage also highlights
that conspirators can divide roles, with some providing support, which
supports the idea of coordinated actions between the defendants.

passage also references the Supreme Court's interpretation in *Salinas v.

even if they did not commit every part of the substantive offense.
