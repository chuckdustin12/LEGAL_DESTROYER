Question
If an agreed temporary order, not adopted by the district judge, bears only
an associate judge's signature and explicitly requires the signatures of all
parties, but is missing the respondent and their counsel's signatures, is it
enforceable by law enforcement?
Answer (Texas)
Short response
A temporary order signed only by an associate judge that explicitly requires
signatures of all parties but is missing the respondent's and their counsel's
signatures is not enforceable by law enforcement. This order fails to satisfy
both the explicit signature requirements contained within the document
itself and the statutory requirements under Texas Family Code § 201.007 for
associate judges' orders.
Summary
Under Texas law, temporary orders signed by associate judges face two
critical requirements for enforceability. First, per Texas Family Code §
201.007, while associate judges have authority to render and sign temporary
orders, those orders that explicitly require signatures from all parties must
have those signatures to be valid. Second, Texas case law consistently holds
that a referring court (district judge) must adopt or otherwise approve an
associate judge's order for it to become enforceable as an order of the court.
In this scenario, the temporary order faces a dual enforceability problem: it
lacks the signatures explicitly required by its own terms, rendering it
incomplete and unenforceable according to its stated conditions, and it has
not been adopted by the district judge, meaning it has not obtained the
necessary judicial approval to become an enforceable court order. These
deficiencies would prevent law enforcement from enforcing the order, as it
fails to meet the statutory requirements for enforceability under Texas
Family Code § 201.007 and applicable case law.
Background and Relevant Law
Statutory Framework: Powers of Associate Judges
The legal framework governing the authority of associate judges in Texas is
primarily established by Texas Family Code § 201.007, which delineates the
powers held by associate judges and the requirements for their orders to
become enforceable.
According to Tex. Fam. Code § 201.007, an associate judge has the authority
to "render and sign: (A) a final order agreed to in writing as to both form

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
and substance by all parties; (B) a final default order; (C) a temporary order;
or (D) a final order in a case in which a party files an unrevoked waiver
made in accordance with Rule 119, Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, that
waives notice to the party of the final hearing or waives the party's
appearance at the final hearing." This power exists "without prejudice to the
right to a de novo hearing before the referring court under Section FAMILY
CODE 201.015 and subject to Subsection (c)."
While the statute clearly grants associate judges the authority to sign
temporary orders, it also establishes important conditions—particularly for
agreed orders, which must be "agreed to in writing as to both form and
substance by all parties." This requirement suggests that when an order is
characterized as "agreed," it must bear the signatures of all relevant parties
to be valid.
Case Law Interpreting Associate Judges' Authority
Texas courts have consistently addressed the requirements for enforceability
of orders signed by associate judges, providing clear guidance on when such
orders become enforceable.
Requirement for District Court Approval
In K.E.B. v. Off. of Att'y Gen. of Tex., 698 S.W.3d 76 (Tex. App. 2024), the
Texas Court of Appeals addressed a situation where an associate judge
issued a letter report with findings and signed a proposed order. The court
held that "the referring court was required to sign this order or take some
other action to adopt or modify the order proposed by the associate judge
before a final order could be rendered." This case establishes the principle
that an associate judge's order requires adoption or modification by the
district court before it can be considered final and enforceable.
Similarly, in In re M.K.R., 216 S.W.3d 58 (Tex. App. 2007), the court
addressed a "Report for Contempt" that was signed by the parties, their
attorneys, and the associate judge, and was "'approved and so ordered' and
signed with the stamp of the district judge." The court noted that "Under the
law applicable at the time the report was signed, the findings and
recommendations of the associate judge became the order of the referring
court only on the referring court's signing an order conforming to the
report." This case reinforces the requirement that a district judge must
approve an associate judge's order for it to become enforceable.
Limited Circumstances for Final Orders by Associate Judges
In In re A.G.D.M., 533 S.W.3d 546 (Tex. App. 2017), the Texas Court of
Appeals provided a detailed analysis of the limited circumstances under
which an associate judge can render final orders. The court noted that "the
powers vested in an associate judge are prescribed by statute," specifically §
201.007 of the Texas Family Code. The court emphasized that "to the extent
said statute permits an associate judge to render 'a final' order or decree,
the instances in which it can are limited."

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
These limited circumstances include:
"a final order agreed to in writing as to both form and substance by all
parties,"
"a final default order,"
"a final order in a case in which a party files an unrevoked waiver made
in accordance with Rule 119, Texas Rules of Civil Procedure," or
"a final order if the parties waive the right to a de novo hearing before
the referring court under Section 201.015 in writing before the start of
a hearing conducted by the associate judge."
The court in A.G.D.M. determined that the "recommendation" before them
fell within none of those categories, highlighting the strict limitations on an
associate judge's authority to issue final orders.
Similarly, in Tidwell v. Tidwell, No. 08-17-00120-CV (Tex. App. Sep 30,
2019), the court reiterated that "The powers vested in an associate judge
are prescribed by Section 201.007 of the Texas Family Code." The court
noted that the statute "permitted an associate judge to 'render and sign: (A)
a final order agreed to in writing as to both form and substance by all
parties.'" Importantly, the court also stated that "An order that is rendered
and signed by an associate judge constitutes an order of the referring court"
under TEX.FAM.CODE ANN. § 201.007(c). This clarifies that while an
associate judge's order can constitute an order of the referring court, it
must still satisfy the statutory requirements, including having all required
signatures for agreed orders.
Signature Requirements as Conditions Precedent
Beyond the specific statutory framework governing associate judges, Texas
law also addresses the enforceability of documents that explicitly require
signatures as a condition of validity. In Firstlight Fed. Credit Union v. Loya,
478 S.W.3d 157 (Tex. App. 2015), the court addressed when signatures are
conditions precedent to enforcement, stating: "to make a signature a
condition precedent to enforcement of a contract—including an arbitration
agreement—the agreement must clearly and explicitly require a signature
before it becomes binding."
This principle is relevant to our analysis because the temporary order in
question "explicitly requires the signatures of all parties." Under the
Firstlight precedent, if a document clearly and explicitly requires signatures,
those signatures become conditions precedent to the document's
enforceability.

Analysis
Dual Requirements for Enforceability
Based on the provided legal authorities, a temporary order signed by an
associate judge faces two separate requirements to be enforceable by law
enforcement:
District Judge Approval Requirement: The order must be approved,
adopted, or otherwise endorsed by the referring district judge.
Signature Requirement: If the order explicitly requires signatures
from all parties, those signatures must be present for the order to be
valid and enforceable according to its own terms.
In the present scenario, both requirements are unfulfilled: the order has not
been adopted by the district judge, and it is missing signatures from the
respondent and their counsel despite explicitly requiring them.
Failure to Meet District Judge Approval Requirement
The requirement that a district judge must approve or adopt an associate
judge's order for it to become enforceable is well-established in Texas case
law. In K.E.B. v. Off. of Att'y Gen. of Tex., 698 S.W.3d 76 (Tex. App. 2024), the
court explicitly held that "the referring court was required to sign this order
or take some other action to adopt or modify the order proposed by the
associate judge before a final order could be rendered." Similarly, In re
M.K.R., 216 S.W.3d 58 (Tex. App. 2007) confirmed that an associate judge's
findings and recommendations become the order of the referring court only
upon "the referring court's signing an order conforming to the report."
In the present scenario, the temporary order is "not adopted by the district
judge." Without this adoption or approval, the order fails to meet the basic
requirement for enforceability established in K.E.B. and M.K.R. This alone
would render the order unenforceable by law enforcement, as it has not
been properly integrated into the authority of the referring court.
Failure to Meet Signature Requirements
The second critical issue is the absence of required signatures. The order
"explicitly requires the signatures of all parties" but is "missing the
respondent and their counsel's signatures." This creates two related
problems:
Failure to Meet Self-Imposed Conditions: When a document
explicitly states that signatures from all parties are required, those
signatures become conditions precedent to its validity. As established in 
Firstlight Fed. Credit Union v. Loya, 478 S.W.3d 157 (Tex. App. 2015),
when a document "clearly and explicitly require[s] a signature before it
becomes binding," that requirement must be satisfied for enforceability.
Since the temporary order explicitly requires signatures from all

parties but lacks the respondent's and their counsel's signatures, it fails
to meet its own stated conditions for validity.
Statutory Requirements for Agreed Orders: If the order is
characterized as an "agreed" temporary order, it falls under Tex. Fam.
Code § 201.007's requirement that such orders be "agreed to in writing
as to both form and substance by all parties." The absence of the
respondent's and counsel's signatures directly contradicts this
requirement, as their written agreement is not evidenced on the
document. This would render the order statutorily insufficient as an
"agreed" order under Section 201.007.
As explained in Tidwell v. Tidwell, No. 08-17-00120-CV (Tex. App. Sep 30,
2019), an associate judge may render and sign "a final order agreed to in
writing as to both form and substance by all parties." If the temporary order
is classified as an "agreed" order but lacks signatures from all parties, it
fails to meet this basic statutory requirement.
Combined Effect on Enforceability
The combined effect of these deficiencies is that the order is not enforceable
by law enforcement. Law enforcement agencies rely on the legal validity of
court orders to execute them. When an order fails to meet basic
requirements for validity—such as proper judicial approval and completion
of all explicitly required signatures—enforcement would be improper.
In re A.G.D.M., 533 S.W.3d 546 (Tex. App. 2017) emphasizes that an
associate judge's authority to issue orders is strictly limited by statute.
When an order falls outside these limitations—as one lacking required
signatures and district court approval would—it does not carry the force of
law necessary for enforcement.
Exceptions and Caveats
Temporary Orders vs. Final Orders
It's important to note that Tex. Fam. Code § 201.007 distinguishes between
temporary orders and final orders. The statute explicitly grants associate
judges authority to render and sign temporary orders without the specific
written agreement requirement that applies to final orders. This raises the
question of whether a temporary order might be enforceable without all
parties' signatures even when it explicitly requires them.
However, this distinction does not override the principle established in 
Firstlight Fed. Credit Union v. Loya, 478 S.W.3d 157 (Tex. App. 2015) that
when a document clearly makes signatures a condition precedent to
enforcement, those signatures must be present. When the temporary order
itself explicitly requires all parties' signatures, that requirement becomes a
self-imposed condition of validity regardless of the statutory distinction
between temporary and final orders.

Potential Argument for Enforceability
One might argue that since Tex. Fam. Code § 201.007 grants associate
judges the power to render and sign temporary orders without specifying a
signature requirement for such orders, the missing signatures should not
affect enforceability if the order is classified strictly as a temporary order
rather than an agreed order.
However, this argument fails to address two crucial issues:
The order's explicit requirement for all parties' signatures creates a
condition precedent to its own validity
The absence of district judge approval still renders the order
unenforceable based on K.E.B. v. Off. of Att'y Gen. of Tex., 698 S.W.3d
76 (Tex. App. 2024) and In re M.K.R., 216 S.W.3d 58 (Tex. App. 2007)
Difference Between "Agreed" Temporary Orders and Other
Temporary Orders
There may be a distinction between temporary orders that are characterized
as "agreed" and those that are not. If the temporary order in question is not
labeled as an "agreed" order but simply as a temporary order that happens
to require signatures, there might be an argument that the Tex. Fam. Code §
201.007 provision allowing associate judges to sign temporary orders
applies without the "agreed to in writing" requirement.
However, the fact that the order "explicitly requires the signatures of all
parties" strongly suggests it was intended as an agreed order. Furthermore,
courts would likely interpret such explicit signature requirements as
meaningful conditions rather than mere formalities, especially given the
principles established in Firstlight Fed. Credit Union v. Loya, 478 S.W.3d 157
(Tex. App. 2015).
Conclusion
Based on the provided legal authorities, a temporary order signed only by an
associate judge that explicitly requires the signatures of all parties but is
missing the respondent's and their counsel's signatures is not enforceable
by law enforcement for two independent reasons.
First, the order has not been adopted by the district judge. As established in 
K.E.B. v. Off. of Att'y Gen. of Tex., 698 S.W.3d 76 (Tex. App. 2024) and In re
M.K.R., 216 S.W.3d 58 (Tex. App. 2007), an associate judge's order requires
the referring court's signature or some action to adopt or modify it before it
becomes enforceable. Without this district court approval, the order lacks
the judicial authority necessary for enforcement.
Second, the order fails to meet its own explicitly stated requirements. When
a document "explicitly requires the signatures of all parties," those
signatures become conditions precedent to its validity under the principle
established in Firstlight Fed. Credit Union v. Loya, 478 S.W.3d 157 (Tex.

App. 2015). The absence of signatures from the respondent and their
counsel means the order fails to satisfy its own terms for validity.
Furthermore, if the order is characterized as an "agreed" temporary order, it
would need to comply with the requirement in Tex. Fam. Code § 201.007 and
Tidwell v. Tidwell, No. 08-17-00120-CV (Tex. App. Sep 30, 2019) that such
orders be "agreed to in writing as to both form and substance by all parties."
The missing signatures directly contradict this requirement.
The combined effect of these deficiencies is that the order lacks legal force
and cannot be properly enforced by law enforcement. For enforcement to be
appropriate, the order would need to be either: (1) properly adopted by the
district judge, or (2) signed by all parties as explicitly required by the order
itself, or preferably both. Without these elements, the order fails to meet the
basic requirements for enforceability established by Texas statutory and
case law.

Further, to make a signature a condition precedent to enforcement of a
contract—including an arbitration agreement—the agreement must clearly
and explicitly require a signature before it becomes binding.
Summary
For a contract or agreement to be enforceable, if a signature is a condition
precedent, the agreement must clearly and explicitly require a signature
before it becomes binding. This principle can be applied to the temporary
order in question. If the temporary order explicitly requires the signatures of
all parties to be binding, and it is missing the respondent and their counsel's
signatures, it suggests that the order may not be enforceable.

That the order is a 'recommendation' poses a further obstacle to our
jurisdiction. That is, the powers vested in an associate judge are prescribed
by statute. The statute prescribing them is § 201.007 of the Texas Family
Code. See TEX. FAM. CODE ANN. § 201.007 (West, Supp. 2017). And, to the
extent said statute permits an associate judge to render 'a final' order or

final order agreed to in writing as to both form and substance by all parties,'
id.§ 201.007(a)(14)(A) ; 2) 'a final default order,' id.§ 201.007(a)(14)(B) ; 3) 'a
final order in a case in which a party files an unrevoked waiver made in
accordance with Rule 119, Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, that waives notice
to the party of the final hearing or waives the party's appearance at the final
hearing,' id.§ 201.007(a)(14)(D) ; and 4) 'a final order if the parties waive the
right to a de novo hearing before the referring court under Section 201.015
in writing before the start of a hearing conducted by the associate judge.'
Id.§ 201.007(a)(16). The 'recommendation' before us falls within none of
those categories.
Summary
Limited circumstances under which an associate judge can render a final
order. Specifically, it mentions that a final order must be agreed to in writing
by all parties as to both form and substance. If the order in question lacks
the signatures of the respondent and their counsel, it does not meet the
criteria for a final order as described in § 201.007(a)(14)(A). Therefore, it
would not be enforceable as a final order.

Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The associate judge first issued a letter report with his intended findings and
then signed a proposed order. Although the order was not written as a
recommendation and did not contain any space for the district court to
approve the order, we hold that the referring court was required to sign this
order or take some other action to adopt or modify the order proposed by
the associate judge before a final order could be rendered.
Summary
An associate judge's order requires the referring court's (district court's)
signature or some action to adopt or modify the order before it can be
considered a final order. This suggests that without the district court's
adoption or modification, the order is not enforceable as a final order.
Therefore, if the order in question is missing the respondent and their
counsel's signatures and has not been adopted by the district judge, it is
likely not enforceable by law enforcement.

Extract
The powers vested in an associate judge are prescribed by Section 201.007
of the Texas Family Code. See TEX.FAM.CODE ANN. § 201.007; In re
A.G.D.M., 533 S.W.3d 546, 547 (Tex.App.—Amarillo 2017, no writ). The
statute in effect in 2013 permitted an associate judge to 'render and sign:
(A) a final order agreed to in writing as to both form and substance by all
parties.' Act of June 15, 2007, 80th Leg., R.S., Ch. 1406, § 5, 2008
TEX.GEN.LAW 4816 (codified at former TEX.FAM.CODE ANN. § 201.007(a)
(14)). An order that is rendered and signed by an associate judge constitutes
an order of the referring court. TEX.FAM.CODE ANN. § 201.007(c).
Summary
An associate judge in Texas has the authority to render and sign a final
order only if it is agreed to in writing by all parties as to both form and
substance. The passage also indicates that an order signed by an associate
judge constitutes an order of the referring court. However, if the order
explicitly requires the signatures of all parties and is missing the respondent
and their counsel's signatures, it does not meet the requirement of being
agreed to in writing by all parties. Therefore, it would not be enforceable.
In re M.K.R., 216 S.W.3d 58 (Tex. App. 2007)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The Report for Contempt grants an 'arrearage judgment,' was signed by the
parties, signed by their attorneys, 'so ordered' and signed by the associate
judge, and 'approved and so ordered' and signed with the stamp of the
district judge. Under the law applicable at the time the report was signed,
the findings and recommendations of the associate judge became the order
of the referring court only on the referring court's signing an order
conforming to the report. ... However, Sanderson refers us to nothing in the
family code or the government code that specifically requires a separate
document per se; instead, what is required is the separate approval of the
district court shown by the district court's signing an order conforming to
the report.
Summary
For an associate judge's findings and recommendations to become an
enforceable order of the court, the district judge must sign an order
conforming to the report. This suggests that without the district judge's
signature, the associate judge's order alone is not enforceable. Additionally,
the passage does not address the specific requirement of all parties'
signatures, but it emphasizes the necessity of the district judge's approval
for enforceability.

Summary
An associate judge in Texas has the authority to render and sign a temporary
order. However, for a final order to be agreed upon, it must be in writing and
agreed to in both form and substance by all parties. The passage does not
explicitly address the enforceability of a temporary order missing required
signatures, but it implies that agreement by all parties is necessary for
certain orders. This suggests that if a temporary order explicitly requires the
signatures of all parties and is missing some, it may not be enforceable.
