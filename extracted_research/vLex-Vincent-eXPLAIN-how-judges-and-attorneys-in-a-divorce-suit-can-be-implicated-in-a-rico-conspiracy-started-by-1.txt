Question
eXPLAIN how judges and attorneys in a divorce suit can be implicated in a
rico conspiracy started by others, and explain how they could meet the
enterprise and continuity and relatedness elements by inadvertently
assisting the petitioner in the divorce in a broader fraudulent scheme to
divest a father of his home and business. Assume judicial immunity is not at
issue. 
Answer (Fifth Circuit)
Short response
Judges and attorneys in a divorce suit can be implicated in a RICO
conspiracy if they knowingly agree to further the objectives of a broader
fraudulent scheme—such as divesting a father of his home and business—by
participating in or facilitating a pattern of racketeering activity connected to
an enterprise, even if their involvement is indirect or peripheral. The
enterprise, continuity, and relatedness elements can be met if their actions
are part of an ongoing organization or association-in-fact that functions as a
continuing unit and engages in related predicate acts over time.
Summary
Under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO),
individuals—including judges and attorneys—may be implicated in a
conspiracy if they knowingly agree to participate in or further the objectives
of an enterprise engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity. This can occur
even if their involvement is indirect or if they only provide support, as long
as there is an agreement to pursue the criminal objective and the requisite
elements of enterprise, continuity, and relatedness are satisfied.
In the context of a divorce suit, if judges and attorneys inadvertently assist a
petitioner in a broader fraudulent scheme to divest a father of his home and
business, they could be swept into a RICO conspiracy if their actions are
part of an ongoing association that functions as a continuing unit and
engages in related predicate acts (such as mail or wire fraud) over time. The
law does not require direct participation in every act, but rather knowledge
of and agreement to the overall criminal objective, with the enterprise and
continuity elements established by the ongoing nature and relatedness of
the fraudulent conduct.

Background and Relevant Law
Legislative Framework
The RICO statute, codified at 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961–1968, establishes both
criminal and civil liability for individuals who engage in a pattern of
racketeering activity connected to an enterprise. Section 1962 sets out four
distinct violations: (a) acquiring or operating an enterprise with
racketeering proceeds; (b) controlling an enterprise through racketeering;
(c) conducting the affairs of an enterprise through racketeering; and (d)
conspiring to commit any of the above offenses. Each requires proof of an
"enterprise" and a "pattern of racketeering activity" (RICO: A Primer
(2022-01-31)).
Section 1962(d) specifically addresses conspiracy, making it unlawful to
conspire to violate any of the substantive RICO provisions. Importantly, a
defendant need not personally commit the predicate acts; it is sufficient that
they knowingly agree to the overall criminal objective and that a conspirator
would commit a violation of § 1962(c) (RICO: A Primer (2022-01-31)).
Case Law
The Fifth Circuit and other federal courts have elaborated on the elements
required to establish RICO liability and conspiracy:
Enterprise: An enterprise can be a legal entity (such as a corporation
or court) or an "association-in-fact"—a group of individuals associated
for a common purpose, functioning as a continuing unit (U.S. v.
Stratton, 649 F.2d 1066 (5th Cir. 1981); Delta Truck & Tractor, Inc. v.
J.I. Case Co., 855 F.2d 241 (5th Cir. 1988); Terrell v. Hancock Bank, 7
F.Supp.2d 812 (S.D. Miss. 1998)).
Pattern of Racketeering Activity: Requires at least two predicate
acts (such as mail or wire fraud) within ten years, which are related
and demonstrate a threat of continued criminal activity (United States
v. Pratt, 728 F.3d 463 (5th Cir. 2013); Megatel Homes, LLC v. Moayedi,
Civil Action 3:20-CV-00688-L (N.D. Tex. Nov 16, 2021)).
Continuity and Relatedness: The acts must be connected in a way
that shows ongoing criminal conduct, either over a closed period
(repeated conduct) or with a threat of future repetition (Delta Truck &
Tractor, Inc. v. J.I. Case Co., 855 F.2d 241 (5th Cir. 1988); Burzynski, In
re, 989 F.2d 733 (5th Cir. 1993)).
Conspiracy: To establish a RICO conspiracy under § 1962(d), it is
sufficient to show that two or more people agreed to commit a
substantive RICO offense and that the defendant knew of and agreed to
the overall objective (United States v. Rosenthal, 805 F.3d 523 (5th Cir.
2015); U.S. v. Elliott, 571 F.2d 880 (5th Cir. 1978)). Direct evidence of
agreement is not required; circumstantial evidence and the conduct of
the alleged conspirators may suffice.

Application to Judicial Actors: Courts have recognized that judicial
circuits and their officials can constitute an enterprise under RICO, and
that judges and attorneys may be implicated if they participate in the
enterprise's affairs through predicate crimes (U.S. v. Stratton, 649 F.2d
1066 (5th Cir. 1981)).
It is important to note that United States v. Pratt, 728 F.3d 463 (5th Cir.
2013) was stated as abrogated by Widmer v. Smith, Civil Action 21-381 (E.D.
La. Sep 16, 2021), but the core principles regarding the elements of RICO
conspiracy remain consistent with other authorities.
Secondary Materials
Secondary sources reinforce that RICO claims require proof of an
enterprise, a pattern of racketeering activity, and continuity. They also
emphasize that the conduct must be organized and ongoing, and that mere
association with conspirators is insufficient without evidence of agreement
to commit predicate acts (Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy (2024-01-01); 
Defending Civil RICO Claims: A Defense Plan Should Be In Every Business's
Arsenal (2022-02-03)).
Analysis
1. How Judges and Attorneys Can Be Implicated in a RICO
Conspiracy
a. The Role of Agreement and Knowledge
Under RICO, conspiracy liability does not require that each conspirator
personally commit the predicate acts. Instead, it is enough that the
individual knowingly agrees to further the criminal objective of the
enterprise (United States v. Rosenthal, 805 F.3d 523 (5th Cir. 2015); RICO: A
Primer (2022-01-31)). This means that judges and attorneys could be
implicated if they are aware of and agree to the broader scheme, even if
their role is limited to providing support or facilitating certain actions.
The law is clear that direct evidence of an explicit agreement is not
necessary; circumstantial evidence—such as patterns of conduct,
communications, or coordinated actions—can suffice to establish the
requisite agreement (U.S. v. Elliott, 571 F.2d 880 (5th Cir. 1978)). Thus, if a
judge or attorney, through their actions in a divorce suit, knowingly furthers
the objectives of a fraudulent scheme (for example, by issuing or advocating
for orders that are part of a plan to divest a party of property through
fraudulent means), they may be found to have joined the conspiracy.
b. Inadvertent Assistance and Peripheral Involvement
RICO is designed to reach not only insiders but also outsiders who are
"associated with" an enterprise and participate, directly or indirectly, in its
affairs (U.S. v. Elliott, 571 F.2d 880 (5th Cir. 1978)). The statute's net is cast
• 

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
broadly, capturing even those whose involvement is peripheral, provided
there is evidence of agreement to the criminal objective.
However, mere inadvertence or negligence is not enough. There must be
some level of knowledge and agreement to further the criminal objective
(Snow Ingredients, Inc. v. SnoWizard, Inc., 833 F.3d 512 (5th Cir. 2016)). If a
judge or attorney is simply performing their professional duties without
knowledge of the broader scheme, RICO liability is unlikely. But if they
become aware of the fraudulent nature of the scheme and continue to assist,
or if their conduct is so intertwined with the scheme that agreement can be
inferred, they may be implicated.
2. Meeting the Enterprise, Continuity, and Relatedness
Elements
a. Enterprise
The "enterprise" element is satisfied if there is a structured group—either a
legal entity or an association-in-fact—associated for a common purpose
(Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy (2024-01-01); U.S. v. Stratton, 649 F.2d 1066
(5th Cir. 1981)). In the context of a divorce suit, the enterprise could be the
court itself, a law firm, or an informal association of individuals (including
the petitioner, attorneys, and possibly a judge) working together to achieve
the fraudulent objective.
Courts have recognized that judicial circuits can constitute an enterprise
under RICO, and that judges and attorneys may be part of such an
enterprise if they participate in its affairs through racketeering activity (U.S.
v. Stratton, 649 F.2d 1066 (5th Cir. 1981)). An association-in-fact enterprise
requires evidence of an ongoing organization and that the associates
function as a continuing unit (Terrell v. Hancock Bank, 7 F.Supp.2d 812 (S.D.
Miss. 1998); Manax v. McNamara, 842 F.2d 808 (5th Cir. 1988)).
b. Pattern of Racketeering Activity
A pattern of racketeering activity requires at least two predicate acts (such
as mail or wire fraud) within ten years, which are related and demonstrate a
threat of continued criminal activity (United States v. Pratt, 728 F.3d 463
(5th Cir. 2013); Delta Truck & Tractor, Inc. v. J.I. Case Co., 855 F.2d 241 (5th
Cir. 1988)). The acts must be connected to the enterprise's affairs (U.S. v.
Welch, 656 F.2d 1039 (5th Cir. 1981)).
In the divorce context, if the scheme involves repeated use of the courts,
legal filings, or judicial orders to further the fraudulent divestment of
property, and these acts constitute indictable offenses (such as mail or wire
fraud), the pattern element may be satisfied.
c. Continuity and Relatedness
Continuity refers to the ongoing nature of the criminal conduct. It can be
established by showing either a closed period of repeated conduct or a

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
threat of future repetition (Megatel Homes, LLC v. Moayedi, Civil Action
3:20-CV-00688-L (N.D. Tex. Nov 16, 2021); Delta Truck & Tractor, Inc. v. J.I.
Case Co., 855 F.2d 241 (5th Cir. 1988)). Relatedness requires that the
predicate acts are connected to each other and to the affairs of the
enterprise.
If the fraudulent scheme to divest the father of his home and business is
ongoing, involves multiple acts over time, and the acts are related in
furtherance of the same objective, the continuity and relatedness elements
are likely met. The enterprise must have an existence separate from the
pattern of racketeering activity, but the two are often closely linked in
practice (Burzynski, In re, 989 F.2d 733 (5th Cir. 1993); U.S. v. Cauble, 706
F.2d 1322 (5th Cir. 1983)).
d. Application to Judges and Attorneys
If judges and attorneys, through their actions in the divorce suit, knowingly
further the objectives of the fraudulent scheme—such as by issuing or
advocating for orders that are part of the plan to divest the father of
property—they may be found to have participated in the enterprise's affairs
through a pattern of racketeering activity. Their involvement need not be
direct; even peripheral or supportive actions can suffice if there is evidence
of agreement to the criminal objective (U.S. v. Elliott, 571 F.2d 880 (5th Cir.
1978)).
However, if their involvement is truly inadvertent and there is no evidence of
knowledge or agreement, RICO liability is unlikely. The law distinguishes
between knowing participation and mere association or negligence (Snow
Ingredients, Inc. v. SnoWizard, Inc., 833 F.3d 512 (5th Cir. 2016)).
3. Limitations and Negative Treatment
It is important to acknowledge that United States v. Pratt, 728 F.3d 463 (5th
Cir. 2013) was stated as abrogated by Widmer v. Smith, Civil Action 21-381
(E.D. La. Sep 16, 2021). While the abrogation may affect certain aspects of
the case, the fundamental principles regarding the elements of RICO
conspiracy—agreement, knowledge, and the pattern of racketeering activity
—remain consistent with other authorities and are supported by the broader
body of case law.
Similarly, U.S. v. Williams, 809 F.2d 1072 (5th Cir. 1987) was vacated by U.S.
v. Ascarrunz, 838 F.2d 759 (5th Cir. 1988), so reliance on its specific facts or
holdings should be limited. However, the general principles regarding the
need for an enterprise and a pattern of racketeering activity are echoed in
other, unaffected authorities.
Exceptions and Caveats
Mere Negligence or Bad Faith Litigation: Courts have held that
negligence or even bad faith litigation tactics, without corrupt activity
or agreement to the criminal objective, do not suffice for RICO liability
• 

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
(Snow Ingredients, Inc. v. SnoWizard, Inc., 833 F.3d 512 (5th Cir.
2016)).
Requirement of Agreement: A person cannot be held liable for a
RICO conspiracy merely by association with conspirators or by being
present in an environment where illegal activity occurs; there must be
evidence of agreement to commit predicate acts (Megatel Homes, LLC
v. Moayedi, Civil Action 3:20-CV-00688-L (N.D. Tex. Nov 16, 2021)).
Distinctness of Enterprise: The enterprise must have an existence
separate from the pattern of racketeering activity (Burzynski, In re, 989
F.2d 733 (5th Cir. 1993)).
Conclusion
Judges and attorneys in a divorce suit can be implicated in a RICO
conspiracy if they knowingly agree to further the objectives of a broader
fraudulent scheme—such as divesting a father of his home and business—by
participating in or facilitating a pattern of racketeering activity connected to
an enterprise. The enterprise, continuity, and relatedness elements are met
if their actions are part of an ongoing organization or association-in-fact that
functions as a continuing unit and engages in related predicate acts over
time. However, mere inadvertence or negligence is insufficient; there must
be evidence of knowledge and agreement to the criminal objective. The law
is designed to reach both insiders and outsiders who knowingly participate
in or support the enterprise's affairs through racketeering activity, and
courts have recognized that even peripheral involvement can result in
liability if the requisite elements are satisfied.

1986)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C.
Secs. 1961-1968, provides plaintiffs with a private civil action to recover
treble damages for injury 'by reason of a violation of [18 U.S.C.] section
1962.' 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1964(c). Among the activities that constitute violations
of Sec. 1962 is the conducting of an enterprise through a pattern of
racketeering activity. 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1962(c). RICO defines 'racketeering
activity' to include, among others, any act 'indictable' under numerous
federal criminal provisions, including mail and wire fraud (so-called
'predicate acts'). 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1961(1)(B).
Summary
To implicate judges and attorneys in a RICO conspiracy, it must be shown
that they conducted or participated in an enterprise through a pattern of
•

racketeering activity. This could include acts that are indictable under
federal criminal provisions, such as mail and wire fraud. The passage
highlights that RICO claims require a pattern of racketeering activity, which
involves multiple predicate acts that are related and continuous. In the
context of a divorce suit, if judges and attorneys inadvertently assist in a
scheme that involves such predicate acts, they could potentially meet the
enterprise and continuity and relatedness elements of a RICO claim.

U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act makes it illegal for
an individual to use the proceeds of racketeering activity in a business that
engages in interstate commerce. 18 U.S.C. § 1962. To establish a civil-RICO
claim, a plaintiff must establish three common elements: ... The RICO lists a
number of crimes that can constitute racketeering activity, including
obstruction of justice (as defined by 18 U.S.C. § 1503) and witness tampering
(as defined by 18 U.S.C. § 1512). 18 U.S.C. § 1961. Southern Snow has not
pleaded sufficient facts to establish either alleged criminal act. The criminal
statutes require not merely delay but corrupt activity by the bad actor.
Southern Snow points to no cases supporting its contention that bad faith
litigation tactics alone constitute witness tampering. By contrast, the
defendants point to several cases in other circuits holding that litigation
activity cannot be the predicate for a civil-RICO claim. ... Civil-RICO
conspiracy, however, cannot be premised on negligence. It requires an
actual agreement between conspirators—they must specifically intend the
illegal conduct.
Summary
Requirements for establishing a civil-RICO claim, emphasizing that mere
bad faith litigation tactics do not suffice. Instead, there must be corrupt
activity, and civil-RICO conspiracy requires an actual agreement with
specific intent to engage in illegal conduct. This suggests that judges and
attorneys in a divorce suit could only be implicated in a RICO conspiracy if
there is evidence of corrupt activity and an agreement to engage in illegal
conduct, rather than mere negligence or bad faith litigation.

Extract
The substantive proscriptions of the RICO statute apply to insiders and
outsiders those merely 'associated with' an enterprise who participate
directly and indirectly in the enterprise's affairs through a pattern of
racketeering activity. 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). ... Thus, the RICO net is woven
tightly to trap even the smallest fish, those peripherally involved with the
enterprise. This effect is enhanced by principles of conspiracy law also
developed to facilitate prosecution of conspirators at all levels. Direct
evidence of agreement is unnecessary: 'proof of such an agreement may rest
upon inferences drawn from relevant and competent circumstantial
evidence ordinarily the acts and conduct of the alleged conspirators
themselves'.
Summary
The RICO statute is designed to apply broadly to individuals who are
associated with an enterprise, whether they are insiders or outsiders. This
includes those who participate directly or indirectly in the enterprise's
affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity. The passage highlights
that even peripheral involvement can lead to implication under RICO, and
that direct evidence of an agreement is not necessary; circumstantial
evidence and the conduct of the alleged conspirators can suffice. This broad
application means that judges and attorneys, if they are found to be
associated with an enterprise and participate in its affairs through a pattern
of racketeering activity, could potentially be implicated in a RICO
conspiracy, even if their involvement is indirect or peripheral.

U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
Congress wrote RICO in broad, sweeping terms to combat the many, varied,
anfractuous ways in which racketeers operate. Reduced to its three
essentials, a civil RICO claim must involve: (1) a person who engages in (2) a
pattern of racketeering activity (3) connected to the acquisition,
establishment, conduct, or control of an enterprise. ... The concept of
continuity as a means of controlling the scope of RICO has also been
incorporated into the enterprise element of section 1962. An enterprise
'includes any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal
entity, and any union or group of individuals associated in fact although not
a legal entity.' 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1961(4). In United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S.
576, 583, 101 S.Ct. 2524, 2528-29, 69 L.Ed.2d 246 (1981), the Supreme
Court stressed that continuity is a necessary attribute of an association-in-
fact enterprise.

Summary
A civil RICO claim requires a person to engage in a pattern of racketeering
activity connected to an enterprise. The concept of continuity is crucial in
determining the scope of RICO, particularly in defining an enterprise. An
enterprise can include any group of individuals associated in fact, even if not
a legal entity. This broad definition could potentially encompass judges and
attorneys if they are found to be part of an association-in-fact enterprise,
even inadvertently, by assisting in a fraudulent scheme.

The existence of an enterprise is an essential element of a RICO claim. 18
U.S.C. § 1962(c); Sedima v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479, 496-98, 105 S.Ct. 3275,
3285, 87 L.Ed.2d 346 (1985). To establish an 'association in fact' enterprise
under 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4) plaintiffs must show 'evidence of an ongoing
organization, formal or informal, and ... evidence that the various associates
function as a continuing unit.' United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 583,
101 S.Ct. 2524, 2528, 69 L.Ed.2d 246 (1981); Shaffer v. Williams, 794 F.2d

Summary
To implicate judges and attorneys in a RICO conspiracy, there must be
evidence of an "enterprise" that is an ongoing organization where the
associates function as a continuing unit. This is essential to establish a RICO
claim. The passage provides insight into the requirement of demonstrating
an "association in fact" enterprise, which is crucial for understanding how
individuals, including judges and attorneys, could be implicated if they are
part of such an enterprise, even inadvertently.

invest that income in an enterprise; (b) a person cannot acquire or maintain
an interest in an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering; (c) a person
who is employed by or associated with an enterprise cannot conduct the
affairs of the enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity; and (d) a

United States v. Rosenthal, 805 F.3d 523 (5th Cir. 2015)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
Under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), it is a crime for 'any person employed by or
associated with any enterprise engaged in, [or affecting] interstate or
foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the
conduct of [the] enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering
activity or collection of unlawful debt'. 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). Section 1962(d),
at issue here, prohibits conspiracy to violate any part of § 1962. 'The
elements of a conspiracy under § 1962(d) are simply (1) that two or more
people agreed to commit a substantive RICO offense and (2) that the
defendant knew of and agreed to the overall objective of the RICO offense.'
United States v. Pratt, 728 F.3d 463, 477 (5th Cir.2013) (emphasis added)
(internal quotation marks omitted).
Summary
For a RICO conspiracy under § 1962(d), it is sufficient that two or more
people agree to commit a substantive RICO offense and that the defendant
knew of and agreed to the overall objective of the RICO offense. This means
that judges and attorneys could be implicated if they knowingly agree to
further the objectives of a RICO conspiracy, even if they do not directly
participate in the operation or management of the enterprise. The passage
also clarifies that the conspiracy itself is punishable, regardless of whether
the substantive crime is completed.

242. A RICO conspiracy claim based on § 1962(d) also requires the existence
of an enterprise. Manax v. McNamara, 842 F.2d 808, 812 (5th Cir.1988).
Since no 'enterprise' or 'pattern of racketeering' was established in either
case, the RICO claims should not have been submitted to the jury.
Summary
To implicate judges and attorneys in a RICO conspiracy, there must be a
demonstration of a "pattern of racketeering activity" connected to an
"enterprise." The passage emphasizes that a RICO claim requires more than
isolated acts; it requires a series of related acts that demonstrate continuity
and relatedness. The passage also highlights that an enterprise must have
an existence separate from the pattern of racketeering activity. This means
that for judges and attorneys to be implicated, there must be evidence that
their actions were part of a broader scheme that meets these criteria.

Summary
Requirements for establishing a RICO claim, which includes demonstrating
a pattern of racketeering activity connected to an enterprise. The enterprise
can be an association-in-fact, which requires evidence of an ongoing
organization with a common purpose. The Fifth Circuit requires that this
enterprise has an existence separate from the racketeering pattern, is
ongoing, and functions as a continuing unit. This information is relevant to
understanding how judges and attorneys could be implicated in a RICO
conspiracy if they inadvertently assist in a fraudulent scheme that meets
these criteria.

In 1970, Congress enacted RICO as Title IX of the Organized Crime Control
Act to combat organized crime through both criminal prosecutions and
private actions. See 18 U.S.C. § 1961 et seq. The 'legislative history
forcefully supports the view that the major purpose of Title IX is to address
the infiltration of legitimate business by organized crime.' United States v.
Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 591, 101 S.Ct. 2524, 2532, 69 L.Ed.2d 246 (1981). A
private right of action is provided under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c), which states in
pertinent part: Any person injured in his business or property by reason of a
violation of section 1962 of this chapter may sue therefor in any appropriate
United States district court and shall recover threefold the damages he
sustains and the cost of the suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee...
RICO defines 'enterprise' very broadly. The term 'enterprise' includes 'any
individual, partnership, corporation, association or other legal entity, any
union or group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.'
18 U.S.C. § 1961(4). There is no restriction upon the associations embraced
by the definition: a RICO 'enterprise' can be either a legal entity or an
'association in fact' enterprise. Burzynski, 989 F.2d at 743; see Turkette, 452
U.S. at 580, 101 S.Ct. at 2527. A legitimate business entity, such as a
corporation, may constitute an 'enterprise.'
Summary
RICO was enacted to combat organized crime, including the infiltration of
legitimate businesses. The definition of "enterprise" under RICO is broad
and includes any group of individuals associated in fact, even if not a legal
entity. This means that judges and attorneys could potentially be implicated
in a RICO conspiracy if they are part of an "association in fact" that engages
in racketeering activity, such as mail or wire fraud, even if they are not
aware of the broader fraudulent scheme. The passage also highlights that a
private right of action exists for individuals injured by a RICO violation,
allowing them to seek damages.

U.S. v. Bright, 630 F.2d 804 (5th Cir. 1980)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
Section 1962(c) of Title 18 provides: It shall be unlawful for any person
employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities
of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate,
directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a
pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt. Thus, to prove
a RICO violation, the government must prove (1) the existence of an
enterprise; (2) that the defendant is 'associated with' the enterprise; (3) that
the defendant participated in the conduct of the enterprise's affairs; and (4)
that the participation was through a pattern of racketeering activity.
Summary
Elements necessary to establish a RICO violation, which include the
existence of an enterprise, association with the enterprise, participation in
the enterprise's affairs, and participation through a pattern of racketeering
activity. This framework can be applied to understand how judges and
attorneys in a divorce suit could be implicated in a RICO conspiracy if they
are found to be associated with an enterprise engaged in racketeering
activities, even if their involvement was inadvertent. The key elements of
enterprise, continuity, and relatedness would need to be established to show
that their actions were part of a broader fraudulent scheme.
U.S. v. Smith, 574 F.2d 308 (5th Cir. 1978)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
The instant indictment charges appellant with violations of the Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C.A. §§ 1961 et
seq. Count Two charged appellant with violation of § 1962(c), which makes it
unlawful 'for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise
engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce,
to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such
enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of
unlawful debt.' Count One charged appellant and others with conspiring to
violate § 1962(c), a violation of § 1962(d). A 'pattern' of racketeering activity
is defined under the Act as 'at least two acts of racketeering activity. .. .' 18
U.S.C.A. § 1961(5).

Summary
General framework for understanding RICO violations, which can be applied
to various scenarios, including the involvement of judges and attorneys in a
divorce suit. The passage explains that for a RICO violation, there must be
an enterprise engaged in activities affecting interstate or foreign commerce,
and individuals must participate in the enterprise's affairs through a pattern
of racketeering activity. This framework can be used to analyze how judges
and attorneys might be implicated in a RICO conspiracy if they are found to
be participating in or facilitating a broader fraudulent scheme.
U.S. v. Manzella, 782 F.2d 533 (5th Cir. 1986)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
Several of appellants' arguments require us to expound the law of the RICO
enterprise... The criminal enterprise is a creature different from the
conventional conspiracy; its unique nature arises from specific federal
legislation independent of the common law of conspiracy... Elliott does
indeed hold that on the facts of that case a series of agreements that under
pre-RICO law would constitute multiple conspiracies could under RICO be
tried as a single 'enterprise' conspiracy. But the language of Elliott explains
that what ties these conspiracies together is not the mere fact that they
involve the same enterprise but is instead--as in any other conspiracy--an
'agreement' on an overall objective. 'Agreement on an overall objective' can
be proved by either an explicit agreement to participate in the enterprise or
circumstantial evidence showing 'that each defendant must necessarily have
known that others were also conspiring to participate in the same enterprise
through a pattern of racketeering activity.'
Summary
The passage explains the nature of a RICO enterprise and how it differs from
a conventional conspiracy. It highlights that a RICO enterprise involves an
"agreement on an overall objective," which can be established through
explicit agreement or circumstantial evidence. This understanding is crucial
in determining how individuals, such as judges and attorneys, could be
implicated in a RICO conspiracy. If they inadvertently assist in a broader
fraudulent scheme, they could be seen as participating in the enterprise if
there is evidence of an agreement on the overall objective or if they should
have known about the broader conspiracy.

"RICO “makes a private right of action available to ‘[a]ny person injured in
his business or property by reason of a violation' of RICO's substantive
restrictions, § 1964(c), provided that the alleged violation was the proximate
cause of the injury.” Anza v. Ideal Steel Supply Corp., 547 U.S. 451 (2006)
(citing Holmes v. Sec. Inv. Prot. Crop., 503 U.S. 258, 268 (1992)). ... To
survive Defendants' Motion to Dismiss, Plaintiffs must adequately plead a
“pattern of racketeering activity.” ... To adequately plead a RICO pattern,
Plaintiffs must also show “that the predicate[] [acts] themselves amount to,
or [] otherwise constitute a threat of, continuing racketeering activity.” H.J.
Inc. v. Northwest Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 240 (1989) (emphasis in
original). “‘Continuity’ is both a closed and open-ended concept, referring
either to a closed period of repeated conduct, or to past conduct that by its
nature projects into the future with a threat of repetition.” ... A RICO
enterprise is “any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or other
legal entity, and any union or group of individuals associated in fact although
not a legal entity.” 18 U.S.C. § 1961. Generally, “[a] RICO enterprise can be
either a legal entity or an association-in-fact.” ... “[T]he core of a RICO civil
conspiracy is an agreement to commit predicate acts,” thus, the complaint
must “allege specifically such an agreement.” ... Furthermore, “a person
cannot be held liable for a RICO conspiracy ‘merely by evidence that he
associated with other... conspirators or by evidence that places the
defendant in a climate of activity that reeks of something foul.’”
Summary
Elements necessary to establish a RICO claim, including the need for a
pattern of racketeering activity, continuity, and the existence of a RICO
enterprise. It emphasizes that a RICO enterprise can be a legal entity or an
association-in-fact and that continuity can be either closed or open-ended.
The passage also highlights that a RICO conspiracy requires an agreement
to commit predicate acts and cannot be established merely by association
with conspirators.
U.S. v. Stratton, 649 F.2d 1066 (5th Cir. 1981)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
Judge Smith was convicted under Count Two of violating RICO by
participating in and conducting the affairs of an 'enterprise engaged in, or
the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce,' through a
pattern of racketeering activity. 18 U.S.C. § 1962; see pages 1070-1071 &
note 2, supra. In addition, all four appellants were convicted under Count
One of conspiring to violate RICO. 18 U.S.C. § 1962; see pages 1070-1071 &
note 2, supra. In both counts, the 'enterprise' was defined as the Third
Judicial Circuit of the State of Florida. All four appellants argue that for a
number of reasons the Third Judicial Circuit cannot constitute an enterprise

as defined under RICO, and that the indictment is therefore insufficient as a
matter of law.
Summary
A judicial circuit can be considered an "enterprise" under RICO if it is
engaged in or affects interstate or foreign commerce through a pattern of
racketeering activity. The passage illustrates that judges and other officials
can be implicated in a RICO conspiracy if they participate in the affairs of
such an enterprise through predicate crimes. The case demonstrates that a
single conspiracy can be charged under RICO if the enterprise's affairs are
furthered by the crimes, even if the participants are involved in different or
unrelated crimes. This is relevant to the question as it shows how judges and
attorneys in a divorce suit could be implicated in a RICO conspiracy if their
actions, even if inadvertent, further the enterprise's affairs in a broader
fraudulent scheme.
U.S. v. Welch, 656 F.2d 1039 (5th Cir. 1981)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
Thus, what is required to satisfy the last element of a RICO substantive
offense that the defendant participated in the conduct of the affairs of the
enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity is a relation between
the predicate offenses and the affairs of the enterprise. ... The final element
of a RICO violation is proof that the defendant participated in the affairs of
the enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity.... (T)his case is
distinguishable from those where the pattern of racketeering activity was
not linked to the alleged enterprise's affairs.
Summary
For a RICO violation, there must be a connection between the predicate
offenses and the affairs of the enterprise. This means that the racketeering
activities must be related to the enterprise's operations. The passage
emphasizes that the defendant must participate in the enterprise's affairs
through a pattern of racketeering activity, which is crucial in establishing a
RICO violation.
U.S. v. Williams, 809 F.2d 1072 (5th Cir. 1987)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit

=== PAGE 17 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
In order to secure a conviction under RICO, the Government must prove
both the existence of an 'enterprise' and the connected 'pattern of
racketeering activity.' The enterprise is an entity, for present purposes a
group of persons associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a
course of conduct. The pattern of racketeering activity is, on the other hand,
a series of criminal acts as defined by the statute. 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1961(1)
(1976 ed., Supp. III). The former is proved by evidence of an ongoing
organization, formal or informal, and by evidence that the various associates
function as a continuing unit. The latter is proved by evidence of the
requisite number of acts of racketeering committed by the participants in
the enterprise.
Summary
To implicate judges and attorneys in a RICO conspiracy, it must be shown
that they were part of an "enterprise" and engaged in a "pattern of
racketeering activity." The enterprise can be any group of individuals
associated for a common purpose, and it must function as a continuing unit.
The pattern of racketeering activity involves a series of criminal acts. In the
context of a divorce suit, if judges and attorneys, even inadvertently, assist
in a scheme that involves multiple acts of fraud or other criminal activities,
they could potentially meet the criteria for a RICO violation if it can be
shown that they were part of an ongoing organization with a common
purpose.
U.S. v. Cauble, 706 F.2d 1322 (5th Cir. 1983)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
RICO's purpose is 'the imposition of enhanced criminal penalties and new
civil sanctions to provide new legal remedies for all types of organized
criminal behavior, that is, enterprise criminality--from simple political
corruption to sophisticated white-collar crime schemes to traditional Mafia-
type endeavors.' RICO does not, however, criminalize conduct that was legal
before its enactment. Its application depends on the existence of
racketeering activity violating some other criminal statute, state or
federal. ... The statute states: ' 'enterprise' includes any individual,
partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or
group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.' The
Supreme Court has held that this language encompasses both wholly legal
entities and completely illegal associations-in-fact. But '[t]he 'enterprise' is
not the 'pattern of racketeering activity'; it is an entity separate and apart
from the pattern of activity in which it engages.' Therefore, in every case the
government must prove not only that there was a pattern of racketeering
activity but that it was conducted through an enterprise as thus defined.

=== PAGE 18 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
RICO does not criminalize legal conduct unless it involves racketeering
activity that violates another criminal statute. Therefore, if judges and
attorneys inadvertently assist in a fraudulent scheme, they could be
implicated if their actions contribute to the enterprise's racketeering
activities, meeting the continuity and relatedness elements.
Manax v. McNamara, 842 F.2d 808 (5th Cir. 1988)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
A RICO claim, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1962(c), 'requires (1) conduct (2) of an
enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity.' ... An enterprise
under RICO can include the usual legal entities such as partnerships and
corporations, but it also can include 'any union or group of individuals
associated in fact although not a legal entity....' 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1961(4)
(emphasis added). To establish an association-in-fact enterprise, a plaintiff
must 'show 'evidence of an ongoing organization, formal or informal, and ...
evidence that the various associates function as a continuing unit.' ' ... An
enterprise must be 'an entity separate and apart from the pattern of activity
in which it engages.' ... The association as alleged has one short-term goal--
the destruction of Manax's medical practice--and presumably will disband
upon the attainment of that goal. There is, as a result, nothing linking the
members of the association to one another except the commission of the
predicate criminal acts.
Summary
To implicate judges and attorneys in a RICO conspiracy, it must be shown
that they were part of an enterprise that engaged in a pattern of
racketeering activity. The enterprise can be an association-in-fact, which
requires evidence of an ongoing organization and that the associates
function as a continuing unit. The enterprise must be distinct from the
pattern of activity. The passage highlights that a short-term goal, such as the
destruction of a business, without continuity or a separate entity, does not
meet the RICO enterprise requirement. Therefore, for judges and attorneys
to be implicated, there must be evidence of their ongoing association and
participation in a broader scheme beyond the immediate divorce case.

U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit

Extract
Burzynski has also failed to plead a RICO violation, his last cause of action.
The plaintiff alleges RICO violations under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(a), (b), (c), and
(d). Boiled down to their essence in plain English, the subsections state: (a)
a person who has received income from a pattern of racketeering cannot
invest that income in an enterprise. (b) a person cannot acquire or maintain
an interest in an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering. (c) a person
who is employed by or associated with an enterprise cannot conduct the
enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering. (d) a person cannot
conspire to violate subsections (a), (b), or (c). Thus, RICO claims under all
four subsections necessitate: '1) a person who engages in 2) a pattern of
racketeering activity, 3) connected to the acquisition, establishment,
conduct, or control of an enterprise.' Delta Truck & Tractor, Inc. v. J.I. Case
Co., 855 F.2d 241, 242 (5th Cir.1988), cert. denied, 489 U.S. 1079, 109 S.Ct.
1531, 103 L.Ed.2d 836 (1989) (emphasis in original). We conclude that the
plaintiff failed to properly plead both a 'pattern of racketeering activity' and
a RICO 'enterprise.' ... A RICO 'enterprise' can be either a legal entity or an
'association in fact' enterprise. 18 U.S.C. 1961(4). The plaintiff argues that
the defendants together constitute an 'association in fact' enterprise. ... The
'enterprise' as pleaded fails for lack of 'continuity.' An 'association-in-fact'
enterprise perhaps could have been interpreted broadly to embrace any
cooperative endeavor by two or more persons, without regard to its
duration--thus embracing even a single transaction.
Summary
Necessary elements to establish a RICO violation under 18 U.S.C. § 1962,
which include a person engaging in a pattern of racketeering activity
connected to an enterprise. It also clarifies that a RICO "enterprise" can be a
legal entity or an "association in fact," but it must demonstrate continuity.
The passage highlights the importance of continuity and relatedness in
establishing a RICO enterprise, which is crucial for implicating judges and
attorneys in a RICO conspiracy. If judges and attorneys inadvertently assist
in a fraudulent scheme, they could potentially be seen as part of an
"association in fact" enterprise if their actions demonstrate continuity and
relatedness to the broader scheme.
United States v. Pratt, 728 F.3d 463 (5th Cir. 2013)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
Pratt was charged under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d) with conspiring to violate a
substantive RICO provision, § 1962(c). The elements of a conspiracy under §
1962(d) are simply “(1) that two or more people agreed to commit a
substantive RICO offense and (2) that the defendant knew of and agreed to
the overall objective of the RICO offense.” The defendant need not be one of
the people who agreed to commit the substantive offense. Section 1962(c)

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
makes it “unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any
enterprise ... to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct
of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.” ... A “
‘pattern of racketeering activity’ requires at least two acts of racketeering
activity” that occur within ten years of each other. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5). An
act of racketeering activity is defined in part as any act that is indictable
under enumerated provisions of the criminal code. Id. § 1961(1)(B). In this
case, the indictment alleges that the “pattern of racketeering activity”
consisted of multiple, specific acts of mail fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §
1341, and of money laundering, in violation of § 1956. In order to constitute
a pattern, the predicating acts must also be connected in a way that shows a
“threat of continuing activity.”
Summary
Elements required to establish a RICO conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d),
which includes an agreement between two or more people to commit a
substantive RICO offense and the defendant's knowledge and agreement to
the overall objective of the RICO offense. It also explains that a pattern of
racketeering activity requires at least two acts of racketeering within ten
years, which must be connected to show a threat of continuing activity. This
information is relevant to understanding how judges and attorneys could be
implicated in a RICO conspiracy if they knowingly agree to the objectives of
the conspiracy and participate in a pattern of racketeering activity, even if
indirectly.
Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy
The Brief - American Bar Association - 2024-01-01
Extract
A violation of § 1962(c), the section on which Sedima relies, requires (1)
conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity. The plaintiff must allege each of the elements to state a claim. They
are all equally essential components, and the complaint will fail if any one of
them is not adequately pleaded. In particular, RICO claims based on mail or
wire fraud must comport with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b)’s
requirement that allegations involving fraud be pleaded with particularity. ...
To establish a § 1962(c) RICO claim, the following elements must be proven:
• Enterprise: A structured group of individuals associated for a common
purpose. • Pattern of racketeering activity: At least two acts of racketeering,
as specified within the statute, within 10 years. • Conduct: Directly or
indirectly conducting the enterprise’s affairs through racketeering. • Injury:
An injury to business or property due to the racketeering activity.
Summary
Essential elements required to establish a RICO claim under § 1962(c),
which includes conduct, enterprise, pattern of racketeering activity, and

=== PAGE 21 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
injury. These elements are crucial for implicating individuals, such as judges
and attorneys, in a RICO conspiracy. The passage also emphasizes the need
for particularity in pleading fraud-related RICO claims, which is relevant
when considering how judges and attorneys might inadvertently assist in a
fraudulent scheme. The structured group (enterprise) and the pattern of
racketeering activity are particularly relevant to the question, as they relate
to the continuity and relatedness elements of a RICO claim.
RICO: A Primer
Extract
There are four separate and distinct RICO violations set out in section 1962:
(a) acquiring or operating an enterprise using racketeering proceeds; (b)
controlling an enterprise using racketeering activities; (c) conducting the
affairs of an enterprise using racketeering activities; and (d) conspiring to so
acquire, control, or conduct. Each of the subsections incorporates the basic
elements of 'enterprise' and a 'pattern of racketeering activity.' ... Under
Section 1962(d), it is a violation to conspire to commit any of the three
substantive RICO offenses. To prove a violation of Section 1962(d), a plaintiff
must prove the following elements: * The existence of an enterprise (or that
an enterprise would exist); * That the enterprise was (or would be) engaged
in, or its activities affected (or would affect), interstate or foreign commerce;
and * That each defendant knowingly agreed that a conspirator would
commit a violation of 18 U.S.C. ' 1962(c). The Supreme Court held that to
establish a RICO conspiracy offense under Section 1962(d), there is no
requirement that the defendant 'himself committed or agreed to commit the
two predicate acts requisite for a substantive RICO offense under ' 1962(c).'
The Supreme Court explained: A conspiracy may exist even if a conspirator
does not agree to commit or facilitate each and every part of the substantive
offense. The partners in the criminal plan must agree to pursue the same
criminal objective and may divide up the work, yet each is responsible for
the acts of each other. If conspirators have a plan which calls for some
conspirators to perpetrate the crime and others to provide support, the
supporters are as guilty as the perpetrators.
Summary
RICO violations can include conspiring to commit offenses even if the
conspirators do not directly commit the acts themselves. The passage
explains that under Section 1962(d), a conspiracy can exist if there is an
agreement to pursue a criminal objective, and all conspirators are
responsible for each other's acts. This means that judges and attorneys
could be implicated in a RICO conspiracy if they knowingly agree to assist in
a scheme that involves racketeering activities, even if they do not directly
commit the acts themselves. The passage also highlights the importance of
the enterprise and pattern of racketeering activity elements, which are
essential to establishing a RICO violation.

RICO is not a simple statute. It pertains to conduct associated with an
'enterprise' and 'a pattern racketeering activity.' An enterprise is an
individual or legal entity, or a union or group of individuals associated in fact
although not a legal entity, while a pattern of racketeering activity requires
long-term, organized conduct to violate state and federal laws. ... Second, to
prove most types of RICO claims, the plaintiff must plead that the defendant
committed some qualifying criminal action, the most common of which is
mail, wire or securities fraud. ... Third, the plaintiff must plead a pattern of
racketeering activity for most RICO claims. If the alleged conduct occurred
once or twice, or was not continuous, it cannot form a pattern of conduct
sufficient to support a RICO claim.

affairs of an enterprise using racketeering activities; and (d) conspiring to so
acquire, control, or conduct. Each of the subsections incorporates the basic
elements of 'enterprise' and a 'pattern of racketeering activity.' ... Under
Section 1962(d), it is a violation to conspire to commit any of the three
substantive RICO offenses. To prove a violation of Section 1962(d), a plaintiff
must prove the following elements: * The existence of an enterprise (or that
an enterprise would exist); * That the enterprise was (or would be) engaged
in, or its activities affected (or would affect), interstate or foreign commerce;
and * That each defendant knowingly agreed that a conspirator would
commit a violation of 18 U.S.C. ' 1962(c). The Supreme Court held that to
establish a RICO conspiracy offense under Section 1962(d), there is no
requirement that the defendant 'himself committed or agreed to commit the
two predicate acts requisite for a substantive RICO offense under ' 1962(c).'
The Supreme Court explained: A conspiracy may exist even if a conspirator
does not agree to commit or facilitate each and every part of the substantive

criminal objective and may divide up the work, yet each is responsible for
the acts of each other. If conspirators have a plan which calls for some

supporters are as guilty as the perpetrators.
Summary
Under Section 1962(d) of RICO, a conspiracy can be established even if a
defendant did not commit or agree to commit the predicate acts themselves.
The key is that the defendant knowingly agreed that a conspirator would
commit a violation. This means that judges and attorneys could be
implicated if they knowingly agreed to assist in a scheme that involved a
RICO violation, even if they did not directly commit the acts themselves. The
passage also explains that a conspiracy can exist if conspirators agree to
pursue the same criminal objective, and each is responsible for the acts of
the others. This could apply to judges and attorneys if they were part of a
plan to divest a father of his home and business through fraudulent means,
even if their role was limited to providing support.
