Question
II. TIMELINE OF EVENTS BACKGROUND Morgan Michelle Myers,
(“Myers”) and Charles Dustin Myers, (“Plaintiff”) were married on June 20,
2015, and have two daughters, C.R.M. and M.E.M, aged seven and nine. The
evidence in this case will show that in early December of 2023, the entire
family was blindsided by Myers’ sudden announcement that she wanted a
divorce from Plaintiff. REC. 717 The evidence will further show that Myers’
reasoning for this divorce changes over time – beginning with how Plaintiff
spoke to her, and then switches to abuse and sexual harassment, and
allegations of drug abuse, claims that were only brought up in her initial
pleadings. On December 12, 2023, Plaintiff discovered a large volume of text
messages between Myers and two individuals identified as Debbie Price and
Damen Kazlauskas of Fort Worth, Texas spanning between October 2022
and December 2023. REC. 254-714 In response to this discovery, Myers
began to communicate with Defendant Daniel Kenneth Branthoover, a
resident of Yukon, Oklahoma, who assisted her in the planning, drafting,
traveling, and submitting of fraudulent documents to the 322nd District
Court of Tarrant County designed to divest Plaintiff of his home and business
operations. When these allegations were raised to the State, they failed to
adjudicate them and violated the Plaintiff’s constitutional rights when he
was deprived of the guarantees of equal protection under the law and when
he was not afforded due process before being deprived of his property. REC.
183. The central question is whether Defendants Munford, Kaitcer, Carter,
and Baker are victims of the initial scheme – or willing participants in an
expanded associate-in-fact enterprise that began in December of 2023 as the
Myers-Branthoover enterprise. A. The Myers-Branthoover Enterprise 1. On
December 14, 2023, Defendants Morgan Michelle Myers (“Myers)” and
Daniel Kenneth Branthoover (“Branthoover”), acting in concert and under
deceptive pretenses, (REC. 1704), initiated text-message communications
through which they formed and advanced a common plan and agreement.
Over the weekend of December 15, 2023, they met in Yukon, Oklahoma, to
further that plan ( REC. 274-278). The deceptive text message from
Defendant Branthoover claiming that he wanted to assist Plaintiff was
following an attempt by Myers to receive an ex-parte order of protection
from the 322nd District Court of Tarrant county, attempted on December 14,
2023 (REC. 78). B. Interstate Travel and Transfer 2. As part of their
agreement, both Defendants planned to draft and submit an original petition
for divorce and an affidavit of indigency to the 322nd District Court of
Tarrant County, with the intended and foreseeable result of removing
Plaintiff from his matrimonial residence at 6641 Anne Court, Watauga, Texas
76148—which also serves as his place of business for clients in the United
States, Canada, and the United Kingdom that rely on his market data
services (REC. 812 ¶ 16). 3. During Defendant Myers’s interstate travel, she
transferred the parties’ marital funds into Defendant Branthoover’s PayPal
account in the amount of $1,576 (REC. 723). Those proceeds funded a
second mobile phone (817-940-0852), listed on the fraudulent pleadings that
Myers and Branthoover jointly prepared in Oklahoma, which Myers then
carried from Yukon to Texas on December 17, 2023 (REC. 86; 99; 102; 107).
C. Admissions 4. On December 16, 2023, Plaintiff reached out to

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Branthoover and requested that the $1,576 be returned as they were needed
for Christmas gifts for the children, and for business advertising expenses
for his business. REC. 728-729. In response, defendant Branthoover
admitted that the purpose of defendant Myers’ visit was to help her prepare
paperwork for divorce litigation and confirmed that the transfer of $1,576
did in fact occur. REC. 730. Plaintiff’s bank statement from December 2023
further confirms this transaction. REC. 723. D. Post-submission
Collaboration 5. On December 18, 2023, defendant Myers submitted the
fraudulently prepared original petition for divorce, and an affidavit of
indigency to the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County. After these
documents were submitted, defendant Branthoover sent a text message to
Plaintiff on December 19, 2023, at 5:50 P.M. CST, holding himself out to be
defendant Myers’ attorney, showing his involvement extends past the initial
help in preparing the fraudulent documents. REC. 1712-1713 6. Four days
later, on December 22, 2023, defendant Myers submitted another knowingly
fraudulent application for protective to the 322nd District Court of Tarrant
County claiming that family violence had occurred on December 18, 2023,
supported by both an affidavit and unsworn declaration. REC. 108-109. E.
Significant and Intentional Misrepresentations 7. On December 27 and
December 28, 2023, respectively, the documents prepared by Myers with
the assistance of Branthoover were served on Plaintiff via the U.S.
Constable, and contained the following misrepresentations: i. That
defendant Myers could not afford court costs; REC. 72, REC. 85-96 ii. That
defendant Myers had an active order of protection against the Plaintiff with
a finding of family violence that had occurred during the marriage; REC. 78
at 10 iii. That defendant Myers was financially responsible for the family
vehicles, rent payments, utilities, and other household expenses, making
herself appear as the primary breadwinner; REC. 92 iv. That defendant
Myers would be harassed or abused if Plaintiff were given her newly
acquired phone number that was obtained while in Oklahoma; REC. 81 at
15. v. That defendant Myers and Plaintiff ceased living together on
December 1, 2023; REC. 74 at 4 vi. That family violence occurred on
December 18, 2023, in the presence of the two Children. REC. 108-109. vii.
That both family vehicles were defendant Myers’ separate property acquired
before marriage. REC. 79 at 11B F. Evidence to the Contrary 8. On the same
day Defendant Myers claimed to be in an emergency requiring the Plaintiff’s
prompt removal from the home, she can be seen at the home with Plaintiff
and the children in no state of emergency and also still cohabitating in the
marital home. REC 1715. 9. Again, on December 29, 2023, Defendant Myers
can be seen with Plaintiff at the family home, smiling and laughing with the
children in no state of emergency and still collaborating with Plaintiff in the
marital home. REC. 1735. 10. The citation for the application for protective
order ordered Respondent to show cause as to why it should not issue with a
hearing scheduled for January 16, 2024. REC. 118. 11. In response to
extensive misrepresentation above, Plaintiff prepared an original answer,
filed a motion to consolidate, and provided background information which
alleged that defendant Myers was intentionally abusing the legal process.
REC. 130-132. Plaintiff was ordered to show cause on January 16, 2024,
regarding the protective order application. REC. 118 G. Inclement Weather
and First Appearance 12. On January 15, 2024, the Tarrant County District
Courts Facebook page sent out a notice informing the members of the public
that the court would be closed on January 16, 2024, due to inclement

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
weather. REC. 1202. 13. Unaware of the closure at the time, the parties
appeared at the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County on January 16, 2024,
and were met with a dark courtroom, with only one judge in the building at
the time of their arrival – Defendant James Munford (“Munford”). 14.
Defendant Munford summarily ordered the Plaintiff out of his home,
inadvertently assisting the Myers-Branthoover associate-in-fact enterprise of
achieving their primary goal in having the Plaintiff removed from his
residence, despite the broader goal being to obtain a decree of divorce to
permanently divest Plaintiff of his interests. REC. 183. 15. Defendant
Munford’s initial order was baseless, made in the absence of any emergency,
without a hearing, and disregarded the Plaintiff’s pleadings, telling Myers
“you’re going to have to find evidence of family violence!” clearly aware that
this order was made without any regard to the Plaintiff’s constitutional
rights. 16. Defendant Jeffrey Kaitcer, (“Kaitcer”) walked into the courtroom
late due to the inclement weather and turned the courtroom into a laughing
matter as he began to joke with Defendant Munford, and instructed the
parties to download the AppClose app for communication, and the matter
was reset for January 22, 2024. There exists no record of this proceeding,
only marked appearances on the docket. H. Reset #1 – January 22, 2024,
Setting 17. At the January 22 reset hearing, the parties appeared only to
have the case reset once more because defendant Myers allegedly retained
the services of Defendant Cooper Carter, (“Carter”) in the lobby of the
courthouse just moments before the hearing was scheduled to begin. No
appearance can be traced to this setting by either party on the docket (REC.
1551), and once again, no hearing was held, and the case reset for a second
time to February 1, 2024. REC. 186. 18. Kaitcer permitted attorney Dan
Bacalis, Plaintiff’s prior attorney, to fill out the Associate Judge’s Report, and
the parties never went before him as indicated by the case docket’s lack of
appearance on this date by either party. I. Reset #2 – February 1, 2024,
Setting 19. One day prior to the February 1 setting, both attorneys,
Defendant Carter and Dan Bacalis, both amended the petition for divorce
and counterpetition for divorce without the parties’ knowledge. (REC. 189,
REC. 209) These amended documents were similar, submitted on the same
day, and raised concerns for Plaintiff regarding his quality of representation.
20. At the February 1 setting, both parties were in the conference rooms
outside of Defendant Kaitcer’s courtroom, when attorney Bacalis walks in
holding a settlement agreement. When Plaintiff refused this option and
requested that they go have a hearing before the judge. 21. This is when
Bacalis stated, as witness affidavits corroborate, that he “knows this Judge
and this is the best we can get.” and further stated “[w]e’ll be here all day.
We can come back and change it later.” 22. Outraged by this response,
Plaintiff paid very close attention to the settlement offer Bacalis was
pressuring him to sign, and noticed the following provisions: A typed written
Order conforming to this Report will follow within 20 days from the date this
Report is signed. The Temporary Order shall be prepared by DAN BACALIS.
Each attorney should approve the Order. The parties do not need to approve
the Order. The attorney reviewing the proposed Order shall have five (5)
days to do so. There arc no ten (JO) day letters. If an agreement is not
reached, a Motion to Sign shall be filed and set within thirty (30) days from
the signing of this Report. IT IS SO ORDERED (REC. 233) J. Termination of
Counsel and the Emergency Motion 23. With the above provisions in mind,
Plaintiff signed the document and immediately fired his attorney and

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
provided notice to the court. REC. 221. By doing so, Plaintiff gained access
back to the residency, invalidated the agreement, and was able to use the
time back in the house to run damage control on his business operations
while preparing to expose the Myers-Branthoover enterprise to the court via
a MOTION TO RECONSIDER EVIDENCE AND VACATE TEMPORARY
ORDERS, which was filed on February 9, 2024, within three business days of
the February 1 agreed associate judge’s report being served by the clerk.
REC. 240 24. In this motion, it was specifically stated that: i. “I am seeking
immediate court intervention to correct procedural e rrors and address the
misuse of the legal system by the Petitioner.” REC. 244 ii. “Particularly, Dan
Branthoover became involved. He is the boyfriend of the Petitioner’s Mother.
Shortly thereafter, I received a notice from our joint bank account stating
that $1,576 had just been withdrawn. As our bank statement for December
2023 will demonstrate – the transaction record shows the funds being
transferred directly to Mr. Branthoover’s PayPal account” REC. 245 iii. “The
Petitioner's action of filing for divorce under an Affidavit of Inability to pay
three days after transferring $1,576 to herself starkly contravenes the
mandates set forth in Chapter 10, Section 10.001 of the Civil Practice and
Remedies Code”. REC 247 at B2 iv. “The Petitioner violated Chapter 10,
Section 10.001 a second time within the same document when she
intentionally elected to waive the 60-day waiting period claiming to have an
active protective order against me that found family violence had occurred
during our marriage.” REC 247 at B3. v. “This suit was the second attempt
by the Petitioner to have me removed from the home, which ultimately
succeeded.” REC 248 at D1 25. The motion went on to explain the factual
pattern described up to this point, putting the court on notice of the key
issues with provided exhibits which were duly served on Carter. In response
to Plaintiff’s motion, he received the first of just two email communications
from Carter throughout the case’s history, where she claimed she would be
filing a counter motion when disclosing her availability for the hearing on
Plaintiff’s emergency motion. REC. 2794 No such countermotion was filed
by Carter. K. Summary Judgment and Notice of Hearing 26. By February 22,
no response had been filed by Carter, so Plaintiff filed a Partial Motion for
Summary Judgment. REC. 758. Plaintiff also submitted a proposed parenting
plan as Exhibit D. REC. 769. No response was ever received from Carter. 27.
On February 27, 2024, Defendant Munford signed and issued a notice of
hearing to the parties with the hearing set for March 14, 2024. REC. 776. L.
Plaintiff’s Notice to the Court and Defendant Myers’ Self-Help Remedies 28.
On March 3, 2024, Plaintiff notified the Court that he would not be leaving
the home as it was not in the best interests of his children. REC. 782. 29.
The following day, on March 6, 2024, while walking his daughters to school,
Myers ran inside the family home, and locked him out of the marital
residence, leaving a sign on the door that said “[y]ou should have been out
by Saturday you are now locked out!” REC. 1748. 30. Plaintiff called local
law enforcement to help him regain entry into the home, where mother
produced the agreed associate judge’s report signed on February 1, 2024,
and used it as a means to block Plaintiff’s entrance to the home. 31. To avoid
further conflict, Plaintiff was escorted into the home where he was able to
grab only his computer and a few clothes and went to Flower Mound to
temporarily stay with his father until the time of the hearing on his
emergency motion, scheduled for March 14, 2024, at 9:00 A.M. L. The
Hearing On Plaintiff’s Emergency Motion 32. On March 14, 2024, the

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
parties arrived at the 322nd District Court, and on the way into the
courtroom, defendants Myers and Carter could be seen in the conference
room, quickly shuffling papers back and forth. 33. After checking in with the
bailiff, Plaintiff turned around to see defendant Carter extending to him a
document titled “Temporary Orders” that were the reduced version of the
February 1 associate judge’s report. REC. 888. 34. These orders, which were
not prepared by Dan Bacalis, which were not agreed to by the parties, were
reduced well outside of the 20-day requirement as ordered by the judge, and
which were never filed with the clerk, stated the following
misrepresentations: i. On February 1, 2024, the Court heard Petitioner's
motion for temporary orders. ii. The parties have agreed to the terms of this
order as evidenced by the signatures below. REC. 888. iii. The Court, after
examining the record and the agreement of the parties and hearing the
evidence and argument of counsel, finds that all necessary prerequisites of
the law have been legally satisfied and that the Court has jurisdiction of this
case and of all the parties. REC. 888. iv. The dates that the parties would
have access to the family residence was altered, changing the date Plaintiff
was supposed to leave from March 1, 2024, to March 20, 2024, and
changing Myers’ date of re-entry from March 1, 2024, to March 30, 2024,
leaving a 10-day window where no one would occupy the residence. v. This
modification was made to prevent Myers from being liable for illegally
locking Plaintiff out of the home on March 6, 2024. 35. On the last page of
the orders, Plaintiff’s attorney who was terminated weeks earlier did not
sign the document, and Plaintiff refused to sign the document for the
forthcoming reasons: i. It claimed a hearing occurred on a motion which was
never set for a hearing or served on the Plaintiff and doesn’t exist on the
docket. ii. It was prepared by defendant Carter, not Dan Bacalis. iii. The
associate judge was presiding over a de novo request of his own prior
report. iv. The matrimonial address was incorrect, as it stated “6641 Anns
Court”, rather than 6641 Anne Court. REC. 915, REC. 922 v. The orders
were not in the best interests of the children. vi. Notwithstanding the
Plaintiff’s revocation of consent by filing the emergency motion, the terms
were altered right before they were rendered into effect by defendant
Kaitcer. vii. Plaintiff did not agree to the terms as he was in court that very
day to expose Myers. M. Predicate Acts: Extortion 36. Kaitcer, knowing that
no response was filed, knowing that he was presiding over a hearing to
which he had no subject matter jurisdiction, and knowing that the temporary
orders produced by defendant Carter was served just moments earlier,
signed another associate judge’s report pre-drafted by defendant Carter,
which summarily denied the Plaintiff’s emergency motion, ignored the fact
that Carter had not provided a response, and within the report itself,
Plaintiff was ordered to sign the document that Carter had just presented to
him despite raising objections to its’ contents, and despite his consent not
being present. REC. 795. 37. Finally, defendant Kaitcer refused to consider
Plaintiff’s exhibits, including six affidavits prepared by his business clients
who have been directly affected by his inability to provide the real-time
market data services his clients relied on, who were located throughout the
United States. REC. 851; REC. 854; REC. 857; REC. 860; REC. 863; REC.
867; REC. 870. 38. Following the setting, the orders were rendered into
effect without Plaintiff’s signature (REC. 925) , and Plaintiff filed a request
for findings of fact and conclusions of law (REC. 883), and filed and
amended a “Preparatory Notice for Judicial Review” which recounted the

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
factual timeline up to that point, and included the affidavits that Kaitcer
refused to accept on March 14, 2024. REC. 798, REC. 851, REC. 854, REC.
857, REC. 860, REC. 863, REC. 867, REC. 870. 39. The orders stated they
were to remain in effect until the final decree of divorce, and Plaintiff’s
journey of one-sided appeals began. N. One Sided Appellate Efforts, and
Defective IWO 40. Following the rendition of the temporary orders on March
26, 2024, Plaintiff spent between April 8, 2024 and September 15, 2024,
appealing via mandamus to the Second Court of Appeals and the Texas
Supreme Court. REC. 1010. 41. During the appellate efforts, Carter filed one
of two motions in the case, which was a motion for pre-trial conference filed
on April 24, 2024, on her behalf by Roderick D. Marx, a party not named in
the suit. REC. 1014, REC. 1016. 42. Plaintiff immediately objected to the
pre-trial conference, and no response was ever issued by Carter or the
court. REC. 1018. 43. On April 30th, Plaintiff filed his notice of completion
regarding the parenting course as ordered, despite actively trying to vacate
them. REC. 1047. No parenting course was ever completed by Myers. 44. On
May 2, 2024, Plaintiff’s en banc reconsideration was denied in the Second
Court of Appeals, and he began preparing an appeal to the Supreme Court
of Texas. REC. 1067. 45. On May 19, 2024, Carter sent the second and last
email correspondence that would be received in the case, which falsely
claimed he agreed to the orders signed on March 14, 2024, and requested
that he fill out an IWO, which Plaintiff found to be defective. REC. 1722,
REC. 1728. No further correspondence was received by Carter. O.
Fraudulent Intervention and Branthoover’s Continued Involvement 46. On
June 23rd Plaintiff filed a motion in state court entitled MOTION FOR
JOINDER OF PERSONS NEEDED FOR JUST ADJUDICATION at 12:14 P.M.
REC. 1075. This motion received no response from Carter. 47. On June 23rd
at 1:54 P.M., directly following the submission of the motion, Branthoover
texted Plaintiff stating “Lol. And here comes another denial. Please sue me
individually. Please.”, referring to the earlier filed motion and showing his
continued oversight of the case’s progression since his initial predicate acts.
48. Four days later, on June 28, 2024, the Texas Office of the Attorney
General allegedly filed an intervention pleading, claiming that Plaintiff was
past due on child support, and requested information from Plaintiff. REC.
1099. 49. Most notably, the certificate of service to this intervention
pleading was allegedly signed by Holly Hayes, the designated attorney for
the OAG, yet the name underneath the signature line reads CHOYA
BURKLEY. REC. 1102. 50. Plaintiff promptly objected to the intervention,
and never received any response from the OAG, Carter, or the court. REC.
1106. P. Supreme Court, Rule 12, and Emergency Temporary Orders 51. As
Plaintiff continued to appeal to the Supreme Court of Texas, all prosecution
came to an end in the trial court. It wasn’t until September 15, 2024, that
Plaintiff filed a first amended rehearing motion in the Texas Supreme Court,
(REC. 1136) and after noticing Carter’s lack of participation, he began to
question her authority given several ambiguities surrounding her
representation, and filed a rule 12 motion to show authority. REC. 1170. No
response was ever received to this motion from Carter. 52. At this point,
Plaintiff had been staying in Airbnb homes while he sought relief to ensure
he could remain close to his daughters during this time. On September 26,
2024, he filed and later amended an EMERGENCY MOTION FOR
TEMPORARY ORDERS and requested expedited relief by October 1, 2024,
as that was when Plaintiff was forced to move away from the area due to

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
cost of living being unsustainable. REC. 1184. No response was ever
received from Carter regarding this motion. 53. By October 1, Plaintiff had
no choice but to start pursuing administrative remedies, and thought the
court was biased against him given the case’s history up to that point. He
began to prepare a Joint Motion to Recuse defendants Munford and Kaitcer
and filed it with the clerk of the court on October 7, 2024. REC. 1197. Q.
Predicate Act: Wire Fraud 54. On October 8, 2024, Defendant Munford
signed and forwarded a “Joint Motion to Recuse” attached to his order of
referral to regional presiding judge David L. Evans but was notably missing
the exhibits and affidavit critical to the motion. REC. 1222 55. A copy of this
exchange was sent via defendant Baker on 4:43 P.M. on October 8. REC.
1254 56. Plaintiff immediately pointed out the discrepancies between the
motion filed and the motion forwarded to David L. Evans, where she replied
and admitted that the full document had been e-filed and remains with the
court. REC. 1255 57. Unsatisfied with this response, Plaintiff further pointed
out that the filing size of the document filed and the one referring to David
L. Evans was significantly different. No further correspondence was
received by Baker until the following day. REC. 1256 58. The following day
on October 8, 2024, defendant Munford signed and filed an “Amended Order
of Referral” which had the full motion attached this time, albeit still
modified as the hyperlinks and bookmarks had been removed. REC. 1282 59.
This amended referral was sent via email correspondence by Baker at 11:17
A.M. on October 8, 2024, who stated that due to the size of the motion, it
was split into three parts. REC. 1258. This excuse directly contradicts the
standard filing procedure in Tarrant County, which was raised and
subsequently ignored in an objection. REC. 1269. No response was filed in
regard to the motion to recuse or objection by Carter. R. Recusal Denial and
More Delays, and Federal Removal 60. Justice E. Lee Gabriel was assigned
to hear the motion, which had to be rescheduled due to technical difficulties
for November 7, 2024. REC. 1306. 61. The morning of the hearing, Plaintiff
woke up with a dental emergency, and promptly notified all parties, and
requested a reset for the hearing, which everyone agreed to. REC.
1393-1396. 62. Despite this agreement, the recusal was denied for failure to
appear, and made no mention of the agreement or the emergency. REC.
1398. 63. With no other remedies left, Plaintiff removed the case to Federal
Court on December 2, 2024, which was quickly remanded back on
December 4, 2024. REC. 1426. 64. On December 14, 2024, defendant
Branthoover texted Plaintiff, sending a threat which stated “[w]hen things
all over, you get to deal with me.” at 2:15 P.M. REC. 1720 65. On December
16, 2024, Plaintiff initiated suit against Daniel Kenneth Branthoover in the
Western District of Oklahoma seeking relief in the form of damages from the
ongoing deprivation from his home. REC. 1451. 66. Plaintiff notified the
Texas court of this lawsuit on December 31, 2024. REC. 1446. S. Further
Delays, Motion to Dismiss for Want of Prosecution, and the Original SAPCR
67. On January 24, 2025, Plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss for want of
prosecution due to the total lack of participation in the case by the opposing
party. REC. 1527. No response was ever received from Carter on this
motion. 68. On January 29, 2025, defendant Myers began disposing of
Plaintiff’s personal belongings that remained on the family property. REC.
1629-1631. 69. On February 12, 2025, Plaintiff learned that his youngest
daughter was suffering from dental pain due to Myers’ failure to obtain
dental insurance for the children. REC. 3281. 70. By March 14, (REC.

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
1833-1837) the judges had still not been reinstated from the first recusal,
which lad Plaintiff to reach out to Baker to request a hearing on his
unopposed summary judgment that had been on the docket since February
22, 2024, where he had to remind her to reinstate the judges back into the
case. REC. 1833-1837. 71. Given the delays, and since the case had been
brought in bad faith initially, the Plaintiff opened an original SAPCR suit in
the 233rd District Court of Tarrant County on March 18, 2025, where he
argued for dominant jurisdiction in a cover letter sent to the clerk. REC.
2260. T. Counsel Suddenly Becomes Active 72. The very next day, defendant
Carter filed an original answer filed on her behalf by Roderick Marx. REC.
2279. The motion was a boilerplate motion, and was followed by a motion to
consolidate, which was filed in the wrong court, and was also filed on
Carter’s behalf by RODERICK D. MARX. REC. 2284. 73. The Plaintiff
immediately responded by filing a motion to strike (REC. 1957) a Rule 12
motion to show authority challenging both Carter and RODERICK D MARX’s
authority (REC. 2288) and on March 24, 2025, an emergency ex-parte TRO
to prevent Myers from barring Plaintiff’s access to the home. (REC. 2302)
No responses were ever received from Carter on these motions. 74. On
March 26, 2025, an objection was filed to Carter’s consolidation motion in
the 233rd court. REC. 1881. 75. Plaintiff reached out to the coordinator from
the 233rd and went through the process to present the motion to the judge.
REC. 2338-2341. 76. On March 29, 2025, Plaintiff appeared before Associate
Judge Kate Stone, who refused to hear Plaintiff’s emergency motion despite
no response being filed, and told him to leave the courtroom. The hearing
date scheduled for April 10, 2025, as agreed by Carter and Plaintiff (REC.
2358), was actually un-set by Stone. REC. 2361. 77. The grounds for this
outright refusal was due to Carter calling in a favor from the judge without
even being present in the courtroom, to where Stone left the room, came
back, and told the Plaintiff to leave informing him that a motion to
consolidate would be filed by Carter the following week. U. Five Concurrent
Mandamus Petitions 78. Subsequently, after he was turned away from the
courtroom, Carter’s consolidation motion wasn’t filed until April 4, 2025
(REC. 2367), resulting in two mandamus petitions to try again to have the
March 14, 2024, order signed by Kaitcer vacated, and to compel Kate Stone
to hear the emergency TRO. See 25-0361, 25-0367. 79. On the same day the
mandamus was filed against Stone, District Judge Kenneth Newell sua
sponte granted Carter’s consolidation motion in both courts without a
hearing, and without addressing the emergency situation for the children or
the Plaintiff’s objections, leading to a third mandamus proceeding. REC.
2393, See also 25-0378. 80. On April 23, 2025, a notice of trial setting was
served on the parties by defendant Munford in the midst of all of these
issues. REC. 1773. 81. The same day, Plaintiff filed an objection and
requested an emergency stay. REC. 2219. No response was received to this
objection by either Munford or Carter. 82. Two days later on April 25, 2025,
Plaintiff filed his second recusal motion, and amended it on April 28, 2025,
this time only against Munford, and requested that the rules of procedure be
followed, and objected to the involvement of the court coordinator given the
prior recusal’s ambiguity and significant delays caused by her involvement.
REC. 2488 No response to this motion was ever filed from Carter. 83. Baker
continued to be involved in the recusal process, this time erroneously
forwarding an order of referral from defendant Kaitcer, who was not named
in the recusal motion. REC. 2615. 84. Plaintiff immediately objected on April

=== PAGE 9 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
29, 2025, naming two issues: 1) the coordinator was still involved, and 2) the
order of referral sent by Kaitcer was erroneous. REC. 2620. 84. Plaintiff
objected to the order of assignment of John H. Cayce (REC. 3149) which was
issued on May 7, 2025, due to the unresolves issues. REC. 2620. 85. David L.
Evans overruled this objection on May 15, 2025, leading to mandamus
petition 25-0426, a direct appeal to the Texas Supreme Court. REC. 3507.
86. On May 20, 2025, John H. Cayce summarily denied the recusal, including
the denial of a motion to recuse Kaitcer which was never filed, leading to
mandamus petition 25-0458, a second direct appeal to the Texas Supreme
Court. 87. All five petitions were denied both initially and on rehearing, and
all emergency motions to stay proceedings were dismissed. The only insights
given from the appellate courts was: “Denied, per curiam.” No response was
filed by any implicated judge or opposing counsel. V. Federal RICO Case and
the Push Towards Final Trial 88. In June of 2025, Plaintiff amended his
complaint against Daniel Kenneth Branthoover and enjoined Myers as a
defendant, which they defended pro-se. 89. Plaintiff communicated this
action with the trial court, and no further action was taken in the case until
August of 2025, when defendant Munford sua sponte set the case for final
trial on December 10, 2025. 90. Plaintiff immediately objected to this trial
setting, and moved to recuse Munford for a third time. 91. The court
coordinator continued to be involved in the process, leading to a subsequent
motion to recuse the regional presiding judge, David L. Evans. 92. Plaintiff
now prepares this suit to hold defendants accountable for their collective
actions, and to prevent their common goal from being achieved, which is to
obtain defendant Myers a final decree of divorce. 93. For the forthcoming
reasons, the conduct outlined herein constitutes conduct of an enterprise
through a pattern of racketeering activity, as several predicate acts were
committed, the enterprise shares a common purpose, and Plaintiff has
suffered direct and ongoing injury to business and property as a direct result
of the defendant’s collective predicate acts. RICO The timeline and evidence
provided demonstrate that the Myers-Branthoover group constitutes an
association-in-fact enterprise under RICO, with a common goal to deprive
the Plaintiff of his home and business through a pattern of racketeering
activity—specifically, wire fraud, Travel Act violations, and fraudulent court
filings—causing direct injury to the Plaintiff’s business and property. The
conduct, structure, and continuity among the participants, as well as the use
of interstate communications and travel, satisfy the elements of a RICO
claim in the Tenth Circuit, with the liability of other defendants depending
on their knowledge and intent. A. Summary The Myers-Branthoover
enterprise, as detailed in the factual timeline, meets the Tenth Circuit’s
requirements for a RICO claim by establishing an association-in-fact
enterprise with a defined structure, purpose, and continuity. The group’s
coordinated actions—including interstate transfer of funds, preparation and
submission of fraudulent legal documents, and ongoing manipulation of
court proceedings—constitute a pattern of racketeering activity, with
predicate acts of wire fraud and Travel Act violations that are related and
continuous. Plaintiff’s direct and ongoing injury to his business and property,
including loss of home, business operations, and client relationships, is
proximately caused by the enterprise’s acts. While Myers and Branthoover’s
liability is clear, the involvement of other defendants (Munford, Kaitcer,
Carter, and Baker) may be characterized as inadvertent or willing
participation, depending on their knowledge and intent, but the core

=== PAGE 10 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
elements of a RICO violation are satisfied by the conduct of Myers and
Branthoover as outlined in the enumerated timeline. The additional acts
committed by each defendant, as alleged, furthered the scheme of the
enterprise despite each additional defendant having actual knowledge of the
fraudulent scheme. RICO Statutory Framework The Racketeer Influenced
and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), codified at 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961–1968,
provides a civil cause of action for individuals injured in their business or
property by reason of a pattern of racketeering activity conducted through
an enterprise affecting interstate or foreign commerce. The most commonly
invoked provision, § 1962(c), prohibits any person employed by or associated
with an enterprise from conducting or participating in the conduct of such
enterprise’s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity. Section
1962(d) further prohibits conspiracies to violate any of the substantive RICO
provisions. To establish a civil RICO claim under § 1962(c), a plaintiff must
prove: i. The existence of an enterprise; ii. The enterprise’s engagement in,
or effect on, interstate or foreign commerce; iii. The defendant’s
employment by or association with the enterprise; iv. The defendant’s
participation, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of the enterprise’s affairs;
v. The defendant’s participation through a pattern of racketeering activity or
collection of unlawful debt. See 100 Mount Holly Bypass v. Axos Bank, Case
No. 2:20-CV-856-TS-CMR (D. Utah Jul 27, 2021). B. Predicate Acts and
Pattern Requirement RICO defines “racketeering activity” to include a wide
range of criminal offenses, including wire fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343) and
violations of the Travel Act (18 U.S.C. § 1952). A “pattern of racketeering
activity” requires at least two predicate acts within a ten-year period, but
the acts must be related and amount to or pose a threat of continued
criminal activity. The Supreme Court has clarified that a RICO violation
requires both an “enterprise” and a “pattern of racketeering activity,” with
the enterprise being a group of persons associated for a common purpose,
and the pattern involving a series of criminal acts (United States v. Harris,
695 F.3d 1125 (10th Cir. 2012)). The Tenth Circuit has further explained
that, to establish a pattern, it is not enough to simply show that two
predicate acts occurred within ten years; the acts must also be related and
pose a threat of continued criminal activity (U.S. v. Smith, 413 F.3d 1253
(10th Cir. 2005)). Note, however, that U.S. v. Smith has been stated as
overruled by United States v. Nissen, 555 F.Supp.3d 1174 (D. N.M. 2021) on
unrelated grounds, but its articulation of the pattern requirement remains
consistent with current law. C. Enterprise and Association-in-Fact An
“enterprise” under RICO includes any individual, partnership, corporation,
association, or group of individuals associated in fact, even if not a legal
entity. For an association-in-fact enterprise, the Tenth Circuit requires: i. A
purpose; ii. Relationships among those associated with the enterprise; iii.
Longevity sufficient to permit the associates to pursue the enterprise’s
purpose; iv. A decision-making framework or mechanism for controlling the
group; v. Functioning as a continuing unit; vi. Existence separate and apart
from the pattern of racketeering activity. See 100 Mount Holly Bypass. D.
Conspiracy Section 1962(d) makes it unlawful to conspire to violate any of
the substantive RICO provisions. A RICO conspiracy does not require the
establishment of an enterprise but requires that a defendant adopts the goal
of furthering or facilitating a criminal endeavor that would satisfy the
elements of a substantive RICO offense (United States v. Martinez, 543
F.Supp.3d 1209 (D. N.M. 2021); United States v. Randall, 661 F.3d 1291

=== PAGE 11 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
(10th Cir. 2011)). E. Injury Requirement RICO provides a private right of
action for individuals injured in their business or property through
fraudulent conduct, and there is no requirement that the conduct be
connected to organized crime in a civil setting (Plains Resources, Inc. v.
Gable, 782 F.2d 883 (10th Cir. 1986)). ANALYSIS F. Existence of an
Association-in-Fact Enterprise The timeline establishes that Myers and
Branthoover formed an association-in-fact enterprise beginning in December
2023 (¶¶ 1–7, 93). Their collaboration was structured, with Myers as the
petitioner in the divorce and Branthoover as the planner, drafter, and
facilitator of fraudulent documents and financial transactions. The group
had a clear purpose: to divest the Plaintiff of his home and business through
fraudulent legal filings and manipulation of court processes (¶¶ 1–7, 93).
The enterprise’s structure is evidenced by: i. The initial planning and
agreement to meet in Yukon, Oklahoma, to draft fraudulent documents (¶¶
1–3); ii. The use of interstate communications and travel to further the
scheme (¶¶ 2–3); iii. Ongoing coordination and adaptation to changing
circumstances, including the preparation and submission of false affidavits
and pleadings, and manipulation of court proceedings (¶¶ 5–7, 34, 93). This
satisfies the Tenth Circuit’s requirements for an association-in-fact
enterprise, which does not require a formal legal entity but does require a
common purpose, relationships, and sufficient longevity to pursue the
enterprise’s goals. G. Structure, Purpose, Relationships, and Continuity The
Myers-Branthoover group meets the requirements for an association-in-fact
enterprise: i. Purpose: The shared goal was to deprive the Plaintiff of his
home, business, and property interests through fraudulent means (¶¶ 1–7,
93). ii. Relationships: Myers and Branthoover maintained ongoing
communications, coordinated actions, and divided roles in the scheme (¶¶ 1–
7, 93). iii. Longevity and Continuity: The enterprise operated over a
substantial period, from at least December 2023 through present day 2025,
with multiple related acts and ongoing adaptation to changing
circumstances (¶¶ 1–93). iv. Decision-Making Framework: The group
planned, agreed on steps, and executed those steps in a coordinated manner
(¶¶ 1–7, 93). v. Existence Separate from Predicate Acts: The enterprise was
formed for the purpose of achieving a specific goal and engaged in multiple
acts over time to accomplish that goal. H. Predicate Acts: Wire Fraud, Travel
Act Violations, and Fraudulent Filings The timeline identifies multiple
predicate acts that qualify as racketeering activity under RICO: i. Wire
Fraud: Myers transferred $1,576 in marital funds to Branthoover’s PayPal
account during interstate travel, and these funds were used to purchase a
phone for use in the fraudulent scheme (¶¶ 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 34). The use of
electronic communications (text messages, emails) to plan and execute the
scheme further supports the wire fraud allegation (¶¶ 1–7, 34). ii. Travel Act
Violations: Myers traveled from Texas to Oklahoma to meet with
Branthoover, where they planned and prepared fraudulent legal documents,
which were then transported back to Texas and submitted to the court (¶¶ 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, 7). iii. Fraudulent Filings: The preparation and submission of false
affidavits and pleadings to the court, containing material misrepresentations
about financial status, family violence, and property ownership, constitute
further predicate acts (¶¶ 5, 6, 7, 34). At least two related predicate acts
within ten years are required (U.S. v. Smith, 413 F.3d 1253 (10th Cir. 2005)),
and the timeline shows multiple, related predicate acts over a substantial
period (¶¶ 1–93). I. Pattern of Racketeering Activity: Relatedness and

=== PAGE 12 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Continuity The predicate acts were not isolated incidents but part of an
ongoing scheme. The acts were related in that they all aimed to deprive the
Plaintiff of his property and business, and they posed a threat of continued
criminal activity, as the enterprise continued to operate and adapt its tactics
over time (¶¶ 1–93). The timeline shows that the enterprise’s activities
extended over a substantial period, with multiple acts occurring over
months and involving ongoing coordination and adaptation to changing
circumstances. J. Injury to Business or Property Plaintiff suffered direct and
ongoing injury to his business and property as a result of the enterprise’s
actions. He was deprived of his home and business operations, lost access to
marital funds, and was unable to provide services to clients, resulting in
financial harm (¶¶ 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 37). These injuries are precisely the type
of harm RICO is designed to redress. Plains Resources, Inc. v. Gable, 782 F.
2d 883 (10th Cir. 1986)). K. Participation of Other Defendants: Inadvertent
or Willing The timeline raises the question of whether Munford, Kaitcer,
Carter, and Baker were victims of the initial scheme or willing participants
in the expanded enterprise. The evidence suggests that, at a minimum,
Myers and Branthoover were the core members of the enterprise, with
others potentially becoming involved through their actions in the legal
proceedings (¶¶ 14–93). i. Inadvertent Participation: Some defendants may
have participated inadvertently, such as by issuing orders or facilitating
court processes without knowledge of the underlying scheme (¶¶ 14–93). ii.
Willing Participation: Others may have become willing participants if they
knowingly furthered the enterprise’s objectives or ignored clear evidence of
fraud and misrepresentation (¶¶ 14–93). RICO does not impose liability for
inadvertent or unwitting participation; there must be knowing and willful
involvement in the conduct of the enterprise’s affairs. For the forthcoming
reasons, Plaintiff alleges that the Defendants are willing participants in the
scheme. VICTIM OR PARTICIPANT RICO liability extends to those who
knowingly participate in the conduct of the enterprise’s affairs, even if they
were not original members (RICO: A Primer (2022-01-31)). The timeline
raises the question of whether Munford, Kaitcer, Carter, and Baker were
victims of the initial scheme or willing participants in the expanded
enterprise. The evidence suggests that, at a minimum, Myers and
Branthoover were the core members of the enterprise, with others becoming
involved through their actions in the legal proceedings (¶¶ 14–93). The
timeline demonstrates that Carter, Kaitcer, and Myers engaged in extortion
by leveraging the threat of adverse legal action, fraudulent court orders, and
the manipulation of judicial process to coerce Plaintiff into relinquishing
property and business interests, satisfying the elements of extortion as a
predicate act under RICO and the Travel Act. Munford and Baker, for their
part, committed wire fraud by intentionally sending altered or incomplete
court documents via interstate email, with the intent to mislead, obstruct
relief, and further the enterprise’s objective of finalizing the divorce and
depriving Plaintiff of his property, thus meeting the requirements for wire
fraud as a RICO predicate act. These acts, as detailed in the timeline, are
not isolated but part of a coordinated pattern of racketeering activity within
an association-in-fact enterprise, as required by RICO in the Tenth Circuit.
The conduct of each defendant is tied to specific predicate acts—extortion
for Carter, Kaitcer, and Myers (notably at timeline events 33–37), and wire
fraud for Munford and Baker (notably at events 54–59, 83)—demonstrating
knowing and willful participation in the enterprise’s broader scheme to

=== PAGE 13 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
deprive Plaintiff of his home and business through fraudulent and coercive
means. A. Extortion and Wire Fraud The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961–1968, provides a civil cause of
action for injury to business or property caused by a pattern of racketeering
activity conducted through an enterprise affecting interstate commerce.
Predicate acts under RICO include extortion (as defined by the Hobbs Act
and the Travel Act) and wire fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343), among others.
Extortion is defined as obtaining property from another, with his consent,
induced by wrongful use of actual or threatened force, violence, or fear, or
under color of official right. The Travel Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1952, includes
extortion as an “unlawful activity” and does not require it to be part of a
business enterprise (U.S. v. Welch, 327 F.3d 1081 (10th Cir. 2003)). The
Tenth Circuit recognizes that extortion under the Travel Act can be
established by showing threats or coercion to obtain something of value,
including property or legal rights, in violation of state or federal law. Wire
fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343 requires (1) a scheme to defraud or obtain
property by false or fraudulent pretenses, (2) intent to defraud, and (3) use
of interstate wire communications to execute the scheme (Clinton v. Sec.
Benefit Life Ins. Co., 63 F.4th 1264 (10th Cir. 2023); United States v.
Holloway, 826 F.3d 1237 (10th Cir. 2016)). The Tenth Circuit requires that
the deprivation of property be a central object of the scheme, and that the
use of wires (including email) be knowing and in furtherance of the
fraudulent scheme (United States v. Tao, 629 F.Supp.3d 1083). B. Extortion
by Carter, Kaitcer, and Myers Extortion, as a RICO predicate act, is defined
broadly under federal law and the Travel Act. It includes obtaining property
or rights through threats, coercion, or misuse of official process (U.S. v.
Welch, 327 F.3d 1081 (10th Cir. 2003)). The Tenth Circuit does not require
extortion to be part of a business enterprise for Travel Act purposes; a single
act suffices if it has the requisite interstate nexus. The timeline shows the
following: i. Event 33–34: Carter, with Myers, prepared and presented
“Temporary Orders” that misrepresented facts (e.g., that Plaintiff agreed to
terms he did not, that a hearing occurred when it did not, and that the
orders were in the best interests of the children). These orders altered the
dates of access to the home to shield Myers from liability for locking Plaintiff
out, and were presented to Plaintiff in a context where he was under threat
of losing his home and business. iii. Event 36: Kaitcer, knowing the orders
were disputed and that no response had been filed, signed an associate
judge’s report pre-drafted by Carter, summarily denying Plaintiff’s
emergency motion and ordering Plaintiff to sign the disputed document,
despite his objections and lack of consent. iv. Event 35: Plaintiff refused to
sign the orders for multiple reasons, including their fraudulent content and
the lack of due process, but the orders were rendered into effect without his
signature. These acts collectively demonstrate the use of legal process and
the threat of adverse judicial action to coerce Plaintiff into surrendering his
property and business interests. The manipulation of court orders, the
misrepresentation of facts, and the pressure to sign under threat of losing
his home constitute extortion under the Travel Act and RICO (U.S. v. Welch,
327 F.3d 1081 (10th Cir. 2003). Myers’s role is clear: she was the beneficiary
and instigator of the fraudulent filings and the manipulation of court
process, using the threat of legal action and the actual deprivation of
Plaintiff’s property to achieve her goal. Carter and Kaitcer acted in concert
with Myers, knowingly facilitating the extortion by preparing, presenting,

=== PAGE 14 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
and enforcing fraudulent orders, and by using the authority of the court to
coerce Plaintiff. The fact that Plaintiff was ordered to sign a document he
objected to, under threat of continued deprivation of his home and business,
is classic extortion by color of official right. All three defendants knew that
Plaintiff did not agree to the order, as he had just fired his attorney to
challenge any basis for an agreement. This implies that despite the motion
being served on all defendants, they chose to ignore the allegations of a
fraudulent scheme and further the affairs of the enterprise. These actions
meet the requirements for extortion as a RICO predicate act: they involved
the wrongful use of threats and official process to obtain property (the home
and business) from Plaintiff, with his consent induced by fear of further loss
or legal harm. The acts were not isolated but part of a coordinated scheme
to achieve the enterprise’s goal of finalizing the divorce and divesting
Plaintiff of his property B. Wire Fraud by Munford and Baker Wire fraud
under 18 U.S.C. § 1343 requires a scheme to defraud, intent to defraud, and
use of interstate wire communications to execute the scheme (Clinton v. Sec.
Benefit Life Ins. Co., 63 F.4th 1264 (10th Cir. 2023); United States v.
Holloway, 826 F.3d 1237 (10th Cir. 2016)). The Tenth Circuit recognizes that
sending altered or incomplete court documents via email, with the intent to
mislead or deprive someone of property or rights, can constitute wire fraud
if the deprivation of property is a central object of the scheme (United
States v. Tao, 629 F.Supp.3d 1083). The timeline shows the following: i.
Event 54: Munford signed and forwarded a “Joint Motion to Recuse”
attached to his order of referral, but the document was missing critical
exhibits and affidavits necessary for Plaintiff’s relief. ii. Event 55: Baker sent
a copy of this incomplete filing via email, representing it as the full
document. iii. Event 56–57: When Plaintiff pointed out the discrepancies,
Baker provided inconsistent explanations, first claiming the full document
was e-filed, then later stating it was split into three parts due to size. iv.
Event 58: Munford signed and filed an “Amended Order of Referral” with the
full motion attached, but with hyperlinks and bookmarks removed, further
impairing the document’s integrity. v. Event 59, 83: Baker continued to
forward altered or incomplete orders and referrals, even when procedural
irregularities were raised. These acts involved the knowing use of interstate
email to transmit altered or incomplete court documents, with the intent to
prevent Plaintiff from obtaining relief and to further the enterprise’s goal of
finalizing the divorce and depriving Plaintiff of his property. The use of email
to transmit these documents satisfies the interstate wire requirement, and
the intent to defraud is evidenced by the deliberate alteration and
misrepresentation of the filings. The conduct of Munford and Baker meets
the elements of wire fraud: (1) a scheme to defraud Plaintiff of property and
rights, (2) intent to defraud by preventing relief and misleading the court
and Plaintiff, and (3) use of interstate wire communications (email) to
execute the scheme (Clinton v. Sec. Benefit Life Ins. Co., 63 F.4th 1264 (10th
Cir. 2023)). The deprivation of property (Plaintiff’s home and business) was
a central object of the scheme, not a minor part. RELATIONSHIP AND
CONTINUITY All these acts—extortion by Carter, Kaitcer, and Myers, and
wire fraud by Munford and Baker—were committed in furtherance of the
Myers-Branthoover enterprise’s overarching objective: to finalize the
divorce and divest Plaintiff of his home and business. The acts were
coordinated, continuous, and related, satisfying the RICO pattern
requirement. The timeline shows that each defendant’s conduct was not an

=== PAGE 15 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
isolated error or routine administrative act, but part of a deliberate scheme
to use the legal process, threats, and fraudulent communications to achieve
the enterprise’s unlawful goals. DAMAGES The harm inflicted upon Plaintiff
is staggering. He has lost the home in which he lived for nearly a third of his
life, the companionship of his spouse, and the society of his children. His
income has collapsed. For two years he has been consigned to a futile
appellate gauntlet, even as Defendants Munford, Kaitcer, Baker, and Carter
have repeatedly exceeded the bounds of their lawful authority in furtherance
of a broader scheme. What began as a concerted effort by Myers and
Branthoover to dispossess Plaintiff of his residence and property
metastasized into a calculated plan to procure a final decree of divorce once
the initial objective had been achieved. The objective was plain: by
engineering a final decree, Defendants would not only hobble Plaintiff’s
ability to bring this suit but also invite invocation of the Rooker–Feldman
doctrine and related abstention principles to preclude federal jurisdiction.
Now, after two years of unremitting effort, Plaintiff seeks the only
meaningful remedy remaining: federal redress to halt the ongoing abuses of
authority, to unwind tainted actions, and to compensate him fully for the
catastrophic losses Defendants have wrought. Month Total charged

0.00% 0.00% 2.49 0.28% USD Take the data above, and argue this theory:
**Plaintiff began to build a market-data infrastructure in 2022, and exploded
beyond his capability, requiring him to dial back and familiarize himself with
database management systems and to eventually upgrade the internet
connection at the family residence to handle the ultra-low latency that his
clients relied upon. The data shows that in 2022 the business income
exploded to upwards of 12,000 per month, and then immediately crashed
thereafter due to the inabiltiy to handle customer demands at that time. He
spent the next two years equipping himself and upgrading his systems to
handle a much larger amount of traffic, and prepared to re-launch in january
of 2024. That's when Myers suddenly announced a divorce, and intentionally
lied to try and gain the house and custody of the kids, which worked. This
has effectively shut down the business, because it needs to be argued that
no reasonable person could pick up a system highly dependant on a specific
internet setup and ultra-low latency, and expect to just go stay with someone
else. Then total the losses, account for the future losses given the nearly
two-year period where plaintiff has been unable to operate and scale, and tie
it to the facts and the data above. The loss of the business premises and
infrastructure was a direct result of the coordinated actions of Myers and
her associates, as detailed in the RICO timeline. Plaintiff’s inability to
operate and scale the business is not attributable to market forces or
Plaintiff’s own conduct, but to the deprivation of the specialized
infrastructure and the ongoing legal interference. RICO requires that the
injury to business or property be proximately caused by the pattern of
racketeering activity. See Holmes v. Sec. Investor Prot. Corp., 503 U.S. 258,
268 (1992); Bixler v. Foster, 596 F.3d 751, 757 (10th Cir. 2010). The evidence
and data show a direct causal link between Defendants’ conduct and

=== PAGE 18 ===

Plaintiff’s business losses, satisfying the proximate cause requirement for
RICO and tort damages. 
Answer (Tenth Circuit)
Short response
The evidence and business data demonstrate that Plaintiff’s market-data
business was directly and proximately destroyed by the coordinated
racketeering activity of Myers and her associates, who deprived him of the
specialized infrastructure and premises essential to its operation. Under
controlling Tenth Circuit RICO authority, these losses are compensable as
they were not caused by market forces or Plaintiff’s own conduct, but by the
Defendants’ pattern of racketeering activity.
Summary
Plaintiff’s business, which experienced rapid growth in 2022 and required
significant technical upgrades to support its specialized, ultra-low-latency
infrastructure, was poised for a relaunch in early 2024. However, the sudden
and coordinated actions of Myers and her associates—culminating in
Plaintiff’s removal from the family home and business premises through
fraudulent legal filings and judicial manipulation—directly prevented
Plaintiff from operating or scaling his business, resulting in catastrophic and
ongoing financial losses.
The business data, when viewed alongside the detailed RICO timeline,
shows a clear causal link between Defendants’ racketeering acts and
Plaintiff’s inability to generate income or maintain client relationships.
Tenth Circuit precedent confirms that such direct injury to business or
property, proximately caused by a pattern of racketeering activity, is
actionable under RICO, and the facts here satisfy both the legal and
evidentiary requirements for recovery.
Background and Relevant Law
RICO Statutory Framework and Elements
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), codified at
18 U.S.C. §§ 1961–1968, provides a civil remedy for individuals injured in
their business or property by reason of a pattern of racketeering activity
conducted through an enterprise affecting interstate or foreign commerce.
To establish a civil RICO claim under § 1962(c), a plaintiff must show: (1)
conduct, (2) of an enterprise, (3) through a pattern, (4) of racketeering
activity. At least two predicate acts are required, and the injury must be both
a “but for” and proximate result of the racketeering activity, not merely
incidental or remote (Deck v. Engineered Laminates, 349 F.3d 1253 (10th
Cir. 2003); CGC Holding Co. v. Broad & Cassel, 773 F.3d 1076 (10th Cir.
2014)).

=== PAGE 19 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
RICO’s remedial purpose is to be interpreted broadly, and the statute is
designed to provide a private right of action for those directly injured by
racketeering activity, including wire fraud and extortion (Clinton v. Sec.
Benefit Life Ins. Co., 63 F.4th 1264 (10th Cir. 2023)). There is no
requirement in a civil RICO case to show a connection to organized crime; it
is sufficient to show a pattern of racketeering activity that injures the
plaintiff’s business or property (Plains Resources, Inc. v. Gable, 782 F.2d 883
(10th Cir. 1986)).
To recover, a plaintiff must show a concrete financial loss to business or
property, and that the loss was proximately caused by the RICO violation
(Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy (2024)). The “by reason of” language in §
1964(c) imposes a proximate cause requirement, meaning the injury must be
a direct result of the predicate acts (CGC Holding Co. v. Broad & Cassel, 773
F.3d 1076 (10th Cir. 2014)).
Proximate Cause and Direct Injury
The Supreme Court and Tenth Circuit have repeatedly held that RICO
damages are recoverable only for injuries proximately caused by the
predicate acts, not for injuries that are speculative, indirect, or attributable
to other causes (CGC Holding Co. v. Broad & Cassel, 773 F.3d 1076 (10th
Cir. 2014); Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy (2024)). The plaintiff must be the
“direct target” of the fraudulent scheme, and the injury must not be the
result of independent intervening causes.
Analysis
1. Business Data and Factual Causation
The business records show that Plaintiff’s market-data business experienced
explosive growth in 2022, with monthly gross receipts peaking at over
$14,000 in August 2022 and consistently exceeding $8,000–$10,000 per
month for much of that year. This growth outpaced Plaintiff’s technical
capacity, necessitating a period of retrenchment and investment in
infrastructure, including upgrades to database management and internet
connectivity at the family residence, which doubled as the business’s
operational hub.
The data then shows a sharp decline in revenue after the 2022 peak,
consistent with Plaintiff’s need to pause and retool the business to handle
increased demand. Throughout 2023, Plaintiff’s earnings stabilized at a
lower level, reflecting a period of technical preparation and system
upgrades, with the clear intent to relaunch at scale in January 2024.
However, in December 2023, Myers initiated a coordinated campaign—
together with Branthoover and, as the timeline alleges, with the knowing
participation of other defendants—to remove Plaintiff from the home and
business premises through fraudulent legal filings, misrepresentations, and
judicial manipulation. This resulted in Plaintiff’s physical exclusion from the
premises, loss of access to the specialized internet and hardware

=== PAGE 20 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
infrastructure, and the effective destruction of his ability to operate or scale
the business.
2. The Necessity of Specialized Infrastructure
The business at issue was not a generic or easily portable enterprise.
Plaintiff’s market-data operation depended on ultra-low-latency internet
connectivity, specialized hardware, and a stable, secure environment to
deliver real-time data services to clients in the United States, Canada, and
the United Kingdom. The technical requirements for such a business are not
easily replicated in a temporary or residential setting, and the loss of the
family home meant the loss of the only location equipped to support the
business’s operational needs.
No reasonable person could expect to relocate such a business to a friend’s
house, a hotel, or a short-term rental and maintain the necessary service
levels. The business’s dependence on the unique infrastructure at the family
residence is supported by the business data, which shows a complete
collapse in revenue following Plaintiff’s removal from the premises.
3. Direct and Proximate Causation
The timeline and data together establish that Plaintiff’s business losses were
not the result of market forces, client attrition, or Plaintiff’s own
mismanagement. Instead, they were the direct and foreseeable result of the
Defendants’ coordinated actions to deprive Plaintiff of his home and
business infrastructure. The fraudulent filings, misrepresentations, and
judicial orders were all designed to, and did, achieve the removal of Plaintiff
from the only location where his business could function.
Tenth Circuit authority is clear that RICO liability attaches where the
plaintiff is the direct target of the racketeering scheme and suffers concrete
financial loss as a result (CGC Holding Co. v. Broad & Cassel, 773 F.3d 1076
(10th Cir. 2014); Robbins v. Wilkie, 300 F.3d 1208 (10th Cir. 2002)). Here,
Plaintiff’s business was the direct target: the loss of the premises and
infrastructure was not incidental, but the intended and foreseeable result of
the Defendants’ scheme.
The “by reason of” and proximate cause requirements are satisfied because
the injury—loss of business income, client relationships, and the ability to
scale—flows directly from the predicate acts of wire fraud, extortion, and
fraudulent court filings. There are no independent intervening causes; the
business was destroyed because Plaintiff was physically and legally excluded
from the only place it could operate.
4. Quantification of Losses
The business data allows for a concrete calculation of damages. In 2022,
Plaintiff’s business generated approximately $8,000–$14,000 per month in
gross receipts, with net earnings after fees consistently above $6,500–
$12,500 per month. After the infrastructure upgrades and technical

=== PAGE 21 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
retrenchment in 2023, Plaintiff was positioned to relaunch at similar or
greater scale in 2024.
Instead, following the events of December 2023 and Plaintiff’s removal from
the premises, business income collapsed. From January 2024 onward,
monthly earnings fell below $3,000, and by mid-2025, they had dropped to
under $1,000 per month, with some months showing no meaningful income
at all. This represents a loss of at least $7,000–$12,000 per month, or
approximately $84,000–$144,000 per year, for the nearly two-year period
Plaintiff has been unable to operate.
Future losses are also compensable under RICO where the injury is ongoing
and directly caused by the racketeering activity (Civil Rico: A Tool of
Advocacy (2024)). Given the continued exclusion from the premises and the
ongoing legal interference, Plaintiff’s inability to relaunch or scale the
business is a continuing harm directly attributable to Defendants’ conduct.
5. Legal Sufficiency of the Causal Link
Tenth Circuit precedent confirms that a plaintiff need not show the
racketeering activity was the sole cause of the injury, only that it was a
direct and proximate cause (CGC Holding Co. v. Broad & Cassel, 773 F.3d
1076 (10th Cir. 2014)). The business data and timeline here leave no room
for doubt: the loss of the business was not speculative or remote, but the
direct and intended result of the Defendants’ scheme.
The requirement of a concrete financial loss is also satisfied. Plaintiff’s
business was not merely diminished in value; it was rendered inoperable,
with a total loss of income, client relationships, and the ability to scale. This
is precisely the type of injury RICO is designed to redress (Clinton v. Sec.
Benefit Life Ins. Co., 63 F.4th 1264 (10th Cir. 2023); Plains Resources, Inc. v.
Gable, 782 F.2d 883 (10th Cir. 1986)).
6. No Requirement to Show Organized Crime or Market
Forces
It is not necessary for Plaintiff to show that the racketeering activity was
connected to organized crime, or that the business would have succeeded
but for the Defendants’ conduct. The only requirement is that the injury to
business or property was caused by the pattern of racketeering activity
(Plains Resources, Inc. v. Gable, 782 F.2d 883 (10th Cir. 1986)). The business
data and timeline here meet that standard.
Exceptions and Caveats
While the evidence strongly supports a finding of direct and proximate
causation, Defendants may argue that Plaintiff’s business was already in
decline, or that other factors contributed to the loss. However, the data
shows that the business was poised for a relaunch, and the timing and
nature of the losses correspond exactly with Plaintiff’s removal from the
premises. The Tenth Circuit has held that proximate cause is satisfied where

=== PAGE 22 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
the injury is a foreseeable and direct result of the predicate acts, even if
other factors are present (CGC Holding Co. v. Broad & Cassel, 773 F.3d
1076 (10th Cir. 2014)).
Additionally, RICO does not require proof of a “racketeering injury” beyond
the loss to business or property; it is sufficient to show that the predicate
acts caused the financial harm (Plains Resources, Inc. v. Gable, 782 F.2d 883
(10th Cir. 1986)).
Conclusion
The business data and RICO timeline together establish that Plaintiff’s
market-data business was destroyed not by market forces or his own
conduct, but by the coordinated racketeering activity of Myers and her
associates, who deprived him of the specialized infrastructure and premises
essential to its operation. The injury to business and property is direct,
concrete, and proximately caused by the Defendants’ predicate acts,
satisfying all requirements for recovery under Tenth Circuit RICO law.
Plaintiff is entitled to recover for both past and future losses resulting from
the ongoing deprivation of his business and property.
Legal Authorities
Deck v. Engineered Laminates, 349 F.3d 1253 (10th Cir. 2003)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
RICO allows private parties to bring civil suits for treble damages. 18 U.S.C.
§ 1964(c). To state a RICO claim, a plaintiff must allege that the defendant
violated the substantive RICO statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1962, by setting forth 'four
elements: `(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of
racketeering activity.' Robbins v. Wilkie, 300 F.3d 1208, 1210 (10th Cir.2002)
(quoting Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479, 496, 105 S.Ct. 3275, 87
L.Ed.2d 346 (1985)). A pattern of racketeering activity must include
commission of at least two predicate acts.
Summary
Essential elements required to establish a RICO claim, which includes
demonstrating conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering
activity. This directly supports the proposition that the Plaintiff's business
losses were caused by the Defendants' coordinated actions, as it provides
the legal framework for establishing a RICO violation. The passage also
emphasizes the need for at least two predicate acts, which aligns with the
detailed timeline of events provided in the proposition.

U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
Plaintiffs who bring civil RICO claims pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 1962 must
show damage to their business or property as a result of defendants'
conduct. See Sedima, 473 U.S. at 496 (RICO plaintiff only has standing if 'he
has been injured in his business or property by the conduct constituting the
violation'). Because Appellant failed to allege any tangible harm to his
business or property, the district court held his RICO claim 'nonviable.'
Aplt.App. at 116. We cannot agree with the district court that Appellant
'absolutely failed to carry his burden of pleading any harm to business or
property as a result of the alleged RICO violation.' Id. There are several
references to business or property damage which allegedly resulted from
Defendants' activities. Examples include allegations that various Defendants
took actions that adversely affected his business, caused resource damage,
interfered with guest ranch operations, caused grievous economic injury,
economic loss, and property damage.
Summary
The passage emphasizes that for a RICO claim, a plaintiff must show
damage to their business or property as a result of the defendants' conduct.
The court in Robbins v. Wilkie found that the appellant had sufficiently
alleged harm to business or property, which is necessary to establish
standing in a RICO claim. This supports the proposition that Plaintiff’s
business losses were directly caused by the defendants' actions, as the
passage highlights the importance of linking the harm to the defendants'
conduct.
Plains Resources, Inc. v. Gable, 782 F.2d 883 (10th Cir. 1986)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
We disagree with the view that, to state such a RICO claim, a plaintiff must
allege and prove that the conduct described as 'racketeering activity' is
connected to criminal conduct of an organized nature. We are persuaded by
the opinions which have held that there is no such requirement in a civil
setting... If the defendant engages in a pattern of racketeering activity in a
manner forbidden by [Secs. 1962(a)-(c) ], and the racketeering activities
injure the plaintiff in his business or property, the plaintiff has a claim under
Sec. 1964(c). There is no room in the statutory language for an additional,
amorphous 'racketeering injury' requirement.

Summary
For a civil RICO claim, it is not necessary to prove a connection to organized
crime. Instead, it is sufficient to show that the defendant engaged in a
pattern of racketeering activity that injured the plaintiff's business or
property. This aligns with the proposition that the plaintiff's business losses
were directly caused by the defendants' racketeering activities, without
needing to prove any connection to organized crime.
CGC Holding Co. v. Broad & Cassel, 773 F.3d 1076 (10th Cir. 2014)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
To prove a RICO violation, a plaintiff must show that the defendant violated
the RICO statute, and the plaintiff was injured “by reason of” that violation.
18 U.S.C. §§ 1962, 1964(c). A defendant violates the act when he (1)
participates in the conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern of (4)
racketeering activity. ... Under RICO's “by reason of” requirement, “to state
a claim ... the plaintiff is required to show that a RICO predicate offense ‘not
only was a ‘but for’ cause of his injury, but was the proximate cause as
well.’” ... By alleging that the putative class members were the “direct
targets” of defendants' fraudulent scheme (based on the alleged RICO
predicate acts), plaintiffs have adequately established the requisite causal
connection between defendants' act and each class member's financial loss.
Summary
Requirements for establishing a RICO violation, emphasizing the need for a
causal connection between the defendant's racketeering activity and the
plaintiff's injury. It highlights that the injury must be both a "but for" and
proximate cause of the predicate acts. The passage also illustrates that
plaintiffs can establish standing by showing they were the direct targets of a
fraudulent scheme, which aligns with the proposition that Plaintiff's
business losses were directly caused by the defendants' actions.

U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
Plaintiffs claim Security Benefit committed both mail and wire fraud, which
are predicate racketeering activities under RICO. 'RICO is to be read
broadly. This is the lesson not only of Congress' self-consciously expansive
language and overall approach, but also of its express admonition that RICO
is to 'be liberally construed to effectuate its remedial purposes.' The

=== PAGE 25 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
statute's 'remedial purposes' are nowhere more evident than in the provision
of a private action for those injured by racketeering activity.'
Summary
The passage highlights that RICO is intended to be interpreted broadly to
provide remedies for those injured by racketeering activities, including wire
fraud. This supports the proposition that Plaintiff’s business losses, caused
by the deprivation of infrastructure due to alleged racketeering activities,
fall within the scope of RICO’s remedial purposes. The broad interpretation
of RICO allows for the inclusion of various predicate acts, such as wire
fraud, which are relevant to the Plaintiff's claims of business interference.
Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy
The Brief - American Bar Association - 2024-01-01
Extract
A showing of injury for a civil RICO claim requires proof of a concrete
financial loss and not mere injury to a valuable intangible property interest.
In addition, the “by reason of ” language of § 1964(c) imposes a proximate
cause requirement on the plaintiff. The § 1962 violations must proximately
cause the plaintiff ’s injury to business or property. ... Only damages to
“business or property” occurring “by reason of ” and proximately caused by
the RICO violations are compensable under § 1964(c). Further, under
Sedima, the plaintiff ’s compensable injury is the harm caused by the
predicate acts.
Summary
Requirements for a civil RICO claim, emphasizing the need for a concrete
financial loss and proximate cause. It supports the proposition by
highlighting that the injury to business or property must be directly caused
by the RICO violations, aligning with the argument that Plaintiff's business
losses were directly caused by the Defendants' actions.
