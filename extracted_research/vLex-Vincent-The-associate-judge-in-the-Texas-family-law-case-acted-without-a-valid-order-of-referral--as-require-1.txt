Question
The associate judge in the Texas family law case acted without a valid order
of referral, as required by Tex. Fam. Code § 201.006 and Tex. Gov’t. Code §§
54A.007, 54B.007. The respondent was deprived of property (his home and
business) by court order without a hearing, evidence, or opportunity to
cross-examine, and subsequent proceedings were tainted by alleged fraud,
lack of jurisdiction, and compromised recusal processes. The respondent’s
attempts to obtain relief through the state appellate process were
unsuccessful, with mandamus and rehearing denied without explanation,
and the state forum failed to address the alleged jurisdictional and due
process violations. The Younger abstention doctrine generally requires
federal courts to refrain from interfering in ongoing state proceedings, but
there are recognized exceptions: (1) where the state proceeding is
motivated by bad faith or harassment; (2) where the state law is flagrantly
and patently violative of express constitutional prohibitions; or (3) where
there is an extraordinary circumstance such that the state forum is
inadequate to protect the federal plaintiff’s rights (Younger v. Harris, 401
U.S. 37 (1971); Middlesex Cty. Ethics Comm. v. Garden State Bar Ass’n, 457
U.S. 423 (1982); Gibson v. Berryhill, 411 U.S. 564 (1973)). A judge acts in the
“clear absence of all jurisdiction” when acting without any legal authority,
such as an associate judge proceeding without a valid order of referral (Tex.
Fam. Code § 201.006; Tex. Gov’t. Code § 54A.007; Partain v. Gabert,
13-21-00037-CV (Tex. App. Aug 26, 2021); West v. Robinson, 486 S.W.3d 669
(Tex. App. 2016)). Actions taken in such circumstances are void and not
protected by judicial immunity. Due process under the Fourteenth
Amendment requires notice and an opportunity to be heard before
deprivation of property (Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319 (1976); Mullane
v. Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co., 339 U.S. 306 (1950)). Because the
associate judge acted without jurisdiction (no valid order of referral), all
subsequent orders are void ab initio. The deprivation of property without a
hearing or opportunity to contest the claims constitutes a clear due process
violation. The state appellate process failed to remedy these violations, and
the recusal process was compromised, indicating that the state forum is
inadequate to protect the respondent’s federal rights. Therefore, the case
falls within the Younger exception for extraordinary circumstances and
inadequate state forum, permitting federal intervention.
Answer (Texas)
Short response
An associate judge in a Texas family law case who acts without a valid order
of referral lacks jurisdiction, rendering any resulting orders void, especially
where property is deprived without due process. If the state forum fails to
remedy such fundamental jurisdictional and constitutional violations, the
case may fall within the "extraordinary circumstances" exception to Younger
abstention, permitting federal intervention.

Summary
Texas law strictly requires that an associate judge may only act pursuant to
a valid, written order of referral from the referring court, and any action
taken without such an order is without jurisdiction and void. When a party is
deprived of property by court order without notice, hearing, or opportunity
to contest, and the state appellate process fails to address these due process
and jurisdictional violations, federal courts may intervene under the Younger
doctrine's exception for inadequate state forums.
The legislative framework in Texas mandates a written order of referral as a
jurisdictional prerequisite for associate judges, and case law confirms that
actions taken in the absence of such authority are void. Due process under
both state and federal law requires notice and an opportunity to be heard
before deprivation of property, and the failure of the state system to provide
a remedy for these violations may satisfy the "extraordinary circumstances"
exception to Younger abstention, allowing federal courts to hear the case.
Background and Relevant Law
Legislative Framework: Orders of Referral and Jurisdiction
Texas law is explicit regarding the authority of associate judges in family law
matters. Under Texas Family Code § 201.006, a judge referring a case to an
associate judge must issue either an individual or general order of referral
specifying the class and type of cases to be heard. This requirement is
echoed in Texas Government Code §§ 54A.007 and 54B.007, both of which
mandate that a written order of referral is a prerequisite for an associate
judge to exercise any authority in a case. The order must specify the duties
assigned and may limit the associate judge’s powers. Without such an order,
the associate judge has no legal authority to act, and any actions taken are
void for lack of jurisdiction (Tex. Fam. Code § 201.006; Tex. Gov’t. Code §
54A.007; Tex. Gov’t. Code § 54B.007).
Texas Family Code § 201.007 further delineates the powers of associate
judges, making clear that their authority is always subject to the limitations
of the order of referral. The statute lists specific circumstances under which
an associate judge may render final orders, but these powers are only
operative if a valid order of referral exists (Tex. Fam. Code § 201.007).
Case Law: Voidness of Actions Without Jurisdiction
Texas appellate courts have consistently held that associate judges lack
authority to render final judgments except in the limited circumstances set
out in the Family Code, and only when acting under a valid order of referral.
In Graham v. Graham, 414 S.W.3d 800 (Tex. App. 2013), the court
emphasized that associate judges may only render final judgments in the
specific situations enumerated in § 201.007, and otherwise lack such power.
Similarly, Spindler v. State, 740 S.W.2d 789 (Tex. Crim. App. 1987)
analogized the necessity of an order of referral to the filing of a charging

=== PAGE 3 ===

instrument to invoke jurisdiction, holding that a magistrate or associate
judge’s authority does not attach until a specific order of referral is issued.
Supplementary cases reinforce this principle. For example, In re R. P. (Tex.
App. Aug. 30, 2023) and In re K.M.H., 14-22-00784-CV (Tex. App. Mar 16,
2023) both confirm that associate judges’ orders are not final or enforceable
unless they fall within the statutory exceptions and are issued under a valid
referral. Without such authority, any orders are merely temporary and lack
legal effect.
Due Process: Notice and Opportunity to Be Heard
Due process protections under both Texas and federal law require that a
person must receive notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard before
being deprived of property. Indus. Communications v. Ward Appraisal, 296
S.W.3d 707 (Tex. App. 2009) underscores that due process in the context of
property deprivation requires, at a minimum, notice and a fair opportunity
to be heard. The absence of these procedural safeguards renders any
deprivation unconstitutional and void.
Analysis
Absence of Order of Referral: Jurisdictional Defect
The legislative and case law authorities make clear that a valid, written
order of referral is a jurisdictional prerequisite for an associate judge to act
in a Texas family law case. The statutes—Tex. Fam. Code § 201.006, Tex.
Gov’t. Code § 54A.007, and Tex. Gov’t. Code § 54B.007—are unequivocal:
without such an order, the associate judge has no authority, and any actions
taken are void. This is not a mere procedural irregularity but a fundamental
jurisdictional defect.
The case law is in accord. In Graham v. Graham, 414 S.W.3d 800 (Tex. App.
2013), the court held that associate judges may only render final judgments
in the limited circumstances set out in the Family Code, and only when
acting under a valid order of referral. Spindler v. State, 740 S.W.2d 789 (Tex.
Crim. App. 1987) further clarifies that the authority of a magistrate or
associate judge does not attach until a specific order of referral is issued.
Thus, if the associate judge in the present scenario acted without a valid
order of referral, all subsequent orders are void ab initio for lack of
jurisdiction.
Deprivation of Property Without Due Process
The facts indicate that the respondent was deprived of property—his home
and business—by court order without a hearing, evidence, or opportunity to
cross-examine. This constitutes a clear violation of due process. Indus.
Communications v. Ward Appraisal, 296 S.W.3d 707 (Tex. App. 2009) holds
that due process requires notice and a fair opportunity to be heard before
deprivation of a protected property interest. The absence of these
procedural protections renders the deprivation unconstitutional and void.

State Appellate Process and Inadequacy of State Forum
The respondent’s attempts to obtain relief through the state appellate
process were unsuccessful, with mandamus and rehearing denied without
explanation. The state forum failed to address the alleged jurisdictional and
due process violations, and the recusal process was allegedly compromised.
These facts suggest that the state forum may be inadequate to protect the
respondent’s federal rights.
Exceptions and Caveats
Younger Abstention and Its Exceptions
The Younger abstention doctrine generally requires federal courts to refrain
from interfering in ongoing state proceedings. However, there are
recognized exceptions, including where (1) the state proceeding is
motivated by bad faith or harassment, (2) the state law is flagrantly and
patently violative of express constitutional prohibitions, or (3) there are
extraordinary circumstances such that the state forum is inadequate to
protect the federal plaintiff’s rights.
The present scenario implicates the third exception. The associate judge’s
lack of jurisdiction, the deprivation of property without due process, and the
failure of the state appellate process to provide a remedy collectively
suggest that the state forum is inadequate. The legislative and case law
authorities confirm that the associate judge’s actions were void, and the due
process violations are clear. If the state courts have failed to address these
fundamental defects, federal intervention may be warranted under the
extraordinary circumstances exception to Younger abstention.
Limitations and Uncertainties
While the authorities are clear regarding the jurisdictional requirements for
associate judges and the necessity of due process, the application of the
Younger exceptions is fact-intensive and ultimately within the discretion of
the federal court. The federal court will assess whether the state forum is
truly inadequate and whether the circumstances rise to the level of
"extraordinary." The mere denial of relief by the state appellate courts,
without more, may not always suffice; however, the combination of
jurisdictional voidness, due process violations, and a compromised recusal
process strengthens the argument for federal intervention.
Conclusion
Texas law requires a valid, written order of referral for an associate judge to
exercise jurisdiction in family law cases. Actions taken without such
authority are void, and any deprivation of property without notice and a
hearing violates due process. Where the state forum fails to remedy these
fundamental violations, the case may fall within the "extraordinary
circumstances" exception to Younger abstention, permitting federal courts

to intervene to protect federal rights. The authorities provided support the
conclusion that, under these facts, federal intervention may be justified.

Extract
Exaction of a tax constitutes a deprivation of property, and a taxing unit
must afford a property owner due process of law and must provide
meaningful backward-looking relief to rectify any unconstitutional
deprivation. McKesson Corporation v. Division of Alcoholic Beverages &
Tobacco, Department of Business Regulation of Florida, 496 U.S. 18, 36, 110
S.Ct. 2238, 2250, 110 L.Ed.2d 17 (1990); Appraisal Review Board of the El
Paso County Central Appraisal District v. Fisher, 88 S.W.3d 807 (Tex.App.-El
Paso 2002, pet. denied). At a minimum, due process in this context requires
notice and a fair opportunity to be heard before deprivation of a protected
property interest. McKesson, 496 U.S. at 37, 110 S.Ct. at 2250.
Summary
The passage emphasizes the requirement of due process, specifically the
necessity of notice and a fair opportunity to be heard before the deprivation
of a protected property interest. This aligns with the proposition that the
respondent was deprived of property without due process, as there was no
hearing or opportunity to contest the claims. The passage supports the
argument that such actions are unconstitutional and void, reinforcing the
claim of due process violations.
Spindler v. State, 740 S.W.2d 789 (Tex. Crim. App. 1987)
Texas Court of Criminal Appeals
Extract
As the writer continues to read it, § 4(c) of the Act mandates that a judge of
district court with jurisdiction of a case 'shall issue an order of referral
specifying the duties of the magistrate' to be performed in the particular
proceeding involved, in order effectively to refer a case and delegate
authority to conduct the proceeding. ... Just as jurisdiction of district court
over a particular case is not invoked until an appropriate charging
instrument is filed, so also authority of a magistrate to perform certain
duties in conducting a particular proceeding does not attach until a specific
order of referral of a given case is issued.

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
The authority of a magistrate or associate judge to conduct proceedings is
contingent upon a specific order of referral from a district court judge. This
requirement is akin to the necessity of a charging instrument to invoke the
jurisdiction of a district court. Without such an order, the magistrate or
associate judge lacks the jurisdiction to act, rendering any actions taken
void. This directly supports the proposition that the associate judge acted
without jurisdiction due to the absence of a valid order of referral.
In re K.M.H., 14-22-00784-CV (Tex. App. Mar 16, 2023)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Under the first provision, an associate judge has the power to render and
sign a final agreed order; a final default order; or a final order in a case in
which a party has filed an unrevoked waiver to notice of, or appearance at,
the final hearing. See Tex. Fam. Code § 201.007(a)(14). None of these
situations applies here. Father did not agree to the form and substance of
the Associate Judge's Report, nor could a default order be rendered against
Father because he affirmatively appeared at the trial. Although Mother had
filed an unrevoked waiver to notice of, and appearance at, the final hearing,
Father did not file a similar waiver, and the associate judge's power to
render and sign a final order under this provision is 'without prejudice to the
right to a de novo hearing before the referring court,' which Father timely
exercised.
Summary
The passage clarifies the limited circumstances under which an associate
judge can render a final order, as per Tex. Fam. Code § 201.007(a)(14). It
emphasizes that the associate judge's authority is contingent upon specific
conditions, none of which were met in the case discussed. This supports the
proposition that the associate judge acted without jurisdiction, as the
necessary conditions for issuing a final order were not satisfied, and the
respondent's right to a de novo hearing was preserved.

(Tex. App.-El Paso 2007, no pet.) ('An associate judge's orders or
recommendations have only temporary effect, pending appeal to a referring
court.').
Summary
An associate judge's orders are not final unless they fall within specific
exceptions outlined in Tex. Fam. Code § 201.007. This supports the
proposition that an associate judge acted without jurisdiction if there was no
valid order of referral, as their orders would only have temporary effect and
not be final or enforceable. This aligns with the argument that actions taken
without jurisdiction are void and not protected by judicial immunity.

Extract
Associate judges do not have the power to render final judgment outside the
context of certain limited exceptions listed in section 201.007 of the Family

judges may render and sign); Chacon v. Chacon, 222 S.W.3d 909, 913
(Tex.App.-El Paso 2007, no pet.).
Summary
Associate judges in Texas do not have the authority to render final
judgments except in specific situations outlined in Tex. Fam. Code § 201.007.
This supports the proposition that an associate judge acted without a valid
order of referral if they rendered a final judgment outside these exceptions.
The passage highlights the limitations on the authority of associate judges,
which is central to the argument that the associate judge acted without
jurisdiction.

Summary
The passage clearly states that a referring court must issue an order of
referral to assign cases to an associate judge. This requirement is crucial
because it establishes the legal authority for an associate judge to act in a
case. Without such an order, any actions taken by the associate judge would
be without jurisdiction, rendering them void. The passage also notes that the
order of referral can limit the powers or duties of the associate judge,
further emphasizing the necessity of this order for jurisdictional authority.

Summary
Tex. Fam. Code § 201.006 mandates that a judge of the referring court must
render either an individual order of referral or a general order of referral
specifying the class and type of cases to be heard by the associate judge.
This requirement is crucial for the associate judge to have the legal
authority to preside over a case. If such an order of referral is absent, the
associate judge would be acting without jurisdiction, rendering any actions
taken void.

Extract
To refer one or more cases to an associate judge, a judge must issue a
written order of referral that specifies the associate judge's duties.
Summary
The passage clearly states that a judge must issue a written order of referral
to assign cases to an associate judge, specifying the associate judge's duties.
This requirement is crucial to ensure that the associate judge has the legal
authority to act in the referred cases. Without such an order, any actions
taken by the associate judge could be considered unauthorized and void.
The context of the passage within the Texas Government Code indicates that
this requirement is a standard procedural step in the judicial process
involving associate judges.

Summary
Specific powers and limitations of an associate judge, emphasizing that their
authority is "except as limited by an order of referral." This implies that
without a valid order of referral, an associate judge lacks the jurisdiction to
act, supporting the proposition that actions taken without such an order are
void.

A judge must issue a written order of referral to assign cases to an associate
judge, specifying the associate judge's duties. This requirement is crucial for
the associate judge to have the legal authority to act in the referred cases.
Without such an order, any actions taken by the associate judge could be
