1 NO. 25-0367 IN THE SUPREME COURT OF TEXAS IN RE: CHARLES
DUSTIN MYERS § § § § §MOTION FOR REHEARING § § § § § TO THE
HONORABLE SUPREME COURT OF TEXAS: Relator CHARLES DUSTIN
MYERS respectfully submits this motion for rehearing in regarding cause
number 25-0367 before this Honorable Court. There exist five judges
involved in the same family law matter before this Court, none of which have
provided a response, and the case remains inactive in the trial court below.
Because there has been no response, Relator will file a motion similar to this
in case numbers 25-0361, 25-0378, 25-0426, and 25-0458 to incorporate
potential counter arguments and why they fail. This Court should grant

SUPREME COURT OF TEXAS BLAKE A. HAWTHORNE, CLERK 2 cause
number 25-0367, and in support of this request, Relator Charles Dustin
Myers shows the following: I. INTRODUCTION 1. The Texas Supreme Court
must grant rehearing because the trial court's complete refusal to hear a
properly filed emergency TRO constitutes an abuse of discretion that left the
relator without adequate appellate remedy, and resulted in preventable
harm to the child that exemplifies the type of exceptional circumstance
warranting extraordinary relief. II. Summary 2. Relator’s mandamus petition
presents a compelling case for rehearing based on established legal
principles governing mandamus relief in Texas. The trial court's outright
refusal to hear his properly filed emergency TRO regarding his children's
welfare constitutes a clear failure to perform a ministerial duty—the
obligation to consider and rule on properly filed motions. This judicial
inaction violates fundamental due process protections and parental rights,
which are elevated constitutional interests deserving heightened protection.
3. Beyond the procedural aspects, this case highlights a substantive concern
that warrants the Supreme Court's attention: the preventable harm to a
child that materialized precisely as the relator warned. The dental
emergency suffered by the youngest child serves as concrete evidence of the
inadequacy of any remedy by 3 appeal, as appellate review cannot undo
harm that has already occurred to a vulnerable child. The case raises
systemic concerns about judicial accountability and public confidence in the
courts when trial courts refuse to perform basic ministerial duties and
appellate courts deny relief without explanation, particularly in matters
involving fundamental rights and child welfare. III. Background and
Relevant Law 4. The legal framework for mandamus relief in Texas is well-
established and provides the foundation for understanding why the Supreme
Court should grant rehearing in this case. A. Standard for Mandamus Relief
5. Mandamus is an extraordinary remedy available only in limited
circumstances. For a relator to be entitled to mandamus relief, two
requirements must be satisfied: (1) the trial court clearly abused its
discretion and (2) the relator has no adequate remedy on appeal. 6. The
Texas Supreme Court has explained that mandamus is reserved for
situations where a trial court clearly abuses its discretion and no adequate
remedy by appeal exists. In re Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., 148 S.W.3d 124,
135-36 (Tex. 2004) ("An appellate remedy is 'adequate' when any benefits to
mandamus review are outweighed by the detriments. When the benefits

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
outweigh the detriments, 4 appellate courts must consider whether the
appellate remedy is adequate."). This standard reflects the exceptional
nature of mandamus relief. 7. When it comes to a trial court's duty to rule on
motions, Texas courts have consistently held that "when a motion is properly
filed and pending before a trial court, the act of considering and ruling upon
that motion is a ministerial duty." In re Layton, 257 S.W.3d 794, 795 (Tex.
App.—Amarillo 2008, orig. proceeding). Thus, mandamus is the appropriate
mechanism to compel a trial court to fulfill this fundamental duty. B.
Parental Rights as Fundamental Rights 8. The U.S. Supreme Court has
recognized that among the most fundamental liberty interests protected by
the Constitution is the right of parents to direct the upbringing and care of
their children. Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 65 (2000) (recognizing that
"the interest of parents in the care, custody, and control of their children is
perhaps the oldest of the fundamental liberty interests recognized by this
Court"). This fundamental right is directly implicated in the present case. 9.
Texas law mirrors this constitutional protection, recognizing in Tex. Fam.
Code § 153.001 that it is "the public policy of this state to: assure that
children will have frequent and continuing contact with parents who have
shown the ability to act in the best interest of the child; provide a safe,
stable, and nonviolent environment for the child; and encourage parents to
share in the rights and duties 5 of raising their child after the parents have
separated or dissolved their marriage." Furthermore, Tex. Fam. Code §
153.002 mandates that "the best interest of the child shall always be the
primary consideration of the court in determining the issues of
conservatorship and possession of and access to the child." C. Due Process
Requirements 10. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment
forbids any state from depriving a person of life, liberty, or property without
due process of law. Reno v. Flores, 507 U.S. 292, 301-02 (1993) ("The Fifth
Amendment's guarantee of 'due process of law' includes a substantive
component, which forbids the government to infringe certain 'fundamental'
liberty interests... no matter what process is provided, unless the
infringement is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest."). This
constitutional guarantee is particularly relevant in family law matters, where
fundamental liberty interests in parental rights are at stake. IV. Analysis D.
Trial Court's Refusal to Hear Emergency Motion Constitutes Abuse of
Discretion 11. The Texas Supreme Court should grant rehearing because the
trial court's refusal to hear Relator's emergency TRO on March 28, 2025,
constitutes a clear abuse of discretion. By turning Relator away from the
courtroom and refusing even 6 to schedule a hearing on his properly filed
motion alleging imminent risk to his child, the court failed to perform a
ministerial duty. 12. In Barnes v. State, 832 S.W.2d 424, 426 (Tex. App.—
Houston [1st Dist.] 1992), the court confirmed that trial courts have a
ministerial duty to consider and rule on properly filed motions. The court in
In re Layton, 257 S.W.3d 794, 795 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 2008, orig.
proceeding) further clarified that "when a motion is properly filed and
pending before a trial court, the act of considering and ruling upon that
motion is a ministerial duty." The trial court's outright refusal to even
consider Relator's emergency TRO represents a clear departure from this
established duty. 13. This is not a case where the trial court merely delayed
ruling or exercised discretion in scheduling. Rather, the record shows that
the Respondent Judge completely refused to hear the motion, effectively
closing the courthouse doors to Relator on a matter involving child safety.

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Such a refusal is precisely the type of clear abuse of discretion that warrants
mandamus relief. E. No Adequate Remedy by Appeal 14. The second
requirement for mandamus relief—the absence of an adequate remedy by
appeal—is clearly satisfied in this case. Texas courts have consistently
recognized that temporary orders in family law cases are not appealable,
making mandamus the appropriate vehicle for review. In re S.B. 7 ("Because
a trial court's temporary orders are not appealable, mandamus is an
appropriate means to challenge them."). 15. Moreover, the inadequacy of
appeal is particularly evident here because the harm to the child that
Relator sought to prevent through his emergency TRO has already
materialized—the youngest child suffered a preventable dental emergency
that required intervention. An appeal after final judgment cannot undo this
harm or rectify the denial of process that Relator experienced when facing
an immediate threat to his child's well-being. 16. The Texas Supreme Court
has recognized that mandamus may be appropriate when judicial inaction
leads to irreparable harm, particularly to a child. In re Prudential Ins. Co. of
Am., 148 S.W.3d 124, 136 (Tex. 2004). In such cases, the remedy by appeal
is inherently inadequate because it cannot prevent or undo harm that has
already occurred. F. Protection of Fundamental Parental Rights 17. The
Texas Supreme Court should grant rehearing because this case involves
fundamental parental rights that deserve heightened protection. The U.S.
Supreme Court in Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 65 (2000) recognized that
parents have a fundamental right to direct the upbringing and care of their
children. When a court action—or inaction—threatens this fundamental
right, close scrutiny is warranted. 8 18. In In re C.J.C., 603 S.W.3d 804 (Tex.
2020), this Court emphasized the importance of protecting parental rights,
recognizing a statutory presumption in favor of parents in custody
determinations. The court stated that "when nonparents seek court-ordered
custody of a child subject to an existing order, under which one or both fit
parents were appointed managing conservators, that parent or parents
retain the presumption that protects their fundamental right to determine
their child's best interest." 19. Similarly, in In re B.F., No. 02-20-00283-CV
(Tex. App. Oct 15, 2020), the court granted mandamus relief when a trial
court's temporary order infringed on a father's parental rights. The court
cited the Texas Supreme Court's decision in In re C.J.C. and noted that "the
United States Constitution 'protects the fundamental right of parents to
make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children.'"
G. Judicial Accountability and Public Confidence 20. Beyond the specific
issues in this case, the Texas Supreme Court should grant rehearing to
address broader concerns about judicial accountability and public
confidence in the courts. The petition references a 2020 analysis by the
Texas Home School Coalition that found courts "failed to protect parents'
constitutional rights more than 78% of the time" in certain contested suits 9
involving parental-presumption challenges. Such patterns of perceived
overreach can erode public trust in the judiciary. 21. The case of Stary v.
Ethridge, 695 S.W.3d 417 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2022), which this
Court agreed to review, highlights similar due process concerns in family
law proceedings. Like Stary, the present case raises questions about
procedural safeguards in matters affecting parental rights and child welfare.
22. The perfunctory denial of mandamus relief by the Second Court of
Appeals, without explanation, further compounds concerns about judicial
accountability. When courts at multiple levels fail to address a clear

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
dereliction of ministerial duty, it creates an accountability vacuum that
undermines public confidence in the judiciary. The Texas Supreme Court, as
the state's highest civil court, has a responsibility to ensure that lower
courts fulfill their basic duties, especially in cases involving fundamental
rights and child welfare. H. The Open Courts Provision 23. The trial court's
refusal to hear Relator's emergency motion potentially violates the Texas
Constitution's Open Courts Provision, which guarantees access to the courts
for redress of injuries. Tex. Const. art. I, § 13. This provision requires that
the courts be open to all persons for the redress of their grievances. When a
trial court refuses even to hear a properly filed emergency motion
concerning child 10 safety, it effectively denies access to justice in violation
of this constitutional guarantee. 24. In Whitworth v. Whitworth, 222 S.W.3d
616 (Tex. App. 2007), the court emphasized that a judge who issues an order
transferring possession and temporary custody of a child without making the
necessary factual findings acts without authority, rendering the orders
invalid. Similarly, a judge who refuses even to consider a properly filed
emergency motion regarding child welfare abdicates a fundamental judicial
responsibility. I. Best Interest of the Child 25. The Texas Family Code
mandates that "the best interest of the child shall always be the primary
consideration of the court in determining the issues of conservatorship and
possession of and access to the child." Tex. Fam. Code § 153.002. By
refusing to hear Relator's emergency TRO, the trial court failed to consider
how its inaction might affect the best interest of the child. 26. The
preventable dental emergency suffered by the youngest child demonstrates
that the trial court's refusal to act was contrary to the child's best interest.
This Court should grant rehearing to ensure that trial courts fulfill their
statutory duty to prioritize the best interest of the child in all decisions
affecting child welfare. 11 J. Differential Treatment and Denial of Equal
Protection 27. The petition suggests that the trial court's refusal to hear
Relator's emergency TRO stands in stark contrast to its apparent swiftness
in acting upon the Real Party in Interest's initial application, which Relator
contends was based on false pretenses. This differential treatment raises
concerns about equal protection under the law. 28. The court's acceptance
of the initial emergency filing, which resulted in Relator being removed from
his home and having access to his children restricted, compared with its
refusal to even entertain Relator's subsequent emergency motion, suggests
arbitrary decision-making that contradicts principles of fairness and due
process. K. Exceptional Circumstances Warranting Extraordinary Relief 29.
The combination of factors in this case—the trial court's clear failure to
perform a ministerial duty, the absence of an adequate remedy by appeal,
the fundamental nature of the parental rights at stake, and the preventable
harm that resulted to a child—creates exceptional circumstances that
warrant the extraordinary remedy of mandamus. 30. This Court has
recognized that mandamus may be appropriate in exceptional cases where
the benefits of mandamus review outweigh the detriments. In re Prudential
Ins. Co. of Am., 148 S.W.3d 124, 135-36 (Tex. 2004). This case 12 presents
such exceptional circumstances given the clear abuse of discretion, the
absence of appellate remedy, and the importance of the rights at stake. 31.
In In re R.G., 06-24-00035-CV (Tex. App. Sep 11, 2024), the court recognized
that "the Supreme Court of the United States and the Supreme Court of
Texas have recognized that involuntary termination of parental rights
involves fundamental constitutional rights. As a result, when the Department

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
seeks to permanently terminate the relationship between a parent and a
child, it must observe fundamentally fair procedures." This principle applies
with equal force here, where the trial court's refusal to hear an emergency
motion involving child welfare failed to observe fundamentally fair
procedures. V. The Role of the Texas Supreme Court 32. As the highest civil
court in Texas, the Supreme Court has a responsibility to ensure that the
judicial system functions properly and that fundamental rights are
protected. When lower courts fail to perform their basic ministerial duties
and appellate courts deny relief without explanation, the Supreme Court
must step in to maintain the integrity of the judicial system. 33. The
Government Code explicitly empowers the Supreme Court to issue writs of
mandamus against district judges. Tex. Gov't. Code § 22.002 provides that
"the supreme court or a justice of the supreme court may issue writs of
procedendo and certiorari and all writs of quo warranto and mandamus
agreeable to the 13 principles of law regulating those writs, against a
statutory county court judge, a statutory probate court judge, a district
judge, a court of appeals or a justice of a court of appeals, or any officer of
state government except the governor, the court of criminal appeals, or a
judge of the court of criminal appeals." 34. This grant of authority reflects
the Supreme Court's role as the ultimate guardian of legal rights in the
state's civil justice system. By granting rehearing in this case, the Court
would fulfill this important role and provide guidance to lower courts on
their obligation to hear and rule on properly filed emergency motions,
particularly those involving child welfare. VI. Conclusion 35. This Court
should grant rehearing because this case presents exceptional
circumstances that warrant extraordinary relief. The trial court's refusal to
hear Relator's properly filed emergency TRO constitutes a clear abuse of
discretion that left Relator without an adequate remedy by appeal and
resulted in preventable harm to a child. 36. The case implicates fundamental
constitutional rights, including parental rights and due process, which
deserve heightened protection. It also raises broader concerns about judicial
accountability and public confidence in the courts when judges refuse to
perform their basic ministerial duties and appellate courts deny relief
without explanation. 14 37. By granting rehearing, the Court would not only
address the specific injustice suffered by Relator and his child but also
reaffirm important principles: that Texas courts must provide a meaningful
forum for litigants, especially in emergencies involving child safety; that
judges must perform their ministerial duties without bias or arbitrary
refusal; and that the judicial system as a whole must be accountable to the
people it serves. 38. The preventable harm that has already occurred to the
child in this case underscores the inadequacy of any remedy other than
mandamus. The Supreme Court should therefore grant rehearing to ensure
that justice is served and that similar harms are prevented in the future. VII.

SUPREME COURT OF TEXAS BLAKE A. HAWTHORNE, CLERK 2 cause
number 25-0367, and in support of this request, Relator Charles Dustin
Myers shows the following: I. INTRODUCTION 1. The Texas Supreme Court
must grant rehearing because the trial court's complete refusal to hear a
properly filed emergency TRO constitutes an abuse of discretion that left the
relator without adequate appellate remedy, and resulted in preventable
harm to the child that exemplifies the type of exceptional circumstance
warranting extraordinary relief. II. Summary 2. Relator’s mandamus petition
presents a compelling case for rehearing based on established legal
principles governing mandamus relief in Texas. The trial court's outright
refusal to hear his properly filed emergency TRO regarding his children's
welfare constitutes a clear failure to perform a ministerial duty—the
obligation to consider and rule on properly filed motions. This judicial
inaction violates fundamental due process protections and parental rights,
which are elevated constitutional interests deserving heightened protection.
3. Beyond the procedural aspects, this case highlights a substantive concern
that warrants the Supreme Court's attention: the preventable harm to a
child that materialized precisely as the relator warned. The dental
emergency suffered by the youngest child serves as concrete evidence of the
inadequacy of any remedy by 3 appeal, as appellate review cannot undo

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
harm that has already occurred to a vulnerable child. The case raises
systemic concerns about judicial accountability and public confidence in the
courts when trial courts refuse to perform basic ministerial duties and
appellate courts deny relief without explanation, particularly in matters
involving fundamental rights and child welfare. III. Background and
Relevant Law 4. The legal framework for mandamus relief in Texas is well-
established and provides the foundation for understanding why the Supreme
Court should grant rehearing in this case. A. Standard for Mandamus Relief
5. Mandamus is an extraordinary remedy available only in limited
circumstances. For a relator to be entitled to mandamus relief, two
requirements must be satisfied: (1) the trial court clearly abused its
discretion and (2) the relator has no adequate remedy on appeal. 6. The
Texas Supreme Court has explained that mandamus is reserved for
situations where a trial court clearly abuses its discretion and no adequate
remedy by appeal exists. In re Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., 148 S.W.3d 124,
135-36 (Tex. 2004) ("An appellate remedy is 'adequate' when any benefits to
mandamus review are outweighed by the detriments. When the benefits
outweigh the detriments, 4 appellate courts must consider whether the
appellate remedy is adequate."). This standard reflects the exceptional
nature of mandamus relief. 7. When it comes to a trial court's duty to rule on
motions, Texas courts have consistently held that "when a motion is properly
filed and pending before a trial court, the act of considering and ruling upon
that motion is a ministerial duty." In re Layton, 257 S.W.3d 794, 795 (Tex.
App.—Amarillo 2008, orig. proceeding). Thus, mandamus is the appropriate
mechanism to compel a trial court to fulfill this fundamental duty. B.
Parental Rights as Fundamental Rights 8. The U.S. Supreme Court has
recognized that among the most fundamental liberty interests protected by
the Constitution is the right of parents to direct the upbringing and care of
their children. Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 65 (2000) (recognizing that
"the interest of parents in the care, custody, and control of their children is
perhaps the oldest of the fundamental liberty interests recognized by this
Court"). This fundamental right is directly implicated in the present case. 9.
Texas law mirrors this constitutional protection, recognizing in Tex. Fam.
Code § 153.001 that it is "the public policy of this state to: assure that
children will have frequent and continuing contact with parents who have
shown the ability to act in the best interest of the child; provide a safe,
stable, and nonviolent environment for the child; and encourage parents to
share in the rights and duties 5 of raising their child after the parents have
separated or dissolved their marriage." Furthermore, Tex. Fam. Code §
153.002 mandates that "the best interest of the child shall always be the
primary consideration of the court in determining the issues of
conservatorship and possession of and access to the child." C. Due Process
Requirements 10. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment
forbids any state from depriving a person of life, liberty, or property without
due process of law. Reno v. Flores, 507 U.S. 292, 301-02 (1993) ("The Fifth
Amendment's guarantee of 'due process of law' includes a substantive
component, which forbids the government to infringe certain 'fundamental'
liberty interests... no matter what process is provided, unless the
infringement is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest."). This
constitutional guarantee is particularly relevant in family law matters, where
fundamental liberty interests in parental rights are at stake. IV. Analysis D.
Trial Court's Refusal to Hear Emergency Motion Constitutes Abuse of

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Discretion 11. The Texas Supreme Court should grant rehearing because the
trial court's refusal to hear Relator's emergency TRO on March 28, 2025,
constitutes a clear abuse of discretion. By turning Relator away from the
courtroom and refusing even 6 to schedule a hearing on his properly filed
motion alleging imminent risk to his child, the court failed to perform a
ministerial duty. 12. In Barnes v. State, 832 S.W.2d 424, 426 (Tex. App.—
Houston [1st Dist.] 1992), the court confirmed that trial courts have a
ministerial duty to consider and rule on properly filed motions. The court in
In re Layton, 257 S.W.3d 794, 795 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 2008, orig.
proceeding) further clarified that "when a motion is properly filed and
pending before a trial court, the act of considering and ruling upon that
motion is a ministerial duty." The trial court's outright refusal to even
consider Relator's emergency TRO represents a clear departure from this
established duty. 13. This is not a case where the trial court merely delayed
ruling or exercised discretion in scheduling. Rather, the record shows that
the Respondent Judge completely refused to hear the motion, effectively
closing the courthouse doors to Relator on a matter involving child safety.
Such a refusal is precisely the type of clear abuse of discretion that warrants
mandamus relief. E. No Adequate Remedy by Appeal 14. The second
requirement for mandamus relief—the absence of an adequate remedy by
appeal—is clearly satisfied in this case. Texas courts have consistently
recognized that temporary orders in family law cases are not appealable,
making mandamus the appropriate vehicle for review. In re S.B. 7 ("Because
a trial court's temporary orders are not appealable, mandamus is an
appropriate means to challenge them."). 15. Moreover, the inadequacy of
appeal is particularly evident here because the harm to the child that
Relator sought to prevent through his emergency TRO has already
materialized—the youngest child suffered a preventable dental emergency
that required intervention. An appeal after final judgment cannot undo this
harm or rectify the denial of process that Relator experienced when facing
an immediate threat to his child's well-being. 16. The Texas Supreme Court
has recognized that mandamus may be appropriate when judicial inaction
leads to irreparable harm, particularly to a child. In re Prudential Ins. Co. of
Am., 148 S.W.3d 124, 136 (Tex. 2004). In such cases, the remedy by appeal
is inherently inadequate because it cannot prevent or undo harm that has
already occurred. F. Protection of Fundamental Parental Rights 17. The
Texas Supreme Court should grant rehearing because this case involves
fundamental parental rights that deserve heightened protection. The U.S.
Supreme Court in Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 65 (2000) recognized that
parents have a fundamental right to direct the upbringing and care of their
children. When a court action—or inaction—threatens this fundamental
right, close scrutiny is warranted. 8 18. In In re C.J.C., 603 S.W.3d 804 (Tex.
2020), this Court emphasized the importance of protecting parental rights,
recognizing a statutory presumption in favor of parents in custody
determinations. The court stated that "when nonparents seek court-ordered
custody of a child subject to an existing order, under which one or both fit
parents were appointed managing conservators, that parent or parents
retain the presumption that protects their fundamental right to determine
their child's best interest." 19. Similarly, in In re B.F., No. 02-20-00283-CV
(Tex. App. Oct 15, 2020), the court granted mandamus relief when a trial
court's temporary order infringed on a father's parental rights. The court
cited the Texas Supreme Court's decision in In re C.J.C. and noted that "the

=== PAGE 9 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
United States Constitution 'protects the fundamental right of parents to
make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children.'"
G. Judicial Accountability and Public Confidence 20. Beyond the specific
issues in this case, the Texas Supreme Court should grant rehearing to
address broader concerns about judicial accountability and public
confidence in the courts. The petition references a 2020 analysis by the
Texas Home School Coalition that found courts "failed to protect parents'
constitutional rights more than 78% of the time" in certain contested suits 9
involving parental-presumption challenges. Such patterns of perceived
overreach can erode public trust in the judiciary. 21. The case of Stary v.
Ethridge, 695 S.W.3d 417 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2022), which this
Court agreed to review, highlights similar due process concerns in family
law proceedings. Like Stary, the present case raises questions about
procedural safeguards in matters affecting parental rights and child welfare.
22. The perfunctory denial of mandamus relief by the Second Court of
Appeals, without explanation, further compounds concerns about judicial
accountability. When courts at multiple levels fail to address a clear
dereliction of ministerial duty, it creates an accountability vacuum that
undermines public confidence in the judiciary. The Texas Supreme Court, as
the state's highest civil court, has a responsibility to ensure that lower
courts fulfill their basic duties, especially in cases involving fundamental
rights and child welfare. H. The Open Courts Provision 23. The trial court's
refusal to hear Relator's emergency motion potentially violates the Texas
Constitution's Open Courts Provision, which guarantees access to the courts
for redress of injuries. Tex. Const. art. I, § 13. This provision requires that
the courts be open to all persons for the redress of their grievances. When a
trial court refuses even to hear a properly filed emergency motion
concerning child 10 safety, it effectively denies access to justice in violation
of this constitutional guarantee. 24. In Whitworth v. Whitworth, 222 S.W.3d
616 (Tex. App. 2007), the court emphasized that a judge who issues an order
transferring possession and temporary custody of a child without making the
necessary factual findings acts without authority, rendering the orders
invalid. Similarly, a judge who refuses even to consider a properly filed
emergency motion regarding child welfare abdicates a fundamental judicial
responsibility. I. Best Interest of the Child 25. The Texas Family Code
mandates that "the best interest of the child shall always be the primary
consideration of the court in determining the issues of conservatorship and
possession of and access to the child." Tex. Fam. Code § 153.002. By
refusing to hear Relator's emergency TRO, the trial court failed to consider
how its inaction might affect the best interest of the child. 26. The
preventable dental emergency suffered by the youngest child demonstrates
that the trial court's refusal to act was contrary to the child's best interest.
This Court should grant rehearing to ensure that trial courts fulfill their
statutory duty to prioritize the best interest of the child in all decisions
affecting child welfare. 11 J. Differential Treatment and Denial of Equal
Protection 27. The petition suggests that the trial court's refusal to hear
Relator's emergency TRO stands in stark contrast to its apparent swiftness
in acting upon the Real Party in Interest's initial application, which Relator
contends was based on false pretenses. This differential treatment raises
concerns about equal protection under the law. 28. The court's acceptance
of the initial emergency filing, which resulted in Relator being removed from
his home and having access to his children restricted, compared with its

=== PAGE 10 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
refusal to even entertain Relator's subsequent emergency motion, suggests
arbitrary decision-making that contradicts principles of fairness and due
process. K. Exceptional Circumstances Warranting Extraordinary Relief 29.
The combination of factors in this case—the trial court's clear failure to
perform a ministerial duty, the absence of an adequate remedy by appeal,
the fundamental nature of the parental rights at stake, and the preventable
harm that resulted to a child—creates exceptional circumstances that
warrant the extraordinary remedy of mandamus. 30. This Court has
recognized that mandamus may be appropriate in exceptional cases where
the benefits of mandamus review outweigh the detriments. In re Prudential
Ins. Co. of Am., 148 S.W.3d 124, 135-36 (Tex. 2004). This case 12 presents
such exceptional circumstances given the clear abuse of discretion, the
absence of appellate remedy, and the importance of the rights at stake. 31.
In In re R.G., 06-24-00035-CV (Tex. App. Sep 11, 2024), the court recognized
that "the Supreme Court of the United States and the Supreme Court of
Texas have recognized that involuntary termination of parental rights
involves fundamental constitutional rights. As a result, when the Department
seeks to permanently terminate the relationship between a parent and a
child, it must observe fundamentally fair procedures." This principle applies
with equal force here, where the trial court's refusal to hear an emergency
motion involving child welfare failed to observe fundamentally fair
procedures. V. The Role of the Texas Supreme Court 32. As the highest civil
court in Texas, the Supreme Court has a responsibility to ensure that the
judicial system functions properly and that fundamental rights are
protected. When lower courts fail to perform their basic ministerial duties
and appellate courts deny relief without explanation, the Supreme Court
must step in to maintain the integrity of the judicial system. 33. The
Government Code explicitly empowers the Supreme Court to issue writs of
mandamus against district judges. Tex. Gov't. Code § 22.002 provides that
"the supreme court or a justice of the supreme court may issue writs of
procedendo and certiorari and all writs of quo warranto and mandamus
agreeable to the 13 principles of law regulating those writs, against a
statutory county court judge, a statutory probate court judge, a district
judge, a court of appeals or a justice of a court of appeals, or any officer of
state government except the governor, the court of criminal appeals, or a
judge of the court of criminal appeals." 34. This grant of authority reflects
the Supreme Court's role as the ultimate guardian of legal rights in the
state's civil justice system. By granting rehearing in this case, the Court
would fulfill this important role and provide guidance to lower courts on
their obligation to hear and rule on properly filed emergency motions,
particularly those involving child welfare. VI. Conclusion 35. This Court
should grant rehearing because this case presents exceptional
circumstances that warrant extraordinary relief. The trial court's refusal to
hear Relator's properly filed emergency TRO constitutes a clear abuse of
discretion that left Relator without an adequate remedy by appeal and
resulted in preventable harm to a child. 36. The case implicates fundamental
constitutional rights, including parental rights and due process, which
deserve heightened protection. It also raises broader concerns about judicial
accountability and public confidence in the courts when judges refuse to
perform their basic ministerial duties and appellate courts deny relief
without explanation. 14 37. By granting rehearing, the Court would not only
address the specific injustice suffered by Relator and his child but also

=== PAGE 11 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
reaffirm important principles: that Texas courts must provide a meaningful
forum for litigants, especially in emergencies involving child safety; that
judges must perform their ministerial duties without bias or arbitrary
refusal; and that the judicial system as a whole must be accountable to the
people it serves. 38. The preventable harm that has already occurred to the
child in this case underscores the inadequacy of any remedy other than
mandamus. The Supreme Court should therefore grant rehearing to ensure
that justice is served and that similar harms are prevented in the future. VII.
PRAYER FOR RELIEF WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, Relator
Charles Dustin Myers respectfully prays that this Honorable Court: 1.Grant
this Motion for Rehearing in cause number 25-0367; 2.Withdraw its prior
denial of the original petition for writ of mandamus; 3.Issue a writ of
mandamus compelling the trial court to hear and rule onRelator’s properly
filed Emergency Temporary Restraining Order, asrequired by law; 4.Declare
that the trial court’s refusal to hear the emergency motion filed onMarch 28,
2025, constitutes a clear abuse of discretion and a violation of 15 Relator’s
fundamental rights under both the Texas Constitution and the United States
Constitution; 5. Hold that the trial court’s inaction deprived Relator of due
process, violated the Open Courts provision of the Texas Constitution, and
failed to prioritize the best interest of the child as required under Tex. Fam.
Code § 153.002; 6. Recognize that no adequate remedy exists by appeal, and
that mandamus relief is the only appropriate means of redress under these
circumstances; 7. Provide such other and further relief at law or in equity as
this Court deems just and proper, including the clarification of lower courts’
ministerial obligations to hear emergency matters affecting the welfare of a
child. Respectfully submitted, /s/ Charles Dustin Myers CHARLES DUSTIN

SUPREME COURT OF TEXAS BLAKE A. HAWTHORNE, CLERK 2 I.
INTRODUCTION 1. The rehearing should be granted, and mandamus

=== PAGE 12 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
petition should issue because Judge Evans abused his discretion by
overruling the relator’s procedural objections and allowing continued
involvement of the court coordinator and Associate Judge Kaitcer in recusal
proceedings, despite Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a’s clear requirements.
II. Summary 2. The petition for writ of mandamus brought by Charles Dustin
Myers (Relator) challenges Presiding Regional Judge David L.
Evans' (Respondent) order overruling objections to procedural irregularities
in recusal proceedings. The case involves two principal issues: (1) whether
the Respondent abused his discretion by permitting a court coordinator,
rather than the court clerk, to handle recusal documentation as required by
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a; and (2) whether the Respondent further
abused his discretion by allowing Associate Judge Kaitcer to file an order
referring himself for recusal despite not being named in the Relator's motion
to recuse. 3. The Texas Rules of Civil Procedure establish mandatory
procedures for handling recusal motions that cannot be circumvented by
judges or court personnel. These procedural requirements are designed to
ensure impartiality and transparency in the recusal process. The case record
demonstrates that these 3 procedural safeguards were bypassed when the
court coordinator performed duties specifically assigned to the court clerk
by Rule 18a, and when Associate Judge Kaitcer filed a recusal referral
despite not being named in any recusal motion. Because there is no
adequate remedy by appeal for these procedural violations, mandamus relief
is appropriate. III. Background and Relevant Law A. Texas Rule of Civil
Procedure 18a 4. Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a governs the recusal and
disqualification of judges in Texas. This rule establishes comprehensive
procedural requirements for handling motions to recuse. Several provisions
are particularly relevant to this case: 5. Rule 18a(e)(1) specifically addresses
the duty of the clerk when a recusal motion is filed: "When a motion or
response is filed, the clerk of the court must immediately deliver a copy to
the respondent judge and to the presiding judge of the administrative
judicial region in which the court is located ('the regional presiding judge')."
This rule unambiguously assigns the delivery responsibility to the clerk of
the court, not to other court personnel such as a court coordinator. 6. Rule
18a(f)(1) establishes the obligations of a judge who faces a recusal motion:
"Regardless of whether the motion complies with this rule, the respondent
judge, within three business days after the motion is filed, must either: (A)
sign and 4 file with the clerk an order of recusal or disqualification; or (B)
sign and file with the clerk an order referring the motion to the regional
presiding judge." This duty applies only when a motion to recuse names that
specific judge. 7. Rule 18a(f)(2)(A) restricts the actions a judge may take
after a recusal motion is filed: "If a motion is filed before evidence has been
offered at trial, the respondent judge must take no further action in the case
until the motion has been decided, except for good cause stated in writing or
on the record." B. Texas Government Code Provisions 8. Several provisions
of the Texas Government Code are also relevant: Section 74.101 establishes
the role of court coordinators: "(a) The local administrative judge and each
district or statutory county court judge may establish a court coordinator
system and appoint a court coordinator for his court to improve justice and
expedite the processing of cases through the courts. (b) Each court
coordinator serves at the pleasure of the judge who appointed him." 9.
Section 74.102 delineates the duties of court coordinators: "(a) The courts
by local administrative rule shall designate the duties of the court

=== PAGE 13 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
coordinators. (b) To promote uniform and efficient administration of justice
in this state, the court coordinators shall cooperate with regional presiding
and local administrative judges and state agencies having duties in the area
of the operation of the courts." C. Case Law on Recusal Procedures and
Mandamus Standard 5 10. Texas courts have consistently held that the
procedural requirements of Rule 18a are mandatory. In In re Thompson, 330
S.W.3d 411 (Tex. App. 2010), the court emphasized that "Rule 18a imposes
certain mandatory requirements on a judge once a motion to recuse is filed:
(c) Prior to any further proceedings in the case, the judge shall either recuse
himself or request the presiding judge of the administrative judicial district
to assign a judge to hear such motion." 11. Similarly, in In re Amir-Sharif,
NUMBER 13-19-00573-CV (Tex. App. Dec 12, 2019), the court reiterated
that "Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a(f)(1) governs the duties of the
respondent judge when a party files a motion to recuse... [r]egardless of
whether the motion complies with this rule, the respondent judge, within
three business days after the motion is filed, must either: (A) sign and file
with the clerk an order of recusal or disqualification; or (B) sign and file with
the clerk an order referring the motion to the regional presiding judge." IV.
Analysis D.The Role of Court Clerk vs. Court Coordinator in Recusal
Proceedings 12.The Relator's first issue challenges Judge Evans' decision to
overrule hisobjection regarding the court coordinator's involvement in the
recusal process. Rule 18a(e)(1) explicitly requires that "the clerk of the
court must immediately deliver a copy [of the motion] to the respondent
judge and to the presiding judge of 6 the administrative judicial region."
This language is unambiguous and assigns this duty specifically to the clerk
of the court, not to any other court personnel. 13. In overruling the Relator's
objection, Judge Evans cited Texas Government Code § 74.102(b), which
states that court coordinators "shall cooperate with regional presiding and
local administrative judges" to promote efficient administration of justice.
However, this general provision does not override the specific procedural
requirements of Rule 18a. A general statutory provision for cooperation
cannot supersede the explicit procedural safeguards established in the Texas
Rules of Civil Procedure. 14. As noted in In Re Rio Grande Valley Gas Co,
987 S.W.2d 167 (Tex. App. 1999), recusal motions must be filed "with the
clerk of the court." This reinforces the understanding that the court clerk,
not the court coordinator, is the proper recipient and handler of recusal-
related filings. 15. The distinction between clerk and coordinator is not
merely semantic. As established by Texas Government Code § 74.101(b), a
court coordinator "serves at the pleasure of the judge who appointed him."
This creates an inherent conflict when a coordinator appointed by a judge is
involved in processing motions seeking that same judge's recusal. The clerk,
by contrast, serves as a neutral officer of the court rather than as a personal
appointee of any particular judge. 7 16. Judge Evans' order stating that
"Only the judges, not the litigants, have the authority to direct the activities
of the court coordinators and clerks" misses the point. The issue is not about
who directs court personnel, but about following the procedural
requirements explicitly established by Rule 18a. The Rule itself directs that
the clerk, not the coordinator, must handle certain aspects of recusal
proceedings. E. The Improper Referral by Judge Kaitcer 17. The second
issue concerns Judge Evans' decision to overrule the Relator's objection to
Associate Judge Jeff Kaitcer's order of referral. The record shows that the
Relator's motion sought to recuse only the Honorable James Munford, not

=== PAGE 14 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Associate Judge Kaitcer. Yet Judge Kaitcer nonetheless filed an order
referring himself for recusal proceedings. 18. Texas courts have consistently
held that a judge's duties under Rule 18a are triggered only by the filing of a
motion. As stated in In re Norman, 191 S.W.3d 858 (Tex. App. 2006), "Under
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a, Judge Austin had a mandatory duty either
to recuse himself or to refer the recusal motion to the presiding judge."
However, this duty only arises when there is actually a motion seeking that
judge's recusal. 19. In In re Stearman, 252 S.W.3d 113 (Tex. App. 2008), the
court explained that "Once a recusal motion is filed, a trial judge generally
has two options: (1) 8 recuse himself/herself; or (2) forward the motion to
the presiding judge and request the assignment of another judge to hear the
motion." The triggering event is the filing of a motion to recuse that
particular judge. Without such a motion, a judge has no authority under Rule
18a to initiate recusal proceedings against himself. Judge Evans' order
attempted to rectify this procedural error by stating that "the judge who
hears the Kaitcer recusal motion may take into consideration Mr. Myers'
claim that he did not file a motion to recuse Judge Kaitcer." However, this
approach compounds rather than resolves the error. It recognizes the
existence of a "Kaitcer recusal motion" while simultaneously acknowledging
that no such motion may actually exist. If there is no motion to recuse Judge
Kaitcer, there should be no "Kaitcer recusal motion" to be heard by any
judge. 20. As stated in In re A.R., 236 S.W.3d 460 (Tex. App. 2007), "When a
judge is presented with a motion to recuse, he or she has only two options;
recusal or referral of the matter to the administrative presiding judge." The
court further held that "Failure to comply with the rule renders any actions
taken subsequent to the violation void." By implication, when no recusal
motion is filed against a particular judge, that judge has no authority to take
any action under Rule 18a. F. Abuse of Discretion Standard 21. Judge Evans'
order overruling the Relator's objections constitutes an abuse of discretion
under the standard established in Walker v. Packer, 827 S.W.2d 9 833,
839-40 (Tex. 1992). According to Ford Motor Co. v. Garcia, 363 S.W.3d 573,
578 (Tex. 2012), "an abuse of discretion occurs when a trial court's ruling is
arbitrary and unreasonable, made without regard for guiding legal
principles or supporting evidence." Similarly, In re Sw. Bell Tel. Co., 226 S.W.
3d 400, 403 (Tex. 2007) holds that "a trial court abuses its discretion when it
fails to analyze or apply the law correctly." 22. By permitting procedures
that directly contradict the requirements of Rule 18a, Judge Evans failed to
apply the law correctly. The rule's requirements that the clerk handle
certain aspects of recusal proceedings and that a judge must be named in a
recusal motion before having any duties under the rule are not discretionary.
They are mandatory procedural safeguards designed to ensure the integrity
of the recusal process. G. No Adequate Remedy by Appeal 23. For
mandamus to be appropriate, the relator must also establish that there is no
adequate remedy by appeal. While In re Union Pacific Resources Co., 969
S.W.2d 427 (Tex. 1998) held that the denial of a recusal motion can generally
be reviewed on appeal from a final judgment, the present case involves
procedural irregularities in the handling of the recusal motion itself, not
merely its denial. As explained in Monroe v. Blackmon, 946 S.W.2d 533 (Tex.
App. 1997), "The only instances in which mandamus has been found to be
appropriate to review action on 10 a motion to recuse is where the
challenged judge fails to comply with his duty under Rule of Civil Procedure
18a(c) & (d) to either recuse himself or refer the motion." The court further

=== PAGE 15 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
noted that "When the motion has not been referred for a hearing to the
administrative judge or another judge designated by him, the movant has
not had an opportunity to develop a record on his recusal motion, and,
without a record, he has no adequate remedy by appeal." 24. In De Leon v.
Aguilar, 127 S.W.3d 1 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004), the court held that mandamus
relief is appropriate when "the act sought to be compelled is purely
'ministerial' and [the relator] has no adequate legal remedy." The court
emphasized that "When a recusal motion is timely filed, Rule 18a leaves a
trial judge with no discretion—the trial judge must either recuse himself or
refer the motion for another judge to decide." 25. The procedural violations
in this case—allowing a court coordinator to perform duties assigned to the
clerk and permitting a judge to initiate recusal proceedings against himself
without a motion—undermine the integrity of the entire recusal process.
These errors cannot be adequately remedied on appeal from a final
judgment, as they affect the fundamental fairness of the proceedings
themselves. 11 H. Jurisdiction of the Supreme Court 26. The Texas Supreme
Court has original jurisdiction to issue writs of mandamus. Tex. Const. art. 5,
§ 3 provides that "The Supreme Court and the Justices thereof shall have
power to issue writs of habeas corpus, as may be prescribed by law, and
under such regulations as may be prescribed by law, the said courts and the
Justices thereof may issue the writs of mandamus, procedendo, certiorari
and such other writs, as may be necessary to enforce its jurisdiction."
Moreover, as noted in the CHAPTER 6 Petitions for Writ of Mandamus,
"Section 22.221(b) provides that a court of appeals may issue a writ of
mandamus against a judge of a district or county court in the court of
appeals' district. But, like the Supreme Court, the intermediate appellate
courts lack jurisdiction against those not listed in the statute..." 27. In In re
Lopez, 286 S.W.3d 408 (Tex. App. 2008), the court explained that "The
government code does not grant a court of appeals the authority to issue a
writ of mandamus against a regional presiding judge acting in his
administrative capacity." Since the Respondent is the regional presiding
judge, the Supreme Court is the appropriate forum for this mandamus
petition. V. Potential Arguments 28. While the procedural requirements of
Rule 18a are generally mandatory, the rule does allow for some flexibility in
certain circumstances. Rule 18a(f)(2)(A) 12 permits a judge to take further
action in a case after a recusal motion is filed if there is "good cause stated
in writing or on the record." However, Judge Evans' order overruling the
Relator's objections does not establish any good cause for deviating from the
rule's requirements regarding the clerk's duties or the necessity of a motion
before a judge can take action under the rule. 29. Similarly, while Rule
18a(g)(3)(A) allows for summary denial of non-compliant recusal motions,
this provision does not authorize the practices challenged in this case. The
rule states that "A motion to recuse that does not comply with this rule may
be denied without an oral hearing." This addresses the content and form of
recusal motions, not the procedural requirements for handling those
motions once they are filed. VI. Conclusion 30. Judge Evans abused his
discretion by overruling the Relator's objections to procedural irregularities
in the recusal process. Rule 18a specifically assigns certain duties to the
clerk of the court, not to a court coordinator who serves at the pleasure of
the judge being recused. Additionally, the rule's procedures are triggered
only by the filing of a motion to recuse a particular judge; without such a
motion, a judge has no authority to initiate recusal proceedings against

=== PAGE 16 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
himself. These procedural violations undermine the integrity of the recusal
process, which is designed to ensure impartiality and transparency. Because
these errors affect the 13 fundamental fairness of the proceedings
themselves, there is no adequate remedy by appeal. The Texas Supreme
Court has jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandamus against the regional
presiding judge, and such relief is appropriate in this case. 31. Therefore,
the Court should grant this rehearing, and the petition for writ of mandamus
should issue, directing Judge Evans to vacate his orders of May 15, 2025,
and May 6, 2025, and to follow the mandatory procedural requirements of
Rule 18a in handling the Relator's recusal motion. VII. Prayer for Relief 32.
WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, Relator Charles Dustin Myers
respectfully prays that this Honorable Court: i. Grant this Motion for
Rehearing in cause number 25-0426; ii. Withdraw its prior denial of the
petition for writ of mandamus; iii. Issue a writ of mandamus directing the
Honorable David L. Evans, Regional Presiding Judge, to vacate his orders
dated May 6 and May 15, 2025, which overruled Relator’s procedural
objections in the recusal proceedings; iv. Declare that court coordinators
may not substitute for the clerk of the court in carrying out duties explicitly
assigned to the clerk under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a, and that such
delegation is procedurally improper and void; 14 v. Declare that a judge may
not invoke Rule 18a to refer himself for recusal unless and until he is
specifically named in a motion to recuse filed by a party, and that the
referral by Associate Judge Kaitcer was unauthorized and invalid; vi. Clarify
that compliance with Rule 18a is mandatory, and that failure to follow its
procedures—including improper delegation and unauthorized referrals—
constitutes an abuse of discretion warranting mandamus relief; vii. Declare
that these procedural violations deprived Relator of due process and
compromised the integrity and neutrality of the recusal process, leaving no
adequate remedy by appeal; viii. Direct the Respondent to ensure proper
handling of all future Rule 18a motions, including delivery by the court clerk
and proper identification of the respondent judge in accordance with the
rule; ix. Grant such other and further relief to which Relator may be justly
entitled at law or in equity. 15 Respectfully submitted, /s/ Charles Dustin

OF THE CASE Nature of Underlying Proceeding: This original proceeding
arises from a divorce action, No. 322-744263-23, pending in the 322nd
District Court of Tarrant County, Texas. The Relator initiated recusal
proceedings under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a, which were handled in
a manner which deviated outside of Rule 18a’s requirements. See 25-0426.
The current petition addresses the summary denial of the recusal motion
and highlights a broader pattern of systemic failures below. Respondent
Judge: The Respondent Judge, Honorable John H. Cayce, Jr., is the presiding
Judge of the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County by assignment from the
Regional Presiding Judge of the 8th Administrative Judicial Region of Texas.
Respondent’s Challenged Actions: Respondent’s summary denial of the
Relator’s recusal motion was an abuse of discretion because it came after
the failure of the Respondent and Regional Presiding judges to comply with
Rule 18a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. The quick decision denied a
motion which was never filed, and the provided reasoning does not comport
with the face of the motion, and was made to prevent mandamus review of
case number 25-046, leaving the Relator without an appellate remedy to
address the issues. 6 Statement of Jurisdiction This Petition for Writ of
Mandamus is originally filed in the Supreme Court of Texas, which possesses
concurrent jurisdiction to issue writs of mandamus against assigned judges
pursuant to Article V, Section 3 of the Texas Constitution and Texas
Government Code § 22.002(a). The compelling reason that this mandamus
has been brought before this Honorable Court prior to being adjudicated in
the Second Court of Appeals is because the error alleged could affect the
four concurrent mandamus petitions pending with the same parties or
otherwise could impede this Court’s ability to properly adjudicate them,
justifying this Mandamus to "enforce [the Court’s] jurisdiction" as permitted
by Tex. Const. art. 5 § 3. The mandamus is necessary to protect or enforce
the Supreme Court's jurisdiction over the pending petitions.1 1 See 25-0361,
25-0367, 25-0378, and 25-0426. 7 ISSUES PRESENTED Issue No. 1: The
Respondent abused his discretion when summarily denying the Relator’s
recusal motion without a hearing and for reasons that do not comport with
the motion filed. Issue No. 2: The compounding issues in this matter reveal a
pattern of conduct that has broader implications for the Texas Legal System
if not resolved and have perpetuated the lack of an appellate remedy. 8
STATEMENT OF FACTS On April 28, 2025, the Relator filed a First Amended
Motion to Recuse, naming Honorable James Munford of the 322nd District
Court of Tarrant County as the respondent judge (MR 1). In the motion,
starting on page 19, the Relator referenced the prior recusal proceedings
initiated on October 7, 2024, highlighting a four-month delay between when
the first motion to recuse was ruled on versus when the judges were re-
instated into the case due to the involvement of the court coordinator. (MR
1.19-1.20). In the next section of the motion underneath the header “IV.
PROCEDURE”, the Relator reiterated the correct recusal process pursuant
to Rule 18a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure and specifically objected to
any involvement of the court coordinator in the process in the current
recusal proceedings. (MR. 1.20) The following day, after receiving receipt of
the referral orders from the court coordinator of the 322nd District Court of

=== PAGE 19 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Tarrant County, including one from Honorable Kaitcer (MR 2, MR 3), the
Relator filed an Objection – Procedural Handling, where he raised attention
to two key issues: “…a judge who was never implicated in the present
recusal motion has inexplicably involved himself without justification, the
court coordinator improperly continues to perform roles for which she has
no lawful authority…” (MR 4.3) On May 6, 2025, an order of assignment was
issued by the Honorable David L. Evans of the 8th Administrative Judicial
Region of Texas appointing “Honorable 9 John H. Cayce, Senior Chief
Justice, Second Court of Appeals to the 322nd District Court of Tarrant
County”, and on the face of this order, the District Clerk, Honorable James
Munford, and the appointed judge were CC’ed (MR 5). The order also stated
“[t]he judge is assigned to preside in the Motion to Recuse the Honorable
James Munford and the Honorable Jeffrey Kaitcer filed by Charles Dustin
Myers on April 25, 2025, and the First Amended Motion to Recuse the
Honorable James Munford and the Honorable Jeffrey Kaitcer filed on April
28, 2025 in Cause Number 322-744263-23…” In response, an Objection to
the Order of Assignment Dated May 6, 2025, was filed complaining of the
same two primary issues: 1) the involvement of the court coordinator and 2)
the erroneous order of referral issued by Hon. Kaitcer. (MR 6) Specifically, it
was stated: “…the Amended Recusal Motion filed on April 28, 2025, named
only the Honorable James Munford as the judge whose recusal was sought.
It did not seek the recusal of the Honorable Jeffrey Kaitcer.” (MR 6.2 at 2)
and: “Despite Respondent’s objections, the Court Coordinator for the 322nd
District Court has continued to be involved in the administrative handling
and communication regarding these recusal proceedings.” (MR 6.2 at 5) On
May 15, 2025, the Regional Presiding Judge issued an order overruling the
Relator’s complaints, leading to mandamus petition 25-0426 before this
Honorable Court filed on May 19, 2025 (MR 8). The very next day, two
orders 10 were issued by Honorable John. H. Cayce, Jr., the Respondent
judge named herein, summarily denying the recusal motion (APP 1, APP 2).
Specifically, the first order issued by the Respondent found that Relator’s
motion was: “…based solely on the judge's rulings in the case under Tex. R.
Civ. P. 18a (a) (3), and, even assuming they are not, the motions fail to state
with detail and particularity facts that are within the affiant's personal
knowledge, or on information and belief, that would be admissible in
evidence and that, if proven, would be sufficient to justify recusal of Judge
Munford on any ground specified in Tex. R. Civ. P. 18b (b), as required by
Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a (a)(4).” (APP 1.1) The second order was an order denying
the recusal of Hon. Jeffrey Kaitcer, where it was stated: “After reviewing the
motion and amended motion, as well as the Objection to Order of
Assignment dated May 6, 2025 in which the movant claims that he did not
file a motion to recuse Associate Judge Kaitcer, I find that, based on the
substance of said motions and movant's own admission that he is not
seeking to recuse Associate Judge Kaitcer, the referred motion and amended
motion do not comply with Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a (a).” (APP 2.1) Both orders
were transmitted by the court coordinator via informal email (APP 1.2, APP
2.2). The following day, on May 21, 2025, the Relator filed a Notice of Intent
to File Mandamus, highlighting his intent to challenge these orders and
providing the trial court with an opportunity to correct the error and
schedule the matter for a hearing out of respect (MR 9). Specifically, the
Relator stated that: “The [Relator] correctly invoked Texas Rule of Civil
Procedure 18a(f)(3) by filing a timely objection to procedural deviations in

=== PAGE 20 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
the administration of the recusal proceedings.” (MR 9.5) 11 Specifically,
after outlining the correct recusal process pursuant to Rule 18a, the Relator
stated that: “The Court’s decision to summarily deny the motion to recuse
Hon. James Munford and also summarily deny a motion that was never filed
raises the question as to what motion the court was reviewing, and if it was
a true and accurate copy of the motion as filed with the clerk of the
court.” (MR 9.6) And highlighted that: “…the ruling on a motion which was
never filed came after the involvement of the court coordinator who serves
at the pleasure of the same Judge subject to recusal.” (MR 9.7) In the
absence of any corrective measures or guidance from the lower court, and
with no active opposition or available appellate remedy, the Relator has now
prepared this petition for a writ of mandamus. This submission represents
the fifth concurrent mandamus petition before this Honorable Court, and the
sixth overall, revealing a pattern. The initial issues remain unresolved, and
five additional issues have been introduced. The only guidance received has
been in the form if nine per curiam denials from the Second Court of
Appeals.2 2 See In re C.M., No. 02-24-00149-CV (Tex. App.—Fort Worth Apr.

COURT OF TEXAS: The essence of this case is encapsulated in a single,
profound word: accountability. The journey of the Relator, CHARLES
DUSTIN MYERS, is not one of a mere pro-se litigant fumbling through the
legal system, but rather that of a devoted father and relentless advocate for
his children, M.E.M. and C.R.M. This is a man who, having been stripped of
everything at the outset, stands before this Court with nothing left to lose
and everything to gain by zealously advocating on behalf of his minor
children while upholding Texas law established by this very institution. This
endeavor is not an affront to the judiciary, but a clarion call to recognize the
lengths to which the Relator has gone to draw awareness to the fact that he
has no opponent – only time. That he has not made excuses, but rather
diligently pursued his rights in accordance with Texas laws and procedure to
the best of his ability. This Petition, alongside the concurrent proceedings
docketed under cause numbers 25- 0361, 25-0367, 25-0378, and 25-0426
reflect an ongoing procedural disaster that should have been dismissed
months ago for want of prosecution. Nevertheless, the Relator now turns to
the ripest issue. emergency relief); In re Charles Dustin Myers, No.

=== PAGE 21 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
below, the Real Party, and all Honorable Respondents collectively named
herein have remained silent on the compounding issues before this Court, a
common theme across all five mandamus petitions. The reason this web of
procedural violations exists to begin with is due to their fraudulent
inducement by the Real Party. Instead of taking judicial action on these
significant claims supported by hundreds of pages of supporting
documentation that remain un-opposed, and instead of acting sua sponte to
prevent the ongoing damage to the parent-child relationship, the Relator’s
business operations, and to effectuate longoverdue justice, each Respondent
named in these petitions has played their part in a broader pattern of
systemic failure that seems to be derived from one singular line of
reasoning: the Relator is representing himself pro-se. This bias has proven
to be so significant that it has affected the decision making process across
two district courts, administrative proceedings, and has condoned silence
from an attorney who has not performed her duties diligently as the Relator
seeks redress. This bias is misplaced and must be set aside so these matters
can be dealt with from a legal perspective in accordance with Texas law. It is
imperative that this Court stay these proceedings which will restore the
rights of the Relator and allow for a comprehensive review of the issues at
hand, as the the Relator possesses no corrective appellate or administrative
remedy. 14 ARGUMENT I. Standard of review Mandamus is an
extraordinary remedy available only in situations involving manifest and
urgent necessity and not for grievances that may be addressed by other
remedies. To obtain mandamus relief in Texas, a relator must satisfy a
wellestablished two-prong test by demonstrating: (1) that the lower court
committed a clear abuse of discretion and (2) that there is no adequate
remedy at law, such as a normal appeal. The matter of In re Prudential Ins.
Co. of America, 148 S.W.3d 124, (Tex. 2003) established this standard,
stating: "Mandamus is an extraordinary remedy available 'only in situations
involving manifest and urgent necessity and not for grievances that may be
addressed by other remedies.' (quoting Walker v. Packer, 827 S.W.2d 833,
840 (Tex.1992)). To obtain mandamus relief, the relator must satisfy a two-
prong test. Relator must demonstrate (1) that the lower court committed a
clear abuse of discretion (2) for which there is no adequate remedy at law,
such as a normal appeal." Id. at 839-40. A party establishes that its appellate
remedy is inadequate by showing that it is in real danger of permanently
losing its substantial rights. Perry v. Del Rio, 66 S.W.3d 239, 257 (Tex.2001);
Walker, 827 S.W.2d at 842; Canadian Helicopters, Ltd. v. Wittig, 876 S.W.2d
304, 15 306 (Tex.1994). That is precisely the present matter at hand, as
explained in more detail below. II. The Respondent abused his discretion
when summarily denying the Relator’s recusal motion without a hearing and
for reasons that do not comport with the motion filed. Rule 1 of the Texas
Rules of Civil Procedure states that the proper objective of the rules is "to
obtain a just, fair, equitable and impartial adjudication of the rights of
litigants under established principles of substantive law." See also Taylor v.
Taylor (Tex. App. 2001). When a court fails to comply with Rule 18a, this
would undermine this objective, and the case may be remanded on appeal to
ensure proper procedures are followed. Ex parte Sinegar, 324 S.W.3d 578
(Tex. Crim. App. 2010) illustrates this consequence, where the court
remanded the case "for the trial judge to rule on applicant's motion to
recuse pursuant to Rule 18a(c)." As emphasized in In re Union Pacific
Resources Co., 969 S.W.2d 427 (Tex. 1998) and Spigener v. Wallis, 80 S.W.3d

=== PAGE 22 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
174 (Tex. App. 2002) both emphasize that the erroneous denial of a recusal
motion "is not fundamental error and can be waived if not raised by proper
motion." This suggests that parties must be diligent in objecting to Rule 18a
violations and preserving the issue for appeal. In other words, parties may
seek mandamus relief to compel compliance with Rule 18a, as demonstrated
in In re Thompson, 330 S.W.3d 411 (Tex. App. 2010) and In re Amir- Sharif,
NUMBER 13-19-00573-CV (Tex. App. Dec 12, 2019). 16 Here, the Relator
objected to the deviations from the clear process of Rule 18a, the court
overruled it, leading to cause number 25-0426 to seek compliance with the
rule, and then after receiving receipt of this challenge, the court proceeded
to use the same rule to summarily deny relief with reasoning that cannot be
attributed to the motion as submitted. As stated in the Notice to Intent to
File Mandamus: “While the Respondent respects this court’s engagement,
the reasoning provided does not comport with the face of the motion. The
bookmarks provided in the PDF alone provide clear grounds for recusal that
are not solely based on the judge’s rulings” (MR 9.6-9.7) The fact that a
second order denying a motion that was never filed was ruled on strongly
supports that the involvement of the court coordinator has caused ambiguity
in the recusal process, lead to orders that do not comport with the
substance of the motion, and the summary denials appear to be an attempt
to prevent mandamus adjudication. When a trial court creates an
appearance of impartiality, which is what has occurred here, the entire
purpose of the recusal proceedings becomes undermined, and the Relator
now faces serious risk of losing his substantial rights to property, the liberty
interest of his children, and the right to a fair and impartial tribunal. The
entire purpose of the recusal proceedings were. The bookmarks provided in
the PDF alone provide clear grounds for recusal that are not solely based on
the judge’s rulings. 17 III. The compounding issues in this matter reveal a
pattern of conduct that has broader implications for the Texas Legal System
if not resolved, and have perpetuated the lack of an appellate remedy. There
are a few distinct facts on the face of the record provided that raise
significant concerns about how the recusal process was handled, revealing a
broader pattern that threatens the impartiality of the Texas judiciary. First,
the order of assignment dated May 6, 2025, only had Hon. James Munford,
the Clerk of the Court, and the Respondent named therein CC’ed. (MR 5.1)
If the court truly believed a motion to recuse Honorable Jeff Kaitcer was
filed, then why wouldn’t they have included him in the correspondence?
Second, the order of referral signed by Hon. Jeff Kaitcer stated: “On April
25, 2025, a Motion to Recuse filed by Charles Dustin Myers was delivered to
the Associate Judge of this Court.” Between the person who delivered the
motion, the Associate Judge himself, the Regional Presiding Judge, and the
Assigned Judge – the motion could not have been properly reviewed,
because if it had been – it would have been clearly established that the
motion did not seek the recusal of Hon. Jeff Kaitcer. A cursory review of the
motion establishes this fact in several areas, including on page 22 of the
motion (MR. 1.22), in the Prayer for Relief (MR. 1.34), and in the Affidavit
(MR. 1.36). Finally, because of the way that these recusal proceedings were
handled in comparison to the prior recusal proceedings, serious concerns
regarding the 18 impartiality of the tribunal remain in question. As stated in
the amended motion to recuse as originally filed regarding the prior recusal
proceedings: “James Munford had to amend his initial referral order due to
procedural abnormalities revolving the court coordinator and tampering

=== PAGE 23 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
with documents due to alleged file size.” (MR 1.12)(emphasis added) This is
not a minor error. This is significant, because the motion as submitted was
stripped of the hyperlinks, bookmarks, and was non text-searchable after the
coordinator became involved, and had its’ affidavit and exhibits removed. It
was only after pointing out these errors that the reasoning changed, and the
motion was then was split into three parts due to the motion’s apparent size
in an amended order of referral. These actions create an appearance of
impartiality and deviates from the standard recusal protocol pursuant to
Rule 18a, which is why the Relator objected to the involvement of the
coordinator in these current proceedings to begin with in the motion itself
(MR 1.20). The court should have sustained the objection and held a hearing
on the recusal matters once the threshold issues were resolved. Instead, it
chose to introduce ambiguity into this process and stray from the rules.
CONCLUSION The record before this Court illuminates a judicial landscape
where procedural safeguards have been systematically dismantled, leaving
in their wake a hollow shell of what due process demands. When a court
coordinator—who serves 19 at the pleasure of the very judge subject to
recusal—inserts herself into proceedings explicitly designed to be free from
such influence, the foundation of impartiality crumbles. When orders
reference motions never filed, deny hearings explicitly required by law, and
mischaracterize the very substance of pleadings properly before the court,
we witness not mere oversight but the collapse of procedural integrity. The
pattern revealed across five concurrent mandamus petitions transcends
isolated error. It manifests a judicial environment where a pro se litigant's
rights have been subordinated to expediency, where silence has become the
response to substantiated allegations, and where the machinery of justice
grinds forward without the lubricant of fairness or the compass of law. The
uncontested record demonstrates that at every critical juncture, Rule 18a's
requirements have been selectively applied, creating an impenetrable maze
where appellate remedies vanish into procedural dead ends. What stands
before this Court is not merely a technical violation of recusal procedures,
but the systematic erosion of the bedrock principles upon which our judicial
system rests. When a father seeking nothing more than the protection of his
relationship with his children is met with procedural barriers erected by the
very institutions designed to safeguard those relationships, the damage
extends beyond a 20 single case. It reaches into the public's perception of
whether justice remains accessible to all, regardless of representation
status. The absence of opposition to these proceedings speaks volumes. In
this silence lies tacit acknowledgment that the procedural labyrinth created
below cannot be defended on its merits. The unrefuted record demonstrates
that the Relator has diligently pursued every available avenue for redress,
only to find each path obstructed by deviations from established procedure.
This Court now stands as the final bulwark against the perpetuation of a
process that has strayed so far from its statutory moorings that it threatens
to become unrecognizable. The fact of the matter remains: no response has
been issued. No opposition to the relief being requested, including the
emergency stays submitted in cause numbers 25-0361 and 25-0426, has
been filed. Therefore, the proceedings below should be stayed, not merely to
correct the trajectory of a single case, but to reaffirm that in Texas,
procedural rules are not mere suggestions to be selectively followed, but to
prevent further errors from occurring pending review, to restore the parent-
child bond, and allow for a comprehensive review of all five petitions. The

=== PAGE 24 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Relator remains committed to resolving these matters and has filed each
petition with good intention. He seeks to restore what was wrongfully taken
from him, which does not threaten the rights of any participant in this
matter, and would serve the children’s best interests. 21 By staying these
proceedings, Texas’ essential architecture of justice itself is preserved
pending review, and the rights of the Relator would be restored, the public
Policy will be upheld. The integrity of our judicial system and the children in
this matter demand no less. PRAYER WHEREFORE, ALL PREMISES
CONSIDERED, the Relator, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, respectfully prays
that this Honorable Court provide the following relief: 1. Grant the
emergency stay filed in cause number 25-0426 pending mandamus review to
stay the administrative proceedings; 2. Grant the emergency stay filed in
cause number 25-0361 pending mandamus review to stay the trial court
proceedings; 3. Consider granting the Third Amended Motion to Consolidate
that will follow the submission of this Petition for Writ of Mandamus to
provide a more streamlined review of the issues; 4. After review, issue
mandamus against the Respondent judge named herein, compelling him to
vacate the Orders Summarily Denying the First Amended Motion to Recuse
the Honorable James Munford, thereby preserving this court’s jurisdiction
regarding cause number 25-0426; 22 5. Grant any additional equitable or
special relief that this Honorable Court deems just and proper under the
circumstances. Respectfully submitted, /s/ Charles Dustin Myers CHARLES

Munford signed April 29, 2025, referring a Motion to Recuse and First
Amended Motion to Recuse filed by Charles Dustin Myers in the above-

numbers 25-0367, 25-0378, 25-0426, and 25-0458 to incorporate potential
counter arguments and why they fail. This Court should grant mandamus
relief for cause number 25-0361, and in support of this request, shows the
following undisputed facts: IN RE: CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS FILED
25-0361 7/11/2025 10:12 AM tex-103017353 SUPREME COURT OF TEXAS
BLAKE A. HAWTHORNE, CLERK 2 I. INTRODUCTION 1. The Texas
Supreme Court should grant Myers' petition for writ of mandamus because
the associate judge lacked statutory authority to render and sign temporary
orders after the relator withdrew consent and timely requested a de novo
hearing, and the orders were never properly adopted by the referring court
as required by the Texas Family Code. II. Summary 2. The Relator, Charles
Dustin Myers, is seeking mandamus relief from the Texas Supreme Court
after being denied relief by the Second Court of Appeals. The underlying
issue concerns temporary orders entered by an associate judge in a divorce
proceeding despite Myers' timely withdrawal of consent and request for a de
novo hearing. Under Texas Family Code, an associate judge has limited
authority to enter final orders, with specific exceptions that are not
applicable in this case once consent has been withdrawn. 3. The petition for
mandamus relief should be granted because the associate judge acted
beyond his statutory authority by entering orders after Myers revoked his
consent and requested a de novo hearing. Furthermore, the associate
judge's orders never became effective as orders of the referring court
because they were not properly adopted by the referring district judge as
required by the Texas Family Code. These orders are therefore void, not
merely voidable, and mandamus is the 3 appropriate remedy since void
orders can be challenged at any time and appeal is not an adequate remedy.
III. Background and Relevant Law A. Texas Family Code Provisions on
Associate Judge Authority 4. The Texas Family Code carefully circumscribes
the authority of associate judges. Under Tex. Fam. Code § 201.007, an
associate judge may conduct hearings, hear evidence, make findings of fact,
formulate conclusions of law, and recommend orders. However, the
associate judge's authority to render and sign final orders is limited to
specific circumstances enumerated in Tex. Fam. Code § 201.007(a)(14),
which provides that an associate judge may "without prejudice to the right
to a de novo hearing before the referring court under Section 201.015 and
subject to Subsection (c), render and sign: (A) a final order agreed to in
writing as to both form and substance by all parties; (B) a final default
order; (C) a temporary order; or (D) a final order in a case in which a party
files an unrevoked waiver made in accordance with Rule 119, Texas Rules of
Civil Procedure, that waives notice to the party of the final hearing or waives
the party's appearance at the final hearing." 4 5. This authority is explicitly
"subject to Subsection (c)," which provides that a final order described in
Subsection (a)(14) "becomes final after the expiration of the period
described by Section 201.015(a) if a party does not request a de novo
hearing in accordance with that section." Tex. Fam. Code § 201.007(c). 6.
The right to request a de novo hearing is established in Tex. Fam. Code §
201.015(a), which states: "A party may request a de novo hearing before the
referring court by filing with the clerk of the referring court a written
request not later than the third working day after the date the party receives
notice of: (1) the substance of the associate judge's report as provided by
Section 201.011; or (2) the rendering of the temporary order, if the request

=== PAGE 28 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
concerns a temporary order rendered by an associate judge under Section
201.007(a)(14)(C)." 7. When such a request is made, Tex. Fam. Code §
201.015(f) requires: "The referring court, after notice to the parties, shall
hold a de novo hearing not later than the 30th day after the date on which
the initial request for a de novo hearing was filed with the clerk of the
referring court." 8. Furthermore, Tex. Fam. Code § 201.013(b) provides that
in cases where there is no appeal to the referring court (i.e., no request for a
de novo hearing), the findings and recommendations of the associate judge
become the order of the 5 referring court only when "the referring court
signs an order conforming to the associate judge's report." 9. These
provisions make clear that an associate judge's order is not final if a party
timely requests a de novo hearing, and the associate judge's findings and
recommendations must be presented to and adopted by the referring court
through the judge's signature to become an effective order of the court. IV.
Analysis B. The Associate Judge Lacked Authority to Enter the Challenged
Orders 15. The facts of this case demonstrate that the associate judge
lacked the statutory authority to enter the temporary orders that are being
challenged. While Myers initially signed an "Agreed Associate Judge's
Report" on February 1, 2024, he explicitly withdrew his consent by filing an
emergency motion to vacate on February 9, 2024. This withdrawal of
consent occurred within three working days of notice of the associate
judge's report, well within the time limit prescribed by Tex. Fam. Code §
201.015(a) for requesting a de novo hearing. 16. Once Myers withdrew his
consent and requested a de novo hearing, the associate judge's authority to
render and sign a final order under Tex. Fam. Code § 201.007(a)(14)(A) was
removed. This subsection allows an associate judge to sign 6 a final order
only if it is "agreed to in writing as to both form and substance by all
parties." With Myers' withdrawal of consent, this condition was no longer
satisfied. Furthermore, Tex. Fam. Code § 201.007(c) explicitly states that a
final order under subsection (a)(14) becomes final only if "a party does not
request a de novo hearing in accordance with that section." Myers did
request such a hearing, which means the associate judge's report could not
become final. 17. The March 14, 2024, hearing conducted by the associate
judge after Myers' request for a de novo hearing was procedurally improper.
According to Tex. Fam. Code § 201.015(f), the referring court (the district
court judge), not the associate judge, "shall hold a de novo hearing" after a
request is filed. By conducting the hearing himself, the associate judge
exceeded his statutory authority. 18. Most significantly, the March 26, 2024,
temporary orders recite that "all parties have agreed to the terms... as
evidenced by the signatures below," despite the fact that Myers had
explicitly withdrawn his consent and did not sign the orders. This
mischaracterization further demonstrates that the orders were not properly
entered according to the requirements of Tex. Fam. Code § 201.007(a)(14)
(A), which requires agreement by all parties. 7 C. The Orders Never Became
Orders of the Referring Court 19. Even if the associate judge had the
authority to issue recommendations or temporary orders (which he did not
after Myers withdrew consent), those orders never became effective orders
of the referring court because they were never properly adopted. Under Tex.
Fam. Code § 201.013(b), an associate judge's findings and recommendations
become the order of the referring court only when "the referring court signs
an order conforming to the associate judge's report." The record indicates
that the district court judge never signed any order adopting the associate

=== PAGE 29 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
judge's recommendations. The March 26, 2024, temporary orders were only
attested to by the district court clerk, not signed by the district court judge
as required by law. 20. As the court held in Graham v. Graham, 414 S.W.3d
800 (Tex. App. 2013): "In cases in which there is no appeal to the referring
court, the findings and recommendations of the associate judge will become
the order of the referring court when the referring court signs an order
conforming to the associate judge's report." Here, there was an appeal to
the referring court in the form of Myers' request for a de novo hearing, and
the referring court never signed any order adopting the associate judge's
report. Therefore, the temporary orders never properly took effect. 8 D.The
Orders Are Void and Mandamus Is the Appropriate Remedy 21.Because the
associate judge acted beyond his statutory authority, andbecause the orders
were never properly adopted by the referring court, the March 26, 2024,
temporary orders are void, not merely voidable. 22.As explained in In re
Office of Attorney General of Texas, 264 S.W.3d800 (Tex. App. 2008):
"Mandamus is available when a judge acts outside of his court's jurisdiction,
i.e., when the judicial act is void... Mandamus will issue to vacate a void
order even when there is an adequate remedy by appeal." 23. Furthermore,
temporary orders in family law cases are not appealable, making mandamus
the only appropriate remedy. As stated in In re Hita (Tex. App. May 14,
2025), "Because a trial court's temporary orders are not appealable,
mandamus is an appropriate means to challenge them." 24. The situation in
this case is analogous to that in In re Gold, 04-25-00085-CV (Tex. App. May
07, 2025), where the court held that when a judge fails to follow procedural
requirements, "all subsequent actions by the judge in that case are void."
Here, the associate judge failed to follow the procedural requirements of the
Texas Family Code by entering orders after consent had been withdrawn and
a de novo hearing had been requested, and by failing to ensure that those
orders were properly adopted by the referring court. 9 25. Additionally, In re
Harris (Tex. App. Feb. 29, 2024) held that "If an order or judgment is signed
after the court loses plenary jurisdiction, the order or judgment is void."
Similarly, once Myers withdrew his consent and requested a de novo
hearing, the associate judge lost jurisdiction to enter the orders without
following the proper procedures for a de novo hearing before the referring
court. E. The Second Court of Appeals Erred in Denying Relief 26. The
Second Court of Appeals' per curiam denial of Myers' petition for writ of
mandamus was erroneous. The court did not provide any reasoning for its
denial, but given the clear statutory provisions and case law, the associate
judge's actions were beyond his authority and the resulting orders are void.
As the Supreme Court has recognized, mandamus will issue to remedy void
orders regardless of whether the relator has an adequate remedy by appeal.
The Second Court of Appeals should have granted the petition and directed
the trial court to vacate the unauthorized orders. V. POTENTIAL
ARGUMENTS 27. There are a few potential arguments against granting
mandamus relief, but they are not persuasive in this case: i. One might
argue that Myers' filing on February 9, 2024, which was styled as a "Motion
for Reconsideration and to Vacate 10 Temporary Orders," was not a proper
request for a de novo hearing under Tex. Fam. Code § 201.015. However, the
substance of the filing, which explicitly withdrew consent and requested a
hearing, should be treated as a de novo hearing request regardless of how it
was styled. The Texas Family Code does not prescribe a specific form for
requesting a de novo hearing, only that it be made in writing and filed within

=== PAGE 30 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
the three-working-day deadline. ii. One might also argue that the associate
judge's orders were merely voidable, not void, and that Myers should have
pursued other remedies. However, as established in In re Office of Attorney
General of Texas, 264 S.W.3d 800 (Tex. App. 2008), orders entered outside a
court's jurisdiction are void, not voidable. The associate judge's lack of
statutory authority to qenter the orders after Myers withdrew consent and
requested a de novo hearing places this case squarely within the category of
void orders. iii. Finally, one might argue that Myers should have appealed
the associate judge's decision to the district court rather than seeking
mandamus relief. However, Tex. Fam. Code § 11 201.015 already provides
for de novo review before the referring court, and Myers properly requested
such review. It was the associate judge who failed to refer the matter to the
district court as required by law. Moreover, as noted in In re Hita (Tex. App.
May 14, 2025), temporary orders are not appealable, making mandamus the
appropriate remedy. VI. Conclusion 28. For the foregoing reasons, the Texas
Supreme Court should grant Myers' petition for writ of mandamus. The
associate judge lacked the statutory authority to enter the temporary orders
after Myers withdrew his consent and requested a de novo hearing.
Furthermore, the orders were never properly adopted by the referring court
as required by the Texas Family Code. As a result, the orders are void, and
mandamus is the appropriate remedy to vacate them. 29. The Texas Family
Code provides a clear framework governing the authority of associate judges
and the procedures for challenging their recommendations through de novo
hearings before the referring court. This framework was not followed in this
case, resulting in orders that exceed the associate judge's statutory
authority and were never properly adopted by the referring court. 12 30. By
granting mandamus relief and directing the trial court to vacate the
unauthorized orders, the Supreme Court would uphold the statutory limits
on associate judge authority and ensure that parties' rights to de novo
hearings before referring courts are protected. This would also prevent the
ongoing harm to Myers caused by void orders that have remained in effect
for over sixteen months despite having no legal validity. VII. Prayer for Relief
31. WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, Relator Charles Dustin Myers
respectfully prays that this Honorable Court: i. Grant this Motion for
Rehearing in cause number 25-0361; ii. Withdraw its denial of the original
petition for writ of mandamus; iii. Issue a writ of mandamus compelling the
322nd District Court of Tarrant County, Texas, to vacate the temporary
orders signed March 26, 2024, as void; iv. Declare that the associate judge
acted beyond his statutory authority by rendering and signing the temporary
orders after Relator timely withdrew consent and requested a de novo
hearing under Tex. Fam. Code § 201.015; 13 v. Declare that said orders were
never properly adopted by the referring court in accordance with Tex. Fam.
Code § 201.013(b), and therefore never became enforceable orders of the
court; vi. Grant any such further relief to which Relator may be justly
entitled in law or in equity. Respectfully submitted, /s/ Charles Dustin Myers

supreme court of texas refuses to act on such clear abuses of discretion, and
assuming pro-se litigants have a fool for a client is now outdated. the case

because it was initiated fraudulently. relator is now taking the initiative and
pursuing federal claims against the petitioner in the state case, who has
remained completely silent alongside her attorney, all 5 judges, and the
supreme court of texas. Research how if rehearing isnt granted, the texas
supreme court is allowing this abuse to persist, it is damaging our state and
the future of our state, and will not just go away. What are the legal and
ethical consequences when the Texas Supreme Court fails to act on clear,
repeated abuses of discretion by multiple lower court judges in a family law
case, especially where the case has exceeded time standards, there is no
opposition from the real party or counsel, and the relator has initiated
federal litigation due to lack of state court remedy? How does this impact
judicial accountability, public confidence, and the integrity of the Texas
judicial system?
Answer (Texas)
Short response
When the Texas Supreme Court fails to act on clear abuses of discretion by
multiple lower courts in family law cases with no opposition from real
parties, it undermines the mandamus remedy designed to correct such
abuses and erodes public confidence in judicial accountability. This failure
can be particularly detrimental in family law matters involving fundamental
parental rights and child welfare, where the absence of timely intervention
may cause irreparable harm and force litigants to seek federal remedies.
Summary
The Texas Supreme Court's failure to address clear, repeated abuses of
discretion by lower courts in family law cases creates a systemic
accountability gap that threatens the integrity of the judicial system.
Mandamus relief exists precisely to remedy situations where trial courts
clearly abuse their discretion and no adequate appellate remedy exists, as is
often the case with temporary orders in family law matters. When the state's
highest civil court declines to fulfill this oversight function, especially in
cases involving fundamental rights where the real party has mounted no

=== PAGE 32 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
opposition, it effectively sanctions procedural violations that may cause
lasting harm.
The consequences extend well beyond the individual case, affecting public
confidence in the judiciary as a whole. When pro se litigants see their
properly filed motions summarily denied without meaningful review, despite
clear legal authority supporting their position, it creates the perception of a
two-tiered system of justice. This perception is particularly problematic in
family law matters, where the Texas Supreme Court has recognized that
fundamental constitutional rights are at stake, including parental rights that
deserve heightened protection. The eventual resort to federal litigation by
state court litigants represents a failure of the state judicial system to
provide the remedies that its own laws and precedents promise.
Background and Relevant Legal Framework
The legal framework for mandamus relief in Texas provides a clear standard
for intervention by higher courts when lower courts fail to fulfill their duties.
For a relator to be entitled to mandamus relief, two requirements must be
satisfied: (1) the trial court clearly abused its discretion and (2) the relator
has no adequate remedy on appeal.
In re Lee, 411 S.W.3d 445, 56 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 1247 (Tex. 2013) establishes
that "Mandamus relief will lie if the relator establishes a clear abuse of
discretion for which there is no adequate appellate remedy." The court
further explained that a "trial court clearly abuses its discretion if it reaches
a decision so arbitrary and unreasonable as to constitute a clear and
prejudicial error of law." It should be noted that this case was later
disagreed with by Cojocar v. Cojocar, NO. 03-14-00422-CV (Tex. App. Jun 16,
2016), though the disagreement was on other grounds and did not affect the
fundamental standard for mandamus relief.
This standard is further elaborated in In re Villanueva, 292 S.W.3d 236 (Tex.
App. 2009), which held that "Mandamus will issue only when the mandamus
record establishes (1) a clear abuse of discretion or the violation of a duty
imposed by law and (2) the absence of a clear and adequate remedy at law."
The court also emphasized that "A clear failure by the trial court to apply the
law correctly is an abuse of discretion," and that mandamus relief is
appropriate "if it does not appear litigation will continue such that there will
be a final order, there is no adequate remedy by appeal."
This framework is particularly relevant in family law cases, where temporary
orders are not appealable and where fundamental rights are at stake. In re
N.R.C., 94 S.W.3d 799 (Tex. App. 2002) highlights the gravity of family law
proceedings, noting that the Texas Supreme Court "has recognized that the
involuntary termination of parental rights implicates fundamental
constitutional rights." The court compared termination of parental rights to
"the death penalty of the parent-child relationship" and "the capital
punishment of civil law," underscoring the heightened scrutiny that should
apply in cases involving parental rights.

Analysis
Undermining the Mandamus Remedy
When the Texas Supreme Court fails to act on clear abuses of discretion in
lower courts, particularly in family law cases with no opposition from the
real party, it effectively undermines the mandamus remedy that exists
precisely to address such situations. The mandamus standard articulated in 
In re Lee, 411 S.W.3d 445 and In re Villanueva, 292 S.W.3d 236 creates a
clear framework for intervention when trial courts abuse their discretion
and no adequate appellate remedy exists.
The failure to apply this framework in cases involving clear abuses, such as
a trial court's refusal to hear a properly filed emergency motion concerning
child welfare, effectively renders the mandamus remedy illusory. This is
especially problematic in family law cases where, as noted in the materials
submitted by the relator, temporary orders are not appealable, making
mandamus the only available vehicle for review.
In re K.S., NUMBER 13-21-00006-CV (Tex. App. Mar 04, 2021) emphasizes
that mandamus is "both an extraordinary remedy and a discretionary one"
and that determining the adequacy of an appellate remedy requires
"balancing the benefits of mandamus review against the detriments." This
balancing "depends heavily on circumstances" and "must be guided by
analysis of principles rather than simple rules that treat cases as
categories." When the Texas Supreme Court summarily denies mandamus
relief without explanation in cases involving fundamental rights and clear
procedural violations, it fails to engage in this principled analysis, leaving
litigants without recourse and lower courts without guidance.
Impact on Judicial Accountability
Judicial accountability is a cornerstone of our legal system. When the
highest civil court in the state fails to correct clear abuses of discretion by
lower courts, it creates an accountability vacuum. In the situation described
in the materials, multiple judges allegedly committed procedural violations,
yet no accountability mechanism was activated. This pattern suggests a
systemic failure rather than isolated errors.
The Texas Supreme Court's constitutional authority to issue writs of
mandamus is intended, in part, to ensure that lower courts operate within
their prescribed authority. Tex. Const. art. 5 § 3 explicitly grants the Court
power to "issue writs of mandamus, procedendo, certiorari and such other
writs, as may be necessary to enforce its jurisdiction." When the Court
declines to exercise this power in cases involving clear abuses, it effectively
abdicates its responsibility to maintain the integrity of the judicial system.
This abdication becomes even more concerning when considered in light of 
In re N.R.C., 94 S.W.3d 799's recognition that family law matters,
particularly those involving parental rights, implicate "fundamental
constitutional rights." The failure to intervene in cases where these

=== PAGE 34 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
fundamental rights are threatened by procedural irregularities suggests a
troubling hierarchy of rights, where constitutional protections in family law
contexts receive less rigorous enforcement than in other areas of law.
Erosion of Public Confidence in the Judiciary
Perhaps the most significant consequence of the Texas Supreme Court's
failure to address clear abuses of discretion is the erosion of public
confidence in the judiciary. When litigants perceive that procedural rules are
selectively enforced and that even clear violations go uncorrected by the
highest court, it undermines faith in the fairness and impartiality of the
judicial system as a whole.
This erosion of confidence is particularly acute for pro se litigants, who may
already face significant challenges in navigating the legal system. When a
pro se litigant who has correctly invoked legal procedures and cited relevant
authority sees their petitions summarily denied without explanation, while
procedural violations by courts go unaddressed, it creates the impression of
a system that privileges form over substance and institutional solidarity over
justice.
The situation described in the materials—where a litigant alleges that five
judges have committed procedural violations, real parties have failed to
respond, and the case has remained inactive beyond time standards—
suggests a breakdown in the fundamental promise that courts will provide a
fair and timely forum for the resolution of disputes. When even the court of
last resort appears unwilling to address such breakdowns, litigants may
reasonably conclude that the system itself is dysfunctional.
Special Considerations in Family Law Cases
Family law cases involve unique considerations that make the failure to
address abuses of discretion particularly problematic. In re H.P. highlights
the importance of procedural rights in family law cases, finding that a
district court's denial of a parent's timely request for a de novo hearing was
"error" that was "not harmless" because it prevented the parent from
properly presenting their case.
Similarly, the materials submitted by the relator suggest that emergency
matters regarding child welfare were not given proper consideration by the
trial court. Given the Texas Supreme Court's recognition in In re N.R.C., 94
S.W.3d 799 that parental rights are fundamental constitutional rights, the
failure to address clear procedural violations in this context is particularly
troubling.
Moreover, the nature of family law cases often means that harm caused by
procedural violations cannot be undone through later remedies. If a court
refuses to hear an emergency motion regarding child safety, and harm
comes to the child as a result, no subsequent appellate remedy can undo
that harm. This reality makes timely intervention through mandamus relief
especially important in family law contexts, and the failure to provide such
relief especially damaging.

The Resort to Federal Litigation
When state courts fail to provide adequate remedies for clear violations of
procedural and substantive rights, litigants may turn to federal courts for
relief. The mention in the materials that the relator "is now taking the
initiative and pursuing federal claims against the petitioner in the state
case" suggests that this is occurring in the present situation.
The resort to federal litigation represents a significant failure of the state
judicial system. State courts are generally presumed to be capable of
enforcing both state and federal constitutional rights, and the principle of
comity encourages federal courts to defer to state courts in matters of state
law. When litigants are forced to seek federal intervention because state
courts, including the state's highest court, have failed to address clear
abuses, it undermines this presumption and challenges the integrity of the
state judicial system.
Moreover, the necessity of federal litigation imposes additional costs and
delays on litigants who have already been denied timely justice in state
courts. This is particularly problematic in family law cases, where time is
often of the essence and delays may cause irreparable harm to parent-child
relationships.
Competing Considerations
While the failure to address clear abuses of discretion has serious
consequences, there are competing considerations that might influence the
Texas Supreme Court's approach to mandamus petitions.
First, the Court faces significant resource constraints and must be selective
in the cases it chooses to hear. Mandamus is described in In re K.S.,
NUMBER 13-21-00006-CV as "both an extraordinary remedy and a
discretionary one," suggesting that the Court has legitimate authority to
decline to hear certain mandamus petitions.
Second, there may be aspects of individual cases that make them poor
vehicles for addressing broader issues, even when those issues are
important. Without full access to the record and the Court's internal
deliberations, it is difficult to assess whether such considerations might have
influenced the decision to deny mandamus relief in the specific cases
mentioned in the materials.
Third, the Court may be concerned about opening floodgates to mandamus
petitions if it begins granting relief in cases involving procedural violations.
However, this concern must be balanced against the harm caused by
allowing clear abuses to go uncorrected, particularly in cases involving
fundamental rights.

Conclusion
The failure of the Texas Supreme Court to act on clear, repeated abuses of
discretion by lower courts in family law cases has significant legal and
ethical consequences. It undermines the mandamus remedy that exists
precisely to address such situations, erodes judicial accountability, damages
public confidence in the judiciary, and may cause irreparable harm in cases
involving fundamental rights and child welfare.
These consequences are particularly serious when cases have exceeded time
standards, real parties have offered no opposition, and litigants are forced to
seek federal remedies for violations of their rights in state courts. The resort
to federal litigation represents a significant failure of the state judicial
system and challenges the integrity of Texas's courts.
While there are competing considerations that might influence the Court's
approach to mandamus petitions, the fundamental promise of the legal
system is that there will be remedies for clear violations of rights and
procedures. When the court of last resort appears unwilling to provide such
remedies, even in cases involving fundamental constitutional rights, it calls
into question the system's ability to fulfill this promise.
The integrity of the judicial system depends not only on the correct
application of law in most cases, but on the availability of effective remedies
when errors occur. When those remedies fail, particularly in cases involving
the "capital punishment of civil law" (the termination or severe restriction of
parental rights), the damage extends beyond individual litigants to the
system as a whole. The perception that justice depends on representation
status, institutional connections, or procedural formalities rather than the
merits of claims undermines the very foundation of the rule of law.
While mandamus remains "an extraordinary remedy," the standard
articulated in In re Lee, 411 S.W.3d 445 and In re Villanueva, 292 S.W.3d
236 suggests that it should be available when lower courts clearly abuse
their discretion and no adequate appellate remedy exists. When the Texas
Supreme Court fails to provide this remedy in appropriate cases, it leaves a
gap in judicial accountability that threatens the integrity of the entire
system.

the trial court fails to vacate its order appointing the attorney ad litem and
ordering a social study.
Summary
Conditions under which mandamus relief is appropriate in Texas: a clear
abuse of discretion or violation of a legal duty, and the absence of an
adequate remedy by appeal. It emphasizes that a trial court's failure to
apply the law correctly constitutes an abuse of discretion. The passage also
highlights that when there is no authority for an interlocutory appeal and no
final order is expected, mandamus relief is the appropriate remedy. This is
relevant to the question as it provides a legal framework for addressing
judicial abuses of discretion when traditional appellate remedies are
unavailable.

Mandamus relief will lie if the relator establishes a clear abuse of discretion
for which there is no adequate appellate remedy. In re AutoNation, Inc., 228
S.W.3d 663, 667 (Tex.2007) (orig. proceeding). A trial court clearly abuses
its discretion if it reaches a decision so arbitrary and unreasonable as to
constitute a clear and prejudicial error of law. Walker v. Packer, 827 S.W.2d
833, 839 (Tex.1992) (orig. proceeding). Regarding factual issues, a trial
court abuses its discretion if it reasonably could only have reached one
decision.
Summary
Mandamus relief is appropriate when there is a clear abuse of discretion by
a trial court, and there is no adequate remedy by appeal. This is relevant to
the question as it highlights the legal recourse available when lower courts
fail to act appropriately. The failure of the Texas Supreme Court to act on
such abuses could undermine judicial accountability and public confidence,
as it suggests that there is no effective oversight or remedy for judicial
errors.

We hold that this order is in error. See In re R.A.O., 561 S.W.3d 704, 710
(Tex. App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2018, no pet.) (finding trial court's denial of
parent's timely request for de novo hearing under Chapter 201, subchapter
B was error). The district court's analysis overlooks the fact that Mother
challenged the associate judge's finding that termination of Mother's
parental rights would be in the child's best interest.
Summary
The passage highlights a legal error where a district court denied a parent's
request for a de novo hearing, which is a procedural right. This error was
not harmless as it prevented the parent from properly presenting her case
on appeal. The passage underscores the importance of adhering to
procedural rights to ensure fair judicial proceedings.

Mandamus is both an extraordinary remedy and a discretionary one. In re
Garza, 544 S.W.3d 836, 840 (Tex. 2018) (orig. proceeding) (per curiam). To
obtain relief by writ of mandamus, a relator must establish that an
underlying order is void or a clear abuse of discretion and that no adequate
appellate remedy exists. In re Nationwide Ins. Co. of Am., 494 S.W.3d 708,
712 (Tex. 2016) (orig. proceeding); In re Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., 148 S.W.

appellate remedy by balancing the benefits of mandamus review against the
detriments. In re Essex Ins. Co., 450 S.W.3d 524, 528 (Tex. 2014) (orig.

this balance depends heavily on circumstances, it must be guided by
analysis of principles rather than simple rules that treat cases as categories.

Summary
Mandamus is an extraordinary and discretionary remedy used to address
clear abuses of discretion when no adequate appellate remedy exists. The
adequacy of an appellate remedy is determined by balancing the benefits of
mandamus review against its detriments, guided by principles rather than

rigid rules. This suggests that when the Texas Supreme Court fails to act on
clear abuses of discretion, it may undermine the principles of justice and
accountability, as mandamus is intended to correct such abuses when other
remedies are inadequate.

Extract
Certainly, the trial court was aware of the gravity of the termination of
parental rights, as it paused to recognize such a proceeding as a 'very
severe thing' and dub it the 'death penalty of the parent-child relationship.'
See SAMPSON TINDALL, TEXAS FAMILY CODE ANNOTATED § 161,
Introductory Comment p. 757 (2001) (describing a termination of parental
rights as 'the capital punishment of civil law'). So weighty are the interests
at stake that the Texas Supreme Court has recognized that the involuntary
termination of parental rights implicates fundamental constitutional rights.

concurring).
Summary
The Texas Supreme Court recognizes the termination of parental rights as a
severe action, akin to the "capital punishment of civil law," implicating
fundamental constitutional rights. This recognition underscores the
importance of judicial accountability and the need for the courts to act
diligently and fairly in such cases. The failure of the Texas Supreme Court to
address clear abuses of discretion in family law cases, especially those
involving fundamental rights, can undermine public confidence in the
judicial system and compromise its integrity.

without prejudice to the right to a de novo hearing before the referring
court under Section FAMILY CODE 201.015 and subject to Subsection (c),
render and sign: (A) a final order agreed to in writing as to both form and
substance by all parties; (B) a final default order; (C) a temporary order; or
(D) a final order in a case in which a party files an unrevoked waiver made in
accordance with Rule 119, Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, that waives notice
to the party of the final hearing or waives the party's appearance at the final
hearing; ... A final order described by Subsection (a) becomes final after the
expiration of the period described by Section FAMILY CODE 201.015(a) if a

party does not request a de novo hearing in accordance with that section. An
order described by Subsection (a) or that is rendered and signed by an
associate judge constitutes an order of the referring court.
Summary
Associate judges in Texas have specific powers to render and sign orders,
but these powers are subject to certain conditions, such as the right to a de
novo hearing. If a party requests a de novo hearing, the associate judge's
order does not become final until the referring court adopts it. This
framework is designed to ensure judicial accountability and protect parties'
rights. If the Texas Supreme Court fails to act on abuses of discretion, it
undermines this framework, potentially leading to orders that are not legally
valid and eroding public confidence in the judicial system.

Summary
The Texas Supreme Court has the power to issue writs such as mandamus,
procedendo, and certiorari to enforce its jurisdiction. This means that the
Court has the authority to intervene in cases where there is a clear abuse of
discretion by lower courts. The failure to act on such abuses could
undermine judicial accountability, erode public confidence, and compromise
the integrity of the judicial system, as the Court is expected to ensure that
justice is served and that lower courts adhere to legal standards.
