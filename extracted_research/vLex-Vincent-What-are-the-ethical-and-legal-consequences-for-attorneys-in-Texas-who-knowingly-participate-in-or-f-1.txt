Question
What are the ethical and legal consequences for attorneys in Texas who
knowingly participate in or fail to report fraudulent conduct in family law
cases?
Answer (Texas)
Short response
Attorneys in Texas who knowingly participate in or fail to report fraudulent
conduct in family law cases face severe ethical and legal consequences,
including disciplinary sanctions such as suspension or disbarment, potential
criminal liability, and civil penalties. The Texas Disciplinary Rules of
Professional Conduct, state statutes, and case law collectively impose duties
to avoid, prevent, and report fraud, with violations leading to both
professional and legal repercussions.
Summary
Texas attorneys are bound by strict ethical and legal standards that prohibit
participation in, or concealment of, fraudulent conduct in family law
matters. The Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct require
lawyers to refrain from dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation, and
to take affirmative steps to prevent or rectify fraudulent acts, while state
statutes criminalize fraudulent activities and impose reporting obligations.
Failure to comply with these duties can result in disciplinary actions such as
suspension or disbarment, criminal prosecution for offenses like tampering
with governmental records or fraudulent document execution, and civil
liability. Attorneys may also lose the protection of attorney-client privilege if
their services are used to further a fraud, and may be required to report the
misconduct of other lawyers, with failure to do so itself constituting grounds
for discipline.
Background and Relevant Law
Legislative and Regulatory Framework
Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct (TDRPC):
Rule 8.04 defines professional misconduct to include engaging in
conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation, as
well as violating state laws relating to the professional conduct of
lawyers and the practice of law. It also prohibits lawyers from assisting
or inducing others to violate these rules or laws, and from engaging in
conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice, which encompasses
• 

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
fraudulent conduct in family law cases (Rule 8.04. Misconduct, Tex.
Disc. R. Prof. Cond. 8.04).
Rule 1.05 addresses confidentiality, but provides exceptions allowing
or requiring disclosure to prevent a client from committing a criminal
or fraudulent act, or to rectify the consequences of such acts if the
lawyer’s services were used in their commission. The rule also prohibits
lawyers from counseling or assisting a client in conduct that is criminal
or fraudulent (Rule 1.05. Confidentiality of Information, Tex. Disc. R.
Prof. Cond. 1.05).
Rule 8.03 imposes a duty on attorneys to report professional
misconduct by other lawyers to disciplinary authorities (Rule 8.03.
Reporting Professional Misconduct, Tex. Disc. R. Prof. Cond. 8.03).
Texas Government Code:
Section 81.072 and Section 81.078 establish the disciplinary
framework for attorneys, including investigation, suspension, and
disbarment for professional misconduct, especially for felonies
involving moral turpitude or misdemeanors involving theft,
embezzlement, or fraudulent misappropriation (Tex. Gov't. Code §
81.072; Tex. Gov't. Code § 81.078).
Section 402.033 requires any person, including attorneys, who
determines or reasonably suspects fraudulent activity, to report it to an
authorized governmental agency (Tex. Gov't. Code § 402.033).
Texas Penal Code:
Section 37.10 criminalizes tampering with governmental records,
including knowingly making false entries or using false documents with
intent to defraud or harm, which is particularly relevant in family law
cases involving court filings or evidence (Tex. Pen. Code § 37.10).
Section 32.46 criminalizes fraudulent securing of document execution,
such as causing someone to sign a document affecting property or
pecuniary interests without effective consent, with intent to defraud or
harm (Tex. Pen. Code § 32.46).
Section 36.05 addresses tampering with witnesses, making it a felony
to offer benefits or coerce a witness to influence testimony, with
enhanced penalties in family violence cases (Tex. Pen. Code § 36.05).
Texas Family Code:
Section 261.107 imposes criminal and civil penalties for knowingly
making false reports of child abuse or neglect, including state jail
felony charges, modification of custody orders, and liability for
attorney’s fees and civil penalties (Tex. Fam. Code § 261.107).
Case Law
Wilkinson v. Comm’n for Lawyer Discipline and Capps v. State
both confirm that attorneys found to have committed professional
misconduct, including fraud or dishonesty, may be subject to severe
disciplinary sanctions such as suspension or disbarment. These cases
•

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
also clarify that disciplinary actions are separate from, and can be
concurrent with, criminal prosecution for the same conduct (Wilkinson
v. Comm’n for Lawyer Discipline, NO. 09-17-00444-CV (Tex. App. Jul 25,
2019); Capps v. State, 265 S.W.3d 44 (Tex. App. 2008)).
Flume v. State Bar of Texas and Volcanic Gardens Management
Co., Inc. v. Paxson reinforce that attorneys are prohibited from
making false statements or engaging in fraudulent conduct, and may be
required to disclose confidential information to prevent or rectify fraud.
They also highlight the duty to avoid assisting clients in fraudulent acts
and the obligation to disclose material facts to avoid becoming
complicit (Flume v. State Bar of Texas, 974 S.W.2d 55 (Tex. App. 1998); 
Volcanic Gardens Management Co., Inc. v. Paxson, 847 S.W.2d 343 (Tex.
App. 1993)).
Comm’n for Law. Discipline v. Powell discusses the mental state
required for a violation of Rule 8.04(a)(3), suggesting that even conduct
not explicitly “knowing” or “intentional” may be subject to discipline if
it involves dishonesty or misrepresentation (Comm’n for Law. Discipline
v. Powell, 689 S.W.3d 620 (Tex. App. 2024)).
Guzder v. Haynes & Boone, LLP and Hawkins v. Horton clarify that
attorney-client privilege does not protect communications made for the
purpose of committing or planning a crime or fraud, and that attorneys
may be civilly liable for fraudulent acts outside the scope of
representation (Guzder v. Haynes & Boone, LLP, NO. 01-13-00985-CV
(Tex. App. May 28, 2015); Hawkins v. Horton).
Secondary Materials
The ABA Model Rules and commentary, while not binding in Texas, are
persuasive and closely mirrored by the TDRPC. They emphasize the
duty to avoid assisting in fraud, to be truthful in statements to others,
and to report professional misconduct (Trolling, Stonewalling, and
Sham Pleadings: How Far Is Too Far?-Handling Opposing Counsel's
Discovery Phase Ethics Violations; Chapter 2-V. COMMON
PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY CONCERNS).
Additional commentary confirms that attorneys must withdraw from
representation if it involves crime or fraud, inform clients of the limits
of their conduct, and ensure their services are not used to facilitate
fraud (BEHAVIORAL LEGAL ETHICS LESSONS FOR CORPORATE
COUNSEL.).
Analysis
Ethical Consequences
Participation in Fraudulent Conduct:
Attorneys who knowingly participate in fraudulent conduct in family law
cases violate multiple provisions of the TDRPC, most notably Rule 8.04,
which prohibits dishonesty, fraud, deceit, and misrepresentation. Such
conduct constitutes professional misconduct and subjects the attorney to
disciplinary proceedings, which may result in sanctions ranging from
reprimand to suspension or disbarment, depending on the severity and
•

circumstances (Wilkinson v. Comm’n for Lawyer Discipline, NO.
09-17-00444-CV (Tex. App. Jul 25, 2019); Capps v. State, 265 S.W.3d 44 (Tex.
App. 2008); Rule 8.04. Misconduct, Tex. Disc. R. Prof. Cond. 8.04).
Rule 1.05 further prohibits attorneys from assisting clients in criminal or
fraudulent conduct and allows, or in some cases requires, disclosure of
confidential information to prevent or rectify such acts. If an attorney’s
services are used to further a fraud, the attorney-client privilege may be
lost, exposing both the client and the attorney to further legal scrutiny (Rule
1.05. Confidentiality of Information, Tex. Disc. R. Prof. Cond. 1.05; Hawkins
v. Horton).
Failure to Report Fraudulent Conduct:
Attorneys also have an ethical obligation to report professional misconduct
by other lawyers, including fraudulent conduct, to disciplinary authorities
under Rule 8.03. Failure to report such misconduct can itself be grounds for
discipline, as the self-regulation of the legal profession depends on attorneys
upholding this duty (Rule 8.03. Reporting Professional Misconduct, Tex.
Disc. R. Prof. Cond. 8.03; Chapter 2-V. COMMON PROFESSIONAL
RESPONSIBILITY CONCERNS).
Moreover, Texas Government Code § 402.033 imposes a statutory duty on
any person, including attorneys, to report suspected fraudulent activity to an
authorized governmental agency. Noncompliance with this statutory duty
may expose the attorney to further disciplinary or legal action (Tex. Gov't.
Code § 402.033).
Use of Illegally Obtained Evidence:
Attorneys who use or disseminate evidence obtained in violation of law (such
as illegal recordings) may commit both a criminal offense and an ethical
violation under Rule 8.04, even if they were initially unaware of the
misconduct. This is particularly relevant in family law, where parties may
attempt to introduce surreptitiously obtained evidence (The Admissibility of
Illegally Obtained Evidence in Family Law Cases and Related Ethical Issues).
Legal Consequences
Criminal Liability:
Attorneys who engage in fraudulent conduct may be prosecuted under
various provisions of the Texas Penal Code:
Tampering with governmental records (e.g., filing false documents
in court) is a criminal offense, punishable as a misdemeanor or felony
depending on intent and harm caused (Tex. Pen. Code § 37.10).
Fraudulent securing of document execution (e.g., causing someone
to sign a document without effective consent, with intent to defraud) is
also a criminal offense (Tex. Pen. Code § 32.46).
Tampering with witnesses in family law cases, especially those
involving family violence, is a felony offense (Tex. Pen. Code § 36.05).
Making false reports of child abuse or neglect is a state jail felony,
with enhanced penalties for repeat offenders, and may also result in
• 
• 
• 
• 

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
modification of custody or access orders and civil penalties (Tex. Fam.
Code § 261.107).
Disciplinary Sanctions:
Upon conviction of a felony involving moral turpitude or a misdemeanor
involving theft, embezzlement, or fraudulent misappropriation, an attorney
must be suspended or disbarred under the Texas Government Code (Tex.
Gov't. Code § 81.078). Even absent a criminal conviction, disciplinary
authorities may impose sanctions for professional misconduct, as
established in the TDRPC and confirmed by case law (Wilkinson v. Comm’n
for Lawyer Discipline, NO. 09-17-00444-CV (Tex. App. Jul 25, 2019); Capps v.
State, 265 S.W.3d 44 (Tex. App. 2008)).
Civil Liability:
While violations of the TDRPC do not create a private cause of action or
establish civil liability per se (Fleming v. Kinney ex rel. Shelton, 395 S.W.3d
917 (Tex. App. 2013)), attorneys may still be civilly liable for fraudulent acts
outside the scope of their representation, such as conversion or fraud, as
recognized in Texas case law (Guzder v. Haynes & Boone, LLP, NO.
01-13-00985-CV (Tex. App. May 28, 2015)).
Loss of Attorney-Client Privilege:
If an attorney’s services are used to commit or plan a crime or fraud, the
crime-fraud exception to the attorney-client privilege applies, and
communications related to the fraudulent conduct are not protected
(Hawkins v. Horton; Rule 1.05. Confidentiality of Information, Tex. Disc. R.
Prof. Cond. 1.05).
Application to Family Law Cases
Family law cases are particularly susceptible to fraudulent conduct, such as
the submission of false evidence, perjury, or the making of false reports of
abuse or neglect. Attorneys who knowingly participate in such conduct, or
who fail to take appropriate steps to prevent or report it, are at risk of
violating both ethical and legal standards.
For example, an attorney who knowingly submits a false affidavit or
encourages a client to make a false report of child abuse may be subject to
criminal prosecution, disciplinary action, and civil penalties. Similarly, an
attorney who becomes aware of another lawyer’s fraudulent conduct in a
family law case and fails to report it may be disciplined for that omission.
Exceptions and Caveats
No Private Cause of Action for Rule Violations: Violations of the
TDRPC do not, by themselves, create a private right of action or
establish civil liability. Disciplinary rules are enforced by the State Bar
and disciplinary authorities, not by private litigants (Fleming v. Kinney
ex rel. Shelton, 395 S.W.3d 917 (Tex. App. 2013)).
Limits on Duty to Correct False Testimony: Texas does not require
attorneys to correct false deposition testimony by their clients, unlike
• 
• 

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
the ABA Model Rules, but attorneys must not use such testimony in
court or motions, and must correct the record if they themselves offer
false evidence (No Duty to Correct False Deposition Testimony, Says
State Bar).
Mental State for Discipline: There is some debate about whether
certain disciplinary rules require “knowing” or “intentional” conduct,
but even reckless or negligent dishonesty may be subject to discipline
(Comm’n for Law. Discipline v. Powell, 689 S.W.3d 620 (Tex. App.
2024)).
Conclusion
Attorneys in Texas who knowingly participate in or fail to report fraudulent
conduct in family law cases face significant ethical and legal consequences.
These include disciplinary sanctions such as suspension or disbarment,
criminal prosecution for offenses related to fraud, tampering, or false
reporting, and potential civil liability for fraudulent acts. The Texas
Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct, state statutes, and case law
collectively impose affirmative duties to avoid, prevent, and report fraud,
with violations leading to both professional and legal repercussions.
Attorneys must be vigilant in upholding these standards to maintain the
integrity of the legal profession and the administration of justice in family
law proceedings.

However, the protections afforded an attorney from liability arising out of
his representation of a client are not 'boundless.' See McCamish, Martin,
Brown & Loeffler v. Appling Interests, 991 S.W.2d 787, 794 (Tex. 1999). 'An
attorney who personally steals goods or tells lies on a client's behalf may be
liable for conversion or fraud in some cases.' Chu v. Hong, 249 S.W.3d 441,
446 & n.19 (Tex. 2008). Thus, a cause of action may exist against an
attorney who knowingly commits a fraudulent act outside the scope of his
legal representation of his client. See Alpert, 178 S.W.3d at 406.
Summary
While attorneys in Texas generally have qualified immunity for actions taken
in the course of representing their clients, this immunity is not without
limits. Specifically, if an attorney knowingly commits a fraudulent act outside
the scope of their legal representation, they may be liable for fraud or
conversion. This suggests that attorneys who knowingly participate in
•

fraudulent conduct may face legal consequences, such as being liable for
fraud, even if such conduct is related to their representation of a client.
Volcanic Gardens Management Co., Inc. v. Paxson, 847 S.W.2d 343 (Tex. App.

Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Under the Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct of the Rules of
the State Bar of Texas, a lawyer may, and in some cases must, reveal
confidential information of a client '[w]hen the lawyer has reason to believe
it is necessary to do so in order to prevent the client from committing a
criminal or fraudulent act.' Tex.Disciplinary R.Prof.Conduct 1.05(c)(7)
(1989), reprinted in Tex.Gov't Code Ann., tit. 2, subtit. G app. (Vernon Supp.
1993) (State Bar Rules art. X, § 9). Furthermore, a lawyer is prohibited from
making a false statement of material fact or law to the court or to a third
party and is required to disclose a material fact to the court or a third party
'when disclosure is necessary to avoid making the lawyer a party to a
criminal act or knowingly assisting a fraudulent act perpetrated by a client.'
Summary
Ethical obligations of attorneys in Texas under the Texas Disciplinary Rules
of Professional Conduct. Specifically, it highlights that attorneys may be
required to disclose confidential client information to prevent criminal or
fraudulent acts and are prohibited from making false statements or assisting
in fraudulent acts. This is directly relevant to the question as it addresses
the ethical responsibilities and potential consequences for attorneys
involved in fraudulent conduct.
Flume v. State Bar of Texas, 974 S.W.2d 55 (Tex. App. 1998)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The State Bar of Texas brought a disciplinary proceeding against appellant,
Eileen D. Flume, for her actions in obtaining and enforcing a temporary
restraining order (TRO) for a client. A jury found that Flume violated
disciplinary rules 4.01(a) and 8.04(a)(3) and the district court imposed
sanctions, including a probated public reprimand... 'In the course of
representing a client a lawyer shall not knowingly: (a) make a false
statement of material fact or law to a third person.' SUPREME COURT OF
TEXAS, STATE BAR RULES, art. X, § 9, TEX. DISCIPLINARY R. OF PROF.

involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.' TEX.
DISCIPLINARY R. OF PROF. CONDUCT T 8.04(a)(3).
Summary
Attorneys in Texas are subject to disciplinary actions if they engage in
fraudulent conduct or fail to report such conduct. The specific rules
mentioned, 4.01(a) and 8.04(a)(3), prohibit making false statements of
material fact or law and engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud,
deceit, or misrepresentation. The consequences for violating these rules can
include sanctions such as reprimands, suspension, or disbarment, depending
on the severity of the misconduct.
Capps v. State, 265 S.W.3d 44 (Tex. App. 2008)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
On August 2, 2005, the civil district court granted the Commission's
summary judgment motion, ruling that appellant committed professional
misconduct by violating disciplinary rules 1.04(d), 1.08(a), 1.14(a), 1.14(b),
1.14(c), and 8.04(a)(8)... Having found that appellant committed professional
misconduct, the court determined that 'the proper discipline ... for each act
of professional misconduct' was disbarment... The Texas Rules of
Disciplinary Procedure also specifically contemplate that an attorney who is
subject to disciplinary actions under the Texas Disciplinary Rules of
Professional Conduct may also be subjected to criminal prosecution for the
same conduct... A disciplinary action is filed neither by the State nor a
private litigant, but rather by the Commission... In accord with the Texas
Rules of Disciplinary Procedure, the Government Code makes clear that
attorneys may be subject to criminal prosecution and disciplinary action for
the same conduct.
Summary
The passage outlines that attorneys in Texas who commit professional
misconduct, which can include participating in or failing to report fraudulent
conduct, may face disciplinary actions such as disbarment. Additionally, they
may also be subject to criminal prosecution for the same conduct. The
disciplinary actions are civil in nature and are brought by the Commission
for Lawyer Discipline, not by private litigants or the state.

Likewise, there is no evidence to support an 8.04(a)(3) violation. DR 8.04(a)
(3) provides that 'A lawyer shall not engage in conduct involving dishonesty,
fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation.' Tex. Disciplinary Rules of Professional
Conduct R. 8.04(a)(3). In the court below, the Bar argued that 8.04(a)(3)
does not require that an attorney act 'knowingly.' On appeal, the Bar argues
that Powell’s reliance on the absence if intentional conduct supporting an
8.04(a)(3) violation is misplaced because the rule does not expressly
mention intent. The Bar does not explain whether it views 'knowing' and
'intentional' as synonymous, not does it identify the mental state it contends
8.04(a)(3) requires or how the summary judgment evidence establishes an
8.04(a)(3) violation.
Summary
Rule 8.04(a)(3) of the Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct
prohibits attorneys from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud,
deceit, or misrepresentation. The passage highlights a debate about whether
this rule requires the conduct to be "knowing" or "intentional," indicating
that the rule does not explicitly require intent. This suggests that attorneys
could face disciplinary action for fraudulent conduct even if they did not act
with intent, as long as their actions involved dishonesty or
misrepresentation.

This testimony is unreliable because it contravenes Texas law. 'Violation of a
rule does not give rise to a private cause of action nor does it create any
presumption that a legal duty to a client has been breached.' Tex.
Disciplinary Rules Prof 1 Conduct preamble ¶ 15 (emphasis added). 'The fact
that a rule is a just basis for a lawyer's self-assessment, or for sanctioning a
lawyer under the administration of a disciplinary authority, does not imply
that an antagonist in a collateral proceeding or transaction has standing to
seek enforcement of the rule.' Id. 'Accordingly, nothing in the rules should
be deemed to augment any substantive legal duty of lawyers or the extra-
disciplinary consequences of violating such a duty.' Id.; see also Joe v. Two
Thirty Nine Joint Venture, 145 S.W.3d 150, 158 n. 2 (Tex.2004) ('[W]e note
that the Rules do not define standards of civil liability of lawyers for
professional conduct.'); Greenberg Traurig, 161 S.W.3d at 96–97 (trial court
erred in allowing expert witness to testify that 'the standard of care for
attorneys is based on the Texas disciplinary rules when no such liability can
be based on any violations of those rules').

Summary
While the Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct provide a basis
for self-assessment and potential disciplinary action by a disciplinary
authority, they do not create a private cause of action or establish civil
liability for attorneys. This means that violations of these rules do not
automatically result in legal consequences such as civil liability, but they can
lead to disciplinary actions by the relevant authorities.
Lane v. Comm’n for Lawyer Discipline 715 S.W.3d 349

Extract
The Rules first define “Professional Misconduct” as “[a]cts or omissions by
an attorney, individually or in concert with another person or persons, that
violate one or more of the Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct.”
Tex. Rules Disciplinary P. R. 1.06(CC)(l). This definition encompasses the
conduct for which the CLD initiates standard disciplinary proceedings.
Summary
Such misconduct would initiate standard disciplinary proceedings by the

Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The trial court incorporated its partial summary judgment into the final
judgment. In its final judgment, the trial court found that Wilkinson
committed professional misconduct and that she violated Rule 8.04(a)(2), (3)
and (7) of the Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct and that the
imposed disbarment is an appropriate sanction for Wilkinson's professional
misconduct.
Summary
The Texas Court of Appeals found Wilkinson guilty of professional
misconduct for violating specific rules of the Texas Disciplinary Rules of
Professional Conduct. The court imposed disbarment as a sanction,
demonstrating the severe consequences for attorneys who engage in
misconduct. This case illustrates that attorneys in Texas who knowingly

participate in or fail to report fraudulent conduct can face significant
disciplinary actions, including disbarment.

Summary
Attorney-client privilege under Texas Rule of Evidence 503(b)(1) and its
exception under Rule 503(d)(1) for crime or fraud. This indicates that if an
attorney's services are used to commit or plan a crime or fraud, the privilege
does not apply. This is relevant to the question as it highlights a legal
consequence for attorneys involved in fraudulent conduct: the potential loss
of attorney-client privilege.
Tex. Pen. Code § 37.10 Tex. Pen. Code § 37.10 Tampering With
Governmental Record
Extract
A person commits an offense if he: knowingly makes a false entry in, or false
alteration of, a governmental record; makes, presents, or uses any record,
document, or thing with knowledge of its falsity and with intent that it be
taken as a genuine governmental record; ... An offense under this section is
a Class A misdemeanor unless the actor's intent is to defraud or harm
another, in which event the offense is a state jail felony.
Summary
Attorneys in Texas who knowingly participate in fraudulent conduct
involving governmental records, such as those that might be used in family
law cases, could face legal consequences under Tex. Pen. Code § 37.10. This
includes making false entries or using documents with knowledge of their

=== PAGE 12 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
falsity. The offense is generally a Class A misdemeanor but can escalate to a
state jail felony if the intent is to defraud or harm another. This statute
provides a legal framework for addressing fraudulent conduct involving
governmental records, which could be relevant in family law cases.
Tex. Pen. Code § 32.46 Tex. Pen. Code § 32.46 Fraudulent Securing of
Document Execution
Extract
A person commits an offense if the person, with the intent to defraud or
harm any person: causes another person, without that person's effective
consent, to sign or execute any document affecting property or service or
the pecuniary interest of any person; or causes a public servant, without the
public servant's effective consent, to file or record any purported judgment
or other document purporting to memorialize or evidence an act, an order, a
directive, or process of: (A) a purported court that is not expressly created
or established under the constitution or the laws of this state or of the
United States; (B) a purported judicial entity that is not expressly created or
established under the constitution or laws of this state or of the United
States; or (C) a purported judicial officer of a purported court or purported
judicial entity described by Paragraph (A) or (B).
Summary
This statute criminalizes the act of causing another person to sign or
execute a document without effective consent, with the intent to defraud or
harm. This is relevant to attorneys who might engage in or fail to report
such fraudulent conduct in family law cases, as they could be held criminally
liable under this statute.

Summary
Procedures and standards for disciplining attorneys in Texas, which are
established by the supreme court. It mentions the classification and
investigation of grievances, the possibility of trials and appeals, and interim
suspension for attorneys posing a threat. It also states that attorneys are
subject to the Texas Rules of Disciplinary Procedure and the Texas
Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct. These procedures and rules
would apply to attorneys involved in fraudulent conduct in family law cases,
as they are part of the general disciplinary framework for attorneys in Texas.

Penalty; Civil Penalty
Extract
(a) A person commits an offense if, with the intent to deceive, the person
knowingly makes a report as provided in this chapter that is false. An
offense under this subsection is a state jail felony unless it is shown on the
trial of the offense that the person has previously been convicted under this
section, in which case the offense is a felony of the third degree. (b) A
finding by a court in a suit affecting the parent-child relationship that a
report made under this chapter before or during the suit was false or
lacking factual foundation may be grounds for the court to modify an order
providing for possession of or access to the child who was the subject of the
report by restricting further access to the child by the person who made the
report. (c) The appropriate county prosecuting attorney shall be responsible
for the prosecution of an offense under this section. (d) The court shall order
a person who is convicted of an offense under Subsection (a) to pay any
reasonable and necessary attorney's fees, court costs, and expenses
incurred by the person who was falsely accused of abuse or neglect in any
proceeding relating to the false report. (e) A person who engages in conduct
described by Subsection (a) is liable to the state for a civil penalty of $1,000.
The attorney general shall bring an action to recover a civil penalty
authorized by this subsection.
Summary
Legal consequences for individuals, including attorneys, who knowingly
make false reports in family law cases involving child abuse or neglect. Such
conduct is classified as a state jail felony, escalating to a third-degree felony
for repeat offenders. Additionally, the court may modify custody or access
orders based on false reports, and convicted individuals are liable for
attorney's fees and a civil penalty. While the passage does not explicitly

the third degree or the most serious offense charged in the criminal case.
This indicates legal consequences for attorneys who might engage in such
conduct.

duty to communicate Gavin's misconduct to his clients, but Rule 8.3(a)
obviously plays a critical role in the self-regulation of the legal profession
because of the duty it imposes on lawyers to report other lawyers'
misconduct to professional authorities in appropriate circumstances. Indeed,
lawyers who fail to report some types of misdeeds by other lawyers to
professional authorities may be disciplined for those lapses.
Summary
Rule 8.3(a) imposes a duty on lawyers to report misconduct by other lawyers
to professional authorities. This duty is crucial for the self-regulation of the
legal profession. Failure to report such misconduct can result in disciplinary
action against the lawyer who fails to report. This is relevant to the question

No Duty to Correct False Deposition Testimony, Says State Bar
Litigation News - American Bar Association - William H. Newman -

Extract
The committee considered at length whether these facts violated Rule
3.03(a)(2), which prohibits assisting a criminal or fraudulent act. It noted
that there has been a difference of opinion on the subject by other eth... The
committee also acknowledged that ABA Model Rule of Professional Conduct
3.3(b) specifically requires attorneys to correct their clients’ false
statements. But it observed that the Texas Disciplinary Rules do not have the
same requirement, and it did not read that requirement into those rules. The
committee emphasized that the attorney was obligated to refrain from using
the false testimony in a motion or at trial. It also made clear that the
attorney was obligated to correct the record if the testimony arose on direct
examination because that would constitute the attorney’s own offering of
false evidence.
Summary
The Texas Disciplinary Rules do not require attorneys to correct false
statements made by their clients during depositions, unlike the ABA Model
Rule of Professional Conduct 3.3(b). However, attorneys are prohibited from
using false testimony in motions or at trial. If false testimony arises on direct
examination, the attorney must correct the record, as it would be considered
the attorney's own offering of false evidence. This indicates that while there
is no explicit duty to correct false deposition testimony, there are ethical
obligations to avoid using such testimony in legal proceedings.

Extract
It might be surprising to learn that both federal law and the laws of at least
a few states make it a criminal offense for a person to “use” or
“disseminate” evidence obtained in violation of statutes prohibiting unlawful
recordings and unlawful interception of electronic communications.
Accordingly, a lawyer who knew nothing about a client’s intended
misconduct in this regard could very easily commit a criminal offense, and

an ethical violation under Rule 8.4, simply by accepting and using the
evidence their client illegally obtained.
Summary
The passage highlights that attorneys in Texas (and other jurisdictions)
could face criminal charges and ethical violations if they use or disseminate
evidence obtained illegally, even if they were unaware of the misconduct
initially. This underscores the importance of attorneys being vigilant about
the source of evidence and adhering to ethical standards, such as those
outlined in Rule 8.4.

are not used to facilitate a fraud. (35)
Summary
Potential criminal and civil liabilities for attorneys who participate in client
crimes or fraud. It also highlights the ethical obligations under professional
conduct rules, which require attorneys to withdraw from representation if it
involves crime or fraud, to inform the client of the limits of the attorney's
conduct, and to ensure that their services are not used to facilitate fraud.
These principles are generally applicable to attorneys, including those
practicing family law in Texas.

Rule 3.5 on impartiality and decorum prohibits 'conduct intended to disrupt
the tribunal' (ABA, 2020). Rule 3.1 prohibits frivolous or abusive use of
procedure. There are a lot of opportunities for mischief when attorneys are
doing their jobs. Courtroom antics intended to embarrass, delay or burden a
third person with no substantial purpose fail to demonstrate a good faith
basis in knowledge of the case, case law or statutes violates this rule. Rule
8.2 prohibits misleading people in the course of our jobs statements that you
know, to be false or statements that display a reckless disregard for the
truth. Rule 8.4 prohibits conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of
justice, which is a catchall category and can be applied to various instances
of bad conduct.
Summary
The passage outlines several rules from the American Bar Association (ABA)
that are relevant to attorney conduct. Rule 3.5 addresses conduct that
disrupts the tribunal, Rule 3.1 addresses frivolous or abusive use of
procedure, Rule 8.2 addresses making false or misleading statements, and
Rule 8.4 addresses conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice.

lawyers and to the practice of law.
Summary
The passage from Rule 8.04 of the Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional
Conduct indicates that lawyers in Texas are subject to discipline if they
violate any laws related to professional conduct and the practice of law. This
would include participating in or failing to report fraudulent conduct in
family law cases, as such actions would likely violate laws and ethical
standards governing attorneys. The rule is part of a broader framework that
ensures lawyers maintain integrity and adhere to legal and ethical
standards.

A report to a disciplinary authority of professional misconduct by a lawyer
should be made and processed in accordance with the Texas Rules of
Disciplinary Procedure.
Summary
Attorneys in Texas have an obligation to report professional misconduct to a
disciplinary authority. This is relevant to the question as it implies that
failing to report fraudulent conduct, which is a form of professional
misconduct, could itself be a violation of the ethical rules governing
attorneys in Texas. The passage does not specify the consequences but
highlights the duty to report.
Rule 1.05. Confidentiality of Information
Extract
When the lawyer has reason to believe it is necessary to do so in order to
prevent the client from committing a criminal or fraudulent act. To the
extent revelation reasonably appears necessary to rectify the consequences
of a client&#39;s criminal or fraudulent act in the commission of which the
lawyer&#39;s services had been used... The principle of confidentiality is
given effect not only in the Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct
but also in the law of evidence regarding the attorney-client privilege and in
the law of agency... Exceptions exist in evidence law where the services of
the lawyer were sought or used by a client in planning or committing a
crime or fraud... Rule 5.03(d) Texas Rules of Civil Evidence (Tex. R. Civ.
Evid.), and Rule 5.03(d), Texas Rules of Criminal Evidence (Tex R. Crim.
Evid.), indicate the underlying public policy of furnishing no protection to
client information where the client seeks or uses the services of the lawyer
to aid in the commission of a crime or fraud... The lawyer may not counsel or
assist a client in conduct that is criminal or fraudulent. See Rule 1.02(c)... A
lawyer&#39;s duty under Rule 3.03(a) not to use false or fabricated
evidence is a special instance of the duty prescribed in Rule 1.02(c) to avoid
assisting a client in criminal or fraudulent conduct... The lawyer may have
been innocently involved in past conduct by the client that was criminal or
fraudulent... Sub-paragraph (c) and give the lawyer professional discretion
to reveal both unprivileged and privileged information in order to serve
those interests.
Summary
The Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct outline the ethical
obligations of attorneys regarding confidentiality and the reporting of
fraudulent conduct. Attorneys are prohibited from assisting clients in
criminal or fraudulent acts and have a duty to prevent such acts if they have
reason to believe they are occurring. The rules provide exceptions to

=== PAGE 22 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
confidentiality when a lawyer's services are used in the commission of a
crime or fraud, allowing the lawyer to disclose information to prevent or
rectify the consequences of such conduct. This indicates that attorneys who
knowingly participate in or fail to report fraudulent conduct may face ethical
consequences, including potential disciplinary action, for violating these
rules.
