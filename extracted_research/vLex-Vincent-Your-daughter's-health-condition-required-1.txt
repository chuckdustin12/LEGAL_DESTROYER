Question
Your daughter's health condition required immediate medical attention that was not provided. Courts can intervene in family matters to protect the welfare of a
child when there is evidence of neglect or abuse. The materialization of medical neglect could justify a renewed request for court intervention to protect your
daughter's welfare.
Answer (Texas)
Short response
Texas courts can intervene in family matters to protect a child's welfare when there is evidence of medical neglect. When a child's health condition requires
immediate medical attention that is not provided, this constitutes medical neglect under Texas law and can justify court intervention to protect the child.
Summary
Under Texas law, medical neglect is specifically defined as the failure to seek, obtain, or follow through with medical care for a child when such failure results in or
presents an immediate danger to the child's physical health or safety. The Texas Family Code and Administrative Code provide a comprehensive framework that
enables courts to intervene in family matters to protect children from neglect, including medical neglect. This framework allows governmental entities to file suits
for temporary possession of a child without prior notice when there is evidence of immediate danger to the child's health due to neglect.
Courts in Texas have consistently held that the failure to provide appropriate medical care constitutes endangering conduct that can justify court intervention.
When a child's health condition requires immediate medical attention that is not provided, this meets the statutory definition of neglect and can serve as grounds
for court actions ranging from protective orders to temporary custody or even termination of parental rights in severe cases. The law prioritizes the child's best
interest as the primary consideration in all decisions affecting the parent-child relationship, including those involving medical neglect.
Background and Relevant Law
Legislative and Regulatory Framework
Texas law provides a comprehensive framework for addressing medical neglect and court intervention to protect children. This framework is primarily established
in the Texas Family Code and Texas Administrative Code.
Definition of Medical Neglect
Texas law specifically defines medical neglect as a subset of neglect. According to 40 Tex. Admin. Code § 707.469, medical neglect involves "failing to seek,
obtain, or follow through with medical care for a child, with the failure resulting in or presenting an immediate danger of death, disfigurement, or bodily injury or
with the failure resulting in an observable and material impairment to the growth, development, or functioning of the child."
This definition is echoed in Tex. Fam. Code § 261.001, which defines neglect to include "failing to seek, obtain, or follow through with medical care for a child,
with the failure resulting in or presenting an immediate danger of death, disfigurement, or bodily injury or with the failure resulting in an observable and material
impairment to the growth, development, or functioning of the child."
Similarly, 25 Tex. Admin. Code § 1.204 defines neglect of a child to include "the failure to seek, obtain, or follow through with medical care for the child, with the
failure resulting in or presenting a substantial risk of death, disfigurement, or bodily injury or with the failure resulting in an observable and material impairment to
the growth, development, or functioning of the child."
Court Intervention in Cases of Medical Neglect
Texas law establishes clear pathways for court intervention when there is evidence of medical neglect. Tex. Fam. Code § 262.101 allows a governmental entity to
file a suit requesting permission to take possession of a child without prior notice and a hearing when there is "an immediate danger to the physical health or
safety of the child or the child has been a victim of neglect."
Similarly, Tex. Fam. Code § 262.102 authorizes courts to issue a temporary order for the conservatorship of a child without prior notice and a hearing when "there
is an immediate danger to the physical health or safety of the child or the child has been a victim of neglect" and "continuation in the home would be contrary to
the child's welfare."
For less severe situations, Tex. Fam. Code § 262.404 allows the department to file a suit requesting the court to order a parent or guardian to participate in family
preservation services to "alleviate the effects of the abuse or neglect that has occurred," "reduce a continuing danger to the physical health or safety of the child,"
or "reduce a substantial risk of abuse or neglect."
Tex. Fam. Code § 261.504 further provides that courts may issue protective orders when there are "reasonable grounds to believe that the child is a victim of
abuse or neglect" or "there is a threat of immediate or continued abuse or neglect to the child."
Assessing Risk and Safety
40 Tex. Admin. Code § 707.501 requires an assessment of "both the immediate safety of the children in the home and the risk of recurrence of abuse or neglect"
during an investigation. It specifies that a child may be removed if "there is a high or very high likelihood that abuse or neglect will reoccur in the foreseeable
future or the child is not safe in the home because of unmanaged danger indicators."
Mandatory Reporting

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Tex. Fam. Code § 261.101 mandates that "a person having reasonable cause to believe that a child's physical or mental health or welfare has been adversely
affected by abuse or neglect by any person shall immediately make a report as provided by this subchapter." This reporting requirement is a trigger for potential
investigation and court intervention.
Case Law
Texas courts have consistently upheld the principle that medical neglect justifies court intervention to protect a child's welfare.
Medical Neglect as Endangering Conduct
In D.H. v. Tex. Dep't of Family & Protective Servs., 652 S.W.3d 54 (Tex. App. 2021), the court stated explicitly that "The failure to provide or obtain appropriate
medical care for a child can constitute endangering conduct under subsection (E)." This establishes that medical neglect is legally recognized as conduct that
endangers a child's well-being.
Similarly, in In re A.A.H., NO. 01-19-00612-CV, NO. 01-19-00748-CV (Tex. App. Mar 05, 2020), the court held that "neglect of a child's medical needs endangers
the child" and "A parent's failure to provide appropriate medical care for a child may constitute endangering conduct."
In In re J.C., 12-24-00113-CV (Tex. App. Jul 31, 2024), the court reiterated that "the failure to provide or obtain appropriate medical care for a child can constitute
endangering conduct." This recent case confirms that the principle remains valid in current Texas jurisprudence.
Grounds for Court Intervention
Courts have established that evidence of neglect, including medical neglect, provides grounds for court intervention. In In re S.R.W., 04-22-00648-CV (Tex. App.
Mar 08, 2023), the court stated that "Children's basic needs include medical care" and noted that "the trier of fact may consider evidence that a parent neglected
to seek appropriate medical treatment for the child" when deciding whether termination of parental rights is in the best interest of a child.
In In re Dustin Estep, the court established that "For a nonparent to overcome the presumption that it is in the child's best interest to be in a parent's custody,
there must be evidence of specific and identifiable conduct by the parent that is likely to cause harm to the child's physical health or emotional development."
Medical neglect constitutes such specific and identifiable conduct.
The case of In re K.S., No. 02-18-00191-CV (Tex. App. Sep 28, 2018) established that "A child is endangered when the environment creates a potential for
danger that the parent is aware of but consciously disregards." This principle applies to situations where a parent is aware of a child's medical needs but fails to
address them.
Legal Standards for Intervention
The legal standards for court intervention in cases of medical neglect have been clearly established by the courts. In In re W.T., 04-24-00164-CV (Tex. App. Aug
28, 2024), the court explained that a parent's rights may be terminated if the parent "knowingly placed or knowingly allowed the child to remain in conditions or
surroundings which endanger the physical or emotional well-being of the child." The court defined "endanger" as "to expose to loss or injury; to jeopardize."
In In re Interest of O.E.R., 573 S.W.3d 896 (Tex. App. 2019), the court stated that "A child is endangered when the environment creates a potential for danger
that the parent is aware of but disregards." This establishes that awareness of a danger, such as a medical condition requiring attention, coupled with disregard of
that danger constitutes endangerment.
In In re Interest of K-A.B.M., 551 S.W.3d 275 (Tex. App. 2018), the court explained that "the relevant inquiry is whether evidence exists that the endangerment of
the child's physical well-being was the direct result of the parent's conduct, including acts, omissions, or failures to act." This means that a parent's failure to act,
such as not seeking medical attention for a child when needed, can constitute endangerment.
It's important to note that In re J.F.C., 96 S.W.3d 256 (Tex. 2002) was overruled by A.S. v. Tex. Dep't of Family & Protective Servs., 394 S.W.3d 703 (Tex. App.
2012). However, the overruling did not affect the court's statement that "the 'best interest of the child' is the state's foremost priority in determining the welfare of
children." This principle remains valid and continues to guide courts in cases involving potential medical neglect.
Similarly, In re C.H., 89 S.W.3d 17 (Tex. 2002) was overruled by In re Interest of E.N., No. 07-16-00190-CV (Tex. App. Aug 22, 2016), but the principle that courts
may order termination of the parent-child relationship if there is clear and convincing evidence that the parent has engaged in certain conduct and termination is in
the best interest of the child remains valid under the Texas Family Code.
Higgins v. Dallas County Child Welfare Unit, 544 S.W.2d 745 (Tex. Ct. App. 1976) was overruled by S.H.A., In Interest of, 728 S.W.2d 73 (Tex. App. 1987), but its
recognition that circumstantial evidence may be sufficient to establish child abuse or neglect remains a valid principle in Texas law.
Analysis
Medical Neglect as Grounds for Court Intervention
The legislative and regulatory framework in Texas clearly establishes that the failure to provide necessary medical care for a child constitutes neglect. 40 Tex.
Admin. Code § 707.469 specifically defines medical neglect as "failing to seek, obtain, or follow through with medical care for a child" when such failure results in
or presents an immediate danger to the child's health or safety. When a child's health condition requires immediate medical attention that is not provided, this
directly meets the statutory definition of medical neglect.
Texas case law consistently supports the proposition that medical neglect justifies court intervention. In D.H. v. Tex. Dep't of Family & Protective Servs., 652
S.W.3d 54 (Tex. App. 2021), the court explicitly stated that "The failure to provide or obtain appropriate medical care for a child can constitute endangering
conduct." Similarly, In re A.A.H., NO. 01-19-00612-CV, NO. 01-19-00748-CV (Tex. App. Mar 05, 2020) held that "neglect of a child's medical needs endangers
the child."

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
The requirement that medical neglect must result in or present an immediate danger to the child's health or safety establishes a clear threshold for court
intervention. If a child's health condition required immediate medical attention that was not provided, and this failure resulted in or presented an immediate danger
to the child's health, the legal criteria for medical neglect would be met.
The Legal Pathway for Court Intervention
When medical neglect is established, Texas law provides multiple pathways for court intervention to protect the welfare of a child.
Emergency Removal
In the most severe cases, Tex. Fam. Code § 262.101 allows for the filing of a petition to take possession of a child without prior notice when there is "an
immediate danger to the physical health or safety of the child or the child has been a victim of neglect." Similarly, Tex. Fam. Code § 262.102 authorizes courts to
issue a temporary order for the conservatorship of a child without prior notice when such conditions exist.
These provisions apply when a child's health condition requires immediate medical attention that is not provided, and this failure creates an immediate danger to
the child's physical health or safety. The statutes require that "there is no time, consistent with the physical health or safety of the child" for a full hearing,
reflecting the emergency nature of the situation.
Protective Orders
For less severe cases, Tex. Fam. Code § 261.504 allows courts to issue protective orders when there are "reasonable grounds to believe that the child is a victim
of abuse or neglect" or "there is a threat of immediate or continued abuse or neglect to the child." A protective order could, for example, require a parent to seek
medical attention for a child with a condition requiring immediate care.
Family Preservation Services
Tex. Fam. Code § 262.404 provides another intervention option, allowing the department to file a suit requesting the court to order a parent to participate in family
preservation services. This approach might be appropriate in cases where education about a child's medical needs could prevent future instances of medical
neglect.
The Evidentiary Standard for Medical Neglect
To justify court intervention based on medical neglect, there must be sufficient evidence that the neglect has occurred or is likely to occur without intervention.
In re Interest of O.E.R., 573 S.W.3d 896 (Tex. App. 2019) established that "A child is endangered when the environment creates a potential for danger that the
parent is aware of but disregards." This means that evidence of a parent's awareness of a child's medical needs, coupled with a disregard for those needs, can
establish endangerment.
In re Interest of K-A.B.M., 551 S.W.3d 275 (Tex. App. 2018) clarified that "the relevant inquiry is whether evidence exists that the endangerment of the child's
physical well-being was the direct result of the parent's conduct, including acts, omissions, or failures to act." This means that a parent's failure to act, such as not
seeking medical attention when needed, can constitute endangerment if it directly results in risk to the child's well-being.
Even without direct evidence, Higgins v. Dallas County Child Welfare Unit, 544 S.W.2d 745 (Tex. Ct. App. 1976) established that circumstantial evidence may be
sufficient to establish child neglect. While this case was overruled by S.H.A., In Interest of, 728 S.W.2d 73 (Tex. App. 1987), the principle that circumstantial
evidence can establish neglect remains valid in Texas law.
The "Best Interest of the Child" Standard
In all cases involving potential court intervention due to medical neglect, the child's best interest is the paramount consideration.
In re J.F.C., 96 S.W.3d 256 (Tex. 2002) emphasized that "the 'best interest of the child' is the state's foremost priority in determining the welfare of children."
While this case was overruled by A.S. v. Tex. Dep't of Family & Protective Servs., 394 S.W.3d 703 (Tex. App. 2012), the principle that the child's best interest is
paramount remains valid under the Texas Family Code.
In re C.H., 89 S.W.3d 17 (Tex. 2002) noted that courts may terminate parental rights if there is clear and convincing evidence that termination is in the best
interest of the child. While this case was overruled by In re Interest of E.N., No. 07-16-00190-CV (Tex. App. Aug 22, 2016), the "best interest of the child"
standard remains codified in the Texas Family Code.
Renewed Request for Court Intervention
When there is evidence of medical neglect, this can justify a renewed request for court intervention to protect a child's welfare, even if previous interventions were
unsuccessful or not pursued. The materialization of medical neglect—that is, the actual occurrence of a situation where a child's health condition required
immediate medical attention that was not provided—creates new grounds for court intervention.
Tex. Fam. Code § 261.301 requires the department to make "a prompt and thorough investigation of a report of child abuse or neglect" with "the primary purpose
of the investigation" being "the protection of the child." This investigation can lead to court intervention if neglect is substantiated.
40 Tex. Admin. Code § 707.501 specifies that a child may be removed from a home if "there is a high or very high likelihood that abuse or neglect will reoccur in
the foreseeable future or the child is not safe in the home because of unmanaged danger indicators." Evidence of past medical neglect can establish such a
likelihood.
Exceptions and Caveats

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Parental Rights and Limitations on Court Intervention
While Texas law provides clear pathways for court intervention in cases of medical neglect, it also recognizes the rights of parents and establishes limitations on
such intervention.
In re J.F.C., 96 S.W.3d 256 (Tex. 2002) noted that the Legislature has declared that "the public policy of this state is to assure that children will have frequent and
continuing contact with parents who have shown the ability to act in the best interest of the child." This means that court intervention should aim, when possible,
to preserve the parent-child relationship while ensuring the child's safety and welfare.
Evidence Requirements
Court intervention requires sufficient evidence of neglect or endangerment. In re Interest of K-A.B.M., 551 S.W.3d 275 (Tex. App. 2018) specified that termination
under subsection (E) "must be based on more than a single act or omission" and requires "a voluntary, deliberate, and conscious course of conduct by the
parent." However, in cases of medical neglect, a single instance of failing to provide necessary medical care could still constitute neglect under other definitions,
particularly if it creates an immediate danger to the child's health or safety.
Clear and Convincing Evidence Standard
In re E.O.R., No. 04-18-00248-CV (Tex. App. Nov 07, 2018) emphasized that to terminate parental rights, the Department must prove its case by "clear and
convincing evidence." This is a higher standard than the "preponderance of the evidence" standard used in many civil cases. However, less severe interventions,
such as protective orders or temporary conservatorship, may have lower evidentiary standards.
Financial Limitations
40 Tex. Admin. Code § 707.471 specifies that physical neglect excludes "failure caused primarily by financial inability unless relief services had been offered and
refused." This suggests that if a parent's failure to provide medical care was primarily due to financial inability, and they had not been offered or had not refused
relief services, this might not constitute neglect. However, this exception would not apply to emergency medical situations where other resources (such as
emergency rooms that cannot refuse treatment) were available.
Conclusion
Texas law provides a comprehensive framework for court intervention in cases of medical neglect. When a child's health condition requires immediate medical
attention that is not provided, this constitutes medical neglect under multiple provisions of the Texas Family Code and Administrative Code. Such neglect
endangers the child's welfare and justifies court intervention to protect the child.
The legal pathways for intervention range from protective orders to temporary conservatorship or, in severe cases, termination of parental rights. The appropriate
intervention depends on the severity of the neglect, the immediacy of the danger to the child's health, and the likelihood of recurrence.
The materialization of medical neglect—evidence that a child's health condition required immediate medical attention that was not provided—creates valid
grounds for a renewed request for court intervention. Such evidence demonstrates that the child's welfare is at risk due to the parent's failure to provide
necessary care, which is precisely the situation the legal framework is designed to address.
In all cases, the best interest of the child is the paramount consideration. Courts are empowered to take action to protect children from neglect, including medical
neglect, while also respecting parental rights and the value of preserving the parent-child relationship when possible.
When a child's health and safety are at risk due to medical neglect, the Texas legal system provides both the legal authority and the procedural mechanisms for
courts to intervene to protect the child's welfare.
Legal Authorities
In re S.M.R. , 434 S.W.3d 576, 57 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 670 (Tex. 2014)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
The court's order recited that there was 'sufficient evidence to satisfy a person of ordinary prudence and caution that: (1) there was a danger to the physical
health or safety of the child which was caused by an act or failure to act of the person entitled to possession and for the child to remain in the home is contrary to
the welfare of the child; (2) the urgent need for protection required the immediate removal of the child and makes efforts to eliminate or prevent the children's
removal impossible or unreasonable; and (3) notwithstanding reasonable efforts to eliminate the need for the children's removal and enable the children to return
home, there is a substantial risk of a continuing danger if the children are returned home.'
Summary
The passage describes a court's decision to intervene in a family matter due to evidence of neglect, specifically medical neglect, and the failure to provide
necessary medical care. The court found that the children's health and safety were at risk due to the parents' failure to act, justifying the removal of the children
from their home. This aligns with the proposition that courts can intervene to protect a child's welfare when there is evidence of neglect, including medical neglect.

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Without necessarily adopting the doctrine of Res ipsa loquitur with all of its implications in the law of torts, we agree that circumstantial evidence may be sufficient
to establish child abuse or child neglect within § 15.02. Accordingly, we hold that a fact finding that parents either abused a child or knowingly allowed it to remain
in dangerous conditions may be supported by evidence of (1) multiple injuries or other serious impairment of health that ordinarily would not occur in the absence
of abuse or gross neglect, and (2) the parents' control over the child during the period when the abuse or neglect is alleged to have occurred. Lack of any
reasonable explanation by the parents of the child's condition is an additional circumstance that may be considered in support of such a finding.
Summary
The Texas Court of Appeals recognizes that circumstantial evidence can be sufficient to establish child abuse or neglect. This includes situations where there are
multiple injuries or serious health impairments that would not typically occur without abuse or neglect, and where parents have control over the child during the
relevant period. The lack of a reasonable explanation for the child's condition can further support findings of neglect. This aligns with the proposition that courts
can intervene to protect a child's welfare when there is evidence of neglect, such as failing to provide necessary medical attention.
In re L.E.S., 471 S.W.3d 915 (Tex. App. 2015)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
James and Julie appeal from the trial court's order terminating their parental rights to their daughter, L.E.S. Both parents contend the evidence is legally and
factually insufficient to support the trial court's findings that they (1) knowingly placed or knowingly allowed the child to remain in conditions or surroundings which
endangered the physical or emotional well-being of the child, (2) engaged in conduct or knowingly placed the child with persons who engaged in conduct that
endangered the physical and emotional well-being of the child, and (3) failed to comply with the provisions of a court order that specifically established the actions
necessary for the parents to obtain the return of the child who had been in the temporary managing conservatorship of the Texas Department of Family and
Protective Services (the Department) not less than nine months as a result of the child's removal from the parents under Chapter 262 of the Texas Family Code
for the abuse or neglect of the child.
Summary
The passage discusses a case where parental rights were terminated due to the endangerment of a child's well-being, which includes neglect. The Texas Family
Code provides grounds for such intervention when a child is placed in conditions that endanger their physical or emotional well-being. This aligns with the
proposition that courts can intervene in family matters to protect a child's welfare when there is evidence of neglect, such as failing to provide necessary medical
attention.
In re K.N.D., 403 S.W.3d 277 (Tex. App. 2013)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Chapter 262 authorizes the involuntary removal of a child under various circumstances when 'there is an immediate danger to the physical health or safety of the
child.' ... Finally, DFPS presented evidence of A.D.'s actions of medical neglect and neglectful supervision of S.L.A.D., including an incident in which S.L.A.D. had
'an emergency condition and abscess, an injury that required surgery on the brain,' but A.D. was unavailable to give consent for treatment because 'she had gone
to Florida in 2009 and didn't come back until sometime in 2010.' These facts are clearly sufficient to show convincingly that A.D. had an ongoing pattern of
abusive or neglectful behavior that endangered both S.L.A.D. and K.N.D.
Summary
Chapter 262 of the Texas Family Code provides a legal framework for the involuntary removal of a child when there is immediate danger to their health or safety.
The case illustrates how evidence of medical neglect, such as failing to provide necessary medical attention, can justify court intervention to protect a child's
welfare. The specific example of A.D.'s neglectful behavior leading to the removal of her child supports the proposition that courts can intervene in similar
situations.

Summary
Neglect of a child's medical needs endangers the child and that a parent's failure to provide appropriate medical care may constitute endangering conduct. This
aligns with the proposition that courts can intervene in family matters to protect a child's welfare when there is evidence of medical neglect. The passage provides
legal precedent and references to support the idea that medical neglect is a serious issue that can justify court intervention.
In re C.H., 89 S.W.3d 17 (Tex. 2002)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
The Texas Department of Protective and Regulatory Services filed an action to terminate the parent-child relationship... under the procedures provided in Texas
Family Code Chapter 161... The jury found that the parents had engaged in conduct warranting termination and that terminating the rights of both parents would
be in the best interest of the child... The Texas Legislature has now codified the clear-and-convincing standard in Family Code § 161.001(1), (2), which provides:
a 'court may order termination of the parent-child relationship if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence' that the parent has engaged in certain listed
conduct and 'termination is in the best interest of the child.'
Summary
The passage from "In re C.H." illustrates that Texas courts have the authority to terminate parental rights if there is clear and convincing evidence of conduct that
is detrimental to the child's welfare. This includes situations where a child's health and safety are at risk due to neglect or abuse. The passage supports the
proposition by showing that courts can intervene in family matters to protect a child's welfare when there is evidence of neglect, such as failing to provide
necessary medical attention.
In re E.C.R., 402 S.W.3d 239, 56 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 666 (Tex. 2013)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
The Family Code allows a court to terminate a parent's rights to her child if the child has been in the State's custody for at least nine months, and the State
proves, by clear and convincing evidence, that the parent failed to comply with a court order that specified what she had to do to get her child back. Tex.
Fam.Code § 161.001(1)( O ). The provision applies, however, only if the child was removed from the parent under Family Code Chapter 262 for 'abuse or neglect
of the child.' ... At least one appellate court has interpreted subsection O in a similar fashion, holding that termination was warranted upon proof of 'immediate
danger to the physical health or safety of the child'—the emergency removal standard under chapter 262. ... The preceding chapter, titled 'Investigation of Report
of Child Abuse or Neglect,' requires that 'abuse' and 'neglect' be reported to the authorities, and the failure to do so carries criminal penalties. Tex. Fam.Code §§
261.101(a), .103(a), .109. ... neglect includes placing a child in or failing to remove a child from a situation that requires actions or judgment beyond his
capabilities and that results in 'a substantial risk of immediate harm to the child' ... Once the Department receives a report of abuse or neglect, it must promptly
and thoroughly investigate. Id. § 261.301(a). If the Department believes that the child's immediate removal is necessary to avoid further abuse or neglect, it must
file a petition or take other action under chapter 262 for the child's temporary care and protection.
Summary
The passages from "In re E.C.R." discuss the legal standards under the Texas Family Code for terminating parental rights and removing a child from parental
custody due to abuse or neglect. The passages highlight that courts can intervene when there is evidence of neglect, including situations where a child's physical
health or safety is at substantial risk. The Family Code provisions and the court's interpretation support the idea that medical neglect, which places a child at
immediate risk, can justify court intervention to protect the child's welfare.

Protective and Regulatory Services for not less than nine months as a result of the child's removal from the parent under Chapter 262 for the abuse or neglect of
the child; [Section 161.001(1)(O), Texas Family Code].
Summary
The passage outlines conditions under which a parent may lose custody of a child due to neglect or inability to provide a safe environment, as per the Texas
Family Code. It highlights the court's authority to intervene when a child is in the conservatorship of the Department due to neglect or abuse. This supports the
proposition that courts can intervene in family matters to protect a child's welfare when there is evidence of neglect, such as failing to provide necessary medical
attention.

The trial court may order termination of the parent-child relationship if it finds by clear and convincing evidence that the parent has knowingly placed or knowingly
allowed the child to remain in conditions or surroundings that endanger the physical or emotional well-being of the child. Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 161.001(b)(1)(D).
... A child is endangered when the environment creates a potential for danger that the parent is aware of but consciously disregards. ... The trial court may also
order termination of the parent-child relationship if it finds by clear and convincing evidence that the parent has engaged in conduct, or knowingly placed the child
with persons who engaged in conduct, that endangers the physical or emotional well-being of the child. Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 161.001(b)(1)(E).
Summary
Texas law allows for court intervention in family matters when a child's well-being is endangered. Specifically, the court can terminate parental rights if a parent
knowingly places a child in dangerous conditions or engages in conduct that endangers the child. This aligns with the proposition that courts can intervene to
protect a child's welfare when there is evidence of neglect, such as failing to provide necessary medical attention.

Clear and Convincing Evidence. If the Department moves to terminate a parent's rights to a child, the Department must prove by clear and convincing evidence
that (1) the parent's acts or omissions met one or more of the grounds for involuntary termination listed in section 161.001(b)(1) of the Family Code, and (2)
terminating the parent's rights is in the best interest of the child. TEX. FAM. CODE ANN. § 161.001(b) (West Supp. 2017); In re J.F.C., 96 S.W.3d 256, 261 (Tex.
2002). The same evidence used to prove the parent's acts or omissions under section 161.001(b)(1) may be used in determining the best interest of the child
under section 161.001(b)(2).
Summary
The Texas Family Code provides a legal framework for terminating parental rights when there is clear and convincing evidence of neglect or abuse. The passage
highlights that the same evidence used to demonstrate a parent's neglectful acts or omissions can also be used to determine the best interest of the child. This
supports the proposition that courts can intervene in family matters to protect a child's welfare when there is evidence of neglect, such as failing to provide
necessary medical attention.

Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Section 161.001(b)(1)(E) allows a trial court to terminate a parent's rights if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the parent 'engaged in conduct
or knowingly placed the child with persons who engaged in conduct which endangers the physical or emotional well-being of the child.' ... Children's basic needs
include medical care. ... In deciding that termination of parental rights is in the best interest of a child, the trier of fact may consider evidence that a parent
neglected to seek appropriate medical treatment for the child.
Summary
The Texas Family Code allows for the termination of parental rights if a parent engages in conduct that endangers a child's well-being. The court considers
neglect of a child's basic needs, including medical care, as a factor in determining whether termination is in the child's best interest. This supports the proposition
that courts can intervene in family matters to protect a child's welfare when there is evidence of medical neglect.

Summary
Legal grounds for terminating parental rights when a parent knowingly places a child in conditions that endanger their well-being. It highlights that a child's
endangerment can occur when a parent is aware of a dangerous environment but disregards it. This aligns with the proposition that courts can intervene in family
matters to protect a child's welfare when there is evidence of neglect, such as failing to provide necessary medical attention.

Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Under subsection (D), a parent's rights may be terminated if, before the child is removed, the parent 'knowingly placed or knowingly allowed the child to remain in
conditions or surroundings which endanger the physical or emotional well-being of the child.' Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 161.001(b)(1)(D). In the context of the
statute, 'endanger' means to expose to loss or injury; to jeopardize.' Tex. Dep't of Human Servs. v. Boyd, 727 S.W.2d 531, 533 (Tex. 1987). A parent's rights to
their child may also be terminated if the trial court finds the parent 'engaged in conduct or knowingly placed the child with persons who engaged in conduct which
endangers the physical or emotional well-being of the child.' Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 161.001(b)(1)(E).
Summary
The passage from "In re W.T." provides legal grounds under Texas Family Code section 161.001(b)(1)(D) and (E) for the termination of parental rights when a
parent knowingly places a child in conditions that endanger their well-being. This aligns with the proposition that courts can intervene in family matters to protect a
child's welfare when there is evidence of neglect or abuse, such as failing to provide necessary medical attention. The legal framework supports the idea that
materialization of medical neglect could justify court intervention.

Summary

=== PAGE 9 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Texas law requires evidence of specific conduct by a parent that is likely to harm a child's physical health or emotional development to overcome the presumption
that a parent should have custody. This supports the proposition that if there is evidence of medical neglect, it could justify court intervention to protect the child's
welfare.

conduct or knowingly placed the child with persons who engaged in conduct which endangers the physical or emotional well-being of the child,' id. §
161.001(b)(1)(E). Both subsections (D) and (E) require proof of child endangerment, i.e., 'exposing a child to loss or injury or jeopardizing a child's emotional or
physical well-being.'
Summary
Legal standards under Texas law for terminating parental rights when a parent has endangered a child's physical or emotional well-being. This includes situations
where a parent has knowingly placed the child in harmful conditions or engaged in conduct that endangers the child. The passage supports the proposition by
highlighting that courts can intervene in family matters to protect a child's welfare when there is evidence of neglect or abuse, such as failing to provide necessary
medical attention.

Ground (E) is satisfied by proof that the parent engaged in conduct or knowingly placed the child with persons who engaged in conduct which endangered the
physical or emotional well-being of the child. TEX. FAM. CODE ANN. § 161.001(b)(1)(E). [] The cause of the danger to the child must be the parent's conduct
and/or failure to act. In re M.J.M.L., 31 S.W.3d 347, 350-51 (Tex. App.-San Antonio 2000, pet. denied); Doyle v. Tex. Dep't of Protective & Regulatory Servs., 16

Summary
Legal grounds under Texas law for terminating parental rights when a parent's conduct endangers a child's well-being. It highlights that the danger can arise from
the parent's actions or inactions, and actual harm to the child is not necessary for court intervention. This aligns with the proposition that courts can intervene in
family matters to protect a child's welfare when there is evidence of neglect, such as failing to provide necessary medical attention.

knowingly placed the child with persons who engaged in conduct which endangers the physical or emotional well-being of the child.' TEX. FAM. CODE ANN. §
161.001(b)(1)(E). To 'endanger' means to expose to loss or injury, to jeopardize. Tex. Dep't of Human Servs. v. Boyd, 727 S.W.2d 531, 533 (Tex. 1987). Under
subsection 161.001(b)(1)(E), the relevant inquiry is whether evidence exists that the endangerment of the child's well-being was the direct result of the parent's
conduct, which includes acts, omissions, or failures to act.
Summary
The Texas Family Code allows for the termination of parental rights if a parent's conduct endangers a child's well-being. This includes omissions or failures to act,
which could encompass failing to provide necessary medical attention. The passage supports the proposition that courts can intervene in family matters to protect
a child's welfare when there is evidence of neglect, such as medical neglect.

Id.; see In re S.M.L., 171 S.W.3d 472, 477 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2005, no pet.) (noting that it is not necessary that the parent's conduct be directed
towards the child or that the child actually be injured; rather, a child is endangered when the environment creates a potential for danger which the parent is aware
of but disregards). The danger to a child may be inferred from parental misconduct. Boyd, 727 S.W.2d at 533. Furthermore, in considering whether to terminate
parental rights, the court may look at parental conduct both before and after the birth of the child. Avery v. State, 963 S.W.2d 550, 553 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st
Dist.] 1997, nopet.). Subsection (b)(1)(D) permits termination based upon only a single act or omission.
Summary
A child is considered endangered if the environment poses a potential danger that the parent is aware of but disregards. This aligns with the proposition that
courts can intervene when there is evidence of neglect, such as failing to provide necessary medical attention. The passage also notes that termination of
parental rights can be based on a single act or omission, which supports the idea that a single instance of medical neglect could justify court intervention.

Under Subsection (E), the relevant inquiry is whether evidence exists that the endangerment of the child’s physical well-being was the direct result of the parent’s
conduct, including acts, omissions, or failures to act. See In re J.T.G., 121 S.W.3d 117, 125 (Tex.App.—Fort Worth 2003, no pet.). Termination under this
subsection must be based on more than a single act or omission. Id. The statute requires a voluntary, deliberate, and conscious course of conduct by the parent.
Id. When determining whether a parent has engaged in an endangering course of conduct, a fact finder may consider the parent’s actions and inactions that
occurred both before and after the child was born. See In re J.O.A., 283 S.W.3d 336, 345 (Tex. 2009).
Summary
Texas law allows for the termination of parental rights if there is evidence that a parent's conduct has endangered a child's physical well-being. This includes acts,
omissions, or failures to act that demonstrate a voluntary, deliberate, and conscious course of conduct. The court can consider both past and present actions or
inactions of the parent. This supports the proposition that courts can intervene in family matters to protect a child's welfare when there is evidence of neglect,
such as failing to provide necessary medical attention.

Extract
In the statute governing suits affecting the parent-child relationship, our Legislature has declared that '[t]he public policy of this state is to ... assure that children
will have frequent and continuing contact with parents who have shown the ability to act in the best interest of the child.' TEX. FAM.CODE § 153.001(a). The
statute further provides that '[t]he best interest of the child shall always be the primary consideration of the court in determining the issues of conservatorship and

has emphasized repeatedly that the 'best interest of the child' is the state's foremost priority in determining the welfare of children.
Summary
The Texas Family Code prioritizes the best interest of the child in legal decisions affecting the parent-child relationship. This includes ensuring that children are in
environments where their welfare is protected. The emphasis on the child's best interest supports the proposition that courts can intervene in family matters to
protect a child's welfare, especially in cases of neglect or abuse, such as failing to provide necessary medical attention.

Extract
An original suit filed by a governmental entity that requests permission to take possession of a child without prior notice and a hearing must be supported by an
affidavit sworn to by a person with personal knowledge and stating facts sufficient to satisfy a person of ordinary prudence and caution that: there is an immediate
danger to the physical health or safety of the child or the child has been a victim of neglect or sexual abuse; continuation in the home would be contrary to the
child's welfare; there is no time, consistent with the physical health or safety of the child, for a full adversary hearing under Subchapter C; the child would not be
adequately protected in the child's home with an order for the removal of the alleged perpetrator under Section FAMILY CODE 262.1015 or FAMILY CODE
262.1016 or a protective order issued under Title 4; placing the child with a relative or designated caregiver or with a caregiver under a parental child safety
placement agreement authorized by Subchapter L, Chapter 264: (A) was offered but refused; (B) was not possible because there was no time, consistent with the
physical health or safety of the child and the nature of the emergency, to conduct the caregiver evaluation; or (C) would pose an immediate danger to the physical
health or safety of the child; and reasonable efforts, consistent with the circumstances and providing for the safety of the child, were made to prevent or eliminate
the need for the removal of the child.
Summary
Conditions under which a governmental entity can file a suit to take possession of a child without prior notice and a hearing. It specifies that such action is justified
when there is immediate danger to the child's health or safety, or evidence of neglect. This aligns with the proposition that courts can intervene in family matters

The Texas Family Code provides a mechanism for courts to issue protective orders when there are reasonable grounds to believe a child is a victim of abuse or
neglect, or there is a threat of immediate or continued abuse or neglect. This aligns with the proposition that courts can intervene to protect a child's welfare in
cases of medical neglect, as medical neglect falls under the broader category of neglect.
40 Tex. Admin. Code § 707.467 40 Tex. Admin. Code § 707.467 What Is Neglectful Supervision?
Extract
Neglect is defined in Texas Family Code (TFC) §261.001 as an act or failure to act by a person responsible for a child's care, custody, or welfare evidencing the
person's blatant disregard for the consequences of the act or failure to act that results in harm to the child or that creates an immediate danger to the child's
physical health or safety. Neglectful supervision is a subset of the statutory definition of neglect and involves the following acts or omissions by a person: Placing
a child in or failing to remove a child from a situation that a reasonable person would realize requires judgment or actions beyond the child's level of maturity,
physical condition, or mental abilities and that results in bodily injury or an immediate danger of harm to the child.
Summary
Definition of neglect under the Texas Family Code, which includes a failure to act that results in harm or creates an immediate danger to a child's physical health
or safety. This aligns with the proposition that courts can intervene in family matters to protect a child's welfare when there is evidence of neglect, such as failing
to provide necessary medical attention. The passage also outlines criteria for neglectful supervision, which supports the idea that a failure to act in a situation
requiring medical attention could be considered neglect.

CONFRONTING INDETERMINACY AND BIAS IN CHILD PROTECTION LAW.
Stanford Law & Policy Review - Stanford Law School - Gupta-Kagan, Josh - 2022-06-22
Extract
Removal decisions are one area where the law is somewhat more determinate than it used to be. In 1975, Robert Mnookin proposed permitting removals only 
when an immediate and substantial danger to the child exists due to neglect and abuse, and no reasonable alternative means to protect the child. (133) The 
American Bar Association (ABA) and Institute for Judicial Administration (IJA) Juvenile Justice Project also suggested that the state should not be empowered to 
intervene in a family except when necessary to protect a child. (134) States have partly adopted these standards. (135) There are greater limits on removals 
without court orders--the child protection equivalent of arrest. In this stage, it is common to have a provision permitting emergency removals only when they are

necessary to prevent an imminent risk of harm from abuse or neglect. (136
Summary
Conditions under which courts can intervene in family matters, specifically focusing on removal decisions when there is an immediate and substantial danger to
the child due to neglect or abuse. It highlights that states, including Texas, have adopted standards that allow for emergency removals to prevent imminent harm.
This aligns with the proposition that courts can intervene to protect a child's welfare when there is evidence of neglect, such as failing to provide necessary
medical attention.
NATURAL LAW, PARENTAL RIGHTS, AND THE DEFENSE OF "LIBERAL" LIMITS ON GOVERNMENT: AN ANALYSIS OF THE MORTARA CASE AND ITS
CONTEMPORARY PARALLELS.
Notre Dame Law Review - University of Notre Dame Law School - Moschella, Melissa - 2023-05-01
Extract
"Federal law defines abuse and neglect as an 'act or failure to act on the part of a parent or caretaker, which results in death, serious physical or emotional harm,
sexual abuse or exploitation..., or an act or failure to act which presents an imminent risk of serious harm.' (67) As Katherine Drabiak comments, traditional
concepts of abuse and neglect 'entail intentional harm, reckless indifference, or callous disregard' for the child's well-being. (68) ... the state's duty to step in when
naturalist parents are refusing insulin to their diabetic son or antibiotics to their daughter sick with meningitis, so is it the state's duty to step in when the parents of
gender-dysphoric children are avoiding medically recommended treatment." (112)
Summary
Federal definition of abuse and neglect, which includes a failure to act that presents an imminent risk of serious harm. It also discusses the state's duty to
intervene in cases where parents refuse necessary medical treatment for their children. This aligns with the proposition that courts can intervene to protect a
child's welfare when there is evidence of medical neglect.

Extract
home in which they are free from abuse and neglect (Waldfogel and Berger 2006). As such, child welfare systems have considerable coercive and legal power to
intervene in (allegedly) abusive and neglectful families—if necessary, even against parents’ wills (Freymond and Cameron 2006). That is, concerns for both
equity and children’s rights have meant that society’s obligation to protect children from maltreatment is typically treated in law and policy as superseding
society’s obligation to ensure parental rights and family privacy once some legally defined threshold of abuse or neglect has potentially been crossed (Berger and
Waldfogel 2011).
Summary
The passage highlights the legal authority of child welfare systems to intervene in cases of abuse and neglect, emphasizing that the protection of children from
maltreatment takes precedence over parental rights and family privacy once a threshold of neglect is crossed. This supports the proposition that courts can
intervene in family matters to protect a child's welfare when there is evidence of neglect, such as failing to provide necessary medical attention.
The Scope, Nature, and Causes of Child Abuse and Neglect
ANNALS of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, The - Sage Publications, Inc. - 2020-11-01
Extract
States provide more specific—and sometimes more expansive—definitions in their civil statutes (which guide child welfare system and family court actions) and
criminal statutes (which guide decisions to prosecute forms of child maltreatment as a criminal offense). Consistent with a focus on child safety rather than
parental culpability, statutory definitions of child maltreatment tend to emphasize harm or threat of harm to children that results from specific actions or inactions,
with comparatively little emphasis on perpetrator intent... include children lacking necessary medical care in the neglect subscale, which may occur for reasons of
negligence, poverty, or (less commonly) malice.
Summary
Statutory definitions of child maltreatment focus on the harm or threat of harm to children due to specific actions or inactions, such as lacking necessary medical
care. This aligns with the proposition that courts can intervene in family matters to protect a child's welfare when there is evidence of neglect, such as failing to
provide necessary medical attention.

may also be in danger of child abuse or neglect and ensuring their placement in a safe environment; ... procedures for the immediate screening, risk and safety
assessment, and prompt investigation of such reports of alleged abuse and neglect in order to ensure the well-being and safety of children;
Summary
The passage outlines federal procedures for the immediate protection of children who are victims of abuse or neglect. It emphasizes the need for prompt action to
ensure the safety and well-being of children, which aligns with the proposition that courts can intervene in family matters to protect a child's welfare when there is
evidence of neglect or abuse. The procedures mentioned support the idea that medical neglect, as a form of child neglect, could justify court intervention to
protect a child's welfare.
