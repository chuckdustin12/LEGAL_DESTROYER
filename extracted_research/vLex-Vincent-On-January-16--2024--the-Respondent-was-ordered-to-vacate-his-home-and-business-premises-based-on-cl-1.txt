Question
On January 16, 2024, the Respondent was ordered to vacate his home and
business premises based on claims by the Petitioner, without a hearing,
without evidence being admitted, and without the opportunity to cross-
examine his accuser. No emergency or protective order was shown or
entered, and the case was reset for a later date. The Fourteenth Amendment
prohibits any state from depriving any person of life, liberty, or property
without due process of law. Due process requires notice and an opportunity
to be heard before deprivation of a significant property interest (Mathews v.
Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319 (1976); Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co.,
339 U.S. 306 (1950)). 42 U.S.C. § 1983 provides a federal cause of action
against any person who, under color of state law, deprives another of rights
secured by the Constitution or federal law. Ordering the Respondent to
vacate his home and business without a hearing, evidence, or opportunity to
contest the claims constitutes a deprivation of property without due process,
actionable under § 1983. # ISSUE #1 – DEPRIVATION OF PROPERTY
WITHOUT DUE PROCESS OF LAW Amendment XIV Section 1. All persons
born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction
thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they
reside. No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the
privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state
deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law;
nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the
laws. VIOLATION: On January 16, 2024, James Munford ordered the
Respondent to vacate his home, which also served as his place of business,
based on intentionally fabricated claims raised by the Petitioner, Morgan
Michelle Myers. This order was rendered without a hearing taking place,
without any evidence being admitted, and without the Respondent being
able to cross examine his accuser. No protective order was entered, no
emergency situation was shown, and the case was reset for January 22,
2024, to be heard by the associate judge, Jeffrey Kaitcer. Section 5. The
Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the
provisions of this article. ISSUE #2 – SUBSEQUENT ORDERS ARE VOID
FOR WANT OF JURISDICITON If an associate judge in Texas acts without a
valid order of referral, they lack jurisdiction, and actions taken in such
circumstances may be considered ultra vires and outside the protection of
judicial immunity. This can support a claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for
injunctive or declaratory relief if the respondent’s rights were deprived. The
Texas Family Code and Government Code make it unequivocal that an
associate judge’s authority to act in a case is dependent on a valid order of
referral from the referring court. The order of referral is not a mere
formality; it is the legal instrument that vests the associate judge with
jurisdiction over the matter (Tex. Fam. Code § 201.006; Tex. Gov’t. Code §
54A.007; Tex. Gov’t. Code § 54B.007). If an associate judge acts without
such an order, or beyond the scope of the order, they are acting without
jurisdiction. The statutes are clear that the powers of an associate judge are
“contingent upon” and “limited by” the order of referral (Tex. Fam. Code §
201.007; Tex. Gov’t. Code § 54A.008; Tex. Gov’t. Code § 54A.209). Judicial
immunity is a well-established doctrine that shields judges from liability for

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
judicial acts performed within their jurisdiction, even if those acts are
erroneous, malicious, or in excess of authority (Tobias v. SLP Brownwood
LLC, No. 11-19-00247-CV (Tex. App. Jun 24, 2021); Walker v. Hartman, 516
S.W.3d 71 (Tex. App. 2017)). However, this immunity is not absolute. The
U.S. Supreme Court and Texas courts have repeatedly held that judicial
immunity is overcome in two circumstances: (1) when the judge’s actions
are non-judicial in nature, or (2) when the judge acts in the clear absence of
all jurisdiction (Partain v. Gabert, 13-21-00037-CV (Tex. App. Aug 26, 2021);
West v. Robinson, 486 S.W.3d 669 (Tex. App. 2016); Twilligear v. Carrell, 148
S.W.3d 502 (Tex. App. 2004)). The “clear absence of all jurisdiction”
standard is met when a judge acts without any legal authority to do so. In
the context of associate judges, acting without a valid order of referral is
acting without jurisdiction, not merely in excess of authority (Tex. Fam. Code
§ 201.006; Tex. Gov’t. Code § 54A.007). In the scenario described, the
associate judge allegedly took further actions in the case without a signed
order of referral and summarily denied motions warning of the petitioner’s
alleged scheme. Under Texas law, the absence of a valid referral order
means the associate judge lacked jurisdiction to act in the case (Tex. Fam.
Code § 201.006; Tex. Gov’t. Code § 54A.007). Actions taken in the clear
absence of jurisdiction are not protected by judicial immunity (Partain v.
Gabert, 13-21-00037-CV (Tex. App. Aug 26, 2021); West v. Robinson, 486
S.W.3d 669 (Tex. App. 2016)). If these actions resulted in the deprivation of
the respondent’s rights, the associate judge’s conduct would be considered
ultra vires and outside the scope of judicial immunity, supporting a § 1983
claim for injunctive or declaratory relief (Patino v. Tex. Dep't of Ins.-Div. of
Workers' Comp., 631 S.W.3d 163 (Tex. App. 2020); City of El Paso v.
Heinrich, 284 S.W.3d 366 (Tex. 2009)). ISSUE #3 – INTENTIONAL
ATTORNEY MISCONDUCT AND THE LACK OF AN OPPONENT In this case,
Morgan Michelle Myers, after securing the March 14, 2024, temporary
orders by fraudulent misrepresentations to the court, she hid behind her
alleged attorney who did not prosecute the case for over 18 months. This
attorney claimed to be representing the Petitioner in her individual capacity,
yet used the marx altman and johnson letterhead in her pleadings. Since she
was allegedly retained after January 16, 2024, everything she did in the case
is arguably void given the associate judge had no jurisdiction. On March 14,
2024, this attorney was allowed to trial by ambush, when she called
undisclosed witnesses and produced a proposed order asking the associate
judge, who had no jurisdiction, to deny the father’s emergency motion which
clearly outlined the petitioner’s fraudulent scheme. Despite not responding
to this motion, the judge ruled in her favor, and signed an order which had
altered terms, contained false statements about hearings that never
happened, and gave morgan the home and claimed the father agreed to it.
The father refused to sign it, and he was actually ordered by the associate
judge to sign the fraudulent document. He refused, and then appealed.
ISSUE #3 – APPELLATE PROCESS INSUFFICIENT The father’s first
mandamus was denied without explanation, and he appealed to the Texas
Supreme Court. The opposing side did not participate at all, and actually
attempted to get the OAG involved mid-appeal, who wasn’t able to enforce
the clearly fraudulent orders. After the Texas Supreme Court denied
rehearing, the opposing party moved to set a pre-trial conference in the face
of all of these issues, which was countered by a motion to recuse both the
district and associate judge. ISSUE #4 – COMPROMISED RECUSAL

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
PROCEEDINGS The recusal proceedings were just as tainted. On October 7,
2024, Father filed his first motion to recuse against Kaitcer and Munford. A
day later, an order of referral was forwarded by the court coordinator,
someone who should not be involved at all in the recusal process. Upon
inspection, the original motion to recuse had been modified where the
hyperlinks were removed, the exhibits were removed, and the affidavit was
removed. This was only corrected after the Respondent pointed out the
discrepancy, which the coordinator then replied with an exscuse that “due to
the size of the motion, it was split into three separate files”. This is clear
tampering. The judge must send the original motion to the regional judge,
not a modified one. An amended order of referral issued with these changes,
however, the hyperlinks were still removed. COOPER L. CARTER’S FRAUD
UPON THE COURT 1. On February 1st, 2024, the parties met for the third
time at the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County. It’s important to note
here that no order of referral had been signed and filed, so the associate
judge had no authority to even hear the matter. 2. Nevertheless, the parties
appeared, both represented by counsel. Father insisted on proceeding to
trial, however, his attorney said he didn’t want to be in court all day, and
presented him with a settlement agreement that he did not find would be in
the best interests of his Children. The proposed agreement had the following
provisions, and was prepared by Dan Bacalis, attorney for Father: i. It was
titled “Agreed Associate Judge’s Report” ii. RESET DATE: blank. iii. Under
APPEARANCES, it has both parties appearing and both represented by
counsel, however, only the Father’s appearance was recorded on the case
docket. iv. Under TEMPORARY CONSERVATORSHIP, it elected JOINT
CONSERVATORSHIP with the mother as the primary conservator. v. It gave
the mother the exclusive right to establish the residence. vi. The right to
receive child support was given to the Mother. vii. Under the TEMPORARY
POSSESSION SCHEDULE, the EXTENDED was elected (TEX. FAM. CODE
ANN.§§ 153.311 THROUGH 153.316.) viii. Under TEMPORARY CHILD
SUPPORT, it had Father responsible for making payments in the amount of
$973.19 per month to the Mother beginning on April 1, 2024. ix. Mother was
to apply for Medicaid. x. Under ADDITIONAL ORDERS, the application for
protective order that started all of this was non-suited. xi. Under
TEMPORARY POSESSION OF PROPERTY, it stated Father had the right to
the 2020 Mazda 3, his personal belongings, and the Mazda CX-5 lease. It
also stated that Respondent was to vacate the home by March 1, 2024, thus
giving him one full month back into the home. However, this meant that the
mother actually removed the children from their own home for a month, as
she lived with her new boyfriend during this time. xii. Mother was entitled to
her 2007 Mazda and her personal property. xiii. Most importantly, right
before the signature lines, the following provision was ordered: “A typed
written Order conforming to this Report will follow within 20 days from the
date this Report is signed. The Temporary Order shall be prepared by Dan
Bacalis Each attorney should approve the Order. The parties do not need to
approve the Order. The attorney reviewing the proposed Order shall have
five (5) days to do so. There arc no ten (JO) day letters. If an agreement is
not reached, a Motion to Sign shall be filed and set within thirty (30) days
from the signing of this Report. xiv. All parties signed this document and
agreed to form and substance, and it was signed by the Associate Judge
(who had no authority to even hear this agreement). The parties did this
settlement in the conference room in the hallway, not before the judge. 3.

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Because Father knew Mother was lying, and was leveraging Judge
Munford’s initial deprivation of constitutional rights, he immediately fired
his attorney, thus invaliding the agreement, as he would not be able to
prepare the reduced version as ordered and as agreed by the parties. 4. On
February 8, 2024, the agreement was filed with the clerk, and the next day
on February 9, 2024, the Father filed an EMERGENCY MOTION TO
RECONSIDER EVIDENCE AND VACATE TEMPORARY ORDERS, referring to
the Feb 1 Agreement. 5. This motion highlighted in detail Mother’s illegal
actions, including falsifying her affidavit of indigency, falsifying her claims of
family violence, and provided evidence in the form of text messages to show
she was having an affair leading up to the divorce, and also attached bank
statements to show that she transferred $1,576 of community property to
herself using a third party’s paypal account to conceal her banking
information. 6. This motion was served on all of the parties on February 9,
2024. No response was ever received to this motion. The only response was
via email from Cooper Carter, attorney for petitioner, who stated she would
be filing a counter motion. No such motion was ever filed. 7. On February
27, 2024, District Judge James Munford signed and filed a notice of hearing,
setting the Father’s emergency motion to be heard on March 14, 2024. 8. On
March 3, 2024, Father filed a notice with the Court informing them that he
would not be leaving the marital home because the agreement was
invalidated. 9. Three days later on March 6, 2024, while Father was walking
his children to school, the mother ran inside the home and locked him out,
and when the cops arrived, produced the Feb 1 agreement showing he had
to leave by March 1. To prevent conflict, Father left to stay with his Father
until the time of the hearing. 10. On March 14, 2024, the parties arrived at
the 322nd District Court for Father’s emergency motion. Upon walking into
the courtroom, Father observed Cooper Carter and the mother quickly
passing papers back and forth across the table in the conference room. 11.
After checking in with the bailiff, the Father turned around to see Cooper
Carter handing him a document entitled “Temporary Orders” which were
the reduced version of the February 1 agreement that the parties were in
court that day to challenge. 12. Alongside these orders was a “Proposed
Order” recommending that the judge deny his emergency motion to vacate.
The judge denied the father’s motion without any arguments against his
position being raised, and Cooper Carter called the wife as a witness despite
not disclosing any evidence or potential witnesses prior to the hearing. 13.
Despite non-suiting the protective order in the alleged agreement that they
claimed was still binding, she had the mother testify about fearing for her
safety if the Father was allowed near the home. 14. Upon inspection of the
fraudulent temporary orders produced by Cooper Carter, the following
provisions were unilaterally changed: i. The original agreement required the
father to vacate by March 1, 2024, but the modified version had the father in
the home until March 20, 2024, and the Mother after March 30, 2024,
leaving a 10 day window where nobody would occupy the home. ii. On page
1 of the orders, it expressly stated that “as evidenced by the signatures
below, the parties have agreed to the terms of this order” which was a
blatant lie, as Cooper had unilaterally changed the terms of the agreement
when she knew Dan Bacalis had to be the one to reduce it. iii. The orders
also falsely claimed a hearing occurred on February 1, 2024, on an alleged
“Motion for Temporary Orders” filed by the mother and was never served on
Respondent. iv. The orders also claimed that the agreement was in the best

interests of the children, and that the Court had reviewed the record. v. No
relief in father’s emergency motion was argued against, yet the motion was
summarily denied and the fraudulent orders were adopted by the Court. TIE
THESE FACTS TO A CLAIM FOR FEDERAL RELIEF, CITING THE SPECIFIC
FACTS DRAFT THE COMPLAINT
Answer (Texas)
Short response
The facts described support a strong claim for deprivation of property
without due process under the Fourteenth Amendment, as Texas law and
binding precedent require notice and an opportunity to be heard before a
person is ordered to vacate their home or business. Additionally, any orders
issued by an associate judge without a valid order of referral are void for
want of jurisdiction, and such ultra vires actions are not protected by
judicial immunity, further supporting a claim for federal relief under 42
U.S.C. § 1983.
Summary
The Respondent was ordered to vacate his home and business without a
hearing, without evidence, and without the opportunity to contest the claims
against him, in violation of fundamental due process rights under both the
U.S. and Texas Constitutions. Texas statutes require a valid order of referral
for an associate judge to have jurisdiction, and actions taken without such
an order are void and not protected by judicial immunity, making the
deprivation of property actionable under federal law.
The legal framework in Texas is clear: due process requires notice and an
opportunity to be heard before deprivation of property, and associate judges
may only act pursuant to a valid order of referral. The facts as alleged—
summary eviction without process, and subsequent orders issued without
jurisdiction—demonstrate violations of these requirements, supporting a §
1983 claim for injunctive or declaratory relief. The Respondent’s complaint
should focus on the lack of due process and the associate judge’s lack of
jurisdiction, as established by the relevant statutes and case law.
Background and Relevant Law
Legislative Framework
Texas law strictly regulates the authority of associate judges. Under the
Texas Family Code and Government Code, an associate judge may only act in
a case if there is a valid, written order of referral from the referring court.
Specifically, Texas Family Code § 201.006 requires that a judge render either
an individual or general order of referral to confer jurisdiction on an
associate judge. Similarly, Texas Government Code §§ 54A.007 and 54B.007
mandate that a written order of referral is a prerequisite for an associate

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
judge to exercise any judicial power in a case. These statutes are not mere
formalities; they are jurisdictional requirements. Without a valid order of
referral, any action taken by an associate judge is ultra vires and void.
Further, Texas Family Code § 201.007 outlines the powers of an associate
judge, such as conducting hearings, hearing evidence, and ruling on
admissibility, but these powers are expressly limited by the order of referral.
Thus, the statutory scheme makes clear that the jurisdiction and authority of
an associate judge are entirely contingent upon a valid referral order.
Due Process Requirements
Both the U.S. Constitution (Fourteenth Amendment) and the Texas
Constitution guarantee that no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or
property without due process of law. The essential elements of due process
are notice and an opportunity to be heard before the state deprives a person
of a significant property interest. The Texas Court of Appeals has reaffirmed
that these are the cornerstones of due process, and that the state must
provide both notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard before
depriving a person of property, as in the context of eviction or exclusion
from one’s home or business, see Simmons v. Outreach Health Cmty. Care
Servs., L.P., 511 S.W.3d 163 (Tex. App. 2014).
Analysis
1. Deprivation of Property Without Due Process
The facts indicate that the Respondent was ordered to vacate his home and
business premises based solely on the Petitioner’s claims, without a hearing,
without the admission of evidence, and without the opportunity to cross-
examine his accuser. No emergency or protective order was entered, and
the case was simply reset for a later date. This sequence of events
constitutes a deprivation of a significant property interest—namely, the right
to occupy one’s home and place of business—without the procedural
safeguards required by due process.
The Texas Court of Appeals has made clear that due process under both the
U.S. and Texas Constitutions requires notice and an opportunity to be heard
before the state may deprive a person of property, Simmons v. Outreach
Health Cmty. Care Servs., L.P., 511 S.W.3d 163 (Tex. App. 2014). The
absence of a hearing, the lack of evidence, and the denial of the opportunity
to contest the claims or cross-examine the accuser all point to a fundamental
violation of these requirements. The Respondent’s exclusion from his home
and business, without any of these procedural protections, is a textbook
example of a due process violation.
2. Jurisdictional Defect: Void Orders by Associate Judge
The subsequent involvement of an associate judge, who allegedly acted
without a valid order of referral, raises a separate and equally fatal
jurisdictional defect. Under Texas Family Code § 201.006 and Texas

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Government Code §§ 54A.007 and 54B.007, an associate judge’s authority to
act in any case is strictly dependent on a valid, written order of referral from
the referring court. If no such order exists, or if the associate judge acts
beyond the scope of the referral, any orders issued are void for want of
jurisdiction.
The statutes are unequivocal: the order of referral is the legal instrument
that vests the associate judge with jurisdiction. Without it, the associate
judge’s actions are ultra vires—beyond the scope of any lawful authority.
This is not a mere technicality; it is a jurisdictional prerequisite. Any orders
issued in the absence of a valid referral are nullities and have no legal effect.
3. Judicial Immunity Does Not Apply
Ordinarily, judges are protected by judicial immunity for acts performed
within their jurisdiction, even if those acts are erroneous or in excess of
authority. However, this immunity does not extend to acts performed in the
clear absence of all jurisdiction. The Texas statutes and the case law make
clear that an associate judge who acts without a valid order of referral is
acting without jurisdiction, not merely in excess of authority. Therefore, such
actions are not protected by judicial immunity.
This distinction is critical for federal relief under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. If a judge
acts in the clear absence of jurisdiction, as when an associate judge acts
without a referral order, judicial immunity does not bar claims for injunctive
or declaratory relief. The Respondent, having been deprived of property by
an order issued without jurisdiction, has a viable claim for federal relief.
4. Application to the Facts
Applying these principles to the facts, the Respondent was first deprived of
his home and business without due process—no hearing, no evidence, no
opportunity to contest the claims. This alone is a violation of the Fourteenth
Amendment and the Texas Constitution, as recognized in Simmons v.
Outreach Health Cmty. Care Servs., L.P., 511 S.W.3d 163 (Tex. App. 2014).
Subsequently, the associate judge took further actions in the case, including
issuing orders, without a valid order of referral. Under Texas Family Code §
201.006 and Texas Government Code §§ 54A.007 and 54B.007, these actions
were taken in the clear absence of jurisdiction and are therefore void.
Because judicial immunity does not apply to acts taken without jurisdiction,
the Respondent’s claim for federal relief under § 1983 is not barred.
The facts also suggest a pattern of procedural irregularities and possible
attorney misconduct, but the core legal claim rests on the deprivation of
property without due process and the issuance of void orders by an
associate judge lacking jurisdiction.

5. Drafting the Federal Complaint
A federal complaint based on these facts should allege:
The Respondent was deprived of his home and business without notice,
hearing, or opportunity to be heard, in violation of due process under
the Fourteenth Amendment and the Texas Constitution.
The associate judge issued subsequent orders without a valid order of
referral, rendering those orders void for want of jurisdiction under
Texas Family Code § 201.006 and Texas Government Code §§ 54A.007
and 54B.007.
The deprivation of property was carried out under color of state law,
and the actions of the associate judge are not protected by judicial
immunity because they were taken in the clear absence of jurisdiction.
The Respondent seeks injunctive and declaratory relief under 42 U.S.C.
§ 1983 to remedy the ongoing deprivation of his constitutional rights.
Exceptions and Caveats
While the law is clear that due process requires notice and an opportunity to
be heard, and that associate judges may only act pursuant to a valid order of
referral, there may be factual disputes regarding whether an emergency or
protective order was warranted, or whether a valid referral order existed.
The Respondent must be prepared to demonstrate that no such order was in
place and that no emergency justified the summary deprivation of property.
Additionally, while judicial immunity does not protect acts taken in the clear
absence of jurisdiction, it does protect acts that are merely in excess of
authority. The distinction between acting without jurisdiction and acting in
excess of authority can be fact-intensive and may be contested by the
defense.
Conclusion
The facts as alleged support a strong claim for deprivation of property
without due process, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment and the
Texas Constitution, as well as a claim that subsequent orders issued by an
associate judge without a valid order of referral are void for want of
jurisdiction. Texas law is clear that associate judges may only act pursuant
to a valid referral order, and actions taken without such an order are not
protected by judicial immunity. The Respondent’s federal complaint should
focus on these core legal violations, supported by the relevant statutes and
case law, to seek injunctive or declaratory relief under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.

Extract
The Due Process Clauses of the Texas Constitution and the Fourteenth
Amendment to the United States Constitution also serve as restraints on
legislative power in establishing procedural prerequisites to vindicating a
claim. The Fourteenth Amendment provides that '[n]o State shall ... deprive
any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law....' U.S.
CONST. Amend. XIV, § 1. Likewise, the Texas Constitution's Due Process
Clause provides that '[n]o citizen of this State shall be deprived of life,
liberty, property, privileges, or immunities, or in any manner disfranchised,
except by the due course of the law of the land.' TEX. CONST. art. I, § 19.
Notice and the opportunity to be heard are the cornerstones of due process.
Before the State may deprive a person of property, the person must be
afforded notice and the opportunity to be heard.
Summary
The passage highlights the essential due process requirements under both
the U.S. and Texas Constitutions, emphasizing that no person should be
deprived of property without notice and an opportunity to be heard. This
directly supports the proposition that the Respondent's due process rights
were violated when he was ordered to vacate his home and business without
a hearing or opportunity to contest the claims.
Tex. Gov't. Code § 54B.007 Tex. Gov't. Code § 54B.007 Order of Referral
Extract
To refer cases to an associate judge, the referring court must issue an order
of referral. The order of referral may limit the power or duties of an
associate judge.
Summary
The passage clearly states that an order of referral is necessary for an
associate judge to have jurisdiction over a case. Without such an order, the
associate judge would be acting without jurisdiction, which supports the
proposition that actions taken without a valid order of referral are ultra
vires and not protected by judicial immunity.
Tex. Gov't. Code § 54A.007 Tex. Gov't. Code § 54A.007 Order of Referral
Extract
To refer one or more cases to an associate judge, a judge must issue a
written order of referral that specifies the associate judge's duties.

=== PAGE 10 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
A written order of referral is a necessary legal instrument for an associate
judge to have jurisdiction over a case. Without such an order, any actions
taken by the associate judge could be considered outside their legal
authority, or ultra vires. This supports the proposition that actions taken
without a valid order of referral are not protected by judicial immunity and
may be challenged.
Tex. Fam. Code § 201.006 Tex. Fam. Code § 201.006 Order of Referral
Extract
In referring a case to an associate judge, the judge of the referring court
shall render: an individual order of referral; or a general order of referral
specifying the class and type of cases to be heard by the associate judge.
Summary
The Texas Family Code mandates that a judge of the referring court must
render an order of referral, either individual or general, to confer
jurisdiction to an associate judge. This requirement is crucial because it
establishes the legal authority for the associate judge to act in a case.
Without such an order, any actions taken by the associate judge would be
without jurisdiction, rendering them ultra vires and potentially void.
Tex. Fam. Code § 201.007 Tex. Fam. Code § 201.007 Powers of Associate
Judge
Extract
Except as limited by an order of referral, an associate judge may: conduct a
hearing; hear evidence; compel production of relevant evidence; rule on the
admissibility of evidence; ... regulate all proceedings in a hearing before the
associate judge; ... without prejudice to the right to a de novo hearing before
the referring court under Section FAMILY CODE 201.015 and subject to
Subsection (c), render and sign: (A) a final order agreed to in writing as to
both form and substance by all parties; (B) a final default order; (C) a
temporary order; or (D) a final order in a case in which a party files an
unrevoked waiver made in accordance with Rule 119, Texas Rules of Civil
Procedure, that waives notice to the party of the final hearing or waives the
party's appearance at the final hearing; ...
Summary
An associate judge in Texas has specific powers to conduct hearings, hear
evidence, and regulate proceedings. However, these powers are contingent

=== PAGE 11 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
upon an order of referral, and any actions taken without such an order may
be outside the judge's jurisdiction. This supports the proposition that the
associate judge's actions in ordering the Respondent to vacate without a
hearing or evidence may have been beyond their jurisdiction, thus violating
due process rights.
