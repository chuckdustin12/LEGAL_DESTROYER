Answer (Texas)
Short response
Restricting access to court records in a Texas civil case—especially after a
recusal motion, without a sealing order, and where no statutory
confidentiality applies—violates the strong presumption of public access,
undermines procedural transparency, and likely contravenes both Texas law
and constitutional principles. Such ad hoc restrictions erode public trust,
impede oversight of judicial conduct, and are inconsistent with the

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
mandatory procedures and safeguards established by Texas statutes, rules,
and case law.
Summary
Texas law and precedent establish a robust presumption that court records
are open to the public, with only narrow, well-defined exceptions—such as
juvenile or adoption matters, or where a court has entered a sealing order
after following strict procedural requirements. When access to court records
is suddenly restricted without a sealing motion, public notice, hearing, or a
written order with findings, and where no statutory confidentiality applies,
this not only violates the letter of Texas law but also undermines the public’s
ability to monitor the judiciary, especially in contexts where judicial
impartiality is being challenged.
The timing of the restriction—immediately following the filing of a recusal
motion—raises additional transparency concerns, as it may suggest an
attempt to shield judicial actions from public scrutiny at a critical juncture.
Texas courts, statutes, and rules uniformly require that any limitation on
public access be justified, narrowly tailored, and subject to procedural
safeguards; bypassing these requirements is both legally improper and
corrosive to the legitimacy of the judicial process.
Background and Relevant Law
Legislative and Regulatory Framework
Texas law, through both statute and court rules, enshrines a presumption of
public access to court records. The Texas Government Code, specifically
section 552.022, provides that information contained in public court records
is public and not excepted from disclosure unless made confidential by
statute or other law. Courts are prohibited from ordering the withholding of
such information unless a specific law makes it confidential, reinforcing the
default of openness for court records, subject only to narrow exceptions
(Tex. Gov't. Code § 552.022).
However, section 552.0035 clarifies that access to information held by the
judiciary is governed not by the Public Information Act, but by rules adopted
by the Texas Supreme Court or other applicable laws and rules. This means
that, for court records, the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure—most notably
Rule 76a—are the primary authority governing sealing and access (Tex.
Gov't. Code § 552.0035).
Rule 76a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure establishes that court records
are presumed open to the public and may only be sealed upon a showing of
a specific, serious, and substantial interest that clearly outweighs the
presumption of openness and any probable adverse effect on public health
or safety. The rule requires a written motion to seal, public notice, a public
hearing, and a written order stating specific reasons for sealing, all of which
must be open to public inspection. Importantly, no court order or opinion
issued in the adjudication of a case may be sealed (Tex. R. Civ. P. 76a).

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
The Texas Rules of Judicial Administration, particularly Rule 12, further
reinforce the principle of public access, specifying that its provisions do not
apply where access is controlled by other rules (such as Rule 76a), court
orders, or statutes (Tex. R. Jud. Admin. 12.3).
Case Law
Texas appellate courts and the Texas Supreme Court have repeatedly
affirmed the constitutional, common-law, and procedural presumption of
public access to court records and proceedings. The Texas Supreme Court
has described this right as a fundamental element of the rule of law,
recognized under the common law, constitutionally guaranteed, and
incorporated into procedural rules requiring openness (Baker v. Bizzle, 687
S.W.3d 285 (Tex. 2024); In re Dolcefino Commc'ns, 14-25-00555-CV (Tex.
App. Aug 28, 2025)).
Rule 76a’s procedural requirements are strictly enforced: sealing may only
occur after a public motion, notice, hearing, and a written order with
specific findings. Courts have condemned situations where records are
sealed or access is restricted without compliance with these procedures,
emphasizing that such actions should not occur and that it is the duty of
attorneys and judges to prevent them (In re Cook, 629 S.W.3d 591 (Tex. App.
2021); Rice v. Lewis Energy Grp., No. 04-19-00234-CV (Tex. App. Oct 28,
2020); Clear Channel v. United Services Auto., 195 S.W.3d 129 (Tex. App.
2006)).
Exceptions to this presumption are narrow and must be grounded in statute
or rule. For example, juvenile and adoption records are confidential by
statute, and the expunction statute provides a narrow exception for certain
criminal records. Courts lack equitable power to expand confidentiality
beyond these statutory bounds (Ex parte Border, NUMBER 13-17-00113-CV
(Tex. App. May 31, 2018); Ex parte F.T.K., NUMBER 13-16-00535-CV (Tex.
App. May 31, 2018)).
Appellate courts have also made clear that the presumption of openness
applies at both trial and appellate levels, and that any restriction on access
must be justified and procedurally proper (In re Meta Platforms, Inc.,
06-23-00045-CV (Tex. App. May 05, 2023)).
Administrative Decisions and Secondary Materials
Federal and administrative authorities, while not binding, reinforce the
strong presumption of public access to judicial records, especially those tied
to dispositive motions or orders. Courts must undertake a transparent, case-
by-case balancing of public access against any asserted interest in
confidentiality, and must articulate reasons for any restriction sufficient for
appellate review (In re Hill, 042215 SEC, 3-16383; Signed, Sealed,
Delivered? Fifth Circuit Finds Sealing Of Sensitive Information Requires Far
More Than A Protective Order).
Secondary materials highlight that, despite the legal presumption of
openness, practical barriers—such as local court discretion, opaque

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
procedures, or ad hoc restrictions—can undermine actual access, especially
when such barriers are imposed without the procedural safeguards required
by law (PUBLIC RECORDS AREN'T PUBLIC: SYSTEMIC BARRIERS TO
MEASURING COURT FUNCTIONING & EQUITY.).
Analysis
Presumption of Openness and Procedural Safeguards
The Texas legal framework is unequivocal: court records are presumed open
to the public, and any restriction on access must be justified by a specific,
serious, and substantial interest that outweighs this presumption. The
process for sealing records is not discretionary or informal; it is governed by
strict procedural requirements, including a written motion, public notice, a
public hearing, and a written order with specific findings (Tex. R. Civ. P. 76a;
Baker v. Bizzle, 687 S.W.3d 285 (Tex. 2024); Clear Channel v. United
Services Auto., 195 S.W.3d 129 (Tex. App. 2006)).
The rationale for these safeguards is to ensure transparency, accountability,
and public oversight of the judiciary. The public’s ability to monitor judicial
proceedings is especially critical in contexts where judicial impartiality is at
issue, such as after the filing of a recusal motion. Restricting access at such
a juncture, without following the required procedures, not only violates the
legal presumption of openness but also undermines public confidence in the
fairness and integrity of the judicial process (In re Meta Platforms, Inc.,
06-23-00045-CV (Tex. App. May 05, 2023); In re Cook, 629 S.W.3d 591 (Tex.
App. 2021)).
Statutory and Rule-Based Exceptions
The only recognized exceptions to this presumption are those grounded in
statute or rule. Juvenile and adoption records, for example, are confidential
by statute, and the expunction statute provides a narrow exception for
certain criminal records. In the absence of such statutory confidentiality, or
a sealing order entered after compliance with Rule 76a, court records must
remain open (Ex parte Border, NUMBER 13-17-00113-CV (Tex. App. May 31,
2018); Ex parte F.T.K., NUMBER 13-16-00535-CV (Tex. App. May 31, 2018)).
In the scenario described, there are no juvenile or adoption records, and no
motion to seal has been filed. Therefore, there is no statutory or procedural
basis for restricting access to the court records. The sudden imposition of
access restrictions, particularly after the filing of a recusal motion, is not
only unsupported by law but also raises the specter of improper motive—
namely, shielding judicial actions from public scrutiny at a moment when
transparency is most needed.
Prohibition on Ad Hoc or Unexplained Restrictions
Texas courts have repeatedly condemned the practice of restricting access
to court records without compliance with Rule 76a. Sealing or restricting
access without a motion, notice, hearing, and a written order with findings is

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
improper and undermines the public’s right of access. Courts and attorneys
have an affirmative duty to ensure that such improper restrictions do not
occur (In re Cook, 629 S.W.3d 591 (Tex. App. 2021); Rice v. Lewis Energy
Grp., No. 04-19-00234-CV (Tex. App. Oct 28, 2020)).
Even temporary or protective orders limiting access must be grounded in a
specific legal basis and must not be used as a substitute for the formal
sealing process required by Rule 76a (Clear Channel v. United Services
Auto., 195 S.W.3d 129 (Tex. App. 2006); Navasota Resources v. First Source
Texas, 206 S.W.3d 791 (Tex. App. 2006)).
Transparency and Public Oversight
The public’s right to access court records is not merely a procedural nicety;
it is a fundamental safeguard of the rule of law. Transparency enables the
public to monitor the exercise of judicial authority, ensures accountability,
and maintains the legitimacy of the judiciary. This is particularly important
in cases involving allegations of judicial bias or impropriety, such as those
involving recusal motions (Baker v. Bizzle, 687 S.W.3d 285 (Tex. 2024); In re
Dolcefino Commc'ns, 14-25-00555-CV (Tex. App. Aug 28, 2025)).
Sudden, unexplained restrictions on access—especially when coinciding with
contentious filings—undermine these values and create the appearance, if
not the reality, of impropriety. As secondary materials note, even when
records are de jure public, de facto barriers imposed by local court
discretion or opaque procedures can thwart actual access and accountability
(PUBLIC RECORDS AREN'T PUBLIC: SYSTEMIC BARRIERS TO
MEASURING COURT FUNCTIONING & EQUITY.).
Appellate and Federal Perspectives
Appellate courts have emphasized that the presumption of openness applies
at all levels of the judiciary, and that any restriction on access must be
justified, narrowly tailored, and subject to procedural safeguards. Federal
authorities, while not binding, reinforce the requirement that courts—not
parties—must undertake a transparent, record-specific balancing of
interests before restricting access, and must articulate reasons sufficient for
appellate review (In re Hill, 042215 SEC, 3-16383; Signed, Sealed,
Delivered? Fifth Circuit Finds Sealing Of Sensitive Information Requires Far
More Than A Protective Order).
Exceptions and Caveats
There are limited circumstances in which access to court records may be
lawfully restricted without a Rule 76a sealing order. These include records
that are confidential by statute (such as juvenile or adoption records), or
where another rule or court order—entered for a valid, articulated reason—
controls access. However, in the absence of such a basis, and where no
sealing motion or order has been entered, restrictions on access are
improper.

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
It is also important to note that not all documents filed with a court are
necessarily “court records” within the meaning of Rule 76a. However, orders
and opinions issued in the adjudication of a case may never be sealed, and
the presumption of openness applies broadly to most filings in civil cases
(Baker v. Bizzle, 687 S.W.3d 285 (Tex. 2024); In re Dolcefino Commc'ns,
14-25-00555-CV (Tex. App. Aug 28, 2025)).
Conclusion
In sum, the sudden restriction of access to court records in a Texas civil case
—especially after the filing of a recusal motion, without a sealing order, and
where no statutory confidentiality applies—is deeply problematic for
transparency. It contravenes the strong presumption of public access
enshrined in Texas law, violates mandatory procedural safeguards, and
undermines public confidence in the judiciary. The law requires that any
limitation on access be justified, narrowly tailored, and subject to public
notice, hearing, and a written order with findings. Bypassing these
requirements, particularly in the context of judicial recusal, erodes the
legitimacy of the judicial process and impedes the public’s ability to hold the
judiciary accountable.
Legal Authorities
Dallas Morning News v. Fifth Court of Appeals, 842 S.W.2d 655 (Tex. 1992)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
Under Rule 76a(1), court records 'are presumed to be open to the general
public.' Trial exhibits are unquestionably subject to this presumption. In
Texas, court records belong to the people, and the people may be denied
access to them only when a movant proves: (a) a specific, serious and
substantial interest which clearly outweighs: (1) this presumption of
openness; (2) any probable adverse effect that the sealing will have upon the
general public health or safety; (b) no less restrictive means than sealing
records will adequately and effectively protect the specific interest asserted.
Tex.R.Civ.P. 76a(1). ... [A]ccess to records in juvenile proceedings are limited
by statute. See TEXAS FAMILY CODE § 51.14. In sum, there is nothing in
our Constitution, laws, or procedure that gives the press and public
unlimited access to trial exhibits." ... "The specific explanation offered by the
majority for limiting freedom of information is, however, unpersuasive. ...
'documents filed in an action originally arising under the Family Code' are
excluded in Rule 76a(2)(a)(3) from the definition of 'court records' ... but
neither are they absolutely 'exempt' from disclosure. Rather, Rule 76a(9)
clearly provides that '[a]ccess to documents in court files not defined as
court records by this rule remains governed by existing law.' A court may
well benefit from looking to Rule 76a procedures and principles in
considering even those documents formally excluded from the Rule's
definition.

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
The case establishes that Texas court records, including trial exhibits, are
presumed open. To restrict access, a movant must satisfy Rule 76a’s
stringent standards and procedures (notice, hearing, findings). Juvenile/
adoption records are limited by statute, but otherwise, ad hoc restrictions
without a sealing motion contravene the presumption and process. Even
Family Code matters are not categorically exempt from disclosure; existing
law governs, and courts may still look to 76a principles. Thus, restricting
access after a recusal motion, absent a sealing motion or statutory basis,
undermines transparency and violates the procedural safeguards intended
to protect public access.
In re The City of Georgetown, 53 S.W.3d 328 (Tex. 2001)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
Section 552.022 provides that a governmental body must disclose completed
reports or evaluations 'unless the category of information is expressly made
confidential under other law.' Tex. Gov't Code § 552.022(b). ... (a) ... the
following categories of information are public information and not excepted
from required disclosure under this chapter unless they are expressly
confidential under other law: (1) a completed report, audit, evaluation, or
investigation ... (b) A court in this state may not order a governmental
body ... to withhold ... unless the category of information is expressly made
confidential under other law. ... We hold that if documents are privileged or
confidential under the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure or Texas Rules of
Evidence, they are within a 'category of information [that] is expressly made
confidential under other law' within the meaning of section 552.022 of the
Public Information Act.
Summary
The case establishes that public records must be disclosed unless a specific
statute, rule, or evidentiary/procedural privilege expressly makes them
confidential. Courts cannot order withholding absent such “other law.” By
analogy, restricting access to court records without a sealing order or
statutory confidentiality conflicts with Texas’s transparency framework,
which requires a legal basis to withhold.

Extract
we see no reason why the overarching principle of presumed openness
should apply at the trial court, but then vanish before an appellate court. To
the contrary, these are core constitutional principles... 'these procedures
serve our fundamental commitment to open courts, which is rooted in the
common law and the First Amendment. The public's right of access to
judicial proceedings 'is a fundamental element of the rule of law' because
'monitor[ing] the exercise of judicial authority' helps maintain[] the integrity
and legitimacy of an independent Judicial Branch.'
Summary
The passage affirms a presumptive right of public access to court records
and proceedings at both trial and appellate levels as a constitutional
principle. It indicates that procedures (like Rule 76a sealing mechanisms)
implement, rather than override, this presumption. Restricting access
without a proper sealing motion, findings, and compliance with procedural
safeguards conflicts with these principles, especially where no statutory
basis for confidentiality (e.g., juvenile/adoption) exists. Sudden restriction
coinciding with recusal motions undermines the public’s ability to monitor
judicial authority, raising transparency concerns.
Roane v. Dean, NO. 03-19-00308-CV (Tex. App. Apr 30, 2020)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Rule 76a provides the standard for sealing court records and provides that
court records 'are presumed to be open to the general public.' Tex. R. Civ. P.
76a(1). 'The party moving for the sealing order then has the burden to rebut
the presumption in order to seal the records.' ... Rule 76a also requires that
a motion to seal court records 'shall be decided by written order,' and the
sealing order shall state 'the specific reasons for finding and concluding
whether the showing required by paragraph 1, has been made.' Id. R.
76a(6)." ... "[S]ection 552.3221 ... does not apply to the Complaint in this
case that was not filed under the PIA. ... 'Information filed with the court
under this section does not constitute “court records” within the meaning of
Rule 76a[.]'
Summary
The case reaffirms that Texas court records are presumptively open; sealing
requires a motion, notice, hearing, and a written order with specific Rule
76a findings. It also clarifies that the PIA in-camera exception to Rule 76a is
narrow and inapplicable outside PIA suits. Thus, restricting access without a
Rule 76a-compliant process undermines the presumption of openness and
transparency.

Lindberg v. Callahan, NO. 01-19-00559-CV (Tex. App. Aug 13, 2020)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Rule 76a provides additional, stricter procedures for sealing documents that
qualify as 'court records.'... The procedures of rule 76a apply only to court
records as defined in the rule... Rule 76a states that certain 'court records,
as defined in this rule, are presumed to be open to the general public and
may be sealed only upon a showing of... a specific, serious and substantial
interest...' TEX. R. CIV. P. 76a(1). Relevant here, Rule 76a(2) defines 'court
records' as including 'all documents of any nature filed in connection with
any matter before any civil court, except'... 'Court records' also include
discovery, not filed of record, concerning matters that have a probable
adverse effect upon the general public health or safety... Thus, the
presumption of openness and the special procedures outlined in Rule 76a
apply only to 'court records' as defined in that rule.... Rule 76a(3) sets out
notice requirements... the movant 'shall post a public notice'... that 'a
hearing will be held in open court on a motion to seal court records'... 'any
person may intervene'... Rule 76a(4) provides the requirements for the
hearing, including that it be 'open to the public'... Rule 76a(6) provides
requirements for an order on a motion to seal court records." "Rule 76a is
not the only source of a trial court's authority to seal documents or provide
protection to parties during discovery." "We review both protective orders
and Rule 76a decisions under an abuse of discretion standard.
Summary
The passage confirms that Texas presumes court records are open and
requires strict, public procedures (motion, public notice, open hearing,
findings) to seal them under Rule 76a. It also clarifies that not all restricted
materials are “court records,” and courts may limit access via protective
orders without using Rule 76a when the materials aren’t “court records.”
Thus, if filed documents are being hidden without a Rule 76a process, that
raises transparency concerns unless the materials fall outside Rule 76a’s
definition and are properly covered by other authority.
Saucedo ex rel. I.S. v. El Paso Children's Hosp. Corp., 677 S.W.3d 62 (Tex.
App. 2023)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
First, any ruling removing court files from the public record is appealable
under Rule 76a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. See TEX. R. CIV. P.
76a(8) ('Any order (or portion of an order or judgment) relating to sealing or

=== PAGE 10 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
unsealing court records shall be deemed to be severed from the case and a
final judgment which may be appealed by any party or intervenor who
participated in the hearing preceding issuance of such order.'). ... The trial
court noted in the order that 'it has inherent power to limit the right of
public access to the Court's judicial records that contain information the
Court has declared to be confidential and privileged.' Moreover, it found that
Rule 76a sealing procedures did not apply because the challenged
documents were not 'court records' as that term is defined in Rule 76a(2)(a)
(2). ... Appellees assert the Exhibits are not court records because they fall
under the exception provided by Rule 76a(2)(a)(2), applicable to 'documents
in court files to which access is otherwise restricted by law.' ... We conclude
the information in the challenged exhibits is restricted by law and, pursuant
to the plain language of Rule 76a, they are not court records and not subject
to these requirements. ... Accordingly, we conclude the trial court did not
abuse its discretion in ordering the record redacted and sealed.
Summary
The case affirms that: (1) sealing orders are appealable under Rule 76a(8);
(2) Rule 76a procedures are required for “court records,” but not for
materials “to which access is otherwise restricted by law” under Rule 76a(2)
(a)(2); and (3) courts may rely on inherent authority plus statutory
confidentiality to remove/redact items not deemed “court records.” Thus, if a
Texas court restricts access without a Rule 76a motion/hearing, it is only
proper if the items fall within a statutory restriction; otherwise, bypassing
76a undermines transparency, notice, and the public’s right of access, and is
reversible.
Navasota Resources v. First Source Texas, 206 S.W.3d 791 (Tex. App. 2006)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Such agreements under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 11 were very common
prior to the adoption of Rule of Civil Procedure 76a, which now governs the
sealing of trial court records... The rule prohibits private agreements which
prevent the disclosure of information and documents absent strict
compliance with the rule... '[C]ourt records,' as defined by Rule 76a, 'are
presumed to be open to the general public.' ... [and] may be sealed only
upon a showing of all of the following: (a) a specific, serious and substantial
interest which clearly outweighs: (1) th[e] presumption of openness; (2) any
probable adverse effect that sealing will have upon the general public health
or safety; (b) no less restrictive means than sealing records will adequately
and effectively protect the public interest asserted... Before restricting
public access to filed court records, the court must comply with the
procedural requirements of the rule, including motion, posted notice, public
hearing, and public order... I do not find any indication in the record before
us that the trial court employed the special procedures of Rule 76a for
sealing court records. The trial court signed an unopposed protective order

=== PAGE 11 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
limiting disclosure of documents, and made no express findings on whether
those documents constituted court records. Therefore, I cannot rely upon
compliance with Rule 76a in the trial court to seal the brief or the
information that it contains on appeal as well.
Summary
The opinion explains that Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 76a governs sealing
court records, imposes a strong presumption of openness, and requires
motion, notice, public hearing, and findings. Private agreements or
protective orders are not substitutes. Restricting access without a Rule 76a
process undermines transparency and is improper. The appellate court will
not honor sealing absent proper 76a compliance below.
In re Dolcefino Commc&#39;ns, 14-25-00555-CV (Tex. App. Aug 28, 2025)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Most recently, our state supreme court stated that the public's general right
of access to judicial proceedings is a ''fundamental element of the rule of
law,' is recognized under the common law, constitutionally guaranteed, and
incorporated into our procedural rules requiring court proceedings and
court records to be open to the public." ... "Any limitations on media access
to court records in this divorce proceeding are not governed by rule 76a
sealing procedures,[] except that court orders can never be sealed.
Tex.R.Civ.P. 76a(1)." ... "Rule 76a ... allows non-parties to intervene as a
matter of right ... to challenge the sealing of 'court records.' ... the special
procedures of rule 76a apply only to the sealing of 'court records,' ... and
'documents filed in an action originally arising under the Family Code' are
excluded from the definition of 'court records.' ... Access to documents in
court files not defined as court records by rule 76a remain 'governed by
existing law.'" ... "Court orders and opinions are not included within rule
76a's definition of 'court records' ... and provides 'no court order or opinion
issued in the adjudication of a case may be sealed.'
Summary
The passages establish (1) a constitutionally and common-law grounded
presumption of public access to judicial proceedings and records; (2) Rule
76a’s sealing procedures generally, but their inapplicability to most Family
Code filings; (3) even in family matters, court orders and opinions cannot be
sealed; and (4) access restrictions without a proper sealing mechanism
contradict that presumption. If access began being restricted after a recusal
motion without a sealing order, that undermines transparency and likely
violates the open-courts principles and the explicit prohibition on sealing
orders/opinions.

portions of the court records are to be sealed.' ... 'Any order (or portion of an
order or judgment) relating to sealing or unsealing court records shall be
deemed to be severed from the case and a final judgment which may be
appealed...'" Also: "this is precisely the function of Rule 76a's provision for a
temporary sealing order—to protect the confidentiality of information until
the trial court rules on a pending motion to seal." And: "Any party filing any
motion or pleading... designated as Confidential shall file such pleading or
motion in a sealed envelope marked 'Temporary Seal.' ... any party wishing
to have such motion or pleading sealed must file a motion to seal in
accordance with T.R.C.P. 76a... In the event that no such motion to seal is
filed... any motion or pleading filed under Temporary Seal... shall be
unsealed by the Court as of the date of the hearing of such motion or
pleading.
Summary
The case explains Texas’s strong presumption of openness for court records
and the mandatory procedural safeguards: public motion, public notice,
public hearing, findings, and a publicly available sealing order. It also
explains the limited, affidavit-supported temporary sealing tool pending a
76a hearing, and that absent a timely 76a motion, materials filed under a
temporary seal must be unsealed. Thus, restricting access without a 76a
motion, notice, hearing, and order contravenes Rule 76a and undermines
transparency. If access became restricted after a recusal motion without any
76a process or a lawful basis “otherwise restricted by law,” that is
problematic and potentially improper.

Extract
Rule 76a was not followed with respect to sealing the court records... In
deciding whether or not to seal court records, the trial court must 'balance
the public's interest in open court proceedings against an individual
litigant's personal or proprietary interest in privacy.'... A trial court abuses
its discretion by sealing court records if the record does not show 'a specific,
serious and substantial interest which clearly outweighs this presumption of
openness.. . .'" "And the child's name and date of birth are considered
sensitive data under Rule 21c... The trial court was, therefore, required to
redact the child's name and date of birth from documents 'filed with a court'
unless the information is required to be included by a statute...
Summary
The opinion underscores (1) the presumption of open courts; (2) sealing
requires Rule 76a procedures and findings, and abuse of discretion occurs
without a specific, serious, substantial interest outweighing openness; (3)
redaction of sensitive data under Rule 21c is distinct from sealing and
limited to filed documents unless a statute requires inclusion. If records are
being restricted without a Rule 76a motion, notice, and findings—and absent
juvenile/adoption confidentiality—this undermines transparency and likely
contravenes Texas rules.
Houston Chronicle Pub. Co. v. Woods, 949 S.W.2d 492 (Tex. App. 1997)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The State argues '[a]lthough not expressly referenced in the State's motion
to seal the affidavits, its motion was presumptively governed by Rule 76a[]
for the reason that there is no other statute or rule in Texas (either civil or
criminal) which governs the sealing of court records.' ... Rule 76a... Other
court records, as defined in this rule, are presumed to be open to the
general public and may be sealed only upon a showing of all of the following:
(a) a specific, serious and substantial interest which clearly outweighs: (1)
this presumption of openness; ... (b) no less restrictive means than sealing
records will adequately and effectively protect the specific interest
asserted. ... 'For purposes of this rule, court records means: (a) all
documents of any nature filed in connection with any matter before any civil
court...' ... 'Access to documents in court files not defined as court records
by this rule remains governed by existing law.' ... 'The legislature directed
the supreme court to adopt rules regarding the sealing of "records in a civil
case."'

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
The passage underscores Texas’s strong presumption of open court records
and that sealing requires: a motion, notice, hearing, specific findings, and
proof that no less restrictive alternative will suffice. It also clarifies Rule 76a
is for civil records, implying that ad hoc sealing in other contexts must rest
on specific statutory authority. Where no juvenile/adoption confidentiality
applies and no sealing motion or order with findings exists, restricting
access diverges from the presumption of openness and required process,
raising transparency concerns—especially if the restriction coincides with
recusal litigation, suggesting potential misuse to shield proceedings without
meeting Rule 76a-like standards or any criminal-law analogue.
Baker v. Bizzle, 687 S.W.3d 285 (Tex. 2024)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
The public generally has a right to access judicial proceedings except for
those rare cases in which competing rights or interests outweigh the
public’s interest. This right, which 'is a fundamental element of the rule of
law,' is recognized under the common law, constitutionally guaranteed, and
incorporated into our procedural rules requiring court proceedings and
court records to be open to the public. In that vein, and particularly
germane here, Rule 76a(1) of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure provides
that '[n]o court order or opinion issued in the adjudication of a [civil] case
may be sealed.' If the court need not make a writing announcing its
adjudication available to the general public, that adjudication would
effectively be sealed contrary to the rule. … Although 'documents filed in an
action originally arising under the Family Code' are excluded from the
definition of 'court records' for purposes of Rule 76a(1)’s standard for
sealing court records, Rule 76a(1) is categorical in prohibiting the sealing of
any 'order or opinion issued in the adjudication of a [civil] case.' Discrete
exceptions may exist under other law, but no one has argued that the trial
court’s decision in this case may or must be made privately." "HouseCanary,
622 S.W.3d at 263-64; see Tex. Const. art. I, § 13 ('All courts shall be
open[.]')." "see also Tex. R. Jud. Admin. 12 … (public access to judicial
records).
Summary
The Court reaffirms a broad, constitutional and common-law presumption of
openness, codified in procedural rules. Rule 76a(1) categorically forbids
sealing orders/opinions in civil adjudications, with only discrete exceptions.
Hiding orders, opinions, or effectively preventing public access to the
adjudication without a proper sealing basis or order contradicts these
principles. Texas Rules of Judicial Administration 12 further underscore
public access to judicial records. Family Code carve-outs do not apply to
sealing orders/opinions, and no juvenile/adoption context exists here.

Mascilli v. State
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The State's motion to seal the March 28, 2024 supplemental clerk's record is
GRANTED. See Dall. Morning News v. Fifth Court of Appeals, 842 S.W.2d
655, 659 (Tex. 1992) ('Every court has supervisory power over its own
records and files, and access has been denied where court files might have
become a vehicle for improper purposes.' (quoting Nixon v. Warner
Commc'ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 598 (1978))). We ORDER the clerk of this
court to seal the March 28, 2024 supplemental clerk's record and ensure
that it 'shall not be available either on the internet or in other form without
court order' from this or a superior court. See Tex. R. App. P. 9.10(g).
Summary
Texas courts have authority to seal records, but the cited order shows it is
exercised via a formal motion, legal basis, and a court order, consistent with
Tex. R. App. P. 9.10(g). Dallas Morning News and Nixon recognize
supervisory power to restrict access to prevent improper uses, but do not
suggest blanket or informal restrictions without motion, findings, or an
order. Thus, sealing or restricting access absent a motion, findings, and an
order is inconsistent with the procedural framework highlighted by Mascilli
and Rule 9.10, raising transparency concerns.

The passage establishes a constitutional/common-law presumption that
judicial records are open, recognizes only narrow, statutorily defined
exceptions (e.g., expunction), and requires strict compliance with statute to

In re Cook, 629 S.W.3d 591 (Tex. App. 2021)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The trial court has not issued a rule 76a sealing order in this case. See TEX.
R. CIV. P. 76a. Yet these court records remain sealed in the trial court, the
court of appeals, and the supreme court. This should not happen, and it is
the duty of all attorneys and judges to make sure that it does not happen...
In particular, rule 76a provides that 'court records,' as defined by the rule,
are 'presumed to be open to the general public' and may only be sealed by
showing: (a) a specific, serious and substantial interest which clearly
outweighs: this presumption of openness... (b) no less restrictive means than
sealing records will adequately and effectively protect the specific interest
asserted... Additionally, leaving records unsealed in the trial court for
several months may result in waiver of the right to have the appellate record
sealed.
Summary
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 76a establishes a strong presumption of public
access to court records and requires a formal sealing order with specific
findings and the least-restrictive means before records can be sealed. In re
Cook condemns situations where records are sealed across court levels
without a Rule 76a order, stating "this should not happen" and imposing a
duty on judges and attorneys to prevent it. Appellate courts may seal to
protect jurisdiction in narrow circumstances, but absent a proper Rule 76a
order, sealing is improper, and delay or prior unsealed availability can waive
sealing. Thus, restricting access without a 76a order—especially triggered
after a recusal motion—undercuts transparency, violates the presumption of
openness, lacks required findings and process (notice, hearing), and risks
improper or retaliatory opacity.

Oryon Techs., Inc. v. Marcus, 429 S.W.3d 762 (Tex. App. 2014)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
There is no paramount right to immediate access to court records. Dallas
Morning News, 842 S.W.2d 655, 659 (Tex.1992) ('The dissent is apparently
of the view that the press and the public have an absolute right to
immediate physical access to all exhibits introduced into evidence and that
this right is paramount over all other rights. This is simply not true.').
Indeed, courts must tread cautiously in ordering disclosure of potentially
protected documents... 'A properly proven trade secret interest may
constitute a specific, serious, and substantial interest, which would justify
restricting access to the documents in question.' ... Courts of appeals are
authorized to issue orders to protect their jurisdiction over an appeal
pursuant to rule 76a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure... the Texas
Supreme Court has recognized that in cases where access to potentially
confidential documents is in question, 'preliminary disclosure would
compromise the effectiveness of any later sealing order, possibly even
mooting the controversy.' ... Appellants perfected a direct appeal of the
Unsealing Order pursuant to rule 76a(8) which provides that final orders
sealing or unsealing court records are to be treated as severed and final for
appellate purposes... Rule 24.4(c) ... authorizes this court to 'issue any
temporary orders necessary to preserve the parties' rights.' ... Although not
subject to the expedited time frames governing interlocutory appeals, in
most respects an appeal under rule 76a is more directly akin to an
interlocutory appeal than an appeal after final judgment.
Summary
The passage clarifies there is not an absolute, paramount right to immediate
access to court records, and courts may restrict access when specific,
serious interests (e.g., trade secrets) are properly shown. It also explains

=== PAGE 18 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
procedural mechanisms: sealing/unsealing is governed by Rule 76a, which
contemplates final, appealable orders and allows appellate courts to issue
temporary protective orders to preserve rights. It emphasizes that
premature disclosure can moot a sealing dispute, justifying temporary
restrictions. However, the passage does not authorize ad hoc or unexplained
restrictions without a Rule 76a process, notice, findings, and an order.
Therefore, while access can be limited lawfully, Texas law normally requires
compliance with Rule 76a procedures and articulated interests; sudden
access restrictions with no sealing motion, no juvenile/adoption basis, and
no order are problematic for transparency because they bypass the rule’s
notice, hearing, findings, and appellate safeguards.
Title Source, Inc. v. HouseCanary, Inc.
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 76a provides that court records 'are presumed
to be open to the general public' and may be sealed only upon a showing of,
inter alia, 'a specific, serious and substantial interest which clearly
outweighs... this presumption of openness[.]' ... TUTSA, however, requires a
trial court to 'preserve the secrecy of an alleged trade secret by reasonable
means.' 'There is a presumption in favor of granting protective orders to
preserve the secrecy of trade secrets.' ... TUTSA 'does not provide an
independent, self-contained pathway for sealing court records' and
'prescribes no procedures for parties or courts to follow in using these
means.' As a result, the Texas Supreme Court concluded that TUTSA 'leaves
much of Rule 76a in place' and does not displace Rule 76a's procedural
requirements. ... Those procedural requirements include, inter alia, a
showing that 'no less restrictive means than sealing records will adequately
and effectively protect the specific interest asserted.' ... [A] motion seeking
to seal court records 'shall be decided by written order, open to the public,
which shall state... the specific reasons for finding and concluding whether
the showing required by [Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 76a(1)] has been
made'.
Summary
The passages establish that (1) court records are presumptively open, (2)
sealing requires compliance with Rule 76a’s procedural safeguards,
including notice, an evidentiary showing, consideration of less restrictive
means, and a public written order stating specific reasons, and (3) even
when confidentiality interests exist (e.g., trade secrets under TUTSA), Rule
76a’s procedural transparency requirements are not displaced. Therefore,
restricting access to records without a proper Rule 76a motion, notice,
hearing, and a public order with specific reasons is contrary to Texas law
and undermines transparency.

Rice v. Lewis Energy Grp., No. 04-19-00234-CV (Tex. App. Oct 28, 2020)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Rule 76a.1 provides that 'court records, as defined in this rule, are
presumed to be open to the general public and may be sealed only upon a
showing of' 'a specific, serious and substantial interest which clearly
outweighs: (1) this presumption of openness; (2) any probable adverse effect
that sealing will have upon the general public health or safety;' and 'no less
restrictive means than sealing records will adequately and effectively
protect the specific interest asserted.' ... 'Court records may be sealed only
upon a party's written motion, which shall be open to public inspection.' ...
'A hearing, open to the public, on a motion to seal court records shall be
held in open court as soon as practicable, but not less than fourteen days
after the motion is filed and notice is posted.' ... Because these requirements
of Rules 76a.3 and 76a.4 were not satisfied, the trial court failed to apply the
law correctly and it abused its discretion by ordering the permanent sealing
of the court records in this case.
Summary
Texas Rule 76a presumes openness of court records and permits sealing
only via a publicly filed written motion, posted public notice, and a public
hearing, with specific findings that no less-restrictive means suffice. Rice
holds that failure to follow Rule 76a.3 and 76a.4 (public motion, posted
notice, verified filing of notice, and public hearing) is an abuse of discretion
and requires reversal of an order sealing records. This is directly applicable
where records are being restricted without a sealing motion, notice, or
hearing, and where no statutory confidentiality (e.g., juvenile/adoption)
applies.

against judiciary-specific rules (like the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure,
Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure, and the Texas Supreme Court’s Rules
for Judicial Administration, including Rule 12 on Public Access to Judicial
Records), rather than general PIA provisions. The passage does not itself set
standards for sealing or access; it points to the governing framework that
would control whether restricting access without a seal order is permissible.

Information; Examples

the following categories of information are public information and not
excepted from required disclosure unless made confidential under this
chapter or other law: ... information that is also contained in a public court
record; ... (b) A court in this state may not order a governmental body or an
officer for public information to withhold from public inspection any
category of public information described by Subsection (a) or to not produce
the category of public information for inspection or duplication, unless the
category of information is confidential under this chapter or other law.
Summary
- § 552.022(a) declares categories of information—including “information
that is also contained in a public court record”—as public and not excepted
from disclosure unless another law makes them confidential. - § 552.022(b)
restricts courts from ordering withholding of those categories absent
specific confidentiality under Chapter 552 or other law. - If the case has no
juvenile/adoption records and no seal order or confidentiality statute
applies, restricting access to filings/docket materials undermines Texas’s
Public Information Act presumption of openness and the statute’s specific
protection for court-record information. - This supports the argument that
sudden access restrictions after a recusal motion, without a sealing order or
applicable confidentiality law, are problematic for transparency and may be
legally improper.

staunchly juxtaposed with the realities of public data access... we define de
jure public data as data that is legally public... Despite court records being

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
de jure public, the current structure places the onus almost entirely on the
requestor... individuals who seek court records [must] have specialized
knowledge... sufficient financial resources... and follow whatever local
procedure the court deems necessary... Individuals have theoretical legal
access to these records, but substantial practical barriers prevent actual
access." ... "We found this variation significant... what we identified are
procedural variations in what should be a legally identical process across
jurisdictions... Having such widely varying processes makes accessing
records in certain jurisdictions virtually impossible, while the same record
can be much more easily obtained in [others].
Summary
The article explains that, although court records are legally public (de jure),
local court discretion and procedures can impose de facto barriers—costs,
specialized knowledge, and opaque or varying processes—that thwart
practical access. Sudden restriction of access without a sealing order
exemplifies a de facto barrier and undermines the public right of access and
accountability, particularly when driven by local court discretion after
contentious filings (e.g., recusal motions).

PUBLIC RIGHTS OF ACCESS UNDER THE FIRST AMENDMENT.
University of Pennsylvania Law Review - University of Pennsylvania,
Law School - Poliak, Shira - 2019-05-01
Extract
In various cases, journalists have sought access to records from grand jury
proceedings and search warrants; circuit courts have repeatedly held that
there is no First Amendment right of access to these records because the
proceedings are historically and presumptively secret. (82) ... In some
situations, courts have found that there is no longstanding tradition of
access, and accordingly denied a right of access, because the proceedings,
documents, or laws at issue were of recent creation. ... The court found that
there was no long tradition of access to orders required by the law because
the law was only enacted in 1986. ... In addition to a First Amendment right
of access, the Supreme Court has also recognized a common law public right
of access to inspect and copy judicial records and documents. See Nixon v.
Warner Comm’ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 597 (1978) ('It is clear that the
courts ... recognize a general right to inspect and copy public records...'). ...

applications and receipts because they are routinely filed with the clerk of
the court without seal, and because judicial records and documents have
historically been open to public inspection).

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
The passages outline: (1) the First Amendment “experience and logic” test—
access attaches where there is a historical tradition of openness and where
openness enhances process; (2) categories historically presumptively sealed
(e.g., grand jury) lack a First Amendment access right; (3) the Supreme
Court recognizes an independent common-law right to access judicial
records (Nixon); and (4) courts look to routine filing without seal as evidence
of historical openness. Applied here, if your case records were historically
open, are not within a traditionally secret category (juvenile/adoption/grand
jury), and no sealing order with findings issued, sudden post-recusal
restrictions undermine both the First Amendment logic prong (openness
promotes fairness, especially where judicial impartiality is challenged) and
the common-law presumption of access absent on-the-record findings.

Extract
Information transmitted to the court of appeals is presumptively public. . . .
Even nonparties, including the media, may intervene on behalf of the public
to oppose motions to seal. ... The working presumption is that judicial

records is so the public can understand the basis for judicial decisions, not
so the public or specific competitors can root around in a party’s files.
Summary
The cited article quotes the Fifth Circuit’s broad presumption against
sealing judicial records and underscores that appellate court filings are
presumptively public and that nonparties can challenge sealing. This
supports the argument that hiding entries/records without a seal order
contradicts the presumption of openness because the public must be able to
understand the basis for judicial decisions. While not Texas-specific, the
Fifth Circuit’s pronouncement is binding precedent in federal courts within
Texas and persuasive authority on transparency principles mirrored in Texas
law.

The basic principles are not contested. '[T]he courts of this country
recognize a general right to inspect and copy public records and documents,
including judicial records and documents.' Nixon v. Warner Commc'ns, Inc.,
435 U.S. 589, 597. Judicial records are thus 'strong[ly]' presumed to be
accessible by the general public. EEOC v. Nat'l Children's Ctr., Inc., 98 F.3d
1406, 1409 (D.C. Cir. 1996); Anderson v. Cryovac, Inc., 805 F.2d 1, 13 (1st
Cir. 1986). This presumption of access applies to matters raised in a
dispositive motion. Chi. Tribune Co. v. Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc., 263 F.3d
1304, 1312-13 (11th Cir. 2001).
Summary
The passage affirms a strong common-law presumption of public access to
judicial records, including materials tied to dispositive motions. Even though
it is from an SEC administrative decision, it relies on U.S. Supreme Court
and federal appellate authority articulating generally applicable
transparency principles. In Texas, these principles align with Texas Rules of
Civil Procedure and Texas Rules of Judicial Administration that require a
sealing motion, findings, and an order to restrict access. Thus, restricting
access without a seal order, especially after recusal motions and concerning
orders, runs counter to the presumption and undermines transparency.
Signed, Sealed, Delivered? Fifth Circuit Finds Sealing Of Sensitive
Information Requires Far More Than A Protective Order
Extract
[L]itigants sometimes have good reasons to file documents (or portions of
them) under seal, such as protecting trade secrets or the identities of
confidential informants. But most litigants have no incentive to protect the
public's right of access. That’s why judges, not litigants must undertake a
case-by-case, document-by-document, line-by-line balancing of the public’s
common law right of access against the interests favoring nondisclosure.
Sealings must be explained at a level of detail that will allow for this Court’s
review. And a court abuses its discretion if it makes no mention of the
presumption in favor of the public’s access to judicial records and fails to
articulate any reasons that would support sealing. Le, 990 F.3d at 419
(citations and quotations omitted) (emphasis added).
Summary
The passage states courts—not parties—must do a transparent, record-
specific balancing before restricting access; they must acknowledge the
presumption of public access and articulate reasons sufficient for review.
Unexplained or party-driven sealing (or equivalent access restrictions) risks
abuse of discretion. If access was unrestricted until a recusal motion and

then restricted without a seal motion or reasoned order, that contravenes
the required presumption and explanation, undermining transparency.
Rule 76a. Sealing Court Records
Extract
Court records may not be removed from court files except as permitted by
statute or rule. No court order or opinion issued in the adjudication of a case
may be sealed. Other court records, as defined in this rule, are presumed to
be open to the general public and may be sealed only upon a showing of all
of the following: (a) a specific, serious and substantial interest which clearly
outweighs: this presumption of openness; any probable adverse effect that
sealing will have upon the general public health or safety; (b) no less
restrictive means than sealing records will adequately and effectively
protect the specific interest asserted." "Court records may be sealed only
upon a party's written motion, which shall be open to public inspection. The
movant shall post a public notice... stating: that a hearing will be held in
open court on a motion to seal court records in the specific case; that any
person may intervene and be heard concerning the sealing of court records;
the specific time and place of the hearing; the style and number of the case;
a brief but specific description of both the nature of the case and the records
which are sought to be sealed; and the identity of the movant. Immediately
after posting such notice, the movant shall file a verified copy of the posted
notice with the clerk of the court in which the case is pending and with the
Clerk of the Supreme Court of Texas." "A hearing, open to the public, on a
motion to seal court records shall be held in open court..." "A motion
relating to sealing or unsealing court records shall be decided by written
order, open to the public, which shall state... the specific reasons... the
specific portions... and the time period..." "Any order (or portion of an order
or judgment) relating to sealing or unsealing court records shall be deemed
to be severed from the case and a final judgment which may be appealed by
any party or intervenor who participated in the hearing preceding issuance
of such order.
Summary
Rule 76a creates a strong presumption of openness for court records and
requires transparent process: a written, publicly accessible motion to seal;
public posting of notice; a public hearing; and a public written order with
specific findings and scope. It also forbids sealing orders or opinions
themselves. If access is being restricted without a motion, notice, hearing,
and findings, or if orders are hidden, that contravenes Rule 76a’s
transparency framework. The timing—restriction beginning after a recusal
motion—heightens concern because Rule 76a prohibits ad hoc or silent
sealing and requires less-restrictive alternatives and appealability.

criminal procedure, including Rule 76a, Texas Rules of Civil Procedure; (B) a
rule of appellate procedure; (C) a rule of evidence; (D) a rule of
administration; a state or federal court order not issued merely to thwart the
purpose of this rule; the Code of Judicial Conduct; Chapter 552, Government
Code, or another statute or provision of law; (b) records or information to
which Chapter 552, Government Code, is made inapplicable by statute, rule,
or other provision of law, other than Section 552.003(B); (c) records or
information relating to an arrest or search warrant or a supporting affidavit,
access to which is controlled by: a state or federal court rule, including a
rule of civil or criminal procedure, appellate procedure, or evidence; or
Summary
Rule 12’s public-access provisions do not apply if access to the records is
controlled by other governing authorities (procedural rules such as TRCP
76a for sealing, appellate rules, evidence rules, administrative rules), a valid
court order, the Code of Judicial Conduct, or statutes (including the Public
Information Act and any statute making it inapplicable). Thus, if access is
being restricted, transparency requires that the restriction be grounded in
one of these authorities (e.g., a Rule 76a sealing order or a specific statute).
Absent a juvenile/adoption basis or a sealing order, restricting access after a
recusal motion raises a transparency concern because it suggests access is
being limited outside the recognized mechanisms identified in Rule 12.3.
