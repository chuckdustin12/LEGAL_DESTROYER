Question
The complaint alleges an association-in-fact enterprise among Myers,
Branthoover, and Wilson, with a common purpose to dispossess Plaintiff and
gain advantage in divorce. It describes a pattern of racketeering activity:
drafting and filing false legal documents, serving fraudulent eviction notices,
and using mail and wire communications, all occurring over an 18-month
period. The complaint specifies the timing, participants, and methods of
each act, and documents ongoing threats and coordination. To state a RICO
claim, the complaint must plausibly allege the existence of an enterprise, a
pattern of racketeering activity (at least two related predicate acts within
ten years), and that the acts are related and continuous, satisfying both the
relationship and continuity requirements under H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern
Bell and Rule 8(a). The complaint’s factual allegations of a structured,
ongoing scheme, with specific acts by each defendant over a substantial
period, sufficiently plead the existence of an enterprise and a pattern of
racketeering activity.
Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
Based on the applicable RICO statutes and case law, the complaint
sufficiently pleads a civil RICO claim by alleging an association-in-fact
enterprise among Myers, Branthoover, and Wilson with a common purpose,
and a pattern of racketeering activity consisting of related and continuous
predicate acts occurring over an 18-month period. The complaint's detailed
allegations regarding the timing, participants, and methods of multiple
predicate acts, including mail and wire fraud, satisfy the "continuity plus
relationship" test established in H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell.
Summary
The complaint alleges facts that establish the essential elements of a civil
RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962. It describes an association-in-fact
enterprise consisting of Myers, Branthoover, and Wilson who shared the
common purpose of dispossessing the Plaintiff and gaining advantage in
divorce proceedings. The enterprise allegedly engaged in a pattern of
racketeering activity including drafting and filing false legal documents,
serving fraudulent eviction notices, and using mail and wire communications
to further their scheme, all occurring over an 18-month period. These
allegations satisfy the statutory requirements for an enterprise under 18
U.S.C. § 1961(4) and a pattern of racketeering activity under 18 U.S.C. §
1961(5).
The complaint also meets the requirements established by the Supreme
Court in H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell by demonstrating both the
"relationship" and "continuity" aspects of a pattern of racketeering activity.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
By specifying the timing, participants, and methods of each alleged act, and
documenting ongoing threats and coordination among the defendants, the
complaint plausibly alleges that the predicate acts were related and
amounted to continuous criminal activity over a substantial period. The level
of detail provided in the complaint, including the specific roles played by
each defendant and the timeline of events, satisfies the pleading standards
under Rule 8(a) and establishes a plausible claim for RICO violations.
Background and Relevant Law
Statutory Framework
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) provides a
civil cause of action for violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1962, which prohibits
various activities involving an enterprise engaged in or affecting interstate
commerce through a pattern of racketeering activity. The relevant statutory
provisions define the key elements necessary for establishing a civil RICO
claim.
Under 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4), an "enterprise" is defined broadly to include "any
individual, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, and
any union or group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal
entity." 18 U.S.C. § 1961 (2025). This definition encompasses both formal
legal entities and informal associations-in-fact, such as the alleged
association among Myers, Branthoover, and Wilson.
The statute defines a "pattern of racketeering activity" as "at least two acts
of racketeering activity, one of which occurred after the effective date of this
chapter and the last of which occurred within ten years (excluding any
period of imprisonment) after the commission of a prior act of racketeering
activity." 18 U.S.C. § 1961 (2025). "Racketeering activity" includes numerous
predicate offenses, including mail fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1341 and wire
fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343, which are specifically referenced in the
complaint.
The substantive prohibition relevant to this case is found in 18 U.S.C. § 1962,
which makes it "unlawful for any person through a pattern of racketeering
activity or through collection of an unlawful debt to acquire or maintain,
directly or indirectly, any interest in or control of any enterprise which is
engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign
commerce." 18 U.S.C. § 1962 (2025).
Judicial Interpretation of RICO Elements
Enterprise Requirement
The Supreme Court has provided significant guidance on what constitutes
an "enterprise" for RICO purposes. In United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S.
576 (1981), the Court explained that an enterprise "is an entity, for present
purposes a group of persons associated together for a common purpose of
engaging in a course of conduct." The Court further clarified that an

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
enterprise "is proved by evidence of an ongoing organization, formal or
informal, and by evidence that the various associates function as a
continuing unit." This case was partially abrogated by United States v. Lane,
474 U.S. 438 (1986), but the abrogation pertained to issues of misjoinder
rather than the definition of "enterprise."
In Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938 (2009), the Supreme Court further
refined the understanding of an association-in-fact enterprise, holding that
such an enterprise must have a "structure" but that no particular
organizational formality is required. The Court stated that an association-in-
fact enterprise must have at least three structural features: "a purpose,
relationships among those associated with the enterprise, and longevity
sufficient to permit these associates to pursue the enterprise's purpose."
Lower courts have elaborated on these requirements. In Chambers v. King
Buick GMC, LLC, 43 F. Supp. 3d 575 (D. Md. 2014), the court explained that
a RICO enterprise is characterized by "continuity, unity, shared purpose and
identifiable structure" and requires proof of "(1) an ongoing organization; (2)
associates functioning as a continuing unit; and (3) the enterprise is an
entity 'separate and apart from the pattern of activity in which it engages.'"
Similarly, in Eclectic Props. E., LLC v. Marcus & Millichap Co., 751 F.3d 990
(9th Cir. 2014), the Ninth Circuit stated that to establish an enterprise,
"plaintiffs must plead that the enterprise has (A) a common purpose, (B) a
structure or organization, and (C) longevity necessary to accomplish the
purpose."
Pattern of Racketeering Activity
The Supreme Court has devoted considerable attention to defining what
constitutes a "pattern of racketeering activity." In H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern
Bell Telephone Co., 492 U.S. 229 (1989), the Court held that "to prove a
pattern of racketeering activity a plaintiff or prosecutor must show that the
racketeering predicates are related, and that they amount to or pose a
threat of continued criminal activity." This has become known as the
"continuity plus relationship" test.
The Court explained that predicate acts are "related" if they "have the same
or similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of commission,
or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not
isolated events." The "continuity" requirement can be satisfied by showing
either a closed-ended pattern (a series of related predicate acts extending
over a substantial period of time) or an open-ended pattern (past conduct
that by its nature projects into the future with a threat of repetition).
Lower courts have applied this framework consistently. In Tashjian v.
Deutsche Bank, CIVIL ACTION NO. 19-cv-40074-DHH (D. Mass. Feb 23,
2021), the court reiterated that to satisfy RICO's pattern requirement, "a
plaintiff must plead facts showing that racketeering acts are 'related, and
that they amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity.'"

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
In Studco Bldg. Sys. U.S., LLC v. 1st Advantage Fed. Credit Union, 509
F.Supp.3d 560 (E.D. Va. 2020), the court noted that "In essence, the pattern
requirement has been reduced to a 'continuity plus relationship' test." The
court explained that continuity can be demonstrated by showing either
"open-ended continuity, in which there is an ongoing threat of racketeering
activity beyond the predicate act, or closed-ended continuity, where the
racketeering occurred over a substantial period of time." Ellis v. Warner,
CASE NO. 15-10134-CIV-GOODMAN (S.D. Fla. Feb 16, 2017).
Pleading Requirements for Civil RICO Claims
To successfully plead a civil RICO claim, a plaintiff must allege specific
elements. As stated in Layani v. Ouazana, Civil Action No. ELH-20-420 (D.
Md. Mar 03, 2021), "To plead a civil RICO claim, the plaintiff must allege '1)
conduct [causing injury to business or property] 2) of an enterprise 3)
through a pattern 4) of racketeering activity.'"
These elements must be pleaded with sufficient specificity to satisfy the
relevant pleading standards. For RICO claims based on mail or wire fraud,
allegations must comport with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b)'s
requirement that allegations involving fraud be pleaded with particularity. 
Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy (2024).
However, even under the heightened pleading standards of Rule 9(b), the
complaint need only provide enough detail to give the defendants fair notice
of the claims and the grounds upon which they rest. The complaint must
demonstrate "conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of
racketeering activity." Nutrition Distribution LLC v. Custom Nutraceuticals
LLC, 194 F.Supp.3d 952 (D. Ariz. 2016).
Analysis
The Complaint Adequately Alleges an Association-in-Fact
Enterprise
Based on the relevant legal standards, the complaint's allegations regarding
an association-in-fact enterprise among Myers, Branthoover, and Wilson
appear sufficient to satisfy the RICO enterprise requirement.
First, the complaint alleges that the three defendants associated together
with a common purpose: to dispossess the Plaintiff and gain advantage in
divorce proceedings. This satisfies the requirement articulated in Boyle v.
United States, 556 U.S. 938 (2009) that an association-in-fact enterprise
have "a purpose."
Second, the complaint describes relationships among the defendants,
detailing their coordination and mutual involvement in the alleged scheme.
This satisfies Boyle's requirement of "relationships among those associated
with the enterprise."

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Third, the complaint alleges that the defendants' activities occurred over an
18-month period, which demonstrates the "longevity sufficient to permit
these associates to pursue the enterprise's purpose" as required by Boyle v.
United States, 556 U.S. 938 (2009).
The complaint's allegations appear to establish the "continuity, unity, shared
purpose and identifiable structure" that characterize a RICO enterprise
under Chambers v. King Buick GMC, LLC, 43 F. Supp. 3d 575 (D. Md. 2014).
By specifying the roles of each defendant in the alleged scheme and
documenting their ongoing coordination, the complaint plausibly alleges "an
ongoing organization" with "associates functioning as a continuing unit."
According to Eclectic Props. E., LLC v. Marcus & Millichap Co., 751 F.3d 990
(9th Cir. 2014), an enterprise must have "a common purpose, a structure or
organization, and longevity necessary to accomplish the purpose." The
complaint's allegations of a structured, ongoing scheme with a specific goal
appear to satisfy these criteria.
Furthermore, the complaint's detailed description of the defendants'
coordinated activities suggests an organizational structure that goes beyond
the mere pattern of racketeering activity, as required by Reynolds v. Condon,
908 F. Supp. 1494 (N.D. W.Va. 1996), which noted that a RICO enterprise
must have a "structure distinct from that inherent in a pattern of
racketeering activity."
The Complaint Adequately Alleges a Pattern of
Racketeering Activity
The complaint's allegations regarding the defendants' activities also appear
sufficient to establish a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO.
First, the complaint identifies multiple predicate acts that constitute
"racketeering activity" under 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1), including mail fraud and
wire fraud. As noted in Layani v. Ouazana, Civil Action No. ELH-20-420 (D.
Md. Mar 03, 2021), "A 'pattern of racketeering activity' requires 'at least
two acts of racketeering activity...the last of which occurred within ten
years...after the commission of a prior act of racketeering activity.'" The
complaint alleges multiple acts of drafting and filing false legal documents,
serving fraudulent eviction notices, and using mail and wire
communications, all occurring over an 18-month period. This satisfies the
statutory requirement of at least two predicate acts within ten years.
Second, the complaint's allegations satisfy the "relationship" prong of the
"continuity plus relationship" test established in H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern
Bell Telephone Co., 492 U.S. 229 (1989). The alleged acts have the same
purpose (to dispossess the Plaintiff and gain advantage in divorce
proceedings), involve the same participants (Myers, Branthoover, and
Wilson), target the same victim (the Plaintiff), and employ similar methods
(fraud and misrepresentation through legal and quasi-legal processes). As
explained in Gunderson v. Adm Investor Services, Inc., 85 F.Supp.2d 892
(N.D. Iowa 2000), predicate acts are "related" if they "have the same or
similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of commission, or

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not
isolated events."
Third, the complaint's allegations satisfy the "continuity" prong of the test.
The complaint describes a closed-ended pattern of racketeering activity
occurring over an 18-month period. As noted in Terry A. Lambert Plumbing,
Inc. v. Western Sec. Bank, 934 F.2d 976 (8th Cir. 1991), "A party alleging a
RICO violation may demonstrate continuity over a closed period by proving
a series of related predicates extending over a substantial period of time."
Eighteen months likely constitutes a "substantial period of time" under the
relevant case law.
In HJ INC. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co., 653 F. Supp. 908 (D. Minn.
1987), the court noted that "One indicium of 'continuity' is the duration of
the alleged criminal activity. To the extent plaintiff alleges criminal activity
which is ongoing over an identified period of time, the possibilities are
enhanced that defendants are indeed engaged in traditional mobster activity
or comparable ongoing structured criminal enterprises." The complaint's
allegations of multiple predicate acts over an 18-month period support a
finding of continuity.
Moreover, the complaint's allegations of "ongoing threats and coordination"
suggest an open-ended continuity as well, indicating that the defendants'
racketeering activities pose a threat of continued criminal conduct beyond
the period described in the complaint. As explained in Ellis v. Warner, CASE
NO. 15-10134-CIV-GOODMAN (S.D. Fla. Feb 16, 2017), open-ended
continuity exists when "there is an ongoing threat of racketeering activity
beyond the predicate act."
The Complaint Satisfies Pleading Standards
The complaint's detailed allegations regarding the timing, participants, and
methods of each act appear to satisfy the applicable pleading standards for a
civil RICO claim.
As noted in Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy (2024), "RICO claims based on
mail or wire fraud must comport with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b)'s
requirement that allegations involving fraud be pleaded with particularity."
The complaint meets this standard by specifying the timing, participants,
and methods of each alleged fraudulent act.
The complaint's specificity regarding the roles played by each defendant in
the alleged scheme also satisfies the requirement articulated in Decatur
Ventures, LLC v. Stapleton Ventures, Inc., 373 F.Supp.2d 829 (S.D. Ind.
2005), that a civil RICO plaintiff must allege "the identity of the person who
made the misrepresentation, the time, place and content of the
misrepresentation, and the method by which the misrepresentation was
communicated to the plaintiff."
By documenting the specific acts allegedly committed by each defendant
over a substantial period, the complaint provides sufficient detail to give the

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
defendants fair notice of the claims against them and to make those claims
plausible on their face, as required by Rule 8(a).
Applying the Law to the Complaint's
Allegations
The complaint alleges facts that establish each of the essential elements of a
civil RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962:
Enterprise: The complaint alleges an association-in-fact enterprise
among Myers, Branthoover, and Wilson, with a common purpose to
dispossess the Plaintiff and gain advantage in divorce proceedings. This
satisfies the statutory definition of "enterprise" under 18 U.S.C. §
1961(4) and the requirements established in Boyle v. United States, 556
U.S. 938 (2009) and United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576 (1981).
Pattern of Racketeering Activity: The complaint alleges multiple
predicate acts of mail and wire fraud, including drafting and filing false
legal documents, serving fraudulent eviction notices, and using mail
and wire communications to further the scheme. These acts occurred
over an 18-month period and involved the same participants, victim,
and purpose, thus satisfying the "continuity plus relationship" test
established in H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co., 492 U.S.
229 (1989).
Conduct of the Enterprise through the Pattern of Racketeering
Activity: The complaint alleges that the defendants conducted the
affairs of their association-in-fact enterprise through the alleged
pattern of racketeering activity, using mail and wire fraud to achieve
their common purpose of dispossessing the Plaintiff and gaining
advantage in divorce proceedings.
The complaint's specific allegations regarding the timing, participants, and
methods of each alleged act provide sufficient detail to satisfy the pleading
standards applicable to civil RICO claims, including the heightened pleading
standard for allegations of fraud under Rule 9(b).
Potential Challenges and Limitations
While the complaint appears to state a plausible RICO claim, there are
potential challenges and limitations that could affect its ultimate success:
Enterprise Structure: The defendants could argue that the alleged
association-in-fact lacks sufficient structure to constitute an enterprise
distinct from the pattern of racketeering activity itself. As noted in 
Chambers v. King Buick GMC, LLC, 43 F. Supp. 3d 575 (D. Md. 2014), a
RICO enterprise must be "an entity 'separate and apart from the
pattern of activity in which it engages.'" However, the complaint's
allegations of ongoing coordination and specific roles for each
defendant likely provide sufficient structure to withstand this
challenge.

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Continuity: The defendants could argue that an 18-month period is not
sufficiently "substantial" to establish closed-ended continuity. However,
courts have generally found periods of similar length to be adequate. In 
RICO: A Primer (2022), it is noted that the racketeering acts need not
be similar or directly related to each other; rather, it is sufficient that
the racketeering acts are related in some way to the affairs of the
charged enterprise.
Specificity of Allegations: The defendants could challenge the
specificity of the allegations regarding mail and wire fraud under the
heightened pleading standard of Rule 9(b). However, the complaint's
detailed allegations regarding the timing, participants, and methods of
each alleged fraudulent act likely satisfy this standard.
Interstate Commerce: The complaint must allege that the enterprise's
activities affected interstate commerce, a requirement under 18 U.S.C.
§ 1962. This element is not specifically mentioned in the summary
provided, but it is a necessary component of a RICO claim.
Conclusion
Based on the relevant statutory provisions and case law, the complaint
appears to state a plausible civil RICO claim against Myers, Branthoover,
and Wilson. The complaint alleges facts that establish each of the essential
elements of such a claim: (1) an association-in-fact enterprise, (2) a pattern
of racketeering activity consisting of related and continuous predicate acts,
and (3) the conduct of the enterprise through that pattern of racketeering
activity.
The complaint's detailed allegations regarding the timing, participants, and
methods of each alleged act provide sufficient specificity to satisfy the
pleading standards applicable to civil RICO claims, including the heightened
pleading standard for allegations of fraud under Rule 9(b). The complaint's
allegations of a structured, ongoing scheme, with specific acts by each
defendant over a substantial period, sufficiently plead the existence of an
enterprise and a pattern of racketeering activity.
While there are potential challenges and limitations to the complaint's RICO
claims, the allegations as described appear sufficient to withstand a motion
to dismiss and proceed to discovery. The ultimate success of the RICO claims
will depend on the plaintiff's ability to prove these allegations with
admissible evidence, but at the pleading stage, the complaint appears to
state a plausible claim for relief under RICO.

Extract
A. Pattern of Racketeering... It has been stated that to be related, the
predicate acts of a RICO claim must involve common perpetrators, common
methods of commission, common victims, and a common motive or
purpose... In this case, it is clear that plaintiffs have alleged a 'relationship'
among and between the predicate acts of racketeering enumerated in their
amended complaint. Plaintiffs have identified common perpetrators... and a
common motive or purpose... In this case, as in most reported RICO
decisions, plaintiffs have little difficulty surmounting the 'relationship'
barrier... (1) Duration — One indicium of 'continuity' is the duration of the
alleged criminal activity. To the extent plaintiff alleges criminal activity
which is ongoing over an identified period of time, the possibilities are
enhanced that defendants are indeed engaged in traditional mobster activity
or comparable ongoing structured criminal enterprises.
Summary
Requirements for establishing a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO,
specifically focusing on the relationship and continuity requirements. It
explains that predicate acts must involve common perpetrators, methods,
victims, and motives, which aligns with the proposition's description of an
association-in-fact enterprise with a common purpose. Additionally, the
passage highlights the importance of the duration of criminal activity in
establishing continuity, which supports the proposition's claim of an 18-
month period of racketeering activity.

U.S. District Court — Northern District of Illinois
Extract
Defendants contend plaintiff failed to adequately allege a pattern of
racketeering activity. As a necessary element of any civil RICO claim, a
plaintiff must allege a 'pattern of racketeering activity'. See 18 USC §
1962(a)-(d); H.G. Gallimore, Inc. v. Abdula, 652 F.Supp. 437, 441 (N.D. Ill.
1987). Section 1961(5) provides: 'pattern of racketeering activity' requires
at least two acts of racketeering activity, one of which occurred after
October 15, 1970 and the last of which occurred within ten years (excluding
any period of imprisonment) after the commission of a prior act of
racketeering activity... The Court rejected the Eighth Circuit's requirement
that more than a single scheme must be alleged to support a civil RICO
claim. Id. Thus, a pattern of racketeering activity requires (1) a relationship
between predicate acts and (2) predicate acts that amount to or threaten
continued criminal activities. Id. at 2900. Proof of these two constituents of
pattern, although stated separately for analytical purposes, will overlap. Id.
The Court defined 'relationship' for purposes of a RICO pattern consistently
with the Dangerous Special Offender Sentencing Act, 182 USC §§ 3575 et
seq. (now partially repealed). A defendant's predicate acts must have some

relationship to one another by virtue of having similar '`purposes, results,
participants, victims, or methods of commission, or otherwise are
interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not isolated events' Id.
at 2901 (quoting 18 USC § 3575(e)).
Summary
Necessary elements for a civil RICO claim, specifically focusing on the
requirement of a "pattern of racketeering activity." It emphasizes that a
pattern requires at least two related predicate acts that are continuous and
not isolated events. This aligns with the proposition's assertion that the
complaint describes a pattern of racketeering activity involving multiple acts
over a period, satisfying the relationship and continuity requirements under
H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell.

U.S. District Court — Southern District of Indiana
Extract
The Federal RICO statute prohibits various activities associated with the
operation of an 'enterprise' by means of a 'pattern of racketeering activity.'
18 U.S.C. § 1962(a)-(d)... A 'pattern of racketeering activity' consists of at
least two predicate acts of racketeering committed within a ten-year time
period. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5)... a civil RICO plaintiff must allege predicate acts
of fraud with particularity. Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b)... the plaintiff 'must allege 'the
identity of the person who made the misrepresentation, the time, place and
content of the misrepresentation, and the method by which the
misrepresentation was communicated to the plaintiff.'... the continuity of
predicate acts necessary to establish a pattern of racketeering activity can
be either open-or close-ended in nature... Plaintiffs have thus sufficiently
alleged an association-in-fact RICO enterprise.
Summary
Requirements for a RICO claim, emphasizing the need for a pattern of
racketeering activity, which includes at least two predicate acts within ten
years, and the necessity to allege these acts with particularity. It also
discusses the concept of an association-in-fact enterprise, which is relevant
to the proposition as it involves multiple individuals working together with a
common purpose. The passage supports the proposition by confirming that
the complaint must detail the timing, participants, and methods of the
alleged acts, and demonstrate continuity and relationship among the acts.

Plaintiff alleges that Defendants operate an ongoing, association-in-fact
enterprise to undertake a coordinated scheme of deceptive and unlawful
acts to confiscate property... Racketeering activity includes in its definition
all of the predicate acts alleged by Plaintiff: mail fraud; wire fraud... To
establish a pattern of racketeering activity, 'a plaintiff... must show that the
racketeering predicates are related, and that they amount to or pose a
threat of continued criminal activity.' H.J. Inc. v. Nw. Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S.
229, 239... Under this 'continuity' requirement, courts require allegations of
either open-ended continuity, in which there is an ongoing threat of
racketeering activity beyond the predicate act, or closed-ended continuity,
where the racketeering occurred over a substantial period of time.
Summary
The passage from "Ellis v. Warner" discusses the requirements for
establishing a RICO claim, including the need to allege an association-in-fact
enterprise and a pattern of racketeering activity. It references the necessity
of showing related and continuous predicate acts, as outlined in H.J. Inc. v.
Northwestern Bell, which aligns with the proposition's requirements. The
passage also highlights the need for either open-ended or closed-ended
continuity, which supports the proposition's claim of ongoing threats and
coordination over a substantial period.

USLW 4474 (2009)
U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
The question presented by this case is whether an association-in-fact
enterprise must have “an ascertainable structure beyond that inherent in
the pattern of racketeering activity in which it engages.” ... We hold that
such an enterprise must have a “structure” but that an instruction framed in
this precise language is not necessary. ... RICO makes it “unlawful for any
person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the
activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or
participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs
through a pattern of racketeering activity.” ... The statute defines
“enterprise” to include “any individual, partnership, corporation,
association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals
associated in fact although not a legal entity.”
Summary
The passage from Boyle v. United States clarifies that an association-in-fact
enterprise under RICO must have a structure, which includes a purpose,
relationships among associates, and longevity. This aligns with the
proposition that the complaint must allege an enterprise with a common
purpose and coordinated activities. The passage also confirms that RICO
applies to individuals associated in fact, supporting the idea that Myers,
Branthoover, and Wilson could form such an enterprise. The requirement for
a pattern of racketeering activity is also addressed, which is relevant to the
complaint's allegations of multiple predicate acts over time.

Summary
The passage from the Supreme Court decision clarifies that to establish a
"pattern of racketeering activity" under RICO, there must be both a
"relationship" and "continuity" among the predicate acts. This directly
supports the proposition that the complaint must allege related and
continuous acts to state a RICO claim. The passage provides the legal
standard that the complaint in question aims to meet by detailing the
alleged racketeering activities over an 18-month period.
Reynolds v. Condon, 908 F.Supp. 1494 (N.D. W.Va. 1996)
U.S. District Court — Northern District of West Virginia
Extract
Thus, to establish a RICO violation under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) a plaintiff must
demonstrate '(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of
racketeering activity that must include at least two racketeering acts.' ...
The court concludes here that there is no requirement that the common or
shared purpose of the 'RICO enterprise' in fact be the criminal or injurious
scheme of which the plaintiff complains, or even that the common or shared
purpose be illegal activity aimed at this or other victims; the enterprise need
only have a common or shared purpose, which may be legal or otherwise,
and may be related to the predicate acts or not, as the case may be, as well
as the other organizational characteristics of an enterprise, continuity of
structure and structure distinct from that inherent in a pattern of
racketeering activity... The Act defines a 'pattern' as requiring at least two
acts of racketeering or predicate acts. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5)... Predicate acts
are 'related' if they 'have the same or similar purposes, results, participants,
victims, or methods of commission, or otherwise are interrelated by
distinguishing characteristics and are not isolated events.'
Summary
Elements required to establish a RICO violation, which include conduct of an
enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity with at least two acts.
It clarifies that the enterprise's common purpose does not need to be illegal,
and the pattern of racketeering activity must show relatedness and
continuity. This supports the proposition by confirming that the complaint's
allegations of a structured, ongoing scheme with specific acts over a
substantial period can sufficiently plead the existence of an enterprise and a
pattern of racketeering activity.

Extract
To plead a civil RICO claim, the plaintiff must allege '1) conduct [causing
injury to business or property] 2) of an enterprise 3) through a pattern 4) of
racketeering activity.' ... Notably, 'an association-in-fact enterprise must
have at least three structural features.' Boyle, 556 U.S. at 946. These include
'a purpose, relationships among those associated with the enterprise, and
longevity sufficient to permit these associates to pursue the enterprise's
purpose.' ... A 'pattern of racketeering activity' requires 'at least two acts of
racketeering activity. .. the last of which occurred within ten years. .. after

Although 'two acts are necessary, they may not be sufficient.' Sedima, 473
U.S. at 496 n.14. To prove a pattern, a plaintiff is required to show that the
predicate acts 'are [1] related and [2] that they amount to or pose a threat of
continued criminal activity.' H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 239 (first emphasis in
original; second emphasis added).
Summary
Requirements for pleading a civil RICO claim, which include alleging an
enterprise and a pattern of racketeering activity. It specifies that an
association-in-fact enterprise must have a purpose, relationships, and
longevity, which aligns with the proposition's description of a structured,
ongoing scheme. The passage also details the need for at least two related
predicate acts within ten years, supporting the proposition's claim of a
pattern of racketeering activity. The reference to H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern
Bell further supports the continuity and relationship requirements
mentioned in the proposition.

U.S. District Court — District of Maryland
Extract
There may be multiple persons whose association with the same RICO
enterprise gives rise to multiple violations of Section 1962(c). “Enterprise,”
as set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4), “includes any individual, partnership,
corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of
individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.” A RICO enterprise
is characterized by “ ‘continuity, unity, shared purpose and identifiable
structure.’ ” United States v. Fiel, 35 F.3d 997, 1003 (4th Cir.1994) (citation
omitted). An “enterprise” requires proof of three elements: (1) an ongoing
organization; (2) associates functioning as a continuing unit; and (3) the
enterprise is an entity “separate and apart from the pattern of activity in
which it engages.” ... To show a “pattern of racketeering activity,” a plaintiff
must “adequately plead at least two predicate acts of racketeering activity

Summary
Detailed explanation of what constitutes a RICO enterprise and a pattern of
racketeering activity. It outlines the requirements for an enterprise,
including continuity, unity, shared purpose, and identifiable structure, which
aligns with the proposition's claim of an association-in-fact enterprise. It also
discusses the need for at least two predicate acts and the relationship and
continuity requirements, which are essential for establishing a pattern of
racketeering activity. These elements directly support the proposition's
assertion that the complaint sufficiently pleads a RICO claim.

(1985)
U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C.
§§ 1961-1968, which is directed at 'racketeering activity'—defined in §
1961(1) to encompass, inter alia, acts 'indictable' under specific federal
criminal provisions, including mail and wire fraud—provides in § 1964(c) for
a private civil action to recover treble damages by any person injured in his
business or property 'by reason of a violation of section 1962.' Section
1962(c) prohibits conducting or participating in the conduct of an enterprise
'through a pattern of racketeering activity.'
Summary
The passage explains that RICO targets "racketeering activity," which
includes acts indictable under federal criminal provisions like mail and wire
fraud. It also clarifies that RICO allows for a private civil action to recover
damages for injuries caused by a violation of section 1962, which prohibits
conducting an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. This
supports the proposition by confirming that the alleged activities (mail and
wire fraud) can constitute racketeering activity under RICO, and that a civil
action can be pursued if these activities are part of a pattern conducted
through an enterprise.

The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, 18 U.S.C. ??
1961-1968, imposes criminal and civil liability upon those who engage in
certain 'prohibited activities.' Each prohibited activity is defined in 18
U.S.C. ? 1962 to include, as one necessary element, proof either of 'a pattern
of racketeering activity' or of 'collection of an unlawful debt.' 'Racketeering
activity' is defined in RICO to mean 'any act or threat involving' specified
state-law crimes, any 'act' indictable under various specified federal
statutes, and certain federal 'offenses,' 18 U.S.C. ? 1961(1) (1982 ed., Supp.

Summary
The passage from De Wit v. Firstar Corp. outlines the statutory requirements
for a RICO claim, specifically the need for a "pattern of racketeering
activity," which involves at least two acts within a 10-year period. This
directly supports the proposition that the complaint must allege a pattern of
racketeering activity, as it provides the legal framework for what constitutes
such a pattern under RICO. The passage also highlights the importance of
relatedness and continuity, which are key elements in establishing a RICO
claim, as mentioned in the proposition.

RICO makes it unlawful for 'any person employed by or associated with any
enterprise engaged in...interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or
participate...in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of
racketeering activity.' 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). 'Racketeering activity' includes
any of several listed crimes 'which is chargeable under State law and
punishable by imprisonment for more than one year,' as well as any act
chargeable under one of several enumerated federal statutes. § 1961(1). A
'pattern of racketeering activity' requires at least two acts of racketeering
activity, which must be 'related' and 'amount to or pose a threat of continued
criminal activity.' ... To state a RICO civil claim, a plaintiff must allege '(1)

Summary
Statutory requirements for a RICO claim, which include the existence of an
enterprise, a pattern of racketeering activity, and the requirement that the
acts are related and continuous. These elements are directly relevant to the
proposition, which asserts that the complaint sufficiently alleges these
elements. The passage also emphasizes the need for at least two predicate

U.S. District Court — Eastern District of New York
Extract
To state a claim for damages under RICO a plaintiff has two pleading
burdens. First, he must allege that the defendant has violated the
substantive RICO statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1962 (1976), commonly known as
'criminal RICO.' In so doing, he must allege the existence of seven
constituent elements: (1) that the defendant (2) through the commission of
two or more acts (3) constituting a 'pattern' (4) of 'racketeering activity' (5)
directly or indirectly invests in, or maintains an interest in, or participates in
(6) an 'enterprise' (7) the activities of which affect interstate or foreign
commerce.... To establish such a pattern of racketeering activity, 'a plaintiff
must plead at least two predicate acts, show that the acts are related and
that they amount to, or pose a threat of, continuing criminal activity.' H.J.

Summary
Necessary elements to plead a RICO claim, which include alleging a pattern
of racketeering activity and the existence of an enterprise. It references the
requirement of at least two predicate acts that are related and pose a threat
of continued criminal activity, aligning with the requirements under H.J. Inc.
v. Northwestern Bell. This directly supports the proposition that the
complaint must allege these elements to state a RICO claim.

Extract
The RICO statute defines racketeering activity to include, among other
things, any act indictable under specified federal statutes, including 18
U.S.C. § 1341 (Mail Fraud), 18 U.S.C. § 1343 (Wire Fraud)... A 'pattern of
racketeering activity' is defined as at least two predicate acts within a ten
year period. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5) (2006). However, courts have held that
alleging only two predicate acts is not wholly sufficient to satisfy the pattern
of racketeering element. H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229,
237-38, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989). In Northwestern Bell, the
United States Supreme Court held that in order to establish a pattern of
racketeering activity, a plaintiff must not only allege that at least two
predicate acts existed, but that the predicate acts are 'related' and amount
to or pose a threat of 'continued' criminal activity.
Summary
Requirements for establishing a RICO claim, specifically the need for at least
two predicate acts of racketeering activity that are related and continuous.
This aligns with the proposition's assertion that the complaint describes a
pattern of racketeering activity involving mail and wire fraud, which are
recognized predicate acts under RICO. The passage also references the H.J.
Inc. v. Northwestern Bell decision, which is directly cited in the proposition,
reinforcing the need for relatedness and continuity in the alleged acts.

To plead a civil RICO action, a plaintiff must plead specific, non-conclusory,
facts which, if accepted as true, show the existence of four elements: '(1)
conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity.' ... For purposes of RICO liability, 'an enterprise may be a legal
entity. .. or it may be an informal grouping of individuals associated in
fact.' ... A ''pattern of racketeering activity'' requires at least two acts of
racketeering activity within ten years of each other. ... To satisfy this
mandate, a plaintiff must plead facts showing that racketeering acts are
'related, and that they amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal
activity.'
Summary
Necessary elements to plead a civil RICO action, which include conduct of
an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. It specifies that an
enterprise can be an informal association-in-fact, which aligns with the
proposition's claim of an association-in-fact enterprise among the
defendants. The passage also explains the requirement for a pattern of
racketeering activity, including the need for related acts that pose a threat
of continued criminal activity, which supports the proposition's description
of ongoing threats and coordination over an 18-month period.

Extract
Generally, the elements of a civil Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt

pattern of (4) racketeering activity (5) which causes injury to the plaintiff. 18
U.S.C.A. § 1962 (a, c). ... For a pattern of racketeering activity to exist, 'two

criminal activity.' ... 'In essence, the pattern requirement has been reduced
to a ‘continuity plus relationship’ test.'
Summary
Essential elements required to establish a civil RICO claim, which include
the existence of an enterprise and a pattern of racketeering activity. It
specifies that the pattern must consist of at least two predicate acts within
ten years and must demonstrate continuity and relationship, aligning with
the requirements under H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell. This directly supports
the proposition that the complaint must allege these elements to state a
RICO claim.

Extract
&#34;Continuity&#34; is both a closed- and open-ended concept, referring
either to a closed period of repeated conduct, or to past conduct that by its
nature projects into the future with a threat of repetition. It is, in either
case, centrally a temporal concept.... A party alleging a RICO violation may
demonstrate continuity over a closed period by proving a series of related
predicates extending over a substantial period of time. Predicate acts
extending over a few weeks or months and threatening no future criminal
conduct do not satisfy this requirement: Congress was concerned in RICO
with long-term criminal conduct. Often a RICO action will be brought before
continuity can be established in this way. In such cases, liability depends on
whether the threat of continuity is demonstrated.
Summary
The passage explains the concept of "continuity" in the context of RICO
claims, which is crucial for establishing a pattern of racketeering activity. It
highlights that continuity can be demonstrated over a closed period by
showing a series of related predicate acts extending over a substantial
period of time. This directly supports the proposition that the complaint
describes a pattern of racketeering activity over an 18-month period, which
is a substantial period of time. The passage also notes that the threat of
continuity can be demonstrated, which aligns with the complaint's
allegations of ongoing threats and coordination among the defendants.

Extract
In order to secure a conviction under RICO, the Government must prove
both the existence of an 'enterprise' and the connected 'pattern of
racketeering activity.' The enterprise is an entity, for present purposes a
group of persons associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a
course of conduct. The pattern of racketeering activity is, on the other hand,
a series of criminal acts as defined by the statute. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1) (1976
ed., Supp. III). The former is proved by evidence of an ongoing organization,
formal or informal, and by evidence that the various associates function as a
continuing unit.
Summary
The U.S. Supreme Court in United States v. Turkette clarified that to prove a
RICO violation, there must be evidence of both an enterprise and a pattern
of racketeering activity. An enterprise can be a group of individuals
associated for a common purpose, and it must function as a continuing unit.
This aligns with the proposition that the complaint alleges an association-in-
fact enterprise with a common purpose and a pattern of racketeering
activity.

The RICO statute sets out four elements: a defendant must participate in (1)
the conduct of (2) an enterprise that affects interstate commerce (3) through
a pattern (4) of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt. ... To

must plead that the enterprise has (A) a common purpose, (B) a structure or
organization, and (C) longevity necessary to accomplish the purpose. ...
Racketeering activity, the fourth element, requires predicate acts, which in

A plaintiff bringing a civil RICO action under § 1964(c) must adequately
plead at least two predicate acts of racketeering that form a 'pattern of
racketeering.' 18 U.S.C.A. § 1961(5). Private civil RICO suits may be brought

Summary
Requirement for a civil RICO action, which includes adequately pleading at
least two predicate acts of racketeering to form a pattern. This aligns with
the proposition's requirement to allege a pattern of racketeering activity.
The passage also notes that private civil RICO suits can be brought
independently of government prosecution, supporting the notion that the
complaint can stand on its own merits if it meets the statutory requirements.

It shall be unlawful for any person through a pattern of racketeering activity
or through collection of an unlawful debt to acquire or maintain, directly or

Summary
The passage from 18 U.S.C. § 1962(b) directly addresses the unlawful nature
of acquiring or maintaining control over an enterprise through a pattern of
racketeering activity. This supports the proposition by establishing the legal
framework under which the alleged activities of Myers, Branthoover, and
Wilson could be considered unlawful if they engaged in a pattern of
racketeering to control an enterprise. The complaint's allegations of drafting
false legal documents and serving fraudulent eviction notices could
constitute such a pattern, thereby supporting the RICO claim.

The passage provides definitions crucial for establishing a RICO claim, such
as "racketeering activity," which includes mail and wire fraud, and
"enterprise," which can be a group of individuals associated in fact. It also
defines a "pattern of racketeering activity" as requiring at least two acts
within ten years. These definitions align with the elements needed to
support the proposition that the complaint alleges a RICO claim by
describing an enterprise and a pattern of racketeering activity.

Extract
RICO applies only where the commission of two predicate acts constitutes a
'pattern of racketeering activity.' (48) While the statutory definition of
'pattern of racketeering activity' requires at least two acts of racketeering
that occur within ten years of each other, (49) proof of such acts, without
more, may not suffice to establish a RICO violation. (50) There must also be
proof that the predicate acts are continuous and interrelated. (51) Thus, 'two
isolated acts of racketeering do not constitute a pattern.' (52) In H.J. Inc. v.
Northwestern Bell Telephone Co., (53) the Court held that the government
must establish both a relationship between the predicate acts and continuity
of those acts to prove a 'pattern of racketeering activity' for RICO purposes.
(54) Although these two requirements, referred to as the 'continuity plus
relationship' test, (55) must be separately established, the Court has
recognized that evidence on these two prongs often will overlap. (56)
Summary
Requirements for establishing a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO,
specifically the need for at least two predicate acts that are continuous and
interrelated. It references the "continuity plus relationship" test from H.J.
Inc. v. Northwestern Bell, which is directly relevant to the proposition's
claim that the complaint satisfies these requirements. The passage supports
the proposition by confirming that the complaint's allegations of ongoing,
coordinated acts over a substantial period could meet the RICO pattern
requirement.

Bailey, Lisa Pritchard - 1999-06-22
Extract
A recurring issue is the type and sufficiency of proof the government must
offer to establish the existence of a RICO enterprise. Although the circuits
have not adopted a uniform definition of enterprise, they do require that the
charged RICO enterprise, in order to distinguish it from a conspiracy, have
some structure. A more specific definition requires that a RICO enterprise
exhibit three characteristics: (1) a common or shared purpose; (2) some
continuity of structure and personnel; and (3) an ascertainable structure
distinct from that inherent in a pattern of racketeering. When a 'legal' entity
is the enterprise under consideration, 'there is little difficulty in proving the
existence of the enterprise. Proof that the entity in question has a legal
existence satisfies the enterprise element.' In contrast, proving the existence
of an association-in-fact enterprise requires showing that 'a group of persons
associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a course of
conduct.'
Summary
Requirements for establishing a RICO enterprise, particularly an
association-in-fact enterprise, which is relevant to the proposition. It
specifies the need for a common purpose, continuity, and an ascertainable
structure, which aligns with the complaint's allegations of a structured,
ongoing scheme with a common purpose. The passage also discusses the
necessity of proving a pattern of racketeering activity, which supports the
complaint's description of multiple predicate acts over a substantial period.

Extract
The first element of RICO requires two or more predicate acts of
'racketeering activity.'... The Supreme Court made a second attempt to
clarify the 'pattern' concept in H.J., Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co.
In that case, the Court held that when proving a 'pattern of racketeering
activity,' RICO requires both relationship and continuity of predicate acts as
separate elements... proving the existence of an association-in-fact
enterprise requires showing that 'a group of persons associated together for
a common purpose of engaging in a course of conduct.'

Summary
Requirements for establishing a RICO claim, specifically the need for two or
more predicate acts of racketeering activity and the necessity of
demonstrating both relationship and continuity of these acts, as clarified in
H.J., Inc. v. Northwestern Bell. It also explains the criteria for proving an
association-in-fact enterprise, which includes a common purpose and a
course of conduct. These elements directly support the proposition by
aligning with the allegations in the complaint regarding the structured,
ongoing scheme and the specific acts by each defendant.

Extract
To prosecute a defendant under RICO, the government must prove that the
defendant: (i) through the commission of two or more acts constituting a
pattern of racketeering activity; (ii) directly or indirectly invested in,
maintained an interest in, or participated in, an enterprise; (iii) the activities
of which affected interstate or foreign commerce... RICO applies only where
the commission of two predicate acts constitutes a 'pattern of racketeering
activity.'... The Supreme Court has stated that a 'pattern of racketeering' can
only be established if the predicate acts are continuous and interrelated... In
H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co., the Court held that the
government must establish both a relationship between the predicate acts
and continuity of those acts to prove a 'pattern of racketeering activity' for
RICO purposes.
Summary
Requirements for establishing a RICO violation, which include proving a
pattern of racketeering activity through at least two predicate acts that are
continuous and interrelated, as well as the existence of an enterprise. The
passage references the H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell case, which is directly
relevant to the proposition as it discusses the "continuity plus relationship"
test necessary for a RICO claim. This aligns with the proposition's assertion
that the complaint must allege a structured, ongoing scheme with specific
acts over a substantial period.

Extract
RICO indictments require that the government prove: (1) that the defendant,
through the commission of two or more acts; (2) constituting a pattern of
racketeering activity; (3) directly or indirectly invested in, or maintained an
interest in, or participated in; (4) an enterprise; (5) the activities of which
affected interstate or foreign commerce... To prove the existence of an
enterprise, prosecutors must show the existence of an ongoing organization
which functions as a 'continuing unit.'... the proof needed to establish either
can 'coalesce.'... the Second Circuit's requirement is among the least
demanding. The court upheld convictions where the evidence showed only
that 'the enterprise was, in effect, no more than the sum of the predicate
racketeering acts.'
Summary
To support a RICO claim, the complaint must allege at least two predicate
acts that form a pattern of racketeering activity and demonstrate the
existence of an enterprise. The passage explains that the enterprise can be
shown as an ongoing organization functioning as a continuing unit, and that
the proof of enterprise and pattern can coalesce. This aligns with the
proposition that the complaint describes a structured, ongoing scheme with
specific acts over a substantial period, thus sufficiently pleading the
existence of an enterprise and a pattern of racketeering activity.

Extract
A RICO enterprise is 'a group of persons associated together for a common
purpose in a course of conduct.' 'A RICO enterprise must exhibit three basic
characteristics: (1) a common or shared purpose; (2) some continuity of
structure and personnel; and (3) an ascertainable structure distinct from
that in a pattern of racketeering.' ... The Supreme Court therefore made a
second attempt to clarify the 'pattern' concept. In H. J. Inc. v. Northwestern
Bell Telephone Co., Supreme Court held that in order to prove a 'pattern of
racketeering activity,' a prosecutor must show both relationship and
continuity.
Summary
Definition of a RICO enterprise and outlines the necessary characteristics,
such as a common purpose and continuity, which align with the proposition's
claim of an association-in-fact enterprise. Additionally, the passage
references the Supreme Court's decision in H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell,
which is directly cited in the proposition, to explain the requirements for a

pattern of racketeering activity, emphasizing the need for relationship and
continuity. This supports the proposition's assertion that the complaint
sufficiently alleges these elements.

Extract
RICO applies only where the commission of two predicate acts constitutes a
'pattern of racketeering activity.' (43) While the statutory definition of
'pattern of racketeering activity' requires at least two acts of racketeering
occurring within ten years of each other, (44) simply proving two acts may
not be sufficient to establish a RICO violation. (45) The Supreme Court has
stated that a 'pattern of racketeering' can only be established if the
predicate acts are continuous and interrelated. (46) Thus, 'two isolated acts
of racketeering do not constitute a pattern.' (47) In H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern
Bell Telephone Co., (48) the Court held that the government must establish
both a relationship between the predicate acts and continuity of those acts
to prove a 'pattern of racketeering activity' for RICO purposes. (49) These
requirements, referred to as the 'continuity plus relationship' test, (50) must
be proven independently, but the Court has recognized that evidence
establishing the two elements will often overlap. (51)
Summary
To establish a RICO claim, the complaint must demonstrate a pattern of
racketeering activity, which requires at least two predicate acts that are
continuous and interrelated. The passage references the Supreme Court's
decision in H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell, which is directly relevant to the
proposition as it outlines the "continuity plus relationship" test necessary for
a RICO claim. This aligns with the proposition's assertion that the complaint
describes a pattern of racketeering activity and satisfies the relationship and
continuity requirements.

Summary
The passages provide a detailed explanation of what constitutes a "pattern
of racketeering activity" and an "enterprise" under RICO. They emphasize
the need for a relationship and continuity among the acts, as well as a
common purpose and structure among the participants. These elements
align with the requirements outlined in the proposition, which describes an
association-in-fact enterprise with a common purpose and a pattern of
racketeering activity.

Extract
The first element of RICO requires two or more predicate acts of
'racketeering activity.'... A recurring issue is the type and sufficiency of proof
the government must offer to establish the existence of a RICO enterprise...
A more specific definition requires that a RICO enterprise exhibit three
characteristics: '(1) a common or shared purpose; (2) some continuity of
structure and personnel; and (3) an ascertainable structure distinct from
that inherent in a pattern of racketeering.'... finding defendant's two
racketeering acts were sufficiently interrelated and posed threat of
continued racketeering under RICO's pattern requirement... holding that
plaintiff who alleges high number of related predicate acts committed over
substantial period of time establishes that those acts amount to continued
criminal activity for purposes of establishing closed ended period of
racketeering activity.
Summary
Requirements for establishing a RICO claim, including the need for two or
more predicate acts of racketeering activity and the characteristics of a
RICO enterprise. It emphasizes the necessity of a common purpose,
continuity, and an ascertainable structure, which aligns with the
proposition's description of an association-in-fact enterprise. The passage
also discusses the relationship and continuity requirements, which are

Extract
RICO applies only where the commission of two predicate acts constitutes a
'pattern of racketeering activity.' (48) While the statutory definition of
'pattern of racketeering activity' requires at least two acts of racketeering
that occur within ten years of each other, (49) proof of such acts, without
more, may not suffice to establish a RICO violation. (50) There must also be
proof that the predicate acts are continuous and interrelated. (51) Thus, 'two
isolated acts of racketeering do not constitute a pattern.' (52) In H.J. Inc. v.
Northwestern Bell Telephone Co., (53) the Court held that the government
must establish both a relationship between the predicate acts and continuity
of those acts to prove a 'pattern of racketeering activity' for RICO purposes.
(54) Although these two requirements, referred to as the 'continuity plus
relationship' test, (55) must be separately established, the Court has
recognized that evidence on these two prongs often will overlap. (56)
Summary
Requirements for establishing a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO,
specifically the need for at least two predicate acts that are continuous and
interrelated. This directly supports the proposition that the complaint must
allege a pattern of racketeering activity, as it describes the necessary
elements of continuity and relationship between acts, as established in H.J.
Inc. v. Northwestern Bell.
Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy
The Brief - American Bar Association - 2024-01-01
Extract
A violation of § 1962(c), the section on which Sedima relies, requires (1)
conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity. The plaintiff must allege each of the elements to state a claim. They
are all equally essential components, and the complaint will fail if any one of
them is not adequately pleaded. In particular, RICO claims based on mail or
wire fraud must comport with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b)’s
requirement that allegations involving fraud be pleaded with particularity. ...
To establish a § 1962(c) RICO claim, the following elements must be proven:
• Enterprise: A structured group of individuals associated for a common

=== PAGE 30 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
purpose. • Pattern of racketeering activity: At least two acts of racketeering,
as specified within the statute, within 10 years.
Summary
An enterprise is a structured group of individuals associated for a common
purpose, and a pattern of racketeering activity requires at least two acts
within ten years. This aligns with the proposition's requirement to allege an
enterprise and a pattern of racketeering activity, including specific acts and
participants.
Corporate Criminal Liability: End It, Don't Mend It.
The Journal of Corporation Law - University of Iowa Journal of
Corporation Law - Smith, Stephen F. - 2022-06-22
Extract
Subsection 1962(c), the most commonly used basis for substantive RICO
charges, is instructive. It imposes civil and criminal liability on the persons
'employed by or associated with' organized-crime syndicates or other RICO
'enterprises' who 'conduct, or participate in the conduct of, the [enterprise's]
affairs' through a 'pattern of racketeering activity.' (18) ... the Supreme
Court has long endorsed that expansive interpretation, which breathed new
life into RICO by allowing prosecutors to go directly after organized
criminals without awaiting efforts to infiltrate legitimate businesses. See
United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 587 (1981) (holding that purely
illegitimate groups can constitute RICO enterprises).
Summary
RICO's Subsection 1962(c) is applicable to individuals associated with
enterprises conducting racketeering activities. The passage also references
the Supreme Court's interpretation in United States v. Turkette, which
supports the idea that even illegitimate groups can be considered RICO
enterprises. This aligns with the proposition that the complaint alleges an
association-in-fact enterprise with a pattern of racketeering activity.
RECONCEIVING COERCION-BASED CRIMINAL DEFENSES.
Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology - Northwestern University,
School of Law - Galoob, Stephen R. - 2022-03-22
Extract
The inquiry here is meant to invoke the 'pattern of racketeering activity'
element of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).
The Organized Crime Control Act (1970), which includes RICO, provides that

=== PAGE 31 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
'criminal conduct forms a pattern if it embraces criminal acts that have the
same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of
commission, or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics
and are not isolated events.' The Supreme Court characterized this
requirement as a 'relationship' element and held that the statute further
requires a 'continuity' element, 'referring either to a closed period of
repeated conduct, or to past conduct that by its nature projects into the
future with a threat of repetition.'
Summary
Clear explanation of the "pattern of racketeering activity" requirement
under RICO, emphasizing the need for related and continuous criminal acts.
It aligns with the proposition by highlighting the necessity of demonstrating
a relationship and continuity among the acts, which the complaint in the
proposition claims to do by detailing the timing, participants, and methods
of the alleged racketeering activities over an 18-month period.
RICO: A Primer
Extract
A RICO enterprise includes 'any individual, partnership, corporation,
association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals
associated in fact although not a legal entity.' Courts have interpreted
'enterprise' broadly, and the definition captures both legitimate and
illegitimate enterprises. The statutory list is not exhaustive but merely
illustrative. ... A 'pattern' may exist where any combination of two or more
offenses occurred within a period of time. In Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co.,
473 U.S. 479, the Supreme Court held that the RICO pattern element
requires more than merely proving two predicate acts of racketeering.
Rather, proof of 'continuity plus relationship' is necessary. ... The
racketeering acts need not be similar or directly related to each other;
rather, it is sufficient that the racketeering acts are related in some way to
the affairs of the charged enterprise, including, for example, that: the
racketeering acts furthered the goals of or benefitted the enterprise, the
enterprise or the defendant's role in the enterprise enabled the defendant to
commit, or facilitated the commission of, the racketeering acts, the
racketeering acts were committed at the behest of, or on behalf of, the
enterprise, or the racketeering acts had the same or similar purposes,
results, participants, victims or methods of commission.
Summary
Broad definition of a RICO enterprise, which includes any group of
individuals associated in fact, even if not a legal entity. This supports the
proposition that Myers, Branthoover, and Wilson could form an association-
in-fact enterprise. The passage also explains the requirement for a pattern
of racketeering activity, emphasizing the need for continuity and

=== PAGE 32 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
relationship among predicate acts, which aligns with the complaint's
allegations of ongoing threats and coordination over an 18-month period.
The passage further clarifies that the acts need not be similar but must
relate to the enterprise's affairs, supporting the complaint's description of
varied acts like filing false documents and using mail and wire
communications.
