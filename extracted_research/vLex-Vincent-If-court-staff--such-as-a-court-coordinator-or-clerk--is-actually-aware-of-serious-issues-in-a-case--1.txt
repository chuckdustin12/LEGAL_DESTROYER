Question
If court staff (such as a court coordinator or clerk) is actually aware of
serious issues in a case, and the litigant is pro se, does Texas law impose any
obligation on the staff to inform the judge or take action?
Answer (Texas)
Short response
Texas law does not impose a direct legal obligation on court staff, such as
coordinators or clerks, to inform the judge or take action when they become
aware of serious issues in a case involving a pro se litigant. However, the
judge remains ultimately responsible for the administration of the court and
for ensuring that staff fulfill their delegated duties, which may indirectly
require staff to address or report such issues as part of their general
responsibilities.
Summary
There is no explicit statutory or case law requirement in Texas that
mandates court staff to notify the judge or intervene when they become
aware of significant problems in a case, even when a party is self-
represented. The Texas Supreme Court has clarified that while staff perform
many day-to-day functions, the judge is ultimately accountable for the
proper administration of the court and for ensuring that staff meet high
standards of performance.
This framework means that although staff are not personally liable or
directly obligated by law to act upon knowledge of serious case issues, their
actions (or inactions) may reflect on the judge’s fulfillment of their
administrative duties. The judge’s responsibility to oversee staff
performance could, in practice, lead to internal policies or expectations that
staff report significant matters, but this is not a legal mandate imposed
specifically on staff by Texas law.
Background and Relevant Law
Case Law
The principal authority on the relationship between court staff duties and
judicial responsibility in Texas is the Texas Supreme Court’s decision in In re
Rose, 144 S.W.3d 661 (Tex. 2004). This case addresses the allocation of
administrative and recordkeeping duties between judges and their staff, and
the extent to which judges are responsible for the actions or omissions of
their staff.

In In re Rose, the Court recognized that much of the routine work assigned
to judges, particularly in recordkeeping and reporting, is performed by staff
members. However, the Court emphasized that the judge retains ultimate
responsibility for ensuring that these duties are properly carried out.
Failures in these areas, even if caused by staff inadequacies, are attributed
to the judge’s overall responsibility for court administration.
The Court further explained that while clerks and other staff may physically
perform certain acts, the judge is accountable for the administration of the
court. A key corollary to this principle is that judges must require a high
standard of performance from their staff and will be held accountable for
administrative shortcomings attributable to staff.
Legislative and Regulatory Framework
No legislative or regulatory materials were provided that directly address
the obligations of court staff in this context. The analysis therefore relies on
the judicial interpretation of administrative responsibilities as articulated in 
In re Rose.
Analysis
The Role and Duties of Court Staff
Court staff, such as coordinators and clerks, are essential to the daily
functioning of Texas courts. Their responsibilities typically include managing
dockets, maintaining records, communicating with parties, and facilitating
the smooth operation of court proceedings. These duties are largely
administrative and procedural in nature.
In re Rose makes clear that while staff perform many of these tasks, the
judge is the person ultimately responsible for ensuring that the court’s
business is conducted properly. The Court’s reasoning suggests that staff are
expected to perform their delegated duties competently, but it does not
establish a direct, personal legal obligation for staff to take action or inform
the judge about substantive issues in individual cases, even when those
issues are serious or when a litigant is pro se.
The Judge’s Ultimate Responsibility
The Texas Supreme Court’s decision places the burden of oversight and
accountability squarely on the judge. The judge must ensure that staff are
adequately trained, supervised, and held to a high standard of performance.
If staff fail in their duties—whether by omission or commission—the judge is
answerable for those failures in the context of court administration.
This framework means that, in practice, judges may implement internal
policies or procedures requiring staff to report significant issues, especially
those that could affect the fairness or integrity of proceedings. However,
these are matters of internal court management rather than legal mandates
imposed by statute or case law on staff themselves.

Pro Se Litigants and Court Staff Obligations
The presence of a pro se litigant does not, under current Texas law as
reflected in the provided authority, create a heightened or special legal duty
for court staff to intervene or inform the judge about serious issues. While
courts may be more attentive to the needs of self-represented parties to
ensure access to justice, the law does not impose a specific obligation on
staff to act differently in such cases.
The rationale for this approach is rooted in the principle of judicial
impartiality and the administrative nature of staff duties. Court staff are not
advocates for any party, and their role is to facilitate the orderly processing
of cases rather than to monitor or correct substantive legal issues on behalf
of litigants.
Indirect Obligations and Practical Considerations
Although there is no direct legal duty imposed on staff, the judge’s
responsibility for court administration may, in practice, lead to expectations
that staff will bring significant matters to the judge’s attention. For example,
if a staff member becomes aware of a procedural defect, a missed deadline,
or a potential miscarriage of justice, internal court policies or the judge’s
instructions may require the staff member to report the issue.
If staff fail to do so and this failure results in administrative shortcomings,
the judge may be held accountable for not ensuring adequate oversight or
training. This indirect mechanism of accountability reinforces the
importance of staff diligence but does not create a personal legal obligation
enforceable against staff members themselves.
Limits of Staff Authority and Judicial Independence
It is also important to recognize the limits of staff authority. Court staff do
not have the power to make substantive legal decisions or to intervene in
the merits of a case. Their role is to support the judge and the court’s
administrative functions. Imposing a direct legal obligation on staff to act
upon knowledge of serious issues could blur the lines between
administrative support and judicial decision-making, potentially
undermining judicial independence and impartiality.
Exceptions and Caveats
There may be exceptional circumstances where staff conduct could give rise
to legal consequences, such as if a staff member engages in misconduct,
fraud, or intentional interference with the administration of justice.
However, such situations are not addressed by the provided authority and
would likely be governed by other legal principles, such as criminal law or
professional codes of conduct.
Additionally, while the provided authority does not impose a direct
obligation on staff, individual courts or judges may adopt local rules or

internal policies that require staff to report certain types of issues. These
policies, however, are not legal requirements under Texas law as articulated
by the Texas Supreme Court.
Finally, the analysis is limited to the materials provided. If there are
statutes, regulations, or more recent cases not included in the provided
sources, those could potentially affect the answer.
Conclusion
In summary, Texas law, as interpreted by the Texas Supreme Court in In re
Rose, 144 S.W.3d 661 (Tex. 2004), does not impose a direct legal obligation
on court staff to inform the judge or take action when they become aware of
serious issues in a case, even when a litigant is pro se. The judge is
ultimately responsible for the administration of the court and for ensuring
that staff perform their duties to a high standard. While staff may be
expected, as a matter of internal policy or good practice, to report
significant issues, this expectation arises from the judge’s overarching
responsibility rather than from a specific legal duty imposed on staff by
Texas law.

Texas Supreme Court
Extract
But the judge, who necessarily delegates some of the court's responsibilities
to staff, retains the obligation to see to it that his or her staff fulfills the
responsibilities delegated. While, '[a]s a practical matter, much of the day-to-
day work involved in the recordkeeping and reporting duties officially
allocated to a judge is performed by staff[, c]harges relating to failures in
such areas, even if attributable in fact to staff inadequacies, relate to the
ultimate responsibility of the judge....' ... Thus, 'although the clerk performs
the physical act of record keeping, the judge is ultimately responsible for the
administration of his court.' ... 'A corollary to the judge's duty to require a
high standard of performance of the judge's staff is that the judge will be
held accountable for the administrative shortcomings of the judge's staff.'
Summary
While court staff perform many of the day-to-day duties, the ultimate
responsibility for ensuring these duties are performed correctly lies with the
judge. The judge is accountable for the actions and shortcomings of their
staff. This implies that while the staff may not have a direct legal obligation
to inform the judge of issues, the judge is responsible for ensuring that the
staff is performing their duties to a high standard, which would include
addressing serious issues in a case.
