Question
How does the 10th Circuit distinguish between the person and the
enterprise under RICO?
Answer (Tenth Circuit)
Short response
The Tenth Circuit requires that the "person" who violates RICO must be
distinct from the "enterprise" whose affairs that person conducts through a
pattern of racketeering activity, adhering to the principle that a defendant
cannot simultaneously be both the RICO person and the RICO enterprise
under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c).
Summary
The Tenth Circuit consistently interprets the Racketeer Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) to require a clear distinction between the
"person" who conducts or participates in racketeering activity and the
"enterprise" through which such activity occurs. This "distinctness
requirement" stems from the statutory language of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c),
which makes it unlawful for "any person employed by or associated with any
enterprise" to conduct the enterprise's affairs through racketeering activity
—language that logically requires the person to be separate from the
enterprise with which they are associated.
The court's approach to this distinction has evolved through numerous
decisions, establishing that while a corporation cannot be both the person
and the enterprise under § 1962(c), an individual employee can be the
"person" while the corporation they work for serves as the "enterprise." The
Tenth Circuit also requires an enterprise to have certain characteristics that
distinguish it from mere individuals engaging in criminal acts, including a
purpose, relationships among associates, and sufficient longevity to pursue
its purpose. While this distinctness requirement is strictly applied to claims
under § 1962(c), the court has recognized that the requirement may not
apply with equal force to other subsections of the RICO statute.
Background and Relevant Law
The RICO Statute
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) was
enacted as part of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970. The statute's
core substantive provision, 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), states:
"It shall be unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any
enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of
such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity or
collection of unlawful debt," United States v. Garcia, 793 F.3d 1194 (10th
Cir. 2015).
The statute defines "enterprise" to "include[] any individual, partnership,
corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of
individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity," U.S. v. Smith, 413
F.3d 1253, 1266 (10th Cir. 2005). However, it's important to note that U.S. v.
Smith was later overruled by United States v. Garcia, 793 F.3d 1194 (10th
Cir. 2015) on other grounds related to jury instructions for RICO conspiracy
charges, though the definition of "enterprise" remains valid.
The Distinctness Requirement
The Tenth Circuit has consistently held that "for purposes of 18 U.S.C. §
1962(c), the defendant 'person' must be an entity distinct from the alleged
'enterprise,'" Switzer v. Coan et al., 261 F.3d 985, 992 (10th Cir. 2001). This
principle, commonly referred to as the "distinctness requirement," is "well-
settled in this circuit, as in most others," Brannon v. Boatmen's First Nat.
Bank of Oklahoma, 153 F.3d 1144, 1146 (10th Cir. 1998).
The court's reasoning for this requirement is straightforward: "The language
of the statute clearly contemplates that the 'person' charged will be distinct
from the 'enterprise', since a person cannot logically be 'employed by or
associated with' himself," Board of County Com'rs of San Juan County v.
Liberty Group, 965 F.2d 879, 885 (10th Cir. 1992).
This distinctness requirement has been consistently applied throughout the
circuit. In Safe Streets Alliance v. Hickenlooper, 859 F.3d 865, 882 (10th Cir.
2017), the court reaffirmed that RICO "requires that the 'person' conducting
the enterprise's affairs be distinct from the 'enterprise.'" The court cited the
Supreme Court's decision in Cedric Kushner Promotions, Ltd. v. King, 533
U.S. 158, 160 (2001), emphasizing that "a single person cannot be both the
RICO enterprise and the RICO defendant."
Enterprise Definition and Requirements
The Tenth Circuit has elaborated on what constitutes an "enterprise" under
RICO. In United States v. Kamahele, 748 F.3d 984, 1003 (10th Cir. 2014), the
court explained that an association-in-fact enterprise requires: "(1) a
purpose, (2) relationships among those associated with the enterprise, and
(3) longevity sufficient to permit those associated with the enterprise to
pursue the enterprise's purpose."
The court noted that an enterprise may exist even without formal structures,
stating that "an enterprise may exist even without a formal hierarchy, chain
of command, fixed roles, a name, established rules, initiation ceremonies, or
regular meetings," United States v. Kamahele, 748 F.3d 984, 1003 (10th Cir.
2014), citing the Supreme Court's decision in Boyle v. United States, 556
U.S. 938, 948 (2009).

Furthermore, the enterprise must be "an entity separate and apart from the
pattern [of racketeering] in which it engages," and its existence is proven
"by evidence of an ongoing organization... and by evidence that the various
associates function as a continuing unit," Carlson v. Town of Mountain Vill.,
Civil Action No. 17-cv-02887-PAB-STV (D. Colo. Mar 25, 2019), citing United
States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 583 (1981).
Analysis
The Person-Enterprise Distinction in Practice
The Tenth Circuit's application of the distinctness requirement has produced
a body of case law that provides clear guidance on how to distinguish
between the person and the enterprise under RICO.
Corporation as Both Person and Enterprise
One of the clearest applications of the distinctness requirement is the
prohibition against a corporation being both the RICO person and the RICO
enterprise under § 1962(c). In Garbade v. Great Divide Min. and Mill. Corp.,
831 F.2d 212, 213 (10th Cir. 1987), the court dismissed RICO claims against
a corporate defendant because it could not "in these circumstances be both
an 'enterprise' and a 'person' within the purposes and wording of the
section." The court emphasized that § 1962(c) "does not relate to corporate
or enterprise liability."
Similarly, in Skeet v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 760 F. Supp. 872, 878 (D. Kan.
1991), the court noted that "the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals has
recognized that a corporation cannot be both an 'enterprise' and a 'person'
within the meaning of the § 1962(c)."
This principle was reaffirmed in Mitchell v. Wells Fargo Bank, 355 F.Supp.3d
1136, 1148-1149 (D. Utah 2018), which stated that "the Tenth Circuit has
concluded that no enterprise exists when the persons and enterprise alleged
were by all appearances the same."
Individual Corporate Officers and Their Corporations
While a corporation cannot be both the person and the enterprise, the Tenth
Circuit has recognized that corporate employees or officers may be the
"persons" while the corporation serves as the "enterprise." In George v.
Urban Settlement Servs., 833 F.3d 1242, 1249 (10th Cir. 2016), the court
cited the Supreme Court's decision in Cedric Kushner Promotions, Ltd. v.
King, 533 U.S. 158, 163 (2001), which held that "the corporate owner/
employee, a natural person, is distinct from the corporation itself, a legally
different entity with different rights and responsibilities due to its different
legal status."
This principle was also recognized in Multi-Media Intern., LLC v. Promag
Retail Services, 343 F.Supp.2d 1024, 1032 (D. Kan. 2004), which stated that

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
"this distinctness principle is satisfied if a plaintiff alleges that a corporate
employee conducted a corporation's affairs through illegal means."
Parent-Subsidiary Relationships
The Tenth Circuit has also addressed the distinctness requirement in the
context of parent-subsidiary corporate relationships. In Brannon v.
Boatmen's First Nat. Bank of Oklahoma, 153 F.3d 1144, 1146-1148 (10th Cir.
1998), the court held that merely alleging that a subsidiary is the RICO
person and its parent corporation is the enterprise does not satisfy the
distinctness requirement.
As noted in a subsequent case citing Brannon: "The court noted that
'expanding RICO liability because of a business organization choice makes
little sense from a policy perspective.' Because RICO applies only where the
defendant participates in the 'enterprise's affairs, not just its own affairs,'
the Tenth Circuit held the plaintiff had alleged nothing more than a
'legitimate corporate and financial relationship between [the defendant] and
its holding company,' which was insufficient under RICO," Roberts v. C.R.
Eng., Inc., Case No. 2:12-CV-00302-RJS-BCW (D. Utah Jan 31, 2017).
Association-in-Fact Enterprises
The Tenth Circuit has provided guidance on how to identify an association-
in-fact enterprise that is distinct from the persons involved in the alleged
racketeering activity. In Dugan v. State Farm Mut. Ins. Co., Case No.
CIV-17-1221-R (W.D. Okla. Apr 03, 2018), the court emphasized that proof of
a pattern of racketeering activity and proof of an enterprise "may... coalesce,
but proof of one does not necessarily establish the other."
The court further noted, citing Kearney v. Dimanna, 195 F. App'x 717, 721
(10th Cir. 2006): "In assessing whether an alleged enterprise has an
ascertainable structure distinct from that inherent in a pattern of
racketeering, [we] determine if the enterprise would still exist were the
predicate acts removed from the equation," Dugan v. State Farm Mut. Ins.
Co., Case No. CIV-17-1221-R (W.D. Okla. Apr 03, 2018).
This guidance helps distinguish between a legitimate enterprise that
happens to engage in racketeering activity (a valid RICO claim) and a group
of individuals who simply commit crimes together without forming a distinct
enterprise (not a valid RICO claim).
The Operation or Management Test
The Tenth Circuit has also adopted the "operation or management" test to
determine whether a defendant has conducted or participated in the
conduct of the enterprise's affairs, as required by § 1962(c). In Tal v. Hogan,
453 F.3d 1244, 1270 (10th Cir. 2006), the court explained that "the Supreme
Court has adopted the 'operation or management' test to determine whether
the defendant has conducted or participated in the conduct of the enterprise
by having some part in directing the affairs of the enterprise."

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Under this test, "the defendants must have participated in the operation or
management of the RICO enterprise, although it is not necessary for the
participant to have significant control," Tal v. Hogan, 453 F.3d 1244, 1270
(10th Cir. 2006). This test helps distinguish between persons who are merely
associated with an enterprise and those who conduct or participate in the
conduct of the enterprise's affairs, further delineating the person-enterprise
distinction.
Conspiracies Under § 1962(d)
The Tenth Circuit has extended the distinctness requirement to RICO
conspiracy charges under § 1962(d). In United States v. Martinez, 543
F.Supp.3d 1209 (D. N.M. 2021), the court explained that for a RICO
conspiracy conviction, "the Government must prove beyond a reasonable
doubt that the defendant: (1) by knowing about and agreeing to facilitate the
commission of two or more acts (2) constituting a pattern (3) of racketeering
activity (4) participates in (5) an enterprise (6) the activities of which affect
interstate or foreign commerce."
This approach incorporates the elements of the substantive offense under §
1962(c), including the distinctness requirement between the person and the
enterprise, into the conspiracy offense under § 1962(d).
VICAR and RICO Comparison
The Tenth Circuit has also highlighted the similarities between RICO and the
Violent Crimes in Aid of Racketeering (VICAR) statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1959,
noting that both statutes "regulate[] enterprises, not people," United States
v. Garcia, 74 F.4th 1073 (10th Cir. 2023). This further emphasizes the
importance of the person-enterprise distinction in the court's RICO
jurisprudence.
The court has noted the slightly different definitions of "enterprise" under
RICO and VICAR, with RICO defining enterprise to include "any individual,
partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or
group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity," while
VICAR employs a slightly narrower definition that requires the enterprise to
be "engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign
commerce," United States v. DeLeon, No. CR 15-4268 JB (D. N.M. Jan 21,
2020).
Limitations to the Distinctness Requirement
It's important to note that the Tenth Circuit's distinctness requirement
applies specifically to claims under § 1962(c). In Smith v. MCI
Telecommunications Corp., 678 F.Supp. 823, 828 (D. Kan. 1987), the court
recognized that the distinctness requirement may not apply to claims under
§ 1962(a), which makes it unlawful for any person to use racketeering
income in the operation of an enterprise.
The court stated: "We are persuaded that the better approach is to not
require that the defendant/person be distinct from the enterprise [under §

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
1962(a)]," Smith v. MCI Telecommunications Corp., 678 F.Supp. 823, 828 (D.
Kan. 1987). The court reasoned that "the language [of § 1962(a)] does not
dictate that the entity generating racketeering income and the entity using
the income in its operations be distinct."
This distinction between § 1962(c) and § 1962(a) further illustrates the
nuanced approach the Tenth Circuit takes to the person-enterprise
distinction under RICO, recognizing that different subsections of the statute
may require different analyses.
Exceptions and Caveats
No Connection to Organized Crime Required
While RICO was originally enacted to combat organized crime, the Tenth
Circuit has rejected any requirement that RICO plaintiffs must prove a
connection to organized crime. In Plains Resources, Inc. v. Gable, 782 F.2d
883, 887 (10th Cir. 1986), the court held that "we reject the requirement
that a RICO plaintiff must aver and prove that the conduct described as
racketeering activity be connected to criminal conduct of an organized
nature."
This means that the person-enterprise distinction under RICO applies
regardless of whether the alleged racketeering activity is connected to
traditional organized crime enterprises.
Proof Requirements for Enterprise
While the distinctness requirement is firm, the Tenth Circuit has noted that
proving the existence of an enterprise does not always require extensive
evidence. In United States v. Kamahele, 748 F.3d 984, 1003 (10th Cir. 2014),
the court acknowledged that "[a]n enterprise may exist even without a
formal hierarchy, chain of command, fixed roles, a name, established rules,
initiation ceremonies, or regular meetings."
Furthermore, the court has recognized that "the proof used to establish
[enterprise and pattern of racketeering activity] may in particular cases
coalesce, proof of one does not necessarily establish the other," U.S. v.
Smith, 413 F.3d 1253, 1266 (10th Cir. 2005), citing United States v.
Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 583 (1981). Again, it should be noted that Smith was
later overruled by Garcia on other grounds, but this particular principle
remains valid.
This means that while the person and enterprise must be distinct, the
evidence used to prove their existence and the relationships between them
may overlap in some cases.
Conclusion
The Tenth Circuit's approach to distinguishing between the person and the
enterprise under RICO is marked by a consistent application of the

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
distinctness requirement, especially for claims under § 1962(c). This
requirement stems from the statutory language itself, which contemplates
that the "person" conducting or participating in the enterprise's affairs must
be distinct from the "enterprise" with which they are associated.
Several key principles emerge from the Tenth Circuit's jurisprudence:
A corporation cannot be both the person and the enterprise under §
1962(c).
Individual officers or employees of a corporation can be the "persons"
while the corporation serves as the "enterprise."
Merely alleging participation within a corporate structure, such as a
parent-subsidiary relationship, is not enough to satisfy the distinctness
requirement.
An association-in-fact enterprise must have a purpose, relationships
among its associates, and sufficient longevity to pursue its purpose.
The enterprise must have an ascertainable structure distinct from the
pattern of racketeering activity.
A defendant must have some part in directing the affairs of the
enterprise under the "operation or management" test.
The distinctness requirement applies to conspiracy charges under §
1962(d).
The distinctness requirement may not apply to claims under § 1962(a).
These principles provide clear guidance for courts and practitioners in the
Tenth Circuit when analyzing RICO claims and ensure that the statute's
focus on enterprises, rather than individuals acting alone, is maintained. The
court's approach balances the need to combat organized criminal activity
with the recognition that RICO should not be expanded beyond its statutory
boundaries.
In summary, the Tenth Circuit's distinction between the person and the
enterprise under RICO reflects a thoughtful interpretation of the statute's
language and purpose, providing a framework that has remained consistent
over decades of jurisprudence while adapting to various factual scenarios
and corporate structures.

Summary
The passage clearly states that within the Tenth Circuit, for a RICO claim
under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), the defendant identified as the "person" must be
distinct from the "enterprise." This distinction is a well-settled principle in
the Tenth Circuit, aligning with the majority of other circuits. This
requirement ensures that the entity accused of conducting racketeering
activities (the "person") is separate from the entity through which the
activities are conducted (the "enterprise").
Johnson v. Heath, 56 F.4th 851 (10th Cir. 2022)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
Plaintiff brought a RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. §§ 1962(c) and 1964(c)
against Defendant Michael Heath. Section 1962(c) prohibits 'any person
employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities
of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, [from] conduct[ing] or
participat[ing], directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's
affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.'
Summary
The passage provides insight into how the Tenth Circuit interprets the
distinction between a "person" and an "enterprise" under RICO. It specifies
that a "person" is someone who is employed by or associated with an
"enterprise" and who conducts or participates in the conduct of the
enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity. This
distinction is crucial in RICO cases, as it separates the individual or entity
responsible for the racketeering activity from the enterprise through which
the activity is conducted.

We recognize that § 1962(c) requires that the “person” conducting the
enterprise's affairs be distinct from the “enterprise.” Cedric Kushner
Promotions, Ltd. v. King, 533 U.S. 158, 160, 121 S.Ct. 2087, 150 L.Ed.2d 198
(2001) ; see Bd. of Cty. Comm'rs of San Juan Cty. v. Liberty Grp., 965 F.2d
879, 885 & n.4 (10th Cir. 1992) (collecting cases and noting predominant
view that § 1962(c) “require[s] that the ‘person’ and the ‘enterprise’
engaged in racketeering activities be different entities”). And we further
recognize that a plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant conducted

the affairs of the enterprise rather than simply conducting the defendant's
own affairs.
Summary
Under § 1962(c) of RICO, the "person" who conducts the enterprise's affairs
must be distinct from the "enterprise" itself. This distinction is crucial in
RICO cases to ensure that the entity conducting the racketeering activities
is separate from the entity that constitutes the enterprise. The Tenth Circuit
emphasizes that a plaintiff must show that the defendant was conducting the
affairs of the enterprise, not merely its own affairs. This requirement is
consistent with the broader interpretation of RICO across various
jurisdictions.

Defendants were charged under RICO, 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d), with conspiring
to violate 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). Section 1962(c) states: It shall be unlawful for
any person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the
activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or
participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs
through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt.
Summary
The passage provides insight into how the Tenth Circuit views the
relationship between a person and an enterprise under RICO. It highlights
that a person must be employed by or associated with an enterprise that is
engaged in or affects interstate or foreign commerce. The person must
conduct or participate in the conduct of the enterprise's affairs through a
pattern of racketeering activity. This distinction is crucial in understanding
the separate roles of the individual and the enterprise in RICO cases.

associates function as a continuing unit.' The Court also emphasized that the
concepts of an enterprise and a pattern of racketeering activity are distinct,
stating that '[w]hile the proof used to establish these separate elements may
in particular cases coalesce, proof of one does not necessarily establish the
other.' Id.
Summary
Clear distinction between a person and an enterprise under RICO by
defining what constitutes an enterprise and emphasizing the separation
between the enterprise and the pattern of racketeering activity. This
distinction is crucial in RICO cases to ensure that the entity being
prosecuted is indeed an enterprise as defined by law, separate from the
individual actions of a person.
United States v. DeLeon, No. CR 15-4268 JB (D. N.M. Jan 21, 2020)
U.S. District Court — District of New Mexico
Extract
RICO states that an enterprise 'includes any individual, partnership,
corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of
individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.' 18 U.S.C. § 1961.
VICAR employs a slightly narrower definition of the term 'enterprise' such
that it 'includes any partnership, corporation, association, or other legal
entity, and any union or group of individuals associated in fact although not
a legal entity, which is engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate
or foreign commerce.' 18 U.S.C. § 1959(b). 'An association-in-fact requires: a
purpose, relationships among those associated with the enterprise, and
longevity sufficient to permit those associated with the enterprise to pursue
the enterprise's purpose.' United States v. Kamahele, 748 F.3d 984, 1003
(10th Cir. 2014).
Summary
The passage provides definitions of "enterprise" under RICO and VICAR,
highlighting the distinction between a person and an enterprise. Under
RICO, an enterprise can be an individual or a group associated in fact, while
VICAR requires the enterprise to affect interstate commerce. The Tenth
Circuit, as seen in United States v. Kamahele, requires an association-in-fact
to have a purpose, relationships, and longevity. This distinction is crucial in
RICO cases to separate the individual actions from those of the enterprise.

U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
As the jury instructions and the predominant view in the cases make clear,
under § 1962(c) it is required that the 'person' and the 'enterprise' engaged
in racketeering activities be different entities. See Garbade v. Great Divide
Mining and Milling Corp., 831 F.2d 212, 213 (10th Cir.1987). The district
court took the position that the verdict against Liberty Group was supported
by the evidence that Liberty Group itself was the enterprise. Memorandum
Opinion and Order at 7-8. We are persuaded that this was error under the
cases cited. The language of the statute clearly contemplates that the
'person' charged will be distinct from the 'enterprise', since a person cannot
logically be 'employed by or associated with' himself. If Liberty Group is
found to have violated RICO, liability under § 1962(c) must be based on
Liberty Group's association with some entity separate from itself.
Summary
The Tenth Circuit requires that under RICO, the "person" and the
"enterprise" must be distinct entities. This distinction is necessary because a
person cannot be "employed by or associated with" themselves. The court
found that the district court erred in considering Liberty Group as both the
person and the enterprise, emphasizing that liability under § 1962(c) must
involve an association with a separate entity.

U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
The Marijuana Growers appear to suggest that these allegations are
insufficient because the Reillys also alleged that the corporate defendants
were separate, smaller RICO enterprises. So far as it goes, they are correct
that RICO 'requires that the ‘person’ conducting the enterprise's affairs be
distinct from the ‘enterprise.’ ' George, 833 F.3d at 1249 (citing Cedric
Kushner Promotions, Ltd. v. King, 533 U.S. 158, 160, 121 S.Ct. 2087, 150
L.Ed.2d 198 (2001) ). That is, 'a single person cannot be both the RICO
enterprise and the RICO defendant.' RJR, 136 S.Ct. at 2104 (citing Cedric,
533 U.S. at 162, 121 S.Ct. 2087 ).
Summary
The passage clearly outlines the requirement under RICO that the 'person'
conducting the enterprise's affairs must be distinct from the 'enterprise'
itself. This distinction is crucial in RICO cases to ensure that a single entity
is not both the defendant and the enterprise, which aligns with the
precedent set by Cedric Kushner Promotions, Ltd. v. King.

requires: (1) a purpose, (2) relationships among those associated with the
enterprise, and (3) longevity sufficient to permit those associated with the
enterprise to pursue the enterprise's purpose.' United States v. Kamahele,
748 F.3d 984, 1003 (10th Cir. 2014) (emphasis added).
Summary
Both VICAR and RICO statutes focus on regulating enterprises rather than
individuals. It provides a definition of "enterprise" under 18 U.S.C. § 1959(b)
(2), which includes various forms of legal entities and associations. The
passage further explains the requirements for an "association-in-fact," which
include a purpose, relationships among those associated, and sufficient
longevity to pursue the enterprise's purpose. This distinction is crucial in
understanding how the Tenth Circuit interprets the separation between
individuals and the enterprises they may be part of under RICO.
Roberts v. C.R. Eng., Inc., Case No. 2:12-CV-00302-RJS-BCW (D. Utah Jan
31, 2017)
U.S. District Court — District of Utah
Extract
The RICO statute makes it unlawful for 'any person employed by or
associated with any enterprise... to conduct or participate, directly or
indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of
racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt.' Interpreting the statute,
federal courts have held that 'the defendant 'person' must be an entity
distinct from the alleged 'enterprise.''... For example, in Brannon v.
Boatmen's First National Bank, the Tenth Circuit concluded that the
plaintiffs could not proceed on a claim arising under § 1962(c). The plaintiffs
alleged the defendant, a subsidiary, participated in an enterprise consisting
of its parent corporation. The Tenth Circuit held that merely alleging
participation within a corporate structure was not enough to satisfy the
distinctness requirement because a 'parent corporation, as a matter of
corporate reality, is nothing more than the controlling shareholder of a

=== PAGE 13 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
subsidiary.' The court noted that 'expanding RICO liability because of a
business organization choice makes little sense from a policy perspective.'
Because RICO applies only where the defendant participates in the
'enterprise's affairs, not just its own affairs,' the Tenth Circuit held the
plaintiff had alleged nothing more than a 'legitimate corporate and financial
relationship between [the defendant] and its holding company,' which was
insufficient under RICO.
Summary
The passage explains that under RICO, the defendant 'person' must be
distinct from the 'enterprise.' The Tenth Circuit, in Brannon v. Boatmen's
First National Bank, emphasized that a mere corporate structure, such as a
parent-subsidiary relationship, does not satisfy the distinctness requirement.
The court highlighted that RICO liability should not be expanded based on
business organization choices and that the defendant must participate in the
enterprise's affairs, not just its own. This interpretation is crucial for
understanding how the Tenth Circuit distinguishes between the person and
the enterprise under RICO.
Tal v. Hogan, 453 F.3d 1244 (10th Cir. 2006)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) makes it illegal 'for any person employed by or
associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect,
interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or
indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of
racketeering activity. . . .' To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a civil RICO
claim must allege the defendants (1) participated in the conduct (2) of an
enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity. Cayman
Exploration Corp., 873 F.2d at 1362; see Sedima, S.P.R.L., 473 U.S. at 496,
105 S.Ct. 3275. The Supreme Court has adopted the 'operation or
management' test to determine whether the defendant has conducted or
participated in the conduct of the enterprise by having some part in
directing the affairs of the enterprise. Reves v. Ernst & Young, 507 U.S. 170,
179, 113 S.Ct. 1163, 122 L.Ed.2d 525 (1993). 'For liability to be imposed
under that test, the defendants must have participated in the operation or
management of the RICO enterprise,' BancOklahoma Mortgage Corp., 194 F.
3d at 1100, 'although it is not necessary for the participant to have
significant control.' Resolution Trust Corp., 998 F.2d at 1541(internal
quotation omitted).
Summary
The passage provides insight into how the Tenth Circuit distinguishes
between the person and the enterprise under RICO by explaining the
requirements for a civil RICO claim. It highlights the necessity for a person

=== PAGE 14 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
to be distinct from the enterprise and to have participated in the operation
or management of the enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering
activity. The "operation or management" test is crucial in determining
whether the defendant has conducted or participated in the conduct of the
enterprise.
Plains Resources, Inc. v. Gable, 782 F.2d 883 (10th Cir. 1986)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
In sum, the language and history of the statute and the guidance from the
Court in Sedima and other courts cause us to reject the requirement that a
RICO plaintiff must aver and prove that the conduct described as
racketeering activity be connected to criminal conduct of an organized
nature.
Summary
The Tenth Circuit does not require a RICO plaintiff to prove that
racketeering activity is connected to organized crime. This suggests that the
court distinguishes between the person and the enterprise by focusing on
the statutory language and legislative intent, rather than requiring a
connection to traditional organized crime. The court emphasizes that RICO's
applicability is broader and not limited to traditional criminal organizations.
Grider v. Texas Oil & Gas Corp., 868 F.2d 1147 (10th Cir. 1989)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
18 U.S.C. Sec. 1962(c). The courts generally agree that the language of this
section does not permit the person who conducts the affairs of an enterprise
through racketeering activity to be one and the same as that enterprise.
See, e.g., Garbade v. Great Divide Mining & Milling Corp., 831 F.2d 212, 213
(10th Cir.1987); Schreiber Distrib. v. Serv-Well Furniture Co., 806 F.2d 1393,
1396 (9th Cir.1986); Morgan v. Bank of Waukegan, 804 F.2d 970, 977 (7th
Cir.1986). Under this construction, a corporation that conducts its own
affairs through racketeering activity is not within the ambit of section
1962(c).
Summary
A corporation cannot be both the person and the enterprise under this
section, which is a critical distinction in RICO cases.

Torwest DBC, Inc. v. Dick, 810 F.2d 925 (10th Cir. 1987)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
Section 1962(c), the substantive RICO violation at issue here, states that... A
violation of section 1962(c) thus 'requires (1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3)
through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity.' Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co.,
473 U.S. 479, 105 S.Ct. 3275, 3285, 87 L.Ed.2d 346 (1985).
Summary
Elements required for a RICO violation under section 1962(c), which
includes the conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering
activity. This implies a distinction between the "person" conducting the
activity and the "enterprise" through which the activity is conducted. The
person is the individual or entity engaging in the conduct, while the
enterprise is the structure or organization through which the racketeering
activity is carried out.
Skeet v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., 760 F. Supp. 872 (D. Kan. 1991)
U.S. District Court — District of Kansas
Extract
The court finds that plaintiff has failed to allege the existence of an
'enterprise' separate and distinct from the persons or defendants alleged to
have violated § 1962(c). ... The court further notes that courts generally
have held that under § 1962(c), the person and the enterprise must be
distinct. Smith v. MCI Telecommunications Corp., 678 F.Supp. 823, 827
(D.Kan.1987) (citations omitted). Moreover, the Tenth Circuit Court of
Appeals has recognized that a corporation cannot be both an 'enterprise'
and a 'person' within the meaning of the § 1962(c).
Summary
For a RICO claim under § 1962(c), the Tenth Circuit requires the
"enterprise" to be distinct from the "person" alleged to have violated RICO.
This means that a corporation cannot simultaneously be considered both the
"enterprise" and the "person" conducting racketeering activities. This
distinction is crucial for establishing a valid RICO claim in the Tenth Circuit.

=== PAGE 16 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
U.S. District Court — Western District of Oklahoma
Extract
Plaintiffs have not pled a plausible enterprise. They allege extensive criminal
conduct, perhaps sufficient to constitute a 'pattern of racketeering activity,'
with nothing to tie Defendants together. 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c); 18 U.S.C. §
1961(5). Plaintiffs do not allege a common purpose, nor do they plead a
relationship between Defendants, comprised of insurance companies,
hospitals, state and municipal actors, and federal agencies. Instead, the
complaint appears to employ RICO as an improper means of skirting the
statute of limitations by merging Plaintiffs' often-unrelated injuries—over a
decade of alleged sickness, abuse, contamination, and cover-ups committed
by countless actors—into one ongoing violation. Granted, proof of a pattern
of conduct and proof of an enterprise 'may... coalesce,' but 'proof of one does
not necessarily establish the other.' United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576,
583 (1981) ('The 'enterprise' is... an entity separate and apart from the
pattern of activity in which it engages.'); Crowe v. Clark, 552 F. App'x 796,
800 (10th Cir. 2014) (unpublished); Kearney v. Dimanna, 195 F. App'x 717,
721 (10th Cir. 2006) (quoting Handeen v. Lemaire, 112 F.3d 1339, 1352 (8th
Cir.1997)) ('In assessing whether an alleged enterprise has an ascertainable
structure distinct from that inherent in a pattern of racketeering, [we]
determine if the enterprise would still exist were the predicate acts removed
from the equation.').
Summary
The passage provides insight into how the Tenth Circuit distinguishes
between a person and an enterprise under RICO. It emphasizes that an
enterprise must have an ascertainable structure distinct from the pattern of
racketeering activity. The enterprise should exist independently of the
predicate acts of racketeering. This distinction is crucial in determining
whether a RICO claim is valid, as the enterprise must be separate from the
criminal conduct itself.
Andersen-Myers Co., Inc. v. Roach, 660 F.Supp. 106 (D. Kan. 1987)
U.S. District Court — District of Kansas
Extract
Defendant Roach claims that he is not a person within the meaning of 18
U.S.C. § 1962(c), and therefore cannot be sued for a RICO violation. 'Person'
is defined as 'any individual or entity capable of holding a legal or beneficial
interest in property.' 18 U.S.C. § 1961(3) (1982)... Defendant Roach extends
his argument to the more general question as to whether a state agency can
be the 'enterprise' through which racketeering activity is conducted... It will
suffice here to note that the definition of enterprise 'unambiguously
encompasses governmental units.'

=== PAGE 17 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
The passage provides insight into how the court interprets the definitions of
"person" and "enterprise" under RICO. It clarifies that a "person" under
RICO is any individual or entity capable of holding a legal or beneficial
interest in property, and that an "enterprise" can include governmental
units. This distinction is crucial in determining who can be sued under RICO
and what entities can be considered as conducting racketeering activity.

Kan. 2004)
U.S. District Court — District of Kansas
Extract
Section 1962(c) requires that 'the `person' and the `enterprise' engaged in
racketeering activities be different entities.' Bd. of County Comm'rs v.
Liberty Group, 965 F.2d 879, 885 (10th Cir.1992) (citation omitted). This
distinctness principle is satisfied if a plaintiff alleges that a corporate
employee conducted a corporation's affairs through illegal means. See
Cedric Kushner Promotions, Ltd. v. King, 533 U.S. 158, 163, 121 S.Ct. 2087,
150 L.Ed.2d 198 (2001) ('The corporate owner/employee, a natural person,
is distinct from the corporation itself, a legally different entity with different
rights and responsibilities due to its different legal status. And we can find
nothing in the statute that requires more `separateness' than that.'); Ad-X
Int'l, Inc. v. Kolbjornsen, 97 Fed. Appx. 263, 266 (10th Cir.2004) (citations
and internal citations omitted) ('Indeed, because the enterprise must be
separate from the pattern of racketeering activity itself, ... and distinct from
the person engaging in it, ... RICO requirements are most easily satisfied
when the enterprise is a formal legal entity').
Summary
The passage clearly outlines the requirement under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) that
the "person" and the "enterprise" must be distinct entities in a RICO claim.
This principle is supported by the Tenth Circuit's decision in Bd. of County
Comm'rs v. Liberty Group and further explained by the U.S. Supreme Court
in Cedric Kushner Promotions, Ltd. v. King. The passage also notes that this
distinctness is most easily satisfied when the enterprise is a formal legal
entity, as per Ad-X Int'l, Inc. v. Kolbjornsen.

The passage clearly outlines the Tenth Circuit's requirement that under
RICO, the 'person' and the 'enterprise' must be distinct entities. This
distinction is crucial for a valid RICO claim, as the court has dismissed
claims where the alleged persons and enterprise were the same.

Extract
Similarly, in Condict v. Condict, 815 F.2d 579 (10th Cir.1987), we held that a
family dispute over a family ranching operation amounted, at most, to a
garden variety fraud case, and did not fit the RICO mold entitling the injured
party to treble damages. Our reasoning was that the facts did not meet the
'continuity requirement' commented on in Torwest or the 'conduct of an
enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity' requirement of 18
U.S.C. Sec. 1962(c) discussed in footnote 14 in Sedima.
Summary
The passage references the case of Condict v. Condict, where the Tenth
Circuit held that a family dispute did not meet the RICO requirements
because it did not demonstrate the "continuity requirement" or the "conduct
of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity" as required by
18 U.S.C. Sec. 1962(c). This indicates that the Tenth Circuit requires a clear
distinction between the individual (person) and the enterprise, with the
latter needing to be involved in a pattern of racketeering activity that shows
continuity and is not merely a sporadic or isolated incident.

United States v. Martinez, 543 F.Supp.3d 1209 (D. N.M. 2021)
U.S. District Court — District of New Mexico
Extract
In United States v. Smith, the Tenth Circuit held that a defendant can be
convicted of a RICO conspiracy under § 1962(d) 'upon proof that the
defendant knew about or agreed to facilitate the commission of acts
sufficient to establish a [18 U.S.C.] § 1962(c) violation.' The Tenth Circuit
incorporated the elements of the substantive offense under § 1962(c) into §
1962(d)’s definition, saying: '[W]e hold that in order to convict a defendant
for violating § 1962(d), the Government must prove beyond a reasonable
doubt that the defendant: (1) by knowing about and agreeing to facilitate the
commission of two or more acts (2) constituting a pattern (3) of racketeering
activity (4) participates in (5) an enterprise (6) the activities of which affect
interstate or foreign commerce.'
Summary
The passage from United States v. Martinez provides insight into how the
Tenth Circuit distinguishes between the person and the enterprise under
RICO. It highlights that for a RICO conspiracy conviction under § 1962(d),
the government must prove that the defendant participated in an enterprise
whose activities affect interstate or foreign commerce. This indicates a
distinction between the individual (the person) and the collective entity (the
enterprise) involved in racketeering activities.

Colo. Mar 25, 2019)
U.S. District Court — District of Colorado
Extract
An enterprise is 'an entity separate and apart from the pattern [of
racketeering] in which it engages,' and its existence is proven 'by evidence
of an ongoing organization... and by evidence that the various associates
function as a continuing unit.' United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 583
(1981); see also Nat'l Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, Pa. v. Kozeny, 115 F.
Supp. 2d 1210, 1227 (D. Colo. 2000) (applying federal case law construing
RICO to COCCA). The enterprise must 'function as a continuing unit with an
existence beyond that necessary to commit the predicate acts and have an
identity distinct from that of the individual [d]efendants.' Nat'l Union, 115 F.
Supp. 2d at 1227.
Summary
The passage provides insight into how the Tenth Circuit, through the
application of federal case law, distinguishes between a person and an
enterprise under RICO. It emphasizes that an enterprise must be an entity
separate from the pattern of racketeering and must function as a continuing
unit with an identity distinct from the individual defendants. This distinction
is crucial in RICO cases to establish that the enterprise is not merely a
collection of individuals committing predicate acts but a separate entity with
its own structure and purpose.
Wade v. Gaither, 623 F.Supp.2d 1277 (D. Utah 2009)

To establish liability under § 1962(c), 'one must allege and prove the
existence of two distinct entities: (1) a `person'; and (2) an `enterprise' that
is not simply the `person' referred to by a different name.' ... The Tenth
Circuit has not yet decided the issue explicitly, though it has addressed
similar matters. In Ad-X Int'l, Inc. v. Kolbjornsen, 97 Fed.Appx. 263, 266
(10th Cir.2004), however, the Court found that a bankruptcy estate and the
estate's debtor should be considered legally distinct, and could constitute a
RICO enterprise and person respectively.

=== PAGE 21 ===

Summary
The passage provides insight into how the Tenth Circuit approaches the
distinction between a "person" and an "enterprise" under RICO. It
emphasizes the necessity of proving two distinct entities and references a
specific case, Ad-X Int'l, Inc. v. Kolbjornsen, where the court found a
bankruptcy estate and its debtor to be legally distinct entities. This suggests
that the Tenth Circuit requires a clear separation between the person and
the enterprise for RICO claims, although it has not explicitly decided the
issue in all contexts.
Garbade v. Great Divide Min. and Mill. Corp., 831 F.2d 212 (10th Cir. 1987)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
The complaint further alleges that the corporate defendant, Great Divide,
violated 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1962(c). The trial court dismissed the corporation on
the ground that it could not in these circumstances be both an 'enterprise'
and a 'person' within the purposes and wording of the section. We must
agree. Section 1962(c) makes it unlawful for a 'person' to enter the activities
of an 'enterprise' using racketeering activities. References are to 'employed
by' and 'associated with.' The section does not relate to corporate or
enterprise liability.
Summary
The Tenth Circuit distinguishes between a "person" and an "enterprise"
under RICO by emphasizing that a corporation cannot simultaneously be
both the "person" and the "enterprise" in the context of Section 1962(c).
This section specifically targets the unlawful conduct of a "person" who is
"employed by" or "associated with" an "enterprise" through racketeering
activities, and does not address corporate or enterprise liability directly.

It is well-settled in this circuit, as in most others, that for purposes of 18
U.S.C. 1962(c), the defendant 'person' must be an entity distinct from the
alleged 'enterprise.'

=== PAGE 22 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
The passage clearly states the legal principle that, under RICO, the
defendant 'person' must be distinct from the 'enterprise.' This distinction is
crucial for establishing a RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. 1962(c). The Tenth
Circuit follows this principle, which is consistent with the majority of other
circuits. This indicates that in RICO cases, the 'person' accused of
racketeering must be separate from the 'enterprise' through which the
racketeering activity is conducted.
Smith v. MCI Telecommunications Corp., 678 F.Supp. 823 (D. Kan. 1987)
U.S. District Court — District of Kansas
Extract
We are persuaded that the better approach is to not require that the
defendant/person be distinct from the enterprise. Such an approach
comports with the language of subsection (a) and the definitions of section
1961. Section 1961 defines a person to include a corporate defendant such
as MCI, and it defines an enterprise to include a corporation. See 18 U.S.C. §
1961(3), (4). Section 1962(a) makes it unlawful for any person, here MCI, to
use racketeering income in the operation of any enterprise engaged in
interstate commerce, again, here MCI. The language does not dictate that
the entity generating racketeering income and the entity using the income
in its operations be distinct.
Summary
The passage from the Smith v. MCI Telecommunications Corp. case provides
insight into how the Tenth Circuit approaches the distinction between the
person and the enterprise under RICO, specifically under 18 U.S.C. §
1962(a). The court concluded that the person and the enterprise need not be
distinct entities under this subsection. This interpretation aligns with the
language of the statute and the definitions provided in section 1961, which
include corporations as both persons and enterprises. This approach is
intended to further the purposes of RICO by allowing actions against
corporations that use racketeering income in their operations, even if they
are the same entity generating that income.

associated in fact although not a legal entity.” 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4) (2006). An
association-in-fact requires: (1) a purpose, (2) relationships among those
associated with the enterprise, and (3) longevity sufficient to permit those
associated with the enterprise to pursue the enterprise's purpose. See Boyle
v. United States, 556 U.S. 938, 946, 129 S.Ct. 2237, 173 L.Ed.2d 1265
(2009). An enterprise may exist even without a formal hierarchy, chain of
command, fixed roles, a name, established rules, initiation ceremonies, or
regular meetings. Id. at 948, 129 S.Ct. 2237. To qualify as an enterprise
under RICO, the association need only be a “continuing unit that functions
with a common purpose.” Id.; see United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576,
583, 101 S.Ct. 2524, 69 L.Ed.2d 246 (1981) (concluding that an association-
in-fact enterprise constitutes a “group of persons associated together for a
common purpose of engaging in a course of conduct”).
Summary
Detailed explanation of what constitutes an "enterprise" under RICO, as
interpreted by the Tenth Circuit. It distinguishes an enterprise from a
person by defining it as a group or association with a common purpose,
relationships among its members, and sufficient longevity. This definition is
crucial in differentiating the enterprise from the individuals involved, as the
enterprise is seen as a separate entity that can exist without formal
structures.

To establish liability under 1962(c), a plaintiff must prove the existence of
two distinct entities: (i) a 'person,' and (ii) an 'enterprise' that is not simply
the same 'person' referred to by a different name. (319) The Supreme Court
has elaborated on this distinction, holding that '[an] employee, a natural
person, is distinct from the corporation itself, a legally different entity with
different rights and responsibilities due to its different legal status.' (320)
Summary
Clear explanation of the requirement under RICO to distinguish between the
"person" and the "enterprise." It emphasizes that these must be two distinct
entities, as clarified by the Supreme Court, which is a principle applicable
across jurisdictions, including the Tenth Circuit.

Summary
The passage from the document provides a direct reference to a case
decided by the Tenth Circuit, Board of County Comm'rs v. Liberty Group,
which establishes the requirement that under section 1962(c) of RICO, the
person and the enterprise must be distinct entities. This indicates that the
Tenth Circuit adheres to the principle that a RICO defendant (the "person")
cannot be the same entity as the RICO enterprise. This distinction is crucial
for establishing liability under RICO in the Tenth Circuit.

Extract
To establish liability under [section] 1962(c), a plaintiff must prove the
existence of two distinct entities: (i) a 'person' and (ii) an 'enterprise' that is
separate and distinct from the 'person.' (325) The Supreme Court has
elaborated on this distinction, holding that '[an] employee, a natural person,
is distinct from the corporation itself, a legally different entity with different
rights and responsibilities due to its different legal status.' (326)
Summary
Clear explanation of the requirement under RICO section 1962(c) that there
must be two distinct entities: a "person" and an "enterprise." The Supreme
Court's elaboration further clarifies that an individual, such as an employee,
is distinct from a corporation, which is a separate legal entity. This
distinction is crucial in RICO cases to establish liability, ensuring that the
"person" and "enterprise" are not the same entity.

Summary
The passage provides insight into the requirement under RICO that the
"person" and "enterprise" must be distinct entities. This distinction is crucial
in RICO cases to ensure that the same entity is not improperly considered
both the perpetrator and the victim or target of the racketeering activity.
The passage also clarifies that this rule cannot be bypassed by using legal
doctrines such as respondeat superior, aiding and abetting, or conspiracy.
Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy
The Brief - American Bar Association - 2024-01-01
Extract
Section 1962(c) requires that the “person” who violates this section must be
distinct from the “enterprise” whose affairs that person is allegedly
conducting or participating in. It is because only the person and not the
enterprise can be liable under § 1962(c). The person and enterprise must be
separate entities. The violator of § 1962(c) who commits the pattern of
predicate racketeering acts must be distinct from the enterprise of predicate
racketeering acts whose affairs are thereby conducted.
Summary
Clear explanation of the legal requirement that the person and enterprise
must be separate entities, which is a fundamental aspect of RICO claims
under § 1962(c).
Santos v. Delta Airlines, Inc.
USDOL Administrative Review Board Decisions
Extract
RICO, 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), prohibits 'any person employed by or associated
with any enterprise engaged in ... interstate or foreign commerce, to
conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such
enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.' The statute
thus requires the plaintiff to allege an enterprise, the conduct of the affairs
of the enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity, and injury to
[its] business or property ... caused by the violation of Section 1962.
Summary
The passage provides insight into the statutory requirements under RICO,
specifically 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). It distinguishes between the "person" and
the "enterprise" by indicating that RICO prohibits any person associated

with an enterprise from conducting the enterprise's affairs through a
pattern of racketeering activity. This implies that the "person" is the
individual or entity engaged in the racketeering activity, while the
"enterprise" is the entity whose affairs are being conducted through such
activity. The statute requires a clear distinction between the two, as the
person must be separate from the enterprise to establish a RICO violation.

Fourth, for most RICO claims, the plaintiff also must plead that the alleged
'person' and 'enterprise,' as defined in RICO, are distinct. While often
technical, this 'distinctiveness' requirement provides that a corporation
generally will not be liable for operating an 'enterprise' consisting of itself
and its officers or employees. If a business is alleged to have violated RICO
based on intracompany actions, then the RICO claim has a good chance of
dismissal.
Summary
The passage explains the distinctiveness requirement under RICO, which is
crucial for distinguishing between the "person" and the "enterprise." This
requirement mandates that the "person" (the defendant) and the
"enterprise" (the entity through which the racketeering activity is
conducted) must be distinct entities. This is a general principle under RICO
law and is applicable in the Tenth Circuit as well as other circuits. The
passage specifically notes that a corporation cannot be both the "person"
and the "enterprise" if it consists solely of itself and its officers or
employees, which would lead to dismissal of the RICO claim.
RICO: A Primer

A plaintiff is required to demonstrate that the defendant conducted the
affairs of an enterprise though a pattern of racketeering activity. The person
and the enterprise generally must be distinct; but, of course, a Rico person
can be a part of an enterprise.
Summary
The passage from the document provides a clear explanation that under
RICO, the person and the enterprise must generally be distinct entities.
However, it also acknowledges that a RICO person can be a part of an
enterprise. This distinction is crucial in RICO cases to ensure that the
person accused of racketeering is not conflated with the enterprise itself,

which is a separate entity through which the racketeering activity is
conducted.

Summary
The Tenth Circuit, like other jurisdictions, requires a clear distinction
between the "person" and the "enterprise" in RICO claims. This
distinctiveness requirement is crucial because it prevents a corporation
from being held liable for RICO violations if the alleged enterprise consists
solely of the corporation and its officers or employees. This requirement is a
common defense against RICO claims, especially when the alleged violations
are based on intracompany actions.

and the enterprise generally must be distinct; but, of course, a Rico person

Summary
Under RICO, the person and the enterprise must generally be distinct
entities. This means that while a RICO person can be part of an enterprise,
they cannot be the enterprise itself. This distinction is crucial in RICO cases
to ensure that the person is not simply the enterprise in disguise, which
would undermine the purpose of the statute.
