Question
What are the fundamental types of legal documents, including petitions,
responses, motions, and orders, used in Texas family law cases (such as
divorce, custody, and child support), and what are their purposes and
procedural roles?
Answer (Texas)
Short response
The fundamental legal documents in Texas family law cases—such as
divorce, custody, and child support—include petitions, responses, motions,
and orders, each serving distinct procedural and substantive roles
throughout the litigation process. These documents initiate proceedings,
frame the issues, request judicial action, and formalize court decisions, as
governed by the Texas Family Code and interpreted by Texas courts.
Summary
Texas family law cases rely on a structured set of legal documents to
manage disputes involving divorce, child custody, child support, and related
matters. Petitions commence actions and set forth the claims, responses
allow opposing parties to contest or answer those claims, motions are used
to request specific interim or procedural relief, and orders are the court’s
formal rulings that resolve issues either temporarily or finally.
Each document type has specific statutory requirements and procedural
functions. Petitions and responses define the scope of the dispute, motions
facilitate the management and enforcement of rights during litigation, and
orders—whether temporary or final—impose binding obligations or grant
relief. The Texas Family Code provides detailed guidance on the content,
timing, and effect of these documents, ensuring due process and the orderly
administration of justice in family law matters.
Background and Relevant Law
Legislative and Regulatory Framework
The Texas Family Code is the primary legislative authority governing family
law proceedings in Texas. It prescribes the types, contents, and procedural
roles of legal documents used in cases involving divorce, child custody, child
support, termination or reinstatement of parental rights, and related
matters.

Petitions
A petition is the foundational document that initiates a family law case. For
example, in suits affecting the parent-child relationship (SAPCR), the
original petition sets forth the claims and requests for relief, such as
custody, support, or termination/reinstatement of parental rights. The Code
specifies who may file petitions and what they must contain, depending on
the relief sought:
Child Custody Enforcement: A verified petition is required to enforce
a child custody determination, and it must include certified copies of
relevant orders, jurisdictional information, and details about the parties
and child (Tex. Fam. Code § 152.308).
Reinstatement of Parental Rights: Only certain parties may file a
petition to reinstate parental rights, and the petition must be sworn and
include specific information about the prior termination and the
grounds for reinstatement (Tex. Fam. Code § 161.302).
Suspension of License for Child Support Arrearage: A child
support agency or obligee may file a petition to suspend a license if the
obligor is in significant arrears (Tex. Fam. Code § 232.004).
Service of citation is required upon filing a petition, ensuring that all
interested parties are notified and have an opportunity to respond (Tex.
Fam. Code § 102.009).
Responses
While the Family Code does not always use the term "response," it
contemplates responsive pleadings such as answers, counterpetitions, and
objections. For example, in modification proceedings, a party may file a
counterpetition to seek alternative relief (In re Farmer, 2023-03-01).
Responses serve to contest the claims in the petition, assert defenses, or
raise new issues.
Motions
Motions are written requests for the court to take specific action during the
course of a case. The Family Code and administrative rules provide for
various types of motions:
Motion for Enforcement: Used to compel compliance with temporary
or final orders, including child support and custody orders (Tex. Fam.
Code § 157.001).
Motion to Modify: Requests a change to an existing order based on a
material and substantial change in circumstances (In re A.L.E.,
2009-02-12).
General Motions: Any party may file a motion to request procedural
relief, such as changing a hearing date or seeking a ruling (1 Tex.
Admin. Code § 155.305).
•

• 
• 
• 
• 

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Motions must be filed in writing, specify the relief sought, and are not
effective until ruled upon by the judge.
Orders
Orders are the court’s formal decisions, which may be temporary (interim)
or final:
Temporary Orders: Issued to protect the safety and welfare of a child
or to maintain the status quo during litigation. These may address
conservatorship, support, restraining conduct, or other urgent matters
(Tex. Fam. Code § 105.001).
Final Orders: Resolve the substantive issues in the case, such as
divorce decrees, final custody determinations, or child support
obligations. Final orders must contain specific information, including
party identification and terms of relief (Tex. Fam. Code § 105.006).
Special Orders: The Code also provides for specialized orders, such as
those terminating or reinstating parental rights (Tex. Fam. Code §
161.206), adjudicating parentage (Tex. Fam. Code § 160.636), or
authorizing emergency removal of a child (Tex. Fam. Code § 262.102).
Orders may be subject to modification, enforcement, or appeal, depending
on their nature and the procedural posture of the case.
Case Law
Texas appellate decisions further clarify the procedural roles and
requirements for these documents:
Temporary Orders: Courts may issue temporary orders for the safety
and welfare of children, including conservatorship, support, and
restraining orders, but generally only after notice and a hearing (In re
K.M., 2018-04-18; In re Mcpeak, 2017-04-13).
Motions to Modify or Enforce: Parties may file motions to modify or
enforce existing orders, and the moving party must demonstrate a
material and substantial change in circumstances for modifications (In
re A.L.E., 2009-02-12).
Petitions and Counterpetitions: Both initial petitions and
counterpetitions are used to assert or contest claims regarding the
parent-child relationship (In re Farmer, 2023-03-01).
Finality of Orders: The Texas Supreme Court has emphasized the
need for clear indicia of finality in orders to determine appealability (In
re Interest of R.R.K., 2019-12-13).
Administrative Decisions and Secondary Materials
Administrative rules reinforce the requirement that motions must be in
writing and specify the requested relief (1 Tex. Admin. Code § 155.305).
Secondary materials provide practical checklists and guidance for drafting
pleadings and motions, highlighting the range of temporary orders that may
be necessary in family law litigation.

Analysis
Petitions
Purpose and Role:
A petition is the document that initiates a family law proceeding. It sets
forth the factual allegations, legal grounds, and specific relief sought by the
petitioner. In divorce, custody, and child support cases, the petition frames
the issues for litigation and triggers the requirement for service of citation
on all interested parties (Tex. Fam. Code § 102.009).
Types and Requirements:
Original Petition in SAPCR: Used to commence actions involving the
parent-child relationship, such as custody or support. Must identify the
parties, the child, and the relief sought.
Petition for Enforcement: In child custody enforcement, the petition
must be verified and include certified copies of the orders to be
enforced, as well as detailed information about jurisdiction and any
related proceedings (Tex. Fam. Code § 152.308).
Petition for Reinstatement of Parental Rights: Must be sworn,
include specific information about the prior termination, and comply
with notice requirements (Tex. Fam. Code § 161.302).
Petition for Suspension of License: Used to enforce child support by
seeking suspension of a delinquent obligor’s license (Tex. Fam. Code §
232.004).
Procedural Role:
The petition defines the scope of the dispute and the court’s jurisdiction. It
also triggers procedural protections, such as the right to notice and an
opportunity to respond.
Responses
Purpose and Role:
Responses allow the opposing party to contest the claims in the petition,
assert defenses, or raise new issues. While the Family Code does not always
use the term "response," it contemplates answers, counterpetitions, and
objections.
Types and Requirements:
Answer: The basic responsive pleading, which may admit or deny
allegations and assert affirmative defenses.
Counterpetition: Used to seek alternative or additional relief, such as
a different custody arrangement (In re Farmer, 2023-03-01).
Objections: May be filed in response to specific requests, such as
objections to a proposed child support review order (Tex. Fam. Code §
233.020).

Procedural Role:
Responses ensure adversarial process and due process by allowing all
parties to be heard and to present their positions.
Motions
Purpose and Role:
Motions are written requests for the court to take specific action during the
course of a case. They are essential for managing the litigation process,
seeking interim relief, or enforcing existing orders.
Types and Requirements:
Motion for Enforcement: Used to compel compliance with court
orders, including child support and custody orders. Must be filed in the
court of continuing, exclusive jurisdiction (Tex. Fam. Code § 157.001).
Motion to Modify: Requests a change to an existing order based on a
material and substantial change in circumstances (In re A.L.E.,
2009-02-12).
General Motions: May request procedural relief, such as changing a
hearing date or seeking a ruling (1 Tex. Admin. Code § 155.305).
Emergency Motions: In cases of imminent harm, a party may file a
verified application for a warrant to take physical custody of a child
(Tex. Fam. Code § 152.311).
Procedural Role:
Motions facilitate the efficient management of cases, allow parties to seek
necessary relief during litigation, and provide mechanisms for enforcement
and modification of orders.
Orders
Purpose and Role:
Orders are the court’s formal decisions, which may be temporary (interim)
or final. They impose binding obligations, grant relief, or resolve disputes.
Types and Requirements:
Temporary Orders: Issued to protect the safety and welfare of a child
or to maintain the status quo during litigation. May address
conservatorship, support, restraining conduct, or other urgent matters
(Tex. Fam. Code § 105.001; In re K.M., 2018-04-18).
Final Orders: Resolve the substantive issues in the case, such as
divorce decrees, final custody determinations, or child support
obligations. Must contain specific information, including party
identification and terms of relief (Tex. Fam. Code § 105.006).
Special Orders: Include orders terminating or reinstating parental
rights (Tex. Fam. Code § 161.206), adjudicating parentage (Tex. Fam.
Code § 160.636), or authorizing emergency removal of a child (Tex.
Fam. Code § 262.102).

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Procedural Role:
Orders formalize the court’s decisions, provide enforceable relief, and may
be subject to modification, enforcement, or appeal. Temporary orders are
generally issued after notice and a hearing, except in emergencies (Tex.
Fam. Code § 105.001; In re K.M., 2018-04-18).
Other Key Documents
Agreed Orders and Mediated Settlement Agreements: Parties may
resolve disputes through agreements, which can be incorporated into
court orders (In re Lee, 2013-09-27). Note: In re Lee has been
disagreed with by a subsequent case, but the general principle that
parties may settle and have their agreements incorporated into orders
remains valid.
Notices: Required for service of process and to inform parties of
hearings or proposed orders (Tex. Fam. Code § 102.009; Tex. Fam. Code
§ 233.0095).
Exceptions and Caveats
Emergency Orders: In cases of immediate danger to a child, courts
may issue temporary orders or restraining orders without prior notice
or a hearing, but only if statutory criteria are met (Tex. Fam. Code §
262.102).
Finality of Orders: Not all orders are immediately appealable. The
Texas Supreme Court has clarified that only orders with clear indicia of
finality are appealable (In re Interest of R.R.K., 2019-12-13).
Subsequent Negative Treatment: In re Lee (2013-09-27) was
disagreed with in a later case, but its discussion of Rule 11 agreements
and mediated settlements remains generally instructive for
understanding the procedural role of agreements in family law.
Conclusion
Texas family law cases are governed by a comprehensive statutory and
procedural framework that prescribes the use and function of fundamental
legal documents: petitions initiate proceedings and define the issues;
responses allow parties to contest or supplement claims; motions facilitate
interim relief, enforcement, or modification; and orders formalize the court’s
decisions, whether temporary or final. Each document type has specific
statutory requirements and procedural roles, ensuring due process and the
orderly resolution of family law disputes. The Texas Family Code, supported
by case law and administrative rules, provides detailed guidance on the
preparation, filing, and effect of these documents, which are essential to the
fair and efficient administration of justice in family law matters.

Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
In early 2014, the parties entered into a mediated settlement agreement
under which they agreed to share possession of the child. That agreement
was reduced to temporary orders in February 2015... Father moved to
modify the temporary orders based on a material change of circumstances
affecting the child. In its order granting that motion, the trial court found a
material change of circumstances... Based on those findings of changed
circumstances, which Mother does not contest, the court awarded Father
full custody of A.E.P. and appointed him sole managing conservator. Those
modified terms were thereafter incorporated into the Final Decree.
Summary
The passage provides insight into the procedural roles of various legal
documents in Texas family law cases. It mentions a mediated settlement
agreement (MSA), temporary orders, motions to modify orders, and a final
decree. The MSA is an agreement between parties that can be incorporated
into temporary orders by the court. Temporary orders are interim decisions
by the court that can be modified if there is a material change in
circumstances. A motion to modify is a request to change these orders based
on new circumstances. The final decree is the court's final decision,
incorporating any modifications made during the proceedings.
In re A.L.E., 279 S.W.3d 424 (Tex. App. 2009)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
In an effort to ensure stability and continuity for children, Texas law has
imposed 'significant hurdles' before a conservatorship order may be
modified. ... Specifically, a trial court may modify a conservatorship order if
modification would be in the child's best interest and 'the circumstances of
the child, a conservator, or other party affected by the order have materially
and substantially changed' since the previous order. Tex. Fam.Code Ann. §
156.101 (Vernon 2008). As a threshold determination, then, the moving
party must show a material and substantial change in circumstances;
otherwise, the petition must be denied.
Summary
The passage provides insight into the procedural role of petitions in Texas
family law, specifically regarding the modification of conservatorship orders.
It highlights the requirement for a petition to demonstrate a material and
substantial change in circumstances to be considered by the court. This is a

fundamental aspect of the procedural role of petitions in family law cases, as
it sets the threshold for court consideration.

Texas Supreme Court
Extract
Prior to the enactment of ADR provisions in section 153.0071, parties settled
family disputes by entering into agreements pursuant to Texas Rule of Civil
Procedure 11, Chapter 154 of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code, and
general principles of contract law. See In re Calderon, 96 S.W.3d 711, 717–
18 (Tex.App.–Tyler 2003, orig. proceeding). Rule 11 provides a mechanism
for parties or attorneys to narrow the issues before the trial court and
independently resolve other matters in a pending lawsuit through properly
executed written agreements.
Summary
The passage provides insight into the procedural roles of legal documents in
Texas family law cases. It highlights the use of Rule 11 agreements, which
are written agreements used to narrow issues before the trial court and
resolve matters independently in a pending lawsuit. This is relevant to
understanding the types of legal documents used in family law cases, as it
illustrates how parties can settle disputes outside of court through written
agreements.
In re L.J.K.
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Father now appeals on nine issues: 1) the parties' agreement for final orders
was a final order; 2) it was improper for Mother's attorney to sign the final
order as to form for Father's attorney; 3) the trial court's 2020 final order
failed to comply with the parties' 2018 agreement; 4) the cause should have
been dismissed for want of prosecution; 5) Father's attorney elicited perjury
at a contempt hearing related to the trial court's orders; 6) the trial court
improperly denied Father's motion for new trial on the mistaken belief that it
no longer had plenary power to grant it; 7) Mother did not give Father
proper notice under Rule 21a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure; 8) the
trial court ordered improper medical support; and 9) the trial court's
contempt order did not conform to the pleadings. Our review follows.

Summary
The passage provides insight into the types of legal documents and
procedural issues that can arise in Texas family law cases, such as final
orders, motions for new trial, and contempt orders. It highlights the
procedural roles of these documents, such as compliance with agreements,
proper notice, and the court's plenary power.
In re Interest of R.R.K., 590 S.W.3d 535 (Tex. 2019)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
In this case, we decide whether a memorandum order modifying possession
and child support is final and appealable, rendering the trial court's later
order void, and the mother's appeal untimely. Relying on a Mother Hubbard
clause, the court of appeals held that the memorandum order was the final
order, and it dismissed the mother's appeal for lack of jurisdiction. We
conclude that the memorandum order lacks 'clear and unequivocal' indicia
of finality, requiring an examination of the record to determine the trial
court's intent. See Lehmann v. Har-Con Corp., 39 S.W.3d 191, 205–06 (Tex.
2001); In re Elizondo, 544 S.W.3d 824, 827 (Tex. 2018) (per curiam). The
record in this case demonstrates that neither the trial court nor the parties
intended the memorandum to be the final order.
Summary
Procedural role of orders in Texas family law, specifically addressing the
finality of orders and the implications for appeals. It highlights the
importance of clear and unequivocal indicia of finality in orders, which is
crucial for determining whether an order is appealable. This is relevant to
understanding the procedural roles of orders in family law cases.

Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
For a covered suit, Title 5 of the Texas Family Code authorizes certain
temporary orders. Before rendering a final order, section 105.001 permits a
court to make a temporary order, including the modification of a prior
temporary order, for the safety and welfare of the child. Id. § 105.001. Such
temporary order may generally include an order for the temporary
conservatorship of the child, for the temporary support of the child,
restraining a party from disturbing the peace of the child or another party,
prohibiting a person from removing the child beyond a geographical area

identified by the court, or for payment of reasonable attorney's fees and
expenses. Id. § 105.001(a). However, except under circumstances that are
not applicable here, a temporary order may not be rendered for the
temporary conservatorship of the child 'except after notice and a hearing.'
Id. § 105.001(b).
Summary
The passage provides insight into the procedural role and purpose of
temporary orders in Texas family law cases. It explains that temporary
orders can be issued for the safety and welfare of the child, covering aspects
like temporary conservatorship, support, and restraining orders. The
passage also highlights the requirement of notice and a hearing before such
orders can be rendered, ensuring due process.
In re A.I.M.
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Pursuant to Section 105.002 of the Texas Family Code, a party may demand
a jury trial over certain matters involving conservatorship. Tex. Fam. Code §
105.002(a). A court may not submit questions to the jury concerning support
or 'a specific term or condition of possession of or access to [a] child.' Id. §
105.002(c)(2)(B). A party, however, is entitled to have a jury determine the
appointment of conservators, the parent with the right to designate the
primary residence of the child, and the need for any geographic restrictions
for the primary residence of the children. Id. § 105.002(c)(1). Section
105.002(c) states that in a jury trial, a party is entitled to a verdict by the
jury and the court may not contravene a jury verdict on the issues of: Id. §
105.002(c).
Summary
While a jury can determine certain issues like the appointment of
conservators and the designation of a child's primary residence, it cannot
decide on support or specific terms of possession or access. This delineation
of roles between the jury and the court is crucial in understanding the
procedural framework of family law cases in Texas.

Extract
This motion alleged that 'circumstances of the child or a person affected by
the order to be modified have materially and substantially changed since the
rendition of the order.' The motion further alleged that '[t]he terms and
conditions for possession and access by Petitioner are not in substantial
compliance with a standard possession order. . ..' The relief requested was
access or possession of the child be modified as provided by the Texas
Family Code. The motion also requested the entry of temporary orders. The
court held a hearing and thereafter entered the temporary orders, the
subject of this mandamus.
Summary
The passage provides insight into the procedural role of motions in Texas
family law cases, specifically motions to modify existing orders regarding
child possession and access. It highlights the use of motions to request
changes based on changed circumstances and the procedural step of
requesting temporary orders pending a final decision. The passage also
touches on the role of temporary orders in family law proceedings.
In re Chesser, No. 10-21-00039-CV (Tex. App. Jun 09, 2021)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
A trial court may enter temporary orders—including orders for the
temporary support of the child—and such temporary orders are not subject
to interlocutory appeal. See TEX. FAM. CODE ANN. § 105.001(a), (e). Thus,
a challenge to temporary orders in a suit affecting the parent-child
relationship is allowed through mandamus, as there is no adequate remedy
by appeal. See Little v. Daggett, 858 S.W.2d 368, 369 (Tex. 1993) (orig.
proceeding); see also In re Ostrofsky, 112 S.W.3d 925, 928 (Tex. App.—
Houston [14th Dist.] 2003, orig. proceeding).
Summary
The passage provides insight into the procedural role of temporary orders in
Texas family law cases. It explains that temporary orders can be issued by a
trial court for the temporary support of a child and that these orders are not
subject to interlocutory appeal. Instead, challenges to such orders can be
made through a petition for writ of mandamus, as there is no adequate
remedy by appeal. This highlights the procedural role of temporary orders
and the specific legal document (petition for writ of mandamus) used to
challenge them.

In re Mcpeak, 525 S.W.3d 310 (Tex. App. 2017)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
On November 22, 2016, Mother and Father executed and the trial court
approved Agreed Temporary Orders... Mother filed a motion to set aside the
Temporary Orders. On December 8, Mother filed a motion to modify the
Temporary Orders... On December 28, Mother filed a motion asking the trial
court to confer with the oldest child, who was 13 years old, pursuant to
section 153.009 of the Texas Family Code... The trial court heard these
motions on January 18, 2017, but stopped the hearing because Mother had
failed to file an affidavit that complied with section 156.102 of the Texas
Family Code... The Temporary Orders, by granting Father possession of the
children, had the effect of giving Father the exclusive right to designate the
children&#39;s primary residence. Mother filed a motion to modify the
Temporary Orders... Section 153.009(a) of the Texas Family Code provides
that at a hearing, on the application of a party, the court shall interview in
chambers a child twelve years of age or older regarding the child&#39;s
wishes as to the person who shall have the exclusive right to determine the
child&#39;s primary residence.
Summary
The passage provides insight into the types of legal documents used in Texas

Protective Services (the Department) filed its original petition in a suit
affecting the parent-child relationship (SAPCR), seeking the termination of
Mother’s parental rights to her son, K.B. (Kevin). The Department sought
emergency removal of Kevin from Mother, and the district court granted the
Department’s request. In September 2022, the district court held a full
adversary hearing. See Tex. Fam. Code § 262.201. According to the district
court’s docket notes, a copy of which has been included in the mandamus
record, the contested hearing was transcribed by the court reporter. The
docket notes also reflect that '[a]fter hearing testimony,' the district court
found that the Department had met its burden of proof, found that granting
the Department temporary managing conservatorship (TMC) of Kevin was in
Kevin’s best interest, and thus granted the Department TMC of Kevin.

In nearly every divorce case, there are temporary matters, motions, and the
like which have no bearing on the trial, and therefore, do not need to be
included in your trial notebook. 'Pertinent' might be the petition for
dissolution and answer only. It should include any petitions or motions that
have been continued to the trial for hearing and adjudication. If motions for
sanctions or other relief have been denied with leave to raise at trial or
reserved for adjudication at trial, they should be included. Pleadings that
contain judicial admissions should be included as well. If you don’t need to
refer to it at trial, it doesn’t belong in the trial notebook.
