Question
Explain the legal implications and seriousness when a regional presiding
judge david l evans for the 8th administrative region appoints a visiting
retired justice, John H. Cayce, before the effective date of May 19, 2025,
appointed 3 weeks earlier on May 6, 2025, in a family law matter when he
only specializes in civil, not family cases, and then this judge summarily
denies a recusal motion. This is fraud at the highest level.
Answer (Texas)
Short response
Appointing a retired justice to a family law case outside his certified
specialty and before the effective date of assignment may render the judge’s
actions void for lack of authority, and the summary denial of a recusal
motion by the assigned judge is a clear violation of mandatory Texas
procedure, also resulting in void orders. However, while these are serious
procedural and jurisdictional errors, the available authorities do not support
characterizing such conduct as “fraud at the highest level” absent evidence
of intentional deception.
Summary
Texas law strictly regulates the assignment of retired judges, requiring that
they be assigned only within their certified specialty (civil, criminal, or
domestic relations/family) and that their authority begins only on the
effective date specified in the assignment order. If a retired judge is
assigned to a family law case without the proper specialty or acts before the
effective date, any orders issued are likely void for lack of jurisdiction, and
parties may challenge such actions at any time.
Additionally, when a recusal motion is filed, the assigned judge must either
recuse himself or refer the motion to the regional presiding judge; a
summary denial by the challenged judge is a direct violation of Texas law
and renders all subsequent actions void. While these errors are grave and
undermine the integrity of the judicial process, the authorities provided do
not equate such procedural violations with criminal or civil fraud unless
there is evidence of intentional misrepresentation or deceit.
Background and Relevant Law
Legislative Framework
The assignment of retired and former judges in Texas is governed by
Chapter 74 of the Texas Government Code. Section 74.055 requires
presiding judges to maintain a list of eligible retired and former judges,

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
divided by area of specialty—criminal, civil, or domestic relations (family
law). Critically, a retired or former judge may only be assigned to cases
within their certified area of specialty, though a judge may qualify for more
than one specialty if properly certified. Amendments effective September 1,
2025, clarify eligibility and specialty requirements, but the core rule that
assignments must match the judge’s specialty remains operative and is not
new (Tex. Gov't. Code § 74.055).
Section 74.059 provides that an assigned judge has all the powers of the
judge of the court to which he is assigned, but also imposes a mandatory
duty: if a motion to recuse is filed, the judge must either recuse himself or
request the presiding judge to assign another judge to hear the recusal
motion. The assigned judge may not summarily deny the motion or rule on
its merits (Tex. Gov't. Code § 74.059).
Case Law
Texas appellate courts have repeatedly emphasized that the authority of an
assigned judge is strictly limited by the terms and effective dates of the
assignment order. If a judge acts outside the scope or before the effective
date of assignment, those actions are void for lack of authority (In re Moore,
No. 13-19-00551-CV (Tex. App. Dec. 19, 2019); In re State, 629 S.W.3d 715
(Tex. App. 2021)). The same principle applies if a judge is assigned to a case
outside his certified specialty under Section 74.055; such an assignment is
invalid, and any resulting orders are void (Hidalgo, In Interest of, 938 S.W.2d
492 (Tex. App. 1996)).
When a recusal motion is filed, Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a and
Section 74.059 require the challenged judge to either recuse himself or
refer the motion to the regional presiding judge for assignment of another
judge to hear the motion. The challenged judge may not summarily deny the
motion or take further action in the case until the recusal issue is resolved
(In re Norman, 191 S.W.3d 858 (Tex. App. 2006); In re PG & E Reata Energy,
4 S.W.3d 897 (Tex. App. 1999); Bruno v. State, 916 S.W.2d 4 (Tex. App.
1995)). Any orders issued in violation of this mandatory procedure are void.
The Texas Supreme Court has distinguished between constitutional
disqualification (which renders all actions void and is not waivable) and
statutory recusal (which, if denied, is generally subject to review on appeal
for abuse of discretion, but does not void subsequent actions unless the
judge flagrantly disregards mandatory procedures) (Union Pacific Resources
Co., In re, 969 S.W.2d 427 (Tex. 1998)).
Secondary Materials
Secondary sources confirm that a timely and facially sufficient recusal
motion triggers a mandatory process: the judge must either recuse or refer
the motion to the presiding judge, and a hearing must be held. Erroneous
denial of a recusal hearing warrants abatement, and denials are reviewed
for abuse of discretion on appeal (Pretrial Motions (2021)).

Analysis
1. Assignment of a Retired Judge Outside Specialty and
Before Effective Date
Specialty Requirement:
Section 74.055 of the Texas Government Code mandates that retired judges
may only be assigned to cases within their certified area of specialty—civil,
criminal, or domestic relations (family law). If a retired justice is certified
only in civil matters and is assigned to a family law case, the assignment is
invalid. The Texas Court of Appeals has held that the qualifications of a
retired judge to serve on assignment are jurisdictional and cannot be
waived; any orders issued by a judge lacking proper assignment or
qualifications are void (Hidalgo, In Interest of, 938 S.W.2d 492 (Tex. App.
1996)). This principle is reinforced by In re Moore, which states that the
authority of an assigned judge is strictly limited by the assignment order and
the judge’s qualifications.
Timing of Assignment:
The effective date of the assignment order is also critical. A judge’s
authority to act begins only on the effective date specified in the assignment
order. Any actions taken before that date are unauthorized and void (In re
Moore, No. 13-19-00551-CV (Tex. App. Dec. 19, 2019); In re State, 629 S.W.
3d 715 (Tex. App. 2021)). Thus, if a retired justice is appointed on May 6,
2025, but the assignment is not effective until May 19, 2025, any judicial
acts taken before May 19 are void for lack of authority.
Voidness and Jurisdiction:
The voidness of orders issued by an improperly assigned judge is a serious
matter. The Texas courts have likened the authority of a judge without a
valid assignment to that of a layperson; such a judge has no more
jurisdiction than a non-judge (Hidalgo, In Interest of, 938 S.W.2d 492 (Tex.
App. 1996)). This defect is not waivable and can be raised at any time, even
on appeal.
Subsequent Treatment:
It should be noted that Di Ferrante v. Smith, 940 S.W.2d 843 (Tex. App.
1997) was disapproved by the Texas Supreme Court in In re Canales, 52
S.W.3d 698 (Tex. 2001), but the core principle that an assigned judge’s
authority is limited by the assignment order and the judge’s qualifications
remains supported by other authorities, including Hidalgo, In Interest of and
In re Moore.
2. Summary Denial of a Recusal Motion
Mandatory Procedure:
When a recusal motion is filed, Texas law imposes a mandatory procedure:
the challenged judge must either recuse himself or refer the motion to the
regional presiding judge for assignment of another judge to hear the motion
(Tex. Gov't. Code § 74.059; In re Norman, 191 S.W.3d 858 (Tex. App. 2006); 
In re PG & E Reata Energy, 4 S.W.3d 897 (Tex. App. 1999)). The challenged

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
judge may not summarily deny the motion or rule on its merits, even if the
motion appears groundless or defective (Bruno v. State, 916 S.W.2d 4 (Tex.
App. 1995)).
Consequences of Violation:
If the challenged judge summarily denies the recusal motion and proceeds
to act in the case, all subsequent actions are void (In re Norman, 191 S.W.3d
858 (Tex. App. 2006)). This is a strict, mandatory rule, and the Texas courts
have repeatedly granted mandamus relief to correct such violations. The
requirement to refer the motion is not discretionary; it is a fundamental
procedural safeguard.
Review and Remedy:
While the denial of a recusal motion is generally reviewed for abuse of
discretion on appeal from final judgment (Union Pacific Resources Co., In re,
969 S.W.2d 427 (Tex. 1998)), when the judge violates the mandatory referral
procedure, mandamus relief is available, and the orders are void ab initio (In
re Norman, 191 S.W.3d 858 (Tex. App. 2006)). Secondary materials confirm
that a hearing is required on a timely, facially sufficient recusal motion, and
erroneous denial warrants abatement (Pretrial Motions (2021)).
3. Characterization as “Fraud”
Legal Definition of Fraud:
Fraud, in the legal sense, requires intentional misrepresentation or
concealment of a material fact with the intent to induce reliance and cause
harm. The authorities provided do not equate procedural or jurisdictional
errors—however serious—with fraud unless there is evidence of intentional
deception.
Application to Scenario:
While the assignment of a judge outside his specialty or before the effective
date, and the summary denial of a recusal motion, are grave violations of
Texas law and may undermine confidence in the judicial process, they do
not, without more, constitute fraud. The authorities provided do not support
labeling such conduct as “fraud at the highest level” in the absence of
evidence that the judge or presiding judge acted with intent to deceive or
defraud the parties or the court.
Exceptions and Caveats
Waiver and Timeliness:
Some defects in the assignment of a judge or in the recusal process can
be waived if not timely objected to, particularly if the defect is statutory
rather than constitutional (In re Belew (Tex. App. Mar. 15, 2024)).
However, jurisdictional defects—such as lack of proper assignment or
lack of specialty—are not waivable and can be raised at any time
(Hidalgo, In Interest of, 938 S.W.2d 492 (Tex. App. 1996)).
Subsequent Negative Treatment:
In re State, 629 S.W.3d 715 (Tex. App. 2021) was superseded by In re
• 
• 

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
State ex rel. Wice, 668 S.W.3d 662 (Tex. Crim. App. 2023), but the
principle that a visiting judge’s authority is limited by the assignment
order and effective date remains supported by other authorities.
Scope of Voidness:
Not all errors in assignment or recusal procedure render all actions
void. Only jurisdictional defects—such as lack of authority to act—result
in void orders. Procedural errors in denying a recusal motion may be
subject to appellate review for abuse of discretion unless the judge
flagrantly disregards mandatory procedures (Union Pacific Resources
Co., In re, 969 S.W.2d 427 (Tex. 1998)).
Conclusion
In summary, Texas law requires that retired judges be assigned only within
their certified specialty and that their authority begins only on the effective
date of the assignment order. Any judicial acts taken outside these
parameters are void for lack of authority. When a recusal motion is filed, the
assigned judge must either recuse himself or refer the motion to the
regional presiding judge; a summary denial is a clear violation of mandatory
procedure and renders all subsequent actions void. While these are serious
violations that may warrant mandamus relief and abatement of proceedings,
the authorities provided do not support characterizing such conduct as
“fraud” absent evidence of intentional deception. The most serious legal
implication is the voidness of all orders issued by a judge acting without
proper authority or in violation of mandatory recusal procedures.
Legal Authorities
Di Ferrante v. Smith, 940 S.W.2d 843 (Tex. App. 1997)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Section 74.053 applies only 'when a judge is assigned under this chapter.'
Chapter 74 deals with the appointment of visiting judges by the presiding
judge of the administrative judicial region to sit for an elected judge. This
section has been interpreted by the appellate courts to be applicable only
when a judge is assigned by the presiding judge of the administrative
judicial region pursuant to this chapter... It may be real parties' in interest
position that, even if relator could not exercise a Section 74.053 objection in
advance of the assignment, he could nevertheless waive that objection in
advance by failing to object before respondent presided over a non-recusal
matter... Presiding Judge Stovall's November 2, 1995 order assigned
respondent to the 328th District Court for the limited purpose of hearing
relator's recusal motion. Thus, respondent had no authority to preside over
any other matter in the case at that time.

Summary
The case clarifies that § 74.053 peremptory objection applies only when a
judge is assigned by the presiding judge under Chapter 74. It also
emphasizes that when an assignment order limits an assigned/visiting judge
to a specific purpose (e.g., hearing a recusal), that judge lacks authority to
act beyond that limited scope. It further touches on timing and waiver of §
74.053 objections. This bears on whether a visiting judge’s actions are
authorized and whether parties can object to the assignment. It does not
address specialty (civil vs. family) or “fraud,” nor the effective-date issue
directly, but it is relevant to the legality and scope of the assignment and
objections to visiting judges in Texas.
Union Pacific Resources Co., In re, 969 S.W.2d 427 (Tex. 1998)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
Judges may be removed from a particular case either because they are
constitutionally disqualified, TEX. CONST. art. V, § 11, because they are
subject to a statutory strike, TEX. GOV'T CODE § 74.053(d), or because they
are recused under rules promulgated by this Court. TEX.R. CIV. P. 18a, 18b;
TEX.R.APP. P. 16. The grounds and procedures for each type of removal are
fundamentally different. ... When a judge continues to sit in violation of a
constitutional proscription, mandamus is available to compel the judge's
mandatory disqualification ... because any orders or judgments rendered by
a judge who is constitutionally disqualified are void and without effect. ...
Likewise, on timely objection, the disqualification of an assigned judge who
is not a retired judge is mandatory under section 74.053(d) ... and any
orders entered by a trial judge in a case in which he is disqualified are
void. ... In contrast, the erroneous denial of a recusal motion does not void
or nullify the presiding judge's subsequent acts. While a judgment rendered
in such circumstances may be reversed on appeal, it is not fundamental
error and can be waived if not raised by proper motion. ... Recognizing this
distinction, our Rules of Civil Procedure expressly provide for appellate
review from a final judgment after denial of a recusal motion. ... If the
appellate court determines that the judge presiding over the recusal hearing
abused his or her discretion in denying the motion and the trial judge should
have been recused, the appellate court can reverse the trial court's
judgment and remand for a new trial before a different judge. ... HECHT,
Justice, concurring. ... The rule that appeal affords an adequate remedy for
an erroneous denial of a motion to recuse cannot be without exceptions. ...
mandamus may be appropriate when a judge has flagrantly refused to follow
procedural rules ... or when the ruling is almost certain to require a reversal
of the final judgment on appeal....

Summary
The case delineates (1) constitutional disqualification and certain statutory
disqualifications render orders void and are correctable by mandamus
without showing inadequate appellate remedy; (2) denied recusal is error
correctable on appeal, not voiding subsequent acts, though extraordinary
mandamus may be available if procedural rules are flagrantly disregarded or
reversal is nearly certain. It does not address specialty mismatch (civil vs.
family) as a ground for disqualification nor the effective-date issue directly,
but it frames how to analyze whether the judge’s participation is void (if
disqualified by law) versus merely erroneous (recusal denial), and the
appropriate remedies.
Ex parte Thuesen, 546 S.W.3d 145 (Tex. Crim. App. 2017)
Texas Court of Criminal Appeals
Extract
For the reasons explained below, we hold that the judge did not have
authority to take any further action after signing the voluntary recusal order.
We therefore restore this matter to its position immediately following the
replacement judge's assignment to the case and remand it to the trial court
for further proceedings." ... "The State argues that Texas law provides that,
after a judge voluntarily recuses himself, he can take no further action.
Thus, in the absence of any subsequent written order signed by Judge
Underwood, Judge Bryan did not have judicial authority to sign and execute
the order reinstating himself on applicant's case, and his subsequent rulings
are void." ... "The Dallas court also held that, '[e]xcept for good cause stated
in the order in which any further action is taken,' the judge who recused
himself 'can make no further orders.'" ... "Section 24.002 of the Texas
Government Code ... the judge shall enter a recusal order, request the
presiding judge of that administrative judicial region to assign another judge
to sit, and take no further action in the case except for good cause stated in
the order in which the action is taken." ... "once a district judge signs an
order recusing himself or herself under the statute, the recused judge no
longer has any judicial authority to take any action or sign any orders in the
case. The statute provides only one exception: the recused judge may sign
an order in the case if that order contains within it a statement of 'good
cause.'
Summary
The passages establish that once a judge voluntarily recuses, he “can take
no further action” absent good cause stated in the order, and actions taken
without authority are void. They also confirm the presiding judge’s role in
assigning a replacement. The materials do not address whether appointing a
retired justice before an “effective date” is improper, nor whether a visiting
judge’s subject-matter experience (civil vs. family) affects authority. They

also do not define “fraud.” They are relevant to the recusal/authority issue
and potential voidness of orders if a recused or unauthorized judge acts.

Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Rule 18a(f) expressly confers the authority to reassign a case following a
recusal to the regional presiding judge of the administrative judicial
district." ... "We hold that Judge Herman's first minute order is void because
Rule 18a vests Judge Underwood with the power to assign a new judge to
hear the underlying case." ... "Section 25.00255 and Rule 18a both empower
Judge Underwood, not Judge Herman, to reassign the case when a judge
recuses himself on a party's motion. ... Minute orders four, five, and six are
void." ... "If the motion is denied, it may be reviewed for abuse of discretion
on appeal from the final judgment.
Summary
The case confirms (1) only the regional presiding judge has authority under
Rule 18a(f) to assign a judge after recusal is granted; orders by others are
void. (2) Denial of a recusal motion is reviewable for abuse of discretion on
appeal from final judgment. It does not address early-effective-date
appointments, specialty qualifications (civil vs. family), or label conduct as
fraud. It supports challenging void appointments and the proper avenue to
review recusal denials.

Extract
Rule 18a addresses the requirements of a motion for recusal or
disqualification of trial court judges... (c) Prior to any further proceedings in
the case, the judge shall either recuse himself or request the presiding judge
of the administrative judicial district to assign a judge to hear such motion...
(d) If the judge declines to recuse himself, he shall forward to the presiding
judge of the administrative judicial district ... an order of referral, the
motion, and all opposing and concurring statements. Except for good cause
stated in the order in which further action is taken, the judge shall make no
further orders and shall take no further action in the case after filing of the
motion and prior to a hearing on the motion." ... "In Winfield v. Daggett... the
trial judge erred in refusing to either recuse himself or refer the motion for
hearing to the administrative judge. Once the trial judge refused to recuse
himself, he had a duty to forward the motion to the presiding judge..." ...

"because the unverified motion did not comply with rule 18a, the trial judge
did not err by failing to refer the motion..." ... "judge subject of recusal
motion has no authority to rule on the timeliness of motion... cannot rule on
the merits of the motion, even if he believes the motion to be groundless and
brought in bad faith... cannot rule on whether the motion was properly
verified." ... "Section 74.059 reads as follows: (a) A judge assigned under the
provisions of this chapter has all the powers of the judge of the court to
which he is assigned... (c) A district or statutory county court judge shall: (3)
request the presiding judge to assign another judge to hear a motion
relating to the recusal of the judge from a case pending in his court.
Summary
The passages establish: (1) When a verified and timely Rule 18a recusal
motion is filed, the challenged judge must recuse or refer the motion to the
regional presiding judge; the challenged judge cannot rule on the motion’s
merits, timeliness, or verification. (2) If the motion is defective (e.g.,
unverified or untimely), mandatory recuse-or-refer is not triggered. (3) An
assigned judge under § 74.059 has full powers of the court to which
assigned. The passages do not address specialty/subject-matter expertise of
an assigned judge, effective dates of assignments, or whether an early/
ineffective assignment constitutes “fraud.” They do illuminate that summary
denial by the challenged judge would violate Rule 18a if the motion was
compliant.
In re Belew
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure 33.1(a) provides that, in general, '[a]s a
prerequisite to presenting a complaint for appellate review, the record must
show that. .. the complaint was made to the trial court by a timely request,
objection, or motion.' No objection was lodged below to Judge Harle's
assignment. No opportunity was afforded Judge Ables to make a different
assignment if there were a problem with this assignment. While some acts of
constitutionally disqualified judges are void, and can be raised for the first
time on appeal, see Buckholts Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Glaser, 632 S.W.2d 146,
148 (Tex. 1982), no similar exception would apply to a statutory or common-
law-based claim. We conclude the common law self-appointment argument,
whatever its merit, is waived. ... [S]ome failures in a judge's qualifications—
even those required by the Texas Constitution—require timely objection. ...
Conversely, the failure to meet other constitutional provisions renders a
judge's actions void, which can be raised for the first time on appeal.
Summary
- Challenges to an assigned/visiting judge typically must be preserved by a
timely objection in the trial court under TRAP 33.1(a). - Only certain

=== PAGE 10 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
constitutional disqualifications render actions void and can be raised for the
first time; statutory/common-law defects (e.g., assignment irregularities,
common-law self-appointment) are waivable if not timely objected to. - Some
constitutional qualification defects also require timely objection (e.g., oath
issues), while others (e.g., constitutional disqualification under Tex. Const.
art. V, § 11) may render actions void. - Thus, arguing that an appointment
was premature/effective-date error or that the appointee’s background is
civil rather than family is likely a waivable assignment/qualification
complaint unless it fits within a narrow constitutional disqualification that
renders the orders void.
In re Norman, 191 S.W.3d 858 (Tex. App. 2006)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Denial of a motion to recuse is appealable upon final judgment. TEX.R. CIV.
P. 18a(f). Thus, a relator challenging the denial of a recusal motion ordinarily
has an adequate remedy by appeal of the denial of a motion to recuse.
However, mandamus relief is available when a judge violates a mandatory
statutory duty either to recuse or refer a motion to recuse.... Under Texas
Rule of Civil Procedure 18a, Judge Austin had a mandatory duty either to
recuse himself or to refer the recusal motion to the presiding judge.... Judge
Austin did not have the option of denying the motion.... Even though a
motion to recuse may be defective, the challenged judge must either recuse
or refer the motion, so that another judge can determine the procedural
adequacy and merits of the motion to recuse.... Once the motion to recuse
Judge Austin was filed, Judge Austin was precluded from taking any further
action other than issuing an order of recusal of himself or an order of
referral to the presiding judge.... If a judge fails to comply with the rules
governing motions for recusal, all subsequent actions by the judge in that
case are void.... Judge Austin had a mandatory duty either to recuse himself
or refer the motion to the presiding judge, and it was a violation of that duty
to deny the motion. Both orders signed by Judge Austin on December 20,
2005, are void. We conditionally grant the petition for writ of mandamus.
Summary
The case squarely addresses the procedural duty when a recusal motion is
filed: the challenged judge must either recuse or refer to the regional
presiding judge. Denying the motion outright is a violation, and any
subsequent orders by the challenged judge are void. It also clarifies that
defects in the motion do not allow the challenged judge to deny it; only the
assigned judge may pass on adequacy/merits. This is directly relevant to the
“summary denial” aspect of the question. The passages do not address
appointment timing/effective-date issues or subject-matter specialization of
an assigned/visiting judge.

Stafford v. State, 948 S.W.2d 921 (Tex. App. 1997)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Accordingly, we believe that the weight of authority requires a motion to
disqualify to be handled under the same procedural requirements as is a
motion to recuse. TEX. GOV'T CODE ANN. § 74.059(c)(3) (Vernon Supp.
1997). ... It is apparent that the trial judge should have immediately referred
this issue to an appointed judge for hearing and decision. Kemp, 846 S.W.2d
at 305." ... "To hold that a hearing and ruling by another judge on a motion
to recuse is subject to the harmless error rule on appeal renders the rule
and the statute meaningless. ... I dissent because I believe that the rule
requiring the assignment of another judge to hear a recusal motion is
mandatory. ... The Texas Supreme Court in McLeod found that the duty to
have an assigned judge hear any motion to recuse is mandatory and found
that a mandamus would issue for the failure to comply with this statute. ... I
dissent because I believe this matter should be returned to the trial court for
a hearing on the motion to recuse." ... "The ten-day requirement of Rule 18a
is not absolute and does not contemplate the situation in which a party
cannot know the basis of the recusal until after a motion for recusal is no
longer timely.
Summary
Based on Stafford, a motion to disqualify is processed under the same
procedures as a motion to recuse, and the judge whose recusal is sought
should not decide it; it must be referred to another judge. Failure to refer is
error; some authority treats assignment as mandatory and subject to
mandamus. Rule 18a’s 10-day timing can be flexible when grounds weren’t
earlier knowable. This informs the legal implications of a judge summarily
denying a recusal motion and supports procedural challenge/mandamus.
The passages do not address appointment timing of a visiting judge or
subject-matter specialization; they address only recusal/disqualification
procedure.

It appears that Ridgeway instead should have cited the statutes dealing with
the assignment of judges... It would be appropriate to look at Sections
74.052, 74.054, 74.055, and 74.056 of the Government Code... The effect of
an objection to an assigned judge is more in the nature of a recusal motion
than a motion raising the judge's disqualification... Ridgeway has not
challenged the decision on the basis that some error was made in not
allowing her to exercise her recusal motion, but she challenges the

=== PAGE 12 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
judgment as void on the basis that the judge was not properly assigned and
had no authority in the case. Unless there is a valid assignment of a visiting
judge or retired judge, that judge has no more jurisdiction to hear the case
than the waiter at the Dairy Queen. In Houston General Ins. Co. v. Ater, the
court held that the qualifications of a retired judge to serve on assignment is
a jurisdictional question which cannot be waived and which can be raised at
any time... In the present case, Ridgeway has challenged the validity of the
appointment and asked this Court to declare that any judgment made by the
assigned judge be declared void. This challenge was not waived by failure to
object at the time of trial under the recusal objection of the Government
Code.
Summary
The passage distinguishes between (1) recusal challenges under § 74.053,
which can be waived, and (2) attacks on the validity of a visiting judge’s
assignment and qualifications under §§ 74.052–.056, which implicate
jurisdiction and are not waived. It states that an invalid assignment renders
the visiting judge without authority and any resulting judgment void, and
that such defects can be raised at any time. It does not address specialty
(family vs. civil) as a qualification, nor the timing specifics, but it identifies
the correct statutory framework and the seriousness (voidness) of an invalid
assignment.

Further, the presiding judge of an administrative judicial region is
authorized to assign judges in the region to 'try cases and dispose of

from further proceedings conducted by a trial judge who lacks authority to
rule.
Summary
The passages establish (1) regional presiding judges have statutory
authority to assign visiting judges; (2) an assigned judge’s authority derives
from, and is limited by, the express terms and effective dates in the
assignment order; (3) parties may file a timely objection under §74.053 that
automatically disqualifies the assigned judge; (4) after a recusal, only the
regional presiding judge may reassign under Rule 18a, which is mandatory;
and (5) if a judge without authority acts, mandamus may issue because
appeal is inadequate.
In re State, 629 S.W.3d 715 (Tex. App. 2021)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
A judge sitting by order of assignment 'has all the powers of the judge of the
court to which he is assigned.' TEX. GOV'T CODE ANN. § 74.059(a).
Generally, visiting judges are assigned either to a particular case or for a
period of time... Typical assignment orders provide that the visiting judge's
authority terminates on a date specified in the assignment order or on the
occurrence of a specific event, such as the signing of a judgment or ruling
on a motion for new trial... The relator bears the burden of showing
entitlement to mandamus relief... There is nothing in the mandamus record
showing that Judge Gallagher... agreed to exchange benches pursuant to
Texas Constitution Article V, section 11. We therefore conclude that the
State has failed to meet its burden of showing that Judge Gallagher
continued to have authority to sit in the underlying cases past the expiration
of the assignment orders." "These provisions, which by their terms, are
limited to intra-county exchange of benches, do not affect our disposition of
the petition for writ of mandamus.
Summary
The case clarifies that (1) a visiting judge’s power derives from the order of
assignment and is coextensive with the assigned court while the assignment
is effective; (2) authority begins and ends per the terms of the assignment
order or triggering events; (3) after expiration, the judge lacks authority
absent a proper exchange of benches that must be shown in the record and
is limited to intra-county exchanges; and (4) the party challenging must
carry the burden to show lack of authority. It does not address subject-
matter specialization as a basis to invalidate an assignment or allegations of
“fraud,” but it is directly relevant to whether an assignment made effective
on certain dates is valid and whether actions before/after the effective
period are authorized.

In re PG & E Reata Energy, et al, 4 S.W.3d 897 (Tex. App. 1999)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Recusal is governed by Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a, which requires
the judge against whom a proper recusal motion is filed to either grant the
motion or request the Presiding Judge to assign another judge to hear the
motion. TEX. R. CIV. P. 18a(c); see also TEX. GOV'T CODE ANN. 74.059(c)(3)
(Vernon 1998) (providing for requested assignment by the presiding
judge). ... We held in In re Rio Grande Valley Gas that Judge Gonzalez's
transfer of the Recusal Cases was void because after a motion to recuse has
been filed, a judge must either recuse himself or herself or request the
presiding judge to assign a judge to hear the recusal motion 'prior to any
further proceedings in the case.' ... We further held that because motions to
recuse were pending against Judge Aparicio in each of the Recusal Cases, he
could take no action in those cases other than issue an order of recusal or
referral. ... Once rule 18a was properly invoked, only Judge Hester, the
regional presiding judge (or in certain circumstances, the Chief Justice of
the Texas Supreme Court), had authority to appoint a judge to hear the
recusal motion and sit over the case when the motion was granted. ... The
language of rule 18a regarding appointment by the presiding judge
following recusal is also mandatory, not permissive. Rule 18a(f) specifically
states that '[i]f the motion [to recuse] is granted, the order shall not be
reviewable, and the presiding judge shall assign another judge to sit in the
case.' TEX. R. CIV. P. 18a(f) (emphasis supplied). ... Prior to any further
proceedings in the case, the judge shall either recuse himself or request the
presiding judge of the administrative judicial district to assign a judge to
hear such motion. TEX. R. CIV. P. 18a(c). ... Section 74.059(c)(3) provides, in
pertinent part: (c) A district, statutory probate, or statutory county court
judge shall: ... (3) request the presiding judge to assign another judge to
hear a motion relating to the recusal of the judge from a case pending in his
court[.]
Summary
- When a proper Rule 18a motion to recuse is filed, the challenged judge
must either recuse or refer the motion to the regional presiding judge; the
judge may take no other action in the case until the motion is resolved. -
Only the regional presiding judge (or in limited instances the Supreme
Court) has authority to assign a judge to hear the recusal motion, and if
granted, to sit in the case. - The assignment authority and the mandatory
nature of referral/assignment are emphasized; actions contrary to these
mandates are void. - The passages do not address the effective-date timing
of an assignment, subject-matter specialization of an assigned retired
justice, or the merits of summarily denying a recusal motion beyond the
procedural requirements. They also do not address “fraud.”

Tex. Gov't. Code § 74.055 Tex. Gov't. Code § 74.055 List of Retired and
Former Judges Subject to Assignment
Extract
(a) Each presiding judge shall maintain a list of retired and former judges
who meet the requirements of this section. (b) The presiding judge shall
divide the list into area specialties of criminal, civil, or domestic relations
cases. A retired or former judge may only be assigned to a case in the
judge's area of specialty. A judge may qualify for assignment in more than
one area of specialty. ... (e) For purposes of Subsection (c), a month of
service is calculated as a calendar month or a portion of a calendar month in
which a judge was authorized by election or appointment to preside. ...
History: Amended by Acts 2025, Texas Acts of the 89th Leg.- Regular
Session, ch. (number not assigned at time of publication), Sec. 3, eff.
9/1/2025. ... Sec. 65, eff. 9/1/2025, app. to civil actions commenced on or
after September 1, 2024. ... Cite as: Tex. Gov't. Code § 74.055
Summary
The statute requires presiding judges to keep a list of retired/former judges
and to assign them only within their certified specialty areas (criminal, civil,
or domestic relations). It also sets eligibility/qualification requirements and
effective dates for amendments. The quoted language bears on whether a
presiding judge may assign a retired justice who lacks the proper “domestic
relations” specialty to a family case. It does not address recusal standards or
“fraud,” nor does it govern the timing of an “effective date” for a specific
appointment other than through general eligibility/listing and applicability
clauses.
Tex. Gov't. Code § 74.059 Tex. Gov't. Code § 74.059 Powers and Duties
Extract
A judge assigned under the provisions of this chapter has all the powers of
the judge of the court to which he is assigned." ... "A district, statutory
probate, or statutory county court judge shall: ... request the presiding judge
to assign another judge to hear a motion relating to the recusal of the judge
from a case pending in his court
Summary
- When a judge is assigned under Chapter 74, that assigned judge has the
full powers of the sitting judge of that court, regardless of the judge’s prior
specialization. - For recusal motions, the judge whose recusal is sought must
request the presiding judge to assign another judge to hear the recusal
motion; the judge may not summarily decide his own recusal motion. - The
statute does not address effective dates of assignments or pre-effective-date

Texas Criminal Lawyer's Handbook. Volume 1 - 2021 - James
Publishing - Mark G. Daniel, Robert K. Gill - 2021-08-16
Extract
A Texas judge may be removed from presiding over a case for one of three
reasons: he is constitutionally disqualified; he is subject to a statutory strike
(as in civil cases); or he is subject to statutory disqualification or recusal
under Texas Supreme Court rules. Gaal v. State, 332 S.W.3d 448 (Tex. Crim.
App. 2011)." ... "Rule 18b(2) of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure sets out
the law concerning recusal..." ... "Once a sufficient motion to recuse has
been filed, before proceeding further in the case, the judge must either
recuse himself or request the presiding judge of the administrative judicial
district to assign a judge to hear the motion under Tex. Gov’t Code
§74.059(c)(3)." ... "If a recusal motion is timely filed and facially sufficient, a
hearing must be held." ... "Where it is found that a party was erroneously
denied the right to a hearing on their motion to recuse, the remedy is to
abate the case back to the trial court so that such hearing can be [held]." ...
"If the motion to recuse is denied, the standard for review is abuse of
discretion, and the denial may be reviewed on appeal from the final
judgment. Tex.R.Civ.P. 18a(f).
Summary
The passages establish: (1) Texas law distinguishes constitutional
disqualification from statutory recusal; (2) recusal standards are governed
by Tex. R. Civ. P. 18b; (3) a timely, facially sufficient recusal motion triggers
a mandatory process—either self-recusal or referral to the regional
presiding judge to assign a different judge to hear the motion; (4) a hearing
is required on a timely, facially sufficient recusal motion; (5) erroneous
denial of a recusal hearing warrants abatement; and (6) denials are
reviewed for abuse of discretion on appeal. The passages do not address
appointment effective dates, visiting judge qualifications, or specialization
mismatches, nor do they substantiate “fraud.” They do, however, directly
address the impropriety of summarily denying a facially sufficient recusal
motion and the proper remedy.
