Question
The respondent alleges that the petitioner and her attorney engaged in
fraudulent conduct, misrepresentations, and manipulation of the judicial
process, resulting in orders based on falsehoods and without jurisdiction.
The respondent was denied a fair hearing and meaningful participation in
the proceedings. The bad faith/harassment exception to Younger abstention
applies where the state proceeding is brought in bad faith or to harass the
federal plaintiff (Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37 (1971); Kugler v. Helfant,
421 U.S. 117 (1975)). If the facts support a finding that the state
proceedings were initiated and maintained in bad faith, with fraudulent
conduct and intentional deprivation of rights, the bad faith exception to
Younger abstention applies, allowing federal court intervention.
Answer (Texas)
Short response
Federal courts may intervene in ongoing state proceedings under the bad
faith or harassment exception to abstention if the state action was initiated
and maintained in bad faith, such as through fraudulent conduct,
misrepresentations, or intentional deprivation of rights. The provided
authorities confirm that when such conduct is established, the exception to
abstention applies, permitting federal court intervention.
Summary
The bad faith/harassment exception to abstention doctrine allows federal
courts to intervene in state proceedings when those proceedings are
conducted in bad faith, for purposes of harassment, or involve fraudulent
conduct that deprives a party of constitutional rights. The authorities
provided, including case law and secondary materials, consistently
recognize that federal intervention is justified where state court actions are
not merely erroneous but are fundamentally unfair due to intentional
misconduct or abuse of process.
In Texas, both statutory and case law support the imposition of sanctions for
bad faith litigation conduct, and these principles align with federal
abstention doctrine exceptions. If a respondent can demonstrate that a state
proceeding was tainted by fraud, misrepresentation, or manipulation
resulting in a denial of a fair hearing, federal courts are not required to
abstain and may grant relief to protect constitutional rights.

Background and Relevant Law
Legislative and Regulatory Framework
Texas law provides explicit authority for judges to sanction parties or their
representatives for filing motions or pleadings in bad faith, for harassment,
or for other improper purposes. Under the Texas Administrative Code,
judges presiding over contested cases (excluding certain agencies) may
impose sanctions if a party or representative files groundless motions or
pleadings in bad faith, for harassment, or to cause unnecessary delay or
cost. Sanctions may be imposed after notice and an opportunity for a
hearing, ensuring due process in the imposition of such penalties, as set out
in 1 Tex. Admin. Code § 155.157 (2025) (supplementary).
This regulatory framework reflects a broader legal principle: the judicial
process must not be abused through bad faith conduct, and courts have both
the authority and the responsibility to address such abuses. The Texas Civil
Practice and Remedies Code and Texas Rules of Civil Procedure also require
good faith in pleadings and authorize sanctions for groundless or bad faith
filings, as referenced in the case law below.
Case Law
The Texas Court of Appeals in In re Guardianship of Thrash, No.
04-19-00555-CV (Tex. App. Mar 31, 2021) addressed a scenario where
parties engaged in false representations and a lack of candor, leading to
findings of bad faith abuse of the judicial process. The court upheld
sanctions where pleadings were found to be groundless and filed in bad
faith, referencing both statutory and rule-based requirements for good faith
and candor in litigation. This case demonstrates that Texas courts recognize
and remedy fraudulent or bad faith conduct that undermines the integrity of
judicial proceedings.
Secondary Materials
Secondary sources further clarify the federal abstention doctrine and its
exceptions. One article explains that federal courts generally abstain from
interfering in state proceedings but identifies three exceptions: (1) bad faith
prosecution, (2) patently unconstitutional statutes, and (3) other unusual
circumstances warranting equitable relief. The bad faith exception is rooted
in the need to protect constitutional rights where state courts may fail to do
so, especially when irreparable harm is at stake (ABSTAINING FROM
ABSTENTION: WHY YOUNGER ABSTENTION DOES NOT APPLY IN 42
U.S.C [section] 1983 BAIL LITIGATION (2023)).
Another secondary source emphasizes that federal courts should not defer
to state proceedings when the prosecution is a result of bad faith or
harassment, as this itself constitutes irreparable harm. Requiring a litigant
to seek redress in a bad faith proceeding would only subject them to further
harm, justifying federal intervention (ABSTAINING EQUITABLY (2022)).

Analysis
The question presented involves allegations that a petitioner and her
attorney engaged in fraudulent conduct, misrepresentations, and
manipulation of the judicial process, resulting in orders based on falsehoods
and a denial of fair hearing and meaningful participation. The respondent
asserts that these actions trigger the bad faith/harassment exception to
abstention, permitting federal court intervention.
The authorities provided support this position. Texas law, as reflected in
both statutory and case law, recognizes that courts have the authority to
sanction parties for bad faith conduct, including the filing of groundless or
fraudulent pleadings. In In re Guardianship of Thrash, the court found that
false statements and lack of candor constituted a bad faith abuse of the
judicial process, warranting sanctions. This demonstrates that Texas courts
are equipped to address and remedy such conduct, but it also underscores
the seriousness of bad faith litigation and its impact on the fairness of
proceedings.
At the federal level, the abstention doctrine generally requires federal
courts to refrain from interfering in ongoing state proceedings. However,
the doctrine is not absolute. The bad faith/harassment exception, as
articulated in the secondary materials, allows federal courts to intervene
when state proceedings are initiated or maintained in bad faith, for purposes
of harassment, or under other extraordinary circumstances. This exception
is grounded in the principle that federal courts must be able to protect
constitutional rights when state courts fail to do so, particularly where
irreparable harm is present.
The secondary sources provided make clear that bad faith prosecution or
harassment is itself a form of irreparable harm that justifies federal
intervention. If a respondent can demonstrate that the state proceeding was
tainted by fraudulent conduct, misrepresentations, or intentional deprivation
of rights, the bad faith exception to abstention applies. This is consistent
with the approach taken by Texas courts, which recognize and sanction bad
faith conduct that undermines the integrity of the judicial process.
In practical terms, a respondent seeking to invoke the bad faith/harassment
exception must present evidence that the state proceeding was not merely
erroneous or unfair, but was initiated or maintained for improper purposes,
such as to harass, intimidate, or deprive the respondent of constitutional
rights. The presence of fraudulent conduct, misrepresentations, or
manipulation of the judicial process would be highly relevant to this inquiry.
If such conduct is established, federal courts are not required to abstain and
may grant relief to protect the respondent's rights.
Exceptions and Caveats
While the bad faith/harassment exception to abstention is well-established, it
is narrowly construed. Not every error or unfairness in state proceedings
will justify federal intervention. The respondent must demonstrate that the
state action was initiated or maintained in bad faith, for purposes of

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
harassment, or under other extraordinary circumstances. Mere allegations
of unfairness or error are insufficient; there must be evidence of intentional
misconduct or abuse of process.
Additionally, the availability of sanctions and remedies in state court may
affect the analysis. If the state court has the authority and willingness to
address and remedy bad faith conduct, federal courts may be more reluctant
to intervene. However, where the state process itself is fundamentally unfair
or incapable of providing an adequate remedy, federal intervention may be
warranted.
It is also important to note that the authorities provided do not address
every possible nuance of the abstention doctrine or its exceptions. The
analysis here is based solely on the materials provided, and other authorities
or subsequent developments may affect the application of these principles in
specific cases.
Conclusion
In summary, the bad faith/harassment exception to abstention permits
federal court intervention in state proceedings that are initiated or
maintained in bad faith, for purposes of harassment, or involve fraudulent
conduct and intentional deprivation of rights. Texas law recognizes and
sanctions such conduct, and federal doctrine provides an exception to
abstention in these circumstances. If the respondent can establish that the
state proceeding was tainted by fraud, misrepresentation, or manipulation
resulting in a denial of a fair hearing, the exception applies and federal
court intervention is justified. The key is the presence of intentional
misconduct or abuse of process, not merely error or unfairness.
Legal Authorities
In re Guardianship of Thrash, No. 04-19-00555-CV (Tex. App. Mar 31, 2021)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The probate court reviewed the adoption pleadings containing the false
representation that Thrash was not under a court-ordered relationship and
heard testimony about the adoption proceedings before making its findings
that appellants made false statements, exhibited a lack of candor, and
engaged in a bad faith abuse of the judicial process warranting sanctions for
the adoption scheme. ... Paragraphs 19-25 set forth the probate court's
findings that the Second Recusal Motion was groundless and filed in bad
faith in violation of § 10.001 and Rule 13. TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE
ANN. § 10.001 (good faith pleading requirements); TEX. R. CIV. P. 13
(authorizing sanctions based on groundless pleadings brought in bad faith or
for the purpose of harassment, and for knowingly groundless or false
statements).

Summary
The passage describes a situation where the probate court found that false
statements and a lack of candor were made, constituting a bad faith abuse
of the judicial process. This aligns with the proposition that fraudulent
conduct and misrepresentations can lead to orders based on falsehoods, and
that such conduct can be grounds for sanctions. The passage also references
Texas legal provisions that address bad faith pleadings and harassment,
which supports the argument that such conduct can justify federal court
intervention under the bad faith/harassment exception to Younger
abstention.
1 Tex. Admin. Code § 155.157 1 Tex. Admin. Code § 155.157 Sanctioning
Authority
Extract
For contested cases referred by an agency other than the PUC or the TCEQ,
the judge has the authority to impose appropriate sanctions against a party
or its representative for: filing a motion or pleading that is deemed by the
judge to be groundless and brought: (A) in bad faith; (B) for the purpose of
harassment; or (C) for any other improper purpose, such as to cause
unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of the proceeding; ... The
judge may issue an order imposing sanctions when justified by party or
representative behavior described in subsection (a) of this section and after
notice and opportunity for hearing.
Summary
The Texas Administrative Code provides judges with the authority to impose
sanctions on parties or their representatives for filing motions or pleadings
in bad faith, for harassment, or for other improper purposes. This aligns
with the proposition that if state proceedings are initiated and maintained in
bad faith, it could justify federal court intervention under the bad faith/
harassment exception to Younger abstention.

Extract
The Younger court went on to outline three exceptions for when a federal
court must act to enjoin a state court proceeding: when (1) the prosecution
is acting in bad faith, (2) the statute is 'patently unconstitutional,' or (3) 'any
other unusual circumstances that would call for equitable relief' exist. These

exceptions stem from Ex parte Young, which held that a defendant about to
be prosecuted in a state court can enjoin the proceedings if he can show
that he otherwise would suffer irreparable harm. This is because federal
courts must be able to protect constitutional rights where state courts may
fail to do so, but also should not needlessly interfere with legitimate
activities of state courts.
Summary
Exceptions to the Younger abstention doctrine, specifically highlighting that
federal courts can intervene in state court proceedings if the prosecution is
acting in bad faith. This directly supports the proposition that if the state
proceedings were initiated and maintained in bad faith, with fraudulent
conduct and intentional deprivation of rights, the bad faith exception to
Younger abstention applies, allowing federal court intervention.

Smith, Fred O., Jr. - 2022-05-01
Extract
Beyond the general unavailability of Younger abstention when there is no
adequate opportunity to raise constitutional claims, the Supreme Court has
identified some concrete settings in which federal courts should not defer to
the underlying state process to abate irreparable harm. First, federal courts
should not defer to a state proceeding when the prosecution is a result of
bad faith or harassment. The bad faith prosecution is, after all, a part of the
irreparable harm that the litigant is trying to redress. To ask a criminal
defendant to seek redress in the bad faith prosecution is to ask the criminal
defendant to subject herself to more of that harm.
Summary
The Supreme Court has recognized exceptions to the Younger abstention
doctrine, particularly in cases where state proceedings are conducted in bad
faith or for harassment purposes. This aligns with the proposition that if
state proceedings are initiated and maintained in bad faith, federal court
intervention is justified. The passage directly supports the idea that bad
faith prosecution constitutes irreparable harm, which federal courts can
address without deferring to state processes.
