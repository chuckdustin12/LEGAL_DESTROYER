Question
STATE COMMISSION ON JUDICIAL CONDUCT HON. KENNETH NEWELL,
DISTRICT JUDGE OF THE 233rd DISTRICT COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY,
TEXAS. § § § § §JUDICIAL COMPLAINT § § § § § TO THE STATE
COMMISSION ON JUDICIAL CONDUCT: This complaint is filed against the
Honorable Kenneth Newell of the 233rd District Court of Tarrant County,
Texas, and is filed concurrently with four additional complaints against the
Honorables James Munford, Jeffrey Kaitcer, Kate Stone, and David L. Evans.
These complaints are filed after five mandamus petitions were submitted
and denied in the Texas Appellate Courts which received no opinion from the
judicial body and no response from the collective judges named above. This
complaint focuses on the conduct committed by the Honorable Kenneth
Newell, which is explained in greater detail below. Together, these five
complaints highlight a total breakdown of judicial integrity which
undermines the public confidence in the Texas Judiciary. 1 I.Summary
1.Judge Kenneth Newell’s conduct—granting a contested
consolidationmotion sua sponte, without notice or hearing, in violation of
mandatory local rules and after his associate judge Kate Stone denied the
Complainant access to the courts—constitutes a willful and egregious
violation of multiple judicial canons and due process, warranting
investigation by the Texas Commission on Judicial Conduct. This pattern of
disregard for procedural fairness and impartiality undermines public
confidence in the judiciary and falls within the grounds for disciplinary
action under Texas law. 2.This is especially troubling because the actions
taken by Judge Newelloccurred directly after Honorable Kate Stone refused
to hear a properly filed motion in the same court, creating a pattern of
judicial abuse. 3.Such conduct, especially when part of a pattern that
includes repeated failures to provide hearings and to address timely
objections, falls within the grounds for investigation and potential discipline
by the Commission on Judicial Conduct under the Texas Constitution and
Government Code. The Commission is empowered to investigate judges for
willful or persistent violations of rules, incompetence, or conduct that
undermines the judiciary, and the facts here strongly support the need for
such an investigation to protect the integrity of the Texas judicial system. 2
II.Analysis A.Willful Violation of Clear Legal Mandates 4.Judge Newell’s
conduct in granting a contested consolidation motion suasponte, without
notice or hearing, and in direct violation of Tarrant County Local Rule
4.01(8)(a), constitutes a willful violation of multiple judicial canons and due
process. Canon 1 requires judges to uphold the integrity and independence
of the judiciary, while Canon 2A mandates that judges act in a manner that
promotes public confidence in the judiciary’s integrity and impartiality
(Sears v. Nueces County Sherriff Olivarez, 28 S.W.3d 611 (Tex. App. 2000)).
By disregarding mandatory local rules and depriving the Complainant of
notice and a hearing, Judge Newell failed to comply with these canons.
5.Canon 3B(2) requires judges to be faithful to the law and
maintainprofessional competence. The Texas Supreme Court has made clear
that trial courts are required to follow local rules, and a judge has no
discretion to ignore or misapply such rules (In re Rose, 144 S.W.3d 661 (Tex.
2004)). The failure to provide notice and an opportunity to be heard on a

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
contested, potentially case-dispositive motion is a fundamental violation of
due process (In re D.D., 661 S.W.3d 608 (Tex. App. 2023)). The appellate
court in D.D. found that the lack of notice to a party violated due process
and voided the resulting orders, directing the trial court to vacate them.
This precedent is directly applicable: Judge Newell’s 3 actions deprived the
Complainant of due process and resulted in an order that is voidable for lack
of notice and hearing. 6. Canon 3B(5) requires judges to perform their
duties without bias or prejudice. The context here is especially egregious:
the associate judge had just denied the Complainant access to the courts on
an emergency motion, favoring the opposing counsel who had not
substantively participated in the case, and then Judge Newell granted that
same attorney’s motion without notice or hearing. This sequence of events
creates a strong appearance of partiality and undermines public confidence
in the judiciary (Ludlow v. DeBerry, 959 S.W.2d 265 (Tex. App. 1997)). B.
Pattern of Procedural Irregularities and Systemic Abuse 7. The record
details a pattern of procedural irregularities, including the refusal to hear an
emergency temporary restraining order, the failure to address timely filed
objections, and the issuance of a consolidation order immediately after the
Complainant sought appellate relief. Such a pattern, especially when it
results in the repeated denial of a party’s right to be heard, constitutes
willful or persistent conduct inconsistent with the proper performance of
judicial duties (Tex. Gov't. Code § 33.001; Thoma, In re, 873 S.W.2d 477 (Tex.
1994)). 8. Here, the sequence of events—denial of hearings, disregard of
objections, and issuance of orders in violation of clear rules—suggests more
than mere error; it indicates a persistent disregard for the law and the
rights of litigants. The context 4 of the associate judge’s refusal to hear the
Complainant’s emergency motion, followed by Judge Newell’s sua sponte
grant of the opposing counsel’s motion, further supports the conclusion that
this is not an isolated incident but part of a systemic abuse of judicial
authority. C. Impact on Public Confidence and the Integrity of the Judiciary
9. The Texas Constitution and case law emphasize that judges must conduct
themselves in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and
impartiality of the judiciary (Thoma, In re, 873 S.W.2d 477 (Tex. 1994)).
Conduct that casts public discredit upon the judiciary or the administration
of justice is grounds for investigation and discipline (Tex. Const. art. 5 § 1-a;
In re Canales, 113 S.W.3d 56 (Tex. 2003)). The pattern of procedural
irregularities and disregard for litigants’ rights in this case threatens to
undermine public trust in the courts and the rule of law. D. The
Commission’s Authority and Duty to Investigate 10. The Commission on
Judicial Conduct is empowered to investigate any appearance or allegation
of judicial misconduct that is not unfounded or frivolous (Tex. Gov't. Code §
33.022). If the preliminary investigation finds merit, a full investigation is
required. The Commission’s role is not merely punitive but is intended to
maintain the honor and dignity of the judiciary and to uphold the 5
administration of justice for the benefit of all citizens (In re Canales, 113
S.W.3d 56 (Tex. 2003)). 11. In recent disciplinary proceedings, the Texas
Supreme Court has affirmed the Commission’s authority to issue public
warnings, admonishments, and orders for further education or mentoring
when a judge’s conduct is found unacceptable (In re Inquiry Concerning
Honorable Bonnie Rangel CJC No., 677 S.W.3d 918 (Tex. 2023)). The facts in
the instant matter, which are substantiated by evidence found on the face of
the record, would warrant at least a full investigation and potentially formal

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
disciplinary action. E. Specific Canons Violated and Egregiousness of
Conduct i. Canon 1 - Judge Newell’s actions undermined the integrity and
independence of the judiciary by disregarding mandatory procedures and
due process. ii. Canon 2A - His conduct failed to promote public confidence
in the judiciary’s integrity and impartiality, especially given the appearance
of favoritism toward the opposing counsel. iii. Canon 3B(2) - He failed to be
faithful to the law and maintain professional competence by ignoring clear
local rules and due process requirements. 6 iv. Canon 3B(4) - The pattern of
denying hearings and failing to address objections demonstrates a lack of
patience, dignity, and courtesy toward the litigant. v. Canon 3B(5) - The
sequence of events creates a strong appearance of bias or prejudice,
particularly given the context of the associate judge’s prior actions. vi.
Canon 3B(8) - If any ex parte communications or improper consideration of
the opposing counsel’s position occurred, this would further violate the
prohibition on ex parte communications, a determination that should be part
of the investigation. 12. The egregiousness of Judge Newell’s conduct is
heightened by the context: the associate judge’s refusal to hear the
Complainant’s emergency motion, the lack of substantive participation by
the opposing counsel, and the timing of the consolidation order immediately
after the Complainant sought appellate relief. This pattern of conduct
suggests systemic abuse of judicial authorities and a willful disregard for the
rights of litigants. III. Conclusion 13. Judge Kenneth Newell’s conduct raises
grave concerns about willful and persistent violations of clear legal
mandates, denial of due process, and a pattern of procedural irregularities
that undermine the integrity of the judicial process. Under 7 the Texas
Constitution and Government Code, such conduct is within the grounds for
investigation and potential discipline by the Commission on Judicial
Conduct. 14. The Commission has both the authority and the duty to
investigate these allegations to protect the rights of litigants and to maintain
public confidence in the Texas judiciary. 15. When viewed in totality, the five
complaints before this Body highlight that at every turn – the Texas judiciary
has failed to uphold the most basic laws, has failed to provide any
substantive explanation for violating them, and continues to willfully
disregard their duties as elected officials. 16. By addressing these issues
here, the Commission can prevent further escalation and further acts of
abuse which have statewide importance and directly affect the future of our
State. Respectfully submitted, X_______________________ CHARLES DUSTIN

08/23/2025 *Upon request from the commission, Complainant will provide
all evidence to support the allegations herein. 8 1 STATE COMMISSION ON
JUDICIAL CONDUCT HONORABLE DAVID L. EVANS, REGIONAL
PRESIDING JUDGE, 8TH ADMINISTRATIVE REGION OF TEXAS. § § § § §
JUDICIAL COMPLAINT § § § § § TO THE STATE COMMISSION ON JUDICIAL
CONDUCT: This complaint is filed against the Honorable David L. Evans of
the 8th Administrative Judicial Region in Texas, and is filed concurrently
with four additional complaints against the Honorables Kenneth Newell,
Jeffrey Kaitcer, Kate Stone, and James Munford. These complaints are filed
after five mandamus petitions were submitted and denied in the Texas
Appellate Courts which received no opinion from the judicial body and no
response from the collective judges named above. This complaint focuses on
the conduct committed by the Honorable David L. Evans, which is explained

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
in greater detail below. Together, these five complaints highlight a total
breakdown of judicial integrity which undermines the public confidence in
the Texas Judiciary. 2 I. Summary 1. David L. Evans’s conduct as regional
presiding judge not only failed to correct but actively compounded
procedural violations in the recusal process, creating the appearance of
judicial negligence and undermining public confidence in the judiciary. The
unusually high number of recusals in the 8th region further signals systemic
issues, warranting a formal investigation for violations of Canons 1, 2A, and
3B(2) of the Texas Code of Judicial Conduct.1 2. The actions of Judge Evans,
particularly his approval of a court coordinator’s involvement in the recusal
process and his handling of motions that were never properly filed, directly
contravened mandatory procedural rules and the core principles of judicial
impartiality. As regional presiding judge, Evans was responsible for
upholding the integrity of the recusal process, but instead his decisions
introduced confusion, delay, and the appearance of bias, all of which are
antithetical to the standards set by Texas law and the Code of Judicial
Conduct. 3. The fact that the 8th Administrative Judicial Region, under
Evans’s leadership, has more than double the number of recusals compared
to any other region is a red flag indicating possible systemic dysfunction or a
lack of public trust in the region’s judiciary. These circumstances, combined
with clear procedural violations, trigger the Texas Commission on Judicial
Conduct’s duty to 1 https://www.txcourts.gov/statistics/annual-statistical-
reports/2024/ 3 investigate for potential breaches of Canons 1 (integrity and
independence), 2A (compliance with law and promotion of public
confidence), and 3B(2) (professional competence in the law). 4. When paired
with these five complaints, it’s clear that there are underlying issues
occurring that warrant immediate investigation by this Body. II. Analysis A.
Compounding Procedural Violations and Judicial Negligence 5. As regional
presiding judge, David L. Evans was responsible for ensuring that recusal
procedures were strictly followed in accordance with Rule 18a. Instead, he
overruled objections to the involvement of a court coordinator—an individual
who serves at the pleasure of the judge facing recusal—in the transmission
and management of recusal materials. This is a direct violation of Rule 18a,
which assigns these duties to the court clerk, a neutral officer of the court
(Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a(e)). The rationale is clear: the clerk is independent, while
the coordinator is not, and their involvement creates at least the appearance
of impropriety (In re Alpert, 276 S.W.3d 592 (Tex. App. 2008)). 6. Evans’s
order also permitted the denial of a recusal motion that was never actually
filed. Rule 18a and its interpreting case law make clear that recusal
procedures are only triggered by the filing of a verified motion with the
clerk (Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a(a); In re Johnson, No. 14-04-00519-CV (Tex. 2004)).
If no motion is 4 filed, there is no basis for the judge to act, and certainly no
basis to deny a nonexistent motion. Any such action is not only procedurally
improper but void (In re Norman, 191 S.W.3d 858 (Tex. App. 2006); In re
Gold, 04-25-00085-CV (Tex. App. May 07, 2025)). 7. By failing to correct
these errors and instead overruling objections to them, Evans compounded
the procedural violations. His actions introduced confusion, delay, and the
appearance of bias, all of which are antithetical to the standards set by
Texas law and the Code of Judicial Conduct. The Texas Supreme Court has
made clear that even the appearance of impropriety or partiality is sufficient
to warrant investigation and possible discipline (In re Inquiry Concerning
Honorable Bonnie Rangel CJC No., 677 S.W.3d 918 (Tex. 2023)). B. Systemic

Issues: The 8th Region’s High Recusal Rate 8. The fact that the 8th
Administrative Judicial Region, under Evans’s leadership, has more than
double the number of recusals compared to any other region is a significant
indicator of systemic dysfunction or a lack of public trust in the region’s
judiciary. While the raw number of recusals alone is not proof of misconduct,
such a stark disparity strongly suggests that litigants and attorneys perceive
a problem with impartiality or procedural fairness in the region. This
perception is itself damaging to public confidence and is precisely the type
of issue 5 the Commission on Judicial Conduct is empowered to investigate
(Tex. Const. art. 5 § 1-a). 9. A high recusal rate, especially when coupled
with documented procedural violations, raises the possibility of a broader
pattern of judicial negligence or incompetence. The Commission is
specifically empowered to investigate not only actual misconduct but also
the appearance of misconduct or disability (Tex. Gov't. Code § 33.022).
Failure to investigate such matters would itself undermine public confidence
in the judiciary and the effectiveness of the Commission as a guardian of
judicial integrity. C. Why an Investigation Is Warranted 10. The Texas
Constitution and Government Code require the Commission on Judicial
Conduct to investigate any credible allegation or appearance of judicial
misconduct (Tex. Const. art. 5 § 1-a; Tex. Gov't. Code § 33.022). The
Commission’s mandate is not limited to clear-cut cases of corruption or
malfeasance; it extends to any conduct that undermines the integrity,
impartiality, or proper administration of justice. 11. Here, the involvement of
a court coordinator in the recusal process and the denial of motions that
were never filed are not trivial or technical errors but go to the heart of
judicial impartiality and procedural integrity. The mandatory nature of the
rules involved and the clear case law interpreting them leave little room for
6 discretion in this context. The Commission is therefore obligated to
conduct a preliminary investigation, and if the allegations are not found to
be unfounded or frivolous, to proceed with a full investigation and notify the
judge involved (Tex. Gov't. Code § 33.022). III. Canons Violated 12. The
conduct described implicates several Canons of the Texas Code of Judicial
Conduct: i. Canon 1 - Requires judges to maintain the integrity and
independence of the judiciary. By allowing procedural violations and failing
to correct them, Evans undermined the integrity of the judicial process
(Thoma, In re, 873 S.W.2d 477 (Tex. 1994)). ii. Canon 2A - Requires judges to
comply with the law and act at all times in a manner that promotes public
confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary. Evans’s actions,
particularly in overruling objections to clear procedural violations, failed to
promote public confidence and instead created the appearance of
impropriety (In re Inquiry Concerning Honorable Bonnie Rangel CJC No.,
677 S.W.3d 918 (Tex. 2023); In re K.E.M., 89 S.W.3d 814 (Tex. App. 2002)).
iii. Canon 3B(2) - Requires judges to maintain professional competence in
the law. The failure to follow mandatory procedures for 7 recusal, and to
ensure that only properly filed motions are acted upon, demonstrates a lack
of professional competence in the law (In re Inquiry Concerning Honorable
Bonnie Rangel CJC No., 677 S.W.3d 918 (Tex. 2023)). 13. These violations
are not merely technical; they strike at the core of judicial impartiality and
the rule of law. By continuing to allow these issues to compound and remain
unexplained would undermine the Commission’s fundamental purpose. IV.
Conclusion 14. David L. Evans’s conduct as regional presiding judge,
particularly his approval of a court coordinator’s involvement in the recusal

process and his handling of motions that were never properly filed, directly
contravened mandatory procedural rules and the core principles of judicial
impartiality. The unusually high number of recusals in the 8th region further
signals systemic issues, warranting a formal investigation for violations of
Canons 1, 2A, and 3B(2) of the Texas Code of Judicial Conduct. The Texas
Commission on Judicial Conduct is not only authorized but obligated to
investigate these matters to preserve the integrity of the judiciary and
maintain public trust. Failure to do so would erode public confidence in the
judiciary and the rule of law. 8 15. In totality, these five complaints spell out
a systemic issues that has statewide importance. These five judges are well
aware of the alleged issues, continue to ignore them, and continue to violate
Texas law in the process. If not addressed now, more issues will certainly
arise because there is no checks and balances in our system which
negatively affects the State as a whole. 16. This commission should choose
to act where no other judicial body has, and uphold the Texas laws and
procedures that should be afforded to all litigants. Respectfully submitted,

MOUND, TEXAS 75028 COMPLAINANT DATED: 08/23/2025 *Upon request
from the commission, Complainant will provide all evidence to support the
allegations herein. 1 STATE COMMISSION ON JUDICIAL CONDUCT
HONORABLE KATE STONE, ASSOCIATE JUDGE OF THE 233RD DISTRICT
COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS. § § § § § JUDICIAL COMPLAINT § § §
§ § TO THE STATE COMMISSION ON JUDICIAL CONDUCT: This complaint
is filed against the Honorable Kate Stone of the 233rd District Court of
Tarrant County, Texas, and is filed concurrently with four additional
complaints against the Honorables James Munford, Jeffrey Kaitcer, Kenneth
Newell, and David L. Evans. These complaints are filed after five mandamus
petitions were submitted and denied in the Texas Appellate Courts which
received no opinion from the judicial body and no response from the
collective judges named above. This complaint focuses on the conduct
committed by the Honorable Kate Stone, which is explained in greater detail
below. Together, these five complaints highlight a total breakdown of judicial
integrity which undermines the public confidence in the Texas Judiciary. 2 I.
Summary 1. On March 28, 2025, Judge Kate Stone refused to hear or rule
upon a properly filed emergency Temporary Restraining Order (TRO)
properly before her. Rather than hearing the issues, she prevented the
Complainant from presenting his motion and turned him away from the
courtroom without a ruling, which lead to a direct and preventable injury to
a child. 2. Judge Kate Stone’s refusal to hear or rule on a properly filed
emergency Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) involving imminent risk to a
child constitutes a failure to perform a ministerial judicial duty under Texas
law. This conduct implicates violations of Canons 2A (compliance with law
and promotion of public confidence), 3B(2) (maintenance of professional
competence), and 3B(8) (prompt, efficient, and fair disposition of judicial
matters) of the Texas Code of Judicial Conduct, as well as related
constitutional and statutory mandates. 3. The Texas Commission on Judicial
Conduct has a mandate to investigate not only individual acts of misconduct
but also patterns of behavior that may indicate systemic issues affecting the
integrity of the judiciary. See Tex. Gov’t Code § 33.001 et seq. The
Commission should investigate Judge Stone’s conduct as part of its
responsibility to uphold the integrity of the Texas judiciary. II. Analysis A.

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Ministerial Duty to Hear and Rule on Emergency Motions 3 4. The facts
alleged in the complaint—specifically, that Judge Stone refused to hear or
rule on a properly filed emergency TRO—constitute a failure to perform a
ministerial judicial duty. Texas law is clear that when a motion is properly
filed and pending, the judge must consider and rule upon it within a
reasonable time (In re Layton, 257 S.W.3d 794, 795 (Tex. App. 2008); Barnes
v. State, 832 S.W.2d 424, 426 (Tex. App. 1992)). This is not a matter of
judicial discretion; the court has no discretion to refuse to act. 5. By refusing
to hear or rule on the emergency TRO, Judge Stone failed to comply with the
law, in direct violation of Canon 2A (In re Canales, 113 S.W.3d 56 (Tex.
2003); In re Ginsberg, 630 S.W.3d 1 (Tex. 2018)). This conduct also
demonstrates a lack of professional competence and diligence, violating
Canon 3B(2) (In re Jones, 55 S.W.3d 243 (Tex. Spec. Ct. Rev. 2000); In re
Bailey, 692 S.W.3d 900 (Tex. Spec. Ct. Rev. 2022)). Furthermore, the failure
to dispose of the matter promptly, efficiently, and fairly is a violation of
Canon 3B(8) (Safety-Kleen Corp. v. Garcia, 945 S.W.2d 268 (Tex. App.
1997)).B. Constitutional and Due Process Violations 6. The Texas
Constitution and Government Code reinforce these canons by providing that
willful or persistent conduct inconsistent with judicial duties, or conduct
that casts public discredit upon the judiciary, is grounds for discipline or
removal (Tex. Const. art. V, § 1-a(6)(A); Tex. Gov't. Code § 33.001). The
refusal to 4 act on an emergency motion affecting child safety, resulting in
actual harm, is precisely the type of conduct these provisions are intended
to address. 7. Furthermore, the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment and Texas law require that parties be afforded a meaningful
opportunity to be heard, especially when fundamental rights such as
parenting are at stake. The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the
fundamental liberty interest of parents in the care, custody, and control of
their children (Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 65 (2000)). 8. Texas law
echoes this protection, mandating that the best interest of the child is the
primary consideration in custody matters (Tex. Fam. Code § 153.002). Judge
Stone’s refusal to hear the emergency TRO deprived the Complainant of due
process and the opportunity to protect his child’s welfare. C. Resulting Harm
and Public Confidence 9. The court’s inaction directly resulted in a
preventable injury to the child, as the emergency alleged in the TRO
materialized after the judge’s refusal to act. This is not a hypothetical or
technical violation; it is a dereliction of duty with real and serious
consequences. The Texas Family Code, constitutional provisions, and
appellate case law all emphasize the importance of judicial responsiveness
in matters affecting child safety and fundamental rights. 5 10. Judges are
required to act impartially and diligently, and to avoid conduct that
undermines public confidence in the judiciary. The Texas Commission on
Judicial Conduct is empowered to investigate willful or persistent conduct
that is clearly inconsistent with the proper performance of judicial duties or
that casts public discredit upon the judiciary (In re Curnutt, 692 S.W.3d 917,
920 (Tex. Spec. Ct. Rev. 2024)). Judge Stone’s willful refusal to perform a
ministerial duty, resulting in actual harm to a child and undermining public
trust, constitutes grounds for investigation and potential disciplinary action.
D. Systemic Issues and the Mandate of the Texas Commission on Judicial
Conduct 11. The incident described is not isolated but is part of a broader
pattern of judicial inaction and unexplained denials in Texas family courts,
as documented by advocacy groups and recent appellate cases. The Texas

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Commission on Judicial Conduct has a mandate to investigate not only
individual acts of misconduct but also patterns of behavior that may indicate
systemic issues affecting the integrity of the judiciary (Tex. Gov’t Code §
33.001 et seq.). The Commission’s role is to uphold the integrity and
accountability of the Texas judiciary, and the facts here—especially the
direct injury to a child and the erosion of public trust—warrant such
scrutiny. 6 III. Conclusion 12. Judge Kate Stone’s refusal to hear or rule on a
properly filed emergency TRO alleging imminent risk to a child was a clear
violation of her ministerial duty under Texas law. This inaction denied the
Complainant access to the courts and due process, directly resulting in
preventable harm to a child and undermining public confidence in the
judiciary. The Texas Commission on Judicial Conduct is not only authorized
but obligated to investigate such willful or persistent conduct, both to
address the individual incident and to examine potential systemic issues
within the judiciary. The facts, law, and evidence strongly support the
conclusion that an investigation is warranted to uphold the rule of law and
the integrity of the Texas judicial system. 13. Perhaps most disturbing is that
after the clear refusal to perform a ministerial act affecting the health and
safety of a child, Judge Stone provided no response in the mandamus
proceedings that followed, offered no explanation for her inaction, and
perhaps most troubling of all – the appellate courts refused to intervene on
such a clear abuse of discretion. 14. When combined with the other four
complaints before this body and the rapid decline in public confidence in the
judiciary – this Commission must uphold its’ purpose and investigate these
issues to protect our children and the future of Texas. Not doing so would
compound the growing issues that remain unexplained. 7 Respectfully

FLOWER MOUND, TEXAS 75028 COMPLAINANT DATED: 08/23/2025
*Upon request from the commission, Complainant will provide all evidence
to support the allegations herein. 1 STATE COMMISSION ON JUDICIAL
CONDUCT HONORABLE JAMES MUNFORD, DISTRICT JUDGE OF THE
322nd DISTRICT COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS. § § § § § JUDICIAL
COMPLAINT § § § § § TO THE STATE COMMISSION ON JUDICIAL
CONDUCT: This complaint is filed against the Honorable James Munford of
the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County, Texas, and is filed concurrently
with four additional complaints against the Honorables Kenneth Newell,
Jeffrey Kaitcer, Kate Stone, and David L. Evans. These complaints are filed
after five mandamus petitions were submitted and denied in the Texas
Appellate Courts which received no opinion from the judicial body and no
response from the collective judges named above. This complaint focuses on
the conduct committed by the Honorable James Munford, which is explained
in greater detail below. Together, these five complaints highlight a total
breakdown of judicial integrity which undermines the public confidence in
the Texas Judiciary. 2 I. Summary 1. Judge James B. Munford’s conduct in
permitting his court coordinator to modify and participate in recusal
proceedings, along with a pattern of disregarding due process and statutory
requirements in property and custody matters, constitutes serious and
credible allegations of judicial misconduct under Texas law. The State
Commission on Judicial Conduct (SCJC) is both empowered and obligated to
initiate a full investigation into these actions to safeguard the integrity of
the judiciary and public confidence in the Texas courts. 2. Judge James B.

=== PAGE 9 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Munford’s alleged conduct violates multiple canons of the Texas Code of
Judicial Conduct, including those requiring compliance with the law,
maintenance of professional competence, and the promotion of public
confidence in judicial integrity. These violations, especially when part of a
pattern, warrant a full investigation by the State Commission on Judicial
Conduct to protect the integrity of the judiciary and uphold public trust. 3.
The canons most clearly implicated are Canon 1 (upholding judicial
integrity), Canon 2A (compliance with the law and promotion of public
confidence), and Canon 3B(2) (maintenance of professional competence).
The cumulative nature and gravity of these alleged violations go beyond
mere legal error, justifying a thorough investigation by the State
Commission on Judicial Conduct to ensure accountability and maintain the
rule of law. 3 II. Analysis A. Canon 1: Upholding Judicial Integrity and
Independence 4. Canon 1 of the Texas Code of Judicial Conduct requires
judges to establish, maintain, and enforce high standards of conduct to
preserve the integrity and independence of the judiciary. Judges must
personally observe these standards at all times (Thoma, In re, 873 S.W.2d
477 (Tex. 1994); Code of Judicial Conduct). By permitting unauthorized staff
involvement in recusal proceedings and disregarding statutory requirements
in property and custody matters, Judge Munford’s alleged conduct
undermines the integrity and independence of the judiciary, violating this
foundational canon. 5. Permitting a court coordinator to modify or handle
recusal documents is not a mere technical error; it is a breach of
fundamental procedural safeguards designed to ensure fairness and
impartiality. Such conduct undermines the appearance of judicial neutrality
and can erode public confidence in the judiciary. The Texas Supreme Court
has made clear that the appearance of impropriety can be as damaging as
actual misconduct (Sears v. Nueces County Sherriff Olivarez, 28 S.W.3d 611
(Tex. App. 2000)). B. Canon 2A: Compliance with the Law and Promotion of
Public Confidence 6. Canon 2A requires judges to comply with the law and
to act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the
integrity and impartiality of the 4 judiciary (In re Inquiry Concerning
Honorable Bonnie Rangel CJC No., 677 S.W.3d 918 (Tex. 2023); In Re James
Barr, 13 S.W.3d 525 (Tex. 1998); In re Ginsberg, 630 S.W.3d 1 (Tex. 2018)).
Allowing a court coordinator to modify or participate in recusal proceedings
is a direct violation of procedural rules, as only the judge named in the
motion may refer the matter to the presiding judge (In re Inquiry
Concerning Honorable Bonnie Rangel CJC No., 677 S.W.3d 918 (Tex. 2023)).
The Texas Supreme Court has held that even a single instance of such
procedural impropriety can constitute a violation of Canon 2A, as it reflects
a failure to comply with the law and undermines public confidence in the
judiciary. C. Canon 3B(2): Maintenance of Professional Competence 7.
Canon 3B(2) requires judges to be faithful to the law and to maintain
professional competence in it (Hagstette v. State Comm'n on Judicial
Conduct, NO. 01-19-00208-CV (Tex. App. Dec 15, 2020); In re Inquiry
Concerning Honorable Bonnie Rangel CJC No., 677 S.W.3d 918 (Tex. 2023)).
Judge Munford’s pattern of disregarding due process and statutory
requirements in property and custody matters, as well as permitting
unauthorized staff involvement in recusal proceedings, demonstrates a lack
of professional competence and faithfulness to the law. D. Canon 2B:
Avoiding Impropriety and the Appearance of Impropriety 5 8. Canon 2B
prohibits judges from lending the prestige of judicial office to advance the

=== PAGE 10 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
private interests of others or permitting others to convey the impression that
they are in a special position to influence the judge (In Re Lowery, 999 S.W.
2d 639 (Tex. 1998)). Allowing a court coordinator to participate in recusal
proceedings could create the appearance that staff have undue influence
over judicial decisions, further eroding public confidence. E. Canon 3A(5):
Prohibition on Ex Parte Communications 9. Canon 3A(5) prohibits judges
from initiating, permitting, or considering ex parte or other private
communications concerning the merits of a pending or impending judicial
proceeding, except as authorized by law (Thoma, In re, 873 S.W.2d 477 (Tex.
1994)). If the court coordinator’s involvement in recusal proceedings
included substantive communications outside the presence of the parties,
this could also implicate Canon 3A(5). This is an area which should be
investigated by this Commission. III. Why These Violations Warrant
Investigation 10. The Texas Constitution and Government Code require the
SCJC to investigate credible allegations of judicial misconduct, including
willful or persistent violations of the law, incompetence, and conduct that
discredits the judiciary (Tex. Const. art. 5 § 1-a; Tex. Gov't. Code § 33.022).
The SCJC’s role is not to function as an appellate court, but to ensure that
judges adhere to the highest 6 standards of conduct and that the public’s
trust in the judiciary is maintained (In re Rose, 144 S.W.3d 661 (Tex. 2004)).
11. The Texas Supreme Court and Court of Appeals have repeatedly
emphasized that the appearance of impropriety can be as damaging as
actual misconduct (Sears v. Nueces County Sherriff Olivarez, 28 S.W.3d 611
(Tex. App. 2000); In Re James Barr, 13 S.W.3d 525 (Tex. 1998)). Judges must
act in ways that promote public confidence in the integrity and impartiality
of the judiciary. Allowing unauthorized staff involvement in judicial
proceedings, especially recusal matters, undermines this confidence and
creates the perception of bias or undue influence. 12. Finally, rather than
upholding Texas law, the judge named herein continually chooses to avoid
the pressing issues, violate Texas law, and as a result is undermining the
public confidence in the judiciary. An investigation is warranted to require
an explanation rather than continued silence that will only result in further
issues damaging to the image of the Texas Judiciary. 13. The Texas Supreme
Court has recognized that a pattern of conduct inconsistent with judicial
duties, especially when it undermines public confidence in the judiciary,
warrants investigation and possible discipline (In re Canales, 113 S.W.3d 56
(Tex. 2003); In re Rose, 144 S.W.3d 661 (Tex. 2004)). The cumulative effect
of unauthorized staff involvement, disregard for due process, and entry of 7
orders without proper authority goes beyond isolated error and suggests
willful or persistent misconduct, especially when paired with the four
concurrent complaints before this Body. IV. Conclusion 14. Judge James B.
Munford’s conduct implicates several core canons of the Texas Code of
Judicial Conduct, including those requiring compliance with the law,
maintenance of professional competence, and the promotion of public
confidence in the judiciary. The cumulative and serious nature of these
violations—especially unauthorized staff involvement in recusal proceedings
and disregard for due process in property and custody matters—warrants a
full investigation by the State Commission on Judicial Conduct. Such an
investigation is essential to uphold the integrity of the judiciary, maintain
public trust, and ensure that judicial authority is exercised within the
bounds of due process and established legal standards. 15. When viewed in
totality, the five complaints before this Body highlight that at every turn –

the Texas judiciary has failed to uphold the most basic laws, has failed to
provide any substantive explanation for violating them, and continues to
willfully disregard their duties as elected officials. Respectfully submitted, 8

from the commission, Complainant will provide all evidence to support the
allegations herein. 1 STATE COMMISSION ON JUDICIAL CONDUCT
HONORABLE JEFF KAITCER, ASSOCIATE JUDGE OF THE 322nd DISTRICT
COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS. § § § § § JUDICIAL COMPLAINT § § §
§ § TO THE STATE COMMISSION ON JUDICIAL CONDUCT: This complaint
is filed against the Honorable Jeffrey Kaitcer of the 233rd District Court of
Tarrant County, Texas, and is filed concurrently with four additional
complaints against the Honorables James Munford, Jeffrey Kaitcer, Kenneth
Newell, and David L. Evans. These complaints are filed after five mandamus
petitions were submitted and denied in the Texas Appellate Courts which
received no opinion from the judicial body and no response from the
collective judges named above. This complaint focuses on the conduct
committed by the Honorable Jeffrey Kaitcer, which is explained in greater
detail below. Together, these five complaints highlight a total breakdown of
judicial integrity which undermines the public confidence in the Texas
Judiciary. 2 I. Summary 1. A judge who knowingly signs an order falsely
reciting party agreement—especially after compelling a litigant to sign
against their will—violates multiple canons of the Texas Code of Judicial
Conduct, including the duties to comply with the law, act with integrity, and
maintain public confidence in judicial impartiality. Such conduct constitutes
willful or persistent misconduct under Texas law and gravely undermines
public trust in the judiciary. 2. The Texas Code of Judicial Conduct and
related statutes require judges to act lawfully, honestly, and in a manner that
upholds the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary. When a judge
knowingly signs an order that is not true—such as falsely stating that all
parties have agreed when one party has expressly withdrawn consent and
was compelled to sign—the judge breaches these ethical and legal duties,
potentially subjecting themselves to investigation and discipline by the State
Commission on Judicial Conduct. 3. This type of misconduct is not a mere
technical error but a willful violation of both statutory authority and ethical
canons, as it misrepresents the judicial process and deprives parties of their
procedural rights. The public’s confidence in the judiciary depends on the
perception and reality of fairness, honesty, and adherence to the law; when a
judge acts otherwise, it casts discredit on the entire judicial system and
erodes the legitimacy of court orders. 3 II. Analysis A. Statutory and
Canonical Violations 4. Section 201.007 of the Texas Family Code is explicit:
an associate judge may only render and sign a final order if all parties have
agreed in writing, if a party is in default, or if a party has filed an unrevoked
waiver of notice or appearance, or if the parties have waived the right to a
de novo hearing in writing before the hearing begins. Otherwise, the
associate judge’s role is limited to making recommendations to the referring
court, which must then adopt the order for it to become effective (Tex. Fam.
Code § 201.007). 5. By knowingly signing an order that is not true—
specifically, one that recites party agreement when the judge knows a party
does not agree and was compelled to sign—the judge violates several
canons: i. Canon 2A - The judge fails to comply with the law and does not act

=== PAGE 12 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality
of the judiciary (Hensley v. St. Comm'n on Jud. Conduct, 692 S.W.3d 184
(Tex. 2024); In re Canales, 113 S.W.3d 56 (Tex. 2003); In re K.E.M., 89 S.W.
3d 814 (Tex. App. 2002)). ii. Canon 3B(2) - The judge is not faithful to the
law and is not maintaining professional competence, as the judge is 4
disregarding clear statutory requirements (Hagstette v. State Comm'n on
Judicial Conduct, NO. 01-19-00208-CV (Tex. App. Dec 15, 2020)). iii. The
judge’s conduct creates the appearance of impropriety and partiality, as it
suggests favoritism or disregard for the rights of one party (Sears v. Nueces
County Sherriff Olivarez, 28 S.W.3d 611 (Tex. App. 2000)). 6. The Texas
Supreme Court has repeatedly held that willful or persistent violations of the
Code of Judicial Conduct, or conduct that casts public discredit upon the
judiciary, are grounds for discipline or removal (In re Canales, 113 S.W.3d 56
(Tex. 2003); In Re James Barr, 13 S.W.3d 525 (Tex. 1998); Thoma, In re, 873
S.W.2d 477 (Tex. 1994)). 7. Yet here, even with multiple mandamus petitions
highlighting clear abuses of discretion, no response from the judge, and no
input from opposing counsel – these issues continue to be willfully ignored
by the judicial bodies put in place to uphold Texas law when others fail to do
so. B. Implications for Public Confidence 8. The legitimacy of the judiciary
depends on both the reality and the perception of fairness, honesty, and
adherence to the law. When a judge knowingly signs an order that is not
true, it undermines the public’s trust in the judicial 5 process and the
integrity of court orders. The Texas Code of Judicial Conduct and the courts
have repeatedly emphasized that judges must not only be impartial but must
appear impartial, as any conduct that raises doubts about a judge’s fairness
or integrity can undermine public confidence and the legitimacy of the
judicial system (Sears v. Nueces County Sherriff Olivarez, 28 S.W.3d 611
(Tex. App. 2000); In re K.E.M., 89 S.W.3d 814 (Tex. App. 2002)). C. The Role
of the State Commission on Judicial Conduct 9. The State Commission on
Judicial Conduct is empowered to investigate allegations of judicial
misconduct, including willful or persistent violations of law, incompetence,
or conduct that undermines the judiciary (Tex. Gov't. Code § 33.022). The
Commission’s mandate includes investigating conduct that is inconsistent
with the proper performance of judicial duties, including failure to comply
with statutory requirements, failure to execute court business in a timely
manner, and actions that cast public discredit on the judiciary (In re
Uzomba, 683 S.W.3d 358 (Tex. 2024); In re Ginsberg, 630 S.W.3d 1 (Tex.
2018); In re Rose, 144 S.W.3d 661 (Tex. 2004)). 10. Here, willful or
persistent violation of statutory requirements under the Texas Family Code,
incompetence in performing judicial duties by failing to follow required
procedures, and conduct that undermines public confidence in the judiciary
by depriving a party of statutory rights and due process have occurred. 6 11.
Such conduct falls squarely within the grounds for investigation and
potential discipline by the State Commission on Judicial Conduct (Tex.
Const. art. 5 § 1-a; Tex. Gov't. Code § 33.001; In re Uzomba, 683 S.W.3d 358
(Tex. 2024); In re Ginsberg, 630 S.W.3d 1 (Tex. 2018)). 12. This is not
miscommunication. The written order—signed by Judge Kaitcer—contains an
objectively false recital of agreement. This alone demonstrates willful
misconduct, because the judge’s duty was to ensure accuracy of court
records, not to manufacture consent that did not exist. III. Conclusion 13. A
judge who knowingly signs an order falsely reciting party agreement,
especially after compelling a litigant to sign against their will, violates both

=== PAGE 13 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
statutory authority and multiple canons of the Texas Code of Judicial
Conduct. Such conduct is not a mere technical error but a willful breach of
judicial duty that undermines the integrity of the judiciary and erodes public
confidence in the courts. The State Commission on Judicial Conduct is
empowered—and indeed obligated—to investigate such allegations, and, if
substantiated, to recommend appropriate discipline or removal to preserve
the honor and legitimacy of the Texas judicial system. 14. No opinion or
reasoning exists that would explain these actions, and the totality of the
record through all five complaints submitted to this Body 7 demonstrate
systemic abuse spanning across five judges in multiple courts without any
substantive explanation. 15. By choosing to investigate these issues, the
Commission can address a rapidly growing problem now that will only
continue to grow if left ignored Respectfully submitted,

from the commission, Complainant will provide all evidence to support the
allegations herein. How on earth is this possible? Research if this is the
biggest failure in Texas history. 
Answer (Texas)
Short response
While the five judicial complaints described reveal a deeply troubling
pattern of alleged judicial misconduct and systemic failures in the Texas
judiciary, there is no legal authority or historical record in the provided
materials to definitively declare this the single greatest failure in Texas
judicial history. However, the conduct alleged—if substantiated—would
represent a significant and possibly unprecedented breakdown in judicial
accountability and public trust under Texas law.
Summary
The complaints against Judges Kenneth Newell, David L. Evans, Kate Stone,
James Munford, and Jeffrey Kaitcer collectively allege a pattern of willful
violations of judicial canons, statutory mandates, and due process, including
failures to rule on motions, improper staff involvement in recusal
proceedings, and the signing of orders with false recitals. Texas law,
including the Constitution and the Code of Judicial Conduct, provides
mechanisms for investigating and disciplining such conduct, emphasizing
the importance of judicial integrity and public confidence. The cited
authorities confirm that persistent or willful violations, especially those that
undermine public trust, are grounds for investigation and removal.
Although the complaints describe a scenario that could be considered a
major systemic failure—given the number of judges involved, the nature of
the alleged violations, and the apparent lack of appellate or administrative
intervention—there is no direct precedent or legal authority in the provided
sources that labels this as the "biggest failure" in Texas history. Nonetheless,

=== PAGE 14 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
the situation described is grave and, if proven, would demand urgent and
comprehensive action by the State Commission on Judicial Conduct to
restore the rule of law and public confidence in the Texas judiciary.
Background and Relevant Law
Legislative and Constitutional Framework
The Texas Constitution establishes clear standards for judicial conduct and
accountability. Article 5, Section 1-a authorizes the removal of judges for
willful or persistent violations of Supreme Court rules, incompetence, willful
violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct, or conduct that is inconsistent with
judicial duties or that casts public discredit on the judiciary or the
administration of justice, as set out in Tex. Const. art. 5 § 1-a. Article 15,
Section 6 further empowers the Texas Supreme Court to remove district
judges for incompetence, partiality, oppression, official misconduct, or
negligent failure to perform judicial duties, upon presentment by at least ten
practicing lawyers, as per Tex. Const. art. 15 § 6.
The Texas Family Code, specifically Section 201.007, limits the authority of
associate judges to render and sign final orders only under certain
conditions, such as when all parties have agreed in writing, a party is in
default, or a party has filed an unrevoked waiver. Orders signed outside
these parameters are not valid, and associate judges must otherwise make
recommendations to the referring court (Tex. Fam. Code § 201.007).
Case Law
Texas appellate courts have repeatedly held that judges have a ministerial
duty to consider and rule on properly filed motions within a reasonable time,
and that failure to do so constitutes a denial of due process and may be
remedied by mandamus (Barnes v. State, 832 S.W.2d 424 (Tex. App. 1992); 
Safety-Kleen Corp. v. Garcia, 945 S.W.2d 268 (Tex. App. 1997)). The Texas
Supreme Court has emphasized that persistent or willful violations of the
law or the Code of Judicial Conduct, or conduct that casts public discredit on
the judiciary, are grounds for discipline or removal (In re Rose, 144 S.W.3d
661 (Tex. 2004)).
Judicial accountability is also closely tied to public perception. The courts
have recognized that even the appearance of impropriety or partiality can be
as damaging as actual misconduct, and that public confidence in the
judiciary is essential to the rule of law (In Re Lowery, 999 S.W.2d 639 (Tex.
1998)).
Secondary Materials
Commentary on judicial conduct commissions highlights the particular
challenges faced in Texas, where the election of judges may contribute to
increased instances of misconduct and complicate the work of oversight
bodies. This context underscores the importance of robust mechanisms for
judicial accountability in Texas.

Analysis
The Alleged Judicial Failures
The five complaints collectively allege a series of grave judicial failures:
Failure to Rule on Motions: Judges allegedly refused to hear or rule
on properly filed emergency motions, including those involving child
safety, in violation of their ministerial duties. Texas law is clear that
judges must rule on such motions within a reasonable time, and failure
to do so is not discretionary but a denial of due process (Barnes v.
State, 832 S.W.2d 424 (Tex. App. 1992); Safety-Kleen Corp. v. Garcia,
945 S.W.2d 268 (Tex. App. 1997)).
Improper Staff Involvement and Recusal Procedures: Judges
allegedly permitted court coordinators—who are not neutral officers—
to participate in recusal proceedings, contrary to procedural rules that
assign these duties to the court clerk. Such actions undermine the
appearance of impartiality and violate the requirement that judges
maintain the integrity and independence of the judiciary (In Re Lowery,
999 S.W.2d 639 (Tex. 1998)).
Signing Orders with False Recitals: An associate judge is alleged to
have knowingly signed an order falsely reciting party agreement,
despite knowing that a party had withdrawn consent and was
compelled to sign. This is a direct violation of statutory requirements
and judicial canons, and constitutes willful misconduct (Tex. Fam. Code
§ 201.007).
Pattern of Systemic Abuse: The complaints describe a pattern of
procedural irregularities, repeated denial of hearings, disregard for
objections, and the issuance of orders in violation of clear rules. When
such conduct is persistent and willful, it falls squarely within the
grounds for investigation and discipline under the Texas Constitution
and the Code of Judicial Conduct (Tex. Const. art. 5 § 1-a; In re Rose,
144 S.W.3d 661 (Tex. 2004)).
The Role and Duty of the State Commission on Judicial
Conduct
The State Commission on Judicial Conduct is empowered—and indeed
obligated—to investigate credible allegations of judicial misconduct,
including willful or persistent violations of law, incompetence, or conduct
that undermines the judiciary (Tex. Const. art. 5 § 1-a). The Commission’s
mandate extends to conduct that is inconsistent with the proper
performance of judicial duties or that casts public discredit on the judiciary
(In re Rose, 144 S.W.3d 661 (Tex. 2004)).
The Commission is not limited to addressing isolated incidents; it must also
investigate patterns of behavior that may indicate systemic issues affecting
the integrity of the judiciary. The gravity of the allegations in these
• 
• 
• 
•

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
complaints—spanning multiple judges, courts, and types of misconduct—
would, if substantiated, demand a comprehensive investigation and
potentially the most serious disciplinary measures available.
Impact on Public Confidence and the Rule of Law
The Texas Supreme Court and appellate courts have repeatedly recognized
that the legitimacy of the judiciary depends on both the reality and the
perception of fairness, honesty, and adherence to the law. Conduct that
undermines public confidence, whether through actual misconduct or the
appearance thereof, is grounds for discipline and removal (In Re Lowery,
999 S.W.2d 639 (Tex. 1998)).
The complaints allege not only individual acts of misconduct but a broader
pattern of judicial inaction, procedural violations, and lack of accountability,
which—if true—would represent a significant threat to the rule of law in
Texas. The failure of appellate courts to respond to mandamus petitions, as
described, further compounds the perception of a systemic breakdown.
Is This the "Biggest Failure" in Texas Judicial History?
While the provided authorities confirm that the conduct alleged is grave and
would, if substantiated, represent a major failure of judicial accountability,
there is no legal authority or historical record in the materials provided that
definitively labels this as the single greatest failure in Texas judicial history.
The Texas judiciary has faced significant scandals and failures in the past,
but the sources do not provide a comparative framework or precedent for
ranking this situation above all others.
However, the combination of multiple judges allegedly engaging in willful
and persistent violations, the apparent lack of appellate or administrative
intervention, and the direct harm alleged (including injury to a child and
deprivation of due process) would, if proven, constitute a systemic failure of
unusual magnitude. The situation described is certainly among the most
serious types of judicial breakdowns contemplated by the Texas Constitution
and the Code of Judicial Conduct.
Exceptions and Caveats
Allegations vs. Findings: The analysis above is based on the
allegations in the complaints. The Commission on Judicial Conduct
must conduct a thorough investigation to determine the veracity of
these claims before any findings or disciplinary action can be made.
No Direct Precedent for "Biggest Failure": The provided authorities
do not offer a direct precedent or legal standard for declaring a
particular episode the "biggest failure" in Texas judicial history. The
assessment of historical significance is ultimately a matter of
interpretation and context.
Systemic Issues in Elected Judiciary: Secondary materials suggest
that Texas’s system of electing judges may contribute to increased
•

instances of misconduct and complicate oversight, but this is a broader
context rather than a direct legal finding.
Conclusion
The five judicial complaints described allege a pattern of willful and
persistent violations of judicial canons, statutory mandates, and due process
by multiple judges in Texas, including failures to rule on motions, improper
staff involvement in recusal proceedings, and the signing of orders with
false recitals. Texas law provides clear mechanisms for investigating and
disciplining such conduct, emphasizing the importance of judicial integrity
and public confidence. While the situation described is grave and, if
substantiated, would represent a significant and possibly unprecedented
breakdown in judicial accountability, there is no legal authority in the
provided materials to definitively declare it the single greatest failure in
Texas judicial history. Nonetheless, the allegations demand urgent and
comprehensive action by the State Commission on Judicial Conduct to
restore the rule of law and public trust in the Texas judiciary.
Legal Authorities
In Re Lowery, 999 S.W.2d 639 (Tex. 1998)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
Clearly, our scheme of judicial accountability arises in part from a justifiable
concern for the relationship between judicial conduct and public perception.
Art. V, 1-a(6)A of the Texas Constitution imposes sanctions for conduct that
casts public discredit upon the judiciary or the administration of justice;
Canon 2A of the Code of Judicial Conduct requires that a judge act at all
times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and
impartiality of the judiciary. While the legal profession has historically been
considered a noble one, modern-day portrayals paint a picture of scorn and
ridicule. In the courtroom called the media, in the trial by public perception,
the image of the judicial system is at an all-time low.
Summary
The passage emphasizes the importance of judicial accountability and the
impact of judicial conduct on public perception. It highlights that the Texas
Constitution and the Code of Judicial Conduct impose sanctions for conduct
that undermines public confidence in the judiciary. The passage also notes
that the image of the judicial system is at an all-time low, suggesting that
there are significant concerns about judicial conduct and public perception.

=== PAGE 18 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
When a motion is properly filed and pending before a trial court, the act of
giving consideration to and ruling upon that motion is a ministerial act. ... In
such circumstances, a trial court must consider and rule upon the motion
within what, when all the surrounding circumstances are taken into account,
constitutes a reasonable time. ... This rule does not intrude upon the trial
court's discretion, because a trial court has no discretion to refuse to act. ...
A refusal to rule within a reasonable time would frustrate that process and,
moreover, would constitute a denial of due course of law, ... Consequently,
mandamus is available to compel a trial court to make a ruling within a
reasonable time.
Summary
Texas law mandates that trial courts must rule on properly filed motions
within a reasonable time. This is a ministerial duty, meaning the court has
no discretion to refuse to act. Failure to do so constitutes a denial of due
process, and mandamus can be used to compel the court to act. This legal
framework is relevant to the complaints against the judges, as it highlights
the procedural failures and potential misconduct in not addressing motions
and petitions in a timely manner.
Safety-Kleen Corp. v. Garcia, 945 S.W.2d 268 (Tex. App. 1997)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
A trial court is required to consider and rule upon a motion within a
reasonable time. ... 'When a motion is properly filed and pending before a
trial court, the act of giving consideration to and ruling upon that motion is
a ministerial act,' and mandamus may issue to compel the trial judge to
act. ... Despite Judge Garcia's misgivings, he is the elected official assigned
to hear this cause, and neither the case law previously cited nor the Texas
Code of Judicial Conduct give Judge Garcia the discretion to refuse to hear
or rule on Safety-Kleen's motion within a reasonable period of time.
Summary
Judges have a ministerial duty to consider and rule on motions within a
reasonable time. This duty is not discretionary, and failure to act can be
addressed through mandamus. The passage highlights the importance of
judicial responsiveness and adherence to procedural rules.

Rose failed to timely and properly receipt, deposit, and account for monies
received by the court, which dereliction of duty involved far more than a
thousand instances, occurred over a period covering more than five years,
and resulted in litigation and negative media attention concerning Rose's
conduct. Each and every such instance constitutes an instance of willful or
persistent conduct in violation of the law or the Code of Judicial Conduct,
willful or persistent conduct that is clearly inconsistent with the proper
performance of his duties, or willful or persistent conduct that casts public
discredit on the judiciary or the administration of justice, in violation of the
standards set forth in: 1. Article 5, Section 1-a(6)A. of the Texas
Constitution; 2. Canon 2A of the Texas Code of Judicial Conduct; [] or 3.
Section 33.001(b) of the Texas Government Code.
Summary

Summary
An associate judge in Texas has the authority to render and sign certain
types of orders, including final orders agreed to by all parties, final default
orders, and temporary orders. However, these powers are subject to specific
conditions, such as the requirement for written agreement by all parties or
the filing of an unrevoked waiver. The passage also clarifies that orders
rendered and signed by an associate judge are considered orders of the
referring court. This information is relevant to understanding the procedural
context in which the alleged judicial misconduct occurred, as it highlights
the statutory requirements that may have been violated.

Summary
The Texas Constitution provides a mechanism for the removal of district
court judges who are incompetent, guilty of misconduct, or fail to perform
their duties. The Supreme Court of Texas has the original jurisdiction to
hear such cases when presented in writing by at least ten practicing
lawyers. This process is designed to maintain the integrity of the judiciary
and ensure that judges are held accountable for their actions.

Extract
Carol Collins, the Executive Director of Wyoming's Commission on Judicial
Conduct and Ethics, said the difference between election and appointment
states is 'always one of our topics of conversation when we come back' from
national judicial conduct conferences. Collins thinks elections open the door
to judges' accepting bribes or granting preferential treatment to campaign
donors--election-driven misconduct that would not exist in a state where all
judges are appointed. 'We believe that we have less conduct issues than
states that have an electoral process--especially I'm looking at Texas,' she
said. 'That must be a nightmare to work with that commission down there.'
Summary
The passage provides insight into the challenges faced by judicial conduct
commissions in states like Texas, where judges are elected. It suggests that
the electoral process may lead to more instances of misconduct, such as
accepting bribes or granting preferential treatment, which could contribute
to systemic issues within the judiciary. This context is relevant to
understanding the broader challenges faced by the Texas judiciary and its
conduct commission.
