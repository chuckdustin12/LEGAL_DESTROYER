Question
In texas family law, if a final trial is set, and the petitioner has not disclosed
any evidence or witnesses, what's the process during trial if they try to have
her testify without disclosing the testimony?
Answer (Texas)
Short response
In Texas family law, if the petitioner has not disclosed any evidence or
witnesses before a final trial, the petitioner may still testify as a named
party, but any undisclosed evidence or testimony on undisclosed topics may
be excluded unless the court finds good cause for the nondisclosure or
determines that the failure to disclose does not unfairly surprise or
prejudice the opposing party. The respondent should object under Texas
Rule of Civil Procedure 193.6, triggering a hearing where the petitioner
must prove an exception applies for any undisclosed evidence or testimony
beyond what is inherent to her status as a party.
Summary
Texas law requires parties in civil cases, including family law matters, to
disclose witnesses and evidence before trial. If a party fails to do so, Texas
Rule of Civil Procedure 193.6 generally mandates exclusion of undisclosed
evidence and the testimony of undisclosed witnesses, unless the offering
party can show good cause for the failure or that the lack of disclosure does
not unfairly surprise or prejudice the other side. However, the rule
specifically exempts named parties from the witness-identification
requirement, so a petitioner may testify as a party even if not listed as a
witness, though the scope of her testimony may be limited to what was
properly disclosed.
At trial, if the petitioner attempts to testify or introduce evidence that was
not disclosed, the opposing party should object under Rule 193.6. The court
will then determine whether to allow the testimony or evidence, considering
whether the petitioner can establish good cause for the nondisclosure or
show that the respondent is not unfairly surprised or prejudiced. The court
may also grant a continuance to cure any prejudice. In child custody cases,
courts have some discretion to admit late-disclosed testimony if the best
interest of the child so requires, but this is a narrow exception.

Background and Relevant Law
Texas Rules of Civil Procedure 193.6 and 194
The Texas Rules of Civil Procedure govern discovery and disclosure
obligations in civil cases, including family law matters. Rule 194 requires
parties to make initial disclosures, including the identification of witnesses
and evidence they may use at trial, at least 30 days before trial (Accelerated
Inventory Mgmt. v. McElroy, 2024 Tex. App. LEXIS 2042 (Tex. App. Mar. 28,
2024)). Rule 193.6 provides the enforcement mechanism: if a party fails to
timely disclose evidence or identify witnesses, that party is generally
prohibited from introducing the undisclosed evidence or offering the
testimony of the undisclosed witness at trial unless the court finds (1) good
cause for the failure or (2) that the failure will not unfairly surprise or
prejudice the other parties (Olvera v. Fid. & Deposit Co. of Md.,
14-23-00528-CV (Tex. App. Aug 29, 2024); AlphaMar Grp. v. M&M Prot.,
14-20-00350-CV (Tex. App. May 10, 2022)).
Importantly, Rule 193.6 expressly excludes named parties from the witness-
identification requirement, meaning a party cannot be barred from testifying
solely because she was not listed as a witness in discovery (Edgley v.
Ragland, 01-23-00537-CV (Tex. App. Jul 24, 2025)). However, the content of
the party’s testimony may still be limited to topics that were properly
disclosed, and any attempt to introduce undisclosed documents or other
evidence remains subject to exclusion.
Case Law Interpreting Rule 193.6
Texas appellate courts have consistently enforced the automatic exclusion
rule for undisclosed evidence and witnesses, subject to the two exceptions of
good cause or lack of unfair surprise/prejudice (F 1 Constr., Inc. v. Banz, No.
05-19-00717-CV (Tex. App. Jan 20, 2021); West Telemarketing Corp. v.
McClure, 225 S.W.3d 658 (Tex. App. 2006)). The burden is on the party
seeking to introduce the evidence or testimony to establish that an
exception applies (In re Cruz, 04-18-00865-CV (Tex. App. Aug 18, 2021)). If
the offering party cannot meet this burden, the court must exclude the
evidence or testimony, though it may grant a continuance to allow the
opposing party to conduct discovery and cure any prejudice (Olvera v. Fid. &
Deposit Co. of Md., 14-23-00528-CV (Tex. App. Aug 29, 2024); In re Cruz,
04-18-00865-CV (Tex. App. Aug 18, 2021)).
In family law cases, particularly those involving child custody, courts have
recognized a narrow exception where the best interest of the child may
justify admitting late-disclosed testimony, even if the technical requirements
of Rule 193.6 are not met (Magro v. Magro, NO. 01-19-00701-CV (Tex. App.
Dec 10, 2020); In re Marriage of Keys, No. 06-19-00018-CV (Tex. App. Oct
03, 2019)). However, this exception is applied sparingly and only where the
record supports a finding that the best interest of the child outweighs the
prejudice to the opposing party.

Analysis
The Process at Trial
If the petitioner in a Texas family law case has not disclosed any evidence or
witnesses before a final trial, and then attempts to testify at trial, the
following process applies:
Objection by Opposing Party: The respondent should object to the
petitioner’s testimony or the introduction of any evidence on the
grounds of nondisclosure under Rule 193.6 (Clark v. Trailways, Inc.,
774 S.W.2d 644 (Tex. 1989); Gee v. Liberty Mut. Fire Ins. Co., 765 S.W.
2d 394 (Tex. 1989)). This objection must be made contemporaneously,
at the time the evidence or testimony is offered, to preserve error for
appeal.
Named Party Exception: Under Rule 193.6, a named party (such as
the petitioner) cannot be barred from testifying solely because she was
not identified as a witness in discovery (Edgley v. Ragland,
01-23-00537-CV (Tex. App. Jul 24, 2025)). Therefore, the court will
generally allow the petitioner to take the stand and testify as to matters
inherent to her status as a party.
Scope of Testimony: While the petitioner may testify as a party, the
scope of her testimony may be limited. If she attempts to testify about
matters, facts, or evidence that were not disclosed in discovery, the
respondent can object to those specific topics or items. The court must
then determine whether to allow the testimony or evidence, applying
the Rule 193.6 framework (Oscar Luis Lopez v. La Madeleine of Texas,
200 S.W.3d 854 (Tex. App. 2006); Harris County v. Inter Nos, Ltd., 199
S.W.3d 363 (Tex. App. 2006)).
Burden on Offering Party: The petitioner bears the burden of
showing either good cause for the failure to disclose or that the
respondent is not unfairly surprised or prejudiced by the late disclosure
(F 1 Constr., Inc. v. Banz, No. 05-19-00717-CV (Tex. App. Jan 20, 2021); 
Brunelle v. Txvt Ltd. Partnership, 198 S.W.3d 476 (Tex. App. 2006)). The
court has discretion to determine whether this burden has been met,
but the record must support any finding of good cause or lack of unfair
surprise/prejudice.
Court’s Options: If the petitioner cannot meet her burden, the court
must exclude the undisclosed evidence or testimony. Alternatively, the
court may grant a continuance or temporarily postpone the trial to
allow the respondent to conduct discovery and cure any prejudice
(Olvera v. Fid. & Deposit Co. of Md., 14-23-00528-CV (Tex. App. Aug 29,
2024); In re Cruz, 04-18-00865-CV (Tex. App. Aug 18, 2021)).
Preservation of Error: If the court erroneously admits undisclosed
evidence or testimony without the required showing, the respondent
must make an offer of proof to preserve the issue for appeal

(Accelerated Inventory Mgmt. v. McElroy, 2024 Tex. App. LEXIS 2042
(Tex. App. Mar. 28, 2024)).
Application to the Petitioner’s Testimony
If the petitioner was not disclosed as a witness: She may still
testify as a named party. Rule 193.6 does not permit exclusion of a
party’s own testimony solely for failure to list herself as a witness
(Edgley v. Ragland, 01-23-00537-CV (Tex. App. Jul 24, 2025)).
If the petitioner attempts to testify about undisclosed topics or
introduce undisclosed evidence: The respondent should object. The
court will then require the petitioner to show good cause for the
nondisclosure or that the respondent is not unfairly surprised or
prejudiced. If the petitioner cannot meet this burden, the court must
exclude the testimony or evidence on those topics (Oscar Luis Lopez v.
La Madeleine of Texas, 200 S.W.3d 854 (Tex. App. 2006)).
If the petitioner attempts to introduce documents or other
evidence not disclosed: The same process applies. The evidence is
excluded unless the petitioner can meet the Rule 193.6 exceptions.
Special Considerations in Family Law
In family law cases, especially those involving child custody, courts have
recognized that the best interest of the child may, in rare cases, justify
admitting late-disclosed testimony (Magro v. Magro, NO. 01-19-00701-CV
(Tex. App. Dec 10, 2020); In re Marriage of Keys, No. 06-19-00018-CV (Tex.
App. Oct 03, 2019)). This is not a blanket exception, and the court must still
consider whether the respondent is unfairly surprised or prejudiced. The
record must support any finding that the best interest of the child outweighs
the prejudice to the opposing party.
Remedies and Sanctions
If the court finds that the petitioner’s failure to disclose was not justified and
would unfairly surprise or prejudice the respondent, the court must exclude
the evidence or testimony. The court may also grant a continuance to allow
the respondent to conduct discovery and cure any prejudice (Olvera v. Fid. &
Deposit Co. of Md., 14-23-00528-CV (Tex. App. Aug 29, 2024)). Additional
sanctions may be imposed for discovery abuses, including orders precluding
the presentation of evidence or testimony (Civil Litigation, 2022-05-05).
Exceptions and Caveats
Named Party Exception: A named party cannot be barred from
testifying solely for failure to disclose herself as a witness (Edgley v.
Ragland, 01-23-00537-CV (Tex. App. Jul 24, 2025)).
Best Interest of the Child: In child custody cases, courts may admit
late-disclosed testimony if the best interest of the child so requires, but
this is a narrow and fact-specific exception (Magro v. Magro, NO.

06-19-00018-CV (Tex. App. Oct 03, 2019)).
Continuance as a Remedy: The court may grant a continuance to
allow the opposing party to conduct discovery and cure any prejudice
caused by the late disclosure (Olvera v. Fid. & Deposit Co. of Md.,
14-23-00528-CV (Tex. App. Aug 29, 2024)).
Superseded Authority: The case In the interest of P.M.B., 2 S.W.3d
618 (Tex. App. 1999) was superseded by statute as recognized in In re
Interest of H.A.C., No. 06-16-00063-CV (Tex. App. Feb 15, 2017), but
the general principle of automatic exclusion absent good cause or lack
of unfair surprise/prejudice remains valid under current Rule 193.6.
Conclusion
In summary, if a petitioner in a Texas family law case has not disclosed any
evidence or witnesses before trial, she may still testify as a named party, but
her testimony and any evidence she seeks to introduce may be limited to
what was properly disclosed. The respondent should object to any
undisclosed evidence or testimony under Rule 193.6, shifting the burden to
the petitioner to show good cause for the nondisclosure or that the
respondent is not unfairly surprised or prejudiced. The court has discretion
to admit or exclude the evidence or testimony, grant a continuance, or
impose other sanctions, but must be guided by the principles of fairness and
the specific exceptions recognized in the rules and case law. In child custody
cases, the best interest of the child may, in rare circumstances, justify
admitting late-disclosed testimony, but this is not the norm. The key for
practitioners is to timely object, clearly articulate the basis for exclusion,
and ensure the record reflects any findings or exceptions the court relies
upon.
Legal Authorities
Gee v. Liberty Mut. Fire Ins. Co., 765 S.W.2d 394 (Tex. 1989)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
Liberty Mutual filed a motion in limine prior to trial to exclude any witnesses
not indicated in Gee's response. In addition, Liberty Mutual filed a written
motion to exclude testimony of unnamed witnesses pursuant to Texas Rules
of Civil Procedure 215(5). The trial court overruled these motions and
allowed Gee to present two undisclosed fact witnesses... Gee was further
allowed to introduce deposition testimony of two undisclosed expert
witnesses... In the instant case, there is nothing in the record which
indicates Gee satisfied his burden to show good cause. Therefore... It is
apparent the trial court erred because the testimony of the unidentified
witnesses should not have been admitted in this case.

Summary
The case holds that, when a party fails to identify witnesses in discovery,
their testimony should be excluded at trial unless the offering party shows
good cause. It also notes the mechanism: opposing party files motions (in
limine and to exclude under the rule). If the court erroneously admits such
testimony without good cause, it can be reversible error, subject to harm
analysis.
Clark v. Trailways, Inc., 774 S.W.2d 644 (Tex. 1989)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
Moreover, an erroneous finding of good cause under rule 215(5) does not
provide a basis for reversal on appeal unless the undisclosed witness or
evidence is actually offered and admitted at trial. An objection or motion at
that point in the proceedings provides the trial court with a final opportunity
to prevent the erroneous admission of the testimony or evidence... The
efficient administration of justice thus requires that trial courts have the
opportunity to review any previous finding of good cause, regardless of
whether the finding occurred several months or one day prior to the actual
offering of the testimony or evidence at issue." ... "TDN filed a motion for
sanctions under Tex.R.Civ.P. 215(5) in which it asked the trial court not to
permit any witness to testify who had not been revealed... the trial court
held a hearing... Without a showing of good cause by Clark for failure to
supplement... the trial court denied the motion for sanctions and ruled that
he would allow Lira to testify. Trial commenced the next day... The court of
appeals held that the trial court abused its discretion in allowing the
undisclosed witness to testify... it reverses... on the basis that this error was
not preserved... It is important to emphasize the time frame... This is not a
situation in which a party makes a general pre-trial motion to exclude
testimony of undisclosed witnesses and months later... fails to object to the
admission of such testimony.
Summary
The case explains that when a party attempts to present an undisclosed
witness, the opposing party must object at the time the testimony is offered
to preserve error and give the trial court a final chance to exclude it. It ties
the process to Rule 215(5)’s exclusionary sanction absent good cause and
emphasizes contemporaneous objection, even if there was a prior ruling.

Texas Supreme Court

Extract
We note, however, that the trial courts are not without power to prevent the
enforcement of Rule 215(5) from operating as an injustice in a particular
case. When a party has failed to timely identify evidence in response to
discovery requests, the trial court has the discretion to postpone the trial
and, under Rule 215(3), to impose an appropriate sanction upon the
offending party for abuse of the discovery process... Arrambide was called as
a rebuttal witness... This is the first time the court has considered Rule
215(5) in a case involving an undisclosed rebuttal witness... Rule 215 was
amended... to specify that the burden to show good cause for the admission
of evidence not disclosed in response to requests for discovery is on the
party offering the evidence.
Summary
Under TRCP 215(5), evidence or witnesses not timely disclosed in discovery
are subject to exclusion unless the offering party shows good cause. The
burden to show good cause is on the offering party. Trial courts may cure
prejudice by continuing the trial and imposing sanctions under TRCP 215(3).
The case also addresses that even rebuttal witnesses can fall under
disclosure and the exclusion rule.

Appellant also complains that Samuel's testimony was unreliable. However,
at trial, appellant objected to Samuel's testimony only on the grounds she
was not disclosed as a witness and her testimony was hearsay. Therefore, he
has waived his complaint about reliability. See TEX. R. APP. P. 33.1(a)...
Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting Samuel's
testimony.
Summary
The passage shows that when a party objects at trial to an undisclosed
witness, the court may still admit the testimony; other grounds not raised
are waived on appeal. It underscores the need to timely object and preserve
error, but it does not announce a categorical exclusion rule for undisclosed
witnesses; admissibility is within the trial court’s discretion, subject to
proper objections and harm analysis.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
Eleven times before today... this court has not found good cause to allow the
testimony of a previously undisclosed, incompletely disclosed, or untimely
disclosed person with knowledge of relevant facts in the face of a proper
discovery request. ... While the sanction is automatic... When a party has
failed to timely identify evidence in response to discovery requests, the trial
court has discretion to postpone the trial and, under Rule 215.3, to impose
an appropriate sanction upon the offending party for abuse of the discovery
process. ... Although the trial court should not allow delay to prejudice the
non-offending party, the trial court should ordinarily be able to cure any
prejudice by a just imposition of sanctions.
Summary
The Texas Supreme Court states exclusion of undisclosed witnesses is
automatic absent good cause. If a party tries to offer undisclosed testimony,
the proper process is objection under the discovery sanction rule, shifting
the burden to the offering party to show good cause (or lack of unfair
surprise/prejudice under current Rule 193.6). The court may alternatively
continue the trial and impose sanctions to cure prejudice.
Striegler, In Interest of, 915 S.W.2d 629 (Tex. App. 1996)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The cornerstone of discovery is to 'seek the truth, so that disputes may be
decided by what the facts reveal, not by what facts are concealed.' ... First,
discovery provides parties with notice of the evidence that the opposing
party intends to present. For example, with regard to witnesses, the
discovery process insures that parties can prepare for trial assured that a
witness will not be called when the opposing party has not previously
identified him. ... Therefore, when Purdom was not designated and his
documentation was not identified in response to the interrogatory
requesting the names of expert witnesses and documents prepared by
experts, his evidence was, under Sharp and Youngblood, automatically
excluded upon the objection made when good cause for its admission was
not shown.
Summary
The case reaffirms Texas discovery rules: undisclosed witnesses or evidence
are subject to automatic exclusion at trial upon a timely objection unless the
proponent shows good cause for the failure to disclose. Although the quoted
portion addresses an expert, it articulates the broader rule that witnesses
should not be called when not previously identified, supporting exclusion or
limitation of testimony if not disclosed.

Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Father also argues on appeal that the testimony of Officer Allen was not
disclosed before trial. At trial, when Allen testified, Father's attorney
objected as follows: The Department represented to the court that it had
disclosed both Allen and Powell as witnesses, that Powell's
recommendations were presented in previous hearings, and that Powell's
testimony on father's visitation with Amy should not be a surprise to Father
because Father had met with her during the visits and Powell testified
during prior hearings." ... "Mother's tenth issue argues that the trial court
erred in excluding the testimony of Mother's witness Susan Sorenson... the
Department stated that Sorensen had not been disclosed as a witness until
February 4, 2019... Mother's trial counsel told the trial court she had not
filed a motion for leave to identify the witness late. On appeal, Mother
argues there was no surprise to the Department in calling this witness
because the witness's name and resume had been disclosed twenty-one days
before she was called as a witness.
Summary
The passages show (1) when an objection is made that a witness was not
disclosed, the offering party may argue lack of unfair surprise due to prior
involvement or prior hearings; (2) trial courts have discretion to admit or
exclude testimony based on disclosure compliance and surprise; (3) failure
to move for leave to late-designate can support exclusion; and (4)
overlapping evidence admitted elsewhere can render any error harmless.
The material is illustrative but not a comprehensive procedural rule; it
demonstrates how Texas courts handle objections and discretion at trial.

Summary
The case confirms Rule 193.6’s mandatory exclusion of untimely-disclosed
evidence/witnesses unless the offering party proves good cause or lack of
unfair surprise/prejudice. Though the opinion’s holding concerns summary
judgments, Rule 193.6 by its terms governs trial as well, so its mechanism
applies at a family law final trial.
Oscar Luis Lopez v. La Madeleine of Texas, 200 S.W.3d 854 (Tex. App. 2006)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 193.6, which provides for the automatic
exclusion of La Madeleine's evidence unless it can show: (1) good cause for
failing to timely disclose the information; or (2) that the failure to timely
disclose the information 'will not unfairly surprise or unfairly prejudice'
Lopez. See TEX.R. CIV. P. 193.6(a). ... Rule of civil procedure 193.6(a) is
entitled 'Failing to Timely Respond — Effect on Trial' and provides: (a)
Exclusion of Evidence and Exceptions. A party who fails to make, amend, or
supplement a discovery response in a timely manner may not introduce in
evidence the material or information that was not timely disclosed, or offer
the testimony of a witness (other than a named party) who was not timely
identified, unless the court finds that: (1) there was good cause ...; or (2) the
failure ... will not unfairly surprise or unfairly prejudice the other parties. ...
it is not in the interest of justice to apply the rules of procedure unevenly or
inconsistently. ... Relying on Patterson ... La Madeleine argues the trial judge
'has the discretion to receive evidence which holds the promise of exposing
falsehoods.' This is a false statement. As discussed above, rule 193.6
governs what the trial court may do when confronted with evidence that was
undisclosed during discovery.
Summary
The case interprets and enforces TRCP 193.6’s automatic exclusion of
undisclosed evidence or witnesses, unless the proponent proves good cause
or lack of unfair surprise/prejudice. Courts may not admit undisclosed
evidence simply “in the interest of justice” or to expose alleged falsehoods;
Rule 193.6 controls. While a named party may testify, undisclosed material
information from that party is still subject to exclusion unless an exception is
proven.

Extract
When responding to written discovery, a party must make a complete
response, based on all information reasonably available to the responding
party or its attorney at the time the response is made. TEX. R. CIV. P. 193.1.
If a party learns that the party's response to written discovery was
incomplete or is no longer complete and correct, the party must supplement
the response to the extent that the written discovery sought other
information. Id. R. 193.5. If a party fails to make or supplement a discovery
response, the information not disclosed may be excluded at trial unless,
among other things, the trial court finds that the failure to respond did not
'unfairly surprise' the other party. Id. R. 193.6(a)(2). The trial court has
discretion to determine whether the proponent of the evidence met its
burden to show lack of surprise. ... See In re E.A.G., 373 S.W.3d 129, 145
(Tex. App.—San Antonio 2012, pet. denied) (holding that trial court did not
abuse its discretion in finding that the party was not unfairly surprised by
undisclosed information of which the party was aware prior to trial); In re
M.H., 319 S.W.3d 137, 147 (Tex. App.—Waco 2010, no pet.) (same); Brunelle
v. TXVT Ltd. P'ship, 198 S.W.3d 476, 480 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2006, no pet.)
(finding no abuse of discretion when appellant 'knew enough about [an
undisclosed] witness to not be unfairly surprised')
Summary
The passage states that undisclosed information can be excluded at trial
under Rule 193.6 unless the proponent shows lack of unfair surprise, with
the trial court exercising discretion. It cites cases where courts found no
unfair surprise when the opposing party already knew the information or the
witness. Thus, if petitioner did not disclose witnesses or testimony, the
opposing party can object and seek exclusion; petitioner must then prove
lack of unfair surprise or other good cause.
Boothe v. Hausler, 762 S.W.2d 304 (Tex. App. 1988)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Before a party may call a witness who is not named in response to a relevant
interrogatory, or is the subject of that party's unsupplemented
interrogatories, the trial court, to effectuate this rule, must find good cause
that 'requires' admission of that witness's testimony. Such a showing of good
cause is the only basis for allowing the testimony. ... Exclusion of the
testimony for noncompliance with the supplementation requirement is
mandatory unless good cause, sufficient to require admission, is shown to
exist.

=== PAGE 12 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
The case explains Texas’s no-ambush policy and mandates exclusion of
undisclosed witnesses absent a showing of good cause. It sets the trial
process: if a party attempts to call an undisclosed witness, the court must
exclude the testimony unless the offering party proves good cause requiring
admission.
Accelerated Inventory Mgmt. v. McElroy
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Under the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, parties are required to provide
opposing parties with certain information about evidence they may present
at trial, other than solely for impeachment purposes, at least 30 days before
trial. See Tex. R. Civ. P. 194.4. A party may not introduce material or
information that was not timely disclosed unless the trial court finds that '(1)
there was good cause for the failure to timely make, amend, or supplement
the discovery response; or (2) the failure to timely make, amend, or
supplement the discovery response will not unfairly surprise or unfairly
prejudice the other parties.' Tex.R.Civ.P. 193.6(a). The party seeking to
introduce the evidence carries the burden of establishing either good cause
for the failure to disclose or that the failure will not unfairly surprise or
prejudice the other party. Tex.R.Civ.P. 193.6(b)." ... "'A party may claim error
in a ruling to... exclude evidence only if the error affects a substantial right
of the party and... a party informs the court of its substance by an offer of
proof, unless the substance was apparent from the context.' Tex. R. Evid.
103(a)(2)... 'Making an offer of proof enables an appellate court to
determine whether the exclusion of the evidence was erroneous and
harmful, and it allows the trial court to reconsider its ruling in light of the
actual evidence.'
Summary
The passages state (1) pretrial disclosure obligation 30 days before trial; (2)
automatic exclusion of undisclosed evidence/witness testimony unless the
proponent proves good cause or no unfair surprise/prejudice; and (3) the
mechanism of offer of proof to preserve error if exclusion occurs. These
rules govern attempts to have a party testify on undisclosed topics other
than impeachment.

Extract
Generally, a party who fails to timely amend or supplement a discovery
response requesting evidence or the identity of witnesses may not introduce
the evidence or offer the testimony of the witness at trial. See Tex. R. Civ. P.
193.6(a). However, the trial court may admit untimely disclosed evidence or
allow a witness to testify if the proponent shows there is (1) good cause for
its failure to timely amend its response or identify the witness, or (2) a lack
of unfair prejudice or unfair surprise to the other party. Id. 193.6(a), (b).
Even if the party seeking to introduce the evidence at issue does not carry
its burden of establishing the grounds for the exception, the trial court may
grant a continuance or temporarily delay the trial 'to allow opposing parties
to conduct discovery regarding any new information presented by that
response.' Id. 193.6(c).
Summary
The passage states the default exclusion sanction under Rule 193.6 for
undisclosed witnesses/evidence; outlines two exceptions (good cause or no
unfair surprise/prejudice); and notes the court’s alternative of granting a
continuance to cure surprise. It describes the burden on the proponent and
the court’s options at trial.
In re Marriage of Keys, No. 06-19-00018-CV (Tex. App. Oct 03, 2019)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
In response to a request for disclosure under Rule 194.2 of the Texas Rules
of Civil Procedure, a party must disclose 'the name, address, and telephone
number of persons having knowledge of relevant facts, and a brief statement
of each identified person's connection with the case.' TEX. R. CIV. P.
194.2(e). Under Rule 193.6, A party who fails to make, amend, or
supplement a discovery response in a timely manner may not introduce in
evidence the material or information that was not timely disclosed, or offer
the testimony of a witness (other than a named party) who was not timely
identified, unless the court finds that: ... The purpose of this Rule 'is to
require complete responses to discovery so as to promote responsible
assessment of settlement and prevent trial by ambush.' ... 'The Rule is
mandatory, and its sole sanction—exclusion of evidence—is automatic,
unless there is good cause to excuse its imposition.' ... 'The trial court has
discretion to determine whether the offering party has met his burden of
showing good cause to admit the testimony; but the trial court has no
discretion to admit testimony excluded by the rule without a showing of
good cause.' ... There is a split between our Court and the Austin Court of
Appeals... The Austin court reiterated that '[c]ompared to the best interest
of the child, technical rules of pleading and practice are of little importance
in determining child custody issues' and wrote that, '[r]egardless of whether
the Department suffered unfair surprise or whether appellant had good

cause for the delay, the court should have admitted the testimony because
the best interest of children was at stake.' ... Applying the precedent of the
Austin Court of Appeals, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its
discretion in finding that there was good cause to admit K.G.'s testimony
and, therefore, did not err in allowing it.
Summary
The passages explain Texas’s automatic exclusion rule for undisclosed
evidence/witnesses (Rule 193.6), its purpose, and that admission requires a
showing of good cause. They also note a carve-out/split in child-custody
contexts where best-interest considerations may justify admission despite
nondisclosure, especially per Austin Court of Appeals, and that trial courts
have discretion to find good cause.
In re A.C., No. 02-18-00129-CV (Tex. App. Oct 24, 2018)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The trial court ruled that TDFPS's witnesses could testify after clarifying
that the disclosures were, at most, six days late (or eighty-four days before
trial) and after TDFPS's counsel explained that Mother knew what the
witness would testify about. On this record, the trial court could have
reasonably concluded that TDFPS met its burden to show that Mother
sustained no unfair surprise or prejudice. See Tex. R. Civ. P. 193.6(a)(2),
(b)...
Summary
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 193.6 generally excludes testimony from a
party or witness not timely disclosed unless the proponent shows good cause
or lack of unfair surprise/prejudice. In re A.C. affirms a trial court’s
discretion to allow late-disclosed witnesses to testify where the record
supports a finding of no unfair surprise or prejudice, even when disclosures
were late, and notes harmlessness if testimony is cumulative. This indicates
that at trial, if a party seeks to offer testimony without proper disclosure, the
court conducts a Rule 193.6 analysis and can allow the testimony upon a
showing under 193.6(a)(2), (b).

Texas Court of Appeals

=== PAGE 15 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 193.6 provides that a party who fails to make,
amend, or supplement a discovery response in a timely manner may not
introduce into evidence the material or information that was not timely
disclosed, or offer the testimony of a witness (other than a named party) that
was not timely identified, unless the trial court finds good cause for the
failure to timely make, amend, or supplement the discovery response or that
the failure would not unfairly surprise or prejudice the other parties. ...
Notably, under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 193.6, a trial court may not
exclude the testimony of a named party at trial, even if the party fails to
disclose or identify herself as a witness in her discovery responses. ...
Ragland is a named party in this case, and as such, is not barred from
testifying under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 193.6.
Summary
TRCP 193.6 bars undisclosed evidence and unidentified witnesses unless
good cause or lack of unfair surprise/prejudice is shown. However, the rule
expressly excludes named parties from the witness-identification
requirement; a named party cannot be barred from testifying solely for
failure to disclose herself as a witness. Thus, at trial you can object under
193.6 to undisclosed documents or nonparty witnesses, but you cannot
exclude the petitioner’s own testimony on that basis; other remedies
(limiting to disclosed topics, continuance, or excluding undisclosed exhibits)
may be sought.

If a party fails to timely make, amend, or supplement a discovery response,
that party may not offer the testimony of a witness who was not timely
identified unless the trial court finds that (1) good cause exists for the
failure to timely make, amend, or supplement the response, or (2) the failure
will not unfairly surprise or prejudice the other party. See TEX. R. CIV. P.
193.6(a)... The party seeking to call the witness bears the burden of
establishing good cause or the lack of unfair surprise or prejudice. See TEX.
R. CIV. P. 193.6(b)... The trial court, however, found that Elizabeth was not
unfairly surprised or prejudiced by Alejandro's failure to disclose the
identities of Smiley and the officers and that the best interest of the child
required that those witnesses be allowed to testify at trial. ... see also In re

Summary
The passage explains the default exclusion sanction under TRCP 193.6 for
untimely-disclosed witnesses: the party cannot offer the testimony unless
they prove good cause or lack of unfair surprise/prejudice. The burden is on
the offering party, and the court has broad discretion. In custody cases,
courts may also allow late-disclosed testimony when the best interest of the
child warrants it, even if there was nondisclosure, provided the record
supports lack of unfair surprise/prejudice or other justification.
In re Cruz, 04-18-00865-CV (Tex. App. Aug 18, 2021)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Rule 193.6 provides evidence is generally inadmissible if not timely
disclosed: Tex. R. Civ. P. 193.6(a). 'The burden of establishing good cause or
the lack of unfair surprise or unfair prejudice is on the party seeking to
introduce the evidence or call the witness.' Id. R. 193.6(b). 'Even if the party
seeking to introduce the evidence or call the witness fails to carry the
burden under paragraph (b), the court may grant a continuance or
temporarily postpone the trial to allow a response to be made, amended, or
supplemented, and to allow opposing parties to conduct discovery regarding
any new information presented by that response.' Id. R. 193.6(c).
Summary
The passage explains that undisclosed evidence/witness testimony is
inadmissible unless the offering party proves good cause or no unfair
surprise/prejudice. If they cannot, the court still has discretion to grant a
continuance to cure prejudice and allow discovery.

In the interest of P.M.B., 2 S.W.3d 618 (Tex. App. 1999)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Former Rule 215(5) of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure provides: A party
who fails to respond to or supplement his response to a request for
discovery shall not be entitled to present evidence which the party was
under a duty to provide in a response or supplemental response or to offer
the testimony of an expert witness or of any other person having knowledge
of discoverable matter, unless the trial court finds that good cause sufficient
to require admission exists. The burden of establishing good cause is upon
the party offering the evidence and must be shown in the record." ... "The
rule is mandatory, and its sole sanction--exclusion of evidence--is automatic,
unless there is good cause to excuse its imposition. ... The trial court has
discretion to determine whether the offering party has met his burden of
showing good cause to admit the testimony; but the trial court has no
discretion to admit testimony excluded by the rule without a showing of
good cause.
Summary
The case explains that if a party fails to timely disclose witnesses or
evidence, exclusion at trial is automatic unless the offering party shows
good cause (or, under modern Rule 193.6, lack of unfair surprise/unfair
prejudice). The burden is on the offering party, and the court cannot admit
the testimony without the required showing on the record.

Summary
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 193.6 bars a party from introducing
undisclosed evidence or information at trial if they failed to timely disclose it
in discovery. The exclusion is mandatory unless the offering party shows
good cause for the failure or proves no unfair surprise or prejudice to the
opposing party. This applies to witness testimony (including a party’s own
testimony on undisclosed topics) and other evidence. The trial court
enforces the rule at trial via objections and rulings.
F 1 Constr., Inc. v. Banz, No. 05-19-00717-CV (Tex. App. Jan 20, 2021)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Rule 193.6 requires the exclusion of evidence and witnesses that are not
timely disclosed in response to discovery requests. TEX. R. CIV. P. 193.6(a).
The Rule 'is mandatory, and the penalty—exclusion of evidence—is
automatic, absent a showing of: (1) good cause or (2) lack of unfair surprise
or (3) unfair prejudice.' ... The purposes of Rule 193.6 are threefold: (i) to
promote responsible assessment of settlement, (ii) to prevent trial by
ambush, and (iii) to give the other party the opportunity to prepare rebuttal
to expert testimony. ... [T]he party seeking to call an untimely disclosed
witness or introduce untimely disclosed evidence must establish that the
other party had enough evidence to reasonably assess settlement, to avoid
trial by ambush, and to prepare rebuttal to expert testimony.
Summary
Texas Rule 193.6 mandates exclusion of undisclosed witnesses/evidence at
trial unless the proponent shows good cause or no unfair surprise/prejudice.
The burden is on the offering party to make that showing. The purposes
emphasize preventing trial by ambush and ensuring fair preparation. Thus,
if petitioner tries to testify without prior disclosure, the respondent should
object under Rule 193.6; the court must exclude unless petitioner proves an
exception (good cause or no unfair surprise/prejudice), typically via an on-
the-record offer of proof.

other party.
Summary
The passage explains that under TRCP 193.6, undisclosed evidence or
witnesses must be excluded at trial unless the proponent proves good cause
or no unfair surprise/prejudice. It also notes post-2021 mandatory
disclosures. Courts may exclude a party from testifying if not disclosed, as in
the cited order. This framework applies to any Texas civil trial, including
family cases.

When a party fails to supplement a discovery response in a timely manner,
the evidence may be excluded. TEX.R.CIV.P. 193.6(a)... The remedy is
mandatory and automatic unless the court finds there was good cause for
the failure to amend or supplement, or the failure will not unfairly surprise
or prejudice the other party. TEX.R.Civ.P. 193.6(a). The burden of
establishing good cause or lack of unfair surprise is on the party seeking to
introduce the evidence. TEX.R.CIV.P. 193.6(b). The trial court has discretion
to determine whether the offering party has met its burden of showing good
cause. The record must support a finding of good cause or lack of unfair
surprise. TEX.R.CIV.P. 193.6(b).
Summary
The passage states that undisclosed evidence can be excluded under Rule
193.6, with exclusion being mandatory unless the offering party proves good
cause or lack of unfair surprise/prejudice. The trial court has discretion but
must be guided by these principles; the offering party bears the burden, and
the record must support any exception.

Extract
A party may not call to testify a witness whom it should have identified
during discovery unless it can establish either good cause for failing to
identify the witness or that the opposing party was not unfairly surprised or
prejudiced by the omission. See TEX.R. CIV. P. 193.6(a). The proponent of
the testimony bears the burden to establish good cause or lack of unfair
surprise or prejudice. See TEX.R. CIV. P. 193.6(b). The trial court has
discretion to determine whether the proponent has met its burden.
Summary
The passage explains that undisclosed witnesses are excluded unless the
offering party proves good cause or no unfair surprise/prejudice; the burden
is on the offering party, and the court has discretion. This directly informs
the process at trial when a party seeks to elicit testimony from an
undisclosed witness.
Good v. Smith County Judge, 339 S.W.3d 260 (Tex. App. 2011)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
A party who fails to make, amend, or supplement a discovery response in a
timely manner may not introduce in evidence the material or information
that was not timely disclosed, or offer the testimony of a witness (other than
a named party) who was not timely identified, unless the court finds that: (1)
there was good cause for the failure to timely make, amend, or supplement
the discovery response; or (2) the failure to timely make, amend, or
supplement the discovery response will not unfairly surprise or unfairly
prejudice the other parties.
Summary
The passage articulates the Texas rule that undisclosed evidence or
undisclosed witnesses (other than a named party) are excluded unless the
proponent establishes good cause or no unfair surprise/prejudice. It speaks
to the process: object, seek exclusion, and court assesses good cause or lack
of unfair surprise/prejudice. It also clarifies the exception for named parties.

Summary
The material indicates that under TRCP 215, a court can exclude a party
from presenting evidence or witness testimony not disclosed in discovery,
and can deem RFAs admitted under TRCP 198.2(c). It also includes form
language to request an order precluding undisclosed witnesses/evidence as
a sanction for discovery failures. While one excerpt cautions against
interrogatories demanding a trial witness list as beyond scope in that
specific form, the key point is: failure to comply with discovery obligations
can lead to exclusion of testimony.
