Question
What constitutes "fraud on the court" in Texas, and what are the available
remedies if proven in a divorce proceeding?
Answer (Texas)
Short response
In Texas, "fraud on the court" in divorce proceedings generally refers to
extrinsic fraud—wrongful conduct by one party that prevents the other from
fully presenting their case or defenses, such as concealing assets or
preventing notice of the proceedings. If proven, remedies may include
setting aside the judgment through a bill of review, awarding a greater
share of the community estate to the wronged spouse, invalidating
fraudulent agreements, and, in some cases, awarding attorney’s fees or
sanctions.
Summary
Texas law distinguishes between intrinsic and extrinsic fraud, with only
extrinsic fraud—fraud that prevents a party from having a fair opportunity to
present their case—supporting a claim of "fraud on the court" sufficient to
set aside a divorce judgment. In the context of divorce, this often involves
one spouse concealing material facts or assets, or otherwise depriving the
other spouse of the ability to participate meaningfully in the proceedings.
If extrinsic fraud is established, the primary remedies include setting aside
the judgment via a bill of review, redistributing the community estate to
compensate the defrauded spouse, and, in some cases, awarding attorney’s
fees or sanctions. However, Texas courts do not recognize an independent
tort action for fraud on the community in divorce; the remedy is through
equitable adjustment of the property division, not through separate tort
damages or exemplary damages.
Background and Relevant Law
Legislative and Regulatory Framework
No specific Texas statute directly defines "fraud on the court" in divorce
proceedings. Instead, the concept is developed through case law,
particularly in the context of equitable remedies such as the bill of review,
which allows courts to set aside final judgments under certain
circumstances, including extrinsic fraud.

Case Law
Distinction Between Intrinsic and Extrinsic Fraud
Texas courts consistently distinguish between intrinsic and extrinsic fraud in
the context of attacking final judgments. Intrinsic fraud involves fraudulent
acts that pertain to issues actually litigated or that could have been litigated
in the original proceeding, such as perjured testimony or forged documents.
Extrinsic fraud, by contrast, involves conduct that prevents a party from
presenting their case or defenses—such as being kept unaware of the suit,
being prevented from attending court, or being misled about the
proceedings.
Only extrinsic fraud supports a bill of review to set aside a judgment. This
principle is established in numerous authorities, including:
Montgomery v. Kennedy, 669 S.W.2d 309, 312–13 (Tex. 1984)
S.C. v. M.B., 650 S.W.3d 428, 438 n.10 (Tex. 2022)
Tice v. City of Pasadena, 767 S.W.2d 700, 702 (Tex. 1989)
King Ranch, Inc. v. Chapman, 118 S.W.3d 742, 752 (Tex. 2003)
In re Beamon, 05-25-00266-CV (Tex. App. Jun 03, 2025)
Ince v. Ince, 58 S.W.3d 187, 193 (Tex. App. 2001)
Rathmell v. Morrison, 732 S.W.2d 6, 13 (Tex. App. 1987)
Wright v. Wright, 699 S.W.2d 620, 622 (Tex. App. 1985)
Edwards v. Edwards, 651 S.W.2d 940, 942 (Tex. App. 1983)
Rylee v. McMorrough, 616 S.W.2d 649, 652 (Tex. Ct. App. 1981)
Schnautz v. Stelfox, 235 S.W.2d 473, 475 (Tex. Ct. App. 1950)
Warne v. Jackson, 273 S.W. 315, 317 (Tex. App. 1925)
The Texas Supreme Court in Montgomery v. Kennedy and S.C. v. M.B.
reaffirmed that only extrinsic fraud—fraud that prevents a party from
presenting their case—can justify setting aside a judgment via bill of review.
Examples of Extrinsic Fraud
Extrinsic fraud may include:
Concealing the existence of the suit or failing to provide notice, thus
preventing a party from appearing (Ince v. Ince, 58 S.W.3d 187 (Tex.
App. 2001); Forney v. Jorrie, 511 S.W.2d 379 (Tex. Ct. App. 1974))
Fraudulently inducing a party to sign a mediated settlement agreement
(MSA) or other legal document, thereby depriving them of the
opportunity to assert their rights (In re Penafiel, 633 S.W.3d 36 (Tex.
App. 2021))
Concealing material facts or assets, especially in the context of a
fiduciary relationship between spouses, which prevents the other
spouse from asserting their rights at trial (Vickery v. Vickery, 999 S.W.
2d 342 (Tex. 1999); Montgomery v. Kennedy, 669 S.W.2d 309 (Tex.
1984))
Intrinsic fraud, such as perjury or the use of fraudulent documents that were
or could have been challenged in the original proceeding, does not support a

bill of review (Tice v. City of Pasadena, 767 S.W.2d 700 (Tex. 1989); King
Ranch, Inc. v. Chapman, 118 S.W.3d 742 (Tex. 2003)).
Fraud on the Community
In divorce proceedings, Texas courts recognize the concept of "fraud on the
community," which refers to wrongful acts by one spouse that deprive the
other of their interest in the community estate. This can be actual fraud
(intentional deception) or constructive fraud (breach of fiduciary duty, such
as disposing of community property without the other spouse’s knowledge
or consent).
Key authorities include:
Schlueter v. Schlueter, 975 S.W.2d 584, 588–90 (Tex. 1998)
Loaiza v. Loaiza, 130 S.W.3d 894, 900 (Tex. App. 2004)
Caldwell v. Quaid, 14-24-00071-CV (Tex. App. Jun 27, 2024)
Marriage of DeVine, Matter of, 869 S.W.2d 415, 424–25 (Tex. App.
1993)
Belz v. Belz, 667 S.W.2d 240, 247 (Tex. App. 1984) (declined to follow in
part by Schlueter v. Schlueter, 929 S.W.2d 94 (Tex. App. 1996)—see
below)
A presumption of constructive fraud arises when one spouse disposes of
community property without the other’s knowledge or consent, shifting the
burden to the disposing spouse to prove the fairness of the transaction
(Loaiza v. Loaiza, 130 S.W.3d 894 (Tex. App. 2004); Marriage of DeVine,
Matter of, 869 S.W.2d 415 (Tex. App. 1993)).
Remedies for Fraud on the Court in Divorce
If extrinsic fraud is proven, the primary remedy is to set aside the judgment
through a bill of review (Montgomery v. Kennedy, 669 S.W.2d 309 (Tex.
1984); S.C. v. M.B., 650 S.W.3d 428 (Tex. 2022)). The requirements for a
successful bill of review are:
The petitioner must have a meritorious defense to the original action.
The petitioner was prevented from making that defense by the fraud,
accident, or wrongful act of the opposing party.
The petitioner’s failure to present the defense was unmixed with any
fault or negligence of their own (Biggs v. Biggs, 553 S.W.2d 207 (Tex.
Ct. App. 1977); Forney v. Jorrie, 511 S.W.2d 379 (Tex. Ct. App. 1974); 
Hill v. Steinberger, 827 S.W.2d 58 (Tex. App. 1992)).
In the context of fraud on the community, the court may award the wronged
spouse a greater share of the community estate to compensate for their lost
interest (Schlueter v. Schlueter, 975 S.W.2d 584 (Tex. 1998); Caldwell v.
Quaid, 14-24-00071-CV (Tex. App. Jun 27, 2024); Marriage of DeVine, Matter
of, 869 S.W.2d 415 (Tex. App. 1993)). The court may also invalidate
fraudulent agreements, such as MSAs, and award attorney’s fees or
sanctions (In re Penafiel, 633 S.W.3d 36 (Tex. App. 2021); Ortmann v
Ortmann, 999 S.W.2d 85 (Tex. App. 1999)).

However, Texas courts do not recognize an independent tort action for fraud
on the community in divorce proceedings, and exemplary damages are not
available for such claims (Schlueter v. Schlueter, 975 S.W.2d 584 (Tex.
1998); In re Marriage of Notash, 118 S.W.3d 868 (Tex. App. 2003)). The
remedy is through equitable adjustment of the property division.
Administrative Decisions and Secondary Materials
Administrative and secondary sources confirm the above principles,
emphasizing that constructive fraud arises from breach of fiduciary duty
between spouses and that the remedy is an equitable adjustment of the
property division, not a separate tort action (Marriage Dissolution
(2022-05-05)).
Analysis
What Constitutes "Fraud on the Court" in Texas Divorce
Proceedings
"Fraud on the court" in Texas divorce proceedings is synonymous with
extrinsic fraud—wrongful conduct by one party that prevents the other from
fully participating in the litigation or asserting their rights. This includes,
but is not limited to:
Concealing the existence of the suit or failing to provide notice, thus
depriving a party of the opportunity to appear and defend (Ince v. Ince,
58 S.W.3d 187 (Tex. App. 2001); Forney v. Jorrie, 511 S.W.2d 379 (Tex.
Ct. App. 1974))
Fraudulently inducing a party to sign a settlement agreement or other
legal document, thereby depriving them of the opportunity to assert
their rights (In re Penafiel, 633 S.W.3d 36 (Tex. App. 2021))
Concealing material facts or assets, especially in the context of a
fiduciary relationship between spouses, which prevents the other
spouse from asserting their rights at trial (Vickery v. Vickery, 999 S.W.
2d 342 (Tex. 1999); Montgomery v. Kennedy, 669 S.W.2d 309 (Tex.
1984))
Intrinsic fraud, such as perjury or the use of fraudulent documents that were
or could have been challenged in the original proceeding, does not support a
bill of review (Tice v. City of Pasadena, 767 S.W.2d 700 (Tex. 1989); King
Ranch, Inc. v. Chapman, 118 S.W.3d 742 (Tex. 2003)).

Remedies if Fraud on the Court is Proven
Bill of Review
The primary remedy for extrinsic fraud is a bill of review, an equitable
proceeding that allows a court to set aside a final judgment if the petitioner
can show:
A meritorious defense to the original action.
That they were prevented from making that defense by the fraud,
accident, or wrongful act of the opposing party.
That their failure to present the defense was unmixed with any fault or
negligence of their own (Biggs v. Biggs, 553 S.W.2d 207 (Tex. Ct. App.
1977); Forney v. Jorrie, 511 S.W.2d 379 (Tex. Ct. App. 1974); Hill v.
Steinberger, 827 S.W.2d 58 (Tex. App. 1992)).
If successful, the court may set aside the original judgment and allow the
case to be retried on the merits.
Equitable Adjustment of Property Division
In cases of fraud on the community, the court may award the wronged
spouse a greater share of the community estate to compensate for their lost
interest (Schlueter v. Schlueter, 975 S.W.2d 584 (Tex. 1998); Caldwell v.
Quaid, 14-24-00071-CV (Tex. App. Jun 27, 2024); Marriage of DeVine, Matter
of, 869 S.W.2d 415 (Tex. App. 1993)). The court may also invalidate
fraudulent agreements, such as MSAs, and award attorney’s fees or
sanctions (In re Penafiel, 633 S.W.3d 36 (Tex. App. 2021); Ortmann v
Ortmann, 999 S.W.2d 85 (Tex. App. 1999)).
No Independent Tort Action or Exemplary Damages
Texas courts do not recognize an independent tort action for fraud on the
community in divorce proceedings, and exemplary damages are not
available for such claims (Schlueter v. Schlueter, 975 S.W.2d 584 (Tex.
1998); In re Marriage of Notash, 118 S.W.3d 868 (Tex. App. 2003)). The
remedy is through equitable adjustment of the property division.
Attorney’s Fees and Sanctions
In some cases, courts have awarded attorney’s fees and sanctions as part of
the remedy for fraud on the court (In re Penafiel, 633 S.W.3d 36 (Tex. App.
2021); Ortmann v Ortmann, 999 S.W.2d 85 (Tex. App. 1999)).
Burden of Proof and Presumptions
When one spouse disposes of community property without the other’s
knowledge or consent, a presumption of constructive fraud arises, shifting
the burden to the disposing spouse to prove the fairness of the transaction

(Loaiza v. Loaiza, 130 S.W.3d 894 (Tex. App. 2004); Marriage of DeVine,
Matter of, 869 S.W.2d 415 (Tex. App. 1993)).
Negative and Subsequent Treatment
Some authorities have been subject to negative or limiting treatment:
Belz v. Belz, 667 S.W.2d 240 (Tex. App. 1984) was declined to follow in
part by Schlueter v. Schlueter, 929 S.W.2d 94 (Tex. App. 1996),
particularly regarding the availability of personal judgments and the
scope of remedies. However, the core principle that fraud on the
community justifies an unequal division of property remains valid.
Ince v. Ince, 58 S.W.3d 187 (Tex. App. 2001) was overruled by Ramsey
v. State, 249 S.W.3d 568 (Tex. App. 2008) on unrelated grounds, so its
discussion of extrinsic fraud remains persuasive.
Rathmell v. Morrison, 732 S.W.2d 6 (Tex. App. 1987) was criticized in 
Turner v. Precision Surgical, L.L.C., 274 S.W.3d 245 (Tex. App. 2008),
but its distinction between extrinsic and intrinsic fraud is consistent
with later Supreme Court authority.
Exceptions and Caveats
Only extrinsic fraud supports a bill of review; intrinsic fraud, even if
egregious, does not (Tice v. City of Pasadena, 767 S.W.2d 700 (Tex.
1989); King Ranch, Inc. v. Chapman, 118 S.W.3d 742 (Tex. 2003)).
The petitioner must show that their inability to present their case was
not due to their own fault or negligence (Edwards v. Edwards, 651 S.W.
2d 940 (Tex. App. 1983); Rylee v. McMorrough, 616 S.W.2d 649 (Tex.
Ct. App. 1981)).
The remedy is equitable and discretionary; courts may deny relief if the
petitioner fails to meet the strict requirements for a bill of review
(Boley v. Boley, 506 S.W.2d 934 (Tex. Ct. App. 1974)).
Statutes of limitations may bar certain claims for damages, but not
equitable relief via bill of review if extrinsic fraud is proven (Oliver v.
Oliver, 889 S.W.2d 271 (Tex. 1994)).
Conclusion
In Texas divorce proceedings, "fraud on the court" is established by showing
extrinsic fraud—wrongful conduct that prevents a party from fully
presenting their case or defenses, such as concealing assets or failing to
provide notice of the proceedings. If proven, the primary remedies are
setting aside the judgment through a bill of review and awarding a greater
share of the community estate to the wronged spouse. Texas law does not
permit an independent tort action or exemplary damages for fraud on the
community; the remedy is through equitable adjustment of the property
division. The burden of proof may shift to the spouse accused of fraud, and
courts may also award attorney’s fees or sanctions in appropriate cases. The
law in this area is well-settled, with the distinction between extrinsic and
intrinsic fraud being central to the availability of relief.

Legal Authorities
Schlueter v. Schlueter, 975 S.W.2d 584 (Tex. 1998)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
Texas recognizes the concept of fraud on the community, which is a wrong
by one spouse that the court may consider in its division of the estate of the
parties and that may justify an unequal division of the property. See Belz v.
Belz, 667 S.W.2d 240, 247 (Tex.App.--Dallas 1984, writ ref'd n.r.e.). As the
court in Belz aptly described it: [A] claim of fraud on the community is a
means to an end, either to recover specific property wrongfully conveyed, ...
or ... to obtain a greater share of the community estate upon divorce, in
order to compensate the wronged spouse for his or her lost interest in the
community estate.
Summary
The passage from the Schlueter v. Schlueter case provides insight into what
constitutes "fraud on the community" in Texas. It is described as a wrong by
one spouse that can influence the division of the community estate,
potentially leading to an unequal division to compensate the wronged
spouse. The passage also clarifies that the remedy for such fraud is not an
independent tort action but rather an adjustment in the division of the
community estate.
Ortmann v Ortmann, 999 S.W.2d 85 (Tex. App. 1999)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
On June 25, 1996, a hearing was conducted and the trial court subsequently
ordered that Ortmann pay Brown $30,000 for fraud on the estate and waste
of community assets unless Ortmann could properly account for $30,000
that he had presumably received as settlement funds from a lawsuit filed in
El Paso in 1992. On October 4, 1996, the court entered a consent divorce
decree granting judgment against Ortmann for $20,000 for fraud on the
community estate and waste of community assets, and awarding $10,000 in
attorney's fees to Brown.
Summary
N example of a court finding fraud on the community estate in a divorce
proceeding, where the court ordered a monetary judgment against one party
for failing to account for settlement funds. This indicates that fraud on the
court in the context of divorce can involve misrepresentation or failure to

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
disclose financial assets, leading to a judgment for damages and attorney's
fees.
S.C. v. M.B., 650 S.W.3d 428 (Tex. 2022)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
But otherwise, the only way to obtain a 'just and right' division of the
property after divorce was through a bill of review that could set aside the
former judgment by establishing extrinsic fraud (whereas intrinsic fraud
would be insufficient). See, e.g., Montgomery v. Kennedy, 669 S.W.2d 309,
313 (Tex. 1984) (extrinsic fraud for bill of review). ... Fraud is intrinsic when
it involves merits issues that can be ferreted out in litigation. King Ranch,
Inc. v. Chapman, 118 S.W.3d 742, 752 (Tex. 2003). This includes some rather
despicable behavior like perjury, using fraudulent evidence, and hiding
evidence. Id. On the other hand, fraud is extrinsic when it denies a party the
opportunity to litigate its claim or defenses because of actions outside the
court proceedings.
Summary
Only extrinsic fraud can be used to set aside a divorce judgment through a
bill of review, which is a remedy available in Texas.
Vickery v. Vickery, 999 S.W.2d 342 (Tex. 1999)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
The supreme court has held that a fiduciary's concealment of material facts,
used to induce an agreed or uncontested judgment, that prevents a party
from presenting his legal right at trial, constitutes extrinsic fraud.
Montgomery, 669 S.W.2d at 313. Helen asserts Glenn concealed from her his
real reason for wanting a divorce, as well as the fact that June Wright
offered to settle her malpractice suit for policy limits before Helen signed
the divorce decree. We conclude the evidence is legally and factually
sufficient to support a finding of extrinsic fraud.
Summary
The passage from the Vickery v. Vickery case provides a clear definition of
what constitutes extrinsic fraud in Texas. It specifies that the concealment of
material facts by a fiduciary, which prevents a party from presenting their
legal rights at trial, is considered extrinsic fraud. This is directly relevant to
understanding what might constitute "fraud on the court" in a divorce

proceeding. The case also illustrates an example where such fraud was
found, providing a practical application of the legal principle.
Belz v. Belz, 667 S.W.2d 240 (Tex. App. 1984)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
In the context of a divorce and property division, fraud on the community is
a wrong by one spouse which the court may consider in its division of the
estate of the parties and which may justify an unequal division of the
property. Furthermore, as we have stated earlier in this opinion, the court
may render a personal judgment against one spouse in order to effect an
equitable distribution of the property and as a means to recoup for the
defrauded spouse the value of property lost from the estate, by reason of the
wrongful acts of the other spouse.
Summary
In Texas, "fraud on the community" in the context of divorce refers to
wrongful acts by one spouse that deplete the community estate. This is not a
separate cause of action but is considered during the division of property in
a divorce. The court may use this as a basis to justify an unequal division of
property or to render a personal judgment against the offending spouse to
recoup the value lost from the estate. This indicates that the remedy for
such fraud is primarily through the equitable division of property rather
than a standalone legal action.
Montgomery v. Kennedy, 669 S.W.2d 309 (Tex. 1984)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
In relation to attacks on final judgments, fraud is classified as either
extrinsic or intrinsic. Only extrinsic fraud will entitle petitioners to bill of
review relief. Alexander v. Hagedorn, Id. at 574, 226 S.W.2d at 1001. ... From
the earliest times, this court has written that, in the context of a fiduciary's
duty of full disclosure, in a suit to partition or divide assets, the fraudulent
concealment of an asset is extrinsic fraud that will justify a court in setting
aside its former judgment in an equitable proceeding. Wright v. Wright, 7
Tex. 526, 533-34 (1852).
Summary
The passage distinguishes between extrinsic and intrinsic fraud in the
context of attacking final judgments. It specifies that only extrinsic fraud,

=== PAGE 10 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
which is collateral to the matter tried and not an issue that could have been
litigated in the original action, can justify a bill of review to set aside a
judgment. The passage further clarifies that in the context of a fiduciary
relationship, such as in divorce proceedings involving asset division, the
fraudulent concealment of an asset is considered extrinsic fraud. This
provides a basis for setting aside a judgment if proven.
Marriage of DeVine, Matter of, 869 S.W.2d 415 (Tex. App. 1993)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
In the present case, the jury was instructed in accord with the following
pattern jury charges. A spouse commits [actual] fraud if that spouse
transfers community property or expends community funds for the primary
purpose of depriving the other spouse of the use and enjoyment of the assets
involved in the transaction. Such fraud involves dishonesty of purpose or an
intent to deceive. A relationship of confidence and trust exists between a
husband and wife with regard to that portion of the community property that
each controls. This relationship requires that the spouses use the utmost
good faith and frankness in their dealings with each other. Because of the
nature of the spousal relationship, conduct of a spouse affecting the
property rights of the other spouse may be fraudulent even though identical
conduct would not be fraudulent as between non-spouses. ... A presumption
of constructive fraud arises where one spouse disposes of the other spouse's
interest in community property without the other's knowledge or consent.
Mazique v. Mazique, 742 S.W.2d at 808; Jackson v. Smith, 703 S.W.2d 791,
795 (Tex.App.--Dallas 1985, no writ); Carnes v. Meador, 533 S.W.2d at 370.
The burden of proof then shifts to the disposing spouse to prove the fairness
of the disposition of the other spouse's one-half community ownership. ... We
know of no precedent in Texas for allowing one spouse to sue the other in
tort for common law fraud, as a separate cause of action, based upon a
depletion of the community estate prior to dissolution of the community
estate, either by divorce or the death of one of the spouses. Rather, a claim
of fraud on the community is a means to an end, either to recover specific
property wrongfully conveyed, to recover, after the death of the donor
spouse, from the donee the value of inter vivos gifts made by a spouse in
fraud of the other's rights, or, as here, to obtain a greater share of the
community estate upon divorce, in order to compensate the wronged spouse
for his or her lost interest in the community estate. In the context of a
divorce and property division, fraud on the community is a wrong by one
spouse which the court may consider in its division of the estate of the
parties and which may justify an unequal division of the property.
Summary
In Texas, "fraud on the community" in a divorce proceeding involves a
spouse transferring or expending community property with the intent to
deprive the other spouse of its use and enjoyment. This is considered

=== PAGE 11 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
fraudulent due to the trust and confidence inherent in the marital
relationship. A presumption of constructive fraud arises if one spouse
disposes of community property without the other's knowledge or consent,
shifting the burden of proof to the disposing spouse. Remedies for such
fraud include recovering wrongfully conveyed property or obtaining a
greater share of the community estate upon divorce to compensate for the
lost interest. The court may consider this fraud when dividing the estate,
potentially justifying an unequal division of property.
King Ranch, Inc. v. Chapman, 118 S.W.3d 742, 2003 WL 22025017 (Tex.
2003)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
Fraud in relation to attacks on final judgments is either extrinsic or intrinsic.
Only extrinsic fraud will support a bill of review. Tice v. City of Pasadena,
767 S.W.2d 700, 702 (Tex.1989). Extrinsic fraud is fraud that denied a party
the opportunity to fully litigate at trial all the rights or defenses that could
have been asserted. Id. Intrinsic fraud, by contrast, relates to the merits of
the issues that were presented and presumably were or should have been
settled in the former action. Id. Within that term are included such matters
as fraudulent instruments, perjured testimony, or any matter which was
actually presented to and considered by the trial court in rendering the
judgment assailed. Id. Such fraud will not support a bill of review, because
each party must guard against adverse findings on issues directly presented.
Id.; Alexander, 226 S.W.2d at 998.
Summary
In Texas, fraud on the court in the context of attacking final judgments is
categorized into extrinsic and intrinsic fraud. Extrinsic fraud, which
prevents a party from fully litigating their case, is the type that can support
a bill of review. Intrinsic fraud, which involves issues that were or should
have been addressed in the original trial, does not support a bill of review.
This distinction is crucial in determining the available remedies in legal
proceedings, such as divorce cases.
Cooper v. Cooper, 260 S.W. 679 (Tex. App. 1924)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
No provision is made under the statutes of Texas for a new trial after the
expiration of the term at which the judgment assailed was rendered. The law
has provided rules for new trials at the term at which a judgment is

rendered, and that legal remedy is lost by a party who has not availed
himself of it in the manner and at the time prescribed by law. When the term
ends the case is effectually ended, and there can be no such thing as
another trial at law, but under certain circumstances, such as where there
has been fraud and a person has been deprived of his rights, through no
fault of his own, but has used due diligence to preserve them, courts of
equity, in the due exercise of their discretionary powers, may grant relief by
re-examining the case upon its merits and rendering such aid as may be
proper and necessary to protect rights jeopardized by the judgment in the
court of law.
Summary
In Texas, once the term at which a judgment is rendered has expired, a new
trial cannot be granted under statutory law. However, if there has been
fraud that deprived a person of their rights, and they have used due
diligence to preserve those rights, courts of equity may intervene. This
intervention allows the court to re-examine the case on its merits and
provide necessary relief to protect the rights affected by the judgment. This
indicates that "fraud on the court" can be a basis for equitable relief even
after the statutory period for a new trial has expired.
Edwards v. Edwards, 651 S.W.2d 940 (Tex. App. 1983)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Texas law is clear that in order for this court to vacate the judgment the
husband must show 'extrinsic fraud', which is fraud in the means whereby
the wife procured the judgment below. The fraud complained of must be
perpetrated by the wife, operating to prevent the husband from knowing
about his defenses or from having a fair opportunity of presenting them
upon trial. Rylee v. McMorrough, 616 S.W.2d 649 (Tex.Civ.App.--Houston
[14th Dist.] 1981, no writ). Rylee requires a husband who wishes to
complain of fraud to show that there was no fault or negligence committed
by him, in connection with the other party's fraudulent act. The husband has
done so here.
Summary
Definition of "extrinsic fraud" in the context of Texas law, particularly in
divorce proceedings. It specifies that extrinsic fraud involves fraudulent
actions by one party that prevent the other party from knowing about their
defenses or having a fair opportunity to present them at trial. The passage
also references a requirement from a previous case, Rylee v. McMorrough,
which states that the complaining party must show that they were not at
fault or negligent in connection with the fraudulent act. This information is
directly relevant to understanding what constitutes "fraud on the court" in

Warne v. Jackson, 273 S.W. 315 (Tex. App. 1925)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
It has often, indeed, been declared by this court that the fraud which entitles
a party to impeach the judgment of one of our own tribunals must be fraud
extrinsic to the matter tried in the cause, and not merely consist in false and
fraudulent documents or testimony submitted to that tribunal, and the truth
of which was contested before it and passed upon by it.
Summary
For a party to successfully claim "fraud on the court" in Texas, the fraud
must be extrinsic to the matter tried. This means it must involve deception
that prevents a party from fully presenting their case, rather than simply
involving false testimony or documents that were already considered by the
court. The passage also implies that diligence in discovering the fraud is
necessary for setting aside a judgment. This suggests that if a party was
unable to discover the fraud despite reasonable efforts, they may have
grounds to seek relief.
Oliver v. Oliver, 889 S.W.2d 271 (Tex. 1994)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
The issue in this divorce case is whether the statute of limitations bars a
counterclaim for fraud. The trial court, disregarding the jury's finding of
fraud, rendered a take-nothing judgment on the counterclaim, and the court
of appeals affirmed... Thirty days later, Rita filed an answer and
counterclaim claiming that the 1979 divorce decree had been obtained
through fraud, misrepresentation, and breach of fiduciary duty. Rita sought
damages equal to her share of the community property that would have
been acquired while the couple resided in New Mexico absent the secret
divorce. In response, Sam asserted a statute of limitations defense. The jury
found that Sam had defrauded Rita as to their status as husband and wife,
awarding $500,000 to compensate Rita for this fraud.
Summary
The passage discusses a case where fraud was claimed in a divorce
proceeding, specifically that a divorce decree was obtained through fraud,

=== PAGE 14 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
misrepresentation, and breach of fiduciary duty. The jury found fraud and
awarded damages, but the trial court's judgment was influenced by the
statute of limitations. This indicates that fraud in divorce proceedings can
lead to claims for damages, but such claims may be subject to limitations
defenses.
In the Matter of the Marriage of Ham, 59 S.W.3d 326 (Tex. App. 2001)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The fraud alleged in a bill of review must be extrinsic and collateral to the
issues in the underlying action. See Alexander v. Hagedorn, 148 Tex. 565,
226 S.W.2d 996 (1950); 5 Roy W. McDonald & Elaine A. Carlson, Texas Civil
Practice § 29:14. Examples include preventing a party from attending court
by fraudulently failing to serve a defendant with personal service in order to
obtain judgment without actual notice, Forney v. Jorrie, 511 S.W.2d 379 (Tex.
Civ. App. San Antonio 1974, writ ref'd n.r.e.), and failing to disclose to the
court that a party is incompetent so a guardian ad litem could be appointed,
Miller v. Miller 487 S.W.2d 382 (Tex. Civ. App. Fort Worth 1972, writ ref'd
n.r.e.).
Summary
The passage provides examples of what constitutes "fraud on the court" in
Texas, specifically noting that the fraud must be extrinsic and collateral to
the issues in the underlying action. It cites specific cases where such fraud
was identified, such as failing to serve a defendant properly or not disclosing
a party's incompetence. This information is directly relevant to
understanding what constitutes fraud on the court in Texas.
Hill v. Steinberger, 827 S.W.2d 58 (Tex. App. 1992)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Rule 329b(f) of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure provides: 'On the
expiration of the time within which the trial court has plenary power, a
judgment cannot be set aside by the trial court except by bill of review for
sufficient cause, filed within the time allowed by law.' TEX.R.CIV.P. 329b(f).
Although the term 'sufficient cause' is not defined by the rules, the Texas
Supreme Court has set out what a petitioner must allege and prove in order
to invoke a bill of review and set aside a final judgment. The petitioner must
allege and prove: 1) a meritorious defense to the cause of action alleged to
support the judgment, 2) which she was prevented from making by the

=== PAGE 15 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
fraud, accident, or wrongful act of the opposing party, 3) unmixed with any
fault or negligence of her own.
Summary
In Texas, to set aside a final judgment due to "fraud on the court," a
petitioner must file a bill of review. The petitioner must demonstrate a
meritorious defense that was prevented by the opposing party's fraud,
accident, or wrongful act, without any fault or negligence on the petitioner's
part. This is applicable in various cases, including divorce proceedings,
where a final judgment is challenged.
Caldwell v. Quaid, 14-24-00071-CV (Tex. App. Jun 27, 2024)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Constructive fraud, by its nature, entailed appellant 'wrongfully deplet[ing]
the community estate of assets without [appellee]'s knowledge or consent.'
Boothe v. Boothe, 681 S.W.3d 916, 924 (Tex. App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2023,
no pet.). ... we find the analogy is not fitting as the remedy the trial court
carried out for constructive fraud (i.e., awarding appellee a correspondingly
greater share of the community estate) was meant to remedy the harm
appellant allegedly inflicted on appellee's rights. ... asserting 'fraud on the
community [occurred] is a means to an end,' such as to 'compensate the
wronged spouse for his or her lost interest in the community estate'.
Summary
Constructive fraud in Texas divorce proceedings involves the wrongful
depletion of community estate assets without the other spouse's knowledge
or consent. The remedy for such fraud is to compensate the wronged spouse
by awarding them a greater share of the community estate to address the
harm caused by the fraudulent actions. This aligns with the broader legal
principle of compensating a spouse for their lost interest in the community
estate due to fraud.
Ince v. Ince, 58 S.W.3d 187 (Tex. App. 2001)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Fraud, as it applies to attacks upon final judgment, may be either intrinsic or
extrinsic. Intrinsic fraud relates to issues that were presented and resolved-
or could have been resolved in the former action. Fraudulent instruments
and perjured testimony are considered intrinsic fraud because these are

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
matters presented to and considered by the court in the original proceeding.
Tice v. City of Pasadena, 767 S.W.2d 700, 702 (Tex. 1989). Extrinsic fraud, on
the other hand, is wrongful conduct practiced outside of the adversary trial
such as keeping a party away from court, making false promises of
compromise, denying a party knowledge of the suit that affects the manner
in which the judgment is procured. Alexander v. Hagedorn, 226 S.W.2d 996,
1002 (Tex. 1950). Only extrinsic fraud supports a bill of review. Tice, 767
S.W.2d at 702.
Summary
The passage distinguishes between intrinsic and extrinsic fraud in the
context of attacking final judgments in Texas. Intrinsic fraud involves issues
that were or could have been resolved in the original proceeding, such as
fraudulent instruments and perjured testimony. Extrinsic fraud involves
wrongful conduct outside the trial, such as preventing a party from
attending court or denying knowledge of the suit. Only extrinsic fraud can
support a bill of review, which is a remedy to challenge a final judgment.
Schnautz v. Stelfox, 235 S.W.2d 473 (Tex. Ct. App. 1950)
Texas Civil Court of Appeals
Extract
'Fraud is classified as intrinsic or extrinsic. Included in the term 'intrinsic
fraud' are false testimony, fraudulent instruments, and any fraudulent
matter that was presented and considered in rendering judgment. Intrinsic
fraud does not furnish a ground, in an independent suit brought for that
purpose, for setting aside a judgment. Fraud must be extrinsic to justify the
setting aside of a judgment, and must be collateral to the matter tried, and
not something which was actually or potentially in issue in the trial; unless
the presentation of such defense was prevented by fraud, accident, or act of
the opposing party, without fault or negligence of the party against whom
the judgment was rendered.'
Summary
The passage distinguishes between intrinsic and extrinsic fraud. Intrinsic
fraud involves false testimony or fraudulent documents that were considered
in the original judgment and does not provide grounds for setting aside a
judgment. Extrinsic fraud, however, is collateral to the matter tried and can
justify setting aside a judgment if it prevented the presentation of a defense
without fault or negligence of the party against whom the judgment was
rendered. This distinction is crucial in determining what constitutes "fraud
on the court" in Texas and the potential remedies available.
Boley v. Boley, 506 S.W.2d 934 (Tex. Ct. App. 1974)

=== PAGE 17 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Texas Civil Court of Appeals
Extract
A bill of review is an equitable remedy to set aside a judgment solemnly
rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction. It is not available unless a
party seeking such remedy brings himself within the narrow and unbending
requirements for such relief. ... In the first place, the fraud here portrayed is
intrinsic in kind rather than extrinsic... The rule supported by the
overwhelming weight of authority is that fraud as a ground for vacating a
judgment must be 'what is known as 'extrinsic' fraud, that is, fraud in the
means whereby the judgment was procured, and not fraud in the cause of
action or matter put in issue and presented for adjudication...'
Summary
In Texas, for a judgment to be set aside on the grounds of fraud, the fraud
must be "extrinsic" rather than "intrinsic." Extrinsic fraud refers to fraud
that affects the means by which the judgment was procured, rather than
fraud related to the issues presented in the case. The passage also mentions
that a bill of review is an equitable remedy available under narrow
conditions to set aside a judgment.
Biggs v. Biggs, 553 S.W.2d 207 (Tex. Ct. App. 1977)
Texas Civil Court of Appeals
Extract
A bill of review is an equitable proceeding in which the moving party must
allege and prove: (1) a meritorious defense to the cause of action alleged to
support the judgment, (2) which he was prevented from making by the
fraud, accident or wrongful act of the opposite party, (3) unmixed with any
fault or negligence of his own. Alexander v. Hagedorn, 148 Tex. 565, 568,
226 S.W.2d 996, 998 (1950). Only extrinsic fraud will entitle a complainant
to relief by bill of review. Intrinsic fraud does not furnish a ground for
setting aside a judgment in an independent suit brought for that purpose.
Alexander v. Hegedorn, 148 Tex. at 574, 226 S.W.2d at 1001.
Summary
Clear definition of what constitutes fraud that can be addressed by a bill of
review in Texas. It distinguishes between extrinsic fraud, which can be
grounds for a bill of review, and intrinsic fraud, which cannot. This
distinction is crucial in understanding what constitutes "fraud on the court"
in the context of Texas law. The passage also outlines the requirements for a
bill of review, which is a remedy available if extrinsic fraud is proven.

Summary
The passage distinguishes between intrinsic and extrinsic fraud. Intrinsic
fraud involves fraudulent actions that were part of the trial process, such as
false testimony or fraudulent documents, and does not provide grounds for
setting aside a judgment. Extrinsic fraud, on the other hand, is fraud that is
collateral to the trial and not directly related to the issues that were or could
have been addressed during the trial. For a judgment to be set aside due to
fraud, the fraud must be extrinsic, meaning it prevented a fair trial by
keeping a party from presenting their case, without any fault or negligence
on their part.

Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
I am further convinced that the fraud complained of by appellee is of the
intrinsic variety and not extrinsic in nature. In order to vacate the divorce
judgment for fraud practiced by appellant, appellee was required to allege
such particularized conduct on the part of appellant as prevented appellee
either from knowing about her rights or defense, or from obtaining a fair
opportunity to present them at a trial. If the conduct alleged to be fraud
consisted of any matter which was actually presented to and considered by
the trial court in rendering the judgment under attack, such fraud, if it be
fraud, is intrinsic and not extrinsic. Alexander v. Hagedorn, 226 S.W.2d at
1001. Appellee was not prevented from presenting her side of the case at
the hearing. She in fact participated by agreement and should not now be
permitted to claim otherwise.
Summary
To vacate a judgment based on fraud, the fraud must be extrinsic, meaning
it must have prevented the party from knowing their rights or having a fair
opportunity to present their case. In this case, the court found that the
alleged fraud was intrinsic because the appellee was not prevented from
participating in the trial.
In re Marriage of Notash, 118 S.W.3d 868 (Tex. App. 2003)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Further, the Texas Supreme Court has held that, because fraud on the
community is not a tort independent of the divorce, exemplary damages
could not be awarded. Schlueter, 975 S.W.2d at 588. Therefore, no
exemplary damages can be recovered because no independent tort was
proven, no actual damages due to an independent tort exist, and fraud on
the community is not an independent tort.
Summary
In Texas, "fraud on the community" is not considered an independent tort
separate from the divorce itself. As a result, exemplary damages, which are
typically awarded in cases of torts, cannot be recovered in cases of fraud on
the community because it does not constitute an independent tort. This
suggests that while fraud on the community may be recognized, the
remedies available are limited, particularly in terms of punitive damages.

In re Penafiel, 633 S.W.3d 36 (Tex. App. 2021)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
We affirm the portions of the trial court's judgment granting the divorce and
Lisa's name change. We further affirm the holdings that Alejandro
fraudulently induced Lisa into signing the MSA and committed fraud against
the community estate and as to the value of the community estate. And we
affirm the awards to Lisa of litigation expenses as sanctions and of
attorney's fees. We reverse the portions of the judgment that purported to
enforce the MSA and otherwise divide the parties’ marital assets and
liabilities and that awarded Lisa a money judgment for fraudulent
inducement. We remand for entry of a new final decree in accordance with
this opinion.
Summary
The passage from "In re Penafiel" provides insight into how fraud,
specifically fraudulent inducement, is treated in the context of divorce
proceedings in Texas. The court found that Alejandro fraudulently induced
Lisa into signing the MSA and committed fraud against the community
estate. As a remedy, the court affirmed the award of litigation expenses and
attorney's fees to Lisa as sanctions. The court also reversed the enforcement
of the MSA and the division of marital assets and liabilities, remanding for a
new final decree. This indicates that fraud on the court in Texas can lead to
the invalidation of agreements like MSAs and the awarding of sanctions and
attorney's fees.
Rathmell v. Morrison, 732 S.W.2d 6 (Tex. App. 1987)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Only extrinsic fraud will entitle a complainant to relief because it is a
wrongful act committed 'by the other party to the suit which has prevented
the losing party either from knowing about his rights or defenses, or from
having a fair opportunity of presenting them upon the trial. Such, for
instance, as where he has been misled by his adversary by fraud or
deception, did not know of the suit, or was betrayed by his attorney. In other
words, fraud which denied him the opportunity to fully litigate upon the trial
all the rights or defenses he was entitled to assert. 'Intrinsic fraud' in the
procurement of a judgment is not ground, however, for vacating such
judgment in an independent suit brought for that purpose. And within that
term is included such matters as fraudulent instruments, perjured testimony,
or any matter which was actually presented to and considered by the trial
court in rendering the judgment assailed.'

Tice v. City of Pasadena, 767 S.W.2d 700 (Tex. 1989)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
Fraud in its relation to attacks on final judgments is either extrinsic or
intrinsic. Only extrinsic fraud will support a bill of review. 'Extrinsic fraud' is
fraud which denied a party the opportunity to fully litigate upon the trial all
the rights or defenses he was entitled to assert. 'Intrinsic fraud,' by contrast,
relates to the merits of the issues which were presented and presumably
were or should have been settled in the former action. Within that term are
included such matters as fraudulent instruments, perjured testimony, or any
matter which was actually presented to and considered by the trial court in
rendering the judgment assailed. Such fraud will not support a bill of review,
for each party must guard against adverse findings upon issues directly
presented.
Summary
The passage distinguishes between extrinsic and intrinsic fraud in the
context of attacking final judgments. Extrinsic fraud, which prevents a party
from fully litigating their case, can support a bill of review. Intrinsic fraud,
involving issues like perjured testimony that were considered by the court,
cannot support a bill of review. This distinction is crucial in understanding
what constitutes "fraud on the court" in Texas and the available remedies,
such as a bill of review, which is only applicable in cases of extrinsic fraud.
Rylee v. McMorrough, 616 S.W.2d 649 (Tex. Ct. App. 1981)
Texas Civil Court of Appeals

In order to vacate the judgment appellant must show extrinsic fraud, which
is fraud in the means whereby the judgment was procured, and not fraud in
the cause of action or matter put in issue and presented for adjudication. By
that is meant fraud by the other party which has prevented the losing party
either from knowing about his rights or defenses, or from having a fair
opportunity of presenting them upon trial. Examples include cases where
one did not know of the suit or was betrayed by his attorney. State v. Wright,
56 S.W.2d 950 (Tex.Civ.App. Austin 1933, no writ). The fraud must be

collateral to the matter tried, and not something which was actually or
potentially in issue in the trial.
Summary
"fraud on the court" in Texas requires showing extrinsic fraud. This type of
fraud involves deception in the process of obtaining the judgment, not in the
underlying issues of the case. It includes actions by the opposing party that
prevent the losing party from being aware of their rights or defenses or from
having a fair chance to present them at trial. The fraud must be external to
the issues tried in court. This understanding is crucial for determining
whether a judgment can be vacated due to fraud.

It is well settled that before a litigant can successfully invoke a bill of review
to set aside a final judgment, he must allege and prove: (1) a meritorious
defense to the cause of action alleged to support the judgment; (2) which he
was prevented from making by the fraud, accident or wrongful act of the
opposite party; (3) unmixed with any fault or negligence of his own. Ivy v.

such as fraud which denied the losing party the opportunity to fully litigate
upon the trial all the rights or defenses he was entitled to assert will entitle
a complainant to relief by bill of review.
Summary
Requirements for a litigant to successfully invoke a bill of review to set aside
a final judgment in Texas. It specifies that the fraud must be extrinsic,
meaning it must have denied the losing party the opportunity to fully litigate
their rights or defenses. This is relevant to understanding what constitutes
"fraud on the court" in Texas, as it highlights the type of fraud that can lead
to setting aside a judgment. The passage also references specific cases that
establish this legal standard, indicating its general applicability in Texas law.

constructive fraud. Givens v. Girard Life Insurance Company of America, 480
S.W.2d 421, 425 (Tex.Civ.App.--Dallas 1972, writ ref&#39;d n.r.e.).
Constructive fraud is the breach of a legal or equitable duty which violates a
fiduciary relationship, as exists between spouses. A presumption of
constructive fraud arises where one spouse disposes of the other
spouse&#39;s one-half interest in community property without the
other&#39;s knowledge or consent. See Redfearn v. Ford, 579 S.W.2d 295,
296-97 (Tex.Civ.App.--Dallas 1979, writ ref&#39;d n.r.e.).
Summary
"fraud on the community" or "fraud on the spouse" is a concept based on
constructive fraud, which involves a breach of a fiduciary duty between
spouses. This breach occurs when one spouse disposes of the other's
interest in community property without consent, leading to a presumption of
constructive fraud. This concept is relevant in divorce proceedings where
such actions may be contested.
Loaiza v. Loaiza, 130 S.W.3d 894 (Tex. App. 2004)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The Texas Supreme Court reversed, holding that one spouse's fraud on the
community estate could justify an unequal division of the estate but that
there is no independent tort cause of action for wrongful disposition of
community assets by a spouse. 975 S.W.2d at 589-90. A presumption of
constructive fraud arises where one spouse breaches the fiduciary duty
owed to the other spouse and disposes of the other spouse's one-half
interest in community property without the other's knowledge or consent.
Zieba, 928 S.W.2d at 789; Jackson v. Smith, 703 S.W.2d 791, 795 (Tex.App.-

disposing spouse to show fairness in disposing of community assets. Zieba,

(Tex.Civ.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 1975, writ dism'd).
Summary
The passage provides insight into what constitutes fraud on the community
estate in Texas. It explains that a presumption of constructive fraud arises
when one spouse breaches their fiduciary duty by disposing of community
property without the other spouse's knowledge or consent. This presumption
shifts the burden of proof to the disposing spouse to demonstrate the
fairness of the transaction. The Texas Supreme Court has held that such
fraud can justify an unequal division of the community estate, but it does not
create an independent tort cause of action.

273 S.W. 296 Markum v. Markum
Extract
Appellee alleged that the property was paid for with funds belonging to said
community estate, and that the recital in question was (quoted from his
answer) 'the result of fraud and deceit practiced by the plaintiff upon * * *
this defendant, and that, but for such fraud and deceit on the part of the
plaintiff, said deed would not have been drawn so as to vest the title in the
plaintiff for her sole and separate estate, and so as to deprive this defendant
of his community interest therein.' And he alleged, further, that he 'had no
knowledge of the recitals in said deed making the said lot the separate
property of plaintiff,' and 'in good faith believed that the said lot was
community property and, so believing, paid the entire consideration for said
lot out of community funds.' The specific 'fraud and deceit' charged against
appellant consisted, it seems, of the fact, as alleged, that appellant, without
appellee's knowledge or consent, induced one Bolanz to have one Murphy
(who wrote the deed) to include the recital in question in it by 'falsely and
fraudulently' representing that he (appellee) had agreed the deed should be
so drawn.
Summary
N example of what might constitute "fraud on the court" in a divorce
proceeding in Texas. It describes a situation where one party allegedly
committed fraud by misrepresenting facts to obtain a deed that falsely
indicated separate ownership of property, thereby depriving the other party
of their community interest. This case illustrates how fraud can be alleged in
the context of property division in divorce and the type of evidence that
might be considered by the court.

FRCP 60(d) gives courts authority to 'set aside a judgment for fraud on the
court.' FRCP 60(d). This 'inherent power... allows a federal court to vacate
its own judgment upon proof that a fraud has been perpetrated upon the
court.' Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U.S. 32, 44. The Rule 60(c) time
limitations do not apply to a 'fraud on the court' claim. United States v.
Sierra Pac. Indus., 100 F.Supp.3d 948, 954 (E.D. Cal. 2015), aff'd sub nom.
United States v. Sierra Pac. Indus., Inc., 862 F.3d 1157 (9th Cir. 2017); FRCP
60(c), (d). ... involve a 'deliberately planned and carefully executed scheme
to defraud' the court. Hazel-Atlas, 322 U.S. at 245; Great Coastal Exp., Inc. v.
Int'l Bhd. of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen & Helpers of Am., 675 F.
2d 1349, 1356 (4th Cir. 1982). Proving such fraud requires meeting a high
but narrow bar. Fox, 739 F.3d at 136; Great Coastal, 675 F.2d at 1356. The
relevant inquiry is whether there has been a harm to the integrity of the
judicial process. Sierra Pac. Indus., 100 F.Supp.3d at 955-956.
Summary
"fraud on the court" involves a deliberately planned and carefully executed
scheme to defraud the court, which harms the integrity of the judicial
process. The passage also indicates that federal courts have the inherent
power to set aside judgments if such fraud is proven, and this power is not
constrained by typical time limitations. While the passage is from a federal
context, Texas courts may consider similar principles when addressing
"fraud on the court" in divorce proceedings.
