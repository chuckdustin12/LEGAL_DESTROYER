Question
Charles was evicted from his home, deprived of marital funds, and removed
from his business as a direct result of the defendants' coordinated actions.
To have standing under RICO (18 U.S.C. § 1964(c)), a plaintiff must show
injury to business or property proximately caused by the RICO violation.
Charles's eviction, loss of funds, and removal from his business constitute
compensable injuries under RICO, giving him standing to bring a claim.
Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
Charles has standing under RICO based on the injuries described, as
eviction from his home, deprivation of marital funds, and removal from his
business constitute injuries to "business or property" within the meaning of 
18 U.S.C. § 1964(c). These injuries, if proximately caused by the defendants'
coordinated actions that violated RICO, satisfy the standing requirements
for bringing a civil RICO claim.
Summary
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) provides a
civil remedy under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c) for "[a]ny person injured in his
business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962." To establish
standing under this provision, a plaintiff must demonstrate three elements:
(1) a violation of RICO under § 1962, (2) an injury to the plaintiff's business
or property, and (3) that the RICO violation proximately caused the injury.
The injuries Charles has suffered—eviction from his home, deprivation of
marital funds, and removal from his business—qualify as injuries to
"business or property" within the meaning of the statute.
Courts have consistently interpreted "injury to business or property" to
include concrete financial losses and deprivation of property use, which
aligns with Charles's situation. His eviction represents a loss of property
use, the deprivation of marital funds constitutes a direct financial injury, and
his removal from his business implicates both loss of property rights and
business interests. Provided that Charles can establish that these injuries
were proximately caused by the defendants' pattern of racketeering activity
in violation of § 1962, he has standing to bring a civil RICO claim and seek
the remedies available under § 1964(c), including treble damages and
attorney's fees.

Background and Relevant Law
Statutory Framework
The civil remedies provision of RICO, 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c), provides the legal
foundation for private individuals to bring claims under the statute.
According to the most current version of this provision:
"Any person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of
section 1962 of this chapter may sue therefor in any appropriate United
States district court and shall recover threefold the damages he sustains and
the cost of the suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee..." 18 U.S.C. §
1964(c) (2025).
This provision creates a private right of action for individuals who have
suffered injury to their business or property as a result of a RICO violation,
allowing them to recover treble damages and attorney's fees.
Requirements for Civil RICO Standing
Elements of Standing Under § 1964(c)
Multiple judicial decisions and secondary sources consistently articulate
three elements required for civil RICO standing:
A violation of § 1962
Injury to business or property
Proximate causation between the violation and the injury
As stated in Hellenic Petroleum LLC v. Mansfield Oil Co. of Gainesville, Inc.,
No. 1:19-cv-01071-DAD-SKO (E.D. Cal. Jan 28, 2020): "To have standing
under § 1964(c), a plaintiff must allege: (i) 'that his alleged harm qualifies as
injury to his business or property;' and (ii) 'that his harm was 'by reason of'
the RICO violation, which requires the plaintiff to establish proximate
causation.'"
Similarly, Planned Parenthood Fed'n of Am., Inc. v. Ctr. for Med. Progress,
214 F.Supp.3d 808 (N.D. Cal. 2016) specifies: "The elements of a RICO claim
are: (i) the conduct of (ii) an enterprise that affects interstate commerce (iii)
through a pattern (iv) of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful
debt... In addition, the conduct must be the proximate cause of harm to the
victim. Under § 1964(c), plaintiffs must also allege that they have been
injured in their 'property or business' by reason of the alleged racketeering
activities."
These requirements are further reinforced by Pappas v. Passias, 887 F.Supp.
465 (E.D. N.Y. 1995), which explains that "the injury complained of must be
to business or property, and moreover, such business or property must
belong to the plaintiff." The court also emphasized that "a plaintiff must
demonstrate 'proximate causation' in order to recover under RICO; that is to
1. 
2. 
3. 

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
say, the plaintiff must establish that the relationship between the
defendants' conduct and the injury claimed is not too remote."
Injury to "Business or Property" Requirement
Courts have interpreted the phrase "business or property" to require
concrete financial losses or deprivations of property use. According to Diaz
v. Gates, 420 F.3d 897 (9th Cir. 2005): "The only requirement for RICO
standing is that one be a 'person injured in his business or property by
reason of a violation of section 1962.'" The court further clarifies that "for a
complaint to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, the plaintiff
must allege not only a section 1962 violation but also that he was 'injured in
his business or property.'"
The Supreme Court in Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corporation,
503 U.S. 258, 112 S.Ct. 1311, 117 L.Ed.2d 532 (1992) stated that "a RICO
plaintiff 'only has standing if, and can only recover to the extent that, he has
been injured in his business or property by [reason of] the conduct
constituting the violation.'" It's important to note that Holmes was stated as
vacated by State v. Swafford, 654 S.E.2d 297, 375 S.C. 637 (S.C. App. 2007).
However, this subsequent treatment does not directly impact the specific
holding regarding RICO standing requirements, as the vacatur relates to
other aspects of the case and was issued by a state appellate court, which
does not override U.S. Supreme Court precedent on federal law matters.
The secondary source "Defending RICO Claims In The Business Context Part
II: RICO Claims Must Allege Injury To Business Or Property" (2022) provides
additional clarity on what constitutes an injury to business or property:
"Indeed, most courts have construed them narrowly to mean that there must
be a pecuniary injury to a proprietary interest, and thus a plaintiff must
show some sort of concrete financial loss. In addition, the injury must be
ascertainable and definable, such as when a plaintiff is deprived of the
ability to use or transfer property."
This source further elaborates that courts have found sufficient injuries in
cases involving "lost profits, excessive interest charges, property damage
and interference with business, such as decreased business profits or
increased costs of doing business." These examples are particularly relevant
to Charles's situation, as his removal from his business could result in lost
profits and his eviction represents a deprivation of his ability to use
property.
Proximate Causation Requirement
For a RICO claim to proceed, the plaintiff must demonstrate that their
injuries were proximately caused by the RICO violation. The Supreme Court
in Anza v. Ideal Steel Supply Corp., 126 S.Ct. 1991, 164 L.Ed.2d 720, 547
U.S. 451 (2006) confirmed that § 1964(c) "broadly authorize[s] suit by '[a]ny
person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section
1962.'" However, courts have consistently interpreted the "by reason of"
language to require proximate causation.

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
As Livingston Downs Racing Ass'n v. Jefferson Downs, 192 F.Supp.2d 519
(M.D. La. 2001) explains: "To establish standing under § 1964(c), a plaintiff
must show (1) a violation of § 1962, (2) an injury to his business or property,
and (3) that his injury was proximately caused by a RICO violation."
The secondary source "Racketeer influenced and corrupt
organizations" (2008) reinforces this point: "a plaintiff must prove that the
defendant's violation of [section] 1962 was the proximate cause of the
plaintiff's injury to have standing for a civil RICO action."
Analysis of Charles's Standing Under RICO
Qualification of Charles's Injuries as "Injury to Business or
Property"
To determine whether Charles has standing under RICO, we must first
assess whether his alleged injuries—eviction from his home, deprivation of
marital funds, and removal from his business—qualify as injuries to
"business or property" under § 1964(c).
Eviction from Home
Charles's eviction from his home constitutes an injury to property within the
meaning of § 1964(c). The secondary source "Defending RICO Claims In The
Business Context Part II: RICO Claims Must Allege Injury To Business Or
Property" (2022) notes that an injury to property includes instances "when a
plaintiff is deprived of the ability to use or transfer property." Eviction
directly deprives Charles of the ability to use his home, which is a clear
property interest.
This interpretation aligns with "Chapter 3. Standing", which states that "A
civil RICO plaintiff must have suffered concrete financial loss. Speculative,
amorphous, attenuated, or intangible loss will not do... The requirement that
the injury be to the plaintiff's business or property means that the plaintiff
must show a proprietary type of damage." Eviction represents a concrete,
proprietary type of damage to Charles's interest in his home.
Deprivation of Marital Funds
The deprivation of marital funds constitutes a direct financial injury to
Charles's property. Courts have consistently recognized that financial losses
qualify as injuries to property under RICO. As noted in Ashland Oil, Inc. v.
Arnett, 875 F.2d 1271 (7th Cir. 1989), where the plaintiffs' injury was "direct
and substantial" when they were deprived of the value of fuel or its
proceeds, the same principle applies to Charles's situation with respect to
his marital funds.
The secondary source "Chapter 3. Standing" confirms that "a civil RICO
plaintiff must have suffered concrete financial loss," which Charles has
experienced through the deprivation of marital funds. This financial loss is
precisely the type of injury that § 1964(c) was designed to remedy.

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Removal from Business
Charles's removal from his business constitutes an injury to both his
business and property interests under § 1964(c). The Seventh Circuit in 
Ashland Oil, Inc. v. Arnett, 875 F.2d 1271 (7th Cir. 1989) recognized that
conduct that exploits business procedures and diverts business assets
causes "direct and substantial" injury that qualifies under § 1964(c).
Additionally, "Defending RICO Claims In The Business Context Part II: RICO
Claims Must Allege Injury To Business Or Property" (2022) specifically
mentions that "courts have determined that a plaintiff's alleged injuries were
sufficient in cases involving... interference with business, such as decreased
business profits or increased costs of doing business." Being removed from
his business would likely result in decreased business profits for Charles,
qualifying as an injury to his business under RICO.
Proximate Causation Analysis
For Charles to have standing, his injuries must have been proximately
caused by the defendants' alleged RICO violations. According to "Racketeer
influenced and corrupt organizations" (2023), "Standing for a civil cause of
action under RICO is established when a plaintiff shows: (i) any violation of §
1962; (ii) injury to the plaintiff's business or property; and (iii) the statutory
violation caused the injury."
The facts state that Charles's injuries were "a direct result of the
defendants' coordinated actions." If these coordinated actions constitute a
pattern of racketeering activity in violation of § 1962, then the proximate
causation requirement would be satisfied.
The standard for proximate causation in RICO cases was addressed by the
Supreme Court in Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corporation, 503
U.S. 258, 112 S.Ct. 1311, 117 L.Ed.2d 532 (1992), which held that there
must be a direct relationship between the injury and the alleged RICO
violation. While this case was stated as vacated by State v. Swafford, 654
S.E.2d 297, 375 S.C. 637 (S.C. App. 2007), the vacatur by a state court does
not override the Supreme Court's interpretation of federal law. Moreover,
the principle of proximate causation in RICO cases has been consistently
upheld by other courts.
Application to Charles's Case
Based on the statutory language of § 1964(c) and its judicial interpretation,
Charles appears to have standing to bring a RICO claim. His eviction,
deprivation of marital funds, and removal from his business qualify as
injuries to business or property. If these injuries were proximately caused by
the defendants' coordinated actions in violation of § 1962, Charles would
satisfy all three requirements for RICO standing:
A violation of § 1962 (assuming the defendants' actions constitute a
pattern of racketeering activity)
1. 

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Injury to business or property (eviction, loss of funds, removal from
business)
Proximate causation between the violation and the injury (the injuries
were "a direct result" of the defendants' actions)
As "PAYORS, PLAYERS, AND PROXIMATE CAUSE." (2022) notes, "as long as
the plaintiff was injured--regardless of the type--by the defendant's
racketeering activity, that plaintiff's claim does not fail for lack of a
'racketeering injury.'" This principle supports Charles's standing to bring a
RICO claim based on his various injuries.
Potential Challenges and Counterarguments
Nature of the Injuries
While Charles's injuries appear to qualify as injuries to business or property,
potential counterarguments could arise regarding their characterization:
Eviction from Home: Opponents might argue that eviction is a
personal injury rather than a property injury. However, "Defending
RICO Claims In The Business Context Part II: RICO Claims Must Allege
Injury To Business Or Property" (2022) clarifies that deprivation of the
ability to use property constitutes an injury to property. Eviction clearly
deprives Charles of the ability to use his home.
Marital Funds: Questions might arise about Charles's legal interest in
the marital funds. However, if Charles had a legal right to these funds
under applicable family law, their deprivation would constitute an
injury to his property interest.
Removal from Business: Depending on the nature of Charles's
involvement in the business (owner, partner, employee), different legal
standards might apply. However, Ashland Oil, Inc. v. Arnett, 875 F.2d
1271 (7th Cir. 1989) suggests that interference with business interests
generally qualifies as an injury under RICO.
Proximate Causation Challenges
Defendants might challenge the proximate causation element by arguing
that the link between their actions and Charles's injuries is too attenuated.
However, the fact pattern states that the injuries were "a direct result" of
the defendants' coordinated actions, which suggests a direct causal
relationship that would satisfy the proximate causation requirement
established in cases like Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection
Corporation, 503 U.S. 258 (1992).
Conclusion
Based on the statutory language of 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c) and its judicial
interpretation, Charles has standing to bring a civil RICO claim. His eviction
from his home, deprivation of marital funds, and removal from his business
2.

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
constitute injuries to business or property within the meaning of the statute.
Assuming these injuries were proximately caused by the defendants'
coordinated actions that violated § 1962, Charles satisfies all three
requirements for RICO standing.
The phrase "Any person injured in his business or property by reason of a
violation of section 1962" in 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c) (2025) has been consistently
interpreted by courts to encompass concrete financial losses and
deprivations of property use. Charles's injuries fall squarely within this
interpretation, as they involve financial loss (marital funds), deprivation of
property use (eviction), and interference with business interests (removal
from business).
Furthermore, the direct causal relationship between the defendants' actions
and Charles's injuries, as indicated by the phrase "direct result," likely
satisfies the proximate causation requirement that courts have read into the
"by reason of" language in § 1964(c).
In conclusion, Charles's eviction from his home, deprivation of marital funds,
and removal from his business constitute compensable injuries under RICO,
giving him standing to bring a claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c).
Legal Authorities
Ashland Oil, Inc. v. Arnett, 875 F.2d 1271 (7th Cir. 1989)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Seventh Circuit
Extract
Section 1964(c) permits any person injured in his or her business or
property by reason of a violation of Sec. 1962(c) to recover treble damages.
Plaintiffs here seem plainly qualified to sue under Sec. 1964(c). They
pleaded, and the jury found, that the Arnett brothers conducted the affairs
of Arnett Oil through a pattern of racketeering activity. The fraudulent
scheme alleged in Count II involved exploiting the plaintiffs' sales and billing
procedures so that Arnett Oil could rapidly obtain unusually large quantities
of the plaintiffs' property, and then diverting that fuel or its proceeds,
making worthless Arnett Oils' obligations to pay the plaintiffs for the fuel
taken. The plaintiffs' injury from such conduct of the enterprise was direct
and substantial.
Summary
Requirements for standing under RICO, specifically under 18 U.S.C. §
1964(c), which allows individuals injured in their business or property by a
RICO violation to recover damages. The court found that the plaintiffs in the
case had standing because they suffered direct and substantial injuries due
to the defendants' racketeering activities. This supports the proposition that
Charles, having suffered similar injuries (eviction, loss of funds, and removal
from his business), would have standing under RICO.

Diaz v. Gates, 420 F.3d 897 (9th Cir. 2005)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Ninth Circuit
Extract
The only requirement for RICO standing is that one be a 'person injured in
his business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962.' 18 U.S.C. §
1964(c). ... For a complaint to state a claim upon which relief can be
granted, the plaintiff must allege not only a section 1962 violation but also
that he was 'injured in his business or property.' ... The Racketeer Influenced
and Corrupt Organizations Act ('RICO'), 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961-68, provides a
civil remedy of treble damages to '[a]ny person injured in his business or
property by reason of a violation of section 1962 of this chapter.' Id. at §
1964(c). See Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479, 496, 105 S.Ct.
3275, 87 L.Ed.2d 346 (1985) ('[T]he plaintiff only has standing if, and can
only recover to the extent that, he has been injured in his business or
property by the conduct constituting the violation.').
Summary
The statute requires a direct injury to business or property, not merely
personal injuries with financial consequences. This supports the proposition
that Charles's eviction, loss of funds, and removal from his business, if
directly caused by the defendants' actions, could constitute compensable
injuries under RICO, thus giving him standing to bring a claim.

U.S. District Court — Middle District of Louisiana
Extract
To establish standing under § 1964(c), a plaintiff must show (1) a violation of
§ 1962, (2) an injury to his business or property, and (3) that his injury was
proximately caused by a RICO violation. See Holmes v. Securities Investor
Protection Corp., 503 U.S. 258, 112 S.Ct. 1311, 117 L.Ed.2d 532 (1992);
Cullom v. Hibernia Nat'l Bank, 859 F.2d 1211, 1214 (5th Cir.1988). The
Court concludes that LDRA has established an injury to its business or
property sufficient to confer standing.
Summary
To have standing under RICO, a plaintiff must demonstrate a violation of §
1962, an injury to business or property, and that the injury was proximately
caused by the RICO violation. The court in this case found that LDRA had
established an injury to its business or property, which is a requirement for

City of New York v. Smokes-Spirits.Com, Inc., 541 F.3d 425 (2nd Cir. 2008)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Second Circuit
Extract
Thus, under § 1964(c), a civil RICO claimant must show: (1) a substantive
RICO violation under § 1962; (2) injury to the plaintiff's 'business or
property,' and (3) that such injury was 'by reason of' the substantive RICO
violation. ... 'the plaintiff only has standing if, and can only recover to the
extent that, he has been injured in his business or property by the conduct
constituting the [RICO] violation.' ... 'the compensable injury necessarily is
the harm caused by [alleged] predicate acts. . ., for the essence of the
violation is the commission of those acts in connection with the conduct of
an enterprise.'
Summary
Requirements for a civil RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c), which
include showing a substantive RICO violation, an injury to business or
property, and causation of the injury by the RICO violation. The passage
emphasizes that the injury must be directly caused by the predicate acts of
the RICO violation. This supports the proposition that Charles's eviction, loss
of funds, and removal from his business, if directly caused by the
defendants' RICO violation, would constitute compensable injuries under
RICO, thus giving him standing to bring a claim.

Summary
Elements required for a RICO claim, emphasizing the need for the conduct
to be the proximate cause of harm and for the plaintiff to show injury to
business or property. This directly supports the proposition that Charles's
eviction, loss of funds, and removal from his business, if proximately caused
by the defendants' actions, would constitute compensable injuries under
RICO, thus giving him standing to bring a claim.

against such a RICO violator.
Summary
The passage from the Supreme Court decision clarifies that RICO's civil
action provision allows any person injured in their business or property due
to a RICO violation to bring a suit. This supports the proposition that
Charles, having suffered eviction, loss of funds, and removal from his
business, has standing under RICO if these injuries were proximately caused
by the defendants' coordinated actions.

U.S. District Court — Eastern District of New York
Extract
With regard to the second element, the injury complained of must be to
business or property, and moreover, such business or property must belong
to the plaintiff. See 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c) (providing a cause of action to 'any
person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section
1962') (emphasis added). ... The third element, which requires the plaintiff
to allege that the violation of § 1962 caused his injury, overlaps to some
extent with the second. ... Rather, a plaintiff must demonstrate 'proximate
causation' in order to recover under RICO; that is to say, the plaintiff must
establish that the relationship between the defendants' conduct and the
injury claimed is not too remote.
Summary
The injury must belong to the plaintiff and that proximate causation is
necessary, meaning the injury must be a direct result of the defendants'
conduct. This supports the proposition that Charles's eviction, loss of funds,
and removal from his business, if directly caused by the defendants' actions,
would constitute compensable injuries under RICO.

Extract
To have standing under § 1964(c), a plaintiff must allege: (i) 'that his alleged

was 'by reason of' the RICO violation, which requires the plaintiff to
establish proximate causation.' ... In a RICO action, 'the plaintiff only has
standing if, and can only recover to the extent that, he has been injured in
his business or property by the conduct constituting the violation'.
Summary
Necessity of showing both the injury and the causation link to the RICO
violation, which aligns with the proposition that Charles's eviction, loss of

This directly supports the proposition that Charles's eviction, loss of funds,
and removal from his business, if caused by the defendants' RICO violations,
would give him standing to bring a RICO claim.

Extract
To have standing for a civil cause of action under RICO, a plaintiff must
show: (i) a violation of [section] 1962(a), (b), (c), or (d); (ii) injury to her
business or property; and (iii) causation of the injury by the violation. ... To
sue for a violation of [section] 1962(c), a plaintiff must have suffered an
injury to business or property caused by one of the predicate acts of
racketeering. ... Moreover, a plaintiff must prove that the defendant's
violation of [section] 1962 was the proximate cause of the plaintiff's injury to
have standing for a civil RICO action.
Summary
Requirements for a plaintiff to have standing under RICO, which include
showing a violation of specific sections of RICO, an injury to business or
property, and causation of the injury by the violation. The passage
specifically mentions that for a violation of section 1962(c), the injury must
be caused by one of the predicate acts of racketeering. This supports the
proposition that Charles's eviction, loss of funds, and removal from his
business, if caused by predicate acts of racketeering, would constitute
compensable injuries under RICO, giving him standing to bring a claim.

Summary
For a plaintiff to have standing under RICO, they must demonstrate an injury
to business or property that is directly caused by a violation of RICO's
provisions. The passage specifically mentions that the injury must be caused
by one of the predicate acts of racketeering, which aligns with the
proposition that Charles's injuries (eviction, loss of funds, and removal from
his business) are compensable under RICO if they were caused by such acts.

(299)... a plaintiff must prove that the defendant's violation of [section] 1962
was the proximate cause of the plaintiff's injury to have standing for a civil
RICO action. (310)... Second, the Court established that plaintiff has a claim
under [section] 1964(c) if defendant engaged in a pattern of racketeering
activity in a manner forbidden by [section] 1962 and such activity injured
plaintiff in his business or property. Id. at 495.
Summary
Requirements for standing in a civil RICO action, which include showing a
violation of RICO provisions, an injury to business or property, and that the
injury was proximately caused by the RICO violation. The passage also
clarifies that a compensable injury under RICO is the harm caused by the
predicate acts of racketeering. This directly supports the proposition that
Charles's eviction, loss of funds, and removal from his business, if caused by
the defendants' racketeering activities, would constitute compensable
injuries under RICO, giving him standing to bring a claim.

Extract
Standing for a civil cause of action under RICO is established when a
plaintiff shows: (i) any violation of § 1962; (ii) injury to the plaintiff’s
business or property; and (iii) the statutory violation caused the injury. ... A

eviction, loss of funds, and removal from his business as injuries to his
business or property.

Extract
A private civil right of action in [section] 1964 provides that '[a]ny person
injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962...
may sue.' (36) Notably, a successful plaintiff under [section] 1964 is entitled
to treble damages and the cost of the suit, including attorney fees. (37) ...

Section 1964(c)'s language does not call for a plaintiff to allege a particular
'racketeering injury' as an element to state a claim. (54) Unlike the
requirements for alleging an 'antitrust' injury under the Clayton Act, for
RICO, as long as the plaintiff was injured--regardless of the type--by the
defendant's racketeering activity, that plaintiff's claim does not fail for lack
of a 'racketeering injury.' (55)
Summary
There is no requirement for a specific type of "racketeering injury," meaning
any injury to business or property caused by racketeering activity is
sufficient. This supports the proposition that Charles's eviction, loss of
funds, and removal from his business are compensable injuries under RICO,
giving him standing to bring a claim.

Extract
§ 1962 violations must proximately cause the plaintiff’s injury to business or
property... A plaintiff only has standing to sue if they have been injured in
their business or property by conduct constituting the violation. To establish
a § 1962(c) RICO claim, the following elements must be proven: ... Injury: An
injury to business or property due to the racketeering activity.
Summary
Requirements for a civil RICO claim, emphasizing that a plaintiff must
demonstrate an injury to business or property caused by the racketeering
activity. This directly supports the proposition that Charles's eviction, loss of
funds, and removal from his business are compensable injuries under RICO,
as they represent injuries to his business or property.
RICO: A Primer
Extract
RICO provides for a civil action against persons engaged in a 'pattern of
racketeering activity' or 'collection of an unlawful debt.' A successful
plaintiff may recover treble damages, costs, and attorneys' fees. ... A
'pattern' may exist where any combination of two or more offenses occurred
within a period of time. ... A plaintiff may demonstrate a pattern by
establishment that the predicate acts pose a threat of continued criminal
activity, which is generally demonstrated by showing either: * Closed-ended
continuity. Proving 'a series of related predicate acts extending over a
substantial period of time.' * Open-ended continuity. A threat of 'continuing

criminal activity extending indefinitely into the future,' in light of the nature
of the enterprise and predicate acts alleged.
Summary
RICO allows for civil actions against individuals engaged in a pattern of
racketeering activity. The passage explains the concept of a "pattern" of
racketeering activity, which is crucial for establishing a RICO claim. It also
highlights the potential for recovering damages, costs, and attorneys' fees,
which supports the idea that Charles's injuries (eviction, loss of funds, and
removal from his business) could be compensable under RICO if they
resulted from such a pattern.
Defending RICO Claims In The Business Context Part II: RICO Claims Must
Allege Injury To Business Or Property
Extract
If a plaintiff brings a civil suit alleging a RICO violation, the plaintiff must
plausibly allege that his injury animating the RICO claim is associated with
his business or property by reason of the defendant's violation of the RICO
laws. ... Indeed, most courts have construed them narrowly to mean that
there must be a pecuniary injury to a proprietary interest, and thus a
plaintiff must show some sort of concrete financial loss. In addition, the
injury must be ascertainable and definable, such as when a plaintiff is
deprived of the ability to use or transfer property. ... In contrast, in addition
to more obvious injuries to business or property, courts have determined
that a plaintiff's alleged injuries were sufficient in cases involving lost
profits, excessive interest charges, property damage and interference with
business, such as decreased business profits or increased costs of doing
business.
Summary
Injuries must involve a pecuniary loss or deprivation of property use, which
aligns with Charles's claims of eviction, loss of funds, and removal from his
business. These are concrete financial losses and deprivation of property
use, which are compensable under RICO.
