Question
IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT
OF OKLAHOMA CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, Plaintiff, v. DANIEL KENNETH
BRANTHOOVER & MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS Defendants § § § § § Civil
No.: 5:24-cv-01311 § § § § § FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT Plaintiff Charles
Dustin Myers, representing himself pro-se and proceeding in forma pauperis
respectfully files this First Amended Complaint against Daniel Kenneth
Branthoover and Morgan Michelle Myers. The original complaint filed on
December 16, 2024, is respectfully amended to incorporate Morgan
Michelle Myers as an additional defendant and Plaintiff has provided this
Court with the necessary materials to effectuate service prior to the July 11
deadline, as extended by this court pursuant to its’ recent order issued on
June 11, 2025. In support of this amended complaint, Plaintiff alleges the
following: I. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 1. This Honorable Court possesses
subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331, as
Plaintiff’s claims arise under the laws of the United States, specifically the
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C. §
1964(c) and § 1964(d), which explicitly grants federal courts jurisdiction
over civil RICO actions. Further, jurisdiction is established under 18 U.S.C. §
1965, which provides for nationwide service of process and jurisdiction in
RICO actions, thereby ensuring that all Defendants, regardless of their
physical location within the United States, are subject to the jurisdiction of
this Court. 2. Venue is proper in the United States District Court for the
Western District of Oklahoma pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 1965(a) and 28 U.S.C.
§ 1391(b). A substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the
claims asserted herein occurred within this District. 3. Additionally, “any
person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section
1962…may sue therefor in any appropriate United States district court and
shall recover threefold the damages he sustains and the cost of the suit,
including a reasonable attorney’s fee…” 18 U.S.C § 1964. Plaintiff alleges to
have a direct and ongoing injury to his business and property as a result
from the alleged predicate acts herein. II. PARTIES A. Identification 4.
Plaintiff Charles Dustin Myers, referred to herein as “Plaintiff”, is a natural
person and a resident of the State of Texas and is legally domiciled in
Tarrant County. 5. Defendant Daniel Kenneth Branthoover, referred to
herein as “Branthoover”, is a natural person and a resident of the state of
Oklahoma and is domiciled in Canadian County. 6. Defendant Morgan
Michelle Myers, referred to herein as “Myers”, is a natural person, and a
resident of the State of Texas and is legally domiciled in Tarrant County. 7.
Collectively, Branthoover and Myers are referred to herein as “the
Defendants”. B. Representation 8. Plaintiff is representing himself in this
matter. 9. Myers is believed to be self-represented at this time. 9.
Branthoover is believed to be self-represented at this time. C. Settlement 10.
Plaintiff has extended settlement offers to both Defendants and has received
no response. III. PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 11. At the heart of this
litigation lies a deliberate and orchestrated scheme by Defendant Morgan
Michelle Myers, who, instead of accepting accountability for her
extramarital affair, strategically chose to displace Plaintiff from his home
and destabilize his financial and familial security. Myers meticulously

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
executed a calculated plan involving interstate travel, fraudulent affidavits,
deliberate perjury, asset diversion, and systematic manipulation of multiple
Texas state courts to escape accountability for her actions. 12. To carry out
this scheme, Myers enlisted the assistance of Daniel Kenneth Branthoover, a
resident of Yukon Oklahoma, who has a prior history regarding violations of
protective orders and tampering with government documents. For no other
reason than to escape accountability for her affair, Myers spun an elaborate
web of lies and weaponized her family and court procedures designed to
help victims of abuse. 13.What emerges from the evidence is not a domestic
dispute gone awry, but a textbook criminal enterprise created within this
Court’s Jurisdiction. This is the story of how a person corruptly influenced
the very courts designed to protect families—transforming them into
instruments of fraud, extortion, and systematic theft. It is a tale of how two
individuals, connected by a common goal, orchestrated a seventeen-month
reign of terror that began in Oklahoma and was carried out in the Texas
courts. 14.The Defendants did not merely lie to courts—they constructed an
elaborate criminal enterprise with defined roles, coordinated operations,
and a singular mission: to strip Plaintiff of everything he held dear through
the systematic corruption of judicial proceedings. They did not simply steal
money—they laundered it across state lines while simultaneously preparing
false indigency claims. They did not just fabricate allegations—they
manufactured an entire false narrative of domestic violence, complete with
non-existent protective orders and imaginary threats, all while the supposed
"victim" continued to share a bed with her alleged "abuser." 15.This case
exposes the dark underbelly of how the family court system can be
perverted by those willing to commit federal crimes to achieve their goals. It
reveals how easily the sacred trust placed in sworn affidavits can be
shattered by defendants who view perjury not as a crime, but as a tool. Most
importantly, it demonstrates that when domestic relations become the
vehicle for interstate racketeering, federal intervention is not just
appropriate—it is essential. 16.The evidence will show that Defendants
Myers and Branthoover operated their criminal enterprise with the precision
of seasoned criminals thanks to Branthoover’s history involving protective
order violations and government document tampering. 17.This is not a story
about a marriage that failed. This is simply the product of a litigant who
values her extramarital relationships over morality, and who chose to
weaponize her family against Plaintiff for the sole purpose of escaping
accountability. 18. Through hundreds of hours of research, and through his
zealous advocacy in state courts, Plaintiff now turns to establish that the
Defendants in this matter engaged in the prohibited conduct of an
enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity, and seeks relief to
prevent the enterprise from reaching its’ ultimate goal: finalization. Against
all odds, and in support of this preliminary statement, Plaintiff alleges the
following: IV. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS A. Enterprise Formation and Initial
Criminal Coordination (December 14-15, 2023) 19. Defendant Branthoover
possesses extensive knowledge of protective order procedures and
requirements due to his prior criminal convictions involving violations of
such orders. See Exhibit 1. This knowledge would prove instrumental in the
enterprise's systematic manipulation of protective order proceedings. 20. On
December 14, 2023, immediately following Plaintiff's discovery of Defendant
Myers' extramarital affair, Myers initiated the criminal enterprise by taking
two coordinated actions: first, she opened a private bank account in her sole

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
name to facilitate asset concealment; and second, she commenced intensive
interstate communications with Defendant Branthoover via text messaging.
The scope and intensity of these communications—totaling 92 text messages
exchanged between Branthoover's registered number 940-312-3434 and
Myers' registered number 817-235-5189 on this single day—demonstrates
the deliberate and coordinated nature of their criminal planning. See Exhibit
2. 21. Concurrently with these interstate communications, and without any
legitimate cause or factual basis, Defendant Myers attempted to obtain an
ex-parte protective order against Plaintiff. This attempt, made while actively
coordinating with Branthoover, represents the enterprise's first overt act
designed to manipulate judicial proceedings through false allegations. See
Exhibit 3. 22. In a calculated effort to maintain operational security and
prevent Plaintiff from discovering the criminal scheme, Myers engaged in
deliberate deception that same evening. Despite having just sought
emergency protection from Plaintiff hours earlier, she casually reminded him
of their child's school field trip scheduled for the following day, thereby
creating a facade of normalcy designed to conceal her fraudulent intentions
and prevent suspicion of the enterprise's activities. See Exhibit 4. B.
Interstate Criminal Coordination and Financial Crimes (December 15-16,
2023) 23. On December 15, 2023, at precisely 9:51 A.M. CST, Defendant
Branthoover contacted Plaintiff directly, employing calculated deception by
stating, "I've been where you are before. I want to help both of you." This
communication, referencing Myers' December 1, 2023 divorce
announcement, was designed to establish false pretenses for Myers' planned
interstate travel to Oklahoma for criminal coordination purposes. See
Exhibit 5. 24. During this deceptive phone conversation, Branthoover
established the operational framework for the next phase of the criminal
scheme by arranging for Myers to visit his Oklahoma residence over the
weekend of December 15, 2023. The stated purpose—"providing space" to
Myers—was a deliberate misrepresentation designed to conceal the true
criminal purpose of coordinating fraudulent document preparation and
enterprise operations. 25. The effectiveness of this deception is evidenced
by Plaintiff's complete lack of knowledge regarding the previous day's ex-
parte protective order attempt. Having no reason to suspect Branthoover's
dishonest intentions, Plaintiff unwittingly facilitated the enterprise's criminal
coordination by agreeing to Myers' travel to Oklahoma. 26. Immediately
following Branthoover's deceptive phone call, the enterprise executed its
first major financial crime. Plaintiff received notification that Myers had
transferred $1,576 from the parties' joint marital PNC account to
Branthoover's PayPal account (username "dmb575"), completely depleting
the account balance. This interstate wire transfer represents a critical
predicate act, utilizing interstate commerce to further the criminal scheme
while simultaneously depriving Plaintiff of operating funds necessary for his
legitimate business operations. 27. The immediate and devastating impact of
this financial crime became apparent on December 16, 2023, when Plaintiff
received notification that the joint marital PNC account was overdrawn by
$800.00. Concurrently, Plaintiff discovered that advertisements for his
legitimate home-based business had ceased running due to payment failure
directly caused by the enterprise's theft of operating funds. This
demonstrates the enterprise's deliberate intent to cause maximum financial
harm to Plaintiff. 28. The criminal nature of this financial transaction is
conclusively established by documentary evidence. The PNC bank statement

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
for December 2023 provides irrefutable proof of the unauthorized
withdrawal, documenting the precise date, amount, and destination of the
fraudulent transfer. 29. The direct connection between Defendant
Branthoover and this financial crime is established through multiple forms
of evidence. The PayPal identifier "dmb575" appearing on Plaintiff's bank
statement directly corresponds to Branthoover's PayPal account, creating an
unbreakable evidentiary chain linking him to the illicit financial transaction,
corroborated by his own admissions in subsequent text communications. 30.
On December 16, 2023, at precisely 3:54 P.M. CST, Plaintiff made a good-
faith attempt to resolve the situation amicably by sending a detailed text
message to Defendant Branthoover. This communication explicitly requested
the return of the fraudulently transferred $1,576, detailed the intended
legitimate use of these funds, described the financial hardship caused by the
theft (including late bills and business disruption), explained Plaintiff's
inability to work due to the severe emotional distress caused by Defendants'
criminal actions, and expressed his sincere desire for an amicable resolution
during the holiday season. 31. Defendant Branthoover's response to this
reasonable request revealed the true criminal nature of the enterprise. In a
callous and dismissive reply, Branthoover stated, "You Are Getting
Divorced..." followed by, "I hope I can help with the paperwork and make
things go as smoothly as possible." Far from the helpful assistance initially
promised, this communication constituted a direct threat and overt act in
furtherance of the criminal conspiracy, demonstrating Branthoover's intent
to exploit Plaintiff's financial distress for the enterprise's benefit while
utilizing interstate communications to further the scheme. 32. This
communication also establishes Branthoover's unauthorized practice of law
across state lines. At no time relevant to this litigation has Defendant
Branthoover possessed a license to practice law in any jurisdiction within
the United States. His statements regarding "paperwork" and making legal
proceedings "go as smoothly as possible" constitute clear evidence of
unauthorized legal practice and demonstrate his administrative role in
directing the enterprise's criminal activities. C. Coordinated Eviction Fraud
and Interstate Document Transportation (December 17, 2023) 33. On
December 17, 2023, at approximately 11:00 A.M., Plaintiff was served with
an eviction notice by the grandmother of Myers, who is also the landlord of
the matrimonial residence, which contained the following false information:
i. A purported “lease violation,” which was entirely fabricated as no valid
lease agreement existed between Plaintiff and Wilson; ii. The assertion that
“Granddaughter getting divorced,” referring to Defendant Myers, as a basis
for eviction; iii. The false claim that a “Protective order has been filed.” iv.
The directive that “He must leave. She and the girls may stay,”
demonstrating the clear intent to dispossess Plaintiff for the benefit of
Myers. 34. The coordinated and premeditated nature of this eviction fraud is
established by the timing of its execution. At the precise moment this
fraudulent notice was being served in Texas, Defendant Myers was
physically present in Oklahoma with Defendant Branthoover, actively
collaborating in the preparation of the very fraudulent court documents
referenced in the eviction notice. This simultaneous coordination across
state lines demonstrates the sophisticated and deliberate nature of the
criminal enterprise's operations. 35. Myers' knowledge of the fraudulent
nature of these proceedings is conclusively established. She possessed
actual knowledge that no valid lease agreement existed between Plaintiff

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
and the landlord, and she had actual knowledge that neither divorce
proceedings nor protective orders had been filed at the time of service,
making her participation in the eviction fraud a knowing and willful criminal
act. 36. On December 17, 2023, Defendant Myers completed the interstate
transportation phase of the criminal scheme by transporting the fraudulent
court documents prepared in Oklahoma back across state lines to Texas.
These documents, including the Original Petition for Divorce and Affidavit of
Indigency, were specifically prepared with the intent of submitting them to
Texas state courts to further the enterprise's fraudulent manipulation of
judicial proceedings. 37. Upon her return to Texas, Myers demonstrated her
control over the eviction fraud by personally destroying the fraudulent
eviction notice. She physically tore the notice in half and wrote "VOID" on it
in black marker, providing clear evidence of her influence over and
coordination of the fraudulent eviction attempt orchestrated during her
absence in Oklahoma. D. Operational Security and Document Preparation
(December 17-18, 2023) 38. As part of the enterprise's operational security
measures, Defendant Myers returned from Oklahoma equipped with a
canister of pepper spray, designed to support the false narrative of domestic
violence that would be central to the fraudulent court documents prepared
during her Oklahoma visit. 39. During her Oklahoma visit, Defendant Myers
acquired a secondary phone number (817-940-0852) as a deliberate
operational security measure. This acquisition, which she explicitly disclosed
to Plaintiff, constituted an overt act in furtherance of the criminal
enterprise, designed to facilitate clandestine communications related to the
fraudulent scheme while concealing the enterprise's ongoing criminal
coordination from detection. 40. This newly acquired secondary phone
number became an integral component of the fraudulent court documents
prepared under Defendant Branthoover's direct administrative oversight.
The systematic use of this number across multiple fraudulent legal
documents demonstrates the coordinated nature of the enterprise's
document preparation activities. These documents, prepared in Oklahoma
with the specific intent of unlawfully influencing Texas legal proceedings,
included: i. An "Original Petition for Divorce" dated December 18, 2023,
containing numerous material false statements designed to deceive the
Texas courts; ii. An "Affidavit of Indigency" dated December 18, 2023,
containing deliberate misrepresentations regarding Myers' financial status
to defraud the court of legitimate filing fees; iii. A "Request for Uncontested
Cases" dated December 18, 2023, fraudulently filed despite the complete
absence of any communication between the parties regarding divorce
proceedings; iv. An "Application for Protective Order" dated December 22,
2023, containing entirely fabricated allegations of family violence. E.
Unauthorized Practice of Law and Intimidation (December 18, 2023) 42. 41.
Following the filing of the initial fraudulent divorce documents on December
18, 2023, Defendant Branthoover escalated his unauthorized practice of law
by sending Plaintiff a text message asserting legal representation and
attempting to control all future communications. The message stated:
“Charlie, it’s come to my understanding you have retained an attorney. I’m
sure he has told you that all further communication should take place
between attorneys. I must formally ask you refrain from discussing details of
this case with my client moving forward and only communicate with me or
your attorney.” This communication was a deliberate attempt to isolate
Plaintiff from direct communication with Myers and to control the flow of

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
information, thereby hindering Plaintiff’s ability to uncover the full extent of
the fraudulent scheme. This communication also evidences that
Branthoover’s role went beyond helping Myers prepare the documents by
seeing them through to their submission and asserting an administrative
role over the proceedings to intimidate Plaintiff. F. Service Through Official
Channels and Continued Deception (December 22-28, 2023) 42. In
furtherance of the criminal scheme, and despite continuing to cohabitate
with Plaintiff in the marital residence, Defendant Myers deliberately utilized
official constable service to effectuate service of the fraudulent divorce
petition and protective order application, which occurred on December 27,
2023. This calculated use of official legal processes to serve fraudulent
documents while maintaining the deceptive facade of normalcy at home
demonstrates the sophisticated and deliberate nature of the enterprise's
operations. 43. The enterprise's manipulation of official legal processes
continued when Myers, despite residing next door to Plaintiff, deliberately
influenced and coordinated the constable service of the fraudulent eviction
documents, which occurred on December 28, 2023. This systematic abuse of
official legal processes while maintaining physical proximity and continued
cohabitation reveals the calculated and deceptive nature of the enterprise's
operations. G. Systematic False Statements in Sworn Court Documents
(December 18, 2023) 44. When reviewing the documents prepared in part
by Branthoover and filed with the court by Myers, there existed several false
statements and were intended to deceive the court and prejudice Plaintiff in
furtherance of the scheme to dispose him of his property interests.
Specifically, these false statements included, but were not limited to: i. The
assertion that the spouses had ceased living together on December 1, 2023,
when in fact they were still residing together at the marital home on that
date and for several weeks thereafter. ii. The claim that Defendant Myers
owned both family vehicles as her separate property prior to the marriage,
which was demonstrably false as these vehicles were acquired during the
marriage and constituted community property, paid for by Plaintiff. iii. The
representation that Defendant Myers had an active order of protection
against Plaintiff with a judicial finding that family violence had occurred
during the marriage, which was fabricated and without any basis in fact or
law. iv. The assertion that the children or Defendant Myers would be
subjected to harassment or abuse if Plaintiff were provided with her second
phone number (817-940-0852) acquired in Oklahoma, which was a baseless
and manipulative claim designed to conceal her communications related to
the fraudulent scheme. 45. Concurrently with the fraudulent divorce
petition, Defendant Myers, again with the administrative oversight and full
knowledge of Defendant Branthoover, filed a fraudulent “Affidavit of
Indigency” with the court. This affidavit contained material
misrepresentations regarding Defendant Myers’ financial status, all of which
were known to be false at the time of filing and were intended to defraud the
court and avoid legitimate court costs. Specifically, these false statements
included: i. The claim that Defendant Myers was financially indigent and
unable to pay court costs, despite her access to and control over substantial
marital assets. ii. The representation that Defendant Myers was solely
responsible for all family living expenses, including rent, utilities, food, and
other living expenses, when in fact, Plaintiff was the primary breadwinner of
the household at that time. iii. The assertion that Defendant Myers was
solely responsible for both car payments, which she has no payment history

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
to support such a claim. H. Escalation Through Fabricated Violence
Allegations (December 22, 2023) 46. On December 22, 2023, despite having
claimed in her divorce petition to already possess an active protective order,
Myers filed an "Application for Protective Order," revealing the
contradictory and fabricated nature of her previous representations while
escalating the enterprise's fraudulent manipulation of judicial proceedings.
47. Upon review, defendant Myers made additional false statements within
the sworn document, all intended to further deceive the court and secure an
unwarranted protective order against Plaintiff to effectuate the enterprises’
goal of divesting him of his property interests. These false statements
included, but were not limited to: i. The claim that family violence occurred
on December 18, 2023, in the presence of the children, which was entirely
false and fabricated. ii. The assertion that family violence occurred prior to
December 18, 2023, which was also false and without any factual basis. iii.
The request that Plaintiff take a battering intervention program. I.
Achievement of Primary Criminal Objective (January 16, 2024) 48. The
enterprise's coordinated criminal activities achieved their primary objective
through the systematic deception of the Texas court system. The common
purpose underlying all fraudulent documents and criminal acts—executed
through Branthoover's administrative coordination and Myers' on-ground
implementation—encompassed multiple interconnected goals: unlawfully
removing Plaintiff from his residence (essential for his livelihood and the
family's financial stability), gaining an illicit advantage in divorce
proceedings through fraudulent representations, and ultimately securing a
divorce decree on terms unilaterally favorable to Myers, thereby making the
unlawful deprivation of Plaintiff's rights and property permanent while
enabling the enterprise to escape accountability for their criminal conduct.
49. On January 16, 2024, the enterprise's criminal scheme achieved its
primary objective when Plaintiff appeared before the 322nd District Court of
Tarrant County and was ordered to vacate the family residence.
Significantly, this order was entered without any evidentiary hearing and
without judicial findings regarding the allegations contained in the
fraudulent documents, demonstrating that the court's decision was based
entirely on the false information systematically presented by the enterprise.
50. The causal relationship between the enterprise's fraudulent
representations and this judicial outcome is conclusively established. The
misinformation presented to the court through the coordinated fraudulent
documents was the sole basis for the court's decision, providing Myers with
the exact advantage that she and Branthoover had anticipated and planned
through their criminal coordination. J. Ongoing Pattern of Racketeering
Activity and Continuity (January 2024 - Present) 51. Between January 16,
2024, and the present day, Defendants Myers and Branthoover have
continued to further their racketeering activity through a series of ongoing
illicit acts, demonstrating a clear pattern of continuity and relatedness.
These acts include, but are not limited to: i. Myers and Branthoover
continuing to engage in illicit communications regarding case details
between one another across state lines, specifically between Texas and
Oklahoma, in direct furtherance of their fraudulent scheme to see the
divorce through to its’ finalization. ii. Branthoover delivering ongoing
threats and intimidation to Plaintiff regarding his legitimate attempts to
seek legal relief from the orders that were a product of the Defendants’
actions, which occurred in December of 2023, June of 2024, December of

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
2024, and May of 2025. iii. Making direct statements such as “I’ve been
enjoying watching every filing get denied” by Branthoover, showing the
malicious intent behind his involvement as Plaintiff sought relief for their
coordinated actions. 52. On June 23, 2024, Defendant Branthoover
continued his pattern of harassment and intimidation by sending Plaintiff a
text message stating, "Lol. And here comes another denial," in direct
reference to Plaintiff's court filing seeking to enjoin Branthoover as a party
to the divorce proceedings. This communication provides conclusive
evidence of Branthoover's continued awareness of and active involvement in
the Texas legal proceedings, his ongoing monitoring of court filings, and his
malicious intent to mock and intimidate Plaintiff's efforts to seek justice
through legitimate legal channels. 53. On December 12, 2024, Branthoover
escalated his threatening communications by sending Plaintiff a message
stating, "When things all over you get to deal with me. Just a heads up,"
demonstrating the enterprise's ongoing criminal intent and explicit threats
of future retaliation against Plaintiff for his efforts to expose and seek relief
from their criminal activities. 54. Most recently, on May 24, 2025,
Branthoover sent Plaintiff a message stating, "Where's my lawsuit? Heard
your vm about me. File it. Let's do this :)" This communication demonstrates
the enterprise's continued operation, Branthoover's ongoing monitoring of
Plaintiff's activities, and his explicit challenge and threat regarding potential
legal action, providing clear evidence of the enterprise's ongoing criminal
intent and the continuing threat posed to Plaintiff. 55. As a direct result of
the actions outlined above, Plaintiff has sustained substantial injury to his
business and property. V. RICO FRAMEWORK AND PREDICATE ACTS 56.
Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations contained in
paragraphs 1 through 55 above, as if fully set forth herein. 57. The
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) provides civil
and criminal penalties for those who engage in a pattern of racketeering
activity connected to an enterprise affecting interstate commerce. Under 18
U.S.C. § 1961, "racketeering activity" encompasses a broad range of criminal
actions including "any act which is indictable under any of the following
provisions of title 18, United States Code: ... section 1952 (relating to
racketeering)." 58. To establish a RICO violation, a plaintiff must
demonstrate: "(1) a person who engages in (2) a pattern of racketeering
activity, (3) connected to the acquisition, establishment, conduct, or control
of an enterprise." Gil Ramirez Grp., L.L.C. v. Houston Indep. Sch. Dist.,
CIVIL ACTION 4:10-CV-04872 (S.D. Tex. Jul 31, 2017). The pattern of
racketeering activity must include at least two predicate acts that are
related and amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity. 59.
Here, Defendants are alleged to have committed several predicate acts
including multiple counts of wire fraud, violations of the Travelers Act, and
perjury as part of a broader pattern of racketeering activity. 60. As explained
in more detail below, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations
Act (RICO) requires a “pattern of racketeering activity”, which Plaintiff will
plead with particularity the predicate acts committed by the Defendants,
how they are related, and demonstrate continuity as required. V.
INTRODUCTION TO RICO 61. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by
reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 60 above, as if
fully set forth herein. 62. The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act (RICO) requires proof of a "pattern of racketeering
activity," which the Supreme Court has consistently held consists of two

=== PAGE 9 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
essential elements: relatedness and continuity of predicate acts. Based on
the provided facts and the applicable law, the Defendants' series of related
acts spanning from December 2023 through May 2025 (approximately 18
months) satisfies both the relatedness requirement (as the acts share similar
purposes, participants, and methods) and the continuity requirement (as
they extend over a substantial period of time) necessary to establish a
pattern of racketeering activity under RICO. 63. The defendants' conduct
falls squarely within the 10th Circuit's interpretation of RICO's pattern
requirement. The predicate acts of wire fraud, interstate travel, perjury,
threats, and intimidation are all enumerated as "racketeering activities"
under 18 U.S.C. § 1961, and they were committed in furtherance of the same
criminal enterprise. This ongoing criminal activity over an extended period
demonstrates "closed-ended continuity" as recognized by the Supreme Court
and followed by federal courts nationwide, including the 10th Circuit. The
defendants' pattern of racketeering activity clearly satisfies the statutory
definition and judicial interpretations of what constitutes a RICO violation.
A. Statutory Framework 64. The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act (RICO) provides the statutory framework for prosecuting
organized criminal activities. The statute defines key terms and establishes
the elements required to prove a RICO violation. 65. Under 18 U.S.C. § 1962,
it is unlawful for "any person through a pattern of racketeering activity or
through collection of an unlawful debt to acquire or maintain, directly or
indirectly, any interest in or control of any enterprise which is engaged in, or
the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce." 18 U.S.C. §
1962 (2025). 66. The term "racketeering activity" is defined in 18 U.S.C. §
1961 to include specific enumerated offenses, including "any act which is
indictable under any of the following provisions of title 18, United States
Code: ... section 1343 (relating to wire fraud), ... section 1512 (relating to
tampering with a witness, victim, or an informant), section 1513 (relating to
retaliating against a witness, victim, or an informant)." 18 U.S.C. § 1961
(2025). 67. Crucially, the statute defines a "pattern of racketeering activity"
as requiring "at least two acts of racketeering activity, one of which
occurred after the effective date of this chapter and the last of which
occurred within ten years (excluding any period of imprisonment) after the
commission of a prior act of racketeering activity." 18 U.S.C. § 1961 (2025).
68. Additionally, 18 U.S.C. § 1952 establishes penalties for interstate or
foreign travel in aid of racketeering enterprises, which is relevant to the
defendants' interstate travel in this case. 18 U.S.C. § 1952 (2025). B.
Supreme Court Interpretation of RICO's "Pattern" Requirement 69. While
the statutory definition of "pattern of racketeering activity" requires at least
two predicate acts within a ten-year period, the Supreme Court has clarified
that merely proving two predicate acts is not sufficient to establish a pattern
under RICO. In the landmark case of H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co.,
492 U.S. 229 (1989), the Supreme Court established that a RICO pattern
requires both "relatedness" and "continuity" of the predicate acts. 70. This
interpretation has been consistently referenced and applied in subsequent
cases. As explained in Ellis v. Warner, CASE NO. 15-10134-CIV-GOODMAN
(S.D. Fla. Feb 16, 2017), "To establish a pattern of racketeering activity, 'a
plaintiff... must show that the racketeering predicates are related, and that
they amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity.' H.J. Inc. v.
Nw. Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 239, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989).
The pattern requirement has been reduced to a 'continuity plus relationship'

test." 71. The "continuity plus relationship" test has become the standard
framework for analyzing whether a pattern of racketeering activity exists
under RICO. This test requires proving both that the predicate acts are
related to each other and that they demonstrate continuity or a threat of
continuity. C. Relatedness Requirement 72. The relatedness element focuses
on whether the predicate acts are connected to each other and to a common
purpose. As articulated in Chambers v. King Buick GMC, LLC, 43 F. Supp. 3d
575 (D. Md. 2014), "The relationship criterion may be satisfied by showing
that the criminal acts 'have the same or similar purposes, victims, or
methods of commission, or are otherwise interrelated by distinguishing
characteristics and are not isolated events.'" 73. Similarly, Gross v. Waywell,
628 F.Supp.2d 475 (S.D. N.Y. 2009) explains that "The relatedness test
requires that the predicate acts relied upon 'share the same or similar
purposes, results, participants, victims or methods, or otherwise are
interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not isolated events.'
H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 240, 109 S.Ct. 2893." The relatedness element ensures
that RICO is applied to organized criminal activity rather than disconnected,
sporadic offenses. D. Continuity Requirement 74. The continuity element can
be established through either "closed-ended continuity" or "open-ended
continuity." As stated in Murphy v. Farmer, 176 F.Supp.3d 1325 (N.D. Ga.
2016), "Continuity may be established in one of two ways. A plaintiff may
prove closed-ended continuity by showing 'a closed period of repeated
conduct,' or the plaintiff may prove open-ended continuity by showing 'past
conduct that by its nature projects into the future with a threat of
repetition.'" 75. Closed-ended continuity involves a series of related
predicate acts over a substantial period of time. As noted in Reynolds v.
Condon, 908 F.Supp. 1494 (N.D. W.Va. 1996), "A party alleging a RICO
violation may demonstrate continuity over a closed period by proving a
series of related predicates extending over a substantial period of time." 76.
Open-ended continuity, on the other hand, involves a threat of continued
criminal activity into the future. According to WATER INTERN. NETWORK,
USA, INC. v. East, 892 F. Supp. 1477 (M.D. Fla. 1995), continuity
encompasses both "a close-ended and open-ended concept. A party alleging
a RICO violation may demonstrate continuity over a closed period by
proving a series of related predicate acts over a substantial period of time.
Otherwise, it must be shown that the predicate acts establish a threat of
long-term racketeering activity." The continuity requirement ensures that
RICO is applied to ongoing patterns of criminal activity rather than isolated
incidents. E. Defendants' Conduct as Predicate Acts Under RICO 77. The
Defendants' conduct, as outlined above, includes wire fraud, interstate
travel, perjury, threats, and intimidation from December 2023 through May
2025, all in furtherance of the same criminal enterprise with a common
purpose. To determine whether this conduct constitutes a pattern of
racketeering activity under RICO, it must be analyzed whether these acts
qualify as predicate acts and whether they demonstrate both relatedness
and continuity. 78. First, Plaintiff needs to establish whether the defendants'
acts qualify as "racketeering activity" under 18 U.S.C. § 1961. According to
this statute, "racketeering activity" includes "any act which is indictable
under any of the following provisions of title 18, United States Code: ...
section 1343 (relating to wire fraud), ... section 1512 (relating to tampering
with a witness, victim, or an informant), section 1513 (relating to retaliating
against a witness, victim, or an informant)." 18 U.S.C. § 1961 (2025). VI.

PREDICATE ACT – WIRE FRAUD 79. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by
reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 74 above, as if
fully set forth herein. 80. The facts establish all three elements of wire fraud
under 18 U.S.C. § 1343—a scheme to defraud, use of interstate wire
communications, and intent to deprive another of money or property—
qualifying it as a RICO predicate act under 18 U.S.C. § 1961. 81. The
relevant federal statutes in this analysis are 18 U.S.C. § 1343 (Wire Fraud)
and 18 U.S.C. § 1961 (RICO Definitions). 82. Title 18 U.S.C. § 1343 states:
"Whoever, having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to
defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent
pretenses, representations, or promises, transmits or causes to be
transmitted by means of wire, radio, or television communication in
interstate or foreign commerce, any writings, signs, signals, pictures, or
sounds for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice, shall be fined
under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both." 83. Title 18
U.S.C. § 1961 defines "racketeering activity" to include "any act which is
indictable under any of the following provisions of title 18, United States
Code:... section 1343 (relating to wire fraud)...". This statutory provision
explicitly establishes wire fraud as a predicate act for RICO violations. A.
Scheme to Defraud 84. The first element of wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. §
1343 is the existence of "a scheme to defraud." As noted in United States v.
Greenberg, 835 F.3d 295 (2nd Cir. 2016), this constitutes an "essential
element" of the crime. In the present case, Myers transferred $1,576 from a
joint marital PNC account to Branthoover's PayPal account, depleting the
account entirely. This transfer was not an isolated action but was
accompanied by "a series of coordinated text messages and phone calls"
between Myers and Branthoover regarding the scheme. 85. The
coordination between the parties through multiple communications channels
demonstrates a deliberate plan rather than a spontaneous or inadvertent
action. As articulated in Mail and Wire Fraud, a "scheme to defraud requires
a material falsehood, material misrepresentation, or the concealment of a
material fact." By transferring funds from a joint marital account without
apparent authorization from the joint account holder, Myers engaged in
conduct that reflects the concealment of material facts regarding the
disposition of marital assets. 86. The scheme in this case specifically
targeted marital funds, which are legally considered shared property
between spouses. By depleting the account, Myers intentionally deprived the
Plaintiff of access to funds to which they were legally entitled. This satisfies
the requirement that the scheme have "money or property as the object of
the scheme" as stated in Smulley v. Fed. Hous. Fin. Agency, 17-2666 (2nd
Cir. Oct 05, 2018). B. Use of Interstate Wire Communications 87. The second
element of wire fraud requires the "use of the mails or wires to further the
scheme." United States v. Greenberg, 835 F.3d 295 (2nd Cir. 2016). The
facts demonstrate that Myers used interstate wire communications in two
distinct ways: i. The transfer of $1,576 was "executed via interstate wire
(bank to PayPal)," which constitutes an electronic transmission across state
lines. ii. The transfer "was accompanied by a series of coordinated text
messages and phone calls between Myers (in Texas) and Branthoover (in
Oklahoma) regarding the scheme." 88. Wire transmissions include interstate
telephone calls or electronic transmissions. Furthermore, internet
communications satisfy the interstate nexus requirement, even in the
absence of proof that a fraudulent communication traveled through out-of-

=== PAGE 12 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
state servers. 89. The interstate nature of these communications is
established by the fact that Myers was in Texas while Branthoover was in
Oklahoma during their communications about the scheme. This satisfies the
jurisdictional requirement that the wire communication cross state lines. 90.
Importantly, each of these communications—the bank transfer, text
messages, and phone calls—constitutes a separate use of interstate wire
communications. As noted in Mail and Wire Fraud: "Each use of the mail or
wires constitutes a separate offense and therefore can be a separate count
in an indictment." C. Intend to Defraud 91. The third element requires that
the defendant acted "with the intent to defraud." As stated in U.S. v.
Blackmon, 839 F.2d 900 (2nd Cir. 1988), the wire fraud statute requires that
the defendant "be a party to some kind of scheme to defraud, a requirement
that includes a high degree of scienter and moral culpability." 92. The facts
indicate that Myers and Branthoover engaged in "a series of coordinated
text messages and phone calls... regarding the scheme." This coordination
demonstrates premeditation and planning, which supports a finding of intent
to defraud. The fact that the transfer depleted the joint account entirely
further suggests an intent to maximize the financial impact on the Plaintiff,
depriving them of access to any funds from that account. 93. According to
Theft offenses, wire fraud requires "that the defendant voluntarily and
intentionally devised or participated in a scheme to defraud another out of
money." The coordination between Myers and Branthoover through multiple
communications channels demonstrates voluntary and intentional
participation in the scheme. 94. Furthermore, Branthoover specifically
stated that he wanted to help Plaintiff, which he knew was not a true
statement at the time. The fact that text and phone communications were
used to deceive Plaintiff into believing that Myers’ interstate travel would be
beneficial for him further supports a scheme to defraud, because the
transfer of funds occurred after this false extension of help from
Branthoover. D. Potential Defenses 95. One potential defense might be that
Myers, as a joint account holder, had legal authority to transfer funds from
the account. However, this authority does not necessarily extend to
depleting the account for personal gain or in coordination with a third party
with the intent to deprive the other account holder of their rightful access to
the funds. The joint nature of the account creates a fiduciary duty to act in
good faith regarding the shared asset. That fiduciary duty was willingly
violated when Myers chose to transfer the funds to Branthoover’s PayPal,
and then later to herself. The appropriate method would have been for
Myers to transfer the funds directly to herself, but she avoided this to
conceal her bank account information in furtherance of a broader scheme.
96. The evidence supporting these elements includes the interstate transfer
of funds, the coordination of the scheme through interstate communications,
and the depletion of the joint account to the detriment of the Plaintiff. Each
use of interstate wire communications—the bank transfer, text messages,
and phone calls—constitutes a separate instance of wire fraud. 97. In
summary, the facts presented establish all required elements of wire fraud
under 18 U.S.C. § 1343, qualifying it as a predicate act for RICO purposes
under 18 U.S.C. § 1961. VII. PREDICATE ACT – VIOLATION OF THE TRAVEL
ACT 98. The Travel Act, codified at 18 U.S.C. § 1952, is a federal statute that
criminalizes interstate travel undertaken with the intent to promote or carry
on certain unlawful activities. According to the statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1952
states: "Whoever travels in interstate or foreign commerce or uses the mail

=== PAGE 13 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
or any facility in interstate or foreign commerce, with intent to- ... otherwise
promote, manage, establish, carry on, or facilitate the promotion,
management, establishment, or carrying on, of any unlawful activity, and
thereafter performs or attempts to perform- ... an act described in
paragraph or shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 5
years, or both; ..." The statute is designed to target individuals who cross
state lines with the intent to engage in or facilitate criminal activity. It was
enacted as part of the federal government's efforts to combat organized
crime by reaching criminal activities that might otherwise fall outside
federal jurisdiction due to their local nature. By utilizing Congress's power
to regulate interstate commerce, the Travel Act extends federal jurisdiction
to criminal enterprises that operate across state lines. A. Elements of a
Travel Act Violation 99. As set forth by the act's plain language, the
elements necessary to sustain a Travel Act conviction are (1) travel in
interstate or foreign commerce or use of the mail or any facility in interstate
or foreign commerce, (2) with the intent to promote, manage, establish,
carry on, or facilitate the promotion, management, establishment, or
carrying on, of any unlawful activity, and (3) performance of or an attempt to
perform an act of promotion, management, establishment, or carrying on of
the enumerated unlawful activity. 100. Each of these elements must be
proven beyond a reasonable doubt to establish a Travel Act violation: i.
Interstate Travel or Use of Interstate Facilities: The defendant must have
either traveled across state lines or used facilities of interstate commerce
(such as telephones, electronic communications, or mail). ii. Intent to
Promote Unlawful Activity: The defendant must have undertaken this
interstate travel or used interstate facilities with the specific intent to
promote, manage, establish, carry on, or facilitate one of the unlawful
activities enumerated in the statute. These unlawful activities include
various state and federal crimes such as gambling, liquor offenses,
narcotics, prostitution, extortion, bribery, arson, and importantly for this
case, fraud. iii. Subsequent Acts: After the interstate travel or use of
interstate facilities, the defendant must have performed or attempted to
perform acts that promote, manage, establish, or carry on the unlawful
activity. B. Interstate Travel 101. The first element of a Travel Act violation
requires travel in interstate commerce or the use of facilities in interstate
commerce. According to the facts provided, Myers traveled from Texas to
Oklahoma on December 15, 2023, and then transported the fraudulent
documents back to Texas on December 17, 2023. This clearly establishes
interstate travel, as Myers physically crossed state lines from Texas to
Oklahoma and then returned to Texas. The interstate commerce
requirement is therefore satisfied. C. Intent to Promote Unlawful Activity
102. The second element requires that the interstate travel was undertaken
with the intent to promote, manage, establish, carry on, or facilitate an
unlawful activity. Here, the facts state that Myers traveled to Oklahoma "for
the purpose of preparing fraudulent court documents and coordinating the
criminal scheme." 103. Fraud is specifically encompassed within the
"unlawful activity" contemplated by the Travel Act, as 18 U.S.C. § 1952
prohibits interstate travel with the intent to promote "any unlawful activity,
including fraud or extortion." The explicit purpose of Myers' travel—to
prepare fraudulent court documents—demonstrates her intent to promote
and facilitate fraud, which is an unlawful activity under the statute. 104. The
intent requirement is clearly satisfied, as the purpose of Myers' interstate

=== PAGE 14 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
travel was explicitly to prepare fraudulent documents with the assistance of
Branthoover—a direct promotion of fraudulent activity. This is not a case
where the connection between the travel and the unlawful activity is
tenuous or where the unlawful activity was merely incidental to the travel.
Rather, the preparation of fraudulent court documents was the very reason
for the interstate journey. D. Subsequent Acts in Furtherance of the
Unlawful Activity 105. The third element requires that, following the
interstate travel, the defendant performed or attempted to perform acts to
promote, manage, establish, or carry on the unlawful activity. In this case,
after returning to Texas, Myers "transported the fraudulent documents back
to Texas for use in judicial proceedings" and there were "subsequent acts
(filing and using those documents)." 106. These actions—transporting the
fraudulent documents across state lines, filing them, and using them in
judicial proceedings—constitute clear performance of acts in furtherance of
the fraudulent scheme. The fraudulent documents were not merely prepared
and then abandoned; rather, they were actively transported and
subsequently used in judicial proceedings, demonstrating Myers' continued
efforts to carry out the fraudulent scheme after her interstate travel, which
Branthoover also participated in. 107. The sequence of events—interstate
travel followed by acts in furtherance of fraud—aligns perfectly with the
structure of the Travel Act, which prohibits interstate travel with criminal
intent followed by actions that further the criminal activity. E. Potential
Defenses 108. Defendants may argue that the intent element has not been
properly satisfied, however, texts later sent by Branthoover to Plaintiff
clearly demonstrate a malicious intent. For example, the text sent on June
2023 which stated “I’ve enjoyed watching every filing get denied” defeats
this argument. 109. Defendants might also attempt to argue that the acts
performed after interstate travel were insufficient to satisfy the "subsequent
acts" requirement. However, given that Myers not only transported the
fraudulent documents back to Texas but also used them in judicial
proceedings, this element appears to be clearly satisfied. The filing and use
of the documents in judicial proceedings constitute direct acts in
furtherance of the fraudulent scheme. As far as Branthoover, his role in the
enterprise extended beyond the mere assistance of preparing the fraudulent
documents. After they were filed, he continued to hold himself out to be an
administrative agent of Myers, and send numerous threatening texts
throughout the past seventeen months. 110. In summary, given that Myers'
conduct establishes a clear Travel Act violation, this violation can properly
serve as a predicate act for purposes of establishing a pattern of
racketeering activity under RICO. The deliberate nature of her actions—
traveling interstate specifically to prepare fraudulent court documents—and
the subsequent use of those documents in judicial proceedings demonstrate
a level of planning and execution that aligns with the types of criminal
activity that both the Travel Act and RICO were designed to combat. VIII.
PREDICATE ACT – PERJURY 111. It’s important to note that the Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) does not explicitly list
perjury as a predicate act under 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1). However, courts have
recognized that perjury can serve as a RICO predicate when it is part of a
broader pattern of racketeering activity, particularly when connected to
fraud schemes that qualify as RICO predicates. A. Authority on Perjury as a
Predicate Act 112. The case of United States v. Eisen, 974 F.2d 246 (2d Cir.
1992) addressed this issue directly, stating that "where, as here, a

=== PAGE 15 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
fraudulent scheme falls within the scope of the federal mail fraud statute
and the other elements of RICO are established, use of the mail fraud
offense as a RICO predicate act cannot be suspended simply because perjury
is part of the means for perpetrating the fraud." This means that while
perjury alone might not be a RICO predicate, when it is part of a broader
fraudulent scheme that qualifies as a RICO predicate (such as mail fraud or
wire fraud), the perjurious acts can be included in the RICO violation. 113.
Similarly, ASI, Inc. v. Aquawood, LLC, Civil No. 19-763 (JRT/HB) (D. Minn.
Oct 05, 2020) confirms that "although perjury alone is not a predicate act
under RICO, courts have found that false litigation documents can support a
mail/wire fraud RICO claim." The court further found that "submission of
false litigation documents, in conjunction with a broader RICO scheme, can
be a predicate act." In this case, that is exactly the conduct at issue. 114.
More explicitly, C & W Constr. Co. v. Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners,
Local 745, 687 F.Supp. 1453 (D.Haw.1988) stated that "the more reasoned
rule would allow perjury to be a predicate act under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(1),
through 18 U.S.C. § 1503, where the plaintiffs allege that the perjury was
part of the pattern of racketeering." 115. The case of Florida Evergreen
Foliage v. Ei Du Pont De Nemours, 135 F.Supp.2d 1271 (S.D. Fla. 2001)
further supports this view, noting that "defendants have not been able to
direct the Court to any federal cases specifically holding that litigation
conduct by a litigating party in a prior case is entitled to absolute immunity
and may not form the basis of a subsequent federal civil RICO claim." The
court was persuaded that perjury could be a predicate act under RICO
"where the plaintiffs allege that the perjury was part of the pattern of
racketeering." 116. Furthermore, United States v. Hansmeier, Case No. 0:16-
cr-00334-JNE-KMM (D. Minn. Jul 24, 2017) explicitly rejected the notion that
civil litigation conduct cannot form the basis of criminal charges, stating
that "federal law criminalizes any number of actions that are conducted in
relation to litigation, including most obviously committing or suborning
perjury." The court cited multiple cases affirming mail fraud charges based
on conduct in civil lawsuits, establishing that perjury in litigation can be part
of a broader fraudulent scheme that constitutes a RICO predicate. B. Myers'
Actions as Perjury Under 18 U.S.C. § 1621 and § 1623 117. First, Myers
made several statements under oath in a judicial proceeding, satisfying the
first element of perjury under both statutes. 118. Second, several statements
were made with knowledge of their falsities, including: i. Myers intentionally
lied about her financial status and knowingly falsified her financial
obligations in her Affidavit of Indigency. ii. Myers intentionally lied about the
existence of an active order of protection that she knew did not exist. iii.
Myers intentionally lied about cohabitation with the Plaintiff when she
stated that the couples stopped living together as spouses on December 1,
2023, when she continued to cohabitate up until his unlawful removal
caused by her false statements. Picture evidence establishes this and there
is no defense to these false statements. iv. Myers intentionally lied about her
separate property when she claimed both vehicles that Plaintiff pays for
were her separate property prior to the marriage, which is a blatant
misrepresentation as one of the vehicles was leased in 2022, and the other
was financed in 2020, five years after the marriage took place. v. Myers
intentionally fabricated multiple claims of family violence occurring, yet has
no evidence to support these claims. These claims satisfy the second
element of perjury, materiality. These statements were material to the

=== PAGE 16 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
court’s determination of the legitimacy of financial transactions and the
authenticity of court documents, satisfying the this requirement under both
statutes. 119. Third, Myers' perjurious statements were made knowingly and
intentionally, as evidenced by her coordination with Branthoover and
concealment of bank account information. This satisfies the willful intent
requirement, which the Supreme Court has defined as "false testimony
concerning a material matter with the willful intent to provide false
testimony, rather than as a result of confusion, mistake, or faulty memory."
In re Alvarado, 26 I&N Dec. 895 (citing Dunnigan, 507 U.S. at 94). 120. One
minor mistake by Myers would have defeated the intent argument. However,
because several misrepresentations were made across several pleadings
with the intent to have Plaintiff removed from his home, and the fact that
these documents were specifically prepared in part by Branthoover, it
highlights not only a broader scheme, but shows malicious intent especially
when paired with the threatening text messages. C. The Perjurious
Statements Were Part of a Broader Scheme to Defraud 121. In Myers' case,
her perjurious statements were made as part of a broader fraudulent
scheme, as explained above, that involved: i. Financial transactions
(transferring $1,576 from a joint marital account to Branthoover's PayPal
account) ii. Interstate travel for the purpose of preparing fraudulent court
documents iii. Preparation and filing of fraudulent court documents iv.
Concealment of financial information 122. This pattern of activity is part of a
broader, coordinated scheme with Branthoover to defraud the court and
were designed to remove Plaintiff from his residence. Because this perjury
occurred within a scheme that involved enumerated predicate acts,
including wire fraud and the Travel Act, Myers' perjury can be included as
part of the pattern of racketeering activity required for this RICO claim. 123.
In summary, the specificity of Myers’ false statements, the context in which
they were made, and the supporting documentary evidence (bank records,
PayPal records, text messages, phone records) provide strong support for
both perjury prosecution under federal law and inclusion in a RICO claim as
part of a broader pattern of racketeering activity. XI. PATTERN OF
RACKETEERING ACTIVITY A. The Defendants' Activities Satisfy the
"Relatedness" Requirement 124. The enumerated facts above clearly
demonstrate that the predicate acts committed by Defendants Myers and
Branthoover are related under the standard established in H.J. Inc. The
alleged predicate acts share multiple elements of relatedness: i. Same
Purpose: All of the acts were committed with the purpose of "unlawfully
depriving Plaintiff of property and rights." As noted in RICO: A Primer
(2022), acts that "further[] the goals of or benefitted the enterprise" can
establish relatedness. Here, the coordinated scheme to manipulate judicial
proceedings demonstrates a common purpose. ii. Same Participants: The
acts all involve the same defendants, Myers and Branthoover. Similar
participants is one factor that can establish relatedness. iii. Same Victim: All
of the acts target the same victim, the Plaintiff. The consistent targeting of a
single victim further supports the relatedness of the acts. iv. Similar
Methods: The defendants employed similar methods across their activities,
including fraudulent court filings, wire fraud, interstate travel and
communications in furtherance of the scheme, and intimidation after the
scheme was successful, in part. 125. The case of Verges v. Babovich, 644
F.Supp. 150 (E.D. La. 1986) supports the conclusion that these facts
establish relatedness. In that case, the court found that allegations of a

=== PAGE 17 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
coordinated scheme with similar elements were sufficient to establish a
"pattern of racketeering activity" under RICO. B. The Defendants' Activities
Satisfy the "Continuity" Requirement 126. The facts above also demonstrate
that the defendants' activities satisfy the continuity requirement under both
the closed-ended and open-ended frameworks. 127. Closed-ended continuity
requires "a series of related predicates extending over a substantial period
of time," as explained in Egana v. Blair's Bail Bonds Inc, The activities of
Defendants Myers and Branthoover span from December 2023 through May
2025, a period of approximately 18 months. 128. While there is no bright-
line rule defining a "substantial period," courts generally require more than
a few weeks or months. The 18-month period described in the facts meets
this threshold. See Reynolds v. Condon, 908 F.Supp. 1494 (N.D. W.Va. 1996).
129. Beyond closed-ended continuity, the facts also support a finding of
open-ended continuity, which focuses on "a threat of continuing criminal
activity extending indefinitely into the future”. 130. The ongoing nature of
the threats and intimidation, as well as the continued illicit communications
and monitoring of the Plaintiff's legal actions, suggest that the criminal
activity is not limited to a finite period but threatens to continue into the
future. Open-ended continuity can be established if "the related predicates
themselves involve a distinct threat of long-term racketeering activity, either
implicit or explicit." Here, the fact that the divorce matter has not been
adjudicated on the merits and the specific threat from Branthoover stating
“[w]hen this is all over, you get to deal with me. Just a heads up” which
creates a future risk of further criminal activity. In other words, even if the
State court proceedings eventually conclude, the pattern of behavior
suggests that the defendants might continue their harassment and
intimidation of the Plaintiff through subsequent litigation or criminal
activity. C. Meeting Both Closed-Ended and Open-Ended Continuity 131. It is
significant that the facts establish both closed-ended and open-ended
continuity, although either one alone would be sufficient to satisfy the
continuity requirement under H.J. Inc. 132. The fact that the scheme is not
an isolated event but a series of related acts over a substantial period, with
evidence of ongoing and future threats, serves to reinforce the conclusion
that the continuity requirement is satisfied. The combined presence of both
closed-ended and open-ended continuity provides a robust basis for finding
that the defendants' activities constitute a pattern of racketeering activity
under RICO. 133. In summary, the enumerated facts and predicate acts
establish a "pattern of racketeering activity" under RICO, meeting both the
relatedness and continuity requirements as interpreted by the Supreme
Court and federal courts. X. THE MYERS-BRANTHOOVER ENTERPRISE
134. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations
contained in paragraphs 1 through 133 above, as if fully set forth herein.
135. Having already established the pattern of racketeering activity in the
previous sections, the present analysis focuses on the enterprise element
and how it is satisfied by the facts of this case. 136. The association between
Myers and Branthoover constitutes an enterprise under RICO, as it exhibits
all the required structural features: a common purpose, relationships among
the associates, and sufficient longevity to pursue the enterprise's purpose.
A. Common Purpose 137. The first structural feature of a RICO enterprise is
a common purpose among its members. According to United States v.
Gershman, 31 F.4th 80 (2nd Cir. 2022), an enterprise must have "a purpose,
relationships among those associated with the enterprise, and longevity

=== PAGE 18 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
sufficient to permit these associates to pursue the enterprise's purpose."
138. The enumerated facts demonstrate that Myers and Branthoover shared
a common purpose: to manipulate judicial proceedings through fraudulent
documents and coordinated deception to deprive Plaintiff of his property
rights. This purpose is evident through their coordinated actions: i. On
December 14, 2023, they engaged in intensive interstate communications
(92 text messages) while Myers simultaneously attempted to obtain an ex-
parte protective order against Plaintiff without legitimate cause. ii. During
their phone conversation on December 15, 2023, Branthoover established
the "operational framework" for the criminal scheme, arranging for Myers to
visit Oklahoma for the purpose of coordinating fraudulent document
preparation under the guise of offering Plaintiff assistance. iii. Defendants
collaborated in preparing multiple fraudulent court documents during
Myers' visit to Oklahoma, including the Original Petition for Divorce,
Affidavit of Indigency, Request for Uncontested Cases, and Application for
Protective Order. iv. Defendants collaborated in transferring $1,576 of
marital funds from a joint-marital bank account across state lines using
Branthoover’s PayPal account to conceal the end location of the funds. v. The
funds were used to purchase a second phone for Myers in furtherance of the
scheme, which was the phone number used on the documents at issue. iv.
The coordinated timing of the eviction notice service in Texas while Myers
was in Oklahoma with Branthoover preparing the court documents
referenced in that notice. 139. The coordination of their activities
demonstrates a mutual understanding and shared objective, which satisfies
the common purpose requirement for an enterprise. The specific goal of
RICO is to punish the use of an enterprise to engage in certain criminal
activities. Here, the enterprise's goal was to use fraudulent means to secure
outcomes favorable to Myers in the divorce proceedings and to deprive
Plaintiff of his property rights, which resulted in direct and ongoing
damages to his business operations. B. Relationships Among Associates 140.
The second structural feature of a RICO enterprise is the existence of
relationships among those associated with the enterprise. The facts
demonstrate clear relationships between Myers and Branthoover: i. Their
extensive communications (92 text messages on December 14, 2023)
indicate a close working relationship. ii. Branthoover's role as an
administrative coordinator is evident from his statement, "I hope I can help
with the paperwork and make things go as smoothly as possible," and his
later message attempting to control communications by stating, "all further
communication should take place between attorneys. I must formally ask
you refrain from discussing details of this case with my client moving
forward and only communicate with me or your attorney." iii. Myers trusted
Branthoover enough to travel interstate to his residence for the purpose of
preparing fraudulent documents. iv. Branthoover had direct access to
marital funds through the PayPal transfer. v. Their relationship continued
over an 18-month period, with Branthoover continuing to monitor Plaintiff's
court filings and sending threatening messages as recently as May 24, 2025.
141. These facts indicate a structured relationship with defined roles:
Branthoover provided administrative oversight and guidance on legal
matters (despite not being a licensed attorney), while Myers implemented
the scheme through filing fraudulent documents and executing financial
transactions. This division of labor is characteristic of an enterprise under
RICO. C. Longevity Sufficient to Pursue the Enterprise's Purpose 142. The

=== PAGE 19 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
third structural feature of a RICO enterprise is longevity sufficient to permit
the associates to pursue the enterprise's purpose. The facts demonstrate
that the association between Myers and Branthoover had substantial
longevity: i. Their coordinated activities began on December 14, 2023, with
intensive communications and Myers' attempt to obtain an ex-parte
protective order. ii. Their association continued through Myers' visit to
Oklahoma on December 15-17, 2023, where they prepared fraudulent court
documents. iii. The enterprise achieved its primary objective on January 16,
2024, when Plaintiff was ordered to vacate the family residence. iv.
Branthoover continued to monitor Plaintiff's court filings and send
threatening messages on June 23, 2024, December 12, 2024, and most
recently on May 24, 2025. 143. This timeline establishes an enterprise that
operated continuously for approximately 18 months, from December 2023
through May 2025, and remains ongoing. This period is sufficient to
demonstrate the longevity required for a RICO enterprise, as it allowed the
associates to pursue and achieve their common purpose of manipulating
judicial proceedings to deprive Plaintiff of his property rights. The longevity
of their association is not merely incidental but is directly tied to the
ongoing nature of their scheme. As the divorce proceedings continued, so
did their coordinated efforts to maintain the advantages gained through
their initial fraudulent actions. 144. This ongoing relationship demonstrates
that the enterprise was not formed for a one-time transaction but was
designed to operate over time to achieve and maintain their objectives. D.
Interstate Commerce Connection 145. For a RICO violation, the enterprise's
activities must affect interstate commerce. According to Wanamaker v.
Columbian Rope Co., 740 F.Supp. 127 (N.D. N.Y. 1990), one of the essential
elements of a RICO claim is that "the activities of [the enterprise] affect
interstate commerce or foreign commerce." The facts clearly establish the
interstate nature of the enterprise's activities: i. Myers and Branthoover
engaged in intensive interstate communications (92 text messages) between
Texas and Oklahoma on December 14, 2023. ii. Myers traveled from Texas to
Oklahoma on December 15, 2023, specifically for the purpose of preparing
fraudulent court documents. iii. Myers transferred $1,576 from the joint
marital PNC account to Branthoover's PayPal account, which constitutes a
transaction in interstate commerce. iv. Myers transported the fraudulent
documents prepared in Oklahoma back to Texas on December 17, 2023. v.
Branthoover continued to communicate with Plaintiff and Myers across state
lines regarding the court proceedings through May 2025. 146. These
interstate activities are not incidental but are central to the enterprise's
operations. The enterprise deliberately used interstate travel and
communications to facilitate its fraudulent scheme, thereby satisfying the
interstate commerce requirement of RICO. 5. Structure Beyond Mere
Pattern of Racketeering 147. It is important for Plaintiff to note that an
enterprise must be more than merely the pattern of racketeering activity; it
must have some structure beyond what is necessary to commit the predicate
acts. The facts demonstrate that the Myers-Branthoover enterprise had such
a structure: i. The enterprise employed operational security measures,
including Myers' acquisition of a secondary phone number during her
Oklahoma visit, which became an integral component of the fraudulent court
documents. ii. The enterprise had a division of labor, with Branthoover
providing administrative oversight and guidance based on his extensive
knowledge of protective order procedures and requirements, while Myers

=== PAGE 20 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
implemented the scheme through filing documents and executing financial
transactions. iii. The enterprise demonstrated sophisticated coordination,
such as the timing of the eviction notice service in Texas while Myers was in
Oklahoma with Branthoover. iv. The enterprise employed deception to
maintain operational security, with Myers creating a facade of normalcy"by
reminding Plaintiff of their child's school field trip while simultaneously
seeking an emergency protection order against him, and with Branthoover
misleading Plaintiff that, as he put it, “help both of you”. 148. These
structural features go beyond what would be necessary to simply commit the
predicate acts of wire fraud, Travel Act violations, and perjury. They
demonstrate an organized association with defined roles, operational
procedures, and coordination mechanisms—all hallmarks of an enterprise
under RICO. 149. The three structural features identified in United States v.
Gershman, 31 F.4th 80 (2nd Cir. 2022) — purpose, relationships, and
longevity — are present in the Myers-Branthoover enterprise, as
demonstrated above. These features are derived from the Supreme Court's
decision in Boyle v. United States, which is binding on all federal courts,
including those in the 10th Circuit. 150. The broad definition of "enterprise"
in 18 U.S.C. § 1961 (2025) as including "any union or group of individuals
associated in fact although not a legal entity" clearly encompasses the
Myers-Branthoover relationship. This statutory definition applies uniformly
across all federal circuits, including the 10th Circuit. XI. DISTINGUISHING
FEATURES OF THE ENTERPRISE 151. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates
by reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 150 above,
as if fully set forth herein. A. Coordination and Planning 152. The enterprise
demonstrated a high level of coordination and planning: i. The intensive
communications (92 text messages) on December 14, 2023, indicate detailed
planning of their scheme. ii. Branthoover's deceptive phone call to Plaintiff
on December 15, 2023, was designed to establish false pretenses for Myers'
interstate travel. iii. The coordination of the eviction notice service in Texas
while Myers was in Oklahoma preparing the fraudulent documents
referenced in that notice. iv. The systematic preparation of multiple
fraudulent court documents, including the Original Petition for Divorce,
Affidavit of Indigency, Request for Uncontested Cases, and Application for
Protective Order. 153. This level of coordination distinguishes their
relationship from mere parallel conduct by independent actors and supports
the conclusion that they were operating as an enterprise. B. Ongoing
Operations and Adaptation 154. The enterprise demonstrated ongoing
operations and the ability to adapt to changing circumstances: i. After
achieving their primary objective (Plaintiff's removal from the residence) on
January 16, 2024, they continued their coordinated activities to maintain the
advantages gained through their fraudulent actions. ii. Branthoover
continued to monitor Plaintiff's court filings and send threatening messages
over an extended period, with messages on June 23, 2024, December 12,
2024, and May 24, 2025. iii. The enterprise adapted its tactics over time,
moving from fraudulent document preparation to ongoing harassment and
intimidation to discourage Plaintiff from seeking relief. 155. This ongoing
operation and ability to adapt further distinguish their relationship from a
one-time collaboration and support the conclusion that they constituted an
enterprise under RICO. C. Specific Roles and Responsibilities 156. The
enterprise demonstrated specific roles and responsibilities for its members:
i. Branthoover served as the administrative coordinator and legal advisor,

=== PAGE 21 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
leveraging his extensive knowledge of protective order procedures and
requirements to guide the preparation of fraudulent documents. ii. Myers
served as the implementer, filing the fraudulent documents, executing
financial transactions, and using her position as Plaintiff's spouse to access
marital assets and file court documents against him. 157. This division of
labor is characteristic of an enterprise under RICO and distinguishes their
relationship from a casual association. 158. In sum, the Myers-Branthoover
relationship satisfies the enterprise requirement under RICO, as interpreted
by the Supreme Court and federal courts nationwide, including the 10th
Circuit. Their coordinated activities from December 2023 through May 2025
demonstrate the existence of an association-in-fact enterprise engaged in a
pattern of racketeering activity, which is precisely the type of criminal
organization that RICO was designed to address. 159. Finally, Plaintiff must
show that he suffered direct injury to his business or property as a direct
result of the Defendant’s racketeering activity. X. Damages 160. Plaintiff
realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations contained in
paragraphs 1 through 133 above, as if fully set forth herein. 161. As a direct
result of the racketeering activity alleged herein, the Plaintiff has sustained
substantial injury to his business operations, suffered significant credit
decrease, has lost business opportunities, had his personal belongings
destroyed, has had one vehicle repossessed, and has been subject to
transient and unstable housing. A. Damage to Business Operations 162. In
January of 2021, Plaintiff founded a digital financial analytics business from
his home, focused on delivering real-time stock market data, automated
technical indicators, and live market commentary to retail traders and
boutique investment groups across the United States and Canada. His
monetization model included tiered subscription plans, custom data feed
licensing, and API endpoints. 163. By 2022, client demand and revenue
growth began outpacing Plaintiff’s initial architecture. In response, Plaintiff
made the strategic decision to pause direct monetization in early 2023 to
reinvest in infrastructure and ensure the platform could handle commercial-
scale traffic. This included: i. Designing and deploying asynchronous
financial signal algorithms, ii. Mastering PostgreSQL and NoSQL systems
for real-time data delivery, iii. Building websocket-based dashboards for live
data streaming, iv. Drafting licensing terms for premium indicator access
and reseller API use. This period of reinvestment came at significant cost:
Plaintiff temporarily sacrificed a revenue stream that had reached $12,000
per month at its peak in exchange for long-term scalability. Plaintiff
anticipated a short-term revenue dip, which he strategically absorbed in
reliance on his imminent reentry to market. 164. By the summer of 2023,
Plaintiff had completed core backend optimization and UI integrations and
was prepared to scale user acquisition and marketing. This readiness
marked a significant inflection point in Plaintiff’s commercial trajectory. 165.
Plaintiff reasonably projected a return to $9,000–$10,000/month by
mid-2024, with a 24-month growth model targeting $170,124.59 in revenue
through subscriptions and data services alone. This forecast was based not
on speculation, but on verified revenue history, platform readiness, and
documented user engagement trends. 166. As part of Defendants’
coordinated scheme to deprive Plaintiff of his home and operational
capacity, Plaintiff was wrongfully and suddenly removed from the family
residence in January 2024, despite Defendants’ full knowledge that he
operated an active and income-generating business from that location. This

=== PAGE 22 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
action caused a direct and immediate injury to Plaintiff’s business, cutting
off his ability to scale as planned. Instead of growing, Plaintiff’s revenue
collapsed. 167. The removal was executed without warning or legal
justification and had an immediate effect on Plaintiff’s operations. Although
the core data systems were technically portable, the business depended on
commercial-grade internet, low-latency upload speeds, and a consistent,
uninterrupted digital environment to support real-time financial analytics,
streaming, and API-based services. Following the removal, Plaintiff was
unable to find alternate housing with sufficient bandwidth. Attempts to work
from temporary family residences failed, as Plaintiff’s usage either exceeded
available internet capacity or interfered with household connectivity, making
it impossible to maintain stable service. Without the ability to stream,
deliver data products, or support his clients, Plaintiff's revenue quickly
declined and client engagement deteriorated. 168. Between September and
December 2023, Plaintiff earned $10,529.72, averaging $2,632.43 per
month after reactivating his business operations. Based on the platform’s
performance, technical stability, and confirmed subscriber growth, Plaintiff
reasonably projected returning to $5,000/month by mid-2024, with stable
performance continuing through 2025. 169. Under a conservative model,
had the business not been disrupted by Defendants’ interference, Plaintiff
would have earned: i. Approximately $15,794.58 during the first half of 2024
(maintaining his pre-removal baseline), ii. Approximately $24,000.00 during
the second half of 2024 (with moderate growth to $4,000/month), iii. And
approximately $60,000.00 across 2025 (at $5,000/month). This yields a total
projected income of $99,794.58 for the 24-month period following the
wrongful removal. 170. Instead, Plaintiff earned only $14,892.27 across that
period due to his inability to operate at scale. This results in a verified,
direct business revenue loss of $84,902.31. 171. Accordingly, Plaintiff seeks
recovery of $84,902.31 in lost business income directly caused by
Defendants’ pattern of racketeering activity described above. B. Cost of
Living Increase – Proximity to Children 172. Between March and June of
2024, Plaintiff resided with his grandmother in Garland, Texas while he
sought relief from the State courts. By July of 2024, Plaintiff’s grandmother
sold her home and moved into a small apartment, leaving Plaintiff without
any place to stay. 173. Because no family member could offer reliable
housing—due in part to Plaintiff’s internet bandwidth requirements and the
sensitive nature of the litigation—Plaintiff was forced to rely on a series of
short-term Airbnb rentals between July and October 2024 so that he could
reside near-by his daughters and provide them with a stable environment as
he sought relief. 174. Verified receipts show that Plaintiff incurred a total of
$14,553.89 in temporary housing costs during this period. These expenses
were not discretionary but were directly caused by the Defendants’ actions
that: i. Deprived Plaintiff of access to his lawful residence, ii. Created legal
uncertainty regarding custody, iii. And required proximity to the children to
preserve parental rights and the status quo. C. Damages – Fraudulent
Transfer of $1,576 and Cessation of Business Advertisements 175. As noted
above, Defendants coordinated in emptying the joint marital PNC bank
account, transferring $1,576.00 from Plaintiff to a PayPal account controlled
by Daniel Kenneth Branthoover, which was subsequently routed to Morgan
Michelle Myers. These funds were used to purchase a second phone for
Myers, enabling concealed communication and coordination between
Defendants in furtherance of their scheme to defraud Plaintiff and obstruct

=== PAGE 23 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
his business operations. 176. At the time of the transfer, Plaintiff was in the
final stages of preparing to relaunch his business. The stolen funds were
earmarked for early 2024 digital ad campaigns, Christmas presents, planned
platform upgrades, and onboarding expenses designed to expand subscriber
reach, as explained to Branthoover. The sudden and unauthorized
withdrawal of this capital forced Plaintiff to cancel scheduled promotional
placements and postpone key infrastructure expenses necessary for
business continuity. 177. Based on Plaintiff’s historical subscriber
acquisition cost and prior return on advertising spend (ROAS), the canceled
campaigns were projected to generate $5,000.00–$7,000.00 in new
subscriber revenue during the first quarter of 2024. A conservative midpoint
estimate places the value of this lost opportunity at $5,000.00. 178. Plaintiff
therefore seeks recovery of: i. The full amount of the fraudulently
transferred $1,576.00. D. Damages – Total 179. As a direct result of the
Defendants’ coordinated and fraudulent conduct detailed above, Plaintiff has
sustained total economic losses in the amount of one hundred ten thousand
five hundred thirty-two dollars and twenty cents ($110,532.20). This
includes: i. $84,902.31 in lost business income caused by Plaintiff’s wrongful
removal from his residence and the destruction of his operational
infrastructure; ii. $14,553.89 in necessary temporary housing expenses
incurred to remain near his daughters and preserve the parent-child
relationship while deprived of access to his home; iii. $1,576.00 in marital
funds fraudulently transferred from Plaintiff’s joint bank account without
consent and used by Defendants in furtherance of the fraudulent scheme; iv.
$5,000.00 in estimated lost income resulting from the forced cancellation of
business advertisements due to the diversion of business capital; and v.
$4,500.00 in legal and procedural costs incurred by Plaintiff in defending
against the initial, baseless protective order proceedings filed by Defendant
Myers, which were weaponized to gain leverage in the underlying divorce
litigation. 180. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c), Plaintiff is entitled to treble
damages for injuries sustained to his business and property because of
Defendants’ racketeering activity. Accordingly, Plaintiff seeks an award of
treble damages in the total estimated amount of three hundred thirty-one
thousand five hundred ninety-six dollars and sixty cents ($331,596.60) to be
further clarified at trial. 181. All damages referenced herein are based on
verifiable records and financial documentation. Plaintiff will produce
supporting evidence and exhibits at the appropriate stage of these
proceedings or at trial. XIII. CONCLUSION AND PRAYER Respectfully

Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
Based on the provided legal materials, I would grade this civil RICO
complaint a 6 out of 10, as it contains well-structured allegations but faces
significant legal challenges in establishing predicate acts, demonstrating a

clear enterprise distinct from the pattern of racketeering activity, and
proving damages to business or property directly caused by the alleged
RICO violations.
Summary
The complaint filed by Charles Dustin Myers against Daniel Kenneth
Branthoover and Morgan Michelle Myers attempts to establish a civil RICO
claim based on allegations of wire fraud, Travel Act violations, and perjury
as predicate acts forming a pattern of racketeering activity. The plaintiff
meticulously details a series of interconnected events spanning
approximately 18 months that allegedly constitute an enterprise between
the defendants designed to manipulate judicial proceedings in Texas family
courts and deprive the plaintiff of his property interests.
While the complaint demonstrates strength in its detailed factual allegations
and attempts to establish relatedness and continuity of the alleged predicate
acts, it faces several significant legal hurdles. These include the
questionable status of perjury as a RICO predicate act, potential difficulties
in establishing an enterprise distinct from the pattern of racketeering
activity itself, and challenges in demonstrating that the alleged injuries to
business and property were directly caused by RICO violations rather than
by the underlying divorce proceedings.
Background and Relevant Law
Statutory Framework
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) provides
both criminal penalties and civil remedies for specific prohibited activities.
Under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c), "any person injured in his business or property
by reason of a violation of section 1962 of this chapter may sue therefor in
any appropriate United States district court and shall recover threefold the
damages he sustains and the cost of the suit, including a reasonable
attorney's fee."
To establish a civil RICO claim, a plaintiff must demonstrate several
essential elements. According to 18 U.S.C. § 1962, "it shall be unlawful for
any person through a pattern of racketeering activity or through collection
of an unlawful debt to acquire or maintain, directly or indirectly, any interest
in or control of any enterprise which is engaged in, or the activities of which
affect, interstate or foreign commerce."
The statute defines key terms relevant to this analysis. 18 U.S.C. § 1961
defines "racketeering activity" to include "any act which is indictable under
any of the following provisions of title 18, United States Code: ... section
1343 (relating to wire fraud), ... section 1512 (relating to tampering with a
witness, victim, or an informant), section 1513 (relating to retaliating
against a witness, victim, or an informant)." Additionally, a "pattern of
racketeering activity" requires "at least two acts of racketeering activity, one
of which occurred after the effective date of this chapter and the last of

=== PAGE 25 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
which occurred within ten years (excluding any period of imprisonment)
after the commission of a prior act of racketeering activity."
18 U.S.C. § 1965 addresses venue and process, stating that "Any civil action
or proceeding under this chapter against any person may be instituted in the
district court of the United States for any district in which such person
resides, is found, has an agent, or transacts his affairs."
Case Law Interpretation
Courts have consistently articulated several key elements required for a
successful RICO claim. As noted in Fedorova v. Foley (W.D. Mich. 2023),
"[u]nder 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), it is 'unlawful for any person employed by or
associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect,
interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or
indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of
racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt.' Put differently, a
violation of this statute requires: '(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3)
through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity.'"
This four-part test is consistently applied across jurisdictions. In Williams v.
Graves Cnty. (W.D. Ky. 2021), the court explained that "[t]o state a RICO
claim, a plaintiff must allege '(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a
pattern (4) of racketeering activity.'" The court further noted that RICO
defines "racketeering activity" to include various criminal acts, and that "[a]
pattern of racketeering activity requires, at minimum, two acts of
racketeering activity within ten years of each other."
Importantly, courts have established that the pattern requirement involves
more than just numerical sufficiency. In German Free State of Bavaria v.
Toyobo Co., Ltd. (W.D. Mich. 2007), the court specified that "to sustain a
RICO violation claim, a plaintiff must show: (1) two or more predicate
offenses; (2) the existence of an enterprise; (3) a nexus between the pattern
of racketeering and the enterprise; and (4) an injury caused by the other
three factors."
Enterprise Requirement
The enterprise element is particularly critical in RICO claims. In SAAP
Energy v. Bell (W.D. Ky. 2013), the court explained that a RICO enterprise
"includes any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal
entity, and any union of individuals associated in fact although not a legal
entity." The court further noted that the RICO concept of an enterprise is
"obviously broad, encompassing 'any... group of individuals associated in
fact.'"
The structure of a RICO enterprise "must have at least three... features: a
purpose, relationships among those associated with the enterprise, and
longevity sufficient to permit these associates to pursue the enterprise's
purpose." However, this "organizational structure need not be hierarchical,
can make decisions on an ad hoc basis, and does not require the members to

=== PAGE 26 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
have fixed roles." The plaintiff must simply show "a continuing unit that
functions with a common purpose."
It's essential that an enterprise be distinct from the pattern of racketeering
activity itself. As stated in German Free State of Bavaria v. Toyobo Co., Ltd.,
"to satisfy the enterprise requirement, an association-in-fact must be an on-
going organization, its members must function as a continuing unit, and it
must be separate from the pattern of racketeering activity in which it
engages."
Pattern of Racketeering Activity
The pattern requirement for RICO claims has been interpreted to require
both "relatedness" and "continuity" of predicate acts. According to Williams
v. Graves Cnty., a pattern of racketeering activity "also requires a showing
'that the racketeering predicates are related, and that they amount to or
pose a threat of continued criminal activity.'"
In Pemberton v. Walker (W.D. Wis. 2024), the court emphasized that "the
Supreme Court has emphasized that RICO was enacted in response to 'long-
term criminal conduct,' not isolated or sporadic unlawful activity." This
highlights the continuity aspect of the pattern requirement.
As explained in Hall American Center Associates v. Dick (W.D. Mich. 1989),
"The mere proof of two predicate acts, however, does not establish a
pattern." The court noted that "the legislative history supports the view that
two isolated acts of racketeering activity do not constitute a pattern. As the
Senate Report explained: 'The target of RICO is thus not sporadic activity.
The infiltration of legitimate business normally requires more than one
'racketeering activity' and the threat of continuing activity to be effective. It
is this factor of continuity plus relationship which combines to produce a
pattern."
Civil RICO Requirements
For a civil RICO claim to succeed, the plaintiff must demonstrate injury to
business or property directly caused by the RICO violation. As stated in 
STATE OF MICH., DEPT. OF TREASURY v. Fawaz (W.D. Mich. 1986), "The
treble damage provision presupposes an underlying compensable injury to
be trebled."
Additionally, allegations involving fraud must be pled with particularity.
According to Barry Aviation v. Land O'Lakes Municipal Airport (W.D. Wis.
2005), a plaintiff must "allege with particularity facts showing a pattern of
racketeering" when the predicate acts involve fraud.

Analysis of the Complaint
Jurisdiction and Venue
The complaint properly establishes jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c),
which grants federal courts jurisdiction over civil RICO actions. Venue is
appropriately asserted under 18 U.S.C. § 1965(a), which permits RICO
actions to be brought in any district where the defendant "resides, is found,
has an agent, or transacts his affairs." Defendant Branthoover is alleged to
reside in Canadian County, Oklahoma, which falls within the Western
District of Oklahoma.
Alleged Predicate Acts
The complaint identifies three primary categories of alleged predicate acts:
wire fraud, Travel Act violations, and perjury. Each requires separate
analysis:
Wire Fraud
Wire fraud is a recognized predicate act under 18 U.S.C. § 1961, which
specifically includes "section 1343 (relating to wire fraud)" as a racketeering
activity. The complaint alleges that Myers transferred $1,576 from a joint
marital bank account to Branthoover's PayPal account, depleting the
account entirely. This transfer allegedly occurred via interstate wire and was
accompanied by interstate text messages and phone calls between Myers
and Branthoover.
To establish wire fraud as a predicate act, the complaint must demonstrate:
(1) a scheme to defraud, (2) use of interstate wire communications, and (3)
intent to defraud. The interstate nature of the communications and transfer
is well-established in the complaint, satisfying the second element.
However, the first and third elements may face challenges. Myers, as a joint
account holder, likely had legal authority to transfer funds from the account.
While the complaint alleges that this transfer was part of a broader
fraudulent scheme, it must establish that the transfer itself was fraudulent
rather than merely a marital dispute over shared assets. The intent to
defraud is alleged through the coordination between Myers and Branthoover
and the timing of the transfer in relation to the divorce proceedings.
Travel Act Violations
The complaint alleges that Myers traveled from Texas to Oklahoma to
prepare fraudulent court documents with Branthoover's assistance, then
returned to Texas with these documents. This interstate travel is alleged to
satisfy the elements of a Travel Act violation.
The Travel Act is included in 18 U.S.C. § 1961 as a predicate act for RICO
purposes, specifically under "section 1952 (relating to racketeering)." To
establish a Travel Act violation, the complaint must show: (1) interstate

=== PAGE 28 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
travel or use of interstate facilities, (2) intent to promote unlawful activity,
and (3) subsequent acts in furtherance of the unlawful activity.
The interstate travel is clearly alleged, satisfying the first element. The
complaint also alleges subsequent acts in filing the allegedly fraudulent
documents in Texas courts, potentially satisfying the third element.
However, the second element—intent to promote unlawful activity—may be
more challenging to establish. The complaint must demonstrate that the
purpose of Myers' travel was specifically to engage in unlawful activity,
rather than simply to consult with a friend or advisor about divorce
proceedings.
Perjury
The complaint alleges that Myers made numerous false statements in sworn
court documents, including misrepresentations about her financial status,
the existence of protective orders, cohabitation with the plaintiff, and
property ownership.
Significantly, perjury is not explicitly listed as a predicate act under 18
U.S.C. § 1961. As noted in RICO: A Primer (2022), racketeering activities
include specific enumerated offenses, most commonly "mail and wire fraud."
Perjury is not among these enumerated offenses.
The complaint attempts to address this issue by arguing that perjury can
serve as a RICO predicate when it is part of a broader pattern of
racketeering activity, particularly when connected to fraud schemes that
qualify as RICO predicates. However, this is a tenuous legal position without
clear support in the provided legal materials. The connection between the
alleged perjury and the recognized predicate acts of wire fraud and Travel
Act violations would need to be firmly established to overcome this
challenge.
Pattern of Racketeering Activity
The complaint alleges a pattern of racketeering activity spanning
approximately 18 months, from December 2023 through May 2025. To
establish a pattern, the complaint must demonstrate both "relatedness" and
"continuity" of the predicate acts.
Relatedness
The complaint argues that the predicate acts are related because they share
the same purpose (unlawfully depriving the plaintiff of property and rights),
involve the same participants (Myers and Branthoover), target the same
victim (the plaintiff), and employ similar methods (fraudulent court filings,
wire fraud, and interstate communications).
This approach aligns with the understanding of relatedness as described in 
RICO: A Primer (2022), which notes that racketeering acts need not be
similar or directly related to each other but must be "related in some way to

=== PAGE 29 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
the affairs of the charged enterprise," including acts that "furthered the
goals of or benefitted the enterprise" or had "the same or similar purposes,
results, participants, victims or methods of commission."
Continuity
The complaint argues that both "closed-ended continuity" and "open-ended
continuity" are satisfied. Closed-ended continuity requires "a series of
related predicates extending over a substantial period of time," which the
complaint argues is demonstrated by the approximately 18-month period of
activity.
Open-ended continuity involves a threat of continued criminal activity into
the future, which the complaint argues is shown by ongoing threats and
intimidation from Branthoover, as well as continued monitoring of the
plaintiff's legal actions.
As explained in RACKETEER INFLUENCED AND CORRUPT
ORGANIZATIONS (2021), "A plaintiff can satisfy RICO's pattern requirement
two ways: by alleging a long-running series of interrelated predicate acts
constituting a closed-ended conspiracy; or by alleging at least two
interrelated predicate acts and the distinct threat of continued racketeering
activities, demonstrating an open-ended conspiracy."
The 18-month timeframe alleged in the complaint may be sufficient to
establish closed-ended continuity, as courts generally require more than a
few weeks or months. The ongoing threats and monitoring alleged in the
complaint could potentially support open-ended continuity, suggesting a
threat of continued activity.
Enterprise Allegations
The complaint alleges that the association between Myers and Branthoover
constitutes an enterprise under RICO, exhibiting the required structural
features of common purpose, relationships among associates, and sufficient
longevity.
Common Purpose
The complaint alleges that Myers and Branthoover shared a common
purpose: to manipulate judicial proceedings through fraudulent documents
and coordinated deception to deprive the plaintiff of his property rights. The
intensive communications, coordinated preparation of documents, and
financial transactions are cited as evidence of this common purpose.
Under SAAP Energy v. Bell, an enterprise must have a "purpose,
relationships among those associated with the enterprise, and longevity
sufficient to permit these associates to pursue the enterprise's purpose." The
alleged coordinated activities over an extended period could potentially
satisfy this requirement.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Relationships Among Associates
The complaint details the relationship between Myers and Branthoover,
including extensive communications, Branthoover's administrative role,
Myers' trust in Branthoover evidenced by interstate travel to his residence,
and Branthoover's access to marital funds through the PayPal transfer.
These allegations attempt to establish a structured relationship with defined
roles: Branthoover providing administrative oversight and guidance, and
Myers implementing the scheme through filing documents and executing
financial transactions. This division of labor could potentially satisfy the
relationships requirement.
Longevity
The complaint alleges that the association between Myers and Branthoover
operated continuously for approximately 18 months, from December 2023
through May 2025, allowing them to pursue and achieve their common
purpose of manipulating judicial proceedings to deprive the plaintiff of his
property rights.
This 18-month period may be sufficient to demonstrate the longevity
required for a RICO enterprise, as it allowed the associates to pursue their
alleged common purpose over time.
Structure Beyond Mere Pattern of Racketeering
A critical challenge for the complaint is establishing that the enterprise has
a structure beyond what is necessary to commit the predicate acts. As stated
in German Free State of Bavaria v. Toyobo Co., Ltd., an enterprise "must be
separate from the pattern of racketeering activity in which it engages."
The complaint attempts to address this by alleging structural features such
as operational security measures, division of labor, sophisticated
coordination, and deception to maintain security. These allegations aim to
demonstrate an organized association with defined roles and procedures
beyond what would be necessary to simply commit the alleged predicate
acts.
However, there is a risk that a court might find that the alleged enterprise is
merely the pattern of racketeering activity itself, rather than a distinct
entity. This is a common challenge in RICO cases and could be a significant
weakness in the complaint.
Interstate Commerce Connection
The complaint establishes the interstate nature of the alleged enterprise's
activities through several key allegations: interstate communications
between Texas and Oklahoma, Myers' travel from Texas to Oklahoma, the
interstate transfer of funds, and the transportation of documents across
state lines.

=== PAGE 31 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
As noted in RICO: A Prime (2022), "RICO requires no more than a slight
effect upon interstate commerce." The interstate activities alleged in the
complaint likely satisfy this requirement, as they are central to the
enterprise's operations rather than incidental.
Injury to Business or Property
The complaint alleges substantial injury to the plaintiff's business operations
and property as a direct result of the defendants' racketeering activity.
Specifically, it claims that the plaintiff's digital financial analytics business
was severely impacted when he was forced to vacate his home, resulting in
lost revenue and business opportunities.
Under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c), a civil RICO plaintiff must demonstrate injury to
"business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962." This requires
a direct causal link between the RICO violation and the claimed damages.
The complaint faces a significant challenge in establishing this causal link. It
must demonstrate that the alleged injuries were caused by the RICO
violations themselves, rather than by the divorce proceedings or the court
order requiring the plaintiff to vacate the residence. If the damages were
primarily the result of a legitimate court order, even if that order was based
on allegedly false information, it may be difficult to attribute those damages
directly to the RICO violations.
Additionally, some of the claimed damages, such as temporary housing costs
and emotional distress, may not qualify as injuries to "business or property"
under RICO's strict interpretation of these terms.
Exceptions and Caveats
Perjury as a RICO Predicate
The complaint's reliance on perjury as a RICO predicate act represents a
significant legal challenge. Perjury is not explicitly listed as a predicate act
under 18 U.S.C. § 1961. While the complaint argues that perjury can be
included as part of a broader fraudulent scheme that constitutes a RICO
violation, this argument lacks strong support in the provided legal materials.
Divorce Context
The fact that this case arises from a divorce proceeding adds complexity and
potential limitations. Courts may be hesitant to apply federal RICO statutes
to what could be characterized as a contentious divorce case that would
typically fall under state family court jurisdiction. As suggested in Defending
Civil RICO Claims: A Defense Plan Should Be In Every Business's Arsenal
(2022), "Civil RICO actions are now ubiquitous, so much so that plaintiffs
often attempt to apply the statute to situations that bear little resemblance
to the criminal racketeering activity animating the enactment of the statute
in the first place."

=== PAGE 32 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Causation of Damages
The complaint may face significant challenges in establishing that the
claimed damages were directly caused by the alleged RICO violations. Many
of the damages appear to stem from the court order requiring the plaintiff to
vacate the residence, which, though allegedly based on fraudulent
information, was itself a legitimate judicial action. This intervening cause
could potentially break the chain of causation required for RICO damages.
Conclusion
Based on the provided legal materials, the complaint presented by Charles
Dustin Myers demonstrates both strengths and significant weaknesses
under RICO law. I would grade it a 6 out of 10.
The complaint's strengths include:
Detailed factual allegations spanning an 18-month period
Careful attention to establishing interstate elements
Well-articulated theory of an enterprise with defined roles
Clear allegations of multiple predicate acts
Strong arguments for both relatedness and continuity
However, the complaint faces several significant challenges:
Questionable status of perjury as a RICO predicate act
Potential difficulty distinguishing the enterprise from the pattern of
racketeering activity
Challenges in establishing causation between the alleged RICO
violations and the claimed damages
Possible reluctance of federal courts to apply RICO in what could be
characterized as a divorce dispute
Potential defenses regarding the joint account holder's authority to
transfer funds
While the complaint is well-structured and contains detailed allegations,
these legal challenges could significantly impact its success in federal court.
The plaintiff might face motions to dismiss based on failure to state a claim
under RICO, particularly regarding the predicate acts, enterprise
requirements, and causation of damages.
The complaint would be strengthened by focusing more explicitly on the
wire fraud and Travel Act violations as predicate acts, downplaying the
perjury allegations, and establishing a clearer distinction between the
enterprise and the pattern of racketeering activity. Additionally, a more
direct connection between the RICO violations and the business damages
would enhance the causation argument.

STATE OF MICH., DEPT. OF TREASURY v. Fawaz, 653 F.Supp. 141 (W.D.
Mich. 1986)
U.S. District Court — Western District of Michigan
Extract
On January 6, 1986, the State of Michigan Department of Treasury, Revenue
Division (State of Michigan) instituted this action under the Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C. § 1961-68,
against defendant doing business as West Seven Mile Service and Froggy's
Fill-Up, Inc. The State of Michigan seeks treble damages under § 1964(c).
Before the court is defendant's motion to dismiss, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P.
12(b)(6). 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) prohibits conducting or participating in the
conduct of an enterprise 'through a pattern of racketeering activity.' See
also 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1). Mail fraud, in the form of defendant's mailing of the
fraudulent sales tax returns, indictable under 18 U.S.C. § 1341, is the
predicate offense upon which this action is based. We must now determine
whether the Revenue Division of a single department of the State of
Michigan is a 'person' with standing to pursue federal civil remedies under
RICO, a question of first impression in this circuit. ... Our conclusion that the
Revenue Division lacks standing is further reinforced by the particular facts
of this case. The order of restitution issued against Fawaz by the state
criminal court eliminates, or at least greatly diminishes, the State of
Michigan's 'injury to business or property' as required by § 1964(c). The
State of Michigan responds that the remedy provisions of RICO are
exemplary and not compensatory in nature. This contention is inconsistent
with the very purpose of RICO, to compensate victims of racketeering
activity. The treble damage provision presupposes an underlying
compensable injury to be trebled. See § 1964(c). In light of the foregoing
conclusions, we need not address the remaining issues raised in defendant's
motion. Accordingly, defendant's motion to dismiss will be granted. IT IS SO
ORDERED.
Summary
Requirements for standing under RICO, specifically the need for a
compensable injury to business or property to claim treble damages. It
highlights that the State of Michigan's claim was dismissed due to lack of
standing and compensable injury. This is relevant to the complaint in
question as it involves a RICO claim seeking treble damages, and the
plaintiff must demonstrate a direct injury to business or property to succeed.

U.S. District Court — Western District of Michigan

=== PAGE 34 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
These are, first, that Count 7 fails to allege fraud with the particularity
required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure (F.R.C.P.) 9(b); second, that
Plaintiffs fail to allege an enterprise pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) and §
1961(4) which is separate from the Defendants and the pattern of
racketeering; third, that Plaintiffs fail to assert the racketeering injury they
argue is required by 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c); fourth, that no civil RICO action
lies where there has been no criminal conviction of the predicate acts that
constitute the pattern of racketeering activities; and fifth, that no civil RICO
action can survive without an allegation of organized crime's involvement.
The Court will address each of these seriatum.
Summary
A criminal conviction or organized crime involvement is not necessary for a
civil RICO action. This information is crucial for evaluating the sufficiency of
the complaint in question.

1993)
U.S. District Court — Western District of New York

In order to state a civil claim for damages under RICO, Plaintiff faces two
distinct pleading burdens. First, it must allege that Defendants violated the

(6) an 'enterprise' (7) the activities of which affect interstate or...
Summary
Necessary elements to establish a civil RICO claim, which are relevant to
evaluating the sufficiency of the complaint in question. The complaint must
demonstrate a pattern of racketeering activity, the existence of an
enterprise, and the impact on interstate commerce, among other elements.
Barry Aviation v. Land O'Lakes Municipal Airport, 366 F.Supp.2d 792 (W.D.
Wis. 2005)
U.S. District Court — Western District of Wisconsin

=== PAGE 35 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
Defendants' most substantial argument is that plaintiff failed to allege with
particularity facts showing a pattern of racketeering. A 'pattern of
racketeering activity' 'requires at least two acts of racketeering activity,' 18
U.S.C. § 1961(5); Such acts may encompass any one of the more than forty
state and federal law felonies listed in 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1). In the May 14,
2003 order dismissing plaintiff's first complaint, I held that plaintiff had
failed to point to a single federal statute enumerated in this list that
provided a link to plaintiff's asserted predicate acts. In its second amended
complaint, plaintiff has added allegations implicating mail and wire fraud.
However, as defendants argue, these allegations fail to satisfy the
particularity requirements of Rule 9(b).
Summary
The passage highlights the necessity for a plaintiff to allege predicate acts
with particularity under Rule 9(b) when claiming a pattern of racketeering
activity under RICO. This is relevant to evaluating the complaint in question,
as it involves RICO claims and the need to establish a pattern of
racketeering activity.
Hall American Center Associates v. Dick, 726 F.Supp. 1083 (W.D. Mich.
1989)
U.S. District Court — Western District of Michigan
Extract
The RICO statute defines 'pattern of racketeering activity' as 'at least two
acts of racketeering activity, one of which occurred after October 15, 1970
and the last of which occurred within ten years ... after the commission of a
prior act of racketeering activity.' The mere proof of two predicate acts,
however, does not establish a pattern. In Sedima, 473 U.S. 479, 105 S.Ct.
3275, a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court entered into the fray of providing a
meaningful formulation of the pattern requirement: The legislative history
supports the view that two isolated acts of racketeering activity do not
constitute a pattern. As the Senate Report explained: 'The target of RICO is
thus not sporadic activity. The infiltration of legitimate business normally
requires more than one `racketeering activity' and the threat of continuing
activity to be effective. It is this factor of continuity plus relationship which
combines to produce...
Summary
The passage provides insight into the requirements for establishing a
"pattern of racketeering activity" under the RICO statute. It emphasizes that
merely proving two predicate acts is insufficient; there must be continuity
and a relationship between the acts. This is crucial for evaluating the

=== PAGE 36 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
complaint's adherence to RICO requirements, as the complaint must
demonstrate a pattern of racketeering activity that is not sporadic but
continuous and related.
Fedorova v. Foley
U.S. District Court — Western District of Michigan

As the Magistrate Judge and this Court have previously explained, Under 18
U.S.C. § 1962(c), it is “unlawful for any person employed by or associated
with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or
foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the
conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering
activity or collection of unlawful debt.” Put differently, a violation of this
statute requires: “(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4)

Williams v. Graves Cnty., CIVIL ACTION NO. 5:21-CV-21-TBR (W.D. Ky. Jul
06, 2021)
U.S. District Court — Western District of Kentucky
Extract
To state a RICO claim, a plaintiff must allege '(1) conduct (2) of an
enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity.' Heinrich v.
Waiting Angels Adoption Servs., Inc., 668 F.3d 393, 404 (6th Cir. 2012)
(quoting Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479,496 (1985)). RICO
defines 'racketeering activity' to include, among other things, 'any act or
threat involving murder, kidnapping, gambling, arson, robbery, bribery,
extortion, dealing in obscene matter, or dealing in a controlled substance or
listed chemical. . ., which is chargeable under State law and punishable by
imprisonment for more than one year[.]' 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1)(A). 'A pattern of
racketeering activity requires, at minimum, two acts of racketeering activity
within ten years of each other.' Heinrich, 668 F.3d at 409 (citing 18 U.S.C. §
1961(5)). It also requires a showing ''that the racketeering predicates are

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
related, and that they amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal
activity.'' Id. (quoting H.J. Inc. v. Nw. Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 239 (1989)).
To plausibly state a RICO conspiracy claim, 'plaintiffs must successfully
allege all the elements of a RICO violation, as well as alleging 'the existence
of an illicit agreement to violate the substantive RICO provision.'' Id. at 411
(quoting United States v. Sinito, 723 F.2d 1250, 1260 (6th Cir. 1983)).
Finally, a plaintiff advancing a civil RICO claim must allege injury to
business or property. See 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c).
Summary
Essential elements required to establish a RICO claim: conduct of an
enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity, with at least two acts
of racketeering within ten years, and a threat of continued criminal activity.
It also emphasizes the need for an illicit agreement in conspiracy claims and
the requirement to allege injury to business or property. This framework is
applicable to federal RICO cases and provides a basis for evaluating the
sufficiency of the complaint in question.

Ralston v. Capper, 569 F.Supp. 1575 (W.D. Mich. 1983)
U.S. District Court — Western District of Michigan
Extract
In their motions to dismiss, defendants essentially argue that, although their
activities may literally fall within the words of the RICO Statute, they are not
within its spirit or purpose. They argue that RICO was not intended to

=== PAGE 38 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
provide a federal treble-damage remedy for 'garden variety' state fraud
claims, and cite many U.S. district court cases which evince judicial hostility
towards civil RICO claims... There must be an enterprise, there must be an
effect upon interstate commerce before RICO can come into effect, and
there must also be two predicate offenses. All of the separate elements of a
1962(c) or 1962(d) claim must be proven by plaintiffs, including the
predicate racketeering acts, their impact on interstate commerce, and the
existence of an enterprise. These requirements will be strictly adhered to.
Summary
The passage provides insight into the strict requirements for a RICO claim,
which are relevant to evaluating the complaint in question. It emphasizes
the necessity of proving an enterprise, interstate commerce impact, and
predicate acts, which are critical elements in assessing the validity of a
RICO claim.
SAAP Energy v. Bell, CASE NO. 1:12-CV-00098 (W.D. Ky. Aug 28, 2013)
U.S. District Court — Western District of Kentucky
Extract
Basil also moves to dismiss the RICO claim because SAAP has insufficiently
pled the existence of an 'enterprise.' A RICO enterprise 'includes any
individual, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, and
any union of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.' 18
U.S.C. § 1961(4). The RICO concept of an enterprise is 'obviously broad,
encompassing 'any... group of individuals associated in fact.' Boyle v. United
States, 556 U.S. 938, 944 (2009) (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4)). 'An
enterprise... 'is proven by evidence of an ongoing organization, formal or
informal, and by evidence that the various associates function as a
continuing unit.' Id. at 945 (quoting United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576,
583 (1981)). To be an enterprise, the association-in-fact must have a
structure. Id. The structure of an enterprise 'must have at least three...
features: a purpose, relationships among those associated with the
enterprise, and longevity sufficient to permit these associates to pursue the
enterprise's purpose.' Id. at 946. But 'this organizational structure need not
be hierarchical, can make decisions on an ad hoc basis, and does not require
the members to have fixed roles.' Ouwinga, 694 F.3d at 794. The plaintiff
must simply show 'a continuing unit that functions with a common purpose.'
Boyle, 556 U.S. at 948. Finally, 'although the existence of an enterprise is a
separate element that must be proved, the evidence used to prove the
pattern of racketeering activity and the evidence establishing an enterprise
'may in particular cases coalesce.'
Summary
Detailed explanation of what constitutes a RICO enterprise, emphasizing the
need for a structure with a purpose, relationships, and longevity. It also

=== PAGE 39 ===

clarifies that the structure does not need to be hierarchical and that the
evidence for the enterprise and the pattern of racketeering activity can
overlap. This is relevant to evaluating the complaint's sufficiency in alleging
a RICO enterprise.
Pemberton v. Walker, 22-cv-716-wmc (W.D. Wis. Feb 27, 2024)
U.S. District Court — Western District of Wisconsin
Extract
Finally, plaintiffs claim that the requirement they pay for their own drug
testing in cash before pretrial release amounted to extortion and
racketeering under the RICO statute, which makes it “unlawful for any
person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the
activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or
participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs
through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt,” 18
U.S.C. § 1962(c), “to conspire” with others to do so. 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d).
However, the Supreme Court has emphasized that RICO was enacted in
response to “long-term criminal conduct,” not isolated or sporadic unlawful
activity.
Summary
The passage highlights the requirement for a RICO claim to involve long-
term criminal conduct, as opposed to isolated or sporadic unlawful activity.
This is a critical aspect of establishing a RICO violation, as it underscores
the necessity of demonstrating a pattern of racketeering activity that is
continuous and related.

To sustain a RICO violation claim, a plaintiff must show: (1) two or more
predicate offenses; (2) the existence of an enterprise; (3) a nexus between
the pattern of racketeering and the enterprise; and (4) an injury caused by
the other three factors. ... A RICO enterprise is defined as 'any individual,
partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or
group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.' ... To
satisfy the enterprise requirement, an association-in-fact must be an on-
going organization, its members must function as a continuing unit, and it
must be separate from the pattern of racketeering activity in which it
engages.

Summary
Clear outline of the elements required to establish a RICO claim, including
the need for two or more predicate offenses, the existence of an enterprise,
a nexus between the racketeering pattern and the enterprise, and an injury
caused by these factors. It also clarifies that an enterprise must be an
ongoing organization with members functioning as a continuing unit,

Summary
The passage provides the legal definition and penalties for perjury under
U.S. federal law, which is relevant to the complaint's allegations of perjury
as part of a broader RICO claim. The complaint alleges that perjury was
committed as part of a fraudulent scheme, which could potentially be
considered under RICO if it is part of a pattern of racketeering activity.

Summary
The passage provides insight into the legal consequences of subornation of
perjury, which is relevant to the complaint if it involves allegations of perjury
or subornation of perjury as part of the RICO claims. The statute outlines
the penalties for procuring another to commit perjury, which could be
pertinent if the complaint alleges that one party induced another to provide
false testimony.

It shall be unlawful for any person through a pattern of racketeering activity
or through collection of an unlawful debt to acquire or maintain, directly or
indirectly, any interest in or control of any enterprise which is engaged in, or
the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce.
Summary
Unlawful nature of acquiring or maintaining control over an enterprise
through racketeering activities, which is central to the RICO claims in the

of racketeering activity to manipulate judicial proceedings and deprive the
plaintiff of property rights, which aligns with the prohibitions outlined in 18
U.S.C. § 1962.

Every RICO claim requires: (1) 'racketeering activity' that is (2) conducted
through an 'enterprise.' (4) A RICO 'enterprise' is the 'vehicle through which
the unlawful pattern of racketeering activity is committed.' (5) 'Racketeering

Extract
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), enacted as
Title IX of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970, is designed to combat
criminal organization. It prohibits 'any person' from: (a) using income
received from a pattern of racketeering activity or through collection of an
unlawful debt to acquire an interest in an enterprise affecting interstate
commerce; (b) acquiring or maintaining through a pattern of racketeering
activity or through collection of an unlawful debt an interest in an enterprise
affecting interstate commerce; (c) conducting or participating in the conduct
of, through a pattern of racketeering activity or through collection of an
unlawful debt, the affairs of an enterprise affecting interstate commerce; or
(d) conspiring to participate in any of these... The racketeering activity must
have some effect on interstate commerce. Courts initially held that the
enterprise itself, and not the predicate acts, must affect interstate
commerce. However, many courts now exercise jurisdiction when the
predicate acts form a nexus with interstate commerce.
Summary
N overview of the RICO Act, emphasizing the need for a pattern of

Extract
The two most controversial elements of RICO continue to be the 'Pattern'
and 'enterprise' requirements. A. Two or More Predicate Acts of
Racketeering Activity The first element of RICO requires two or more
predicate acts of 'racketeering activity.' RICO defendants need not be
convicted of each 'racketeering activity' before a substantive RICO offense is
charged. Under [sections] 1961(1), the term 'racketeering activity' includes
a broad assortment of state and federal crimes. These crimes include: (a)
certain acts that are chargeable under state laws and punishable by
imprisonment for more than one year; (b) acts that are indictable under
specified provisions of Title 18; ... The Supreme Court made a second
attempt to clarify the 'pattern' concept in H.J., Inc. v. Northwestern Bell
Telephone Co. In that case, the Court held that when proving a 'pattern of
racketeering activity,' RICO requires both relationship and continuity of
predicate acts as separate elements. However, the Court recognized that
proof of these factors will often overlap. The relationship prong is defined by

=== PAGE 46 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
the connection of the defendant's criminal acts to one another: 'continuity' is
successfully proved if a prosecutor can show actual continuity during a past,
closed period of repeated conduct or an open-ended threat of continued
racketeering activity in the future.
Summary
To establish a RICO violation, there must be a pattern of racketeering
activity, which includes two or more predicate acts. These acts must
demonstrate both a relationship and continuity. The relationship prong
requires that the acts are connected, while continuity can be shown through
repeated conduct over time or a threat of ongoing activity. This
understanding is crucial for evaluating the complaint's allegations under
RICO.

civil or criminal RICO offense is charged.(29) Under [sections] 1961(1), the

acts that are indictable under specified provisions of Title 18;(31)... D. Effect
on Interstate Commerce The alleged racketeering activity must affect
interstate commerce.(171) Courts initially held that the enterprise itself, and
not the predicate acts, must affect interstate commerce.(172) In contrast,
many courts now exercise RICO jurisdiction if the predicate acts have a de
minimis impact on interstate commerce,(173) demonstrated by 'proof of a
probable or potential impact.'(174)...

Damages
Colorado Lawyer - Colorado Bar Association - 1986-00-00
Extract
In summary, the essential elements of a cause of action under § 1962(c) (the
most commonly brought type of federal RICO claim) are: participation by the
defendant in the conduct of an enterprise, which is engaged in or whose
activities affect interstate or foreign commerce, through a pattern of
racketeering activity that causes injury to plaintiff in his or her business or
property.
Summary
To establish a RICO claim under § 1962(c), a plaintiff must demonstrate that
the defendant participated in the conduct of an enterprise engaged in or
affecting interstate commerce through a pattern of racketeering activity that
caused injury to the plaintiff's business or property. This is a fundamental
requirement for a RICO claim and is applicable in federal jurisdictions.

Extract
RICO applies only to those injuries resulting from commission of predicate
acts constituting a “pattern of racketeering activity.” The statutory definition
of “pattern of racketeering activity” requires at least two predicate acts
occurring within ten years of each other. A “pattern of racketeering activity”
also requires evidence that the predicate acts are continuous and
interrelated, rather than isolated and sporadic. A plaintiff can satisfy RICO’s
pattern requirement two ways: by alleging a long-running series of
interrelated predicate acts constituting a closed-ended conspiracy; or by
alleging at least two interrelated predicate acts and the distinct threat of
continued racketeering activities, demonstrating an open-ended conspiracy.
Summary
For a RICO claim to be valid, it must demonstrate a pattern of racketeering
activity, which includes at least two predicate acts that are continuous and

=== PAGE 48 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
interrelated. The complaint must show either a closed-ended conspiracy
with a long-running series of acts or an open-ended conspiracy with a threat
of continued activities. The complaint in question attempts to establish a
pattern of racketeering activity by detailing multiple predicate acts,
including wire fraud, interstate travel, and perjury, over an 18-month period,
which aligns with the requirements outlined in the passage.
Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy
The Brief - American Bar Association - 2024-01-01
Extract
A violation of § 1962(c), the section on which Sedima relies, requires (1)
conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity. The plaintiff must allege each of the elements to state a claim. They
are all equally essential components, and the complaint will fail if any one of
them is not adequately pleaded. In particular, RICO claims based on mail or
wire fraud must comport with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b)’s
requirement that allegations involving fraud be pleaded with particularity.
The practitioner through their pleadings must articulate with great care and
attention a viable racketeering claim. In addition, § 1962(a), (b), and (c) are
limited in scope to conduct involving enterprises engaged in or the activities
of which affect interstate commerce. It is the activities of the enterprise, not
each predicate act, that must affect interstate or foreign commerce. RICO
requires no more than a slight effect upon interstate commerce.
Summary
Essential elements required to establish a RICO claim under § 1962(c),
which includes conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering
activity. It emphasizes the necessity of pleading these elements with
particularity, especially in cases involving fraud, in compliance with Federal
Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b). The passage also highlights the requirement
that the enterprise's activities must affect interstate commerce, albeit
minimally. This information is crucial for evaluating the adequacy of the
complaint in question.

Civil RICO actions are now ubiquitous, so much so that plaintiffs often
attempt to apply the statute to situations that bear little resemblance to the
criminal racketeering activity animating the enactment of the statute in the
first place. And the potential consequences of these claims need to be taken
seriously. Indeed, RICO not only provides a plaintiff a private right of action,

it also contemplates the possibility of treble damages and attorneys' fee
awards if a plaintiff can prove the claim. The unfortunate reality is that the
mere threat of a RICO claim often can be enough to force a business to the
bargaining table.
Summary
Civil RICO claims are often applied in situations that may not align with the
original intent of the statute, which was to combat organized crime. The
passage emphasizes the seriousness of RICO claims due to the potential for
treble damages and attorneys' fees, but also notes the challenges in proving
such claims, particularly the need to demonstrate a pattern of racketeering
activity and a nexus to interstate commerce. This context is essential for
evaluating the complaint's adherence to RICO requirements.
RICO: A Primer
Extract
Among other things, 'racketeering activities' include 'any act which is
indictable under' a list of federal criminal statutes. The list covers an
expansive range of violations, for example, violations of the Hobbs Act, 18
U.S.C. ' 1951 (extortion); 18 U.S.C. ' 1341 (mail fraud) and 1343 (wire fraud);
18 U.S.C. ' 1831 (economic espionage); 18 U.S.C. ' 1832 (theft of trade
secrets); 18 U.S.C. ' 1952 (Travel Act); 18 U.S.C. ' 1956, 1957 (money
laundering); and 18 U.S.C. ' 2318-2320 (copyright infringement). Mail and
wire fraud are the most common predicate acts. ... The racketeering acts
need not be similar or directly related to each other; rather, it is sufficient
that the racketeering acts are related in some way to the affairs of the
charged enterprise, including, for example, that: the racketeering acts
furthered the goals of or benefitted the enterprise, the enterprise or the
defendant's role in the enterprise enabled the defendant to commit, or
facilitated the commission of, the racketeering acts, the racketeering acts
were committed at the behest of, or on behalf of, the enterprise, or the
racketeering acts had the same or similar purposes, results, participants,
victims or methods of commission. The continuity requirement is likewise
satisfied where the predicates are a regular way of conducting the
defendant's ongoing legitimate business (in the sense that it is not a
business that exists for criminal purposes), or of conducting or participating
in an ongoing and legitimate RICO 'enterprise.' A plaintiff may demonstrate
a pattern by establishment that the predicate acts pose a threat of continued
criminal activity, which is generally demonstrated by showing either: *
Closed-ended continuity. Proving 'a series of related predicate acts
extending over a substantial period of time.' * Open-ended continuity. A
threat of 'continuing criminal activity extending indefinitely into the future,'
in light of the nature of the enterprise and predicate acts alleged.

Summary
Detailed explanation of what constitutes "racketeering activities" under
RICO, including the requirement for a pattern of racketeering activity, which
can be demonstrated through closed-ended or open-ended continuity. The
passage also clarifies that the racketeering acts need not be similar but
must be related to the affairs of the charged enterprise. This information is
crucial for evaluating the complaint's allegations of RICO violations, as it
provides the legal framework for assessing whether the alleged acts
constitute a pattern of racketeering activity.

it also contemplates the possibility of treble damages and attorneys' fee
awards if a plaintiff can prove the claim. The unfortunate reality is that the
mere threat of a RICO claim often can be enough to force a business to the
bargaining table. As a result, businesses from financial institutions to
service providers are finding themselves defending against RICO claims in a
variety of novel contexts. By way of example, RICO claims have even become
a popular claim for those asserting that the 2020 election was marred by
fraud. Although the stakes may be high, RICO claims are challenging to
prove and often can be dismissed before parties engage in discovery.
Summary
Civil RICO claims are frequently used in various contexts, not just traditional
organized crime. The passage highlights the challenges in proving RICO
claims, emphasizing the need for concrete financial loss and the difficulty in
establishing a pattern of racketeering activity. It also notes that RICO claims
can be dismissed early if they do not meet the stringent requirements. This
information is relevant to evaluating the complaint's strength and potential
for success in a federal court.
RICO: A Primer
Extract
A RICO enterprise includes 'any individual, partnership, corporation,
association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals
associated in fact although not a legal entity.' Courts have interpreted

=== PAGE 51 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
'enterprise' broadly, and the definition captures both legitimate and
illegitimate enterprises. The statutory list is not exhaustive but merely
illustrative. What is A RICO 'Pattern'? A 'pattern' may exist where any
combination of two or more offenses occurred within a period of time. In
Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479, the Supreme Court held that the
RICO pattern element requires more than merely proving two predicate acts
of racketeering. Rather, proof of 'continuity plus relationship' is necessary.
Nonetheless, the Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized that Congress
had a fairly flexible concept of a pattern in mind.
Summary
The definition of a RICO enterprise is broad and includes both legitimate
and illegitimate entities. The concept of a "pattern" under RICO requires
more than just two predicate acts; it requires continuity and relationship
among the acts. This understanding is crucial for evaluating the complaint's
allegations of a RICO violation, as it must demonstrate a pattern of
racketeering activity that meets these criteria.
