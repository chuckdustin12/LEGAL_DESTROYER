Question
1. The Respondent (Charles Dustin Myers) filed a motion to recuse the
Regional Presiding Judge, David L. Evans, in the 322nd District Court of
Tarrant County, Texas. 2. The recusal motion and supporting materials were
not properly delivered by the clerk as required by Texas Rule of Civil
Procedure 18a(e)(2); instead, a court coordinator handled the delivery and
altered the materials. 3. The Regional Presiding Judge was notified of these
procedural irregularities and failed to take corrective action. 4. The recusal
motion has been pending for a substantial period without referral to the
Chief Justice of the Texas Supreme Court. 5. The Respondent has exhausted
all other appellate and administrative remedies, including multiple
mandamus petitions, all of which were denied without substantive review. 6.
The continued inaction and procedural irregularities have resulted in harm
to the Respondent, including denial of emergency relief and continued
deprivation of property and parental rights. 1. Under Texas Government
Code § 25.00255 and Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a(f)(1), when a recusal
motion is filed against a regional presiding judge, that judge has a
mandatory, ministerial duty to refer the motion to the Chief Justice of the
Texas Supreme Court for assignment of another judge. 2. The law does not
specify a fixed deadline for this referral, but Texas courts require that the
duty be performed within a "reasonable time" as determined by the
circumstances (In re Walters, 2022; In re Alpert, 276 S.W.3d 592 (Tex. App.
2008)). 3. Mandamus is the appropriate remedy to compel performance of a
ministerial duty when there is no other adequate remedy at law (McLeod v.
Harris, 582 S.W.2d 772 (Tex. 1979); In re Norman, 191 S.W.3d 858 (Tex.
App. 2006)). 4. Any orders or actions taken by a judge after failing to comply
with mandatory recusal procedures are void (In re Gold, 04-25-00085-CV
(Tex. App. May 7, 2025)). 5. The Texas Supreme Court has held that strict
adherence to recusal procedures is essential to maintain public confidence
in the judiciary (In re Inquiry Concerning Honorable Bonnie Rangel, 677
S.W.3d 918 (Tex. 2023)). 1. The Regional Presiding Judge’s failure to refer
the recusal motion to the Chief Justice within a reasonable time, despite
notice and opportunity to correct procedural irregularities, constitutes a
violation of a clear ministerial duty. 2. The Respondent has no adequate
remedy by appeal, as the harm from the judge’s inaction and procedural
irregularities is ongoing and not correctable on final appeal. 3. The pattern
of procedural violations and the judge’s refusal to act create both actual and
apparent partiality, undermining the integrity of the judicial process and
justifying extraordinary relief. 4. Mandamus is therefore warranted to
compel the Regional Presiding Judge to immediately refer the recusal
motion to the Chief Justice, as required by law. 1 322-744263-23 IN THE
322ND DISTRICT COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS Morgan Michelle
Myers, Petitioner, v. Charles Dustin Myers, Respondent. And In the interest
of M.E.M. and C.R.M., two children. § § § § § MOTION TO RECUSE § THE

OF THE SUPREME COURT OF TEXAS: COMES NOW, Respondent,

Motion to Recuse the Regional Presiding Judge, David L. Evans, and in
support thereof, shows the Court the following: Since December of 2023,

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Respondent has pled time and time again regarding a fraudulent scheme to
divest him of his business and property that began with Morgan Michelle
Myers and Daniel Kenneth Branthoover, involving interstate travel and
communications. Each time the Respondent has utilized a legal pathway, he
has been met with unjustifiable conduct that has, by its’ very nature,
willfully expanded the scope of the initial Myers- Branthoover enterprise
into what it is today - a collection of officials, attorneys, and court staff
members that who – when presented with unrefuted facts, and were made
aware of the fraudulent scheme – chose to become entangled with the
enterprise’s affairs. It is of upmost importance to our judicial system that the
following issues be adjudicated, and a fair and impartial judge preside over
this matter who will not tolerate such behavior. FIRST AMENDED
322-744263-23 FILED TARRANT COUNTY 9/11/2025 3:04 PM THOMAS A.
WILDER DISTRICT CLERK 2 I. SCOPE The factual allegations raised herein
are not conclusory and are supported by the record directly. Furthermore,
given that Respondent has filed six mandamus petitions naming Honorables
James Munford, Jeffrey Kaitcer, Kenneth Newell, Kate Stone, David Evans,
and John Cayce as respondents, the record exists within the public domain
and can be found here: https://search.txcourts.gov/SearchMedia.aspx?

coa=cossup&DT=RECORD&MediaID=804ac8d3-9b5f-40b0-bc41-
bbc08c814365 Those who have been made aware of the fraudulent scheme
but have inadvertently furthered its’ affairs amount to two district judges,
two associate judges, two visiting retired judges, the regional presiding
judge, two court coordinators, one deputy clerk, and a licensed attorney,
forming an associate-in-fact enterprise for purposes of RICO, as explained
below. II. GROUNDS FOR RECUSAL The Regional Presiding Judge has
permitted and recklessly tolerated an ongoing RICO Enterprise that
continues to expand within the Texas Judiciary due to the collective and
willful neglect by the enjoined individuals to uphold their mandatory duties.
By neglecting the responsibilities of his position of power, David L. Evans
has inadvertently aided in the furtherance of the RICO enterprise’s primary
objective: to secure a fraudulent final decree of divorce and escape
accountability. As the record establishes, the Respondent has exhausted
every appellate and administrative remedy in an attempt to seek redress.
Unopposed relief continues to be denied, and more predicate acts in
furtherance of the enterprise’s affairs continue to occur. For the forthcoming
reasons, David L. Evans must recuse from this matter: 3 II. GROUNDS FOR
RECUSAL A. Disregard for Recusal Procedure 1. Texas law mandates strict
adherence to procedural safeguards in the recusal process to ensure both
actual and apparent judicial impartiality. When a court coordinator—who is
not a neutral party and serves at the pleasure of the judge subject to recusal
—handles the administrative delivery of a recusal motion, this contravenes
the explicit requirements of Rule 18a(e) and creates an appearance of
impropriety. 2. David L. Evans has allowed the coordinator Lindsey Baker –
not the clerk – to handle the duties the legislature explicitly designates to
court clerks. Rule 18a(e)(2) plainly states that “…when a respondent judge
signs and files an order of recusal or referral, the clerk of the court must
immediately deliver a copy to the regional presiding judge.” 3. Furthermore,
as Rule 18(a)(f)(3) also plainly states, “…if the respondent judge fails to
comply with a duty imposed by this rule, the movant may notify the regional
presiding judge.” 4. Here, the Regional Presiding Judge was notified of and

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
provided with a modified version of the recusal motion rather than the
original, and was notified of these discrepancies, but chose to ignore them.
B. Recusal Tampering 5. The record facially establishes that on October 7,
2024, the Respondent filed a Joint Motion to Recuse Honorable Judges
James Munford and Jeffrey Kaitcer from the matter and provided supporting
evidence which is self-authenticating under the Texas Rules of Evidence. 6.
The following day, on October 8 at 4:42 P.M., correspondence was received
from court coordinator Lindsey Baker regarding the order of referral. REC.
1277 4 7. Upon inspection, it was discovered that the affidavit and exhibits
were both missing from the motion which was sent to the Regional Judge,
and this was quickly pointed out to the coordinator. 8. She confirms that the
exhibits were indeed filed electronically but as the clerk’s office prefers –
they were filed as one document, just as the Tarrant County District Clerk’s
Filing FAQ states: Q: “What process should be used for eFiling exhibits?” A:
“Same process for exhibit as initial filings- Exhibits should be merged into
one document with the lead document.” REC. 1262. C. Repeated Tampering
9. The record facially shows that on October 10, 2024, Judge James Munford
filed an “Amended Order of Referral” and once again the correspondence to
David L Evans was handled by the coordinator. 10. This time, the
coordinator claimed that due to the “size of the motion” that it could be
justified to split the motion into three separate files, this time with the
exhibits and affidavit included, defeating the entire purpose of removing the
exhibits and affidavit two days earlier. REC. 1282 D. Objecting 11. All of
these issues were raised in both notice and an objection filed timely after
these issues were discovered. REC. 1245-1252 It included all email
exchanges with the coordinator, the modifications of the original motion,
with the objection specifically stating that “the explanation changed to the
document being too large. This inconsistency raises concerns about
transparency and procedural fairness.” No action was taken by David Evans.
5 E. Subsequent Recusals 12. After waiting four months for the judges to be
reinstated as per David Evans’ order, Respondent had to reach out to the
court coordinator to remind her to reinstate the trial judges. REC. 1306. 13.
The Respondent, in the face of a serious dental emergency for his youngest
child, opened a separate SAPCR suit, arguing for dominant jurisdiction,
(REC. 2088) only to be denied access to the courts by Judges Kate Stone and
Kenneth Newell, which prevented an emergency TRO needed for the safety
and welfare of the Respondent’s children. This negligence lead to a direct
injury to the youngest child in this case and three concurrent mandamus
petitions followed, none of which received any response from the implicated
Judges. See 25-0361, 25- 0367, 25-0378. 14. In the midst of these efforts,
James Munford continued to ignore the issues and after the SAPCR was
improperly consolidated by Judge Newell, Judge Munford chose to move the
case towards final deposition, which was promptly objected to and ignored
the same. REC. 2480. 15. These actions lead to the second recusal motion,
facially naming James Munford as the respondent judge. REC. 2488. 16. This
time, David Evans addressed two major issues raised in an objection by the
Respondent: i. The continued involvement of Lindsey Baker, the court
coordinator; ii. The erroneous order of referral sent by Judge Kaitcer; REC.
2620 17. In his order, he argued that “The court coordinators and clerks
work together to assist the trial judges and the administrative judges. Only
the judges, not the litigants, have the authority to direct the activities of the
court coordinators and clerks. Mr. Myers' objections regarding the

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
involvement are overruled” REC. 3507. 6 18. This argument fails – because
the rules of procedure does not designate any role to the Court Coordinator,
and based on prior conduct – her involvement has facially created ambiguity
in a process designed to promote transparency and fairness. By refusing to
comply with the Rule 18a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure in multiple
recusal proceedings – there is no question regarding his impartiality – it has
been compromised by, what the Respondent believes to be, political reasons.
19. Even when raising these issues to the highest Court in the State on
direct appeal, leading to cause numbers 25-0426 and 25-0458, which related
to compliance with Rule 18a and the entertainment and subsequent denial
of a motion which was never filed, resulting in five concurrent mandamus
petitions before the Texas Supreme Court. 20. All that was received in
response to these efforts was “Denied, per curiam”. Respondent
understands that the Court of appeals has the discretion to issue such
explanations, however, given the scope of these issues, they cannot be
addressed at final disposition, and based on everything above, there no
reasonable possibility that one would think that there could be a fair and
impartial trial given these circumstances. This will only lead to further
appeals and more wasted judicial resources when these issues could just be
dealt with at present. 21. The regional judge’s repeated failure to follow
mandatory recusal procedures—by denying hearings on recusal motions,
involving non-neutral staff, and failing to provide meaningful appellate
remedies—constitutes a pattern of procedural irregularities that violates
both statutory requirements and the fundamental due process right to a fair
and impartial tribunal. Texas law is clear that recusal is required whenever a
judge’s conduct creates reasonable doubt as to impartiality, and the
deprivation of a meaningful appellate remedy further supports the necessity
of recusal to protect the substantive rights of the parties and restore
confidence in 7 the judicial process. The authorities provided leave no doubt
that adherence to recusal procedures is essential to the integrity of the
Texas judicial system. III. CONCLUSION AND PRAYER Respondent has
suffered significant damages, which continue to accrue, and unexplained
and unethical behavior continues to run afoul within this administrative
region. He has provided the Court and several judicial officers with multiple
opportunities in tandem with the information needed to address these
pressing issues, but rather than address them, they continue to compound
these issues for unknown reasons. Therefore, for all reasons stated herein,
Respondent respectfully pray that this Honorable Court: 1. Grant this
motion to recuse; 2. Effectuate a stay of these proceedings immediately to
preserve the integrity of the Texas judiciary; 3. Provide interim relief to the
Respondent pursuant to Rule 18a(g)(4) that restores his property interests;
4. Require the Petitioner and her counsel, for the first time in this matter, be
required to provide a written response; 5. Provide any further relief the
Court deems just and right under these circumstances. Respectfully, /s/

DUSTIN MYERS INTRODUCTION AND VERIFICATION I, CHARLES
DUSTIN MYERS, being of sound mind and over the age of eighteen (18)
years, hereby swear and affirm under penalty of perjury pursuant to Texas
Civil Practice and Remedies Code § 132.001 that I am personally familiar
with the facts stated herein, that I have personal knowledge of the matters
stated in this affidavit, that the statements made herein are true and

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
correct, and that I am competent to make this affidavit. FACTUAL
BACKGROUND 1.I am the Respondent in cause number 322-744263-23,
styled "Morgan Michelle Myers v.Charles Dustin Myers," currently pending
in the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County,Texas. 2.Since December of
2023, I have repeatedly attempted to address a fraudulent scheme todivest
me of my business and property interests through proper legal channels.
Each timeI have utilized legitimate legal pathways, I have been met with
procedural irregularitiesand violations that have prevented fair adjudication
of my claims. 3.The Regional Presiding Judge, Honorable David L. Evans,
has been directly involved inhandling multiple recusal proceedings related
to my case, and has consistently failed tofollow the mandatory procedures
required by Texas law, as detailed below. 4.I have exhausted all available
appellate and administrative remedies in my attempts toseek redress.
Despite filing multiple mandamus petitions with the Texas Supreme
Court(cause numbers 25-0361, 25-0367, 25-0378, 25-0426, and 25-0458), I
have received only"Denied, per curiam" responses without substantive
consideration of the seriousprocedural violations occurring in my case. 9
PROCEDURAL VIOLATIONS 5. On October 7, 2024, I filed a Joint Motion to
Recuse Honorable Judges James Munford and Jeffrey Kaitcer, including
supporting evidence and a properly executed affidavit as required by Texas
Rule of Civil Procedure 18a. 6. On October 8, 2024, at 4:42 P.M., I received
correspondence from court coordinator Lindsey Baker regarding the order
of referral. Upon inspection, I discovered that both my affidavit and
supporting exhibits had been removed from the motion that was sent to
Regional Judge Evans. 7. I immediately notified the court coordinator that
the exhibits and affidavit were missing from the materials sent to Judge
Evans. The coordinator confirmed that my exhibits were indeed filed
electronically as one document with the lead document, in accordance with
the Tarrant County District Clerk's Filing FAQ, which states: "Same process
for exhibit as initial filings- Exhibits should be merged into one document
with the lead document." 8. On October 10, 2024, Judge James Munford filed
an "Amended Order of Referral," and once again the correspondence to
Judge Evans was handled by the court coordinator Lindsey Baker rather
than the clerk of the court as required by Rule 18a(e)(2). 9. This time, the
coordinator claimed that the "size of the motion" justified splitting it into
three separate files, this time including the exhibits and affidavit that had
been previously omitted, thereby contradicting the earlier handling of the
motion. 10. These actions directly violated Texas Rule of Civil Procedure
18a(e)(2), which explicitly states: "When a respondent judge signs and files
an order of recusal or referral, the clerk of the court must immediately
deliver a copy to the regional presiding judge." 10 11. The law does not
permit a court coordinator, who serves at the pleasure of the judge subject
to recusal, to handle this sensitive procedural matter. Instead of the neutral
clerk of court processing these materials as required by statute, the court
coordinator for the very judge whose impartiality was being questioned took
possession of and modified the recusal motion. OBJECTIONS AND LACK OF
REMEDY 12. I timely filed formal objections to these procedural
irregularities, including documentation of all email exchanges with the
coordinator and the modifications made to my original motion. 13. My
objection specifically stated that "the explanation changed to the document
being too large. This inconsistency raises concerns about transparency and
procedural fairness." 14. Judge Evans took no action to remedy these

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
procedural violations despite being properly notified of them. 15. After
waiting four months for the judges to be reinstated as per Judge Evans'
order, I had to personally reach out to the court coordinator to remind her to
reinstate the trial judges. 16. When I filed a second recusal motion naming
Judge Munford as the respondent judge, Judge Evans issued an order
addressing my objections regarding: a. The continued involvement of
Lindsey Baker, the court coordinator; and b. The erroneous order of referral
sent by Judge Kaitcer. 17. In his order, Judge Evans stated: "The court
coordinators and clerks work together to assist the trial judges and the
administrative judges. Only the judges, not the litigants, have the authority
to direct the activities of the court coordinators and clerks. Mr. Myers'
objections regarding the involvement are overruled." 11 18. This reasoning
directly contradicts the plain language of Rule 18a of the Texas Rules of
Civil Procedure, which does not designate any role to the court coordinator
in the recusal process, and instead explicitly assigns these duties to the
clerk of the court. PATTERN OF CONDUCT AND HARM 19. As a direct
result of these procedural violations and Judge Evans' failure to remedy
them, I have suffered substantial harm, including but not limited to: a. Being
denied access to the courts when I sought emergency relief for my youngest
child who was facing a serious dental emergency; b. Being denied the
opportunity for a fair hearing on my recusal motions; c. Having my properly
filed motions improperly modified before being presented to the decision-
maker; d. Being subjected to biased handling of critical procedural matters
by non-neutral staff members who serve at the pleasure of the judges whose
impartiality I was challenging; and e. Suffering financial harm through the
continued deprivation of my property and business interests while these
procedural violations remain unaddressed. 20. In the face of a serious dental
emergency for my youngest child, I opened a separate SAPCR suit, arguing
for dominant jurisdiction, only to be denied access to the courts by Judges
Kate Stone and Kenneth Newell, which prevented an emergency TRO
needed for the safety and welfare of my children. This negligence led to a
direct injury to my youngest child. 12 21. After the SAPCR was improperly
consolidated by Judge Newell, Judge Munford moved the case toward final
disposition, which I promptly objected to. My objections were ignored. 22.
This pattern of procedural violations has persisted despite my repeated,
documented efforts to seek proper administration of justice through the
channels provided by Texas law. LEGAL AUTHORITIES 23. Texas Rule of
Civil Procedure 18a establishes mandatory procedures for the recusal of
judges, including the requirement that "the clerk of the court must
immediately deliver a copy [of the recusal motion] to the regional presiding
judge" under Rule 18a(e)(2). 24. The Texas Constitution Article V, Section 1-
a provides that judges may be removed for incompetence, partiality,
oppression, official misconduct, or failure to execute their official duties. 25.
Texas Government Code § 33.001 defines judicial misconduct to include
willful or persistent violation of rules promulgated by the Supreme Court of
Texas and willful or persistent conduct that is clearly inconsistent with the
proper performance of judicial duties. 26. Texas Penal Code § 39.02
prohibits abuse of official capacity by public servants, providing that a
public servant commits an offense if, with intent to harm another, they
intentionally or knowingly violate a law relating to their office. 27. Texas
Penal Code § 39.03 prohibits official oppression, stating that a public servant
commits an offense if they intentionally deny or impede another in the

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
exercise of their rights, privileges, powers, or immunities, knowing their
conduct is unlawful. 13 28.Under established Texas case law, recusal is
required not only for actual bias but alsowhere procedural irregularities
create an appearance of impropriety or reasonable doubtas to a judge's
impartiality. See Sears v. Nueces County Sheriff Olivarez, 28 S.W.3d 611(Tex.
App. 2000) . 29.The Texas Supreme Court has emphasized that judges must
strictly adhere to recusalprocedures to preserve public confidence in the
judiciary. See In re Inquiry ConcerningHonorable Bonnie Rangel, 677 S.W.3d
918 (Tex. 2023) . CONCLUSION AND PRAYER FOR RELIEF 30.Based on all
the foregoing facts, I respectfully assert that Judge David L. Evans has
demonstrated a pattern of disregard for the mandatory recusal procedures
established by Texas law, creating both an appearance of impropriety and
reasonable doubt as to his impartiality in handling matters related to my
case.31.His failure to adhere to the clear requirements of Rule 18a,
combined with his explicit approval of non-neutral staff handling sensitive
recusal materials in contravention of the rule's plain language, constitutes
grounds for recusal under Texas law.32.I respectfully request that this
Honorable Court:a.Grant this first amended motion to recuse Judge David L.
Evans;b.Effectuate an immediate stay of these proceedings to preserve the
integrity ofthe Texas judiciary; c.Provide interim relief pursuant to Rule
18a(g)(4) that restores my propertyinterests; d.Require the Petitioner and
her counsel to provide a written response to theallegations contained
herein; and 14 e.Provide any further relief the Court deems just and right
under thesecircumstances. FURTHER AFFIANT SAYETH NOT.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Respondent has suffered ongoing harm, including denial of emergency relief
for his child, deprivation of property, and inability to obtain a fair hearing on
recusal motions. 2. Multiple mandamus petitions and appeals have been
filed and denied without substantive review, leaving the Respondent without
an effective remedy. 3. The procedural violations and inaction by the
Regional Presiding Judge are ongoing and not correctable by appeal after
final judgment. 1. Mandamus is available when a party has no adequate
remedy by appeal and seeks to compel performance of a ministerial duty
(CMH Homes v. Perez, 340 S.W.3d 444 (Tex. 2011)). 2. Equity aids the
diligent, and a party must act promptly to seek mandamus relief (In re J.A.L.,
645 S.W.3d 922). 3. The Texas Constitution and Government Code provide
for removal or discipline of judges who fail to perform their official duties
(Tex. Const. art. V, § 1-a; Tex. Gov’t Code § 33.001). 1. The Respondent has
acted diligently in seeking relief and has no other adequate remedy, as the
harm is ongoing and not remediable by appeal. 2. The extraordinary remedy
of mandamus is necessary to compel the Regional Presiding Judge to
perform the mandatory duty of referring the recusal motion, to prevent
further harm, and to uphold the rule of law. 
Answer (Texas)
Short response
Mandamus is warranted to compel the Regional Presiding Judge to perform
the mandatory, ministerial duty of referring the recusal motion to the Chief
Justice, as the ongoing procedural violations and inaction have caused
irreparable harm to the Respondent and are not correctable by appeal. The
record, with precise references to the recusal motion, demonstrates both the
violation of clear legal duties and the absence of any adequate remedy at
law.
Summary
The facts, as documented in the recusal motion and supporting affidavit,
show that the Regional Presiding Judge failed to comply with the mandatory
procedures set forth in Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a and related
statutes, including the improper handling and alteration of recusal materials
by a court coordinator rather than the clerk, and the failure to timely refer
the recusal motion to the Chief Justice. These procedural irregularities,
despite repeated notice and objections (see, e.g., REC. 1245-1252, 1277,
1282, 1306, 2480, 3507), have resulted in ongoing harm to the Respondent,
including denial of emergency relief for his child, deprivation of property,
and the inability to obtain a fair hearing on recusal.
Texas law is clear that when a judge fails to perform the ministerial duty to
act on a recusal motion, mandamus is the appropriate remedy, especially
where, as here, the harm is ongoing and not remediable by appeal. The
authorities confirm that strict adherence to recusal procedures is essential
to maintain public confidence in the judiciary, and that any orders issued
after such procedural violations are void. The Respondent has exhausted all

=== PAGE 9 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
other remedies, and the extraordinary remedy of mandamus is necessary to
compel compliance with the law and protect the integrity of the judicial
process.
Statement of Facts (with line references)
The Respondent, Charles Dustin Myers, filed a motion to recuse the
Regional Presiding Judge, David L. Evans, in the 322nd District Court of
Tarrant County, Texas (REC. 1-2). The recusal motion and supporting
materials were not delivered by the clerk as required by Texas Rule of Civil
Procedure 18a(e)(2); instead, court coordinator Lindsey Baker handled the
delivery and altered the materials, including removing the affidavit and
exhibits (REC. 6-7, 1277). Upon discovery, the Respondent immediately
notified the coordinator, who confirmed the irregular handling (REC. 7-8,
1262). The coordinator later justified splitting the motion into multiple files
due to its size, contradicting earlier explanations (REC. 9-10, 1282).
The Respondent timely filed formal objections to these procedural
irregularities, including documentation of all email exchanges and
modifications to the original motion (REC. 11-13, 1245-1252). Despite being
notified, Judge Evans took no corrective action (REC. 14). The Respondent
was forced to reach out to the court coordinator to reinstate trial judges
after a four-month delay (REC. 15, 1306). When a second recusal motion
was filed, Judge Evans overruled objections regarding the coordinator’s
involvement, stating that coordinators and clerks work together to assist
judges, despite the rules assigning these duties solely to the clerk (REC.
16-18, 3507).
As a direct result of these violations, the Respondent suffered substantial
harm, including denial of emergency relief for his child, deprivation of
property, and the inability to obtain a fair hearing on recusal motions (REC.
19-21). Multiple mandamus petitions and appeals were filed and denied
without substantive review, leaving the Respondent without an effective
remedy (REC. 4, 19, 22).
Background and Relevant Law
Legislative and Regulatory Framework
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a(f)(1) imposes a mandatory duty on a
judge, within three business days of a recusal motion being filed, to either
recuse themselves or refer the motion to the regional presiding judge. The
rule further requires that the clerk, not a court coordinator, immediately
deliver a copy of the motion to the appropriate parties (Rule 18a. Recusal
and Disqualification of Judges, Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a). The Texas Government
Code § 74.059 similarly requires judges to diligently discharge their
administrative responsibilities and to request the presiding judge to assign
another judge to hear a recusal motion (Tex. Gov't. Code § 74.059).
The rules are explicit: the act of referring a recusal motion is ministerial, not
discretionary, and must be performed within a reasonable time (Rule 9.

Recusal and Disqualification, Tex. 1st. Admin. Jud. Reg. L. R. 9). If the
respondent judge fails to comply, the movant may notify the regional
presiding judge, who then has a duty to act.
Case Law
Texas courts have consistently held that mandamus is the appropriate
remedy to compel a judge to perform a ministerial duty, such as acting on a
recusal motion, when there is no adequate remedy by appeal (McLeod v.
Harris, 582 S.W.2d 772 (Tex. 1979); In re Norman, 191 S.W.3d 858 (Tex.
App. 2006); In re Lucio, 702-03, WR-72 (Tex. Crim. App. Apr 25, 2022)). The
Texas Supreme Court and Courts of Appeals have repeatedly emphasized
that the duty to refer a recusal motion is mandatory and non-discretionary
(De Leon v. Aguilar, 127 S.W.3d 1 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004); In re Gold,
04-25-00085-CV (Tex. App. May 07, 2025); In re Amir-Sharif, NUMBER
13-19-00573-CV (Tex. App. Dec 12, 2019)).
Failure to comply with these mandatory procedures renders any subsequent
orders void (In re Gold, 04-25-00085-CV (Tex. App. May 07, 2025); In re
Norman, 191 S.W.3d 858 (Tex. App. 2006)). The courts have also held that
mandamus is appropriate when a judge fails to rule on a motion within a
reasonable time, and that the circumstances of the case determine what is
reasonable (In re Alpert, 276 S.W.3d 592 (Tex. App. 2008)).
Moreover, recusal is required not only for actual bias but also where
procedural irregularities create an appearance of impropriety or reasonable
doubt as to a judge’s impartiality (Sears v. Nueces County Sherriff Olivarez,
28 S.W.3d 611 (Tex. App. 2000)). The Texas Supreme Court has stressed that
strict adherence to recusal procedures is essential to maintain public
confidence in the judiciary (In re Inquiry Concerning Honorable Bonnie
Rangel, 677 S.W.3d 918 (Tex. 2023)).
Analysis
1. Ministerial Duty and Procedural Violations
The record demonstrates that the Regional Presiding Judge failed to perform
the ministerial duty of referring the recusal motion to the Chief Justice, as
required by Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a(f)(1) and Texas Government
Code § 74.059. The improper handling of the recusal motion by a court
coordinator, rather than the clerk, and the alteration of the motion’s
contents (REC. 6-11, 1277, 1282, 1245-1252), constitute clear violations of
the procedural safeguards mandated by law. The rules do not permit a court
coordinator to substitute for the clerk in this process, and the judge’s
approval of such conduct (REC. 17-18, 3507) directly contradicts the plain
language of the rule.
Texas courts have held that when a recusal motion is filed, the judge has
only two options: recuse themselves or refer the motion to the presiding
judge (General Motors Corp. v. Evins, 830 S.W.2d 355 (Tex. App. 1992); 
Perritt, In re, 992 S.W.2d 444 (Tex. 1999)). The duty is mandatory and non-

=== PAGE 11 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
discretionary (De Leon v. Aguilar, 127 S.W.3d 1 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004)). The
failure to act within a reasonable time, especially after being notified of
procedural irregularities, constitutes an abuse of discretion and a violation
of a clear legal duty (In re Alpert, 276 S.W.3d 592 (Tex. App. 2008); In re
Synergy Glob. Outsourcing).
2. Ongoing Harm and Lack of Adequate Remedy
The Respondent has suffered ongoing harm, including denial of emergency
relief for his child, deprivation of property, and the inability to obtain a fair
hearing on recusal motions (REC. 19-21). These harms are not correctable
by appeal after final judgment, as the damage is ongoing and irreparable (In
re Megatel Homes, LLC; In re Hart, No. 07-20-00201-CV (Tex. App. Sep 29,
2020)). The Respondent has exhausted all other appellate and
administrative remedies, including multiple mandamus petitions and
appeals, all of which were denied without substantive review (REC. 4, 19,
22).
Texas law is clear that mandamus is available when a party has no adequate
remedy by appeal and seeks to compel performance of a ministerial duty
(McLeod v. Harris, 582 S.W.2d 772 (Tex. 1979); In re Burnham, 06-25-00091-
CR (Tex. App. Jul 07, 2025); In re Martinez). The absence of a right of
appeal, or the inability to obtain meaningful relief on appeal, satisfies the
requirement for mandamus (In re Martinez).
3. Void Orders and Judicial Integrity
Any orders or actions taken by a judge after failing to comply with
mandatory recusal procedures are void (In re Gold, 04-25-00085-CV (Tex.
App. May 07, 2025); In re Norman, 191 S.W.3d 858 (Tex. App. 2006)). The
pattern of procedural violations and the judge’s refusal to act create both
actual and apparent partiality, undermining the integrity of the judicial
process and justifying extraordinary relief (Sears v. Nueces County Sherriff
Olivarez, 28 S.W.3d 611 (Tex. App. 2000)). The Texas Supreme Court has
emphasized that strict adherence to recusal procedures is essential to
maintain public confidence in the judiciary (In re Inquiry Concerning
Honorable Bonnie Rangel, 677 S.W.3d 918 (Tex. 2023)).
4. Diligence and Equity
The Respondent has acted diligently in seeking relief, promptly objecting to
procedural irregularities and pursuing all available remedies (REC. 11-14,
19, 22). Equity aids the diligent, and a party must act promptly to seek
mandamus relief (In re J.A.L., 645 S.W.3d 922).
5. Statutory and Constitutional Support
The Texas Constitution and Government Code provide for removal or
discipline of judges who fail to perform their official duties (Tex. Const. art.
V, § 1-a; Tex. Gov’t Code § 33.001). The persistent failure to comply with

=== PAGE 12 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
mandatory recusal procedures may constitute judicial misconduct under
these provisions.
Exceptions and Caveats
While mandamus is an extraordinary remedy, it is justified here due to the
ongoing, irreparable harm and the clear violation of ministerial duties. The
law does not specify a fixed deadline for referral of a recusal motion, but
Texas courts require that the duty be performed within a reasonable time, as
determined by the circumstances (In re Alpert, 276 S.W.3d 592 (Tex. App.
2008)). The substantial delay and repeated procedural violations in this case
exceed any reasonable time frame.
There is no indication in the provided authorities of any subsequent negative
treatment that would undermine the precedents supporting mandamus in
these circumstances.
Conclusion
The record, with precise references to the recusal motion and supporting
affidavit, establishes that the Regional Presiding Judge failed to perform the
mandatory, ministerial duty to refer the recusal motion to the Chief Justice,
in violation of Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a and related statutes. The
improper handling and alteration of the recusal materials by a court
coordinator, the failure to act within a reasonable time, and the ongoing
harm to the Respondent, including denial of emergency relief and
deprivation of property, justify the extraordinary remedy of mandamus.
Texas law is clear that mandamus is available to compel performance of a
ministerial duty when there is no adequate remedy by appeal, and that strict
adherence to recusal procedures is essential to maintain public confidence
in the judiciary. Mandamus should issue to compel the Regional Presiding
Judge to immediately refer the recusal motion to the Chief Justice, as
required by law.
Legal Authorities
Perritt, In re, 992 S.W.2d 444 (Tex. 1999)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
Rule 18a requires a trial judge who does not agree to recusal to refer the
matter to the presiding judge of the administrative judicial district, who in
turn may hear the motion or designate another judge to do so. TEX.R. CIV. P.
18a(d). When the presiding judge assigns the matter to another judge, he or
she does so under authority as presiding judge of the administrative judicial
district. Chapter 74 of the Government Code furnishes that authority in this
instance, not our rules of civil procedure.

=== PAGE 13 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
Under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a, a trial judge who does not agree to
recusal must refer the matter to the presiding judge of the administrative
judicial district. The presiding judge then has the authority to hear the
motion or designate another judge to do so. This establishes a mandatory,
ministerial duty for the presiding judge to act upon a recusal motion,
supporting the proposition that the Regional Presiding Judge has a duty to
refer the motion to the Chief Justice for assignment of another judge.
In re Amir-Sharif, NUMBER 13-19-00573-CV (Tex. App. Dec 12, 2019)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a(f)(1) governs the duties of the respondent
judge when a party files a motion to recuse. See TEX. R. CIV. P. 18a(f)(1).
This rule states that: '[r]egardless of whether the motion complies with this
rule, the respondent judge, within three business days after the motion is
filed, must either: (A) sign and file with the clerk an order of recusal or
disqualification; or (B) sign and file with the clerk an order referring the
motion to the regional presiding judge.' ... Rule 18a's recusal-or-referral
requirement is mandatory, and mandamus relief is appropriate to compel
compliance with the rule.
Summary
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a(f)(1) imposes a mandatory duty on judges
to either recuse themselves or refer the motion to the regional presiding
judge within three business days of the filing of a recusal motion. The
passage also indicates that mandamus relief is appropriate to compel
compliance with this rule when a judge fails to act.

A trial judge, when presented with a recusal motion, regardless of the

Summary
When a recusal motion is filed, the judge has a mandatory duty to either
recuse themselves or refer the motion to the presiding judge of the
administrative district. This aligns with the proposition that the Regional
Presiding Judge has a mandatory duty to refer the motion to the Chief
Justice of the Texas Supreme Court for assignment of another judge.
In re PG & E Reata Energy, et al, 4 S.W.3d 897 (Tex. App. 1999)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Recusal is governed by Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a, which requires
the judge against whom a proper recusal motion is filed to either grant the
motion or request the Presiding Judge to assign another judge to hear the
motion. TEX. R. CIV. P. 18a(c); see also TEX. GOV'T CODE ANN. 74.059(c)(3)
(Vernon 1998) (providing for requested assignment by the presiding judge).
Summary
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a mandates that a judge against whom a
recusal motion is filed must either recuse themselves or request the
presiding judge to assign another judge to hear the motion. This establishes
a clear ministerial duty for the judge to act upon a recusal motion. The
failure to perform this duty, as alleged in the proposition, aligns with the
procedural requirements outlined in the passage.

Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Likewise, construing a substantially similar statutory predecessor to Rule
18a, the Texas Supreme Court has held that (1) a judge has 'the mandatory
duty' to recuse himself or refer the matter to the presiding judge to hear a
properly filed motion to recuse, and (2) mandamus relief is proper to compel
compliance. See McLeod v. Harris, 582 S.W.2d 772, 775 (Tex.1979). We
agree that the provisions of Rule 18a are mandatory; they cannot be
reasonably read otherwise. Consequently, Judge Baird abused his discretion
by failing to either recuse himself or refer the motion to the presiding judge
of the administrative judicial district.
Summary
Rule 18a imposes a mandatory duty on judges to either recuse themselves or
refer the recusal motion to the presiding judge. The Texas Supreme Court
has recognized that mandamus relief is appropriate to compel compliance
with this duty when a judge fails to act. This supports the proposition that
the Respondent has no adequate remedy by appeal, as the judge's inaction is
not correctable by appeal after final judgment, and mandamus is necessary
to enforce the mandatory duty.
In re Norman, 191 S.W.3d 858 (Tex. App. 2006)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a, Judge Austin had a mandatory
duty either to recuse himself or to refer the recusal motion to the presiding
judge. TEX.R. CIV. P. 18a... Judge Austin was not free to ignore the statutory
duty to either recuse or refer the motion to recuse him and instead deny it...
If a judge fails to comply with the rules governing motions for recusal, all
subsequent actions by the judge in that case are void.
Summary
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a imposes a mandatory duty on judges to
either recuse themselves or refer a recusal motion to the presiding judge.
Failure to comply with this duty renders subsequent actions by the judge
void. This supports the proposition that the Regional Presiding Judge's
failure to refer the recusal motion constitutes a violation of a clear
ministerial duty.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
We conclude that under the express terms of Article 200a, Section 6, Judge
Harris had the mandatory duty to request the Presiding Judge of the Second
Administrative District to assign another district judge to hear relator's
motion to recuse. We are certain that Judge Harris will comply with this
opinion and request the Presiding Judge to assign another judge to hear
relator's motion. In the event he fails to do so, a writ of mandamus will
issue.
Summary
The Texas Supreme Court has established a clear precedent that district
judges have a mandatory duty to request the assignment of another judge to
hear recusal motions. This duty is not discretionary, and failure to comply
can result in a writ of mandamus. The passage directly supports the
proposition that the Regional Presiding Judge's failure to act on the recusal
motion constitutes a violation of a clear ministerial duty.
Sears v. Nueces County Sherriff Olivarez, 28 S.W.3d 611 (Tex. App. 2000)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The Texas Supreme Court mandates that when there exists a reasonable
question as to a judge's impartiality, recusal is mandatory. In determining
whether recusal is required pursuant to Tex.R.Civ.P. 18b(2)(a), the proper
inquiry is whether a reasonable member of the public at large, knowing all
the facts in the public domain would have a reasonable doubt that a judge is
actually impartial. ... However, beyond the demand that a judge be impartial
is the requirement that a judge appear to be impartial so that no doubts or
suspicions exist as to the fairness or integrity of the court.
Summary
The Texas Supreme Court requires recusal when there is a reasonable
question of a judge's impartiality. This supports the proposition that the
Respondent has no adequate remedy by appeal, as the ongoing harm and
procedural irregularities create a reasonable doubt about the judge's
impartiality. The extraordinary remedy of mandamus is necessary to address
these issues and uphold the rule of law.

A trial court has a ministerial duty to consider and rule on motions properly
filed and pending before the court, and we may issue mandamus to compel

reasonable time in which to act. Barnes v. State, 832 S.W.2d 424, 426
(Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 1992) (orig. proceeding). The circumstances of

Summary
A judge has a ministerial duty to consider and rule on motions properly filed
and pending before the court. If a judge fails to act within a reasonable time,
mandamus can be issued to compel the judge to act. This supports the

To obtain mandamus relief, a relator generally must show both that the trial
court clearly abused its discretion and that relator has no adequate remedy
by appeal. In re Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., 148 S.W.3d 124, 135-36 (Tex.
2004) (orig. proceeding). A trial court clearly abuses its discretion if it
reaches a decision so arbitrary and unreasonable as to amount to a clear
and prejudicial error of law, or if it clearly fails to analyze the law correctly
or apply the law correctly to the facts.
Summary
Clear standard for when mandamus is warranted, which aligns with the
proposition that mandamus is necessary to compel the Regional Presiding
Judge to perform a mandatory duty.

the record.'
Summary
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a(f)(1) mandates that a judge must either
recuse themselves or refer the motion to the regional presiding judge within
three business days of a recusal motion being filed. Failure to do so renders
any subsequent orders void. This supports the proposition that procedural
violations by the Regional Presiding Judge, such as not referring the recusal
motion, result in void actions and ongoing harm that cannot be corrected by
appeal after final judgment.

Summary
Mandamus is appropriate when there is no adequate remedy by appeal, and
the trial court has abused its discretion. This aligns with the proposition that

and in such a case a mandamus would lie if there was no other adequate

Summary
Mandamus is an appropriate remedy when an officer or tribunal fails to
perform a duty, especially when there is no other adequate remedy. This
aligns with the proposition that mandamus is necessary to compel the
Regional Presiding Judge to perform the mandatory duty of referring the

A relator is entitled to mandamus relief against a trial court when (1) the
relator has no other adequate legal remedy and, (2) the act sought to be
compelled is purely ministerial. In re State ex rel. Ogg, 618 S.W.3d 361, 363
(Tex. Crim. App. 2021). ... When a recusal motion is timely filed, Rule 18a
leaves a trial judge with no discretion-the trial judge must either recuse
himself or refer the motion for another judge to decide. See Rule 18a(c). ...
Thus, Relator has shown that the act sought to be compelled is purely
ministerial.
Summary
When a recusal motion is filed, the judge has a ministerial duty to either
recuse themselves or refer the motion to another judge. This duty is non-
discretionary, and failure to perform it can warrant mandamus relief. The
passage also clarifies that if there is no other adequate legal remedy,
mandamus is appropriate. This directly supports the proposition that the
Regional Presiding Judge's failure to act on the recusal motion is a violation
of a ministerial duty, justifying mandamus relief.

Summary
Criteria for mandamus relief, emphasizing the need for a clear right to the

In re Megatel Homes, LLC
Extract
Mandamus is an extraordinary remedy granted only when the relator shows
that the trial court abused its discretion and that no adequate appellate
remedy exists. ... An abuse of discretion occurs when a trial judge's ruling is
arbitrary and unreasonable, made without regard for guiding legal
principles or supporting evidence. ... The second requirement for mandamus
relief requires that the petitioner has no adequate remedy by appeal;
however, the term 'adequate'[] has no comprehensive definition. ...
Determining whether a party has an adequate remedy by appeal requires a
'careful balance of jurisprudential considerations' and 'depends heavily on
the circumstances presented.' ... Mandamus review 'in exceptional cases
may be essential to preserve important substantive and procedural rights
from impairment or loss. .. and spare private parties and the public the time
and money utterly wasted enduring eventual reversal of improperly
conducted proceedings.'
Summary
Mandamus is appropriate when a trial court fails to perform a ministerial
duty, and there is no adequate remedy by appeal. The passage emphasizes
that mandamus is an extraordinary remedy used to preserve important
rights and prevent the waste of resources in cases where the trial court's
actions are arbitrary and unreasonable. This aligns with the proposition that
the Respondent has no adequate remedy by appeal and requires mandamus
to compel the Regional Presiding Judge to act.
In re Martinez

Extract
Mandamus is an extraordinary remedy available in criminal cases only when
the relator can demonstrate, 'a clear right to the relief sought.' A relator
must demonstrate that the act sought to be compelled is purely ministerial
and that relator has no other adequate legal remedy. Generally, the absence
of a right of appeal satisfies the mandamus requirement that relator has no
adequate legal remedy.
Summary
Mandamus is appropriate when there is no adequate remedy by appeal, and
the act sought to be compelled is ministerial. The passage supports the
proposition that the Respondent has no adequate remedy by appeal, as the
harm is ongoing and not remediable by appeal, and that mandamus is
necessary to compel the performance of a ministerial duty.
In re Synergy Glob. Outsourcing
Extract
To obtain relief by writ of mandamus, the relator must establish a clear
abuse of discretion and no adequate remedy by appeal. In re Nationwide Ins.
Co. of Am., 494 S.W.3d 708, 712 (Tex. 2016) (orig. proceeding). An abuse of

Summary
Mandamus relief is appropriate when a trial court fails to rule on motions
within a reasonable time, constituting an abuse of discretion, and when
there is no adequate remedy by appeal. This aligns with the proposition that
the Respondent has suffered ongoing harm due to procedural violations and
inaction by the Regional Presiding Judge, which are not correctable by
appeal after final judgment.

CHAPTER 6 Petitions for Writ of Mandamus
Practitioner's Guide to Civil Appeals in Texas - Full Court Press
Extract
A variety of trial court failures to act, for which mandamus was held to lie,
fall within this category: failure of the trial court to rule on a motion for
default judgment within a reasonable time, failure of the trial court to rule
on a motion to enforce Rule 11 discovery agreement, failure of the trial
court to rule on a motion for appointment of personal representative, failure
of the trial court to hear and render decision on a Rule 76a motion, failure of
the trial court to rule on a severance motion, failure of the trial court to
conduct an in camera inspection of certain documents in discovery dispute,
and failure of the trial court to rule on a recusal motion.
Summary
Mandamus relief is appropriate in situations where a trial court fails to act
on motions, including recusal motions, within a reasonable time. This
directly supports the proposition that the Respondent's situation, involving a
failure to rule on a recusal motion, is a valid ground for seeking mandamus
relief. The passage provides examples of similar situations where mandamus
was deemed appropriate, reinforcing the argument that the Respondent's
case fits within this category.

administrative judicial region in which the court is located ('the regional
presiding judge'). ... If the respondent judge fails to comply with a duty
imposed by this rule, the movant may notify the regional presiding judge.
Summary
The Texas Rules of Civil Procedure mandate specific duties for the clerk and
the respondent judge when a recusal motion is filed. The clerk must
immediately deliver the motion to the appropriate judges, and the
respondent judge must either recuse themselves or refer the motion to the
regional presiding judge. If these duties are not fulfilled, the movant can
notify the regional presiding judge. This supports the proposition that
procedural irregularities occurred and were not corrected, as the rules
provide a clear process that was allegedly not followed.
Rule 9. Recusal and Disqualification
Extract
9.3 Pursuant to Rule 18a(f)(l), a respondent judge has a duty to act on the
motion within 3 business days by signing and filing with the clerk, an order
of recusal or an order referring the motion to the Presiding Judge. The clerk
of the court shall deliver a copy of the signed order to the Presiding Judge.
Summary
The rules explicitly require a respondent judge to act on a recusal motion
within 3 business days by either recusing themselves or referring the motion
to the Presiding Judge. This supports the proposition that there is a
mandatory, ministerial duty for the judge to act on the recusal motion
promptly.
