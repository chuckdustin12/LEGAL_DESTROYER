Question
Charles Dustin Myers
Answer
Critical Assessment of Charles Dustin Myers as a Litigant
This assessment analyzes Charles Dustin Myers's litigation history based on
13 cases found matching the search criteria. Given this limited sample size,
the findings may not fully represent his complete litigation experience.
Typical Role & Case Types: Myers most frequently appears as the plaintiff
or petitioner (Relator in mandamus cases), initiating legal action. His cases
predominantly involve family law disputes (mandamus actions related to
custody or parental rights, order of retrieval), traffic violations (speeding,
expired inspection), and at least one small claims case ( GEICO COUNTY
MUTUAL INSURANCE COMPANY vs CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, 
SC20-142J2). He has also been a defendant in a family law case removed to
federal court (Myers v. Myers, 4:24-cv-01185).
Motion Practice: Myers demonstrates a proactive and persistent approach
to motion practice. He frequently files multiple motions, amendments, and
supporting affidavits, as seen in several mandamus actions (e.g., IN RE
CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, 25-0361, 25-0378, 25-0367). This suggests a
detailed understanding of legal procedures and a willingness to aggressively
pursue his objectives. However, his motions are often denied, indicating
potential shortcomings in legal strategy or argumentation. For example, in 
In re Charles Dustin Myers, 02-25-00164-CV, his motions for emergency
relief and en banc reconsideration were both denied.
Average Case Duration & Outcomes: The average duration of the
analyzed cases is approximately 16 days, ranging from 2 days (traffic cases
like State of Texas vs. Charles Myers, 14-0134J2) to 28 days (IN RE
CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, 25-0361). This relatively short timeframe,
particularly for the mandamus actions, suggests a focus on expedited relief.
However, the high rate of denied motions indicates limited success in
achieving desired outcomes. Based on the cases found, his success rate
appears low, with few favorable outcomes documented. Most of his
mandamus actions resulted in denials. It is unclear from the data whether
his cases tend to settle or proceed to trial.
Most Significant Cases: The most noteworthy cases involve his repeated
attempts to utilize mandamus actions in the Texas Supreme Court and Court
of Appeals (e.g., IN RE CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, 25-0426, 25-0378, 
02-25-00164-CV). These cases highlight his persistent pursuit of legal
remedies, even in the face of repeated setbacks. The removal and
subsequent remand of Myers v. Myers, 4:24-cv-01185, also stands out,
illustrating a jurisdictional challenge in a family law dispute.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Attorneys & Law Firms: While Myers appears pro se in many cases, he has
been represented by Cooper Carter of Marx Altman & Johnson in at least
one case (Myers v. Myers, 4:24-cv-01185). The data does not provide enough
information to establish a pattern of attorney/law firm usage for specific
case types.
Expert Witnesses: There is no evidence of Myers utilizing expert witnesses
in the cases found.
Additional Insights: Myers frequently files affidavits of inability to pay
court costs, suggesting potential financial constraints in pursuing litigation.
This factor should be considered when assessing his litigation strategy and
potential willingness to settle. His cases often involve Morgan Michelle
Myers, suggesting a recurring familial or relational dynamic in his legal
disputes.
Recommendations for Opposing Counsel: When facing Myers in
litigation, anticipate a proactive and persistent opponent who is familiar
with legal procedures. Be prepared for numerous motions and filings. Focus
on challenging the legal basis of his arguments, as his motions are
frequently denied. His apparent financial constraints may offer leverage in
settlement negotiations. Be aware of the potential influence of related
parties, such as Morgan Michelle Myers, in his litigation strategy.

the case, while GEICO County Mutual Insurance Company serves as the
Plaintiff. The docket entries indicate that a citation was issued for Myers,
which has not yet been served, suggesting ongoing procedural steps in the
litigation process. The Plaintiff's Original Petition was filed on September
10, 2020, indicating the initiation of the legal action against Myers.</p>
<p><b>Status:</b> The case is still ongoing as indicated by the current
status of "Citation Issued" and the recent docket entries from September
2020, which show that the citation for the defendant, Charles Dustin Myers,
remains unserved. This suggests that no significant progress has been made
towards resolution or closure of the case.</p> <p><b>Background:</b>
The cause of action in this case appears to stem from a complaint initiated
by the plaintiff, Charles Dustin Myers, as indicated by the filing of the
"Plaintiff's Original Petition" on September 10, 2020. The docket entries
suggest that the defendant has not yet been served, as indicated by the
"Unserved" status noted on September 11, 2020. Further details regarding
the specific claims or factual background of the case are not provided in the
docket entries.</p> <p><b>Motion practice:</b> The docket entries
indicate that as of September 11, 2020, Charles Dustin Myers, the
Defendant, has not yet been served with the citation related to the claims
brought against him by GEICO County Mutual Insurance Company. The
service request was initiated on the same day, and the Plaintiff's Original
Petition was filed the day prior, suggesting that the case is at an early stage
with pending service of process. Myers's ability to respond to the claims is
contingent upon proper service, which has not yet occurred.</p>
<p><b>Duration:</b> The case was filed on September 10, 2020, and the
first docket entries occurred the following day, September 11, 2020. As
there are no subsequent entries indicating resolution or dismissal, the case
has not been concluded. Therefore, it remains open as of the last entries
recorded. The duration from filing to the latest activity is thus ongoing since
September 10, 2020.</p> <p><b>Outcome:</b> The case involves
Charles Dustin Myers as the defendant, with the plaintiff having filed an
Original Petition on September 10, 2020. As of September 11, 2020, a

citation was issued but has not yet been served, as indicated by the
"Unserved" status of the citation. The service request was made through EZ
Messenger, suggesting an attempt to expedite the process. The overall case
status remains pending due to the unserved citation.</p>
<p><b>Complexity:</b> The case appears to be relatively straightforward,
as indicated by the lack of complexity in the docket entries. The primary
actions involve the filing of the Plaintiff's Original Petition and the issuance
of unserved citations, suggesting that the matter has not yet progressed to
substantive legal disputes or motions. The service request indicates an early
stage in the litigation process, with no additional complexities or
complications evident from the available entries.</p> <p><b>Experts:</
b> The docket entries indicate that Charles Dustin Myers, the Defendant,
has not yet been served with the citation as of September 11, 2020, and
there is no mention of any experts involved in the case. Consequently, it
cannot be determined from the available information whether any experts
were hired by Myers, as the docket does not reflect their involvement.</p>
<p><b>Monetary value:</b> The docket reveals that the case involves a
plaintiff's original petition filed on September 10, 2020, but lacks specific
monetary claims or damages. Without further details on the nature of the
complaint or damages sought, it is challenging to estimate the monetary
value of the case. Based on typical civil litigation, one could speculate a
range from a few thousand to potentially several hundred thousand dollars,
depending on the context of the claims involved.</p>

relevant docket entry was made on that same date, confirming the
conclusion of proceedings in this case.</p> <p><b>Background:</b> The
cause of action in this case involves a Notice of Removal filed by defendant
Charles Dustin Myers, indicating that the case was initially brought in a
state court and subsequently removed to federal court under 28 U.S.C. §
1441. The factual background leading to the removal is not explicitly

322nd Judicial District Court of Tarrant County, Texas, for lack of subject
matter jurisdiction, as determined by Judge Reed C. O'Connor.</p>

Notice of Removal, which included extensive attachments indicating his
legal strategy and arguments. His representation is confirmed through the
presence of legal counsel, Cooper L. Carter from Marx Altman & Johnson,
along with a Certificate of Interested Persons/Disclosure Statement,
demonstrating compliance with procedural requirements. However, the case
was ultimately remanded to the 322nd Judicial District Court of Tarrant
County, Texas, for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, highlighting a
significant setback in Myers' attempts to maintain the case in federal
court.</p> <p><b>Duration:</b> The case lasted from December 4, 2024,
when it was filed, to December 6, 2024, when it was terminated, resulting in
a duration of just two days. The case was remanded to the 322nd Judicial

jurisdiction.</p> <p><b>Outcome:</b> The case was remanded to the
322nd Judicial District Court of Tarrant County, Texas on December 6, 2024,
due to a lack of subject matter jurisdiction, as ordered by Judge Reed C.

that it did not have jurisdiction to hear the matter. The case is now officially
closed as of December 6, 2024.</p> <p><b>Complexity:</b> The case
involves a notice of removal filed by Charles Dustin Myers, indicating the
complexity revolves around jurisdictional issues, as evidenced by the order
remanding the case due to lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The docket
entries suggest procedural motions and a significant number of

ultimately the case was closed after being remanded to the state court.
Overall, while there are multiple filings and procedural steps, the core issue
appears to be straightforward concerning jurisdiction.</p>
<p><b>Experts:</b> The docket does not indicate the involvement of any
experts in the case. Charles Dustin Myers, identified as a Defendant, is
actively represented by legal counsel, but there is no mention of expert
witnesses being hired or utilized in the proceedings.</p> <p><b>Monetary
value:</b> The docket does not specify a monetary amount sought in the
case, as it primarily pertains to procedural matters, including a notice of
removal and subsequent remand due to lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
Therefore, a rough estimate cannot be provided based on the available
information. The filing fee noted was $405.00, indicating some level of
monetary consideration, but this does not reflect the potential damages or
claims of the case itself.</p>
